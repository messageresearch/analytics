He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shall thou trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid, for the terror by night, nor the arrow that flyth by day, nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor the destruction that wasteth at noon day. A thousand shall fall at thy side, 10,000 at thy right hand, but it shall not come neither. Can we say amen this morning? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation.

And we have a special tip we like to share with you that I believe will inspire you and help you and strengthen you placed into the body of Christ. It's a message to take you completely to church and recognize there's a body. It's a universal body and by one spirit you are baptized into that body. It's the body of Christ. So God bless you and we're going to go straight into that message tonight. What a shame. Praise the Lord. It looked like it was over and it looked as if it was over. You you made a way. Now I'm standing here. And now I'm standing here. Oh, only because you made a Oh, you you made a way. Lift your hands and sing. Oh, when our backs were against the wall.

That's Jesus. [Music] Oh, he made a way for us this morning. Let's bow heads and we want to close our eyes and want to look to the Lord and pray. Father God, we thank you for your blood, for your mercy, your grace. Lord, we feel the windows of heavens are open this morning, Lord, and your grace and blood and love and pouring out. Lord, may you speak to every heart here this morning as we wait on you. And Lord, we know what the people, you know what the people have need of. May you come and minister to them and minister and meet their every need. You know the sick cases among us. You know the request that we have here. Oh Lord, may you speak to our hearts and anointed with such a faith to believe for all things are possible to them that believe. Grant it father in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. God bless you. Amen. You have your seats. Appreciate the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, we feel his presence. Do you feel his presence this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I ask brother Anthony to sing that song this morning for me. You made a way. I love that song. It's It speaks to us. It speak to our hearts. Speak to our spirits that where we are, we are. And what we are is just by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask to bring us here this morning, but he brought us. We want to be grateful to God in our hearts for his mercy towards us. We failed him. We fall short but his mercy endured forever. &gt;&gt; He gave us the opportunity for forgiveness, for pardon, for cleansing, from sin, from restoration, for reconciliation, and we are grateful. &gt;&gt; We are thankful. We are appreciative of his his love towards us. What else could we do but worship him and praise him? We are so undeserving. But the Bible said, "Now we the sons of God and give us this great opportunity in this final uh end of time to bear witness of Jesus Christ, him being the same yesterday, today and forever." So we have some uh serious prayer requests and we want to take this right after the service. We want to go in the word now. So let's all stand. We want to say happy birthday to brother Steven Oliver. So any after service, give him a big hug and quick greetings. God bless you, brother Steven. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So this morning we want to go to our Bibles to two portion of scripture. Ephesians 4 and Colossians chapter 1. Want to welcome each and every one of you here this morning. Welcome all those connected to us live on the internet and those that would here on our YouTube channel, Headstone Tamaka YouTube channel. God bless you trusting that this message this morning will be edifying and build you and strengthen you to face and deal with the battle that leaves ahead. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4 reading from verse 4. There is one body and one spirit. Even as you are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in you all. But on the unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Want to turn to Colossians chapter 1. We want to read from verse 12 to 19. Giving thanks unto the Father, which had made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who had delivered us from the power of darkness, and had translated us into the kingdom of his dear son, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, who is in the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him are all things created in heaven and that are in the earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things are created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. Let us pray one more time. Father, we thank you for your word. May you come and interpret it to our hearts. May it be a true lamp to our feet and a light onto our path. And may it shine in righteousness to your people. May great deliverance, signs, wonders, and miracles be brought today. Confirm your word with signs and wonders. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. You may be seated. As you sit down, give the Lord a shout of praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Thank you, Jesus. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Keep your Bibles close to you. We want to read the next scripture shortly. But before that, I want to give the title. The title is placed in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a subject many members one body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have an inspiration rebuilding the church by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um many members one body. Rebuilding the church by the spirit. I want to go into 1 Corinthians chapter 12. And I want to read from verse 4. That's right. 1 Corinthians. 1 Corinthians chapter 12. Anybody find it? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. There are differences of administrations but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which workketh all in all. And the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with. For one to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit. To another the gifts of healing by the same spirit. To another the working of miracles. To another prophecy. To another discerning of spirits. To another diverse kinds of tongues. to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh that one the cells same spirit divide into each man severally as he will. For as the body is one and had many members, and all the members of that one body, so also is Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. And if the foot shall say, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, "Because I'm not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?" If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing? &gt;&gt; If the whole body were hearing, where were the smelling? But now God had set the members, every one of them, in the body as it had pleased him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if there were all one member, where were the body? But now are there many members, yet one body? &gt;&gt; And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee. Nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body which seemed to be feeble are necessary. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; For those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, God upon these we bestow much abundant honor, and our uncumbly parts have more abundant comeliness. For our comedy parts have no need, but God had tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to the part which lacked. That there should be the purpose is that there should be no schism in the body. And that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one one member suffer, all the members suffer with it. When one member be honored, all the members be rejoice with it. Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular. May God bless his word. Oh, praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for the scripture. Read in Ephesians 5:30 says, "For we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are actually members. We have one body and we have hands, we have feet, we have ears and eyes and so on. Is not one member is entire body but many members in that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. So too is the body of Christ. And Christ and that Christ body will have many members. &gt;&gt; It's a many membered body. Isn't that right? And you have to be placed in that body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we still in Joshua now. We still in Ephesians. We still in the land of promise where you have to drive the enemy out and come into your possession to possess what you know is your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot possess if you don't know what is your own. Therefore, what is your own has to be revealed to you and then that gives the faith to go and possess. Now, God don't want you observe the land, watch the land. God want you to possess the land. That is why God tell Joshua told us is the men go out and and go through the land and come and bring a description of the land. The description is evidence you have been through the land. &gt;&gt; You cannot describe what you did not see. You cannot describe what you didn't experience. The fact that Joshua asked for a description mean these guys walked through the land and God want you to walk through your land. You have to know your scriptures. You have to know your promise. That's why Jesus could go through the land and find the place where it is written &gt;&gt; the spirit is upon me because he had anointed me. &gt;&gt; He had to find the scriptures. But Brandham had to find Malachi 4, Luke 17:30. Isn't that right? Revelation 10:7. He had to find a scripture and begin to anoint it. Now when he begin to discover it, he didn't manifest the scriptures just yet, but he was connected to it. He had to believe, I am that Malachi 4 scripture. He had to believe, I am that Elijah that was prophesied. He had to believe the spirit of Elijah is upon him. He had to believe that. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He had to look back and see he was that seven angels messenger. &gt;&gt; He had to look in the scripture and see he would reveal the son of man. That was his scripture. What about your scripture? &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; That's your scripture. He shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. That's your scripture. The spirit and the bride say come. That's your scripture. The same works I do shall you do also. That's your scripture. You have scripture also. &gt;&gt; That you have to begin to believe and anoint. [Applause] Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Cain and Abel. No rum, no whiskey, no smoke, no ganja, no cigarette. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Say &gt;&gt; brothers growing up. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And God say, "Come and worship me." All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me see your revelation of who I am. &gt;&gt; Cain brought flowers. &gt;&gt; Ael brought blood. &gt;&gt; God confirmed Abel's revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And rejected Cain's. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But in that rejection, God put a door. &gt;&gt; He said, Cain, if you do like your brother, &gt;&gt; just follow &gt;&gt; because he has revelation. &gt;&gt; Just follow him. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you do what he does, &gt;&gt; I'll bless you the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So even if you don't have a revelation, &gt;&gt; you could do like others who have revelation &gt;&gt; and get the same blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is brother Brennham. And the only way, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; that one was received could have done anything different from his brother, it was revealed to him. And Hebrews 11 said, "By faith, &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than of Cain, which God testified he was righteous." &gt;&gt; Just the offering of the sacrifice, &gt;&gt; God gave testimony. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That that's a righteous man. &gt;&gt; The man don't have to do anything. just bring a sacrifice and God said that's his righteous seed, &gt;&gt; the seed of Abel. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Blessed is the man that God will impute righteousness. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Without works. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? When God pronounce you are righteous, &gt;&gt; you are righteous. &gt;&gt; Because that's the pronouncement of God. &gt;&gt; No man can change that. Your sins can't change that. &gt;&gt; What your family did can't change that. What your father, grandfather, great-grandfather did can't change that. &gt;&gt; That's a pronouncement of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; I want to free you from your past. Free you from what the devil told you. Free you from what your family did. Forget about it. [Applause] That's why Jesus said, "Who does men say I, the son of man, am?" &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; They're talking, talking, talking. What they saying about me? Some say you are John the Baptist. Some say you, some say you liar, some say you're this, some say you're that. He said, "Who do you say that I am?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they got caught. Following a man for three and a half years, they don't know where he is. A nice man. He's a good man. He does do miracles. We know he different. He have a higher level, higher authority. Who is this man? &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, Peter said, "De Christ, son of the living God." &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "Flesh and blood had not revealed it to you." You didn't read it in the book. You didn't get it in my email. You're going to get it by text. Nobody on WhatsApp it to you. Flesh and blood had not revealed it unto you, but my father in heaven had revealed it unto you. And here we go. Here we go now. And upon this rock, &gt;&gt; I will build. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Not not this pastor going to build. I will build &gt;&gt; my church. And according to Colossians, he's the head of the body &gt;&gt; called the church. &gt;&gt; So the church is Christ's body. &gt;&gt; The real church, &gt;&gt; the true church upon this rock. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; We have church buildings, church structure. We have pastors and deacons. But that's not what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; He didn't say some man will build it upon this rock. &gt;&gt; What's that rock? Upon this revelation. That means he has to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Upon this rock, I will build my church. &gt;&gt; Not upon the information. Come on now. Not upon the knowledge. Come on now. But when the spirit revealed to you, I don't care what the devil, you could be trapped this morning. You could be in a hell hole this morning. But if God reveal himself to you, the devil have to back up. Back up. The devil have to give up. The devil have to put away his guns because who does Solomon set free? Is free indeed. Of course, there are issues. They're supposed to have issues in your life. That's what he came for. He came to heal the sick. He came to set the captive free. He came to bring deliverance to them that are bound. He came to open the blind eyes. There got to be somebody sick. There got to be somebody bound. There got to be somebody demonpossessed. There got to be a death, a blind, a heart, a lame, a dead. There got to be somebody that God can't work on. &gt;&gt; Be seated. &gt;&gt; There going to be an obstacle. &gt;&gt; There going to be a red sea &gt;&gt; to know that he made a way. &gt;&gt; There got to be obstacle. There got to be a wall around Jericho that we could know that God could bring down the walls. That's why That's why there was a Jericho that we could have faith in the last days. God could make the impossible possible. Yes. Yes. Yes. God could open up the Red Sea. God could make a way there. There's no way. You're going to have faith this morning. You're going to have the faith to believe for yourself that you're going to get out your condition. You're going to get out your sickness. You're going to get out your situation. You're going to preach faith into you this morning. Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord a shout. I don't care what's in your home, what's around you. I don't care what messing with your husband, what messing with your wife. I don't care what messing your mind right now. [Applause] Remember, [Applause] &gt;&gt; remember Adam get kicked out. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; they got kicked out. &gt;&gt; But that didn't stop Abel from getting revelation. Because sons and daughters, &gt;&gt; are you ready? &gt;&gt; Have the ability &gt;&gt; to hear &gt;&gt; from God [Applause] &gt;&gt; without anybody in between. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We preach the word, but we can't reveal the word. &gt;&gt; We preach the word, but the Holy Ghost is the revealer of what we preach. So, you're hearing it, but when it drop down like the spirit, &gt;&gt; that's yours. &gt;&gt; You You didn't hear me. &gt;&gt; You did not hear me this morning. If you heard that, you'll be shouting. &gt;&gt; When we are preaching this morning, the word &gt;&gt; between me and you, the word coming out, &gt;&gt; but the spirit is hanging over. [Music] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. That's why Hebrews says the word didn't profit them &gt;&gt; because it wasn't mixed with faith to them that heard it. So even though 2 million was hearing Moses, it's only Joshua and Caleb had divine revelation as to what to possess. So it's not the multitude, the multitude is always mixed. It's the elect, Mr. Multitude that could catch divine revelation and move by inspiration. &gt;&gt; You can hear me this morning. Oh glory be in the spirit this morning. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Understand this. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was walking on the water, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Lord, if that you be me to come, &gt;&gt; Jesus said one word, &gt;&gt; come &gt;&gt; Peter had a choice. I stayed right here. &gt;&gt; Getting frightened by the second." Peter had a choice. He didn't wait and say, "Lord, have mercy upon me, Lord, in the name of Jesus. Lord God, sanctify me or I don't worthy to walk in this water." No, he didn't go down in that premitting mode. &gt;&gt; He just hear a word come and he stepped out. &gt;&gt; He stepped out and he began to walk just like Jesus. He began to walk on the water just like Jesus. It wasn't Jesus. It was Peter obeying Jesus. And if God tell you walk this morning, just walk. [Applause] Oh my. You be seated. Oh, some of you waking to see the walls come down before you shout. He didn't tell them that. He said, "Shout &gt;&gt; shout by the walls up." &gt;&gt; When I did you shout, &gt;&gt; shout by the tumor. The doctor say you have a tumor. Shout when the doctor say I resist. Shout when the doctor give up on you. But don't give up on God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; When you could shout before the walls come down that prove you have faith. When you could stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but strong given praise to God and you don't have evidence of that child that is faith. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When you could tell yourself if you could just touch the hem of his garment and push between men legs and push men aside and press and push and push. You can't talk it. You have to walk it. Give the Lord some praise people. You could talk talk talk talk but when the time come to apply your faith to your situation that is when it matters. &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to everybody inside of here? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jesus said by the Christ upon this rock I'll be my church. He said blessed are thou son but Jonah flesh and blood never reveal it to you. My father which is in heaven hath revealed it to you. Upon this rock I'll build my church what? What? This is prophet the true revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is the true vine again. &gt;&gt; It have true revelation. It have false revelation. &gt;&gt; It have revelation and it have intellectual reasoning. &gt;&gt; As I said Thursday night have a bunch of ministers now had to call them ticklers. They anointed to tickle the ears of the people and they have silly woman laden with diverse lust have in the ears itching to hear new doctrine, new teaching, new revelation and the devil just have it for them &gt;&gt; because they don't want to hear it will rain &gt;&gt; because if it will rain you have to prepare for it. &gt;&gt; They don't want to prepare for it. &gt;&gt; You if you know it will have dynamics. The Holy Ghost is about to pour out. You're going to make preparations for it. &gt;&gt; Because faith, which is revelation, brings preparation, brings expectation for the manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham got a revelation of Isaac coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sarah God did not I love what God did. He did not talk to Sarah. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. All right. &gt;&gt; So Sarah have no encouragement for Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes, Abraham. I'm back. Amen. Amen. Sarah can't say no. Amen. Sarah have a old horror because she's a old woman &gt;&gt; and she has no faith to believe in this powerl that Abraham testifying about &gt;&gt; but God told Abraham through Sarah &gt;&gt; when Sarah started to believe she introduced Abraham to Hagar &gt;&gt; she had an interpretation with her belief &gt;&gt; but Sarah so Abraham can rely upon Sarah so I back because my wife encourage Encourage me. Is that right? &gt;&gt; In which Bible you find that? &gt;&gt; Not in this one. David say I encourage myself. &gt;&gt; You have nobody a shake my hand. That's that's cool. &gt;&gt; Nobody ain't calling me. That's cool. Do you call anybody? You have to do better than that. You have to be rugged. &gt;&gt; You have to believe God designed you for this hour. &gt;&gt; You have to see no weapon formed against you will prosper. &gt;&gt; You have to believe when you walk, devil is trembling. &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. That's your scripture. &gt;&gt; No man shall be able to stand before thee &gt;&gt; all the days of thy life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you're not going expecting defeat. &gt;&gt; You expecting victory &gt;&gt; every time. &gt;&gt; If defeat come, you deal with it. &gt;&gt; If you fall, you get back up. You dust your pants. You dust your dress. You dust your clothes. and you get back up and you go back in the ring again because you supposed to win this fight. And if the devil feel you're going to pack up, you say, "No, devil. You win this one, but I'm coming back because my God is awesome. &gt;&gt; My God is real." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Like David when David asked God about a man that prospering and God David God tell David have you consider his end &gt;&gt; don't let that prosperity fool you &gt;&gt; forget that it's a race we running &gt;&gt; are we all coming to a finishing line &gt;&gt; oh praise God could you let's continue so by faith what is faith we keep saying this but we want to get on with it &gt;&gt; what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, hear the stinger in it. Now, faith is a revelation of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to put something onto that. The will of God to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Not the church will of God. Well, the will of God fa to come to service this morning because don't don't forsake their destiny together. That that's fine. That's scripture. But I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about amidst the word, God will speak to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because faith is not given for somebody for you. &gt;&gt; Faith is given to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't lend your faith. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You could believe for others. You got to say, "Hold that. Hold that piece of faith." No. I perceive you have faith to be healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Rise up and walk in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; That man have faith inside of him. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you have to look for God revealing to you his will. Because once you connect to the will of God for your life and you do it, you're free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Elijah Faming time, he told woman when the woman bake me a cake first because God told Elijah, I have a w a woman there to feed thee there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's family. &gt;&gt; And I ordained a woman to feed you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has studying how he going to look and what he thinking in his mind and what kind of fight election and that you know God say I ordain a will woman &gt;&gt; to feed you. &gt;&gt; That is the anointing I release upon her. &gt;&gt; That is the power I release upon her. She doesn't even know it &gt;&gt; that she's ordained. &gt;&gt; She is fixed for that. She is built for that. She could make a good bake. she could fix something just right &gt;&gt; for this man of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when he get the word from the Lord, I ordain this woman to feed you. &gt;&gt; When he come there, he know it's famine. He said, "Bake me a cake first." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now God have to work on both sides. This man is anointed. He know the will of God. He know that woman purpose. This woman is being tested because she have a son. She have the last bit of oil. She have the last bit of flour. She was thinking that's the last meal. But this man of God come and say, "Take me a cake first." She put God first because she was hearing from God. She got a revelation. That's a genuine man of God. Oh, the Lord, I shout in the house. Oh, &gt;&gt; you may be seated. &gt;&gt; And when that woman &gt;&gt; turned, she had a choice, you know, &gt;&gt; say you old man, I ain't making no big for you. Is me and my son and my bacon dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when she turned &gt;&gt; to obey, &gt;&gt; thus sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; your flower not going to run down. &gt;&gt; Your oil going to not fail until rain fall upon the earth. My God, I can see that woman when she dip for flour, she dip for flour. When she say she want some more flour, she add a little too much water. So she need some more flour to mix up with that water. She don't want no sy mixture. When she dip, there was flour there. When you dip, there going to be power there. When you dip, there going to be virtue there. There going to be faith there. There going to be knowledge and temperance and pain. Whatever you have need of, you want to just dip, it's going to be there. We heard from God. We heard thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation doesn't make you behave differently. &gt;&gt; Look at those four guys, those friends &gt;&gt; who had the friend &gt;&gt; and Jesus in a house and they come with a friend in a pallet &gt;&gt; and there was a press all around the house. They can't get around. They can't get back door, front door, crowd all around the house. But they come too far to turn back now. Too much of faith in this. I thought in this problem for so long it it could have friends like that. Friends that could carry you. When you can't carry yourself, God help us to get that kind of friend. When you can't carry yourself, there are some people just give up on you. Some people looking for you to fall. They're looking for you to fail. forget them. You will not fall. You will not fail. You're going to come true. Give the Lord a shout in the house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be seated. &gt;&gt; The rest down the front of the pallet. Let me scout around to see how we can solve this thing &gt;&gt; because we are moving. &gt;&gt; You see, faith doesn't take back down. Faith doesn't give up. Faith does scout. Faith does spy. Faith does walk. Faith does look for a way how to move this mountain. I don't let the mountain move or move through the mountain, but I'm not going to give up. I am sick, but I'm going to be healed. Praise God. I'm bound, but I'm going to be free. That's what faith does. Faith is militant. Faith doesn't back down. Faith don't give up. Oh, the Lord shouters in the house. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; One man look up. &gt;&gt; He see roof. &gt;&gt; He see a soul up there. &gt;&gt; He said, "Friend, &gt;&gt; I get the answer. &gt;&gt; We're going up." &gt;&gt; Everybody going around. &gt;&gt; We're going up. &gt;&gt; We going higher. &gt;&gt; And they went higher and begin to rip off the roof. And they rip off the roof. All of a sudden Jesus is preaching roof moving and then the friends start to let down their friends. They are letting that down. They say, "Oh, you're sick. Go and take a doctor." They know that they coming for that. They let down that man because of the healer is there. The pillar of fire is there. They know power is there. They know supernatural is there. They know manifested son is there. And they know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday. Hallelujah. Look at that. &gt;&gt; That man came through the roof. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And walk out the door. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Come through the roof. &gt;&gt; Walk out the door. &gt;&gt; Pick up your bed and walk. &gt;&gt; Get out of that depression. Get out of that frustration. Open your mouth and make some Holy Ghost noise. What [Applause] &gt;&gt; you have a noisy bunch? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You start to make enough noise yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Faith is a staggering thing, you know. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It's faith that's faith is something else you know &gt;&gt; faith is what make David said I'll cut your head off &gt;&gt; how man could talk that talk &gt;&gt; a young shepherd boy with sling &gt;&gt; and stone &gt;&gt; what gol I'll cut your head off &gt;&gt; but that's what faith does &gt;&gt; faith doesn't make you speak &gt;&gt; praise God beyond what you [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah I am healed &gt;&gt; I am free &gt;&gt; look look what the Bible says And let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So faith is a revelation of the will of God. &gt;&gt; I shall not die but live. &gt;&gt; That angel passing all around. Say go go go go take a trip &gt;&gt; and God gave you a scripture. I shall not die &gt;&gt; but live &gt;&gt; because I still have a testimony &gt;&gt; to give for God. That's what Simeon had. It was revealed to Simeon. He shall not see death until he see the Lord's Christ. &gt;&gt; That angel waiting for him. And Simeon tell that angel, "No way. &gt;&gt; You can't touch me. Right now, you could only watch me. But until Messiah come, you can't touch me. My life is anointed. My life is appointed. My life is elected. My life is predestinated. My life is ordained. There is a purpose. I have to be a witness of Messiah. Messiah have to come to the temple. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; So what's something? Simeon can't be under expectation in his house with him as Messiah. &gt;&gt; There is no promised Messiah coming to his house. He knows Messiah coming in the temple. &gt;&gt; So Simeon set himself up waiting in position. Simeon is sitting in place every service. He is rocking because he know that baby have to come to get offered up according to the law. So he know one day he don't know which day but he know one day Messiah going to come into the house. What if is today? What if is now? What if is you? He is coming to my brother. Oh could we shout? Do we shout in the house? And there is Simeon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God revealed it to him. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; No books, &gt;&gt; no elder. &gt;&gt; No prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No so-called apostle that they want to put themselves to be now. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Not them men. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; revealed to Simeon. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; No Mary, no intercessor, no nothing in between. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; re revealed to an old man. &gt;&gt; I like that old man. nearing a little a little a little banana peel fall inside the grave. &gt;&gt; My Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Old man &gt;&gt; and a man say I shall not die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But live &gt;&gt; until Messiah come. &gt;&gt; 6 months pass every service. Aha. And Messiah will come. Maybe today expectation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One day &gt;&gt; little lady &gt;&gt; named Mary. She was about the 12th or 14th or 15th or 16th mother to pass by. Condemned there's not one baby born. There's many babies coming into the temple. And Mary just passing by. And as he passed by, watch this. As Mary passed by, &gt;&gt; Simeon just feel the anointing come all over him. Holy Spirit upon him. This whole man &gt;&gt; move now. And he start to move. He start to move. It have this mother. It have that mother. It have that mother. All them lined up with the baby. And he's passing this church. He's passing that church because he's looking for seven thunder baby. Looking for seven voices. Looking for seven mysteries. Looking for seven seals. Looking for seven spirits. Oh, do I hear a shout in the house, all these mothers lined up there, he went straight to Mary. Why? Why? The same spirit &gt;&gt; that reveal it to him. That's right. It's the same spirit that direct him to the baby seated &gt;&gt; to confirm it are no flukes. &gt;&gt; No flukes. &gt;&gt; Glor &gt;&gt; because in the mount of two or three witnesses &gt;&gt; let everything be established. &gt;&gt; That why you said don't receive an accusation against the elder. &gt;&gt; You have two witnesses and the witness have betrayed. I see this brother or I see this brother so and so and so. You have that two witnesses &gt;&gt; to confirm if that is really so. And those two witnesses have to be tried. You're not even supposed to receive that. &gt;&gt; Two witnesses at least. &gt;&gt; Here come blind Anna. She's blind. So now you you have no excuse. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost could see. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost know exactly where Mary is. &gt;&gt; Blind Anna. She can't see no baby, no mother. But she calling straight. No, no, no, no, no, no. Straight. straight to Mary &gt;&gt; to confirm that's the Messiah. &gt;&gt; When when when when Simeon finished, he say, "Lord, let this depart in peace &gt;&gt; because the devil harassing me for so long. Now time up. I departed in peace. Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; My purpose is now accomplished. My purpose is now fulfilled. Oh, give the Lord some shout. &gt;&gt; God, I call you to give up, pack up, let go. God call you to be strong. &gt;&gt; God call you to overcome. Every child step on it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I remember the story about the donkey. Somebody throw the donkey in a pit, kill the donkey and they go and bury the donkey and they keep throwing dirt on the donkey and the donkey jump up and stepping on it. Jumping and step jump and step on it. Dump and step on it until the donkey come out out the whole thing. &gt;&gt; The dirt come and bring leverage to get the donkey out. May all the what people throwing on may it become leverage. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You're going to shut the mouth of the critics. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes we will. Yes we will. I believe that with all my heart. I can't vindicate myself. God had to vindicate his sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall &gt;&gt; and it looked like it was all over. &gt;&gt; But you made a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I am standing here, &gt;&gt; not sitting, standing &gt;&gt; upon the promises of yours. &gt;&gt; I believe God really love you. &gt;&gt; You don't know how much God loves you &gt;&gt; because God chose you in this last day. &gt;&gt; You're miserable. Yes. You're contrary sometimes. Yes. You're off key. Yes. But he still love you. Here's [Applause] why I have a drop. Am I in the spirit this morning? &gt;&gt; Because course love is a parental love. &gt;&gt; You have two children, one miserable one thing. You love this one, you love this one, you love this strong. You're telling them you love everybody same. That whole talk. &gt;&gt; God love is not parental love. &gt;&gt; His love is elective love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He love you because he elect you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I don't care what you have been through. God fight. Oh good. No God not on that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; By the one of the well didn't fight in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; How how much how much man you had? Well you had five. You want know yours. Okay I done. I gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; His love is elective. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His love look for the gene behind the flesh. &gt;&gt; Behind the spirit behind the short dress behind the drinks behind the smokes. behind the adultery, behind the fornication, behind all the death. He looking for the gene. &gt;&gt; So he could tell Peter come. Peter is a cusper. Peter is a fisherman. Peter know all the swear words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that didn't stop Jesus from saying come. &gt;&gt; He was saying come to the sea. &gt;&gt; That seed have flesh on it. &gt;&gt; That fear around it. But the seed coming. &gt;&gt; Andrew come. Phillip come. Matthew come. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now watch whether Matthew like Philillip and Philip hate Peter that has nothing to do with itise &gt;&gt; because Matthew didn't call Philillip &gt;&gt; is Jesus called every one of them. &gt;&gt; So they have to get over it. &gt;&gt; They have to get over their issues &gt;&gt; because God called all of them. It have many members &gt;&gt; but one body. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we are not the one calling the members because by one spirit, &gt;&gt; we are baptized into that body and that body is the universal body of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So despite what minister think that the bride or the church belong to them and is their own and their wife and all kind of nonsense and I call it nonsense &gt;&gt; besides what they think about the church my Bible teaches me he's head &gt;&gt; of the body &gt;&gt; called the church &gt;&gt; not I am head he is head &gt;&gt; it have a local body yes but this body that is Christ's body he is the head of that &gt;&gt; and he is coming back for his body &gt;&gt; he is coming back to connect to his And if you belong to the body, you have to get inside of there &gt;&gt; by his spirit. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And we have a promise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That the church will be rebuilt. &gt;&gt; By the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's our promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After the ministry of the word, we'll have a time with the ministry of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So faith is a revelation of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; What is faith? There's something that revealed to you that is not yet and you believe it will be. &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation by the of the will of God. And the churches today don't believe in spiritual revelation. They believe in the dogmatic teaching of some system. So the people are very proud to testify what they believe and to tell you well we don't believe the same thing. A brother tell me what I preach on can't take nobody to no rapture. I said I never know what teaching taking the rapture. I thought was faith and virtue and knowledge. I thought was the life that God is taking up because magnet he say you have to be magnetized to the headstone. So when the magnet pass magnet picking up word and stone and paper the magnet taking what is magnetized to it. &gt;&gt; So they have to have a magnetism in you when the spirit capstone headstone come to pick you up with it. &gt;&gt; So you have to be magnetized to the headstone. &gt;&gt; He didn't say you have to join a church. No, you have to get magnetized. You have to get the magnetism of the Holy Ghost inside of you. And then God when God get pick you up. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; There are difference in administration but the same spirit. &gt;&gt; My gift is different from other brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Same spirit. &gt;&gt; Different gifts different man uh administration and so on. But it's one spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even as there is one lord &gt;&gt; and one body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to see the one body today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go beyond this group. Go beyond this church. See one body &gt;&gt; and see you have to get into that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is your destination &gt;&gt; to be placed into the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; You can't place yourself and I can't place you. &gt;&gt; The God who called you have to place you &gt;&gt; in that body by his spirit. &gt;&gt; And when God places you, nobody could unplace you. &gt;&gt; David knew his position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That why David could ride the way he ride. &gt;&gt; Remember we talk about when they talk David wives.

God send lightning and kill them fellow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this is David property now. &gt;&gt; This is wife. This is family. This is inheritance. This is your portion. This is the land. God said pursue. &gt;&gt; He tired but he had to pursue. &gt;&gt; He ried whole night. Whole night &gt;&gt; and then cut themselves off and take take them out and bring back his own family. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what God want you to do. &gt;&gt; David was only an example. &gt;&gt; I say pursue. &gt;&gt; Don't give the devil any room. &gt;&gt; Don't tell him that small is all right.

Praise God. &gt;&gt; That gave you a fight, a little music because your brother was lost his phone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then your brother was a little crack, a little smile because he recognized he is his heritage not not in jeopardy. Father say all is yours. &gt;&gt; What the scripture we read? When one member suffered, &gt;&gt; all suffered. When one member is honored, &gt;&gt; all is honored. &gt;&gt; So we want to rejoice &gt;&gt; with somebody that we can rejoice with. &gt;&gt; When God honor you, we want to honor you. &gt;&gt; We want to back you up. We don't want to stand with jealousy and get fight because of God blessing upon your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are members. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of his body. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; And that's how we supposed to have the same care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One for another. &gt;&gt; The same concern, the same body. Say if this brother sick like you sick too. &gt;&gt; If this brother don't, you like you down too. and you want to step into his shoes and that's a gift brother Brandham had &gt;&gt; to step into somebody's sho he was in India and the people worship the son and so on there was a guy that was blind and he had no shoes on his feet &gt;&gt; and the first thing brother Brandham did was to put his foot to see if his shoe size could fit him &gt;&gt; you want to give him his shoes &gt;&gt; you have to be able to enter into the person's suffering &gt;&gt; that is how you could pray for somebody that's why sometime you go through suffering yourself that when you hear about somebody suffering you could enter into him because you have been You have had that pain. You have had that struggle. You have had that condition and you could be empathized to that person. &gt;&gt; Step into their shoes. &gt;&gt; Other than that, sit down and criticize and complain about their work. I I was me, I wasn't going to walk. So I am not like that sinner outside. I come to church every service. I pay my tithe. I do this. I do that. &gt;&gt; And I s say Lord have mercy upon me. &gt;&gt; I'm just Mr. Sinner. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that man outside is more righteous than the man inside. &gt;&gt; But we need to come back to humility. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The first sign of the Holy Ghost is humility. &gt;&gt; Because it's God made a way for you. &gt;&gt; Is God grace come upon your life to give you this freedom and his liberty. I am free this morning. I have no enemy outside. I have no minister fighting outside. I have nobody give me a big fight. I have I have my own fight, my own self. I fight him with it. I have nobody out there to give me fight. You understand what I'm saying? Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. If anybody is my enemy that that that is their business. They make theel enemy. But as far as I concerned, the enemy is the devil. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I am loving this gospel. &gt;&gt; And I am loving the brethren. &gt;&gt; If you know what pushed me to where I am right now, if I tell you, Lord have mercy. And that's why I enjoyed the trial so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I was pushed into my destiny. Oh hallelujah &gt;&gt; push. I mean push. &gt;&gt; Yes. No I'm not Joseph. I give him a point. Right. When Joseph brethren get in fight with him because he's spiritual and he father love him. Bible said that make him a special coat. &gt;&gt; Rainbow kind. &gt;&gt; Yes. Seven color. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not one color kind. &gt;&gt; Seven. &gt;&gt; Seven colors with that loud. You know &gt;&gt; you know I mean you could see it from a mile. You know that that's a loud kind of quote. When you see that quote, you know Joseph coming. &gt;&gt; That quote alone said Joseph coming not one of the brethren like Joseph coming. &gt;&gt; So he was titled labeled positionally placed Joseph &gt;&gt; rainbow coat. When you get that close get big fight &gt;&gt; this is not outside people outside you know this is his own brethren &gt;&gt; get big fight because of revelation inspiration vision prophecy upon that man's life. &gt;&gt; We had to get rid of this man yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. Father love expressing too much. Father love, Father, I can't help it. Father, Joseph represent perfection. Joseph represent God. It's too much. Decide to sell him out. Okay. They sell him out to Egypt. They say they kill him. They only sell him. But they they take the lamb skin and come with blood and bring Joseph coat and sell the coat bloody and whatnot and he dead. He dead. He dead. Oh, they know they kill the brother. So they don't have no murder in upon the spirit. She say you murder the brother. &gt;&gt; We just make him disappear. &gt;&gt; We just make him move out of our conscious thinking. We move him out from there. So as far as they're concerned, the father gather they he won't stop to grieve. Father heart and joy gone. Joseph balling. He can't believe it. Now Joseph horror is to believe his own brother's dream. &gt;&gt; So Joseph in a real devastated comfort. Yes, &gt;&gt; he's inconsolable &gt;&gt; cuz I mean if somebody outside do you something that's one thing when your own brother take you and throw you out to the Egyptian is Egyptian talking about &gt;&gt; it's is caravan pirates of the desert &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; taking Joseph to send out to Egypt &gt;&gt; so Joseph afterwards time does bring heal hurts and different things afterward Joseph settled himself you know this is what it is &gt;&gt; but you see the condition didn't change who he was &gt;&gt; and what he was placed to do What the brethren did not understand, he was pushed &gt;&gt; into his destiny &gt;&gt; by that rejection, &gt;&gt; by that condition, by that trial, by whatever you're going through. So stop looking at what you're going through as a negative. Understand what Romans 8:20 is about. &gt;&gt; For we know &gt;&gt; all, &gt;&gt; somebody say all. Oh, &gt;&gt; all things work together &gt;&gt; for good &gt;&gt; to them that love God &gt;&gt; to them who are be called &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Joseph tears, &gt;&gt; Joseph pain is petty and small compared to the burdensome task he had to save the world. &gt;&gt; I'm not hearing you. &gt;&gt; Famine is coming. &gt;&gt; No one knows about it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You may be seasoned. &gt;&gt; All right. Joseph had the gift to interpret dreams &gt;&gt; because God is a revealer of secrets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; So God pushed Joseph in that situation &gt;&gt; waiting for this appointed time. &gt;&gt; Joseph not ready yet &gt;&gt; because he's a for gardener. &gt;&gt; He's not ready yet. &gt;&gt; He had to get a promotion to be made ready. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he's doing gardening. &gt;&gt; Then he get a promotion to to be in charge of the house. And Pifer wife wanted Joseph to be in charge of her &gt;&gt; and Joseph run for his life. &gt;&gt; She felt agrieved. And then Joseph end up in prison. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He's getting ready. He's not ready yet. &gt;&gt; Watch this. He is sold. &gt;&gt; He gone to Egypt. &gt;&gt; He's an ex-man land. He gone from gardener. He's doing well. &gt;&gt; He get promoted. He run from the man wife. He's still do. He is in prisoner. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I guess if there was critics in Joseph time, dear Joseph, what have you done to be in the condition you are in? I recognize disaster keep following you. &gt;&gt; Like you're under a bad luck. &gt;&gt; I think you're under the wrong teaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you could you could imagine now David Joseph, he's there, but the gift is working. Bottle of baker. Baker condemned, butler restored. He tell the butler, "Remember me." But the butler not going to remember him because the time is not yet. &gt;&gt; When the time is right, God give Pharaoh a dream that he can remember. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; And then Pharaoh called all the wise men to say, "Listen, listen. Come tell me tell me to interpret the dream." They said, "That's a dream." He said, "I can't remember the dream." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then they say, "We we can't do that. We we need the dream to interpret it." He said, "All only asking for time." He said cut all all your head off. &gt;&gt; I didn't say I'm a wise man. All you see all is wise men. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All you see all your spiritual. All you see all the ind mysteries of all these kind of thing. Come on now. So tell me my dream and interpret it too. &gt;&gt; Not only he said gather all the wise men in the country. That where they pick up Joseph. &gt;&gt; Gather all the wise men. And that would Joseph get caught up in that whole move. Jesus tell the king hold on. There's a God that reveals secrets. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Give me. And then what happened? It unfold. It reveal and next minute Joseph is promoted &gt;&gt; to be next to Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Famine in all the land. &gt;&gt; Brethren hungry. Bre had to go to Egypt. &gt;&gt; Joseph next to Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Joseph is the man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And what happened? They had to come bow. Joseph said, "I am Joseph your brother &gt;&gt; whom you sold. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then then then listen to these amazing words. God &gt;&gt; sent me ahead. &gt;&gt; He didn't say all you nearly kill me. &gt;&gt; I nearly dead on that journey and all your too hardness. All your wicked no weak for all your No, he didn't talk. &gt;&gt; He said God &gt;&gt; send me ahead &gt;&gt; to preserve life. &gt;&gt; Now what you're hearing is the right spirit. What you hearing is the the Christ attitude. &gt;&gt; What you hearing is what we supposed to be hearing. &gt;&gt; Not oh God, she do me. He do me. No. &gt;&gt; God allow things. &gt;&gt; There's a higher purpose. &gt;&gt; As long as you stay around what this one do and that one do, you miss the will of God. &gt;&gt; You miss the vision of God. &gt;&gt; You see Samson, Samson backside went with Elila. Samson eyes dug out. But there's a higher purpose behind that. God want to place Samson behind the enemy lines. &gt;&gt; God want to take out 3,000 Philistines. &gt;&gt; Samson always looking up a 10 here, a two here. Is 3,000 going to be in that. &gt;&gt; God want to deal with them in a big way. &gt;&gt; So God sent something through a process positionally place him. He said one small Lord &gt;&gt; send out your power. &gt;&gt; This is a son on the line. &gt;&gt; These brothers had revelation. &gt;&gt; It wasn't permanently back. Backsliding is only temporary. Oh God, you don't let me start to preach this morning. &gt;&gt; Don't let me start to preach here this morning. Backslitting is only temporary. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, &gt;&gt; they have no permanent backsliding in God. Check that out. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that your son? Are you a not a son? &gt;&gt; If a son always a son. &gt;&gt; God had delivered David. God had delivered Solomon. All them brothers had the issues Noah all of them but they were sons &gt;&gt; back only temporary you know &gt;&gt; because Nebuchadnezzar will come for you sir hallelujah &gt;&gt; you didn't get that one &gt;&gt; when Israel backslide always have some king Nebuchadnezzar to take them into captivity &gt;&gt; and then they go cry and ball and then go come and deliver them &gt;&gt; that's the whole story of the Bible &gt;&gt; God bless them they power and the anointing and glory afterward the heart get cold &gt;&gt; when the heart get cold pressure then and they backslide, they get lukewarm, they get cold, and then some king come of Babylon and decide to punish them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Until they repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has to wait till he hear the cries of the people. They wasn't crying, you know. &gt;&gt; They was working for Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, you could be in a condition and you're working for Pharaoh &gt;&gt; because you're not complaining, you're not desperate, just doing your thing. &gt;&gt; But then when you get fed up, &gt;&gt; and they get tired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you begin to groan in your spirit. Lord, this is not the way to live. This is not a Christian life. This is not the way for me to walk and talk and behave. Why I am cursing, why I'm doing this, why I'm doing things contrary to the word and your will. This is not right. Lord, I'm crying out unto you. Then he go, I heard your cry. &gt;&gt; I'm coming down now to deliver. &gt;&gt; I giving a special service. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm bringing a special uncction &gt;&gt; to get them demons off of your life. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It's happening now. &gt;&gt; It's happening right now. &gt;&gt; Somebody's been delivered right now. &gt;&gt; I believe in that. Somebody going free right now. &gt;&gt; I believe in that. &gt;&gt; Somebody being healed right now. &gt;&gt; I believe in that. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We have to come and expect the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Watch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'm talking about Paul. Paul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire hit down Paul. was Saul and he was fighting the church, fighting the revelation, everything else and he didn't know he was seed. &gt;&gt; All he know he's zealous for the Pharisee doctrine. You go as far as concerned this church is a crazy church follow this man called Jesus. So there is Paul Saul rather riding on his high horse pill of fire and knock him off and he bought thou Lord right away he know who is that Paul only knew him by revelation. Peter knew him by revelation. He walked with him, talked with him. Therefore, you can set this word. Now, I've said that he was the word. A scholar can sit down, listen carefully, and read that word till it just tie your mind up in any way if he wants to. Smart, brilliant, and so on. He said a real trained theologian can do that. Brother, a Baptist, Presbyterian, he'll make you think you don't know nothing. But the only way you are saved is to know him by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can take the Presbyterian doctrine and tie you Pentecostal up till you don't know, I can take the Baptist doctrine and show you Pentecostal a million things you don't know nothing of. That's right. But that is not his church. &gt;&gt; So being able to expound scriptures and teaching and tie people up, that's not the church. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; His church is himself revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a building. &gt;&gt; It's not a group of people. His church, which is the bride, is really Christ. In other words, Christ is God revealed. &gt;&gt; The church is Christ revealed. &gt;&gt; So the church really revealed Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; So, so, so that's why you hear me say often about write the vision, make it plain. And that the word as it begin to unfold supposed to bring clarity, &gt;&gt; not more confusion. And when you see the real vision, the prophetic vision, the real core of the message, the rest is filler material. &gt;&gt; And compared to somebody giving you a gift in a bag, nice pretty bag and have the paper around it and let's say a little drink or something like that inside. The bag is not a gift. The paper around it is not a gift. is a steady it. The paper around it is filled material. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even though it's there, it looks nice, the real thing is in the middle. &gt;&gt; That's what it's about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Jews have their place. I could place about Jews and talk about Jews and talk about Jews, but that doesn't help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I could talk about Los Angeles, that doesn't help me. &gt;&gt; I could talk about the pope, that doesn't help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There are many things in the scriptures that is what God said, but doesn't apply to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It have about the tribulation. It all about vials. It all about wars. It all about wars. It have all kind of stuff inside of there. But what we want is the promises that become effective to us &gt;&gt; to face the challenge that is in our lives &gt;&gt; and to face the challenge that is yet before us &gt;&gt; because the devil not sitting still. The devil is open up his treasures &gt;&gt; to looses on the earth. &gt;&gt; When Bar had the Beatles and he said hell has been the little of hell have uncovered and streams of demon psing out. That's right. &gt;&gt; God doing so much more with virtual reality and all the televisions and baram says when it's time to go mad and nuts it's on the television. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they putting avenues and channel for demon powers to come through that &gt;&gt; witches and witch doctors and all the children story and all kind of stuff they pushing inside of that &gt;&gt; to poison people mind. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. All the foods and all is to help break down the human body. Break down the human mind. &gt;&gt; Oh yes yes yes. So Baram says we are striving to enter the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; before these plagues strike. &gt;&gt; I hope you get a burden you know &gt;&gt; I got a burden of the word you know &gt;&gt; because we have children we have grandchildren we have family and so on and we see diseases and destruction and all kind of things coming [Applause] &gt;&gt; but I'm talking about adopted sons pushing back this and pushing back that and stopping diseases and stopping cancer because it would be necessary to do it. Because Satan have a mission to kill all. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He want to destroy your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says here, he said someone said to me when I come out of my great trials after I lost my wife, baby, and everything said, "Brother Brandham, did you keep your religion during that time?" I said, "No, sir. It kept me during that time." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is what is this for? I can't keep Christ. He keeps me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It isn't whether I hang on, it's whether he held on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a gift to me. &gt;&gt; And then noticing that people have this hard time. There's got to be something wrong somewhere. If the Christian religion, watch, here we go, only consists of a declaration of creed, denomination or intellectuals, then we don't need nothing but real good, smart group of people. &gt;&gt; That's all we need. If that's the church, the church is is governed by intellectuals. Now, intellectual is all right. You can receive the word intellectually, but let it soak through to the heart and then it begin to get re results. &gt;&gt; So, the result is not just hearing it. The result is when you allow this word to soak through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if God meant for us to run his church by denominationals or by creeds, then the only thing we need is the intelligence of a man. &gt;&gt; Smarter the man, better the church. But that's not God's program. &gt;&gt; Are you ready to go down further? &gt;&gt; God's program was for the Holy Ghost to run the church. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was given for the church. Now, we can't have two faculties running the church at the same time. &gt;&gt; If man runs it, Holy Ghost goes out. &gt;&gt; That's a big one. &gt;&gt; That's a massive one. &gt;&gt; If man is running, Holy Ghost gone. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost runs it, usually the man goes out. &gt;&gt; It's one or the other. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Sometime meet a believer, meet some brother, meet somebody, and I'm listening. I'm hearing the testimony. I'm listening with a keen ear of what is the emphasis. And most time the emphasis their church and their pastor. &gt;&gt; I'm looking to hear Christ. I'm looking to hear the vision. I'm looking here the headstone, the target. I'm looking to hear beyond denomination, beyond group, beyond. I'm looking to hear that. &gt;&gt; No. First question, what church you fellowship in? What church you going to? &gt;&gt; Now they're asking that because they have a a judgment line on that. So according to where you say they react and oh you going there oh right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right they off &gt;&gt; even though they don't say that that's the behavior that's the reaction they don't want to know about you life and brother but Ram says you don't discern the church you discern the spirit and the man &gt;&gt; you don't discern the man group &gt;&gt; you doing the spirit and individual you can't judge somebody inside there by one person &gt;&gt; I look at who how they behave &gt;&gt; you have to judge somebody by the spirit in them Sometime they tell but ra sister behind the organ she just a little short. She said but he said but she have a fine spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He bust them &gt;&gt; because they wash and she dress &gt;&gt; but they have long dress and terrible spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they will look and say well she she dressed not long enough. You you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So at the end of it all it has to be a discernment. What is the person's motive and the person's objective? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. Do you love him? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it isn't what the church needs. I'll tell you what the church needs. It needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It needs the power of the living God. &gt;&gt; A revival doesn't go to and make new members. A revival means to revive what you already got. &gt;&gt; Now, now a backslider backslide from something. Something was in him and God could always activate that. &gt;&gt; So, we have to pray for backsliders. &gt;&gt; We have to pray for their deliverance and their breakthrough &gt;&gt; because his demon powers hold them captive. But Ram says what the preacher does is cast devils out of people and people receive the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So understand the people have devils on them. Sometime religious devils, enticing spirits, &gt;&gt; but when it get broken off then they get free. &gt;&gt; Then they could worship. They could honor God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Could you take some more? &gt;&gt; Unto the church of Smy, right? These things said the first and the last which was dead and alive. Notice every time he introduced himself, he put forth something of his deity. of who he is. &gt;&gt; I am God. I change not. I'm claiming who I am. I'm the first and the last. This is brother Brown. Now watch. Now Smyrna means bitterness. It comes from the words my first church had lost its first love. Ephesians church. The church had begun to get a root of bitterness coming up in them because the main church, the big part, here we go. The majority of them was hammering against the Holy Ghost ruling in the church. &gt;&gt; They wanted to rule themselves. &gt;&gt; They wanted to set up a priesthood. They wanted to act like the Old Testament people did. They wanted priests. &gt;&gt; My man, &gt;&gt; our man of the hour. We know we are it because we have this man. like one brother claiming to have the whole five-fold. It's unscriptural. God put gifts, different gifts, different gifts, different administration, different men and so on. One man can have the whole five-fold. &gt;&gt; Now, they have to say that in order to be it in order to they don't need anybody else, but that's not what the Bible teaches. Because I'm a hand, I have no need of the foot. That can't teach that. I'm the eye. I have no need of the nose. Because if we begin to realize that we are members of that body, then we need each other. &gt;&gt; And we cannot do like if we are the only pebble on the beach. &gt;&gt; We cannot do like if we are the only members of that body. &gt;&gt; We need the nose. We need a mouth. We need the ears. We need the eyes. We need all the body parts. Even those part that are not humbly. &gt;&gt; We need every part of the body. &gt;&gt; So that is why God hates the attitude. I am right. You are wrong. I am it. You are not. I have it. You don't have it. God hates that. &gt;&gt; And that's why God hate the nicolatan spirit that beats the people into and pulverize them just to be in subjection to some man &gt;&gt; for some bishop or some archbishop or some pope to take rule &gt;&gt; because God is the head of the church. &gt;&gt; And you have to recognize yourself as the body. &gt;&gt; And as you get in that body, you become part of that whole movement. &gt;&gt; And there's a part in that body for you. &gt;&gt; And your part nobody else could take. Your part nobody could replace. &gt;&gt; No part nobody can substitute for you. &gt;&gt; You are in God part of God. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; So what happened out from the pagan churches they had Jupiter priest Venus and so forth and they wanted to bring them same thing to make these men. This church had began to spring up a root of bitterness. Why? It was bitter against those who want to continue on with the Holy Ghost. The love had faded away and they were trying to swap it with creeds and denominations getting away from Holy Ghost leadership. So you swap it for teachings, mysteries, more doctrine, more knowledge, more information. So I know a whole lot up here and that makes me better than you who don't have much up here. But yet God, here we go, bypassed the Pharisees and scribes who were scriptural based people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To get fishermen who couldn't read and write. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proven when God ready to work, he don't need read and write. &gt;&gt; He need a right heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God have gifts of knowledge, &gt;&gt; gifts of wisdom, &gt;&gt; gifts of discernment &gt;&gt; that he could give to somebody without read and write. &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Do you understand that &gt;&gt; God could drop down upon you a gift of wisdom? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God could drop upon you a gift of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. God will give you a gift of discernment. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So they watch. Uhhuh. Could we take a little more? &gt;&gt; So watch the root of bitterness start creeping in and they thought they were right. Right. And they had something dignified. The great woman people would come in. They had a pope. They had great men, cardinals and so forth. They dressed fine. They got away from all the noise and everything. They had &gt;&gt; very quiet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and show they were dying. &gt;&gt; That's why I said we don't have enough noise. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. When people get away from the noise, they get quiet &gt;&gt; because they're trying to hear and they're dependent. They're writing notes and writing notes and writing notes. I say when you go home, listen back and write all your notes you want. When you come to church here, worship because you want to be in the spirit &gt;&gt; because in the spirit is where you're getting divine revelation. &gt;&gt; If you're not in the spirit, you're only hearing intellectually. But in the spirit, God could speak to you. Wait a minute. Cuz sometimes I be doing something, all of a sudden I feel the warmth of the Holy Ghost come over me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel anointed. I don't know what it's for yet, but I feel the presence of God. Like I just step into the room and I feel the anointing of God and I know he wants to direct me to something and I I see what meditation upon my heart. It's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Afterwards, the Holy Ghost come, the Holy Ghost goes. You know, the witness of the spirit comes and goes and so like that to tell you what to do, what to say, how to operate. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometime I'm tired, I go take a rest and right as I resting like a vision come, like inspiration come and I see all what to put where, where to put the quotes and everything else &gt;&gt; and my mind is be totally blown. &gt;&gt; So I come on a while here seeing this unfold and I'm stunned &gt;&gt; to see what the Lord put together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I'm telling you something that I never tell it before. &gt;&gt; And I avoid telling this kind of thing because know why scared of people &gt;&gt; trying to make you a God. &gt;&gt; Some people claiming to be God already. &gt;&gt; That just scares me. Oh, hallelujah. But Abraham, stop preaching for that, you know. &gt;&gt; They're trying to make him Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He was so much like Christ. They thought he was Jesus Christ. No people claim to be the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It is insane. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. So they got away from the noise. They were dying. They were dignified. They made a body uh um what? But the whole thing was just ical. So when they get away from the real revelation, you see because Baron says revelation brings stimulation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation can't be you shaking your head. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; T of revelation that you hearing. &gt;&gt; Faith come by hearing. you're hearing. That's mental faith. But when it's revealed, aha, you jump out. &gt;&gt; You might walk downstairs and drink some water and come back up because it's so exciting. You have to stand up. You have to do something. You can't sit still with revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation make the prophet run a tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because revelation is wine. &gt;&gt; Word is water. &gt;&gt; You can't get head from drinking water. &gt;&gt; You can get head from drinking wine. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because wine brings stimulation. &gt;&gt; That's when the upper room, they were staggering &gt;&gt; like drunk men. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was all over them. &gt;&gt; It was the wine of revelation. &gt;&gt; Say it after me. Wine of revelation. &gt;&gt; Say it again. Wine of revelation. &gt;&gt; What was Jesus first miracle? He turned water into &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe God could give you a miracle this morning &gt;&gt; and turn what you are hearing into a revelation. &gt;&gt; It brings stimulation. &gt;&gt; It have the same effect as natural wine on a man. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Natural man will be eyes glassy and they talking and they smiling, smiling, smiling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They just me vexing hard face and all that no wine. He just drink some water and the water was wasn't tasting good. When a man in wonder the wine anointing smiling and talking and want to talk to talk scripture and all &gt;&gt; you know wine &gt;&gt; when when that wine of revelation hit your spirit it raises you up &gt;&gt; look at Samson look at Samson when Samson they say we stand some sport they want to make entertainment of all the person they bring out is a blind man who once had power once destroy the Philistine they bring to embarrass him and shame him and God is not in that you're not going to embarrass Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not going to shame God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here it is. He's coming out now. &gt;&gt; Come on out. &gt;&gt; He know all them fellas, the crowd out there. &gt;&gt; Bring on Samson. A little boy leading him. &gt;&gt; Leading him. &gt;&gt; And Samson got revelation. He got inspiration. But Ram said Samson saw the possibility &gt;&gt; that God could come back upon him. &gt;&gt; That was that was the courage. &gt;&gt; So every step he was going into destiny. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every step he was going into position &gt;&gt; to accomplish the purpose of God. Every step carefully made &gt;&gt; Samson is walking. He tell the boy, "Lead me to the post. &gt;&gt; Lead me. Lead me between the pillars. &gt;&gt; Put me there." Little boy leading him. And when he stand between the pillars, they're looking for entertainment. Samson put his hands between the pillars. &gt;&gt; They didn't know what was coming. &gt;&gt; The Philistine wasn't expecting that. &gt;&gt; A prayer &gt;&gt; from a son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That once was backsliden. that's once failed, &gt;&gt; that once fell, &gt;&gt; that everybody was mocking, &gt;&gt; everybody was talking about, but he was in a different position today. &gt;&gt; He was in a position to call upon God. He's in a position to say, "Once more, Lord, let me die." Ah &gt;&gt; with the Philistines. &gt;&gt; He was willing to pay the price. He was willing to go all the way. And the power came upon that man. And he pushed it down. and more died in his death than Samson in his life. Oh, glory to God. Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; So, don't count nobody out. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Don't write nobody off. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; There is only one body. &gt;&gt; And we are members of that body. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praise out of here. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So you got to understand now. God don't want no schism in the body. &gt;&gt; God want the body wholesome. &gt;&gt; So when people get in conditions, God is concerned. But there are people in the body and then people out of the body. &gt;&gt; You want to be in the body. &gt;&gt; In the body means being in Christ. &gt;&gt; In Christ, you're a new creator. &gt;&gt; You're a new creation. Everything becomes new in Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your problems get different because you're in Christ. &gt;&gt; Then you understand Romans 8:28. You understand how all things work together for good. &gt;&gt; David was anointed to be king because God told Samuel, "I have rejected Saul." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go and anoint a son of Jesse to be king over Israel. &gt;&gt; So when Samuel put the anointing oil upon David, he was anointed there and then to be king. &gt;&gt; He wasn't ready yet. He wasn't mature yet. He wasn't trained yet. He wasn't in power yet. But he was anointed. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. God have to anoint you before you are placed. Come on now. Come on. Give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Before you could be placed, &gt;&gt; you have to be anointed. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God want David inside the palace. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The same day David get anointed, evil spirit fall upon Saul. They say music just send them spirits off, &gt;&gt; cast the spirit out. &gt;&gt; They say who could play music? They say have a man named David. He real good. &gt;&gt; He played the harp. &gt;&gt; All that is God arranging, pulling David into the &gt;&gt; into this whole thing. &gt;&gt; So David comes into the palace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Playing music for Saul. &gt;&gt; The palace he going to rule in. &gt;&gt; The palace he going to reign in. &gt;&gt; The palace he going to walk in. &gt;&gt; David is in the palace. &gt;&gt; Saul is clueless. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's He's retrenched and don't even know it. &gt;&gt; He is fired and don't even know it. &gt;&gt; He's still preaching, still teaching, but he's fired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God have a David ready. &gt;&gt; It's only a matter of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For that David to come forth. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And it's only a matter of time for you to come forth. &gt;&gt; I know you some of you doubting you will come forth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because God relying upon you because you doubting you. God relying upon the word in you. That's what I'm preaching to this morning. I'm preaching to that faith inside of you. I'm not preaching to your flesh. Your flesh is miserable. But that faith inside of you, that's that's the real thing. That's what God put in you before the foundation. That's what make you can't give up. That's what make you can't let go. You don't even know why you keep bouncing back, rocking back, coming back. You don't even you can't explain it. &gt;&gt; There's something more than you. [Applause] something beyond you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How to be something inside of you. &gt;&gt; Pushing you. &gt;&gt; What is it? A seed. &gt;&gt; God doesn't watch fail anyway. He watch the seed. &gt;&gt; That way he could treat Job the way he treat Job. &gt;&gt; He watch the seed in Job. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God know is his faith in Job. &gt;&gt; Not even Job know is his faith in Job. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? &gt;&gt; Not even Job know is the faith of God in him. &gt;&gt; God knows that. &gt;&gt; So God could tell the devil, "Hey, where you going?" So have you considered myself in Job? They say I going to and fro all over the earth. &gt;&gt; God say, "Have you have you considered myself Job? Let me get exercise." I see idol in wasting time. You call you're taking soft targets. Job say that devil say that's a hard target. You know I see have a hedge around him. God says that so. So the devil made a boast. He said if I take off the hedge I I'll deal with him. God say oh yeah I'm going to prove something. He tell the devil this. I'm going to prove it's not what's around that man. &gt;&gt; It's not what that man possess. &gt;&gt; It's what's in the man. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Some people when they get riches they get arrogant. They above everybody. They don't need church. You don't need God. You need nothing. &gt;&gt; So sometimes God have to hold back riches from some people &gt;&gt; cuz they can't handle it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God had to hold back power from people. They can't handle it. &gt;&gt; Sometime people climb into power and get in power and force you in power and when they get in power trouble, &gt;&gt; chaos. &gt;&gt; What happened? Job was stripped. Job didn't ask God. Lord, a long time I got a trial. Give me one. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; we didn't say pray for trial. I'm saying Job didn't ask for it. &gt;&gt; It just came. &gt;&gt; Disappointments, conditions, &gt;&gt; break, uh, you know, dark times, night time. It just come. &gt;&gt; How do you deal with it when you're not in charge? &gt;&gt; How you deal with it when the winds are contrary? &gt;&gt; And the storms are blowing. You didn't start it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't set it up, but it hit your life. It hit your home. Hit your house. Hit your family. How do you deal with it? &gt;&gt; Job going through. The Lord gave the Lord take it away. People think he's a secret sinner and all kind of stuff. And Job coming through, coming through, coming through. I've heard of thee by the hearing of the air, but now my eye seeth thee. &gt;&gt; Though the skin worm destroy my body, yet in my flesh, I shall see God &gt;&gt; for myself and not another. &gt;&gt; He said to see the resurrection. He started to see beyond God. Take him beyond the veil of his present condition. Think about you missed the boat. Think about you missed the revelation and only seen boils. Oh God. Oh God. What he got? God serve him like a sick. &gt;&gt; But Job see beyond that. He said listen this sickness this is temporary. Yes. &gt;&gt; This this this body business. &gt;&gt; This body if a man die shall live again. I I I'll wait till my change come. The devil is finished. Devil can't get go get Jo to say the wrong thing. I'll wait till my change come though the skin won't destroy my body yet in my flesh. You see you could talk that we could talk that scripture. But when you in the actual condition when you sitting in the in and at your condition could you say that when your child come when you cannot rise from from your heap as it was &gt;&gt; in your situation that is where those word count &gt;&gt; the Lord give the Lord take it away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. When you're in the valley let me hear your testimony. Let me hear you shouting in the valley as you're shouting on the mountain top. sharp when you're sick. Praise God anyhow because you are going to be healed. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil believe that he going to capture you and pull you down into a sick into debt. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Are you in the church triumphant? &gt;&gt; Are you in the savior's bride? &gt;&gt; Come and be baptized into the body. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Vision is the most important thing. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You may be I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Money is not as important as vision. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You can have money and no vision. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But vision could bring you into money. &gt;&gt; Vision could bring you into wealth and power and so on. Vision without a vision the people perish. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the vision is the most important thing. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture say the vision the time was long &gt;&gt; but the vision was true. &gt;&gt; You see if you know the vision is true, you could wait on the time &gt;&gt; because the vision shall surely come to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Elijah said, "Not even due or rain will fall till I call for it." He shut the heavens up. &gt;&gt; One man &gt;&gt; take a word and shut the heavens up. &gt;&gt; And when he felt time to come off rain, he tell the servants, "Go and look and tell me what you see." &gt;&gt; Because he felt in his spirit, "It's time for rain." &gt;&gt; Oh my. The servant run up, run up, run up and come and say, "I see nothing." He said, "Go seven times." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have to have something there. &gt;&gt; That is when you have vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have to have something here. On the seventh time the man see like a man hand. He said run &gt;&gt; all run. &gt;&gt; Look up no man hand run. &gt;&gt; The first sign you see you up and your fingers start to move. Shout all the other fingers going to move also. This is breakthrough time. This is deliverance time. Run for the Lord has given the city. Shout. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have more supernatural protection and help than you think. &gt;&gt; You have more supernatural assistance than you think. &gt;&gt; It's just because you're not seeing the other dimension. You can't see it. &gt;&gt; That come like Elijah and his servant steering army surround Gazi and surround Elijah and the man getting frightened frightened. Elijah had enough of it. Man complain look look at me. &gt;&gt; He said God open his boy eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; When the boy open the show, he said, "But there are more for us and against us." &gt;&gt; That's it, boy. &gt;&gt; That's it, boy. We always have more for us than who? Against us. &gt;&gt; You should be shouting on that one. &gt;&gt; Creator is he &gt;&gt; that's in you. &gt;&gt; That he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about external forces. We talking about internal forces. &gt;&gt; God put something inside of you. &gt;&gt; That word in you are power. That kingdom is the word turn into power. &gt;&gt; It may not turn into power yet, but it will turn into power. &gt;&gt; That power is always there. &gt;&gt; God put it as a seed that have to pip his way out to produce the miracle. That's what faith is. &gt;&gt; Faith is the seed to push his way out &gt;&gt; to produce the miracle. &gt;&gt; Do you want a miracle this morning? Let your faith go to work as that seed to produce that miracle. A miracle is coming your way. Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; I see we're going to wrap up here. Oh, praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my we trudging along so slowly today. &gt;&gt; Um page five of 19 pages. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The body of Christ is not an organization. The body of Christ, Jesus Christ, is the mystical body. It's a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's a spiritual kingdom that is set upon the earth by Jesus Christ being the king of this kingdom. The high priest to offer sacrifice for the wayfaring into the kingdom. He is prophet the word. He preaches the truth and bring the light of God in the kingdom. He is both prophet, priest and king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this kingdom. And how do we get into this kingdom? By denomination. by letter, by handshaking, but by one spirit. &gt;&gt; We are all baptized into one body which is the mystical body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We are baptized there not by water, not by sprinkling, not by pouring, not by any kind of water baptism, but by one spirit &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 12, we are baptized &gt;&gt; with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Are you ready for some more stuff? &gt;&gt; Could we give a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; I want you to shout because I don't want your eyes shut down on me. &gt;&gt; I want to get excited because we in the word now. &gt;&gt; We want to nail it down inside of there. When you leave, you must leave strong. &gt;&gt; You must hear the voice of God tell Joshua be strong. Please encourage us. &gt;&gt; Why would God tell Joshua that? Because you have devils to fight you never saw before. &gt;&gt; You have Hittites, Jebusite, Philistine, all kind of ice. &gt;&gt; So be strong. &gt;&gt; Very courageous. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So I'm talking about this bridge. I challenge a builder to build this bridge and he had to test all the material and so on and he got the best material and everything else. Listen to this part. When I think that God puts in his church the best that he can find. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I want to say church, I'm not talking about building. I'm not talking about this group here. I'm not talking about a particular church. I'm talking about the body. &gt;&gt; I wonder when when I hear church, I want you think about this bride buddy. Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. When I think that God puts in his church the best that he can find. Wow. God takes his children and test them with acid test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First time I bounce up this one. This one is a big one. This this is a big one. This is not just test. &gt;&gt; You see how quiet they come acid? &gt;&gt; Do not water test. &gt;&gt; Only don't raise your hands. All want water. Raise your hand. Don't raise your hand. I'm not saying only want acid test. I'm not saying that. I'm just reading this here now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God puts his church to in the best that he can find, God takes his children and tests them with a acid test. Then &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He places them into the body of Christ because they are tested. &gt;&gt; That's 30%. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the other 70%. acid test &gt;&gt; then placed &gt;&gt; into the body of Christ &gt;&gt; because they are tested. &gt;&gt; Let's take the example seat son Jesus holy ghost striking boom fullness of the godheaded bodily &gt;&gt; but he was led &gt;&gt; by the spirit &gt;&gt; into the wilderness &gt;&gt; to be tempted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus is dry in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, turn the stone into bread because we know we you're hungry. Devil know you hungry. &gt;&gt; What an offer. He had the power. If you feel the power, but he not authorized to obey the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he gives the devil it is written. &gt;&gt; Hold that word if you want. &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written. It is also written. &gt;&gt; When the devil sees going on in the word, devil going in the word too. &gt;&gt; Quoting scripture. He say it's also written. So you have to you have to know the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the Bible say Jesus returned in &gt;&gt; the power of the spirit &gt;&gt; and then he found the place where it is written cuz he had to take that power now and put it back in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Power here. Jesus tested go to the temple scriptures and say it's fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good as done &gt;&gt; because the anointing is here to manifest the scripture that I am placed to manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is finished. &gt;&gt; It is done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then he went about to do his stuff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So the bride have to come through her dynamics &gt;&gt; testing positionally placed. Go back to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get the anointing and go and do our stuff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because two seeds is about to release. &gt;&gt; The seed of the council of churches. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the seed of God the manifested son. &gt;&gt; Oh. About to be released upon the earth. The countdown is on. &gt;&gt; Every country getting in position. &gt;&gt; All the presidents coming in position. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We go there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were time tested. &gt;&gt; He said, "Okay, I'm going to go." &gt;&gt; Oh my. Acid test. &gt;&gt; When a man and woman is ready to take the test, the acid test. You see, they had to go in the fire. And when they did, they was in the fire. And the only thing that that taking place, the fiery test only unlocked the bands off their hands. Are you going? Are you ready? Hear this now. And many times God let us when we get all bound up with the world bound up he let the fiery test come upon us and where we have to make a decision. And when we do that the only thing the test can do when a real seed of Abraham is standing the crossroads of decision and he makes his decision to serve God. It can only cut the bands loose and make us free. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you are confronted with issues in your life, God will corner you to make a decision and based upon that decision because thou has chosen the fetterss and the things fall off for you. &gt;&gt; And you go free. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; He can only cut the bands loose and make us free. Satan might give you a disease. He might give you one thing or another. How you know it's not God you in your crossroads to see what kind of decision that you going to make? Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise his holy name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. So, was the eyes. Isn't that right? He said the next is the intelligence. And we have no intelligence of our own. We have no sight of our own. How can a man for see these things? It's becoming to a place he's governed the body all the way through. Then the complete here we go. Body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side. &gt;&gt; Amen. So his wife came out of his side and that is the body of Christ being revealed and you're going to begin to see it &gt;&gt; as it begin to unfold &gt;&gt; right in front of your eyes. So Abraham's election, Isaac justification, what Jacob grace and what Joseph affection placed. Oh hallelujah. For by one spirit, we are all placed into the body of Christ positionally. We have to get Have you tried it? Oh, praise God. Every man or woman here that's a Christian know there is something being upon your life that's God's election man can't take his land I have a healing service half he said when I go over there in the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ the trinity brethren say oh he is old Jesus only I can't go over there because I divine healing and that's divine healing is all right a lot of them enjoy miracles and the Lord and say well brother Brandham I believe you to be a prophet but let me tell you something as long as his praise is on him he's discerning he's the lord's servant but his teaching is rotten. It is no good. Who ever heard of such tummy rot? It's either of God or isn't God. It isn't is all God or non God. &gt;&gt; So how are you going to act? Manis won't keep his ground. Ephraim won't keep his ground. God won't keep his ground. Benjamin won't keep his ground. They're all running out there with the Philistines all mixed up. How are we going to get placed? &gt;&gt; But we have been born by the Holy Ghost. All of us. Is that right? We are born. Then after being born, we are predestinated into adoption to be placed into the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. That's the real church. Not mortar and brick and stone and so forth. But the real church is built upon the revelation of the word and the will of God. &gt;&gt; And that has been placed in the body since the Ephesians church all the way to the Laian age. So do you see the real church this morning? &gt;&gt; The church is you. You could reading your Bible, reading the scriptures, reading a spoken word book, and God begin revelation upon you. That's the church. That's the rock. Praise God. You don't even have to be in this building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You could be home and God give you revelation. That's the church. That's the rock. That's the power inside of you. Revelation is prevailing power. You need revelation. &gt;&gt; I want to say it again. You need revelation. &gt;&gt; Not just understanding. Revelation &gt;&gt; because revelation is an anchor. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So after Solomon dedicated the temple, after the building was completed, it was an empty building. There was nothing but furniture. He was about to dedicate this building for the worshippers to worship something. And without something there to worship, the building would be in vain. The building was ready for dedication. And when the Levites and the priest and thousands of trumpets blast the sky, the lamb after lamb dime, the Levites took up their position, the saraphims touching one another and so forth. Watch. And they picked it up from its tents and so on. And long came the watch. There was this uh they brought it to this resting place. This stone a huge stone placed set for it. And finally come to it resting place. And then it finally found rest in place. The shikina glory follow those capping stone. Not the cornerstone. The capp stone the main thing. All other stone was of none effect until this came. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So all the revelation will be on in none effect until the captain stone come and the captain stone come to put in effect every other stone. What is the use of the body without the head &gt;&gt; the head have to connect to the body and the head is the intelligence even the voice of the archangel to come upon a bride to mount a bride to ride a bride. We have been under the ministry of the word but our God has promised the ministry of the spirit to come upon a bride to anoint a bride. I'm not finished yet. So ride with me. Oh, give the Lord some shout in the house. Oh, glory to God. I don't care if you're tired. I'm not done yet. &gt;&gt; When I'm done, I'm going to be done. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. But there's a bride body that the Lord has to mount. You become a white horse and he become the white horse rider and he going to jump on you and ride it down to the resurrection. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All the other stones were of none effect until this then this main stone came in the headstone took its place positionally for it resting place for generation. The glory of God filled the place where they were sitting and there was a shikina glory in the whole building and the glory of God was so great till the priest could not even minister. &gt;&gt; What did the prophet say about the disciples? They were dry seeds hauling stuff in the upper room. They only had material. They only had mechanic. They only had revelation and they had the understanding open to the scriptures because Jesus did that in his resurrection ministry to give them clarity of the seven seas and seven thunders that they positionally placed to receive dynamics. All of a sudden they were in the upper room. All of a sudden there was a song from heaven as a rushing mighty wind as a kind of glory fill all the house. Oh glory to God. And they were staging in the upper room. They were like drunk men. Oh, this is that that the prophet William Brandon spoke of. This is that that the prophet Joyce spake of. Oh, hallelujah. All of a sudden, the dynamics came upon them and those dry seeds begin to grow, begin to spread. The quickening power, the word begin to turn dynamics. The word turn into spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh, give the Lord a shout. The spirit is here. &gt;&gt; The anointing is here. &gt;&gt; And we are not done yet because the glory is promised. &gt;&gt; He promised the glory &gt;&gt; of the latter house will be more powerful than the glory of the former house. You are that house this morning. You are the temple of the Holy Ghost. [Music] Don't want to fill you with that chicken glory. They're not for ministers only. That's for whosoever will. Come on. Come on. Come on. That's for the sons and daughters of God. You can leave him with the anointing. You can leave it with virtue power. &gt;&gt; You be seated as I was with Moses. Brother Brham and the church organization has failed &gt;&gt; and the message denomination organization how they nominate this message has failed. Seven timeation too. Seven seal denomination six six seals and so forth. The older certain denomination interpretation you have to believe it. So &gt;&gt; you have to believe it's so if you don't believe it's so talk and then what? &gt;&gt; I don't believe it's so they say I have to believe it's so you say no I not believe it's so. Then what you going to do? You punish me. &gt;&gt; You going to take my name out the book? &gt;&gt; Do something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just talk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can't put your name in. They putting him out. &gt;&gt; They just talk. &gt;&gt; What they don't understand is by one spirit. &gt;&gt; They're not controlling the spirit. They have a license in the spirit. God give them no legal right over the spirit. It's by one spirit. You are baptized into one body. Nobody can take power from you. Nobody can put you in power. The kingdom of God is preached and every man press their way into it. Do I hear a shouting? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't even know what time we finishing today. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Because I'm anointed to do this. I'm anointed to preach this. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you in the church triumphant? [Applause] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Feel like a samurai this morning. &gt;&gt; Sam them Japanese soldiers. You know, &gt;&gt; there be one man on me. You know, &gt;&gt; just one man on a sword, you know. &gt;&gt; Just lose them anywhere. &gt;&gt; They're just different. &gt;&gt; Who are you? Samurai. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Joshua was a samurai. &gt;&gt; Joshua was sharpening his sword. He wrestling sword. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Can you force against us? Samurai talk. Who are you? I was no higher sword ready. &gt;&gt; If it's enemy man, put away sword. I'm the captain. He said, "Oh, &gt;&gt; oho." Then you put back down your sword. Oho. Cuz only captain I do not do you know cuz I come to give you instruction how to take Jericho walls that's the intelligence how to deal with your situation [Applause] listen every situation every condition in your home in your life all around you there's intelligence to deal with it &gt;&gt; come on now say amen say amen say amen on your job in your home in your marriage in your life there's an intelligent to deal with it. So stop doing like if there is no intelligence. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You may not tap into it yet, but there is an intelligence behind it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; There was intelligence in Joseph going down in Egypt. &gt;&gt; There was intelligence in Joseph being in prison. &gt;&gt; There's intelligence behind that. He was in prison by chance because butler and baker got to be there because God know the butler going up to Pharaoh. So, so the butler must have a report of the kind of man Joseph is. &gt;&gt; So when the dream come send for Joseph &gt;&gt; and Joseph come prison to power because God want the brethren to come to me Joseph. &gt;&gt; And he had to be in power in Egypt where the pyramid is at. &gt;&gt; So God put the pyramid in Egypt and put Joseph in charge of the pyramid. You didn't hear what I'm saying inside of here &gt;&gt; because a cap coming on it. &gt;&gt; That's where you find Joseph. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You are not Jacob grace. &gt;&gt; You are truly perfection. &gt;&gt; There is nothing against you. I do scream in the house. There is nothing. You are the blood washed bride of Jesus Christ. There is one body, &gt;&gt; many members baptized into that body. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The church organization, &gt;&gt; has failed. &gt;&gt; Listen, they will not take the church over. That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, we know that &gt;&gt; God will raise up a new system, &gt;&gt; a denominational system by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Not by ministers and so-called fivefold, &gt;&gt; not that, but by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. The power of God. &gt;&gt; Not more talk. We had 40 years of that. &gt;&gt; So, we are looking for no more talk. &gt;&gt; In 400 years there was in Egypt. They want the next prophet. And I sure had somebody playing prophet before Moses come. &gt;&gt; But talking prophet now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say unto you, I say unto you, somebody has some cuckoo dream or some kind of thing like that. They see unto you because before Jesus come had bad Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't say somebody for run before the real thing come. &gt;&gt; So when Moses come now remember when Moses come, Moses have a record already. His track record he kill a man and run. &gt;&gt; So people know about that. I mean that is 40 years. So he have something against him already. Moses come with well excuse me I want to apologize Moses come with a talk he said just give you the word what's the word let my people go that's all &gt;&gt; it's not a complicated thing no no deep hidden mystery just just let them go you have a choice just let them go or I make you let them go &gt;&gt; he didn't want to let them go so if you don't want this sickness this disease is either you go or we make you go because we have authority by the word in my name we shall cast out devils we shall and lay hands upon the sick and it shall be covered. This is just the word. Y shout in the house. You have some serious thing to pray for after service. So I want your faith to be anointed. &gt;&gt; And when we begin to pray, we know God answered the prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; That's when a man come off of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; That man is fearless. That man, there's nothing against that man. That man is free. That man have nothing with critics on opinions of others. He just do what he has to do and get out. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And Moses, he, you know what he did? &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh had to let them go. &gt;&gt; God wanted more than that. God wanted to deal with Pharaoh armies. He wanted to strip Pharaoh of that army power. So God set up the Red Sea for him. Hallelujah. Praise God. God set up the journey, the whole journey, you know, because God tell Moses bring them down to this mountain. You think God has set up your journey? Your journey. God know the end from the beginning. You not hear what I'm saying? So your little trial you're going through right now, God, that little hump that you going to get over. Come on now. I'm Ille. &gt;&gt; I know things rough and tough. &gt;&gt; I wish I could help you. &gt;&gt; You be sincere. &gt;&gt; I wish you didn't have to go through. I wish I could escort you out of it. &gt;&gt; But then I'll get trouble with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can't come out. You have to go through. &gt;&gt; A lot of you want to come out here. I know that. But it's true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Red Sea. &gt;&gt; God know surfing thing on top of the Red Sea and you're surfing and things like that. &gt;&gt; You had to go through &gt;&gt; I know you could do with a surfboard and the breeze they taking you and you're surfing on top things. No, I know &gt;&gt; you would like that like they gliding through. You're holding the rope and power power boat just sliding across the Red Sea. But whenever they walking through and try to be loose, sorry, God don't have them kind of power thing. You get patience. You got to take your time. &gt;&gt; You will get there. &gt;&gt; Oh, 25 years for Abraham. &gt;&gt; 25 years for Abraham. 120 years for Noah. Two weeks and so in the upper room, God have time to wait to be patient. It teach you perfection. Waiting on God. Waiting for God. It give you faith. It give you character when you have to wait upon. My soul waited upon the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He is my rock. He's my refuge. He's my strong and mighty tower. Oh, glory to God. Here we go. Here we go. &gt;&gt; God will raise up an international system by the power of God that will take the church into the promised land. Organizations and denomination has messed it up. Each one after their own theology. Why people can't receive us as Christians? &gt;&gt; You're in this camp. You're in this group. You're teaching this. You're teaching this. Oh, Bar say, "How do you judge a man?" By how we stay with his word. How we stay with the word. &gt;&gt; How people judging me. &gt;&gt; Am I on the word or I'm off the word? If I'm off the word, show me. &gt;&gt; I ain't like what I see in your church. That's like the word. God is telling you to light this. What you see in your church, you come to see what you come to hear and receive and act upon what you're hearing. &gt;&gt; You don't know who's sitting next to you. It could be a saint or a sinner. You don't know. &gt;&gt; And I don't know. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All groups are three kind of believers, not some groups. &gt;&gt; You don't want to say amen. &gt;&gt; I would say amen. I'm a true believer. &gt;&gt; Could somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't teach that. What I'm for that is that unbeliever, make believe and true believer. &gt;&gt; So if you're a true believer, you say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; Cuz that is you. &gt;&gt; That that word is you. That attribute you connect to that what what you're hearing. &gt;&gt; So they me each one after their own theology. Each one after their own thinking. But God, here we go, will take his Holy Spirit and will raise up his Joshua &gt;&gt; that will take the church to the promise with no denominational strings tied anywhere. He will take the church over. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. He said, "Brother," he said, "Brother clergyman, could you mark this down?" Who's signing and crying? He said, "Now, brother, let's get back off to the off this territory. Let's come back to God. Come back to the altar. Rebuild the altar again that's been torn down and build up your home. Take them cards off the table. All them love magazines and open up the Bible. Read the Bible and pray and don't get down and say, "Bless my family, Mary, Jo, and John and all of them. Get in bed." No. Stay there with God. &gt;&gt; I'm about to wrap up on your home stretch here now. But the Bible says, we know the scripture says that Jesus is the chief cornerstone. He also is a headstone. And we will think for a few minutes that the seven church age messenger what was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. In other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit. So what we have seen for all these years is the power of the word and revelation. But there's a promise that the church going to be rebuilt under the power of the spirit. And that is what going to bring the faith. So it wouldn't be hard up and struggling and fighting. No, the spirit will be there present to answer your prayer to meet your need. Oh, you will see God answering your prayer. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; But I'm saying in other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit. Not by power, not by might, not by organization, but by my holy spirit will God bring forth the church in the last days. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. National force, but Israel in the homeland. National force will put the church in the work of the churches. But the power of God will put the people in the bride. Not some man, not some minister, but the power of God will put the people in the bride. The power of God will baptize them. Will put them in the body. Will put them into the bride body. Will put them into the church body. The real church, the true church of which Christ is the head. &gt;&gt; Could we give the Lord a shout in the house? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The world forces this way. The world forces that way. But God forces upward. The spirit of God. Here we go. Which is the word of God. &gt;&gt; My word is spirit and life. &gt;&gt; This is the problem. People don't want to take the word, but the word itself is spirit in word form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God can just flick the switch and the word turn to spirit. &gt;&gt; Because he say my words are spirit and my words are life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you want the life, you have to get the word &gt;&gt; because in the beginning was the word. The word is with God. The word was God. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So watch watch. The spirit of God which is the word of God. My word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place. She will recognize her position in the word. Then she's in Christ. &gt;&gt; Then she's in Christ. &gt;&gt; Therefore, you cannot say you're in Christ and you don't know your position in the word. That's why Jesus could find the place where it is written. He could go to Isaiah 61 and find the exact scripture that he could anoint. &gt;&gt; Then he have his position now. The spirit of God is upon me because he anointed me to bring good tidings, to set the captive free, to open up the blind eye. Jesus found the scripture. &gt;&gt; Then you are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Go through your land. &gt;&gt; See where your boundaries lie. See what God has given you. &gt;&gt; God has given you something, brother. &gt;&gt; God has given you something, sister. Don't let the devil lie to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It belongs to you. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The power of God will put the people in the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The father wanted the work done. He sent it to his son. The son wanted the work done. He sent it into his church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said the same power &gt;&gt; that rested in Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; rest in place sons &gt;&gt; in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Same power &gt;&gt; that was in Jesus &gt;&gt; going to rest on place sons. &gt;&gt; So what God is saying I'm going to place some sons. There is my spirit flowing freely. A son placed positionally in the body. Who's going to fight that? Devil can't challenge that. Joy prophesy of army being raised up. Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What the Bible said, the people that know their God shall be strong &gt;&gt; and do great exploits. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. I'm almost finished. Come on, please. The true church, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; the bride is so sold out to him &gt;&gt; and his promised word till the very mind that was in Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we find today that the modern church, the modern world church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnantated to give birth to sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One will produce a denominational birth that's going to give one day to the workings of churches and the other is pregnant by the word of God will bring forth. Are we ready? Hallelujah. will bring forth the body &gt;&gt; the finished body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; which is the bride &gt;&gt; the body of Christ isn't finished yet &gt;&gt; that's why Baram says when that last name is called maybe in Africa the door is shut &gt;&gt; I'm reading I'm reading watch the other is pregnant by the word of God will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet. How many knows that a man and woman is one? And Christ is one body, the word, and the bride will have to be the rest of the body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Christ is not complete without his wife. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; You hear that? &gt;&gt; Christ is complete with the body &gt;&gt; because he is the head of the body &gt;&gt; which is the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Christ is the head of this Messiah kingdom. And you cannot organize a kingdom in which Christ is the head. Oh praise God. Praise God. The real church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ. And God sent back the Holy Ghost to make up this mystical body of Christ which will be united by the marriage of the lamb. Oh praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I want to get us close to this one. We stand justified in Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just forgiven. &gt;&gt; Justified. &gt;&gt; Justified. &gt;&gt; Justified as if it never did. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know that has strike many of you yet because you need a revelation of that. &gt;&gt; But listen to this part I want to get to. &gt;&gt; We stand justified in Christ because he cannot pass judgment for he already judged that body in which I'm part of. There is therefore now no condemnation &gt;&gt; to them who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. Let all standal going to sing a little bit. I'm going to be here because I want to take this prayer request afterwards and we're going to worship a little bit by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen.

What an anointing. What a word in due season. My my. And that message was preached in 2017. And it feels like it was just right on time for today. speaking to us for what God wanted us to hear today. Can we give the Lord one more hand of praise? Amen. We do have a prayer request from Sister Juliet. I'm requesting prayer for a lady by the name of Rosie who was who has given birth to a baby girl. Both the mother and the baby have an infection and prayer is required for their healing and their salvation. And if there's anyone in the house this morning with a request that you want to show by raising your hands as we approach the throne of God on the foundation of faith that lays in this message in the holy scriptures and that we heard preached to us this morning the uncarchable riches of God. We see those hands raised and even you who are at home and you're connected online. The great physician is here this morning. And at the end of that service, Beloved was preparing to pray. And the atmosphere was right for deliverance, for healing, for restoration, and for breakthrough. And I don't know what your need is this morning, but he is still God. He is still the great physician. And we have many needs in the church, many needs among the body of believers. There are many that are sick and afflicted, many dealing with issues and storms that they have not even communicated or even articulated. But God sees it all this morning. And he sees every hand. So as we approach the throne of grace this morning, knowing that there's no hard case. Let's bow our heads and bow our hearts. Heavenly Father, we thank you this morning that you are still the great physician and you are still more than able to take every request. Lord, you said we have not because we ask not because when we ask we ask a miss father Lord by the driven by the own lust of our heart. But this morning we come with a noble request based on the foundation and the word that healing is the children's bread. Father, Lord, knowing that you already paid the price for our healing, Father, Lord, and by the confession of our faith, we could stand and rest comfortably on the sanctuary of the word, Lord, that it is possible that the impossible could be made possible. Lord, we bring this condition, Lord, of Rosi who has given birth, Lord, and both she and the baby have an infection. That baby fresh from the presence of God. You said when a mother gives birth, there's a sweet spirit comes over that mother. It doesn't matter what her past was, what her situation was because that life is coming fresh from the presence of God. Father, we pray dear God that the angel of the Lord will visit both the mother and the baby and that infection will be completely dissolved, completely removed. Satan, we take your authority away by the power of God that rest in the church of the living God. Satan, take your hands off of that mother and that baby in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Father and heavenly father, for every request, Lord, for every hand that was raised, my hand raised also, Father God, you know, every need, every situation, Lord, every attack that your people are going through, may you send healing to your children. May you send peace to your children. May you send comfort to your children. May you send confidence and assurance. You said be bold and very courageous, Father. So Lord, may you strengthen your people. May you touch our pastor this morning in a precious way in a mighty name of Jesus Christ from the crown of his head to the soul of his feet. Touch his wife, touch the ministers, touch the elders, touch the deacons, trust the touch the ushers, the trustees, the musicians, the technicians, the helps and the governments. Father, may you bless your people as we prepare to leave from your house but not from your presence. May you grant us traveling mercies. May you bless the rest of this day that we dedicate to you. This is the Lord's day. It's a beautiful day. It's a wonderful day, Lord, to take us apart from the hustle and the bustle of life. Father, we will continue after we leave this service to give you glory, to give you praise, to give you thanksgiving, and we pledge to serve you all the days of our lives. May you bless our going out. May you bless our coming in. We ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated for a few announcements. Can we give the Lord one more hand of praise? Glory. [Applause] Amen. This morning we like to welcome Charlene Rivas. This she's invited by Sister Marlene Pikton. That's her daughter, I believe. God bless you. Welcome to Headstone Tabernacle. Certainly a great privilege to have you here with us this morning. My what a time we're living in, church. What a season we're living in. How many were blessed by the meetings by brother Norris last Wednesday, last Thursday and then last Friday? And I really want to salute the church. I really want to salute brother Norris for the burden, for the inspiration to have the meetings. We need more of these. &gt;&gt; We need more of these and we are under great expectation for more of these to take place. And there were so many nuggets that were shared in the service and saint to brother you were speaking this morning about the different administrations of that same Holy Spirit. And that's what we saw that meeting Wednesday night, Thursday night and by the grace of God Friday night we saw different gifts operating by the same Holy Spirit having an impact on the people of God. So we pray that God would bless the Norris and the church there in Princess Town. It was such a wonderful privilege to be able to be there and to see the different brethren and the believers and the ministers who spoke as well. And I really want to thank you who connected online and those who made it down to the service on Friday. I salute you. We felt the fire. We felt the the praises, the shouts. We salute you for the effort and uh I want to especially salute sister Deborah. Bless sister Dborah and I think sister Keela. I think I you you they were in all of the services. So that's a special grace, a special strength. You know, it took a a a a great effort depending where you came from. I was also there physically for all the services and it was a blessing. You know, we got home 1 in the morning, 2:00 in the morning with a punch. We are blending from time into eternity. But Harry says convention, what is the extra hour? Where's the extra two hours? You know, and I say when you there comes a season as you start to come to church, time start to fade. When you come to church on Sunday, this is the Lord's day. You shouldn't be thinking about rushing back home. You come to enjoy the presence of the Lord. Enjoy the presence of the saints. You can't wait to see your bedroom because when you get over there is a eternal fellowship in &gt;&gt; the atmosphere was so sweet that the people didn't want to leave. &gt;&gt; By the last service, people didn't want to leave. And it was just as a time as we preached on Friday where Jesus had to tell people, "Go back home now because the atmosphere is so sweet." And they'll come a service friend. It will be so sweet we'll fade right into eternity to be able to now fellowship beyond who we see to to fellowship with David and fellowship with Noah and fellowship with Moses and fellowship with all those through the ages that form this great picture that God has placed and painted from Genesis to Revelation and the church say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh and uh today as well, Sister Seline, would you stand? God bless you. Sister Seline S. Bryce has chosen to make this church her home church. So, Sister Seline, welcome home. We are happy to have you church. Be sure to give her the right hand of fellowship. We love you and we are happy to have you a part of this fellowship by the grace of God. And may God continue to strengthen you as you continue to serve him with all that you have. Amen. And I also want to solicit your prayers. Uh this week by the grace of God I'll be traveling to France to minister this weekend in brother Jano's youth convention. He's having a youth retreat and by the grace of God I'll be speaking there in France uh this weekend. So remember me in prayer that God would continue to strengthen and bless and see God's people blessed because that's our only motive and objective as brother preaches one body. There are there's a portion of it here in Trinidad. There's a portion all through the islands, through the Americas, through Europe, through Africa and and it's one body, one head of that body. We are all part I might just be a little small to you, you might just be but we are all part of the body. And when Christ takes leadership of that body, then you respond for duty wherever that duty calls. So I want you to be so ready that wherever there's a next meeting, we say the meeting is in princess tongue. Now it's over here. Now it's over there all over the world. Once the cloud moves, we moving. Hallelujah. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; It's such an exciting time. &gt;&gt; My my my &gt;&gt; wonderful. I just want to make sure I don't forget anything. Okay, great. So, service continues this coming Wednesday here at the tabernacle. And I want to encourage you, especially those who are on holidays from school. I want to encourage you. And for those of you who have made different types of excuses to not be here on a Wednesday night, some years ago, I preached a message, no excuses. I feel I need to preach it again. But I want to encourage you if you could be here on Wednesday night, be here on Wednesday night. I believe in my heart, God has a special blessing in store this coming Wednesday. And I believe every Wednesday night is a special anointing when you make that sacrifice to be in the house of God on Wednesday. So I want to encourage church, make an extra effort. I know with every extra effort that Bedova preached last week, you got to get started for God to do the rest. Get started this week. So I want to encourage you this coming Wednesday, make an effort to be here at 8:00 p.m. If you really have a good excuse, still make an effort. I know your t is going to say connect online but if you really have a good excuse still make a good effort to be here on Wednesday night by the grace of God this coming Friday we will have prayer meeting online be sure to connect and I want to charge the parents it is your responsibility you know yesterday I was meditating and you know some of you just have to take notes because if you don't write it down you'll forget it and I wrote I want to speak on responsibility and accountability it's two different things because you as a parent have a responsibility but there's also an accountability aspect because you have to give an account. So when there's an online service you can't do as if nothing is happening. You have a responsibility in your home to create the atmosphere to place priority on the moving of the spirit to create the prayer meeting in your home. There's a altar that's supposed to be in your home and it's because many of the families have broken issues. Because we see the issues translate into life into the church into the schools because the parents themselves have not created the environment and also put the foot down on what should be. In the old days the parents would say a car wear that in this house. If you want to wear that get your own roof. &gt;&gt; Anybody in the house &gt;&gt; it is either it's right or it's wrong. The Bible said children will be your oppressors. I scripture you have to decide if that is in your house &gt;&gt; because that doesn't speak to the bride because the bride cutter from a different cloth because the children of the bride because what's revealed to us belongs to us and to our children. It's a behavior that we are responsible for. Train up a child in the way that they should go. That's a responsibility. There's an accountability that comes from that. So I want to encourage you don't underestimate or diminish when we have an online service or a zoom service. It is your responsibility to create an atmosphere in your home so that the young children have a level of respect to the service. And that applies even into the house of God. &gt;&gt; As a 5-year-old, I was sharing with my wife. I remember the service in Shagaramas in ' 87. I was 6 years old sitting down in the house of God. not running on playing downstairs and it's play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play after service but while the service is going on there was a level of respect and a sensitivity that the word of God is being spoken so these are the things that we have to address and make clear so that you understand you want as for me and my house we will serve the lord can the church say amen so this coming Wednesday service at 8 this coming Friday zoom prayer meeting and service continues this coming Sunday by the grace of God. I want to also remind you that on the 31st of August, which is an independence day, it's a holiday and it will extend of course because it falls on a Sunday to the Monday is a public holiday. That will be a special service. On that service, we have a few things happening. We want to pray for everyone who's going back out to school. If there's a place in this hour where our young people are being attacked, it's in the school system. Whether it's university, whether it's preschool, primary school, secondary school, they are being hit every day. Sometime it's teachers teaching them all kind of crazy things. It's the friends, it's the peer pressure. It's a nesting place for all kinds of stuff. So we want to pray for our children that's going back out to school at every single level. We also want to celebrate those that are graduating from the various Sunday school levels. We have a few as well. And on that very day, Brother has decided to have a special meal for the entire church as a special thanksgiving service. So, we are looking to see every member of the church here on that day because a thanksgiving service is a celebration service and we want to put our shoulders to the wheel uh to create an atmosphere that our young people could be fortified to go into this new school year differently. Do we appreciate that? &gt;&gt; Are we looking forward for that? Are you going to pray for one another? Are you going to pray for the ministry? Are you going to keep your swords drawn? Are you going to be in the word? Are you going to play the tapes at home? Are you going to read your Bible every day? That's how you go. Read your Bible and pray every day and you'll grow, grow, grow. Last and certainly not least, maintainance group four. Please meet with brother Marlon Alexander after the service. And next week, Lord willing, group two is carded to serve. May the Lord richly bless you, brother Steven. [Music] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise one more time. Glory, glory, glory, glory.
