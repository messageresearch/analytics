[4:34] [Music]
[4:39] I
[4:41] say let's bow our heads. Father God, we
[4:43] thank you. We say yes to your will. Yes
[4:46] to your word. Thy will be done on earth
[4:49] as it is in heaven. Father God, may you
[4:52] send grace upon every soul here tonight.
[4:55] And those that would hear this message,
[4:57] speak to our hearts, and transform our
[4:59] lives. We say yes to your word, to your
[5:02] truth in these difficult times. Guide us
[5:05] by your word, great Jehovah. May the
[5:07] fire of God go before us. The dove come
[5:09] and lead the eagles this evening. In
[5:12] Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And amen. We
[5:15] have one scripture this evening from St.
[5:17] John chapter 1 from verse 29 to 33. I
[5:21] want to go straight to the word of God
[5:23] this evening.
[5:34] St. John chapter 1 verse 29 we
[5:38] read the next day John seeth Jesus
[5:41] coming unto him and saith behold the
[5:44] lamb of God which take away the sin of
[5:46] the world.
[5:48] This is he of whom I said after me,
[5:52] cometh a man which is preferred before
[5:55] me, for he was before me, and I knew him
[5:59] not, but that he should be made manifest
[6:01] to Israel. Therefore am I come baptiz
[6:05] him with water. And
[6:08] John bare record saying, I saw the
[6:12] Spirit descending from heaven like a
[6:15] dove, and it abodeed upon him, and I
[6:19] knew him not, but he that sent me to
[6:22] baptize with water. The same said unto
[6:25] me, upon whom thou shalt see, the spirit
[6:31] descending, and remaining on him, the
[6:36] same is he which baptizeth with the Holy
[6:40] Ghost. May God add bless the blessing of
[6:42] the reading of his word. Father, we pray
[6:44] that you would take this word and take
[6:46] like an arrow and drive it straight into
[6:48] our hearts. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[6:51] You may be seated.
[6:53] I like that description that John have
[6:56] here in verse
[6:57] 33. Upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[7:03] descending and
[7:06] remaining on him, the same is he which
[7:09] baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. So what's
[7:12] he's also saying? The spirit could
[7:14] descend and not remain. But you want the
[7:17] spirit to descend
[7:19] and remain. Amen. So this evening I have
[7:22] a
[7:24] title, the lamb and the
[7:26] dove and I have an
[7:28] inspiration dove leading eagle. Oh
[7:33] blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise
[7:36] God. Give the Lord some praises.
[7:38] Hallelujah.
[7:41] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you
[7:44] Jesus. Hallelujah. Praise God. The dove.
[7:47] Amen. Amen. To lead the eagles. Not some
[7:51] man to lead the eagles, the dove to lead
[7:54] the eagles. Hallelujah. God promised
[7:57] eagles in the last days. Amen.
[7:59] Hallelujah. Eagles that could gather
[8:02] together. Eagles that could soar. Isn't
[8:05] that right? Eagles that have built-in
[8:08] things in them to overcome to fly into
[8:10] the storm. So, I want to share some
[8:12] things from the message of the same
[8:15] title, Lamb of and Dove. And and and I
[8:17] read this scripture this morning.
[8:18] Remember the former things of old. For I
[8:21] am God and there is none else. I am God
[8:23] and there is none like me. Declaring the
[8:25] end from the beginning and from ancient
[8:28] times the things that are not yet done,
[8:31] saying, "My counsel shall stand and I
[8:34] will do all my pleasure." Hallelujah.
[8:37] And I love that that God could declare
[8:40] the end from the beginning. So he
[8:43] doesn't have to wait for everything to
[8:44] unfold. He could speak a word and that
[8:48] word is yet to be but you believe it and
[8:51] that's faith it's the substance of what
[8:53] you're hoping for. He could speak a word
[8:56] of your life 10 years from now to come
[8:58] and that can't fail because whatever God
[9:01] said got to come to pass. It got to it's
[9:03] truth. Isn't that right? It can't fail.
[9:06] Like I think one time in the prayer line
[9:07] a discernment uh but a man was calling
[9:09] out a woman and say you live in such and
[9:11] such a place and such and such a place
[9:12] and a friend was nearby say but she not
[9:14] living there. I know and what not and
[9:16] she was doubting and afterwards when the
[9:18] whole thing get exposed she say hey I
[9:20] forget to tell you I move out last week.
[9:22] Praise God. So she thought the rumor was
[9:24] lying. It wasn't true. But God word
[9:26] can't fail. God knows all things. So you
[9:30] are challenged to lift your faith up and
[9:32] trust God and watch the devil and laugh
[9:34] in his face because God counsel will
[9:37] stand. I'm not hearing you this evening.
[9:40] Glory to God. He said, "My counsel shall
[9:43] stand and I shall do all my pleasure."
[9:47] Oh, glory. Please God to pour his spirit
[9:50] upon you. That's why he said this is my
[9:52] beloved son in whom I am well pleased to
[9:55] dwell in. Oh glory to God. John didn't
[9:58] know who it was. All he know God tell
[10:00] him a sign. The one upon whom you see
[10:02] the spirit descending and remaining.
[10:05] That's the one to identify. Oh glory to
[10:08] God. That mean the spirit have to come
[10:10] down. Nobody could stop it because the
[10:12] spirit is promised in the last days. It
[10:15] shall come to pass afterwards. I will
[10:17] pour out my spirit. Young men shall see
[10:20] visions. Old men shall dream dreams upon
[10:23] my handmaidaidens. I will pour out my
[10:26] spirit in the last days. No demon could
[10:30] stop it. The little hell has been
[10:32] uncovered and that can't even stop it.
[10:35] Filthy demons can't stop it. I don't
[10:37] care what the devil put out there. God's
[10:40] purpose and counsel must stand. We
[10:43] letting the devil know that today. I
[10:45] don't care what happened in your life in
[10:46] the times past. He has declared the end
[10:50] from the beginning. Oh, give the Lord a
[10:52] shout. Praise God. Where was thou when I
[10:56] laid the foundation of the earth and the
[10:58] mornings I sang together and the son of
[11:00] God shouted for joy. You didn't have
[11:02] depression back there. You wasn't
[11:04] struggling to pay your bills back there.
[11:06] No, you were having a great time when
[11:09] you saw the cap coming on the pyramid.
[11:11] Isn't that right? You were shouting. You
[11:13] were praising God. You wasn't teary eyed
[11:16] and depressed and fed up and want to
[11:18] give up and you can't take it no more.
[11:20] You wasn't talking like that. You were
[11:22] shouting and praising God because you
[11:25] were back there before. We here to
[11:27] remind you where you come from. We here
[11:30] to tell you where you're going and the
[11:32] devil have no part with you because he
[11:34] came in the beginning but you were
[11:37] before the beginning. That's why we are
[11:39] here this evening. That's why the spirit
[11:41] had to find Jesus because Jesus was a
[11:43] son. He was a born son. He was a
[11:46] predestinated son. And the spirit had to
[11:49] find him at the appointed time. And when
[11:52] his time came, nothing could stop it.
[11:54] The Pharisees couldn't stop it. The
[11:56] Sadducees couldn't stop it. The spirit
[11:59] of God descended upon him. And John saw
[12:02] it. He said, "The spirit of Jesus is
[12:05] upon me because he had anointed me." And
[12:08] if Jesus had to be anointed, you have
[12:11] got to be anointed. Give the Lord a
[12:14] shout of praise. Therefore, you are here
[12:17] today to receive the anointing of the
[12:20] Holy Ghost. Oh, hallelujah.
[12:26] Oh, glory to God. Fight for it. Press
[12:29] for it. Amen. Claim it. Act upon it. You
[12:33] are here to receive something from the
[12:36] Lord. Oh, glory to God. Do you
[12:38] understand what is happening? The spirit
[12:40] have to come upon you. It has to come
[12:43] and remain. It has to come and stay. It
[12:47] have to come and abide. It can't come on
[12:50] a wolf. It can't come on a snake. It
[12:53] can't come on bad behavior. But the dove
[12:55] will come to the lamb. It's the dove and
[12:58] the lamb. Oh, glory to God. Give the
[13:00] Lord a shout of praise.
[13:06] be seated. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah.
[13:09] Though I know all mysteries, seven
[13:11] thunder, seven seals, mystery inside,
[13:13] out on the backside, front side, left
[13:15] side, right side, all the sides it have,
[13:17] hidden, unhidden, all kind of mysteries,
[13:19] trumpet, fires, plague, woes, whatever.
[13:21] You name 304, seven thunder, seven seas,
[13:25] any mystery you could think about. Do I
[13:27] know all of that and have no charity?
[13:29] Still nothing. Still wasting time. Zero
[13:32] not ne nada nothing. Oh glory to God.
[13:35] Though I give my body to be burned,
[13:36] still not neither nothing. Charity
[13:38] suffered long as it can. Charity faulted
[13:41] at itself. Is not easily provoked. It
[13:44] beareth all things. It believeth all
[13:46] things. It hope all things. It enjoyed
[13:49] all things. Charity never failth. Oh,
[13:52] glory to God. Hallelujah. We want that
[13:56] robe of love. We want that power that
[13:59] the devil cannot touch. He can
[14:00] impersonate every gift. But he cannot
[14:02] impersonate the love of God. How rich,
[14:05] how pure, how measurless and strong. It
[14:08] shall forever more endure. The saints an
[14:11] angel song or give the Lord a shout of
[14:14] praise. Nothing could stop it. Nothing
[14:16] could hinder it. Nothing could conquer
[14:19] it. It can't fail. It never failth. Oh,
[14:23] give the Lord some praises even upon
[14:26] whom you see your spirit descending.
[14:28] Hallelujah. and remaining.
[14:31] [Applause]
[14:32] [Music]
[14:37] Glory.
[14:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[14:42] Hallelujah. Oh, this is good. I call
[14:45] this applied Christianity. I'm not
[14:47] talking about the regular come to church
[14:49] Christianity. I'm talking about what you
[14:51] can apply to attract that dove to come
[14:54] to you because it's what you do going to
[14:56] bring that dove to you. is your behavior
[14:59] will determine whether that dove will be
[15:02] attracted to you. You and that dove must
[15:04] lock eyes. You must d have sweet eye.
[15:07] That dove have to cool. That dove has to
[15:09] brood. That do have to come and hold
[15:11] over. When the crosses darkness was upon
[15:14] the deep and the spirit of God move upon
[15:17] the face of the water. The spirit of God
[15:20] was like a dove. It was brooding over
[15:22] the trouble waters. And when the spirit
[15:25] begin to move, then God said, "Let there
[15:29] be light." When the spirit begins to
[15:32] move, you can look out for the voice of
[15:34] God. We are here to create atmosphere.
[15:37] We are here to create atmosphere.
[15:40] Atmosphere already here upon whom you
[15:44] see the spirit descending and remaining.
[15:47] That's the one that going to baptize you
[15:50] with the Holy Ghost and with fire. Well,
[15:53] give the Lord a shout. Oh, I feel
[15:56] energized this evening. I feel empowered
[15:59] this
[16:01] evening.
[16:03] [Applause]
[16:03] [Music]
[16:04] [Applause]
[16:08] Hallelujah. Oh,
[16:11] glory. Oh,
[16:14] glory.
[16:15] Glory.
[16:17] My God.
[16:20] My
[16:21] my
[16:24] you will be seasoned. Look at the drama.
[16:26] All right. 400 years. Saties. All right.
[16:30] It seems scribes. I know the tracks.
[16:33] Praise God. I know their books playing
[16:36] their tapes. This one of this doctrine.
[16:38] That one of that doctrine. Humans.
[16:42] Hallelujah. Natural people. None of them
[16:45] hearing from God. They under rituals,
[16:48] historical rituals. They under the
[16:51] tradition of the elders who was there
[16:53] for donkey years. All they know is what
[16:56] the elders did and what the elders did
[16:58] before that. The first man to interrupt
[17:00] them was a word message from John the
[17:03] Baptist. A rugged man with the name
[17:06] Eleaza or Ezekiel or any kind of strange
[17:08] name. His name was John. A wilderness
[17:11] man called aside by God eaten wild ocas
[17:15] and honey. come out the wilderness
[17:17] because he had to pick up the scripture.
[17:19] The voice of one cry in the wilderness.
[17:22] Not no manifestation. Just a voice. A
[17:25] voice. No signs, no wonders, no
[17:29] miracles. Just the ministry of the word.
[17:32] Just a voice saying fire is coming.
[17:35] Power is coming. Dynamics is coming.
[17:38] Just the spirit of prophecy upon John
[17:41] the Baptist. Oh hallelujah. No miracles,
[17:45] no signs, no decoration of power. And he
[17:48] said there is one standing among you
[17:50] whom you know not. He is going to do
[17:53] something special. He's going to burn.
[17:55] Fire going to come out his mouth. Fire
[17:58] going to come. Fire. That's what we here
[18:01] for. That's what we here for this
[18:03] evening. For the fire of God. Oh
[18:06] hallelujah.
[18:08] Oh glory to God. Oh hallelujah. Blessed
[18:12] be the name of the Lord. This council
[18:14] going to stand. God declared the end
[18:16] from the beginning. So if God declare
[18:18] your adoption, who's going to stop it?
[18:21] God told Joshua that land is to be
[18:23] conquered. Now watch Joshua had go
[18:25] through the process yet. But God tell
[18:27] him the end from the beginning. He said
[18:30] all the land from Gishi to here. All of
[18:34] that shall be your coast. No man shall
[18:38] be able to stand before thee all the
[18:40] days of thy life. He's given him the
[18:43] end. He's given him the target. He's
[18:45] given him what he's going after. Don't
[18:48] short yourself. You are going to be a
[18:50] Christian. Come on now. Don't short
[18:53] yourself.
[18:54] [Applause]
[19:00] The enemy trying to take my voice, but
[19:03] forget about it. You try to short
[19:05] yourself. We come out to go in. You may
[19:08] be seated. I come out to go in. We're
[19:11] going to get fight with the world. Of
[19:12] course, the world will give us a fight.
[19:14] The devil must fight you. You're going
[19:15] to get fight with lust of the eyes.
[19:17] You'll get fight with lust of the flesh.
[19:18] You'll get fight with the pride of life.
[19:20] You must get fight. If you're not
[19:22] getting fight, something is wrong with
[19:23] you. It means you get beat up already.
[19:26] It means you have no more licks to get.
[19:28] It means you on the floor. But if you're
[19:30] fighting, keep on fighting. It's got to
[19:33] be a fight. Come on, say amen, somebody.
[19:37] Oh, glory to God.
[19:40] If the devil is not troubling you, he
[19:42] have you.
[19:46] I'm not hearing you. If the devil is not
[19:49] troubling you, he have you in his
[19:51] prison. He's hand food now and again.
[19:54] But if the devil is troubling you, he's
[19:56] worried about you because he don't know
[19:58] who you are. He don't know whose you
[20:00] are. He don't know where you come from
[20:03] and he don't know where you're going.
[20:06] But you come from God and you are going
[20:09] back to God.
[20:11] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[20:16] The fire is in the building. Yeah. The
[20:19] power is in the building. Oh yes. Oh
[20:24] yes. Oh yes. The spirit is here for
[20:29] deliverance. The spirit is here for a
[20:32] breakthrough.
[20:34] Oh, glory to God.
[20:37] Hallelujah.
[20:38] Hallelujah.
[20:40] Hallelujah. Glory to God. The spirit of
[20:43] God is here. Oh, glory to God.
[20:46] Deliverance time is now. Oh yes. Yes.
[20:50] Breakthrough time is now. Victory time
[20:54] is
[20:57] now. Hallelujah. Glory.
[21:01] Glory. Glory.
[21:04] Open your mouth and shout. Open your
[21:07] mouth and praise your God. Open your
[21:09] mouth and worship.
[21:11] [Applause]
[21:23] [Music]
[21:27] [Applause]
[21:30] You may be seated. So listen to this.
[21:32] Amen. All of a sudden, Amen. people
[21:35] getting convicted. By the voice of the
[21:38] word, through John. All right. He said,
[21:40] "Repent." Hallelujah. He said, "Bring
[21:42] forth fruit. Meet unto repentance." And
[21:45] all you seen is a natural progression of
[21:48] humans being baptized in water. But this
[21:51] day was different. This day, John didn't
[21:53] see a human. This day, John saw a dove.
[21:57] He saw the spirit descending.
[22:01] They never saw that before. This was the
[22:04] first time they saw the spirit
[22:07] descending as a dove upon the lamb. Oh,
[22:12] glory to God. Hallelujah. That's why
[22:16] John could say,
[22:18] "Behold the lamb of
[22:20] God."
[22:22] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. And once
[22:25] the dove comes among us, it come to
[22:29] lead. Come on now. And as many as are
[22:34] led by the spirit, they
[22:38] [Applause]
[22:43] are glory. As many as are led by the
[22:50] spirit, they are the sons of God. Oh,
[22:56] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[23:00] glory to God. Hallelujah. So all these
[23:03] years, my Jesus, those seven virtues
[23:07] were supposed to make bring us to be
[23:10] lamblike. All the virtues was to teach
[23:14] us how to get out of the way. All those
[23:19] virtues was to bring us to a place where
[23:22] our spirit is broken, where we lost our
[23:25] own will, our own choices, and our own
[23:28] way. where we surrender totally and
[23:32] completely that we can be led by the
[23:36] spirit into the wilderness where he
[23:40] leads me there. I'm going to follow. Oh,
[23:44] glory to God. Hallelujah.
[23:47] The dove can't come on arrogance. You
[23:51] may be seated. The dove can't come on
[23:53] pride. The dove can't come on hostile
[23:57] ministers, evil people, angry, hateful
[24:01] people. There is a requirement for the
[24:04] dove to land. The dove could hover over,
[24:07] but he's not going to rest until Oh my
[24:12] god, I wish I had the voice that the
[24:15] dove he is flying over, but he want to
[24:18] rest. He want to descend and remain.
[24:27] Woo!
[24:30] Amen. Hallelujah. You may be seated,
[24:33] Jesus.
[24:35] Come on now. Come on now.
[24:39] Glory. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise
[24:41] God. Hallelujah.
[24:43] I heard of somebody say fame and fortune
[24:46] could get you through the front door,
[24:48] but it's character to keep you on the
[24:50] stage. Yes. personality and superfluity
[24:54] and all your ways can get you to to meet
[24:57] people and greet people and see people.
[24:59] But if you don't have character, you're
[25:02] going to fade after a while. That dove
[25:06] is looking to land all over the world.
[25:09] That dove is flying across this message
[25:13] all over the world. They could believe
[25:16] this. They could believe that. It
[25:18] doesn't matter what they believe is
[25:21] whether or not the runway is prepared
[25:24] for the landing of the dove. And if the
[25:27] dove has seen no place to land, he is
[25:30] not landing. Praise God. This is not Air
[25:33] Force One. This is dove one. This is the
[25:36] same dove that that came upon Jesus must
[25:40] come upon
[25:42] sons to be born in the last days. Jesus
[25:46] was our example, see son. And if the
[25:50] spirit came upon him, that spirit come
[25:53] upon you also. Notice, notice. Let me
[25:57] read a little thing here. You will be
[25:59] seated. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[26:02] God. It's a short service this evening,
[26:05] but I know it'll be inspiring to you.
[26:07] You will understand all the mysteries.
[26:10] You heard me read it already. But pray a
[26:12] prayer that the mysteries be revealed
[26:15] that we may know how to conduct
[26:17] ourselves and behave ourselves. What is
[26:20] he talking about? All the mysteries you
[26:23] see divine revelation makes you humble
[26:26] because you didn't give yourself you
[26:28] didn't study it is the Lord himself.
[26:31] Flesh and blood had not revealed it unto
[26:34] you. But my father in heaven when you
[26:37] understand the grace and sovereignity of
[26:40] God has revealed his love to you. You
[26:43] can't boast. You can't brag. You can't
[26:45] feel you better than somebody else. It's
[26:48] the grace of God that you are who you
[26:51] are. That you have the ability to hear
[26:54] direct from God. Just to hear. Oh, you
[26:59] could shout about that. Many people
[27:01] would love to hear the voice of God. But
[27:05] you heard it. We are hearing it. We
[27:08] heard it in the last days. The voice of
[27:10] God. And it has the ability to make us
[27:13] act upon what we hear. You see, if you
[27:16] don't act, you haven't heard it. But
[27:18] when you hear it, you got to act upon
[27:21] it. A man have never heard the voice of
[27:23] God and not act on it. Once you hear
[27:27] God's voice, something got to move you.
[27:30] Something got to stir you. Something got
[27:32] to fire you. Daniel said those prophets
[27:36] said it's like fire lock up in my bones.
[27:40] Oh hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Oh glory
[27:44] to God. How many looking for a
[27:46] transformation? How many looking for a
[27:48] change? You come in here like a pig and
[27:51] you're going to walk out here a lamb.
[27:53] Give the Lord a shout of praise. You
[27:55] heard what I said. You come in here like
[27:58] a pig, but you're going to leave a lamb.
[28:01] That is what the gospel was given for.
[28:05] Oh,
[28:06] hallelujah. Oh, glory. Oh,
[28:10] hallelujah. Oh,
[28:12] hallelujah.
[28:13] Hallelujah. My God. My God. Oh, glory.
[28:18] Let me read something. Brother Brandon,
[28:20] you may be seated. It's a strange thing
[28:23] to think that when God chose to
[28:27] represent the sun on earth, he
[28:29] represented him in a creature called a
[28:31] lamb. And many times we might wonder why
[28:35] he was called a lamb. A lamb is the
[28:39] meakest of all creatures of the earth.
[28:41] There is nothing no meaker than a lamb.
[28:45] And the Orthodox Church knew they had to
[28:47] offer up a lamb as a substitute for sin,
[28:50] knowing that God had passed the penalty
[28:52] of death and something must die. And the
[28:56] life was in the blood and the life was
[28:58] in Jesus Christ. And he was the lamb of
[29:01] God. And the Virgin Mary was
[29:03] overshadowed by the Holy Spirit. And God
[29:07] created in a womb a blood cell that
[29:10] brought forth the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
[29:13] It was the blood cell of God that when
[29:16] he died and the blood cell was broken,
[29:18] the spirit was released to call and
[29:21] bring forth other sons of God. You heard
[29:24] what I said? When he died at Calvary and
[29:27] his blood cell was broken, the spirit
[29:30] was released in every age and not one of
[29:34] them missed it because God purpose must
[29:37] stand. He has declared the end from the
[29:41] beginning. In other words, he see it
[29:43] here and come back here and work it out
[29:46] right here. You not hearing what I am
[29:48] saying? He sees the end. He come back to
[29:52] the beginning and start from here. We
[29:55] are going to where we come from and we
[29:57] come from where we are going. Give the
[30:00] Lord a shout in the house this evening.
[30:10] Now watch. Oh, glory to God. Therefore,
[30:14] my praise God. The innocent lovely lamb
[30:17] is a great creature. God liken us to
[30:20] lambs. The lamb is an animal that cannot
[30:22] make his own way. We find out we can't
[30:26] make our own way. We have to lean upon
[30:28] his arms, upon his guidance. Notice the
[30:32] mest of birds is the dove. And many
[30:35] times it represent the Holy Spirit. And
[30:38] notice the dove is a sign of peace.
[30:40] Wonderful peace. The dove is one bird.
[30:43] The crow is the scavenger another bird.
[30:46] He can't eat the diet of a scavenger
[30:49] because his makeup is different. He has
[30:51] no gall. He has no bitterness. He has no
[30:54] gall. He has no bitterness. He can't
[30:57] digest the things of the world. He can
[31:00] only eat clean and pure things. is a
[31:03] type of the Christian that packs the
[31:05] dove in his heart. No gall of
[31:07] bitterness, no root of bitterness. They
[31:10] do you this, so what they do you that,
[31:12] so what they do you the other, so what?
[31:15] God's purpose must stand. They lie on
[31:17] you, so what they hate you, so what they
[31:20] give up on you, so what? The purpose of
[31:23] God must stand. I shall do my pleasure.
[31:27] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Are
[31:30] you with me? Are you with me, sister?
[31:32] You're going to be blessed, brother.
[31:34] You're going to be blessed. You stay
[31:35] with the word, you've got to be blessed.
[31:38] The devil is a liar. He is angry. He
[31:41] can't enjoy this supernatural presence.
[31:44] He was kicked out of heavenly places. He
[31:48] don't want this. He can't have this.
[31:51] This belongs to us. This belongs. This
[31:54] is our home. We belong in here.
[31:59] [Music]
[31:59] [Applause]
[32:00] [Music]
[32:03] [Applause]
[32:07] What
[32:08] sin? It is Christ that justify it. Oh,
[32:12] glory to God. What sin could that devil
[32:16] accuse you of? You are free. Come on,
[32:19] Johnny Crow. You are free. Come on now.
[32:24] We cut the cause this morning. We broke
[32:27] the chains this morning. You are free to
[32:30] jump. You are free to shout. You are
[32:32] free to praise God. You are
[32:35] [Applause]
[32:46] free. Glory. Receive.
[32:50] Glory. What complex? Kill that. It's a
[32:55] no complex. The only complex we have is
[32:57] faith. virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[33:01] patience. You have no inferiority
[33:02] complex. You have no You're too small,
[33:05] you're too big, you're too tall, you
[33:07] don't have the education. Forget that.
[33:09] All he knew, he called. All he called,
[33:13] he justified. All he justified, he
[33:21] had.
[33:23] Oh. Oh, glory.
[33:28] Glory. Glory to God.
[33:31] [Applause]
[33:38] Not some he for
[33:40] you. You may be seated.
[33:44] To for knew you is to know you before.
[33:49] So I could say although he knew before
[33:52] he had justified. The word justify means
[33:56] you never did it. The devil can't come
[33:58] and point no finger. I will tell him go
[34:01] back with your finger on your hand.
[34:04] Don't come and point no finger or he
[34:07] fall you. We are justified today. As if
[34:11] we never did
[34:13] it. My
[34:16] God. I feel like coming out here and say
[34:19] amen. Preacher. Preacher. Praise God.
[34:22] Amen.
[34:26] [Applause]
[34:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[34:35] Give
[34:37] [Applause]
[34:40] me Jesus. Let me get a sample. You ever
[34:43] gone in a place and have samples? Go in
[34:45] price m sample. Yes. To teach you to
[34:48] buy. My Jesus. Amen. Samples. This this
[34:52] this this is not the giving away things
[34:54] now. No, they're trying to stimulate to
[34:56] buy their stuff.
[34:59] Amen. Well, we we selling something
[35:05] and we giving a sample woman caught in
[35:07] the very act. Give us a sample of
[35:09] adultery. Sample.
[35:12] Scribe and Francis come with the books
[35:14] and tapes. We hear it. We play it. The
[35:16] woman guilty as charged. Stone.
[35:20] We have the rules. All right. We have
[35:21] the Lord. The book is there. All right.
[35:27] Who knows the end from the beginning.
[35:28] All right. That woman name is in the
[35:31] book. She doesn't even know it.
[35:33] That woman is free. She doesn't know it.
[35:36] She's in tears. But she is free. She is
[35:39] forgiven. But she is broken. She doesn't
[35:42] know it yet. Yet. Yet.
[35:47] [Music]
[35:48] Her accusers are ready. But God purpose
[35:51] must stand because he declared the end
[35:54] from the beginning.
[35:57] [Applause]
[35:59] [Music]
[36:02] Jesus said a simple word. Which one of
[36:07] you without sin
[36:11] cast the first
[36:14] stone? Well, you can see the elder in
[36:16] the camp. He now remember he had to pay
[36:18] some bills. And they can see the deacon
[36:21] in the camp. He was scrambling because
[36:22] he forget he had to pick up the
[36:23] groceries for his wife. All of them
[36:25] dropped the stone and said, "I have
[36:26] excuse." And Jesus gave them time out.
[36:28] He turned his back to them. He gave them
[36:30] time out for them to look at the self
[36:32] and let the conscience bother them and
[36:35] trouble them because all they want to
[36:37] condemn on the high horses have things
[36:38] in their closet all hidden up. So Jesus
[36:41] wanted to bust them and expose them.
[36:42] Before you rip into this woman, before
[36:44] you condemn this woman, before you point
[36:46] all your fingers at this woman, there
[36:48] are some fingers pointed back at you.
[36:50] And they all left. And when Jesus broke
[36:52] the silence, he said, "Woman, let's call
[36:54] this trial. Let's court the call case,
[36:56] the court case. Woman, stand forward.
[36:58] Witnesses come forward." None.
[37:02] If there are no witnesses, you have to
[37:04] dismiss the case. Jesus said, "Where are
[37:06] the witnesses? None, my Lord. Neither do
[37:08] I condemn thee. Now go and sin. No more.
[37:13] No more. No more. What was that woman
[37:16] do? My God. I was going to dance in the
[37:18] street. Oh, glory to God. I was going to
[37:20] shout like I never shouted before
[37:23] because I I can tell you this. Who the
[37:26] son of man set free
[37:30] is free indeed. Come on
[37:33] now. Glory to God. You see, you see, you
[37:37] may be seated. You see, if you leave
[37:38] Egypt and you're not sure how free you
[37:41] are, the devil like Pharaoh could see
[37:45] you as a runaway slave. So, he want to
[37:48] get you back. As far as he concerned,
[37:51] you leave his territory. As far as he's
[37:53] concerned, you belong to the devil. But
[37:56] we are saying no Satan, no Satan, we
[37:59] don't belong to you. We are not runaway
[38:01] slaves. We are a liberated people. We
[38:04] are people set free by the blood of the
[38:08] lamb. I know the blood is not preached
[38:10] much but the blood prevails. Despite
[38:13] what the people say, despite what the
[38:16] devil say. Oh, the blood prevails. No
[38:19] matter what the devil say. Thank God.
[38:23] Thank God the blood prevails. To show
[38:27] you how powerful this thing is. You may
[38:29] be seated. Brother Brham said if the
[38:31] power is to come among a people it
[38:34] wouldn't even be their prayer. It will
[38:36] be the grace of God. Praying doesn't
[38:38] mean power. It's still the grace of God.
[38:42] Grace is sovereign. Grace is from a
[38:44] sovereign one. Is from a sovereign king.
[38:47] He give to whomsoever he will. He redeem
[38:50] whoever he will. He redeeming the
[38:52] fornown, the elected, the predestinated.
[38:55] The word bride. You want to tell me that
[38:58] God sees me as a world bride and I am
[39:01] dead and depressed. No devil every day.
[39:04] I'm getting stronger. Every day the
[39:07] devil getting nervous because the people
[39:09] that know their God shall be strong and
[39:12] do great exploits. The devil is having a
[39:15] nervous time this evening because he
[39:18] thought after food you'll be dead. He
[39:21] thought after this morning service you
[39:24] would come in here. to crank you up. But
[39:26] he has something coming. We not about to
[39:29] crank you up. You are fired up, ready to
[39:33] go. Glory to God. Hallelujah. You are
[39:37] fired and ready to go. We're going to
[39:41] burn out the meat. We're going to burn
[39:43] out the food this evening. We're going
[39:45] to shout like we never shouted before
[39:48] because we see our names in the Lamb's
[39:51] book of life. And we know who the
[39:55] Solomon set free is free
[40:05] indeed. Oh,
[40:06] hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Glory to
[40:10] God. Glory to God. My my
[40:14] my my
[40:16] [Applause]
[40:18] my. Hallelujah.
[40:21] Hallelujah.
[40:22] Friends, meekness is not weakness.
[40:26] Meekness is power in control. Oh,
[40:31] hallelujah. Not because the man looking
[40:33] meek, that does not mean he is weak.
[40:36] Come on, say amen, somebody. What man
[40:39] called great, God called foolish. And
[40:41] what God call foolish. What man called
[40:43] foolish, God called great. You may be
[40:45] seated. Oh,
[40:47] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[40:50] Oh, glory to God.
[40:53] Hallelujah. Oh, glory.
[40:56] Woo. My my
[40:58] my feel mighty moving of his spirit. I
[41:03] feel the breath of God upon you. He
[41:05] breathe upon the receiving the Holy
[41:08] Ghost. I feel the breath of God upon you
[41:11] this evening. We are moving into the
[41:13] supernatural. We are moving into the
[41:16] dove descending and remaining. We are
[41:18] moving into people that know their God.
[41:21] Oh hallelujah.
[41:24] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God.
[41:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In every age,
[41:30] they had to have a people that God must
[41:32] anoint. But listen to this. Why did he
[41:35] choose the lamb and the dove? Is because
[41:38] the dove could not abide in nothing else
[41:40] but a lamb. The natures are the same.
[41:43] Let me drop this in here. All these
[41:45] ministers
[41:47] impersonating ranking the self, crowning
[41:49] the self, anointing the self, pretending
[41:51] the self, playing the self, and the beef
[41:53] on display. Brother Brandham said it
[41:56] takes a humble heart dedicated to God to
[41:59] bring Jesus Christ into present tense.
[42:02] So after a while, all the talk get
[42:04] exposed, you know, all the mouth
[42:06] champions, all who only voicing and
[42:08] talking and yapping and they're not
[42:10] living anything and they have nothing to
[42:12] show God. all that going to get exposure
[42:15] now because it takes a humble heart
[42:17] dedicated to God. So when Jesus took his
[42:21] belt and beat them out the temple that
[42:24] was humble heart wrecking the show and
[42:28] telling them my father's house shall be
[42:30] called a house of prayer. Don't miss
[42:32] that mistake of arrogance or bad
[42:33] behavior. No, he was angry.
[42:38] You ever see a man angry with a smile?
[42:40] What kind of anger is
[42:42] that? All right. He was angry. He was
[42:47] angry because it was corrupting the
[42:48] house of God with money changers and
[42:51] selling of doves and birds and he beat
[42:53] them up and throw them over the tables
[42:55] and whatnot. He was angry. Say my
[42:58] father's zeal of my father's house had
[43:00] eaten me up. His passion for the
[43:03] father's house. And that's what God
[43:04] bringing inside of here. Certain things
[43:06] we have tolerated we will no longer
[43:08] tolerate. We will smoke you up or smoke
[43:11] you out or you will choose your way out.
[43:13] But this church is not going to be the
[43:15] same. We're going to take some fire
[43:16] bombs and just throw it. Praise God.
[43:19] That's what the the turners are going to
[43:20] do. My God. After you cross a border,
[43:22] you blow up the bridge behind you. No
[43:24] turning back. Don't leave no old man and
[43:26] husband to go back with. Don't know your
[43:27] old fornication unclean to go back with.
[43:30] Bun it. Blow it up. Praise God. Break it
[43:33] down. You're only moving forward.
[43:34] Everything make a step. Blow the bridge
[43:36] behind you. You have nothing to fall
[43:38] back on. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[43:41] Like that man who went across in South
[43:43] America, when he reached to conquer the
[43:45] land, when he reached what he told them,
[43:46] he said, "Burn the boats." They say,
[43:48] "You got to be kidding."
[43:52] He wanted them to get desperate. That's
[43:54] right. And some of them saying, "But
[43:55] this is what to take us back." He said,
[43:57] "No, we have to take their boats.
[44:01] We're going to burn ours so we not going
[44:04] back on ours." He forced them to fight.
[44:06] He forced them to press. He forced them
[44:09] to say, "You know what? My bird bone.
[44:11] I've got to get the boats that they
[44:13] have. And to get them, you have to
[44:15] fight. They're not giving you their
[44:16] boats. They're not selling you their
[44:18] boats. The devil not
[44:23] stupid. The devil not giving you a offer
[44:26] for you just to take it. What he took
[44:28] from you, you got to take it back." And
[44:31] the kingdom suffer violence.
[44:34] and the
[44:36] violent take it by
[44:39] force. Tell somebody take it by force.
[44:41] Tell somebody
[44:45] [Applause]
[44:55] [Applause]
[45:02] this what we are standing for is
[45:05] nonnegotiable.
[45:07] [Applause]
[45:08] We're not negotiating this. We're not
[45:10] negotiating signs, wonders, miracles,
[45:14] revival spirit, overcoming power of God,
[45:17] supernatural omnipotence, speaking the
[45:19] word miraculous. We are not negotiating
[45:22] that. We are declaring it's action time.
[45:32] Do you
[45:33] understand? Thank you. The spirit that
[45:37] is now upon you is against the evil
[45:40] spirits that is in your home
[45:43] or attacking your home. When you go
[45:46] home, you are walking with an anointing
[45:49] with a light, with a lamp, with a power,
[45:53] with an uncction. You got to believe it.
[45:56] You got to have faith in it. You got to
[45:58] know it. When you walk in, the devil
[46:00] walk out. When you come through the
[46:02] front door, the devil take the back
[46:03] door. He want to know if it's abiding.
[46:06] He's walking around the house because
[46:08] he's not sure if this going to stay. If
[46:11] this going to remain. You see, you got
[46:13] to act right. You got to talk right. You
[46:15] got to live right for this dog to abide.
[46:18] It's going to abide. Somebody going to
[46:21] get the
[46:28] abiding. That's why I'm almost done.
[46:32] That's why I call it applied
[46:33] Christianity because this is things you
[46:36] could apply to be sweet to your wife to
[46:39] get in temper spasm and temper spells
[46:41] because when the temper act up the do
[46:45] b said the dove not fire far away the
[46:47] dove waiting for they get lamblike again
[46:49] as soon get lamblike the dove draw
[46:51] nearer nearer as they get wolf like he's
[46:54] going further and further he wants to
[46:57] come because you're a son but your
[46:59] behavior and the landing pad is not good
[47:02] enough for the dust the land when he
[47:03] tried to land he's a woo not not now not
[47:06] now the kind of temper he's in not now I
[47:09] I I I check him back a little later see
[47:12] that wife and she rude mouth and so not
[47:14] not now not now see how she mouth little
[47:16] peppery and so on like a whip and so on
[47:19] not now I'm going to hang outside until
[47:22] she cool down and when it kind of cool
[47:24] down the
[47:26] doo like it brooding that droo Lord God
[47:31] forgive me. Oh, the dove loves that. Oh,
[47:33] God, I repent. God, the dove loves that.
[47:35] Lord, I'm going to make things right.
[47:36] The dove loves that. I'm humbling
[47:38] myself. The dove loves that. Oh, these
[47:40] things. The dove just love and dove
[47:42] keeps coming and coming. Hallelujah.

[47:47] you. I know it's upon you. I feel it. I
[47:48] know it. Say it's upon you right now.
[47:50] The devil is not upon you. The dove is
[47:52] upon you. I'm saying it right to your
[47:55] face. The dove is upon you right now.
[47:59] Better you keep him is a different
[48:01] thing.
[48:05] I'm not preaching the dove and the wolf.
[48:08] I'm preaching the dove and the lamb.
[48:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[48:15] God. Glory to God. Glory. Hallelujah.
[48:20] Hallelujah. Mark the perfect man. He can
[48:23] bridle his tongue. Amen. Amen. Mark the
[48:28] imperfect man, his tongue is loose.
[48:33] Mark the church world who in between.
[48:38] So you see in terms of temperance and
[48:42] patience, God must set it up for
[48:44] something to happen. All these thunders
[48:46] and all these mysteries and virtues, you
[48:49] really expect to sit on a church bench
[48:51] to him that overcome it. To him that
[48:54] does God say to him that said amen. If
[48:56] he says to him that say amen shall I
[48:58] grant a sit on my throne. It's thousand
[49:00] sitting on his throne. You know just
[49:02] have to say amen.
[49:05] Hallelujah. And they get through. But
[49:08] Jesus to him that overcome it as I
[49:12] overcome.
[49:14] Oh it stop. You mean Jesus had overcome.
[49:17] Yes. Overcome what? Lust of the eyes,
[49:20] lust of the flesh. God put Jes with
[49:22] wings on him and say fly away. Oh glory.
[49:24] Praise God.
[49:26] Hallelujah. Jesus didn't come like that.
[49:28] When Lazarus was dead and he come
[49:30] everybody cry, he cry too.
[49:34] He not like these freak these
[49:35] hypocritical freak boy but he wife dead
[49:37] and he
[49:38] cry as if that's a spiritual something.
[49:42] My wife died and I cry. What kind of
[49:43] nonsense is that? It's my
[49:45] wife all these years and I ain't cry as
[49:48] a man. I ain't cry.
[49:51] But Jesus was Jesus cry. But after he
[49:53] finish crying you say where have you
[49:54] laid him?
[49:56] You know was tears over that's emotional
[49:59] time I had a time for that but now I fix
[50:01] up that fix up already I cried where
[50:03] where have you laid him
[50:06] then Jesus groan in the spirit he come
[50:08] out of human crying and groan in the
[50:10] spirit where have you laid him he groan
[50:13] in the spirit what happening there
[50:14] anointing start to come voice angel oh
[50:18] voice of the archangel then Jesus gave a
[50:21] big promise boy if you're sick you'll
[50:23] get healed the man dead. He said he that
[50:25] believeth on me, you know, he said, he
[50:27] said, "I am the resurrection and the
[50:29] life." He was giving him a promise that
[50:31] he didn't have before. Understand is the
[50:33] man dead that's in the human realm. But
[50:35] yes, when we go awake, I am the
[50:37] resurrection. So people are connected
[50:38] that promise to activate it.
[50:43] That promise was the SIM card to put in
[50:46] the phone to activate Shazawa's
[50:49] resurrection. I am the resurrection and
[50:51] the life. That healing saw the phone
[50:54] ain't going ring but when keep putting
[50:56] that inside the car even now Lord
[50:58] whatsoever you shall ask oh let's call
[51:00] on the line Lazarus
[51:05] comfort Lazarus heard it because this
[51:09] this cell phone thing here working
[51:10] different that voice does travel they
[51:13] only impersonating what we already have
[51:15] that voice passed through the regions of
[51:17] the lost to regions of the dead that
[51:19] voice was sounding Lazarus, Lazarus,
[51:22] Lazarus, Lazarus, Lazarus, Lazarus. When
[51:24] that voice found that soul to pull in
[51:26] the come forth, come forth, come forth,
[51:28] come forth. And when that voice, God
[51:31] purpose going to stand. When that voice
[51:33] begin to ricochet in this church, in
[51:36] this island, across the world, nothing
[51:38] going to stop it. The grave is going to
[51:40] hear it. Glory to God. The dead going to
[51:42] come forth.
[51:47] [Applause]
[51:53] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[51:56] So you realize the dove can come and Oh,
[51:59] thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[52:02] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[52:04] Praise God. Devil try something you
[52:06] know. Hallelujah. That is right. That is
[52:08] privilege. Amen. Keep on trying. Devil
[52:11] that we didn't stop. Praise God. What we
[52:13] going to have this evening? I'm almost
[52:15] done. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory
[52:19] to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Give
[52:22] the Lord some
[52:24] [Applause]
[52:28] praises. That's what we're talking
[52:30] about. When one fail, you fire next one.
[52:32] When gun one got some firing, take next
[52:34] gun. Boom. Boom. When this finish, you
[52:36] pull out one. Boom. Boom. Right. When
[52:38] you're finished with the guns, you take
[52:39] the bow and arrows. Then you go to the
[52:41] slingshot. Then you go to the wrong man.
[52:43] Hallelujah. Praise God. every
[52:46] weapon on board. Give the Lord a
[52:56] shout. Watch the reason the two could
[52:58] dwell together. Their natures were meek,
[53:00] lowly, humble, they could dwell
[53:02] together. When God and Christ became
[53:04] one, then the dove came under the lamb.
[53:06] Heaven and earth kissed each other. God
[53:08] and man was reconciled together. One of
[53:10] the greatest moment when the dove and
[53:12] the lamb came together. Amen. If you
[53:14] watch the dove, the reason it stayed on
[53:16] the lamb because the nature was the
[53:18] same. And the reason the dove stays on
[53:20] the Christian, he will stay there as
[53:23] long as he's a lamb. But when he takes a
[53:25] different nature, the dove takes his
[53:27] flight. So people testify when I come to
[53:29] the Lord, it was so sweet and loving and
[53:31] what not. Yeah, you were loving and
[53:33] sweet.
[53:34] Hallelujah. And then you say the wife
[53:36] God give me.
[53:39] Hallelujah. Then you say the husband are
[53:41] married. Then you say the children is
[53:44] trouble, you know, all time. They want
[53:45] the children, but you get
[53:48] them. Then they complain about the job
[53:51] and the pay and the shoes and the house
[53:53] and the roof leaking and they can't pay
[53:54] this and all kind of things. But when
[53:56] you examine it, it's only relative. Like
[53:58] when they go to the states, it I drive 5
[54:01] miles and find 5
[54:02] hours. 5 hours in one shot and we go to
[54:05] where we have to go. When we come back
[54:08] to Trinidad, Toko is just up there for
[54:10] us. Mero is just down there a and a half
[54:13] like a small thing. It's relative. What
[54:16] are you complaining about? What trials
[54:18] have you been through? What will have
[54:20] you faced? You're fussing. Fing for
[54:22] what? You have to raise above that. The
[54:25] real test is yet to come. This morning
[54:28] is preparing for the hour of battle. Not
[54:30] the hour of chithat.
[54:34] Hallelujah. Yeah. Yeah. When a boxer
[54:36] preparing and the training and whatnot,
[54:38] they have somebody who impersonating the
[54:40] real fighter, but that not the real
[54:42] fight. Somebody trying to act like that
[54:45] and you're boxing and you're rehearsing
[54:46] that the rehearsals in your show. But
[54:50] when the real ring come and ping ping
[54:52] ping ping, let's get ready to rumble.
[54:55] Amen. And all them people roaring, it's
[54:57] a different kind of feel, you know.
[54:58] Hallelujah. Because you can get knock
[54:59] out cold. Praise God. It's a different
[55:01] kind of feel, you know. This could be a
[55:02] big payday or a big payout,
[55:05] a big out for you. So when the real time
[55:07] come for fight, that's what it is, you
[55:09] know, and you're jumping and you're
[55:10] sweating and you and what not and all
[55:12] the fancy name uh they call it um um
[55:14] this um um um some kind of a hard rock
[55:17] thing. You can see my iron might tighten
[55:20] and some fancy name behind it, you know,
[55:23] this rough thing and all kind of thing
[55:24] and all kind of big fancy name and
[55:25] eventually big fs.
[55:28] Hallelujah. All the big fans get blows.
[55:30] Glory. My goodness. And God waited for
[55:34] all the ages to let the devil do his
[55:36] doom because the devil only have seven
[55:38] tricks he could come up with.
[55:40] Hallelujah. And God have to get the
[55:42] techniques of the seven times of this
[55:44] battle. Amen. For God to get a blueprint
[55:47] of what we have to deal with in the last
[55:49] days. So what the devil didn't know, God
[55:51] is recording his techniques over all
[55:53] these seven ages. And and God have seven
[55:56] thunders, seven voices that challenge
[55:59] the demon powers in seven church ages.
[56:02] And God pack all those voices and leave
[56:04] it for the last age. So we have all the
[56:06] knockout punch that every age knock out
[56:09] the devil with. And we have it combined
[56:11] now. When you have one thunder, two
[56:12] thunder, three thunders, we have all
[56:14] seven in this last day. It's in our
[56:17] pocket. It's in our hands. It's in our
[56:19] hearts. We walking with this. We are
[56:22] God's voice. Ah, in the last days we
[56:25] become the thunders itself. We become
[56:27] the mystery itself. When they say the
[56:30] thunder not revealed, they're not
[56:31] talking about us. They're not talking to
[56:33] us because we are the mystery of Christ
[56:36] and Christ is the mystery of God. Do you
[56:38] not hear what I am saying? Just as God
[56:41] revealed, just as Jesus revealed God, we
[56:44] will reveal Jesus Christ. Oh, give the
[56:46] Lord a shout because the bride will be
[56:49] the final voice to the final age. Oh,
[56:52] glory to God. Do you believe that? Do
[56:55] you feel that way? Let's stand and give
[56:58] God a shout. Oh, I'm done. Father God,
[57:02] let a fire fall upon your sons and
[57:04] daughters. In Jesus name, I ask it. Amen
[57:08] and
[57:08] [Applause]

[1:04:12] Amen. Let's just enter our Bibles. Amen.
[1:04:16] To first Corinthians chapter
[1:04:20] 11. Thank you,
[1:04:33] Lord 23- 32.
[1:04:38] Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:04:40] Father, we pray that as we read your
[1:04:42] word this evening, you bless it and
[1:04:44] inspire our hearts, Father, in your
[1:04:46] precious name.
[1:04:48] Amen. Verse 23.
[1:04:53] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:04:56] which also I delivered unto you, that
[1:04:59] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:05:02] he was betrayed, took
[1:05:05] bread. And when he had given thanks, he
[1:05:08] broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is
[1:05:12] my body which is broken for you. This do
[1:05:16] in remembrance of me."
[1:05:19] After the same manner also he took the
[1:05:22] cup when he had stopped, saying, "This
[1:05:26] cup is the new testament in my
[1:05:28] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[1:05:31] it in remembrance of
[1:05:34] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[1:05:37] and drink this cup, ye do show the
[1:05:40] Lord's death till he come.
[1:05:43] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:05:46] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:05:49] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:05:51] and blood of the
[1:05:54] Lord. But let a man examine himself and
[1:05:58] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:06:00] of that
[1:06:01] cup. For he that eat eateth and
[1:06:04] drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and
[1:06:06] drinkketh damnation to himself, not
[1:06:09] desiring the Lord's body.
[1:06:12] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:06:14] among you and many sleep. For if we will
[1:06:18] judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:06:20] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:06:23] chasing of the Lord that we should not
[1:06:26] be condemned with the world. Amen. Let's
[1:06:29] just bow our heads and close our
[1:06:33] eyes. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we
[1:06:37] are here this evening, Lord, what an
[1:06:39] anointing, Lord, what a word has gone
[1:06:41] forth, Father. Lord, surely is the dove
[1:06:44] leading the eagles this evening, Father.
[1:06:47] Lord, we are so grateful in our hearts
[1:06:49] for your love towards us, Lord. Lord,
[1:06:53] how you justified us and had already
[1:06:55] glorified us, Lord. Lord, and bringing
[1:06:58] us, Lord, unto adoption, Father, Lord,
[1:07:01] we want to stay in your presence, dear
[1:07:03] God.
[1:07:04] Father, we pray as we bring the
[1:07:06] articles, Lord, the bread and the wine
[1:07:08] before you this evening. We pray that
[1:07:10] you bless these articles, Lord, and
[1:07:13] Lord, anoint them and inspire our
[1:07:15] hearts, Lord, as we partake, Lord, of
[1:07:17] the supper this evening, Lord. And if
[1:07:19] any be sick, may they be healed, Lord.
[1:07:22] Lord, oh God, may people be filled, may
[1:07:24] your people be filled with your Holy
[1:07:26] Spirit, even Lord, as they commune with
[1:07:28] you and with each other this evening,
[1:07:30] Father. Lord, our hearts burn within us
[1:07:33] this evening, Lord. Lord, that you would
[1:07:35] fill your people, Lord
[1:07:37] Jesus. Lord, we commit the reigning
[1:07:39] portion of this communion service into
[1:07:41] your hands in your precious name. Amen.
[1:07:46] Let's just keep our heads bowed and our
[1:07:48] eyes closed for a moment of silence.
[1:07:50] Amen. And you pray for the ministry as
[1:07:52] the ministry prays for you this evening.
[1:07:55] Amen.
[1:08:01] Come
[1:08:17] on. Praise the name of the Lord. You may
[1:08:20] be seated as the deacons. Amen. Get
[1:08:22] ready for the communion. Praise God. And
[1:08:25] the usher and the elders. Praise his
[1:08:28] wonderful name.
