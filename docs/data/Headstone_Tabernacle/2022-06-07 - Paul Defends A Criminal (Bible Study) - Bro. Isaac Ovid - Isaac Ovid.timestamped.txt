[17:56] father we commit this bible study into
[17:58] your hands
[17:59] we thank you in the precious name of
[18:00] jesus christ amen amen and amen
[18:04] it is certainly a great privilege to be
[18:07] here once again in the presence of the
[18:09] lord
[18:10] and i trust that you came
[18:12] on the great expectation tonight for god
[18:15] to speak to you in a special way
[18:18] i
[18:19] truly don't take
[18:21] these
[18:22] opportunities to come together for
[18:24] granted
[18:25] and i trust that you don't take it for
[18:27] granted as well it is not something that
[18:29] is
[18:30] is accidental uh i believe it is always
[18:32] by design and it takes work and effort
[18:35] on both our parts as it will
[18:37] um effort in your commitment and your
[18:40] dedication and your zeal and your
[18:41] enthusiasm and
[18:42] your heartfelt you know appreciation of
[18:45] the word of god that has been hidden and
[18:48] written and hidden for all of these
[18:49] years and the dedication to study this
[18:51] word so that it becomes a life to us and
[18:54] a reality to us in this time that we're
[18:56] living in
[18:58] so
[18:58] i have a bit of a thought tonight
[19:01] um i
[19:03] i had the opportunity
[19:05] to
[19:06] spend some time in this scripture
[19:09] and it was such a blessing to me
[19:11] um and even as you know i was reading it
[19:14] through tonight in preparation it's just
[19:17] it's just so rich and so real
[19:20] and it is amazing how much
[19:22] is in the wood
[19:24] that we can get inspiration from you
[19:26] know and
[19:28] something has to refresh our hearts
[19:31] you know
[19:32] we have to realize that the word itself
[19:35] is refreshing
[19:37] and the word brings a time of refreshing
[19:39] you know and
[19:42] you know you look at different types of
[19:43] books and different materials and every
[19:45] type of encouragement and you realize
[19:47] that
[19:49] there are so many things you need
[19:51] now to survive in life
[19:53] you know you need to understand far more
[19:55] now than you had to understand years ago
[19:57] to be able to navigate
[19:59] this world that we live in
[20:01] you know you have to be able to
[20:04] communicate a certain way you have to
[20:05] spend time understanding certain things
[20:07] and
[20:08] and many times you try to find
[20:10] somebody's skills you learn it in school
[20:12] you take it in courses you do all these
[20:14] all of these things and
[20:16] having had the opportunity to study
[20:18] different things my mind is blown
[20:21] as i have gotten deeper and deeper into
[20:23] scripture
[20:24] to see how much and i said this years
[20:27] ago how much
[20:29] of what the world tries to teach
[20:31] or bring us to understand is actually in
[20:33] scripture you know principles and
[20:36] teaching that are in scripture and that
[20:38] if we become better students of
[20:40] scripture
[20:42] you know our entire lives
[20:44] would be so different so
[20:46] i trust that you join me on this journey
[20:48] we just have one chapter tonight that
[20:51] we're going to spend some time in i'm a
[20:53] bit excited because
[20:55] i i'm not sure
[20:57] um i've had the opportunity to share on
[20:59] this before or who had much
[21:01] shared about this before but i trust
[21:03] it'll be a blessing to you tonight so
[21:05] are we ready tonight you know i wish i
[21:07] could see some more faces but
[21:09] um it it it it it is as as it is now and
[21:13] if the lord inspires you to
[21:15] be a more active participator tonight
[21:17] you know it will be it will be an
[21:19] encouragement you know
[21:20] so i have a title tonight normally i um
[21:24] would kind of lay a foundation and get
[21:26] to the title but
[21:27] uh i want a lady title first and then
[21:29] kind of build to it you know so
[21:31] for a title for this bible study tonight
[21:34] it's going to be paul defends a criminal
[21:38] paul defends
[21:40] a criminal all right so
[21:43] are we ready all right so
[21:45] paul is a unique character in scripture
[21:47] as we all know
[21:49] you know he wasn't always paul
[21:51] um he was known as saul
[21:54] he called himself
[21:56] by his own declaration a pharisee of
[21:58] pharisees
[22:00] so he was not a
[22:02] a fly-by-night
[22:04] you know follower of the law so to speak
[22:06] he was not somebody who was a bystander
[22:10] of the law
[22:11] he was a pharisee of pharisees he
[22:13] considered himself
[22:16] a one notch above the other pharisees
[22:18] he considered himself to be a one
[22:20] percenter among the pharisees a pharisee
[22:22] of pharisees
[22:24] he considered himself well trained in
[22:26] the law in the word
[22:28] in the word to his understanding
[22:31] because at the time he would have been
[22:32] growing up
[22:34] no doubt jesus would have been around
[22:36] but jesus never piqued his interest
[22:37] because for him this thing was just
[22:39] different it just didn't fit into his
[22:41] conception his understanding as it were
[22:45] of what he had read and studied as a
[22:46] pharisee so without hesitation when
[22:49] jesus died and the disciples were doing
[22:51] what they did and and we know the story
[22:53] of of paul's
[22:55] or saul as it were at the time his
[22:56] interaction with stephen the deacon and
[22:59] led the stoning of it and then god would
[23:01] take this man called paul
[23:03] who was saul
[23:04] and give him a transformation not just a
[23:06] transformation among the many apostles
[23:10] who were called in that day
[23:12] he was not just an apostle
[23:14] he would be a star in the right hand of
[23:17] god
[23:18] in so much that our prophet messenger
[23:21] with a reference that paul was the gold
[23:24] standard he was an authority
[23:26] of authorities he was the foundation
[23:29] upon which this pyramid message that we
[23:32] preach
[23:33] that we have been able to highlight into
[23:36] the ministry of peter and peter's
[23:38] unfolding of faith virtue knowledge all
[23:40] the way to charity we could look at paul
[23:43] for so many different teachings
[23:45] you know when we type the church ages
[23:48] which ties into what peter taught
[23:50] you know when we look at his tatavapic
[23:52] man the ephesians church and the the the
[23:55] the all of the different churches that
[23:57] he brought out and
[23:58] and colossians and all these churches
[24:00] paul spent a lot of time
[24:03] addressing
[24:04] these churches you know as you go
[24:07] through scripture
[24:08] and you kind of look at the ministry of
[24:11] paul and paul's letter to the romans and
[24:14] corinthians and galatians and the
[24:16] ephesians and the philippians and the
[24:18] colossians and the thessalonians and
[24:22] it's really really a mighty powerful
[24:24] ministry and a powerful message
[24:31] it is interesting to note
[24:33] that
[24:35] outside of paul speaking to these great
[24:38] churches and this is where it begins for
[24:40] me to become a mind-blowing thing
[24:44] paul is addressing entire churches
[24:47] and churches that
[24:49] also the message to that church also
[24:52] spans generations and we can look at it
[24:54] now as a message to the church everybody
[24:56] with me all right
[24:58] but then
[24:59] out of this
[25:01] complex or vast or powerful
[25:04] message of ministry to the churches
[25:06] paul also somehow finds
[25:10] not just time but
[25:12] a level of importance or significance to
[25:15] also write
[25:17] personal letters
[25:20] so we have the letter to the romans and
[25:22] the corinthians and the galatians and
[25:24] the ephesians and the and speaking to
[25:27] churches everybody with me
[25:29] and then we have paul
[25:31] writes to three people
[25:35] three very specific people anybody with
[25:37] me
[25:38] he writes two letters to timothy and
[25:41] timothy is significant because we know
[25:43] that timothy would become the bishop or
[25:46] the pastor of the ephesians church
[25:49] and we know timothy was a great
[25:51] understudy to paul
[25:54] so a lot is shared and in many of the
[25:56] letters that paul wrote he would also
[25:59] attribute timothy to be almost as it
[26:02] were a contributor to the letter that
[26:04] he's writing
[26:06] so paul writes to three people he writes
[26:10] to timothy
[26:12] he writes
[26:13] to titus
[26:15] and he writes to some people pronouncing
[26:17] philemon or philemon
[26:19] all right so
[26:22] tonight i want to spend some time
[26:25] i would say in the book of philemon but
[26:27] it's just one chapter
[26:30] that makes this book a phenomenon
[26:32] and i'm sure if i i do a census with how
[26:35] many people spend time
[26:36] in the book of philemon
[26:38] you say well i really never really
[26:40] studied our book of philemon you know
[26:42] but that is what the lord put on my
[26:44] heart tonight
[26:45] to spend some time
[26:47] in this book
[26:49] of
[26:50] philemon or philemon as it were to spend
[26:53] some time just doing a little
[26:55] a little digging
[26:57] why is it you stabilization why is it
[27:01] in the middle of addressing churches and
[27:04] the issues of churches
[27:06] there's a letter
[27:08] that is addressing this one man and a
[27:11] personal private situation
[27:13] you know
[27:14] we have issues that are private
[27:16] and you have issues that are public
[27:18] when paul is addressing he addresses the
[27:21] fornication and the dis and and openly
[27:24] dealing with matters
[27:26] and then we have
[27:27] private matters you know we have some
[27:29] private stuff we don't like to be
[27:30] addressed but somehow final amount of
[27:33] philemon's private business
[27:35] end up in the bible as something that we
[27:38] can look at and we can study so
[27:40] if you write with me a little bit and
[27:42] you'll find the book
[27:43] or the page
[27:45] or the chapter of philemon one there's
[27:47] no telling one two so
[27:49] let's begin to to to take a little read
[27:52] in there and see where the lord will
[27:53] take us tonight remember my title
[27:54] tonight is paul defends a criminal
[27:58] of all the writings that i've read of
[28:01] paul this to me you know i i've
[28:03] struggled in recent times i've seen it's
[28:05] very difficult to compare
[28:07] books and writers and writing so when i
[28:09] look in the old testament personally for
[28:12] me david really blesses me not that
[28:15] every other individual in the old
[28:16] testament but david is special
[28:19] to me personally that's my testimony and
[28:21] in the new testament peter just stands
[28:22] out and spends some time dealing with
[28:24] peter
[28:25] out of the writings of paul paul is a
[28:29] next level kind of brother but this one
[28:31] this one chapter here
[28:33] had my mind just blown so let's go
[28:36] paul a prisoner
[28:39] of jesus christ
[28:41] and timothy so here again
[28:44] he is adding timothy to the salutation
[28:48] to show you how close timothy was to
[28:50] paul so i want us to we're going to take
[28:52] our time we are going any other chapter
[28:54] than this chapter tonight and you can
[28:56] see that a long chapter but it's a
[28:58] critical chapter to us as individuals
[29:00] and to a church
[29:02] paul a prisoner of jesus christ and
[29:04] timothy our brother
[29:07] unto philemon our
[29:09] dearly beloved
[29:11] and
[29:12] fellow laborer
[29:16] so just by the greeting alone
[29:19] and this name philharmonie is the only
[29:21] time it's mentioned here in the book
[29:23] all right and it's the only time i
[29:25] mentioned in the new testament one time
[29:26] mentioned in the bible
[29:28] and the question now begins to come up
[29:31] who is this man called philemon that is
[29:33] actually deserving of a book or a place
[29:37] in the chapters of the bible
[29:40] that somehow this one page is of such
[29:42] significance because no scripture is
[29:44] without a purpose
[29:46] no individual who is written about is
[29:48] without a purpose so then it begs the
[29:51] question what is the purpose of putting
[29:52] in this here
[29:54] what is the connection of this to us
[29:57] why is it important for us to look at
[29:59] this and see how it applies not just to
[30:01] us as a church but on an individual
[30:04] level because this is the only book
[30:06] where paul actually comes inside
[30:09] somebody's house
[30:11] to the romans to the ephesians to the
[30:13] colossians he deals with churches
[30:16] and the issues ministries even when he
[30:18] deals with timothy there's a lot of
[30:20] timothy that deals with eldership and
[30:22] ministry and second timothy spirits and
[30:25] all that kind of stuff but philemon is
[30:27] the only book that is all about
[30:30] a personal issue
[30:33] a personal matter that is of such
[30:36] significance
[30:38] that paul takes time
[30:40] to write something that makes it into
[30:42] the bible anybody with me today
[30:44] right so i just want to take it paul
[30:47] a prisoner of jesus christ
[30:50] unto timothy our brother unto philemon
[30:53] our daily beloved and fellow laborer now
[30:55] i want to make a first observation
[30:59] there around 13 or thereabout letters
[31:01] that paul wrote in total
[31:04] nine of them start off
[31:07] with something in that first sentence
[31:09] that is not here
[31:11] and that itself starts to bear some
[31:12] significance
[31:14] let's take a quick look at it so for
[31:15] example
[31:16] if i go to romans 1
[31:19] it says paul a servant of jesus christ
[31:21] called to be an apostle so into the
[31:24] romans paul mentions his apostleship he
[31:27] said call to be an apostle everybody
[31:29] with me
[31:30] when you go to first corinthians
[31:32] it says paul called to be an apostle of
[31:34] jesus christ shoot the will of god
[31:37] when you go to
[31:39] the next one second corinthians one
[31:41] paul an apostle of jesus christ let's go
[31:44] you go to galatians church
[31:46] verse one paul an apostle not of men
[31:48] neither by man when you go to ephesians
[31:52] one
[31:53] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[31:55] way so paul as he is writing each letter
[31:59] is placing his
[32:01] scriptural and spiritual authority as a
[32:04] precedent and a foundation for what he's
[32:07] gonna write next
[32:09] they're only about three
[32:11] or four books where paul doesn't
[32:14] approach it like that as an apostle
[32:17] not that he could not do it
[32:20] but he chooses not to do it
[32:22] and in this it is
[32:24] particularly interesting
[32:27] because
[32:29] he deliberately approaches it a certain
[32:32] way
[32:32] and and this speaks to us now as
[32:34] believers you know paul says to the weak
[32:36] i became weaker to be strong i became
[32:38] strong
[32:39] here it is paul wants to address the
[32:41] issue
[32:42] with philharmon and his house
[32:45] and he chooses his approach and that's
[32:47] the first lesson i want us to appreciate
[32:50] he didn't come to philemon and you will
[32:52] see how he repeats this issue and why
[32:54] i'm making this point because he
[32:56] reinforces the point later on in
[32:58] addressing it
[33:00] why it is not always important to use
[33:03] your authority and your name and your
[33:05] title
[33:07] paul didn't come as the
[33:08] apostle he is coming in a very
[33:11] deliberate
[33:13] strategic
[33:15] he is choosing his words very carefully
[33:19] he is using persuasion he wants to use
[33:22] influence we're going to see it here
[33:24] so paul a prisoner of jesus christ he's
[33:26] not seeing a prisoner of jesus christ as
[33:28] a complaint he's not seeing it as you
[33:31] know biblical scholars attribute this
[33:34] prison of jesus christ as a badge of
[33:36] honor
[33:37] anybody with me tonight all right he
[33:39] didn't consider himself a prisoner of
[33:41] circumstance a prisoner of situations so
[33:44] every word here
[33:46] every sentence every punctuation in this
[33:50] one chapter arrive with me tonight is
[33:52] extremely deliberate
[33:53] paul a prisoner of jesus christ
[33:56] in the amplified it says a prisoner for
[33:58] the sake of christ jesus the messiah
[34:00] anointed and timothy
[34:03] our brother unto philemon our daily
[34:05] beloved and fellow laborer so we begin
[34:08] to understand he's not writing an
[34:10] unbeliever firstly
[34:12] he's not writing somebody he doesn't
[34:14] know i want us to appreciate this
[34:16] because we inside the house tonight
[34:19] and we're gonna pick out some things
[34:20] here so he's not addressing somebody who
[34:22] doesn't believe he's not addressing
[34:24] somebody that doesn't have a
[34:25] relationship with
[34:27] this is not somebody who is beloved he
[34:29] calls him dearly beloved
[34:32] we will see later down
[34:34] how deep his relationship was
[34:37] all right and not only is he dearly
[34:40] beloved but he is a fellow laborer
[34:44] fellow laborer as a term means that
[34:46] philemon is working in a vineyard
[34:49] he has a ministerial attribute to his
[34:53] walk to his talk anybody anybody with me
[34:56] all right
[34:59] so
[35:00] and to our beloved affair
[35:03] now any amplified it will says to your
[35:05] wife of fear our sister
[35:09] so paul
[35:11] this is this is i want us to look at
[35:13] even the structure of how he is writing
[35:15] and it begins to matter
[35:17] to our beloved of fear and achieve us
[35:20] our fellow soldier
[35:22] and to the church in thy house
[35:27] so this is a brother and his wife some
[35:30] scholars would argue that ocupus is his
[35:32] son who is like a ministering son you
[35:35] know so he's a minister so paul is
[35:39] clearly very familiar with who he's
[35:41] writing
[35:42] he is he is aware of the man
[35:44] he's aware of his wife he's aware
[35:47] whether it's his son or just the helper
[35:49] or the other minister there he's aware
[35:51] that this man has made available his
[35:53] home to have services i want us to
[35:55] understand the context of the time they
[35:57] had no church buildings at the time
[36:00] so the early church would move from home
[36:02] to home
[36:03] and this special brother philemon who
[36:06] was beloved of paul who had a
[36:08] relationship was paul
[36:10] he
[36:11] was willing and he was one who made his
[36:13] home available to these scenes what a
[36:15] testimony would would you make your home
[36:18] available
[36:20] to have to church in in your home
[36:22] i want you to see the quality of brother
[36:25] we're dealing with the quality of the
[36:27] man
[36:28] that we are dealing with all right
[36:30] now
[36:31] [Music]
[36:33] we will have to come back to these
[36:34] verses as we go a bit later down why he
[36:37] had to do some of these things
[36:39] and paul says grace to you
[36:43] and the peace there's almost no
[36:45] introduction where paul doesn't talk
[36:48] about grace
[36:49] and peace
[36:51] the grace of the lord anybody tonight
[36:52] tango for the grace of the lord upon
[36:54] your life
[36:58] grace to you and peace from god our
[37:00] father
[37:01] and the lord jesus christ
[37:03] [Music]
[37:06] he goes on verse 4 i thank my god
[37:11] making mention of thee always in my
[37:14] prayers
[37:17] so this speaks even greater to the
[37:20] relationship so although we are hearing
[37:23] this name philemon for the first time
[37:26] here
[37:27] it means that this filament character
[37:30] was of such importance to paul
[37:33] that paul is making an open declaration
[37:35] to us to the world to anybody who could
[37:37] read the bible and to philamon himself
[37:40] because this letter would find itself
[37:42] into philemon's hands
[37:44] that paul was
[37:46] always making mention of this brother
[37:50] so this is a trusted friend a close
[37:53] friend of paul
[37:55] all right
[37:56] and paul goes on hearing of thy love and
[37:59] faith
[38:01] which thou has towards the lord jesus
[38:04] and towards all scenes
[38:06] so it is very clear that this brother
[38:08] has a testimony
[38:11] he has a real testimony in the amplified
[38:14] he says i thank my god always making
[38:16] mention of you in my prayers because i
[38:18] hear of your love and of your feet
[38:21] which you have towards the lord jesus
[38:23] christ and to all the scenes so so it
[38:26] was it wasn't something that philemon
[38:28] was speaking about himself
[38:31] philemon's life had such a thunder that
[38:34] word would get back to paul
[38:36] about the way philemon lived anybody
[38:38] with me
[38:40] so philemon's life had such an impact
[38:43] on those around all right because so
[38:45] word rich paul so it wasn't philemon
[38:47] testifying of this what i'm doing and
[38:49] it's how i help and this is who i help
[38:51] and this is what i do for the saints
[38:53] it was such an impactful life that
[38:56] philemon lived
[38:58] that word got back to paul about the
[39:00] life of philemon
[39:03] so he says hearing of thy love that's
[39:05] powerful and feat which thou has towards
[39:08] the lord jesus and toward all sins
[39:10] that the communication of thy faith
[39:14] may become effectual by the
[39:16] acknowledging of every good thing which
[39:19] is in you in christ jesus
[39:21] let's read that in the amplified
[39:24] he said i pray that the sharing of your
[39:26] feet in other words as you continue to
[39:30] share your feet it may become more
[39:32] effective
[39:34] and powerful listen carefully because of
[39:37] your accurate knowledge
[39:40] of every good thing which is ours in
[39:42] christ
[39:44] so
[39:44] paul is painting an incredible picture
[39:48] not just to us
[39:50] about philemon but bearing in mind he is
[39:52] writing to philharmonia
[39:55] so imagine you are in your home and you
[39:57] get a letter from paul and paul is
[39:59] speaking to you about you and this is
[40:02] the greeting
[40:03] isn't this a powerful testimony is this
[40:05] a life because this is not a brother
[40:07] talking about philomoney this is the
[40:09] apostle paul a stanley right hand of god
[40:11] speaking about him right
[40:15] verse 7
[40:18] for we have great joy now bearing in
[40:20] mind for context
[40:22] paul is in prison right in this thing
[40:28] and instead of writing a letter here to
[40:30] a church he's writing to an individual
[40:32] because this matter is of such critical
[40:35] importance
[40:36] that he's writing in prison
[40:39] to address this matter here all right
[40:42] let's go
[40:45] for we have great joy
[40:47] and consolation in thy love
[40:50] because the bowels of the scenes are
[40:52] refreshed by thee brother
[40:55] so paul
[40:58] is
[40:59] beginning to
[41:01] it is it is such a craft of words and
[41:04] literature and because paul is writing
[41:07] to do something he's not just writing a
[41:09] letter because he want to keep bringing
[41:11] compliments to his brother
[41:13] he wants to
[41:14] position a certain thing to him all
[41:16] right so i want us to go
[41:18] verse seven again in the amplified for i
[41:20] have had great joy
[41:22] and comfort
[41:24] and encouragement from your love
[41:27] because the hearts of the sins god's
[41:29] people have been refreshed through you
[41:32] my brother
[41:34] what a powerful statement
[41:36] can somebody say that the heart of these
[41:38] sins have been refreshed through you
[41:42] this from verse 1
[41:44] to verse 7
[41:46] itself is a powerful
[41:49] goal or an objective or a description
[41:53] that any of us could aspire to
[41:56] anybody with me
[42:01] now this is where it gets a bit
[42:02] interesting
[42:05] verse eight
[42:08] this is where paul switches
[42:11] this is paul where he gets the real
[42:13] reason he's writing the letter verse 1
[42:16] to verse 7
[42:18] is trying to put
[42:20] brother philemon in the spirit
[42:23] this is like the song service
[42:25] this is trying to set the atmosphere
[42:27] this is trying to he wanted to address
[42:30] the real issue but you have to know
[42:33] church you have to know friends
[42:35] sometimes there are things you want to
[42:36] address and you can't just go into it
[42:38] right away
[42:39] paul had enough wisdom to spend seven
[42:41] verses
[42:42] trying to set the tone
[42:44] because philemon don't know
[42:46] what really coming food in this letter
[42:49] and as we go deeper into this study he
[42:51] would have been in a certain state of
[42:53] mind when his letter hit him
[42:56] all right he would have been in a
[42:57] certain state of mind he would have been
[42:59] feeling a certain kind of way
[43:01] when this letter got into his hands all
[43:03] right
[43:04] so but this verse here for me as a as a
[43:08] transition verse is one of the most
[43:10] mind-blowing and it's where i said that
[43:13] paul didn't reference his apostleship in
[43:16] verse one as he did many times
[43:19] and this is where he underscores
[43:21] the reason why he's not even referencing
[43:24] his apostleship
[43:25] and i want us to listen carefully he
[43:27] said wherefore
[43:29] now that word wherefore is a is a bridge
[43:32] it could also be therefore in the
[43:33] amplified it says therefore all right
[43:36] though i might be much bold in christ so
[43:40] though though i wanted to get this
[43:42] though i might be bold though i could
[43:44] have confidence in christ
[43:46] in the amplified it says therefore on
[43:49] the basis of these facts in other words
[43:51] on the basis of everything i said before
[43:54] and that's why i call this paul defends
[43:56] a criminal because this entire thing is
[43:59] like it's like a lawyer presenting a
[44:01] case
[44:02] and he's building into something so he
[44:04] said therefore on the basis of these
[44:06] facts on brother your testimony i know
[44:10] you love these scenes i know you have a
[44:12] heart pleasing people annoys me
[44:14] refreshingly brethren i know you have a
[44:16] house in it you choose yours you have
[44:18] the believers over and and only hearing
[44:21] good things about you
[44:23] therefore on the basis of these facts
[44:25] though i have enough confidence in
[44:28] christ and i'm really amplified here to
[44:30] order you to do what is appropriate
[44:34] i want to secure jesse and i'll
[44:35] carefully all right so in the king james
[44:38] it says wherefore though i might be much
[44:41] bored in christ to enjoin
[44:43] and join means to instruct or to order
[44:46] or to command so paul is saying although
[44:49] i have the authority
[44:50] catch this now to command you
[44:55] that which is convenient this is not
[44:57] convenient to philemon
[45:00] this is convenient to paul
[45:03] catch this now right so do i have the
[45:05] authority the god-given spiritual
[45:08] authority
[45:09] though i am an apostle do i have the
[45:11] order and and this is this here is a
[45:14] great lesson on leadership right here
[45:18] i could spend all the time in this one
[45:20] listening interverse 9 to know so paul
[45:22] is saying wherefore though i might be
[45:24] much bored in christ to enjoin thee or
[45:28] order thee or instruct thee or command
[45:31] thee that which is convenient or
[45:33] appropriate
[45:35] yet for love's sake
[45:37] i rather be chd
[45:40] that is real big man talking so paul is
[45:42] saying i have the right by virtue of my
[45:46] office by virtue of my ministry by
[45:49] virtue of my boldness in christ to
[45:52] command you to do something
[45:55] but i much prefer to come to you
[45:57] different
[45:58] so paul is using persuasion he's using
[46:01] negotiation he is using influence he
[46:04] actually puts down his pastoral
[46:06] authority his apostleship authority his
[46:08] eldership authority his deacon authority
[46:12] he is
[46:13] not creating a situation where he could
[46:15] even be accused of abusing his power
[46:19] even though he has power
[46:21] this is a star in the right hand of god
[46:24] that has the ability to give an
[46:26] instruction to a brother
[46:28] but instead of making it an instruction
[46:33] he says i rather come to you with love
[46:36] i want you to catch this
[46:39] i want us to ponder this a little bit
[46:42] you know how much times you have the
[46:44] ability or the right or the authority to
[46:47] do certain things and there's nothing
[46:49] wrong with exercising your authority you
[46:51] know
[46:52] but paul is showing us here at the same
[46:54] time there are other ways
[46:56] to get to what you want to get
[46:59] so you might be the head of your home
[47:02] but you don't have to use the head or
[47:03] home big stick all the time
[47:05] to get what you want to get
[47:07] because you could use multiple ways
[47:09] because the issue paul was showing here
[47:11] is i really want a result i really want
[47:13] an outcome i really come into you for
[47:15] something and i could make it an
[47:17] instruction or i could appeal to you in
[47:20] a different kind of way anybody with me
[47:24] so for people who want to study
[47:25] influence and negotiation and persuasion
[47:29] this is parenting at work
[47:32] this is a parent who could say
[47:35] do it because i say so or let's have a
[47:38] conversation you know you're like you
[47:41] know you're organized person
[47:43] you know it has packed things away so
[47:45] why you don't want to make up why would
[47:46] you want to better be looking like that
[47:48] i mean i mean
[47:50] you could tell them to make up your bed
[47:51] but is there another way is there
[47:52] another approach
[47:55] so paul and i want us to see paul this
[47:57] is this is this is paul this is not a
[48:00] brother
[48:02] this is paul the apostle with every and
[48:05] he is making it clear i am in my right
[48:08] to order you
[48:10] now friends
[48:12] this is not just about paul
[48:15] doing another way it is also very
[48:17] humbling for paulinho
[48:19] paul
[48:20] is actually placing himself in a
[48:22] position of humility
[48:24] to reach this brother he is actually
[48:27] taking off his apostleship garment
[48:30] and sitting down brother to brother with
[48:32] this to reason with the brother
[48:35] anybody with me
[48:37] sometimes we need to change our seats
[48:40] to have the real effect we want to have
[48:43] oh god somebody help me tonight
[48:45] sometimes we have to get off the chair
[48:47] of being the boss or the leader
[48:50] to be able to to have the impact we want
[48:53] to have to bring the real change we want
[48:55] to bring because
[48:57] there are times to give orders and in
[48:59] throughout multiple scriptures paul
[49:01] gives many instructions in fact the
[49:04] majority of paul's teaching was
[49:06] instructive
[49:08] he would rebuke he would instruct he
[49:10] would guide a lot of his teaching was
[49:13] that way but this is different
[49:16] this is personal this is in the home now
[49:19] this is the the wife speaking to the
[49:21] children and the husband speaking of the
[49:23] wife and dealing with the in-laws and
[49:25] dealing with
[49:26] is there a better way
[49:28] that's the question that i want to come
[49:30] on to this i know you have the authority
[49:32] i know you're paying the bills in your
[49:34] house i know that you're i know all
[49:36] these things i know you're older i know
[49:38] you have i know but is there a better
[49:40] way for a minute
[49:42] can you
[49:43] take a different seat
[49:45] to look eye to eye with somebody to help
[49:47] them through their struggle
[49:49] because for paul to even approach
[49:52] solomon this way
[49:55] we heard philemon's resume you know do i
[49:58] need to remind us that this brother was
[50:00] having the church in his home do i need
[50:01] to remind us that his love was broadcast
[50:04] and his faith was broadcast and he had
[50:06] an accurate knowledge of the word but
[50:09] this brother philemon also had some
[50:11] issues oh my my my although the church
[50:14] was in his home he had some issues
[50:16] although his fate was spoken about he
[50:18] had some issues
[50:20] and paul didn't want to come and hit
[50:22] this man in his head about the issues he
[50:25] wanted to speak to him heart to heart
[50:27] like how god wants to speak to us
[50:29] tonight heart a heart and god didn't
[50:31] just stay up in heaven to speak down to
[50:33] us he dropped down to it anybody with me
[50:36] tonight anybody see any parallel here
[50:39] all right that he didn't stay up in
[50:40] glory but he took the form of man to be
[50:43] just like us
[50:44] and here it is paul exactly typing out
[50:47] christ
[50:48] coming down from his office as it were
[50:51] into a brother to brother kinsman
[50:53] relationship can i can i can i go a
[50:56] little bit kinsman relationship with
[50:58] this man so he could speak his language
[51:01] and relate to him one-on-one anybody
[51:03] with me tonight
[51:05] so let's go
[51:06] wherefore though i might be much bold in
[51:09] christ
[51:10] to enjoin thee that which is convenient
[51:14] and in the amplified i want to nail it
[51:16] down therefore on the basis of these
[51:18] facts all the facts are laid between
[51:21] chapter 1 to chapter 7
[51:24] on the basis of this foundation my
[51:26] understanding of who you are my
[51:28] knowledge of your pedigree my
[51:30] understanding of your fate and your love
[51:33] and your commitment and your accurate
[51:35] doctrine and all these things though i
[51:36] have enough confidence in christ to
[51:39] order you to do what is appropriate
[51:42] yet for love's sake
[51:44] i prefer to appeal to you
[51:53] yet for love's sake i rather besiege
[51:55] thee and listen to how low
[51:58] and i'm usually what law paul is willing
[52:00] to get
[52:02] paul is appealing to this man philemon
[52:04] on multiple levels he's saying yet for
[52:07] love's sake i'd rather be chd so not
[52:10] only am i giving up my power i want a
[52:13] psychiatrist not only am i giving up the
[52:16] card my wrong card not only am i giving
[52:19] up the authority i have in other words
[52:21] i've taken up the uniform i've taken all
[52:23] the police uniform i've taken off the
[52:25] deacon uniform so not only am i taking
[52:28] up the uniform
[52:30] i'd rather besiege the being such and
[52:33] one as poorly aged so paul is saying the
[52:36] filament and not just committee as an
[52:38] apostle but committed as an old man paul
[52:42] you see the level of appeal trying to
[52:44] appeal here so whatever so i want us to
[52:46] appreciate the fact church
[52:48] that
[52:49] what
[52:50] what could it possibly be
[52:53] that could cause paul
[52:55] to write a letter where he's stripping
[52:58] not just as rank away but he's saying oh
[53:01] gosh how about the old man
[53:05] give her all manner opportunity help
[53:07] this is so he's saying being one as
[53:10] poorly aged and now also a prisoner of
[53:14] jesus christ
[53:17] this prison of jesus christ in the
[53:19] amplified is not just prisoner of jesus
[53:22] christ but is also a prisoner for the
[53:24] sake of jesus christ so paul is saying
[53:27] not only am i appealing to you without
[53:30] my apostleship rank i am appealing to
[53:33] you as an old man who is in prison for
[53:35] the cause of christ
[53:37] anybody with me
[53:39] so paul is layering a case he's layering
[53:43] a level of negotiation
[53:46] now listen friends i want us to
[53:47] appreciate this paul can i come straight
[53:49] out in verse one and say philemon i need
[53:53] you to do so and so on and so on so
[53:56] but friends life is not always that easy
[53:59] paul is putting in some work here
[54:02] because the matter is not just important
[54:04] to be resolved
[54:06] he also understand who he's dealing with
[54:09] for him to take this much effort
[54:12] it also means that philemon wasn't a man
[54:15] who was just easily moved like that
[54:17] anybody could appreciate the context
[54:20] this is paul almost begging for
[54:22] something all right let's go
[54:25] he said i beseech thee
[54:27] beseech is a powerful word
[54:30] in the amplified it says i appeal to you
[54:34] so now this is where paul
[54:36] is no longer from verse one
[54:38] to verse seven
[54:40] he is talking about the man philemon
[54:43] his relationship with god
[54:45] his his poor relationship with the man
[54:48] between verses eight
[54:50] to verse 9
[54:52] he is talking about
[54:53] how paul himself is lowering himself to
[54:56] now make the plea for the case
[55:00] he say i beseech thee
[55:03] for my son onisimos
[55:10] in the amplifier it says i appeal to you
[55:14] appeal is a strong word
[55:17] this is not
[55:18] asked he is pleading here he said i
[55:22] beseech you
[55:24] i beseech you i appeal to you for my own
[55:27] in the amplified spiritual
[55:30] child
[55:31] onesimus
[55:33] whom i have fathered in defeat
[55:36] while a captive in these scenes
[55:38] anybody with me tonight so
[55:41] to bring context to this and we're going
[55:44] to pick it up as we kind of go through
[55:45] it
[55:48] this onisimos i need to sort of stop
[55:52] here to fill in the gap because this is
[55:54] a personal letter dealing with a
[55:56] personal issue that affects paul's
[55:58] actual life his well-being his
[56:00] relationship is status it affects
[56:02] philemon and it affects us all
[56:06] this
[56:07] onisimos
[56:09] was a slave
[56:12] a bond servant a slave
[56:15] of philemon
[56:18] he ran away
[56:21] not just ran away but he took some stuff
[56:25] when he ran away
[56:27] now we need to appreciate the fact
[56:30] that in those days
[56:33] a couple things are important
[56:35] it's from a historical perspective so i
[56:37] want to
[56:38] rewind a little bit to bring us back up
[56:39] to the present
[56:42] it's very few times
[56:45] sisters are dressed in scripture we all
[56:47] females are just a scripture
[56:49] but it's appropriate here because when
[56:51] he says to our beloved or fear that is
[56:53] critical because in those days the woman
[56:56] of the house or the wife of the lord as
[56:59] it were would be responsible for the
[57:01] house and responsible for these slaves
[57:03] i want us to also appreciate the fact
[57:06] that in those days it's different from
[57:08] our day you can become a slave because
[57:11] you owe the debt
[57:12] and because you owed a debt
[57:15] you would have to silve
[57:18] as a slave until the debt is repealed
[57:21] there were quite a number of ways you
[57:23] could have ended up in this bond servant
[57:26] type of situation
[57:28] we don't know what led to onesimus
[57:33] being in this particular situation
[57:37] but the reality is in those days and if
[57:40] you study the history of these things
[57:42] [Music]
[57:43] just doing something wrong
[57:45] as a bond servant or as a slave was a
[57:47] death sentence
[57:50] just doing something wrong the worst
[57:52] thing you could do is escape
[57:56] because escape was almost an immediate
[57:58] death sentence
[58:01] now i want to begin to understand the
[58:03] context of the situation
[58:05] because if somebody
[58:06] escaped and they are recovered
[58:09] if you don't treat with the matter
[58:12] it opens the door to everybody escaping
[58:16] that would have been what existed in
[58:17] that day i want us to also appreciate
[58:19] the fact that when you listen to paul's
[58:21] teaching he said whether bond or free
[58:24] jew or gentile so paul was preaching to
[58:27] a bunch of people with a bunch of
[58:29] different different backgrounds
[58:32] you would recall that paul went into one
[58:34] city one time and they in that city
[58:38] i preached this before every single
[58:40] place had a god attached to it
[58:43] and they are the temple of this god and
[58:45] temple of this god in temple of this god
[58:47] and that's why paul will make references
[58:49] because he knew who he was addressing
[58:51] when he went to one place
[58:52] because they were so scared
[58:55] of having a god they forgot
[58:57] they named the temple of of the unnamed
[58:59] god the one who they know in him
[59:02] and paul started preaching them and said
[59:03] well hey that temple here for the god
[59:06] who have no name i know you're naming
[59:07] them
[59:08] the one that if you don't know who he is
[59:10] i know he is so paul was really skillful
[59:14] at dealing with issues and matters that
[59:16] were relevant to the audience he was
[59:18] dealing with
[59:20] this brother philemon would have been
[59:22] tied to the group in the colossian
[59:25] church that's where he would have been
[59:26] from
[59:27] so there were certain
[59:30] national issues being addressed certain
[59:32] spiritual issues being addressed but the
[59:34] bottom line is
[59:36] there was a penalty
[59:38] that would have been required
[59:42] if a runaway bond servant or slave had
[59:46] run away
[59:47] and was captured
[59:49] and worse said was brought back
[59:51] anybody with me
[59:53] so
[59:54] whatever transpired was enough that
[59:57] although this brother philemon
[59:59] was doing everything he could there was
[1:00:02] clearly some issues that was so deep
[1:00:05] that paul had to lead to this whole
[1:00:09] letter
[1:00:11] to start to plead for this oneismus
[1:00:14] let's go a little further
[1:00:16] verse 10.
[1:00:19] he said i be cg for my son onisimos whom
[1:00:22] i have begotten in my bond so however it
[1:00:25] was
[1:00:26] that onisimos left policy
[1:00:29] he ends up in rome he ends up in the
[1:00:32] same prison
[1:00:34] with paul
[1:00:36] what uh what are interesting events
[1:00:39] not just ends up in prison with paul
[1:00:42] but this bond servant this runaway slave
[1:00:45] this what would be deemed a criminal
[1:00:49] on multiple levels because he would have
[1:00:52] stolen from
[1:00:54] philemon
[1:00:55] and the penalty of stealing had a
[1:00:57] consequence he would have run away and
[1:00:59] broke his oath broke his contract
[1:01:01] whatever reason he was in the first
[1:01:03] place
[1:01:04] and he happens to wind up if if in
[1:01:07] anybody prisoner end up your might
[1:01:09] you'll end up in prison with paul
[1:01:10] himself
[1:01:12] and paul is saying here
[1:01:14] in verse 10
[1:01:15] i appeal to you for my own spiritual
[1:01:18] child
[1:01:19] so here he set up now
[1:01:22] this only he was coming back to philemon
[1:01:24] coming back with a known death sentence
[1:01:27] in fact if i was onisimus
[1:01:31] you have to already think twice about
[1:01:32] going back
[1:01:35] so here it is policing i appeal to you
[1:01:37] for my own spiritual child so this
[1:01:40] itself has to be a shock to filament
[1:01:43] because this is not him appealing he's
[1:01:45] not using words sparingly he says in
[1:01:48] verse 10 i beseech thee for my son
[1:01:50] how could paul even be calling this
[1:01:52] runaway tv sunbury
[1:01:55] you see why it took so much verses
[1:01:58] to bridge what philemon's thinking was
[1:02:01] because without question fill a man with
[1:02:03] a father's
[1:02:04] mindset about this runaway slave this
[1:02:08] good for nothing slave anybody with me
[1:02:10] all right
[1:02:12] i'll be seated for my son only simmers
[1:02:14] whom i have begotten in my bonds so paul
[1:02:18] is saying i have fired any feet i have
[1:02:21] taken him under my wings although i was
[1:02:23] in prison
[1:02:25] he has been begotten he has had a new
[1:02:27] experience with me in prison
[1:02:29] anybody with me
[1:02:32] listen to verse 11
[1:02:34] which in time pass
[1:02:36] today
[1:02:37] was to be unprofitable
[1:02:41] so paul is saying this onisimos
[1:02:44] and in fact the name onisi actually
[1:02:47] means profitable
[1:02:51] the name onisimos actually the root name
[1:02:54] actually means profitable so in writing
[1:02:57] this letter paul
[1:02:59] is actually using a play on words
[1:03:02] to really appeal to philemon he's seeing
[1:03:05] which in time pass he didn't live up to
[1:03:07] his name he was unprofitable but now
[1:03:11] profitable to thee and to me
[1:03:15] you see how powerful this is
[1:03:17] now i call it poor defensive criminal
[1:03:19] so you see in this what was once
[1:03:21] unprofitable in other words he's saying
[1:03:24] the unprofitability of this man was due
[1:03:26] to the fact that he was not of our
[1:03:28] covenant
[1:03:29] so paul going beyond the fact that he
[1:03:32] was a bond servant
[1:03:34] paul is saying in the past he was
[1:03:36] unprofitable but now
[1:03:38] this is not a unprofitable
[1:03:41] unuseful
[1:03:42] no value person he is not profitable to
[1:03:45] be unto me
[1:03:49] verse 12
[1:03:51] whom i have sent again so verse 12 in
[1:03:55] the amplified says i have sent him back
[1:03:57] to you in person
[1:03:58] now on this has multiple levels here is
[1:04:02] paul
[1:04:03] not even though
[1:04:06] onisimas has been changed
[1:04:09] he wants onisimos to go back
[1:04:13] because you did something wrong
[1:04:15] you can't just say well i fell asleep
[1:04:17] now with paul
[1:04:19] you need to go and make it right
[1:04:22] so i need you to go back
[1:04:25] and patch up things with brother
[1:04:27] philemon
[1:04:28] so onisi must have to overcome his own
[1:04:31] personal issues
[1:04:33] i want you to see the amount of stuff
[1:04:35] happening here in this letter right
[1:04:37] paul
[1:04:38] have to know the man for the money the
[1:04:40] limits
[1:04:41] paul have to know what onisimo's fear it
[1:04:44] has to be because onesimus has to have a
[1:04:46] lot of faith
[1:04:47] because oneismus is the one who is going
[1:04:49] back with this
[1:04:52] letter so he is potentially walking into
[1:04:56] i'm going home
[1:04:58] not knowing what the outcome will be
[1:05:01] but they're going in fit
[1:05:03] just to plead to better filament but i
[1:05:05] just really like to really just read it
[1:05:06] before you do it just read this just
[1:05:07] remember the poll if your love would
[1:05:08] apparently read this letter
[1:05:11] and brother philemon would have to read
[1:05:13] the verses and shake his head a little
[1:05:15] bit you know
[1:05:17] you know at the philharmonic or daddy
[1:05:18] beloved for the laborer and to you know
[1:05:21] and he said come on a little bit an
[1:05:22] octopus and a fellow soldier at the
[1:05:24] church in my house okay grace be to you
[1:05:27] i thank my god making mention of you it
[1:05:29] was my prayer and are he calming down
[1:05:32] whatever interaction
[1:05:34] philemon would have had upon seeing this
[1:05:36] onisimos anybody with me
[1:05:39] is is this is this is this interesting
[1:05:41] to anybody tonight
[1:05:44] so
[1:05:45] we in verse 12
[1:05:46] whom i have sent again thou therefore
[1:05:48] receive him
[1:05:50] so
[1:05:51] paul is pleading to philemon receive him
[1:05:53] receive him receive him
[1:05:55] receive him that is my own bowels it
[1:05:59] says in the in the king james version
[1:06:01] in the amplified it says i have sent him
[1:06:03] back to you in person that is like
[1:06:05] sending my very heart
[1:06:08] so whatever relationship paul had with
[1:06:11] onyssimus was so significant
[1:06:14] that he's saying i'm not just sending
[1:06:15] him baccano but sending him
[1:06:18] is like sending my own hat in other
[1:06:20] words
[1:06:21] i actually don't even want to send him
[1:06:23] back to you i want us to catch this
[1:06:28] i'm sending him back because he has to
[1:06:30] make things right but i'm actually
[1:06:32] sending him back it's actually hurting
[1:06:34] my heart because he has become such a
[1:06:36] close friend to me
[1:06:39] you see how deep this thing is
[1:06:43] verse 13
[1:06:44] and paul says it clearly no whom i would
[1:06:47] have retained with me
[1:06:50] so paul is saying i am reluctantly
[1:06:52] sending him back
[1:06:54] because i would really want to keep him
[1:06:56] with me
[1:06:59] so whatever bond was formed in prison
[1:07:02] between paul and onesimus was so
[1:07:05] significant that paul had to overlook
[1:07:08] the fact that he wanted only us to stay
[1:07:11] with him
[1:07:12] but he knew that for once he must walk
[1:07:15] to be right with god only must have to
[1:07:18] go back to make things right with
[1:07:20] philemon but this was also free in
[1:07:23] philemon because philemon had issues in
[1:07:25] his heart against this runaway thief
[1:07:28] this criminal
[1:07:29] that was also hindering suleiman
[1:07:33] from his own spiritual maturity
[1:07:36] so paul have to
[1:07:37] sacrifice
[1:07:39] only he must have to sacrifice and
[1:07:41] filament have to sacrifice
[1:07:44] for paul it's sending his own very heart
[1:07:46] somebody he has grown close to with
[1:07:49] chains around his feet anybody hear me
[1:07:52] tonight somebody has grown close to with
[1:07:54] chains around his hands somebody who has
[1:07:56] been such a comfort to him that he feels
[1:07:59] lost without his brother being around
[1:08:01] so he has to sacrifice only simon was
[1:08:04] ready ready not happy to go back i mean
[1:08:06] no matter how
[1:08:08] what you've been through when you see
[1:08:09] mother looking to go back into what you
[1:08:12] ran away from is he escaped
[1:08:16] but unesco must have to die to his
[1:08:17] feeling die to his fears die to it and
[1:08:20] go back and philemon now gets to
[1:08:22] confront just like the older brother in
[1:08:25] the story of the prodigal son how would
[1:08:28] i respond now
[1:08:30] to this person coming back to me
[1:08:33] what is the expected response against
[1:08:36] the backdrop of paul saying to treat
[1:08:38] this man different
[1:08:40] anybody with me
[1:08:42] anybody trying to see how much lessons
[1:08:43] in this one chapter and and and maybe
[1:08:46] per adventure why this thing is in the
[1:08:48] word for us right so paul is making it
[1:08:50] very clear he's not mincing words whom i
[1:08:52] would have retained with me
[1:08:55] and he further listen he just keep
[1:08:56] appealing to the philharmonia verse 13
[1:09:00] whom
[1:09:01] i would have retained with me that in
[1:09:03] thy said
[1:09:04] he might have ministered unto me in the
[1:09:07] bond of the gospel so paul is saying i
[1:09:09] would i want to keep on this
[1:09:11] that instead of you
[1:09:13] because i know brother that if you had
[1:09:15] the opportunity to minister to me in the
[1:09:18] bonds of my gospel you were to do it
[1:09:20] you see the appeal
[1:09:22] you see what he writing at him he said
[1:09:24] whom i would have retained unto me that
[1:09:26] in thy state that instead of you coming
[1:09:28] i don't need you to come to minister to
[1:09:30] me in my bondage
[1:09:32] but if i could keep onesimus then it's
[1:09:34] just the same as if you with me because
[1:09:37] i wish you could be here but i know you
[1:09:39] have responsibilities but oh gosh don't
[1:09:41] kill the brother don't chastise your
[1:09:42] brother don't open like a brother bless
[1:09:44] your brother receive him bless him i
[1:09:48] wish i could keep him
[1:09:51] in the amplified it says i would have
[1:09:53] chosen to keep him with me so that he
[1:09:55] might minister to me on your behalf
[1:09:58] during my imprisonment for the gospel
[1:10:04] verse 14
[1:10:06] but without thy mind would i do nothing
[1:10:12] that thy benefit
[1:10:14] should be as it were of necessity
[1:10:17] but willingly in other words
[1:10:20] verse 14 in the amplified
[1:10:22] but i did not want to do anything
[1:10:25] without first getting your consent no
[1:10:27] this is the apostle
[1:10:29] who has the ability to order a response
[1:10:33] he is saying to this brother philemon
[1:10:36] i needed to release
[1:10:38] what you're holding against this man
[1:10:41] you have a right to hold something
[1:10:43] against him as much as i have a right to
[1:10:45] order you as your apostle you see how
[1:10:47] serious
[1:10:48] this is
[1:10:49] i want you to receive him
[1:10:51] because this is my heart
[1:10:53] he is close to me
[1:10:55] and
[1:10:56] the relationship you and i have is so
[1:10:57] powerful
[1:10:58] that even though i wish you gonna be
[1:11:00] here this man being here with me is as
[1:11:02] good as you being here with me
[1:11:04] so treat him as your representative to
[1:11:06] me
[1:11:07] drop your oughts against him
[1:11:09] and he goes on but i don't want to do
[1:11:12] this without you agreeing to doing this
[1:11:15] so i want to make you a party of this
[1:11:18] decision
[1:11:20] verse 14 but i did not want to do
[1:11:22] anything without first getting your
[1:11:23] consent
[1:11:24] so that in other words so you could get
[1:11:26] blessed from it so that your goodness
[1:11:29] would not be by compulsion but of your
[1:11:32] own free will in other words
[1:11:34] i don't want you to just release only
[1:11:36] simon's to me i want you to be genuine
[1:11:38] from your heart
[1:11:41] i don't want you to release him to me
[1:11:42] because i even tell you to do it
[1:11:45] i want you from your heart to agree to
[1:11:48] send him that's verse 14 there right
[1:11:50] without thy mind would i do nothing
[1:11:52] without you being involved in decision
[1:11:54] that thy benefit in other words i want
[1:11:57] you to be blessed
[1:11:59] everybody catch me there i want you to
[1:12:01] be blessed so that is not of necessity
[1:12:05] enough because i've foreseen you but
[1:12:07] willingly listen to verse 15
[1:12:10] and understand this is an apostle this
[1:12:12] is a star this is this is a messenger
[1:12:15] speaking and
[1:12:17] against the backdrop of people who speak
[1:12:20] like this is it and it can be nothing
[1:12:22] else
[1:12:23] this is paul speaking a say for perhaps
[1:12:27] perhaps that word perhaps is deliberate
[1:12:30] paul is still
[1:12:32] persuading he's still influencing he
[1:12:34] said for perhaps
[1:12:36] and biblical scholars said paul in a
[1:12:39] stroke of genius
[1:12:41] stroke of wisdom
[1:12:42] struck up understanding just like
[1:12:44] hebrews 11 just like how god redeemed
[1:12:47] and justified by faith by fear by fear
[1:12:49] by fear by faith here called on his
[1:12:52] siblings i escaped
[1:12:53] he said for perhaps he therefore
[1:12:56] departed for a season
[1:12:59] he polished up the situation
[1:13:02] he said maybe maybe he was the party for
[1:13:05] a season i know you felt aggrieved
[1:13:10] i know you felt you lost something
[1:13:12] i know you felt this thing wasn't right
[1:13:15] but perhaps maybe perhaps maybe perhaps
[1:13:19] he departed for a season
[1:13:21] that thousands receive him forever
[1:13:25] you see how much stuff in this right so
[1:13:27] let's go verse 15.
[1:13:30] perhaps it was for this reason i really
[1:13:32] occupied that he was separated from you
[1:13:34] for a while
[1:13:37] so that you could have him back forever
[1:13:39] and look how paul goes now not now as a
[1:13:43] servant in the amplified in any king
[1:13:46] james
[1:13:46] amplified it says perhaps was for this
[1:13:49] reason that he was separated from you
[1:13:51] for a while so that you would have him
[1:13:54] back forever no longer as a slave
[1:13:58] but as someone more than a slave as a
[1:14:01] brother in christ
[1:14:03] especially dear to me
[1:14:05] but how much more to you
[1:14:08] both in the flesh as a servant and in
[1:14:10] the lord as a fellow
[1:14:12] believer you see how powerful that is
[1:14:16] so in the king james it says
[1:14:18] for perhaps he therefore departed for a
[1:14:20] season that thou should has received him
[1:14:22] forever not now as a servant but above a
[1:14:26] servant
[1:14:27] or in some chances you see one servant
[1:14:29] or slave that's really what it was a
[1:14:31] brother beloved so so he coming back to
[1:14:34] you so i don't want you to treat him the
[1:14:36] way he left you
[1:14:38] so not only appreciate this not only you
[1:14:40] need to forgive the brother
[1:14:42] not only you need to forgive me man but
[1:14:44] forgive the man because
[1:14:46] philemon's experience with this man
[1:14:48] would have been a former man
[1:14:50] the old man
[1:14:52] the man who was a slave the man who ran
[1:14:54] away the man who stole
[1:14:55] anybody with me
[1:14:57] so not only you have to receive him but
[1:15:00] you're receiving him back and i don't
[1:15:01] want your talk no slave thing anymore i
[1:15:03] don't talk don't silver nothing anymore
[1:15:05] i want you to receive him above a
[1:15:07] servant as a brother beloved especially
[1:15:10] to me so not just a brother either a
[1:15:13] brother special to paul so i want you to
[1:15:16] receive him so he's challenging philemon
[1:15:18] to go against
[1:15:20] his tradition against his culture
[1:15:22] against the norm of the day against the
[1:15:25] expectations of the neighbors who save
[1:15:28] awakener dice did i not only see muslims
[1:15:30] run away how come philemon treated him
[1:15:33] so
[1:15:35] what philemon starting to do here what
[1:15:38] filament because if the other people see
[1:15:40] this man who was once a slave sitting on
[1:15:43] the high table
[1:15:44] with philemon what this thing mean but
[1:15:47] this is what paul is setting up he's
[1:15:49] saying above a servant a brother beloved
[1:15:52] especially to me and how much more to be
[1:15:55] brought in the flesh and in the lord
[1:15:58] now listen
[1:16:00] as if everything from verse 1 to 16 is
[1:16:03] not enough
[1:16:05] paul goes into overdrive
[1:16:07] in verse 17. he said if thou count me
[1:16:10] therefore a partner
[1:16:13] this is going now to this is appealing
[1:16:16] and appealing
[1:16:17] so he appealed to his brotherhood he
[1:16:19] appealed to he said look i'm an old man
[1:16:21] he said i'm a man in prison for the sake
[1:16:23] of god i'm a man who need help you can't
[1:16:26] help me what onisima is here helping me
[1:16:28] he said foreign
[1:16:33] so if you consider so forget my
[1:16:36] apostleship forget my age forget the
[1:16:39] fact that i'm in prison forget the fact
[1:16:41] that that that this man was once
[1:16:43] unprofitable to you he was of no use to
[1:16:45] you no benefit to you but now he's a
[1:16:47] benefit to you and to me forget all of
[1:16:50] that
[1:16:50] it's covered in verse 17 he's starting
[1:16:52] afresh
[1:16:54] if thou count me there for a partner
[1:16:57] receive him as myself
[1:17:01] so paul wanted dot every eye cross every
[1:17:04] t
[1:17:05] so it it begs a question brothers and
[1:17:07] sisters
[1:17:09] what did paul discern
[1:17:11] in philemon's heart
[1:17:13] because the biggest part of this thing
[1:17:15] he has forgiveness huh
[1:17:18] because forgiveness is what was going to
[1:17:20] release this man the issues in the heart
[1:17:22] of philadelphia this here is poor
[1:17:25] teaching forgiveness you know
[1:17:27] and trying to get to the root of
[1:17:29] philemon's heart he said after all of
[1:17:32] that if thou count me therefore a
[1:17:33] partner receive him as myself in other
[1:17:35] words treat him as if he's me
[1:17:40] in the amplified
[1:17:42] it says
[1:17:43] so if you consider me a partner
[1:17:45] welcome and accept him as you would me
[1:17:49] so whatever you will give me
[1:17:51] give this man
[1:17:52] that's a big order that's a big order
[1:17:54] it's a big that's a tall order
[1:17:56] treat him as an apostle
[1:17:58] treat him as a messenger treat him as a
[1:18:01] style right hand of god
[1:18:04] even though in your heart you might
[1:18:05] think it was deserving of you have to no
[1:18:08] no no no paul and god true paul is
[1:18:11] saying look at this man with completely
[1:18:13] new eyes
[1:18:14] what a lesson tonight
[1:18:18] you have people i'm sure have wronged
[1:18:20] you in different ways
[1:18:22] this is a letter to you
[1:18:24] to change your eyes
[1:18:26] this brother who was a ministering
[1:18:28] brother had a struggle
[1:18:30] with how he would have seen how he would
[1:18:33] have seen you know you don't know what's
[1:18:35] in you until his situation comes
[1:18:38] paul was preempting the situation
[1:18:40] paul didn't want to wait for the
[1:18:42] situation to happen
[1:18:43] paul knew what his situation would have
[1:18:45] turned into and that warranted this
[1:18:47] letter of protection anybody with me
[1:18:50] and paul stop there no
[1:18:53] he goes on verse 18. if he had wrong v
[1:18:57] so imagine brother thompson imagine with
[1:18:59] a clearance
[1:19:00] after paul say if you consider me a
[1:19:02] partner treat him like me
[1:19:04] after that statement paul goes deeper
[1:19:07] than that and says if he had wronged
[1:19:10] thee
[1:19:10] or owed the ought
[1:19:14] put that on mine account
[1:19:16] so paul saying are not taking no chances
[1:19:20] if it is
[1:19:22] let me write the amplifier but if he has
[1:19:24] wronged you in any way or owes you
[1:19:26] anything charge that to my account so if
[1:19:28] the issue that you have with the brother
[1:19:31] is what he owes you
[1:19:33] what he took from you how he wronged you
[1:19:36] in any way
[1:19:37] don't charge it to his account
[1:19:40] charge it to me
[1:19:42] so paul saying don't ask him for it
[1:19:45] don't raise the subject with him
[1:19:48] raise it with me that's
[1:19:50] this thing this thing is this is a whole
[1:19:53] lesson on christian teaching and conduct
[1:19:55] all right
[1:19:59] verse 19.
[1:20:05] i want you to imagine philemon reading
[1:20:07] this
[1:20:09] and while philharmonic unit is wondering
[1:20:11] about the money transfer
[1:20:14] paul goes on in verse 19. i paul have
[1:20:17] written it with my own hand
[1:20:20] in other words he said i will repeat
[1:20:23] albeit i do not say to thee
[1:20:26] how thou always unto me even thy own
[1:20:29] self besides that there right now is a
[1:20:31] settling point for me
[1:20:33] paul murray amplified he said i paul
[1:20:36] write this in my own hand i will repeat
[1:20:39] in full
[1:20:40] not to mention to you that you owe to me
[1:20:43] even your own self as well in other
[1:20:46] words paul's saying while you adding up
[1:20:48] what does man have for you that i will
[1:20:50] repeat i want to remind you that your
[1:20:52] salvation was through my ministry
[1:21:01] anybody study talk the extent that paul
[1:21:04] so you see paul fighting for his brother
[1:21:06] only
[1:21:07] he actually fighting for this man life
[1:21:10] but you see the level of appeal and and
[1:21:12] the battle and and he is actually taking
[1:21:15] every taught every mind battle that
[1:21:17] philemon would have and just destroying
[1:21:19] it
[1:21:20] the clearly way for brother ornishi was
[1:21:23] to have a clear pathway to redemption
[1:21:25] anybody with me
[1:21:27] could he take a a movie almost done just
[1:21:29] one chapter he's not two not three
[1:21:30] there's one
[1:21:35] i paul i've written it with my own hand
[1:21:37] i will repeat
[1:21:38] albeit i do not say to thee
[1:21:41] paul's saying it without saying it he
[1:21:42] said i don't want to raise up the fact
[1:21:44] that that you owe unto me even your
[1:21:46] whole self
[1:21:47] [Laughter]
[1:21:50] i don't want to i don't want to say get
[1:21:52] down into the fact that it was in the
[1:21:54] service i was preaching that that you
[1:21:55] hadn't experienced you wouldn't we
[1:21:57] wouldn't even be having this
[1:21:59] conversation if it wasn't for for how
[1:22:01] can you even repay me for the effort
[1:22:03] that you label the ministry for you to
[1:22:04] be in a position how could you not hold
[1:22:06] this thing against this brother
[1:22:09] don't call him no slave call him as a
[1:22:11] brother anybody with me
[1:22:17] verse 20
[1:22:19] yeah brother so paul now switches gay
[1:22:21] again
[1:22:22] in this letter yeah brother let me have
[1:22:26] joy of thee in the lord
[1:22:29] now friends this joy here
[1:22:34] in the original translation this joy is
[1:22:37] written with the same root word as only
[1:22:39] seemers
[1:22:41] so this is just like saying let me have
[1:22:43] prophet of thee in the lord in other
[1:22:46] words he's saying let me have this
[1:22:48] brother back in the lord
[1:22:50] refresh my bowels in the lord
[1:22:53] which in the amplified it says refresh
[1:22:55] my heart in christ i don't even remember
[1:22:57] when we go back to
[1:22:59] verse
[1:23:00] it was verse
[1:23:07] verse seven
[1:23:08] for we have great joy and translation in
[1:23:10] thy love because the bowels of the
[1:23:12] saints are refreshed by thee brother
[1:23:14] so paul was repeating a statement
[1:23:17] tied to his early description
[1:23:20] of philemon
[1:23:21] saying the same here is refresh these
[1:23:23] scenes
[1:23:25] i want you to to do the same for me
[1:23:28] yeah brother let me have joy of dean the
[1:23:30] lord refresh my bowers in the lord
[1:23:34] anybody with me be almost done
[1:23:38] verse 21
[1:23:42] having confidence
[1:23:44] oh my word
[1:23:46] paul is
[1:23:47] having confidence in diabetes
[1:23:52] so paul is saying
[1:23:54] paul now started right as if the matter
[1:23:56] settled
[1:23:58] he said having confidence and
[1:23:59] disobedience
[1:24:01] i wrote under thee
[1:24:03] so this whole letter this whole argument
[1:24:05] this whole court case this whole debate
[1:24:08] i didn't write it
[1:24:09] for you to have to think about it
[1:24:12] although i built a case i wrote it fully
[1:24:15] confident that the case i'm presenting
[1:24:17] is already settled or no so having
[1:24:19] confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto
[1:24:22] thee listen listen to the appeal again
[1:24:25] knowing that dog will also do more than
[1:24:28] i say
[1:24:30] so policing not only is my expectation
[1:24:35] that you will honor everything i wrote
[1:24:37] to be settled in this matter but you
[1:24:39] will go beyond my expectation
[1:24:48] in the amplified i write to you
[1:24:49] perfectly confident of your obedient
[1:24:52] compliance
[1:24:54] since i know that you will do even more
[1:24:56] than i ask
[1:24:59] and it goes on but with all with all
[1:25:01] means at the same time
[1:25:03] but with all so
[1:25:05] paul switched the composition now away
[1:25:06] from this whole matter completely
[1:25:09] he say for him that verse 21 settled the
[1:25:13] whole issue yes you're done we we nev we
[1:25:15] as brother he would say we don't talk
[1:25:16] about it already we're not going back we
[1:25:18] don't talk that already we finished with
[1:25:20] that thing he said in the meantime
[1:25:22] prepare me also a login
[1:25:26] in other words i come into your house
[1:25:30] in the amplifier it says at the same
[1:25:31] time also prepare a guest room for me
[1:25:35] in the amplified inexpectation of a
[1:25:38] visit verse 22 but with all prepare me
[1:25:41] also a lodging
[1:25:44] for i trust that listen to this one now
[1:25:47] he switched completely spiritual again
[1:25:49] now for i trust that through your
[1:25:51] prayers i shall be given unto you in
[1:25:53] other words
[1:25:54] not just prepare a room at all but if
[1:25:57] there's anything will get me out of this
[1:25:58] prison is your prayers
[1:26:00] so i want you to
[1:26:02] settle up these natural issues very
[1:26:03] quickly
[1:26:04] and get to preparing a room for me and
[1:26:07] get to praying because it's only your
[1:26:09] prayers will take me out of this prison
[1:26:11] oh lord help me jesus
[1:26:13] anybody seeing this is on so many levels
[1:26:16] it is so inspiring so mind-blowing
[1:26:20] for i trust that through your prayers i
[1:26:23] shall be given unto you
[1:26:26] and he writes he closing their salute
[1:26:29] thee epaphras
[1:26:31] my fellow prisoner in christ jesus
[1:26:34] in other words he's saying greetings to
[1:26:36] you from brother e papras my fellow
[1:26:39] prisoner in christ jesus marcus
[1:26:41] aristachus demus lucas my fellow
[1:26:45] laborers in other words these brothers
[1:26:47] who are with me
[1:26:48] they're in the loop on this letter
[1:26:51] so they're sending greetings because
[1:26:52] they know i write in you like that's
[1:26:54] what this mean here so this is like this
[1:26:56] is like a ps
[1:26:58] then mine these brothers get in carbon
[1:27:01] copy and there's little
[1:27:02] so if you're thinking a remigan on
[1:27:04] anything
[1:27:05] this letter
[1:27:07] getting cc epocharus carbon copy marcus
[1:27:11] cap on copy brother aristarchus carbon
[1:27:14] copy by the demons brother lucas my
[1:27:16] fellow laborers everybody sending their
[1:27:18] greetings because they're here
[1:27:20] along with brother timothy who was in
[1:27:22] prison
[1:27:23] all of them are aware that is this
[1:27:25] letter coming to you because all of them
[1:27:27] know about brother onisimo's any role
[1:27:29] that he plays in my life anybody with me
[1:27:32] the grace of our lord
[1:27:36] jesus christ
[1:27:39] be with your spirit amen
[1:27:42] written from rome to filament by
[1:27:44] onisimus
[1:27:46] a servant i trust this has been a
[1:27:49] inspiration to you
[1:27:51] we will find out more about it by and by
[1:27:54] but history history
[1:27:56] records
[1:27:58] an
[1:27:58] onissimus was pastor in ephesus
[1:28:03] it is interesting to note
[1:28:05] that it is said that after timothy
[1:28:08] was no longer the pastor of the
[1:28:10] ephesians church
[1:28:12] the next pastor who came after ephesus
[1:28:14] was named onisimos i can't say if it's
[1:28:16] the same unisimos
[1:28:18] but it will be interesting to note that
[1:28:20] it was a brother who was named onision
[1:28:23] who took over the ministry from timothy
[1:28:28] so if that is in fact the case
[1:28:30] then it even raises the significance of
[1:28:33] this letter
[1:28:34] because this letter would be that known
[1:28:36] to them about the slave who became
[1:28:38] bishop in ephesus
[1:28:40] by virtue of his relationship with
[1:28:42] philemon and meeting paul in prison and
[1:28:46] being mentored on nepal being known to
[1:28:48] timothy it is just such a powerful story
[1:28:51] and a testimony to us but i trust
[1:28:53] tonight there is one chapter would
[1:28:56] highlight something to you to inspire
[1:28:58] you in some way i found this to be a
[1:29:00] deep teaching on forgiveness
[1:29:02] on breaking biases
[1:29:04] on breaking norms and expectation that
[1:29:07] would have been held there
[1:29:08] of discovering issues
[1:29:10] in
[1:29:11] philemon that he may not even be aware
[1:29:13] that he had
[1:29:14] that paul must have been able to see
[1:29:17] but the deeper thing for me is
[1:29:19] and and this kind of brings together to
[1:29:22] me what makes it so powerful most of us
[1:29:24] friends don't want to do the work
[1:29:29] i was sharing with somebody this one
[1:29:31] morning you want to be a pilot
[1:29:34] you can't get up in the morning and be a
[1:29:36] pilot
[1:29:37] you need to go and train for this thing
[1:29:39] there's a process you can't bypass the
[1:29:42] process you want to be a doctor you just
[1:29:44] say i feel in doctor-ish you have to go
[1:29:47] and get trained you have to put in you
[1:29:50] work
[1:29:51] you want to be an engineer you have to
[1:29:53] put in you work you want to be a great
[1:29:56] husband you have to put in your work you
[1:29:59] want to be a great christian you have to
[1:30:01] put in your work
[1:30:03] what this one chapter highlights to me
[1:30:06] is that paul was able to not only humble
[1:30:10] himself from his office of apostleship
[1:30:14] but he was prepared to put in the work
[1:30:17] for the sake of his brother
[1:30:21] he didn't leave it by chance he took his
[1:30:23] time
[1:30:25] planned
[1:30:26] wrote express the issues
[1:30:29] think about what else will philemon say
[1:30:31] boy
[1:30:32] if this brother come
[1:30:35] and he writes if you consider me your
[1:30:37] partner
[1:30:38] you're right he was unprofitable to you
[1:30:40] and always profitable he writes i need
[1:30:42] him you write if he owe you i will pay
[1:30:44] it he he covered almost every possible
[1:30:47] base and then say well i'm gonna cap it
[1:30:49] off by saying i know you will do the
[1:30:51] right thing
[1:30:52] and he said just in case never write
[1:30:53] again all them brothers who he know are
[1:30:56] accurate letters send their greetings
[1:30:58] because he wanted to fight for the case
[1:31:00] are you willing to work for this thing
[1:31:03] are you willing to put in the work
[1:31:10] if there's any question i'll leave you
[1:31:11] within tonight are you willing to put in
[1:31:15] your work
[1:31:16] can we pray
[1:31:18] all this heavenly father we thank you
[1:31:20] tonight for your love for your grace for
[1:31:21] your mercy
[1:31:23] and for our time to just look at
[1:31:25] paul's role as it were as a lawyer
[1:31:28] defending a man
[1:31:30] who had done wrong
[1:31:32] not just done wrong
[1:31:34] but he was defending a man who had done
[1:31:36] wrong
[1:31:37] and was making it right
[1:31:40] he was dealing with his own life
[1:31:43] and the impact in his life by this
[1:31:45] brother who came into his life he would
[1:31:47] have come into that prison a certain way
[1:31:50] running for his life
[1:31:52] his own baggage his own issues
[1:31:54] and however that transpired
[1:31:56] paul and this man had a conversation and
[1:31:58] they built a bond and before you know it
[1:32:01] unistimus was changed and transformed no
[1:32:04] doubt they would have had conversations
[1:32:06] in the bonds of captivity
[1:32:08] about life about history about their
[1:32:10] past about their future but their hopes
[1:32:12] about their dreams about their
[1:32:13] aspirations
[1:32:15] and however it unfolded
[1:32:17] uh had the opportunity
[1:32:20] to walk the streets
[1:32:22] and he could have gone left and paul
[1:32:24] said to him no you need to go back and
[1:32:26] make things right take this letter with
[1:32:28] you but it's not going to be easy but
[1:32:31] going to put some stuff in there to help
[1:32:33] bridge the gap
[1:32:36] it's a deep
[1:32:37] thought
[1:32:39] about being in a position to forgive or
[1:32:42] to hold out
[1:32:44] and philemon was in a position to
[1:32:45] forgive for the whole lords
[1:32:48] paul was in a position to
[1:32:50] use his rank card
[1:32:52] or to appeal we are confronted every day
[1:32:54] with decisions father
[1:32:56] but help us to put in the work
[1:32:59] to be more flexible as paul said to the
[1:33:01] strong i became strong to the weak i
[1:33:03] became weak
[1:33:04] lord help us
[1:33:06] to put in the work
[1:33:08] to plead for our families our children
[1:33:10] to take another perspective
[1:33:12] to look at it from another angle
[1:33:14] for the end game or the goal of
[1:33:17] redemption of restoration of
[1:33:19] reconciliation
[1:33:22] paul reminded philemon
[1:33:25] of
[1:33:26] philemon's own jury
[1:33:28] that he can hold anything over anybody
[1:33:31] because he was once a slave
[1:33:33] he was once a prisoner and had it not
[1:33:35] been for the truth of the gospel
[1:33:38] through paul's ministry philippines
[1:33:40] wouldn't know this truth
[1:33:41] how can we hold anything against anybody
[1:33:44] else if it was in the grace of god
[1:33:46] in every letter paul wrote he spoke
[1:33:49] about grace and peace and grace and
[1:33:52] peace and grace and peace father as we
[1:33:54] leave the session tonight may we come to
[1:33:57] know
[1:33:57] the person of grace
[1:33:59] and the person of peace
[1:34:01] and the virtue of our age of forgiveness
[1:34:04] that was a requirement in this chapter
[1:34:07] because for true reconciliation
[1:34:10] for true brotherhood for true unity
[1:34:12] philemon had to forgive this man
[1:34:15] forget this man's issues
[1:34:17] drop his oughts
[1:34:19] drop the issues
[1:34:21] it would have not been in philharmon to
[1:34:23] go and ask paul paul pay me what this
[1:34:25] man took
[1:34:27] it was not about that it was about
[1:34:28] breaking down
[1:34:30] issues to allow for brotherhood to
[1:34:33] continue
[1:34:34] father may you step into homes tonight
[1:34:36] as this one chapter was the one
[1:34:39] letter that paul walked into somebody
[1:34:41] home into their life to their family to
[1:34:43] deal with the matter walk into our homes
[1:34:46] into our families to deal with the
[1:34:47] matters the issues
[1:34:49] that exist in our homes between family
[1:34:51] members between situations between those
[1:34:53] who are wrong one another so that true
[1:34:56] reconciliation could come help us father
[1:34:59] to be better christians to have a heart
[1:35:01] of love and forgiveness may you bless
[1:35:03] the service tomorrow night may you bless
[1:35:05] the prayer meeting this friday i may you
[1:35:07] bless the church in a special way in the
[1:35:09] precious name of jesus christ amen and
[1:35:12] amen amen may the lord richly bless you
[1:35:14] tonight
[1:35:15] thank you for being a wonderful audience
[1:35:17] and read it again
[1:35:20] study it think about it ponder it and it
[1:35:23] will inspire you may the lord richly
[1:35:25] bless you have a wonderful night
