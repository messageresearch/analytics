[25:31] and the church says
[25:33] amen
[25:35] thank you musicians
[25:37] welcome
[25:38] to the house of the lord this morning
[25:41] if you have your bibles will you turn
[25:43] with me
[25:44] to three portions of scripture
[25:47] reading from genesis chapter 1 reading
[25:50] jeremiah
[25:51] 1 and reading scene luke 17
[25:54] this morning thank you so much for being
[25:57] here
[25:58] those that are here as well those that
[26:00] are connected
[26:01] online we know that god has something
[26:04] special for us today
[26:07] reading genesis 1 and verse 26
[26:11] and god said let us make man in our
[26:14] image
[26:17] after our likeness
[26:19] and let them have dominion
[26:21] over the fish of the sea and over the
[26:23] fowl of the air
[26:24] and over the cattle and all the earth
[26:26] and over every creeping thing that
[26:28] creepeth upon the earth
[26:30] so god created man in his own image
[26:33] in the image of god created he him
[26:36] male and female created he them
[26:39] let's go to jeremiah 1
[26:41] and we're going to go to
[26:43] verse 4.
[26:46] then the word of the lord came unto me
[26:48] saying before i formed thee in the belly
[26:50] i knew thee
[26:53] and before thou came his forth out of
[26:55] the room i sanctified thee
[26:57] and i ordained thee a prophet
[27:00] unto the nations
[27:02] and our last scripture reading saint
[27:04] luke 17 and reading verse
[27:07] 20
[27:09] and when he was demanded of the
[27:10] pharisees when the kingdom of god should
[27:13] come he answered them and said the
[27:15] kingdom of god cometh not with
[27:17] observation
[27:20] neither shall they say lo here although
[27:22] therefore behold the kingdom of god is
[27:24] within you
[27:26] may the lord have a blessing to the
[27:27] reading of his word you may be seated in
[27:30] the presence of the lord this morning
[27:33] how many are happy to be in the house of
[27:35] the lord
[27:36] there's no better place to be than in
[27:38] the house of the lord there's no safer
[27:40] place to be than in the house of the
[27:42] lord there's no happier place to be than
[27:45] in the house of the lord there's no
[27:47] place i'd rather be than in the house of
[27:49] the lord as psalmist david said i was
[27:52] glad
[27:52] when they said unto me let us go into
[27:55] the house of the lord so we are so
[27:57] grateful for his grace for his mercy and
[27:59] for the opportunity to be gathered here
[28:02] this morning
[28:03] under the canopy of life under the blood
[28:06] and under this great message of the hour
[28:08] that pains a direct road to leave this
[28:11] earth
[28:12] it gives us direct instructions to leave
[28:14] this place because we know rapturing
[28:16] faith is laying in this message and
[28:19] certainly in this service today is a
[28:21] special service it's a deliverance and
[28:23] restoration service so i certainly want
[28:26] to salute those
[28:27] who are here regularly and those who are
[28:29] about to be here regularly
[28:36] because i don't believe you're here by
[28:38] chance i don't believe you're here by
[28:39] accident and if you are invited here
[28:41] this morning it means somebody loves you
[28:47] nobody invites you to choose because
[28:49] they want to do you
[28:52] nobody invites you to the house of the
[28:54] lord because they have problems with you
[28:55] and they're trying to get your life
[28:56] messed up they invite you to the house
[28:58] of the lord because they want to see
[28:59] something better for you
[29:01] and not only do they love you it means
[29:03] god also love you
[29:05] and that's the more important love
[29:06] because the love of an invitation is the
[29:08] expression of god's love to that person
[29:11] who spoke to you
[29:13] because no man could love the way god
[29:14] could love
[29:15] because for god so loved the world he
[29:17] gave his only begotten son that
[29:18] whosoever
[29:20] believed on him should not perish
[29:22] so we are happy to be in the presence of
[29:24] the lord this morning
[29:26] and just for a title for a thought this
[29:30] morning and we by the grace of god i
[29:32] want to be able to pray
[29:34] for those who need prayer after the
[29:35] service
[29:36] but i believe that we at a time when we
[29:39] ought to be getting right with god
[29:42] it's not about church for the formality
[29:44] of church it's not about church because
[29:46] you're you're you need to be in church
[29:48] and church is something good to do it's
[29:50] about getting right with god
[29:52] and that's why we have a burden for
[29:54] deliverance and restoration it's two
[29:56] things to be delivered from things that
[29:58] you can break from
[30:00] or you think you cannot break from and
[30:01] to be restored to a former state
[30:04] to be restored to a greater plane of
[30:06] existence to restore in your joy and in
[30:09] your walk and and not even the best walk
[30:11] you ever had but to be restored to the
[30:14] representation by predestination the way
[30:16] god sees you and that's where we're
[30:18] trying to go back to by the grace of god
[30:20] this morning so we want to really thank
[30:22] god how many appreciate the prayer
[30:24] meeting on friday night and the service
[30:26] last wednesday and our pressures with
[30:28] the stephen all the very last sunday
[30:30] what a time we're having in the lord
[30:33] so i have a title this morning and the
[30:35] title is connected to the theme of
[30:37] today's inspiration the title is the
[30:40] deliverance
[30:41] and restoration of your spiritual
[30:44] identity
[30:46] the deliverance
[30:48] and restoration of your spiritual
[30:52] identity
[30:54] and we have to realize as a layered
[30:55] background there's a quote i want to
[30:57] read from christ is the mystery of god
[30:59] revealed now god had a purpose and a
[31:02] hidden mystery so god is that without a
[31:05] purpose and not everything he does is
[31:07] obvious so he has a purpose and there's
[31:09] a hidden element or a hidden mystery to
[31:11] how he's unfolding himself and that's
[31:14] what i want to speak on to the church
[31:15] this morning the his the hidden mystery
[31:18] of god that he had in his mind before
[31:20] the world ever began
[31:22] we read that scripture and it's really a
[31:24] powerful scripture when in jeremiah god
[31:27] is speaking to jeremiah and saying
[31:29] before i form thee in the belly
[31:32] so so it wasn't even the conception of
[31:35] father and mother but before i singular
[31:38] personal pronoun form thee in the belly
[31:40] i knew thee
[31:42] he wasn't talking about knowing his
[31:43] fingers and knowing his hands are
[31:45] knowing his feet he's talking about
[31:46] knowing him
[31:48] knowing his identity
[31:50] knowing his potential we're gonna get it
[31:53] before you came out of the womb i
[31:54] sanctify thee
[31:56] so god is not now
[31:59] beginning to work on you
[32:00] god is not now establishing who you are
[32:03] god is not now trying to pick you and
[32:06] and and so in other words you didn't
[32:07] stumble in this morning by accident
[32:10] god was reminding jeremiah and
[32:12] instructing jeremiah and teaching
[32:14] jeremiah what jeremiah didn't even know
[32:16] that before he was even out of belly
[32:19] before he was even formed in the belly
[32:21] god already knew him and you here are
[32:23] known this morning before you were
[32:25] formed in the belly before you came out
[32:27] of the womb before you took your first
[32:29] step before you drank from a bottle
[32:32] before you went to your primary school
[32:34] before you went to secondary school
[32:36] before you said your first life because
[32:38] jeremiah would have made mistakes but
[32:40] god was rewinding the tape of his life
[32:42] to a point before his own existence his
[32:44] own consciousness to say listen
[32:47] we around along the time that your
[32:49] awareness and your problems and your
[32:51] situations can the church say amen
[32:55] a mystery of god that we didn't realize
[32:58] we didn't understand i'm going to come
[32:59] back to this but i want to be going to
[33:01] lay a bit of a foundation here to kind
[33:03] of talk with you a little bit
[33:06] what is the definition of identity
[33:11] by definition your identity is listen
[33:14] carefully the fact
[33:16] of being who or what a person is
[33:21] so your identity or identity is the fact
[33:24] of being who
[33:26] a person is
[33:28] and the operative word there is fact
[33:31] so your identity is the real you
[33:35] the identity is not a show the identity
[33:38] is not uh put on the identity is not you
[33:41] acting as somebody else
[33:43] in another dictionary it is defined as
[33:45] the distinguishing character
[33:48] or personality of an individual
[33:53] when something is identical
[33:56] it means there's no difference in
[33:57] identity
[33:59] because identity speaks about uniqueness
[34:04] your
[34:04] identity is who you are
[34:09] it is your characteristics
[34:12] your identity is your abilities
[34:15] your identity is your nature
[34:18] your identity is your potential
[34:21] it is your realizations
[34:24] it is your achievements
[34:26] come out of your identity
[34:29] your failures are tied to your identity
[34:32] we're gonna go somewhere this morning
[34:34] your victories are tied to your identity
[34:37] your ups and downs is all tied to your
[34:40] identity
[34:42] your identity is the real you
[34:45] so right now you're not seeing the real
[34:48] me
[34:49] because this body is not my identity
[34:53] we're going to go a little deeper
[34:55] you have an id card to try to identify
[34:57] you
[34:58] but that can't really identify you
[35:02] because if your face changes did you
[35:04] change
[35:09] if you lose a finger in the morning does
[35:11] that change who you are
[35:14] so if your finger being removed or your
[35:17] face if you go to facial surgery in the
[35:19] morning
[35:20] and change your face
[35:22] is it a different person
[35:25] so your identity doesn't change when
[35:27] your face change
[35:29] if you lose a finger your identity is
[35:31] still you
[35:32] you lose a toe did you change
[35:35] it it's still you so your body is not
[35:37] your identity
[35:39] your bank account is not your identity
[35:41] if i deposit a dollar into your bank
[35:43] account this morning did they change you
[35:46] so if i increase your money decrease
[35:48] your money doesn't change who you are
[35:50] your family is not your identity
[35:55] somebody gets added to your family does
[35:56] it change you
[35:58] somebody leaves your family does it
[36:00] change you so your identity is not tied
[36:03] to our body
[36:04] our identities are tied to our money our
[36:07] identity is not tied to our family
[36:09] anybody with me so let's begin to go a
[36:12] bit deeper and we're talking about now
[36:13] the deliverance and restoration of our
[36:16] spiritual identity i want to begin to
[36:18] encourage you church the real you is
[36:20] stronger than you think
[36:23] the real you is the overcomer
[36:25] the real you so i'm not talking to this
[36:28] flesh man that's why the prophet can say
[36:30] you are not even the believer but the
[36:31] word in you that's the believer there's
[36:34] a seed germ
[36:35] that if i take away your two legs and
[36:37] your two hands you can still come this
[36:39] morning and shout because the real you
[36:42] oh you don't hear me this morning no
[36:44] wonder this if i lose my teeth gum the
[36:46] devil because my teeth is not that's not
[36:48] my identity that's that's all the
[36:51] entrapments that's all the external
[36:53] expressions of my identity but the real
[36:56] you is an eternal being
[36:58] that rotated off the presence of god can
[37:01] the church see man
[37:04] oh we're building something we're
[37:05] building something this morning
[37:07] hallelujah saw your natural birth
[37:10] when you were born
[37:11] somewhere in the world right now a baby
[37:13] was just born and the person who's
[37:15] holding that baby doesn't know who that
[37:17] person is
[37:18] the person holding that baby is looking
[37:20] at the baby smiling and that baby is
[37:22] smiling and locked up in there is
[37:26] something that the world doesn't know
[37:27] about yet or you don't hear me this
[37:29] morning locked up in there is potential
[37:32] locked up in that baby who has not been
[37:34] to school is the ability to be a doctor
[37:37] a lawyer to be a preacher to be a
[37:39] prophet
[37:41] that identity
[37:44] out of that identity is every possible
[37:46] achievement that could happen in other
[37:48] words because of who you are is why
[37:51] you're an overcomer you don't hear me
[37:52] this morning your education doesn't make
[37:55] you who you are it's because of who you
[37:58] are god allowed you to walk oh you don't
[38:00] hear me this morning it's because of
[38:04] your overcoming is not making you who
[38:06] you are it's because of who you are it's
[38:09] built into you to overcome oh come on
[38:12] now
[38:13] can we begin to preach a little bit
[38:15] in other words you're not here in church
[38:17] to become something else in that kind of
[38:19] a way is because there's a seed in you
[38:21] you're attracted to hear this gospel
[38:23] [Applause]
[38:25] and the transformation that has taken
[38:27] place because when they asked jesus
[38:29] about the kingdom he said don't look
[38:31] there don't look there don't look there
[38:33] the kingdom is inside of you in other
[38:35] words locked up inside of you i placed a
[38:38] seed a long time ago of the real you
[38:42] that's compatible with my kingdom and
[38:44] maybe your mama kept it covered up
[38:47] sin kept it covered up but what people
[38:49] said about you kept it covered up but if
[38:52] we could uncover
[38:55] anybody with me this morning if we could
[38:57] uncover the scene
[38:58] if we could dig a little deeper
[39:00] beyond your facial expressions if we
[39:03] could dig a little deeper between your
[39:05] tiredness in your body to see who's the
[39:07] real person who is the real person who
[39:10] is the real you what is your real
[39:12] identity oh you don't hear me this
[39:14] morning
[39:16] oh hallelujah
[39:18] hallelujah
[39:19] i want to encourage you this morning
[39:21] church that is what's making this gospel
[39:23] so powerful the devil's job is to get
[39:26] you to not know who you really are your
[39:29] ability to get the holy ghost is not
[39:31] tied to what you could do it's tied to
[39:33] who you are it's because god put your
[39:36] name on the book and god predestinated
[39:38] you now you have the ability to fight if
[39:41] your name is not on the book you could
[39:43] never fight you could never respond to
[39:45] this gospel if your name is not in the
[39:47] book you could never show up here this
[39:49] morning it's because
[39:52] of your identity it's because your
[39:55] father is the king that entitles you to
[39:58] access
[39:59] oh you don't hear me somebody preached
[40:01] back to me this morning
[40:02] [Applause]
[40:05] hallelujah
[40:07] hallelujah so the great mystery this
[40:10] morning it's the mystery of who you are
[40:12] and i want to challenge you that you
[40:14] don't even realize who you are you only
[40:17] have a partial realization of what you
[40:19] are capable of
[40:23] anybody with me this morning
[40:25] anybody with me this morning
[40:28] hallelujah locked up in you is the
[40:29] ability to do things you don't even
[40:31] realize you could do
[40:33] i'm gonna share a natural story with you
[40:35] then get to the spiritual side
[40:37] i was on some training recently
[40:39] and a gentleman said he paid a lot of
[40:41] money because you wanted to run a
[40:43] hundred mile race
[40:48] i don't know how many of you are
[40:49] athletes
[40:50] but running half a mile per punch for
[40:52] some people will flatten them out
[40:54] running one mile for some people they
[40:56] finish running five miles major
[40:59] achievement 10 miles major
[41:01] accomplishment
[41:02] 20 miles life goal
[41:05] 50 miles forget about it but he had in
[41:08] his heart to run 50 to run a hundred
[41:11] mile race
[41:12] and he paid money and he got trained and
[41:14] whatever he did he couldn't cross 38
[41:17] miles
[41:18] somehow every time he tried to do it
[41:20] when he was 13 he just gave up
[41:22] and he heard about somebody who who said
[41:25] i could unlock that limitation for you
[41:27] he said give me two days
[41:29] and i will unlock your ability to make
[41:31] that hunt in my race
[41:33] and he told all of his friends he said
[41:34] this guy says he just needs two days to
[41:37] unlock the ability to run a hundred mile
[41:39] race and that's a mind-blowing thing
[41:41] because if you have been trying to do
[41:43] something for a long time and you're not
[41:45] able to pass a certain limit in your
[41:46] life if somebody tells you there's a way
[41:49] for you to break past your limitation
[41:51] like like break past the strong barrier
[41:53] like like break past the prayer barrier
[41:54] like like break past whatever you're
[41:56] trying to go through
[41:59] he said the gentleman came to his house
[42:02] he said the first day he did nothing he
[42:03] just watched him and the next day
[42:06] he said we're going to get up early in
[42:07] the morning and i'm going to give you
[42:08] the instructions
[42:11] i want you to pick this is not spiritual
[42:12] now this is natural but i wanted to show
[42:14] you how we're tied to the spiritual
[42:16] the next morning they got up he said
[42:18] today we're gonna do the race
[42:20] whatever you do don't put voice to your
[42:22] pain
[42:24] he said whatever you do don't say i'm
[42:26] hurting
[42:28] whatever you do don't say i can't make
[42:30] it
[42:31] whatever you don't let the words come
[42:32] out of your mouth
[42:34] even if the thought comes to your mind
[42:36] whatever you do
[42:37] don't let the words come out of your
[42:38] mouth and i'm hearing this natural man
[42:41] speaking and scriptures just turning in
[42:43] my mind let the weak say i'm strong
[42:46] the issue is not you have a problem is
[42:49] what you declare
[42:52] so that was one part of it he said the
[42:54] second thing i want you to do
[42:56] is whenever i ask you how you're doing
[42:58] say i am outstanding
[43:03] so i'm listening to this natural man
[43:05] speaking
[43:07] and my mind goes back to that woman who
[43:09] lost the baby
[43:10] and when they ask her what's going on
[43:12] she said all is well
[43:15] whatever question they had you say all
[43:17] is well
[43:18] so this gentleman said he started the
[43:20] race
[43:21] and he keep asking him how you feeling
[43:22] good how are you outstanding and no
[43:25] question about it brother joe he blew
[43:28] past 38 miles
[43:29] he blew past 48 miles he blew past 58
[43:32] miles he said as he was getting close to
[43:35] 70 something miles he said he reached he
[43:37] knew he was about to stop
[43:39] and he said this man was running with
[43:40] him and he said let me tell you a secret
[43:42] i don't tell anybody else
[43:44] i don't get tired
[43:49] and i want you to begin to say i don't
[43:51] get tired
[43:54] and at that point in time he said he
[43:56] this man just crazy
[43:58] but he began to apply what the man said
[44:01] and 78 became 79 and 79 become 80 and
[44:05] every time he looked to stop and say how
[44:07] are you doing i feel outstanding i don't
[44:09] get tired
[44:10] and with that 80 became 81 became 82 83
[44:15] 84 all the way to 100.
[44:19] and i looked and i said look how this
[44:21] natural man
[44:22] tapped into a spiritual principle and he
[44:25] said something
[44:27] he said it was the same legs
[44:30] that couldn't pass 38. that is what
[44:32] shook me it was not a dif because it was
[44:35] two days but occurrence it wasn't a year
[44:38] training program
[44:39] it was just two days of changing his
[44:41] mind
[44:43] about what he was able to do
[44:45] he did not know what was locked up in
[44:47] him
[44:50] [Applause]
[44:59] so when i say to you this morning you
[45:01] don't know what's locked up inside of
[45:03] you this is not just words
[45:06] you have to realize that inside of you
[45:08] the bible says jesus said the kingdom of
[45:11] god
[45:12] is inside you
[45:15] and if a natural man could break natural
[45:17] limits by realizing that his words and
[45:20] his actions were triggering limitations
[45:23] being broken in him what about a bride
[45:26] when she realizes that the kingdom of
[45:29] god
[45:30] is within you when you realize who you
[45:32] are
[45:34] what limits are we gonna break this
[45:36] morning what limitations
[45:39] [Applause]
[45:47] anybody with me this morning
[45:51] our identity
[45:54] is who we are
[45:57] not our facial features your words are
[46:01] based on your identity
[46:04] we're going to say something this
[46:05] morning
[46:07] everything we see and interact with
[46:10] is based on your identity
[46:13] and this is why friends when we say
[46:16] people backslide and then i'll get a
[46:18] little bit in this
[46:19] the way you dress
[46:21] is based on your identity you know
[46:23] because it's really an expression
[46:25] of who you are
[46:28] you see many of us we follow the gospel
[46:31] because we learn some rules and some
[46:34] guidelines and we understand if you love
[46:36] me keep my commandments but it remains a
[46:38] surface level because it's head
[46:40] knowledge
[46:42] and is not yet
[46:44] fully who we are even though the kingdom
[46:47] is there it's blocked up by facebook
[46:51] and tick tock
[46:53] and conversations we shouldn't have so
[46:56] the kingdom part of you is being stifled
[46:59] so it lives in our hearts and our minds
[47:02] on a surface level well we don't do this
[47:04] as a christian
[47:07] i could preach till blue in the face
[47:11] until you change the way you dress
[47:14] but the moment your will breaks
[47:18] your real identity resurfaces
[47:24] can i say that one more time
[47:27] because we put a lot of self-imposed
[47:29] controls on our lives
[47:32] don't lie don't steal don't do this
[47:34] don't do that don't do this don't do
[47:36] that
[47:36] because when we're born we are born with
[47:38] our identity being hidden
[47:42] many who lived in the world for years
[47:44] lived drinking smoking you didn't know
[47:45] who you were
[47:46] you didn't know your identity
[47:48] you thought you were a chicken
[47:50] you didn't know you were an eagle
[47:53] it's only when the eagle to eagle call
[47:54] come you reckon wait a minute there's
[47:56] something here triggering like a i'm
[47:59] feeling something different
[48:01] i don't know fully what it is but i know
[48:03] what i know
[48:04] is not me
[48:05] i don't feel comfortable going to the
[48:07] bar i don't feel comfortable going to
[48:09] the effect i know the fullness of this
[48:12] perfection and adoption and thing but i
[48:13] know what i was in before is not me and
[48:16] i know what i'm moving towards is what i
[48:18] am
[48:20] but it's a journey and a process
[48:22] of unveiling who you really are and the
[48:24] devil's job is to say no
[48:26] you just like everybody else you're just
[48:28] like your neighbor you're just like your
[48:30] co-worker don't press too hard don't
[48:33] worship don't lift your hands and praise
[48:34] god just be calm and and be collective
[48:37] and just say you love jesus and you're a
[48:39] good person but something in your heart
[48:42] knows there's a deeper purpose and a
[48:45] real identity
[48:48] friends
[48:49] you know is the hardest thing in life
[48:52] to be an actor you know
[48:55] and to act for a long time
[48:57] every day you're acting every day you're
[48:58] trying to put on your best foot so some
[49:00] people this morning put on the whole
[49:02] church outfit
[49:04] not just the clothes you know
[49:06] but the whole personality
[49:08] god bless you god bless you some people
[49:10] have to rehearse i ain't mean i'll
[49:11] literally rehearsal no i mean in your
[49:13] mind in spirit because monday tuesday
[49:16] wednesday thursday that is not how
[49:17] you're living
[49:20] but you have different identities it's
[49:22] like identity disorder
[49:24] it's identity crisis
[49:26] but i better call it spiritual amnesia
[49:28] you don't really know who you are so you
[49:30] operate a certain way because you don't
[49:32] want to reveal the real you to your
[49:34] co-workers
[49:35] because the real you don't talk them
[49:37] kind of thing the real you're not
[49:39] supposed to talk that kind of thing so
[49:40] you have a alternate version of yourself
[49:43] for when you're with family
[49:46] anybody with me this morning
[49:48] you have a different version of yourself
[49:52] so everybody here this morning telling
[49:53] me the real you
[49:55] is who you're showing people all the
[49:56] time
[50:00] because the real you
[50:02] don't get upset and angry and have oaths
[50:04] and grudges do you read you who we
[50:06] trying to find this morning we're on a
[50:08] quest this morning for your spiritual
[50:10] identity because only real you can make
[50:13] it on the other side
[50:14] only because only perfect love can get
[50:16] you over there so the real you can only
[50:18] exist fully in perfect love
[50:21] the real you can only exist in an
[50:22] environment with no oughts no grudges so
[50:26] if you ever order this morning are you
[50:28] talking to the real you yet or no
[50:29] because you had to drop that oat for us
[50:31] to find to be able to reach
[50:33] when jesus when when when did he pull
[50:36] and and that woman came he was brother
[50:38] branson he was hunting for a spirit
[50:40] looking for her soul he was trying to
[50:42] connect with the real her because she
[50:44] was walking around living in her life
[50:46] saying the husband of which is not mine
[50:48] and i bid with so much other men but
[50:49] when jesus said go find your husband he
[50:52] was able to connect with the version of
[50:54] herself she didn't even know what's in
[50:55] her oh come on now he was able to find
[50:58] her name in the book so god was seeing
[51:01] her how she wasn't even seeing herself
[51:03] you don't hear me this morning and i
[51:05] want to challenge you this morning we
[51:07] need to see ourselves the way god sees
[51:10] us
[51:11] and god can only identify with the real
[51:14] you which is your spiritual identity can
[51:17] the church say amen
[51:20] let me encourage you a little bit
[51:23] your pain is not your identity you know
[51:26] pain is to help find your identity or
[51:28] you don't hear me this morning god will
[51:30] strip away the things you're leaning on
[51:33] so that the real you will get
[51:34] exposed we want to expose the real you
[51:37] we want to expose the prayer warrior he
[51:40] hiding this morning we want to find oh
[51:42] you don't hear me
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:51] can we describe your spiritual identity
[51:55] this morning i'm looking for somebody
[51:58] tell me if you know them
[52:00] when you talk to this person with a
[52:01] punch
[52:02] there's always a joy
[52:04] when they talk this person no matter
[52:06] what you do they don't get upset
[52:08] if you do them something they drop the
[52:10] or so the odd hair they just fall off
[52:12] nothing sticks on that person
[52:14] if they have no food they don't bother
[52:17] them if they have money they don't
[52:18] bother them if they have no money it
[52:21] don't bother them when they hear it's
[52:22] time for service they drop everything
[52:24] because this is the most important thing
[52:26] to them are looking for that person
[52:28] and looking for somebody that even if
[52:30] they mess up they don't lie about it
[52:32] because this real person can't lie
[52:34] because god can't lie and this real
[52:36] identity to a lie
[52:38] i'm looking for somebody the more god
[52:40] blesses the more humble they become
[52:42] because that's a real identity not
[52:44] somebody when they give him a blessing
[52:46] they lift their head up that is not who
[52:48] i'm talking to this morning we're going
[52:49] for the real identity the real identity
[52:52] don't feel a certain way to dress like a
[52:54] christian the real one you want to dress
[52:57] like a christian all the time because
[52:59] this is who they are it's not a show
[53:02] it's not a performance it's not a
[53:04] request it's not something hard because
[53:06] when you're yourself it is normal it's
[53:09] your natural way of life you don't hear
[53:11] me this morning
[53:14] i'm looking for that person this morning
[53:16] but occurrence if you if you see that
[53:18] person let me know where that person is
[53:20] because that person is locked up
[53:21] somewhere hiding somewhere covered up
[53:24] somewhere and we want to deliver and
[53:26] restore that spiritual identity
[53:30] you don't have to tell that person to
[53:32] worship that person is a worshiper
[53:35] because they understand that god
[53:36] deserves worship and worship has nothing
[53:39] to do with what happened to you worship
[53:41] has nothing to do with your mistakes and
[53:44] nothing to do with your failures and
[53:46] nothing to do with what somebody said
[53:48] about you
[53:49] that real person is just a worshiper in
[53:52] the morning they worship in the evening
[53:55] they worship on a sunday day worship on
[53:58] a thursday they worship
[54:00] [Music]
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:07] anybody know that person
[54:09] anybody know where that person is hiding
[54:11] that person could be your brother that
[54:13] person could be your sister that person
[54:15] could be a young person that person
[54:17] could be your killer i'm looking for
[54:19] that person this morning
[54:21] that living virtues will be emanating
[54:24] from that person
[54:40] stop living the lie
[54:42] of being who you're not
[54:44] i said it many times ago
[54:46] when that person i'm describing
[54:49] ends up
[54:50] messed up a little bit
[54:52] covered up a little bit
[54:54] and they're trying to hide who they
[54:55] really are
[54:57] so they try to hide it by taking only
[54:59] the language
[55:01] of the world because they don't want to
[55:02] appear
[55:03] too churchy
[55:06] sin just holds them in a grip
[55:08] a grip of fornication a grip of lust a
[55:11] grip of lying a grip of cheating or grip
[55:15] and and and they want to break up
[55:17] because you see the new ones that come
[55:18] out you know
[55:19] when you look at legion legion had a
[55:22] thousand devils but the cry in legion
[55:25] soul connected to jesus you know so it
[55:27] didn't matter how much devils he had
[55:29] upon him that seed in his heart was
[55:32] connecting to the presence of deity on
[55:35] the earth
[55:38] a thousand devils couldn't stop the cry
[55:41] from crossing over to the other side
[55:45] and jesus said let us go to the other
[55:47] side because a seed is crying out people
[55:50] couldn't reach this man they couldn't
[55:52] reason with this man they couldn't talk
[55:54] with this man but it wasn't his voice
[55:56] that was reaching out it was his heart
[55:58] it was his identity it was who he was
[56:01] and when jesus landed here the devils
[56:04] didn't ask jesus name they say we know
[56:07] who you are
[56:09] we know your identity it is your
[56:12] identity that will push back the devils
[56:15] it is just who you are do you realize if
[56:18] you could see the spiritual realm even
[56:20] in your backseating condition when you
[56:21] walk the street devils start to tremble
[56:25] because they know who you are even when
[56:27] you don't even know who you are oh you
[56:28] don't hear me this morning do you know
[56:30] what's locked up inside of you church of
[56:32] the living god
[56:36] i want to encourage you friends your
[56:38] healing your restoration your victory is
[56:42] tied to fate in who god says you are
[56:45] because the faith in who god says you
[56:47] are is the key to unlock one time with
[56:50] the brand i was doing a prayer line and
[56:52] stuff and a woman was there sitting
[56:53] there an indian lady i don't remember
[56:55] the story and she was just watching
[56:57] watching watching and after a while but
[56:59] the band was praying for people and she
[57:01] just caught hold of it and she'd walk up
[57:04] to the prophet and just take her
[57:05] crutches and hand it to him he didn't
[57:07] have to pray for her because she her
[57:09] fate wasn't was strong enough that she
[57:12] could just walk away healed her faith
[57:14] made her whole i can't heal you this
[57:17] morning but your faith your fear can
[57:19] make you whole do you have faith for
[57:21] yourself this morning do you have faith
[57:23] for your family do you have faith for
[57:25] your children
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:30] so friends
[57:31] what we really want to see is a
[57:33] transformation
[57:35] a transformation to unveil the real you
[57:38] that the devil wants to keep covered up
[57:41] hallelujah when you think about it and
[57:43] i'm gonna get it in a bit
[57:45] but just think about esther
[57:48] esther we know who she was we don't know
[57:50] much about her family except that it was
[57:52] her cousin and fam who raised her
[57:55] and esther got comfortable in the palace
[58:00] in other words she lost an entertainer
[58:03] she became separated from who she was
[58:06] and what she could do for her family
[58:09] until i had to say could it be
[58:12] per adventure it is
[58:14] that you are here for such a time as
[58:16] this
[58:17] because if you don't do something about
[58:19] it
[58:20] deliverance will still come you know it
[58:22] will come from elsewhere but how do you
[58:24] not know that for such a time as this
[58:27] you are in your position
[58:29] esther she wasn't living in sin
[58:32] but esther forgot who she was
[58:34] and because she forgot who she was she
[58:37] lost the burden
[58:38] so there are believers who have been in
[58:40] the village a long time and they have
[58:42] forgotten who they are and because they
[58:44] have forgotten who they are they have
[58:45] lost the burden
[58:47] the burden
[58:48] the burden it means that that true you
[58:51] has been covered up by by safety and
[58:53] comfort
[58:55] you're just concerned about your life
[58:56] that's that was yesterday you know
[58:59] she was hearing the threat and because
[59:01] she felt safe
[59:04] can we talk a little bit
[59:06] because esther felt nobody could touch
[59:08] her because she was married to the king
[59:10] she lost sight of the impact on her
[59:13] loved ones
[59:14] and the word had to come to her
[59:16] listen if you don't do something god
[59:19] will do something but there'll be a
[59:20] price because you're in a position to do
[59:22] something in other words you have lost a
[59:24] burden for your people you have lost the
[59:27] burden for the saints you have lost the
[59:29] burden
[59:32] i don't know if there's anybody that's
[59:33] mourning us
[59:35] you lost a burden
[59:37] in your heart i'm pressing on i'm
[59:39] pressing on but you do have a burden
[59:42] for somebody else
[59:44] a burden for a brother who's struggling
[59:46] a burden for sister who was struggling
[59:48] and throughout scripture there are many
[59:50] people who because losing your identity
[59:52] is really not knowing who you are or
[59:54] forgetting who you are you know
[59:56] how did samson end up with delilah
[1:00:03] samson ended up really lying because he
[1:00:04] forgot who he was
[1:00:06] because if you know who you are
[1:00:09] and you are walking in who you are and
[1:00:11] you are living in who you are and you
[1:00:13] are walking in your purpose then you
[1:00:14] can't do what sons did
[1:00:17] anybody with me
[1:00:21] saul the apostle who became paul saul
[1:00:23] who became paul he thought he was doing
[1:00:25] right he was in church
[1:00:27] a pharisee of the pharisees
[1:00:30] they are stoning stephen but he was in
[1:00:32] an identity crisis i didn't even know it
[1:00:35] because he felt justified that he was
[1:00:37] defending the scriptures
[1:00:39] until something had to happen to him to
[1:00:41] change him
[1:00:42] and for him to come there but wait a
[1:00:44] minute that that day wasn't me you know
[1:00:50] gideon struggled with his identity
[1:00:53] gideon mighty man of allah
[1:00:55] in other words there's more in you than
[1:00:57] you realize
[1:00:59] the way you're living now is not with a
[1:01:00] calling to live
[1:01:02] and gideon had a response i'm from the
[1:01:04] smallest tribe from the smallest family
[1:01:06] and in my family i'm smallest
[1:01:09] that is what he saw as his identity
[1:01:14] he said this is who i am and god to show
[1:01:16] gideon gideon you are more than what
[1:01:18] you're seeing because i am seeing you
[1:01:20] completely different
[1:01:22] from how you are seeing yourself
[1:01:25] so if you are here this morning and you
[1:01:27] think you're failure oh i want to erase
[1:01:30] that because god doesn't see you as a
[1:01:31] failure god doesn't see you as a loser
[1:01:34] god doesn't see you as weak god does it
[1:01:36] because you couldn't be here unless god
[1:01:37] wanted you to be here so shake yourself
[1:01:40] like gideon and say i'm coming home
[1:01:43] i'm reporting for duty i'm standing up
[1:01:46] for what is the truth can the church say
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:54] moses left egypt on the run after
[1:01:57] killing an egyptian and he lost the
[1:01:58] burden completely
[1:02:00] 40 years
[1:02:02] he appeared him it pained him when he
[1:02:04] was in egypt catch his friends he was in
[1:02:07] pain when he saw because
[1:02:10] he saw him at the bus he knew it wasn't
[1:02:12] right he made a failed attempt to
[1:02:14] deliver went into hiding and already 40
[1:02:17] years he even think about him
[1:02:21] lost the burden
[1:02:23] and many times some of us we are living
[1:02:25] in the ease
[1:02:26] of our job our position or whatever and
[1:02:29] we lost the burden for the spiritual
[1:02:31] things you know
[1:02:34] we get so caught up in the natural thing
[1:02:36] because nothing is easier to relate to
[1:02:38] you see food in the morning and the gas
[1:02:40] and the car and transportation and this
[1:02:42] and all these things and and that's our
[1:02:43] world
[1:02:45] and we lose the burden not realizing
[1:02:47] that this natural world has come at an
[1:02:49] end
[1:02:50] and only a spiritual world is what
[1:02:52] matters
[1:02:53] and we fight so much to build up this
[1:02:55] natural identity that's dr so-and-so
[1:02:58] that is mr so and so that is who this
[1:03:00] person is and we we work really hard to
[1:03:03] build up this thing that people see
[1:03:04] about us
[1:03:07] your resume your credentials all these
[1:03:09] things
[1:03:12] and the real you
[1:03:14] is hidden
[1:03:16] you're not telling anybody you're
[1:03:18] christian
[1:03:20] you don't acknowledge god
[1:03:22] and it becomes embarrassing when you see
[1:03:24] somebody who say i couldn't do it
[1:03:26] without the lord
[1:03:28] i knew that but wait a minute you know i
[1:03:29] never tell my workers i'm a christian
[1:03:33] i never acknowledged god
[1:03:35] and you're looking for god to bless you
[1:03:36] even more
[1:03:39] what about a prodigal son
[1:03:42] grow up a certain way
[1:03:44] grew up in church
[1:03:46] grew up in his father's house blessed
[1:03:51] but something
[1:03:52] snapped in his life
[1:03:55] for every person in this room you know
[1:03:57] when your life changed
[1:03:59] for the better and for the worse
[1:04:04] people go back to when they were saved
[1:04:06] when they were delivered and all these
[1:04:07] things but they were they're also
[1:04:09] highlighting your life or low lights
[1:04:11] when things went wrong
[1:04:13] and you're
[1:04:15] some of you still struggling to find
[1:04:17] back your way
[1:04:19] some have struggled and fought back to a
[1:04:21] place they were
[1:04:22] because even david
[1:04:24] say
[1:04:25] create a mirror clean out and renault
[1:04:27] read new right spread and cast me over
[1:04:29] and take and and when you look at
[1:04:30] david's life
[1:04:32] restore unto me
[1:04:35] for to restore joy meant david knew he
[1:04:38] was in a better place before
[1:04:41] he knew at that point in time the way he
[1:04:44] was operating was not it was not his
[1:04:45] high point
[1:04:48] he knew he had tasted better than what
[1:04:50] he was eating at that point in time
[1:04:52] just like the prodigal son
[1:04:55] the prodigal son left and for a while he
[1:04:57] was fine because friends when you leave
[1:04:59] church and you leave your father house
[1:05:00] and and stuff it takes a little while
[1:05:03] for you to work off all the good
[1:05:04] teaching
[1:05:06] it will happen overnight so over time
[1:05:09] and that's why i say people don't
[1:05:11] backslide today for tomorrow is over
[1:05:12] time
[1:05:13] you start to just get weaker and you
[1:05:15] listen the lesser you would and you live
[1:05:16] the way you want to live and after a
[1:05:18] while you'll lose the sensitivity to
[1:05:20] this still small voice because it's tell
[1:05:22] small voices they're telling you don't
[1:05:23] do that don't do that don't go there
[1:05:25] don't say that don't do this and then
[1:05:27] after a while brother brown said it's at
[1:05:28] the low down avoid the volume
[1:05:31] until you don't hear it anymore and your
[1:05:33] heart becomes hard
[1:05:34] however it was this young man went away
[1:05:37] from home and found himself in a foreign
[1:05:39] city and he had enough natural substance
[1:05:41] to sustain him until it ran out
[1:05:44] and the sad thing is how bad your
[1:05:47] identity crisis could be
[1:05:49] he was content for a while living as a
[1:05:52] slave eating pig food until he had to
[1:05:54] calm the incenses
[1:06:00] why did it take him so long
[1:06:03] until i had to come their senses the
[1:06:04] moment you offered me to pick food i was
[1:06:06] gone
[1:06:11] he was easiness you know
[1:06:14] the moment you put any
[1:06:16] plate say i am out of here
[1:06:21] but he was eating the pig food because
[1:06:23] he was messed up
[1:06:25] he had lost himself
[1:06:28] and there are people walking around the
[1:06:30] church walking around a life have lost
[1:06:33] themselves
[1:06:35] and he had to come to his senses
[1:06:38] to re-avoid me this is not who i am
[1:06:45] and even in his coming back he said i
[1:06:47] will go back to my father's house
[1:06:49] and say i'm not even worthy to be a son
[1:06:52] just take me back as a servant
[1:06:55] not knowing that once your son you're
[1:06:58] always a son
[1:07:00] [Applause]
[1:07:08] i trust this helps somebody today to
[1:07:10] realize and to relook at your walk in
[1:07:14] life and with the lord
[1:07:17] because if a word comes to you today to
[1:07:19] tell you there's a highway to heaven
[1:07:22] there's a way to leave this sinful world
[1:07:24] behind and there's a way to open up this
[1:07:27] kingdom that's within you to walk in
[1:07:29] glory and to walk in strength won't you
[1:07:32] take that road
[1:07:33] would he be willing to cut away
[1:07:35] everything that's not god to be able for
[1:07:37] god to be veiled and seen and lived
[1:07:39] through you can the church say man
[1:07:43] friends the devil doesn't know who you
[1:07:45] are you know
[1:07:46] this issue of identity is real the same
[1:07:48] way we struggle to find out who we are
[1:07:51] in god and friends
[1:07:53] listen only when you know who you are in
[1:07:54] god he could really be a christian you
[1:07:56] know
[1:07:58] outside of your liver upper down life
[1:07:59] you know you live a life you're up on
[1:08:01] the air done one day because you really
[1:08:03] don't know one day you're living for the
[1:08:04] world one day living for your business
[1:08:06] we live for your family but when you
[1:08:07] don't for god that gives you the
[1:08:09] confidence every day you're weighing it
[1:08:12] before the lord lord should i do this
[1:08:13] should i do this should i live this
[1:08:15] should i actually should i do this
[1:08:17] that's the only way to be a real
[1:08:18] christian it's a full-time thing
[1:08:22] you cannot defeat a full-time devil with
[1:08:25] a part-time christian walk you need to
[1:08:27] be a full-time christian
[1:08:30] [Applause]
[1:08:32] you cartoon it or internet off you need
[1:08:34] to be a christian every day every minute
[1:08:36] of every day every second of every day
[1:08:39] that's what a christian is
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:43] how do you get to that spot
[1:08:47] it's not just about words it's about a
[1:08:49] life
[1:08:50] it's about the discipline it's about
[1:08:52] cleaning the life out it's about opening
[1:08:54] up the channels it's about cleaning out
[1:08:56] your phone and cleaning out your
[1:08:58] computer and cleaning out your car and
[1:09:00] cleaning out your house because you want
[1:09:02] no interruption between the line you
[1:09:04] don't want no disruption you don't want
[1:09:07] no interference you don't want any
[1:09:09] static you want god people to speak
[1:09:12] directly to you and nothing him to you

[1:09:22] between you and him

[1:09:28] you and him
[1:09:29] his desire is to be as close to you even
[1:09:32] in you so if there's an obstacle in your
[1:09:34] life between you and god it's not on god

[1:11:00] you know it
[1:11:02] nobody else have to be with you you
[1:11:04] spend time with people and when you
[1:11:06] leave that environment you're different
[1:11:08] every person you talk to changes you
[1:11:12] but abandoned was driving one time he
[1:11:13] said somebody came at this car he said
[1:11:14] he spoke a blue streak
[1:11:17] then he said don't let certain people
[1:11:18] into my car
[1:11:20] because when they speak they change the
[1:11:22] environment around me they change my
[1:11:24] atmosphere
[1:11:27] one time by the man i'm walking the
[1:11:28] hotel room he said i need another room
[1:11:30] somebody has come in fornication in this
[1:11:31] room
[1:11:36] that's how sensitive he was to the
[1:11:37] spiritual realm and the sin and the
[1:11:40] spirit that around them do you
[1:11:41] understand is that a human and flesh and
[1:11:43] blood thing but it's a spiritual warfare
[1:11:45] going on right now to deliver you to
[1:11:48] clear the pathway for god to speak to
[1:11:50] your heart
[1:11:56] drop down your natural defenses people
[1:11:58] have their defenses i don't want to wait
[1:11:59] to see miss soft
[1:12:01] what are you talking about he's
[1:12:02] vulnerable be vulnerable to god this
[1:12:04] morning say lord i need help
[1:12:07] i don't know what to do when i lost at
[1:12:09] the end of the road i try everything
[1:12:10] else my family in a mess i've seen too
[1:12:12] many people i have seen too many young
[1:12:14] people take this gospel and gone into
[1:12:17] the world and they're so messed up now
[1:12:22] i wish i could preach longer i wish i
[1:12:24] could preach louder i would take a fish
[1:12:26] on the street
[1:12:28] to tell people his gospel is real
[1:12:31] and when you walk away from this the way
[1:12:33] of a transgressor is hard it's harder
[1:12:36] when you walk away to come back in
[1:12:40] you better thank god you are in the
[1:12:42] house of god this morning and don't take
[1:12:44] it for granted
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:51] god will do whatever he needs to do
[1:12:54] that's why he said if love doesn't get
[1:12:55] you desperate conditions will because
[1:12:58] god is only cons oh god is only
[1:13:01] interested in that seed in your soul
[1:13:07] you may be seated
[1:13:08] no wonder but everybody don't seek a
[1:13:10] tree in a better sickness because your
[1:13:12] body is not your identity this is just a
[1:13:14] house for your identity oh you don't
[1:13:17] hear me this morning if you have to
[1:13:19] break your foot and put in a wheelchair
[1:13:21] to get your identity to say lord i'm
[1:13:23] ready to serve you i'm ready to connect
[1:13:25] with you are ready for the kingdom to be
[1:13:27] alive in me then god will do it don't
[1:13:30] you wait until your world turns upside
[1:13:33] down to come back into contact with god
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:44] we can do better
[1:13:47] people who have feared before are
[1:13:48] examples of how we should not do things
[1:13:53] it's embarrassing when we watch people
[1:13:55] do nonsense and you walk in the same
[1:13:57] footsteps
[1:14:02] how much lessons how much licks you have
[1:14:04] to get
[1:14:05] to realize that the raw to hell is
[1:14:07] pleased with fantastic intentions
[1:14:10] but it taking you straight to hell
[1:14:16] and the devil the devil will ensure your
[1:14:18] taste natural success
[1:14:21] and
[1:14:21] think it is god's success
[1:14:26] you heard what i said the devil will
[1:14:29] ensure you get natural success
[1:14:31] and people will say thank god and god it
[1:14:33] have nothing to do with it
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:36] to keep you in a false sense of security
[1:14:39] that it is well and your soul is not
[1:14:42] even well
[1:14:43] [Applause]
[1:14:46] that's why brother branham can say
[1:14:48] bright skies
[1:14:49] are not a sign of god's approval
[1:14:52] and cloudy skies are not the signs of
[1:14:55] god disapproval
[1:15:01] god will shut doors that you shouldn't
[1:15:03] go in and you're there praying lord open
[1:15:05] it open it and god say pray all you want
[1:15:06] that door not opening
[1:15:09] because i know what's behind that door
[1:15:11] and behind that door will destroy you
[1:15:13] you're not passing that door
[1:15:20] you need to wonder when things don't
[1:15:22] work out why they don't work out
[1:15:24] and it's not god whole and your back is
[1:15:26] something that the devil fighting you
[1:15:27] it's god saying i wanted to wreck your
[1:15:29] path because that seed in you has got to
[1:15:32] come to life and i don't want to get
[1:15:34] lost in thorns and lost in the case of
[1:15:38] life and lost doing what you want to do
[1:15:41] [Applause]
[1:15:45] everybody will preach on wednesday night
[1:15:47] be willing to sell all you have
[1:15:50] to buy that field because that pearl of
[1:15:53] great price is worth more than five
[1:15:55] degrees
[1:15:56] more than five houses
[1:15:58] more than five cars
[1:16:01] [Applause]
[1:16:07] i don't know who this is for this
[1:16:08] morning is
[1:16:12] there's nothing worse
[1:16:13] than a false
[1:16:15] sense of security
[1:16:20] i have some money in the bank so
[1:16:22] you feel secure
[1:16:24] you have an alarm on your house
[1:16:26] and you feel secure
[1:16:28] you have a dog running around the yard
[1:16:30] and you feel secure
[1:16:33] you just get a good bill of health from
[1:16:34] your doctor and you feel secure
[1:16:38] is that your security
[1:16:42] how are you checking your security
[1:16:44] regard
[1:16:47] do you know how secure you are with him
[1:16:51] your bank telling you all right your
[1:16:52] doctor tell you all right but when last
[1:16:54] have you asked god god am i all right
[1:17:05] people who struggle with health
[1:17:07] they go to the doctor
[1:17:09] and the doctor says
[1:17:11] the changes you implemented have
[1:17:13] resulted in a clean bill of health
[1:17:17] and statistically
[1:17:19] many people at that point go back to the
[1:17:22] old ways
[1:17:24] it's as if that clean bill of health is
[1:17:26] a license to go back and eat the
[1:17:27] foolishness they should need
[1:17:31] because there's a sense of
[1:17:33] security
[1:17:34] it's a sense of comfort
[1:17:36] a sense of safety
[1:17:38] friends church is a false sense of
[1:17:40] security
[1:17:47] there are people who think because
[1:17:48] they're in church they're all right
[1:17:52] some people say i love jesus i'm all
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:56] i believe the prophet the message the
[1:17:57] scriptures i'm all right and god is
[1:17:59] saying i don't even know that i don't
[1:18:00] even recognize it
[1:18:03] god will say depart from you work of
[1:18:05] iniquity and he was in church for 30
[1:18:07] years
[1:18:11] because god is interested in who you are
[1:18:14] not what you do
[1:18:16] friends
[1:18:17] because you could do things with the
[1:18:18] wrong motive
[1:18:20] but you see when you do because of who
[1:18:21] you really are
[1:18:23] that's what god wants to see
[1:18:25] will you really you stand up will you
[1:18:27] really you i want to know who the read
[1:18:29] you is
[1:18:31] friends i can speak for myself i know i
[1:18:34] have stuff to change in my life
[1:18:38] that's why i'm here this morning and i'm
[1:18:40] not preaching i'm here in church because
[1:18:41] i know i have stuff i need to change in
[1:18:43] my life
[1:18:46] and if you don't have stuff to change
[1:18:48] any wrong church
[1:18:53] because jesus came to heal to
[1:18:55] to change or transform to deliver to
[1:18:58] restore it
[1:19:00] he's a day that i will have no need of a
[1:19:02] doctor but he is a great physician here
[1:19:05] this morning for those who need a doctor
[1:19:07] lord i need a doctor
[1:19:11] i need a doctor for my mind i need a
[1:19:13] doctor for my soul i need a doctor for
[1:19:16] my body i'm a family we need a doctor
[1:19:18] i'm a business we need a
[1:19:20] doctor the young people need to go to
[1:19:23] the doctor
[1:19:30] so you don't feel the need to
[1:19:32] compromise
[1:19:33] who you really are
[1:19:35] there's nothing more uncomfortable than
[1:19:37] a christian trying to live as if you're
[1:19:39] not a christian
[1:19:45] because you have so much the kingdom in
[1:19:47] you revolts
[1:19:55] you find yourself in a shady place
[1:19:58] and you just you cut even your carpets a
[1:20:00] bit
[1:20:02] you try to fit in you're trying to and
[1:20:03] then after a while you realize you're
[1:20:05] you're not having fun people are having
[1:20:06] fun but you can't have fun
[1:20:09] and even if you feel good for a moment
[1:20:10] the moment you leave you feel sick
[1:20:13] not the sickness of your stomach the
[1:20:15] sickness of your soul because you know
[1:20:17] is that right
[1:20:19] and god convicts you on you you're
[1:20:21] leaving there feeling empty tired weary
[1:20:24] frustrated messed up
[1:20:28] miserable
[1:20:32] anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:20:35] because once you're touched by this word
[1:20:38] the world does lose its appetite
[1:20:42] the tears don't feel right
[1:20:46] the humanity flesh
[1:20:48] could struggle in the environment but
[1:20:50] his soul struggles say this is not me
[1:20:54] friends if when you miss service it
[1:20:56] doesn't bother you something wrong
[1:20:58] with your christian work telling you
[1:21:04] if and i'm making it today becomes an
[1:21:06] easy statement something is wrong
[1:21:09] you are suffering from an identity
[1:21:11] crisis
[1:21:20] that's right in the messenger deity of
[1:21:22] jesus christ can you take some more
[1:21:25] men and women the prophet said it's time
[1:21:26] we found out who you are
[1:21:29] who are you
[1:21:32] that was the question that the angel
[1:21:34] asks jacob
[1:21:36] what is your name who are you
[1:21:38] what is your identity
[1:21:41] because the way you're fighting
[1:21:43] i need to find out what behind that
[1:21:48] because you're not letting me go i need
[1:21:49] to go but you're fighting like you need
[1:21:51] something
[1:21:54] you're fighting like you're serious
[1:21:55] about change
[1:21:57] like you say like tonight is your night
[1:21:59] you're not going home without getting
[1:22:01] something
[1:22:02] who are you because the person that
[1:22:03] taught us gonna meet somehow you're
[1:22:05] fighting different
[1:22:06] i need to go by not letting me go
[1:22:11] and the angel brother punched a touchy
[1:22:12] hollow of his thigh
[1:22:15] because if he didn't do that the angel
[1:22:16] would have been kept in this dimension
[1:22:20] and jacob said well i am jacob
[1:22:23] and by giving his name and we're going
[1:22:24] to talk about his name revealed his
[1:22:27] identity but there was no identity
[1:22:29] conflict
[1:22:33] so when the angel looked at his real
[1:22:35] identity and he made me give him he say
[1:22:36] something not right
[1:22:38] because the identity you are describing
[1:22:40] and what i'm seeing is not the same i
[1:22:42] can't call you jacob
[1:22:44] because you're fighting not like a jacob
[1:22:46] this kind of fight and desperation
[1:22:48] without seeing is not how jacob just do
[1:22:51] it
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:54] you might think you're jacob a rascal
[1:22:56] alright
[1:22:58] but the way you're moving this morning
[1:23:00] you're in conflict with that name your
[1:23:03] praise is in conflict with that name
[1:23:06] your desperation is in conflict with
[1:23:09] that name you're not lining up with that
[1:23:12] name i have to call you a different name
[1:23:15] a name that better describes who you
[1:23:17] really are
[1:23:18] jacob i know you don't know who you
[1:23:20] really are but let me tell you who you
[1:23:23] are your name is israel
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:28] and from that time
[1:23:30] his name was not reconciled with his
[1:23:33] identity
[1:23:34] anybody with me this morning
[1:23:40] no wonder the bible says to him that
[1:23:42] overcome it will i give a new name
[1:23:46] because that new name
[1:23:49] speaks to your real you
[1:23:50] the name you're walking around with but
[1:23:52] the current current cause that's not
[1:23:53] your name there's another name
[1:23:56] the name god calls you pie it's not
[1:23:59] clarence it's not linden it's not george
[1:24:02] it's a new name reserved for overcomers
[1:24:05] who have come in alignment with their
[1:24:08] spiritual identity
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:22] anybody with me this morning
[1:24:31] friends
[1:24:33] your purpose
[1:24:35] is connected
[1:24:37] to who you are
[1:24:40] i will say it one more time your purpose
[1:24:44] there's nothing greater in this world
[1:24:46] that man has sought to find than to find
[1:24:48] a meaning
[1:24:49] a purpose
[1:24:54] your purpose
[1:24:55] is connected to who you are
[1:24:59] your destiny is connected to who you are
[1:25:03] your abilities
[1:25:05] your successes your talents is only
[1:25:07] because of who you are
[1:25:09] you walk around saying when i'm gifted
[1:25:11] and disorderly
[1:25:12] that's because of who you are you know
[1:25:14] these skills are not acquired
[1:25:18] you are your learnings are only helping
[1:25:20] amplify or express what's locked up in
[1:25:23] you
[1:25:28] your ability to survive
[1:25:30] to overcome the bounce back to get back
[1:25:33] up when you fall down we sing a song we
[1:25:36] fall down
[1:25:37] but we get out that ability to we fall
[1:25:41] down
[1:25:42] but we get up
[1:25:45] that's not you we fall down
[1:25:48] but we get up
[1:25:49] and you think you're moving
[1:25:51] but inside there is that seed whenever
[1:25:53] you do something that seed pushes his
[1:25:56] way back up like that lily push we fall
[1:25:58] down
[1:25:59] but we get up
[1:26:04] friends don't forget who you are
[1:26:07] god had to ask job job where was thou
[1:26:10] because the current situation is not
[1:26:12] defining the reality of who you are so i
[1:26:14] want to remind you where we start when i
[1:26:16] lay the foundation of the earth let's go
[1:26:18] back to your representation to your
[1:26:20] experience the way you were before can
[1:26:22] the church say amen
[1:26:25] can we go a little further
[1:26:27] are we enjoying the lord this morning
[1:26:29] visit us we're not crazy
[1:26:31] we're just really serious about making
[1:26:33] it to heaven
[1:26:34] [Applause]
[1:26:36] really really serious about making it to
[1:26:38] heaven
[1:26:39] and not going to hell and getting our
[1:26:41] families to go with us and not leaving
[1:26:44] here sick and living here in joy and
[1:26:46] taken back from the devil what he's told
[1:26:48] from us we're really serious about that
[1:26:50] thing we're not here to talk church we
[1:26:53] hear about god's business we hear about
[1:26:55] the soul winning devil fighting holy
[1:26:58] ghost outpouring kind of revival that's
[1:27:01] what we are motivated by it's what
[1:27:03] drives us what we see should put our
[1:27:05] souls into action to make a church to
[1:27:08] make a revival
[1:27:15] if
[1:27:17] i describe an identity well enough
[1:27:21] you should be able to identify
[1:27:24] who i'm referring to
[1:27:30] so if i were to say
[1:27:33] the tallest person in church
[1:27:37] carries himself very steeply
[1:27:40] very articulate
[1:27:42] he's a gentleman
[1:27:44] has white hair
[1:27:46] could be soft-spoken
[1:27:48] you know he's never the loss for words
[1:27:51] has a beaming smile
[1:27:53] anybody who we're talking about
[1:27:55] clarence people just
[1:28:02] so if i if i describe an identity well
[1:28:05] enough
[1:28:06] you should be able to identify who i'm
[1:28:08] referring to
[1:28:09] so to simplify this process you could
[1:28:11] imagine if i had to come to you and say
[1:28:14] i got a phone call
[1:28:16] from
[1:28:18] he's very tall he has gray hair here and
[1:28:20] i have to go through five minutes to
[1:28:22] describe me every single time you know
[1:28:23] how long it'll take to transmit the
[1:28:25] message
[1:28:27] and you know how harder it gets
[1:28:29] if it's somebody who don't have those
[1:28:31] attributes
[1:28:32] so it's a sister
[1:28:35] who sits on the left side of church
[1:28:38] in between the fourth row and the eighth
[1:28:40] row you there waiting should i figure it
[1:28:42] out figure it out you don't know you
[1:28:44] know where you're going
[1:28:45] you understand the problem right so if i
[1:28:48] describe an identity well enough
[1:28:50] you should be able to know who i'm
[1:28:51] referring to but to simplify this
[1:28:53] process
[1:28:54] we attach names
[1:28:56] to identities
[1:28:58] to make the identification process
[1:29:01] easier
[1:29:03] faster shareable
[1:29:05] so if i see a punch everybody know what
[1:29:06] you're talking about punch
[1:29:08] i can tell you but a punch called man
[1:29:09] you could relate an image comes to your
[1:29:11] mind who are referring to if i say
[1:29:13] brother hugh williams then you know who
[1:29:15] we're talking about
[1:29:18] the more unique an identity
[1:29:20] the easier it is to identify anybody
[1:29:23] with me
[1:29:25] back in the old testament
[1:29:27] god revealed himself to moses
[1:29:30] not by your name
[1:29:32] but he just spoke of his identity
[1:29:34] when moses asked who shall i see sent me
[1:29:37] god didn't give him a name because he
[1:29:38] wasn't ready to be called by a name yet
[1:29:41] he said tell them i am that i am
[1:29:44] give them my identity i am your healer i
[1:29:48] am your restorer i am your waymaker i am
[1:29:51] your baptizer give them my identity
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:57] whenever you speak about me spend time
[1:30:00] describing i am your shield i am your
[1:30:03] reward i am your backlog i am your
[1:30:06] strong tower
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:10] just use my identity
[1:30:13] and for years
[1:30:14] he was his identity
[1:30:17] seven compound redemptive names they
[1:30:20] didn't have one way to talk about him
[1:30:22] they always spoke about him by his
[1:30:24] identity
[1:30:27] jehovah
[1:30:29] jehovah
[1:30:30] jehovah
[1:30:32] jehovah
[1:30:33] to describe god you have to bring out
[1:30:35] this whole description the rose of
[1:30:38] sharon lily of the valley the bright and
[1:30:41] morning star the fairest of ten thousand
[1:31:00] but to give power to the church
[1:31:03] the church had to have a
[1:31:05] key
[1:31:07] to unlock
[1:31:09] to unlock the power faster
[1:31:11] because we need the power faster and we
[1:31:13] need the power wrapped up together in
[1:31:15] one because we don't just wanted jehovah
[1:31:17] gyra jehovah rafa jehovah me see we we
[1:31:20] we want all of god so that's why you say
[1:31:22] in my name
[1:31:24] when jesus came jehovah of the old the
[1:31:27] resume of the old the description of the
[1:31:30] old the identity of the all became
[1:31:32] wrapped up in the lord jesus christ as
[1:31:34] the key to the new
[1:31:36] in my name you shall cast out devils
[1:31:41] whether the devil is sickness and you
[1:31:43] used to call it jehovah rapha that god
[1:31:46] is here now whether it's jehovah jairo
[1:31:48] because you need a present help in time
[1:31:50] of trouble just the name jesus activate
[1:31:52] jehovah rapha and jehovah sharma and
[1:31:55] jehovah nisi and jehovah's oh he called
[1:31:57] you don't hear me this morning
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:03] his name and his identity
[1:32:06] this is one
[1:32:15] this was a great mystery that was god
[1:32:16] was unfolding
[1:32:18] because when jesus was being tempted in
[1:32:20] the wilderness
[1:32:21] the devil never asked him
[1:32:23] about his name
[1:32:26] the devil was trying to figure out if
[1:32:28] this is the one
[1:32:29] so if thou be the devil was trying to
[1:32:31] understand his identity he didn't ask
[1:32:34] him about his abilities its powers you
[1:32:36] see why identity is important
[1:32:38] what we call you brother punch is really
[1:32:40] relevant to know it's your identity the
[1:32:42] devil is afraid of you know even if you
[1:32:44] don't realize but occurrence how much is
[1:32:47] locked up in you
[1:32:48] that identity is what has the devil
[1:32:50] trembling this morning that's why when
[1:32:52] we pray today the identity of those who
[1:32:55] are in this building will be enough with
[1:32:57] the fate of god to see the sick healed
[1:33:00] to see souls delivered to see chains
[1:33:02] break in this house
[1:33:08] identity in the message wisdom versus
[1:33:11] fate
[1:33:13] but the branham said jesus knew who he
[1:33:15] was he knew his identity satan was
[1:33:17] wondering
[1:33:19] i'll leave that right there
[1:33:21] so if jesus
[1:33:23] created a situation and the devil
[1:33:25] himself brother anthony could not even
[1:33:28] identify
[1:33:30] who jesus was
[1:33:32] think about it friends the devil had to
[1:33:34] ask the question you know
[1:33:36] if jesus who was call of god wrapped up
[1:33:38] in flesh the devil couldn't figure out
[1:33:41] and had to get verification and
[1:33:43] confirmation what do you think about you
[1:33:45] with all your fault and weakness right
[1:33:47] now you finally read any devil just
[1:33:49] don't know what to do with you either
[1:33:50] right now you in that if there will be
[1:33:52] phase we never don't know if you're for
[1:33:54] him you're team because one day upon one
[1:33:55] day you're done but this service we are
[1:33:58] ripping out pieces of the devil's
[1:33:59] kingdom that was blocking his view
[1:34:02] of that seed in your soul so he will
[1:34:05] come with a more direct question if you
[1:34:07] be one of those sons who will bring back
[1:34:09] deep ding ding ding ding ding no you're
[1:34:11] in a position to begin to speak anybody
[1:34:12] with me
[1:34:17] names and identities are connected
[1:34:20] when you mention the name
[1:34:23] it creates an expectation
[1:34:25] of the person
[1:34:29] so if you hear that anthony's preaching
[1:34:31] this morning and he would like to
[1:34:32] welcome at the anthony to the pulpit and
[1:34:33] then i show up you say something wrong
[1:34:36] because when you heard the name anthony
[1:34:37] you expect to see anthony
[1:34:39] because the name is connected to the
[1:34:41] person
[1:34:44] let's read hebrews and this is uh we're
[1:34:46] taking a little small walk here because
[1:34:49] this is how i want you to begin to
[1:34:50] practice
[1:34:51] this new walk we're talking about here
[1:34:53] in hebrews 11 chapter of eight by faith
[1:34:56] moses
[1:34:58] when he was born was hit three months of
[1:35:00] his parents
[1:35:01] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:35:04] i didn't want to pause there it's not
[1:35:06] the subject of it but a proper child
[1:35:09] by three months
[1:35:11] what a blessing man
[1:35:14] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:35:16] commandment
[1:35:18] by faith moses this is the script i want
[1:35:20] to get to when he was come to years
[1:35:24] refused
[1:35:26] to be called the son of pharaoh's
[1:35:29] daughter
[1:35:33] so the name
[1:35:34] was already to begin to get into
[1:35:36] conflict
[1:35:37] with an identity that moses moses wasn't
[1:35:40] taught this thing you know it was
[1:35:41] already in him because he was growing up
[1:35:43] in egyptian palace
[1:35:45] he wasn't growing up any synagogue he
[1:35:46] wasn't growing up but something in him
[1:35:48] was growing as well as he was getting
[1:35:49] older this german and the seed the word
[1:35:52] the life the predestination was growing
[1:35:55] too and after a while i couldn't imagine
[1:35:57] whether papa they were calling him but i
[1:35:59] pharaoh's is that is pharaoh's
[1:36:02] daughter's son and after what he said
[1:36:03] but wait no man that is no
[1:36:06] don't call me that
[1:36:08] don't call me that don't call me that
[1:36:10] and i want to begin to encourage you to
[1:36:12] church when the world tries to put a
[1:36:14] label on you of who you are begin to
[1:36:16] tell them don't call me dad
[1:36:19] that's not my name
[1:36:21] that's not who i am
[1:36:23] my identity is in conflict i'm not just
[1:36:26] i'm not a trinidadian no prominent
[1:36:29] i come from god are going back to god
[1:36:31] don't try to put a label on me because
[1:36:33] you don't know who my you don't know my
[1:36:35] identity
[1:36:38] anybody with me this morning
[1:36:44] and we touch on it when there's a
[1:36:47] significant change in the nature
[1:36:49] the identity of a person the name will
[1:36:53] often time bring up the whole identity
[1:36:56] so to signify and permanently identify
[1:36:59] this change and identity
[1:37:02] god himself can't even refer to that
[1:37:05] person the same way
[1:37:07] the change is just too great
[1:37:09] so god establishes a new name
[1:37:12] so that's why when he met and spoke to
[1:37:14] abram by the time he was ministering to
[1:37:17] abram he said listen i need to change
[1:37:19] your name
[1:37:20] because your identity the name you got
[1:37:23] that your father gave you that your
[1:37:25] mother gave you is doesn't speak to your
[1:37:27] identity that i have for you so the name
[1:37:30] abram could no longer work i want to
[1:37:32] call you
[1:37:32] abraham and your wife they call her
[1:37:35] sarai but when i look into her life
[1:37:37] she's dr sarai she's a sarah and when he
[1:37:40] looked at saul the apostle saul he says
[1:37:42] saul your identity is not a soul you're
[1:37:45] really a paul when i look at your life
[1:37:47] that not in connection
[1:37:51] anybody with me jacob jacob that's not
[1:37:53] who you are you're really israel because
[1:37:55] you had a change it's not it's not just
[1:37:57] a change it is not revealing the real
[1:37:59] the real you
[1:38:01] because the old version of you was just
[1:38:03] covered up with sin and muck and maya
[1:38:05] but as it begins to fade away because
[1:38:07] the word comes to you in reality and you
[1:38:09] begin to walk a different walk and walk
[1:38:11] into the plan of god for your life all
[1:38:13] of a sudden you real you begin to stand
[1:38:15] up can the church say amen
[1:38:18] the musicians get ready
[1:38:21] so there's a need a great need for
[1:38:23] deliverance
[1:38:24] from the bondage of your earthly
[1:38:26] identity
[1:38:28] and a restoration to your spiritual
[1:38:32] identity
[1:38:33] we need to separate the identity that
[1:38:35] you see
[1:38:37] that you will cease
[1:38:39] from what
[1:38:40] god sees
[1:38:42] we need to separate who you are from who
[1:38:44] you are not
[1:38:45] and it's because of who you are
[1:38:49] god could grant you the holy ghost it's
[1:38:51] because of who you are he could bring
[1:38:54] healing and deliverance and restoration
[1:38:56] to you
[1:38:58] when you look at samson
[1:39:00] samson
[1:39:02] grew up fine
[1:39:04] upright upbringing
[1:39:07] until he lost sight of who he was
[1:39:10] and we know the story of samson
[1:39:12] rip open the lion and take down the gate
[1:39:15] and all these things
[1:39:17] samson had stepped from behind the wood
[1:39:20] the word was his protection the word was
[1:39:22] his defense
[1:39:23] if he had stayed behind the wood he'd be
[1:39:26] finding him
[1:39:27] and friends if you stay behind you would
[1:39:29] nothing could get to you
[1:39:32] if eve had stayed behind you would not
[1:39:33] even get to eve
[1:39:35] are you with me
[1:39:36] eve step out from behind the wood
[1:39:41] but his mystics
[1:39:43] and his failures
[1:39:44] had pushed him to his purpose
[1:39:47] his failures had pushed him to his
[1:39:49] destiny
[1:39:52] and although samson had found himself
[1:39:54] tied up
[1:39:56] i'm fast forwarding to the end of his
[1:39:57] life
[1:39:59] although samson found himself tied up
[1:40:02] the philistines
[1:40:03] were not taking chances
[1:40:05] they dug out his eyes
[1:40:08] so it was not enough to trap him
[1:40:11] they wanted to make sure that samson
[1:40:13] could not
[1:40:14] see his way
[1:40:17] and that's the devil's goal
[1:40:18] to make sure you don't see your way he
[1:40:20] don't mind you come to church you know
[1:40:23] but he don't want to see your way
[1:40:26] he don't mind you say i'm a good
[1:40:27] christian but he don't want you to see
[1:40:29] the way you're supposed to walk
[1:40:37] can the church say amen
[1:40:42] and samson found themselves as we know
[1:40:45] locked up there
[1:40:48] and the bible says that they came to
[1:40:49] make sport
[1:40:52] of samson
[1:40:55] samson was the main event
[1:41:00] because he was such a problem for them
[1:41:03] that they were celebrating the fact that
[1:41:05] samson had been caught
[1:41:08] and i wonder samson was there hearing
[1:41:11] the
[1:41:11] shoutings because they would have had
[1:41:13] some kind of preliminary events
[1:41:15] leading up to the main
[1:41:16] event what was going through samson's
[1:41:19] mind
[1:41:20] you could begin to play something softly
[1:41:22] as samson was there thinking about his
[1:41:25] life
[1:41:28] if you have ever been in a situation
[1:41:31] paid the hospital the doctor whatever it
[1:41:33] is
[1:41:35] that snaps you out of your routine
[1:41:40] most people end up thinking about their
[1:41:41] life
[1:41:43] how i end up here
[1:41:49] you speak to somebody in a hospital bed
[1:41:51] at that point in time they're not taking
[1:41:52] more money
[1:41:55] they're not thinking about business
[1:41:57] politics the government
[1:42:00] those things will come to mind
[1:42:02] you started thinking about your life
[1:42:07] and i wonder samson was there
[1:42:09] waiting his turn
[1:42:11] as it were
[1:42:13] figuring out when they're going to call
[1:42:14] me
[1:42:16] when they're going to call me
[1:42:20] there's a bit of regret someone would
[1:42:22] have had because he said i know better
[1:42:26] you go back into the scripture the bible
[1:42:28] shows his parents say why don't you
[1:42:30] choose a wife among your own
[1:42:32] that's right
[1:42:37] but samson
[1:42:38] alberta branham
[1:42:40] said god has put red lights
[1:42:44] on the road to helena
[1:42:46] he said when you're driving on the road
[1:42:47] to hell you have to run the red lights
[1:42:50] because god will do everything to stop
[1:42:53] you
[1:42:54] from making a bad decision
[1:42:57] so when you make bad decision after bad
[1:42:59] decision the reality is you are breaking
[1:43:04] traffic lights
[1:43:05] that are designed to stop you
[1:43:09] and god is saying turn around turn back
[1:43:11] turn back turn back don't go this way
[1:43:14] and i can imagine samson saying to
[1:43:16] himself
[1:43:18] what if i listened
[1:43:21] what if
[1:43:22] i didn't follow through with this thing
[1:43:26] i abandoned everything i knew to god on
[1:43:28] this road
[1:43:30] that i knew was wrong because nobody
[1:43:32] does wrong without knowing it wrong or
[1:43:33] not
[1:43:35] are you with me
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:43] but branham said samson wept
[1:43:45] [Music]
[1:43:46] he said he had no eyes
[1:43:49] and he said those socket-less eyes
[1:43:52] he wept
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:59] and i could imagine
[1:44:01] a man who was born to be a leader
[1:44:04] found himself here in the gate opened
[1:44:07] and a young boy coming to lead him
[1:44:11] to be the sport
[1:44:14] and step by step i don't know how long
[1:44:16] they kept him there grinding at the mill
[1:44:19] it may have been a while and he didn't
[1:44:20] have much
[1:44:21] long steps to make but with every step
[1:44:23] he felt the weight of decision
[1:44:26] the weight of life and the consequences
[1:44:29] that brought him to this spot
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:33] and i see you say say little boy leave
[1:44:35] me to the pillars leave me to the
[1:44:36] pillars
[1:44:37] i don't know if samson knew what was
[1:44:38] going to happen or not
[1:44:40] but he was being pushed because there
[1:44:42] was still a seed in him that was tied to
[1:44:44] purpose
[1:44:46] he said lead me to the pillars
[1:44:49] um said as he stood there
[1:44:52] he was ready
[1:44:54] to die
[1:45:00] he knew a price had to be paid
[1:45:04] and he said lord
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:10] remember me
[1:45:13] you did it before
[1:45:16] i just don't want to die alone
[1:45:22] if i have to go down lord
[1:45:26] let me die with these philistines
[1:45:31] and lord and noah messed up
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:34] but these palestines took out eyes they
[1:45:36] didn't put in
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:39] and they had no right
[1:45:42] as bad as i got they had no right
[1:45:45] to take out his eyes
[1:45:48] he said lord avenge me my two eyes
[1:45:52] so i have a challenge to the church to
[1:45:54] the young people to their parents
[1:45:57] are you prepared to die
[1:45:59] i'm not talking about physical death now
[1:46:01] but are you willing to die to your whole
[1:46:03] life
[1:46:05] your old way of living
[1:46:08] you're willing to die and and and take
[1:46:10] down the devil's kingdom around your
[1:46:12] life with you
[1:46:14] so that you could walk in the newness of
[1:46:16] life
[1:46:18] as a new creation because that's what
[1:46:20] god wants
[1:46:21] for the trappings and the life you have
[1:46:23] built up around yourself to create an
[1:46:25] impression in this world that's going to
[1:46:27] hell under fire
[1:46:30] i know they're backsliders here
[1:46:33] i know there are those here who have
[1:46:34] taken god for granted
[1:46:36] taking this message for granted taking
[1:46:39] church for granted
[1:46:40] taking life for granted and every single
[1:46:43] time
[1:46:44] situations come to drive them back to
[1:46:46] god
[1:46:48] sometimes it's death sometimes it's
[1:46:50] hospital sometimes it all kind of stuff
[1:46:52] and then they say lord i need you
[1:46:54] lord i need you
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:46:58] friends if your life has been touched in
[1:47:00] that way i challenge you today
[1:47:03] to make your life right with god
[1:47:07] is there anybody this morning
[1:47:10] who wants to rededicate their life

[1:47:59] everybody god wishes everybody will come
[1:48:01] but this is not for everybody
[1:48:04] but it is a seed in your soul that
[1:48:07] is being touched by this word and you
[1:48:09] realize that this is this is me

[1:51:40] church would walk in
[1:51:41] and get healed
[1:51:43] and people who sat in church for years
[1:51:45] would sit without healing
