[36:09] [Music]
[36:18] are you happy to be in the house of the
[36:20] Lord this morning happy Davina's
[36:22] presence this morning you believed
[36:25] anything had happened we do have two
[36:31] notes of praises since the christine
[36:34] want to give tongues and praise to God
[36:36] for his healing touch two days ago she
[36:39] had severe pains in a left arm from
[36:41] shoulder to fingertip and sister Helen
[36:43] call and prayed with her and she can now
[36:46] lift up a hand and all the pain is gone
[36:49] [Music]
[36:56] also from sister Juliet I'm thanking the
[36:59] Lord from saving my son his wife and
[37:01] their baby from getting in a serious
[37:03] accident yesterday a big truck ran on
[37:07] the side of the vehicle and I'm praising
[37:09] God at all as well so we time God for
[37:10] that this morning
[37:16] can we give the Lord a shout of praise
[37:21] the name the babysitter for a few
[37:24] minutes
[37:27] so when I test the temperature here this
[37:30] morning you know it's kind of cool
[37:32] outside and kinda rainy and stuff you
[37:35] know so but we thank God a we could be
[37:38] in the house of God this morning and
[37:40] that the Lord woke us up this morning
[37:42] and we could be entering his gates with
[37:45] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[37:47] praise and we bring a sacrifice of fries
[37:49] into the house of the Lord can the
[37:53] church say Amen it's a sacrifice of
[37:56] praise because it has to cost us
[37:57] something hallelu is a sacrifice of
[38:00] praise because there has to be a course
[38:02] there's a price that must be paid to be
[38:06] able to access his presence so we turn
[38:08] Lord for bringing us into the house of
[38:10] the Lord this morning and certainly at
[38:12] this time I want to salute I don't see
[38:15] her upstairs some but I still want to
[38:18] extend the greeting because I don't want
[38:19] to get into the message without doing it
[38:21] but today but over insist over it
[38:23] celebrate 40 years of marriage to be
[38:29] [Music]
[38:30] to limine office that's a generation
[38:34] that's a generation god bless you richly
[38:37] appreciate our pastor this morning
[38:46] [Music]
[38:49] sister will be no doubt helping get
[38:51] prepared for what has to happen after
[38:53] service today so 40 years later
[38:56] generation leader I get to preach to him
[39:00] Alleluia so we thank God for His grace
[39:02] and His mercy you know and as we come
[39:05] down to the end of 2019 and approach
[39:11] 2020 it is just amazing how God works in
[39:15] a way that many times we cannot
[39:17] understand and he chooses to do it that
[39:20] way because he takes pleasure in doing
[39:23] things outside of our understanding and
[39:26] he will choose to reveal when he wants
[39:28] to reveal his plan he will choose to
[39:30] reveal it to whomever he wants to reveal
[39:32] it to under way he wants to reveal it to
[39:35] so in the meantime our only commitment
[39:38] is to stay on the word that is revealed
[39:40] to us and to stay in his presence to
[39:42] stay in worship stay under expectation
[39:44] and we can't get upset with God if we
[39:47] don't see something yet because when he
[39:48] chooses to reveal it that's only when we
[39:51] can even see it can the church say man
[39:53] so I'm happy this morning to be able to
[39:57] bring a thought to you this morning and
[40:00] as we come to the end of the year and
[40:01] you know sometimes people get so
[40:03] legalistic we we understand that Christ
[40:05] was not born on December 25th we know
[40:07] that that's that's not a degree but at
[40:11] the same time it's a profit many times I
[40:13] come and bring a called the Christmas
[40:15] message a Christmas message you know so
[40:18] I have a little Christmas message to
[40:21] bring to the church from a little
[40:23] different perspective this morning
[40:25] but I felt led and I bring some thoughts
[40:29] encourage you along the way because as I
[40:31] was studying the scripture and reading
[40:34] the wood I I stumble onto something and
[40:36] I started to look at it closer and
[40:37] closer and closer my and it's something
[40:40] that I'm sure we know but when you look
[40:42] at it deeper you recognize the grease of
[40:43] God and the goodness of God and I I saw
[40:46] myself in the story and I say I have to
[40:48] share with somebody so I cooperate over
[40:50] that's a word of it what do you think of
[40:51] this because this thing pulsating in my
[40:54] heart I can't believe God could be so
[40:55] good to me and if you can be so good to
[40:58] me I have to share it with somebody you
[41:00] know and when this gospel becomes a
[41:02] reality to you you know because many
[41:03] times we come to church and somehow or
[41:06] the other a lot of people forget when
[41:08] they've been in church for a while that
[41:09] he came from a messed up situation you
[41:13] know it's almost like if they're one of
[41:14] years you know the Bible or you know the
[41:16] message you kind of forget forget where
[41:18] you came from now we're not talking
[41:21] model try to remember your sins
[41:22] animistic because it's under the sea of
[41:24] forgetfulness but it must be a never
[41:26] that you lose that connection with God's
[41:29] grace towards us because it was never
[41:31] our effort our ability our learning in
[41:34] any way form or fashion for us to be
[41:37] where we are today if it had not been
[41:39] for the Lord we wouldn't even be in the
[41:40] house of God this morning and it's good
[41:43] to be reminded that it was his love that
[41:46] projected it was not our love that
[41:48] projected to bring Jesus on the scene
[41:50] but his love was so great that he saw us
[41:54] at the point of our need when we
[41:56] couldn't do anything about it and his
[41:58] love was bigger than our situation his
[42:01] glove was bigger than our pasta his love
[42:04] was bigger than our mistake and that's
[42:06] the reason we could shout that's the
[42:08] reason we could come to service that's
[42:10] the reason we could access healing
[42:12] because it's not the merit of our pass
[42:14] but it's a feed connected to the love of
[42:17] God and the promises that he has made to
[42:20] us through his word and these promises
[42:22] could never fail because God had never
[42:25] lied
[42:26] and his work could never contradict
[42:27] itself so when God speaks something it
[42:30] has got to come to pass doesn't matter
[42:32] how long it takes that's a matter which
[42:34] way it takes it what road he has to go
[42:37] but it's gonna come to pass can the
[42:39] church say man you may be seated
[42:44] hallelujah hallelujah so I have to do
[42:48] something little different this morning
[42:49] because before I get to the scripture I
[42:52] kind of want to build up to the
[42:53] scripture a little bit if that's okay
[42:55] I wouldn't call it comments before the
[42:57] message but I do want to strike
[42:58] something on the Prophet so I could read
[43:00] the scripture in the context of it can
[43:02] the church say man so if the message the
[43:06] first seal with a random Essene last
[43:09] evening to background it's just a little
[43:11] more we find that when John looked and
[43:13] seen that book still in the hands of the
[43:17] original owner God you remember how it
[43:19] was lost by Adam he forfeited the book
[43:22] of life
[43:23] they need new remanent for the knowledge
[43:25] of Satan and lost his inheritance he
[43:28] lost everything and there was no way for
[43:31] redemption then God made in the likeness
[43:34] of man come down and become a redeemer
[43:36] to us to redeem us and now we find out
[43:39] in these pass these things which was
[43:41] mysterious is to be open up to us in the
[43:44] last days so there has to come a point
[43:46] when it is no longer mysterious and it
[43:49] will open up to us and when it is open
[43:52] up to us it becomes a vision that we
[43:54] could write that is now plain that when
[43:56] we read it we can run which mean go into
[43:58] action can the church say Amen now we
[44:00] find out also in this that are soon as
[44:02] John heard this announcement for the
[44:05] kinsman redeemer to come forth and to
[44:08] make his claims there was no man that to
[44:10] do it no man in heaven no man in it no
[44:15] man beneath it
[44:16] no one was worthy to even look at the
[44:20] book so John was in pain because he knew
[44:23] that if this book was not open up we
[44:26] were in trouble forever
[44:28] John knew that if nobody came and tear
[44:31] the seals of this book and take this
[44:33] book we will be finished
[44:35] think about it a prophet said no person
[44:37] at all worthy to even look upon the book
[44:41] hallelujah can the church say Amen and
[44:43] John just started weeping
[44:45] that's a prophet John just started
[44:47] weeping because he realized that it was
[44:50] finished it was lost because if nobody
[44:52] was worthy to open the book you might as
[44:55] well cry you might as well sigh you
[44:57] might as well give up you might as well
[44:59] throw your hands up in the air he know
[45:01] that there was no chance of redemption
[45:03] then everything was filled and quickly
[45:06] when I ran him said we find his weeping
[45:08] stopping can the church say man because
[45:12] it was announced by one of the four
[45:14] beasts or the elders rather when I don't
[45:16] weep John for the Lion of the tribe of
[45:19] Judah had prevailed in other words
[45:22] overcome and has conquered John turning
[45:24] he saw a lamb coming out here nothing
[45:27] was a lion of the tribe of Judah but the
[45:30] Lion of the tribe of Judah was coming
[45:32] for us alone hallelujah
[45:35] the announcement wasn't calling somebody
[45:36] else it was the same lamb that was the
[45:39] Lion of the tribe of Judah it was the
[45:41] same one that was the Alpha that was OB
[45:44] Omega it was the same one that was the
[45:47] root of David and the offspring of David
[45:50] you don't have to try to figure it out
[45:52] it's just who he is he is bigger than
[45:55] the world he's bigger than the stars he
[45:57] is el-shaddai he is show whole bunch IRA
[46:00] kind of Church Daymond John turned he
[46:05] didn't see a lion he saw a lamb coming
[46:08] out he must have been bloody and cut and
[46:11] wounded it had been slain a lamb that
[46:14] had been seen of course it was chilled
[46:16] bloody but a mess it was still bloody if
[46:18] you had cut the lamb and kill it the way
[46:21] in the lamb was anyhow it was back to
[46:23] pieces on a cross Spears in the side
[46:26] nails in the hands and feet falls over
[46:30] the brow he was in an awful condition
[46:32] and this lamb in an awful condition him
[46:36] Porton went over to him that sat upon
[46:38] the throne that held a complete
[46:41] fatal year of redemption it was not part
[46:44] of the deal
[46:45] it was the complete title deed of
[46:47] retention every redemptive nursing every
[46:51] right that could be activated every
[46:53] government that was given from Abraham
[46:56] or now - now was locked up in that book
[46:59] of retention what God said to Adam about
[47:02] Dominion was locked up in that book of
[47:04] redemption and for the first time since
[47:10] Adam can the church say man that book
[47:13] was good getting back into the hands of
[47:15] a rightful owners can the church say man
[47:17] that held the complete title deed every
[47:20] tension and the Lamb goes that takes the
[47:22] book out of the hand of him that sat
[47:25] upon the throne and took and open the
[47:27] seals and open the book and then what
[47:29] happened we found out that that there
[47:31] must have been a great something took
[47:33] place in heaven for the elders under for
[47:35] 20 elders and their peace and everything
[47:37] in heaven began a cry worthy worthy
[47:39] worthy worthy
[47:41] here come the interim part of the vials
[47:43] of the prayers of scenes the scenes
[47:45] under the author screamer worthy at the
[47:48] olam for you have redeemed us and now
[47:50] you have made us kings and priests and
[47:52] we shall reign on it oh my that's when
[47:56] he opened that book
[47:58] now listen this is what I want to get to
[48:00] you may be seated and we'll read the
[48:02] scripture you see this book was actually
[48:04] planned this is a prophet and written
[48:07] before the foundation of the world this
[48:11] book this Bible was really written
[48:13] before the foundation of the world and
[48:15] Christ being the lamb was slain before
[48:18] the foundation of the world and the
[48:20] members of his bride
[48:21] their names were put in the Lamb's Book
[48:24] of Life before the foundation of the
[48:26] world but it's been sealed up and now
[48:29] it's being revealed whose names were in
[48:32] there all about it and what a great
[48:35] thing
[48:43] you may be seated and John when he saw
[48:47] it he said everything in heaven
[48:49] everything underneath it
[48:51] everything heard him saying Amen
[48:53] blessing and honor he just really was
[48:55] having a great time for the lamb was
[48:58] worthy
[48:59] hallelujah amen
[49:05] are you ready for the word this morning
[49:08] can we go to the Bible just one portion
[49:12] of Scripture this morning pray to be a
[49:18] blessing to you see what the Lord will
[49:21] do this morning hallelujah
[49:28] reading from Matthew 1 reading from for

[49:55] so we're reading the book of the
[49:58] generation of Jesus Christ the Son of
[50:01] David the son of Abraham
[50:04] that verse alone is a message because
[50:08] this is introducing something so matthew
[50:11] is writing and he's right - in a level
[50:12] of authority he is bold enough to
[50:15] declare what you're about to read is the
[50:17] book of the generation of Jesus Christ
[50:19] who is the son of David in case you
[50:21] didn't know who is also the son of
[50:23] Abraham and many times I was sharing
[50:26] with somebody we read Matthew and we

[52:04] joseph the husband of mary of whom was
[52:06] born Jesus who is called Christ so all
[52:09] the generations from Abraham to give it
[52:11] up fourteen generations and from people
[52:14] until the carrying away into Babylon are
[52:16] fourteen generations and from the
[52:18] carrying away into Babylon unto Christ
[52:21] are fourteen generations now the birth
[52:23] of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as
[52:26] his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[52:28] before they came together she was found
[52:30] out with child of the Holy Ghost
[52:32] I mean Joseph her husband being a just
[52:35] man I'm not willing to make her a public
[52:38] example was minded to put her away
[52:41] privily and while he thought on these
[52:43] things behold the angel of the Lord
[52:45] appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[52:47] Joseph thou son of David
[52:49] we have not taken to thee Mary thy wife
[52:51] for that which is conceived of her is of
[52:54] the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth
[52:56] a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[52:58] for he shall save his people from their
[53:01] sins now all this was done that it might
[53:05] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[53:07] Lord by the Prophet saying behold a
[53:09] virgin shall be with child and shall
[53:11] bring forth a son and they shall call
[53:13] his name Emmanuel which being
[53:15] interpreted is God with us then Joseph
[53:18] being raised from sleep did as the end
[53:20] of the Lord had pitted him and took unto
[53:22] him his wife and knew her not till she
[53:24] had brought forth her first son and he
[53:26] called his name Jesus middle ordered a
[53:28] blessing to the reading of his word you
[53:30] may be seated
[53:34] everybody feeling fine where is he going
[53:40] of a title this morning the continuation
[53:43] of the book of the generation of Jesus
[53:46] rice the continuation of the book of the
[53:51] generation of Jesus Christ you know so I
[53:55] was doing some study and I gonna kind of
[53:57] take my time not gonna be too long but I
[53:59] just wanna kind of take my time a little
[54:00] bit this morning and in looking at the
[54:05] scriptures I was having a conversation I
[54:08] was saying you know when you read
[54:09] Matthew Mark Luke and John it's really
[54:12] four different perspectives of the same
[54:15] scenario so it's as if something happens
[54:18] on the road and one person is driving by
[54:21] and saying was a blue car that I saw and
[54:23] somebody else drives by and said there
[54:24] were two people in the car and somebody
[54:26] else drives by and says he was driving
[54:28] on the wrong side of the road and then
[54:30] somebody else sees something else
[54:31] there's a policeman flag them down so if
[54:34] you take one piece of the story a
[54:36] policeman flag them down that's all you
[54:38] have but when you bring it all together
[54:39] you get a blue car driving on the wrong
[54:42] side a road with two participants I got
[54:44] flag down because the policeman saw them
[54:46] can the church say men you get the whole
[54:49] story so God in His grace allowed
[54:51] Matthew Mark Luke and John to capture
[54:54] different perspectives of the scenario
[54:57] that took place in that day so that when
[54:59] you read the scriptures there should be
[55:01] no contradiction it should all be the
[55:03] same thing because God is not the author
[55:05] of confusion everything must make sense
[55:07] everything must line up it may take time
[55:09] for your understanding to be open about
[55:11] what it is but it is the Word of God
[55:13] speaking to us so we can connect to what
[55:16] things are can the church say man so as
[55:20] I was reading Matthew wanted I was gonna
[55:22] see whether the book of the generation
[55:24] of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son
[55:26] of Abraham
[55:28] a while back I preached a message about
[55:30] David a man after God's own hands and it
[55:35] really struck me when I was preaching
[55:37] about David and how David was being
[55:40] built up and he was a young boy and no
[55:42] doubt everyone is born in sin and shaped
[55:44] iniquity and and you see the hand of God
[55:46] upon David you see him with the lion and
[55:48] the bear you see him with good light and
[55:50] you see all of this you see David
[55:52] conquer Goliath you see David rise up
[55:56] among his people you see him being the
[55:58] king that was named king and the king
[56:00] didn't even know there was a new king
[56:02] that's how much God loved David to seek
[56:05] God is the only one who could fire you
[56:07] and have your replacement right there
[56:09] waiting for you
[56:10] when Saul is sitting on the throne the
[56:13] holy the Bible said there's a spirit of
[56:15] God left him and the Spirit of God came
[56:18] back into the palace when David came
[56:21] back with a heart the shooter quarter
[56:24] was already anointing T but can the
[56:25] church seaman and I was thinking about
[56:28] the story I see when Jesus came because
[56:31] Jesus came in four names son of God son
[56:35] of man son of David and also son of
[56:38] Abraham can the church say Amen
[56:40] we don't speak too much of a son of
[56:42] Abraham but he is son of Abraham
[56:43] we spent a lot of time son of man son of
[56:46] God son of David but your son of Abraham
[56:48] but Abraham said it four names can I
[56:50] just say man so when I saw sit how could
[56:53] Almighty God choose to have Jesus be
[56:59] comfortable to see son of David when
[57:01] David really messed up as you study as
[57:05] he David went after a man's wife
[57:10] orchestrated and her husband to the
[57:12] front line to fight deliberately it
[57:16] wasn't an accidental positioning he said
[57:18] put a smile in the front line knowing
[57:21] that the first line goes and I seen but
[57:24] God looked at this man quality of it as
[57:27] it is the man after my own heart and God
[57:30] overlooked his failures God overlooked
[57:33] his mistakes and sent out of your
[57:35] generation Stephen will be all the kings
[57:37] and I said God is so different from our
[57:43] thinking because we could be so
[57:45] judgmental that went somebody make a
[57:47] mistake we don't want to associate with
[57:49] them we were to repair that we do even
[57:52] know them we want to write him up but
[57:53] God is nothing the business I realize
[57:55] the writin of anybody I can't find it in
[57:59] Scripture
[57:59] I've got writing off anybody so it blew
[58:02] my mind when I just looked at test
[58:04] David's relationship to Christ and what
[58:07] pleased he was to be son of David
[58:11] can the church say Amen and then when
[58:14] you read Matthew you start to discover
[58:16] something very interesting can you go
[58:18] with me a bit this morning we're going
[58:19] to preach a bit in a while now when you
[58:22] look to scripture genealogies
[58:24] generational messaging in Scripture
[58:27] almost always excludes females
[58:30] it's always the male that I mentioned so
[58:33] when a female is mentioned it is
[58:35] significant can the church say Amen so I
[58:41] try to understand because I'm looking at
[58:43] my walk I'm looking at our walk and many
[58:47] times you say no but boy I really messed
[58:49] up I made a mistake
[58:51] I don't know how and many time the devil
[58:52] come to us with what you did last week
[58:54] what did it last year what family you
[58:57] come from what your parents may have
[58:59] done what your grandfather may have done
[59:01] and all this and bring up bring all this
[59:03] negativity to us it's only self
[59:05] righteous people can relate to this and
[59:11] I said to read Matthew and I realize
[59:13] that in Matthew references firewoman
[59:20] so to be mentioned firstly energy
[59:23] genealogical record a generation record
[59:25] is significant but this one is different
[59:27] this is not any record we're talking
[59:30] about this is the book of the generation
[59:32] of Jesus Christ now this is Matthew but
[59:35] a kindly who is writing this is Matthew
[59:38] the accountant
[59:39] this is Matthew the record keeper
[59:41] Matthew had the option of leaving stuff
[59:44] out if you wanted to but the fact that
[59:48] he left certain things in here means
[59:50] that we supposed to take note of what he
[59:53] had in here 10 the church amen
[59:56] hallelujah if it was not important it
[59:59] would not be here but when the Branham
[1:00:01] taught us if you don't if you read the
[1:00:03] Bible and don't see Jesus in every verse
[1:00:05] of scripture you need to read it again
[1:00:07] because every word here is important
[1:00:10] every scripture is given for a purpose
[1:00:13] so no scripture as as simple as it may
[1:00:16] be is just yet to take up space quato
[1:00:18] have time to put his word in book form
[1:00:21] but to take up space so we want to find
[1:00:25] out this morning what lesson God wants
[1:00:28] us to learn from this that no matter
[1:00:31] what mistake you have made no matter
[1:00:33] what Paul you may have fallen there is
[1:00:35] redemption for you because this book of
[1:00:38] the generation of Jesus Christ is a book
[1:00:40] of the story of retention how God to
[1:00:43] take broken pieces and put it back
[1:00:46] together again how God was applying
[1:00:49] blood before the world even began
[1:00:51] he was already slain to make a way for
[1:00:54] these people to make it because if he
[1:00:56] didn't do it they wouldn't stand a
[1:00:58] chance and if he didn't do it you
[1:01:00] wouldn't stand a chance and if you
[1:01:02] didn't do it I wasn't send a chance and
[1:01:04] the church team and everybody feeling
[1:01:08] fine can the church say man
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:18] so as you read the scripture Abraham
[1:01:22] begat Isaac we notice so the first part
[1:01:24] of the whole of Matthew's about the
[1:01:26] patriarchs we know it Abraham Isaac and
[1:01:29] Jacob and he's going on and Judah and
[1:01:33] then we find the first female as
[1:01:35] mentioned it's five along we know them
[1:01:38] right Thema is the first everybody with
[1:01:42] me
[1:01:43] we have Rahab we have Ruth
[1:01:47] we have Bathsheba and then we have Mary
[1:01:51] and God chose to use these five women
[1:01:54] with some real interesting stories now
[1:01:59] when you think about it some of you
[1:02:00] wonder Lord why put me this family why
[1:02:03] you put me in this country why didn't
[1:02:05] hammer grew up under a nice little house
[1:02:08] and nobody to I'm to think that Jesus
[1:02:11] had he had a choice
[1:02:12] he could have choose to be in the home
[1:02:15] of somebody who always went to church
[1:02:16] every morning at 9:00 a.m. and they
[1:02:18] never miss church and he could he had a
[1:02:21] choice I want you to get this we didn't
[1:02:24] have a choice what family we were born
[1:02:26] in but he write the book before it even
[1:02:29] happened so he had a choice and he
[1:02:32] choose to confirm him minds of your eyes
[1:02:34] with how he choose to even come I think
[1:02:40] I wanna say that one more time then you
[1:02:43] have a choice with who your father was
[1:02:45] did you have a choice who your
[1:02:47] grandfather was so if your grandfather
[1:02:49] was the highway robber who brick did you
[1:02:52] up you couldn't do anything about it
[1:02:53] this was just the hand that you were
[1:02:55] dealt
[1:02:55] but Jesus was different before Adam was
[1:02:59] even on the earth he knew Joseph and
[1:03:02] Mary was going to be the house that he
[1:03:04] wanted a crop in he picked the house in
[1:03:06] advance hundreds of years before even
[1:03:08] Kim he picked the house because he had
[1:03:11] to eat food

[1:05:55] wanted so he could prove that he's
[1:05:58] someone who raised you he could prove
[1:06:00] he's someone who fed you he could prove
[1:06:02] he's the one who delivered you that's
[1:06:05] the way he would even be seated for a
[1:06:12] minute I don't know where but can the
[1:06:20] church see man so it's a power of choice
[1:06:23] certain choices God keeps for himself
[1:06:26] certain choices he gives to us he didn't
[1:06:29] give us a choice to choose our reach he
[1:06:31] didn't give us a choice to choose our
[1:06:33] height he didn't give us a choice to
[1:06:35] choose our genetic structure but he gave
[1:06:37] us a choice to worship he gave us a
[1:06:39] choice to praise Him he gave us a choice
[1:06:41] see hallelujah anyhow don't let don't
[1:06:45] ever keep me down that's what I have

[1:06:58] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:07:01] the sooner you learn that there's a
[1:07:04] difference between what you can control
[1:07:07] and what you cannot control all your
[1:07:09] worries stops most of the things you
[1:07:12] worry about and stuff you cannot control
[1:07:15] come on you cannot control your children
[1:07:18] why worry about them turn them over to
[1:07:21] the Lord he can take care of them can
[1:07:29] the church say Amen
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:35] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:07:39] most of the stuff you stress about you
[1:07:41] cannot control you they are stuck in
[1:07:44] traffic and you stressed out you can
[1:07:45] control it you move in
[1:07:57] you have to separate what you can
[1:07:59] control from what can be and cannot be
[1:08:02] controlled you have to separate what God
[1:08:04] has written about you and the choices
[1:08:06] you have because he doesn't choose for
[1:08:07] you it's your choice but his
[1:08:11] foreknowledge saw your choice before you
[1:08:13] even here and that's how we can creat
[1:08:14] destined 8-u these unfor what every day
[1:08:19] we have choices every day we have
[1:08:20] decisions to make can the church seaman
[1:08:25] Abraham had a choice when God said walk
[1:08:28] before me and be thou perfect he had a
[1:08:31] choice when God said to him come out of
[1:08:33] your people into a place I'm gonna shoot
[1:08:36] come on now somebody preach back to me
[1:08:38] I'm Abraham left cheek in a city whose
[1:08:43] builder and maker was God
[1:08:45] whenever I'm left he thought he would
[1:08:48] find that he didn't know will sell me
[1:08:50] wait till for that city what he talking
[1:08:53] fine that city somebody peeps flat to me
[1:08:56] this morning you may be seated
[1:09:09] so court shows how he would come and
[1:09:14] that's one of the reasons why we've seen
[1:09:16] later on the Pharisees and me had such a
[1:09:19] problem with him because he wasn't born
[1:09:23] in the priesthood he wasn't he wasn't
[1:09:25] born that's why John the Baptist was
[1:09:27] such an anomaly you saw those names
[1:09:33] Salah TL Abby you'd suru barbell Zadok L
[1:09:38] you'd ELISA Martin and Rehab John
[1:09:48] all them multi-syllable names then they
[1:09:52] have just John Doe fight someone crying
[1:09:54] there whether it's who recruited him who
[1:09:56] ordained him who choose him whose school
[1:09:58] he went to
[1:09:59] who here is up under whose ministry was
[1:10:02] he grew manna whose ministry what was
[1:10:06] his pedigree
[1:10:07] what is his generation because people
[1:10:10] listening to John and I don't know what
[1:10:12] church she was in before he started his
[1:10:14] church got me this morning but that's
[1:10:19] how God operates he chooses to confound
[1:10:22] the wise those who think they would know
[1:10:27] another theologian said when Matthew was
[1:10:30] writing he wrote in such a way to stick
[1:10:34] the Jews a little bit so that when they
[1:10:40] finally accepted Jesus's they recognized
[1:10:42] early story wasn't really you know there
[1:10:45] was some there's some stuff in his story
[1:10:49] and it's self-righteousness you when the
[1:10:51] carrier server round they're stuck
[1:10:53] listen is there anybody here who have
[1:10:54] stuff in yours
[1:10:59] we can just look over the people for me
[1:11:01] and see if there's anybody who doesn't
[1:11:03] have a story this is my story this is my
[1:11:12] song praising my Savior all the day long
[1:11:19] so as I was looking at a simple wait a
[1:11:21] minute not only did God choose how he
[1:11:27] wanted to come and the line he wants you
[1:11:29] to come true but he didn't even hide it
[1:11:31] that is he pawed by the gorge that blew
[1:11:34] my mind really were anything about it
[1:11:36] because listen to how it's written
[1:11:39] everybody with me the Sunday school this
[1:11:42] morning I know is that he normal
[1:11:44] Christmas kinda messy after forgive me
[1:11:45] what is he little measure there go give
[1:11:48] me right so Abraham begat Isaac
[1:11:52] everybody at least no depart Isaac begat
[1:11:56] Jacob who we know his name became Israel
[1:11:59] and Jacob but I said begat Judas and his
[1:12:02] Gretchen and listen or descriptor Ruiz
[1:12:05] and Judas begat Phares and Zara and I
[1:12:08] could have left it right there you know
[1:12:09] and then you could go on and far as we
[1:12:13] got as wrong but I thought about read it
[1:12:15] said and you will be Godfather Sarah
[1:12:17] often mom so I say but but if it was me
[1:12:20] now if I tell you right and this is when
[1:12:24] people are playing for a job and it
[1:12:27] right here to rescue me people that's
[1:12:29] right
[1:12:30] watch none when your readers are many
[1:12:32] many people who write it you want really
[1:12:34] talk about a cellphone
[1:12:37] I have yet to find somebody who put
[1:12:39] these stop there do wrong in the resume
[1:12:46] nobody else tell you you know like
[1:12:49] everybody couldn't anybody good in
[1:12:52] Microsoft Office everybody I have to
[1:12:53] find somebody who has openly admitted
[1:12:55] and not being good in Microsoft Office
[1:12:57] everybody good in would in Excel and
[1:13:00] PowerPoint so no you don't you know what
[1:13:02] we do now we said I'll create your good
[1:13:03] good yeah but our do an Excel
[1:13:06] spreadsheet with pivot tables women do
[1:13:11] you really could only say well I am not
[1:13:12] that good there are those who don't know
[1:13:16] and they say well let me start and
[1:13:19] invariably after one hour you like I
[1:13:21] really get too far but nobody puts stuff
[1:13:26] in their story that would meet this
[1:13:28] story look cheeky but here we find Matt
[1:13:32] you not covering up you know anyway -
[1:13:34] but cover up and there's no conspiracy
[1:13:36] this what I love about God is
[1:13:37] transparent you know that's why the
[1:13:39] Bible said confess your faults one to
[1:13:41] another
[1:13:42] I understand iron because his listen is
[1:13:45] redemption we talking about and Judas
[1:13:49] begat Phares and Zara of tema so I don't
[1:13:53] want to go too deep into your mind
[1:13:55] because Timmons were no stories they
[1:13:57] have these these acronyms they work now
[1:13:58] not suitable for work dear my story not
[1:14:02] not not not right here but his short
[1:14:05] version of tema Judah had three sons
[1:14:09] this is Israel and Judah had reasons the
[1:14:12] first son maritima
[1:14:15] the Bible said he was so horrible to
[1:14:17] that girl
[1:14:18] God killer
[1:14:20] under the law when a woman's husband
[1:14:23] dies her brother his brother supposed to
[1:14:27] marry her so Judah's second son is
[1:14:31] obligated to marítima and he marries her
[1:14:35] the baby said he was so horrible to her
[1:14:38] to kill him - so Judah lose his two sons
[1:14:42] today's woman caught him on the third
[1:14:45] son is too young to marry so Judah tells
[1:14:49] tear my tema when he grew up he were
[1:14:53] married but he Bible said in two days
[1:14:55] hot he said not this last boy this woman
[1:15:00] none taken were two first sons already
[1:15:02] let me hide this boy so the Bible said
[1:15:10] Judas cemetery every other widows who
[1:15:13] could never find out the self and not
[1:15:15] and if ever said eventually after some
[1:15:19] time passed he might gets word that the
[1:15:21] youngest son is now of age but she has
[1:15:23] got no phone call she again oh what's up
[1:15:26] she again no text message Julia come on
[1:15:28] check out these young bro yeah come on
[1:15:30] check ups you say about already going on
[1:15:32] here do not give me his word that's when
[1:15:34] this young boy grows up no this is a
[1:15:38] story that's already started a girl
[1:15:40] shaky right so the Bible said that tear
[1:15:42] my hood hood that Judah was coming into
[1:15:47] the area she was in there the Bible says
[1:15:48] she dressed herself as a prostitute
[1:15:51] and deceived Judah and out of that union
[1:15:58] came twins one of them is called fairies
[1:16:03] and that boy born out of that messed up
[1:16:07] situation is named in the lineage that
[1:16:11] led to Jesus now it would have been
[1:16:15] easier for Matthew to guess a and Israel
[1:16:17] begat true durand-ruel a bigger fire
[1:16:19] Ambrose nobody whole thing but God is
[1:16:22] showing there people with messed up
[1:16:23] stories and even in because the Bible
[1:16:27] said Judah when he found her what she
[1:16:29] had did he said she's more righteous
[1:16:31] than I am because she was seeking
[1:16:33] justice based on the promise he had made
[1:16:35] to her to give her a lesson
[1:16:43] why didn't go and hide the story so we
[1:16:48] have the first one
[1:16:48] tima the one who pretended to be a
[1:16:50] prostitute then we all know the story of
[1:16:53] Rahab she was a prostitute children of
[1:16:59] Israel trying to go into Jericho send
[1:17:03] spies over to surprised and looking for
[1:17:05] them and when you read it you see most
[1:17:06] people reading scriptures when vitami
[1:17:11] solders cannot speculate that it has to
[1:17:13] visit us there ray about time hiding
[1:17:16] many back the Bible said under the cover
[1:17:18] of the roof in the house I heard
[1:17:21] somebody said I was the first undercover
[1:17:22] agents they were literally undercover
[1:17:28] and when they went to rehab rehab say
[1:17:30] they'd already gone if you run now you
[1:17:33] might still catch them and rehab because
[1:17:38] of her profession already got word from
[1:17:41] all the passers-by about what happened
[1:17:43] to the Red Sea
[1:17:44] what happened he'll asking what happened
[1:17:47] so by the time that man reached her
[1:17:49] house she said Anna I hear all these
[1:17:52] stories your anger and wind all I was
[1:17:56] remember me remember me she didn't
[1:18:00] actually tension she didn't actress
[1:18:02] Alsatian yes I remember me she didn't
[1:18:06] know how it's gonna work out but I can
[1:18:08] see this story is a story of redemption
[1:18:10] and one of those men was anointed he
[1:18:14] give her a call is he hung this cold
[1:18:15] outside of your window it's a red cord
[1:18:19] it's a sign of blood cord this is like

[1:19:29] but he didn't know his story was already
[1:19:31] written because he didn't know that he
[1:19:35] was bad because he along with her Ahab

[1:20:19] roots and Buddy mime type so truth
[1:20:21] I've only could see it but I just is
[1:20:23] kind of having a conversation this
[1:20:24] morning I've already quotes a check but
[1:20:26] nobody kinsman-redeemer all of this
[1:20:27] stuff and rutan de nexus to offer and
[1:20:32] Naomi I me or me say what I have to call
[1:20:33] because you know come out with people I
[1:20:35] know if I say well all right good one I
[1:20:38] would say wherever you go I go where you
[1:20:41] Lodge where you die I die she didn't
[1:20:43] even know how steep but she was walking
[1:20:45] in a story that was already written he
[1:20:47] was a character in the story walking
[1:20:50] towards a destination because she was
[1:20:53] part of the lineage of the generation of
[1:20:56] Jesus Christ no you were sitting for a
[1:21:00] minute
[1:21:01] I have polished up to here but she's a
[1:21:03] Moabite she's an idol worshiper and
[1:21:06] there's a scripture that says no more
[1:21:09] bites supposed to go into the temple for
[1:21:11] up to ten generations and God pull up
[1:21:14] more bite into the story and brother
[1:21:17] branham said so when you trace the
[1:21:19] lineage of Jesus he is part to project
[1:21:22] I'll out of the relationship between
[1:21:25] pause and reach God wolf that Gentiles
[1:21:28] into the lineage of Jesus truth so he
[1:21:37] could be a kinsman redeemer support you
[1:21:39] and Gentiles to the bond and the free to
[1:21:42] the lame and the shake somebody please
[1:21:45] back to me
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:52] hallelujah anybody feeling fine
[1:21:57] so-called walk the chain that into the
[1:21:59] story God knew how to do it how to move
[1:22:08] the pieces together to ensure that his
[1:22:10] law can never be broken that nobody
[1:22:12] could see he wasn't qualified that he
[1:22:14] couldn't do it kinda just a man no
[1:22:20] scripture contradict itself and now we
[1:22:23] move onto a DVD DVD king begat solomon
[1:22:28] of her that had been the wife of urias
[1:22:31] we know the story about sheba
[1:22:35] and although order livid Wahoo's etc go
[1:22:41] choose the adulterous relationship the
[1:22:45] messed-up story - premiered emption not
[1:22:48] that he was supporting it or endorsing
[1:22:50] it but he was bringing Redemption
[1:22:52] because when man fell that curse of sin
[1:22:58] was true all all man so there was no
[1:23:02] perfect person to use the message of
[1:23:05] perfection could only be preached after
[1:23:07] Jesus comes because he was the only
[1:23:10] perfect one so God had no choice but to
[1:23:14] use imperfection to bring for perfection
[1:23:18] let me say one more time God had no
[1:23:22] choice but to use imperfection to bring
[1:23:25] what perfection but when that which is
[1:23:28] perfect is come that opens the door for
[1:23:33] perfection to be manifested in sons and
[1:23:36] daughters of God
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:43] you may be seated
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:55] can the church say man anybody feeling
[1:23:58] fine so if you think you have a story
[1:24:02] you know but around you see if my father
[1:24:04] was a drunkard he's not cookies and then
[1:24:06] there's a coda how many say he said I am
[1:24:08] NOT the son he connect back to his
[1:24:14] original heritage he can say I'm a son
[1:24:17] of Abraham I'm a son of David and the
[1:24:20] church same but a brand connected to the
[1:24:26] continuation of the generation of Jesus
[1:24:28] Christ listen when you read after cheek
[1:24:32] when we will get it I'm getting excited
[1:24:35] but God is so good and I love time to do
[1:24:40] full justice to this but if you want to
[1:24:43] touch on one name it's not a female
[1:24:45] because we are dominant females until we
[1:24:48] get back to Mary but after a brought to
[1:24:50] babylon jechonias begat salathiel that
[1:24:54] jeconiah you talking about there's a
[1:24:56] scripture says out of jacanas loins will
[1:25:00] never come at him
[1:25:11] out of jail or never coming so how does
[1:25:15] God reconcile at instructure because if
[1:25:18] out of Jeconiah strawberry cliff could
[1:25:21] be a king then people could clean joseph
[1:25:23] was really Jesus father but Joseph was
[1:25:27] Jesus legal father he was in his
[1:25:31] biological father but he was at the
[1:25:33] house of David which was the house that
[1:25:35] Jesus had to be born in can the church
[1:25:38] say Amen
[1:25:38] so God had to cut the roots somewhere
[1:25:40] and I love the legal authority to pass
[1:25:43] through can the church salmon so that
[1:25:50] nobody could come and suggest that's why
[1:25:52] when Jesus entered to say since tina's
[1:25:54] cook yes fulfill it is not this Joseph's
[1:25:57] son they trying to connect him
[1:26:00] biologically to choose it but there was
[1:26:04] no biological connection
[1:26:05] he was illegal Guardian that was the man
[1:26:10] to train jesus any any early thing they
[1:26:12] hire walk don't put your foot there
[1:26:14] somebody had to do it you know all I
[1:26:15] think he wanted to work on is a man that
[1:26:18] was Joseph can the church say Amen and
[1:26:23] then we come down to marry the fifth
[1:26:27] woman and fives a number of Greece we
[1:26:29] know it creates a lot Exodus woman he
[1:26:33] America was highly favored power mama
[1:26:37] woman from the beginning of time to now
[1:26:40] there's nobody like you because this was
[1:26:42] written before you were even here before
[1:26:44] your grandfather was here no your
[1:26:46] great-grandfather was here this was
[1:26:47] written
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:50] I've come to give you a message you're
[1:26:53] gonna have a chat
[1:26:54] this name would be wonderful is name
[1:26:56] will become Salah his name will be
[1:26:58] manual Adam has been waited for this
[1:27:00] child no one has been waiting for this
[1:27:02] chat Iran waited with this check can the
[1:27:07] church salmon and God like Allah see
[1:27:10] when you look at this passage of
[1:27:12] Scripture and I really want to encourage
[1:27:14] you with this he could have choose a
[1:27:16] nice and family innocent way but he
[1:27:18] still had Jesus born under mysterious
[1:27:21] circumstances because Joseph when he see
[1:27:24] this ad to say I see this I don't want
[1:27:26] to make a public example that would've
[1:27:28] ever said so I put away quietly Joseph
[1:27:30] we marry we cook it over something else
[1:27:36] he didn't want to make it a public story
[1:27:39] about what happened with Mary but he
[1:27:42] thought to come and comfort him tell em
[1:27:45] don't worry because one is in this woman
[1:27:48] it's up the Holy Ghost and that was
[1:27:51] comfort to Joseph but no doubt people
[1:27:54] have been talking because humanity to
[1:27:58] talk that's the only reason that Joseph
[1:28:00] would have been thinking about putting
[1:28:01] our way because I didn't want to be with
[1:28:03] he talk
[1:28:08] but God loves to take messed up stories
[1:28:11] and Mac and make beautiful stories out
[1:28:15] of it come the church see men but
[1:28:20] friends his story didn't stop there it
[1:28:24] is just that Matthew was only allowed to
[1:28:26] write up until this point but this book
[1:28:30] this book that we introduced before the
[1:28:33] scripture so if Matthew was allowed to
[1:28:40] write further than his age and he was
[1:28:42] all to see further than his time but
[1:28:45] George your name was vomit well Angie
[1:28:49] Johnny was gonna be there
[1:28:50] but Terry only was gonna be there but we
[1:28:53] only man you had to see him and he said
[1:28:57] had to see you but I hated to see you
[1:28:58] name anyone he's not a literal name but
[1:29:01] the mystery of who you are because he's
[1:29:04] talking about us the continuation of
[1:29:08] this book of this generation of the Lord
[1:29:10] Jesus Christ can the church say man Oh
[1:29:14] hallelujah hallelu could he take someone
[1:29:18] so that was the core fan should actually
[1:29:21] want to drop some course and then we
[1:29:22] could close out because I want to pull
[1:29:24] some stuff from what the prophets said
[1:29:26] if that's okay with you
[1:29:27] so this all of these friends is the
[1:29:30] great mystery of God that God could do
[1:29:33] things in such a way that the world can
[1:29:36] miss it sent a prophet in a way that the
[1:29:38] world overlooked it send preachers and
[1:29:41] messengers and churches because the
[1:29:43] attention is not on us it's on him it's
[1:29:46] really his story didn't say the book of
[1:29:49] the generation of Abraham or David it's
[1:29:51] of Jesus Christ where the branch said he
[1:29:54] is a central team of the Bible it was
[1:29:56] him in the Psalms it was him in all the
[1:29:58] books it is always been about Jesus and
[1:30:00] in this day and time he's looking to no
[1:30:02] close be in the closing pages of this
[1:30:05] book hallelujah and that is why John was
[1:30:09] weeping because it's only that book
[1:30:11] being restored gives us access to come
[1:30:13] back into our position like Adam had
[1:30:16] before and I'm lost it can the church Oh
[1:30:19] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:23] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:30:25] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:32] hallelujah hallelujah I just want to
[1:30:40] read from the prophet a few quotes gauze
[1:30:42] wrapped gift now you see he's on what
[1:30:45] rehab this Hallett was a Gentile and she
[1:30:48] was a ancient grandmother tall Lord
[1:30:52] Jesus that's a prophet with now for
[1:30:53] those of you wanna know where I get it
[1:30:54] from right also when PO s her grandson
[1:30:57] comfort and married ruth the moabite
[1:30:59] he also married a Gentile which made
[1:31:01] jesus also pat Gentiles at least speakin
[1:31:03] prophets worse now then when they
[1:31:06] brought their child for his name was
[1:31:07] open and open had a son and his name was
[1:31:09] Jesse and Jesse had a son whose name was
[1:31:11] David all this taking place in little
[1:31:14] Bethlehem what is it
[1:31:15] the lineage of the Lord Jesus his
[1:31:17] background at the great spiritual men
[1:31:20] were overlooking or the so-called
[1:31:21] spiritual men hallelujah
[1:31:24] see and prevent him now in the memories
[1:31:26] the message Revelation chapter 5 he said
[1:31:28] see lifted above the shadows out of the
[1:31:32] grind of 40's we have earnest now of our
[1:31:35] complete inheritance because Jesus had
[1:31:38] to come for us to access the inheritance
[1:31:40] without Jesus coming there was no
[1:31:42] inheritance so every person along this
[1:31:45] dist story he said it was fourteen
[1:31:48] generations and another fourteen
[1:31:49] generations and along this every time is
[1:31:52] a step closer or God seen inheritance
[1:31:55] once inheritance inheritance because
[1:31:59] only when Jesus came he said it's almost
[1:32:02] upon us now we can talk about
[1:32:03] inheritance now we can talk about power
[1:32:06] listen we have the earnest now of our
[1:32:08] complete inheritance because Gor has
[1:32:11] already pulled loose the ground roots
[1:32:14] from the things a bit
[1:32:15] and I supplanted us on higher groundz
[1:32:17] lifted me out transept me transform me
[1:32:21] from the things of the world took out
[1:32:23] roots branches everything and lifted me
[1:32:26] up out automatically out of the old muck
[1:32:29] of sin and planted me on top of Zions
[1:32:32] Hill setting in the orchard of the
[1:32:34] beloved scenes of God listen to the
[1:32:37] Prophet he is speaking present tense
[1:32:39] based on Revelation and now we are
[1:32:41] citizen to that Kingdom brothers and
[1:32:44] sisters in Christ Jesus all filled and
[1:32:46] calm and nastiness caught from our minds
[1:32:49] our water bodies are washed with pure
[1:32:51] water and our hearts are sprinkled by
[1:32:53] the blood of the Lord Jesus and the Holy
[1:32:56] Spirit is abiding with his breeze
[1:32:58] blowing through our branches all day
[1:33:01] long shoving us and pushing us and
[1:33:05] making us take good roots and agro
[1:33:08] County isn't that wonderful the earnest
[1:33:11] of our salvation and the church amen
[1:33:14] wait I'll go but Isaac I'm talking with
[1:33:16] the continuation of this generation of
[1:33:19] the Lord Jesus Christ in other words
[1:33:21] when Jesus left but a pop world and the
[1:33:23] devil hood it is finished he taught this
[1:33:26] whole thing finally closed
[1:33:28] he didn't next didn't know what to
[1:33:29] expect because what Jesus did next had
[1:33:32] never happened before before Jesus
[1:33:36] everybody else waited in the ground and
[1:33:37] stayed there
[1:33:38] Jesus went and bungs back out
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:43] and when Jesus bunks back out he said
[1:33:46] because I live you gonna live also when
[1:33:49] Jesus comes back out he ushered in a
[1:33:51] whole new dispensation
[1:33:56] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:00] hallelujah so this morning you could
[1:34:04] bounce back out because it's in you to
[1:34:06] bounce back out it's in you to rise up
[1:34:09] it's in you to shake things off and the
[1:34:12] church came in and he said if the same
[1:34:15] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:34:17] dwells in you that's what'll quicken
[1:34:20] this mortal body
[1:34:21] it'll make you shout it'll make you
[1:34:24] tense it'll make you sing it'll make you
[1:34:27] go to the rapture hallelujah when Iran
[1:34:38] said our lost inheritance our loss
[1:34:41] inheritance has been reclaimed by our
[1:34:43] gracious precious kinsman redeemer how
[1:34:46] God came down changed his cast from God
[1:34:51] and was made man
[1:34:52] he said God change the level he was at
[1:34:55] it changed to became man in order to be
[1:34:59] human to become a human kinsman redeemer
[1:35:02] the redeemed black and natural worlds
[1:35:04] and natural people how that God the
[1:35:07] supernatural became natural let me say
[1:35:11] that again how God the supernatural
[1:35:13] became natural
[1:35:17] and God is about to take natural and
[1:35:20] turn him into supernatural and the
[1:35:23] church demon how God the supernatural
[1:35:27] isn't a prophet became natural to become
[1:35:30] a kinsman because he could not defy his
[1:35:33] own laws he had to come by kinsman
[1:35:36] redeemer ship because that was his plan
[1:35:38] that's the way he did it God has an
[1:35:41] order and gotta break his order God as a
[1:35:44] process and he cannot break his process
[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:50] come to church hey man could we take
[1:35:53] some more everybody with me this morning
[1:35:55] could you take some more hallelujah we
[1:35:58] are walking in our story this morning we
[1:36:00] are walking our pathway this morning the
[1:36:03] steps of the righteous are ordered by
[1:36:04] God because a story is already written
[1:36:06] we are walking in the light this morning
[1:36:09] he is the light that's like we are
[1:36:11] walking in we are not going to go into
[1:36:13] darkness we're not going to go into
[1:36:15] men's ideas our feelings our emotions
[1:36:17] our past but we're going forward all the
[1:36:20] way to the rapture all the way to the
[1:36:22] resurrection and underway to the rapture
[1:36:25] we pick up our family on the way to the
[1:36:28] resurrection we pick up our healing on
[1:36:30] the journey we will pick it up if you
[1:36:36] lost your toe we pick that up too you
[1:36:38] lost your piece we pay that up too
[1:36:40] you lost the revival we pick that up too
[1:36:43] everything is in our inheritance and
[1:36:45] Jesus tried to give us access access to
[1:36:49] the inheritance
[1:36:50] it's our inheritance it's alway
[1:36:52] inheritance it's access we are looking
[1:36:55] for and this morning as sons and
[1:36:57] daughters of the Living God we have
[1:36:59] access we are of the generation of
[1:37:02] Abraham we are of the generation of
[1:37:05] David we are royal sheets that's why we
[1:37:08] could be called kings and priests
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:20] hallelujah hallelujah everybody should
[1:37:25] be something nothing to be weighing you
[1:37:27] down
[1:37:28] hallelujah nothing should be weighing
[1:37:30] you down your past cannot weigh you down
[1:37:32] your sin can and wear you down your
[1:37:35] sickness cannot weigh you down because
[1:37:37] sickness is a product of sin if there
[1:37:39] was no sin there'd be no sickness if
[1:37:41] there's no sin there be no doubt if
[1:37:43] there was no sin there be no fear if
[1:37:45] there was no sin it'd be no depression
[1:37:47] if there was no sin it be no frustration
[1:37:49] it because I've seen unbelief that these
[1:37:52] are byproducts byproducts of sin
[1:37:55] byproducts of unbelief but when Jesus
[1:37:58] came he broke the power of sin forever
[1:38:01] not temporarily he destroyed the whole
[1:38:04] that simcha never however on the blood
[1:38:07] wash once up so when we come into his
[1:38:09] presence and there's blood being
[1:38:11] creature weak to the watering of the
[1:38:13] word and you say Lord I am here Here I
[1:38:16] am send me when God looks at you he does
[1:38:19] even see what you did yesterday he
[1:38:21] doesn't see your mistakes it's just
[1:38:23] blood and that blood still has a bump
[1:38:26] off giving you access given you access
[1:38:29] put the plank up in the sky Oh
[1:38:34] hallelujah hallelujah giving you access
[1:38:38] to the bank up in the sky
[1:38:45] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah

[1:39:02] her don't worry we have food after
[1:39:03] service so we could we could cruise a
[1:39:05] little bit this morning we got going to
[1:39:07] cruise control God knowing that man
[1:39:10] would fall it was no surprise to him

[1:39:15] is that of course what Pope will do of
[1:39:18] course what George - oh god yes nothing
[1:39:21] to surprise God God knowing that man
[1:39:25] would fall God knowing that man would be
[1:39:30] lost though he did not want anybody lost
[1:39:33] but to order the greatest name of the
[1:39:36] attributes of God in order for it to be
[1:39:39] displayed had to be manifested that he
[1:39:42] could be a redeemer he could be a senior
[1:39:44] man had to fall how do you got me or not
[1:39:51] you didn't have a choice
[1:39:53] good hard to let you fall he didn't make
[1:39:56] you do it but you watch you do it
[1:39:58] because he wanted to be your oedema you
[1:40:01] wanted to be your Savior
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:07] now you see why I'm so happy now you see
[1:40:11] why I'm so glad it has been written
[1:40:17] about me

[1:40:54] fiery furnace doors angels they don't
[1:40:57] have the knowledge of God he don't have

[1:42:04] they're cut in there there was a fourth
[1:42:06] man in the fire he was with the call
[1:42:08] himself a man but it wasn't man he was

[1:42:57] it is jesus the son of Abraham the son
[1:43:00] of David the son of David is a royal and
[1:43:03] the son of Abraham is the covenanted
[1:43:05] line but this gentile dispensation is
[1:43:10] royalty or you don't hear me this
[1:43:13] morning because when the viewers read
[1:43:15] from top to bottom it was a lower divine

[1:44:28] but you know you can miss the first 20%
[1:44:31] and get to figure out who the bad man is
[1:44:33] and who he could manage but you want to
[1:44:36] mix it with a really led story you see
[1:44:38] the bad man on the ground and he

[1:47:10] thinking about everything we were there
[1:47:14] we were there that's why we can say we
[1:47:17] come from God and we go back to God

[1:47:34] about ninja this is not about a manger
[1:47:37] this is not about no no that's wonderful
[1:47:39] but this Jesus he was not a baby all the
[1:47:42] time as a baby they tried to get him but
[1:47:45] as you get older and I get more mature
[1:47:47] he becomes a common to his own and by
[1:47:49] the time he reaches ministry the devil
[1:47:51] had not seen anything like it and we
[1:47:56] have started off as babies not knowing
[1:47:59] much googoogaga
[1:48:01] but poor see how long will you drink

[1:48:26] to handle it
[1:48:28] let the problems come you can handle it
[1:48:31] we can handle it that's what we've been
[1:48:35] built for what we've been born for what
[1:48:38] we've been designed for what we've been
[1:48:40] constructed for what we can handle David
[1:48:45] couldn't handle what we could do Elisha
[1:48:48] could not do this is the hour for the
[1:48:51] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:48:58] [Applause]
[1:48:59] you may be seated halleluja halleluja
[1:49:08] the continuation of the book of the
[1:49:14] generation of Jesus Christ you may be
[1:49:15] seated
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:23] [Applause]
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:39] can you take someone
[1:49:47] if you played a game of chess there are
[1:49:51] different pieces that have different
[1:49:54] purposes
[1:49:58] the pawns
[1:50:00] our soldiers
[1:50:03] you can't be foolish as a chess player
[1:50:05] and say I don't want points because I
[1:50:08] have a bishop and I have a castle the
[1:50:12] castle and Bishop more powerful and
[1:50:14] pawns are don't need a porn because I
[1:50:15] have the bishop if you don't use your
[1:50:18] pawns effectively you will never survive
[1:50:21] to be able to engage a bishop or in the
[1:50:25] a castle but anybody knows who the most
[1:50:28] powerful piece on the borders the most
[1:50:33] powerful piece on the border any chess
[1:50:35] player knows
[1:50:37] the queen but the authority of the Queen
[1:50:40] really comes from the king because if
[1:50:44] there is no king the queen has nothing
[1:50:46] we queen of
[1:50:51] I'm a queen I'm a queen I'm at the
[1:50:52] oakwoods sticker selfie hashtag queen
[1:50:57] but because the king is on the board
[1:51:00] because if the King Falls everybody
[1:51:01] including the Queen finish DM done but
[1:51:06] the power to move without hesitation
[1:51:10] from end to end in any kind of way is
[1:51:13] the Queen everybody with me so in this
[1:51:18] great strategy because Cora's our
[1:51:20] strategist
[1:51:23] if you remember Ten Commandments when
[1:51:26] Rama seesaw it openly Red Sea and then
[1:51:29] you say their gore is a poor general he
[1:51:32] leaves them no retreat
[1:51:34] it looked like he had I'm listing all
[1:51:37] good because Rama season understand the
[1:51:40] power of this guy so core is a
[1:51:42] strategist but it's only in this age he
[1:51:47] looked at TV a special kind of ministry
[1:51:51] called Bryan wife queen these are so
[1:52:01] many things that could call her because
[1:52:04] when Jesus was he was leaving part of a
[1:52:06] ministry for her to finish not that he
[1:52:12] can't do it but he put enough power in
[1:52:13] her to finish what he started knowing
[1:52:17] that he - I won and when she speaks it's
[1:52:20] born of my born flesh of my flesh spirit
[1:52:24] of my spirit
[1:52:36] and it's dropping Wilkie's so you know
[1:52:38] so any devil come I said I tap you up
[1:52:40] and then you see you know who I am
[1:52:43] because this age I said if I hold
[1:52:45] ministry is is a purpose focused
[1:52:49] ministry until we all come when that
[1:52:53] until until means of the time element
[1:52:55] until kind of eternal check it in
[1:52:58] English any language dictionary
[1:53:05] so the fibermesh is temporary but it's
[1:53:07] brighting is eternalism and this
[1:53:13] covenant because we're a man said you
[1:53:15] ring of predestination the ngage
[1:53:18] recalling engagement ring was put on
[1:53:21] before the phone is anywhere so you
[1:53:24] walking around brother Alexis with an
[1:53:27] engagement ring of corporate destination
[1:53:29] which means you are guaranteed access to
[1:53:33] not just walk up the aisle you buy
[1:53:35] another bridesmaid you walk enough as
[1:53:36] bride walking up anybody with me this
[1:53:42] morning I'm gonna try to wrap up
[1:53:45] somewhere part time with him block any
[1:53:47] time when I ready
[1:53:55] hallelujah so let me try to find a place
[1:53:58] to toast everybody feeling fine you know
[1:54:01] but a man said when the bride gets to
[1:54:03] know who she is
[1:54:04] then the rapture will go you know it's
[1:54:06] just waiting for us one day your mind
[1:54:08] just open up know because listen I don't
[1:54:12] know how it is for you why just given
[1:54:13] you my testimony but my ex but when I
[1:54:16] read much you want I see a pot Lord I
[1:54:18] have a chance because the enemy would
[1:54:21] make it think you can make it to the
[1:54:22] Royal Gorge every time the enemy can
[1:54:25] tell it you give up you know make it you
[1:54:27] make this mistake this is going wrong
[1:54:29] I see but if God could use tear my I go
[1:54:31] to use root and quarter usually have a
[1:54:34] quarter music
[1:54:41] and quad or change so when Corps decide
[1:54:44] to find a messenger for the Gentiles he
[1:54:47] went on look who I could find boy
[1:54:49] I'm and Jessica Stephen yes daddy one
[1:54:56] because I'm looking to confuse the devil
[1:54:59] God is not the author of confusion but
[1:55:01] he like to confuse the devil he liked to
[1:55:09] use unexpected people in unexpected ways
[1:55:12] to an unexpected end can the church
[1:55:15] demon so here comes brother Paul who was
[1:55:22] once all you know very very very wet
[1:55:24] Bible and brothers had a fight with
[1:55:25] Wiley he come into it a normal long when
[1:55:29] I greet your brother I take my brother's
[1:55:30] greeting but was no heartbeat no no it
[1:55:32] wasn't like really from the heart it was
[1:55:35] really struggling because they were
[1:55:37] still remembering Steven precious
[1:55:40] deacons even and listen Polly is only
[1:55:43] when you go through that together you
[1:55:44] you can assign a negotiation or they
[1:55:49] know what's think we should do creature
[1:55:50] how signatures help out and this brother
[1:55:54] here who wasn't even with Jesus you call
[1:55:57] a home with him and Peter he withstood
[1:56:01] Peter to his face
[1:56:04] who is you
[1:56:08] and that's how easy it is to see that's
[1:56:11] and this was a lovely serenity of God
[1:56:13] where I can't judge anybody it's not in
[1:56:17] our ability to judge because God could
[1:56:20] choose to appoint who he wants to
[1:56:21] appoint and by the time we read Peters
[1:56:26] last script which you read couple sirs
[1:56:29] ago he said as was spoken of brother
[1:56:31] Paul beloved brother
[1:56:34] to make them know listen don't get it
[1:56:36] twisted we have no beef between us but
[1:56:40] the revelation has been given to my
[1:56:41] brother Paul who has said things that
[1:56:43] are hard to understand even me
[1:56:45] struggling to understand because they
[1:56:48] couldn't see eye to eye with any
[1:56:49] revelation was given to Paul for the
[1:56:51] gentle disposition was not given to
[1:56:53] Peter keys are given to Pizza Hut pizza
[1:56:56] readily understand it so don't get upset
[1:57:00] with me by the measure of my revelation
[1:57:07] God choose a review to whomever you will
[1:57:10] more about him and that's why when this
[1:57:12] prophet Malachi fought him
[1:57:14] as when a Terran said some time ago
[1:57:16] people were administering a platform
[1:57:18] thinking this was just another brother
[1:57:19] sharing would but the measure of
[1:57:22] Revelation doesn't give in to this
[1:57:24] Elisha prophet was way beyond their pay
[1:57:26] grade and he was so low pay they
[1:57:30] couldn't even understand what was being
[1:57:31] ministered to them on that category of
[1:57:34] wood but that's how God loves a man who
[1:57:41] didn't go to geology go school because I
[1:57:42] was eating led yeah to a Bible School
[1:57:45] you have to what minute she grew up
[1:57:46] under and go and raise up a prophet
[1:57:52] could barely speak no great education
[1:57:56] and choose that profit to be part of the
[1:57:59] story of the continuation of the book of
[1:58:02] the generation of Jesus Christ in so
[1:58:07] much that the Son of Man was filled in
[1:58:10] is the show that the generation was
[1:58:14] still continuing and he was still
[1:58:16] calling more sons because that book of
[1:58:18] the generation described by the populace
[1:58:20] really this book of redemption it's a
[1:58:23] book of names of them that is what was
[1:58:26] being fought for it was a book of names
[1:58:27] and The Associated inheritance that was
[1:58:31] tied to these names but if Adam called
[1:58:34] it book many things the book of
[1:58:35] inheritance the book of redemption a
[1:58:37] book a name is the same book it's the
[1:58:40] individuals in the book and the
[1:58:42] blessings that are so see where these
[1:58:43] individuals and Adam was supposed to
[1:58:46] call these names and they were supposed
[1:58:48] to have the same thing they seemed to
[1:58:50] mingle and Adam had can the church say
[1:58:52] Amen
[1:58:52] oh let me try to find a way to close out
[1:58:56] my time is up oh I live in our Peter
[1:59:00] each
[1:59:03] let us skip to my mother I said good sub
[1:59:09] to redeem what not notice it was a lamb
[1:59:12] ratima a lamb redeemer just like the
[1:59:13] face God can never change
[1:59:15] the first Redeemer was a lamb in the
[1:59:18] garden he was a lamb Bakura fan here it
[1:59:19] was again plumber open revelation it's
[1:59:21] again a lamb to redeem what the Fallen
[1:59:23] condition and the fallen inheritance of
[1:59:25] a fallen race of people a lamb comes
[1:59:28] back to a team like ours was at the
[1:59:30] beginning to redeem us to redeem what
[1:59:31] he's going to redeem anything that his
[1:59:33] team is going back someone has been lost
[1:59:35] if someone has been lost and then it's
[1:59:37] been brought back again what did we have
[1:59:39] at the beginning eternal life
[1:59:40] we was heirs of the world we had life we
[1:59:44] never had to die we never had to be sick
[1:59:46] we never had to get old we never had any
[1:59:49] worries where there's no funeral no
[1:59:51] graves no evil no death no great years
[1:59:54] no stoop shoulders no mourning no crime
[1:59:57] we had life eternal we have the
[1:59:59] jurisdiction over all the earth we was
[2:00:01] just a god lower case that's all on the
[2:00:04] earth walk about the neighbor tree
[2:00:05] doesn't look right standing there we see
[2:00:08] a beat-up lot and set over there and it
[2:00:10] will do it the wind was blowing we
[2:00:12] didn't wonder will seblak peace be still
[2:00:14] and it did it what did he come to do to
[2:00:18] redeem all that back to us again get all
[2:00:21] that back and now Nietzsche in itself is
[2:00:26] groaning waiting for what manifestation
[2:00:29] of the sons of God for the sons of God
[2:00:32] to be made manifest can the church say
[2:00:36] many musician to get ready hallelujah
[2:00:45] and we have the earnest of our salvation
[2:00:48] now I can take our product at time with
[2:00:53] cancer and stand with a little breath of
[2:00:55] redemption and pray the prayer of feet
[2:00:58] over him and then return a shadow of a
[2:00:59] man back to healthy man again what will
[2:01:02] we do in our full possession comes so by
[2:01:04] the mantle when our full possession
[2:01:05] comes right then we have a little tongue
[2:01:07] payment but there's a full possession
[2:01:09] that is to come
[2:01:10] nature knows that nature's groaning and
[2:01:12] we are groaning with it nate is waiting
[2:01:15] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:01:18] because Nietzsche was cursed with its
[2:01:20] master when its master was cursed there
[2:01:24] Nietzsche fell with the master talking
[2:01:26] about Adam because Adam was master
[2:01:29] beauty but animals banished out of Eden
[2:01:31] power strip from him but when this
[2:01:34] kinsman redeemer come and redeemed back
[2:01:36] to man that's the master over nature
[2:01:39] then all nature is waiting for the man
[2:01:42] master and the church seaman Oh
[2:01:49] hallelujah all Nietzsche is waiting for
[2:01:53] its master and the masses asunder the
[2:01:55] earth that was given this now God will
[2:01:58] have his heavens of course but this was
[2:02:00] given to man and the kinsman redeemer
[2:02:02] come to redeem us back to that we lost
[2:02:04] so I want to say all the way he's seen
[2:02:06] as well as I said because Oh a story
[2:02:08] from Adam and through Abraham to David
[2:02:11] it's not just a be that we existed it's
[2:02:14] a take Blackwood Adam lost so the
[2:02:16] continuation of this book will end with
[2:02:19] being black where Adam was the
[2:02:21] continuation of book will be us and then
[2:02:24] back in photomania
[2:02:25] like John would scribble we shall reign
[2:02:27] on the earth hallelujah are you looking
[2:02:30] for that day are you on the expectation
[2:02:33] for that day
[2:02:33] listen to the prophets say it when the
[2:02:36] work is finished
[2:02:38] somebody said when the work is finished
[2:02:41] listen to the Prophet we will have all
[2:02:44] things again whatever I said what kind
[2:02:46] of things we will have all power we have
[2:02:50] eternal life we have eternal health we
[2:02:53] have eternal youth
[2:02:55] we have eternal power we are just
[2:02:57] eternal with the eternal and then we are
[2:03:01] all waiting for that time to come so
[2:03:03] that's what we're waiting on eternal
[2:03:05] power eternal life eternal health
[2:03:08] eternal youth and Balaban said this
