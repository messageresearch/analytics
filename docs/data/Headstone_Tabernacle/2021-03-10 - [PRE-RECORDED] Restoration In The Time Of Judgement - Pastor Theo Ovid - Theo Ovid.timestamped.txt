[15:02] [Music]
[15:08] let's worship the lord well those of you
[15:10] who was near old last night happy new
[15:12] year
[15:13] and may the blessings of god uh be upon
[15:16] you for this coming year
[15:17] that god would shine his light upon you
[15:21] in a life of service and if you're in
[15:23] prison that god would bring you out of
[15:26] your prison
[15:27] because there are people that are in
[15:28] prison and they need to come out
[15:31] of the prison some people in the prison
[15:32] of selfishness
[15:34] the prison of lust in the prison of
[15:36] anger and temper
[15:38] in the prison of hate and the prison of
[15:39] jealousy in the prison
[15:41] of holland grudges and the prisoner of
[15:43] holy north
[15:44] real prisons these are like spiritual
[15:47] prisons
[15:48] and you have to have a desire to get out
[15:50] of it
[15:52] and uh you know i was sharing something
[15:55] with some brothers about
[15:56] something i like to say it like a
[15:58] default position
[16:01] each one of us have like a default the
[16:02] default in which
[16:04] the environment family environment what
[16:06] you grow up
[16:07] how you grow up uh what you learn
[16:09] educational level whatever
[16:11] but there's a default position in which
[16:13] you react to things
[16:15] and do things and act in a way that that
[16:17] is what you know
[16:19] that is what you call the default
[16:21] position so anything happen
[16:23] you fall back to that level of what you
[16:25] are custom with
[16:27] we don't like new things we don't like
[16:29] strange things
[16:31] we don't like things that shake us off
[16:33] of our
[16:34] comfort zone but sometimes god arranged
[16:38] those things it's amazing that god don't
[16:40] ever tell people stay where you are i'm
[16:42] going to come to you
[16:43] he just tell abraham get out get out
[16:46] from among your people
[16:48] get out from your country onto a land i
[16:51] will show you
[16:52] i'll not even show you right now i will
[16:53] show you just take a move
[16:56] get out so what god challenges us is to
[16:59] get out of our default
[17:00] zone get out of our comfort zone
[17:03] you don't ever raise your hands and you
[17:05] get out of that by raising your hands
[17:07] you don't ever shout you get out of that
[17:09] by shouting you're selfish you get out
[17:11] of that by giving by sharing
[17:13] you're extending yourself there's some
[17:15] people who see for themselves
[17:17] and their family their own circle they
[17:19] cannot effectively
[17:20] serve but for god so loved the world
[17:23] that he gave his only begotten son
[17:26] and jesus came serving whosoever want to
[17:29] hear him
[17:29] whosoever want to receive him whoever
[17:32] want to get a breakthrough
[17:34] he went about doing good and to serve
[17:36] and there was one man he was full of
[17:38] demons full of devils
[17:40] isn't that right he was legion had a
[17:42] thousand devils and he cried out
[17:44] hallelujah forgot to deliver him he was
[17:47] still an
[17:48] individual having a choice he born by
[17:51] demon powers still had the voice to cry
[17:54] for a breakthrough there is no excuse
[17:57] for you not having a desire for a
[18:00] breakthrough there is no excuse
[18:02] for you having not having a desire to
[18:03] break past your limitations
[18:06] your situations your past your
[18:08] psychological issues
[18:09] there is no reason for that because that
[18:11] man had a thousand demons
[18:13] wasn't six wasn't ten a whole thousand
[18:16] and he
[18:17] cried and he cared to call upon the lord
[18:20] and when he cried jesus heard his cry
[18:23] and jesus came and delivered him
[18:25] those demons had him naked those demons
[18:28] had him stripped
[18:29] and when he was delivered he went and
[18:31] get some clothes
[18:33] praise the name of the lord so i don't
[18:35] care what your condition is this evening
[18:37] i don't care what your condition is this
[18:39] morning god is able
[18:40] to deliver you from your default
[18:42] condition
[18:44] environment and situation what your mama
[18:47] tell you
[18:48] what your grandmother tell you what your
[18:50] grandpa tell you what your environment
[18:52] allowed for you you could break out of
[18:55] that you
[18:56] need to break out of that you need to
[18:59] get out of that
[19:00] god will drop some bombs to rock you out
[19:04] of that
[19:05] oh hallelujah could somebody say amen
[19:08] amen that's why the bible said let the
[19:11] week say
[19:12] i am strong because the weak default
[19:14] position is i am weak
[19:16] and i am struggling and i can't make it
[19:18] but god like to jam the issue
[19:21] and shake you and rock you from that
[19:24] default position
[19:25] to say let the weak say i am strong
[19:29] harley let the poor say i am rich
[19:33] and let the sick say i am healed
[19:36] give the lord a shout to pray
[19:43] oh glory glory glory and glory the bible
[19:47] talk about the desert blossoming like a
[19:48] wilderness
[19:49] the bible talk about in the desert
[19:51] springs will come forward
[19:53] god like to challenge the situation he
[19:55] like to question
[19:56] baroness and say rejoice don't parent
[19:59] you're going to produce more than the
[20:01] woman
[20:01] with child god loves to do that
[20:05] oh hallelujah who gonna help me preach
[20:07] this morning
[20:11] oh hallelujah bible talk about the baron
[20:15] brick fought into singing
[20:20] a baron can't sing baron is grieving for
[20:24] child grieving for breakthrough grieving
[20:27] and the church is barren and not even
[20:28] grieving
[20:30] [Music]
[20:32] all these virtues the early church had
[20:35] we have more books than they had
[20:37] we have more preachers than they had we
[20:40] have more tapes more mystery more
[20:42] knowledge than they had
[20:43] it seems that our hearts have been
[20:45] turned back to the books
[20:46] that the fathers did not have but that's
[20:50] not the promise
[20:52] turn the hearts of the trend back to
[20:53] reading no
[20:56] back to the faith that was once
[20:59] delivered to the saints
[21:01] let me tell you something church that's
[21:03] backslide
[21:06] i'm not hearing you this morning
[21:07] [Applause]
[21:09] amen preaches this backslide elder says
[21:13] backslide
[21:14] people as backfired but god have a way
[21:17] of bringing them back
[21:23] not because somebody is in church
[21:25] everything is all right
[21:27] no sometimes the devil calls in havoc
[21:31] sometimes they walk into what the devil
[21:33] have created and the devil not moving
[21:35] because sin is there
[21:36] unbelief is there principle's brokenness
[21:39] there and god can't even touch it
[21:46] [Music]
[21:47] this year is going to be a different
[21:49] year
[21:49] [Applause]
[21:52] this year you're going to get a
[21:54] breakthrough
[21:57] this year you're going to get a
[21:58] breakthrough yeah yeah this year
[22:01] it's also going to be judgment if you're
[22:02] going to get a breakthrough judgment is
[22:04] also going to strike
[22:06] because you're going to get the picture
[22:07] in the midst of judgment oh hallelujah
[22:10] we're not looking for
[22:10] blessings no no no god said behold i
[22:14] send you elijah before what before that
[22:17] great
[22:18] and terrible day of the lord that's
[22:20] what's coming
[22:22] a terrible day is coming a day of
[22:24] blackness and gloom it is a terrible day
[22:26] is coming
[22:26] for the entire world a terrible day is
[22:29] coming if you think think tough now
[22:31] a terrible day is coming it's gonna get
[22:33] worse
[22:35] worse worse so stop complaining
[22:42] my god they're gonna get worse so you
[22:45] are one in a million
[22:47] that's why you should shout that's why
[22:49] you should rejoice
[22:50] that's why you should honor god listen
[22:55] with your whole heart
[23:00] you won't be seated
[23:01] [Applause]
[23:03] money is a corrupter you know the bible
[23:06] said the love
[23:07] of money not moneyness but the love of
[23:09] it some people just
[23:10] love it they say more money
[23:15] they just love it the love of it is the
[23:17] root
[23:19] of all evil because they keep grabbing
[23:21] at it
[23:22] they're lusting for it they're pushing
[23:24] for it depressing for it to get
[23:26] things and jesus said a man life does
[23:29] not consist
[23:31] of the amount of things that he
[23:33] possesses there are people have more
[23:34] cars that they could drive
[23:36] but they have the things like toys
[23:40] natural things that going to fade away
[23:44] and you come to church hearing a message
[23:47] that god has sent
[23:49] to prepare a people for the coming of
[23:53] the lord
[23:55] but jesus said they're going to say the
[23:57] lord
[23:58] delay his coming and if the lord delays
[24:03] we may as well do our own thing
[24:06] but there is going to be a brand that
[24:09] going to testify
[24:11] that the lord himself has
[24:14] descended with a shout out
[24:18] to get us out
[24:23] oh can we give the lord some worship
[24:26] we're gonna read the scripture just now
[24:32] there are some ministers going to preach
[24:33] till they die
[24:36] they're not preaching for the rapture
[24:38] they're not preaching for the second of
[24:39] the lord they're preaching because
[24:41] the whole service is around them they
[24:44] will preach till they're dead
[24:47] they have no beating for the people
[24:50] they have no burden for revile because
[24:54] revival comes with a burden
[24:55] another question i want to ask you this
[24:57] morning god promised a revival
[25:00] what are we willing to do to get it amen
[25:06] god promised a revival
[25:09] god promised a revival what are you
[25:13] willing to do to get it or are you just
[25:16] gonna come to church
[25:18] and go back home and think that is all
[25:20] right i said big fat no
[25:22] that is not all right if god promised
[25:25] something there's gonna be somebody
[25:27] that's not going to only speak it or
[25:30] claim it
[25:31] but they're going to walk in the light
[25:33] of it there's going to be a people
[25:36] that he's called for his namesake
[25:40] oh glory to god my god i feel inspired
[25:44] now
[25:45] you may be seated one time god told
[25:48] israel
[25:48] is not because of you i am doing what i
[25:52] am doing
[25:52] i am doing to you for my name's sake
[25:56] that my name not be defiled among the
[26:00] gentiles
[26:01] god does do things for his order god is
[26:04] doing things for his glory
[26:06] god does do things for his name's sake
[26:10] oh hallelujah not for you
[26:14] but for his glory not for you
[26:17] but for his honor he deserves the honor
[26:21] he deserves the glory
[26:28] there's going to be healings
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:35] i shouldn't tell you to say email on
[26:37] that you should be so convinced
[26:40] i'm not talking about this pentecostal
[26:43] fraud
[26:44] i'm not talking about that i'm talking
[26:46] about the dynamic power
[26:49] coming into the sons of god listen
[26:52] to unveil god
[26:55] [Applause]
[26:58] you might be seated no no no i'm not
[27:01] talking about a man studying last night
[27:04] coming to preach a good message
[27:07] i'm not talking about that i'm talking
[27:10] when god
[27:11] pulled fire step into human skill
[27:14] set into 16 elements and god
[27:17] put on your shoes and god take the
[27:20] scriptures
[27:21] break the word and god come along and
[27:24] confirm the word
[27:26] that's what we are talking about a
[27:29] living god
[27:30] not a paper god a living god of god
[27:34] that discerns the god that could call
[27:36] out sin
[27:37] the god that rebukes the god that
[27:40] corrects
[27:41] the god that instructs the god that
[27:45] bring down the intelligence
[27:47] for your family's condition for your
[27:50] house for you to know what to do
[27:53] or give the lord
[28:02] maybe see that god that brings the probe
[28:06] of the spirit
[28:08] who the word that not only preaches
[28:12] but the zone and the core between the
[28:14] bone and the marrow and they send the
[28:16] thoughts and intents of the heart
[28:18] to god that go behind and could say why
[28:21] have you lied
[28:22] to the holy ghost that's the god we
[28:24] talking about
[28:25] that's not paper gospel that's the peter
[28:28] getting the taught last night
[28:30] that is god looking into peter's eyes
[28:34] and seen into the souls of those in the
[28:37] church
[28:37] that is the pure fire promised to be in
[28:40] the sons of
[28:41] god in the last days could we give god
[28:44] some praises
[28:50] i'm not talking about some preacher
[28:52] going to bible school
[28:54] i'm not talking about education and
[28:57] intellectual
[28:58] stuff because they had that in the old
[29:00] testament
[29:01] they had that with israel you may be
[29:03] seated
[29:04] the story we know with david angola and
[29:07] we know the story
[29:09] intellectuals was governed in a church
[29:11] at that time
[29:12] intellectuals with natural sword because
[29:14] them days is natural sword
[29:16] but you're afraid with your soul trained
[29:18] men they're afraid
[29:20] nobody want to go out glad and pinned
[29:22] down and they will come
[29:23] untrained untrained no school no
[29:26] training
[29:27] no left right left right left right turn
[29:29] right to the left polish your boots
[29:31] none of that none of that but he knew
[29:34] god
[29:35] [Applause]
[29:38] you don't have to know the mechanics
[29:42] come on now come on now who who's with
[29:44] me this morning
[29:45] who's with me this morning you don't
[29:48] have to know
[29:49] all the mechanics that you got to know
[29:52] when you put putting the key that engine
[29:54] tumbles
[29:59] maybe
[30:03] how minister talk heard about keaton and
[30:05] keaton
[30:17] and the reason the door is locked
[30:19] because that treasure is behind it if
[30:22] you have nothing behind it it'll make
[30:23] sense to lock in the door with nothing
[30:24] there
[30:25] but if you have stuff i mean you have
[30:27] virtual knowledge
[30:28] and you have temperatures and patience
[30:30] and your signs and wonders
[30:31] and you have miracles and powers and
[30:34] blessings
[30:34] you have it all locked up then faked
[30:37] it's the key

[30:47] you don't lock up nothing
[30:51] where are behind there boy
[30:55] i want to tell you let us see he hope we
[30:57] know there's nothing there
[30:58] should we look in that four man does
[31:01] lock up treasures

[31:05] have stuff behind there
[31:06] but god put stuff in the wood behind
[31:08] there that no scallywag
[31:10] can't just come and take the stuff
[31:15] because god does prove his word bye
[31:19] believers you believers give yourself a
[31:22] shout
[31:25] how many believers in the camp
[31:34] so god when god want to prove something
[31:37] he ain't committed to unbelievers listen
[31:39] to what he said if my people
[31:42] that i call by my name shall pray
[31:45] no shall humble themselves not pray yet
[31:48] you can't pray until you get humble you
[31:51] cannot pray
[31:52] until you could break down yourself and
[31:55] the only thing
[31:56] that hinders you from humbling yourself
[31:59] is your
[32:00] pride oh can somebody say amen
[32:04] this is pastor over in the house this
[32:06] morning
[32:08] don't even think about the service
[32:14] when you're wrong you're wrong
[32:19] the only thing that would hinder you
[32:22] from humbling yourself
[32:24] in your home as a husband and your home
[32:27] as a wife and your home as a child
[32:31] is your pride hallelujah
[32:35] but god is so great he has the ability
[32:38] to
[32:39] humble himself and that's what we must
[32:42] begin to do
[32:44] humble yourself under the mighty hand
[32:48] of the living god humble your pride
[32:51] humble
[32:51] you god can't do that for you he could
[32:54] floor you he could humiliate
[32:56] you he could strip you and many of us
[32:58] need to be stripped
[32:59] because we get puffed up and when they
[33:01] get puffed up you get arrogant
[33:03] and you dress and you shoot some money
[33:05] in the bank and nobody can talk to you
[33:08] but the bible said he come to the humble
[33:10] he come to the mick
[33:12] he come to those people humble yourself
[33:15] under the mighty hand of god
[33:17] and he going to exalt you in due time

[33:37] sign the wonders and guess what
[33:39] many of them were not impressed
[33:42] that was a stunning statement they were
[33:44] jealous envious they want to stop him
[33:47] in other words if you think sign i want
[33:49] to say we love the lord
[33:50] we're going to save god no money passed
[33:53] and still how we could
[33:56] or we could kill him or we could get him

[35:49] john was so dynamic john was so
[35:52] inspirational
[35:54] john was so anointed that they thought
[35:56] he was the one
[35:57] john said who me no you have seen
[36:00] nothing yet
[36:02] the one i come to introduce i'm not even
[36:04] worthy
[36:05] to unloose the jews he is bringing fire

[36:12] that's dynamics brother no man could
[36:15] bring that
[36:16] oh god i have to send that god i have to
[36:19] release
[36:20] that
[36:20] [Applause]
[36:25] so john set them up and they're looking

[36:34] the lamb of god
[36:43] just walking swiftly humbly hallelujah
[36:46] full of the holy ghost nobody see the
[36:48] drama behind the scenes
[36:49] he's moving into wilderness no escorts
[36:53] no blue lights no motorbike in front of
[36:55] him
[36:56] no elders and whole entourage
[37:00] so wrong then jesus led by
[37:03] the spirit into the wilderness to slap
[37:06] up the devil to let him know i am here
[37:08] now
[37:12] when jesus put some slap on his face he
[37:14] said i go taking a break
[37:16] and jesus went into the temple went into
[37:19] the scriptures
[37:20] i began to release power by the word
[37:24] the spirit is now upon me you can't see
[37:26] it you can't feel it yet but i'm
[37:28] speaking it
[37:29] i am prophesying it the spirit is upon
[37:31] me because he has anointed me to bring
[37:33] good titans
[37:34] not bad news good guidance to set the
[37:36] captive free to bring out the prison
[37:37] doors that are bound
[37:38] and to heal the sick he's prophesying
[37:41] he's talking about a ministry coming
[37:43] he's talking about what is about to
[37:44] happen nobody in here yet nobody
[37:46] delivered yet but he has taken the word
[37:48] and he is presenting it because you know
[37:50] the word is the conductor of the spirit
[37:52] and when you get the word line up the
[37:54] spirit have to follow
[37:56] the spirit have to follow what is lined
[37:59] up by the word
[38:05] [Applause]
[38:06] then jesus made a shocking statement
[38:09] this day this scripture is not present
[38:12] tense
[38:14] this scripture is alive the scripture is
[38:16] vindicated
[38:18] and they were shocked you see if you
[38:20] read it
[38:21] and just leave it dear then it's just
[38:23] another reading
[38:24] you know the catholic readers come and
[38:26] read the scripture
[38:28] right they thought he was just doing
[38:29] that but then he made something more
[38:30] than that he said this scripture you
[38:32] hear
[38:33] right now today present tense
[38:36] i am that fulfillment you are hearing
[38:40] you are seeing you are witnessing
[38:43] and that is where the drama start
[38:46] [Applause]
[38:51] could you imagine reading quotes for
[38:53] years all of a sudden
[38:55] season 10 and when you sit this day the
[38:58] scripture is fulfilled and then they say
[39:00] it's
[39:00] it's not that jesus that's not the man
[39:02] we know carpenter man
[39:05] joseph's son is that this same man we
[39:07] know
[39:08] we took out drive with him he gave us a
[39:10] drop in his car
[39:11] is that the same man then they threw him
[39:14] out
[39:15] and he became the rejected the rejected
[39:18] son of joseph the rejected messiah the
[39:20] rejected cornerstone
[39:22] the rejected stone and they didn't
[39:24] recognize that was the headstone
[39:26] the stone the builders rejected and as
[39:29] they kicked him out he was ready for his
[39:30] ministry
[39:31] he was anointed slap up the devil read
[39:34] the scripture
[39:35] and now he is ready for his ministry
[39:37] officially rejected by
[39:38] church people that was supposed to be
[39:41] expecting messiah
[39:43] officially turned down jesus christ

[43:46] encouragement and anointing and blessing
[43:48] to your people
[43:49] bless those here with us bless those on
[43:51] the internet connected to us
[43:53] and would hear this message bless them
[43:55] may the anointing flow freely
[43:57] into their homes into the churches into
[43:59] their lives
[44:00] in jesus name we ask it amen god bless
[44:02] you welcome and welcome again you may be
[44:04] seated
[44:05] and welcome to those connected to us
[44:07] live via the internet
[44:08] god richly bless you
[44:12] our title restoration in the time of
[44:16] judgment
[44:20] god promised a revival amen
[44:23] what are we willing to do
[44:26] to get it because if you know the
[44:29] history of revivals
[44:31] or look at church history of any revival
[44:33] it didn't just
[44:34] come there was a preparation always has
[44:39] hearts prepared to get to the revival
[44:43] the astonishing thing the prophet said
[44:47] was that a minister cannot
[44:50] bring a revival that's powerful
[44:55] because we need a revival and you can't
[44:58] have a revival until you have god call
[45:00] men to take it
[45:02] and yet a minister cannot bring it he
[45:04] said it takes
[45:05] the people so somewhere along the line
[45:09] there got to be a transference of the
[45:12] vision
[45:13] of the world being open not to the
[45:15] minister to show how much knowledge he
[45:18] has
[45:18] but it has to be effected to the people
[45:22] that it would transform their lives so
[45:25] as to produce a revival
[45:28] and if you come to church and the word
[45:30] being preached doesn't
[45:32] affect your life affect your life
[45:35] to influence your life you need to get
[45:37] another church
[45:38] you need to get somewhere where you
[45:40] could be inspired enough to move you
[45:42] into action
[45:44] notice what the lord told the people in
[45:47] joel chapter one the meek orphan is cut
[45:49] off
[45:49] drink offering he said weep all night he
[45:52] ministers of the lord
[45:53] sanctify your fast call a solemn
[45:55] assembly in other words
[45:56] take action to get restoration take
[45:59] action
[46:00] to get revival take action to get the
[46:03] breakthrough
[46:04] you don't just sit and said i don't have
[46:06] this you don't just sit and say
[46:08] i'm not getting this i'm not feeling the
[46:10] prison you don't do that
[46:11] you begin to cry out because that's your
[46:14] right as a son to cry out
[46:16] he said if my people that are called by
[46:18] my name shall humble themselves and pray
[46:21] you see when you humble yourself then
[46:23] you could sincerely pray
[46:25] because you know you are dependent on
[46:26] him but when you've got something in
[46:28] your pocket
[46:29] and you don't depend upon god and you're
[46:32] going by your might and your strength
[46:33] and by your power
[46:35] you can't pray because you are all right
[46:37] you are strong
[46:39] you're going in your strength but when
[46:41] you understand
[46:42] without him you are nothing when you
[46:44] understand you are
[46:45] nobody and you need him more than ever
[46:48] when you understand
[46:49] that you have to break down yourself
[46:51] before your god
[46:53] then you could effectively pray oh god
[46:55] we have sinned
[46:56] we have failed we are fall short restore
[47:00] the oil
[47:01] restore the wine restore hallelujah
[47:04] [Applause]
[47:08] cry out this is what god wants
[47:12] from his people brother said god was
[47:15] waiting for the people to pray
[47:17] in order to get his servants into action
[47:21] when the people begin to pray and god
[47:24] could come down and said i've heard
[47:26] the cries of my people and i come down
[47:29] to any time
[47:30] if if if legion didn't cry out jesus
[47:33] couldn't respond
[47:34] he had was to cry out in order to get
[47:37] help
[47:38] you see a lot of people in drugs and
[47:40] drink
[47:41] and smoke pong and all kind of but
[47:43] they're not crying out
[47:45] you they get contented at their place of
[47:47] defeat
[47:48] they are satisfied at their place and
[47:51] they are comfortable
[47:52] that they wake up in the morning had to
[47:54] hit the bottle they go through the day
[47:57] they have to take cocaine or they have
[47:58] to smoke a cigarette they are
[48:00] comfortable in that zone nothing tells
[48:02] them
[48:03] that they are dying let me tell them
[48:05] they're on their way out to here
[48:07] you're not living to be 120 you'll be
[48:09] all on the way out of here
[48:11] but why i'm on my way let's give the
[48:14] devil a jamming why
[48:15] i'm on my way let's get victory over the
[48:18] loss of the eyes over the lusts of the
[48:20] flesh
[48:20] over the prayer while be on our way
[48:23] [Applause]
[48:27] jesus knew he was going he knew the
[48:30] victory was at the cross
[48:32] the victory wasn't the signs and the
[48:33] ones actually jesus had small miracles
[48:36] and built up to the raising of the dead
[48:38] that was like a capstone miracle and
[48:41] when they saw the dead raised with
[48:43] lazarus
[48:44] they see the whole world going after
[48:46] this man we
[48:47] have to do something let's call our
[48:50] emergency meeting
[48:52] all we disagree with we have to shake
[48:54] their hands
[48:55] let's form a sahaja yoga immediately
[48:58] immediately let's get this console going
[49:01] to stop this rolling revival
[49:03] called jesus a one-man revivalist
[49:09] we can't stop him because when the
[49:10] people were hungry i was three thousand
[49:12] he took five loaves and two fishes and
[49:13] fed five thousand people
[49:15] that's a dangerous man you can't even
[49:18] cut him off with the bakery
[49:19] you can't cut down food from the man
[49:21] when we said taxes
[49:22] he told his disciples go get a fish and
[49:25] pay
[49:25] give caesar what is caesar how could you
[49:28] defeat a man that seems to know
[49:31] all what he's supposed to do when he's
[49:33] supposed to do
[49:35] where he's supposed to go and how he's
[49:38] supposed to do it
[49:48] how could you how could you choose a man
[49:50] like that off
[49:52] how could you recommend inviting your
[49:54] wedding
[49:55] everything going good they're saving
[49:57] them orders showing the main course menu
[50:00] and they come and tell them the wine ran
[50:01] out
[50:04] jesus i am a guest too i don't have a
[50:07] winery
[50:08] i'm not in the grave stamping business i
[50:10] never grape store in business
[50:12] what have i to do with that
[50:16] then some whatever you say do do oh god
[50:19] could we come to that spot
[50:20] that whatever he said whatever court
[50:24] tell you you could do
[50:26] without question
[50:30] then jesus said let them go and draw
[50:32] some water
[50:34] draw some water with the water pot know
[50:37] what that could do
[50:38] is the same water it's the same water
[50:41] it's just have to obey
[50:43] and as they draw the water and they pour
[50:45] oh
[50:46] hallelujah the same word and poor
[50:50] come on now same books and poor
[50:54] because jesus said draw it this morning
[50:57] and poor and he going to turn your water
[51:01] into wine and wine is the stimulation
[51:05] of revelation with wine you can't sit
[51:08] down
[51:09] you can't sit still your hands have to
[51:12] do something
[51:13] your foot have to do something your
[51:16] elbow have to do something
[51:18] even your neck oh
[51:21] hallelujah but your body got to do
[51:24] something
[51:25] because wine brings us stimulation
[51:33] jesus turn water
[51:37] into wine he bypassed the grapes
[51:42] he bypassed the crushing of the grapes
[51:45] he bypassed the whole process

[52:34] you see after a while you have to take
[52:35] note right now people taking notes
[52:37] write and write directly but afterwards
[52:38] they will take note that you have been
[52:40] with jesus
[52:41] a different kind of note you can't write
[52:43] that note
[52:44] you have to run and tell somebody that
[52:46] man have been with jesus
[52:48] because he is doing what jesus did
[52:55] are we ready for that are we ready for
[52:58] the same jesus the same jesus
[53:02] not another one
[53:06] you may be seated this
[53:09] same jesus
[53:14] in the old days in the 60s there's a
[53:16] preacher i felt like i'm in a hunchback
[53:18] you know 100 bucks
[53:19] they come back and reminded him turn
[53:21] around
[53:22] put his knee man back and boy jesus
[53:26] and people taught the man back break
[53:28] when they look the man back straight as
[53:30] ever
[53:33] now don't go and try that they've got
[53:35] their anointing
[53:39] these guys were not intimidated
[53:43] by no physical condition no wheelchair
[53:46] we
[53:46] get this opportunity to get people out
[53:49] when they see wheelchair they get
[53:51] excited when they say crutches they get
[53:53] excited
[53:54] when they see playing the fire in their
[53:57] eyes
[53:58] because the blind have to see because
[54:00] jesus
[54:01] is here and if jesus is here something
[54:04] got to take place
[54:08] is there believers in the house today
[54:10] [Applause]
[54:18] hallelujah
[54:21] oh you have to look at your conditions
[54:23] at your mountains
[54:25] at your obstacles at your hurdles you
[54:27] have to look at them as opportunities
[54:29] for god to come on the scene one gideon
[54:32] at one time say lord if
[54:34] if you'll be with me do this do that
[54:36] gideon
[54:37] take things for granted he said the lord
[54:39] be with us where
[54:41] are the miracles because god is a god of
[54:44] miracles
[54:46] but when people have money in the park
[54:47] yet
[54:49] they believe they're working miracles
[54:51] because they could pay
[54:53] to go to the doctor they don't need
[54:55] jesus until the money runs out
[54:59] but when you understand that we are
[55:02] promised
[55:03] a restoration of this miracle working
[55:06] god
[55:07] one time brother man said there was a
[55:09] place that was farming in the land no
[55:11] rain
[55:11] and a man had enough of it an old man he
[55:14] went in the middle of the street i like
[55:15] that
[55:16] not in his house and close the window in
[55:18] the middle of the street
[55:20] he went and said lord god has all frail
[55:23] hand raised up
[55:24] he says i serve you all these years send
[55:26] on rain he said i man
[55:28] people run because no rain was coming
[55:30] what god sent me into that prayer
[55:35] do you understand what we're talking
[55:37] about elijah said not even jew or rain
[55:39] will fall until i called for it
[55:41] it was i shut up heavens by my message i
[55:44] shut up the blessings by my message and
[55:47] only my work could unlock the presence
[55:49] of
[55:49] god you talk about power i want to know
[55:53] i'm not i want to feel
[55:54] a fire in your soul wanting this revival
[56:03] now you're gonna forgive me i am a
[56:05] revivalist in case you didn't know
[56:09] in case you didn't know t.o is a
[56:12] revivalist
[56:13] not a dennis not an intellectualist
[56:17] a revivalist i love revival
[56:21] i am a revival i will cause a revival
[56:24] we going to start a revival a prize
[56:27] revival
[56:28] a seven thunder revival a holy ghost
[56:31] revival
[56:39] this is the gift that god gave me this
[56:41] is the fire
[56:43] that god put in my soul you see any man
[56:45] could study for seven days and bring a
[56:47] lot of mysteries
[56:48] trump is violence woes plays woman his
[56:50] son plus israel
[56:52] gog on magog russia amen blood moons
[56:58] universe star certain mars lineup
[57:02] number nine and number six and number
[57:04] this are number three and number five
[57:06] and what can i turn keys with all of
[57:07] that
[57:10] and after all of that nothing happening
[57:12] it's just
[57:13] what i call verbal gymnastics flipping
[57:15] here and someone's sorting verbally
[57:18] but it's not causing the fire of faith
[57:21] to break upon your soul
[57:23] understand this understand if jesus got
[57:26] newsletters were sick
[57:28] jesus said the disciples are glad i'm
[57:30] not here
[57:34] he said let us hurry get a quick car
[57:36] took one get my friend lazarus come come
[57:38] let's pray for him
[57:38] he's some guy on that day news comes
[57:41] lazarus is dead
[57:43] so now the default is coffee
[57:46] and biscuit sad faces black wheels
[57:50] everybody in sad mode that's the default
[57:53] okay
[57:54] jesus went down to the funeral week
[57:58] only to hear testimony lord
[58:01] if you had not if it had been here
[58:04] my brother had not died hallelujah
[58:09] but then the sister said something a
[58:11] little more
[58:12] she said but even now
[58:14] [Applause]
[58:19] no no no no hear the thing if she had
[58:22] stopped it lord if i had nothing yeah my
[58:24] brother and i died and stop right there
[58:25] they bury him complete the burial
[58:29] and give lazarus a salute
[58:33] [Music]
[58:35] a good send-off but when she said even
[58:38] no
[58:44] [Music]
[58:45] even though cause a chain reaction
[58:49] even though activate faith and power
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:56] now watch the default atmosphere was
[58:59] there
[59:00] because the bible said the shortest two
[59:01] words in the bible is jesus wept
[59:04] so jesus finds himself in default also
[59:07] but when
[59:07] even knows okay even brought him out of
[59:11] the default
[59:12] of tears and weeping to say
[59:16] i am
[59:19] i am you have to watch what he's saying
[59:22] after that
[59:23] because he can be anything a man is dead
[59:27] he can't just say anything you have to
[59:29] say the right thing
[59:31] the man is dead we need an answer he
[59:34] said i
[59:34] am the resurrection come on now give the
[59:38] lord a shout of prayer
[59:42] and what you have need of the i am
[59:46] is willing the i am
[59:49] oh glory to god
[59:53] i am the resurrection
[59:56] and the life you may be seated he that
[59:59] believeth on me
[1:00:00] though he would death yeah shall he live
[1:00:03] watch this
[1:00:04] lioness is dead lazarus can come aboard
[1:00:08] i believe jesus rickman no he's dead
[1:00:11] so that is not for lazarus in that way
[1:00:15] this is for people are wrong to get
[1:00:17] activated
[1:00:18] with resurrection power with
[1:00:20] resurrection faith
[1:00:22] to move jesus a little further when
[1:00:24] jesus couldn't have
[1:00:26] he couldn't help it he said where have
[1:00:27] you laid him
[1:00:30] he didn't say go and raise him
[1:00:33] he just said where have you lead him
[1:00:38] humans say but he's thinking
[1:00:43] he really dead in case he didn't
[1:00:47] catch the full picture he's not just
[1:00:50] sleeping
[1:00:51] he is really dead he stink it
[1:00:57] that's human talking jesus said roll
[1:01:00] away the stone
[1:01:04] no now if you believe he's thinking and
[1:01:06] he really dead
[1:01:07] he really did where you going
[1:01:12] so they had to roll past his thinking
[1:01:15] real past he really did
[1:01:17] and say and believe the command roll
[1:01:20] away
[1:01:21] roll away in those days there is a
[1:01:24] roller stone over the hole
[1:01:25] with the man they roll away the stone
[1:01:28] because you can't bring a man in the big
[1:01:29] stone
[1:01:29] are you coming out he can't rule from
[1:01:30] inside roll away the stone do something
[1:01:35] did you get that you have no
[1:01:38] manifestation until you
[1:01:39] do something
[1:01:45] roll away your stone i'm not praising
[1:01:47] him this morning outside the praise god
[1:01:49] maybe your gray here might start to turn
[1:01:50] back black i don't know but roll over
[1:01:53] because still no miracles maybe your
[1:01:55] wrinkles might start to leave you

[1:02:20] feel just as strong
[1:02:21] as when i first started out i'm feeling
[1:02:24] inspired
[1:02:25] i feel anointed this morning i feel for
[1:02:28] revival
[1:02:29] this morning
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:39] in the pentecostal age when fire struck
[1:02:42] the spending castle
[1:02:44] men shoot bullets on them and it falls
[1:02:46] we won't close like nothing
[1:02:48] they were bulletproof
[1:02:51] fire was on them and these are run them
[1:02:54] and people say look oh god look what
[1:02:56] they're going through but i'm saying no
[1:02:58] everywhere they go fire picking up god
[1:03:00] let people run them out
[1:03:02] at firebreaker they run them to that
[1:03:03] city next firebreaker they run them here
[1:03:05] and go to the
[1:03:06] light the devil never end up in in that
[1:03:09] kind of bubble mode
[1:03:10] because if he only knew what was
[1:03:11] happening he would tell him stay right
[1:03:12] there
[1:03:13] keep the fire right there don't keep it
[1:03:14] burning up but sit right there
[1:03:16] but god had them devils running the
[1:03:18] people and have to run them
[1:03:19] fire picking up here that's what we want
[1:03:21] inside of here let fire
[1:03:23] strike one sister in one pew and let
[1:03:26] them charm the other
[1:03:27] power let fire move from brother to

[1:04:03] husband to me and do something for jesus
[1:04:05] get on fire for god
[1:04:13] fire of god
[1:04:18] the people of israel when they came out
[1:04:21] they never knew
[1:04:22] about this fire moses met the fire they
[1:04:25] didn't
[1:04:27] when they saw moses and saw one just
[1:04:28] like them i won't even say trying to
[1:04:30] make yourself a prince over us
[1:04:35] you went and come back and you're trying
[1:04:37] to make yourself a prince over us
[1:04:43] you are one of us
[1:04:47] don't get too big for your breaches
[1:04:53] they didn't know that man met god
[1:04:58] there was no witness there was no
[1:05:00] evidence
[1:05:01] there was nothing to show the people
[1:05:02] that this man met god
[1:05:04] when moses went in the court of pharaoh
[1:05:06] the two million people was not there
[1:05:09] they were seen about saving the slave
[1:05:13] masters
[1:05:14] moses went into the court of pharaoh as
[1:05:17] all kings
[1:05:18] and kingdoms bring homage to pharaoh and
[1:05:22] bring
[1:05:22] gifts and tidings to pharaoh moses was
[1:05:25] in the lineup

[1:07:21] take your people you and your god
[1:07:23] everybody leave
[1:07:26] take them and go and i see the devil
[1:07:29] packing up shop because if he was the
[1:07:32] backside we're going already

[1:07:35] already this is 40 years
[1:07:37] of beer wood 40 years of rocket gospel
[1:07:41] and teaching and seed in our souls
[1:07:44] and we have the secret the secret is the
[1:07:47] word
[1:07:48] is in the bread we walk in with the
[1:07:51] secret
[1:07:52] now watch not in the right head
[1:07:55] in the bride's heart and the devil can't
[1:07:57] get there
[1:08:01] because your heart just failed god had
[1:08:04] that part hidden
[1:08:05] that scene you hidden the woman of the
[1:08:07] well she had a seat in her that was
[1:08:09] hidden
[1:08:10] she herself was not aware of what was
[1:08:11] inside of her she thought she was just
[1:08:13] ordinary
[1:08:14] she thought she was a normal one having
[1:08:16] this man and that man and that man
[1:08:18] until jesus come and bring the true
[1:08:20] mirror of the word
[1:08:21] and present him to her her true picture
[1:08:24] her true name
[1:08:25] her true glory a true calling a
[1:08:28] predestination
[1:08:29] her election
[1:08:33] and when she saw that she was convinced
[1:08:36] she was convinced and she ran and said
[1:08:39] come see a man
[1:08:40] who told me everything i needed to know
[1:08:46] now um how could somebody
[1:08:49] like that not love god
[1:08:54] you've been through hell you've been
[1:08:57] through torment
[1:08:58] you've been through humiliation you've
[1:09:01] been through rape what kind of condition
[1:09:03] and god come and cover you with his love
[1:09:06] wrap you with the blanket of his grace
[1:09:09] bless you with this righteousness
[1:09:12] how you could come and not worship him
[1:09:20] he redeemed you you have nothing to say
[1:09:24] but thanks and honor and praise and
[1:09:27] glory and blessings

[1:09:37] like all the people will
[1:09:39] i don't want to burst your balloon
[1:09:41] balloon at your living room
[1:09:42] it is a balloon that will boost
[1:09:44] eventually
[1:09:46] but the thing of it is we are here
[1:09:49] really
[1:09:50] for the unknown glory of god
[1:09:53] and all what we do that is not for
[1:09:55] christ doesn't count
[1:09:59] the currency of heaven is not
[1:10:00] materialistic the currency of heaven is
[1:10:03] not cars and house and land
[1:10:05] and whatever that's not the currency of
[1:10:06] heaven
[1:10:08] that's why when jesus gets the power of
[1:10:10] the rich man and
[1:10:11] the poor man and the rich man in hell
[1:10:13] the rich man said oh tell my family
[1:10:15] don't come here

[1:12:34] and the group is what determines their
[1:12:35] vision their outlook their pictures
[1:12:38] there is no individual revelation that
[1:12:40] inspires them
[1:12:42] and notice how jesus he dealt with the
[1:12:44] disciples as individuals
[1:12:46] peter this what is that to thee followed
[1:12:49] me
[1:12:50] he dealt with them as individuals
[1:12:52] because they are
[1:12:55] when the group decided to do something
[1:12:57] when judas was
[1:12:59] hung himself the group decided to choose
[1:13:02] a man by lot and they pick up a man
[1:13:03] called matias
[1:13:05] matthias did nothing no book of matthias
[1:13:07] revolution matters
[1:13:08] prophet says just matters just fit in
[1:13:10] there like matthias
[1:13:12] baran said i was all human that was
[1:13:14] man's
[1:13:15] choice these people had the holy ghost
[1:13:18] and they choose a normal man that was
[1:13:20] going to have no testimony nothing
[1:13:21] because god choose paul to fit in that
[1:13:25] place there
[1:13:26] to be part of that number paul was the
[1:13:28] man that god chose
[1:13:30] so you see man have a way of you know
[1:13:32] using the eyes and seeing and whatnot we
[1:13:33] give them room for that but when god
[1:13:36] put his hand on you you didn't know what
[1:13:38] i said
[1:13:39] when god put his hands on you it is his
[1:13:44] hands
[1:13:46] come on now come on now
[1:13:49] that's why paul said this way nothing
[1:13:51] present nothing
[1:13:52] past nothing to come could separate me
[1:13:55] from the love of god that is in christ
[1:13:58] jesus
[1:13:59] not peril not sword not poverty not
[1:14:02] trials
[1:14:02] not testing not tribulation
[1:14:08] that's not group think that is
[1:14:12] revelation
[1:14:17] with that revelation you know your
[1:14:19] children will be delivered
[1:14:21] i don't care who they are right now i
[1:14:23] don't care what condition right now
[1:14:25] that is what challenging your faith
[1:14:26] because jesus didn't let lazarus death
[1:14:28] intimidate him
[1:14:29] blind bartimaeus didn't look look people
[1:14:32] tell black to me he cannot hear you
[1:14:34] blind you're blind but he cried out
[1:14:39] and and that crime brought a fit that
[1:14:42] knocked heaven's dawn
[1:14:43] and heaven why do you think men set up
[1:14:47] satellite
[1:14:48] satellite is high to send down signals
[1:14:51] and information and radar and different
[1:14:53] kind of things they satellite
[1:14:55] they needed high up there to send these
[1:14:57] signals all around the world
[1:14:59] right now that is the impersonation of
[1:15:00] what we have
[1:15:06] what do you mean by ovid but a branham
[1:15:08] was in south america
[1:15:10] a baby had died a woman heard about a
[1:15:13] baby race from the dead

[1:16:03] prefer because you don't know who i am
[1:16:04] they sent somebody down but woman's
[1:16:06] still backing true
[1:16:08] she battled to the point where she
[1:16:10] touched the satellite
[1:16:14] that is what in him our satellite her
[1:16:17] faith
[1:16:18] hit god and god touches prophet
[1:16:22] break a vision and you say send for that
[1:16:24] woman bring her up

[1:16:30] the back and bring you in front

[1:16:35] shouting because you want to see
[1:16:37] that nobody could stop the fate in your

[1:19:58] oh glory to god and god is restoring god
[1:20:01] is about to restore
[1:20:02] the challenging thing or the amazing
[1:20:05] thing
[1:20:06] is that god is restoring right in the
[1:20:08] all of judgment
[1:20:09] you see when moses when noah was waiting
[1:20:11] for the water
[1:20:13] to raise his ark the same water he was
[1:20:15] written for
[1:20:16] was going to judge the world the same
[1:20:18] spirit
[1:20:19] that we are looking for and asking for
[1:20:22] will produce a judgment to anas and
[1:20:25] sapphira
[1:20:26] reproduce judgment tax fight in the
[1:20:28] church will produce a judgment that
[1:20:30] begins in the house of god that same
[1:20:33] spirit
[1:20:34] that we are looking for that same spirit
[1:20:37] that we are expecting
[1:20:38] it coming in a time of judgment cause
[1:20:40] judgment is fire
[1:20:41] fire fire going to come the fire of
[1:20:44] judgment the day
[1:20:46] the great and terrible day of the lord
[1:20:48] it's coming
[1:20:50] there is where when jesus went to the
[1:20:52] temple
[1:20:53] and found where it was written in the
[1:20:55] book of isaiah
[1:20:56] he left the part out he said the spirit
[1:20:58] is upon me to bring good titans
[1:21:01] to heal the sick to raise the dead to do
[1:21:04] all of that
[1:21:04] but then the party left out was to
[1:21:06] declare the day of vengeance
[1:21:09] of our god and that day of vengeance
[1:21:12] is for the bride mrs jesus will come to
[1:21:16] the temple
[1:21:17] mrs jesus will pick up the scripture
[1:21:19] right in the day of judgment
[1:21:21] and revelation 2 17 will be the voice of
[1:21:24] grace
[1:21:25] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:21:28] whosoever will come drink of the water
[1:21:31] of life freely
[1:21:32] god gonna be failing the pride god gonna
[1:21:36] be unveiled
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:41] listen to this god
[1:21:44] will be unveiled again
[1:21:48] and before he's unveiled he has to be
[1:21:50] healed
[1:21:52] hide himself literally hide himself in
[1:21:56] you
[1:22:00] do you think daniel know he had all that
[1:22:01] power hidden in him
[1:22:03] that power was unveiled when there's so
[1:22:04] many lions then no wasn't
[1:22:06] wasn't the lion who had breakfast lunch
[1:22:08] and dinner you it was
[1:22:10] hungry lions lions who had the appetite
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] for eaten they teach
[1:22:17] sharp razor sharp they waiting for
[1:22:21] food and when the lions see that you're
[1:22:23] coming down they say
[1:22:24] food reach until god send
[1:22:28] fire and lion interfere with fire around
[1:22:31] food
[1:22:35] so you see there is power in sons
[1:22:39] power in daughters ready to be released
[1:22:42] in the hour amidst the challenge amidst
[1:22:46] the judgment
[1:22:47] amidst the fear because fear going to
[1:22:50] strike you know
[1:22:51] oh yes los angeles about to sink because
[1:22:54] the prophet saw it
[1:22:56] a prophet spoke it a prophet said there
[1:22:58] is a vision america bummed up
[1:23:00] in smoke before the coming of the lord
[1:23:02] the prophet saw russia
[1:23:03] sending a missile to bomb the vatican
[1:23:05] saw it
[1:23:06] the prophets prophesied and predicted
[1:23:09] they see it
[1:23:10] it's a vision and when they come back
[1:23:12] they say thus see the lord
[1:23:14] god gave roma space to repent refuse to
[1:23:16] repent
[1:23:17] kill two million people through the dark
[1:23:19] ages as if god gonna forget that
[1:23:21] but in the revelation of the spirit and
[1:23:23] the mystery of god
[1:23:24] the seed went down in the ground and god
[1:23:27] finds martin luther a catholic
[1:23:29] break upon him that just shall live by
[1:23:30] faith and that's the bit of the
[1:23:32] protestant
[1:23:33] but god didn't stop there it was the
[1:23:35] restoration of the cankerworm
[1:23:36] the catawome the palmer woman the
[1:23:38] caterpillar
[1:23:40] he bought luther then he bought wesley
[1:23:42] luther in germany
[1:23:43] western england and got the pentecost in
[1:23:46] america and then god sent a prophet to
[1:23:48] bring the word
[1:23:49] with the restoration of the word brings
[1:23:51] the restoration of power
[1:23:53] no word no power because the word is god
[1:23:57] and the word was lost so before power
[1:23:59] could come back
[1:24:00] he had to restore the world towards the
[1:24:02] restoration of the word
[1:24:03] and the word brings the fate so before
[1:24:05] the faith could come
[1:24:06] the word had to be restored so god said
[1:24:09] i will restore
[1:24:10] all what they eat them oh what the trash
[1:24:14] all with the pack-up shop i'm gonna
[1:24:16] bring it right back
[1:24:18] the church gonna get the correct
[1:24:19] template the church gonna get the
[1:24:21] correct vision
[1:24:22] he said write the vision and make it
[1:24:24] plain the vision has to be spoken
[1:24:26] the vision has to be written you're not
[1:24:28] coming here as how you feel
[1:24:30] you coming to fit into god's program
[1:24:36] i am not preaching my opinion i am
[1:24:39] preaching a message
[1:24:41] that prepares us for revival
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:48] understand this understand this jesus
[1:24:50] have to come among us
[1:24:53] [Applause]
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:55] before the rapture you just don't go
[1:24:56] when rapture you got the same way you're
[1:24:58] going wrapped i'm going to meet him in
[1:24:59] the air you'll sing that in the
[1:25:01] trick to the tribulation before you go
[1:25:04] in the air
[1:25:06] jesus have to be amongst the people
[1:25:09] in spirit form
[1:25:13] brother branham said it is with him
[1:25:15] moving in and out
[1:25:17] and then we are worshiping the living
[1:25:19] christ

[1:27:06] if my people come by they shall humble
[1:27:08] themselves and pray
[1:27:09] a lot of people don't pray because

[1:27:14] might their strength their ability their
[1:27:16] job

[1:27:24] dependent upon you
[1:27:26] oh hallelujah humble themselves and pray
[1:27:29] and then turn
[1:27:30] from their wicked ways it means
[1:27:33] challenge your default condition your
[1:27:36] default
[1:27:37] position there are some people who don't
[1:27:40] argue this is how i am
[1:27:42] but that is how you gonna will be this
[1:27:45] is how you always know it and today
[1:27:47] something
[1:27:47] you know peter peter's wife didn't make
[1:27:50] breakfast on time we didn't know food or
[1:27:51] whatever it is and peter didn't
[1:27:53] abuse her and rough her and carry on

[1:29:33] your default
[1:29:34] i want you to break out of your default

[1:35:49] could somebody give the lord a shout
[1:35:51] glory glory glory
[1:35:54] praise god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:58] listen to this i checked something out
[1:36:00] what is fire made out of
[1:36:02] you know that fire generates heat and
[1:36:03] light but have you ever wondered what
[1:36:05] it's made out of
[1:36:06] here's a look at the chemical
[1:36:07] composition of fire fire is the result
[1:36:10] of a chemical reaction called combustion
[1:36:12] at a certain point in the combustion
[1:36:15] reaction called the ignition point
[1:36:17] flames are produced oh hallelujah
[1:36:21] flames consist primarily of carbon
[1:36:22] dioxide vapor
[1:36:24] water oxygen and nitrogen fire emits
[1:36:27] heat and light
[1:36:28] in order for combustion and fire to
[1:36:31] occur
[1:36:32] three things must be present fuel
[1:36:35] oxygen and energy usually in the form of
[1:36:39] heat
[1:36:40] we need those three things oh hallelujah
[1:36:43] hallelujah
[1:36:44] we need the word we need sanctification
[1:36:48] and we need worship you put that
[1:36:51] together
[1:36:52] it creates an ignition point come on now
[1:36:55] come on now don't don't sleep on me no
[1:36:57] don't back up you have to go right with
[1:36:59] me now ride with me now
[1:37:01] because jesus open the understanding so
[1:37:04] they get the first component
[1:37:06] which is the word oh hallelujah then
[1:37:09] afterwards they went in the upper room
[1:37:10] and what they were doing
[1:37:11] they were creating an atmosphere by
[1:37:14] worshiping
[1:37:16] and praising god continually
[1:37:20] in a sanctified condition
[1:37:29] we need a tree sanctified
[1:37:33] the word open to you and praise and
[1:37:36] worship
[1:37:37] and when you come and you start to
[1:37:38] praise and worship it gets so hot
[1:37:41] it takes 10 days but i'm saying mary had
[1:37:43] us to lose
[1:37:44] her dignity marriage was a loser pride
[1:37:47] because she was pride proud
[1:37:49] of having jesus i am the mother of jesus
[1:37:54] oh my sister mary had a little chip on
[1:37:58] her shoulder because she was the mother
[1:38:01] of jesus
[1:38:02] she had to lose that she had to lose
[1:38:04] that so much
[1:38:05] that she has to begin to see she is just
[1:38:07] as the same mary magdalene
[1:38:12] she have to see herself at the same
[1:38:13] level like mary even you marry i marry i
[1:38:16] make jesus you make problems and trouble
[1:38:18] but um
[1:38:19] we are the same level we are daughters
[1:38:21] of god yes yes yes we are daughters of
[1:38:23] god
[1:38:23] so america say i am mary and you and you
[1:38:26] are mary no it's not like that
[1:38:28] it's both mary's and i'm saying we are
[1:38:30] all sons and daughters
[1:38:31] of the living god not no higher one and
[1:38:34] lower one and this one no no no we are
[1:38:36] sons and daughters of the living god
[1:38:37] so it take ten days for pride to come
[1:38:40] out ten days for jealousy
[1:38:41] remember the mother came with two sons
[1:38:43] and says master oh
[1:38:45] hallelujah could you put one on my left
[1:38:47] and one on my right
[1:38:49] one woman came and asked could you put
[1:38:51] one son on the left and one on the right
[1:38:53] isn't that right well all them was in
[1:38:55] the upper room too they had to lose all
[1:38:56] that pride all that kind of thing like
[1:38:58] that
[1:38:58] until what happened begin to worship the
[1:39:00] atmosphere that'll be created and what
[1:39:01] happened
[1:39:02] they come to an ignition point and then
[1:39:04] tongues of fire
[1:39:05] light upon them and they were all filled
[1:39:07] with the holy ghost
[1:39:09] they break out to that combustion they
[1:39:11] break out to that inspiration
[1:39:13] they break to that ignition point and
[1:39:15] that is what desperation does
[1:39:17] it breaks you to our ignition point
[1:39:19] where fire have to make an appearance
[1:39:21] fire to come down glory have to come
[1:39:23] down the witness of the spirit have to
[1:39:25] come long
[1:39:26] healing have to come long deliverance
[1:39:28] have to come down picture of to come
[1:39:30] down
[1:39:30] how many want that and what will you do
[1:39:35] to start a revival i'm bout to wrap up
[1:39:38] oh glory to god and the bible went and
[1:39:41] said oh god is it consuming fire
[1:39:43] isn't that right god want the word to be
[1:39:46] consumed
[1:39:47] that's why ibrahim put on the altar i
[1:39:49] see the wood
[1:39:50] but where is the fire i see the wood but
[1:39:52] where's the fire core will provide
[1:39:54] himself a sacrifice
[1:39:55] god like the sacrifice that is consumed
[1:39:58] by fire
[1:39:59] fire is a witness of god let the court
[1:40:01] answer by fire
[1:40:02] let him be god because our god is a
[1:40:05] consuming fire
[1:40:06] i like the word consuming it burns
[1:40:09] everything out
[1:40:10] it burns until there is nothing more to
[1:40:12] burn when fire start to move nothing
[1:40:14] stops it
[1:40:15] it keeps burning until there is nothing
[1:40:17] else to consume
[1:40:18] that's a fire and when the fire of god
[1:40:21] begins to move
[1:40:22] the church is ready to be purified the
[1:40:25] church is ready
[1:40:26] to get the purifier failed in the sons
[1:40:29] and daughters of the living god
[1:40:33] oh hallelujah i have an entire message
[1:40:37] here you know
[1:40:38] but i'm not going by that i'm going by
[1:40:40] what is called sitting upon me right now
[1:40:42] hallelujah because i know this here is a
[1:40:44] new year i know there's a different day
[1:40:46] i know that different emphasis
[1:40:48] and you have to create the atmosphere
[1:40:49] you have to be convinced
[1:40:51] that you have to bring a revival you
[1:40:53] have to be convinced
[1:40:54] that you have to break to the ignition
[1:40:56] point
[1:41:00] understand this what abandonment said
[1:41:03] when the people
[1:41:04] of god go to calling
[1:41:07] on god there'll be a national showdown
[1:41:11] so i have for years i have been looking
[1:41:13] for the sign
[1:41:14] of the burden of prayer to come upon the
[1:41:17] people
[1:41:18] and i have not seen that because i know
[1:41:21] god let's go
[1:41:21] just gonna come down it didn't happen in
[1:41:23] the upper room it didn't happen any days
[1:41:25] of
[1:41:25] old there was a prayer prepared jesus
[1:41:28] couldn't just land in jerusalem and say
[1:41:30] i
[1:41:30] am here there was a way prepared for him
[1:41:33] to come
[1:41:34] and when the pillar fire came down in
[1:41:36] this age the voice said as john the
[1:41:38] baptist
[1:41:39] was sent to forerun the first coming of
[1:41:42] christ
[1:41:42] you have a message that was sent to for
[1:41:45] around his second
[1:41:46] coming so the message itself is a
[1:41:48] message of preparation
[1:41:50] for the holy ghost capstone
[1:41:53] manifestation
[1:41:54] to come among god's people the capstone
[1:41:57] cannot come our knowledge is too wide
[1:41:59] it's got to come onto a call-out bunch
[1:42:01] fitted in the holy spirit slot
[1:42:04] that is what the whole ego is coming to
[1:42:05] connect with so we have got to get in
[1:42:07] the spirit
[1:42:09] of the coming of the lord the homosexual
[1:42:12] in the spirit
[1:42:13] to vindicate sodom and gomorrah america
[1:42:16] is finished
[1:42:19] america is finished as a world power
[1:42:23] they're about to be sentenced and judged
[1:42:25] russia is finding its place
[1:42:27] they already advanced in weapons and
[1:42:29] technology they are in position already
[1:42:32] what about the bride
[1:42:36] and the thing about it nothing can move
[1:42:38] externally until the bride get that
[1:42:40] movement
[1:42:42] let me challenge you to hear it bro says
[1:42:44] what you see manifested temporarily
[1:42:46] will be manifested in his fullness when
[1:42:48] the press come down
[1:42:50] the bride will be pressed how many knows
[1:42:51] that the pride will be a hundred percent
[1:42:54] group how many knows that
[1:42:55] how many know they were close on the
[1:42:56] churches how many knows they're going to
[1:42:58] say we have to shut down
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:02] because the prophet saw it and we're
[1:43:04] going to be in places
[1:43:07] in homes they're going to convert the
[1:43:09] church in the warehouses he said
[1:43:11] in america he saw it oh hallelujah
[1:43:14] but then when the press come down
[1:43:16] judgments hit in the earth
[1:43:18] a bride anointed with power to preach
[1:43:21] to the doomed to preach the people who
[1:43:24] cannot be saved
[1:43:25] one message to preach listen to this i'm
[1:43:28] going to close
[1:43:30] ah noah preach 120 years
[1:43:34] bill and anak before he even
[1:43:38] put the first wood he was preaching
[1:43:41] because gore gave him a message
[1:43:43] evidence of his belief and faith in the
[1:43:45] message
[1:43:46] was the building of the ark every year
[1:43:50] the act going higher taller
[1:43:53] getting more constructed it took a
[1:43:56] hundred and twenty years
[1:43:58] the people laughed because the wood was
[1:44:00] soft wood that would sink
[1:44:02] the people laughed because there was no
[1:44:04] water to float the boat in
[1:44:07] he built it on land building a mountain
[1:44:09] as it was and there's no way it could
[1:44:11] float or whatever it is
[1:44:13] they had their jokes they had their
[1:44:15] mockery
[1:44:17] isn't that right i know a preacher
[1:44:20] come into the ark come into the ark
[1:44:23] get into the ark of safety act is now
[1:44:25] complete
[1:44:26] people still laughing threatened
[1:44:28] partying and so on
[1:44:29] then god tell noah let the animals come
[1:44:33] in
[1:44:34] two by two the people seeing animals
[1:44:37] going
[1:44:37] peers going in the ark no humans
[1:44:42] despairs no faith is about to save
[1:44:45] only his family they are going to be in
[1:44:48] the ark
[1:44:49] he is preaching then the bible said and
[1:44:52] god
[1:44:52] shut the door and the door
[1:44:56] that god shot no man can open
[1:45:00] the god the door that god opened no man
[1:45:03] could shut but god
[1:45:04] shut no in no tell his children it
[1:45:07] wouldn't rain
[1:45:08] they said daddy are you sure he said
[1:45:10] tomorrow is gonna rain
[1:45:12] next day no rain people
[1:45:15] give a big laugh they say look at noah
[1:45:18] all them animals all those peers are
[1:45:21] animals
[1:45:22] family doors shut the axe stood there
[1:45:26] for seven days preaching
[1:45:29] noah was no longer the voice the ark
[1:45:32] has become the voice the act was
[1:45:35] speaking on behalf of noah
[1:45:37] the act was no a witness of truth and
[1:45:40] righteousness the act was
[1:45:41] shut if somebody wanted to come then
[1:45:43] there was no room
[1:45:45] the door was shut no i couldn't open the
[1:45:46] door for them the chance was missed
[1:45:49] it was over it was finished for the
[1:45:51] entire world
[1:45:53] and all of a sudden after seven days the
[1:45:54] sky turned black
[1:45:56] it was god's judgment about the four
[1:45:59] the rain began to fall 24 hours
[1:46:03] 48 hours 40 days 49 rain
[1:46:07] and more rain the people heading towards
[1:46:10] the ark let us in
[1:46:12] noah couldn't open it because he didn't
[1:46:14] shut it
[1:46:16] he was only instructed to build it
[1:46:17] according to specification
[1:46:20] and before the final closure god tell
[1:46:23] him to pitch
[1:46:24] and seal the ark you see they laugh at
[1:46:27] the soft wood
[1:46:28] and that's how we have to become soft
[1:46:30] and pliable
[1:46:31] that the spirit could seal all the holes
[1:46:33] in our lives
[1:46:35] what they didn't know the wood was soft
[1:46:37] and chosen by god
[1:46:38] because god was bringing a fresh
[1:46:39] revelation how to seal it
[1:46:42] and pitch was going to seal all the
[1:46:44] pores to make the ark waterproof
[1:46:47] he sealed it on the inside and sealing
[1:46:49] the outside
[1:46:50] and when god finished sealing you you'll
[1:46:52] be sealed on the inside
[1:46:53] and sealed on the outside the devil will
