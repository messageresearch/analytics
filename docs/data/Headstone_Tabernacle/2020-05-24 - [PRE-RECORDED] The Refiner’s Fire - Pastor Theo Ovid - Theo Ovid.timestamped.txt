[36:20] wanna read from verse 14 to 18 Malachi
[36:24] chapter 3 wanna read from 1 to 3
[36:29] we're in 2nd Timothy 2
[36:37] nevertheless the foundation of God
[36:39] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[36:43] knoweth them that are his let every one
[36:46] that name it the name of Christ depart
[36:49] from iniquity iniquity is known to do
[36:53] right and doin wrong but in a great
[36:55] house they are not only vessels of gold
[36:58] and silver but also of wood and of earth
[37:02] and some to honor some to dishonor if a
[37:06] man therefore purge himself from these
[37:12] he shall be a vessel unto honor
[37:15] sanctified and meat for the Masters use
[37:19] and be paired unto every good work free
[37:23] also youthful lust but follow
[37:25] righteousness faith charity peace with
[37:30] them that call on the Lord out of a pure
[37:32] heart you read from 2nd Corinthians
[37:36] chapter 6
[37:43] who's 14 be not unequally yoked together
[37:49] with unbelievers for what fellowship
[37:51] hath righteousness with unrighteousness
[37:54] what communion hath light with darkness
[37:57] what Concord Christ will be relieved it
[38:03] with an infidel and what agreement had
[38:06] the temple of God with idols for ye are
[38:11] the Temple of the Living God as God hath
[38:15] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[38:19] them and I will be their God and they
[38:22] shall be my people wherefore come out
[38:28] from among them and be separate saith
[38:31] the Lord and touch not the unclean thing
[38:34] and I will receive you and will be a
[38:38] father unto you and he shall be my sons
[38:40] and daughters saith the Lord Almighty
[38:43] let's read from Malachi chapter 3 we
[38:47] live from booths one
[38:52] behold I send my messenger and he shall
[38:55] prepare the way before me and the Lord
[38:58] whom he seek shall suddenly come to his
[39:03] temple even the messenger of the
[39:06] Covenant whom he delights in behold he
[39:10] shall come saith the Lord of Hosts but
[39:13] who may abide the day of his coming and
[39:16] who shall stand when he appeared for he
[39:20] is like a refiners fire
[39:22] unlike full of soap and he shall sit
[39:27] other as a refiner
[39:29] and a purifier of silver and he shall
[39:33] purify the sons of Levi and purge them
[39:36] as gold and silver that they may offer
[39:38] unto the Lord an offering in
[39:40] righteousness may God bless his word you
[39:43] may be seated
[39:52] [Music]
[39:56] good morning and god bless you greeting
[40:01] to those connected to us on the Internet
[40:05] so bless them to be here this morning
[40:12] this morning I have a title
[40:16] it's the refiners fire the refiners fire
[40:24] our subject the fiery trial which is to
[40:29] try you another inspiration purged
[40:33] vessels ready for the Masters use that's
[40:40] my subject purge vessels ready for the
[40:43] Masters use so we see how the Lord will
[40:46] what Allah would do first today the
[40:51] subject the fiery trial which is a trial
[40:54] with stigma the Scriptures first Peter
[40:55] 4:12 to 14 which Peter said beloved
[40:59] think it not strange concerning the
[41:01] fiery trial which is to try you as some
[41:03] as though some strange thing happen to
[41:06] you but rejoice in as much as you're
[41:10] partakers of Christ's sufferings but
[41:12] when his glory shall be revealed he may
[41:14] also be glad with exceedingly great joy
[41:16] if he be reported for the name of Christ
[41:19] happier ye for the spirit of glory of
[41:22] God rested upon you and for their
[41:24] parties evil spoken of but on your part
[41:27] he is glorified so that is where I get
[41:29] that that subject from that content did
[41:33] not strange
[41:33] the fiery trials that come your way
[41:38] Matthew 7 so we used some scriptures
[41:41] today Matthew 7 this is 50:29
[41:43] this is Jesus words it's in red we way
[41:47] of false prophets
[41:49] they are wrong they always talking
[41:52] walking becoming which come to you in
[41:55] sheep's clothing but inwardly they are
[41:59] ravening wolves
[42:01] ye shall know them by their fruits do
[42:07] men gather grapes of thorns or figs of
[42:10] thistles even so every good tree
[42:14] bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt
[42:17] tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good
[42:20] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[42:22] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[42:24] good fruit every tree that bringeth not
[42:27] good fruit is hewn down cast into the
[42:29] fire whereby by their fruits you shall
[42:32] know them not everyone that sending me
[42:35] Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom not
[42:38] the lord lord momo talking not that but
[42:41] watch but he that went the will of my
[42:44] father which is in heaven so he is
[42:47] qualified who gonna enter he is
[42:49] qualified how do you get there
[42:51] not everybody Mali hallelujah glory
[42:52] glory no no no no no he is talking about
[42:54] doing the will of the Father
[42:55] all right many ways here to me in that
[42:59] day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in
[43:01] thy name in thy name have cast out
[43:03] devils and I name done many wonderful
[43:05] works then I will profess unto them I
[43:07] never knew you depart from me ye that
[43:10] work iniquity so then the fine print is
[43:15] getting deeper and deeper as to what God
[43:17] requires of us and this is what you are
[43:19] here for to find out God's requirement
[43:21] for your life
[43:23] isn't that right and therefore Jesus
[43:26] said whosoever heareth these sayings of
[43:30] mine and doeth them I will liken him
[43:33] unto a wise man which built his house
[43:37] upon a rock so this is Jesus all sinking
[43:41] in the teaching mysteries because
[43:44] mysteries was hit as parables he is
[43:46] sinking in now not to talk not to say
[43:49] Lord Lord but they that do the will of
[43:51] my father dinner come into obedience to
[43:54] my word and to my will I will tell you
[43:56] what kind of man that is I'm gonna tell
[43:58] you that Kanaka a woman that is
[43:59] yes he could begin to give this parable
[44:02] who died here at these scenes of mine
[44:04] here it like everybody in the message
[44:06] hearing and do it it I wise man which
[44:11] built his house upon a rock and the rain
[44:14] descended and the floods came and the
[44:16] winds blew and beat upon that house it
[44:19] fell not for it was founded upon a rock
[44:22] and everyone that he already sees of
[44:24] mines do it them not shall be likened
[44:26] unto a foolish man which built his house
[44:28] upon the Sun the rain descended the
[44:30] floods came the winds blew beat upon
[44:32] that house and it fell and great was the
[44:35] fall of it on when came the pass when
[44:38] Jesus ended these scenes the people was
[44:40] punished at his doctrine and he taught
[44:42] them as one having Authority and not as
[44:45] the scribes I want to bring attention to
[44:48] a particular thing here not the house
[44:50] built but the rain that's coming notice
[44:56] he didn't say the house built everybody
[44:58] falls like a nice but that's nothing
[45:01] only the rain will prove what's it built
[45:04] on my rump is a measure called the
[45:08] uncommon storm only the strong will

[59:14] hit them so they throw out and I'm on
[59:15] the right will rise so before they get
[59:17] the Holy Ghost

[1:04:51] somewhere else woman's
[1:05:00] I was not serious there was a general
[1:05:07] spirit of humility manifested in the
[1:05:10] meeting they were taken up with God
[1:05:15] evidently the Lord had found a little
[1:05:17] company at last outside as always
[1:05:20] through whom he could have his way God
[1:05:24] had not chosen an established mission
[1:05:26] where this could be done there they were
[1:05:29] in the hands of men the spirit could not
[1:05:32] work others far more pretensions are
[1:05:35] filled that which man esteems had been
[1:05:38] passed by once more and the spirit was
[1:05:41] born again in a humble stable outside
[1:05:43] the ecclesiastical establishment our
[1:05:46] body must be prepared in repentance and
[1:05:48] humility for every point of the Spirit
[1:05:52] there was no old point of the spirit or
[1:05:54] preparation hallelujah goes on a missus
[1:05:57] of preparation John was sent to prepare
[1:06:00] for the coming of the Lord who shall
[1:06:02] stand when he comes only coming like a

[1:06:08] it oh but he's coming and we was made
[1:06:12] from the common is coming it's right on
[1:06:14] his way he's not right
[1:06:15] Laurie the president will buy
[1:06:19] Pentecostal manifestation did not break
[1:06:22] out in a moment like a huge prairie fire
[1:06:25] and set the world on fire in fact no
[1:06:28] work of God ever appears that way there
[1:06:30] is a necessary time for preparation the
[1:06:33] finished article is not realized at the
[1:06:34] beginning men may wonder where it come
[1:06:37] from not being conscious of the
[1:06:39] preparation but there is always such
[1:06:41] every movement of the Spirit of God must
[1:06:46] also run the gauntlet of the devil's
[1:06:48] forces the dragon stands before bearing
[1:06:51] up the barren mother ready to swallow up
[1:06:53] her child so it was with the present
[1:06:56] Pentecostal work in the beginning the
[1:06:58] enemy did much counterfeiting God kept
[1:07:02] the young child well here for a season
[1:07:04] from the Herod's own tilaka gain
[1:07:06] strength and the slimmin to resist them
[1:07:09] the flame was guarded jealously by the
[1:07:12] hand of the Lord from the winds of
[1:07:13] criticism jealousy unbelief and so on
[1:07:17] it went true about the same experiences
[1:07:20] that all revivals have it falls were
[1:07:23] both inside and out
[1:07:26] both lute and Wesley experienced the
[1:07:28] same difficulties in this time we have
[1:07:31] this treasure in earthen vessels every
[1:07:34] natural business is surrounded by
[1:07:37] circumstances not entirely Pleasant
[1:07:40] God's perfect work is brought about in
[1:07:44] all our work of the Skiba
[1:07:47] every natural billet is surrounded by
[1:07:49] circumstance is not entirely Pleasant
[1:07:51] John Williams everyone spread after
[1:07:54] revival and about died out for the time
[1:07:56] Oh Lord sent us the old revival with all
[1:07:59] the defects and if this cannot be send
[1:08:04] it with all of his defects we must have
[1:08:07] a revival with defects but look it is
[1:08:18] kind of the seventh with the defects we
[1:08:21] must have a revival hallelujah praise
[1:08:24] God Adam Clark said not nature along
[1:08:28] with Satan will always mingle themselves
[1:08:31] as far as they can in the genuine work
[1:08:34] of the spirit in order to discredit and
[1:08:36] destroy it in create revival of religion
[1:08:39] it is almost impossible to prevent
[1:08:42] wildfire from getting among the true
[1:08:44] fire Oh Harlan people would say why fire
[1:08:47] away fire away fire what would you fire
[1:08:51] so then they move from Barnaby Street
[1:08:54] the 312 Azusa Street so the spray began
[1:08:59] to move in Bonnie Brae Street they
[1:09:00] switched the tree twelve Tristan number
[1:09:03] 312 Azusa Street here that resin an old
[1:09:08] frame build and formerly a Methodist
[1:09:10] Church in the center of the city but now
[1:09:13] a long time out of use from Eaton it had
[1:09:15] become a receptacle of all lumber
[1:09:16] plaster other materials
[1:09:19] cleared space enough in the surrounding
[1:09:22] dirt and debris to lay some planks on
[1:09:24] top of empty kneel kegs which seats
[1:09:27] enough for possibly 30 people if I
[1:09:30] remember rightly they were arranged in a
[1:09:33] square facing one another so it was a
[1:09:37] square tire monk was today papers
[1:09:40] rustling I was under tremendous pressure
[1:09:43] to get to the meeting that evening it
[1:09:46] was my first visit Azusa mission Mara
[1:09:48] Wheaton was living with us was going
[1:09:50] with me
[1:09:50] she was so slow that I could hardly read
[1:09:54] fur we finally reached Azusa and found
[1:09:58] about a dozen Saints deer some white
[1:10:00] some black but a CMOS deer in charge the
[1:10:03] act of God moved slowly but surely at
[1:10:06] Azusa it was kinda sure of his own
[1:10:08] appointed priests in the beginning we
[1:10:10] had no new cart in those days the
[1:10:12] priests the colonel a mixed multitude we
[1:10:14] had the devil the fight but the act was
[1:10:16] not drawn by oxen zombies the priests
[1:10:20] were live under God too much preparation
[1:10:22] and prayer discernment was not perfect
[1:10:26] and the enemy got some advantage that
[1:10:30] brought reproach to the work but the
[1:10:32] Saints should learn to take for the
[1:10:35] precious from the vial the combined
[1:10:38] forces of Hell was set determinedly
[1:10:40] against us in the beginning it was not
[1:10:42] all bless him in fact the fight was
[1:10:45] terrific as always the devil combed the
[1:10:48] country for crooked spirits to destroy
[1:10:52] the work if possible devil look for them
[1:10:54] and send them to the judge said no to
[1:10:56] the revival say you have to go dear but
[1:11:01] the fire could not be smothered
[1:11:04] gradually the tide arose and victory
[1:11:07] from a small beginning a very little
[1:11:10] flame was kindled I give a message at my
[1:11:13] first meeting in Azusa two of the same
[1:11:15] smoke and tongue such much blessing
[1:11:17] seemed to telle utterance it was soon
[1:11:19] noise abroad at quarters working at
[1:11:21] Azusa and all kind of people begin to
[1:11:23] come to the meetings many were curious
[1:11:25] and unbelieving others were hungry for
[1:11:27] God the newspapers began to ridicule
[1:11:30] booster mittens thus giving us free
[1:11:32] advertising this brought the crowds the
[1:11:37] devil overdid himself again oh my my my
[1:11:42] my my my hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:46] Old Glory Navarre can any good thing
[1:11:49] come on Nazareth
[1:11:50] Oh glory to God hallelujah can any good
[1:11:53] thing come aboard a seventh under pride
[1:11:55] that one time insider dear yes a real
[1:11:59] revival on seventh on the Reviver Holy
[1:12:03] Ghost revival Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:12:07] the devil within themselves outside
[1:12:10] persecution never heard the work we had
[1:12:13] the most fear from the working of evil
[1:12:15] spirits written even spiritualists
[1:12:18] hypnotic scheme to investigate and to
[1:12:21] try to influence then all you really
[1:12:24] just saw his crooks cranks came seeking
[1:12:28] a place in the work
[1:12:32] remember in Port I see give me that
[1:12:36] power that poor lad that we could do
[1:12:38] that do come o devil in the name of
[1:12:40] Jesus a Paul preached it so this is no
[1:12:45] new thing them looking for power without
[1:12:47] looking for power they're not authorized
[1:12:50] to have so watch we had the most affair
[1:12:54] from these but this is always the danger
[1:12:56] to every new work they had no place else
[1:12:58] where this condition casts off a over
[1:13:01] many that was hot overcome it hindered
[1:13:03] the spirit much many were afraid to seek
[1:13:06] God for fear that there might get them
[1:13:08] then came the earthquake San Francisco
[1:13:11] it week because surely the voice of God
[1:13:14] to the people on the Pacific coast so
[1:13:16] God had everything line up you know they
[1:13:18] are knowing the people the earthquake it
[1:13:20] that does take at the next level all
[1:13:22] together it was used mightily in
[1:13:25] conviction for the revival the Lord
[1:13:27] graciously brought afterwards in the
[1:13:28] earliest days both heaven and hell
[1:13:30] seemed to have come to town
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:34] this is serious men were at the breaking
[1:13:39] point conviction was nicely on the
[1:13:43] people they would fly to pieces in on
[1:13:46] the street with or provocation a very
[1:13:50] bloodlines ended up in drawn aromas
[1:13:51] loser mission by the spirit when men
[1:13:53] came within two blocks of the space they
[1:13:56] were seized with conviction the work was
[1:14:01] getting is now
[1:14:10] the work was getting clearer and
[1:14:12] stronger at Azusa Gordon's wicked mind
[1:14:15] to me it seems that everyone had to go
[1:14:17] to Sousa missionaries were gathered from
[1:14:19] Africa India the islands of the sea
[1:14:21] preachers and workers across the
[1:14:23] continent will come from distant land
[1:14:25] with an irresistible drawing to Los
[1:14:27] Angeles gadhimai scenes together they
[1:14:29] had come before Pentecost door did
[1:14:31] little realize that it was God's call
[1:14:34] holiness meetings tents missions began
[1:14:37] to close up for lack of attendance their
[1:14:39] people were at Azusa brother-and-sister
[1:14:41] gar closed the burning bush wall came to
[1:14:44] Zuza
[1:14:44] we see the baptism of the spirit and was
[1:14:46] soon on their way to India to spread the
[1:14:48] fire even but there was much possible
[1:14:51] there was there was much persecution
[1:14:53] especially from the press the route is
[1:14:56] up shamefully but this only drew the
[1:14:58] crows give the work six months to live
[1:15:00] soon the middle running day and night
[1:15:02] the place was packed out nightly the
[1:15:04] whole building upstairs and down had not
[1:15:07] been cleared and put into use there were
[1:15:09] far more white people and black people
[1:15:10] coming the color line was washed away in
[1:15:12] the blood of Jesus Christ he said a as
[1:15:18] far as our translators of the New
[1:15:19] Testament declared there's loser work
[1:15:20] had rediscovered the blood of Christ to
[1:15:23] the church at the time great emphasis
[1:15:24] was placed on Christ's blood for
[1:15:26] cleansing and more a high standard was
[1:15:29] held up for a clean life oh my and that
[1:15:33] has a return a high standard for a clean
[1:15:36] life a consecrated life is a holy life a
[1:15:39] dedicated life isn't that right divine
[1:15:42] love was wonderfully manifest in the
[1:15:44] meetings the people was not even Malo an
[1:15:47] unkind word said against the apostles of
[1:15:49] the judges for the judges the message
[1:15:52] was a love of God it was a sort of first
[1:15:54] love of the early church return the
[1:15:57] baptism of the holy spirit as we receive
[1:15:59] it in the beginning did not allow us to
[1:16:01] think speak or hear evil of any man this
[1:16:05] spirit is very sensitive
[1:16:06] tender as a dove the Holy Spirit
[1:16:08] symbolizes a dove
[1:16:09] we knew the moment we had grieved the
[1:16:11] spirit by an unkind thought a word we
[1:16:14] seem to live in a sea of pure divine
[1:16:16] love the Lord for our battles for us in
[1:16:19] those days we
[1:16:21] were committed to his judgement fully in
[1:16:23] all matters and never seeking in the
[1:16:25] defender work of ourselves we live in
[1:16:27] this wonderful immediate presence are
[1:16:31] you getting the picture of what we had
[1:16:32] backed it we live in this wonderful amid
[1:16:35] presence and nothing contrary it is your
[1:16:38] spirit was a low dear the force was
[1:16:40] sifted out from the real by the Spirit
[1:16:43] of God the Word of God itself decidedly
[1:16:46] absolutely look like this the Word of
[1:16:49] God itself decided absolutely all issues
[1:16:55] and we have to come right back to that
[1:16:57] well all issues accepted by the Word of
[1:16:59] God no matter how you feel and all your
[1:17:02] teeth I would his brother say and I once
[1:17:04] seen I'm no no no by the way what it
[1:17:06] would say hallelujah the hearts of the
[1:17:10] people bowed in act and motive was
[1:17:13] searched to the very bottom love that
[1:17:16] let me read it again the hats of the
[1:17:19] people watch boot in act and motive was
[1:17:25] searched to the very bottom it was no
[1:17:27] joke
[1:17:28] to become one of that company no man is
[1:17:31] joined unto them it was no joke unless
[1:17:34] they meant business it mean a dying out
[1:17:37] and cleanup process in those days to
[1:17:41] receive the baptism it was a little more
[1:17:44] than going to church no it was a little
[1:17:46] more than that that occupying up you it
[1:17:48] was a little more than that it was
[1:17:49] people come with a baptism of the Holy
[1:17:51] Ghost people coming to be sealed people
[1:17:54] coming with a Mac of God oh can we give

[1:18:06] Spirit baptism
[1:18:06] though many got it in the main assembly
[1:18:08] room also in fact they often got it in
[1:18:11] their seats in those days the Spirit
[1:18:14] worked very deeply in the tiring room
[1:18:15] and unquiet spirit or thoughtless talker
[1:18:19] was immediately reproved by the spirit
[1:18:23] that mean the spirit arresting people
[1:18:25] yeah cuz I'm talking talking talking no
[1:18:27] is a different actress altogether you

[1:18:43] white boot unless they have been
[1:18:45] thoroughly subdued and built out that

[1:19:27] atmosphere that he fights only battles
[1:19:29] that herself this is brother Branham you

[1:24:18] and horrible thing is is to come the
[1:24:20] past in the land no ok I'm skipping
[1:24:23] something up this is a scripture a
[1:24:25] wonderful and horrible thing has come to
[1:24:26] pass in a land the prophets prophesied
[1:24:28] falsely and the priests they rule by
[1:24:30] their means and my people love to have
[1:24:32] it so and what will be the Ender of that
[1:24:35] jeremiah after my people children are

[1:25:14] wonderful in that all building with his
[1:25:17] low rafters and their floors God took
[1:25:18] strong men and women to pieces and put
[1:25:21] them together again for his glory

[1:28:28] hurried by a call for popcorn
[1:28:30] we had no prearranged program to be
[1:28:33] jumped to the time our time was the
[1:28:36] Lord's we had real testimony some fresh

[1:28:46] God we didn't have to get a cue from
[1:28:49] from our leader we were free from
[1:28:52] lawlessness we were shut up to God and
[1:28:54] prayer in the meetings of our mind on
[1:28:56] him all obeyed God in meekness and
[1:28:59] humility in honor we preferred one
[1:29:01] another the Lord was liable to bush to

[1:29:31] put himself forward with Auto real
[1:29:32] anointed I think that word reading again
[1:29:36] I think that word reading again

[1:40:34] but we infer tremendous time in the Lord
[1:40:37] oh praise God for a banner from Susie's
[1:40:42] design he says no a mystery scripture a
[1:40:45] previously hidden truth no divinely
[1:40:49] revealed but supernatural elements to
[1:40:52] remain despite the revelation a
[1:40:54] scripture a mystery scripture is not
[1:40:57] right a previously hidden truth now they
[1:41:01] finally reveal it means revealed by the
[1:41:04] spirit somebody who has since area
[1:41:06] twenty years and God reveal himself to
[1:41:08] them and you can't stop that that is
[1:41:11] flesh and blood hath not revealed it to
[1:41:12] you so I could preach but it's a good
[1:41:15] spirit to reveal it to you that's why
[1:41:17] you have to come in the Spirit because
[1:41:18] the spirit can then reveal it to you and
[1:41:19] that's the rock that you build this
[1:41:22] church on that's the rock the devil
[1:41:24] can't touch
[1:41:25] that's ankle in your soul that every
[1:41:27] time gaudiya because it's a word to
[1:41:29] resume the cross and intents of the
[1:41:30] heart
[1:41:30] so when God drop that in your soul
[1:41:32] delicate touch that you can't go behind
[1:41:35] there he have no resentment of or behind
[1:41:37] you he is not the word so no your flesh
[1:41:40] me after your festival field is a rough
[1:41:43] that God put inside of you a seed inside
[1:41:46] of you but he's ready to open fire
[1:41:49] is my fire that's he gonna come alive I
[1:41:53] gonna manifest what's inside you
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:42:01] listen Peter was Jesus here oh you know
[1:42:05] he was a son of God and he was a show
[1:42:07] later the devil Seema's are miserable
[1:42:09] this and miserable that and Jesus said
[1:42:11] let I prayed for you then everyone the
[1:42:12] city like wheat but I prayed for you
[1:42:15] what for what for that your faith fail
[1:42:17] not because your feet feel everything
[1:42:19] fall down you know a Christian life is
[1:42:21] based upon fate my feet are coming this
[1:42:23] morning
[1:42:23] I know this is not an easy message but
[1:42:25] I've got to preach it because that is
[1:42:27] what he gave me to preach and I don't
[1:42:29] question what I'm given I don't preach
[1:42:31] what I see like that entice your ears
[1:42:32] these are things I need to know it's not
[1:42:35] easy to preach the standard gospel but
[1:42:36] this is what you need to know because
[1:42:38] this will help you to grow to understand
[1:42:40] when we kept in a spot listen when we
[1:42:42] finish the devil not even a picture let
[1:42:48] me say return when we are finished you
[1:42:51] will see the devil not even in a picture
[1:42:56] it's just a Potter and the clay
[1:43:03] and if you're gonna remain if you're
[1:43:06] gonna submit yourself and surrenders it
[1:43:07] yourself yourself to his molded alright
[1:43:10] but a branagh he said no I know my is
[1:43:15] okay no Elijah will not be a system it
[1:43:18] will be a man he'll be a one man
[1:43:20] anointed of the Holy Ghost and he won't
[1:43:23] introduce any tree or four gods he will
[1:43:25] introduce one the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:26] cause his message will shake the
[1:43:28] Pentecostal children back to the feet of
[1:43:30] the fans again so this is the message of
[1:43:32] Malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to the
[1:43:36] feet of other fathers again according to
[1:43:38] Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the
[1:43:40] faith which was once delivered to the
[1:43:42] Saints bring them back to the faith of
[1:43:44] the fathers the Pentecostal part in the
[1:43:47] restoration time let me take that slowly
[1:43:51] let's take a surely to bring them back
[1:43:53] to the feet here we go
[1:43:55] the Pentecostal part in the restoration
[1:43:57] time oh yeah people are books and tapes
[1:44:00] but where is the Pentecostal part yes
[1:44:02] you save my life where and restore and
[1:44:04] restore me where is the Pentecostal part
[1:44:06] because that will happen on the day of
[1:44:07] Pentecost
[1:44:09] and the whole ethos has to be made real
[1:44:12] to the people again
[1:44:16] that's my people not sinking the holy
[1:44:18] bus is no longer real but it's gonna
[1:44:20] become real again oh there's a real Holy
[1:44:25] Ghost there's a real baptism there's a
[1:44:27] real power there's a real presence
[1:44:30] there's a real transformation
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:35] I think I what that would mean again
[1:44:37] bring them back the fate of the fathers
[1:44:40] the Pentecostal part in the restoration
[1:44:44] time I will restore share the Lord the
[1:44:48] real event endtime evangelism oh praise

[1:53:50] into the wilderness to be tested to be
[1:53:53] tempted and when we come into the
[1:53:56] adoption time and that's what we had
[1:53:58] before now it's time to come into the
[1:54:00] place of trying before Jesus had this
[1:54:03] big display of power here also overcome

[1:56:13] power nothing at all just talk but the
[1:56:17] rains are coming the storms are coming
[1:56:24] not to your common I am a hook
[1:56:30] hi I'm nada try what come and I try what
[1:56:33] I'm doing
[1:56:34] God trying every man's work we not
[1:56:37] escaping you know every man's work I
[1:56:39] remember his intelligence long time to
[1:56:40] ask God for revelation to fellowship
[1:56:42] here we come and child intestine come
[1:56:44] yet now you know why I hear so must
[1:56:59] comment to that please stop trying now
[1:57:01] first beat the tree to the seven blessed
[1:57:04] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:57:05] Christ which has according to the
[1:57:07] abundant mercy has begotten us and a
[1:57:09] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[1:57:11] Christ from the dead I love this to an
[1:57:14] inheritance incorruptible undefiled feed
[1:57:16] them at away reserved in heaven from you
[1:57:19] give it a whole hog the whole story it's
[1:57:22] resolved it's uncomfortable is there for
[1:57:24] you it's not right to inheritance
[1:57:28] incorruptible undefiled FINA with
[1:57:30] reasonable you who are kept by the power
[1:57:32] of God through faith on the salvation
[1:57:35] ready to reveal the last time wherein
[1:57:38] you greatly rejoice don't know for
[1:57:41] seasoned if need be ye are in heaviness
[1:57:44] to money for temptations that you go the
[1:57:49] trial of your faith being more precious
[1:57:51] than gold perish it don't be tried with
[1:57:55] fire might be form on the prison honor
[1:57:57] and glory at the appearing of Jesus
[1:57:59] Christ so God doesn't want the product
[1:58:02] that is untried his products are tried
[1:58:06] his sons are tried his daughters are
[1:58:09] tried isn't that right but when God
[1:58:11] finished with him it's approved
[1:58:13] that's why Balram says what we need is
[1:58:15] tells of lived voices that's the ton of
[1:58:18] ships that it lived already it
[1:58:20] overcoming polish and machination
[1:58:22] Columba it lived already God wanted
[1:58:25] qualified voices alive that's the
[1:58:28] tumbler that shakes the dead metal coat
[1:58:31] quote he's not gonna shake the devil
[1:58:34] hallelujah let's talk about another
[1:58:37] brother Isaiah he was leaning upon King
[1:58:41] Uzziah king uzziah died because he
[1:58:43] thought because the king he could play
[1:58:45] priests and the king went and cited duty
[1:58:49] priest work and got judged leprosy
[1:58:52] struck him right there and he died that
[1:58:54] shook up eyes as I early to the temple
[1:58:57] now and God began to show him something
[1:58:59] he said I saw stood seraphim's
[1:59:02] he saw the Lord High and lifted up the
[1:59:04] tree and filled the temple buffets to
[1:59:06] the seraphim's each one had six wings
[1:59:07] with twin he covered his face between
[1:59:09] covered his feet to tweening it fly I
[1:59:11] won crichton's another I said holy holy
[1:59:13] Lord God Almighty the law is a lot of
[1:59:15] hosts the whole earth is full of that
[1:59:16] glory and the post of the door was moved
[1:59:18] by the voice of him that cried and the
[1:59:20] house was filled with smoke
[1:59:21] then said I war is me I'm undone because
[1:59:24] I am a man of unclean lips now this is
[1:59:27] important because he's a prophet he
[1:59:29] speaks a god but then in this presence
[1:59:31] there's a behavior that came upon his
[1:59:33] life death upon him a vision broke upon
[1:59:37] him and a transforming porch again
[1:59:38] completely and then he says now watch
[1:59:40] boys me from undone a man of unclean
[1:59:43] lips and I dwell in the midst of a
[1:59:44] people of unclean lips for my eyes have
[1:59:45] seen the king the Lord of hosts then
[1:59:47] flew one of the seraphim's
[1:59:49] unto me having a life : is on which are
[1:59:51] taken with the tongue some of the altar
[1:59:53] Wow leave it upon my mount and said lo
[1:59:57] this had touched her lips the iniquity
[1:59:59] is taken away by sin purged I heard the
[2:00:02] voice of the Lord saying whom shall I
[2:00:03] send
[2:00:04] who will go for us then I said I here am
[2:00:06] I send me
[2:00:08] unlisted border Branham he said a
[2:00:10] prophet had been leading upon the
[2:00:12] kingdom and when he followed that
[2:00:14] something taken place no matter how much
[2:00:16] a man it has been blessed
[2:00:17] yet when go when he steps across that
[2:00:19] boundary line between error and truth
[2:00:21] God calls his hand then I saw I went to
[2:00:26] the temple fell on his knees no doubt
[2:00:28] yes he said he felt on their bloody all
[2:00:30] turning in the crowd and as he cried God
[2:00:32] came in a vision and he saw the angels
[2:00:35] he said I saw God lifted up
[2:00:37] God was lifted to a place that man
[2:00:41] cannot come then he become influenced in
[2:00:43] another way
[2:00:43] he saw God lifted up highway up his
[2:00:46] trainee look and the pillars began to
[2:00:48] move in the shape of the voice he never
[2:00:51] saw that Isaiah he saw what a modern man
[2:00:54] can feel oh yes I saw he saw that a
[2:00:58] mortal man can feel for no matter how
[2:01:03] much is bliss and that is why a shame
[2:01:07] for ministers to deceive the people by
[2:01:10] putting everything upon the people about
[2:01:12] them
[2:01:12] that has got to be them that's a shame
[2:01:17] because a man because how blessings can
[2:01:19] fall ten percent say you know you do
[2:01:26] believe that but I what I just said I
[2:01:29] didn't say the Prophet said it I read it
[2:01:33] again in case you really understand what
[2:01:35] I seen he saw that mortal man can fall
[2:01:39] no matter how much he is blessed he can
[2:01:46] still fall one so then he get a look at
[2:01:51] one that can fall whose foundations are
[2:01:53] sure the vision of the temple so God
[2:01:56] lifted up go be lifted up isn't that
[2:01:58] right he said no watch
[2:02:00] Isaiah seen that the king soon as he got
[2:02:02] out of his calling God smote him with
[2:02:04] leprosy then I thought what must I do
[2:02:07] whose ayah was dead he had leaned heavy
[2:02:09] on his arm he thought he was gone what
[2:02:11] would he do life itself was gone from
[2:02:12] him nearly so what did the young prophet
[2:02:14] do he made his way down to the temple
[2:02:16] and pray he fell longer the old and he
[2:02:17] cried out sometimes
[2:02:19] God let the very props be not from under
[2:02:21] us sometimes he lets sickness strike us
[2:02:24] he let sickness Stryker's he lets
[2:02:28] disappointments Haddix
[2:02:30] strike us be sorry a minute later be a
[2:02:37] trauma devil we talk about God he
[2:02:42] so he using endeavor to accomplish his
[2:02:44] purpose because he want to get something
[2:02:47] out to you sometime you don't even know
[2:02:49] it's inside of you but he's got to get
[2:02:52] it out because he want to make you a
[2:02:54] vessel of Honor he wants you to be
[2:02:58] purged and portugal only come to a
[2:03:01] process sometimes he does that to get
[2:03:07] you where you would be influenced by the
[2:03:09] gospel be wise enough to catch it don't
[2:03:11] be stupid enough to walk away from it
[2:03:13] Isaiah noted that he must find something
[2:03:16] different what did he do he went to the
[2:03:18] temple he saw God on the throne lifted
[2:03:21] way up he saw the seraphim's here we
[2:03:23] gonna get onto this a little bit
[2:03:24] Seraphim mean burners the surfing means
[2:03:29] which it's next to the altar actually
[2:03:32] the seraphim's is the one who receives
[2:03:35] the sacrifice and cleanses the worshiper
[2:03:39] and then presents them to God so when
[2:03:44] they come to worship that fire presence
[2:03:47] call some of the altar coming around you
[2:03:50] to prepare you to approach God you'll
[2:03:55] just come to God there must be a way me
[2:03:57] to approach God when the pillar of fire
[2:03:59] came alongside I go tell Moses or put on
[2:04:02] sticks and tell the people don't let the
[2:04:03] animal pass there it got to be killed
[2:04:06] don't cross that mark hallelujah mum can
[2:04:10] become holy because the holy God is on
[2:04:11] the mountain wherever God is it comes
[2:04:14] holy and you are a temple of the Holy
[2:04:17] Ghost
[2:04:17] [Applause]
[2:04:21] hallelujah you are more than just an
[2:04:24] ordinary person walking God say you are
[2:04:26] the temple you are the house they're
[2:04:29] going to keep going
[2:04:31] reppin the whole squad you are very
[2:04:34] important to God for we are something
[2:04:38] else then you can look to do your own
[2:04:41] thing you've got to get your life
[2:04:43] confronted his will sauce cleanses the
[2:04:52] worshiper then presents him to gold dis
[2:04:55] seraphim's are angelic beings they are a
[2:04:58] very one next to God right at the altar
[2:05:00] they receive the sacrifice
[2:05:02] it shows the justice of God that sin
[2:05:05] cannot come in his presence until it's
[2:05:08] be atoned and these seven serums
[2:05:11] remember in the seven churches they
[2:05:13] guarded the Gospels one on either side
[2:05:15] they were in the Garden of Eden with the
[2:05:17] Flaming Sword got in the altar so when
[2:05:21] God tell him oh I'll even and God tell
[2:05:23] her serums to protect that tree less he
[2:05:25] called with his polluted life and have
[2:05:27] eternal life
[2:05:28] and he serves it with God in the tree
[2:05:30] known as Sarah I'm trying to get you
[2:05:31] back to that tree
[2:05:32] oh my hallelujah Oh glory
[2:05:36] like Uzziah trying to usurp the place of
[2:05:39] an anointed office because he was a big
[2:05:41] fellow among boss people they are no big
[2:05:44] fellows fivefold they're the massive
[2:05:52] real big boss people there's no big
[2:05:56] fellows we are all children of God God
[2:05:59] give us one of us wanting to do and
[2:06:02] another thing to do so you are just as
[2:06:06] important as the minister
[2:06:13] what a little thing for you to do and
[2:06:15] that's very important in the kingdom of
[2:06:17] God just as important remember Jesus or
[2:06:24] the ooh on the wine ran up and they came
[2:06:28] to Jesus honey
[2:06:29] and he said what I had to do with that
[2:06:30] and they said whatever he said do it

[2:06:36] water pass on draw the water

[2:34:16] deeper now to become temples of the
[2:34:19] Living God God was there to meet us and
[2:34:23] that's what an ass is a fire it didn't
[2:34:25] understand they taught that with the
[2:34:27] same we're a pizza that was a semo's but
[2:34:31] that was a different man why I was upon
[2:34:33] that throne God wasn't tough that wrong
[2:34:36] listen my god hallelujah and the
[2:34:39] promising will repeat again let me
[2:34:42] qualify you know okay my very finest
[2:34:46] fire unless we suffer with him
[2:34:49] we cannot reign with him you have to
[2:34:52] suffer terrain the reason for this is
[2:34:54] character simply is never made without
[2:34:58] suffering
[2:34:59] character is a give it to another gift
[2:35:02] that's why blessings have become Chris I
[2:35:06] think somebody England yet acting like
[2:35:08] some girl she will need luck to eat 17
[2:35:11] and she want to shoot him and say they
[2:35:13] shouldn't allow anybody to win it on
[2:35:14] 8:17
[2:35:16] because I'm her life has been messed up
[2:35:18] by all this money was too much of money
[2:35:20] and she did all this to herself she by
[2:35:22] how's this no she's broke
[2:35:24] she messed up she have no life she's
[2:35:26] frustrated she said she never said I
[2:35:28] wanted to begin with she's suing them
[2:35:39] most of them might win this lottery must
[2:35:41] blow it out in two years Daniel they
[2:35:44] don't know how to make it
[2:35:45] it hit them under the blue it character
[2:35:49] is a victory not a gift and character is
[2:35:54] simply never made without suffering so
[2:35:59] all of you who don't want suffering I
[2:36:01] don't wanna pain and yeah you know I
[2:36:02] mean it
[2:36:03] sporting a chair and you spoiling your
[2:36:04] wife you spoil your husband is what
[2:36:06] everybody could spoil all I could tell
[2:36:08] you is a gonna spoil children so you
[2:36:11] really spoiled him but when go ahead to
[2:36:12] be with you he not spoiling you he will
[2:36:15] coach you the process like Noah like
[2:36:17] Moses like Abraham he never spoils none
[2:36:19] of them he's tricked them all he correct
[2:36:21] them
[2:36:21] Jacob every one of them you know their
[2:36:23] sons too
[2:36:26] but all of them came to the grinder and
[2:36:28] they came out right don't give up
[2:36:33] everybody
[2:36:34] don't write anybody off when that vessel
[2:36:38] was mad in the Potters hand he
[2:36:40] repurposed it he reset it here we
[2:36:43] channeled it he can uh try the where
[2:36:46] he's gonna dump it but he choose to holy
[2:36:48] oh boy get a place inside of here
[2:36:53] [Applause]
[2:36:59] character is a victory not a gift
[2:37:03] a man without character cannot read
[2:37:05] because power
[2:37:06] apart from karate satanic but power
[2:37:09] character is fit to rule and since he
[2:37:11] want to share his throne on the same
[2:37:13] basis he overcame and sat down that is
[2:37:15] Farah strong then we have to overcome to
[2:37:17] sit with him and a little temporary
[2:37:20] suffering we go to now is not worthy to
[2:37:22] be compared to the tremendous glory that
[2:37:25] will be revealed in us when he comes
[2:37:27] what treasure is later for those who are
[2:37:30] willing to enter in his in them and just
[2:37:32] end up with much tribulation will give
[2:37:34] him a shout hallelujah hallelujah
[2:37:39] hallelujah take it not strange
[2:37:42] concerning the fiery trials that is a
[2:37:43] trial what God wants us develop is a
[2:37:47] christ-like character that comes to
[2:37:49] suffering he said we all have trials we
[2:37:53] have all have tried and chasing our sons
[2:37:54] but not one goes true that the church
[2:37:56] that is not suffering is not being tried
[2:37:58] the church that is not suffering and is
[2:38:02] not being tried isn't of God I think
[2:38:09] I've seen it again the church that is
[2:38:12] not suffering and is not being tried
[2:38:14] isn't of God for whom the Lord loveth he
[2:38:18] whose 12-6 each easement and scourgeth
[2:38:22] every son whom he receiveth
[2:38:24] if you're an ultra easement where all
[2:38:27] are partakers then your buses are not
[2:38:28] sons
[2:38:29] there is no special condition in Smyrna
[2:38:32] this special division Smyrna must be
[2:38:34] applied to every age there is no age
[2:38:36] free from it there is no true believer
[2:38:38] free from it this is of God this is the
[2:38:41] will of God it is needful we need the
[2:38:44] Lord to teach us the truth that we are
[2:38:47] to suffer and the Christ I can do in it
[2:38:51] when you on the phone gossiping on
[2:38:54] telling people what we're going through
[2:38:55] how we're going to our waiter weren't
[2:38:56] you
[2:38:56] that is not suffering like rice that is
[2:39:00] you looking for sympathizers and you're
[2:39:02] part of worry in your pity party I said

[2:40:03] something here the cloudy skies and
[2:40:05] storms of life and no signs of God's
[2:40:07] approval neither are the bright skies
[2:40:10] and still waters signs of his love and
[2:40:13] approval his approval of any of us

[2:45:53] who shall have an idea of his coming
[2:45:56] who shall stand when he appeared for
[2:45:58] he's like a refiners fire like a full of
[2:46:00] soup he shall sit as a refiner and
[2:46:02] purifier of silver he shall purify the
[2:46:05] sons of Levi and purge them as gold and
[2:46:08] silver that they may offer unto the Lord
[2:46:10] and offering in righteousness and this
[2:46:13] is a story there was a group of woman in
[2:46:16] Bible study on the book of Malachi as
[2:46:19] they were studying chapter tree they
[2:46:21] came across these verse tree that he was
[2:46:23] sit as a refiner and purifier of silver
[2:46:26] this verse posited a woman and they
[2:46:29] wondered what the statement meant about
[2:46:30] the character and nature of God one of
[2:46:33] the woman offered to find out the
[2:46:34] process of refining silver and get back
[2:46:37] to the group at the next Bible study
[2:46:39] that week this woman quorum a
[2:46:42] silversmith and make an appointment to
[2:46:44] watch him at work she didn't mention
[2:46:47] anything about the reason for interest
[2:46:49] beyond a curiosity about the process of
[2:46:51] refining silver
[2:46:52] as she watched the silversmith he held a
[2:46:54] piece of silver over the fire and let it
[2:46:57] heat up
[2:46:57] he explained that in refining silver one
[2:47:01] needed to hold the silver in the middle
[2:47:02] of the fire where the flames are the
[2:47:04] hottest asked to burn away all the
[2:47:07] impurities the woman thought about God
[2:47:09] hold us in such a hot spot then she
[2:47:11] thought again about the verse he sits as
[2:47:13] a refiner and purifier of silver she
[2:47:17] asked a silversmith if it was true he
[2:47:20] had to sit down from the fire the whole
[2:47:21] time the silver is being refined the man
[2:47:25] answered and said yes he not only had to
[2:47:27] sit there holding the silver we had to
[2:47:29] keep his eyes on the silver the entire
[2:47:31] time it was in the fire if the silver
[2:47:35] was left a moment too long in the flames
[2:47:37] it would be destroyed he shall sit as a
