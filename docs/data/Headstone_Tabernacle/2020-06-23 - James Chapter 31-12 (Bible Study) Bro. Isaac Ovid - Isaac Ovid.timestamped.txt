[9:44] all that you help us get a deeper
[9:45] understanding of who you are and Lord
[9:48] how we are supposed to behave ourselves
[9:50] how we are supposed to conduct ourselves
[9:52] how we are supposed to live Lord and
[9:56] father true the impact of the word our
[9:59] conduct on our behavior should reflect
[10:02] something different from the world it
[10:04] cannot be that low we are called to this
[10:07] great mystery of perfection and
[10:09] redemption and adoption and Lord our
[10:11] behaviors are not changing help us
[10:13] tonight to grow grow in grace grew in

[10:24] Lord walk into every home right now Lord
[10:29] and bring peace and comfort
[10:30] Lord Lord that your presence would bring
[10:33] father Lord the Prophet would stand
[10:35] there say I'm you know what I'm waiting
[10:36] for you Lord and he was with
[10:39] for the angel of the Lord to make
[10:41] himself known among them Lord me you
[10:43] make yourself known among us tonight
[10:45] Lord take me out of the way Lord may you
[10:48] speak lip to ear to your sons on your
[10:50] daughters tonight Lord and father Lord I
[10:54] don't want my thoughts to be projected
[10:56] but may you take on peak control Lord
[10:58] and minister to your sons on your
[11:00] daughters if there's a backslider in
[11:02] here tonight someone father who Lord may
[11:05] be struggling in some way father Lord me
[11:08] pride be destroyed father Lord that Lord
[11:12] these words would have a deep impact on
[11:14] us Lord we would Lord want to change we
[11:16] would want to be transformed may you
[11:18] bless Lord the world as we approach the
[11:20] world and they study tonight in the
[11:23] precious name of Jesus Christ amen and
[11:25] amen amen
[11:26] well it's certainly a great privilege to
[11:29] be here tonight and kind of continue in
[11:34] this vein of having the Bible studies we
[11:38] really found God to have allowed us to
[11:41] be able to reopen services and to see
[11:46] that now we could have Sunday service
[11:48] and still continue this Bible study on a
[11:51] Tuesday as you will referred this
[11:54] Wednesday tomorrow is our last streaming
[11:57] Wednesday from next week Wednesday we'll
[11:59] be back in church as well and on Friday
[12:02] we will have our prayer meetings and I
[12:04] believe that it is very important for us
[12:08] to continue to understand that church is
[12:12] a means to an end it is not the end this
[12:17] whole plan of redemption this whole book
[12:21] that we read this whole mystery of God
[12:25] is about establishing relationship it is
[12:28] about re-establishing that connection
[12:30] that Gore would have with man and we
[12:34] cannot lose the focus of that
[12:38] relationship that God wants to have with
[12:41] us and God is his word he is also spirit
[12:45] and you find out the more you get into
[12:48] contact with this word it's the more
[12:51] that your
[12:53] exceptional gene you know I was in a
[12:55] conversation yesterday and I was hearing
[12:58] some statistics you know some study was
[13:00] done about people who read their Bibles
[13:04] and and the impact of change and it was
[13:08] really found that people who struggled
[13:10] with different things and they did some
[13:12] surveys and they did some testing and
[13:13] different thing and they found that
[13:14] people who struggle with different
[13:16] things that when they read their Bibles
[13:18] three times a week there was very little
[13:22] change in their behavior but those who
[13:24] read their Bibles for four and more
[13:27] times a week
[13:28] there was a change in behavior you know
[13:31] and I have said it before it takes 21
[13:35] days for a habit to change if you do
[13:38] something two days doesn't bring a
[13:41] change or a change that will resonate
[13:43] but after you do 21 days of a certain
[13:47] thing a new way of behavior forms you
[13:51] know and us trying to sort of speak 10x
[13:55] or do morning I've done before in our
[13:57] daily walk it's a bring forth a change
[13:59] in our lives not just a change in
[14:01] information you know and and I was
[14:04] sharing with some brothers I was in our
[14:06] fellowship last time with some some very
[14:08] good friends and we were talking about
[14:09] it we learn different things and and
[14:11] what resonated with me is that a lot of
[14:13] believers have information they have
[14:15] different courts on different scriptures
[14:18] but that has to translate itself into a
[14:21] change of your life you know so a lot of
[14:24] people grow in knowledge you know they
[14:26] know a message but your behavior change
[14:29] and that is what the dilemmas test of
[14:33] making it to the rapture become better
[14:35] balance it only political of to get you
[14:36] over there that protocol of is not
[14:38] information that is your whole nature
[14:40] what your whole appetite everything has
[14:42] to change you know so our conditioning
[14:45] on our approach that you would is such
[14:48] that it is supposed to bring that change
[14:50] in behavior you know and I said
[14:53] something last Sunday closer to the end
[14:56] of the service because it really
[14:57] impacted me you know sometimes we go
[15:00] over things in Scripture or you would
[15:02] and for some people it is simple there
[15:04] like a baby thing why why we go
[15:07] I knew that already and for others it
[15:09] may be new to them because we are all at
[15:12] different stages you know and I was
[15:14] having a conversation with someone and I
[15:15] said I'm and I hinted it last Sunday
[15:18] that Jesus at age 12 knew more about
[15:21] scripture and you would and anybody else
[15:24] in fact when Mary and Joseph left him in
[15:27] the temple he was confounded he scribes
[15:30] and priests and all of them and when
[15:32] they came back he said I must be about
[15:33] my father's business then we have the 18
[15:35] year of silence where there's nothing
[15:39] said about him but when Jesus goes into
[15:41] the temple after coming from the tree
[15:44] while attacks in the wilderness the
[15:46] Bible says as was his custom so he was
[15:50] in the temple as was his custom when he
[15:52] went and read the Spirit of the Lord is
[15:54] upon me and so the reality is for 18
[15:57] years Jesus you would be written would
[16:00] he would made flesh was sitting down in
[16:02] the temple listening to people who had a
[16:05] fraction of the understanding that he
[16:07] had so I want to encourage you tonight I
[16:10] have a fraction of the knowledge that
[16:13] some of us may have so I still want to
[16:15] encourage you this food in here for
[16:18] everybody you know because if Jesus can
[16:20] sit down and listen to different people
[16:23] come and take scriptures and I said it
[16:24] you know I see where guys know what I
[16:26] meant you know but he's there sitting
[16:27] quiet because it's time to speak was not
[16:30] yet so you get out of it what you expect
[16:34] so I want you to set your expectations
[16:36] very high every time you come into
[16:39] encounter with you would set your
[16:42] expectations very high and don't look
[16:45] for what it could do for somebody else
[16:47] that is wonderful but look into the word
[16:50] for how it can help your life because as
[16:54] you board a plane it's a LIF something
[16:55] go wrong Andy Andy gas masks fall for
[16:58] oxygen put on your mask first before
[17:00] trying to help somebody else so there's
[17:02] a balance with that friends you want to
[17:04] amiko or calling and election sure so I
[17:07] have a very simple teaching tonight that
[17:12] we want to look at and we want to begin
[17:14] the book of James I would have read from
[17:17] James for on Sunday but
[17:21] want to spend time and if I want to
[17:23] title this is a study of genes 3 verses
[17:27] 1 to 12 we're gonna study James 3 verses
[17:31] 1 to 12 and we'll take our time because
[17:34] that's why we do a Bible study we take
[17:36] our time and then I have a few quotes
[17:37] from the Prophet as well to kind of
[17:39] bring this into perspective because we
[17:41] know that we all know that we only sees
[17:43] in the age of adoption an adoption
[17:45] speaks about maturity adoption is as a
[17:49] result of child training is as a result
[17:51] of testing is as a lot of things that
[17:53] are in there but what you're speaking
[17:55] about maturity and James who would have
[17:59] written this book that we call James is
[18:02] a very interesting brother he would have
[18:05] been son of Mary and Joseph so
[18:07] technically they would call him a
[18:08] half-brother of Jesus and he's mentioned
[18:13] a few times but when you look at some
[18:17] theologians see at at John 7 verses 2 to
[18:21] 5 it would appear that James as he
[18:23] brought up Jesus generally believed
[18:25] Jesus you know even his brethren didn't
[18:27] really believe but he was also one of
[18:30] the earliest witnesses of the
[18:31] Resurrection and I'm seeing this to
[18:33] bring a perspective to who this James is
[18:36] that we're gonna read from he would stay
[18:38] in Jerusalem and form part of the group
[18:40] of believers who would pray in the upper
[18:42] room and his upper room experience his
[18:46] status sort of change as the church grew
[18:48] and the church and Jerusalem was seen as
[18:53] being administered or run by both Peter
[18:55] and James in so much that when Saul was
[18:59] convicted to Paul and come to meet with
[19:03] Peter James was part of that meeting and
[19:06] when Pizza escaped from prison he would
[19:09] you should they say go and tell James
[19:12] and the Brethren so it would seem that
[19:14] in Peters absent James was the man who
[19:16] would hate you only reigns together of
[19:18] the group there someone calling me
[19:21] pastor in Jerusalem my times when the
[19:23] Jerusalem Council convened James would
[19:26] appear to be the chairman in acts 15 he
[19:28] is called a pillar of the church in
[19:30] Galatians 2:9
[19:31] he presides over the meeting in
[19:35] with Paul's to the missionary so I put
[19:37] little bit of stretch at all this
[19:38] brother James is James would start off
[19:41] his letter in Geneva 1 a servant of God
[19:44] and of the Lord Jesus Christ he twelve
[19:46] tribes which are scattered abroad so we
[19:49] understand that James ministry as it was
[19:51] was really focused on the Jews as
[19:54] compared to Paul being focus on the
[19:56] Gentiles this is this is stuff that we
[19:58] can't understand James verse one verse
[20:01] two would say my brethren count it all
[20:03] joy when you fall into divers
[20:04] temptations it is how he would speak so
[20:06] so he trial or going true counted joy
[20:09] it's always like a tough seeing you know
[20:11] and we're going to pass him I counted
[20:13] joy when you go to diverse temptation
[20:15] knowing this study trying of your faith
[20:18] worketh patience and let patience have a
[20:21] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[20:23] entire wanting nothing and he would go
[20:25] on and he would bring out things and
[20:27] then but then he comes to where we want
[20:29] to rest tonight on James three and James
[20:33] three becomes unique because it brings
[20:35] the area of focus that we know you know
[20:39] but what I want a really hone honest
[20:42] because this could be a make-or-break
[20:43] for your Christian journey right in this
[20:45] James three is that it could be a make
[20:47] or break in your Christian journey what
[20:51] James addresses hidden James 3-1 to 12
[20:56] he briefly touches in chapter one so we
[21:00] starting in chapter one and we just
[21:01] gonna take one verse in chapter 1 verse
[21:03] 26 and listen to this scripture so we
[21:06] are James 126 we're gonna get the gh3
[21:08] know but if you have your Bibles James
[21:10] 1:26 he said if any man among you seem
[21:15] to be religious and Bridal if not his
[21:19] tongue but deceiveth his own heart this
[21:23] man's religion is in vain
[21:27] we did one more time if any man among
[21:29] you seem to be religious some would see
[21:34] spiritual and Bridal if not his tongue
[21:37] but he see with his own heart this man's
[21:40] religion is envy so James in James 1
[21:43] verse 26 among the preaching of
[21:45] encouragement he drops that in there and
[21:48] say listen if you think you're religious
[21:50] and you cannot control your tongue all
[21:54] of your believing is in vain I strong
[21:57] with a strong teaching a strong teaching
[22:00] so we're gonna bring this warm a little
[22:02] bit tonight
[22:03] and Jim starts also we gonna get to our
[22:06] our text tonight James 3 and verse 1 my
[22:11] brethren be not many masters you have to
[22:16] read it carefully
[22:16] be not many masters in other words don't
[22:19] try to be masters and the chance in his
[22:22] teacher so in other words there should
[22:23] be many teachers knowing that we hiki
[22:27] including himself as a teacher shall
[22:29] receive the greater condemnation so he
[22:33] is building here he's building slowly
[22:35] here so in another translation it says
[22:38] it like this not many of you should
[22:40] become teachers my brothers for you know
[22:43] that we who teach shall be judged with
[22:46] greater strictness my brethren be not
[22:50] many masters knowing that we shall
[22:52] receive the greater condemnation
[22:57] but a random said like this don't desire
[22:59] ministry because if you teach in
[23:04] the exam paper after fees is a harder
[23:08] example because you're held more
[23:10] accountable because teaching is only the
[23:13] wood is the expression of the wood it's
[23:16] what will bring understanding to people
[23:18] and I've said it before I'm very
[23:20] cautious whenever I'm placed in a
[23:22] position to see something because if I
[23:25] say the wrong thing God will judge me
[23:28] for saying the wrong thing but at the
[23:31] same time words are so powerful that if
[23:34] I'm saying the right thing you are also
[23:36] judged for hearing you would I'm not
[23:39] taking action with you would everybody
[23:40] with me tonight
[23:42] so James goes on for in many things
[23:47] who's to for in many things we offend
[23:50] all if any man offend not in word the
[23:55] same is a perfect man so let me read it
[23:59] slowly again for in many things we
[24:01] offend all said alternatively is same
[24:07] for we all stumble in many ways and if
[24:11] anyone does not stumble in what he says
[24:13] you talk about words no he is a perfect
[24:16] man If any man offend not in word so if
[24:21] you don't make a mistake in what you see
[24:22] you see him as a perfect man so James is
[24:26] no typing the perfect man to the man who
[24:29] doesn't stumble in what he says
[24:31] everybody with me so he's bringing a
[24:34] clear connection between control of what
[24:37] you see and what a perfect man is again
[24:44] for in many things we offend all or in
[24:47] other words for all I'll stumble in many
[24:49] ways if any man offend not in word so if
[24:54] your words don't affect anybody or you
[24:56] don't stumble in your word the same is a
[24:58] perfect man he makes this connection I
[25:00] want to nail it down a perfect man is
[25:03] equal to not stumbling in you would I'm
[25:07] able also to bridle the whole body so
[25:11] James's a mastery over what you see
[25:16] it's also mastery of you over your whole
[25:19] body alright for we all stumble in many
[25:22] ways and if anyone does not stumble in
[25:25] what he says he's a perfect man also
[25:27] able to bridle his whole body so it
[25:31] places mastery of your tongue or of your
[25:34] words as the highest achievement so in
[25:38] bringing your body under subjection in
[25:41] it in other words and I'ma sharing with
[25:44] others conversation yesterday there are
[25:46] people who go into the mountain and
[25:48] meditate and and and be controlled they
[25:51] don't come and meet people they don't
[25:53] funny kid but that is easier to bring
[25:57] that part in subjection than to bring
[25:59] your tongue into subjection everybody
[26:04] with me so Jesus talked about how hard
[26:07] it is to bring this tongue this mount
[26:10] what we see under control and he starts
[26:16] to not bring examples because he's
[26:18] dealing on something and this is the
[26:20] only place in the entire Bible it's
[26:23] almost like a one message is being
[26:25] preached about this he said Behold we
[26:29] put bits in the horse's mouth that they
[26:32] may obey us and we turn about their
[26:35] whole body and then use it another
[26:39] example in verse four behold also the
[26:42] ships which we know they be great and a
[26:46] driven of fierce winds yet they are
[26:50] turned about with a very small helm
[26:53] whithersoever the governor listed so
[26:57] James is bringing a parallel so you
[26:59] could really see it he said I see a bit
[27:02] a horse is a powerful animal and a small
[27:06] bit in the horse's mouth once that bit
[27:09] is connected to the rope you could just
[27:11] pull back a little bit and although it
[27:14] is only any modes by controlling the
[27:17] amount of this horse he won't force
[27:20] would stop the horse would turn left the
[27:23] horse would turn right and he brings the
[27:26] example um as the biggest ship in the
[27:28] world the greatest ship
[27:30] even if they are driven by fierce winds
[27:33] they are turnabout by a very small helm
[27:37] whithersoever he governor listed so he
[27:41] master of the ship don't have to come
[27:43] out his ship and try to hold his ship
[27:45] and try to move the ship and say let me
[27:47] polish it just by moving the rudder
[27:50] bishop he's able to move the entire ship
[27:52] verse five give him so the tongue is a
[27:56] little member and boasted great things
[28:00] be wall how great a matter a little fire
[28:05] kindred
[28:07] they see us thing there
[28:10] now that verse 5 so alternate tongue is
[28:16] a small member yet it boasts of great
[28:17] things when it goes and it says in
[28:24] another translation it says how great of
[28:26] forest is set ablaze by such a small
[28:29] fire anybody with me so a small of all
[28:37] forest you know some may see bushfire on
[28:40] the road and it's a small little
[28:43] cigarette but small something you might
[28:46] not even know the source that ignited
[28:48] with a small flicker a small fire light
[28:52] of the hole for us
[28:55] Jemison your tongue is just like that
[28:58] when you know control what you see it's
[29:02] like basically sparking a little small
[29:05] fire like a light of a whole forest
[29:09] let's continue and the tongue is a fire
[29:17] this is v6 a world of iniquity so is the
[29:24] tongue among our members that it defile
[29:27] ate the whole body and it set it on fire
[29:31] the cause of Nita and is set on fire of
[29:36] hell so what is he saying here is you
[29:40] could be living in your mind what you
[29:44] consider Christian life I don't drink I
[29:47] don't smoke I don't do this I don't do
[29:50] this you don't do that you don't do any
[29:52] other but your mouth your mouth is
[29:58] potentially more dangerous or is more
[30:02] dangerous now everything else that we
[30:05] just talked about listen the James going
[30:09] on because he ready Nealon there's none
[30:10] are we gonna see a few things in a in a
[30:12] bid for this is verse 7 for every kind
[30:15] of beasts and of birds and of serpents
[30:19] and of things in the sea esteemed and
[30:23] I've been teamed of mankind listen to
[30:26] the Prophet listen to James here and
[30:28] every kind of beast and of birds and of
[30:32] serpents and of things in the sea esteem
[30:35] and has been teamed of mankind who is it
[30:39] but the tongue can no man team it is an
[30:43] unruly evil full of deadly poison
[30:48] it'll make you wonder what we're talking
[30:50] about you know and this is where I come
[30:55] in home I come and warm to us tonight
[30:56] because we dealing with spiritual
[30:58] maturity
[31:00] and immaturity we trying to get at is
[31:03] you have to see you writing and you
[31:08] cannot be seen you wrong things and that
[31:13] your eternal destination is not just
[31:17] based on your actions but your eternal
[31:20] destination is based on what you see
[31:23] that's that's that's a big one that's a
[31:28] big one deal with bless we God even the
[31:33] father and therewith curse we men which
[31:37] are made after the same multitude of God
[31:41] out of the same mouth proceeded blessing
[31:46] and cursing my brethren these things
[31:49] ought not so to be in other words you
[31:54] seen when you look at man out early see
[31:57] him out its blessing coming out and his
[32:00] cursing coming on let's go a little
[32:05] these things ought not so to be but a
[32:09] fountain sent forth at the same place
[32:12] sweet water and bitter
[32:15] now a common woman over here is
[32:17] jettisoned Evinrude found a fig tree my
[32:20] brethren be olive berries either a vine
[32:24] figs so can no fountain boat yield salt
[32:27] water and fresh now in our Christian
[32:36] journey you're pressing you trying
[32:41] you're struggling you're trying to do
[32:44] things you trying to do things you right
[32:45] way many times people bring many aspects
[32:49] of their Christian experience under
[32:50] subjection but they still find
[32:54] themselves seeing you wrong thing No
[33:02] research says that on average
[33:06] in addy the average person speaks seven
[33:11] thousand words a day some people do it
[33:13] in half a day some people do that in a
[33:16] few hours but on average on average
[33:20] people spend about seven thousand words
[33:23] a day some could double that number some
[33:29] could quadruple that number I want us to
[33:32] catch what James is saying here words
[33:35] are very powerful words are powerful
[33:39] it was once spoken that was let there be
[33:44] light and there was light it was words
[33:48] spoken
[33:49] that was moon Sun stars separation that
[33:57] creative power of words is very powerful
[34:00] and in simple subtle ways we sabotage
[34:05] our Christian experience and we also
[34:07] sabotage our lives
[34:10] as I look at the journey through
[34:14] Scripture
[34:16] what God is trying to achieve and I'm
[34:20] trying to recognize that many times and
[34:22] I want you to think about it
[34:24] how many times have we said the wrong
[34:27] things when we should have said
[34:30] something different
[34:33] many people talk about somebody told
[34:36] them you'll never amount to anything
[34:39] some people took that as a reason to act
[34:43] out a certain way some people took it as
[34:45] motivation to maybe break out of that
[34:49] but powerful so powerful our words that
[34:52] your wrong words could drive somebody to
[34:55] commit suicide
[34:58] the Wrightwood could break you out of
[35:02] depression you can be having a bad day
[35:08] and somebody says something to you and
[35:10] all of a sudden you're dead changes but
[35:15] a brand imma talk about somebody came
[35:16] into his car and spoke a blue streak
[35:20] meaning the words that came out was
[35:22] laced with spiritual power let's bring
[35:28] it now to you see because many times we
[35:34] come to church and we have a
[35:35] conversation this is Bible study so
[35:37] we're not reaching Jewish life is the
[35:40] easy part know the city warm life do you
[35:45] work life the school life the conflict
[35:49] but a life because conflict is
[35:51] inevitable it's part of life
[35:55] well you see in the midst of the
[35:58] conflict what your mouth says that is
[36:02] the real issue because even when you're
[36:07] apologized for saying certain things you
[36:09] can on the exerting things you ready
[36:12] because because words can be so powerful
[36:15] you could shut down somebody for years
[36:23] misguided parents have said to children
[36:26] I wish I didn't have you
[36:39] some relationships have reached at that
[36:42] point where somebody would see it
[36:44] another I never loved you
[36:50] would such as you'll never change that
[36:55] is a completely different effect from
[36:58] saying you're gonna make it all things
[37:03] are possible in Scripture we see it's a
[37:07] evil every week see you week let them
[37:11] see that they are strong to reinforce
[37:15] that your emotions how you feel how you
[37:19] approach life can change just based on
[37:24] what you see or what is said to you we
[37:29] use the example of naman a week ago
[37:33] where his Sylvan said something to him
[37:36] and he said it was fortunate that his
[37:38] servants had his best interests at heart
[37:40] because if they didn't have his best
[37:42] interests Heidi could have said well let
[37:44] me go back but V actually said you write
[37:49] things to him in such a way that they
[37:52] were able to critically look in and
[37:54] influence you would influence his
[38:01] behavior influence what he was going to
[38:04] do everybody with me tonight the right
[38:09] words at the right time can be helpful
[38:13] can be healing can be transforming can
[38:19] be transformative everybody with me
[38:21] tonight everybody with me the wrong
[38:26] words can be destructive your wrong
[38:29] words can set you back your wrong words
[38:32] can change your whole outlook on life
[38:35] the whole churn of Israel reach the
[38:38] kiddies Vanya 12 spies go out can come
[38:42] back and say we see Giants we car take
[38:44] it we were not gonna make it or all
[38:46] these things give me one second
[38:56] yeah and you want this book destroy the
[39:02] entire the entire atmosphere of the
[39:06] children of Israel in submaster when
[39:08] Joshua and Caleb team you war place in
[39:10] disarray if words did that you know the
[39:13] people didn't see the Giants they didn't
[39:16] experience it but woods puts fear in
[39:19] their heart think about it how many
[39:24] people thought about you know once at a
[39:27] business and somebody sees a do starting
[39:28] business now when is that this is yours
[39:30] boss and that would just destroy you
[39:34] just like that she would yes then we'll
[39:38] just put your put put you on pause
[39:41] enough you power of words so we're
[39:46] dealing it very very very different
[39:48] levels here if your spiritual side is in
[39:51] natural side there's you looking in a
[39:54] mirror of your life and speaking
[39:56] positive about you because Jesus was
[40:00] going to see if you shall see there is
[40:03] mountain not if you believe in him not
[40:06] if you believe is not about even belief
[40:09] because you expressing it activate
[40:12] something
[40:14] so most of them would a brother came to
[40:17] the Prophet and you see something wrong
[40:21] with your wife something wrong with your
[40:22] life and you purposely went last you buy
[40:27] flowers
[40:29] nice easy when I say tell her you love
[40:31] her and I say hello chocolates and I
[40:34] just see you problem
[40:37] was he tall as a spirit upon her you
[40:39] know
[40:40] where was the spread apana just telling
[40:43] how to write clean god help us tonight
[40:47] could change your home seeing the right
[40:51] thing could change your wall Hosanna
[40:56] your words could escalate situations or
[40:59] deescalate so there were 10 managers in
[41:01] companies if something happened you have
[41:04] to learn how to de-escalate speak to
[41:07] people insecurity conflict people attend
[41:10] somebody companies talk
[41:11] [Music]
[41:13] I have seen situation where people go on
[41:16] on them headstrong well if you buy your
[41:18] own thing and before you know it it
[41:19] won't it turn from would fight to
[41:21] physical fight now
[41:22] because if situation was a new world
[41:25] stage but you weren't a de-escalate the
[41:29] situation wasn't there
[41:32] I want you to challenge yourself how
[41:35] many arguments because we comin home no
[41:38] we not dealing with church life he
[41:40] delivered maturity you know we didn't
[41:42] really live that nobody seeing me LSE
[41:44] the scene if he cannot see the apartment
[41:46] scene are we dealing with you in your
[41:48] house and I want you to replay maybe go
[41:52] as far back but some for some people as
[41:53] yesterday some people it's 10 minutes
[41:54] ago some people is there last year
[41:55] I don't know how fire to be you back the
[41:58] things you could have avoided by saying
[42:01] words that were healing that were
[42:05] transformative that were positive that
[42:08] were encouraging words are powerful
[42:12] Jesus was walking one day he saw a fig
[42:17] tree he only decided but I'm sure toward
[42:20] he will get some food to eat there when
[42:22] he saw that there was no fig he's in no
[42:25] man eat from this hereafter Jesus kept
[42:29] walking the disciple can answer what is
[42:30] happening it was a while after only next
[42:33] day or so that the disciples were
[42:35] running say listen you remember Eitri
[42:38] you spoke to where everything is going
[42:40] dried up to the roots and Jesus said
[42:43] have faith in God for verily I say unto
[42:46] you and whosoever shall say unto this
[42:48] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[42:50] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[42:52] his heart but shall believe God those
[42:56] things which he said shall come to pass
[42:57] he shall have whatsoever he said
[43:00] so what you see is directly to connect
[43:04] it to what moves in your life until you
[43:07] see it it's not moving let me say that
[43:09] again what you see is directly connected
[43:14] to what will move in your life now I
[43:18] want to touch on a few scriptures we
[43:20] still building on this Matthew 12:36 but
[43:26] I say unto you listen carefully but
[43:28] every Idol would know this bringing a
[43:31] little closer to home now every idle
[43:33] word that men shall speak they shall
[43:36] give account thereof in the day of
[43:39] judgment let me see it again
[43:40] but I say unto you that every idle word
[43:44] that is singular Matthew 12:36 so on
[43:49] average people speak 7,000 words addy I
[43:54] want to think about it and God is
[43:56] picking on the idle words and saying I
[44:00] want you to explain to me because give
[44:03] an account means you have to explain why
[44:07] he was talking that can I can I can I
[44:15] touch that again
[44:16] but I say unto you that every idle would
[44:21] this is what idle phrase this is not
[44:23] idle conversation so most of us spend a
[44:26] whole hour talking things are not
[44:28] edifying anybody not helping anybody not
[44:31] advancing your life your spiritual walk
[44:33] but advancing your marriage and helping
[44:36] your children
[44:39] that's wastin time because all the wall
[44:41] want our your talk is idle you know what
[44:45] idle means
[44:45] item means not productive not helpful
[44:50] there's no fruit idleness cannot lead to
[44:53] fruit so there's no fruit to come from
[44:55] idleness that every idle would I wanted
[44:59] to think about it because putting things
[45:00] into perspective when it takes 7,000 set
[45:03] up multiply it somebody says 11 was 11
[45:05] million was a year or something like
[45:07] that and out of that it makes you
[45:09] becomes very careful very careful with
[45:13] the quality of conversations you have
[45:20] and the conversations you have with your
[45:22] children and the idol or any productive
[45:25] and the idle or are they helpful at the
[45:28] idle or are a spiritual are you at me
[45:31] when you're in your job are your
[45:33] conversations idle or they are helpful
[45:35] and the idle or they are productive are
[45:38] the idle or people would say boy when he
[45:41] speaks he's seen thing that encourages
[45:43] he's saying that is helpful he's seen
[45:46] because you could spend your whole time
[45:47] and that's why you could resume where
[45:50] people's heart I can you're gonna get to
[45:52] the scripture you don't have to see
[45:54] words a cut people don't to raise
[45:56] yourself up live a life of encouragement
[46:02] live a life of speaking positive but the
[46:06] Branham said if you have nothing good to
[46:08] see steer quiet
[46:11] if you have nothing positive to see
[46:14] steer quiet
[46:18] if somebody don't have new revelation
[46:20] you have you can just blast them away
[46:25] and you didn't run them down and every I
[46:32] said to you that every idle word that
[46:35] men shall speak they shall give account
[46:36] thereof on the day of judgment and he
[46:39] goes on verse 37 for by thy words thou
[46:43] shalt be justified and by thy words thou
[46:47] shalt be condemned so God has way in
[46:52] your words because it was his word he
[46:54] was his creative word but we are living
[46:57] in the in the fruit of his word can eat
[47:00] us amen
[47:02] let's move on proverbs 18:21 if you take
[47:06] in notes I've been looking for it
[47:07] proverbs 18:21 death and life are in the
[47:14] power of the tongue and they that love
[47:17] it shall eat the fruit thereof that's
[47:20] given you references to show that this
[47:21] is the issue throughout scripture to
[47:24] help you begin to God how you speak
[47:27] realize your words are like a currency
[47:30] and you're spending this currency in
[47:33] some way and you have to give an account
[47:35] for what you say to your children you
[47:39] have to give an account to what you say
[47:41] to your family you have to give an
[47:43] account to what you say to people you
[47:44] interact with because they may forget
[47:47] what you said but you have to give an
[47:50] account for every would Traverse 2123
[47:57] whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
[48:00] keeping his soul from troubles I see it
[48:05] again
[48:05] whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
[48:08] keepeth his soul from troubles you know
[48:11] my people's soul in trouble because they
[48:13] say things powerful things oh I want
[48:19] this is sing long any heart Ephesians
[48:21] 4:29 this is going now beyond Idol
[48:27] because idleness was dealt with in
[48:28] Mathew idleness is not productive you we
[48:31] same time it is it really does breathe
[48:33] you be there talking I just talking
[48:34] nonsense
[48:35] no Ephesians 4:29
[48:38] no corrupt communication proceed out of
[48:41] your mouth but that which is good to the
[48:45] use of edifying that it may Minister
[48:49] grace unto the hearers
[48:53] let me see it again let no corrupt
[48:55] communication proceed out of your mouth
[48:59] but that which is good to the use of
[49:02] edifying that it may Minister grace unto
[49:05] the hearers
[49:09] you
[49:11] Luke 6:45 a good man out of the good
[49:17] treasure of his heart bringing forth
[49:21] that which is good and an evil man out
[49:25] of the evil treasure of his hat bringing
[49:29] forth that which is evil for of the
[49:32] abundance of the heart his mouth
[49:36] speaketh so after all his son undone you
[49:41] could be behaving good enough he ain't
[49:43] doing nothing wrong enough but the
[49:45] issues of your heart come up in what you
[49:47] see you know better balance said you'd
[49:49] have to kill somebody physical he could
[49:52] kill him by destroying his influence and
[49:54] how you do that by just seen but his
[49:55] ministry he's been in Hsieh all that you
[49:58] know you know is you know you need
[50:03] something deeper yeah he has something
[50:09] yes yes it's just something you know
[50:16] many swords I've been wrecked because
[50:18] people just see things and and people
[50:19] open their mouths and again Liberty to
[50:21] speak I want us to become cautious I'm
[50:25] speaking to the church here but those
[50:27] who are blessed outside it she looks
[50:29] fantastic but let us be a discipline
[50:32] Church that we are very careful with how
[50:35] we use words words are a currency I want
[50:39] you to see word as a currency because
[50:42] every time you speak you are having an
[50:44] impact you could see something tonight
[50:47] listen you know how liberating you would
[50:50] I forgive you are you know how
[50:53] liberating you is I am sorry how
[50:57] powerful those words
[51:02] something you tickets are intimate
[51:04] limiting a long explanation to refill
[51:06] the situation remedies a few simple
[51:09] words can take something that existed
[51:11] for years and brigde penis was
[51:14] associated with that anybody with me
[51:17] tonight
[51:19] he won't ship of your life change
[51:23] trajectory because you see me right
[51:26] thing I'm sorry I forgive you I messed
[51:29] up I didn't mean it that way it's not
[51:31] what I wanted to see and I will work to
[51:35] to bridle my tongue
[51:37] I will work to see it differently I
[51:40] didn't mean to cut it on you can
[51:42] motivate people in different ways you'd
[51:44] have to cut them down to get him to do
[51:45] something anybody with me tonight I'm
[51:49] not gonna be too much longer with you
[51:50] that's a little teaching familiar
[51:53] scripture James same as a perfect man
[52:01] Jim said it was a bright early whole
[52:03] body because he bring his tongue under
[52:06] control mastery of his words mastery of
[52:12] his words and the issue becomes deeper
[52:16] friends because when as seniors or
[52:18] Spearin so as leaders we see things in
[52:22] such a way that younger or the people
[52:25] who are under our influence see that as
[52:28] the behavior we we teach in people you
[52:32] wronged him
[52:33] so there are now second-order
[52:35] consequences because words have meaning
[52:38] words are seeds
[52:40] words have power I have seen I remember
[52:46] was I was younger brother Orbison he
[52:49] went on to be with the Lord
[52:50] I was very house in school every time in
[52:53] secondary school and I met him only
[52:54] ruler husband about Maxie
[52:57] I'm never too welcome to me and see me
[52:58] there but just coughing me my fears kick
[53:00] him in my face he was 40 years older
[53:02] than me and I was there traumatized I've
[53:04] no idea I try to try to figure what he
[53:07] turned the dumber
[53:09] she'd shown off a loop because I
[53:10] couldn't and I realize that there are
[53:15] many things that we have learned from
[53:17] Scripture and the message and stuff like
[53:18] that but in see confronting the issues
[53:21] of life and that's why he babbles he has
[53:24] given us all things with life and
[53:25] godliness
[53:28] your natural life copy one way and it
[53:30] shoots like your spiritual life is this
[53:33] week and people know you're for this
[53:34] your worship I'm telling you no this is
[53:37] not about knowledge of the world you can
[53:38] know the word and see the wrong thing
[53:41] you could know Scripture and say the
[53:44] wrong thing
[53:46] knowing Scripture knowing the word
[53:48] doesn't automatically make you somebody
[53:51] who do use idle words true words for
[53:54] people about people done with your words
[53:57] you embarrass people was it was the
[53:59] objective of trying to hood somebody
[54:01] with with words could be a weapon words
[54:05] could be a weapon a little missing words
[54:08] like an atomic power in wars have been
[54:11] fought over words countries have gone to
[54:15] war over words words use effectively
[54:21] could have stemmed many issues that
[54:23] existed in the world between churches
[54:26] between families between so many
[54:28] situations what could have been
[54:30] decelerated or accelerated because of
[54:33] the bad use of words words deformed
[54:38] allies because it's all seeds anybody
[54:45] with me tonight and the whole ship james
[54:49] using in the nvv energy of a horse which
[54:51] is it it's organic it's alive it's
[54:55] moving it has his own emotions it has
[54:58] his own sentiment it once to go its own
[55:00] way and a small bit rightly manage teams
[55:05] that emotion that energy leave a loss
[55:08] you a runaway you want to know neither
[55:10] horse he will do what he wants but a
[55:12] small bit right in his mouth controlling
[55:16] that mount control the whole animal
[55:20] suddenly an animal that cadets run
[55:23] rampant is brought under subjection
[55:26] because of that control so James is
[55:29] suing now this this this call it this
[55:32] organic side of thing then he goes to
[55:34] thirty inanimate object you see a whole
[55:37] ship doesn't have a life of its own the
[55:40] wind's blowing it whatever weight with
[55:43] but by the control of a small will rod
[55:48] or whatever you call it that you all
[55:50] ship moving the direction of your life
[55:55] of your marriage the direction of your
[55:57] business the direction of your family is
[56:00] controlled by words you have spoken or
[56:03] words you will speak your spiritual
[56:08] progress is determined by what you will
[56:10] see and I will get it because we prophet
[56:13] identified it as well anybody with me
[56:16] tonight
[56:19] even how you pray because how you create
[56:22] is an expression of wood
[56:23] come on now you have to see you write
[56:30] things and you have to stop seeing you
[56:33] wrong things I love reading I love
[56:37] studying I know if you haven't figured
[56:39] up with me and I was reading a book on
[56:42] thinking and they say when you're
[56:45] training at Olympic swimmer there are
[56:49] two approaches to training an Olympic
[56:52] swimmer and this was coming out of a
[56:55] massive study that was done in thinking
[56:58] so they say that when you're training a
[57:00] swimmer high-performing athlete a
[57:04] significant part of the training is
[57:06] focused on telling the swimmer what to
[57:10] do so you improve your stroke this way
[57:13] you put your hand this way you do it
[57:16] this way you breathe in this week that's
[57:19] the significant is all about training of
[57:21] what to do do it this way do it this way
[57:24] but then they said at a certain point
[57:27] you switch the training from what to do
[57:30] to what not to do and they said when you
[57:34] switch and it reads that point of what
[57:37] not to do they begin to talk about this
[57:40] is the mistake to avoid so they said I
[57:43] tell you stop doing that stop doing that
[57:45] stop doing that and in so doing
[57:49] they're cutting away know the weaknesses
[57:51] because you've already who only craft of
[57:54] what to do now we need to remove the
[57:56] things that you may be doing in your
[57:58] life that actually slowing your down in
[57:59] other words these are the things that
[58:01] create friction or resistance in our
[58:04] walk anybody with me so when you're
[58:07] riding if you ever had a bicycle he
[58:09] breaks up a bicycle just closes him and
[58:11] slow the tire down that act of cerini
[58:15] tire down by putting pressure is
[58:17] friction friction so what is slowing
[58:20] down our spiritual lives many times may
[58:23] not be just what we are supposed to be
[58:25] doing but it's things we have to stop
[58:27] doing that's the point I want to make
[58:29] and when you stop saying
[58:31] wrong thing and you stop speaking
[58:33] negativity if you keep speaking negative
[58:36] about your white guru this you I do do
[58:39] this you iCarly's you actually we're
[58:40] doing this whole day there's your story
[58:42] play your song your song is he never do
[58:44] something you will never see her right
[58:48] nothing she will ever do will undermine
[58:51] or overturn or change that perception
[58:53] because you know singing is words and
[58:55] acts like songs are powerful because
[58:58] songs are words in action as well
[59:02] anybody with me but if this same
[59:05] situation you start to see different
[59:08] things you change a whole anointing you
[59:10] change you whole atmosphere you can
[59:11] change you whole inspiration anybody
[59:12] with me try to warm up into something
[59:19] huh Sam's 39 one I said I will take heed
[59:26] of my wheeze listen to dated 30 summers
[59:30] I will take heed of my ways so he know
[59:34] taking consciousness whiz speaking to
[59:38] behavior to conduct I will take heed of
[59:41] my whiz that I sin not with my tongue so
[59:47] he sat a he said to connect his
[59:50] consciousness of his behavior in other
[59:52] words if you know that the situation
[59:56] you're about to face is one that is
[59:58] conflated I will get to the CD wrong you
[59:59] know in in school you have those who
[1:00:01] stay home back home lucuma back to build
[1:00:04] a face a woman at home at home at have
[1:00:07] attended they don't need oh no go ahead
[1:00:13] go ahead go ahead
[1:00:15] get a girl again but if you know the
[1:00:19] situation it's iike some of us we
[1:00:20] looking for five because we have a point
[1:00:22] to prove
[1:00:22] come on now we want to make the point so
[1:00:28] we took in Warren fire because we want
[1:00:30] to make the point when David is saying I
[1:00:34] take heat of my ways and I was I don't
[1:00:36] want to make that point because if I
[1:00:38] make that point I don't know how fight
[1:00:39] will go because in this thing it's an
[1:00:41] argument I might see something that I
[1:00:43] could never
[1:00:44] but I could see sorry you know what the
[1:00:46] fact that he was left could do damage
[1:00:48] that could take years to repair anybody
[1:00:53] with me tonight I'm speaking to young
[1:00:56] people so how you speak to your parents
[1:01:01] honor your father and mother that
[1:01:05] honoring is about respect that uttering
[1:01:09] is so significant is the only
[1:01:11] commandment with a blessing that it
[1:01:13] deals will be long how many lies have
[1:01:17] been cut short because they never said
[1:01:20] you right thing their parents
[1:01:22] how many marriages could have been saved
[1:01:25] or Hilo in a better place because you
[1:01:28] write things were not said I wanted to
[1:01:30] sink I'm gonna go through just three
[1:01:39] examples really profit and we're gonna
[1:01:42] bring this teaching to our close tonight
[1:01:45] and we gonna get into about seeing the
[1:01:47] right thing we know these stories but
[1:01:50] this is Bible studies also studies of
[1:01:53] connecting a message to the scripture as
[1:01:54] well to the power of what I said well
[1:01:58] the banner made my new ministry he says
[1:02:00] though we find later then one day I was
[1:02:03] going fishing down a deal hollow with
[1:02:06] some men mr. wood and his brother and
[1:02:08] they were Jehovah Witnesses and Jess had
[1:02:13] been converted and baptized into the
[1:02:16] feet and while we were fishing over
[1:02:19] against the bank I've told you the story
[1:02:21] many times
[1:02:22] dear mr. wood said the banks were that
[1:02:25] one of our trustees here now said about
[1:02:27] some old sister that used to feed them a
[1:02:30] slice of home bread and butter she
[1:02:32] belong to the Church of good he said
[1:02:34] Lyle to his brother we ought to go up
[1:02:37] and tell her that we got saved so
[1:02:40] they're having a conversation but look
[1:02:41] at the conversation they have in Twitter
[1:02:44] Vancity coefficient and one better tell
[1:02:46] you see Lyle we have to go and tell a
[1:02:48] woman that we got saved no this gives
[1:02:52] you a Content good is it this is not
[1:02:53] idle talk
[1:02:54] this is talk with substance this is
[1:02:57] talking meaning and where the madam
[1:02:59] would follow that by saying you know
[1:03:01] there's just certain things that we can
[1:03:04] see that takes a hold with the Holy
[1:03:07] Spirit my god just certain things that
[1:03:11] pleased him just right and when we save
[1:03:15] that thing I want you to notice what you
[1:03:18] say if we can just find what to see your
[1:03:22] words judge you
[1:03:23] your words condemn you or your words
[1:03:26] will bless you so this teaching tonight
[1:03:30] is not to cut you down you know this
[1:03:33] teaching tonight is to change your
[1:03:35] language change your vocabulary change
[1:03:39] your phrasing change how you talk to one
[1:03:42] another change how you approach life
[1:03:45] change your outlook this you political
[1:03:48] around the economic remedy for nine
[1:03:50] children
[1:03:51] that is not our realm we come from a
[1:03:54] place with a different language where we
[1:03:56] come
[1:03:57] from we move mountains where we come
[1:03:59] from we talk to lions that's where we
[1:04:01] come from that language we come from
[1:04:03] anybody with me tonight
[1:04:06] so listen to the Prophet you know I want
[1:04:09] any luck to get my time you know it
[1:04:11] there's just certain thing that hope
[1:04:12] this help you
[1:04:13] so in other words there's a certain
[1:04:15] thing if you could say it to your wife
[1:04:16] it's a certain thing you could say to
[1:04:19] your children this is a certain thing
[1:04:21] you could say to your husband this is a
[1:04:23] thing you could see I want to me wrong
[1:04:29] you know there's there's certain things
[1:04:30] that we can see and that takes a hold
[1:04:33] with the Holy Spirit just certain things
[1:04:36] that pleases him just right and when we
[1:04:38] say that thing I want you to notice what
[1:04:40] you say if we can just find what to see
[1:04:42] it's better you say give me some time to
[1:04:45] find you right hook I do want to say the
[1:04:46] wrong thing that is better than to just
[1:04:48] fly off the handle and say something you
[1:04:50] will regret your words judge you your
[1:04:54] words condemn you or your words will
[1:04:56] bless you and unconsciously I'm going or
[1:04:59] no banks must have said the right thing
[1:05:01] for no more than he said that no
[1:05:04] understand this and up to this point
[1:05:07] this had nothing to do with a prophet
[1:05:10] this is a brother talking to a brother
[1:05:14] ricochet and the Holy Spirit get touched
[1:05:16] I'm better balanced said for no more
[1:05:19] than he said that I was sitting in the
[1:05:21] back of the boot fishing with the fish
[1:05:23] line for a little bluegill fish to be to
[1:05:27] put on the line for beats for me and run
[1:05:30] out a beat and I was catching these
[1:05:32] little fish on putting them in the
[1:05:33] bucket for the trapline and when banks
[1:05:36] said that all of a sudden something
[1:05:38] struck me so the words that he spoke had
[1:05:42] an effect even beyond his situation and
[1:05:44] no hit the Prophet he said something
[1:05:47] struck me he said the right thing and
[1:05:49] the Holy Spirit spoke and said does said
[1:05:52] the Lord you'll find in the next few
[1:05:55] hours there'll be a resurrection of a
[1:05:57] little animal so that woods
[1:06:02] not idle words not random words words
[1:06:06] about salvation of his soul God was so
[1:06:10] pleased that he no touch his prophet and
[1:06:12] say listen he next few hours there'll be
[1:06:15] a resurrection of a little animal but if
[1:06:17] Adam said I thought it will be a kitten
[1:06:19] that I thought my little boy had
[1:06:20] squeezed too hard and squeezed the
[1:06:22] breath out of him and I dropped him on
[1:06:23] the floor before we left I thought
[1:06:25] that's what it would be but I was
[1:06:27] surprised in the next morning while
[1:06:28] we're sitting on the boat I know banks
[1:06:30] is here I guess Lyle is here if you are
[1:06:33] raise your hand he comes down with us
[1:06:35] all the time we know it he caught a fish
[1:06:37] we know the story with a little long
[1:06:39] hook he caught a little bluegill fish
[1:06:41] and it swallowed the hook all the way
[1:06:43] down and he took a hole at the little
[1:06:45] fish instead of just taking the hook out
[1:06:46] it caught so deep I said I'd take any
[1:06:49] hook OD fish get caught so deep till he
[1:06:51] pulled his stomach and the intestines
[1:06:53] and he gives all right out of his mouth
[1:06:55] and he gets true it into the water just
[1:06:58] a little fish like we had been fishing
[1:06:59] with night before and I cut up a hundred
[1:07:02] of them or more for beat and the little
[1:07:04] fellow quivered four or five times and
[1:07:06] tried to work his little mo but he
[1:07:07] couldn't because he was filled up with a
[1:07:09] guild and so forth and I said he shot
[1:07:11] you a little wild a little fella I went
[1:07:13] ahead fishing thinking nothing about it
[1:07:15] then God does something so strange all
[1:07:19] of a sudden I fell they're coming
[1:07:21] something moved on over the top of them
[1:07:23] woods the Holy Spirit move down and said
[1:07:25] stand up said speak to that little fish
[1:07:28] and it shall have his life again it had
[1:07:30] been laying there dead for half an hour
[1:07:32] don't float it back into the weeds
[1:07:33] I said little fishy I give you a life in
[1:07:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ little
[1:07:38] fish turn over flipped up and went out
[1:07:40] to the water just as hard as he could do
[1:07:42] I stood there not knowing what to do but
[1:07:45] a bank said is good for us to be here
[1:07:47] what triggered that he said the right
[1:07:50] thing now in this same message everybody
[1:07:53] with me we could take a little more
[1:07:54] gentle wrap up you know and let's see a
[1:07:57] mess in my new ministry but if I said
[1:07:59] now listen don't miss this show you the
[1:08:01] sovereignty of God he said now while we
[1:08:04] were talking I said I want to ask you
[1:08:06] something
[1:08:07] no this is not with a Branham elysium
[1:08:09] message he is now at sister happy rides
[1:08:11] room we know the story so now bring in
[1:08:14] no you could say any writing tonight
[1:08:17] you can see the writing tomorrow change
[1:08:19] your whole life he said I want to ask
[1:08:22] you something what put those crows out
[1:08:24] there but the bran and I just testified
[1:08:25] any hopes that he was eaten there are
[1:08:27] few people in a holy that's justified of
[1:08:29] his experience with the squirrels
[1:08:30] we know the story and he just speaking
[1:08:33] he said what but no squirrels did
[1:08:34] there's no squirrels in the woods I had
[1:08:36] hunted and hunted I'm not the best of
[1:08:38] hunter but I understand I was a little
[1:08:40] boy and I had hunted close and they were
[1:08:43] in the most ridiculous place and in the
[1:08:45] most ridiculous way I could call them
[1:08:46] what put them there so you seen them
[1:08:49] squirrels wasn't any place you normally
[1:08:50] are it wasn't a ridiculous week and a
[1:08:52] ridiculous place oh he's seen it had to
[1:08:54] be something else with him there so he
[1:08:56] is no testifying he's expressing he's
[1:08:59] sharing a testimony anybody with me
[1:09:01] tonight and he said I said I wonder if
[1:09:05] it is that my ministry fixing to take a
[1:09:08] change and the God of Abraham is
[1:09:10] confirming his promise as he did to
[1:09:13] Abraham when he was on top of the most
[1:09:15] he's a better man him
[1:09:16] Ethan talking fellowshiping and he
[1:09:17] needed a sacrifice for instead of his
[1:09:20] sons you hover a gyro performed a
[1:09:22] miracle and placed a lamb a hundred
[1:09:24] miles back he was a tree to his journey
[1:09:26] so when I ran I was having a time trying
[1:09:28] to connect the Ducks together and any
[1:09:31] ordinary man can walk 25 miles a deed
[1:09:33] and he lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:09:35] mountain far off and went up to the
[1:09:37] mountain where to the top of the
[1:09:39] mountain while I ran back in there a
[1:09:41] sheep why animals could have killed it
[1:09:42] and then up on top of the monkey where
[1:09:44] there's no water how did that arounder
[1:09:46] get a beer so but a brother was seeing
[1:09:48] what Abraham went through can the truth
[1:09:50] say man anybody would be tonight to
[1:09:53] prove to Abraham that he was your over
[1:09:55] Tyrel so but Abraham saying here am that
[1:09:58] Abraham offered up instead of Isaac it
[1:10:00] wasn't common pleas for Iran to be there
[1:10:03] hallelujah
[1:10:04] it had to be Jehovah Jireh because it
[1:10:06] was against the norm for the RAM to be
[1:10:09] in that place the very God of creation
[1:10:11] better Bannerman said spoke a lamb into
[1:10:13] existence no it was no vision he killed
[1:10:16] a ram and blood came out of the animal
[1:10:18] it wasn't it was around and I said that
[1:10:20] same God hallelujah
[1:10:21] that Jehovah Jireh he's just as much a
[1:10:24] Hoover Doretta D as he was under monk
[1:10:27] with Abraham but a Branham clapped his
[1:10:29] hand three times
[1:10:30] can still produce an animal to his glory
[1:10:32] these squirrels was not a vision I
[1:10:35] sucked them blood came out of them I
[1:10:38] jest them and eat them
[1:10:40] there wasn't visions they were squirrels
[1:10:42] I said that seemed to hover Jireh
[1:10:44] trying to get his promise over to me in
[1:10:47] my thickness and dullness of mind he
[1:10:51] could speak my need into existence the
[1:10:54] same as he could speak
[1:10:55] Abraham's need into existence anybody
[1:10:57] with me tonight listen now where did
[1:11:00] where where turns he said I know more
[1:11:02] said that until sister Hattie sitting
[1:11:06] there crying so but abandoned expressing
[1:11:09] this and he annoying dropped on in the
[1:11:11] room and sister haughty here and it is
[1:11:14] crying he said crying hadn't said a word
[1:11:17] and she said that's nothing but the
[1:11:19] truth
[1:11:21] that's what she said that's nothing but
[1:11:23] the truth
[1:11:25] she said the right thing she said just
[1:11:29] like banks said down there so buddy
[1:11:31] Branham can Nix what sister Hattie said
[1:11:33] to when banks and the right thing don't
[1:11:36] by the riverside anybody with me I heard
[1:11:39] her voice as it swept from my ears like
[1:11:41] up into the woods mrs. right sitting
[1:11:44] back there with her little girl was
[1:11:45] trying to interpret and I could and
[1:11:47] that's super annoying thing struck over
[1:11:49] me said tell Hattie that she's found
[1:11:52] grace in the sight of God friends that
[1:11:56] grace she found wasn't even in her
[1:11:58] behavior that grace she found wasn't
[1:12:01] based on how much years she in church
[1:12:03] that grace she found wasn't what her
[1:12:05] doctrine was that grace you found was
[1:12:08] none of that that grace was based on the
[1:12:11] fact that she said the right thing who
[1:12:16] would have taught said tell her to ask
[1:12:17] whatever she will then you speak it by
[1:12:20] this gift into existence whatever she
[1:12:22] asked it speak it into existence I
[1:12:24] looked at sister Hattie the first time
[1:12:27] it was ever performed in a human being I

[1:16:06] England campaign just last year and I'm
[1:16:10] not gonna skip down and when we were
[1:16:13] standing I stepped to one side and his
[1:16:15] Spirit of the Lord came upon me and I
[1:16:16] began to shake and it said the Spirit of
[1:16:18] the Lord said there's a trap set for you
[1:16:20] and be careful what you see you see in
[1:16:27] there a trap is set for you be careful
[1:16:31] what you see friends Church there are

[1:16:51] look at your life and see what's coming
[1:16:54] to you and see the traps that are coming
[1:16:56] to you and if you take that approach
[1:16:58] that I'm clear for what I see and he
[1:17:03] said Fred where you at are you in the
[1:17:04] meeting that's right and we left there
[1:17:06] and - but a sudden something streaks and
[1:17:08] happened and when we got to the meeting
[1:17:09] that night I said to the audience Oh
[1:17:11] buddy random to all the people he said
[1:17:12] remember that's in the Lord there's a
[1:17:14] trap set for me and all of you pray that
[1:17:17] I'll know what to do the right I'll know
[1:17:20] what to do the right thing when this
[1:17:22] comes to pass and the next night had
[1:17:25] happened anybody with me tonight the
[1:17:28] devil sent in two people a young boy and
[1:17:30] a girl to break up the meeting and that
[1:17:33] was in not New Hampshire but voom and
[1:17:35] Freddie you remember the name of the
[1:17:37] city it was a capital what a moment and
[1:17:39] we were just across Lake Champlain but
[1:17:41] the banner was speaking there in the
[1:17:42] church about the location and when we
[1:17:44] will not meet this boy the girl looked
[1:17:46] like some kind of Mongolian girl and the
[1:17:49] boy they were at least 25 years old a
[1:17:51] piece but such immoral action ditches he
[1:17:54] was setting about like this from me and
[1:17:57] when I started preaching he would just
[1:17:58] grab her and throw her head back and
[1:18:00] crime
[1:18:01] and all this stuff but he balanced said
[1:18:04] I said young man don't do that you
[1:18:06] attracting the attention while I'm
[1:18:07] preaching and he just laughed right out
[1:18:10] at me
[1:18:12] so butter madam is now under test he
[1:18:16] said I taught oh there it is there's the
[1:18:18] trap right there I went right ahead
[1:18:21] speaking just the same but I ran i'ma
[1:18:23] say well I see trap a silly trap and a
[1:18:25] who else peeking he got so immoral that
[1:18:28] I could stop again I said don't do that

[1:18:31] the young lady when you then leave the
[1:18:33] building this is a religious meeting you
[1:18:35] shouldn't do that please don't do it
[1:18:37] while I'm in the while I'm in featured I
[1:18:39] started again and it just made it worse
[1:18:40] and then when I turn I said don't and
[1:18:44] something said to me say what you will
[1:18:45] and it'll be done I stood there mr.
[1:18:50] moose a dirty boy and all I'm standing
[1:18:51] but a fret and many of them standing
[1:18:53] president the perspiration was just
[1:18:55] running from me something said see

[1:19:01] and they'll pack them out see what you
[1:19:03] will I couldn't speak I couldn't move
[1:19:07] and I just left I thought God what must
[1:19:10] I do
[1:19:11] and I turned he study on his face while
[1:19:14] looking at me I thought what must I say
[1:19:17] then I turned look like before I know
[1:19:19] what I'd said I said I forgive you of
[1:19:23] your act
[1:19:25] and it must have been just the right
[1:19:29] thing to see it was good trying a
[1:19:33] reaction on an action that night it was
[1:19:38] revealed to me that ad said the right
[1:19:41] thing can the truth salmon so I bring it
[1:19:46] to you tonight from both the scriptures
[1:19:49] and to the message we're gonna closer
[1:19:52] and pray now so I want to kneel down
[1:19:54] friends we all have and and and we have
[1:19:59] read it and I say when you see the Bible
[1:20:01] see all and every is there's no
[1:20:03] exception
[1:20:04] I want to nail this down because I would
[1:20:05] take from you scripture
[1:20:07] I say unto you that every idle word that
[1:20:12] men shall speak they shall give account
[1:20:16] thereof in the day of judgment for by
[1:20:20] thy words thou shalt be justified and by
[1:20:23] thy words thou shalt be condemned James
[1:20:31] brought this tape using examples of a
[1:20:36] horse and a ship something that was
[1:20:40] alive and something that was built and
[1:20:42] gave the example that the tongue is that
[1:20:47] controlling element that controls all of
[1:20:52] your life
[1:20:54] control your tongue you control your
[1:20:56] destiny control your tongue you control
[1:21:00] your relationships you control your
[1:21:03] tongue
[1:21:04] you control your family life if your
[1:21:07] tongue defiles your house you're in
[1:21:10] trouble your tongue can destroy or it
[1:21:14] can build up you can see the right thing
[1:21:17] we use the quotes to sure that a little
[1:21:22] brother just testifying of the goodness
[1:21:24] of God in his life he's he gonna tell
[1:21:27] that woman we not the way we used to be
[1:21:29] we're gonna tell that woman something
[1:21:31] came over me we're gonna tell a woman is
[1:21:33] a change in my life and buddy Brennan
[1:21:35] said that that please only goes so much
[1:21:39] that it brought an anointing upon the
[1:21:42] prophet and a word upon the prophet and
[1:21:44] a fish was given life back triggered by
[1:21:47] seeing the right thing we saw the
[1:21:50] prophet testifying of the squirrels
[1:21:53] being created and he's testifying only
[1:21:56] anointing that what he saw with his
[1:21:58] squirrels had to be the same thing like
[1:22:01] Abraham and the RAM but it didn't make
[1:22:04] sense that is the what that wasn't
[1:22:06] normal
[1:22:06] it has to be Jehovah Jireh and a little
[1:22:09] humble with a woman a little humble lady
[1:22:12] said that's nothing but the truth when
[1:22:16] you say the right thing tonight when you
[1:22:18] say the right thing tomorrow will you
[1:22:20] say the right thing when you are in
[1:22:22] trouble we go when were to Brandon had
[1:22:24] his test he had an option he could have
[1:22:26] said anything and God would have honored
[1:22:28] you word of his prophet because a
[1:22:31] prophet is a mouthpiece of God go over
[1:22:33] back him up but gloried also testing him
[1:22:36] and he said the right thing
[1:22:42] I want to serve our heads in prayer
[1:22:46] tonight and with the Branum he was
[1:22:50] praying in the same message my new
[1:22:52] ministry and I guess they were praying
[1:22:56] for one another or people coming up as
[1:22:58] to the audio or depending he said not
[1:23:00] every one of you not only ministers but
[1:23:02] all of you or to pray for these people
[1:23:04] you don't know what God might do for you
[1:23:07] while you pray for somebody else
[1:23:10] what if you'd say the right thing so
[1:23:12] that one message where the banner must
[1:23:15] focus on saying the right thing he said
[1:23:17] here's a woman standing here that's so
[1:23:18] sick they have to haul her up what if
[1:23:21] your prayer would be the right thing
[1:23:23] just like banks said the right thing
[1:23:26] like Hattie said the right thing what if
[1:23:29] you would say the right thing your
[1:23:30] prayer to cause God to come down and do
[1:23:33] something see this is not just one
[1:23:36] person this is the Church of the Living
[1:23:38] God
[1:23:39] everybody now everybody be in prayer so
[1:23:41] let's just bow our heads for with a
[1:23:43] prayer tonight and I want you to catch a
[1:23:46] burden and I want this to see the right
[1:23:49] thing but amantha you don't know if the
[1:23:52] wouldn't you see would be the right
[1:23:53] thing to touch somebody tonight the

[1:24:24] right thing how there's so much power in
[1:24:27] the tongue that we can see the right
