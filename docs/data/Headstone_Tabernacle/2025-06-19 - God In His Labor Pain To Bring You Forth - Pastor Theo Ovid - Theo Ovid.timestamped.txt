[35:47] It's not too hard to ask that because
[35:48] you're going to fulfill that. You said
[35:50] that another church put forth another

[36:29] welcome. Praise God. So we good glad to
[36:32] be here tonight. And if you have your
[36:34] Bibles, I like you to turn to Hebrews
[36:35] chapter 4. Want to read one verse there
[36:38] verse 11 and also uh St. John chapter 16
[36:43] 1 verse there verse 21. Hebrews 4:11.
[36:46] Let us labor therefore to enter into
[36:47] that rest least any man fall after the
[36:51] same example of unbelief.
[36:55] John 16:21.
[36:57] A woman when she's in travail had sorrow
[37:01] because her hour is come. But as soon as
[37:03] she's delivered of the child, she
[37:06] remembereth no more the anguish for joy
[37:09] that a man is born into the world. May
[37:12] God bless his word. May we be seated. A
[37:15] woman when she gives birth to a child
[37:18] has grief, anguish, agony because her
[37:21] time has come. Amen. When she delivered
[37:23] the child, she's no longer remembers her
[37:25] pain, trouble, anguish because she's so
[37:29] glad that a man, a child, a human being
[37:31] has been brought into the world. The
[37:33] Bible talk about we the glory that shall
[37:36] be revealed in us, the sufferings we go
[37:37] through, not even worthy to be compared
[37:39] with what shall be revealed in us. Amen.
[37:42] Amen.
[37:43] Genesis 2 1-3 says, "Thus the heavens
[37:46] and earth were finished, and all the
[37:49] host of them, and on the seventh day God
[37:51] ended his work which he had made. And he
[37:55] rested on the seventh day from all his
[37:59] work which he had made. And God blessed
[38:01] the seventh day and sanctified because
[38:04] in it he had rested from all his work
[38:06] which God created and made. So God
[38:09] worked
[38:11] and after he worked, he rested. Amen. So
[38:15] there's no getting away from this thing
[38:16] called labor
[38:18] or work. And the title I have tonight is
[38:21] God in his labor pain to bring you
[38:26] forth. Glory. Amen. That's the title I
[38:29] want to have tonight.
[38:31] God in his labor pain to bring you forth
[38:35] and have an inspiration. Let us labor.
[38:38] Amen. Let us labor. Let us fight. Let us
[38:41] struggle. If you think you're fighting,
[38:42] fight harder. Fight more. Take your pain
[38:46] and take your grit and grind because
[38:47] you're going to produce something.
[38:49] You're going to come forth. Amen. Amen.
[38:51] Okay. Wonderful. All right. Now, I have
[38:55] this to read, but I want to read from
[38:57] the amplified. This is in Hebrew chapter
[38:58] 1
[39:00] from 8, and I go into chapter two, and
[39:04] you'll see where I'm going with this.
[39:05] For as to the Son, he says to him, "Your
[39:08] throne, oh God, is forever and ever to
[39:09] the ages of the ages. And the scepter of
[39:12] your kingdom is a scepter of absolute
[39:14] righteousness, justice,
[39:16] straightforwardness.
[39:18] It is lawlessness,
[39:20] injustice, and iniquity. Therefore, God,
[39:23] even your God, God has anointed you with
[39:27] the oil of exaltant joy and gladness
[39:30] above and beyond your companion. And
[39:32] further you, Lord, did lay the
[39:34] foundation of the earth in the
[39:36] beginning, and the heavens at the works
[39:37] of your hands. They will perish, but you
[39:41] remain and continue permanently. They
[39:44] will all go grow old and wear out like a
[39:47] garment, like a mantle thrown about
[39:49] oneself. You will roll them up, and they
[39:52] will be changed and replaced by others.
[39:55] But you remain the same, and your years
[39:58] will never end nor come to failure.
[40:01] Besides, to which of the angels had he
[40:03] said, "Sit at my right hand, associated
[40:06] with me my royal dignity, till I make
[40:08] your enemies a stool for your feet, are
[40:10] not angels, all ministering spirits,
[40:13] servants sent out to the service of God
[40:15] for assistance to those who inherit
[40:18] salvation." And this is chapter two.
[40:20] Here we go. Since all this is true,
[40:24] let's just read this here.
[40:27] The words you would hear
[40:32] is therefore we ought to give the more
[40:36] earnest heed to the things we have heard
[40:39] least at any time we should let them
[40:40] slip. This have more weight and value in
[40:43] 2025 than they ever taught before. This
[40:46] what we hearing here. Yes sir. People
[40:47] hear the message and the message is like
[40:49] chewing gum. True. They're chewing it
[40:50] like gummies or something spitting us
[40:52] out or whatever it is. But this here we
[40:54] need to look at this here closer. Amen.
[40:57] Since all this is true, we ought to pay
[41:00] closer attention than ever to the truths
[41:02] that we have heard, lest in any way we
[41:06] drift past and slip away.
[41:09] For if the word spoken by angel was
[41:11] steadfast, and every transgression and
[41:13] disobedience receive a just recompense
[41:16] of reward, how shall we escape? If we
[41:21] neglect so great salvation which at
[41:24] first began to be spoken by the Lord and
[41:26] was confirmed unto us by them that heard
[41:28] them. This is it here now. For if the
[41:31] message given through angels, the law
[41:33] spoken by them through Moses was
[41:35] authentic and proved sure and every
[41:38] violation and disobedience receive an
[41:39] appropriate, just, and adequate penalty.
[41:42] How shall we escape appropriate
[41:46] retribution if we neglect and refuse to
[41:50] pay attention to such a great salvation
[41:52] as it now offered to us, letting it
[41:55] drift past us forever? For it was
[41:57] declared at first by the Lord himself
[42:00] and was confirmed to us and proved to be
[42:03] real and genuine those who personally
[42:06] heard him speak. I want to skip down.
[42:08] Amen. For some Oh, let me go to verse
[42:11] seven here. For thou has made him a
[42:13] little lower than the angels. Thou
[42:15] crownest him with glory and honor, and
[42:17] this set him over the works of thy hand.
[42:20] Listen to this now. Thou has put all
[42:22] things in subjection under his feet. For
[42:25] in that he put all in subjection unto
[42:27] him. He left nothing that is not put
[42:29] under him. But now we see not yet all
[42:32] things put under him. Amen. That sound
[42:35] like it's a contradiction. Let's hear it
[42:37] in the a bit. For some little time you
[42:39] have ranked him a little lower than the
[42:40] unfair to the angels. You have crowned
[42:42] him with glory and honor, set him over
[42:44] the works of your hands. For you have
[42:45] put everything in subjection under his
[42:47] feet. Now in putting everything in
[42:49] subjection to man, he left nothing
[42:51] outside of man's control. But at
[42:53] present, here we go, we do not yet see
[42:56] all things subject to him. In other
[42:58] words, we have not seen man fully under
[43:01] power in sub and the earth, everything
[43:03] under him in subjection. It's to come.
[43:06] But he already put it. Yes. He said man
[43:08] is supposed to control this thing. Man
[43:10] is supposed to have dominion. But we see
[43:12] it yet. But then the Bible went on to
[43:14] say here now this is so beautiful. But
[43:17] we are able to see Jesus who was ranked
[43:20] lower than the angels for a little while
[43:22] crowned with glory and honor of having
[43:25] suffered death in order by the grace of
[43:28] God to us sinners he might experience
[43:31] death for every individual person. Amen.
[43:34] Hallelujah. For it was an act worthy of
[43:36] God, fitting of his divine nature, that
[43:38] he whose sake and by whom all things
[43:41] have their existence in bringing many
[43:43] sons into glory, should make the pioneer
[43:47] of that sal of their salvation perfect.
[43:51] Should bring to maturity the human
[43:54] experience necessary to be perfectly
[43:57] equipped for his office as high priest
[43:59] through suffering.
[44:01] So this high priest we have was brought
[44:04] into this perfection to feel for us to
[44:08] stand for us to go in front of us and
[44:11] God take him through suffering. Oh give
[44:14] the Lord some praises.
[44:16] Hallelujah.
[44:18] For both he who sanctifies make men holy
[44:21] and those who sanctified all have one
[44:24] father. For this reason he's not ashamed
[44:27] to be called them brethren.
[44:29] Oh, praise God. Since therefore, here we
[44:33] go. Oh, God.
[44:35] Since therefore his children share in
[44:38] flesh and blood, in the physical nature
[44:41] of human beings, he himself in similar
[44:45] manner ptook of the same nature. And by
[44:48] growing through debt, he might bring to
[44:51] north and bring of no effect him who had
[44:53] power of death. That is the devil.
[44:55] Hallelujah. So, you know what Jesus did?
[44:58] He take on our form. He take on ro of
[45:00] flesh to conquer death that death had no
[45:03] power over the blood wash blood wash. Oh
[45:07] glory to God. And also he might deliver
[45:11] and completely set free all those who
[45:14] through the haunting fear of death were
[45:16] held in bondage to the whole course of
[45:18] their lives. For we all know he Christ
[45:21] did not take hold of angels, the fallen
[45:23] angels to give them a helping delivering
[45:25] hand, but he take hold of the fallen
[45:27] descendants of Abraham to reach out to
[45:29] help them and give them a helping hand.
[45:31] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. I'm
[45:33] almost done. So it is evident. I'm going
[45:36] read it here in verse 17 and 18. I know
[45:38] it sound strange because from your bed.
[45:40] Wherefore in all things it behoove him
[45:43] to be made like unto his brethren that
[45:46] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[45:49] priest in things pertaining to God to
[45:52] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[45:55] people. For in that he himself had
[45:57] suffered. Being tempted he's able to
[46:00] succur them that are tempted. Amen. So
[46:03] it is evident, it was essential that he
[46:06] be made like his brethren in every
[46:08] respect in order that he might become a
[46:10] merciful, sympathetic, and faithful high
[46:13] priest in things related to God to make
[46:15] atonement and appropriation for the
[46:17] people's sin. Here we go. For because he
[46:20] himself in his humanity has suffered in
[46:22] being tempted, tested, and tried. So
[46:25] what you going through this morning?
[46:27] What you going through? This man Jesus,
[46:30] he suffered. Hallelujah. He was tempted
[46:33] and tested. What you talking about?
[46:38] He is able immediately to run to the cry
[46:41] or assist or relieve those who are being
[46:44] tempted and tested and tried and who
[46:47] therefore are being exposed to
[46:49] suffering. Oh, glory to God. And the
[46:51] Bible said he learned obedience by the
[46:54] things that he suffered. So suffering is
[46:56] part of this package. If you didn't
[46:58] know, now you know. Hallelujah. Oh,
[47:01] blessed be the name of the Lord. All
[47:03] right.
[47:06] Talking about fighting, right? Yes. This
[47:08] land of Canaan was the land of promise.
[47:10] That was the land of rest. But when they
[47:12] get into this land of rest, they have to
[47:13] fight in the rest. Amen. To get a rest.
[47:17] Okay.
[47:19] Did you get that? They come into the
[47:22] land. Oh, we reach Hallelujah. Glory.
[47:23] Glory. Glory.
[47:25] And in the land which is land of
[47:26] promise, you have to fight in order to
[47:29] get a rest. Now Joshua only had three
[47:31] things to do sir. Three just three
[47:33] things. Not 24, not 17 mysteries. Just
[47:36] three things. Cross over, fight, and
[47:40] divide the land. Oh, give the Lord some
[47:41] praises. It's very simple. It's not
[47:43] complicated. It's not a big kind of
[47:45] complication or kind of mystery and go
[47:47] deep. And he had to three hours on this
[47:48] side and three hours on that side. We
[47:49] don't need six hours for this. It's
[47:51] three things he had to do. cross over
[47:53] the land. You got Jordan there. You had
[47:56] to cross over to go. You can't just do
[47:57] binoculars and looking good. You know, I
[48:00] like all that how you're looking like
[48:01] taking pictures and putting on
[48:02] Instagram. We don't talk about that.
[48:04] Every place you put your foot and to put
[48:06] your foot you have to cross over. And
[48:08] Jordan means death and we struck on
[48:10] Sunday. People don't want to die to
[48:11] theelves, die to their attitude, die to
[48:14] their ways, die to their past. You have
[48:16] to die. I don't care who you are. Your
[48:18] stinking self have to get busted. Go
[48:20] have to break a human spirit. Go have to
[48:22] boss open you. Oh, give the Lord some
[48:24] praises. I know they say preaching a
[48:26] message in train, but we preaching it.
[48:28] Go have to break a train that spirit.
[48:30] You have to bust your train that spirit
[48:31] to get to the Holy Ghost. The train is
[48:33] not the Holy Ghost. Glory. You are not
[48:35] the Holy Ghost. Oh, give the Lord some
[48:37] praise. The Holy Ghost is the Holy
[48:38] Ghost. There's only one Lord. There's
[48:40] only one spirit. There's only one
[48:42] baptism. There are two Lords and two
[48:44] spirits. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[48:48] Amen. So that whole bunch of Israel had
[48:50] to fight for how much years? 6,8 years.
[48:53] And after they fight, then you could
[48:55] divide the land. Amen. Like come
[48:57] forward. Give me my mountain. You can't
[48:59] talk about a mountain when giants all
[49:00] over the place. You have to get to a
[49:01] place where you can ask for your
[49:02] inheritance.
[49:04] You can't just just walk up inheritance.
[49:06] You'll get licks. Them demons will beat
[49:08] you up. You have to clear the ground
[49:10] first. You can't build and you know what
[49:12] I mean? All kind of all kind of sight
[49:15] ice and hit and whatnot. You have to
[49:16] fight. Get them off your land. You have
[49:19] to know it's your land. God give you
[49:21] this land. Your body is your body, too.
[49:23] You have a right to fight every
[49:24] sickness, every disease, every
[49:26] condition. You can't say, "Well,
[49:29] I diabetes, my father had it, my
[49:30] grandfather have it, my
[49:31] great-grandfather have it. Therefore, I
[49:33] own it." That's a lie. I'm not accepting
[49:35] that. I My father had, grandfather had,
[49:38] great-grandfather had. That is their
[49:39] business. My business to claim what God
[49:42] said. I said, "Devil, get out of here."
[49:44] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[49:47] Don't accept nothing. No sickness, no
[49:50] disease, nothing. I have a right to be
[49:52] healed. I have a right to be sealed. I
[49:54] have a right to shout. I have a right to
[49:56] praise God. I have a right to every
[49:58] redemptive blessing that Adam lost. I
[50:00] have a right to that. He put everything
[50:02] under our feet. Every devil is under our
[50:04] feet. Sickness under our feet. Disease
[50:07] under your feet. Cancer under your feet.
[50:10] Tumor under your feet.
[50:13] Hallelujah.
[50:17] Glory to God.
[50:19] So faith is a revelation of what will
[50:21] be.
[50:23] That's what faith is. A revelation of
[50:25] what it will be. Hallelujah. It's not
[50:27] real to you in manifestation yet. Isaac
[50:30] wasn't real to to Isaac. Um um Abraham
[50:32] had Isaac as a revelation. He couldn't
[50:34] show anybody Isaac and say there is
[50:36] Isaac. Look Isaac. But it was real to
[50:38] him. It was something that was to come.
[50:40] He stacked up because the faith
[50:44] Sarah could talk so and Sarah was his
[50:46] wife. He could whisper in the air and
[50:48] say Isaac coming. He could lecture her.
[50:50] He could give her text. He could give
[50:51] her books. He could give her tapes. He
[50:53] could press play whole day and say,
[50:54] "Play it over. Play it over. Play it
[50:56] over." Sarah didn't have a revelation
[50:58] that Isaac was coming. But Abraham had a
[51:01] revelation and you couldn't take it out.
[51:03] And we have a revelation that the seven
[51:05] is a bright revival. Nobody could take
[51:07] that out. Nobody can explain that away.
[51:09] Nobody contain that out there. Seven
[51:11] thunders revival. It will take them
[51:14] seven thunders to wake up the bride. He
[51:17] will send it. He promise it. If the
[51:20] church will plead the promises or give
[51:22] the Lord a shout, that's what we hear.
[51:24] Fight for it. Give the Lord some praise.
[51:26] Fight for it. You have to fight for what
[51:28] is yours. The revival, that's mine. Holy
[51:31] Ghost, that's mine, too. Signs and
[51:32] wonders, that's mine, too.
[51:35] [Applause]
[51:41] [Music]
[51:46] Hallelujah.
[51:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you have to
[51:50] fight. Hallelujah. Now Satan sent fallen
[51:54] angel spirits to try to get us off the
[51:56] word. And after every messenger that
[51:59] come and bring the true word after the
[52:01] messenger that die, fallen angels drop
[52:03] down right on top of the message. right
[52:05] in the church. Fallen angels bringing
[52:07] interpretation men idea human spirit
[52:10] fallen angels from hell that got kicked
[52:12] out of heaven fallen after every
[52:14] messenger in the message and that's why
[52:17] I said the devil is in the church the
[52:19] devil is in this message but we have to
[52:21] cast him out because Jesus in my name
[52:24] give the Lord a shout in the house they
[52:26] shall cast out devils no praise demon
[52:29] interpretation demon hallelujah men
[52:31] interpreting the word how they want it
[52:33] that's a lie all kind of false
[52:35] inspiration
[52:36] false teaching, false men. Give the Lord
[52:39] some praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[52:43] What's the objective? To get you off the
[52:45] word.
[52:47] Hallelujah. Because everything have an
[52:49] appointed time. And if you can't wait,
[52:51] he will sell interpretation.
[52:53] You get you get some kind of baby.
[53:02] So the challenge is how do we stay with
[53:04] the word while we waiting on the
[53:06] fulfillment of the word and men feeling
[53:09] tired, the men feeling weary and figure
[53:10] but they have it now. They adopted now
[53:12] mini adoption, small adoption, baby
[53:13] adoption, what kind of adoption they
[53:14] start to filter adoption all kind of
[53:16] ways
[53:17] with no power, zero power, not a witness
[53:21] of God's approval. But when they talking
[53:23] about Jesus, they say Jesus, a man
[53:26] approved of God.
[53:28] You could see it. You could feel it. You
[53:31] could see it. You could see the
[53:33] manifestation around him. A man approved
[53:35] of God. His ministry expose those guys.
[53:39] Oh, give the Lord a shout. And the life
[53:41] of Christ ministry will expose all the
[53:44] hypocrites. Hallelujah. All the liars,
[53:46] all the men who God called to do what
[53:49] they're doing, it will expose them. Oh,
[53:51] glory to God. who had talk and more
[53:53] talk. Oh hallelujah. Because the fallen
[53:56] angels it fall long in the church to
[53:58] make them be pan and smoke and so on is
[54:01] for long to make them religious.
[54:12] [Music]
[54:15] That's the purpose. Make them religious.
[54:19] Hallelujah.
[54:21] And they can watch the nature. After all
[54:24] the teachings and revelation, what their
[54:25] behavior it's not the teaching, you
[54:27] know, it's watch the life behind the
[54:29] teaching
[54:31] because when the anointing come for the
[54:32] bride, it could only produce temperance,
[54:35] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness.
[54:38] 2 Peter 1:4-7. That is the anointing and
[54:42] the life that the bride would connect
[54:43] with. No other life could work in her.
[54:47] Who said that? The prophet said that. No
[54:50] other life. No message life, no
[54:52] interpretation life, no man of the hour
[54:54] life, no pope, Mrs. Pope life. No other
[54:56] life. What's life going to live in?
[54:58] Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[55:01] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness.
[55:09] And whether it's your wife, your
[55:10] husband, your mother, your father, your
[55:12] brother or sister, God had to use
[55:14] something to make sure them things is
[55:16] tested, tried inside of you. You don't
[55:19] hear much about that. But it had to be
[55:20] tried and proven. A faith that can't be
[55:22] tested can't be trusted. How God trust
[55:25] you when he never test you. God had to
[55:27] test it to trust you. The test, the
[55:29] trust comes by the test. Oh, give the
[55:31] Lord a shout. The trust come by the
[55:33] test. Oh God, when he test Abraham, so
[55:36] he said, "Now I know you fear me."
[55:37] Because the man was coming on the night
[55:38] to take Isaac out. He said, "Now I know
[55:41] you are the man. You are my man on the
[55:43] earth. Not only will you be blessed, but
[55:45] I'm blessing your seed after you and
[55:47] your seed in 2025."
[55:49] Hey, going to possess the case of the
[55:51] enemy. I feel tonight like a royal seed
[55:54] of Abraham. Hallelujah. I feel we're
[55:57] going to possess something tonight. Oh,
[55:59] glory to God. I feel like a seed of
[56:01] Abraham. Royal seed.
[56:05] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:08] My God. A Jew, a Jew is not a Jew
[56:11] because he born in Israel. The Bible
[56:13] explains that a Jew is a real Jew. You

[58:14] [Music]
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:18] [Music]
[58:22] [Applause]
[58:24] [Music]
[58:26] The more is a holiday and Friday is a
[58:28] holiday. So you know we're going to
[58:30] tonight. Buckle up your belt.
[58:32] Hallelujah.
[58:34] All right. Brother Brandham, I was
[58:36] reading here. It was Irene or Martin.
[58:39] One of them had a a man had a crown of
[58:41] gold on his head, white robes on, shoes
[58:45] inlaid with gold. And said, "I am the
[58:47] Christ. Confess me." That saint wouldn't
[58:51] do it. That three prophet of God stood
[58:53] there, waited and said two or three
[58:56] times to him, the man said, I am the
[58:58] Christ, confess me. He said, our Christ
[59:02] don't come like that. Amen.
[59:05] That's right. Listen, Baro, you have got
[59:08] to know the word.
[59:10] Stay on the word. These false spirits is
[59:13] trying to get you off the word, you
[59:14] know. Now, watch. But the brand is not
[59:18] the absolute, you know.
[59:20] Amen. This is the absolute.
[59:24] You cannot put barwood above this, you
[59:25] know. Here's why he came to reveal this.
[59:32] And what he taught us is this. When the
[59:34] angel came to him, I swept back wing
[59:37] guys.
[59:39] He said what they say, he check it in
[59:41] the scriptures. He said if they say
[59:43] anything contrary to the scriptures, he
[59:45] not receiving it.
[59:49] Paul said,
[59:51] "If a angel come down from heaven and
[59:55] preach any other gospel, let him be a
[1:00:00] curse." So I don't want to hear angel
[1:00:02] meet you and you see a light and you
[1:00:04] feel like this and something tell you I
[1:00:05] am the Holy Ghost and something tell you
[1:00:07] this and tell you that. You have to find
[1:00:08] it back in the scriptures. And if you
[1:00:11] can't find it back in the scriptures,
[1:00:12] it's a demon. It's a devil. It's
[1:00:14] spiritual wickedness. in high places.
[1:00:17] We'll give the Lord some praises. All
[1:00:19] kind of crazy revelations.
[1:00:24] Praise God. But a Brandon said they
[1:00:28] could be baptized 24 hours with the Holy
[1:00:30] Ghost and still be lost. Amen.
[1:00:37] Now take that at face value.
[1:00:40] What a Brandham said, the secret is the
[1:00:43] seed is in your soul. Yes, that's the
[1:00:45] real thing. Now, you have to take that
[1:00:49] and pass it through the scriptures to
[1:00:51] validate what he said to understand what
[1:00:53] he said. Because if you put it like a
[1:00:55] template, 2 + 3 equal 5. You have to
[1:00:59] understand if you're minus three from
[1:01:00] five, they get two. It must work right
[1:01:02] through. So, if you put on a template,
[1:01:04] if Peter's seed was in his soul, he
[1:01:05] don't know if he go in the upper room
[1:01:09] because his seed in his soul. All he to
[1:01:11] do is to go and wait and pass through
[1:01:14] and say I'm a Christian or whatn not and
[1:01:16] when they they come to hold him he run
[1:01:18] and hide because he se in his soul he
[1:01:20] have zero power but Jesus told them with
[1:01:24] your seed in your soul you need power
[1:01:28] you need Holy Ghost they tell you that's
[1:01:31] all you need word on top of word on top
[1:01:34] of all these quotes they love them
[1:01:35] things word on top of word on top of
[1:01:37] word added and you're a son you're all a
[1:01:40] son that come to time I meet a brother,
[1:01:42] he tell me um justification like take up
[1:01:45] a piece of wood with moss in it. Soon
[1:01:46] you start that I know you going off.
[1:01:48] When I hear the mos tell myself turn you
[1:01:50] with mos on it. He say sanification they
[1:01:52] clean the most of it. Holy ghost shape
[1:01:54] it. I said but the same word
[1:01:58] nothing had changed. I said now tell me
[1:02:00] what the prophet said. You see oh you
[1:02:02] had to watch you have to watch them
[1:02:03] devil watch them dogs you know. Yes sir.
[1:02:06] The prophet said justification take
[1:02:08] about dirty glass. Amen. Sanification,
[1:02:11] wash the glass. Holy Ghost, pour milk in
[1:02:13] the glass. That's a different
[1:02:15] introduction to something else.
[1:02:18] But the Mos revelation, I call it the
[1:02:20] Mos Revelation. Well, the worst
[1:02:21] revelation. The Mos revelation. The same
[1:02:23] Trinidad with moss on it. You scrape him
[1:02:26] off. Same trinadian. He move. He change.
[1:02:28] You shape him, he come out good. He went
[1:02:30] tight jacket and he went a long dress
[1:02:32] and they singing specials. But he's the
[1:02:34] same person. Nothing had changed. But
[1:02:37] when this fire come, wait, not just any
[1:02:41] fire, the one John talk about, I am not
[1:02:44] worthy, but he that cometh after me, he
[1:02:48] is going to baptize you with the Holy
[1:02:51] Ghost and with fire. That is what I
[1:02:54] talking about. You can find that in the
[1:02:56] Bible. He will do something. Not the
[1:02:58] preacher, not the teacher, not the
[1:03:01] apostle, not the prophet, not the
[1:03:03] evangelist. This Jesus, he going to
[1:03:06] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:08] fire. When you get baptized in water,
[1:03:10] somebody take you and dip you and bring
[1:03:12] you out. They put you under the water.
[1:03:14] And when God baptized with the Holy
[1:03:15] Ghost, he dip you in the spirit. When
[1:03:17] you come back up, you must assemble
[1:03:19] something. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:03:22] Give the Lord a shout. Now watch. When
[1:03:25] the Baram say you can be baptized 24
[1:03:27] hours and be lost, what is he talking
[1:03:29] about? When you go deeper, somebody
[1:03:33] could get baptized in their flesh,
[1:03:35] somebody get baptized in their spirit,
[1:03:37] or somebody could get baptized in their
[1:03:39] soul. So what he's talking about is not
[1:03:41] in the soul.
[1:03:43] He's not talking about that. He's
[1:03:45] talking about people who speak in tong
[1:03:46] carry and fall around and cuss the
[1:03:48] neighbor and don't want to answer back
[1:03:49] their husband and be rude and
[1:03:50] disrespectful. That is talking about and
[1:03:52] they still came. I was in his spirit and
[1:03:53] you know his spirit.
[1:03:59] You got to know the word. Stay on the
[1:04:01] word. The great battle is at hand now.
[1:04:04] We have played church for years and
[1:04:06] years. Who's speaking? I'm still
[1:04:08] reading. But the hour has come now when
[1:04:11] Janice and Jambers will withstand Moses.
[1:04:14] We see them yet. You know Janice and
[1:04:16] Jambers not outside Pentecost and Jes.
[1:04:20] They may start off yet because Moses
[1:04:21] step forth yet. You see what I'm saying?
[1:04:23] Then the manifestation of Christ among
[1:04:25] the bride will be challenged. Yes, sir.
[1:04:27] Even within this message
[1:04:30] to see the power of God come down and
[1:04:32] people people who who love the press and
[1:04:34] play say but that that they're not
[1:04:35] pressing and playing. So that can't be
[1:04:36] right. So they judge the prophet's
[1:04:39] prophecy by their interpretation in
[1:04:41] their head. And God never said that. He
[1:04:44] is his own interpreter. He can interpret
[1:04:47] his word tonight. He is sovereign. He
[1:04:49] don't have to ask anybody permission to
[1:04:51] revive you, restore you, heal you,
[1:04:53] forgive you, cleanse you.
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:57] And that alone should give you faith to
[1:04:59] trust him tonight because he don't have
[1:05:01] to ask anybody. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:05:04] praises.
[1:05:06] Watch the hour coming when John will
[1:05:08] stand Moses as the Bible said they
[1:05:11] would. It's going to be a spiritual
[1:05:13] battle conflict. There'll some just
[1:05:15] continue on. the denominational church
[1:05:17] will just move right on the denomination
[1:05:19] and go on the way it goes. But I mean
[1:05:21] the real true believer is coming to that
[1:05:25] battlefield. Yes sir.
[1:05:27] And you better be versed and know what
[1:05:30] you're doing or you could take an evil
[1:05:33] spirit so easy and not know if it is
[1:05:37] contrary to this word. Don't believe it.
[1:05:40] Stay with the word. Oh, give the Lord
[1:05:44] some praises.
[1:05:47] This is from Christianity versus idol
[1:05:49] tree. He said idolatry is old here in
[1:05:52] United States have idol worship. The
[1:05:53] Indians have it. The rain god, mud
[1:05:55] turtle. They made an image of a mud
[1:05:56] turtle. They put specks all over him. He
[1:05:58] come out of the mud and they believe
[1:05:59] that there's a rain god that come out of
[1:06:01] this mud and the turtle hull that spoke
[1:06:03] to them through this mud turtle. And
[1:06:05] because they believe that he live in the
[1:06:06] mud and moisture, he was god over it.
[1:06:09] Now they worship devils in doing so.
[1:06:13] worshiping a m turtle thinking it was a
[1:06:16] rain god. They brought spirit upon them.
[1:06:20] So the woman from the new age that got a
[1:06:23] revelation I am God. She said an
[1:06:25] anointing came over her when she speak
[1:06:28] it. So yes I am God. It's like a
[1:06:32] revelation pick upon her. And that's how
[1:06:34] that new age thing come. You're one with
[1:06:36] God. So God can't judge you. God can't
[1:06:38] eliminate you. God can't destroy you
[1:06:40] because he can't destroy himself. you
[1:06:41] want with him.
[1:06:43] But that's not in the Bible.
[1:06:45] That is Hindu mythology. And that's why
[1:06:48] they could come back as a snake, as a
[1:06:50] bo, as a goat, as a this and that and
[1:06:52] you know, just evolve, evolve over time
[1:06:54] because you're part of God. You see what
[1:06:56] I'm saying now? All right. So many
[1:06:59] people are opening their hearts to the
[1:07:01] wrong things. You get a spirit. All
[1:07:03] right. And many time it contradicts the
[1:07:06] word saying that this miracles pass.
[1:07:07] There's no such thing as this or that.
[1:07:08] Remember that's a devil. Here we go. Yes
[1:07:10] sir. Under the disguisement of
[1:07:12] Christianity. I want to add to that in
[1:07:15] this message. Amen. Amen. God help us
[1:07:19] when we get down to this that it's an
[1:07:21] evil spirit in the disguisement of
[1:07:24] Christianity, but it isn't the spirit of
[1:07:26] Christ. So any spirit in this message
[1:07:29] that quenches the desire for the Holy
[1:07:32] Ghost in the lives of the people is an
[1:07:34] evil spirit. I don't care who preaching
[1:07:37] what. I don't care whether they come
[1:07:38] from the States, from Trinidad, from
[1:07:40] Europe, from Africa, from South A South
[1:07:42] America, it doesn't matter where they
[1:07:44] come from. Any spirit that will quench
[1:07:46] the hungering and thirsting after
[1:07:49] righteousness that Jesus talk about,
[1:07:51] that's a devil. That's a demon. Give the
[1:07:54] Lord a shout. Any spirit that will make
[1:07:57] you feel comfortable in the castle of
[1:07:59] your skin, that's a devil. God want to
[1:08:02] shake your world. God want to rock you.
[1:08:05] God want to make you uncomfortable. Make
[1:08:07] your pillow heart a stone. That you
[1:08:09] repent of your sins. That you get your
[1:08:11] heart right. That you get your life in
[1:08:13] order to prepare for him because he is
[1:08:16] coming. He's coming with Holy Ghost
[1:08:18] fire. It's coming with phys. Oh, give
[1:08:21] the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:28] Judment is closing now.
[1:08:33] Because before the judgment get outside
[1:08:35] he says start
[1:08:37] in my sanctuary
[1:08:39] we see that yet you know years have been
[1:08:41] saying this message don't know judgment
[1:08:43] coming but it's coming this message
[1:08:46] don't know judgment in the book of acts
[1:08:49] it was instant you know and said repeat
[1:08:51] again a nast fell long in church you
[1:08:54] know that wasn't just a nast man you
[1:08:56] know that was brother and ass sister
[1:08:59] that was a sister everybody you know
[1:09:00] shaking hand goless Bless you. God bless
[1:09:01] you. Praise the Lord. Amen. But she lied
[1:09:05] with the lines on her husband. She could
[1:09:08] have stayed with the word. She stand by
[1:09:10] the husband who was crooked as ever. Oh,
[1:09:13] hallelujah. Have to make a line. You
[1:09:14] have to draw a line. This is what God
[1:09:16] said. I believe what God said. Husband
[1:09:19] on the husband, wife or wife, children
[1:09:21] or children. I believe that God said and
[1:09:23] that's how I believe it. Praise God.
[1:09:25] Praise God. I will never have this
[1:09:27] testimony. The people made me. I'm not
[1:09:29] Saul. So I said the people the people
[1:09:32] you don't want to accept responsibility
[1:09:33] he was given a word I said the
[1:09:35] commission us what to do our commission
[1:09:37] is to stay with the word I don't care if
[1:09:39] the church tinned down to 20 people we
[1:09:41] have to stay with the word and if we
[1:09:42] stay with the word go to bless that 20
[1:09:45] let the hypocrites go praise God let
[1:09:47] them leave praise God praise God people
[1:09:49] feel they're going to lock the church
[1:09:50] neck they don't want to pay ties they
[1:09:52] don't want to pay offering they don't
[1:09:53] want to support the church they want to
[1:09:54] come here and just milk and have bad
[1:09:56] attitudes let them continue with that
[1:09:57] God will judge them right in their seat
[1:09:59] one
[1:09:59] Oh God, we would you would press on
[1:10:01] because everybody hearing this message,
[1:10:03] everybody hearing this same word. He
[1:10:04] said, but with people all didn't mix it
[1:10:06] with faith. All heard Moses, all he hold
[1:10:09] this word, but we have to take time off
[1:10:11] to think. We should not let these things
[1:10:13] slip. Glory to God. I'm not here in
[1:10:15] vain. Hallelujah. I'm not preaching in
[1:10:17] vain. I'm not laboring in vain.
[1:10:19] Hallelujah. Praise God. God called me to
[1:10:21] do this. He put this burden upon me to
[1:10:23] do this. I have to deliver the burden
[1:10:25] that God put upon me. Oh, glory to God.
[1:10:27] Because God worked, God labored, and
[1:10:30] then God rested. You can't rest and you
[1:10:32] ain't working. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:10:34] That why he say a man don't work, go let
[1:10:36] him eat.
[1:10:38] They put fire under him to get a job.
[1:10:42] The Bible said so.
[1:10:49] Spirits.
[1:10:54] So, let me sweeten up a little bit. Am I
[1:10:57] talking? You know if I go down in that
[1:10:59] road with them false anointing and
[1:11:00] fallen angels. There's a whole thing
[1:11:02] myself. I want to stay on the bride
[1:11:03] road. Watch. Having predestinated us by
[1:11:07] talk now unto the adoption unto the
[1:11:10] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:11:11] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:11:13] will. Brother, what did he do? He by
[1:11:16] fornowledge foresaw us. You got to
[1:11:19] understand he foresaw us. Hallelujah.
[1:11:21] That that bring you out of your
[1:11:22] humanistic spirit. He foresaw your
[1:11:24] failures, your shortcomings. He saw
[1:11:26] where you fell where this will happen.
[1:11:28] He forced to all of that and he chose
[1:11:30] you. Yes sir. To do what? To come out of
[1:11:33] your foolishness not to stay where you
[1:11:35] know God understand and I only a human
[1:11:39] God make you. I'm only human. We have to
[1:11:43] stop that human talk. The blood come to
[1:11:45] speak on our behalf that we could get
[1:11:47] the breakthrough that we desire. You
[1:11:49] can't stop this human thing. You have to
[1:11:51] break out of that.
[1:11:56] What did he do? There was no angels. He
[1:11:58] foresaw us. There was lol himself
[1:12:00] existing one. Watch. And he was going to
[1:12:03] save. There's nothing lost. Knowing that
[1:12:05] he know that this great attribute in him
[1:12:07] would project something out yonder that
[1:12:09] he could save. Then he did it by forn
[1:12:12] knowledge. He looked down. He saw
[1:12:14] everyone that would accept it. And then
[1:12:15] by doing so, he said to save that, the
[1:12:17] only way I can do it will be to come now
[1:12:20] myself and be made flesh. take the sin
[1:12:23] of a man upon him and die for him that I
[1:12:26] might be the one that's worshiped
[1:12:27] because he is God the object of worship
[1:12:30] then he came down take upon himself
[1:12:32] while he did that he did that he might
[1:12:34] save you who wants to be saved see what
[1:12:37] I mean by for knowledge the infinite God
[1:12:40] who know all things saw the lamb he slay
[1:12:42] the lamb before the function of the
[1:12:43] world and he put your name in the lamb
[1:12:45] book of life and he's seen watch here we
[1:12:47] go are you ready he's seen the
[1:12:50] deceitfulness of Satan
[1:12:51] what he would do. So he put your name on
[1:12:54] deer. That means he saw what Satan will
[1:12:57] do because Satan was coming in the
[1:12:58] beginning. This is before the beginning
[1:13:03] because he know the end from the
[1:13:04] beginning. He is in this realm.
[1:13:07] Hallelujah. Where there is no beginning,
[1:13:09] no time, self-existent. And he looks
[1:13:11] into time. He sees Satan's operation. He
[1:13:14] put your name in the book and going to
[1:13:16] slip you down into time. Oh, glory to
[1:13:20] Lord. Bypass your theophony. Put you
[1:13:23] into time knowing how the devil going to
[1:13:25] operate. Let's go. He put your name
[1:13:28] there. He said the antichrist will be so
[1:13:30] religious, so good, such a fine fellow,
[1:13:33] such a smart man, such a religious man
[1:13:35] that he would deceive the very elected
[1:13:38] if it was possible. But it is impossible
[1:13:41] because their names were forained before
[1:13:43] the foundation of the world.
[1:13:48] By election, he chose them. We can close
[1:13:51] off right here tonight. If you had
[1:13:53] enough shouts, we close off right here
[1:13:54] now. We don't have enough shouts to back
[1:13:56] this up. But by election, he chose them.
[1:14:00] Oh, glory to God. He rolled the dice to
[1:14:01] say, "Oh, God, I wonder I wonder what
[1:14:03] wonder if this one go repent. I wonder."

[1:14:27] you by election he put his thumb print
[1:14:30] about Jacob I love Esau I hate that was
[1:14:34] election he knew all about Jacob But
[1:14:37] Abram was elected. Why? Why? Why? Why
[1:14:40] this man Jacob? Because he loved that
[1:14:42] birthright boy. You see that Holy Ghost
[1:14:44] thing? He wanted to be part of the Holy
[1:14:46] Ghost bunch. You see this shouting,
[1:14:48] screaming, Acts 2:38 babies thing? This
[1:14:50] noisy bunch. Jacob is part of that. God
[1:14:54] saw Jacob being transformed and he
[1:14:56] wrestled all night long. You talk about
[1:14:59] labor, he held on to the angel. Look at
[1:15:01] me. Saturday night. Oh, praise God. He
[1:15:03] was scared. He was frightened. And he
[1:15:06] know that tonight was his night. He know
[1:15:08] he have to get a blessing. More than a
[1:15:10] blessing, he had to get a
[1:15:11] transformation. Until the angel had no
[1:15:14] choice. Until the angel had to do
[1:15:17] something. Oh God, help us tonight. He
[1:15:20] said the church have to get desperate.
[1:15:22] God always hear a desperate cry. But you
[1:15:25] can't get desperate till God speaks to
[1:15:27] you. That's why God have to come down
[1:15:29] and speak to the bride because a
[1:15:31] minister can't bring the revival. It has
[1:15:33] to come to the people. That means God's
[1:15:36] voice has to come down among us. And he
[1:15:39] said the spirit, the bride and the
[1:15:41] prophet will say the same thing. He said
[1:15:43] the voice of God will be in the bride.
[1:15:45] Once more the world will hear direct
[1:15:48] from God. You will hear direct from God.
[1:15:51] You come tonight to hear direct from
[1:15:53] God. May God speak to your heart to get
[1:15:56] you out your sluggishness
[1:15:58] wherein is tiredness out your condition
[1:16:01] and start a revival in your own soul.
[1:16:04] May it start at night. I cry in your
[1:16:07] spirit.
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:14] He chose you by election. By election,
[1:16:18] he chose them and predestination. They
[1:16:20] know where they're going. Hallelujah.
[1:16:22] What Paul taught. And this is where I
[1:16:24] get from for tonight. The church
[1:16:27] positionally
[1:16:29] before the foundation of the world. This
[1:16:30] is something that will flow you. When
[1:16:32] God
[1:16:34] in his labor pain was bringing forth
[1:16:38] bringing forth you knowing what you will
[1:16:41] do. Yes sir. He positionally placed you
[1:16:43] into his own body to be a housewife to
[1:16:46] be a farmer to be a preacher to be a
[1:16:49] prophet to be this or to be that. He
[1:16:51] placed you positionally by what? By
[1:16:54] labor pain. Oh praise the Lord a shout.
[1:16:58] My God this is like a cap for me.
[1:17:01] Amen. So when God was grinding and
[1:17:03] groaning in the spirit realm to
[1:17:06] positionally place you knowing all the
[1:17:08] drama you have to go through plenty
[1:17:11] drama. You know plenty drama. You know
[1:17:14] when Joseph got the vision of where he
[1:17:16] will be. It wasn't instant. You know it
[1:17:19] was faith in his soul. It is not real to
[1:17:21] him yet but it will be. It's a future
[1:17:24] thing. His brothers had to hate him. His
[1:17:27] brother had to hate him without a cause.
[1:17:28] Think about it. Brit out here do them
[1:17:30] many. I don't know why you like me. They
[1:17:31] can't take me.
[1:17:34] The blood can't stand me. They can't
[1:17:36] handle me cuz I'm different. I have a
[1:17:39] rainbow coat that my father give me.
[1:17:42] They're different. I walking with it. I
[1:17:44] prophesying with it. I'm inspired with
[1:17:46] it. They sell him out. They sold him
[1:17:48] out. You see drama? Joseph, a young man
[1:17:51] balling his own bre. That the most
[1:17:53] hurtful thing you know when your own
[1:17:54] brethren betray you. When your own
[1:17:56] family cut you off and do that and
[1:17:58] Joseph find himself in another place,
[1:18:01] another land, another tongue, you have
[1:18:02] to learn the language. And he say here,
[1:18:04] I like the kind of man he is, you know,
[1:18:06] I will do my very best in immediately
[1:18:08] start to learn the language. Start to
[1:18:10] excel in everything you do. Promotion
[1:18:12] after promotion after promotion and he
[1:18:14] didn't say nothing and because God with
[1:18:15] him. So when you understand God is with
[1:18:18] you in your trials in your whatever
[1:18:20] you're going through whether the boat
[1:18:22] capsize whether you get floor fat tires
[1:18:24] whether the engine con out whether the
[1:18:26] roof blow out it doesn't matter storm
[1:18:28] shun rainbow whatever it is God is with
[1:18:31] you and Joseph knew by revelation God
[1:18:34] was with him so when Pifa wife push and
[1:18:36] move she said but you want me sin
[1:18:38] against my God he had more value to his
[1:18:41] God than the desire of his flesh he had
[1:18:44] his flesh in subjection he was
[1:18:46] mortifying the demons in his body. He
[1:18:47] could have run with that woman, but he
[1:18:49] chose to walk away from here. He chose
[1:18:51] to run. Praise God. Other men will stand
[1:18:54] up and fall. Other men's fall before
[1:18:56] they should even talk. They don't they
[1:18:58] don't fall already. But Joseph stood and
[1:19:00] he take off like a bullet. Oh, give the
[1:19:03] Lord a shout. And when he went in
[1:19:05] prison, he didn't say, "I'm wrongly
[1:19:07] jailed. I'm wrong. I didn't do it. And
[1:19:09] God know me heart.
[1:19:12] Let me give me a testimony. send a
[1:19:13] reporter for me to get my true
[1:19:15] information. He ain't bother with them.
[1:19:16] You know, he sitting in jail
[1:19:17] comfortable. Comfortable because where
[1:19:18] he lead me, I'll follow. Where God put
[1:19:20] me, God is still there. God is not
[1:19:22] against me. God is with me. Where are
[1:19:25] black skies?
[1:19:27] Bright skies. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:19:29] praises. The prophet said, "Bls, bright
[1:19:32] skies are no signs of God's approval.
[1:19:34] Dark skies are no signs of God
[1:19:36] disapproval." His approval is in the
[1:19:38] beloved. He put you in Christ and he can
[1:19:40] send you anywhere you want to put you.
[1:19:42] David stood in Joseph stood in prison.
[1:19:45] Interpret the dream of the baker. He
[1:19:46] cooking up something. He adding and
[1:19:48] taking away and fixing up your own mix.
[1:19:50] He talked to the butler and he saw the
[1:19:52] butler being restored. He tell the
[1:19:54] butler remember me. Now understand this.
[1:19:56] Joseph have to be positionally placed.
[1:19:58] But look at the road that take him to
[1:20:01] his position.
[1:20:03] He's a mad man that say that thrown in
[1:20:04] his mind. You know you next to Pharaoh.
[1:20:06] You know you lost your head. You're
[1:20:08] dead.
[1:20:10] That's not how you do it. Amen. Through
[1:20:12] suffering.
[1:20:14] Are you here tonight? Through pain.
[1:20:18] Who wants pain? Nobody wants pain. But
[1:20:20] through suffering.
[1:20:22] When Joseph said, "Remember me." The man
[1:20:24] going up there when get that wine taste.
[1:20:26] He forget him immediately.
[1:20:29] Who made him forget? God.
[1:20:33] Why? Joseph wasn't ready yet. Why? The
[1:20:37] time wasn't ripe yet. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:20:41] When drama hit the pharaoh soul had the
[1:20:43] dream and he called for interpretation.
[1:20:45] I tell him tell me a dream. Tell me
[1:20:46] interpretation. Them say you're crazy.
[1:20:49] Tell me the dream. You say forget
[1:20:53] when do for you know all wise men. All
[1:20:58] hocus pocus
[1:21:00] all me. So long all this craft all come
[1:21:05] again a few nights and thing you know
[1:21:06] all they losing all their head when the
[1:21:09] butler hear that he know this is serious
[1:21:11] and the butler know where to go when
[1:21:13] your family ready they know where to go
[1:21:15] you know
[1:21:17] when your loved ones catch theel they
[1:21:18] know where to go you know they coming
[1:21:20] right by you you know they come to
[1:21:21] Joseph they say I know how a man who
[1:21:24] interpret and writing and send the man
[1:21:25] when Joseph come
[1:21:28] and I seek the Lord and God revealed to
[1:21:30] Joseph the whole man. He said to
[1:21:32] Pharaoh, he says, "Phero, listen, here
[1:21:33] what to do." I like that. You know, not
[1:21:35] only did God Joseph re reveal what was
[1:21:38] the condition or what is to come, he
[1:21:39] gave the solution. He said, "Find a man
[1:21:42] that could manage this affair." Pharaoh
[1:21:45] said, "You are the man." Amen. That man
[1:21:46] come from prison right into power.
[1:21:48] Figure that one out. Right out of
[1:21:50] prison, straight into the power. You
[1:21:53] have to bow to Joseph because he is
[1:21:55] Pharaoh man of the hour. That is when a
[1:21:58] God that when get mana get approved. You
[1:22:01] can't stop that, you know. That's why
[1:22:03] they say send for Peter because Peter
[1:22:05] was approved. He denied Christ. I was
[1:22:08] there. I heard of him myself. That's
[1:22:09] your business. Keep on recording Peter.
[1:22:11] I have a ten Christ three times.
[1:22:15] But God approved Peter in so much that
[1:22:17] righteous Cornelius, God say send for
[1:22:20] him because that man have life in him.
[1:22:23] That man have word in him. That man have
[1:22:25] the full germ in him. That man is
[1:22:27] adopted. that man house in the pillar of
[1:22:30] fire and when he had to speak the word
[1:22:32] fire coming after that word and when he
[1:22:35] saw them got the baptized with the Holy
[1:22:36] Ghost he said they get the same one we
[1:22:38] receive Peter confirm it was the same
[1:22:41] baptism and them guys ain't even
[1:22:42] baptized yet oh give the Lord a shout in
[1:22:44] the house
[1:22:47] glory so God had labor pains to bring
[1:22:52] forth you forthought he had labor pains
[1:22:55] to do that to position play you he said
[1:22:57] when we come from the land garlic lands
[1:22:59] of Egypt through sanctification and is
[1:23:01] baptized into the promised land for the
[1:23:04] promise is the Holy Ghost. What's the
[1:23:06] promise? Shout it out. What's the
[1:23:08] promise? Holy Ghost. That's the promised
[1:23:09] land. The Holy Ghost. So, Canaan land
[1:23:11] represent Holy Ghost. That's the
[1:23:13] promise. Isn't that right? Ephesians
[1:23:15] 4:30. He's reading. You see, Obama, I'm
[1:23:17] putting him back in word. He said that
[1:23:19] and he put Ephesians 4:30. Grieve not
[1:23:21] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[1:23:23] sealed until the day of your redemption.
[1:23:25] Then God having predestinated the church
[1:23:28] and all the peoples here we go there
[1:23:31] will be millions time millions that will
[1:23:34] walk very religious and be deceived.
[1:23:37] Amen. Amen. So we know that they had
[1:23:39] their place already. The only ones are
[1:23:42] you ready now?
[1:23:43] The only ones that will not be deceived
[1:23:47] will be those who have come over into
[1:23:49] the promised land who before the
[1:23:51] foundation of the world had their name
[1:23:53] spoken in the land book of life and has
[1:23:55] come over to the promised land and
[1:23:56] enjoying it.
[1:23:59] You hear what he said? You had to be
[1:24:01] enjoying it. You enjoying this land.
[1:24:04] You're enjoying every trial, every
[1:24:05] testing, everything come. Nothing moving
[1:24:07] you. Nothing has shaken you. You come
[1:24:09] too far to turn back now. This land is
[1:24:11] your land. You're not mixing it with
[1:24:13] unbelief. You're laboring to enter into
[1:24:16] that rest. I say, let us labor tonight.
[1:24:19] Let us fight tonight. You catch a
[1:24:20] revelation. Fight for your prayer life.
[1:24:22] Fight for your joy. Fight for everything
[1:24:24] that God released in this hour for you.
[1:24:27] Here we go. Let's go. Many people are
[1:24:30] afraid you're going to act funny. Many
[1:24:33] people are afraid the Holy Ghost will
[1:24:35] make you lose something. You'll be
[1:24:37] ashamed of people. Many people are
[1:24:39] afraid they will cry and their
[1:24:41] sweetheart will see them crying or mama
[1:24:44] or your neighbor or your boss will see
[1:24:46] you. Let me tell you about a man one
[1:24:48] time before closing. I say amen. I not
[1:24:51] closing yet. There's a man named David
[1:24:54] and when the ark of God has been done in
[1:24:55] the Philistine land come across pulled
[1:24:58] by a ark old ox pulling. When David saw
[1:25:00] the ark coming he had a little gong on
[1:25:02] him he run out there. He kick his feet
[1:25:04] in the air, jump around, scream, jump,
[1:25:07] dance, jump, dance. And him, the king of
[1:25:09] Israel, his wife, looked out the window
[1:25:11] and saw him acting so strange, she
[1:25:13] despised him. She must have said, "The
[1:25:15] idiot."
[1:25:17] Still reading. Look at him out there
[1:25:19] acting three feet in the air, jumping,
[1:25:21] acting like that. He must be crazy. That
[1:25:23] night when he come in, she said in words
[1:25:25] like this, "Why? You embarrass me."
[1:25:28] That's how some wives are talking. And
[1:25:30] ashamed their husband, trying to shame
[1:25:32] their head. You embarrassed me. Why you
[1:25:34] the king? My husband out there doing
[1:25:35] like that. He said, "Tomorrow I'll do
[1:25:38] better than that." Don't you know I was
[1:25:41] dancing unto the Lord. He crossed over.
[1:25:44] He was in the land of promise. What does
[1:25:46] that mean? You need a promise sit down
[1:25:48] dead like a don like if he's a Catholic
[1:25:51] and a Methodist or a Jew witness kingdom
[1:25:53] hall.
[1:25:55] That what the message come down to now.
[1:25:56] Kingdom halls when man only bringing
[1:25:58] word 4 hours 5 hours and people sit down
[1:26:01] there dead somehow sleeping and when
[1:26:03] they sleeping so they say the word coin
[1:26:04] subconscious
[1:26:07] demons morph morphus all kind of demons
[1:26:10] sitting on the top lip they can't even
[1:26:11] praise God and worship brother Brandham
[1:26:13] said David he crossed over into the land
[1:26:16] that is why he was dancing how God could
[1:26:19] be in the camp and there's no shout when
[1:26:21] God in the camp the shout of the king
[1:26:24] what did the Bible tell Psalm
[1:26:27] The voice of rejoicing is in the tablock
[1:26:29] of the righteous. The Lord had chasened
[1:26:31] me sore, but he hath not given me over
[1:26:34] unto death. Open unto me the gates of
[1:26:36] righteousness, and I shall be coming
[1:26:37] unto them. The gates that the righteous
[1:26:39] shall enter. The stone that the refused
[1:26:42] has become the hest of the corner. This
[1:26:44] is the Lord's doing. It's marvelous in
[1:26:46] our lives. This is the day that the Lord
[1:26:48] had made. We will rejoice and be glad in
[1:26:51] it.
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:58] Glory.
[1:27:00] Glory.
[1:27:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I
[1:27:05] am not expecting we about to leave here
[1:27:07] and when you talk to the church and
[1:27:09] everybody pressure boy
[1:27:12] pressure
[1:27:14] but say the bride will leave here
[1:27:15] shouting.
[1:27:17] Your testimony got be pressure.
[1:27:19] Everything is pressure boy.
[1:27:22] That's unbelief. You know, that's
[1:27:24] unbelief speaking. You know, like Satan
[1:27:26] saying, "Come on, it's pressure."
[1:27:28] Come on, say, say it again. Hallelujah.
[1:27:32] Things rough, boy. Things super rough.
[1:27:36] And Satan, they anointing you.
[1:27:40] And you think it's God? You think you
[1:27:41] have a testimony there? Say this
[1:27:46] because a powerful testimony. Some
[1:27:49] people done her wrong and she knew she
[1:27:51] was right and they're treating her badly
[1:27:54] and she said, "Lord, I don't have that
[1:27:56] heart to forgive them." She knows she
[1:27:58] have to forgive. She said, "But I'm
[1:28:00] going to apply it. I'm going to pray for
[1:28:02] them." I love that. So, she choose not
[1:28:06] to say, "Well, you know, I have a heart.
[1:28:08] This how I am. I see all I am." No,
[1:28:11] she's showing flexibility.
[1:28:13] She She's not showing the rigidity. This
[1:28:15] is how I am. I can't forgive them now.
[1:28:16] They're too wicked. No, you got to pray
[1:28:19] for them. You got And you see, you can't
[1:28:21] pray and be against somebody who you're
[1:28:23] praying for. You can't sincerely pray
[1:28:25] for somebody. I don't care what they do.
[1:28:26] And you said to pray for them. Lord,
[1:28:28] help them. They don't even know what
[1:28:29] they're doing. They they ought not to
[1:28:30] behave that way. You know why they're
[1:28:32] doing what they're doing. Bless them,
[1:28:34] Lord. Oh, God. Be merciful to them. Save
[1:28:37] them, Lord. And you're praying God's
[1:28:39] blessing upon them. And you know what?
[1:28:40] God come around and turn everything
[1:28:41] around for her. And and I'm I'm so glad
[1:28:44] to hear that kind of testimony. You know
[1:28:46] why? Because it show that somebody is
[1:28:48] applying what they hearing. They're not
[1:28:50] stiff neck in their high ears and heart.
[1:28:52] They're applying what they hearing. God
[1:28:54] was upset because the majority of people
[1:28:56] did not mix what they hear with faith.
[1:28:58] Faith have action with it. Faith is not
[1:29:00] static. Faith have drama with it. Faith
[1:29:03] is a substance. He said he that cometh
[1:29:05] to God must believe he is. And he is a
[1:29:08] rewarder of them that
[1:29:11] diligently not just seek him in a way to
[1:29:14] seek him. A way to worship, a way to
[1:29:17] praise him. When the woman asked Jesus,
[1:29:19] "Salvation of the Jews," he said,
[1:29:21] "Listen woman, the hour come and now is
[1:29:23] when the true worshippers will worship
[1:29:25] this.
[1:29:26] The father in spirit and in truth, them
[1:29:29] think they have all the worship in tong
[1:29:30] with the Jewish business." He said the
[1:29:32] hour is coming when mechanics and
[1:29:34] dynamics will be together.
[1:29:38] When you have the full revelation, then
[1:29:40] you have to have king lamb worship. When
[1:29:43] you understand what the lamb did for
[1:29:44] you, when you understand the lamb took
[1:29:46] the book to reveal to you your
[1:29:48] inheritance that you have to possess.
[1:29:50] When you understand that you have your
[1:29:51] redemptive rights to make claims or give
[1:29:53] the Lord a shout, you can't sit there
[1:29:55] like a church member. There's not a
[1:29:57] Catholic church. There's not a Baptist
[1:29:59] church. There's not a Pentecostal
[1:30:00] church.
[1:30:02] [Applause]
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:04] You have to open your mouth and make
[1:30:06] your claims.
[1:30:11] Bam. Say Jesus, I claimed them. I
[1:30:13] claimed the book for them. I died for
[1:30:15] them. I paid a price for them.
[1:30:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Then he told you
[1:30:20] and I in 10:11, go to the angel and ask
[1:30:23] for the book and take the book. You say,
[1:30:25] "Beg for the book." Take it and eat it
[1:30:28] and then prophesy from it. You have a
[1:30:30] right to prophesy over your own healing,
[1:30:32] of your own deliverance, of your own
[1:30:34] breakthrough. You have a right to
[1:30:35] prophesy for your family and your loved
[1:30:36] ones. That is your right. Don't sit down
[1:30:38] like a dumb dog in Israel. You have
[1:30:40] nothing to say. Oh, glory to God. The
[1:30:42] devil bind your mouth. Hallelujah. Glory
[1:30:45] to God. You get cut off with that silent
[1:30:47] mouth. You're saying nothing.
[1:30:50] You're saying nothing because you're in
[1:30:51] love with yourself. You're in love with
[1:30:53] your own mind and your own thoughts. The
[1:30:54] Bible say let the weak say I am strong.
[1:30:57] The Bible said that let the weak say or
[1:31:00] let your weakness say just stay weak.
[1:31:03] And after in your mind are weak are weak
[1:31:04] and they say you're really weak. You
[1:31:06] know seeing it
[1:31:09] when you see a weak so devil bring some
[1:31:10] demons to hit you and slap you up and
[1:31:12] tap you up and you're binding you
[1:31:14] walking like back slavery that's slavery
[1:31:16] going on nowhere not just in ten
[1:31:18] commandments not in Egypt and we were
[1:31:19] slaves you know slaves to all kindl
[1:31:32] they can't dance the chain connect both
[1:31:33] foot together
[1:31:35] that dance in step. They come in the
[1:31:38] message. They come in the Bible and they
[1:31:39] walk in solid steps cuz chain poke in
[1:31:42] the foot. So the steps are very
[1:31:44] measured. Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] You couldn't hold that with David. All
[1:31:49] right. Don't think of finishing now. You
[1:31:51] know, I can't warm up now. Tomorrow's
[1:31:53] holiday. Glory. Some people are afraid
[1:31:56] to receive the Holy Ghost. Afraid they
[1:31:58] might speak with tongues.
[1:32:01] But I tell you, I feel the best afraid
[1:32:02] Holy Ghost.
[1:32:04] Afraid the Holy Ghost. Bye bye bad say
[1:32:07] bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
[1:32:07] bye the holy ghost but the holy ghost
[1:32:10] afraid it the whole time holy spirit
[1:32:14] and the devil won't go near it that's
[1:32:16] the reason people fail it but it's good
[1:32:19] enough for me sir it will make you stop
[1:32:21] your lying it will save you when you're
[1:32:24] dying it will start them demons flying
[1:32:27] sir good enough for me oh God give me
[1:32:30] that old time religion
[1:32:33] time religion
[1:32:35] hallelujah Hallelujah. Glory to God. Old
[1:32:38] time religion. You You know what they
[1:32:40] love? Mary said, "Be it done unto me
[1:32:42] according to thy word." I said, "Mary
[1:32:43] sitting in your room after that
[1:32:47] stuck there." Mary said, "Be it done to
[1:32:49] me according to thy word." Then she
[1:32:51] conceive and think that nice after that
[1:32:53] after they preach that Mary get the
[1:32:55] upper room. Let me She st she fall down.
[1:32:58] Who is that? Sister Mary. She said, "I'm
[1:33:00] a Mary, mother of Jesus." Mom say Mary
[1:33:03] stay until she lose your pride. There's
[1:33:05] a quote, you know, she had to stay up
[1:33:07] there until you lose your pride. All she
[1:33:09] feel she is and how nice and where it is
[1:33:11] and people favoring she and what all has
[1:33:12] dropped. All them people to fall off,
[1:33:14] you know, that that them days they're
[1:33:17] waiting. It wasn't just waiting idling
[1:33:18] and they send it for newspapers and you
[1:33:20] know, express guardian and they want to
[1:33:21] read all about it. You know, it wasn't
[1:33:22] that it was a place and a time to get
[1:33:25] rid of self, get rid of flesh. But when
[1:33:28] I'm dramatized, some brother say, I feel
[1:33:29] we have it, you know, I feeling let him
[1:33:31] move out.
[1:33:34] Ah,
[1:33:35] Peter said, "Sit down and shut up."
[1:33:38] Because Isaiah said with stammering
[1:33:40] lips, "Yes, sir." That ain't happen yet.
[1:33:42] So, we have to wait for the fulfillment
[1:33:44] of what promise. Don't come and tell me
[1:33:46] I have what I don't have. I've got it to
[1:33:48] get and I will get it. And when I get
[1:33:50] it, I will tell you this is that that
[1:33:51] the prophet spoke of. That's what Peter
[1:33:53] said. He wasn't identifying quote only.
[1:33:56] He said, "This is that that the prophet
[1:33:57] Joel spake of. It shall come to pass
[1:33:59] afterwards. I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:34:01] all flesh." Oh, glory to God. here was
[1:34:04] poured upon 120 in the upper room. We
[1:34:06] don't have an upper room anymore. We
[1:34:07] don't have 120 in one mind, one accord,
[1:34:09] but Holy Ghost is poured out on
[1:34:10] individuals. Let me shout on that one.
[1:34:13] Glory to God. You don't have to wait for
[1:34:14] no group revelation, no group
[1:34:16] inspiration. The Holy Ghost is poured
[1:34:18] out on individuals. That is thus sayeth
[1:34:20] the Lord. I say it again. The Holy Ghost
[1:34:22] is poured on individuals. That means the
[1:34:24] Holy Ghost could pour on you tonight. It
[1:34:26] could pour on somebody watching this in
[1:34:28] their home. It could pour and dump upon
[1:34:30] them tonight. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:34:32] Give the Lord a shout.
[1:34:35] Let me see if I can finish here.
[1:34:38] [Music]
[1:34:39] Listen to brother. Brother, I believe
[1:34:41] right now at this minute that the power
[1:34:43] of the Holy Ghost that's in this room to
[1:34:45] cheer every sick person there is and you
[1:34:48] can feel the cloud the size of a man
[1:34:50] hand. Scream and holler. Amen. What say
[1:34:54] holler? I hear the song of perfect
[1:34:55] healing. If you reject and say, "Well, I
[1:34:58] didn't get nothing." Then they will die
[1:34:59] out. the hot ways of hell and doubt will
[1:35:01] fade out of your soul. But when you get
[1:35:03] that little grain of seed, stand on it
[1:35:05] like the rock of Dalar. He said, "You
[1:35:07] are God's child. Satan has put that
[1:35:09] affliction upon you and you know and
[1:35:12] Christ has already healed every one of
[1:35:14] you."
[1:35:15] Let me run a little bit. Are you ready?
[1:35:17] A sinner come to the altar and say,
[1:35:18] "Brother Brandon, I want you to pray for
[1:35:20] me. I want to be good. You pray for me."
[1:35:22] And he going back to his seat. Next
[1:35:24] night, how many wants to be saved? He
[1:35:25] stands up. You want to be saved, young
[1:35:27] man? Yes, sir. Well, why don't you get
[1:35:29] saved? I don't know. He said the devil
[1:35:31] is holding that boy. That's all he wants
[1:35:34] to do right. There's a spirit. There's a
[1:35:36] power that won't let him do right now.
[1:35:39] Hallelujah. Here it is. No wonder God
[1:35:41] would never let a true man of God ever
[1:35:43] say he could heal somebody. And God
[1:35:45] can't save you. He already done it. The
[1:35:48] only thing you have to do is accept it.
[1:35:50] He already done it. I wasn't saved 20
[1:35:52] years ago. I was saved 1900 years ago.
[1:35:54] But 20 years ago, I received it and
[1:35:57] accepted it. Oh, praise God. The only
[1:35:59] thing that kept me from being saved when
[1:36:01] I was 12 years old because a spirit hung
[1:36:04] over me. A devil saying wait a little
[1:36:06] longer. That's the reason you wasn't
[1:36:08] saved. When you become the age of
[1:36:09] accountability, a spirit you got with a
[1:36:12] crowd has hovered over you, kept hanging
[1:36:14] over you. You wanted to do right.
[1:36:16] There's not a man that's got his right
[1:36:18] man that wants to do right. But there is
[1:36:20] something that won't let you do right.
[1:36:22] That's the devil. Hallelujah. You get
[1:36:24] ready. Here we go. He commissioned his
[1:36:26] church to cast them devils out. There
[1:36:28] you are. In my name shall cast out
[1:36:31] devils. You ain't going to heal nobody.
[1:36:33] You're going to cast the devil away from
[1:36:34] them so they can accept the healing that
[1:36:36] has already been done. So people come to
[1:36:38] church and it's devils on them. We're
[1:36:40] going to call them devils out. We're
[1:36:42] going to cast them out. We're going to
[1:36:44] rebuke them devils out. We're going to
[1:36:45] preach the gospel until people be free.
[1:36:47] That's what the gospel is about. Give
[1:36:49] the Lord some praises. There we go.
[1:36:51] Let's But Ram nail it with this one.
[1:36:53] Preacher, stood on the platform. preach
[1:36:55] the gospel. Devil scatter. The man come
[1:36:57] to the altar under conviction. I want to
[1:36:59] get saved. He never saved the man. He
[1:37:01] cast out the devil. And that's how the
[1:37:02] man got saved.
[1:37:05] And here nailing it down. Now, that's
[1:37:06] the same thing by divine healing. You
[1:37:09] sick people here this morning. Believe
[1:37:11] that you have been born again as sons
[1:37:12] out of God. Christ has already healed
[1:37:14] you. The only thing keeping from being
[1:37:15] well this morning is a spirit hanging
[1:37:18] over you that won't fully fully let you
[1:37:21] go out yonder and believe God's promise
[1:37:23] that he done it. That's right. That's my
[1:37:25] commission. Here we go. That's what God
[1:37:27] gave me. Is what he gave every gospel
[1:37:29] preacher who would believe him. The
[1:37:31] power and authority to break that
[1:37:33] spirit. That is what God give behind the
[1:37:36] pulpit. The power and the authority to
[1:37:38] break that spirit that is hindering you
[1:37:40] from your deliverance, hinding you from
[1:37:42] your healing, hindering you from being
[1:37:43] set free. The power and authority he
[1:37:45] give every gospel preacher. Give the
[1:37:48] Lord a shout in the house. Glory.
[1:37:51] So brother the anointing here now he
[1:37:53] said I believe with all my heart that
[1:37:55] every demon power that in here this
[1:37:57] minute is already broken. I believe
[1:37:59] there's every sick person here right now
[1:38:00] feels a lot different. He said if that
[1:38:02] is right raise up your hand. You who are
[1:38:04] sick. What's the matter? The devil has
[1:38:06] broke away from you. He has to because
[1:38:08] faith come by hearing and hearing the
[1:38:10] word of God. So he's on the anointing
[1:38:11] now. You can be healed right now to
[1:38:13] fulfill that commission. You people that
[1:38:14] are sick this morning while the spirit
[1:38:16] is upon you while you feel the spirit of
[1:38:19] God. Oh glory to God. Hallelujah. He's
[1:38:21] showing them to ride the anointing and
[1:38:23] to claim the healing and breakthrough
[1:38:24] deliverance.
[1:38:29] I'm going to skip out.
[1:38:33] All right.
[1:38:35] Music come, please. I'll skip some
[1:38:36] things. Hallelujah.
[1:38:40] Hallelujah.
[1:38:43] You talking about Ephesus here, settle
[1:38:45] like Joshua, Ephraim here, Manisa here.
[1:38:47] He divided the land. Each one of those
[1:38:49] Hebrews mothers. I'm almost done. Music
[1:38:51] come, please. Each one of those Hebrew
[1:38:52] mothers giving birth to those children,
[1:38:54] she spoke the very place in her labor
[1:38:56] pains where they'll be positioned in the
[1:38:58] promised land. Yes, sir. He said, "Watch
[1:39:01] each of those mothers when she called
[1:39:02] out Ephraim, she was in labor,
[1:39:05] positionally plac him where his feet is
[1:39:07] set in oil." Joshua, not knowing this,
[1:39:10] but by inspiration, led of the Holy
[1:39:12] Spirit. After being into the promised
[1:39:14] land, give each man his promise exactly
[1:39:16] what the Holy Spirit promised through
[1:39:17] the birth back there. how that God has
[1:39:21] set some in the church through their
[1:39:23] labor pains. Oh, they get tremendous
[1:39:26] sometimes. And then he said this, when a
[1:39:29] church I can't remember how much time I
[1:39:31] quote this, but I'm quoting it fresh
[1:39:33] tonight. When a church is groaning under
[1:39:36] the persecution of the outside world,
[1:39:38] believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[1:39:41] promise of the Holy Ghost is not what
[1:39:44] these message believers and message
[1:39:45] preachers teaching now. them to
[1:39:47] preaching a different kind of Holy
[1:39:48] Ghost. That the promise of the Holy
[1:39:50] Ghost is just as real to us as it was to
[1:39:54] Pentecost, how they grown and cry on
[1:39:57] labor pains. But when they are born and
[1:40:01] positionally born into the kingdom of
[1:40:04] God, then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[1:40:06] church. Some apostles, some prophets,
[1:40:08] some teachers, some pastors, some
[1:40:10] evangelists. Then ministers claiming all
[1:40:13] kind of power and all kind of position
[1:40:14] now. But he say when it going to be born
[1:40:16] and positionally born. How? By labor
[1:40:20] pains. How? Under labor pains. There is
[1:40:23] no way we could es escape it. God had
[1:40:26] labor pains to position place for you.
[1:40:27] Yes, sir. You have pos labor pains to
[1:40:30] get in your position. Oh, give the Lord
[1:40:32] some praises. I'm done tonight.
[1:40:37] All right. Let me close with this here.
[1:40:40] Just two more pieces and I'll close.
[1:40:43] You woman out there with painted
[1:40:44] fingernails. $50 coat wrap around
[1:40:46] you$100 $100 dress on and you can't
[1:40:49] kneel long. You won't skip then call
[1:40:53] yourself the Holy Ghost church. You need
[1:40:54] to be ashamed of yourself and repent.
[1:40:57] What we need tonight is this bunch of
[1:41:00] impersonating the Holy Ghost. This bunch
[1:41:01] of people impersonating the Pentecostal
[1:41:03] church or to hit the sort of stra down
[1:41:05] here and mourn under that until God
[1:41:09] comes down and give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:11] What we need tonight, this blessed
[1:41:13] Pentecostal impersonators, he said the
[1:41:15] altar is open. He said the sword of stra
[1:41:18] is ready. If you want a revival, start
[1:41:21] it in your own soul.
[1:41:24] The shame, impersonating, acting like
[1:41:26] the rest of the churches went out for
[1:41:27] Babylon. Half cousin running around. He
[1:41:30] said, "God bless your people come to the
[1:41:31] altar." So they told me I preached two
[1:41:33] hours, I done it again tonight. Let me
[1:41:35] tell you something, brother. You're
[1:41:37] either marked in or marked out. If you
[1:41:39] got a bit of spirit about you tonight
[1:41:41] that you know that you are wrong,
[1:41:44] there's the old solders trail and a
[1:41:46] moers's best down here for you to stay
[1:41:48] there. Here we go. And moan and groan
[1:41:52] under the labor pains until God come
[1:41:55] down and fill you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:41:56] When I say hear that things like that,
[1:41:58] moan and groan. Anybody moaning and
[1:42:00] groaning? Those words are not spoken any
[1:42:02] morning message. moan and groan
[1:42:06] on the labor pains
[1:42:08] until God comes and fill you with the
[1:42:11] Holy Ghost. Begin to speak something.
[1:42:13] You say you're excited. How do you know
[1:42:15] about Asuza Street? You are not 50 years
[1:42:17] old. What are you talking about street?
[1:42:18] I know. I don't know very much, but I
[1:42:20] know somebody who knows everything and
[1:42:23] he's able to tell us. I know the
[1:42:25] Pentecostal church needs a Holy Ghost
[1:42:26] revival. Yes, sir. Not a bunch of music
[1:42:29] with bunch of painted up clunks. You
[1:42:31] need to get out of your cycle turtle
[1:42:34] self and come down to the altar and
[1:42:36] repent like the rest of the sinners
[1:42:38] does. He's talking to church folks now.
[1:42:41] I know you think I'm beside myself, but
[1:42:42] I'm not. How many here would like to
[1:42:45] have an experience like that? Raise your
[1:42:47] hands. Everybody in here would like to
[1:42:50] have an experience. This altar is open.
[1:42:53] You're invited to come here and kneel
[1:42:55] with me. And preachers, get yourself
[1:42:57] ready and get the starch out of you.
[1:42:59] This is brother Bana rebuking the
[1:43:00] preachers for the starch. Get over here
[1:43:03] and let's kneel around. God bless you.
[1:43:05] Let's have a revival. Oh father God, I
[1:43:08] thank you. Let's all stand. I thank you
[1:43:09] for your presence tonight in the word.
[1:43:11] God, you had your labor and it's time
[1:43:14] for us to labor. Father, it's the law of
[1:43:16] life. It takes labor to bring forth. A
[1:43:20] woman wed in travail has much sorrow,
[1:43:22] but when she bring forth is joy. Oh God,
[1:43:24] we know that the Messiah will be born
[1:43:26] and we know this word will be born into
[1:43:28] manifestation. Oh God, may it start
[1:43:30] tonight in Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[1:43:33] God bless you. Hallelujah.
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:41] Oh, praise him. Thank you Jesus. Thank
[1:43:44] you Lord. Thank you Lord. Thank you
[1:43:46] Lord. Thank you Lord. Give him praise
[1:43:49] tonight. Give him praise. Give him
[1:43:52] praise. Give him praise. Thank you
[1:43:54] Jesus.
[1:43:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:58] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you
[1:44:01] Lord Jesus. Thank you father. Praise the
[1:44:04] name of the Lord. Praise the name of the
[1:44:06] Lord. Glory to God. Thank you Jesus.
