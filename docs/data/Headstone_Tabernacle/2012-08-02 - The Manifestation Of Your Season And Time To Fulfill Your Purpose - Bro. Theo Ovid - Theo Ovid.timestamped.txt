[5:55] changing and transforming hearts and
[5:56] lives
[5:57] in jesus name i ask it
[6:00] amen god bless you
[6:02] everybody bibles i get into luke 8
[6:06] reading from verse 11 to 15 and romans
[6:09] chapter 8
[6:11] luke 8
[6:12] and romans chapter 8
[6:15] scripture reading tonight
[6:24] i know we took the scripture from
[6:26] matthew 13 and the camp but i want to
[6:28] take it from luke
[6:30] chapter 8. i'm doing that on purpose
[6:36] we read
[6:37] from verse 11 no the parable is this the
[6:39] seed is the word of god those that by
[6:41] the way side are they that hear
[6:43] then commit the devil and take it away
[6:45] the word out of their hearts at least
[6:46] they should believe and be saved
[6:48] they on the rock a day which when they
[6:50] hear receive word with joy
[6:52] these have no root
[6:54] which i believe and in time of
[6:55] temptation fall away
[6:57] and that which fell among tones the day
[6:59] which when they have heard
[7:01] go forth and are choked with cares and
[7:04] riches and pleasures of this life
[7:06] and bring no fruit
[7:08] to perfection
[7:10] but on good ground
[7:12] are they which are in an honest and good
[7:14] heart
[7:15] having heard the word keep it i bring it
[7:18] forth fruit with patience i want you to
[7:20] note the word patience did bringing
[7:22] forth fruit
[7:23] with patience
[7:24] we want to turn to romans chapter eight
[7:27] i want to read from verse
[7:29] 28
[7:30] it reads
[7:32] and we know that all things work
[7:33] together for good to them that love god
[7:35] to them who are decalled according to
[7:38] his purpose
[7:39] for whom he did for know
[7:41] he did predestinate to be conformed to
[7:43] the image of his son
[7:44] that he might be the first born among
[7:46] many brethren so that's what jesus
[7:48] supposed to be the first born
[7:50] among many brethren
[7:52] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[7:54] he also called whom he called demi also
[7:57] justified and whom he justified then he
[8:00] also glorified what shall we then say to
[8:03] these things if god before us who can be
[8:06] against us he that spared not his own
[8:08] son
[8:09] but delivered him up for us all how
[8:11] shall he not with him also freely give
[8:14] us all things who shall lay anything to
[8:16] charge of god's elect it is god
[8:19] justified who is he that condemned it is
[8:21] christ that dying he rather that is
[8:22] risen again who is deemed at the right
[8:25] hand of god who also make it
[8:26] intercession for us who shall separate
[8:29] us from the love of christ shall
[8:30] tribulation or distress or persecution
[8:33] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[8:36] for it is written for thy sake we are
[8:38] killed all the day long we are counted
[8:40] as sheep for the slaughter name in all
[8:42] these things we are more than conquerors
[8:44] to him that loved us for i am persuaded
[8:46] that neither death nor life nor angels
[8:49] no principalities nor powers nor things
[8:51] present nor things to come nor height
[8:53] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[8:56] be able to separate us from the love of
[8:57] god which is in christ jesus our lord
[9:00] let's pray father are we thank you for
[9:01] your word tonight and we are so blessed
[9:04] lord to hear these powerful scriptures
[9:06] i pray father god that your presence
[9:08] will just have the preeminences and may
[9:10] your word come to light and life tonight
[9:12] in jesus name i ask it amen you may be
[9:14] seated oh praise god
[9:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[9:21] praise god
[9:23] and uh
[9:25] i will take a little inspiration from
[9:28] uh equally as yes shriva swan to
[9:30] everything there's a season and time
[9:32] to every purpose on the heaven
[9:34] and i'll connect that to romans 8 28
[9:37] and i'll have a title the manifestation
[9:40] of your season and time
[9:42] to fulfill your purpose
[9:46] the manifestation of your season and
[9:48] time
[9:49] to fulfill
[9:50] your purpose
[9:52] amen
[9:53] who praise god so don't be too
[9:56] uh anxious
[9:58] you have to have patience
[10:00] that that seed going to come ripe and
[10:02] mature
[10:03] in the camp i wanted to emphasize 34 64
[10:06] 100 full to show
[10:08] that once the seed strike good growing
[10:11] it will bring forth
[10:12] it might bring to the measure of you
[10:14] know of a hundred percent but it's to be
[10:16] 30 it'll be sexy you'll get your measure
[10:19] you will get your harvest but tonight i
[10:22] want to kind of emphasize that patience
[10:24] because the bible talk about the husband
[10:26] man waited for the fruit of the earth
[10:29] and he had long patience
[10:31] you see when you plant something you
[10:33] can't be so excited to try to pull the
[10:35] fruit out of the tree
[10:36] the fruit have to unfold the life have
[10:39] to unfold and the fruit will come into
[10:41] course
[10:42] now if you don't plant you don't reap
[10:45] if you don't plant you have no house but
[10:47] if you plant you have to wait
[10:49] can somebody say amen
[10:51] you have to wait as we set the sow and
[10:53] forth to sow and as he keeps sowing the
[10:56] birds take some we say don't stop at the
[10:58] birds don't let the birds throw you off
[11:00] track that bird is just that's what they
[11:02] do they take some they cut all
[11:04] some fall among rocks not all will fall
[11:06] among the rocks just some will fall
[11:08] among rocks isn't that right some will
[11:10] get tied up with torns just some not all
[11:12] but some will fall on good ground
[11:14] so your duty is to keep on sowing keep
[11:17] on believing keep on planting keep on
[11:20] pressing all might not hold tonight but
[11:22] some going to hold some day
[11:24] someday something going to strike you
[11:26] something going to open up something
[11:27] gonna break up on you revelation gonna
[11:29] break up on you you don't know when
[11:31] tonight maybe your night tonight maybe a
[11:33] special night you could make this a
[11:35] special night if you declare it to be so
[11:38] you can have to speak at first like that
[11:40] man who was half blind and they wanted
[11:41] to know what room to take him in he said
[11:42] this room would be perfect they
[11:44] described they said oh you know he said
[11:45] i make it so
[11:47] praise god and you could make this night
[11:48] your night because you choose it to be
[11:50] so you declare it to be so that's what
[11:53] our father did he said let there be he
[11:55] didn't argue with the darkness he didn't
[11:57] say don't kill us and he said let there
[11:59] be and he just waited until it beat
[12:02] praise god he waited for the season on
[12:04] time because once god said let there be
[12:06] have a season in time for that seed to
[12:08] come to life but every seed must bring
[12:11] forth after its kind it's a law built in
[12:15] built in just like summer is built in an
[12:17] autumn is built in and winter is built
[12:19] in and spring is built in and nobody
[12:21] could stop the season and time because
[12:24] god said that in the heavens and man is
[12:26] on earth and they can't change what god
[12:28] set in the heavens and thy word of lord
[12:30] is settle forever in the heavens and
[12:32] once that word is settled man and it
[12:34] can't change it so once god
[12:36] predestinated you unto his purpose and
[12:39] as all things work together for good to
[12:41] them not love god to them who would be
[12:44] called according to his purpose and if
[12:46] you were called according to his purpose
[12:48] i don't care what road you have to pass
[12:50] you through i don't care what we have to
[12:52] pass you through you're gonna come true
[12:55] nothing's gonna separate you from the
[12:57] purpose that god elected you and
[12:59] predestinated you
[13:01] nothing will separate you from the love
[13:03] of god in christ jesus not tribulation
[13:06] not nakedness not poverty not depression
[13:09] not frustration not family issues not
[13:12] mind that not even sin praise god
[13:14] because
[13:15] he called and we call he justify what
[13:19] more shall we say the night of these
[13:21] things if god before us
[13:24] who can be against us it's time you
[13:27] recognize god is for you
[13:29] because somebody's saying
[13:30] can somebody give a shout out prayers
[13:33] you see all the holy spirit tied all
[13:35] together to everything there's a season
[13:37] and time to every purpose
[13:40] give god a shout out pray
[13:46] oh hallelujah
[13:49] hallelujah
[13:50] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[13:53] glory to god amen
[13:55] it's a powerful thing to plant
[14:00] and watch the life unfold
[14:03] hallelujah
[14:04] so if god want to show down the devil's
[14:07] kingdom
[14:08] he just have to put in a seed
[14:11] a virgin shall conceive
[14:14] you didn't hear me tonight
[14:16] when he wanted to destroy and erect the
[14:18] devil's kingdom he had to put a seed so
[14:21] he said a virgin shall conceive and be a
[14:23] child his name shall be called wonderful
[14:26] counselor may be lasting father prince
[14:30] mighty god prince of peace what god did
[14:32] he put a seed
[14:33] into in mary's womb
[14:36] hallelujah hallelujah to bruise that
[14:39] devil hallelujah to knock that sip on
[14:41] his head isn't that right he put the
[14:43] seed among child christ jesus and when
[14:46] he warned the sinner a message in this
[14:48] day to bring a revival in this day all
[14:50] you have to do is to put the seed he
[14:52] said the bride had no revival is here it
[14:54] will take them seven thunders and he
[14:56] will send it he promised it he just had
[14:59] to book a seed or come on same as
[15:02] somebody and when god took the prophet
[15:04] off the devil thought it was cut off but
[15:06] he sent an apostle behind the prophet to
[15:08] keep putting on that speed some fell on
[15:16] i feel tonight that that spoken word
[15:19] which is the original seed has found
[15:22] some good wrong in trinidad
[15:24] oh hallelujah i believe tonight we are
[15:27] ready for the rain i believe tonight you
[15:30] are ready for your season and your time
[15:33] to manifest your purpose give the lord
[15:35] some praise as people
[15:40] you want to be seated
[15:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[15:45] so i trust that when you raise your
[15:46] hands up to god
[15:48] to worship you understand what you're
[15:50] doing when you raise up your hands to
[15:52] god to worship you are rarely watering
[15:55] your seed
[15:56] you have no excuse right now tonight you
[15:58] are breaking into revelation the same
[16:01] camel that rebecca water was the same
[16:05] camel that took her to isaac and the
[16:07] same word
[16:09] we are watering tonight it's the same
[16:11] power not going to take us to where
[16:14] we're supposed to go so you better start
[16:16] worshiping you better forget your
[16:18] problems and forget in your situation
[16:20] i'm trying to figure it out and we're
[16:22] going to praise god and join them in the
[16:24] revelation chapter 5 when they say
[16:26] worthy is the lamb for those redeemed us
[16:29] from now that night blood and we shall
[16:32] reign on the earth god don't care about
[16:34] your problems this morning he care about
[16:36] your praises because your praises will
[16:39] bring the water to water they see in you
[16:42] and that will solve your problem come on
[16:44] same as somebody stop studying the
[16:47] problem study the seed come on say him
[16:49] and somebody
[16:51] oh get the lord some glory
[16:56] hallelujah
[16:58] you may be seated
[17:00] hallelujah
[17:02] and as we grow in god
[17:05] and grow in grace it will become simpler
[17:08] and simpler
[17:11] not more complex
[17:12] it's become very simple
[17:15] but i'm saying this way from jesus to
[17:16] revelation could be described as wood
[17:18] made flesh
[17:20] full
[17:22] word made flesh
[17:24] god wants to get something done he have
[17:25] to put a seed he can't help it because
[17:27] his word is taught express
[17:30] his thinking have to be expressed by
[17:33] word
[17:34] and once his word is seed
[17:36] so but the branham preacher messages
[17:37] spoken word is original seed it have
[17:40] contrary seed have you seen how i'm
[17:42] calling america
[17:43] all i could do is eat it you can't sweat
[17:45] back because this man that man tamper
[17:48] with that and once a man tamper with
[17:50] that it corrupt i will say once you're
[17:52] born of a woman you're subjected to
[17:53] death
[17:54] you want to promise or anything else but
[17:56] death
[17:57] unless it comes to the rapture time when
[17:58] you're going to be changed in a moment
[18:00] and that's what we're all looking
[18:01] forward for
[18:02] and if it's not us it's somebody else
[18:04] but for the meantime we're under the law
[18:06] of debt isn't that right but we have
[18:08] life within us
[18:09] by the word now you can only overcome by
[18:11] the word you can't overcome my ethics by
[18:14] education by degrees you can only
[18:16] overcome by the word not by philosophy
[18:18] not by tv only overcome by the word so
[18:21] the devil his job is to keep you away
[18:23] from the word
[18:24] is not right but to be bright you have
[18:26] to accept the atonement in his fullness
[18:28] which is the fullness of the word and
[18:30] once you accept the fullness of the word
[18:32] it means that you are to be born his
[18:33] image you have to come into the fullness
[18:35] of his image which is his image and
[18:37] likeness he's not only predecimate to
[18:39] you but unto a purpose who he formerly
[18:41] called who he called it justified who
[18:43] justified he had already glorified isn't
[18:44] that right isn't that right
[18:46] blessed be the name of the lord watch he
[18:49] predestinated what to be conformed to
[18:52] the image of his son
[18:55] so in reality you are to be my you have
[18:58] to manifest the word image
[19:00] you have to come into the world image in
[19:02] other words you have to become the word
[19:04] to be bride
[19:06] hallelujah all else is just church
[19:08] members
[19:10] glory
[19:11] oh this is good this is very good all
[19:13] else is jewish members you understand
[19:15] abraham ishmael too
[19:17] not only isaac you understand that
[19:19] ishmael
[19:20] have a great generation nation and so
[19:23] all the arabs and all them all what is
[19:24] abraham c2 but you ishmael
[19:27] hallelujah is still fighting today isaac
[19:29] versus ishmael the battle is on so it
[19:32] will be bright versus church members
[19:37] so you can study the church members you
[19:39] have to want to be born into
[19:41] manifestation
[19:42] to be bright
[19:46] hello hallelujah hallelujah are you with
[19:48] me
[19:48] glory
[19:50] do you understand that the hundred and
[19:52] forty four thousands are elected seeds
[19:55] that are the generation coming from
[19:57] abraham
[19:58] that god recognized out of different
[20:00] tribes
[20:02] that's god seeing the generation after
[20:04] generation he know them by name he said
[20:07] ten thousand from this tribe ten
[20:08] thousand from that tribe ten thousand a
[20:11] hundred and forty four thousand by name
[20:14] oh hallelujah notice when people are
[20:17] called they are called by name
[20:19] who inform you he called he called you
[20:21] by name
[20:22] but not your literal name is the mystery
[20:24] of the book being unfolded to you that
[20:27] reveals your name to you and when you
[20:29] see your name your husband can't keep
[20:31] you your bride can't keep it children
[20:33] can't keep your mama brother you have
[20:34] nothing to do with them
[20:36] it's not a family business going running
[20:39] it's an individual affair
[20:44] i just
[20:46] love it i just love it
[20:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[20:52] somebody tell a family boo and they hold
[20:53] by all them
[20:55] revelation nice people echoing back the
[20:57] boo
[20:58] i see him back what somebody said who
[20:59] family talked to the same talk same here
[21:01] when when you go family wrong when one
[21:03] person wrong let's get a wrong message
[21:05] you will finally have a wrong message
[21:06] because there's no revelation there but
[21:08] when you understand that you as an
[21:10] individual have to get revelation and
[21:14] revelation is to rock that the ability
[21:15] to use upon then you can't bother what
[21:17] your brothers say what your mother say
[21:19] what your father say what your sister
[21:21] say what nobody say because you are
[21:23] individual and i have to have revelation
[21:26] and that's the fate that you have to
[21:28] approach god to get your breakthrough

[27:41] his brother peter that they know all
[27:43] these years only to find out somebody
[27:45] else was sitting on that man's throne
[27:47] that throne went from heaven to christ
[27:50] and that children from christ into peter
[27:52] and nobody could see him touch him
[27:54] but angels brought back and forth where
[27:57] he walked angels walking
[27:59] you understand why the angels walk with
[28:01] these men you understand when they went
[28:03] to prison the angel was with them
[28:05] wherever they went the lord himself went
[28:07] with them wherever wherever wherever it
[28:10] doesn't matter if they go in the grocery
[28:12] it doesn't matter if they go in the
[28:13] supermarket wherever they go god is

[36:52] big oh something let me wipe it be cold
[36:57] everybody's bowling
[36:59] my brother want to see you
[37:01] sometimes your children have been killed
[37:04] sometimes your husband will be killed
[37:06] but the problem is the thing is god
[37:08] wants to break out sometimes the balls
[37:10] have been killed co-workers have been
[37:11] killed childs have been killed fire burn
[37:14] you could be killed all kinds of
[37:16] troubles they'll bake you out
[37:18] so you get out your human spirit you
[37:20] have to trust god my trust is in you
[37:23] why because you're trusting yourself all
[37:25] the time
[37:26] listen to this i'm professional perfect
[37:28] with this this is brother branham he's
[37:30] praying he said there may be some here
[37:31] this morning lord
[37:32] that has emptied
[37:35] themselves up
[37:36] okay let me back up a little bit
[37:38] he said now and there may be others out
[37:40] into the land where these tapes will go
[37:42] where little humble women and men will
[37:43] take them into their homes and into the
[37:45] tribes out in the other lands may they
[37:47] hear lord and understand empty
[37:49] themselves up so that the holy spirit
[37:51] can fill them and there may be some even
[37:53] here this morning lord that has emptied
[37:54] himself up since we started speaking and
[37:57] has listened and has realized that they
[38:00] have trusted too much in their own
[38:02] thoughts of their own ability trusting
[38:05] in the shootness of their own
[38:07] simple human mind
[38:09] which is nothing but filthiness before
[38:12] god oh god miller just
[38:14] empty
[38:16] themselves out now humbly submitting
[38:19] themselves and come for the filling of
[38:21] the spirit
[38:23] granted lord amen you see the thing
[38:25] about it a long life's journey along the
[38:28] way
[38:28] what had happened is that people leave
[38:30] the holy spirit
[38:32] and they begin to use the cunning of
[38:34] their own mind
[38:36] and that bring on spiritual man church
[38:38] politics
[38:39] so then people begin to be manipulative
[38:42] and controlling because they want
[38:44] influence but it ended up being man's
[38:46] influence
[38:48] and not god's influence
[38:50] so then what end up happening is that
[38:52] the influence of the holy spirit become
[38:54] placed upon man
[38:56] and then now that man become a pope
[38:58] eventually then all of god's presence
[39:01] that's supposed to be among the people
[39:03] end up upon iman that become antichrist
[39:06] spirit isn't that right but god is a god
[39:08] of the orient so he want to release his
[39:10] spirit
[39:12] among the people
[39:13] because he want to manifest himself as
[39:16] the god of his people
[39:18] now remember ministers supposed to be
[39:20] servants
[39:22] hallelujah not paramount people
[39:25] supposed to be servants be supposed to
[39:26] put on the apron and bring the victory
[39:28] to serve you
[39:30] it's not we are the important people you
[39:32] are
[39:33] we are the messengers to bring message
[39:35] to you
[39:37] hallelujah praise god maybe even get
[39:39] that anybody could be a minister with
[39:41] subject scriptures and read scripture
[39:43] but very few gonna be servants
[39:46] and god show me that since in cairo it
[39:48] take a certain quality to be a servant a
[39:51] servant comes to serve not to be served
[39:55] and jesus said the son of man come to
[39:57] serve not to be served and that's why in
[40:00] feet washing you have washed one on his
[40:02] feet to show that you're humbling one
[40:04] towards the other and jesus the one that
[40:06] washed your feet first
[40:09] and when peter declined he busted peter
[40:11] he said if you're david don't let me do
[40:12] this you know part of me
[40:13] praise god because his son might not
[40:15] come to be saved but to serve
[40:17] you understand that so you are very
[40:19] important to god
[40:22] why would a king die for you
[40:26] why would a king die for you and send
[40:28] messengers to give you love letters
[40:32] hallelujah every service is a love
[40:35] letter praise god every service is a
[40:37] word from god
[40:39] if you could stick me out of the way and
[40:41] recognize wait a minute what is that man
[40:43] saying to me no what is god saying to

[44:20] that means you come into the fullness of
[44:22] patience
[44:27] waiting for your fruit
[44:29] you may be seasoned
[44:30] what was it problem she couldn't wait
[44:33] the word tell them we multiply and
[44:36] replenish but god didn't tell him how
[44:39] that was a further revelation to unfold
[44:41] to them the devil coming to show evil
[44:46] and it wasn't by god's divine plan
[44:48] sex wasn't original
[44:50] in other words the spoken word supposed
[44:52] to come to speak to eve to bring forth
[44:55] another seed another spoken word son
[44:58] the devil bring it at the flesh level oh
[45:00] hallelujah that wasn't even original
[45:03] hallelujah that was not the original so
[45:05] when jesus came he said you must be born
[45:07] again of the word and the spirit in
[45:09] other words you have to come back to
[45:11] spoken word
[45:13] so he hide the seed in the gospel and he
[45:15] said we preach the gospel is foolishness
[45:19] to them who perish
[45:20] but to us who believe
[45:23] it is life
[45:24] oh give the lord some praises my god
[45:27] terry but until i'm enjoying myself
[45:30] tonight do you understand
[45:32] the power of the word was put in the
[45:35] gospel and when the gospel is preached
[45:37] the devil get hurt because the son of
[45:39] man sowing the seed in your heart and
[45:43] every seed by the night's gonna bring
[45:45] forth after kind
[45:47] give the lord some praises
[45:58] when god wanted to
[46:00] you think god couldn't let fear get a
[46:02] heart attack and let them
[46:04] run over them egyptians and beat them up
[46:07] understand this there were millions
[46:10] there were thousands and thousands of
[46:12] they were multiplying like like the sun
[46:14] on the pharaoh
[46:15] but fear you had the whip
[46:17] fear had the power you think god
[46:19] couldn't utilize it
[46:22] but when he wants to deliver he's gonna
[46:24] put a seed
[46:34] you see you see god have to get the
[46:35] right one
[46:37] what if you are the right one tonight
[46:40] help me preach i want you to i want you
[46:42] to ride with me now
[46:44] what what if you are the one god waiting
[46:45] on all this time
[46:49] one moses
[46:51] bringing out two million people
[46:53] moses is the right one
[46:55] one abraham
[46:56] shall i hide from abraham what uh what
[46:58] i'm about to do seeing his ear of the
[47:00] earth
[47:01] you you you underestimate who you are
[47:03] you you don't know who you are
[47:06] yet
[47:07] but at that day you shall know
[47:09] you don't understand you just struggling
[47:11] in your mortality and your emotions and
[47:14] your sad face or your angry face or your
[47:18] surprise face or your joy face and you
[47:20] have all these faces you make
[47:23] all these different emotions and you're
[47:25] acting up and whatnot and that has
[47:27] nothing to do with the mystery below
[47:28] that
[47:33] let me just
[47:34] pick you know see the woman at the well
[47:36] now she was depressed it's not a nice
[47:38] thing to be living yeah kind of
[47:39] concerning life everybody know
[47:41] everybody's seeing you on your contrary
[47:43] and what is not a nice thing for any
[47:45] woman to go through that and so on she's
[47:47] in that mode

[48:10] troops samaria

[48:20] so then then he began to talk to the
[48:22] woman he was sent there because her name
[48:25] was in the book and she didn't know

[56:30] she did so and so that's his one so
[56:33] peter deny christ this one do this this
[56:35] one do that oh yeah
[56:37] but hear the scriptures it's not you
[56:39] that justify it
[56:43] it's not your thoughts that justified
[56:46] it is god
[56:48] that justified
[56:50] if you hear and read what
[56:52] uh jacob did
[56:54] you want to know how he called my
[56:55] principle
[56:57] he wasn't easy
[57:00] what noah did
[57:01] what david did
[57:03] what solomon did what all them did they
[57:05] were flesh and blessed they killed him
[57:08] but it is god
[57:10] the justifier
[57:14] i love it
[57:16] that's why i know god don't have to ask
[57:17] nobody permission to bless me
[57:21] god will have to ask about the
[57:23] permission shall i bless this brother
[57:24] shall i press this is your think no
[57:26] nobody are holding your ticking papers
[57:30] nobody don't let nobody correct your
[57:32] papers that's what they want to do they
[57:34] want to judge you they want to correct
[57:36] your papers don't let them correct your
[57:37] papers let god correct the papers
[57:39] because when they brought the woman to
[57:40] jesus he said listen we have plenty
[57:42] points against her she failed this exam
[57:43] she failed his moral life we caught an
[57:45] adultery look she a complete earth
[57:51] just say okay
[57:52] why only bring all the exam people let
[57:54] me test all you and see if i'll go past
[57:56] it

[58:00] not the outside paper you're looking
[58:02] good on the outside but bring the inside
[58:04] paper let me check your paper then
[58:06] fellas say you know what i can't wait
[58:07] for this examiner i go on
[58:10] nobody will jesus correct the people
[58:13] nobody want to bring the inside paper
[58:14] which one of you without sin cast the
[58:16] full stone
[58:19] you see a car
[58:20] seagull but you could see somebody fail
[58:23] here and fall there
[58:25] they cast the hypocrisy you can't see
[58:27] somebody smiling for your face and
[58:28] stabbing on your back you can see
[58:30] somebody lying and twisting things you
[58:33] can't see that
[58:34] but unclean objective you can't see
[58:36] somebody cravage us uncomfortably
[58:38] arrogant excessive pride you can't see
[58:40] that but these are things in the spirit
[58:42] realm
[58:45] you can't see somebody filthy spirit but
[58:46] these are things in the spirit well
[58:49] so jesus and his spirit i'm seeing him
[58:50] hypocrisy the naked before him
[58:52] understand this in your clothes right
[58:54] now you
[58:56] anthony said something these adam and
[58:58] eve were so veiled with the holy ghost
[59:01] they didn't even know they were naked
[59:05] and they were
[59:06] but it was withheld from them because of
[59:08] the veil over them
[59:10] that same thing has come upon us
[59:17] we never had a veil before
[59:23] glory
[59:24] my god i'm in heavenly places tonight
[59:27] you know what is to be failed from your
[59:29] past
[59:31] and when you go in your pasture go back
[59:32] to eden
[59:40] oh jesus
[59:43] you know what it is to be chosen
[59:45] and to be seen as if you never did it
[59:50] you never sinned
[59:52] never failed
[59:54] god see you as if you never did it
[59:58] he sink it so low in a sea called the
[1:00:00] sea of forgetfulness
[1:00:02] he himself can't remember it
[1:00:08] he can't even bring it up
[1:00:11] you didn't hear me tonight this place
[1:00:13] should be exploding tonight
[1:00:14] when god dropped it in the sea of
[1:00:16] forgetfulness he himself can remember
[1:00:21] you ain't getting your mother i see or
[1:00:22] what
[1:00:24] like that some beats you know make your
[1:00:26] one find some bottle and pick it up you
[1:00:28] know that the sea of forgetfulness
[1:00:30] when it drop it drop so when jesus told
[1:00:32] that woman woman where are dying
[1:00:34] accusers
[1:00:36] she said none my lord he said neither do
[1:00:38] i condemn thee go and sin no more in
[1:00:40] other words woman you are free and who
[1:00:43] the son of man set free
[1:00:48] preach back to me
[1:00:53] let me let me wrap up here oh lord whoa
[1:00:56] i'm i'm gonna close
[1:00:58] this
[1:00:59] oh i'm trying to get you listen i'm not
[1:01:02] getting anywhere
[1:01:04] i want to read something that was to
[1:01:05] introduce what i want to preach tonight
[1:01:07] and service is over
[1:01:08] it's already done
[1:01:10] oh my my my my
[1:01:14] but god is good
[1:01:16] he wants you to understand the mystery
[1:01:19] is that you are the seed itself
[1:01:22] the pentecostal was shocked
[1:01:24] so therefore when fire and dynamics
[1:01:26] tried to penetrate all they could do is
[1:01:27] manifest tongues and so forth
[1:01:29] when you're dynamic strike you're the
[1:01:30] manifest seven living voices
[1:01:35] in other words you have to bring on the
[1:01:37] war that the devil started in heaven
[1:01:40] that fell on the earth in genesis you're
[1:01:42] taking on that empath in the last days
[1:01:46] when let's how close to this
[1:01:48] when the devil realizes the bride has
[1:01:50] escaped
[1:01:52] the bible said he will make war
[1:01:54] with the remnant of the woman's seed
[1:01:57] that is church members
[1:01:59] who haven't come into a manifestation
[1:02:01] all they have is intellectual
[1:02:04] they haven't come into the oil
[1:02:06] you see so one part
[1:02:08] is the water
[1:02:10] spirit another part spirit
[1:02:13] oil
[1:02:14] wise virgin
[1:02:17] they have the same
[1:02:18] altars
[1:02:20] they have this sacrifice
[1:02:22] but no oil
[1:02:24] the strange thing about this oil and
[1:02:26] we're going to call this oil charity the
[1:02:28] oil of charity
[1:02:31] to get charity
[1:02:33] it needs faith
[1:02:35] and that faith is based on
[1:02:38] forgiveness
[1:02:40] so therefore to access the skylight
[1:02:44] you have to come true by the kindness
[1:02:47] watch not
[1:02:49] people barely kindness
[1:02:51] no
[1:02:53] spirit
[1:02:54] apparently kind of
[1:02:56] so god
[1:02:57] has to allow
[1:02:59] people to do you wrong
[1:03:04] that's the only way for that to come
[1:03:06] forward
[1:03:08] god has to let people push you around
[1:03:10] and if you fight it yeah i don't want to
[1:03:12] push me wrong
[1:03:13] but yeah i want people to i want to push
[1:03:15] wrong i want to see how much push you
[1:03:16] could take
[1:03:18] because only the person who got to push
[1:03:20] around god could use
[1:03:25] you saying some powerful things tonight
[1:03:27] yeah could god push you around or are
[1:03:29] you like a bulldozer i am moving well
[1:03:32] goku move around you
[1:03:35] because you were moving and god wanted
[1:03:37] to move you
[1:03:39] to do the job
[1:03:41] you see you see you see when david was
[1:03:43] on the backside and dealing with the
[1:03:44] beer and the lion that's david
[1:03:46] experience god wants to move him from
[1:03:48] the back side to the front side
[1:03:50] give it right now on the back of the
[1:03:51] book
[1:03:54] because send me back all the time
[1:03:56] you're
[1:03:57] that's why you take from the back and
[1:03:58] put it on the seventh fold on the in the
[1:04:01] seventh seal so you put the thumbnails
[1:04:02] on the back you put it in front but hide
[1:04:04] it from the devil so then move david now
[1:04:07] from the back and bring him to the front
[1:04:10] to save him
[1:04:12] his father said take them roti take them
[1:04:14] sandwiches and carry it for your brother
[1:04:16] save them
[1:04:18] if david had that attitude i asked you i
[1:04:19] ain't going to see them brothers now
[1:04:21] yesterday but i already always have that
[1:04:22] brethren brethren brothers whoever it is
[1:04:25] joseph brothers this brothers that
[1:04:27] brothers always somebody have somebody
[1:04:29] against somebody and they like somebody
[1:04:30] and they could see the war among them
[1:04:32] when david reaches their way wait we're
[1:04:34] doing here
[1:04:36] who's singing about the sheep
[1:04:38] they say
[1:04:48] a bunch of frightened men you got doulas
[1:04:51] i just had to read about these giants it
[1:04:52] was scary you know 14 inch finger you
[1:04:54] could imagine
[1:04:56] he's a big guy boy
[1:04:58] are you even letting it seem unreal
[1:05:00] no i'm killing it i'm telling you it's
[1:05:02] not a big hand man you know his hand
[1:05:05] matching his hygiene
[1:05:06] he's
[1:05:18] you see you know if we are giants you
[1:05:20] never shake your head like that it's
[1:05:21] just because we don't have any physical
[1:05:23] rim that you you know you're saying i
[1:05:25] don't know but you see a giant boy
[1:05:28] 12 feet high
[1:05:30] 14 feet high there's that quite a fella
[1:05:32] face right i'm saying
[1:05:34] yeah i mean when you think clarence told
[1:05:37] him what i'm gonna do so we say whoa
[1:05:40] look at about the prince and say but
[1:05:41] prince is a big man what we see two
[1:05:43] other princes
[1:05:45] he said whoa
[1:05:47] giants
[1:05:49] so david had to have a certain god
[1:05:51] consciousness
[1:05:52] know what something he have no support
[1:05:54] for his family his brothers finally
[1:05:56] should be home to begin with now if
[1:05:58] david allah had that atmosphere of
[1:06:01] roughing up the true holy spirit
[1:06:07] oh i feel good
[1:06:09] so david had to stay in the atmosphere
[1:06:14] that's a poor house
[1:06:16] that's a bomb tonight that's a bomb
[1:06:17] that's a that's an explosion stay in the
[1:06:20] atmosphere
[1:06:22] his brothers rough him up he's still in
[1:06:24] the atmosphere
[1:06:27] then goliath come and make his boats
[1:06:30] after you come in even service morning
[1:06:32] service by the way you have no even
[1:06:33] service sunday one service
[1:06:35] although i'll have his morning service
[1:06:36] 40 days that's like terrorism you know
[1:06:38] they're like al qaeda anything else
[1:06:40] they're like
[1:06:41] senator mother fight me more on evening
[1:06:43] and you hear him every day he's coming
[1:06:45] out and every day you're getting weaker
[1:06:46] because he's getting stronger because
[1:06:48] nobody coming out you see at least if
[1:06:50] they stand up somebody and make a little
[1:06:51] show and run back nobody running
[1:06:54] nobody here coming forward to run back
[1:06:56] like that kind of embarrassing you're
[1:06:57] going at
[1:06:58] all they say who is an uncircumcision he
[1:07:01] nailed him
[1:07:03] by the word
[1:07:04] he's uncircumcised what is he doing here
[1:07:06] he don't belong to us what is he doing
[1:07:08] here he nailed him
[1:07:10] that's a seed
[1:07:14] that's a seed
[1:07:15] he was saying the right thing
[1:07:17] uncircumcised for this time challenging
[1:07:21] not saul's army
[1:07:24] david i even see in this run you see
[1:07:26] when you're seeing soul army you see you
