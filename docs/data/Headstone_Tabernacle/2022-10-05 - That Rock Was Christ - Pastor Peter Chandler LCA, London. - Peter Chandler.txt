written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone my a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed Corinthians 10 foreign and all and did all drink of that same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ amen that was Christ opher okay some things you have to accept it he hadn't been born yet but that rock was Matthew 21

witnesses to the truth your faith is your faith is your confession you've got to say so you can't have a trial for two days and then the judge sits he has to say it he has to speak it his conclusion his verdict not guilty he has to say so your faith is your verdict that you've passed on the word of God and God does keep his word amen it is a confession the Lord spoke to Peter and he said now Peter yeah what is your verdict who do you say I am what do you say about me or to use brother balham's words who do you say this is [Music] that rock was Christ who do you say this is and and Peter
