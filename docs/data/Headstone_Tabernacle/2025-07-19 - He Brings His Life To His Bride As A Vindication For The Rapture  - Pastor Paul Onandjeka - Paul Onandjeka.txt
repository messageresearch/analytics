And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fall of the earth, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon him." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God, created him male and female, [Music] And God bless them. And God say unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fall of the air, and over everything that moveth upon the earth." Let's go to Colossians chapter 3 reading from verse 10. [Music] that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor circumcision barbarian bound or free but Christ is all and in all. Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another.

And we have seen this morning and we saw him yesterday seeing God in action. because he's alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What can we say &gt;&gt; about our elders? &gt;&gt; Pastor Toposit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What can we say about Pastor Raymond Thompson? These people, these men are our we And we do appreciate them likewise with all our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother says in the seven church ages, &gt;&gt; he say all the ministry is about the supernatural. How can people say that they are Christians and then deny the supernatural? Because our God, &gt;&gt; our creator &gt;&gt; is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Elohim. &gt;&gt; Elohim &gt;&gt; is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen.

He said, "Now check the anti-dolivian wars." &gt;&gt; When God rose up and then he stretched out his hands &gt;&gt; a world that he created, &gt;&gt; he created heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; He created man. He made everything according to his great miraculous plan. And the life of God is in man. The life of God is in man. Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; The very life of God is in man. When you look at the stage of the perfect man, the faith of God, the virtue of God, the knowledge of God, &gt;&gt; the temperance of God, the precious of Jesus, and the godliness of Jesus and the kindness of Jesus when it is in you and then you are a candidate, you are a candidate for the rapture and no man and no man can dissuade you. &gt;&gt; You are a candidate for the rapture.

Amen. &gt;&gt; 537 watch is coming to the spot where the life is in the body which is the vindication. The rapture is near that. The rapture is at hand. When you see the head &gt;&gt; and the body, &gt;&gt; the headship &gt;&gt; and the body becoming one. &gt;&gt; And the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows &gt;&gt; that the body &gt;&gt; is about ready &gt;&gt; to be received &gt;&gt; through the headship &gt;&gt; to be received through the headship &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm not hearing your amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See what I mean? He has be to give life unto his body. The one that he has redeemed, &gt;&gt; the mediatorial work is done and is bringing his life to the body as authentication for the rapture. When you have his life in you, when you have the life of God, And then you are vindicated for the rapture and no man, no minister, no man can can take you back. &gt;&gt; You shall be raptured. &gt;&gt; You shall be raptured. Then no demon, no power can dissuade you. You shall be in the glory. &gt;&gt; You shall be in the glory.

He said, "But the Greek word that is used for eternal life, it is the same life meaning the life of God." The same word meaning the life of God. It is the Zoe. He that has eternal life. It is Zoe. God's own life that makes you &gt;&gt; his own son his own daughter &gt;&gt; because you are born of him. &gt;&gt; The life of God is in you then. &gt;&gt; The life of God is in you. &gt;&gt; This is it. The fedication &gt;&gt; of the rapture. It is the statue of a perfect man that is in you. And then no, no sickness can dissuade you there. &gt;&gt; And then the life of God is in your life and every demon, every demon &gt;&gt; will be under your feet. &gt;&gt; Every demon &gt;&gt; under your feet. And if you believe it &gt;&gt; and then you can stand up &gt;&gt; and you can shout a man because it is his own life. It is not your life. It is not your life. It is the very life of God. It is the life of your father. It is his glory. It is authority that is in you that is in you. And every demon &gt;&gt; will be under your feet. &gt;&gt; Every sickness, &gt;&gt; under your feet, &gt;&gt; every demon &gt;&gt; under your feet, &gt;&gt; stand up &gt;&gt; and shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every demon under your feet. No matter the sickness, no matter the sickness under your feet, every demon &gt;&gt; under your feet, even if you are sick, &gt;&gt; you are healed. &gt;&gt; You are healed. Open your mouth and confess it. &gt;&gt; Confess that you are healed. &gt;&gt; That you are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel good. &gt;&gt; Amen.

But when the life of God is in you, you can never perish. You will not perish, you shall not die, you will not perish. More than God can die, your creator cannot die. Your lord can die. Elohim can't die. And he has given unto me his life, &gt;&gt; his nature, &gt;&gt; his character, &gt;&gt; and every demon. &gt;&gt; Let there be in Trinidad. &gt;&gt; They under your feet. &gt;&gt; Stand up and shout, "Amen. You are &gt;&gt; a son of God, an offspring of God. You have the eternal life. &gt;&gt; And this is what the church needs. &gt;&gt; When God is in you, &gt;&gt; he lives in all life through you. &gt;&gt; He lives in all life through you. &gt;&gt; He lives in all his own life in you. &gt;&gt; Through you, &gt;&gt; through you. &gt;&gt; Stand up and shout. I want to see you &gt;&gt; standing up &gt;&gt; and shouting. Amen. &gt;&gt; This conventional &gt;&gt; is supernatural. &gt;&gt; It is supernatural. And then no demon, no sickness can hold you down. Disconvention is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Every demon, &gt;&gt; every sickness under your feet, &gt;&gt; you have the life. &gt;&gt; You have the life, &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Give me an amen. &gt;&gt; Born of the spirit &gt;&gt; and be separate. And the very life of God living in you, &gt;&gt; manifesting &gt;&gt; not only today &gt;&gt; or tomorrow, the rest of your days, &gt;&gt; throughout your days on this earth, every demon, even the devil himself don't have the power &gt;&gt; does not have the power in your life.

It is an inside man. Another man in your soul, in your soul, you have the pyramid and you have the life of God and you have the glory of God and you have the power of God and you have the authority of God and you can speak the word and say I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am delivered. I am redeemed. I am blessed. &gt;&gt; I am anointed. I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am blessed. &gt;&gt; And no demon will hold you down. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Surely you have the supernatural in you. God bless you, brother. Do you see? &gt;&gt; I I challenge the law of nature even the law of gravitation and this is going up and then I did and what do you do? You have you have passed from death to life by doing this and you are very you are very serious with God. You are very serious with God and then no demon can hold you down. &gt;&gt; I said this convention 2025 is a supernatural meeting. &gt;&gt; And then if you believe it, &gt;&gt; I say stand up then stand up where you are and then open your mouth and give me an amen. &gt;&gt; I said this conventional is supernatural. No matter your condition, no matter your sickness, you are healed, you are delivered, you are redeemed and you are blessed. The glory of God is in your life is in your life. Give me an amen.

When you see brother Tom, many healings in the ministry. Likewise, brother, many healings, [Music] many healings in the ministry, but they are humble and simple men. They are humble men. They are humble men. But God is using them mightily &gt;&gt; and gloriously. No demon. It can't hold them down. They are anointed. &gt;&gt; They are anointed men and they are our elders. &gt;&gt; They are our elders respect &gt;&gt; and I I I give them respect and then no demon can hold them down. Can't hold them back. They are sons of God. They are sons of God. If you believe it right, &gt;&gt; give me an amen. In this message, the queen of the south paragraph paragraph 21. &gt;&gt; Now God throughout the ages &gt;&gt; has always manifested himself through supernatural ask every reader of the Bible. All the theologians that are honest, they will tell you when the supernatural is present, it is the presence of God. It is his presence. It is the glory of God. It is the dynamic.
