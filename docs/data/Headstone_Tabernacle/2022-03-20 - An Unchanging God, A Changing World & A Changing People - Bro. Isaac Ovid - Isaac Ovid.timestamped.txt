[42:49] i'd like to go to two portions
[42:52] of scripture thank you brother anthony
[42:54] thank you musicians
[42:56] reading from the book of malachi 3
[43:00] and hebrews 13
[43:02] familiar
[43:03] passages of scripture
[43:05] this morning
[43:12] to lay a foundation
[43:26] reading malachi 3
[43:28] and reading verse 6
[43:30] for i am the lord and i change not we'll
[43:33] stop right there and hebrews 13 8
[43:37] jesus christ the same yesterday
[43:40] and today
[43:42] and forever
[43:43] may the lord have a blessing to the
[43:45] reading of his word you may be seated
[43:47] this morning
[43:48] in the presence of the lord
[43:50] i trust you appreciate all the services
[43:52] that we've been having what a mighty
[43:54] blessing you appreciate your pastor this
[43:55] morning
[43:57] amen and uh
[43:59] i want to sleep with the terence for the
[44:01] exhortation on friday night as well god
[44:03] bless you with deterrence
[44:07] so this morning i have a title
[44:11] an unchanging god
[44:14] a changing world
[44:16] and a changing people
[44:19] an unchanging god a changing world
[44:24] and a changing people
[44:26] and for a subject i am the lord and i
[44:29] change not
[44:30] and an inspiration jesus christ to seem
[44:33] yesterday
[44:34] and today
[44:36] and forever
[44:38] so i want to kind of talk with you a
[44:40] little bit this morning to build into
[44:42] the
[44:42] thought and i
[44:44] trust and pray that it'll be a
[44:46] blessing to you this morning
[44:50] i was in school i was thought
[44:52] that the only constant exchange
[44:56] and at a time it
[44:57] kind of made sense
[45:00] the economy changing the jobs changing
[45:04] lives changing technology changing
[45:08] and it sort of made sense that the only
[45:10] constant was change
[45:13] but the deeper you go into scripture you
[45:15] realize that that is
[45:17] not true because an absolute statement
[45:20] like the only constant is change
[45:23] brings no context of god
[45:27] because the only thing that is constant
[45:29] is god
[45:31] [Applause]
[45:33] god existed before time
[45:36] he exists through time
[45:39] and when time is finished god will still
[45:41] exist
[45:43] you believe that this morning
[45:45] and if you are part of god it means you
[45:47] existed before time
[45:49] you will exist in time and when time is
[45:52] finished you will also exist
[45:56] the unchanging nature of god is what
[45:59] brings us into the house of god this
[46:00] morning
[46:01] because if he was a changing god we
[46:04] would have nothing to hold on to
[46:06] we would have nothing to anchor to and
[46:09] i'm going to get into it in a bit but i
[46:11] want to talk about the unchanging nature
[46:14] of god and tie it into the fact that
[46:16] this world is changing
[46:19] economics are changing
[46:21] lives are being changed people are
[46:23] changing
[46:25] situations are changing governments are
[46:27] changing just to think in scripture
[46:29] there are rows of pharaoh who did not
[46:31] know joseph
[46:33] that in and of itself is a paradox
[46:35] because the famine that the world would
[46:37] have gone through would have been so
[46:38] significant in that day so it's almost a
[46:41] mystery how a pharaoh would be raised up
[46:43] who did not know joseph but that change
[46:46] had to come to bring about something
[46:47] bigger
[46:49] the one constant in that situation was
[46:51] the fact that god remains the same he's
[46:53] the same yesterday he is the same today
[46:56] he is the same forever and he declares
[46:58] that i am the lord and i change not come
[47:01] the church say man
[47:03] so i want to lay a foundation because i
[47:04] want to really talk to the church this
[47:06] morning and on changing god
[47:08] interacting with a changing world you
[47:10] know what it is to sit for years and see
[47:13] the world changing
[47:15] you sit with somebody who has been here
[47:16] for a long time somebody who was here
[47:19] for a long time somebody who's 18 90 or
[47:21] 100 years old and they have seen a lot
[47:24] they've seen the world change you see a
[47:26] time before they were microwaves and
[47:28] before there was fast food and before
[47:31] there was facebook and before there was
[47:33] automatic washing machines and automatic
[47:36] dishwashers and automatic coffee
[47:38] machines and no matter how much
[47:40] technology we add to it we still can't
[47:42] find time to do what's important
[47:45] because the world is changing
[47:47] nothing is stopping the change and in
[47:49] the midst of the world changing god
[47:51] remains the same
[47:54] it's the same god that was there when
[47:56] adam walked the earth the same god i was
[47:58] there when noah was on the year the same
[48:00] god i was there when joseph was in
[48:02] prison in egypt the same god when moses
[48:05] led them out of egypt the same god is
[48:08] watching things unfold and he is not
[48:11] changing but the world is changing
[48:13] kingdoms rising kingdoms falling kings
[48:17] rising kings falling different things
[48:20] happening he watched the days of riding
[48:22] the horses and he watched the horses run
[48:24] around the walls of jericho and as these
[48:27] chains are happening he he is not
[48:29] changing he is the only constant stars
[48:32] rise stars disappear the landscape of
[48:35] the earth the coastline changes but god
[48:38] doesn't change
[48:39] the same yesterday today and forever you
[48:43] hear old people say they wish how it was
[48:45] or years ago when people used to say
[48:47] good morning and people were nicer to
[48:50] one another but just think about god he
[48:52] is the only one not changing oh how he
[48:55] wished things were the way they were
[48:56] back in the garden of eden before man
[48:59] got so corrupt
[49:01] the only one who has watched everything
[49:03] unfold and he can't change because his
[49:06] his nature doesn't allow him to change
[49:08] his nature doesn't allow him to to lie
[49:11] his nature doesn't allow him to
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:15] he can't even pull back his word when he
[49:17] speaks a blessing on you he can't even
[49:20] undo it because he is the god that
[49:22] changes not
[49:23] [Applause]
[49:25] [Music]
[49:26] oh he watched the children of israel
[49:28] walk through the open red sea he watched
[49:31] him in the promised land he saw him tend
[49:33] the tambourine when miriam beat the
[49:35] timer marine and and they are changing
[49:38] locations but he is not changing they
[49:40] are changing the kind of food they eat
[49:42] but he's not changing he watched david
[49:45] put those stones in the sling and he saw
[49:47] david take out the lion and take out the
[49:50] beer he saw david getting older david
[49:52] was changing but god was not changing
[49:56] david was getting mature in the backside
[49:58] of the desert the david who was there
[50:00] with the lion was not the same david who
[50:02] met goliath but the god was the same god
[50:05] oh you don't hear me this morning
[50:09] an unchanging god
[50:11] a changing world
[50:13] a changing people
[50:15] and he remains the same he saw prophet
[50:18] after prophet the weeping prophet
[50:20] jeremiah the great prophet elijah he saw
[50:24] them come they saw nebuchadnezzar he saw
[50:26] kingdoms rise he saw daniel he saw them
[50:30] all unfold and yet he remains the same
[50:33] he saw the political turmoil around the
[50:36] time that jesus would come
[50:39] the world had changed so much friends do
[50:41] you realize that the decision to pick
[50:44] barabbas over jesus was a political
[50:46] decision
[50:48] the world had changed so much that the
[50:50] children of israel as it were or the
[50:52] jews as it were were so oppressed by the
[50:56] politics of the time by the romans at
[50:58] the time they were looking for a
[50:59] deliverer who would be a revolutionary
[51:03] it was not based on the word or
[51:04] scripture it was based on the political
[51:07] upheavals of the time the military
[51:09] changes of the time was so much that
[51:11] against the backdrop of the miracles
[51:13] that jesus had wrought
[51:16] they still picked barabbas
[51:18] because the pressures of the world and
[51:21] the changes of the world were too much
[51:23] for them to look at spiritual things
[51:25] they were more concerned about the
[51:26] natural things so they picked a natural
[51:29] leader instead of a spiritual leader
[51:31] that's the impact of change on the world
[51:34] in which we live but yet still god says
[51:37] i am the lord and i change not
[51:40] [Applause]
[51:42] can we talk a little bit this morning
[51:44] have a conversation a little bit this
[51:46] morning
[51:48] from the message convinced and concerned
[51:50] i'm just laying the foundation
[51:51] to god really want to get to the
[51:53] changing people part
[51:55] but i want to touch on the changing god
[51:57] part for the unchanging god part first
[51:59] god gave the promise and when god gave
[52:01] the promise to abraham he said he would
[52:03] possess the gates of his enemy
[52:05] and so shamgar believes that and look at
[52:08] the odds against him god only needs one
[52:10] man
[52:11] just let him get one man in his hand
[52:13] the world will think he's crazy but he
[52:16] will drive home the gospel when he's
[52:17] thoroughly convinced that listen that
[52:20] jesus christ remains the same yesterday
[52:23] today and forever
[52:25] under anything else he will stand
[52:27] through and go on because he's
[52:28] thoroughly convinced that god is god
[52:31] and if he ever was god he is still god
[52:35] if he isn't the god he was he never was
[52:37] god that's right he's the infinite god
[52:40] the all-powerful almighty omnipresent
[52:45] omniscient
[52:46] infinite he's god he's the same god that
[52:49] opened the red sea he's the same god
[52:52] that brought daniel out of the lion's
[52:54] den the same god that brought the hebrew
[52:56] children from the fiery furnace he's the
[52:59] same god i'd raise up jesus christ on
[53:01] easter morning he's the same god and
[53:03] fell in the day of pentecost he's the
[53:05] same god and raised lazarus out of the
[53:07] grave he's the same yesterday today and
[53:10] forever and i'm convinced that this is
[53:13] the holy ghost peter said on the day of
[53:15] pentecost this is that if this isn't
[53:17] that i'll keep this till that comes for
[53:20] i believe this is that i'm convinced
[53:22] that it's the gospel and the power and
[53:24] the demonstration of the resurrection of
[53:27] the appearing of the lord jesus in this
[53:29] last day making the church ready to be
[53:33] caught away in the pride so in the midst
[53:35] of everything that's taken place with
[53:37] the world changing the land's changing
[53:40] with what's happening in russia and
[53:42] ukraine and all this that's the world
[53:44] changing and people are changing and
[53:46] getting worse and worse and worse but in
[53:48] the midst of that there are also some
[53:49] people who are changing into a wonderful
[53:52] glorious image of sons and daughters of
[53:55] god can the church say amen
[54:00] so a change is happening this morning
[54:02] but ibrahim said his plan of redemption
[54:05] is exactly the same by everything he
[54:08] uses the same method he never changes he
[54:11] said in malachi 3 i am god and i change
[54:14] not
[54:16] you change but god don't change god's
[54:19] method doesn't change he is still
[54:21] interested in taking sin out your heart
[54:24] that will never change he is still
[54:26] interested in giving you a
[54:27] transformation that will never change he
[54:30] is still interested in you getting a
[54:32] personal experience with god
[54:34] that can never change up i don't care
[54:36] how much new technology is put in place
[54:39] god's desire to be resident in your
[54:41] heart that will never change up i don't
[54:44] care how corrupt the world becomes god's
[54:46] desire to sit on the throne of the heart
[54:50] of sons and daughters that could never
[54:52] change up his desire to have a people in
[54:55] love with him and in love with one
[54:58] another that could never change and okay
[55:00] how dark the world gets up it's time to
[55:03] arise and shine
[55:05] thy light has come that could never
[55:07] change because that's how he is made up
[55:10] and his sons and daughters put them
[55:12] anywhere put them under any condition
[55:15] put them through any trial and something
[55:18] will anchor their souls to a constant
[55:20] god the anchor will hold
[55:27] despite the storm
[55:30] you may be seated
[55:33] you can learn more
[55:35] by going to school
[55:37] you can learn more by getting a degree
[55:39] but god can't learn more
[55:41] because he already knows everything
[55:44] oh you don't hear me this morning we
[55:46] learn we grow we change we mature but
[55:49] god cannot grow
[55:51] he cannot learn he cannot change he
[55:54] cannot mature because if that's what he
[55:56] has to go through he cannot be my god my
[55:59] god already knows the end from the
[56:00] beginning he has declared he's the alpha
[56:03] and he is the omega he is the beginning
[56:06] and he's the end can't you trust this
[56:08] god to make things work out for your
[56:10] family can't you trust his god to change
[56:13] your situation can't you trust this god
[56:16] to change your circumstances
[56:19] oh i declare this morning he's still a
[56:21] healer he is still a deliverer he is
[56:24] still a restorer he is still a baptizer
[56:27] he still hears the cries of his people
[56:30] he still responds to the call of
[56:32] somebody this morning can we give the
[56:34] lord a shout out praise can we lift him
[56:36] up this morning oh hallelujah
[56:39] [Applause]
[56:45] he never changes
[56:47] he said in malachi 3 i am god and i
[56:49] change not
[56:51] the way he does it therefore if he saved
[56:53] the first man he ever saved by the shed
[56:55] blood of an innocent one he'll have to
[56:57] save the next one
[56:59] and everyone he saves would have to be
[57:01] the same way
[57:02] oh god i thank god that he repeats the
[57:04] process
[57:05] i thank god that he don't change because
[57:07] he don't change i have a chance oh god
[57:09] help me this morning because he don't
[57:11] change i could get access to his power
[57:14] because the same blood
[57:15] that tell peter the same blood that was
[57:18] through the ages is the same blood that
[57:21] covers me this morning oh come on now
[57:24] the blood prevails there's still power
[57:26] in the blood thank god for the blood up
[57:29] i don't care what technology come
[57:31] there's no technology that could fight
[57:33] the blood the blood could never lose its
[57:35] power oh you don't hear me this morning
[57:38] you may be seated if he healed a man
[57:42] at any time this is called precedent in
[57:45] law
[57:46] god's law is unchanging so based on the
[57:49] law you could go to a court case and say
[57:51] your honor based on case so and so you
[57:55] hear somebody who had enough fear for
[57:57] healing and are coming this morning with
[58:00] faith based on the precedent that it was
[58:03] done before are coming to claim what is
[58:05] mine this morning and the good thing is
[58:07] that the law and the writer of the law
[58:10] and the lawyer in the courtroom and the
[58:12] judge of the seat is all the same person
[58:14] so god is enforcing his law he is
[58:17] defending his law he's advocating for
[58:19] his law and he's approving his law or
[58:22] you don't hear me to slow them i am god
[58:24] and i changed not so what are you
[58:26] worried about your children because of
[58:28] promises unto you and your children it
[58:30] has nothing to do with you saving them
[58:32] it's god law being made effective to
[58:36] your house he said plea the blood apply
[58:39] the token for your children do your part
[58:41] apply the token for your house apply the
[58:44] token and god will do the rest come on
[58:46] somebody preach back to me
[58:49] [Music]
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:56] if he healed a man at any time
[59:00] through the journey of life
[59:03] let it be in the days of jesus
[59:06] the apostles
[59:07] the prophets
[59:09] whenever it was
[59:11] when the same conditions is met
[59:14] he's got to do it again
[59:16] there's no room for him to not do it
[59:18] because thank god he's the same god
[59:21] so he's got to do it again
[59:23] that's right i'm reading he doesn't
[59:25] change
[59:26] man changes
[59:28] time changes
[59:29] age changes
[59:31] dispensation changes but god remains the
[59:34] same he is perfect what a hope that
[59:37] ought to give to sick people oh my my my
[59:40] my my and by the branham goes on if he
[59:42] ever healed a person he has to do it
[59:45] again when the same conditions is met he
[59:48] ever ever saved a man he's got to do it
[59:51] on the same grounds he did it the first
[59:53] time listen if he ever filled a man with
[59:56] the holy ghost
[59:58] he's got to do it on the same grounds he
[1:00:01] did the first time if he ever raise a
[1:00:03] man up from the grave he's got to do it
[1:00:06] the second time and every other time on
[1:00:09] the same principle somebody give god a
[1:00:11] shout out praise
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:16] [Applause]
[1:00:20] i'm still laying a foundation i'm trying
[1:00:22] to talk to you i'm not preaching it
[1:00:25] he doesn't change
[1:00:27] or what a hope that gives me what is it
[1:00:30] not in some man-made theory
[1:00:32] something that groups of men have come
[1:00:34] together but his
[1:00:36] unchangeable word
[1:00:38] hallelujah
[1:00:42] the psalmist david
[1:00:45] my days are like a shadow that decline
[1:00:48] it
[1:00:48] in psalms 102
[1:00:50] and i am with it like grass
[1:00:53] so david is recognizing his changes
[1:00:56] and the changes in his life the changes
[1:00:58] in the situation the changes in the
[1:01:00] circumstance
[1:01:02] my days are like a shadow that decline
[1:01:05] it
[1:01:06] and i am withered like grass
[1:01:08] the use of the word wither is a is a
[1:01:10] transformative word because the weather
[1:01:13] meant you were better before and you
[1:01:15] declined
[1:01:16] so he's building a case but he goes on
[1:01:18] but thou o lord
[1:01:20] shalt endure forever
[1:01:22] and thy remembrance unto all generations
[1:01:25] thou shalt arise and have mercy upon
[1:01:27] zion for the time to favor her year the
[1:01:30] set time has come
[1:01:32] for thy servants take pleasure in her
[1:01:34] stones and favor the dust thereof so the
[1:01:36] heathen shall fear the name of the lord
[1:01:38] and all the kings of the earth thy glory
[1:01:42] when the lord shall build up zion he
[1:01:44] shall appear in his glory
[1:01:46] he will regard the prayer of the
[1:01:47] destitute and not despise their prayer
[1:01:51] this shall be written for the generation
[1:01:54] to come and the people which shall be
[1:01:56] created shall praise the lord
[1:01:59] for he had looked down from the height
[1:02:01] of his sanctuary from heaven to the lord
[1:02:04] behold earth
[1:02:06] to hear the groaning of the prisoner to
[1:02:08] lose those that are appointed to death
[1:02:11] there are those that are appointed to
[1:02:12] death but god is looking now to loose
[1:02:14] them from that appointment or you don't
[1:02:17] hear me this morning to declare the name
[1:02:20] of the lord and zion and his praise in
[1:02:22] jerusalem
[1:02:24] when the people are gathered together
[1:02:26] and the kingdoms to serve the lord
[1:02:30] and david reversed himself he weakened
[1:02:32] my strength and the way he shortened my
[1:02:36] days
[1:02:37] i said oh my god take me not away in the
[1:02:39] midst of my days the years are
[1:02:41] throughout all generations david was
[1:02:44] recognizing the difference in in his
[1:02:46] time and the way god counts years
[1:02:48] through the generations he said of all
[1:02:50] hast thou lay the foundations of the
[1:02:52] earth and the heavens are the work of
[1:02:54] thy hands
[1:02:56] they shall perish but thou shalt endure
[1:02:59] ye all of them shall wax oh like a
[1:03:01] garment as a vestia shalt thou change
[1:03:04] them and they shall be changed
[1:03:06] but thou art the same
[1:03:09] and their years shall have no end
[1:03:12] can the church say amen
[1:03:14] everybody feeling fine this morning can
[1:03:16] we give the lord a hand of praise
[1:03:19] still laying a foundation to get to
[1:03:21] somewhere
[1:03:23] james 1 17 every good gift
[1:03:26] and every perfect gift is from above and
[1:03:30] coming down from the father of light
[1:03:32] with whom is no variableness
[1:03:35] neither shadow of turning speaking about
[1:03:38] the fact that god doesn't change
[1:03:41] and as a vesture shall thou this is
[1:03:44] hebrews 1 12 fold them up and they shall
[1:03:46] be chained but thou are the same and thy
[1:03:48] ears shall not fail paul is repeating
[1:03:51] what david said
[1:03:53] god cannot change
[1:03:55] his expectations cannot change
[1:04:00] god's word cannot change
[1:04:02] god's promises cannot change
[1:04:05] god's mercies cannot change
[1:04:09] god's sovereignty cannot change god's
[1:04:12] nature cannot change
[1:04:14] god's desires cannot change
[1:04:17] his favor cannot change
[1:04:20] his desire to predestinate you cannot
[1:04:23] change or you don't hear me this morning
[1:04:26] you could change in the morning and
[1:04:28] change your mind but when you changing
[1:04:30] god cannot change when you backslide
[1:04:33] thank god that he doesn't change and he
[1:04:36] can't change his mind about you oh come
[1:04:38] on now somebody gave god a shout out
[1:04:40] praise when you feel down and depressed
[1:04:43] because you are subject to change thank
[1:04:45] god that god doesn't change because he
[1:04:47] doesn't get depressed
[1:04:49] he just holds on to his word because it
[1:04:51] is his word can the chain should say
[1:04:54] amen so you thank god he's the same
[1:04:56] yesterday he's the same today he's the
[1:04:58] same forever
[1:05:06] but i branham in preaching this
[1:05:09] he would reference the fact that
[1:05:11] as he traveled different places in the
[1:05:13] world he referenced 35 years ago he was
[1:05:15] in a certain place under and the roads
[1:05:17] were different
[1:05:20] once there was something and now there's
[1:05:21] a park
[1:05:23] once there was something else and
[1:05:24] there's something else there change
[1:05:26] it's different
[1:05:28] and he was saying all of the medicine
[1:05:30] all the technology he he referenced how
[1:05:32] how john wesley's mom didn't have access
[1:05:35] to the technology we have but she still
[1:05:36] made time to pray
[1:05:39] modernly we have all of the things that
[1:05:41] increase productivity and fast this and
[1:05:44] fast that and and still we can't find
[1:05:46] time
[1:05:47] and that's the world changing and you if
[1:05:50] you get caught up in this you change
[1:05:52] with the world and you miss the mark of
[1:05:55] what's important
[1:05:57] and because you have less time because
[1:06:00] you have to do all these things doesn't
[1:06:02] make god's word changer
[1:06:06] you
[1:06:07] spending time doing all kind of stuff
[1:06:09] doesn't change god's requirement for the
[1:06:11] token to be
[1:06:12] displayed
[1:06:15] the world being discourteous to one
[1:06:17] another doesn't change the fact that you
[1:06:19] have to have love for your enemies you
[1:06:20] know
[1:06:22] i don't care if you're the only one
[1:06:23] walking in your office saying good
[1:06:24] morning and have a blessed day
[1:06:26] how they act can change the way you act
[1:06:29] because you are
[1:06:31] you are not from here
[1:06:34] and you can't change the way the world
[1:06:35] is changing the world will continue to
[1:06:37] get worse
[1:06:40] you may be seated
[1:06:41] the technology in the world is designed
[1:06:44] for change
[1:06:46] if you study
[1:06:48] the psychology of social media
[1:06:51] and the new social media platforms they
[1:06:54] are actually proven to rewire your brain
[1:06:58] to shorten your attention span
[1:07:01] people get this thrill of going to
[1:07:03] platforms and in in in they call it
[1:07:05] short form video 15 seconds 10 seconds
[1:07:08] eight seconds 30 it's short
[1:07:11] and and you're spending time jumping
[1:07:13] from thing to thing to thing to thing to
[1:07:15] thing getting a dopamine rush
[1:07:17] that makes you looking for just
[1:07:19] short-term satisfaction
[1:07:23] until in school students can't study
[1:07:25] anymore
[1:07:26] they can't focus anymore they talk about
[1:07:29] adhd and all these things because we
[1:07:31] have programmed ourselves to want to
[1:07:34] consume things in small pieces
[1:07:37] we can't sit down anymore and whereas
[1:07:39] god told us to meditate on the word day
[1:07:42] and night in other words concentrate on
[1:07:43] it
[1:07:44] this is not something you're taking a
[1:07:46] 10-second gospel and a 15-second thing
[1:07:49] and a 20-second sam and you're jumbled
[1:07:51] to something else you have to bask in
[1:07:53] this thing you have to live in this
[1:07:54] thing you have to want to enjoy this
[1:07:56] thing you need to plug into this thing
[1:07:58] for a while to detox your brain oh come
[1:08:00] on somebody help me this morning detox
[1:08:03] from all of the stuff in the world
[1:08:08] i want to help us this morning
[1:08:11] i don't care how much the economy
[1:08:12] changed there was a time man used to
[1:08:14] batter for goods and services there was
[1:08:16] no currency to exchange
[1:08:19] i had chickens and they laid eggs i
[1:08:21] bring the eggs to you and you give me
[1:08:23] milk from your cow
[1:08:26] and eventually currency came into play
[1:08:29] now they're talking about cryptocurrency
[1:08:31] so no longer paper currency we have
[1:08:34] credit cards we have bitcoin we have
[1:08:36] ethereum we have all these things the
[1:08:38] world is changing but in the midst of
[1:08:40] that god says i'm still your provider
[1:08:45] i'm still jehovah gyra i don't care what
[1:08:48] man calls what they're trying to do to
[1:08:50] solve their problem my children can
[1:08:52] speak for what they want and it's
[1:08:54] supposed to create itself because this
[1:08:56] spoken word is the original seed you
[1:08:58] don't hear me this morning
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:03] i am the lord and i change not he
[1:09:05] provided there in the desert he provided
[1:09:08] here when the prophet was on the earth
[1:09:10] and he'll still provide for you it
[1:09:12] doesn't matter how much your world
[1:09:13] changes this world will change and
[1:09:15] continue to change but god still remains
[1:09:18] the same
[1:09:20] you may be seated
[1:09:23] but a brandon would reference the way
[1:09:25] people dressed in the 50s and before and
[1:09:28] now now we see there's no moral compass
[1:09:31] and you speak about it you're a hater
[1:09:33] you're you're anti-feminist you're
[1:09:35] you're this and you're that and all of
[1:09:37] these words and phrases
[1:09:41] who independent and all these things
[1:09:49] and in the meanwhile god's standard
[1:09:51] change you know
[1:09:53] if your employer changes the standards
[1:09:56] they could do that
[1:09:57] but god not changing this standard
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:02] if the government change a law and a
[1:10:04] policy that is not that don't mean god
[1:10:06] lord change
[1:10:08] if the government allowed things to
[1:10:10] happen that were taboo years ago don't
[1:10:12] mean god change his mind about the way
[1:10:14] he feels about things oh you don't hear
[1:10:16] me this morning
[1:10:19] the world has changed to make things
[1:10:20] acceptable
[1:10:22] and they try to climb down speaking
[1:10:24] against sin
[1:10:26] oh god help us
[1:10:27] as i say if god don't judge his will
[1:10:29] he'll have to repent of sodom and
[1:10:30] gomorrah
[1:10:32] because he cannot change and because he
[1:10:34] cannot change judgment is set
[1:10:37] judgment is set the arrow of judgment
[1:10:39] has already been loose
[1:10:41] and has just been held back until sons
[1:10:43] and daughters are sealed into the
[1:10:45] kingdom of god you don't hear me this
[1:10:47] morning
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:54] because the world has changed some job
[1:10:57] that existed years ago no longer exist
[1:11:01] if you were the best
[1:11:03] horseshoe maker in the world
[1:11:06] when henry ford drove the first car
[1:11:09] you could not improve on being a
[1:11:10] horseshoe maker because the age of the
[1:11:12] horseshoe was over
[1:11:16] you had to change to becoming a mechanic
[1:11:20] if you wanted to be tied to the movement
[1:11:22] or the automobile or the transportation
[1:11:23] industry you couldn't say well i'm going
[1:11:25] to do a masters in horseshoe now
[1:11:29] because the horses were being put in
[1:11:30] stables and cars were now on the road
[1:11:36] technology change economic change but
[1:11:38] with it time and thing listen this plan
[1:11:41] they make change people don't know
[1:11:44] do you know how you have changed because
[1:11:46] of the pandemic i'm gonna get to it a
[1:11:48] little bit do you realize how much
[1:11:49] you've changed
[1:11:58] people have gotten so relaxed
[1:12:00] churches now uh i click
[1:12:06] i could click on and you could connect
[1:12:08] to god like just connect into
[1:12:10] to some other app
[1:12:14] you're switching apps
[1:12:16] you could watch anything on youtube and
[1:12:17] then switch your servers and switch back
[1:12:19] to another thing on youtube and it's
[1:12:20] just another thing to do
[1:12:26] when moses walked up under the mountain
[1:12:28] where the burning bush was he said moses
[1:12:30] take off your shoes
[1:12:33] from off your feet
[1:12:35] because the place you're standing is
[1:12:37] holy ground
[1:12:38] don't approach me
[1:12:40] like you approach everything else
[1:12:42] don't approach me the way you approach
[1:12:44] your boss don't approach me the way you
[1:12:46] approach your co-worker don't even
[1:12:48] approach me the way you approach a
[1:12:50] priest or a pastor
[1:12:53] you're approaching god
[1:12:55] and you have to conduct yourself a
[1:12:57] certain way
[1:12:59] take off your shoes because the place
[1:13:01] you're standing is holy ground come with
[1:13:03] reverence
[1:13:04] even isaiah had to walk and when he got
[1:13:07] into the presence of god he didn't even
[1:13:09] realize his own issues until the light
[1:13:12] shone upon him and he said woe is me i
[1:13:14] didn't i didn't realize i had this
[1:13:16] baggage in my life because he came into
[1:13:19] presence
[1:13:24] you have to realize what god is testing
[1:13:27] what god is allowing
[1:13:29] to see if you really understand who he
[1:13:31] is and the fact that he is the same god
[1:13:34] that say put off your shoes is the same
[1:13:35] god that operates today you know
[1:13:38] so if he hasn't changed and
[1:13:43] you allow the world and the technology
[1:13:45] changes to change your reverence to the
[1:13:46] things of god
[1:13:49] think about it friends
[1:13:51] can you watch a youtube video the same
[1:13:53] way you watch a service
[1:13:55] the same atmosphere the same approach is
[1:13:57] just it's just another thing to do where
[1:14:00] is the reverence
[1:14:01] where's the respect this is not about
[1:14:03] the church this is about god he is god
[1:14:06] and he hasn't changed
[1:14:11] he killed ananias and sapphira because
[1:14:13] of what was in their heart
[1:14:16] don't you realize people are spiritually
[1:14:18] dead and they're still in the church
[1:14:20] connected on the internet and dead god
[1:14:22] hasn't changed his word hasn't changed
[1:14:24] oh let me help you this morning
[1:14:28] in a message as i thought in my way we
[1:14:30] cannot alter god's word we have to alter
[1:14:33] our thinking to his thinking
[1:14:36] let the mind of christ be in you then
[1:14:38] you'll think like he thinks
[1:14:40] we can't put god into our bucket of our
[1:14:44] imagination he becomes a god of our
[1:14:46] imagination we have to go up to his
[1:14:48] standard friends
[1:14:52] so this morning i'm talking to you
[1:14:54] an unchanging god
[1:14:57] a changing world and a changing people
[1:15:02] moses
[1:15:04] listen friends you cannot come into
[1:15:05] contact with god
[1:15:07] and remain the same
[1:15:09] you either get worse
[1:15:11] or you get better
[1:15:13] but there's nothing like being the same
[1:15:16] so there are people in here this morning
[1:15:18] and listening on the internet who are
[1:15:20] either getting better or getting worse
[1:15:23] but you're not staying the same
[1:15:25] how will you leave this service this
[1:15:27] morning will you leave better or will
[1:15:29] you leave worse
[1:15:31] but isaac is it true could you leave
[1:15:33] worse of course
[1:15:39] i'll get to it in a bit
[1:15:41] moses
[1:15:43] had to go through a change
[1:15:47] he had thought that his ability could
[1:15:49] have helped them and he killed one man
[1:15:50] ran for his life 40 years in the
[1:15:52] wilderness
[1:15:53] mining somebody else
[1:15:55] sheep
[1:15:57] i think brother anthony preached it you
[1:15:58] see he didn't even have his own stuff by
[1:15:59] then
[1:16:01] after 40 years
[1:16:04] but when he met god
[1:16:07] he had an encounter with god
[1:16:09] and he had a change
[1:16:11] an unchangeable god
[1:16:14] met a man who could change
[1:16:16] and that man was changed
[1:16:18] can the church say amen
[1:16:20] an unchangeable god stood there and said
[1:16:23] take off your shoes he said i have heard
[1:16:25] the cries of my people and i've come
[1:16:27] down to the liver
[1:16:29] now you need to go but the condition you
[1:16:31] are in you can't go like that you need a
[1:16:33] change you need an encounter something
[1:16:35] has to happen in your life
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:38] you don't hear me this morning
[1:16:41] that's why we came to church the problem
[1:16:43] in the message people have knowledge and
[1:16:45] they haven't changed
[1:16:48] oh i want to say it again you know
[1:16:50] knowledge can make you better always
[1:16:54] so people sit in a message and the
[1:16:56] knowledge of this revealed word has
[1:16:58] actually made them worse
[1:17:01] the knowledge of the mysteries and
[1:17:03] sabino canyon and the king's sword has
[1:17:06] actually made them lose love
[1:17:10] can't forgive
[1:17:12] can reach out to somebody
[1:17:14] else because change is guaranteed you
[1:17:17] know oh yeah we're gonna get it
[1:17:20] but i thank god when moses met the
[1:17:22] pillar of fire
[1:17:24] his change was for the better
[1:17:27] he changed
[1:17:29] supernatural encounter
[1:17:32] a man that could change met an
[1:17:34] unchangeable god and change
[1:17:37] for the better
[1:17:38] anybody wants to meet an unchangeable
[1:17:40] god and get a change for the better
[1:17:44] don't come to service this morning and
[1:17:46] go back home worse you know
[1:17:49] i'm not even going to say go back home
[1:17:50] the same way you came because i know
[1:17:52] you're not going to go home the same way
[1:17:54] you're going to go home better or you're
[1:17:55] going to go home worse
[1:17:58] a lot of people in this pandemic over
[1:18:00] the last two years have gotten worse
[1:18:02] their knowledge of the world has
[1:18:03] increased but their behavior their
[1:18:05] conduct has actually gone worse
[1:18:10] can i take my time
[1:18:13] isaiah came into the presence of god
[1:18:17] and he couldn't stay the same
[1:18:20] he said woe is me he said take the calls
[1:18:22] cleanse my lip
[1:18:24] isaiah didn't realize before his
[1:18:27] encounter that he had issues
[1:18:29] that his lips were impured
[1:18:34] jacob had an encounter with god but
[1:18:36] abraham said it would maybe have been
[1:18:37] the first time he got a hold of
[1:18:39] something real in his whole life
[1:18:43] and he had a change
[1:18:45] like we all have to go through changes
[1:18:47] and he got changed for the better his
[1:18:50] walk changes his walk his walk changes
[1:18:53] his life changes his language changes
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:01] it's impossible but a shame to meet god
[1:19:05] and remain the
[1:19:06] same oh what it would be like to meet
[1:19:10] jesus
[1:19:11] face to face
[1:19:13] and to have the opportunity for a change
[1:19:18] isn't that your desire
[1:19:24] and here it was in scripture a young man
[1:19:26] gets this opportunity
[1:19:28] to walk up to jesus
[1:19:30] good master what more must i do
[1:19:34] to have eternal life
[1:19:38] a man that could change
[1:19:40] looking for change
[1:19:42] speaks to an unchangeable god
[1:19:45] about what he had to change
[1:19:48] the question he asks is what more must i
[1:19:50] do in other words i know i need to
[1:19:52] change
[1:19:54] help me to understand this morning the
[1:19:57] change i need to make in my life from my
[1:20:00] youth i've obeyed the commandments from
[1:20:02] my youth i've done what i'm supposed to
[1:20:03] do what lacquer yet
[1:20:07] do you know you need change do you know
[1:20:08] that's why we came this morning
[1:20:10] to
[1:20:11] to change
[1:20:13] and jesus loved this man
[1:20:16] looked into his heart and he said go
[1:20:19] sell all you have
[1:20:22] and give to the poor
[1:20:24] and jesus wrote a prescription brother
[1:20:26] popcorn for him to go and take the
[1:20:29] pharmacy
[1:20:30] and begin to administer for himself
[1:20:33] this is not jesus have to do it he said
[1:20:35] you
[1:20:36] go and do it in other words i'm writing
[1:20:38] the prescription for the change you need
[1:20:40] in your life
[1:20:41] to fix the things that need to be fixed
[1:20:44] i didn't come to you you came to me
[1:20:47] looking for a prescription you know

[1:20:54] you to change your diet for you to
[1:20:57] change your friends for you to change
[1:20:59] how you live and when jesus wrote the
[1:21:02] prescription
[1:21:06] this young man went home sorrowful
[1:21:09] because he refused
[1:21:12] to change the change was too much for
[1:21:15] him he left worse
[1:21:20] you know what it is to meet jesus and
[1:21:22] leave worse

[1:21:50] didn't come because he was feeling to
[1:21:51] come to church you know he came to jesus
[1:21:54] because he knew that he had some issues
[1:21:57] can the church say amen
[1:22:00] let me talk to you for a little bit
[1:22:01] friends
[1:22:03] every experience in life
[1:22:07] changes you
[1:22:12] every word
[1:22:15] every song
[1:22:17] every image you see
[1:22:20] every video you watch
[1:22:22] every conversation
[1:22:24] you have
[1:22:25] changes you
[1:22:28] when you rest
[1:22:30] your body changes
[1:22:32] if you don't get enough sleep your body
[1:22:35] also changes
[1:22:37] the food you eat changes you
[1:22:43] your prayer life changes you
[1:22:46] when you stop praying
[1:22:48] it changes
[1:22:50] you when you speak positively it changes
[1:22:55] you
[1:22:56] when you speak negatively
[1:22:58] it changes you
[1:23:03] when i got married it changed me
[1:23:07] when my daughter was born
[1:23:09] it changed me
[1:23:12] your successes
[1:23:14] change you
[1:23:16] your failures
[1:23:17] change
[1:23:18] you the people around you
[1:23:22] change you
[1:23:25] every
[1:23:26] interaction
[1:23:28] every experience in life changes you
[1:23:36] in a constant war
[1:23:39] to align the physical
[1:23:41] natural
[1:23:43] mental
[1:23:44] emotional
[1:23:46] and ever-changing beings we are
[1:23:49] a war between that and the spiritual
[1:23:52] eternal beings that we are in the mind
[1:23:55] of god
[1:23:57] a war of reconciliation because we are
[1:24:00] changeable
[1:24:02] but god cannot change
[1:24:05] and the attributes seed in us from god
[1:24:08] also cannot change
[1:24:11] but our state on a day-to-day basis
[1:24:13] right now might be
[1:24:15] variable
[1:24:17] your standing might be variable as we
[1:24:20] work towards a perfect
[1:24:22] standing and a perfect state or anybody
[1:24:26] with me this morning can we have a
[1:24:28] conversation
[1:24:29] you may be seated
[1:24:32] a lack of a deep understanding of this
[1:24:34] reality results in pain
[1:24:37] frustration and a range of emotions
[1:24:41] sometimes we are different people in the
[1:24:43] morning
[1:24:46] then in the evening
[1:24:49] i thank god and he doesn't change
[1:24:51] and the way he receives the prayer in
[1:24:53] the morning and the way he receives a
[1:24:55] prayer in the evening
[1:24:58] it doesn't change but
[1:25:00] we change
[1:25:03] we are different people when we receive
[1:25:05] good news
[1:25:06] and when we receive bad news
[1:25:11] we talk about having to time people
[1:25:16] to have a conversation with them
[1:25:18] because we don't know who they are
[1:25:21] at that particular point in time
[1:25:25] we make comments like he's a different
[1:25:27] person
[1:25:29] you see how that job changed him
[1:25:31] yesterday change him
[1:25:33] you see we get promoted and he different
[1:25:34] he don't talk to us anymore
[1:25:40] you say we leave the community and be
[1:25:42] different
[1:25:45] change constant
[1:25:50] every experience
[1:25:52] every action
[1:25:53] every newspaper article every online
[1:25:56] piece of content is either making you
[1:25:58] better or making you worse
[1:26:02] do you realize this friends
[1:26:04] every phone call
[1:26:06] every whatsapp message
[1:26:08] every forward you receive and every
[1:26:10] forward you forward exactly changing you
[1:26:19] when someone
[1:26:20] backslides it means the combination of
[1:26:24] negative changes
[1:26:26] were more than the combination of
[1:26:28] positive changes
[1:26:32] in scripture we see a pattern over and
[1:26:35] over again the children of israel went
[1:26:38] from a victorious standing and state to
[1:26:41] becoming relaxed change again
[1:26:44] it wasn't overnight you know it was
[1:26:46] always gradual
[1:26:48] the missiles missile service the missile
[1:26:50] offering and they miss doing a thing
[1:26:52] here and before you know it they became
[1:26:54] relaxed
[1:26:56] end up in sin
[1:26:57] end up in judgment and up in captivity
[1:27:00] until the pain was enough that they
[1:27:02] started to repent and then god would
[1:27:04] step in he would restore them put them
[1:27:06] back in the victory but that victory
[1:27:08] would last as long as they started to
[1:27:11] just slip away again
[1:27:15] such is the story of every age
[1:27:20] change
[1:27:22] of the world and the people
[1:27:25] and there's an unchangeable god
[1:27:28] watching all of this taking place
[1:27:32] friends
[1:27:33] are you working on changing your life
[1:27:36] people sit down in churches this morning
[1:27:38] taking notes and writing stuff and they
[1:27:41] don't want to change you know because
[1:27:42] they still don't want to forgive because
[1:27:44] the change is not just a change of
[1:27:45] thinking it has to lead to a change in
[1:27:47] behavior it must lead to a change in
[1:27:50] conduct that is the thunder that shakes
[1:27:52] the devil
[1:27:55] and change
[1:27:57] forward change is a choice
[1:27:59] you could change your worship right now
[1:28:02] you'd have to wait till the end of the
[1:28:03] service pop-pop well you could change it
[1:28:04] right now i know you can say wait a
[1:28:06] minute i lift my hand for this service
[1:28:07] let me just lift my hand but abraham
[1:28:09] said that's defining law of gravity
[1:28:12] just to lift your hand defies the law of
[1:28:14] gravity and let the devil know listen i
[1:28:16] am changing
[1:28:19] i may not have a reason in my mind to
[1:28:21] worship but i still wishing with god
[1:28:22] anyhow
[1:28:23] just to confuse the devil
[1:28:25] just to frustrate the enemy just to show
[1:28:28] the devil that i might just have my gums
[1:28:30] but i'm not gonna back down anybody feel
[1:28:32] that way this morning
[1:28:35] [Applause]
[1:28:39] i hope this helps you know
[1:28:43] but the brandon was operating for years
[1:28:46] and god said my son
[1:28:49] you still have some more changing
[1:28:52] you need to be more sincere
[1:28:56] many experiences were designed to change
[1:28:58] the way the prophet looked at certain
[1:29:00] things
[1:29:01] and god says
[1:29:02] you have an exchange you know
[1:29:04] are we open to hearing god telling us
[1:29:06] what we need to change or you have to
[1:29:09] take me as i am you know how i was with
[1:29:10] 20 years don't try to change me now
[1:29:16] and i just see it you know i just see it
[1:29:18] or
[1:29:19] i don't know what live from emotional
[1:29:21] if you come to me you know you're
[1:29:22] getting straight
[1:29:31] and let's be good until you push me to
[1:29:32] push me
[1:29:38] i didn't start it she started and dies
[1:29:40] why i say that
[1:29:42] and you don't see the need to change
[1:29:45] you don't seem to check yourself against
[1:29:47] your word
[1:29:49] i thank god that hero changing them
[1:29:55] i hope this is a conversation this
[1:29:56] morning i hope it helps you know
[1:30:00] question what changes are you willing to
[1:30:02] make today
[1:30:04] are you willing to shut off
[1:30:06] somebody facebook and the videos and the
[1:30:08] content i see believers i mean sharing
[1:30:10] things and i want to know why you would
[1:30:12] share that
[1:30:13] how is it edifying you or somebody else
[1:30:19] i see young people
[1:30:20] sharing content from people and singing
[1:30:23] and
[1:30:23] is that is are those your idols are
[1:30:25] those your role models
[1:30:36] are those people you look up to
[1:30:40] and then you want to know where you went
[1:30:42] wrong
[1:30:43] and what happened to you
[1:30:44] and why
[1:30:45] but just can't get a new spirit at this
[1:30:47] fine service this is a certain way i
[1:30:49] really can't get me spirit how much time
[1:30:51] you spend on fake on facebook and tech
[1:30:52] talk on instagram and old talking and
[1:30:54] watching movies and and and you want and
[1:30:56] you have a problem getting it and you
[1:30:58] don't wonder why it's on you
[1:31:02] all we're hearing is he promises and he
[1:31:03] promises and he promises is he promised
[1:31:05] real to you
[1:31:08] because when they found you well shiman
[1:31:09] looking for the world revival he said
[1:31:11] we're looking for because i am the rival
[1:31:15] the revival right here i don't know what
[1:31:16] you're looking for
[1:31:19] the revival was in him is he revival in
[1:31:21] you
[1:31:22] because the minister can't bring the
[1:31:24] revival
[1:31:25] are you coming parade up are you coming
[1:31:27] in the spirit are you coming with your
[1:31:29] gun shooting the devil left right and
[1:31:31] center so that when you enter the church
[1:31:33] the atmosphere changes anybody with me
[1:31:35] this morning
[1:31:37] [Applause]
[1:31:41] what changes are you willing to make
[1:31:44] today
[1:31:45] this week
[1:31:47] this month
[1:31:48] this year if the lord tarries
[1:31:51] the rich young ruler was not willing to
[1:31:52] change
[1:31:58] change
[1:32:00] unchangeable god
[1:32:02] a changing world
[1:32:04] a changing people could you take some
[1:32:06] more
[1:32:08] brother jude
[1:32:10] found himself looking around the service
[1:32:13] one day
[1:32:14] and jude realized that the church
[1:32:16] changed
[1:32:20] and that prompted you to write a letter
[1:32:26] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[1:32:28] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:32:31] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:32:33] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:32:36] content for the fate which was once
[1:32:38] delivered to the saints
[1:32:40] in other words are looking around and
[1:32:42] things are not where it's supposed to be
[1:32:44] and more than that is not how it used to
[1:32:45] be
[1:32:59] churches
[1:33:01] change
[1:33:06] can we go on
[1:33:09] pastors change
[1:33:12] ministers change
[1:33:14] elders change
[1:33:16] deacons change
[1:33:18] ushers change
[1:33:20] musicians change
[1:33:23] trustees change
[1:33:25] some for the better
[1:33:27] some for the worse
[1:33:29] some lose the burden
[1:33:33] it just becomes something to do
[1:33:36] you're just playing music you're playing
[1:33:38] you're playing music
[1:33:39] you're doing the technical
[1:33:42] but the passion and the zeal you used to
[1:33:44] have is no longer there who is
[1:33:46] responsible
[1:33:48] did god change because he can't change
[1:33:51] that's why the prophet can say if you
[1:33:53] ever find you're disconnected from god
[1:33:55] you have to go back to where you left
[1:33:57] him
[1:33:59] because god doesn't leave you
[1:34:02] god doesn't change
[1:34:07] friends
[1:34:08] could you see how you have changed and
[1:34:10] and are you willing to work back and
[1:34:12] then work harder to move beyond where
[1:34:14] you've ever been before in a spiritual
[1:34:17] walk
[1:34:19] climb higher
[1:34:20] i'm not preaching to you i'm looking at
[1:34:22] this i'm looking at my own life i'm
[1:34:24] saying listen friends we have to do
[1:34:26] something
[1:34:28] we must do better
[1:34:33] paul
[1:34:34] himself
[1:34:36] recognized his own vulnerability
[1:34:41] let me just find it quickly
[1:34:47] you saying people can't change
[1:34:54] paul said
[1:34:55] but though we
[1:34:58] or an angel from heaven
[1:35:01] preach any other gospel
[1:35:03] unto you than that which we have
[1:35:06] preached unto you let him be accused
[1:35:10] so paul
[1:35:12] was being so careful as a minister that
[1:35:15] he was saying listen
[1:35:16] i don't know how much i'm going to
[1:35:18] change
[1:35:20] and i don't know if i will change i
[1:35:21] don't know where i'll be in years to
[1:35:23] come so if i come back to you
[1:35:25] and preach something different from the
[1:35:27] service this morning curse me also
[1:35:30] because i don't see myself this is an
[1:35:32] apostle speaking here
[1:35:35] again
[1:35:37] i want to make the point
[1:35:38] anybody with me this morning
[1:35:41] change jude spoke about it pastors
[1:35:44] change
[1:35:45] listen being tattooed he has any pulpit
[1:35:47] don't mean you could be faithful to the
[1:35:49] poor people are not faithful to the
[1:35:50] world
[1:35:58] so i want us to understand some things
[1:36:00] friend that this thing about change is
[1:36:02] really deep
[1:36:04] because sometimes it is only be when
[1:36:06] people see us for a long time they
[1:36:07] recognize how much you're different
[1:36:11] pastors ministers elders deacons ushers
[1:36:14] and paul in his wisdom put today in
[1:36:16] scripture for us to see
[1:36:19] his vulnerability and in two places i
[1:36:21] always reference this paul said follow
[1:36:23] me as i follow christ he put a clause a
[1:36:26] limiting clause so i'm not following
[1:36:28] paul till till i did i don't know
[1:36:32] paul said watch me and watch christ and
[1:36:34] don't ever lose sight of christ because
[1:36:36] if i deviate keep following christ and
[1:36:37] forget me you know
[1:36:40] and paul's saying i know what i'm
[1:36:42] preaching this morning is the truth
[1:36:45] if i come and preach any other gospel
[1:36:48] because if my life because paul had his
[1:36:50] struggles he said when i would do good
[1:36:53] evil is present paul going to his own
[1:36:55] experience paul wasn't perfect
[1:36:57] he said if i come back and preach a
[1:36:59] different gospel which means i have
[1:37:01] changed
[1:37:02] i've heard many people say listen that
[1:37:04] preacher he's not preaching like he used
[1:37:05] to anymore
[1:37:07] he doctrine change
[1:37:09] oh you could change your doctrine
[1:37:14] in this message
[1:37:16] when we have one message
[1:37:19] one prophet
[1:37:20] one lord one faith one baptism all the
[1:37:23] word revealed and you have a change in
[1:37:25] doctrine
[1:37:29] that is a mystery
[1:37:32] that is what you call a mystery
[1:37:34] because the revealed word is one plum
[1:37:36] liner
[1:37:37] it'll have 15 plumb line
[1:37:43] can we go a little further
[1:37:45] it's just a conversation this morning to
[1:37:46] help us right
[1:37:52] change
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:54] and realizing
[1:37:56] this thing called change
[1:37:58] the pastor and i have stood behind this
[1:38:00] sacred desk
[1:38:04] and walked couples through their vows
[1:38:09] and we asked them to answer the question
[1:38:12] for better offers
[1:38:15] for richer or poorer
[1:38:18] for sickness or health
[1:38:20] the question is never the person they
[1:38:22] are right now you know
[1:38:27] i want that to sit a little bit
[1:38:30] the moment
[1:38:31] a young brother sister says i do they
[1:38:34] have changed
[1:38:36] every interaction changes you
[1:38:47] so when you say i do at the altar
[1:38:50] you have to realize that you really have
[1:38:52] to say i do to all the future versions
[1:38:55] of this person
[1:38:59] and what this person will become
[1:39:03] that is what makes it love and
[1:39:05] commitment
[1:39:07] i've never seen a couple leave you alter
[1:39:10] with a desire to fail
[1:39:14] but i've heard many couples said i've
[1:39:16] grown apart
[1:39:22] which men they did not change together
[1:39:26] they change in separate directions
[1:39:33] and unless you understand that we are in
[1:39:36] a changing world with changing people
[1:39:39] and the only content is god then you end
[1:39:42] up in a rude awakening that the person
[1:39:45] you married five years 10 years 15 years
[1:39:48] 20 years ago is actually not the person
[1:39:49] who walked at the altar
[1:39:53] you've both been through some stuff
[1:39:57] that change your perspective
[1:40:00] change your expectations
[1:40:02] change your hopes and change your dreams
[1:40:10] the only constant who was at that
[1:40:13] wedding was god
[1:40:14] because even the officiated minister
[1:40:17] would have changed
[1:40:18] the guess in the wedding would have
[1:40:20] changed
[1:40:23] friends we're going into a kind of
[1:40:24] mature kind of conversation
[1:40:27] how much grace we must have if we
[1:40:30] realize the person we're talking to is
[1:40:32] not the same person we married
[1:40:34] it is impossible
[1:40:36] for it to be the same person
[1:40:39] because that's not how life is
[1:40:42] change is
[1:40:48] guaranteed the child in your house last
[1:40:51] week monday and this monday is two
[1:40:53] different children
[1:40:56] simply going to school
[1:40:58] simply doing school work simply learning
[1:41:00] a new topic simply hearing something
[1:41:03] they are changing
[1:41:04] and if they're not anchored to the
[1:41:06] constant of god they could change so
[1:41:08] much they lose their connection to god
[1:41:12] i hope this helps somebody this morning
[1:41:21] i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:41:25] how has this pandemic changed you
[1:41:32] are you more consecrated or less
[1:41:34] consecrated
[1:41:37] do you have a greater desire to serve
[1:41:39] god
[1:41:40] or you're just going through the
[1:41:41] emotions
[1:41:45] i can't say it for you you know you have
[1:41:47] to answer it for yourself
[1:41:50] do you realize how you have changed and
[1:41:51] then if you change i've been over
[1:41:53] preached many times if you're behind you
[1:41:55] either stay behind or you do something
[1:41:57] to catch up and make up the distance you
[1:41:59] know
[1:42:04] just a few more and i've done this
[1:42:06] morning
[1:42:07] from the message who is this then if
[1:42:09] that is true a supernatural god cannot
[1:42:11] change his nature to fit people's nature
[1:42:15] people has to change
[1:42:18] their nature to fit god's supernatural
[1:42:21] plans
[1:42:26] that's why people cry who is this is god
[1:42:28] in the midst of his people they don't
[1:42:29] understand it god will never come to
[1:42:31] your level
[1:42:32] you have to come to his
[1:42:34] god will not come to your requirement
[1:42:36] you have to come to god's and then when
[1:42:39] that requirement is met upon a promise
[1:42:42] that god made to redeem the people if
[1:42:45] that requirement has met your entire
[1:42:47] being changes your thinking changes your
[1:42:50] habits change everything about you
[1:42:53] changes your desires change your livings
[1:42:56] change your habits change you change
[1:42:58] everything about you changes god is a
[1:43:00] new life in you and that's the hope
[1:43:03] that's the expectation that's my desire
[1:43:07] is anybody looking for a change

[1:47:00] people oh god help me to see the change
[1:47:02] this morning change from glory to glory

[1:47:07] the old wretched man that you came in
[1:47:10] this morning and you're leaving
[1:47:11] different because your mind been opened
[1:47:14] you've been rebooted you've been renewed
[1:47:17] by a chance from in power that lets you
[1:47:20] know that the unchanging god is still
[1:47:23] more unable to open the red sea in your
[1:47:26] life that the unchanging god is still
[1:47:29] able to help you deal with the goliath
[1:47:31] that's waiting for you at home it's
[1:47:34] going to be power coming into you to
[1:47:36] deal with your oppositions can the
[1:47:39] church say amen
[1:47:41] [Applause]
[1:47:47] what are you speaking about preacher
[1:47:49] a change in your nature
[1:47:51] because when your nature changes
[1:47:53] your words change
[1:47:55] when your nature changes your walk
[1:47:57] change when your nature changes your
[1:48:00] love changes that's why the bible says i
[1:48:02] give you a new heart i'll give you a new
[1:48:04] spirit and i'm going to put my holy
[1:48:06] spirit inside of there but abraham said
[1:48:09] your heart
[1:48:10] and your spirit can't even get along
[1:48:12] with yourself father let's get along
[1:48:14] with your wife take it along with your
[1:48:16] neighbor to get along with the co-worker
[1:48:18] but if i change your nature and put a
[1:48:20] new nature in there i don't want a
[1:48:23] change that comes from an education i
[1:48:25] don't want a change that comes from
[1:48:27] being in the message i don't want to
[1:48:28] change of understanding but abraham's
[1:48:30] ministry all that is fine but the real
[1:48:33] change i want is a change in my heart
[1:48:36] because when i have to go to the rapture
[1:48:37] express it's really assessing how much
[1:48:40] you change because this mortal have to
[1:48:43] change into immortality you see that
[1:48:45] kind of change that's what i'm talking
[1:48:47] about i thank god that he doesn't change
[1:48:50] but we could change to be just like him
[1:48:52] or somebody help me this morning i thank
[1:48:55] god that he does not change but it is
[1:48:58] possible it is possible for me to change
[1:49:04] hallelujah
[1:49:07] somebody gave god a shout out praise
[1:49:09] you could change this morning you could
[1:49:11] change on being dead to being on fire
[1:49:14] you could change from being a backslider
[1:49:17] to being on the front line up you could
[1:49:19] change on being a church member to be
[1:49:22] identified in the pride you could change
[1:49:24] from being a make-believer to being a
[1:49:26] true believer you could change from an
[1:49:28] unbeliever into a son of god
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:38] you may be seated i'm almost finished
[1:49:41] you cannot make a man
[1:49:43] see the word of god
[1:49:45] till his nature has been changed
[1:49:47] that's from her but abraham and broken
[1:49:49] systems but when his nature is changed
[1:49:52] from what he is
[1:49:53] to a son of god and the holy ghost comes
[1:49:56] into him oh my that's a different man oh
[1:49:59] i want to be different i don't want to
[1:50:01] be church different i want to be had
[1:50:03] different i want to leave this service
[1:50:05] this morning and the devil said where
[1:50:07] you went
[1:50:08] what you did oh hallelujah hallelujah is
[1:50:11] not just shouting and jumping it's not
[1:50:13] just shouting and jumping listen the
[1:50:15] devil wasn't moved when they had the day
[1:50:17] of the pentecost you know but you see
[1:50:20] when peter went by the gate called
[1:50:21] beautiful and say
[1:50:23] stand up
[1:50:25] rise up on your feet
[1:50:26] silver and gold i don't have but such as
[1:50:29] i have
[1:50:30] peter had a change that he could express
[1:50:33] he had a change it wasn't a book it
[1:50:36] wasn't a tape it was not testimony it
[1:50:38] wasn't a word of encouragement it wasn't
[1:50:41] you could make it no it was a change
[1:50:44] that he could express and pass on it was
[1:50:46] power because this gospel is not in word
[1:50:50] only but it is in power and
[1:50:51] demonstration that's the change i'm
[1:50:53] talking about
[1:50:56] you may be seated
[1:50:58] you may be seated
[1:51:00] don't put anybody in a bucket
[1:51:02] because thank god we could change
[1:51:04] god could change anybody don't put
[1:51:06] nobody in a bucket
[1:51:08] don't put anybody in a bucket don't
[1:51:10] leave your children in a bucket don't
[1:51:12] show nobody outside don't write off
[1:51:15] nobody or because god to change anybody
[1:51:18] look at paul when he was saul he was
[1:51:20] persecuting the church nobody thought
[1:51:23] that that soul could ever ever be in
[1:51:26] church far less to be a messenger far
[1:51:29] less to be an apostle but god had other
[1:51:31] plans and brother saul who oversaw the
[1:51:35] stoning of stephen was the same soul
[1:51:38] when he was in a mission to do more
[1:51:40] damage god met him and that encounter
[1:51:43] with god changed saul
[1:51:45] to a man called paul
[1:51:47] and that man called paul became the
[1:51:49] messenger who wrote most of that new
[1:51:52] testament don't put anybody in a bucket
[1:51:54] i don't care who they are the same god
[1:51:57] that delivered you could deliver them
[1:51:59] the same god that helped you could help
[1:52:01] them the same god that restored you
[1:52:04] could restore them i don't care who it
[1:52:06] is if it's anybody god should have said
[1:52:09] never let him in would have been paul
[1:52:11] because he was there to kill stephen but
[1:52:14] god hallelujah he's a sovereign god and
[1:52:18] he doesn't change don't deny god his
[1:52:20] sovereignty this morning to deliver your
[1:52:23] son to deliver your daughter to deliver
[1:52:25] your wife to deliver your husband
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:33] if god said it coming then they're
[1:52:35] coming rejoice for them and it's
[1:52:38] maturity for you rejoice with them and
[1:52:41] thank god for them even if they hurt you
[1:52:44] look at the prodigal son
[1:52:46] nobody thought he was coming back home
[1:52:48] but the father in his heart said oh god
[1:52:50] i hope something changed he leave here
[1:52:53] one way i know that boy i potentially
[1:52:55] know but i hope he go through something
[1:52:57] that bring him back to his senses
[1:52:59] meanwhile in the midst of the pig pen a
[1:53:02] change has taken place and the prodigal
[1:53:05] son the bible says he came to his senses
[1:53:08] oh god thank god for somebody
[1:53:11] experiences that change us to bring us
[1:53:14] back to our senses
[1:53:16] [Applause]
[1:53:19] oh god
[1:53:20] brother pop well every interaction
[1:53:24] every experience changes us this boy who
[1:53:27] was a prodigal son he had left home one
[1:53:30] way but he went through some stuff
[1:53:35] he went through some stuff
[1:53:37] and the stuff that he went through
[1:53:39] changed him
[1:53:41] every time he ate pig food
[1:53:43] it was changing him
[1:53:45] when he looked around him
[1:53:47] and he saw it
[1:53:48] and his mind captured it he said this
[1:53:51] copyright
[1:53:52] he looked at it one day
[1:53:54] he looked at it another day he eat pig
[1:53:56] food the next day after a while these
[1:53:59] experiences added up brother clarence to
[1:54:02] a change in who he was
[1:54:04] until he mastered the courage
[1:54:06] overcame the embarrassment throw down
[1:54:09] his pride to say i will arise i will go
[1:54:13] back to my father i will say i have
[1:54:15] sinned i will say i have messed up
[1:54:22] friends you may be seated
[1:54:28] he was eating pig food for a while
[1:54:31] stuff wasn't bad enough
[1:54:34] until he had to come to his senses
[1:54:36] he was out
[1:54:38] of his own senses
[1:54:40] until he started to realize he said wait
[1:54:42] a minute
[1:54:43] not even my father's servants
[1:54:46] going through this thing here
[1:54:48] listen it's a shift in his mind
[1:54:51] he had to change from even thinking as a
[1:54:53] son
[1:54:56] friends
[1:54:57] he went back not as a son you know
[1:55:01] he went back in a servant mindset you
[1:55:04] know
[1:55:06] the courage he mustered
[1:55:08] the experience he went through changed
[1:55:10] him so much he didn't come back as a son
[1:55:12] with an entitlement of daddy i'm home
[1:55:15] enough what encouraged him is when he
[1:55:17] thought of the servants he said but wait
[1:55:20] a minute
[1:55:22] his experience changed his thinking so
[1:55:24] much
[1:55:25] he said even his servants but wait a
[1:55:27] minute
[1:55:28] if i'm not qualified to be your son but
[1:55:31] even his servants eaten better than this
[1:55:34] and that it was enough motivation he
[1:55:37] left a son and in his mind came back a
[1:55:40] servant didn't even realize that once a
[1:55:43] son you always a son

[1:56:27] love not changing he is looking out for
