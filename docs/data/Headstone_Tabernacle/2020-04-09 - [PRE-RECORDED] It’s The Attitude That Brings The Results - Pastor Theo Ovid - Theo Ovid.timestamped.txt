[25:21] amen God bless you if the Bible is when
[25:24] I get it into the one scripture Luke
[25:25] chapter 24
[25:27] we want to read from verse 49 to 53
[25:29] thank you so much for coming out tonight
[25:31] and creating such an atmosphere
[25:36] Luke chapter 24
[25:38] I want to read from verse 49
[25:41] to 53 and this is Jesus words in verse
[25:45] 49 is read
[25:48] Luke 24 49. and behold I send the
[25:51] promise of my father upon you
[25:53] but tari in The Siege of Jerusalem
[25:56] until you've been jeweled power from on
[25:58] high
[25:59] and you let them out as fast to Bethany
[26:01] and he lifted up his hands and blessed
[26:04] them
[26:04] and it came to pass while he blessed
[26:06] them he was parted from them and carried
[26:09] up into heaven and they worshiped him
[26:11] and returned to Jerusalem with great joy
[26:15] and we're continually in the temple
[26:17] prison and blessing God Amen may God
[26:19] bless his word you may be seated
[26:22] o praise the name of the Lord
[26:24] thank you Lord Jesus
[26:26] tonight
[26:28] our title is the attitude that brings
[26:30] the results
[26:32] is the attitude that brings results and
[26:36] I have an inspiration on the atmosphere
[26:37] of Jose perfection
[26:41] I want to encourage you tonight to stay
[26:45] in the wood
[26:47] stay in the atmosphere
[26:50] of the word
[26:52] if you're in the wrong atmosphere you
[26:54] cannot get the results that you're
[26:56] looking for
[26:58] so we want to share some things with you
[26:59] tonight that we feel upon our hearts
[27:01] that will help you and strengthen you
[27:03] and edify you and the prophet was spoken
[27:06] about a message a personal experience
[27:07] with God 1954 and it was chained about
[27:10] Moses how Moses has been a bit had been
[27:13] a bit of failure
[27:15] for yet knowing that God is going to the
[27:17] liberation of Israel by him yet trying
[27:19] to do it within himself
[27:22] 40 years before that become a failure
[27:25] had lost all the vision of Victory and
[27:28] of the freedom of the people enslaved
[27:31] see when you lost the vision you you
[27:34] just doesn't have the burden anymore
[27:37] to do what needs to be done because if
[27:40] God call you qualified job
[27:42] he called you to enlist you into his
[27:44] program his Plan of Redemption isn't
[27:46] that right and the prophet I wonder
[27:48] sometimes if we the church knowing that
[27:50] God is promised to deliver the church
[27:52] from its Sin from its sickness and to
[27:55] make us our people our salty people and
[27:57] the Earth will hunger and thirst after I
[28:00] wander in our human efforts in our
[28:02] theologies and so forth our great fine
[28:04] buildings and so forth as we try to
[28:06] present the people many years ago we
[28:08] found it has failed because we took it
[28:11] in ourselves to do so we took it upon
[28:13] ourselves to have new schools educate
[28:15] ministers we left off the real principle
[28:18] the real thing that God told us to
[28:20] receive was to let the Holy Spirit lead
[28:23] the church
[28:24] we have left that off we have lost our
[28:26] divine joy and division is dull now
[28:30] so when that Joy is there you can't wait
[28:32] to come to church you can't wait to be
[28:34] in service you can't wait to be in the
[28:35] presence of God because this is your
[28:37] Source this is your inspiration this is
[28:40] where you're getting your join from
[28:41] isn't that right
[28:43] people are not looking for the coming of
[28:45] the Lord yet atomic bombs hanging
[28:46] everywhere people have lost their vision
[28:48] of the Lord because they have set times
[28:50] that the Lord will come a certain time
[28:52] and I've done all these things how can
[28:54] we do those things without the Holy
[28:55] Spirit Moses have been a bit of failure
[28:58] but oh dear we see the tension attracted
[29:01] to a burning bush
[29:02] it's not right fire attracts the people
[29:04] now watch Fear take a hole right quick
[29:07] when Moses turned aside to consider this
[29:10] building tree God spoke to him a fresh
[29:13] Vision By An Angel
[29:16] so when revision get done sometimes God
[29:18] have to give you a fresh word
[29:20] a fresh anointed a fresh inspiration a
[29:23] fresh fire amen that I'd still you up
[29:26] again to the vision of God that God has
[29:30] put inside your soul
[29:32] that's what the church need tonight
[29:33] watch watch now watch Faith take a hole
[29:36] right quick the old things pass away
[29:37] Moses no has a new vision he has a
[29:41] revelation he has an experience vision
[29:45] revelation
[29:47] and experience he had met God
[29:50] he had talked to God before that he had
[29:53] not met God he only read and knowed what
[29:56] his mother had told him
[29:58] by hearing what his mother told him but
[30:00] what the pastor said but now Moses had a
[30:04] personal experience
[30:05] so you read this book with books you're
[30:07] not going to Prophet Elijah like what
[30:10] you read that's what you receive that's
[30:12] what you understand but now you have to
[30:14] get your personal experience with God
[30:17] not reading a book not listening to a
[30:20] tape but with the same Pillar of Fire
[30:23] Oh Glory to God because that's still a
[30:25] fire come to activate the sons of God
[30:29] Oh Glory to God could somebody say Amen
[30:33] that Pillar of Fire come to activate the
[30:36] sons of God so you should want to be God
[30:38] activated
[30:40] oh not intellectually activated God has
[30:43] like every scripture is God breed the
[30:46] Breath of God is upon this word
[30:48] oh Hallelujah
[30:51] that's what the church needs tonight is
[30:53] stop studying so much Theology and get
[30:56] them to the Altar and pray until a
[30:59] personal experience building down in a
[31:02] human heart and burns out all the
[31:04] dullness and gives a new vision
[31:07] Oh Glory to God we need a fresh altar
[31:09] call
[31:10] every man at the altar every man
[31:13] repented every man crying out
[31:16] Bible said enjoy let the priests hold on
[31:19] to the horns of the altar let him cry
[31:21] for the wine and cry for the oil and
[31:24] then God said in Joel too and I will
[31:26] restore to you the years that don't look
[31:28] as eaten the Palmer woman eaten when
[31:32] after they cry out
[31:33] all glory to God he said what we believe
[31:36] in the prayer meeting to say Lord send
[31:39] on the adoption
[31:41] God we are teaching for 40 plus years
[31:44] it's time for fire it's time for power
[31:47] Oh Glory to God we have to create the
[31:50] atmosphere because the atmosphere is
[31:54] what you're gonna get the results
[31:56] [Applause]
[31:58] Hallelujah
[32:00] glory to God Amen
[32:02] maybe seated praise God praise God
[32:06] amen
[32:08] faith in God it's a staggering to many
[32:11] people and we ought to be ashamed
[32:13] ourselves to confess we don't have faith
[32:15] in God first there's cowards who died
[32:17] ten thousand deaths
[32:19] while they're here on Earth
[32:20] hero Never Dies his memory lingers on
[32:23] for his Eric deeds and usually there we
[32:26] go people who are Faith are people who
[32:29] have experience
[32:30] experience brings faith
[32:33] Oh Glory to God you hear what you hear
[32:36] that experience brings Faith so when
[32:39] Moses met that Pillar of Fire nobody
[32:41] could stop Moses to tell him and talk
[32:45] him out of going back to Egypt and if
[32:47] they asked Moses where are you going he
[32:49] said to take over
[32:51] Oh Glory to God what he couldn't do in
[32:54] 40 years he was doing instantly because
[32:57] he met the pillar of fire and barabanam
[33:00] stood and prophesied he said God will do
[33:04] in one year what all theologians failed
[33:08] to do in 2000 years you wait till that
[33:13] little Remnant that God's gonna give
[33:15] that Elijah we Pinnacle to call him God
[33:18] can be a national Showdown there'll be a
[33:21] power strike the church that you have
[33:23] never seen before you wait it's coming
[33:27] it's coming it's coming
[33:30] Oh Glory to God these are not plain
[33:34] words every word is a seed he said wait
[33:37] till them servant on this after their
[33:39] voices that that people who could take
[33:41] the word and hand it there
[33:43] Oklahoma strikes and cut they can shut
[33:46] the heavens they could do whatever they
[33:48] want to do
[33:50] [Applause]
[33:54] we don't have to ask permission for God
[33:56] to deliver your family we letting your
[33:58] family go you say Pharaoh let them go
[34:01] you are free tonight loose them and let
[34:05] them go
[34:07] Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[34:10] praise God
[34:12] Hallelujah
[34:14] Hallelujah
[34:16] not the preacher experiences your
[34:18] experience you have to get your own
[34:20] experience and your experience Being Fit
[34:22] when then goes in our Prophet says back
[34:25] to the faith of the fathers that when we
[34:26] have go back to an experience that the
[34:29] father has had because they had an
[34:30] experience Hallelujah and Jesus send
[34:34] them in the upper room they give them
[34:36] the promise of the father and the Bible
[34:38] said they were in the upper room they
[34:40] were praising and blessing God
[34:42] continually what were they doing they
[34:45] were creating an atmosphere and they
[34:47] were staying in the atmosphere it all
[34:49] depends upon your attitude that's gonna
[34:52] bring the results but we have to create
[34:54] an atmosphere the atmosphere is what
[34:56] makes a difference oh the song leader
[34:59] was singing tonight and he didn't know
[35:00] what to do the anointing and building is
[35:03] the atmosphere a takeaway the blues if
[35:06] we move your frustration it affects the
[35:09] bad day you had today it corrects all of
[35:12] that what this does it is the atmosphere
[35:15] of the Holy spirit that was her power
[35:18] the episode of God we need that
[35:21] atmosphere you want that atmosphere you
[35:24] want it in your house you want it in the
[35:25] kitchen you want it when you leave out
[35:27] when you leave the home you walk that
[35:29] atmosphere
[35:30] [Music]
[35:33] [Applause]
[35:35] [Music]
[35:39] you want to bring your home
[35:42] under that atmosphere let's continue the
[35:44] wood is a seed Mexico Fellowship 1955
[35:46] and the seed won't grow unless it's
[35:48] placed in the right kind of ground so
[35:51] the sea is not the problem
[35:53] is the atmosphere or the ground right
[35:56] wrong everybody sit on top of here it's
[35:58] not going at all because it's not for
[36:00] seeds

[49:03] it's the reason
[49:06] the reason at Pentecost they had to go
[49:09] in an upper room and pray until the Holy
[49:12] Ghost came cause they got in one place
[49:15] and one Accord it's the atmosphere that
[49:18] brings the results
[49:20] aha
[49:22] all right attitude bring the results and
[49:24] the atmosphere bring the results so God
[49:26] sent them there to wait until they have
[49:30] the right atmosphere because Holy Ghost
[49:32] can't come down and dry holy ghosts
[49:35] they take an atmosphere to meet the
[49:38] atmosphere
[49:39] [Music]
[49:46] listen listen when Jesus died those guys
[49:49] were under depression and frustration

[49:55] who's sad and organizing like that even
[49:58] the woman the sisters had more
[49:59] Revelation expression than some of them
[50:01] brothers because the Angels tell them

[50:30] come you wanna touch come and touch come
[50:32] on touch don't run now come and touch he

[50:43] heart to believe all what I said
[50:45] this was showing you all the time that I

[1:02:46] wheelchair he said the angel was present
[1:02:48] the atmosphere was there sometimes they
[1:02:51] see people around talking about this
[1:02:52] milky white anything happen all things
[1:02:55] are possible pillar fire moving Faith
[1:02:58] reaching up everywhere demons calling

[1:03:02] they don't want to go and a prophet with
[1:03:05] authority there to cast out devils and
