[43:35] chapter one going to read from verse
[43:37] twelve to nineteen given thanks unto the
[43:45] Father which had made us meet to be
[43:48] partakers of inheritance of the scenes
[43:50] in light who had delivered us from the
[43:52] power of darkness and hath translated us
[43:56] into the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[43:59] we have redemption through his blood
[44:02] even the forgiveness of sin who is in
[44:05] the image of the invisible God the
[44:07] firstborn of every creature
[44:10] so by him all things created in heaven
[44:14] and that is visible and invisible
[44:17] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[44:20] principalities or powers all things are
[44:23] created by him and for him and he is
[44:27] before all things and by him all things
[44:31] consist
[44:32] and he is the head of the body the
[44:34] church who is the beginning the
[44:38] firstborn from the dead that in all

[44:44] it pleased the father that in him should
[44:46] also this dwell let us pray one more
[44:48] time father we thank you for your word

[45:10] praise
[45:13] [Applause]
[45:20] keep your Bibles close to you we want to
[45:22] read an extra shortly but before that I
[45:24] wanna give the title and the title is
[45:26] pleased in the body of Christ our
[45:31] subject many members one body
[45:35] I'll have an inspiration rebuilding the
[45:38] church by the spirit okay
[45:42] many members one body rebuild that is by
[45:45] the spirit I want to go into first
[45:48] Corinthians up to 12
[45:57] and I want to reform verse four
[46:05] let's go read in Chapter 12
[46:16] everybody fine it King now there are
[46:21] diversities of gifts but the same spirit
[46:24] there are differences of
[46:26] administration's but the same Lord and
[46:30] there are diversities of operations but
[46:33] it is the same God which worketh all in
[46:37] all and the manifestation of the Spirit
[46:41] is given to every man to profit without
[46:44] for one to one is given by the spirit
[46:48] the word of wisdom to another the word
[46:51] of knowledge by the same spirit to
[46:54] another feed by the same spirit to
[46:58] another the gifts of healing by the same
[47:02] spirit to another the working of
[47:05] miracles to another prophecy to another
[47:08] discerning of spirits to another divers
[47:12] kinds of tongues to another the
[47:16] interpretation of tongues but all these
[47:19] work it that one the cells in spirit
[47:24] divine and each man severally as you
[47:27] will for as the body is one and have
[47:31] many members and all the members of that
[47:36] one body so also is Christ for by one
[47:42] spirit are we all baptized into one body
[47:46] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[47:50] we be bond or free and have been all
[47:55] made to drink into one spirit for the
[48:00] body is not one member but many and if
[48:05] the foot shall say because I am NOT the
[48:08] hand I am NOT of the body is it
[48:11] therefore not of the body under the air
[48:14] shall say because I am NOT the eye I am
[48:17] NOT of the body is it therefore not of
[48:19] the body if the whole body one I wear
[48:23] with a hearing
[48:24] if the whole body was hearing where
[48:27] would the smellin but now God had set
[48:30] the members every one of them in the
[48:33] body as it had pleased him and if there
[48:38] were all one member where were the body
[48:41] but now are there many members yet but
[48:45] one body and the eye cannot say unto the
[48:49] hand I have no need of thee nor again
[48:52] the head to the feet I have no need of
[48:54] you need much more those members of the
[48:57] body which seemed to be feeble are
[49:03] necessary are you with me for those
[49:07] members of the body which we think to be
[49:09] less honorable God upon these will be so
[49:12] much abundant honour and our uncomely
[49:14] parts have more abundant comeliness for
[49:18] our comely parts have no need but got a
[49:20] tempered the body together having given
[49:23] more abundant honor to the part which
[49:26] lacked that there should be the purpose
[49:29] is that there should be no schism in the
[49:31] body and that the members should have
[49:33] the same care one for another and
[49:37] whether one mum one member suffer all
[49:39] the members suffer with it one one
[49:42] member be honored all the members
[49:44] rejoice with it
[49:46] know ye are the body of Christ and
[49:48] members in particular may God bless his
[49:51] word oh praise his wonderful name
[49:54] hallelujah praise God so we tank over
[49:58] the scripture reading Ephesians 5 50
[50:00] says for we are members of his body of
[50:01] his flesh and of his bones we are
[50:06] actually members we have one body and we
[50:08] are hands we are feet we have ears and
[50:10] eyes and so on it's not one member isn't
[50:13] a body but many members in that body so
[50:16] too is the body of Christ and Christ and
[50:18] that Christ's body will have many
[50:19] members so many members buddy is not
[50:22] right and you have to be placed in that
[50:24] body now whistling Joshua now we still
[50:27] in Ephesians we still in the land of
[50:30] promise where you have to drive the
[50:32] enemy out and
[50:33] come into your possession to possess
[50:35] what you know is your own you cannot
[50:38] possess if you don't know what is your
[50:40] own therefore what is your own has to be
[50:43] revealed to you and then that gives the
[50:46] faith to go and possess now go don't
[50:49] want to observe the land watch the land
[50:52] God want you to possess the land that is
[50:55] why God tells just what all this is the
[50:57] men go out and go to the land and come
[51:00] and bring a description of the land the
[51:03] description is evidence you've been
[51:05] through the land you cannot describe
[51:07] what you did not see you cannot describe
[51:09] what it is an experience the fact that
[51:12] just relax our description mean these
[51:14] guys walk through the land and God want
[51:16] you to walk you your land you have to
[51:19] know your scriptures you have to know
[51:21] your promise
[51:22] that's why Jesus could go to the land
[51:24] and find the place where it is written
[51:26] the Spirit is upon me because he has
[51:29] anointed me he had the famous scriptures
[51:32] where a Branham had to find Malachi for
[51:34] Luke 17 13 is not right
[51:36] revelation 10 7 you have to find a
[51:38] scripture and we get anointed though
[51:41] when he began to discover it he didn't
[51:43] manifest the scriptures just yet but he
[51:45] was connected to it he had to believe I
[51:47] am that my gosh Scripture he had to
[51:50] believe I am that Elijah that was
[51:51] prophesied yes believe the spirit Elijah
[51:54] is appointed you have to believe that Oh
[51:56] glory to God yet I look back and see he
[51:59] was that seven angels messenger he had
[52:02] to look in the scripture and see he
[52:04] would reveal the Son of man that was his
[52:07] picture what about your scripture these
[52:10] signs shall follow them that believe
[52:11] that's your scripture he has and a half
[52:14] of the true impact of a ton of others
[52:17] that's your scripture the spirit and the
[52:19] bride say come
[52:20] that's your scripture the same work I do
[52:23] shall you do also
[52:24] that's your scripture you a scripture
[52:27] also thank you have to begin to believe
[52:30] an annoying
[52:32] Oh hallelujah glory Nevada Dalila
[52:39] all right thank you Jesus
[52:48] killing evil nor run no whiskey no smoke
[52:53] no ganja no cigarette
[52:58] brothers growing up
[53:00] and God say come and worship me let me
[53:03] see your revelation of who I am King
[53:07] what's ours he ever got this blood God
[53:12] confirmed it as revelation and reject
[53:18] the king
[53:19] but in that rejection got with the door
[53:23] he said King if you do like your brother
[53:26] just follow because he has revelation
[53:29] just follow him if you do what he does
[53:32] I'll bless you the scene could be given
[53:36] a lot a shout in the house
[53:39] so even if you don't have a revelation
[53:41] you could do like others who have
[53:44] revelation and get the same blessing for
[53:51] the Brenham and the only way that one
[53:55] was received could have done anything
[53:57] different um his brother it was revealed
[54:00] to him and Hebrews 11 said by Saint Abel
[54:04] offered unto God a more excellent
[54:06] sacrifice than of came with God
[54:09] testified he was righteous just the
[54:13] offering of the sacrifice God give
[54:15] testimony so that's a righteous man
[54:18] demanded I could do anything just bring
[54:21] a sacrifice and go set up and righteous
[54:23] see the seed of evil Oh hallelujah
[54:27] praise God blessed is the man that God
[54:31] will impute righteousness or glory the
[54:34] body man without wealth do you
[54:40] understand when God pronounced you are
[54:42] right now you are right because that's
[54:45] the pronouncement of God you have to
[54:48] change that your sins can change that
[54:50] what your family did can change that
[54:53] what your father my mother pregnant
[54:55] mother did establish that that's a
[54:58] pronouncement of good will get a lot of
[55:01] shows in the house I want to free you
[55:04] from your path leave and what the devil
[55:06] told you free you from what your family
[55:09] did forget about it
[55:11] [Applause]
[55:16] that's why Jesus said who does men say i
[55:20] the son of man are they talking talking
[55:23] talking what they saying about me some
[55:25] see your son the Baptist some see or
[55:26] something he lasts until you're dead
[55:28] some say that he says who do you say I
[55:30] am and they got caught following a man
[55:36] to clean our fears the deloria is a nice
[55:38] man is a good man he does new miracles
[55:40] he'd be moving different he have a
[55:42] higher level higher authority who is
[55:44] this man over sudden Peter Siddhartha
[55:47] Christ Son of the Living God
[55:50] and then Jesus a flesh and blood has not
[55:53] revealed it to you you then read it in a
[55:55] book you didn't get my email you're
[55:57] gonna get my text nobody I was talking

[56:25] the true church upon this rock or porous
[56:29] we are crystal and good structure they
[56:32] are passive and vegan but not what he's
[56:35] talking about
[56:36] he then says a man will billet upon this
[56:38] rock what that rock upon this revelation
[56:41] that means he has to reveal himself upon
[56:45] this rock I will build my church not
[56:49] upon the information come on now not
[56:51] upon the knowledge come on now but when
[56:53] the Spirit revealed to you I don't care
[56:56] what the devil used to be trapped this
[56:57] morning you could be the hell hole this
[56:59] morning but if God revealed themselves
[57:02] to you the dead butter did

[57:56] me they've gotta be obstacles there's
[58:01] gotta be a war on chemical and we could
[58:03] know that God could bring down the walls
[58:05] that's why that's why there was a
[58:07] Jericho that we cannot save in a lab is
[58:09] Glock admit impossible possible yes yes
[58:13] yes what could open up the Red Sea what
[58:16] to make away there is no way you're

[58:57] remember an ammonia kicked out the
[59:02] gardening they got kicked out but that
[59:05] means of evil from getting revelation
[59:08] because sons and daughters are you ready
[59:12] have the ability to hear I'm God without
[59:21] anybody in between we preach the word
[59:29] but we can reveal the word we preach the
[59:33] word but the Holy Ghost is the revealer
[59:36] what we preach so you're hearing it but
[59:40] baguette dropped amicus tear your
[59:44] couldn't hear me
[59:46] keep did not yell me this morning if
[59:48] you're not you'll be shouting then we
[59:53] are preaching this morning the word
[59:54] between me and you the wood coming out
[59:57] but the Spirit is hanging over
[1:00:03] let me see them
[1:00:05] that's why Hebrew says the word didn't
[1:00:07] profit them because it wasn't mixed with
[1:00:10] faith to them that said it so even
[1:00:13] though two million was Aaron Moses is
[1:00:15] only Joshua and Caleb had divine
[1:00:18] revelation after what to possess so it's
[1:00:22] not the multitude Emily Jesus always
[1:00:23] mixed is the election is the multitude
[1:00:26] that could catch divine revelation I
[1:00:29] knew by inspiration
[1:00:32] young-min this morning Oklahoma in the
[1:00:35] spirit world did we didn't understand it
[1:00:38] when Jesus was walking on the water and
[1:00:42] Peter said Lord is that you bid me to
[1:00:45] come Jesus said one word come if I had a
[1:00:51] choice I still write it but getting
[1:00:55] frightened by the second we had a choice
[1:00:57] even whereas the Lord of Musa pon me
[1:01:00] Lord in the name of Jesus Lord sanctify
[1:01:02] me another way will be to walk this
[1:01:03] world no he didn't go down the parameter
[1:01:04] mode he just said what would come and he
[1:01:08] stepped up he stepped out and he gets a
[1:01:11] walk just like Jesus giving us to walk
[1:01:14] on the water just like Jesus it was
[1:01:16] Jesus it must be the obeying Jesus and
[1:01:20] if God tell you walk this morning walk
[1:01:24] ah
[1:01:29] oh my let me do it
[1:01:36] Oh some of you weakened here the walls
[1:01:38] come down before yourself
[1:01:40] he didn't tell them that he said shout
[1:01:45] something was up when I did you the show
[1:01:52] don't buy the tumor the doctor de Gama
[1:01:55] humor so great a doctor pay irises so
[1:02:00] then the doctor give up on you but don't
[1:02:03] give up on God
[1:02:05] [Applause]
[1:02:17] levena when you could shot before I was
[1:02:21] coming on the prove your feet when you
[1:02:25] could stagger not at the promise of God
[1:02:26] on the leaf but strong giving praise to
[1:02:29] God and you do have evidence of that
[1:02:31] trial a better speed when you could tell
[1:02:35] you that is not the test at the hem of a
[1:02:36] garment and push between men legs and
[1:02:39] push men outside I'm pressed and push
[1:02:42] and push the cart or get got to walk it
[1:02:45] over the loss of breathing people talk
[1:02:48] talk talk but when the time come to
[1:02:51] apply your faith your situation doctors
[1:02:55] when it matters I might be some
[1:02:58] everybody inside of here because there's
[1:03:06] no other Christ may be seated upon he
[1:03:08] shows up in my church he said blessed
[1:03:10] are thou Simon John but Jonah flesh and
[1:03:12] blood never reveal to you my father
[1:03:14] which is in heaven has revealed to you
[1:03:17] upon this rock I'll build my church
[1:03:19] what what does it profit the true
[1:03:23] revelation of the way there is The True
[1:03:27] Vine again in up to Revelation is a
[1:03:30] false revelation it's a revelation I
[1:03:33] have intellectual reasoning as I said
[1:03:37] Thursday night a bunch of Ministers know
[1:03:39] how to call them ticklers they are not
[1:03:42] aesthetically here's the people and they
[1:03:44] are silly women leading with divers
[1:03:46] lusts happily is itching he a new
[1:03:48] doctrine new teaching new evolutionary
[1:03:50] devil just have it for them because I
[1:03:52] don't want to hear it will ring right
[1:03:54] because if it will ring you have to be
[1:03:57] careful they don't want to prepare for
[1:03:59] it you if you know it will have dynamics
[1:04:02] the Holy Ghost is about to pour out you
[1:04:04] cannot make preparations for it because
[1:04:06] faith which is revelation brings
[1:04:08] preparation brings expectations for the
[1:04:12] manifest
[1:04:14] do you see it
[1:04:17] Abraham got a revelation Isaac of Syria
[1:04:20] God did not I love what God that he did
[1:04:23] not talk to Sarah
[1:04:25] so Sarah have no encouragement for
[1:04:27] Abraham Abraham I'm back you me many men
[1:04:31] save a cantina even Sarah Hauer all
[1:04:34] horrors because his old woman a couple
[1:04:38] faith to believe in this power that
[1:04:41] Abram testifying about but God told
[1:04:44] Abram to Sarah when Terra Cotta to
[1:04:50] believe she introduced Abraham to Hagar
[1:04:53] she had a interpretation with a belief
[1:04:56] but Sarah
[1:04:58] so Abraham can rely upon zero absolute a
[1:05:01] boxer because my wife a encouragement is
[1:05:04] that right
[1:05:06] in which Bible you find nothing this one
[1:05:10] this I encourage myself you have not
[1:05:14] seen nobody in Sigma that's that's cool
[1:05:16] nobody ain't call me that's cool you

[1:20:46] a shout Oh hallelujah
[1:20:49] when my back was against the wall and it
[1:20:53] looked like it was all over but you may
[1:20:57] leave
[1:20:58] hallelujah and I am standing here not
[1:21:02] sitting standing upon the promises of
[1:21:05] you I believe what really loved you
[1:21:11] you don't know how much God loves you
[1:21:13] because God chose you
[1:21:15] in this last day in Misrata yes you can
[1:21:19] carry something yes your ski yeah but
[1:21:23] still
[1:21:27] [Applause]
[1:21:34] here's why I have a job Oh mommy this
[1:21:37] period this morning because course love
[1:21:40] is a tarantella you have two children
[1:21:42] one miserable one thing you love this
[1:21:43] one I love this one it'll be strong you
[1:21:44] telling them yellow everybody see those
[1:21:46] who talk God love is a parent alone his
[1:21:53] love is elected love he loved it because
[1:21:57] he liked you I don't care what you have
[1:22:00] been to guada in a fight who know what
[1:22:03] nothing that now I do one and we're
[1:22:07] getting fighting Jesus how much how much
[1:22:09] money hard words that's five in one even
[1:22:11] know yours okay I've done I go on his
[1:22:15] love is elected his love look for the
[1:22:17] gene behind the flesh behind the spirit
[1:22:21] behind the short dress behind the drinks
[1:22:24] behind the smoke behind the adultery and
[1:22:26] fornication behind all the death you
[1:22:28] looking for the gene so the first piece
[1:22:30] has come because the cusp of it is a
[1:22:33] fisherman
[1:22:33] Peter no all the trailers but that
[1:22:38] didn't stop kill them then come
[1:22:40] he was then come to the seed that seen a
[1:22:43] pleasure that we got spirit erroneous
[1:22:46] but the seed common aren't you come
[1:22:49] Philip comes Matt you come
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:22:59] no watch where I'm at ul excellent
[1:23:03] I'm Philip II hate Peter that has
[1:23:05] nothing dude ISM because Matthew didn't
[1:23:08] call Philip if Jesus called every one of
[1:23:11] them so they have to get over it you
[1:23:15] have to get over the issues because go
[1:23:18] call all of them and how many members
[1:23:21] put one body or give the Lord a shout in
[1:23:25] the house hallelujah and we are not the
[1:23:29] one calling the members because by one
[1:23:31] spirit we are baptized into that body
[1:23:36] and that body is the universal body of
[1:23:38] Jesus right so there's piped Minister
[1:23:42] think that the brag or teachers belong
[1:23:44] to them and as their own and their wife
[1:23:45] and all kind of nonsense and I call it
[1:23:47] nonsense
[1:23:47] we ties what they think about the church
[1:23:50] my daughter teaches means he is head of
[1:23:54] the body called the church not I am here
[1:23:57] he is head another local body yet but
[1:24:00] this body that is Christ's body he's the
[1:24:03] head of that he is coming up with his
[1:24:06] body he is coming to connect his body
[1:24:08] and if you belong to the body's water
[1:24:11] get inside idea by his spirit
[1:24:14] [Applause]
[1:24:16] and we have a promise that the church
[1:24:20] will be rebuilt by the spirit that's our
[1:24:24] promise
[1:24:25] hallelujah after the Ministry of the
[1:24:27] word we have a time with a Ministry of
[1:24:29] the Spirit so faith is a revelation of
[1:24:33] the will of God isn't that right
[1:24:36] what is faith is sometimes reveal to you
[1:24:38] that is not yet you believe it will be
[1:24:40] see it is a revelation I'd open up God
[1:24:43] and the churches that they don't leave
[1:24:45] in spirit a revelation
[1:24:47] they believe in the dogmatic teaching of
[1:24:50] some system so the people are very proud
[1:24:53] to testify what they believe and to tell
[1:24:57] you what we do believe you same thing
[1:24:59] about a sermon what I preached in
[1:25:01] captivity no rapture as I never know
[1:25:03] what teaching is erupting I thought was
[1:25:06] faith and virtue and knowledge I thought
[1:25:07] was the life that God is taking up we
[1:25:09] could knock that he say you have to be
[1:25:11] magnetized to the headstone so any
[1:25:13] magnet past Magna picking up wood and
[1:25:14] stone and people the magnet taken what
[1:25:17] is magnetized to it so they have a
[1:25:19] magazine in you when the spirit capstone
[1:25:22] had stone come to pick you up with it
[1:25:24] but you have to be magnetized to the
[1:25:26] headstone didn't see your to join a
[1:25:28] church no you have to get massive times
[1:25:31] you look at the magnetism of the Holy
[1:25:33] Ghost and said to you and then God when
[1:25:35] God get pick you up the a difference in
[1:25:42] administration but the same spirit my
[1:25:45] gift is several other brothers serious
[1:25:49] spirit different gives different money
[1:25:52] administration and so on but it's one
[1:25:55] spirit even as there is one Lord and one
[1:25:59] body I want you to see the one body
[1:26:01] today go beyond this group go beyond the
[1:26:05] church see one body and see you have to
[1:26:08] get into that body
[1:26:09] that is your destination to be pleased
[1:26:12] into the body of Christ you cannot place
[1:26:14] yourself and I can place you know

[1:33:34] the same body tip this brother sticker
[1:33:36] that you stick to it is but I don't you

[1:33:57] shoes you have to be able to end into
[1:33:59] the person suffering that is how you
[1:34:01] could three for somebody that's why
[1:34:03] sometimes you go to soften yourself but
[1:34:05] when you hear about somebody suffering

[1:34:08] been there you've had that pain you have
[1:34:11] attached double your fact that condition

[1:37:45] I'm the spin heels in different things
[1:37:48] afterwards Jordan settle himself you
[1:37:50] know this is what is this what you see
[1:37:52] the condition didn't change we were and
[1:37:55] what he was pleased to do what the

[1:38:01] pushed into his destiny by that
[1:38:06] rejection by that conditioned by that
[1:38:09] Shia by whatever you're going through so
[1:38:12] stop looking at what you're going to
[1:38:14] have a negative
[1:38:16] understand what Romans 8:28 is about all
[1:38:20] we know
[1:38:23] how many they are all things work
[1:38:26] together for good to them that love God
[1:38:31] but then will I be called according to
[1:38:34] his purpose
[1:38:35] George appear Josephine is peppy and
[1:38:40] small compared to the Blues on task he
[1:38:44] has to save the world

[1:39:57] recognized disaster keep following you

[1:45:10] glory to God amen hallelujah oh my my my
[1:45:16] my my
[1:45:17] Oh glory to God watch for the Brandon
[1:45:21] Robert Paul Paul the pillar fire hit
[1:45:26] down Paul's sort of a soil and he was
[1:45:29] fighting the church fighting the
[1:45:30] revolution everything else and he didn't
[1:45:32] know he was seed all you know he tell us
[1:45:35] for the Pharisee doctrine ego has found
[1:45:37] his concern this church is a crazy
[1:45:39] church for this man called Jesus so
[1:45:41] there is poor soil rather right on his
[1:45:44] high horse pillar fire nothing more
[1:45:46] funny but what the Lord right away he
[1:45:48] know will de Paul only knew in by
[1:45:52] revelation Peter knew in by revelation
[1:45:55] he walked with him talked with him
[1:45:58] therefore you can set this wood now I've
[1:46:01] said that he was the word a scholar can
[1:46:03] set down listen carefully and read that
[1:46:06] word till I just tie a mine up in anyway
[1:46:08] if he wants to bad smart brilliant and
[1:46:11] so on
[1:46:12] he's a real train collision can do that
[1:46:14] but I practice perseverance he make you
[1:46:16] think you don't know nothing but the
[1:46:18] only way you are seized is to know him
[1:46:23] by revelation if I can take the
[1:46:27] presbytery induction and kalpeni console
[1:46:29] up till II don't know I can see the
[1:46:31] battle doctrine and show you finally got
[1:46:32] several million things you don't know
[1:46:33] nothing else that's right but that is
[1:46:35] not his church so being able to expose
[1:46:38] scriptures and teaching and Thai people
[1:46:40] about magnetic energy are you ready his
[1:46:46] church is himself revealed
[1:46:56] it's not a building it's not a room of
[1:46:58] people this church which is the price is
[1:47:01] really Christ's lowest price is God
[1:47:04] revealed the church is quite revealed so
[1:47:10] the church really reveals Jesus right
[1:47:13] Christ is the mystery of God revealed so
[1:47:17] so so that's why you hear me say often
[1:47:20] about right division like a dream and
[1:47:22] that the word as a big intern for
[1:47:24] supposed to bring clarity not more
[1:47:27] confusion and when you see the real
[1:47:31] vision the prophetic vision the real
[1:47:35] core of the message
[1:47:36] the rest is filler material and I
[1:47:39] compared to somebody giving you a gift
[1:47:40] in a bag nice booty bag and have those
[1:47:43] people are wrong it and this is a drink
[1:47:45] or something like that the bag is not a
[1:47:48] gift the people are wrong it is not
[1:47:50] against is the steadiest the paper I
[1:47:52] wrong it is filler material so even
[1:47:55] though here it looks nice the real thing
[1:47:57] is in the middle that's what it's about
[1:47:59] the Jews have their place at the
[1:48:02] principle choose and talk about Jews and
[1:48:04] all about Jews but that doesn't help me
[1:48:06] I just talked about those Angelis that
[1:48:08] doesn't help me I talked about the Pope
[1:48:10] that doesn't help me there are many
[1:48:12] things in the scriptures that is what
[1:48:15] God said but doesn't apply to you I have
[1:48:18] about the tribulation
[1:48:19] now what vials in other world wars and I
[1:48:22] world wars have all kind of stuff inside
[1:48:24] idea but what we want is the promises
[1:48:26] that become effective to up the face the
[1:48:30] challenge that is in our lives and to
[1:48:33] face the challenge that is yet before
[1:48:35] because a develop student still the
[1:48:38] devil is open up its treasures the
[1:48:40] Lucius on the earth when we're around
[1:48:42] here had the people I mean that hell has
[1:48:45] been delivered Bella uncovered and
[1:48:47] streams of demon bones pouring out but
[1:48:50] doing so much more with virtual reality
[1:48:51] knowledge television abiram says when is
[1:48:54] that the woman and not it's on the
[1:48:55] television so they're puttin avenues and
[1:48:58] channels with demon powers the computer
[1:49:00] witches and witch doctors and all your
[1:49:02] children story and all kind of stop the
[1:49:04] pushing inside of that the poison people
[1:49:06] man
[1:49:07] Oh hallelujah are you with me you're all
[1:49:11] the fools on all if I help break down
[1:49:13] the human body break down the human mind
[1:49:15] oh yes yes yes yes yes so but Ron says
[1:49:19] we are striving to enter the kingdom of
[1:49:22] God before these big strike I hope you
[1:49:25] get Britain you know oh they got Britain
[1:49:28] of the world you know because we have
[1:49:29] children's we have grandchildren we are
[1:49:31] family and so on and we see these eases
[1:49:33] and destruction and all kind of things
[1:49:35] come in for the bottom dollar what
[1:49:40] adopted sons pushing back this and
[1:49:42] pushing back that and stopping diseases
[1:49:44] and stopping cancer because it will be
[1:49:46] necessary to do it because he doesn't
[1:49:49] have a mission to kill all Oh hallelujah
[1:49:53] are you with me he want to destroy your
[1:49:55] life oh praise be to Jesus but the
[1:50:01] balance says here he said someone said
[1:50:04] to me when I come out of my great trials
[1:50:06] I felt lost my wife baby and everything
[1:50:08] said brother Brandon did you keep your
[1:50:10] religion during that time I said no sir
[1:50:12] it kept me during that time is what it
[1:50:16] is for
[1:50:16] I can't keep Christ he keeps me it is
[1:50:20] whether I hang on is whether he tells on
[1:50:22] it's a gift to me and then noticing that
[1:50:26] people have this hard time there's got
[1:50:29] to be something wrong somewhere if the
[1:50:31] Christian religion watch here we go only
[1:50:33] consists of a declaration of treed
[1:50:36] denomination or in the lectures then we
[1:50:39] don't need nothing but real good smart
[1:50:42] group of people that's what we need if
[1:50:46] that's the church the church is governed
[1:50:49] by intellectuals not until our killers
[1:50:52] all right you can receive the word
[1:50:53] intellectually but let it's so true to
[1:50:56] the heart and then they begin to get
[1:50:58] real results
[1:51:00] so the results is not just here in it
[1:51:02] the result is when you allow this word
[1:51:04] just so true
[1:51:07] now if God meant for us to run is just
[1:51:11] by denomination also by crease then the
[1:51:13] only thing we need is the intelligence
[1:51:16] of a man smarter the man better the
[1:51:19] church but that's not God's program are
[1:51:23] you ready to go down further God's
[1:51:25] program was for the Holy Ghost to run
[1:51:29] the church the Holy Ghost was given for
[1:51:33] the church no we can't have two
[1:51:35] faculties one the church at the same
[1:51:37] time if man runs that Cody goes goes out
[1:51:41] that's a big one
[1:51:43] that's a massive one if - riders forty
[1:51:47] goes gone if the Holy Ghost runs it
[1:51:50] usually the man goes out it's one or the
[1:51:53] other sometimes me to believe I meet
[1:51:59] some rather be somebody and I'm
[1:52:00] listening I'm hearing the testimony I'm
[1:52:04] listening with a keen ear of what is the
[1:52:06] emphasis and most time the emphasis the
[1:52:08] Education Department I'm looking to hear
[1:52:11] Christ I'm looking at the vision I'm
[1:52:14] looking at the headstone the jacket I'm
[1:52:16] looking at here beyond denomination
[1:52:18] beyond group I'm looking to here at know
[1:52:20] the first question what Joseph
[1:52:22] Fellowship and which is going to now
[1:52:25] they asking that because I have a a
[1:52:27] judgment line on that so what do where
[1:52:29] you see they react or you win there or I
[1:52:33] right right right
[1:52:33] they off the image do you see that
[1:52:37] that's the behavior as a reaction they
[1:52:39] don't want to know about you life
[1:52:41] Abraham says you don't discern the
[1:52:42] church you still in the spirit in the
[1:52:44] man you don't listen the man group you
[1:52:47] doing the spiritual individual you can't
[1:52:49] judge somebody inside ear by one person
[1:52:52] I'm looking for holy be here you have to
[1:52:55] judge somebody by their spirit in them
[1:52:58] sometimes we talk around since that hour
[1:53:00] behind the organ she's just very short
[1:53:02] she said but you say but she'll find
[1:53:04] spirit he bought them because I wasn't
[1:53:08] she just but have longer son terrible
[1:53:11] spirit but they will look and say what
[1:53:13] you see have just not long enough you
[1:53:15] want something so at the end of it all
[1:53:18] it has to be a discernment what is the
[1:53:21] person's motive and the person's
[1:53:23] objective all praise God we love them so
[1:53:27] it isn't what the church needs I'll tell
[1:53:30] you what the church needs it means the
[1:53:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost it needs to
[1:53:33] pagal Living God our revival doesn't go
[1:53:36] to more and make new members a revival
[1:53:38] means to revive what you already got no
[1:53:42] no a backslider back side from something
[1:53:45] something was in him and what would
[1:53:47] always activate that so we have the
[1:53:49] paperback silence not to pray for the
[1:53:52] deliverance and then picture because
[1:53:54] it's demon powers hold them captive
[1:53:55] well Ron says what the preacher does is
[1:53:57] Constable's other people and people
[1:53:59] receive the Lord to understand the
[1:54:01] people have Devils on them some
[1:54:03] religious devil intact in spirits but
[1:54:05] when they get broken off then they get
[1:54:06] free then they can worship they could
[1:54:08] honor God Oh hallelujah praise God
[1:54:12] praise God could you take some more
[1:54:15] under the Church of Smyrna write these
[1:54:17] things said the first in the last which
[1:54:19] was dead and arrived
[1:54:20] notice every time he introduced himself
[1:54:22] he put forth something of his DG of who
[1:54:26] years I am God I changed no time came
[1:54:28] Who I am
[1:54:29] I'm the first and the last this is what
[1:54:31] a brown no watch no Smyrna means
[1:54:35] bitterness it comes from the words merle
[1:54:37] and the first church has lost his first
[1:54:40] love ephesians church the church has
[1:54:42] began to get a root of bitterness
[1:54:43] coming up in them because the main
[1:54:46] church the big part here we go
[1:54:49] the majority of them was hammering
[1:54:52] against the whole
[1:54:54] he goes ruling in the church they wanted
[1:54:58] to rule themselves they wanted to set up
[1:55:02] a priesthood they wanted to act like the
[1:55:05] Old Testament people did they wanted
[1:55:08] priests Oh a man who a man of the hour
[1:55:13] we know we are it because we have this
[1:55:15] man and one brother claiming to have the
[1:55:18] whole 5-volt is unscriptural God put
[1:55:22] gifts different gifts different gifts
[1:55:25] different administration different men
[1:55:26] and so on one man can hard will size
[1:55:28] will know they have to say that in order
[1:55:31] to be it in order to they don't need
[1:55:35] anybody else but that's not what the
[1:55:37] Bible teaches because I'm a hand I have
[1:55:40] no need of the foot that can teach that
[1:55:42] and the I have no need of the nose
[1:55:44] because if you begin to realize that we
[1:55:47] are members of that body then we need
[1:55:49] each other and we cannot do like if we
[1:55:53] are the only pebble on the beach we
[1:55:55] cannot do like every are the only
[1:55:57] members of that body
[1:55:58] we need a nose we need amount we need a
[1:56:01] ears with inner eyes with all the body
[1:56:03] parts even those padded up not calmly we
[1:56:08] need every part of the body so that is
[1:56:10] why God hates the attitude I am right
[1:56:13] you are wrong ayah if you are not I have
[1:56:15] it you don't have it what is that and
[1:56:17] that's why I got here the Nicolaitans
[1:56:19] spirit that beats the people into pots
[1:56:21] and povery them just to be in subjection
[1:56:24] to some man for some bishop or some a
[1:56:27] special or some positive rule because
[1:56:30] God is the head of the church and you
[1:56:33] have to recognize yourself as the body
[1:56:34] and as you get in that body you become
[1:56:36] part of that whole movement and there's
[1:56:39] a path in that body for you and your
[1:56:42] heart nobody else could take your path
[1:56:44] nobody could replace no time nobody is a
[1:56:47] substitute for you you are in God part
[1:56:50] of God
[1:56:55] what happened out from the pagan
[1:56:57] churches there Jupiter priests Venus and
[1:56:59] silver and they wanted to bring in them
[1:57:02] same thing to make these men this church
[1:57:05] had begin to sing a root of bitterness
[1:57:07] why it was bitter against those who want
[1:57:13] to continue on with the whole Eagles the
[1:57:16] lover fainted away and they were trying
[1:57:19] to swap it with creeds and denominations
[1:57:22] getting them Holy Ghost leadership so
[1:57:25] you swap it for teachings mysteries more
[1:57:27] doctrine more knowledge more information
[1:57:29] so I know a whole lot up here and that
[1:57:32] makes me better than you who don't have
[1:57:34] much up here but yet God here we go
[1:57:40] bypass the Pharisees and scribes who
[1:57:43] were scriptural these people they get
[1:57:45] fishermen who can read and write Reuven
[1:57:50] when God rate the world he don't need
[1:57:52] read and write he need a right heart
[1:57:59] because God has gifts of knowledge gift
[1:58:04] of wisdom gift of discernment that he
[1:58:07] could give to somebody without reason
[1:58:09] right let me give the Lord a shout in
[1:58:14] the house do you understand that
[1:58:17] got to jumping upon you active of wisdom
[1:58:21] Baca drop upon your gift of knowledge
[1:58:23] what will give you Gifford assignment Oh
[1:58:26] hallelujah do believe that civic watch
[1:58:30] aha could we take a little more so watch
[1:58:33] the root of bitterness stop creeping in
[1:58:35] and they thought they were right right
[1:58:37] and that something dignified the great
[1:58:39] woman people would come in they are the
[1:58:41] Pope that great men Cardinals and so
[1:58:43] forth they just fine they got away from
[1:58:46] all the noise and everything they had
[1:58:50] very quiet I'm sure they were dying
[1:58:53] that's why I said we do have enough
[1:58:55] noise Oh hallelujah be ready but get
[1:58:58] away from the noise they get quiet
[1:59:01] because the China here and I depend on
[1:59:02] the writin nodes and I didn't notes and
[1:59:04] writing notes I said when they go home
[1:59:06] is muggy different right all you know as
[1:59:07] you want and they come the churches
[1:59:09] because I want to be mysterious
[1:59:10] because in the spirit is where you get
[1:59:13] them divine revelation if you're not in
[1:59:16] the spirit you need hear me
[1:59:17] intellectually but in the spirit or God
[1:59:19] speak to us wait a minute but sometimes
[1:59:21] I'll be doing something all of a sudden
[1:59:23] feel the warmth of the Holy Ghost come
[1:59:24] over me
[1:59:25] hallelujah he's anointed I don't know
[1:59:27] what is for yet but I feel the presence
[1:59:29] of God like just step into the room and
[1:59:31] I've seen the anointing of God and I
[1:59:32] know he wants as direc with you
[1:59:33] something and I what I see what made his
[1:59:35] upon my heart it's the Holy Ghost
[1:59:37] afterwards when it was come the Holy
[1:59:39] Ghost goals you know that the Spirit
[1:59:41] comes and goes and so on like that to
[1:59:43] tell you what to do what to see how to
[1:59:44] operate Harlan Lewis under mom can as
[1:59:47] well take a rest and write as a
[1:59:48] restaurant like a vision comes the
[1:59:50] inspiration comes and I see all what to
[1:59:52] put where what to put the coats and
[1:59:54] everything else and my mind to be
[1:59:55] totally blown so I come on a while here
[1:59:58] seems unfold and I'm stunned to see what
[2:00:02] he lot put together now I'm telling you
[2:00:04] something that I never televisual and I
[2:00:08] avoided indicate a Bigfoot for sure
[2:00:11] there's no I scared of people trying to
[2:00:18] make a goal some people came at the
[2:00:21] decoder already that disc is me Oh

[2:00:27] incidentally you can I make him Jesus
[2:00:29] Christ he was so much like Christ what

[2:00:38] so the garden on the noise they were
[2:00:39] dying they would pick me find the made
[2:00:42] of butter body what but but holding was
[2:00:45] just a classic oh so when they get away

[2:38:09] you're hearing you don't who sits next
[2:38:11] to you it could be a saint or sinner you
[2:38:13] don't know and I don't know all groups
[2:38:16] actually can I believers not some groups
[2:38:19] you'd rather say Amen I would say make
[2:38:22] I'm a true believer
[2:38:23] could somebody say Amen I don't know
[2:38:27] what runs over that is that unbelievable
[2:38:29] even true believer so if you are true
[2:38:31] believer you say Amen to the word but
[2:38:33] that tells you that what is you that
[2:38:36] attribute you connect to that what what
[2:38:38] you're hearing but a mess each one of
[2:38:40] their own theology each one after their
[2:38:42] own thinking but God there we go we'll
[2:38:45] take his Holy Spirit and we raise up his
[2:38:49] just one that will take the church to

[2:39:46] power of your spirit so what we have
[2:39:48] seen for all these years is the power of
[2:39:51] the word and revelation but it is a
[2:39:53] promise that the church could be rebuilt
[2:39:56] under the power of the Spirit and that
[2:39:58] is not going to bring the feet so it
[2:40:00] will be hard up and struggling and

[2:40:07] your need if you will seek God until
[2:40:10] your prayer is not right

[2:40:13] church again under the father spirit not
[2:40:16] my power not my mind not by
[2:40:18] organizations but by my Holy Spirit will
[2:40:22] God bring for the church in the last

[2:56:10] medically has no cure
[2:56:12] she was only me the way of all of these
[2:56:15] conditions after visited and ought to be
[2:56:17] the excision last year for back and
[2:56:19] spinal problems we shall be suffering
[2:56:22] with for many years
[2:56:23] whoever shall be an intense Constantine

[2:56:29] final issue as course of duty breeze l4
[2:56:33] l5 and s1 to be Belgian and who negated

[2:57:10] well but suffers terrible side effects

[3:14:36] you may be seated for a few
[3:14:38] announcements amen amen amen
[3:14:43] service continues this busy at 7:30 p.m.
[3:14:47] and we just want to remind the church
[3:14:50] that going forward every Thursday it's a
[3:14:54] day of fasting and prayer for the church
[3:14:56] that we conclude here with our Thursday
[3:15:00] night prayer meeting here at the church
[3:15:01] so we want you to really contribute
[3:15:05] yourself for that and even if you can't
[3:15:07] physically make it to church on Tuesday
[3:15:10] night that you do set aside that time in
[3:15:12] your home to be united in prayer with
[3:15:16] the rest of the tabernacle that services
[3:15:18] at 7:30 p.m. we also want request that
[3:15:21] maintenance group for with me go to the
[3:15:24] Malon alexander after the service today
[3:15:26] there will also be a short choir
[3:15:29] practice after the service and we'd also
[3:15:33] like to remind the church that we are
[3:15:35] just a few weeks away from the
[3:15:38] Convention and God has blessed us thus
[3:15:42] far and we continue to solicit your
[3:15:45] support to put things in motion for the
[3:15:48] convention so the sisters will be
[3:15:50] downstairs for those of you who have
[3:15:53] pledged and we want to encourage those
[3:15:55] who have not yet made a commitment we do
[3:15:58] solicit your support particularly at the
[3:16:02] end of this month of me and the end of
[3:16:04] June as well but even beyond that you're
[3:16:07] free to make your pledges and your
[3:16:09] contributions towards the convention
[3:16:12] we're under great expectation for what
[3:16:14] we'll what God will do for the bride of
[3:16:16] Jesus Christ both here and abroad and I
[3:16:19] can tell you that the services from the
[3:16:21] last two years of conventions have been
[3:16:23] a mighty blessing around the bride of
[3:16:26] Jesus Christ around the world and I'm
[3:16:28] under great expectation because as
[3:16:30] beloved said Simeon would come to church
[3:16:33] come to the temple not knowing what deed
[3:16:36] was going to be but he was under
[3:16:37] expectation that he could be that deed
[3:16:40] and I believe that for many years we are
[3:16:42] under great expectation for a meeting
[3:16:44] that would take place where the Holy
[3:16:46] Ghost would be so thick that the
[3:16:48] ministers would can administer the
[3:16:50] worshipers were can't even
[3:16:51] sing and shout for the Holy Ghost will
[3:16:53] just take over and I'm on the
[3:16:55] expectation that this meeting could be
[3:16:56] that kind of a meeting where we have
[3:16:58] backsliders can come in and it could be
[3:17:01] completely restored there are sick among
[3:17:04] us I believe that God is about to do a
[3:17:06] work of healing among the body of Christ
[3:17:08] we have never seen before in fact what
[3:17:11] the Branham set up where Christ is the
[3:17:13] sickest body on the face of the earth
[3:17:14] but that will not be how we will leave
[3:17:16] this place that's maybe how it is right
[3:17:19] now but that's not our promise we are
[3:17:21] not to leave sick and defeated entire
[3:17:23] and I believe that every prayer request
[3:17:25] that was prayed for today will come back
[3:17:28] as a note of praise and more than that I
[3:17:30] believe that every young person who is
[3:17:33] not in the house of God because of
[3:17:35] whatever situation they will be in the
[3:17:37] house of God that's also our promise I
[3:17:39] believe those are weary and tired God
[3:17:42] will give them a charge and an anointing
[3:17:44] and a call and they have to respond to
[3:17:47] because my sheep knows my voice and a
[3:17:50] stranger they will not follow and I love
[3:17:52] about over today being back slidden is
[3:17:54] temporary there's no permanent
[3:17:56] backslider because once you're done
[3:17:59] you're always a son so don't worry about
[3:18:02] your situation
[3:18:03] don't worry about your children don't
[3:18:05] worry about anything because God is in
[3:18:07] control I am under great expectation for
[3:18:11] what God will do in the upcoming
[3:18:12] convention even now every service we
[3:18:16] know this is mandatory isn't that right
[3:18:18] every time it is mandatory what I want
[3:18:21] to encourage you next week Sunday is the
[3:18:23] 28th day of me and we will have a
[3:18:26] special service to set the church in
[3:18:28] order for the convention and basically
[3:18:31] the 28th day time of live service and
[3:18:34] from the 29th of May we are calling for
[3:18:37] a 40 day consecration for the church now
[3:18:40] they'll take us directly into the
[3:18:41] convention on the 7th of July so we are
[3:18:45] announcing to the church next week
[3:18:46] sunday is a very special service on the
[3:18:49] 28th day of me and on the 29th we are
[3:18:52] calling for a 40 day period of
[3:18:54] consecration for the church which will
[3:18:56] take us to the convention
[3:18:58] and the convention is some spiritual
[3:19:00] numbers between six and nine the
[3:19:03] converse would be July 7 8 and 9 so we
[3:19:06] under great expectations who what God
[3:19:08] will do so don't miss next Sunday
[3:19:10] service tell somebody who is not here
[3:19:13] that we are getting ready to leave this
[3:19:15] place we don't have too much time let me
[3:19:17] get a redditor to get out of this place
[3:19:19] we are getting ready to give the devil
[3:19:21] the final knockout punch we're getting
[3:19:23] ready to see the backlight has come in
[3:19:25] and but the Branham said will be a short
[3:19:27] quick message I will shake the whole
[3:19:29] nation all of the years we have been
[3:19:31] laboring in the vineyard is for short
[3:19:34] quick message for your family to come in
[3:19:37] for short quick message we're going to
[3:19:40] pour out the Holy Ghost there are some
[3:19:42] 11-hour Gentile workers who haven't even
[3:19:44] come to church yet but they will come in
[3:19:46] a short space of grease they will come
[3:19:49] through that door that opened or the
[3:19:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost straight into
[3:19:53] the bride body so all these years of
[3:19:56] coming was just to prepare us to leave
[3:19:58] this place to prepare us but what era
[3:20:00] have where she could have seen and what
[3:20:02] David wish she could have seen even with
[3:20:04] a Branham Michigan of goodness and so
[3:20:06] close I could almost see it but Church
[3:20:09] it's later than we think but it's a
[3:20:11] happy time for the bride of Jesus Christ
[3:20:13] because we are getting younger we are
[3:20:15] getting stronger we are getting more
[3:20:17] powerful we are dealing the vibrations
[3:20:20] of a theophany say this time is up the
[3:20:23] whole creation groaning for the
[3:20:25] manifestation of the sons of God to come
[3:20:28] under great expectation our blessed week
[3:20:32] amid a lord richly bless you
[3:20:36] hallelujah Oh glory be to God
[3:20:39] breathe Gordy man it was just get ready
[3:20:42] common or she odd
[3:20:44] Oh bless you amen amen she won rather me
[3:20:49] be the malady you surround me with a
[3:20:57] song of deliverance from my enemy to all
[3:21:09] my fears
