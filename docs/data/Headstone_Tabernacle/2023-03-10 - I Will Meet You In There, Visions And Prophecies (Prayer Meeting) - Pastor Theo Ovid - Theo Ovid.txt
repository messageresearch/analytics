worship the singing and your commitment to these meetings let me appreciate that we appreciate the service on Wednesday night who can look prophesied we are grateful to God to be here tonight so this ball has a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this tremendous opportunity you have given unto us to connect a bit to heaven and to hear from you what to receive from you and to be blessed from evil when root was liberating God you're allowed from body to be there for her to glean Lord and I pay a drop somebody tonight we could lean green and seek your face clean and walk in the light of your promises because that's what we live by you said man shouted by bread alone but by every word that proceed us a word of God you send a prophet Messenger to release promises that we can live by these promises that we can live by your torments expressed in a word it's unboxing on teeth and Lord you promise a conjuration 10 8 11 that the prophecies will come again spoken to the bride father we thank you for the ministry that you have placed Among Us the Ministries and father for the Ministries our own world that has been echoing these precious promises and we pray that it live from this is to make these men make more sense to it and I hope they bring these things to life the receipts begin to come to life tonight in this time of prayer that we will ask in Jesus amen and amen God bless you and welcome and before I read the scripture there will be tonight I just want to read something here from this is revelation book of symbols Angelic beans associate together I hope you get that that just dropped right now free look if you got the Holy Spirit In You then you are candidate for the association but the Unseen World and the supernatural no wonder people can't believe in those things they have never come in contact they got nothing in here to believe it but when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes then a two full beings but you right one of the earth to die and his body he still has his Earthly contact with five senses and a spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visit them speaks with them and they are messengers sent to God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual he's out to get the first thing first and I'll just leave it right there amen praise the Lord so what we are seeing tonight is the holy Lord make you a candidate for the supernatural the Unseen World and the decision of angels it is not just a natural life it's not just going to work going home hearing what people are saying in politics the news and all what's going on it's a little more than that it is to give you a antenna uh Crystal or whatever that gets you a tune but things that is not seen uh things that is out of this world and that is what the word is the word actually is God and when we gather like this to hear get a little word to encourage us into prayer we want to really tap into what God will have for us amen so tonight if you have your Bibles I like it to go to a portion of scripture tonight see from Matthew chapter 6 one read from verse one to six Matthew chapter 6. verse one to six and um it's quite strange how he got this but this is what we have tonight to show which Matthew 6 1-6 and it says here take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father therefore when those thine arms do not summer trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men that will I say unto you but when now do his arms I can give him right let not thy left hand Know Thy right hand do thine arms may be in secret and thy father which isn't secret himself shall rewarded open so God is addressing the fact that as human beings we do things that impress each other we do things that others might see we we do things from our ambition or if we are who we think we are and everything else and you're saying you know what I want you to think that of your father who sees in secret so I don't want you to do like what others do it right now he sends his arms thing and then he dropped down and verse 5 and says bendo prayers that is where we are tonight window pressed though shall not be as a hypocrite are for the love to preach standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets that they may be a scene of men they already listen to you you have dull and don't press enter into that closet and when now I shut the door free to like Father which is a secret and thy father which is a secret shall your body open me I want you to hold this last scripture tonight window prayers enter into that closet that's where you are tonight a window I shut the door free to like father with season which is in secret they follow it features a secret shall we body openly so now I want you to see that closet as a place okay not as a not a great if you have a physical place an actual location but a place in the spirit a place where you could talk to God and when you could read upon the place so tonight I have this thought I will meet you dear I will meet you India visions and prophecies and I was really blessed on Wednesday night um and you know vision and prophecy Vision sometimes is not prophecy because of vision God could go back in your life and give a vision as to what happened back deal why you are in the condition you're in maybe what happened way back that's Vision there's visions and there's vision of the future of visions of the succumb that is the vision with prophecy I want to go back into something we shared a couple of years about and this was a vision that the brother Brandon had the Lord was training him and teaching them and he found himself with a baby shoe and with some bitty eyelets and he had a eight of an inch hole in his eye luck and about a half inch string and he was just trying to push it in a hole in other words the hole was smaller than the string that he's pushing in and I was breaking the threads all over the string trying to push it through that like that and he wouldn't do it and the string was being broke up at the end so just then I heard someone say behind me this one you trust don't you understand you can't teach babies Supernatural things so in reality the promise of power Supernatural that is not for babies that means you have to grow you have to mature you have to anything you have to be tested you have to face the music because the Lord told him you cannot teach babies Supernatural things and I looked around it was behind me and I recognized that voice he said you're using the wrong end of the Stream and I look down at the end of the string line on the floor great power string it was at least down to the ninth eighth of an inch so it was to go through the hole I understand I reach up the string I was taken again so now he's being taken into different dimensions different levels right and then he was taken to another level when I come to handling by the side of a beautiful Lake it was pretty and green and there was some fishermen all around the lake and they were fishing and they were catching small fishes and I looked out to the leak it was beautiful rainbow there I said I know this is a vision but I can't understand those trucks but I said you know I believe don't in my heart I can touch those right pick up the string and instead of it being a string it was a fishing poor just then the one behind me said I will teach you to fish how to consider so you realize but Abraham had the trainer with him he had the angel he had the Holy Spirit he had the Lord working with him I will teach you to fish how to catch those so he said tie on the low and I shall snapped the low on he said I'll throw it way out into the deep when you know when the Lord think down first pull it slow oh that's a really Fisherman's technique he said then when you do now you'll feel something manipulated but don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it to yourself This was instructions from the angel don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it to yourself I said now when you feel it nibble again just pull it not too hard and then pull it away from the little fish and when this cutter that will attract the attention of the big fish and they will grab it that's the way I'll cut it and then they will back on the third time set your hook for the catch I said I understand he said but keep still don't tell nobody keep still and sometimes the other chapter sometimes you have to zip up sometimes you cannot see everything you have to know what you're seeing okay and who you're saying it too so I had the low in my hand and all these fishermen turned out to be ministers so no the vision is unfolding and they come around saying go to Branham I know you can't you can catch fish oh of course that made me feel real good I said yes I'm a fisherman I could kind of fish he said no here's the way you do it I said you threw it out and we we out into the deep water and said no those little fish are fine Brethren but we want big ones too I said they see when it sinks down and there it is and about where it should be them little fish I said now when it sits again I give it a great big joke but when I did I pulled a whole little out of the water and when I did I caught a fish and I wondered how he ever got to learn his mouth cause it looked like the skin was stretched over the lure about the same size of the like her own money and just them this one who they're talking behind me step around in front of me it was him the angel of the room he had his hand folded he looked at me and said plus what I told you not to do I said yes God is right he said you see that first pill was when you used to put your hands on the people tell them what was their trouble he said the second poll was when you know the secrets of the heart like I told you and said instead of you keeping that to yourself you try to explain all about tell the people when you did you didn't know nothing about it yourself how could you explain it isn't that something else the prophet is saying he didn't know about it himself or you could explain so in reality you cannot explain what you don't know you say and you cause you cause a bunch of carnal impersonations to rise up you see what you have done Lord I'm sorry oh I'm so sorry I don't know what to do and as I was pulling the line like this I was trying to straight my line out he looked at me and he said now don't get your line tangled up in these kind of times and I will exalt you tonight right don't get your line tangled up in these kind of times and I thought maybe he's going to give me another try and I said I should be careful which one in my line in and seeing it taking up all right and then when he said that I felt myself go higher way up so another level again and when I was sat down the I always be neat and standing up above a great tent never seen such a time I just made an older calls team like done at the altar when I was down there I looked and there were hundreds of people standing around the altar weeping because they had accepted the Lord Jesus and they were just weeping out loud and I said oh that's more like it again a real-time gentleman walk onto the platform while brother Branham is resting for a few moments we will call the prayer he said everyone with a prayer card beginning with a certain number stand over to the right and notice the prayer line seemed like it went all around the tent out down to the street such a prize I looked over which was to my left and there it was to my right I was standing on the platform and there was a piece of canvas Church there and behind this canvas was a square building for 12 foot across 20 foot long something like that I stood and looked at it and I seen them bring a lady up on a structure and there was a lady dear taking her name on people through there was someone come and got her and push her through and the next man come was with crutches I see them stuck little building and on the outside the lady come out screaming to the top of her voice pushing the stretcher and then there was another lady on the other side looked like a darker woman said what happened she said I don't know she's I couldn't tell you what happened she said I'll be in paralyzed for 20 years and look I feel I never would think and plus them overcome the man leaping and jumping with the scratches in his hand and I looked at that and just then there's something noticeable there's a difference between the angel of the Lord and that light because I heard something moving that does when it comes at the platform and like whoa whoa it left me which is a pillar file it went right down over the top of that audience went and stood over the top of that little building and then step along on the top of it and then when it did this one was standing by me behind me the same voice the Angel's voice said I will meet you India and this is the third problem but nobody will know nothing about it I said I don't understand why India why dear he said it will not be a public show this time I said I don't understand going into that closet like that and he said is not it written by our Lord when though yes we not plant the Hypocrites who would like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet to pray to the father who sees in secret and he who sees his secret shall reward you openly it is perfectly to the scripture every time it is I said I understand then he took me to the place and sat me down in this room where I was and he told me what to do put it to the time all right you almost finished okay if you want something to happen now you have to take my word for this if I'm planning on doing something I know better than to tell anybody about it not that that person will tell it what Satan will hear it see he can't get it in my heart there as long as God College proves up at the Holy Spirit so between me and God he don't know nothing about it until you speak it then he hears it now I'll do a certain thing and watch the devil cut off every really continuing or beat me to it but if I can get to Revelation from God just don't say nothing about it then it's different remember Satan will try to imprison it he will try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's trying to do it we have noticed it through the Antichrist this is one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this because you don't know it there is no way for him to know it it's the third pill he just knows nothing about it he doesn't understand all right so then let's hear it back again I reflected yellow I seem to like leave me and go to that building and go in the building and a voice said to me I will meet you in India that will be the triple I said why he said well it won't be a publisher like the others and I want to share five things where the brand I'm identified as the turtle and all those things have a scripture connected to it the television when no prayers enter that closet and thou have shut the door pray to thy father waiting in secret and the father within secret travel will be open two spoken word we know the scriptures in Mark 11 23 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall see into this mountain be don't remove or cast into the sea and shall not doubt in your heart which I believe that those things which his fear shall come to pass shall have whatever you see I spoke King's sword so in John 57 if you're bothering me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and strap it unto you Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any towards sword piercing it to devising that stand up was full and spirit of the joints and Marrow as a result of their portion in terms of the heart form the opening of the word the scriptures Luke 24 27 and beginning of Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things consider themselves Luke 24 45 then he open he the understanding that they might understand the scripture and the final one is souls in prison and that scripture is First Peter 3 18 for Christ also has once suffered for sins than just for the undressed that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickly by the Spirit by which also we he went and preached under the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient when Once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of new are the ark Was preparing wherein few that is eight Souls brother Brown I did something he said I know that King James said greater but you couldn't do nothing greater more of more of it he was one person he's in the whole church now more than this shall you do because I go to my father if this is the third probe is a great ministry line ahead he says the first flight the second was white doves always been released because of the heart but the third fight was Angels not Birds that's the end time the only indictment he said media Comfort a Revival of the just this is prophecy Harry Potter of the just and Greek power come among the church just before it is going it's not too hard to pray that because you promised it and we are looking Lord for that people that we know will do great things in our minds then he says I am your I'm Yours Lord I lay myself on this altar I hope this is your prayer tonight just as consecrated as I know how to make myself take the world from alone take the things from me that's perishable give me the Imperial imperishable things the will of God may I be able to live that worship till the word will be in me and I in the world wanted the Lord may I never think from it may I hold that King so so tightly and perpet so proofly granted law I'm closing final one remember this the title that begins the Lord I I will meet you in the iso the Lord there's no man that is the Lord will meet you not the Church of the group not a bunch of people uh not the message world you the individual here here is where a place so I want to encourage you tonight to say this is Prisoner this is you you always because dog has chosen you have to make the decision a decision to go his way to do his will pray to your father in secret and he shall reward you openly religious people like to go to church like the atmosphere they like the Brethren singing Specialists but they're religious they don't want to subject yourself to the word they don't want to come and obedience they don't want no responsibility placed on them what they really want is a priesthood what they really want is like the Catholic Church you know the priests do all this stuff and they just come toward something and go home but this is not this message this is not the Bride of Jesus Christ the bride have a responsibility to Christ and to do good into prayer becomes a responsibility now if that little room or that closet is connected to the third pool and we need a tooth pull to get out of this place that means we have to have a genuine commitment to this this secret place this place of waiting this place of prayer this has nothing to do with the pastor this has nothing to do with the elder or the people or again a fight for this one fighting you this hola fighter thing and that's your human agreement that is what have to destroy this after you come into spiritual maturity to recognize this is you and God if you give arms and do your praying everybody know what you're praying I'm saying and everybody singing you have any word but that's not what you're talking about he say when you pray like you are right now in your own home maybe God arranged this maybe God set this thing all up set this up if we had a permission tonight maybe we might have 10 people I don't know but you are here tonight and you're not here by chance God is dependent upon your words even though the prophecy says to you you call prophecy says Moses like oh I'm RAM and Yoshi but he said that last that's a thing they knew that that's why it was a special child they still had to pray for deliverance they still never pray for deliverance even though the disciples Jesus breed upon them receiving the Holy Ghost they still harvest the go through the process of building up a room and praising God continually until the fire fell until the power comes you can sit back in your rocking chair in your hammock and expect things to work out because you know what God Said I know what God said to him and he will try to thwart this revival that is promising right and you have to be able to cry out for everybody in your own life and when you cry out God could do something special for you tonight I say tonight and you can come with that special thing to service on Sunday and God could even do that triple that and and give you a double portion upon that let us borrow his or whatever heavenly father thank you Lord I couldn't wait to share this with your people about this vision of the Prophet had and Lord you said I will meet you in here and many times they would hear me say about the pillar fire hanging on the building that is not far-fetched that is not far-fetched they're here tonight the pillar of fire actually came over the room and settled over it it could come down in it and Lord they are the rebuilding that you want to come and dwell and it's a clover when they come to the church they feel the anointing they feel the atmosphere sometimes they feel it in their home they feel it online but Lord you want that fire that presence that's anointed to be within them this is what the whole objective called above us caught with us in Jesus Christ now God in us by the Holy Spirit oh God come tonight in a special way come tonight and visitation come tonight come tonight and see them come tonight and be different come tonight in restoration come tonight and forgive this come tonight and refill it come tonight in Dynamics and pour it upon your people tonight May no one be the same after tonight Lord May there be a special Supernatural touch to the elect guarded in this little virtual room tonight May Fire Fall may they get the unction to pray may they not have to worry what which to see and I do not want to ask God but may you put seeds in their hearts words upon their lips that they can generally craft unto you and the prophet Lord when you hear them Weeping at the altar trying out allowed oh God when Anthony was striking a cry out to cry out Lord some point in time the people have to cry out that's how you set it up to cry out for what we have need of to cry out what we are testing for to see what we need of oh God made begin tonight let us spark off something in the people's heart I don't know how I don't know how you you bring this to me to share with them I will meet you in there they each one is an individual each one have to understand they have the supernatural appointment they have an appointment with the supernatural the car send their father to keep it they can't send the money to keep it they can't send their families they keep it husband wife nobody could keep that personal appointment that you have with every individual each one has to face the right each one have to face the Angel God as we go down went down to the home stretch we are encountering and we will encounter Supernatural elements so-called Divine encounter Angelic Angelic beings Lord oh God coming down to those who are ears of Salvation to minister to them Father may you give them a special ministry tonight in your spirit by your spirit through your spirit as they get on in prayer amen and amen God bless you thank you so much for being here tonight I trust them

night upon the leadership of the church upon the Ministries the trustees who God upon helps but upon the entire body of Believers oh God visit the widows Among Us in a special we visit them with your

everything I will handle the flu the spirit break it tonight and may we have a special Village on this coming Sunday a position of the Holy Spirit a position of God as you will come down with people you said if the power is in the prayer but would be the grace of God but we are praying tonight we are praying for baptized before we are praying for the sick to be healed we are praying there be a Revival in the church to get the trash out we are praying for oh God and blister who brought to come into action we are praying just as a promise Lord what it mean it was great being here I'm great in God's presence you know I was listening and reading of um listening audio of of the most Revival you know the professor and his family was sick and the Lord revealed to him that his God's will for that man to be healed so he went and tell him you know um his course we should be healed so the man was glad to hear that he said he will talk to him about it and when he prayed the Lord told him that he'll be here at five o'clock on certain day and so like that and he began to testify what the Lord told him it was scary at first for the man who had prayed for him was like the intercessor playing on his behalf because he never had that before where to have a date that time but come five o'clock that very same day when he woke up 5 a.m in the morning he got off he couldn't walk or something like that he got straight off his bed and started he had to walk to the church and he got and he said why am I getting off the bed the devil tell him this just let us take just in case just in case
