[13:05] you tonight
[13:06] and something that I discovered and I
[13:09] want to share with you
[13:10] much time in prayer for the randomly
[13:14] spoke about Jesus
[13:15] having much time in prayer and he focus
[13:20] on it in a message call
[13:21] Jairus healing of Jairus daughter
[13:25] so we want to play on this except
[13:27] tonight and uh pray God that will be a
[13:31] very blessing to you as you listen and
[13:34] absorb and it gives the focus in this
[13:37] age of so much distraction
[13:39] how much we should find out space to get
[13:42] much time in prayer so we want to go
[13:45] straight into the night
[13:46] by the grace of God so God bless you and
[13:49] then after this we go straight into
[13:51] prayer praise the Lord
[14:03] now shall we
[14:05] just a moment for a word of prayer
[14:08] how they will raise your hands and say
[14:10] brother remember me in prayer as you're
[14:12] praying would you put up your hands O
[14:14] Lord Jesus can see you God bless you
[14:16] every word that's fine he sees every
[14:19] hand
[14:20] our heavenly father as we come upon the
[14:24] grounds of the shed blood of Jesus
[14:28] oh God give us the vision tonight of
[14:32] seeing what that was
[14:34] Wayne Manuel's veins were plucked and
[14:38] drawn out the blood cell of the dying
[14:41] Lamb of God
[14:42] do there to sin
[14:45] breaking the blood cell freeing the life
[14:48] inside okay but now the worshiper coming
[14:51] to God comes through the shed glove all
[14:55] the innocent Lamb of God entering in
[14:58] to Zoe the life of God himself becoming
[15:03] then a son and daughter of God upon the
[15:05] basis of the shed blood then we go
[15:07] forward
[15:09] to carry on
[15:11] the work
[15:13] of reconciliation that Christ
[15:16] died for a Calvary teaching Sinners that
[15:19] they can be reconciled to God to the
[15:22] shedding of his blood and if any Stripes
[15:25] was included in this marvelous atonement
[15:28] that the Holy Ghost himself is here out
[15:31] of the blood cell to witness it to be
[15:34] truth that by his stripes we are healed
[15:38] oh how we thank thee father now thou to
[15:43] see the hands of these people you know
[15:45] everything they have need of in the very
[15:48] desire of their heart I pray father God
[15:50] that you'll yield to every one year
[15:54] especially this blessing tonight
[15:57] everlasting life
[15:59] heal all the sick and afflicted call
[16:01] back-to-back sliders get Glory into
[16:04] their own self as we present ourselves
[16:07] as empty vessels that the Holy Spirit
[16:10] would fill now for the service of God
[16:13] this we present to you
[16:16] in the name of the Lord Jesus the son of
[16:18] God Amen
[16:24] just for a few moments to approach God
[16:27] of all the bases of his word if the
[16:30] engineer would maybe be a good idea this
[16:33] step this up just a little bit if you
[16:35] want because the more people it makes
[16:37] the volume cuts down
[16:40] in the book of Saint Luke
[16:43] the eighth chapter and beginning about
[16:45] the 50th verse that's fine engineer
[16:49] who's doing it hear me all right way
[16:50] back in the back now that's good up for
[16:53] balconies that's fine all right now
[16:56] listen close for a few moments but when
[16:59] Jesus heard it
[17:00] he answered and said
[17:04] fear not only believe
[17:07] she shall be made whole
[17:09] and may the Lord add His blessings to
[17:11] this word reading of the word
[17:15] we're speaking tonight
[17:18] of America taking place in the Bible
[17:34] will be able to walk
[17:36] again without his braces
[17:38] your lace cops use a couple of
[17:40] wheelchairs setting here tonight two or
[17:43] three on them we pray that God will
[17:45] empty these up tonight
[17:47] only believe my dear beloved friends now
[17:51] remember I could not hear you I have
[17:54] nothing to heal with but
[17:56] God perhaps is the only one can heal you
[17:59] I don't know what your troubles is but
[18:01] surely if God will come down in the word
[18:04] and then come down to the spirit and
[18:06] prove to you that each year in the very
[18:09] principle that we're preaching that the
[18:12] holy spirit is here and will come and
[18:15] show you the same and prove to you by
[18:17] the Bible it's a diet that you can be
[18:19] made whole accepted just believe it with
[18:22] all your life
[18:23] don't make a difference how you feel
[18:25] just one down in your heart you know
[18:27] that you're going to get well don't be
[18:29] afraid move right now that's God
[18:32] speaking to you that's where that line
[18:34] come out of the animals are not the
[18:36] animal but out of the Son of God coming
[18:38] back witness into are that he has
[18:41] accepted your faith in glory and you've
[18:44] got to get well
[18:45] now we're speaking of a miracle of
[18:49] taking place in the New Testament the
[18:52] healing of giraffe's daughter
[18:54] A Little Priest at the temple
[18:58] wonderful lesson if we just had the time
[19:00] to speak on it a while
[19:02] just previous to this chapter we find
[19:06] one place there where the Son of God
[19:08] spent so much time in prayer
[19:11] and if Jesus had to spend much time and
[19:14] prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[19:18] spirit that presenting how much more do
[19:22] you and I have to spend in prayer much
[19:25] time and prayer
[19:28] if you only knew
[19:30] what time and prayer then but sometimes
[19:34] when you're in prayer God changes the
[19:38] the complete destination of different
[19:40] things that's going to happen
[19:43] do you believe that
[19:46] something fixing to happen
[19:48] and your prayer to change the whole
[19:50] situation
[19:51] what do you say if God knows it's going
[19:53] to happen what will my prayer do you
[19:55] remember when he stood there looking out
[19:57] upon the Harvest he said he was the
[19:59] owner of the Harvest he said the hardest
[20:02] is right and labors are of the few
[20:05] praise ye the lord of the Harvest of
[20:07] heal sand labors into his heart
[20:09] in other words pray to me that I will
[20:13] send laborers into my Harvest which I'm
[20:14] just telling you it's such a needy thing
[20:16] but part of the ways in human beings do
[20:19] you believe that the kingdom of God lays
[20:23] within the human beings
[20:27] now
[20:29] Jesus said to our place I am divine
[20:33] ye are the greatest
[20:36] Divine Cave Bear fruit the branches in
[20:40] the vine bears fruit
[20:42] God cannot bear fruit on himself
[20:45] it's got to take the church
[20:49] is that right
[20:50] he's got to take you branches to bear
[20:53] fruit
[20:54] and when you branches are yielded to the
[20:57] Vine
[20:58] then proof comes forth
[21:01] see what I mean God wants your hands
[21:05] you want your talent want your lips
[21:08] watch your ears watch your hands and
[21:11] feet so he can bring forth fruit through
[21:15] you
[21:16] now
[21:18] despite much time in prayer one day
[21:21] there he told his disciples he said uh
[21:25] come to the other side
[21:26] he sent him away while he went up in the
[21:29] mountains of rain
[21:31] while he was up there alone really
[21:34] a storm coming up
[21:36] I believe I don't know
[21:38] but I believe if I've been the disciples
[21:41] I said I know he told us to go over but
[21:43] I believe I'll just wait till he comes
[21:45] and goes along
[21:47] I like for him to be alone in these
[21:49] cases don't you so we see him now going
[21:53] up into the mountain
[21:54] the disciples thrust down to the scene
[21:57] picked up their horse and their little
[21:59] ship sail went up and away they started
[22:01] oring across to the other side
[22:04] where Jesus was to need him
[22:07] on the other side
[22:11] in the absence of the Holy Spirit on
[22:14] Christ then invisible Farm on the road
[22:17] over trouble setting
[22:20] and usually if you start anywhere
[22:22] without
[22:23] the troubles on its own
[22:25] just as soon as the devil sees you out
[22:28] of fellowship with Christ right then
[22:30] he'll set out as hard as he can
[22:32] just as soon as he sees you away from
[22:34] prayer away from consecration
[22:38] as he possibly can
[22:41] you know what one night when Billy Paul
[22:44] you're my boy
[22:46] he's a little bitty thought we'd leave a
[22:48] little two-room cabinet my wife had put
[22:51] this uh floor wax all the linoleum on
[22:54] the floor is real slick on the floor we
[22:57] had an old bucket out of the other room
[22:59] the kitchen had two rooms and we were
[23:02] sleeping in the front room and the next
[23:05] room was the kitchen and the bucket of
[23:07] water set out there they're different
[23:09] and so he woke up and he said Daddy and
[23:12] I said what little bitty fella he said I
[23:15] want a drink
[23:16] and I said oh I'm so tired in my head
[23:19] walked up patrolling
[23:21] I said honey could you go get a drink
[23:24] there it's just your chest inside the
[23:26] door
[23:28] he said Daddy come go with me
[23:30] and I said oh there's no there's never
[23:33] hurt you honey just go inside the door
[23:36] he said Daddy I'm afraid You're Gonna
[23:38] Let You Go With Me
[23:42] that's right God I'm afraid to go to
[23:45] unless you go with me father I know it's
[23:47] all right you are again ministers to go
[23:50] preach the gospel but if you don't go
[23:52] with me I'm parade
[23:55] little
[23:57] [Music]
[24:03] rugs laying in there and a little fella
[24:06] slipped it with a picture on Farmers on
[24:07] his face if I didn't have a hold of his
[24:10] hands and I haven't even when I get to
[24:12] keep it from smashing right down on his
[24:15] face and I thought truly God that's
[24:17] right
[24:17] you throw my hand in these slippery dark
[24:20] places and things while I'm searching
[24:22] for the water alive you just hold on my
[24:24] hand as I move along
[24:27] [Music]
[24:37] just across the other side him being the
[24:41] king of all Prophets
[24:43] the Son of God virgin born knowing what
[24:47] to follow and having to do he knew felt
[24:50] the pressure that battle coming so he
[24:52] got up in the mountain alone to pray
[24:54] that's the way and as he was a supreme
[24:57] he looked down upon the sea as the sun
[25:01] was going down the winds the contrary
[25:04] and the little old boat twisting and
[25:06] flipping around just about to go
[25:10] they were scared little ship coming up
[25:12] they were ordering with all they had
[25:15] enough and they happened to look long
[25:19] and you're coming
[25:21] walking on the waters going on a past
[25:23] them
[25:25] he can get over all right
[25:28] so you're a cop walking a passing and
[25:31] they got scared
[25:32] and thought they seen something
[25:34] a Spirit uh what we would say today
[25:38] something spooky here comes the man
[25:41] walking on the water walking by him and
[25:44] they were scared and were troubled
[25:47] here's the point
[25:49] the only thing that could help them they
[25:53] were scared of it
[25:54] and that's about the way it is today
[25:59] and holy spirit God sent Revival
[26:04] people were born together the spirit of
[26:05] God
[26:07] and people are being healed and signs

[26:19] the devil I'm free to that the only
[26:22] thing that can help India they become
[26:25] scared
[26:27] so Jesus said don't be afraid it's ah
[26:31] it's me just open up your heart tonight

[27:10] the people didn't want no Revival
[27:13] see if you don't walk right he won't
[27:16] push himself on you
[27:18] you certainly won is that you have to
[27:20] warn him first blessed are they that
[27:23] hunger and his first acting
