greet you all in the precious name of the lord jesus i'm brother jack duff from sunny south florida i want to send special greetings to the bride of christ all around the world that's attending this convention and special greetings also to brother solomon machina who's hosting the meetings i was absolutely blessed to hear from brother ovie regarding this virtual convention it's just a few years ago that brother ovid and brother thompson brother maduka and um many others that passed through to uh visit us here in south florida it's so good to see them it was a wonderful opportunity to fellowship once more with our precious brothers i also want to bring you greetings on behalf of brother wesko as well it's unfortunate that our world has changed and we're hindered from being able to meet together covet has come into our world attended many of the personal gatherings on earth but i am convinced that covett will not hinder our gathering for that meeting in the air it won't be long friends we'll all be going home i want to just share a few thoughts with you in regards to the theme of behold the bridegroom cometh lamp trimming time as i heard about this meeting just got a chance to read some of the quotes uh my heart was moved you know on it and i thought it was very appropriate for the season uh this quote coming out of the smyrna church age was a quote that was listed on the flyer says oh it's going to be a wonderful day some mourn some of these times to show you that resurrection going to be universal there'll be two in a field and i'll take one and two in the bed and i'll take one see it'll be a night one place in daylight uh on the other side of the earth a man be a universal resurrect resurrection uh you know even as we're watching this video uh some are watching in the daytime others are watching at night right it's showing us exactly what the rapture is going to be like some will be in daylight some will be at night but nonetheless we'll all catch uh we'll be caught away in a moment in twinkling of an hour certainly looking forward to that the quote goes on to say um it'll be night one place daylight on the other side of earth be a universal resurrection that rapture the trumpet of god shall sound and every one of these of this little church here here here and even that little bunch that went through there and come out here here here says when that virgin that virgin when she's seen it uh in the seventh seen it seen in the seventh watch now you remember there were seven virgins is that right or i mean five virgins went out ten virgins went out to meet the lord five was wise and five was foolish i love the way this quote is actually coming to us i think we can see things and what the prophet was telling us uh here we when we read the scripture we know it's ten virgins but when he said there were seven uh i don't think that we uh have to look at that to to as a slip of the tongue uh we can see something that he's saying there because there was there's been seven church ages and that virgin is represented through those seven church ages that's why he said and that bunch here here there there you know here we are in that seventh church age and there's something that we're looking forward to uh at the at in this age so let's keep on reading it says ten virgins went out to meet the lord five was wives and five was foolish is that right it says now in those watches though there was seven watches see seven church ages it says and at the end of the seventh watch some slept from this watch this one this one this one uh and that the seventh watch there was a voice went out behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and i and i love the scripture uh as as i stated here in this quote we'll read it in matthew 25 but we have a responsibility we must go out to meet him amen and they rose and trimmed their lamps and all these others rose down here down down here oh won't that be a wonderful time so lamp trimming time for me is a wonderful thought for us to reflect upon i believe it's very appropriate for the season in which we live i believe we're living in the coming of the lord the hour is late and the rapture is at hand and i believe this when we recognize the lateness of the hour in which we live it invokes a response just as the scripture told us there in matthew 25 uh it says they they went up go you out to meet them so they got up they went out to meet them not only that they trimmed their lamps amen brother branham tells us in some places where where we should have oil in that lamp for it to burn representing the holy spirit too many people have water in their lamps we want to make sure we don't have water we want to make sure we have oil in this hour matthew 25 verse 6 through 9 is where the thought is coming from and again salute the pastor on his inspiration for this he says at midnight there was a crime made behold the black room cometh go ye out to meet him verse 7 that all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answer saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves when you read the rest of the scripture you recognize that as they went to buy the bridegroom came and they were they missed amen the coming of the bridegroom we don't want to miss amen the coming amen of our bridegroom in this hour we also don't want to miss his appearing amen and i want to just uh uh uh help us to understand because brother branham told us that the appearing of the lord and the coming of the lord are two different things however i want to state that uh we if we if we uh could recognize his appearing then we will be seeing a sign of his coming amen and if we can catch the appearing it is great it's a great probability that we'll also catch the coming notice what the prophet says here in the message uh the end time evangelism notice this quote here it says same thing today when you see his work now we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the lord now remember appearing and coming is two different words uh to appear and then to come now is the appearing he's already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years now it's a sign of his coming so his appearing is actually a sign and if you can catch the appearing then it's a high probability that you would catch the coming see now it's the sign of his coming he's appearing in his church in the form of the holy spirit showing that it's him because people because people cannot do these things that you see the holy spirit doing so that's the appearing of the lord now remember it spoke both places appearing and coming we can see that the lord jesus has appeared in the ministry of his prophet but we can also see that the lord jesus has appeared and is appearing in the ministry of his bride amen as we wait for his coming the appearing is a sign of his coming glory to god uh the scripture tells us in matthew 25 verse 7 the the then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and if there was ever time for us to arise and turn my lamps that time is now uh we must get the water out get the spirit in the war rip water represents the things of the world the oil is the holy spirit we need more of the holy spirit we can never preach enough about the holy ghost we want to make sure we're sealed amen until the day of our redemption we must be diligent in this hour for it is in this watch that the cry goes forth behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him this is a time the second coming of the lord and we're living under the promise of this coming i want to read a quote here amen as i close my thought here out of the message spirit of truth the prophet says this in a prayer it says we would ask thee heavenly father to remember us tonight now for those amen that are watching the service in the daytime i'll say remember us today and if there be any evil in us take it out lord uh tonight or today that we might be presentable to thee if you should come tonight or today because that this rapture is a universal rapture it says we pray for the sick and needy we pray for the church both here and abroad around the world thy children everywhere of every nation that we may wash our robes in the blood of the lamb and listening for that call behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him may we be able at that time lord by the grace of god and by the merits of jesus who we trust him to trim our lamps and go forward then to meet the bridegroom take the word of the lord and circumcise our hearts take all our unbelief out give us a great service and i pray that over these meetings lord give a great service in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you brother jack duff from sunny south florida we bring our greetings to you in jesus name god bless you it's good to be here and i want to thank the lord for this privilege to greet the body of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ around the world especially in this season of adoption may god richly bless you i want to greet my friend pastor solomon nachina and the life tabernacle in tamale ghana for the wonderful privilege to greet the convention this special season god richly bless you i bring great greetings from my wife family and church here in new e in nigeria we are pressing on to the perfection and i greet all the ministers all the pastors that are in this convention and especially those that we preach and those that are preached may god richly bless you and cry your ministries with charity god bless you amen let's have our prayer our heavenly father lord jesus we thank you for this wonderful privilege oh god to gather around your world to feed on this hidden manner lord you have always uh blessed us each time that we gather together and we trust lord that this will be a special season lord for the holy spirit to move once more among the bride so lord i pray oh god that will bless the convention and father but the purpose of god be fully accomplished and by the holy spirit pour out in a very special way lord and father may each one receive their portion and bless these few words that has been spoken now to the glory of your name lord may it be a blessing to your people in jesus christ and we pray amen and amen god bless you um just for a great thing i would like to read uh the book of revelation chapter 19 i thank god for the inspiration of the convention behold the bridegroom cometh live lamp dreaming time and um in the revelation chapter 19 and the bible said verse 7 say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is calm and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be already fine leaning clean and white for the fine linen is a righteousness of sense and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the mother supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true saiyans of god may the lord add blessings to the written of his words so friends revelation 10 is our very familiar scripture and um we saw the mighty angel come down from heaven gloated with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it's weird the sun and his face at his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open amen and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion ruled it and when he had cried then seven thunders ought their voices and when the seven thunders has ordered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven thunders had uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swabbing him that liver forever and ever who created heaven and a taste that darina and the earth are the things that darina and the sea and the things which are daring that there should be time no longer in other words time has run out praise the lord and we thank god to know amen that uh the holy spirit is here now amen and uh to show the bride you know by a seventh under revelation show the bride how to prepare for the great translation of faith praise the lord so we thank god for his grace that has brought us to where we are today and making us ready for the sounding of the last trumpet amen thank god for the wedding garment the the the the uh the the the lamp trimming time i love what the prophet said here in the message the back of the beast and the seal of god he said but what is it what what has happened so what day are we living in say oh my brother what they were living in said don't think i'm crazy i hope i'm not if i'm crazy just let me alone i feel better this way than i did the other way but listen say listen i tell you my brother and sister what is what is the sign of it is a sign we are at the end time what did jesus say about the sleeping virgins he said oh you call them churches virgins just like ken was exactly the same thing they worship but a sleeping virgin has no oil in her lamp that's a difference they have no oil in their lamb is that right so when she found out she was later than what she thought communism sleeping up on her she said oh give us some of the oil give us some of the oils they are worshippers too see how do you get this holy ghost then he said go buy it for from one that sells it and he said i remember the very time the sleeping virgins went to buy the oil that's when the bridegroom came glory don't you see it if the presbyterians and their peace corps parents and those others are coming and or those others are come seeking for the holy ghost you better get your alarm dreamed dreamed dreamed yes it needs dreaming pentecost better be dreaming some lambs amen get a lot of this world cut away from you you don't got collect uh color dead over the weeks got in bad shape you know that week is a great thing i used to watch what a real weak of god is a believer he's a weak a believer a man is a weak he's a look he's got a fire on one end up here and the other end is deep into oil drawing oil and making fire oh glory he said what a church what a power what a place to be hallelujah shining that same gospel light that shines in the east is shining in the west it shall be light in the evening time then he said rise dream your lamps that's the pride amen trim your lambs amen that's the bright core that's the holy spirit calling out to the bride dream your labs say pentecost dream of the world dream of the factions of the world drink of the things of the world get ready the hour is at hand hallelujah the allies attend time shall be no more praise the lord remember he said when they go looking for that oil that's the time and he said and right when they went to get this what happened what taking place then the bridegroom went in see america has blasphemed the holy ghost she's made fun of it ever since she calmed on the scene of existence 40 or 50 years ago she's got constantly made from the other churches has made fun they have showed themselves now they begin to stick their head out and saying we would like to have a little of this but just as when they go to doing that is a sign that we should go to trimming our lamps god raise up some preachers god raise up some preachers that we go to dreaming lambs i'm telling you what we need today is something that we trim our lambs praise god show the true pentecostal fire the original holy spirit pointing out amen i'm making the bride ready see you get an old lamb little lamb oh where the carbon gets on this on the lamp week it will smoke your lamp all up that's what is the matter with us we got too much carbon on the lamps too much carbon the fire can't drop right it can't can't get enough air from the bottom what we need is a good breathing spell a good breath fresh breath from heaven of the baptism of the holy ghost over again and the holy spirit walking in the church with signs and wonders following the true seal of god and that's what we are contending for the true seal of god the same holy spirit the same original power that fell under the pentagons and if there's the same holy spirit it will bring the same results it will bring the same action it will be the same manifestation because that is god a god cannot change praise the lord and the prophet said we need a fresh bread from heaven of the baptism of the holy ghost over again and the holy spirit working in the church amen lamp dreaming time praise god hallelujah lumped him in time fresh bread we know how he fell on them under the pentecost amen the holy spirit jesus had already preached on them i said receive the holy ghost amen but under the pentecost why do we are all gathered in one mind and one accord just like we have gathered in this convention one mind and one accord then all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind a that bread that that's that bread that went forth in the book of saint john 20 became a russian mighty wind under the pentagons and then baptized the people over again and the prophet said that's what we need a fresh bread good breakfast of a good bread bread fresh bread from heaven of the baptism of the holy ghost over again and the holy spirit walking in the church with signs and wonders following the truth following the true seal of god hallelujah he said i tell you what i'll go to the assemblies if they don't treat me right i'll go to the fourth square oh you got burned up you are smoking your light trim your lamp get ready we're at the end time amen you see but the wheels somebody will preach it somebody will tell it somewhere there will be some of them that will get it that's right i don't know how many because it says as it was blessed of noah so it will be in the coming of the son of man wearing source was saved but i don't know how many we get it but there will be some of them will trim their lamps there will definitely be some of them that will trim their lamps that's all there is to it for lamp dreaming time is on amen lamp trimming time is on praise god and we know that when those foolish virgins went to get when to get the oil they couldn't get it amen because there's not just enough you know there's only enough left for 144 000 jews praise god but the bride got the fullness of the spirit and she's ready she's made ready for the rapture the coming of the bridegroom so the inspiration here is the coming of the bridegroom behold the bridegroom comet amen is coming for a bride that has been called back to the vision of faith in god his wife had made herself ready revelation 97 amen there is a there's three things there his wife had made herself ready amen glory you make yourself ready by the world revealed by malachi 4. amen seven thunders preparing the bride amen for the great translation of faith shows the bride how to prepare seven thunders gathers the bride together amen seven thunders the bride's revival praise god shows the bride how to prepare you know reveal to the bride the threefold mystery god in christ and christ in you making you ready making you one with him praise the lord and then number two she's already fine leaning clean and white which is the righteousness of sense oh water power comes into the church amen to dress the bride up and then number three oh my here it is blessed that day which are called unto the mother supper of the lamb and how blessed we are to be living in this season in this time of the mother's supper of the lamb feeding on the hidden manner on the hidden things of god making ourselves ready by the world revered by malachi for amen and there's a final quote here presidency of my ministry he said i hope they will cry my ministry with this of letting me take the close of the world and dress his bride in the clothes of the world and for his righteousness i hope you'll crown me grant the ministry let me take the clothes of the world the fine leaning and dress the bride then if the clothes is preached which is the word amen and here we are we receive the clothes then we are dressed up in the in the wedding garment in the clothes of the world ready to meet the bridegroom amen the bridegroom comet go out to meet him praise his wonderful name so make the lord richly bless you and i pray that the holy spirit the oil we pour out in this convention amen and as many as our dental life we get that the vessels filled with oil as we dip that wick deep into the oil and the lamp the light is burning right on top of the wick and then in this message in this season there's nothing carboned up all the carbon is taken away there's better than love there's forgiveness there's joy amen there's love among the believers praise god even as brother abraham prophesied that charity will be here and charity will check all the evils out all the carbon things all the denominational things is cleaned out

blessing to be uh here with you one more time if you have your bibles i'd like to invite attention to a few portions of scripture joshua chapter 1 and also read from chapter 5 and then my conduct scripture is going to be hebrews chapter 3 verses 7 through 11. joshua chapter 1 and reads on these wise verse 1 now after the death of moses the sermon of the lord it came to pass that the lord speaks unto joshua the son of none saying son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all these people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your food shall tread upon that have i given you as i said unto moses from the wilderness on this lebanon even onto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of their life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for unto these people shalt thou divide the land for an inheritance which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not for me to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest this book of the lord shall not depart out of the mouth but that shall meditate therein their night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee with us whoever thou goest joshua chapter 5 verse 13 through 15 and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho they lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with a sword drawing his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him are thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him was saith my lord unto his servant and the captain of the lord's host unto joshua lose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place wherein thou standest is holy and joshua did so amen may the lord that is the blessing of the reading of his holy words god bless you may be seated god bless you and good

this convention so this morning um i would like to speak on the topic called out called out now brother branham told us and let us know that the church is god's call that group and just like with everything god does he always has a shadow and a full type in the old testament and so israel in egypt in bondage in egypt for 430 years and then brought out of egypt by god's stronger mighty hand is the shadow of the church is the top of the church is god for showing and foreshadowing the church before the church will ever come understand in the new testament and so israel's saw john in egypt and how god brought them out by the mighty and powerful hand and then took them into the promised land as he spoke to abram their father the teachers uh are um um three basic fundamental things that whole story of israel's bondage in egypt and their deliverance and eventual you know our journey to the promised land teachers number one the basic foundations of our christian faith are all laid in there late in there number two it teaches about the journey of the new testament church of which we are a part and number three it teaches about the glorious promises of god for this end time bride in this closing days of time all of these are contained in that story of israel in bondage come out of bondage their journey through the wilderness and their journey entering the promised land and the scripture i read joshua one is israel on the verge of entering into the promised land and you see joshua that was commissioned and joshua's commission was threefold number one take them across jordan into the land number two possess subdue and possess the land wherever the souls of your feet shall tread that place i've already given to you footprints mean possession subdue and poses the light now number three joshua's commission was divide the land to the people put them in their places in the land personally place them in the land so they can finally have a place of race that they can call their own because these were people who had been bonded in egypt for so long there was foreigners sojourners slaves in a foreign land and so they could not lay claim to any part of the land and so god wanted to take them out by his mighty hand to take them into their own land to where they would have their own land and be able to build their own homes and be able to live an inheritance for their children and generations after them that's the whole story god was going to take them into this place of rest physical race to where they will build and have their own land their own inheritance they can pass on down to their children and their children's children and generations after them so this story of israel in bondage teaches us these things with regards to the new testament church now israel was called out of egypt and they went on a journey so israel is always a type of the church brother branham taurus and bible readers everywhere know that israel is a type of the church always so israel on a journey is the church on a journey israel's journey from from egypt to canaan land the promised land is representative of the churches journey from the world into glory israel's journey was a walk with god because it was a journey designed by god himself and working with god takes faith because you only walk with god by faith so israel's journey was a work of faith fundamentals to a christian belief israel's journey was a work of faith our journey christian journey is a work of faith israel abrams are a natural seed the church abram's spiritual seed working with god by faith israel left the promised land and left egypt rather 2 million strong 2 million strong it was a collective journey but then that collective was made up of individuals who made up the collective it was a group of two million but individuals made the account for that group the same way the church on its journey is a collective is a group is a unit together but individuals must also do their work in this journey is a work of faith for a group is a work of faith for individuals the church is made up of individuals who make up the church i know what brother branham said the way he builds his church is the way he builds his individuals you cannot separate them and you'll understand that when we get the promised land when each one has to have their individual inheritance he gives the tribes their inheritance but individuals have got to have their inheritance like caleb went to joshua and said give me my mountain he asked for his own individual inheritance because he understood that we're a group but then i'm also an individual because that's how god deals with us not as a group but as an individual but together we must be together as a group to form the church and no one in the church is a is an island unto himself it's going to be a unit together but each one in that group must work their work with god and that's the mystery of a christian church a collective made up of different individuals and that's why in revelation chapters one of three one talks about the church ages and he said to he that hath an heir once speaking to each of the church ages to heal the have an air let him hear not to them to he even though he's speaking to the church but he addressed it to the individuals he talked about what they did wrong as a group but he addressed the admonition to listen to obey to do to act upon god's word to the individuals so these are fundamentals of a christian belief and that's why you see in the book of acts when the church bust on the scene it was a unity they were banned together they were unity together but then each one was in that group working with god on their own and you've got to walk with god you can walk with god like our church is working with god you've got to have your own individual work with god so israel are are went on a journey and the church is on a journey from the day of pentecost to a glory land that's what israel's journey represented for the church now let's get a lesson here in the journey of israel we can divide two clear segments out of egypt in the wilderness and from the wilderness into the promised land across the jordan river so you have the first portion 40 years in the wilderness and the second portion cross over jordan into the promised land the first half moses took them through the second half joshua was commissioned to took them to take them through the joshua commission that's what we read in joshua 1. so haven't said all of this let's notice a few patterns here you can see if there's so many more but just to mention these few fundamentals of our faith that you can find in egypt i mean you'll find the children of of israel in egypt when they were called out in the wilderness i will talk about some more of those things and these things were written for example so that we'll know how not to be and will know how to be so that will not fail after the same manner of example that they failed now if i mean let me just quickly read here my conduct scripture um [Music] hebrews chapter 3 verse 7 through verse 11 wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice hiding knock your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness that's the 40 years when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years there you are wherefore i was grieved i was angry i was annoyed with that generation and said they do always err in their heart in other words their hearts are never right towards me they're always doing wrong stuff in their hearts their heart is not clean towards me their heart is not willing to obey my word they do always air in my in their heart and when they're doing their hearts first of course it's automatic they'll do it on the outside but even if they don't do it on the outside once it's in their heart god looks upon the intents and the desires of the heart we judge the actions but god george is the intent of the heart and so god said because they do air in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swore in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest in other words they shall not get into the promised land the place of rest where they are going to rest from all labors and they're going to have their inheritance that they can pass on down to their children and their children and their generations after them god swore now when god took israel out of egypt it was supposed to be and the journey was to come out of egypt to a land god made that plane and clear to them that was the journey that was the plan clear not ambiguous not a single ambiguity about it was crystal clear plane they were coming out and going on a journey to the promised land and every journey of faith is like that when god called their father abraham he called him come out of the all the colleagues to a land i'm going to show you and everyone on abraham walked with god like that and so many examples in the life of abraham so many examples in isaac's life so many examples it's a journey and the journey always has a destination but when these people came out they behaved as though the destination was the wilderness now here was god's three-point plan number one call them out of egypt from egypt have i called my son would you refer that to jacob israel but also refer that to christ the messiah when he was sent to egypt with his parents when herod was looking to kill him i called my son out of egypt that's number one call them out and then number two god had a plan to take them through the wilderness god told moses don't take them by that way but take them by the amid god to where they are gonna go and not be able to run back to egypt if they see war on the way because god knew their hearts that some of these people were not intent on going all the way to the promised land they were leaving egypt but egypt was following them so god did not want them to go back to egypt god was making it difficult difficult for them to not live a christian life it was god was making it easier for them to live a christian life than to live like unbelievers back in egypt it's not hard living a christian life it's harder living an unbelievable life i'm not saying it's easy to live a christian life because the enemy fights but it's harder living as an unbeliever it's harder living as a sidewinder and going back is harder because the way of a transgression is hard life is hard life is not easy life is not a piece of cake a cakewalk no ask the ask the baby that's born that baby in the comfort of his mother's womb it comes out comfortable but once it comes out it understands right away first second on earth here is a different ballgame here different environment the pressure changes and that baby um cries that cry is what makes it live if he didn't cry in he cried in response to the change of pressure if he didn't cry it was dead on arrival so even though the changing pressure looked like it's something that's not good for the baby but he got the baby to leave and that's what this work of faith does it caused the things that be not as though they are it defies the regular it defies the conventional it looks a things from god's eye the way god says the word god says that's what it is and so israel on this journey here god called them out number one and number two they were to be nourished and fed and tutored in the wilderness and at the same time they were to be given their pro they were to god was going to keep the promise of the promised land right before them so they will be able to like be have their focus to what they're going to where they're going so that they will not think about going back and number three they will get in the land that was the plan simple plan you say why did god have to and this was going to take all of just 40 days bring them out of egypt get them through the promise i mean through the wilderness you say why didn't god send them straight from egypt into the promised land very simple god wanted to shape these people wanted to form them to to change them from these the people who had been in slavery for 430 years different generations of them they were used to the ways of egypt egypt was a land where there was a lot of adultery a lot of gods they had different gods for different things they had god for this god for keeping you in the morning god forgive me nothing and god created the night different gods which is why when god gave them the ten commandments he said thou shalt have no other gods before me and then he said i am the lord thou shalt worship me alone because if he didn't say that these people were used to having so many gods this god the moses was talking about there the fathers i told them about who had brought them out of egypt would just have been added to one of these there are so many gods but god said that thou shalt have no other gods before me i'm the only one god so these are people who had been in egypt for 430 years and so because of god's laws of nature it's not possible for them to just overnight become people worthy of the of the promised land they won't even have what it takes to live in the promised land so god brought them out and had a design for a short period of time to nourish them in the wilderness to feed them in the wilderness to prepare them in the wilderness and to keep their promise of the promised land ahead of them and in 40 days they will get to the promised land that was the plan but god knew that the environment the desert environment the seemingly harsh environment of the wilderness was what was needed to shape their character to shape their internal personal personalities to make them into what god wants them to be people who are worthy to receive the promise but israel are a totally different plan totally different idea as soon as it came out a work of faith faith like abraham it looks like the promise is not coming to pass you know god is walking on me god's walking on me here they came out they had been called out next stage been nourished tutored child trained for behavior for character and israel felt different as long as they came out every small problem they complained every small problem they complained those was the challenge that god put on their path god said take them by this way and they met the red sea have you ever thought they were going back to the same mountain where moses saw the pill of fire and god sent him to egypt but moses didn't come to egypt by way of the red sea but god said take them by the way of the red sea i'm sure there were many in there fella moyes doesn't know the road give him gps to let him see like which is the better route there are no tours on the road there are no obstructions there are no rivers but god said take them by this way and instead of just believing their leader they chose not to so just believing the messenger sent to them not just anybody claiming to be a messenger a thoroughly properly vindicated messenger one man with the power of god who took on a whole egyptian army and totally overcame them by the power of god with a crooked stick in his hand they saw all that yet this will have you or does that the gumption they have the nerve to even challenge this prophet at all the most every single time god said ten times ten times ten times in the first few weeks of coming out of egypt [Music] so god said i'm fed up with these people here and that's why the wood night journey became 440 40 40 40 years the wooden engine was supposed to be just 40 days to shape them more their character and all that and then they'll be ready for the promised land and what was it while they were shaping their i mean while it was nourishing them god moses sent spies into the promised land to bring the evidence what was that for to make them scared no to let them see the promise god gave them is really there but once they saw it they said no you have come to kill us here the anakims and all that the giants are there isn't that there are no graves in egypt and all of that stuff what god sent to help them to help their faith build their faith that's the very thing that they they feel faith faulted on and was at that point god said like that no i had it with these people here they are not going to go in the promised land only joshua caleb the two who believe me they are the only ones going to go and so you want to see a pattern here israel came out of egypt two million strong a church out of the world now god was calling a church out of a church was calling israel i was calling uh a uh uh joshua and kale left out of this church here and god said none of this prophet is gonna go in the promised land none of them i'm going to take a church out of a church i'm gonna take make a church out of out of out of moses i'm out of out of joshua and caleb and the new generation the their young children to take from his land so we see two patterns here a church out of a church a church out of the world number one and then a church out of a church and we see this pattern displayed throughout the seven church ages throughout the seven church ages so this was a state that israel was in going through the wilderness the 40 years was of their own making that wasn't god's making it was their own making because they refused to see that the wilderness was not the destination the promised land is the destination but as a journey through the wilderness and god knows the way through the wilderness and the wilderness has their purpose so israel missed the purpose of the wilderness and because the mesopotamians they ended up dying in the wilderness same way same way the wilderness represents the seven church edges the journey of the church from its birth on the day of pentecost through seven church ages that's what the ordinance represents to you and i in the new testament today and exactly what israel did the church has done israel fought and disbelieved the messenger the church ages disbelieved every single messenger that god sent to them as a matter of fact they killed them they murdered them murdered their character mother them physically just anything to make sure their message is not received and believed just exactly what israel did exactly what israel used to to the wilderness and so because of that the church has gone around and around and around in a death match like israel did like brother bob said the rapture would have long since gone but because of the church's unbelief who will not receive the messenger down through the age that god sent to each of the church ages so god he had israel out of egypt and then he had joshua and caleb out of that church same way he had paul the disciples out of the jewish church to form the call of the efficient church and all the way down like that in the churches was the messenger came to ephesus they didn't receive him god took the little group that believed him took them out of that church a church out of a church and that's how god was able to carry his seat on until he's come to this end time here just like it came to in israel came right down to just two people who came out of egypt two that from the core of that church that was on the verge of the promised land now that was gonna go in the promised land so same way seven church ages seven church ages the church has been anything but obedient to the word of god and that's why no clarity like israel there was a plan to go to the promised land this wasn't a plan-less journey it wasn't a journey with no direction no god had his servant there moses the prophet moses who let at the pathway for them according to the word of the lord but israel will have none of it they had a better way to look at it and so want they end up in the wilderness because the really in their heart they came out but there were no desires of going into the promised land if you watch later when israel eventually go in the promised land these anakims that they were crying about go reading joshua how much of an easy work these giants they were crying about there was no contest when israel eventually faced them when israel went in the promised land by the word of joshua and that's what made them an enemy that was not even couldn't stand up to their god and that's what they did they lost it all because of that fair and that made them not to listen to the messenger and they want to end up in the wilderness what they're doing same thing in the church ages one is the messengers and of the wilderness everybody has his own way how to do the things till it becomes like no the church is no plan until it come right down to this day this end time here the church no plan no clarity on the things of god or nothing whether it's prosperity which you preach or whether it is like kingdom of heaven which you preach whether it is you know just everything whether it's signs and wonders healings they just don't know what to do and even it's it's filtered into the message people not quite clear what to do what to say because of not believing what the messenger said there's no ambiguity there's no nothing unclear about the message there's nothing unclear about what the messenger of this age has told us about how to go from from egypt right down straight into the promised land nothing can be crucified at all but when people have their own different idea from what the messenger said that's what happens that's why many people have what have been wiped out in the wilderness that's why they have died in the wilderness spiritually death i'm a spiritual death and that's what the bible says is in matthew 25. 10 wise 10 virgins want to meet the bridegroom talking about the coming of the lord talking about the seventh watch brother branham said five were wise five were foolish and while they waited for the bridegroom they all slumbered and slept and he explained that to me that was through the seven church ages the slumbering and sleeping has different meanings two meanings at least slumbering when it comes to the things of god sleeping physically dying for the waiting for the resurrection they all slumber then slept and he said gonna in this age here and all this confusion in the ages just meet them slumbering and sleeping that's what happened in israel that's what happens in the wilderness slumbering and sleeping slumbering sleeping because they would not listen to the word of the messenger and because of that their faith had no anchor through that they showed and proved that they were not the seed of abraham because abram staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief abraham believed god and it was according to him for righteousness how much of that we have have we seen today too many people who claim to follow the message just hanging out queering the world of the messenger fighting the word of the messenger contracting the word of the messenger explaining away the word of the messenger trying to prove the messenger was wrong trying to prove like they tried to prove moyes was wrong any wonder they have slumbered and slept in the wilderness and you wonder they were never able to they are never able to go in the promised land any wonder of course there's no wonder about that little wonder about that because the partner is in the bible you don't believe the word your faith falters your faith weakens and when your faith weakens is only a question of time before you get taken out of the way and that's why it says that we shall reap if we faint not and even the prophet moses who had pleaded with them with god for this stubborn people so many times eventually got you that these people are stiff-necked people till he got mad and angry at them and himself got caught up in the attitude and behavior that would not make it into the promised land there was so much confusion so much directionlessness among the israel church and moses wasn't directionless but because he had jesus honored god god wasn't going to get him to go in the promised land that's why i said my summer movies is dead he's no longer here he provided direction people won't listen to it now joshua i want to take over and send them over into the second half of this journey to go into the promised land is a new group that is a new church we have got a new group a new church now we got now we are going over to the promised land same thing exactly in church ages a church called out from the world every age caller from the world but in every age also remnant listen to the messenger to the age like they listen to moses and that remnant is called out of that church to form the core of believers who believe that message and they form that real bright age i mean that church age and from that group god moves on to the next age and the next age before you know that they conquer and then a real small cop believes the messenger so god comes again to call a church from out of a church and right on the banks of the jordan river there was that church that church that had been called out of egypt that should have been called out of the church joshua and caleb and the new generation who are ready now to go into the promised land same way in the church ages right down to our age here this entire image here to where everybody has a say on how to go in everybody has a say on what christianity is supposed to be till there about 45 000 research says about forty five thousand christian denominations in the world right now forty five thousand blah blah blah always talk about iba nahara and some denominations about forty 45 000 check it out and this has given critics of christianity ample reason to say like that christianity is not true the claims of claim is not true why they are so much confused why they are not in agreement if they all believe the same jesus because they will not believe the word of the messenger because they don't believe the word of the messenger that is sent in every age and they will not believe the word of the messenger is set in this edge there's no ambiguity anywhere because what is one here o israel the lord that god is one lord thou shalt love him with all thy soul heart man and strength one lord one word one lord one faith one baptism but because the people will not believe the word of the messenger you have this confusion until it comes to this end time age here is more confusion than ever before a day that's like a cloudy day nothing clear not that day no night confusion but in the midst of that confession haziness you can't see your way clearly what is this no clarity on anything called god they don't know that they should preach the gospel or preach prosperity or preach like miracles or preach the word or preach they don't have a clue whether they should make their tent in this world or whatever in the midst of all that because then i will send the light in the evening time it was in the midst of all that that the cry came out behold the bagram cometh go here to meet him brother brahm explained that matthew 25 is a is a seven churches like already said and when the cry came out that's the seventh watch which is this edge here let me read you a quote where he said um just a minute um okay on the rapture december the 4th 1965 talking about this end time here and his ministry the first thing comes when he starts descending from the heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together a message goes forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what what was that the seventh watch not the sixth the seventh behold the brethren cometh rise and trim your lambs and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in the lamp but it's lamb trimming time what is lamp meantime it's malacca for time it's luke 17 time all this prophecy that it can perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture so just like joshua had his commission to take the people over out of confusion out of the wilderness into the land of rest in the land of corn and wine same way the last day joshua ministry william branham's was given a commission behold the pragmatist to prepare a bride for the lord jesus to go into this promised land and like joshua his commission is also threefold and we can learn from joshua what this prophet's ministry was all about what this message is all about so you'll know and not be worried and bothered about people backing out and sidewinding and different people all people young people all of that querying and all those those are not new things it's the type of the type has got to be perfectly in order for it to line up with scriptures query question disbelief doubt lie so here's where you're going to really understand what this message is all about i mean not as though you don't understand it just a way of talking to put a message together for you and i'm almost done really you can understand now how brother venom spend a major part of his early ministry and even towards the end preaching on the seven church ages the seven church ages in other words it was going all the way back to the wilderness years to show us about the wilderness years and then i'll show you from here that seven seals is the other message that you focus on to bring the people into the promised land so joshua on the virgin from his land he had the threefold commission take them over jordan into the new land number two subdue and possess the land number three divide the land for them so that they can come to their place of rest and be able to have an inheritance for themselves and for their children and their children's children and their generations after them that was the plan god's plan is never defeated it's only unbelief doesn't hinder god it only hinders the unbelief and all those people who did not believe who i'm believing they wiped out and died in the wilderness but they believe in bunch there they were on the verge of the promised land who did the unbelief hinder the unbeliever god's bride still matched on god's people marched on and that was joshua and the people on the verge of the promised land cross the jordan and he was brother branham given the same commission brother branham said uh uh always talk about the joshua chapter one was a very very peculiar scripture for him like it was something that was always coming to him and he gave a few example if you if you experience that he had in the early 50s up until like 57 where his bible will open up to joshua warren and so he had it received his own joshua commission let me just review you can check it out many many quotes to that effect let me just read you one well brother ben i'm talking about uh um joshua his joshua commission um all right this from israel and the church part five verse 41 now and at the end of that end of that vision i seen my bible coming to me and he turned over to joshua one who had a vision and then after the vision the bible came to joshua one and that has constantly been before me before this time 53 after that he kept talking about that oh just i just can't get away from it and tonight i want to read that because it's taking the train of israel over joshua the great leader then we'll drop back into numbers and pick up a lesson and come out within the next 20 or 30 minutes or something like that we'll have the personal service and that we make her you can make ready for it so here was brother branham talking about his own commercial and for the alzheimer's the old book uh are footprints on the stands of time the old publication there's a portion there where and if you've ever been in the office too in in in in jeffersonville um you see brother brahms bible or his old bible and his comments on joshua one and you know but the bible says on joshua commission too because just like joshua here he was to take the people over by the holy spirit into the promised land another quote here are talking about that on adoption part 4 uh 1960 may 22nd now what was the salvation he was trying to tell them but it is needed before the foundation of the earth is that right to the adoption of sons predator to eternal life now after you come into eternal life after you have been saved sanctified filled with the holy spirit your sons now god wanting to place you positionally also that you can work for his kingdom and his glory that's the gospel see first hear the word repent and be baptized name of jesus christ for the remission of sins taking away all your sins calling on the name of the lord jesus christ for the for for the promised land the promised unto every sajona that's on your own on your road if you left your home tonight a sinner saying i'll go over to the tabernacle god gives you the opponent tonight there's one thing left between you and the promised land what is promised land the holy ghost he's showing you his commission here while joshua was taking them to a physical line of rest his commission was to take this end-time bribe into the spiritual land of rest after the holy ghost baptism the land of adoption that's going to take us out of here in the rapture in the skies because you are not going out of here until you are adopted once you get to that land of rest god said is swore they will never enter into my arrest and this is the rest that brother venom is talking about here so only one thing listening on the promised land what is the promised land the holy ghost what led between joshua and the promised land was the jordan exactly right moses been a type of christ led the children up to the promised land then moses did not take the train into the promised land joshua took the people in and divided up the land jesus paid the price led them up to the holy spirit then god sent the holy spirit down and he personally put the church in order each man filling him with the prince of his being you see what i mean all in christ jesus how god participated this to the calling of this gospel so here we are we are ready to go over let's see what uh uh let's quickly uh uh uh um um look at each of these elements here crossing the jordan when we see how joshua across jordan then we'll know what it implies and what it means to you and i the jordan represented death we all know that and causing the jordan represented crossing from the all to the new crossing from the confusion of the church ages into the new land crossing from the commission of the wilderness into a land that's flown with milk and honey amen the jordan represented a death to the old and he breathed into the new notice now the only way they could cross the jordan was the act of the lord by the mouth of joshua the act of the lord but joshua gave the instruction on what to do with that act and once they are the priesthood into the water the jordan patent in other words they could only cross the jordan by the word of joshua same way here you can only come out of this mess by the water malachi 4. you can argue with what the prophet said and think that is what is going to get you anywhere and that's why people died in the wilderness even today so the word of the lord by joshua is what took them over into the promised land out of the old into the new into the land flowing with milk and honey glory to god what does this mean when you come into this world here by the water of malachi 4 you are coming from the denominations coming from pentecost coming from your own lifestyle coming from your own school and your old ways is a totally brand new world totally brand new life everything changes in malacca fall land in the new land of the holy ghost everything changes your outlook your perspectives your dressing your styles your values everything changes you can't carry them over no you can't go through the jordan like that everything changes because you have crossed from the old to the new that's what the jordan represents you have crossed from the confusion of pentacles the confession of the wilderness into the light of malachi first gospel the old corn of the land oh my hallelujah once into the promised land you are in the land of corn and wine you are in the land of the all kind of land notice when they came over into the promised land one of the first things that happened was as soon as they came in there the manner that they have enjoyed for 40 years stopped ceased totally and they were to feast on old corn of the land in the new land they were the first on the oracle of the land in other words the mana just spoon feed you spoon-feed you for babies in the wilderness whining complaining babies in the wilderness once you come into the malacca fort territory once you come into the joshua territory the old manner ceased the manifest and you are now into the land of corn and wine the old corn of the land the mysteries of the kingdom of god the deep things of god the rich things of god we can take you and teach you real sorry things now not skim milk ideas like they want in pentecost and that's why people you know you know querying what brother bannon said on these and all that and things that young people don't even fault don't even pay attention to those things fathers mothers don't pay at any attention to any of those things or you'll end up in the wilderness or you'll come over into the even cross jordan and you are not able to go any further so in this land here is the old kind of the land is the deep things of god not scheming ideas there's a there's too wide a gap between this messenger and pentacles and we're not talking an arrogance or a manner no but the reality is that too many people in the message don't even understand what they're supposed to do what they're supposed to be like what the message is what the destination is and so that's why these dependent consciousness the one who signs and wonders as though there is no miracle in the house of god if you don't have a miracle taking place go back to the world in the bread of christ miracles take place every single service every single day but because the people are so sure it's not gonna happen so they chase all these you know uh uh uh uh um uh um and it's it's it's it's such a big deal in the message right now because people feel unless they have a miracle unless they have a prophet in their church unless they have seen their church you know they are not whatever because they feel challenged by pentecostals and all the babies other other baby stuff and the place above the real miracle which comes by the word of god what on top of what on top of what on top of what on top of a word the all corner of the land that's when you come into malacca fertility and then what will happen next number one cross the jordan number two begin to conquer the land and here is where you're going to understand about the seven seals you can cross the jordan you can come into malacca first message you can preach the deep mysteries but until you understand and receive the revelation of the seven seals direct commission you cannot overcome and subdue egypt i mean subdued and the joy inheritance the promised land and that's what happened joshua the holy spirit ministry in this end time here like joshua of all joshua opened up the seven seals and the seven thunders underneath the seventh seal same way joshua in this age here this day here direct commission seven seals and seven thunders underneath it because joshua chapter five right before [Music] joshua opened up the seven seals down come the angel of the lord he saw the captain of the lord's words with the sword drawing in his hand and joshua said who are you are you for foreign same way before the seven seals were opened by the joshua of this end time here the holy ghost through the mystery of his prophet the great larger prophet down come the coming of the lord's host in the form of seven angels on mount sunset you understand why the devil fights so hard about the cloud because that's the lord himself come down to give the commission to go open up the seals so that the wars of jericho can come down so that the children of god can take over jericho and right through straight to their inheritance joshua chapter 5 down come the lord with the sword in his hand the sword in his hand in this end time here down come the lord in form of seven angels with a sword in his hand on sabino count sword in his hand what was that sword that saw was malacca for his adoption that saw was authority to take to take the seven seals and tear down every wall and give you your inheritance that sword was authority take you all the way back to eden where the sword appeared first you know in eden when adam sinned and lost his inheritance because you are going back to the same inheritance lord's inheritance and the caribbeans were protected the way of the tree of life and projects you have to allow with a flaming sword that turned every way the flaming saw the revelation of the world that adam had lost i've forgotten all these deep mysteries of god that adam just became uh amnesty about he had amnesia right away about them the sword saw to that god was covered with a revelation a flaming sword on the word of a living god the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and malakai was given that sword the same sword in the hand of the captain of the lord's host and if you watch when they went into jericho every man had a sword in his hand and they went straight destroying anything in their path every hebrew man had a sword in his hand [Music] that same sword that was in eden that same sword was joshua that same sword was in the hand of every man that went through after the wars of jericho came down that same sword was with malachi for his hands and that same sword is in your hand today by revelation to chop your way past every unbelieving devil it's in your hand but take a strong hand of faith to really make that sword and drive it to the enemy's heart hallelujah after the lord came down what would happen then chapter six was the opening of the sales watch what happened he said go around the city go around the walls of jericho seven days and on each day go around just once days one to six one time run the wall on day seven go around the wall seven times seven times around the wall on day seven what is that same thing malachi 4 did march 1963 open up the seals one seal per day for the first six days the seventh day seven seal opened covered with the silence said keep quiet don't say one word until ability to shout he placed the shout underneath the seventh day and they went around seven times what did brother ban i'm saying on the seven seals this seven seal mystery i have the revision revealed and it's those seven or non-thunders that was banging right straight close together isn't it three four mana but i'll tell you about one full of it and it's those seven thunders just exactly what joshua did put the seven thunders underneath the seventh seal to bring down the walls of jericho and put a sword in the hand of every hebrew man every hebrew believer to go right into jericho and take over now jericho's walls were not just the kind of wars you have in your house wherever you live in the world jericho's walls were about 20 feet wide 20 feet wide they said those walls were so big you could do a four-lane car race on those walls of jericho so they were very massive walls but the revelation of the seven seals and the seven thunders direct commission brought down every wall then and now if he did it then he's doing it right now the revelation of the seven seals and the seven thunders direct commission that's what gives us the authority to go and take over in the promised land so that we can have our inheritance again so you can have our inheritance and go into our rest that those people who will not believe moses died in the wilderness and could not come to this spot here so even if you come in the mess even if you cross over jordan even if you take the old con of the land and you don't receive malacca first message of the seven seals and the seven thunders you are not going to be able to bring down the wars of jericho because that's the strategy joshua knew to overcome and take over the promised land he went for the center of the promised land for us jericho he pulled it down by the seven thunders seven seven seven seals and the seven thunders malacca's message and watch once the words of jericho came down the seven seals that's direct commission the seven seals is revelation that's gonna take you all the way back to eden all the way back to the sword in your hand all the way back to spoken word power and authority all the way back to all that adam lost in the garden of eden the seven seals take you back to your rest oh hallelujah and then once they joshua opened up the seven seals and with the seven thunders underneath it was a jedi could come down and so will your walls come down your lifestyle lifestyle world will come down whatever wall you come down if you receive the message malacca first message of the seven seals you understand now what malacca for preaching seven seven church ages on the seven seals he was showing you something he was showing you how to go back to your inheritance showing you that by this revelation in the seven seals is what connects you right back to eden to where the sword is gonna be in your hand and you are gonna come to your rest you are gonna have your rest like adam had in the garden of eden you are gonna come right back to adoption time sons of god going back coming back to perfection coming back to authority coming back to rulership and watch how it happens watch high stats once they overcame jericho next place they went to was i the city of i i me myself i mean myself what is it the battle went straight to your personal life that's what it can represent your personal life the revelation of the seven seals malacca first message gotta touch your personal life she had done everything in your personal life that's unlike the spirit of a living god tie it down because we are taking over the land your land of your own body of your own flesh the wars of jericho have come down the seven seals brings them there's no spirit no authority nothing that can withstand the authority of the seven seals nothing nothing because that's the message right straight from the mind of god thus the seven spirits of god come right down in the form of a message what spirit can withstand it and it's been given to us and so israel with that they went over begin to attack i personal life so that the personal life of jesus christ can come into your life that's the rest and after i they went around everywhere in the land joshua attacked the center of the land first then he went to the southern kingdoms then went to the northern kingdoms what is it what does that mean malacca for his message his commission take you over take you over jordan number two conquer the land that's the conquering phase this lamb trimming time message cleaning you up getting every filthy thing out of your life trimming your lamps don't let your light be dreamed out with filthiness and suit rise and trim your lambs take the seals the message of malachi 4 and let it sow the satch fly into every nook and corner of your life sure we are predestinated but we got a job to do got to take the sword and chase every div every devil out chase every devil out in the center at the bottom the southern part the topmost part everywhere and that's what joshua did that's what joshua did that's what joshua did he had the army going round beginning with the wars of jericho coming down no matter the walls no matter how severe no matter how powerful no matter how thick bring it down and then go into your personal life i so that your personal life will get out of the way and his personal life every single day will come into you day by day becoming more like jesus christ by taking the message the sword of the lord which is the word of god by the spirit of god taking it and shining the light into your own life knowing to another person into your life so that the life of jesus christ can come into you day by day by day by day by day and then when joshua has done all of that has conquered jericho conquered eye conquer the southern kingdoms conquered the northern kingdoms there was still some land to be taken but by this time a lot of the a lot a lot of the a lot of the uh our promised land have been rid of its previous inhabitants your previous inhabitants in your land there are still a little remaining but the major part of the job had been done and so god told joshua chapter 13 you are getting all joshua there's still some land much land to be recovered so what we're going to do is this here but this time here the land had been rid of many of the enemies what happened was that joshua now got to the last part of his commission to divide the land to the people to the tribes and that's where your individual inheritance comes in because each tribe is made up of individuals so when joshua at this point here by this time there have been about seven years in the promised land and most of the land have been reclaimed but that still remain some remnant to be reclaimed and so joshua dismantled the army and now gave each tribe apart from the levites their own portion of inheritance for them to now go and take care of themselves and clean up the land of every inhabitant and that's where the individual inheritance comes that's why in chapter 14 that's why caleb came to me now therefore give me this mountain man hebron i know the anakims are there the the the the three sons of uh are are are they i'll i will take them out if the lord be with me i will take them out and what does that represent the dynamics to your mechanics because right now with the sword of the lord in your hand the revelation of the world you are chopping your way through and cleaning your life of every enemy but they're not all gone yet and that's where you get to the point of individual inherent possessing your individual inheritance in the promised land to ask for your own influence like caleb asked for his and that's when god sends you the dynamics upon your mechanics and what dynamics do the spirit of the living god after you have been justified sanctified baptized the holy ghost the holy spirit comes down on you to begin to add the spirit of living god to you by a manifestation of his own spirit himself and by an experience you are becoming more and more and more like just not by revelation now by an experience because the dynamic is here now and when god can see that he takes you aside calls you aside and visit with an angel and add three more words to you and you come into the rest of the lord you come into his rest adoption time and when you're adopted that's when you are ready to go in the rapture in the skies you have come to your rest a spiritual rest you are now going to a land of a physical arrest on the which is on the other side of the resurrection you are going the rapture in the skies to land on the other side of the resurrection so what are you senior preacher as i'm fixing the clothes what i'm saying here is that you have been called out by malaka for his message you have been called out from egypt you have been called out through the jordan you have been called up from the denominations heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure i've been called out of all of that and here you are now on the other side of jordan after called out what's next you are nourished you are tutored you are child trained for behavior the sword is put in your hands by the revelation of the seven seals and the seven thunders put in your hands to rise and trim your lamps and clean your land of every filthiness clean your land of everything on like jesus christ and when god can see you do that he sends the dynamics upon you to give you the energy the help you need to finish the job so yeah composes your individual inheritance in the promised land your individual inheritance is your adoption time to be to have your own hebron experience to where you clear every spirit out of your land by this authority and the spirit of the living god that's where we are friends that's what we're waiting on that's what the messenger has been about i don't focus on a bunch of sidewinders who have known they had to go in the promised land but you know for yourself when you know you are caller you know that your name is in the lamb's book of life and you are predestinated in the eternal section to take that rest to press your way past everything press your way past jericho pressure away past eye press your will right into your own individual inheritance in your promised land because you have been called out for that very purpose alone and we're here you're producing that purpose and you are going to be there just keep your mind on the goal and you will be there god bless you
