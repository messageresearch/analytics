Peter 1:3 and verse 19 okay so just wanna get that please good ii be the one and from verse 19 the last part of it there and it says we also have we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost a man and a man let's bow our heads a man's we want to pray now Heavenly Father Lord we read your word tonight Lord we look to you tonight he author and finisher of this this very book that we read from Lord these words are you tonight they're gone and

Bertie Williams he meant he meant to have a small tour tonight and it is another book of Acts amen another book of Acts pre-scored hallelujah isn't there a he many men Christ in a true church is a continuation of this book of Acts that we're talking about tonight isn't that right praise God the Prophet said so isn't that right hallelujah so we're looking for a continuation of what God started to do in the early church he promised to do it in the Omega church he promised to do it among our people our nother people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age and I believe tonight that God has such a people to name a man a man do you believe it tonight please God is so thankful to be living in the land of the living tonight praise God are we going to have a testimony just like Enoch Han but before we leave here remain we're gonna please God amen we're going to live something to our families to our friends to our co-workers wherever we are we going to live something amen amen we're not going to be deceived a man not like Eve praise God but we're gonna take the whole word amen and apply it praise God and do something about this word that we've heard for years and generations isn't that right holiday but it got a tick on form it's got a tick on flesh praise God amen hallelujah hallelujah begin to think about it more and more and it's not the work of man it's a work of the Spirit and we were living in an age where a man has been in control I've been in charge of things has been ruling things moving things around here seeing things having a say it's now right but that's only for a time and a season the time of the Spirit is beginning to switch over at some point it's gonna switch over from the natural to the spiritual isn't that right will be no more man doing the work but if we do work up the Holy Spirit the Prophet said it was they call it the book of Acts but what it's supposed to really be is the acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles amen amen is what wrought the works amen the Bible said the Lord went everywhere with them confirming the word with science with wonders and with miracles a many men with power with anointing with his presence Oh hallelujah hallelujah is night so I'm really excited tonight about what is God God is about to do because a man had his opinion about things Holloman has is say about what's supposed to take place but when God is in charge we cannot argue with it you cannot dispute it there is no debate God said so whatever God says in the church if God choose to set in the church apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors and ministers for your perfection for the work of the ministry to raise you up for such a time as this and who could argue with that the spirit is in control brother if court choose to fill you then Court is in charge if court choose to heal you then quarters in charge if court choose to redeem your family then court is in charge tonight if God choose to give you your heart's desire or no man can do nothing about it hallelujah in the book of Acts if you look back in the scripture the disciples will place my fire in the upper room no man came down and said you had to do this you supposed to do that there was no bishopric it's now right there was no rulership it was a Holy Spirit moving among them holy men speak as you read in the scripture and they will move by the Holy Ghost Peter stood up on that day a man the pier Pentecost and say repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and this promise is unto you and to your children and to as many of them as I power off the season a change town come the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit was now in charge brother sister tonight I long to see a church under the influence of the Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit where there's no more man to win anything man not making a decision no more but called himself Pilate revealing himself anointing the people by fire placing this one place in not one place in that one that's what we come for come the final place in Christ is no man long to find his place in this world man tried to find a natural purpose and man go to all kinds of lengths all kinds of breaths and widths and depths to try to figure out his purpose to try to figure out what he's here for and looking for self-fulfillment they go into all kinds of endeavors where it's science where is technology where it's in the pursuit of business where it's in the pursuit of knowledge hallelujah but the Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all these other things shall be added unto you if you wanna find your purpose you got to come to the one who made your purpose in the beginning he's the one who knows what your next step is if you don't know where to go if you don't know what you're supposed to do next look to Jesus tonight look to car tonight look to the pillar of fire he knows what you have need of he knows what you're supposed to do tonight oh I forgot anoints had an inspiration here my inspiration is one is a majority amen praise God one is a majority and now we can tie that in here now we talking to individuals individuals priests gone and remember in this book of Acts now when the Holy Spirit come down and anointed the disciples I was sitting there 120 what is it saying each one got their own lake of fire isn't that right the Holy Ghost pours out upon individuals it always does it always has praise God no church could hold a Holy Ghost isn't that so no group could come out and call claims they they've got the Holy Ghost or they've got the angel or they've got the power or they've got the key or daily it group you can't have that it's not biblical it's not scripturally supported hallelujah so we cast it out praise God the Holy Ghost pours out on individuals oh the church could hold a honey but the Holy Ghost you've got to get it for yourself oh somebody say man oh I now feel like preaching tonight oh you've got to get it for yourself your mother can't get it for you your father can't get it for you your husband can't get it for you your wife can't get it for you you've got to pray you've got to cry you've got to hold on to the horns of the altar as a one-in cause and cry out for your green hallelujah you've got to cry out you've got to do the plan you've got to do the first thing you've got to do your portion when you've done all that you can do and leave yourself upon God's altar hallelujah curtain of self-will is torn down then God will come down and consume the sacrifice by his holy fire and claim you as his own after you have done what you're supposed to do isn't there a wonderful one is a majority not such a powerful word and a prophet spoke about it isn't that right amen I don't have time to get to everything but praise God I'm just moving my inspiration tonight any man all God needs is one just think about that thought for a second girls work with individuals never with a group and the group think because there's always this clash of opinions isn't that right this one's saying that one saying this one doesn't like to wait this one said this and amen amen too much cooks spoil the broth isn't that right but God has always loved to work with individuals God always called one out of the crowd say you come when she went God took on the form of Jesus isn't that right in flesh and he walked this hurt he said you come Phillip come Andrew come Matt you come is now right he was call and individuals individuals from different walks of life individuals from different ways and different movements and societal backgrounds individuals at different jobs individuals with different profiles someone's hot-tempered someone's cool someone's life loving praise God a man Russian and then priests gonna like pizza a man be there was an individual there was no other brother like pizza in the group a man out of all of them when they were on the ship and they were afraid so afraid when he saw Jesus come walking on the water Peter was the only one apart I say it's Lord if that's you bid me come is now right he was an individual praise God hallelujah and that's why God loved them they the special purpose why he called pizza isn't that toe Peter said lover down me hallelujah and feed my lambs Peter feed my sheep Peter a man isn't that right honey said told Peter said after you converted coin stringing them red rain I know you think I am eat rice hallelujah but going string the brethren hallelujah there's a promise for you Peter don't you worry Pizza I know you're gonna fall I know you're gonna make mistakes I know you're gonna struggle I know you're gonna lose some things I know you're gonna gain some things but through it all you're gonna learn to trust in me you're gonna learn to put your hope in me I put you through it so you can trust him in it put you through it hallelujah some pseudo waters some to the flood some to great trials but all to the blood sometimes it's fiery temptation sometimes it's fiery trials sometimes they get hot Oh sometimes your soul get weary but Jesus Oh Peter I pray for you that your faith fail not that true all whatever you go through your faith in God will stand God put something in us to fight this good fight I never for one time ever Amen praise God refuted that fact isn't that right I thank God for it God give us a special grace to go through in this house with all of the evil that is in the world with all of the corruption that is in the world through lust God still caller Briony cause they'll call up people when I think about it I begin to smile something inside of me I just feel like shouting the creature caught in my life what he called me to what he called you to OHANA you could have been anywhere tonight but the crease of court calls you you was one when he calls you what's one person just one brother just one sister but what caught the two with one in his hand tonight's praise Cordia man had a 1 cup with a thousand to flight tonight point to underestimates the power of 1 in court today hallelujah hallelujah just think about it think about what your praise could do think about what your prayer to think about what your worship could you think of our your fake kachou one person could turn the whole situation around you one person could turn the whole scene around one person can make a difference one person could change the course of events one person could cry one person could scream one person could do something in the atmosphere page and a miracle could take place because one person catch a revelation of Jesus Christ present tense halleluyah halleluyah one person to do it it's now I look at Moses Moses was one man in God's hand and look how much power God wrought through him one man interrupted nature one man spoken let there be flies let there be frogs let there be hallelujah keeps weekend let that be locust oil hallelujah praise God amen amen amen Oh interrupted nature he upset the devil's program he upset Egypt he turned Egypt upside down brother prays if God could get you in his hands you're gonna upset the devil's Kingdom you're gonna upset what Shaitan has set up here praise God hallelujah hallelujah prophet said the devil has a system set up always waited for the beast power to roll in with the dynamics is now right to set that into motion to set the world council into motion they said all these things as prophesied to take place and the last day ii emotion is already set up you could imagine a bride in God's hands individuals have got have that he could use one over here one over here our place our place huh oh that's what the adoption is it's not a group praise God as individuals going into the Holies of Holies individuals kind of woe is me I am undone individuals being cleansed by fire individuals being callouts individuals being chosen being place being commissioned Oh a many many men sitting appreciable Isaac of its message Sunday what is me I am undone Oh sometimes we don't realize our own filthiness or goodness goodness or comeliness it's just as filthy rags in its night well I always think all that we want praise God is nothing God had to burn all around out of boozes in order to use him ohana forty years in the desert hallelujah God left him out there to bake out to bake out all the greenness give him a hot tempered wife it's not praise gonna let him sit out there and cool off a little while hey man he's not ready yet twenty years he's not ready yet thirty years he's not ready yet but God had a time in now he was working which and he knew when Moses would be ready he's never he's always right on time right when you need him right in your talk is haha that is his finest hour that's when he shows up that's when he shows himself to be strong caught in its finest hour when all the enemy is around you when you are surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand and you can't see your way out and you can't see your way true in your pack is how that's when it's his finest hour because he knows he can do it oh if you just trust and believe that all things will work together for your good to them not love pause unto them that are called according to his purpose there is nothing that he will not allow that he will not take you through and make a way of escape for you tonight Oh God didn't ask you to figure it out he told me to trust and believe he didn't ask you to figure it out he didn't ask you to take out a copy book I try to figure out how God is gonna do it no no no no just trust and believe open all things Piron all things charity never faileth just believe I call it a call I'll see you through that quarter make away for you and coral open the tour and what port all gone open no man can shut thine eyes and it brought open the door the holy ghost no man can shut that door tonight you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost oh it's for you it's for you it's for you tonight Laurie glory glory hallelujah one a majority ain't nobody turns over talked about that service Tony in the camp how the foolishness of of God amen hallelujah and how he does things it would seem foolish in the natural praise God it would seem crazy it would seem like what is this it would seem completely erratic but that's how God loves to move sometimes I feel he does it for spite just to throw you off just to let you know that you are not in control of this thing I am the one in control of this thing I is the one priest cause when Hannah timeout come she was parent she couldn't bring forth she was a reproof in our family but court had a time in for Hannah and Hannah grown and a prayer and she come to the temple and she kept oh yeah she kept up her bargain she kept praying she kept crying she kept coming to God she was perseverance and one day she receive a word now change her attitude change she be gonna walk difference she be gonna talk difference oh testimony the Lord is the one who raise it up the Lord is the one who bring a town port is the one who's in charge if you trust in him Oh Holly Hill never ever fail you he'll never ever lead you wrong Oh make a way for you tonight foolishness one man go down to Egypt to save two million people who upon slaves to Egypt Harlan is not the biggest king the biggest potent teeth of that time is now right Egypt the biggest superpower biggest national force that ever was he-man since that time here was Egypt standing on all her glory holiday here was one man with a stick one man would appear one man a little robe what he come down for he come to take over he come to say to Pharaoh let my people call you hell God's people long enough in man's eyes he looked people in man's eyes he looked like he can do nothing what can this woman do what can this old man free us from but positive liver this was a promised deliverer that cause swore to his children would send them oh come one old man took a stick and raise it up my people call it up rivers when he spoke I came flash I came frogs Oh hallelujah pulling himself strong because all things are possible tonight tonight we're gonna go into us I'm a prayer but I want you to believe in your heart what we're seeing tonight is true a man is now I just think thousands of years ago this same man McCall Moses walk the earth we are walking right now with shirts and ties on shoes but thousands of years ago these same men and women that's written in this pile of holiday exercise tapes in their day and they saw the same pill of fire that put a pranam saw in history brother we gonna see the shameful of fire in art a priest called hallelujah he's gonna heal a sick I can raise the dead I can cast out Devils again you're gonna see it your family's gonna see it your loved ones are gonna see it oh how god's gonna use you tonight Oh holiday to raise up another people to bring to pass the word of promise isn't that right do you love him one is a majority when God called Joshua he spoke to Joshua only is now I call one man Joshua after Moses was dead he say Moses my servant is dead now therefore Joshua come and take the people over hallelujah praise God you had your funeral service a man please going alright honey let's move over it's not right let's switch over now praise God it's time to take over it's time to get ready to call Joshua why the Lord will magnify your ministry among the people and let them know that the same spirit I was upon Moses is upon you how come and I've called you for this purpose the people in here the voice the people may not have known please go early to the extent of it but Joshua knew and as he keep the command the people who paid the people respected he told them march around Jericho once every six days on a seven day march 7 times they were here in instructions from court on my cheek that the man of God hallelujah was speaking from God speaking Paul cause keep your silence isn't that right just imagine for a six-day period they have to keep their silence because not a word they couldn't speak they couldn't do nothing well under silence God wanted to do a work it take obedience for you to really come into that condition praise God hallelujah think about it you couldn't speak couldn't say anything just march around in silence obeying every command or paying every instruction but that's how God is gonna have a church in this last days God it's gonna take individuals and he's gonna try them and he's gonna put them true stuff heavy stuff that's up a core know each holily unless a corn or wheat fall into the ground and die he will abide alone I'm quoting quale to be alone tonight no no no oh but there's more coming there's more fruits coming or the waving of the sheaths malachite was already gone for CH an adopted son has already come out praise God there's gonna be more top that sons Oh hallelujah hallelujah it's gonna be more sons a man adopted perfecting ojala used by God just like a prophet was is now bring you under obedience God wants to bring you on a subjection to the word so that you could follow the entire world full obedience to the Holy Spirit entitles you to the token it's nothing fallopian so all of the Word of God obedience or what he said obedience or what he says to do how to conduct yourself isn't that right because if he pills a man on one condition he's got to do it on a pillar man on the same condition isn't that right and if Cornelius was just if Cornelius was devout if Cornelius was sanctified praying always giving arms and a memorial in heaven for his prayers and God fill him with the Holy Ghost and God's got to do the same thing to somebody who's just somebody who's the pouch somebody who's praying always somebody who's in the spirit somebody who knows who they are what they call to - somebody's waiting on God waiting for God trusting in him believing in him and calling upon his name what would go to for that man but what go to for that woman he has a feeling he has to seal you God is obligated hallelujah though his promise to you if you keep him at your end of the bargain is Nair I'm so happy tonight one is a majority in God a man is no one person could change the course of events look at that woman with a dead baby he's now right I'm brother Byron was up there on the pulpit praying or than the platform is now right pray for the poor and 3/4 at once and what was what was her she was causing a stir she was causing a commotion she was causing a riot the prayer line had a specific order some time they call a last number first some time they call the first number and whatever praise God something they call it from 15 isn't that right there was a order prease go to the prayer line and Balaban will call a prayer cards and different ones and and people come up with ditions it was an order there was a structure taking place but this one woman she had fate this one little woman she had fate to do something different she had a need she had something she needed something she wanted and she caused such a commotion and Preakness and the Deacons down there to go deal with that no.11 she begin to battle she begins a fight she was not gonna take no for an answer and that's how you got to be tonight if you know you need something from God you can't take no for an answer take your feet and apply to God's Word if God said so don't believe it's oh it doesn't matter what the devil says doesn't matter what no one says 4,000 follow my right side no 10,000 fall on my left I shall not be moved if God said in his word not the secret to be healed the blind not to see that the cripples are to walk and we believe that this gospel must come to pass before the end shall come Oh father let the fire fall oh we don't care sink or drown let this life live in me let's seven thunders live in me if caught promise we are gonna have that same life that seemed flow of river rivers of living waters flow in all of us if God promised those would choose to be living and moving in a pride then we're here to believe it we hit a price points we had a pray for it wait for it pray without ceasing pray let out shopping until every one of those virtues its living in our hearts living in our souls Oh oh brother in the book of Acts they were so anointed people being healing pita shadow the anointing was flowing off of them it was on their hands it was on their feet we are coming back to that kind of a condition we are coming back to that kind of a church Oh hallelujah way to sit can't stay sick when the tongue can't stay dumb where the Deaf can't stay death with a weary cannot see where it's coming a revival that's gonna raise up the people offer their cups wheelchairs missing limbs are restored promises he said it oh if my peoples are humble themselves and pray and seek my face that's what we're here to do tonight pray on a squad for the power hallelujah because without him we can do nothing without him we will surely fail Harlan is now a Caleb said now therefore give me this mountain if the Lord be with me then I shall be able to drive out the enemy as the Lord had said here's your majority one man Caleb praise oh he didn't care who went with him who didn't believe who wanted to believe he knew what Moses said concerning him and he came to Joshua praise God with his appeal with his word a promise he promised me my Hebron is not and I'm here to get it you know what he said concerning me now I'm here for my portion I'm here for my inheritance and that's how you gotta come tonight hallelujah with boldness knowing what this word says concerning you I'm getting ready to close as Christians we move too feeble sometimes we live under privileges we don't understand the power that this word has the prophets had all of the authority of God lays in his word hallelujah you don't have the real
