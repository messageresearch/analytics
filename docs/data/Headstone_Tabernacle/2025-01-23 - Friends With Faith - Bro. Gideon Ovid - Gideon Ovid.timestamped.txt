[38:01] seated brother
[38:11] Anthony amen love them for a title
[38:15] tonight seems a little odd but it says
[38:18] friends with fate amen and inspiration
[38:22] relationships are
[38:25] important God God is very very
[38:27] interested in your
[38:29] relationships from the beginning of time
[38:31] when God existed Alone by himself he
[38:34] wanted
[38:35] relationships now I'm not here to talk
[38:37] love and marriage tonight but we talking
[38:39] relationships
[38:42] amen the type of relationship he want is
[38:45] one of accountability one of trust one
[38:47] of faithfulness where he could trust you
[38:50] to do what he said that you should do
[38:53] and that you could hold on to his word
[38:55] and you could believe amen that's the
[38:57] kind of relationship he wants as a
[38:59] matter of fact in in in the Garden of
[39:01] Eden he will come down every evening in
[39:03] cool of the evening and speak to Adam on
[39:05] a one-on-one basis because he wanted
[39:07] Fellowship he wanted to talk and
[39:10] communicate and make sure that we're on
[39:12] the same page we pushing the same head
[39:15] one mind one Accord on the word amen not
[39:18] encouraging each each other in
[39:21] foolishness but we on the word we have a
[39:24] goal a mission our objective and we're
[39:26] going to achieve it together that's the
[39:28] kind of friend he wants that's the kind
[39:31] of friends he want for us so he's very
[39:33] very interested in the type of
[39:35] influences we have he's very interested
[39:37] in the type of relationships we
[39:39] encourage he's very interested in the
[39:42] kind of friends we have around us it
[39:44] doesn't matter what shape or form they
[39:46] come in it might be in the school it
[39:48] might be on the job it might be in the
[39:49] community or the neighborhood it might
[39:51] even be in church but he wants you to
[39:53] have the right kind of friends he wants
[39:55] these relationships to to be Progressive
[39:58] he wants to have the type of
[40:00] relationship that they could depend on
[40:02] you you know often time you you hear
[40:04] stories and you're hear talk and you
[40:06] tell yourself nah they wouldn't do that
[40:09] because you know the person because you
[40:11] know the person you could almost put
[40:13] your neck on a block and you know they
[40:14] don't operate that way they live a
[40:17] particular kind of Life they they they
[40:19] operate at a certain level they don't
[40:22] speak that way they they don't live that
[40:24] way and you feel a level of confidence
[40:27] because it's your friend if it's a
[40:29] stranger anything goes but with God we
[40:33] talking about friends we talking about
[40:36] relationships we talking about the
[40:38] ability to stick closer than a brother
[40:40] the ability to know that my opinion and
[40:43] your opinion is the same why because
[40:45] it's tied to the same post which is the
[40:47] word it's tied together by faith not by
[40:50] our ideas or our thoughts our opinions
[40:52] but it's tie together and we could find
[40:54] it in the word we could find it in the
[40:56] message line upon line so it's not my
[40:59] idea versus yours and who have the
[41:00] greater Revelation no way it's by faith
[41:03] we are connected and God wants that kind
[41:06] of friend for us
[41:08] amen so when you think about it that
[41:12] scripture and I just want to revisit it
[41:14] one more time in Matthew you don't have
[41:15] to find it it says verily I say unto you
[41:19] whatsoever ye bind almost singular you
[41:22] ye bind on Earth shall be bound in
[41:24] heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on
[41:27] Earth shall be loosed in heaven speaking
[41:30] about one in the next verse he went and
[41:33] he said again I say unto you in case you
[41:35] Den he me the first
[41:36] time that if two shall agree on Earth as
[41:40] touching anything that they shall ask it
[41:43] shall be done for them of My Father
[41:45] which is in
[41:46] heaven and almost as if to say in case
[41:49] you didn't hear me I'm going to say it
[41:50] again in verse 20 he say for we're two
[41:53] and three not just one two and three or
[41:57] perhaps four and five or six and seven
[42:00] but where more than one are gathered
[42:03] together in my name there am I in the
[42:05] midst of them amen so that's a scripture
[42:10] so it it remind me when you when it said
[42:12] one can chase a th000 but two would put
[42:16] 10,000 to flight you don't have to fight
[42:18] up anymore because this friendship is
[42:20] not just strong but they're bonded by
[42:23] faith it bonded on the word it could
[42:26] stand up on that
[42:27] and together they could achieve anything
[42:30] amen so it says if you shall agree if
[42:33] you will agree it's not if two shall
[42:35] compete and I do better than you but we
[42:38] agree amen that's what God wants he
[42:41] wants friends to be be the kind of
[42:43] friends that could agree on things that
[42:45] could agree that she's the same
[42:46] yesterday today and forever and the kind
[42:49] of Faith he required back then is the
[42:50] same kind of Fate requires now and if we
[42:53] could do that we'll get the same results
[42:55] there no surprises as a matter of fact
[42:57] the Hebrew boys and we'll get to them in
[42:59] a little bit they didn't have time to do
[43:00] a zoom call they couldn't do a quick
[43:02] WhatsApp chat let's create a little
[43:04] group and see your opinion on this when
[43:07] the word went around and said listen
[43:09] furnace time they were Resolute they had
[43:13] one opinion one view One Voice one word
[43:17] and come and say listen we will not bow
[43:19] down it's not I as a representative of
[43:22] the group I just want to express that
[43:23] the way I feel might be different than
[43:25] the rest but we had a vote and we decide
[43:26] no it was wasn't that we could
[43:28] collectively agree that we will not bow
[43:30] down and if he doesn't deliver we still
[43:33] not bowing down that's what we standing
[43:36] on because we standing on the knowledge
[43:38] that his word Can't Fail his word listen
[43:42] will never return void so we can have
[43:45] faith and confidence in his word that's
[43:47] the kind of friends we want that they
[43:50] could speak an hour behalf and we're not
[43:51] worried we're not scared because we know
[43:54] we stand for the same things we can
[43:56] stand back to back and we not concerned
[43:58] about I wonder if he could stab me back
[44:00] you know to have second thoughts with
[44:01] these kind of friends with the kind of
[44:03] friends that God want for you will cause
[44:05] you to cut out friends that you have now
[44:07] it will cause you to go home and and
[44:09] start to introspect a little bit and say
[44:11] but listen here what going on these
[44:12] friends are really working for me you
[44:13] know I think I need to change I need to
[44:15] change some of them I to replace some
[44:17] some of them I have to come and
[44:19] re-evaluate the relationships I have
[44:20] with them because I don't think these
[44:21] are the kind of relationships that God
[44:23] want for me he want the kind of
[44:25] relationships where my friend friends
[44:27] could keep me accountable where my
[44:29] friends could stand for the same thing
[44:30] as me so they could speak for me knowing
[44:33] that is the opinion I will have because
[44:36] it's grounded in the word of
[44:39] God that's the kind of friends he want
[44:41] like I said the Hebrew boys didn't have
[44:43] time to consult with each other they
[44:45] couldn't come and say listen let's form
[44:47] a group let's see if they could give us
[44:49] um probably 5 days we could meet and we
[44:52] could perhaps after dinner we could talk
[44:55] about it and see how we really feel
[44:56] because because it don't really sound so
[44:58] bad because they say when music play if
[45:00] we just bow a little bit we may not have
[45:02] to bow to the crown but if we could just
[45:04] show reverence To The King by doing that
[45:06] then we will be spared they didn't have
[45:08] time for that they could boldly come and
[45:12] declare this is their position as a
[45:15] group because they were close as a
[45:17] matter of fact we'll get to it in
[45:19] chapter 3 but in Chapter 2 it actually
[45:22] says Daniel because of his relationship
[45:24] with the King because of his position
[45:26] when he was he could have referred his
[45:29] friends that the kind of friend you want
[45:32] so he referred them to the jobs they had
[45:35] they were made Lords and rulers and and
[45:37] they were supervisors basically of
[45:39] Divisions in the Kingdom because Daniel
[45:43] could have referenced them he said
[45:44] listen these fellas they just like me
[45:46] you know so if you're impressed by me
[45:48] you will like these guys that's the kind
[45:50] of friends you want they could support
[45:53] you they could help you they could tell
[45:56] you the truth they could tell you when
[45:58] when you're going wrong they can
[46:00] highlight that and you wouldn't feel bad
[46:01] because it's your friend right so he did
[46:04] this for
[46:06] them and we'll come back to
[46:10] it and we will explore time after time
[46:14] through scripture where friends make or
[46:17] break
[46:18] you not all friends is friends you know
[46:22] so you you look at job and job was going
[46:24] through his his his trial and he had his
[46:26] test to deal with and friends came and
[46:30] they had their opinion but these friends
[46:32] couldn't really encourage him you know
[46:34] they couldn't set him straight and put
[46:36] him on the right path but they were his
[46:39] friends as a matter of fact the prodigal
[46:41] son had friends too you know they could
[46:43] lime they could dance they could listen
[46:46] talk about carry on they had a good time
[46:49] when the money done the friends gone
[46:51] guys not the kind of friends we
[46:52] referring to we referring to the friends
[46:54] and said listen here what going on this
[46:57] is not the kind of testimony you
[46:59] want this is not the way your accustom
[47:01] going this is not the way you should
[47:03] live you're better than that you know
[47:06] the right thing so listen they could
[47:09] come together iron sharpening iron for
[47:13] you to be perfect because they want
[47:15] what's best for you and that's the
[47:17] friend that God wants not the friend
[47:20] that going smile with you now and
[47:21] laughing down the road because you're
[47:22] making a fool of yourself amen so
[47:26] sometimes you wonder why you can't get
[47:28] the results that you're looking for and
[47:31] some people go through that at times
[47:33] Abraham might have thought but look God
[47:34] called me why I can't see the blessing
[47:36] in my life that I believe I am entitled
[47:39] to and God had to call him aside and say
[47:42] listen here what you see this fighting
[47:44] and bickering and and harassment and
[47:47] drama that going on separate yourself
[47:49] from from lot I know he's your friend
[47:51] you know I know you're related I know
[47:53] all you're real good and all you're
[47:54] tight but separate yourself because I
[47:57] have something special for you and once
[47:59] you connected to the these friends or
[48:01] this friend I can't bless you any way I
[48:03] want to I can't pour out onto you the
[48:06] way I want to pour out in your life
[48:08] because you're still too interconnected
[48:10] with the wrong
[48:15] friends I I I hope you're hearing me
[48:17] tonight you know because it calls for a
[48:20] review are your relationships you see to
[48:23] God relationships
[48:25] important he didn't want to be alone so
[48:28] he don't want you be alone but he more
[48:31] concerned about the kind of friends you
[48:34] have the kind of relationships you keep
[48:36] is almost better to be alone than to
[48:38] have the wrong kind of
[48:45] friends you know you don't have to find
[48:47] it but in Daniel chapter 2 chapter 3 and
[48:51] verse 12 I'm going to read a little
[48:53] bit from verse 12 and it says
[48:57] this was an accusation against them at
[48:59] this time right so they do when they do
[49:01] they're working hard and I want to tell
[49:03] you listen your position in life doesn't
[49:05] make you immune to
[49:08] trials it doesn't make you immune to
[49:12] tests and challenges and things going
[49:15] wrong you may feel oh my God I'm so
[49:18] blessed and that sounds good it doesn't
[49:21] change the fact that you're trial next
[49:23] door coming up tomorrow you know
[49:27] it doesn't make it immune So Daniel had
[49:29] a nice lofty position Shadrach mesak
[49:33] Abednego they had their positions they
[49:36] were at ease in Zion the normal living
[49:39] easy good bosses but they came a
[49:43] time in which and I'm going to read it
[49:46] now in verse 12 there are certain Jews
[49:49] whom he have set over the Affairs of the
[49:51] province of Babylon Shadrach mesak bedo
[49:55] these men who came have not regarded
[49:57] thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship
[50:01] the Golem image thou H has set
[50:04] up in verse 13 Nebuchadnezzar in his
[50:07] rage and fury commanded to bring
[50:08] Shadrach mesach and
[50:10] abedo then he brought these men before
[50:13] the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[50:15] unto them is it true oh
[50:19] shadra do not ye serve my gods nor
[50:22] worship the golden image which I have
[50:24] set up because this is the system I put
[50:26] in place
[50:27] and I am the king I am the boss here so
[50:29] you need to really listen I have you
[50:31] where you
[50:32] are at times your natural boss might
[50:35] feel so too you
[50:37] know but promotion don't come from the
[50:39] east or west you know promotion come
[50:42] because your boss like you you know but
[50:43] same the boss like you the boss could
[50:45] unlike you
[50:47] too so in verse 15 he said no this is
[50:52] the negotiation part this is the
[50:54] compromising part he said now if you be
[50:58] ready that at what time you hear the
[51:01] sound of the Cornet flute H sack salery
[51:04] the Simon and all kinds of music you
[51:07] follow and worship the image which I
[51:09] have made well but if you worship not
[51:14] you shall be cast not tomorrow or next
[51:16] week you shall be cast the same hour
[51:19] into the midst of the burning fiery
[51:22] furnace and who that God who is that God
[51:26] that shall deliver you out of my
[51:28] hands so he expressing the Wrath at this
[51:30] point he said listen here what I'm not
[51:33] really mean or know I give any
[51:35] options when we play the music you could
[51:38] bow a little bit and you're safe or
[51:41] else I want to know which kind of God
[51:44] will deliver you from the Wrath I have
[51:46] because we have a furnace prepared
[51:48] specially for people who
[51:52] oppose in verse 16 Shadrach mesach and
[51:55] Abednego answered listen they call all
[51:58] three names they didn't have a rap you
[52:01] know all three of them they all answered
[52:05] and said to the king oh
[52:07] Nebuchadnezzar this is the testimony we
[52:09] have this is not just mine this is the
[52:12] one M my friend share with me we all
[52:15] believe this the same thing the same way
[52:18] no deviation line up on line word upon
[52:22] word precept upon precept this is the
[52:24] way we want it to be this is the way God
[52:27] presented to us amen you say
[52:31] listen oh
[52:32] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[52:35] answer thee in this matter if it be so
[52:38] our God whom we serve is able to Deliver
[52:40] Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he
[52:42] will deliver us out of thine hand oh
[52:45] King not just the furnace but out of
[52:47] your hand out of your wrath out of your
[52:49] negative thoughts in my life or toward
[52:52] me he will Deliver Us from that it went
[52:55] further
[52:57] he said but if not in verse 18 be it
[53:00] known unto thee so we want to make sure
[53:02] it's clear we don't want just say you're
[53:05] misunderstood because we not like you we
[53:07] want you to understand clearly be it
[53:10] known we will not serve thy Gods nor
[53:13] worship the golden image which thou has
[53:15] set up listen if you want to enrage a
[53:19] man show him opposition in this way bold
[53:23] fa too they say listen
[53:26] he was full of Fury and the form of his
[53:29] Visage was change against them therefore
[53:33] he spoke and commanded that they should
[53:36] heat the furnace one seven times more
[53:38] than it w was W to be heated so you know
[53:42] this is pressure now seven times more
[53:45] because now you're against him
[53:47] personally this is a personal attack and
[53:50] he commanded the most mighty men that
[53:52] were in his army to bind them Shadrach
[53:55] Meshach and ab bedo and to cast them
[53:58] into the burning fiery furnace and I run
[54:01] it down a little
[54:03] bit in verse
[54:05] 24 he say he was astonished
[54:08] Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished
[54:10] and Rose up in haste and spake and said
[54:11] unto his councelors did we not cast
[54:14] three men bound into the midst of the
[54:16] fire didn't we bind three men up and
[54:18] cast them in yes am they answered and
[54:22] said unto the king true oh King he
[54:24] answered and said lo I see four men
[54:26] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[54:29] and they have no hurt the form of the
[54:32] fort is like the Son of
[54:35] God but I want to jump to verse 27 it
[54:39] says and the princes Governors and
[54:41] captains and the King's councelors being
[54:43] gathered together saw these men this is
[54:45] when they came out whose bodies the fire
[54:48] had no power nor was an hair of their
[54:52] head singed neither were their coats
[54:55] change the smell of fire had passed on
[54:58] them so listen there was no sign
[55:00] whatsoever you know there was no residue
[55:03] there was no suit there was no
[55:05] discoloration you know the power of God
[55:08] was so listen it was so intense that
[55:11] nothing could separate them from his
[55:13] love you know nothing could impact them
[55:15] you know nothing was going to change
[55:17] their Fai you know nothing could shake
[55:19] it you know they were so determined that
[55:23] nothing was going to overcome that you
[55:25] know am H my god
[55:29] listen this is the good part after all
[55:32] that he made a decree in verse 20 29
[55:36] here therefore I make a decree that
[55:38] every people nation and language which
[55:40] speak anything things amidst against the
[55:43] god of Shadrach mesach and Abednego
[55:46] shall be cut in pieces and their houses
[55:48] shall be made of down hill because there
[55:51] is no other God that can deliver after
[55:53] this sort then the king promoted s
[55:56] mesach and Abednego in the province of
[55:59] Babylon so listen these are the same
[56:02] guys that oppose them know but this is
[56:05] the kind of friend you want the friend
[56:07] that could support you in keeping your
[56:10] testimony in God and and and having your
[56:13] faith in his word that's the kind of
[56:15] friends you want friends with
[56:17] faith
[56:21] amen I want to shift GE a little bit
[56:24] there were some lepers we know these
[56:26] stories know I'm not creating this I'm
[56:27] not making it up there was some lepers
[56:30] outside the city lepers with a s was a
[56:32] few of them right was four of them
[56:35] actually and brother brandham described
[56:37] this as dingy faith and when they were
[56:40] there they say at the entering of the
[56:41] gate in 2 Kings 7 from verse three he
[56:45] say they were at the front of the gate
[56:47] and they just figured out if I go into
[56:49] the city is death famine in the city
[56:53] there's nothing for me there so if we
[56:55] stay here we going die too so you know
[56:58] what we're going to
[56:59] do he said they rose up in the Twilight
[57:02] in verse 5 to go onto the camp of the
[57:05] syrians and when they were come to the
[57:07] uttermost part of the camp of Syria
[57:09] behold there was no man
[57:11] there for the Lord had made the host of
[57:13] the syrians to hear a noise of Chariots
[57:16] a noise of horses even the noise of a
[57:18] great host they said one to another L
[57:21] the king of Israel had hired against us
[57:24] the kings of the Hittites and the kings
[57:25] of the Egyptians come upon us so this
[57:28] noise was so loud they started to
[57:29] overthink they started to create
[57:32] pictures in the mind of what was taking
[57:33] place that was just the gentle hand of
[57:36] Jehovah you know just creating a way for
[57:39] the lepers because of their faith you
[57:40] know just ensuring that things were
[57:42] cleared for them you know because nobody
[57:45] wanted leprosy around them so God
[57:47] cleared them out in verse 7 wherefore
[57:51] they arose and fled in the Twilight and
[57:53] left their tents and their horses and
[57:55] their asses and even the camp as it was
[57:57] and fled for their life and when these
[57:59] lepers came to the uttermost part of the
[58:02] camp they went into one tent and did eat
[58:04] and drink and carried then silver and
[58:06] gold and rainment and went and hid it
[58:09] and came again and entered into another
[58:11] tent carried then also and went and hid
[58:13] it then they said one to
[58:17] another notice they said one to another
[58:21] everyone had the same idea at that point
[58:22] you know cuz they realized we do it in
[58:24] one tent we go to next next and the
[58:26] result is the same so they started to
[58:28] talk among each other this this is
[58:30] friends to have they start to consult
[58:32] about this and they say they said one to
[58:35] another we do not well this day is a day
[58:38] of Good Tidings and we hold our peace if
[58:41] we T till the morning light some
[58:43] Mischief will come upon us now therefore
[58:46] come that we may go and tell the king's
[58:48] household so they came and call onto the
[58:50] port of the city so listen it wasn't
[58:52] well you you all go ahead because I want
[58:54] to hide some more stuff here we will
[58:56] stay back here they taking no prisoners
[58:58] you know we going we stay in we going in
[59:02] we communicating we going and tell this
[59:05] friends to have when you work together
[59:07] like this with the same mind same Accord
[59:10] same vision based on the word of God
[59:13] nothing could stop you you know they go
[59:15] to the P of the city they told them we
[59:18] came to the camp of the syrians and
[59:19] behold there is no man there neither
[59:22] voice of man but horses tied and asses
[59:24] tied and the tens as were and he called
[59:27] the porters and they told it to the
[59:29] King's house within you see that that is
[59:31] the kind of blessing we talking about
[59:33] you when you could associate yourself
[59:35] with the right
[59:36] people that's what God wants that's when
[59:40] God could move cuz you're not just in a
[59:42] corner doing your own thing now don't
[59:45] get me wrong one is a majority in God
[59:46] you know but just imagine
[59:51] two just imagine
[59:53] tree single eyed and single focused with
[59:56] the same
[59:57] vision establish on the word of God by
[1:00:01] faith believing his
[1:00:03] promises my goodness
[1:00:06] listen referring to Moses there's a
[1:00:09] there's a there's a message led by the
[1:00:11] spirit of God
[1:00:13] 1956 and it was paragraph 56 actually he
[1:00:17] say he went down there with with this
[1:00:18] wife on a mule and two little babies
[1:00:20] with a stick in his hand an old Dead
[1:00:22] stick in his hand hbling around with the
[1:00:24] Whiskers hanging down like this perhaps
[1:00:27] baldheaded going down whiskers along
[1:00:29] like that his back was all bent over
[1:00:32] nearly 100 years 80 years you know going
[1:00:35] on his road down to Egypt that was Moses
[1:00:38] condition to take over that big nation
[1:00:41] it goes to show no matter how much in a
[1:00:44] minority you are as long as you're led
[1:00:47] by the Holy Ghost one is a majority
[1:00:51] amen I ask again if one is a majority
[1:00:55] how about two
[1:00:57] how about if you join forces if your
[1:01:00] friends believe the same thing you
[1:01:02] do you don't realize listen when God
[1:01:05] said go out in the world and preach he
[1:01:07] he instructed to evangelize you know he
[1:01:09] wanted you to have the right type of
[1:01:10] friends you know he wanted you to share
[1:01:12] the same word you know the same

[1:02:31] word speaking about Joshua and KB these
[1:02:35] were friends that's the kind of friends
[1:02:36] you want to have friends with faith not
[1:02:40] friends with foolishness friends with
[1:02:42] faith that could encourage you unto good
[1:02:45] works that could provoke you a little
[1:02:47] bit to do the right thing so in
[1:02:50] paragraph 36 it said now as we see them
[1:02:53] journeying on they finally come to the
[1:02:55] place place of Kadesh man just this is
[1:02:57] just after they left Egypt coming on the
[1:03:00] road they're now heading over to the
[1:03:02] promised land yeah just to paint a
[1:03:04] picture here this sorry that that was a
[1:03:07] place where there was a great well or
[1:03:08] Fountain out in the wilderness was one
[1:03:10] time the Judgment seat of the world many
[1:03:13] other little Springs come up in the
[1:03:14] Oasis there around it beautiful type of
[1:03:17] the Throne of God water life judgment
[1:03:19] the other little judgment seats churches
[1:03:21] all springing up around in new Oasis
[1:03:24] that's where Israel was
[1:03:27] that's where they were put to the
[1:03:29] test in paragraph 37 it says now they
[1:03:33] sent out 10 spies and they crossed over
[1:03:36] 10 sound like a nice group too you know
[1:03:38] guess what that's the bigger group it
[1:03:40] was 12 in all this was the the big group
[1:03:45] 10 but it had 10 versus
[1:03:51] too God don't look at the numbers you
[1:03:53] know God look at your ability to have
[1:03:57] faith in his word your ability to stand
[1:04:00] on his
[1:04:01] promises he not looking at the
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:05] size so they say listen when they came
[1:04:09] back all but two said this is the 10
[1:04:12] it's impossible for us to take the land
[1:04:14] we just can't do it our opposition is
[1:04:17] too great we evaluate them for ourselves
[1:04:20] they said the walls too high we look
[1:04:22] like grasshoppers be beside them they
[1:04:24] are Men of War they well trained we have
[1:04:27] no way of doing it that was the
[1:04:29] testimony they have is that the kind of
[1:04:32] testimony you want to have that's not
[1:04:33] the kind of friends you want God tell
[1:04:35] you every place you put your foot is
[1:04:37] yours and your friends saying listen we
[1:04:39] check it out you know despite what God
[1:04:41] say this is what we seeing the world's
[1:04:44] high they are Men of War we like
[1:04:45] grasshoppers what kind of friends is
[1:04:48] that that's why I say your relationships
[1:04:50] are important it's important the
[1:04:52] influences you have around you it's
[1:04:55] important the people you're allowed to
[1:04:57] speak into your life the people you seek
[1:04:59] advice from the people who are guiding
[1:05:01] you amen they say all but two you see
[1:05:06] with this two brother brandom says one
[1:05:10] Joshua and one Caleb who stood and
[1:05:14] quietened the people and if there ever
[1:05:17] was an hour oh listen to this if there
[1:05:19] ever was an hour that the Church of the
[1:05:21] Living God needs a Joshua and Caleb it's
[1:05:23] now that we could quietly the people
[1:05:26] before the holy spirit all of our little
[1:05:29] frantics and denominations and PE and
[1:05:31] running this and this has got it and
[1:05:33] this has got that stand still a minute
[1:05:36] God has got it that's the idea this
[1:05:39] Bible is the answer to every problem
[1:05:41] that ever come up God has the
[1:05:44] answer he's got the
[1:05:47] answer God's got it say that's the idea
[1:05:50] God has got the answer you set still now
[1:05:53] of course these ministers who said that
[1:05:55] we can't do this it's impossible for us
[1:05:57] to do this there were 10 against
[1:06:00] two so it was hard nobody said it was
[1:06:04] going to be easy you
[1:06:05] know nobody said this this this journey
[1:06:08] will be easy you know speaking to you
[1:06:10] now nobody say your life supposed to be
[1:06:13] easy nobody say because you serve the
[1:06:15] Lord and I'm a Christian and I've been
[1:06:17] in church for so many years and my
[1:06:19] parents with Christians too that life
[1:06:21] going to be easy he have test customized
[1:06:24] for you amen he want to rebuke and chase
[1:06:27] you too he want you to bring forth more
[1:06:30] fruit he don't want you just
[1:06:32] exist he want to see what you going to
[1:06:35] do with the tools he give you what you
[1:06:38] going to do with the talents he give you
[1:06:40] he looking for
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:45] increase he said that's the way it is
[1:06:47] today depends on what you're looking at
[1:06:49] if you're looking at the opposition if
[1:06:52] you look at the the the corn you're
[1:06:54] going on mash and I really don't want
[1:06:55] this one to feel any way about me you
[1:06:57] know and you know we've been friends for
[1:06:59] a long time I don't want this I don't
[1:07:00] want to throw them off now I really
[1:07:03] don't want them to feel bad we can't do
[1:07:05] this but he said listen I'm not looking
[1:07:07] at the opposition or know I'm looking to
[1:07:11] what God Said what God Said God said it
[1:07:14] could be done and it will be done but if
[1:07:17] you're just looking at what's no further
[1:07:18] than the end of your nose as the
[1:07:20] expression is it'll never be done
[1:07:23] because God keeps his word regardless
[1:07:25] amen with or without you he's still
[1:07:26] keeping his word so the choice is yours
[1:07:29] that's that's the beauty about the God I
[1:07:31] Ser the choice is
[1:07:35] yours once again I want to shift you see
[1:07:38] that kind of relationship is so
[1:07:40] important the people that you consult
[1:07:42] with the people you talk with I'm
[1:07:46] reminded in the book of Acts it was Paul
[1:07:49] and
[1:07:49] Silas preaching teaching having a good
[1:07:52] time these are the kind of ministers you
[1:07:54] want to see things happen when around
[1:07:56] amen and there's a particular story
[1:07:58] that's told that there was a
[1:08:02] woman that used to do all kind of simidi
[1:08:07] stuff and raise money for her
[1:08:09] master and Paul spoke spoke to her and
[1:08:13] all that dried
[1:08:15] up all the money dried up her ability to
[1:08:19] do this dried up and it looked like her
[1:08:21] life just dried up as a result
[1:08:24] opposition against Paul and Silas
[1:08:26] because these fellas preaching a kind of
[1:08:28] gospel that making us poor he preaching
[1:08:31] a gospel that seems to oppose our
[1:08:33] thoughts and ideas and our way of doing
[1:08:35] life because that's what they were
[1:08:37] accustomed to but here's what happened
[1:08:39] in Acts chapter 16: 20 and I'll just
[1:08:43] skip through it says they brought them
[1:08:47] to the magistrates saying these men
[1:08:49] being Jews do exceedingly trouble our
[1:08:51] city they teach Customs which are not
[1:08:54] lawful for us to receive ceive neither
[1:08:56] to observe being Romans and the
[1:08:59] multitude rose up together against them
[1:09:01] and the magistrates rent off their
[1:09:03] clothes and commanded to beat them and
[1:09:06] when they had laid many stripes upon
[1:09:07] them they cast them into prison charging
[1:09:09] the Jailer to keep them safely who
[1:09:12] having received such a charge thrust
[1:09:14] them into the inner prison and made
[1:09:16] their feet fast in the
[1:09:18] stocks what a sight you doing the Lord's
[1:09:22] business you know you preaching you
[1:09:24] teaching you're doing the work of the
[1:09:26] Lord people you know like to have you
[1:09:29] around but when you see a start to mash
[1:09:32] the corn when you come in opposition to
[1:09:35] the people or the status quo who believe
[1:09:37] you shouldn't be doing that this is
[1:09:38] where the drama starts so in verse 25
[1:09:42] and we know this very popular it say and
[1:09:45] at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and
[1:09:47] they sang Praises unto God and the
[1:09:49] prisoners heard them and suddenly there
[1:09:52] was a great earthquake so that the
[1:09:54] foundations of the prison was shaken and
[1:09:56] immediately all the doors were open and
[1:09:58] everyone's bands were loosed I didn't
[1:10:01] want to focus on that too much because
[1:10:03] they were together in the prison
[1:10:05] praising and worshiping and and the
[1:10:06] prisoners could have hear them they
[1:10:08] weren't doing this quietly they were
[1:10:09] loud they were praising God they were
[1:10:12] worshiping because in season out of
[1:10:14] season friend or no friend it didn't
[1:10:15] matter what the circumstance was they
[1:10:18] found themselves in a level of
[1:10:20] difficulty that they had almost no
[1:10:21] choice but to praise and worship at the
[1:10:24] Midnight Hour viewed as one of the
[1:10:26] darkest hours of the night they decided
[1:10:29] listen time to praise you know because
[1:10:31] we locked up already we tied up we
[1:10:33] tangle up here on the inner parts of the
[1:10:36] prison what else we will do and listen
[1:10:38] The Keeper of the prison was awaken out
[1:10:40] of his sleep because he he was charged
[1:10:43] to do that and he was sleeping on the
[1:10:44] outside he say and seeing the prison
[1:10:46] doors open he drew a sword and would
[1:10:48] have killed himself supposing that the
[1:10:50] Prisoners has fled but listen all this
[1:10:54] was for a reason
[1:10:56] remember I tell you God want friends
[1:10:57] with faith he want people who could hold
[1:11:00] fast to his word and believe and he's
[1:11:02] concerned and interested in
[1:11:04] relationships so look look at this we
[1:11:06] often say you know the praise and it
[1:11:08] shake it rattle the the prison bars it
[1:11:11] open up and we say it open bless the
[1:11:15] name of the Lord Mighty but here's what
[1:11:17] happens next they say Paul cried out
[1:11:20] with a loud voice saying do thyself no
[1:11:22] harm for we are all here we did run away
[1:11:26] we didn't Escape we didn't have a mutiny
[1:11:28] we didn't tell the prisoners it's Prison
[1:11:29] Break let's go no here's what we're
[1:11:32] doing he called for a light and sprang
[1:11:34] in and came trembling and fell down
[1:11:36] before Paul and Silas and brought them
[1:11:38] out and says s what must I do to be
[1:11:42] saved this is the mechanism God used to
[1:11:46] save the
[1:11:48] Jailer through this
[1:11:50] experience because they held fast to
[1:11:52] their testimony and allowed the trial
[1:11:55] that was sent to them they they listen
[1:11:57] they gracefully just accept it and
[1:11:58] embrace it you know because I'm sure
[1:12:00] he'd never see anything like this
[1:12:02] imagine having the opportunity to escape
[1:12:04] and not taken
[1:12:05] itow they were placed there for a a
[1:12:08] purpose so imagine he said listen what
[1:12:11] must I do to be saved in verse 31 and
[1:12:14] they said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:12:16] Christ Thou shalt be saved and thy house
[1:12:19] and they spake unto him the word of the
[1:12:21] Lord keep in mind they in prison and to
[1:12:23] all that were in his house
[1:12:25] and he took them the same hour of the
[1:12:28] night and washed their stripes and was
[1:12:32] baptized and he and all his straight
[1:12:35] away what a testimony that friends to
[1:12:37] have that's the kind of friends you want
[1:12:39] to have listen talk about the work of
[1:12:42] the Lord and when they had brought them
[1:12:44] into his house he set meat before them
[1:12:47] and rejoice believing in God with all
[1:12:49] his house and when it was days listen
[1:12:52] hear what happened at the daytime the
[1:12:53] magistrate sent the sergeant saying let
[1:12:57] those men go listen we don't need to
[1:12:59] keep them anymore let those fellas go
[1:13:02] and they say and The Keeper of the
[1:13:04] prison told this saying to Paul the
[1:13:05] magistrate had sent to let you go now
[1:13:09] depart and go in peace because really
[1:13:12] and truly and it doesn't say this here
[1:13:15] God really sent you in this prison so I
[1:13:17] and my family and my house Soul could be
[1:13:20] saved that is friends to have that is
[1:13:23] why you have this kind of relationship
[1:13:26] God have you where you are you know all
[1:13:28] you have to do is praise him and worship
[1:13:31] and bless his name and thank him because
[1:13:35] listen all things work together for
[1:13:38] good he called you before the foundation
[1:13:41] of the world to do this and only you
[1:13:43] could do it so he depending on you he
[1:13:46] want you have the right type of
[1:13:47] testimony can you imagine if Paul and
[1:13:49] Silas stood in prison and say I don't
[1:13:51] know what is this now I preaching Sunday
[1:13:54] Wednesday Sunday every day look them
[1:13:56] lock me up and beat me tear up my
[1:13:58] clothes what kind of testimony you'll
[1:14:01] have but listen at the Midnight Hour
[1:14:04] they had a praise and worship so loud a
[1:14:07] earthquake take place the prison bars
[1:14:08] open and they still Rock back the
[1:14:10] prisoners hearing them they say listen
[1:14:12] we not running away we know according to
[1:14:15] your Customs according to your rules we
[1:14:17] supposed to be here so listen we assume
[1:14:20] the position here this is where you
[1:14:22] place us so we here we not coming here
[1:14:24] to fight against flesh and blood we're
[1:14:26] not doing that we know the God we serve
[1:14:29] and the promise he made to us so we
[1:14:31] standing by faith on that
[1:14:34] amen it's important the kind of friends
[1:14:36] you have he's interested in
[1:14:38] relationships you know I can't leave
[1:14:40] this one out there was a guy that was
[1:14:44] suffering from
[1:14:45] py in The Book of Mark chapter
[1:14:49] 2 from verse one it says and again he
[1:14:51] entered into a capernium after some days
[1:14:54] and it it was noise that he was in the
[1:14:56] house so everybody knew Jesus was in the
[1:14:59] building and straight away many were
[1:15:02] gathered there in so much that there was
[1:15:03] no room to receive them no not so much
[1:15:06] as about the door and he preached the
[1:15:08] word unto them and they come unto him
[1:15:10] bring one sick of py which was born off
[1:15:13] four now listen I want you to understand
[1:15:15] it's not by chance this man could not
[1:15:17] bring himself this man didn't walk to a
[1:15:19] meeting he didn't say can you sign me up
[1:15:21] for the convention because I understand
[1:15:23] that Jesus is going to be there
[1:15:25] he had to have the right kind of friends
[1:15:28] without them he was going
[1:15:30] nowhere these friends had to have faith
[1:15:34] and believe that listen we not leaving
[1:15:36] you here because we could go for
[1:15:38] ourselves we could operate and we could
[1:15:40] tell you about how the service is but we
[1:15:43] are friends with faith we believe that
[1:15:46] Jesus can have an impact on you today we
[1:15:49] believe if we go you go if we stay in
[1:15:52] you staying because we are friends and
[1:15:55] that the kind of relationship we want to
[1:15:57] have relationships that are so important
[1:16:00] yeah that we could have a a
[1:16:04] relationship in which the foundation is
[1:16:06] Faith in which the foundation is the
[1:16:08] word of God so that's the kind of
[1:16:10] relationship they had here so they said
[1:16:12] they came to him bringing one and he was
[1:16:14] born of four so four of his friends was
[1:16:17] bringing him when they couldn't come
[1:16:20] nigh unto him for the Press they uncover
[1:16:23] the roof where he was was and when they
[1:16:26] broke it up they let down the bed
[1:16:28] wherein the sick of the pulsy lay when
[1:16:32] Jesus saw their faith now Jesus wasn't
[1:16:34] seeing the operation you know he was
[1:16:37] seeing their faith their belief that
[1:16:39] listen nothing going to stop me tonight
[1:16:43] from receiving the blessing I come for
[1:16:45] the change I looking for I'm not going
[1:16:47] home without it we have come here to see
[1:16:50] a crowd and say n we will come back
[1:16:52] tomorrow no no no no no no no we want to
[1:16:55] receive it tonight we want to receive it
[1:16:57] now we don't want to leave without that
[1:17:00] change taking place and because they
[1:17:02] believe that they could come I'm pretty
[1:17:04] sure based on today's standers a roof is
[1:17:07] not a cheap item any con construction
[1:17:10] person or contractor will say your
[1:17:11] foundation and a roof is the most
[1:17:13] expensive part so for you to tear up the
[1:17:15] roof that is not yours you had to be
[1:17:18] convinced you had to be sure that listen
[1:17:20] when I burst this thing up the master
[1:17:22] going to see the need and he's going to
[1:17:25] meet the need because I'm going to do
[1:17:27] something that is not the norm I'm going
[1:17:29] to do something different something
[1:17:31] radical something that is against the
[1:17:33] status quo you may not think about it
[1:17:35] but are we going to do it because we are
[1:17:37] the right type of friends we have faith
[1:17:39] that our friend could be healed
[1:17:40] tonight we have faith that he can be
[1:17:43] delivered tonight
[1:17:45] amen so
[1:17:47] listen hallah they broke it up they sent
[1:17:50] on the bed and in verse 5 when Jesus saw
[1:17:53] their faith he said unto the sick of the
[1:17:55] P say son thy sins be forgiven
[1:17:58] thee amen and in verse six once
[1:18:02] again the blessings of God don't make
[1:18:05] you immune to jealousy and envy and and
[1:18:10] spirits and backbiting and people trying
[1:18:12] to come against you you know not because
[1:18:15] God bless you mean oh I have such a
[1:18:17] hedge around me I at e in Zion we know
[1:18:19] the story of job but we see it here the
[1:18:23] sins be forgiven thee in the next verse
[1:18:26] but there was a certain of the scribes
[1:18:27] sitting there and reasoning in their
[1:18:29] hearts why do this man thus speak
[1:18:32] blasphemies who can forgive sins but God
[1:18:35] only they're not testifying and
[1:18:37] rejoicing with the fact that this these
[1:18:39] guys amazing boy they come down the roof
[1:18:41] this is a sight to see a spectacle no
[1:18:44] they get in a fight with what was said
[1:18:46] so I would say they're focusing on the
[1:18:48] wrong thing but they have their
[1:18:51] role immediately when Jesus perceived in
[1:18:55] spirit that they so reasoned within
[1:18:58] themselves they didn't see this they

[1:20:44] with
[1:20:45] faith amen the real test for them wasn't
[1:20:48] how long they walk with God or know or
[1:20:50] how far or who walk on water or who you
[1:20:54] know who was ask a question and didn't
[1:20:56] answer fast enough that that wasn't the
[1:20:57] test you know it wasn't who had the
[1:20:59] Revelation and who was was closer to him
[1:21:02] and who walk on the right side it wasn't
[1:21:04] that when all was said and done they had
[1:21:07] to face the word
[1:21:08] test it was one of obedience and Faith
[1:21:12] when he came and he said listen ter I
[1:21:15] want you to wait I want you to have
[1:21:18] patience and wait in the upper room you
[1:21:22] get an instruction so at this point
[1:21:24] point is a leveler it didn't matter if I
[1:21:26] call you first I call you second I call
[1:21:28] you last it didn't matter everybody had
[1:21:31] the same test and all you want to to
[1:21:33] follow me follow my word that is the
[1:21:36] instruction I give you want to be my
[1:21:39] friend or you walk with me three and a

[1:21:44] instruction wait T in Jerusalem amen
[1:21:50] listen they had to T there and come to a
[1:21:54] position
[1:21:55] in which they were in one mind and one
[1:21:57] Accord there was no fighting and
[1:22:00] arguing there was no personality
[1:22:03] battles nobody was trying to outdo the
[1:22:06] next one and and I singing better and
[1:22:08] and I I could say a different word and I
[1:22:10] could worship faster and I could pray
[1:22:12] longer it wasn't that you know they
[1:22:14] reach a point in which everybody on the
[1:22:17] same
[1:22:18] level everybody obedient to his word
[1:22:21] that's the kind of friends you want
[1:22:23] friends I could push you to
[1:22:26] righteousness friends that could push
[1:22:28] you to trust in God's word to stand on
[1:22:32] his promises that the friends you want
[1:22:34] friends with faith that could be single
[1:22:36] focused or you're on the same Mission
[1:22:39] listen I say listen how could two walk
[1:22:41] together at least they agree you know

[1:22:47] say wait are waiting he said t are
[1:22:50] taring he say wait here are waitting
[1:22:52] here and and not figuring it out myself
[1:22:56] I'm not trying to show that I'm brighter
[1:22:58] than you or wealthier than you or or a
[1:23:00] more experienced than than you we all
[1:23:03] following the same
[1:23:04] instruction we all marching in the same
[1:23:07] step to the same beat to the same drum
[1:23:10] because we're in the same Army
[1:23:12] supporting each other by faith that's
[1:23:14] the kind of friends you want now they
[1:23:17] all had to wait until the Holy Ghost
[1:23:19] came
[1:23:24] but listen if you want to learn anything
[1:23:28] do anything be
[1:23:30] anything I have seen the easiest way to
[1:23:33] get there is to model
[1:23:38] people to hang around
[1:23:40] them people who have done it
[1:23:43] before if you want to be a Mason work
[1:23:45] for a Mason volunteer for a Mason you

[1:23:57] because they could teach you they could
[1:23:59] Mentor you they could guide you they
[1:24:03] could teach you and show you things that
[1:24:04] you may not know even if it's in a book

[1:24:08] the experience right Elijah didn't sit
[1:24:11] down with elishah and say listen let me
[1:24:13] go through the schools with you know
[1:24:15] because it took me 20 years to learn

[1:24:42] you these steps to improve to build to
[1:24:46] level up that's who you want around you

[1:25:01] experience

[1:25:46] kind of friend you want if these are the

[1:29:58] he said listen I just want friends with
[1:30:01] faith in here you know so all your
[1:30:02] unbelief had to come out come outside
[1:30:06] because you will hinder the moving of
[1:30:07] the spirit of God you will hinder the
[1:30:09] moving of the power of God here with
[1:30:11] your unbelief I don't want that kind of
[1:30:13] atmosphere around me I want
[1:30:17] Faith he too was concerned about the
[1:30:19] relationships he had he too was
[1:30:22] concerned about the atmosphere around
[1:30:24] them for the power to work you have to
[1:30:28] be concerned about that you have to be
[1:30:30] cognizant and conscious of that and the
[1:30:33] decision you make and the role that you
[1:30:36] play cuz like I say it doesn't matter

[1:31:19] thee last scripture as we close
[1:31:26] as I think of a personal
[1:31:30] testimony it's so important to be
[1:31:33] consistent across the board it's so
[1:31:36] important that your friends your
[1:31:38] relatives your neighbors know who you
[1:31:40] are and what you stand for it's so
[1:31:43] important that you are the same Monday
[1:31:47] to

[1:31:56] in all his ways my brethren count it all
[1:31:59] joy when you fall in diverse
[1:32:01] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:32:04] of your faith worketh patience but let

[1:32:09] may be perfect and entire wanting
[1:32:12] nothing if any of you lack wisdom let
[1:32:14] him ask God and give it to all men
[1:32:16] liberally and unraid it not and it shall
[1:32:19] be given to
[1:32:21] him in verse six but let him ask in
[1:32:24] faith nothing wavering so he don't want
[1:32:26] you to have unbelief and doubt nothing
[1:32:28] wavering he for he that waver it is like

[1:32:34] a wind and
[1:32:35] TOS for not for for let not that man
[1:32:38] think that he shall receive anything of
[1:32:40] the Lord so don't be doubting and expect
[1:32:42] that you're getting anything don't
[1:32:44] expect that your your faith failing and
[1:32:47] God just going to show up strong for you
