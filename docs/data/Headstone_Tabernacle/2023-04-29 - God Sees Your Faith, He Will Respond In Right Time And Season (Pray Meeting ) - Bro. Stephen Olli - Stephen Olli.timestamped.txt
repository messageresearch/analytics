[13:17] amen amen
[13:19] praise God
[13:23] amen so let's go after this there was a
[13:28] feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to
[13:31] Jerusalem
[13:33] nowadays A Jerusalem by the Sheep Market
[13:35] a pool
[13:37] which is called in the Hebrew tongue
[13:39] Bethesda having five porches
[13:42] in these lay a great multitude of
[13:45] impotent Folk
[13:47] of blind halt withered waiting for the
[13:50] moving of the water
[13:53] for an angel went down at a certain
[13:55] season into the pool
[13:57] and troubled the water
[14:00] whosoever then first after the troubling
[14:03] of the water stepped in
[14:04] was made whole of whatsoever disease he
[14:09] had
[14:10] and a certain man was there which had an
[14:13] Infinity 30 and 8 years
[14:17] and when Jesus saw him lie
[14:20] I knew that he had been now a long time
[14:23] in that case
[14:25] he said unto him will thou be made cool
[14:29] the important man answered him sir I
[14:33] have no man when the water is troubled
[14:35] to put me into the pool
[14:38] but while I am coming
[14:40] another step it down before me
[14:43] Jesus said unto him rise
[14:45] take up thy bed and walk and immediately
[14:49] the man was made whole and took off his
[14:51] bed and walked
[14:53] and on the same day was the Sabbath
[14:56] praise the name of the Lord father
[14:58] blessed with our hearts tonight in Jesus
[15:01] name we pray amen amen praise the Lord
[15:06] even just a few words tonight
[15:09] amen so coming out from Brother
[15:10] Anthony's message when God stays it was
[15:13] a real blessing amen when God stays and
[15:16] we see that God moves in times
[15:21] when God moves and Seasons amen
[15:24] praise God and one time he said
[15:28] when the day of Pentecost
[15:31] was fully come
[15:34] and they were in one Accord
[15:36] then the Holy Ghost came
[15:39] amen
[15:40] so he waits till the time is right
[15:45] he moves when the season is right can we
[15:48] say Amen
[15:49] praise the name of the Lord
[15:52] and for example first of all sharing
[15:55] this here I have a mango tree
[15:57] and one time
[16:00] the tree is big
[16:02] there's absolutely nothing on the tree
[16:04] no mangoes WhatsApp
[16:06] but once the season sets in
[16:10] they are mangoes Galore
[16:13] every morning I have to pick up mangoes
[16:15] on the ground
[16:17] amen mango season has settled
[16:21] another example
[16:23] I was looking at the dry season and the
[16:26] rainy season
[16:28] and one day the sun is patching hot the
[16:32] the the the grass is brown and dry
[16:36] but the very next day when as the season
[16:38] moves in
[16:40] we get rain to cause flooding
[16:44] totally baffling
[16:46] it's all about this season and the time
[16:49] can we say Amen
[16:50] praise God I can't imagine in the UK and
[16:54] the North American countries and in
[16:56] other places
[16:58] when the winter time comes around
[17:01] you have to adjust
[17:03] you cannot say I want more summertime
[17:06] I am feeling to stay in the heat
[17:10] you will get wiped out amen
[17:13] so when the season changes you have to
[17:17] adjust
[17:18] you have to shift how you do things
[17:22] amen ready or not
[17:24] the season will change
[17:27] and nature Works in season and God has
[17:30] set it up that way amen can we say Amen
[17:33] praise God
[17:35] in Ecclesiastes chapter 3.
[17:39] we see that there's a time for all
[17:41] things
[17:44] to everything there's a season and a
[17:47] Time
[17:48] a time to born a time to die
[17:51] a time to plant a time to reap
[17:54] a time to break down a time to build up
[17:57] amen a time to weep A Time To Laugh
[18:00] everything
[18:02] goes in seasons and times
[18:05] praise God
[18:08] so all these things are in a natural
[18:12] but some of these laws apply to
[18:15] spiritual things as well
[18:17] amen
[18:18] God is a god of seasons
[18:23] there's a season of Revival
[18:26] there's a season of adoption are you
[18:29] looking for it tonight
[18:31] Hallelujah
[18:32] there's a Time
[18:34] of Deliverance
[18:37] there's a time for your healing
[18:40] how many ones you're healing tonight
[18:43] you don't have your mind healing of your
[18:45] body healing of your soul healing of
[18:46] your spirit there's a time of healing
[18:49] praise God Amen
[18:51] there's a time for your ceiling
[18:56] unto the day of our Redemption amen can
[18:58] we say Amen a time of sequence
[19:01] there's a time of restoration
[19:05] Hallelujah
[19:07] and we must understand
[19:10] that the times and Seasons exist and we
[19:14] have to work with them
[19:15] we have to work with the seasons and we
[19:17] have to work with the times
[19:19] amen
[19:22] and brother would often say that the
[19:24] anointing
[19:26] when it comes
[19:29] it is not just to say I feel the
[19:32] anointing
[19:34] or I feel good
[19:36] but it is a time of refreshing
[19:40] is a time for you to understand for you
[19:44] to enter in
[19:45] and receive your portion
[19:50] the anointing comes for a purpose
[19:54] praise God
[19:56] does not visit without a purpose can we
[19:59] say Amen
[20:00] can we say Amen
[20:02] when he comes
[20:04] look out
[20:07] you say you tell him speak Lord here I
[20:09] am praise God just look out when he
[20:11] comes hallelujah praise God Amen
[20:15] one songwriter says when Jesus comes the
[20:18] tempt us power is broken praise God
[20:21] hallelujah broken broken amen broken
[20:24] today Hallelujah he could break every
[20:27] chain tonight hallelujah amen
[20:31] when Jesus comes all fear is wiped away
[20:36] amen love pass away fear he says fear
[20:41] not to desire
[20:42] fear not little bride only believe amen
[20:45] when Jesus comes all fear is Cast Away
[20:49] only believe praise God when Jesus comes
[20:55] and maybe tonight
[20:57] he can visit us
[20:59] we can visit you wherever you are in
[21:01] your home
[21:02] in your situation
[21:05] each of you wherever you are
[21:09] you could visit you tonight
[21:11] when Jesus comes and may He raise us up
[21:14] into a higher place can we say Amen
[21:16] tonight
[21:17] hallelujah hallelujah praise God blessed
[21:21] be the name of the Lord
[21:28] don't look around
[21:30] he's here
[21:31] be sensitive
[21:34] because you can miss your visitation
[21:37] if you are not sensitive if you are not
[21:41] alert when he comes
[21:46] for example if the minister says stand
[21:48] up and receive your healing
[21:49] and you decide to look around
[21:52] or to go to the washroom
[21:55] you can miss your opportunity right
[21:57] there
[22:00] if the minister said raise your hand and
[22:02] give him praise and you say I'm not
[22:04] doing that I'm feeling tired tonight or
[22:07] I would do it when I feel too
[22:09] you can miss your opportunity right
[22:12] there
[22:13] amen
[22:15] why would you wait five years for your
[22:17] healing
[22:19] and when it comes
[22:22] you are not sensitive to the movement of
[22:25] the spirit
[22:27] simple instruction and you miss it
[22:30] and you don't obey you can miss your
[22:33] opportunity
[22:34] then we say Amen
[22:36] so we need to be alert we need to be
[22:39] sensitive
[22:40] to when God moves
[22:42] amen so help us Lord tonight
[22:46] when God stays when God moves we got to
[22:51] be ready
[22:52] we need to be a little amen
[22:56] you have a need
[22:57] but keep looking
[22:59] keep waiting stay focused
[23:03] because God is going to move
[23:06] God is about to stay but we have to be
[23:09] focused we have to be looking can we say
[23:12] Amen tonight oh glory to God
[23:14] yes Lord
[23:17] God will trouble the waters
[23:21] and you have to be alert
[23:26] you have to be looking for when the
[23:28] angel steals the water
[23:31] you have to be ready to dash in
[23:34] can we say Amen
[23:36] you have to be ready to dash in amen
[23:41] Elijah told Elijah
[23:44] if
[23:46] if you see me go
[23:48] you will get your heart's desire
[23:52] so I can see Elisha looking
[23:55] staring at Elijah
[23:58] focus on Elijah Oh Glory to God
[24:02] mosquitoes buzzing and biting but Elisha
[24:05] is not moving his eyes
[24:07] if you see me go
[24:11] he recognized he was in a season of the
[24:15] transfer of power Brothers I would say a
[24:19] season of the transfer of power
[24:22] so he stayed focused on Elijah
[24:25] so there's no time to play
[24:27] it's time to focus praise God if you see
[24:32] me go so you have to be looking
[24:35] you have to be alert
[24:38] when that angel comes to troubling water
[24:40] is the first man who enter and get sin
[24:43] so if you're not looking if you're not
[24:45] alert
[24:47] what will happen to you
[24:49] Jacob with the angel
[24:53] I will not let you go until you bless me
[24:59] he was in a time of Deliverance
[25:03] and he recognized the urgency of this
[25:06] situation
[25:07] it was now or never
[25:10] he had to do something
[25:12] he had to do something
[25:16] I need to get empowered to deal with
[25:19] what's coming next
[25:22] something is coming next a great
[25:24] Challenge and I need to be empowered
[25:28] and when the season comes
[25:31] you have to seize the moment
[25:34] you have to grab a hold of it
[25:37] don't let it pass you by
[25:40] so we are waiting on the season of
[25:42] Revival you're waiting on adoption
[25:46] be alert
[25:47] praise God
[25:50] put a mark on those who sigh and cry for
[25:52] the Holy Ghost put a mark and those who
[25:55] sigh and cry for the Abomination around
[25:58] you praise God
[26:00] waiting present amen glory to God Amen
[26:03] grab a hold of it
[26:07] amen
[26:09] so until that season comes
[26:13] beyond the expectation
[26:16] you look outfit
[26:18] and be focused Dash into that anointing
[26:22] to receive your portion Hallelujah
[26:26] it is not for the lazy
[26:30] it is not very thoughtful
[26:33] it is
[26:35] so get on fire forgotten I give you a
[26:38] lot of praise tonight get on fire for
[26:40] all let's get on fire for God tonight
[26:42] Hallelujah
[26:44] praise God praise God
[26:48] so Saint John chapter 5.
[26:52] at the pool of Bethesda
[26:55] a great multitude of impotent folk lay
[26:59] there
[27:02] what Abraham said crippled
[27:04] lame
[27:06] blind
[27:07] halt withered
[27:09] twisted up people
[27:11] impotentful diseased Folk
[27:15] one place he said hundreds of them
[27:18] gathered in the five torches around the
[27:21] pool
[27:22] laying there
[27:25] waiting on a season
[27:29] on a season
[27:31] yes a season waiting on a season
[27:36] lying there just waiting on a season
[27:40] at a certain season
[27:43] an angel would go down into the pool
[27:46] and Trouble the water
[27:49] still up the water
[27:51] and whoever went in
[27:53] first
[27:55] after the angel
[27:57] would be healed
[27:59] just one sick person would be healed in
[28:02] that season
[28:05] what a situation
[28:10] suppose you were the sixth year person
[28:12] in the line
[28:15] would you stay
[28:17] knowing that you don't stand a chance of
[28:19] getting it
[28:22] or would you go away
[28:27] suppose it was once ahead of the angel
[28:29] came to trouble the water
[28:32] what would you do
[28:36] see
[28:39] so when the angel came and the people
[28:42] and the person went in and got healed
[28:44] but Ram said it was a miracle
[28:49] once you get into that water first
[28:52] you would be healed it was a miracle of
[28:55] healing
[28:57] babram said in message expectation The
[29:00] Virtue from the angel went into the
[29:02] prison and they were healed
[29:06] then the people waited for another
[29:09] season
[29:11] bye-bye
[29:13] waiting on a season
[29:16] waiting on the season
[29:19] there's something about waiting on this
[29:20] season
[29:22] in expectation on the expectation
[29:24] waiting waiting for that angel waiting
[29:27] for that angel looking out for the angel
[29:29] to dash in
[29:32] you can imagine if you're waiting
[29:33] looking all around and
[29:35] you might miss the injury Bank come and
[29:37] pass you by and put this news looking
[29:39] well that will enter in
[29:41] maybe tonight the angel would stood up
[29:43] the waters around your life and give you
[29:46] a miracle
[29:49] what is it that you have need of tonight
[29:53] is it a great break breakthrough in
[29:55] prayer
[29:57] is it that you want some victory in your
[29:59] life
[30:01] is it that you want overcoming Grace
[30:04] overcoming strength what is it that you
[30:08] have need of tonight Hallelujah
[30:13] and the prophet carried away with him
[30:16] for years
[30:20] our heaviness in this Spirit whatever
[30:22] I'm saying as if he had done something
[30:24] wrong
[30:26] he asked God over and over
[30:29] he tried to pray about it
[30:32] he tried to make everything all right
[30:33] the best he knew how but it never left
[30:36] him
[30:38] until one day
[30:40] when he walked with God
[30:43] then it was lifted after years
[30:48] so God works in seasons and times
[30:52] don't underestimate it
[30:54] can somebody say hallelujah tonight
[30:56] praise God praise God praise God Amen
[31:00] not one thing
[31:03] can happen
[31:04] before the season comes
[31:07] and before the time is right
[31:12] so you got to have patience with God
[31:16] and you have to have patience with
[31:19] yourself
[31:21] but the miracle is on its way give the
[31:24] Lord a hundred praise tonight Hallelujah
[31:25] Glory
[31:27] thank you Jesus
[31:29] the many men have patience with God have
[31:31] patience with yourself tonight
[31:34] from the message God and his people God
[31:37] and his people
[31:38] but Ram says he always works in a
[31:41] miraculous way
[31:44] with signs and wonders
[31:47] he promised them in these last days and
[31:50] we are living in the last days
[31:54] we got a right to expect them expect
[31:57] what
[31:58] miracles
[31:59] why
[32:01] he says to bring his people together
[32:05] to increase our faith
[32:07] praise God
[32:09] praise God so he's God still performs
[32:12] Miracles can we say Amen tonight
[32:15] can we say Amen tonight
[32:18] he is still a miracle working God
[32:22] Hallelujah I wish somebody would believe
[32:24] that today that God still works miracle
[32:28] and tonight we are believing for our
[32:30] precious brother Micah that God would
[32:32] work a miracle for him even in that
[32:34] hospital bed and Mount Hope tonight
[32:37] praise God and little Alex in the
[32:39] hospital praise God that God will do a
[32:42] miracle tonight because we believe in
[32:44] miracle and he's a miracle Wicked God
[32:47] Hebrews 13 18 is tell the same yesterday
[32:51] today and forever praise God amen
[32:54] hallelujah amen we are believing for
[32:57] brother Micah tonight
[32:59] glory to God
[33:01] so in closing off
[33:04] but tonight this is what I want you to
[33:07] see before we go down to pray I'm not
[33:10] sure if I can see it just right
[33:15] there were hundreds of people of
[33:17] impotent folk at the pool
[33:22] all of them would like to be healed
[33:25] all of them waiting to get into the pool
[33:29] when the angel troubled the water
[33:33] but this certain man
[33:36] he was a paralytic
[33:38] he had an infirmity for 38 years
[33:44] and there was no one there was no way he
[33:48] could get into the pool by himself
[33:54] broadly kindness did not apply there
[33:58] because everybody wants to get into the
[34:00] pool first to be healed
[34:03] when everybody waiting to be healed
[34:05] see everybody trying to get in first you
[34:09] can't say well you know
[34:14] that's what I said so beautifully
[34:15] brought out some time ago
[34:18] but he kept on coming very time maybe he
[34:21] stayed right there I don't know
[34:24] 38 years which is infirmity
[34:29] Lord could it be my time
[34:32] Lord I need a healing but there's no one
[34:35] to put me in the pool
[34:39] Lord It's 38 years I'm here help me Lord
[34:45] he told himself
[34:47] there it is he told himself
[34:50] I am staying right here
[34:54] because this is the place where there is
[34:56] a possibility
[34:58] that I can be healed
[35:02] I am still right here I'm going anyway
[35:06] because this is the place where there's
[35:07] a possibility
[35:09] for my healing
[35:11] is there a possibility tonight
[35:15] then I'm staying right here
[35:18] I'm not moving
[35:21] because this is the place where there's
[35:24] a possibility that I can be healed
[35:26] amen
[35:28] he had some kind of faith
[35:32] because the faith reached the father
[35:37] blind batimias cried out in faith I need
[35:40] help
[35:41] Jesus helped me tonight
[35:46] hallelujah what around says he cried out
[35:49] loudly but Jesus was so frightened could
[35:51] not have heard about tibia's it was his
[35:53] feet
[35:54] that reached across that Jesus prayed
[35:58] Hallelujah
[36:03] but this impotent man
[36:07] his feet touched the father
[36:11] his fate moved the father
[36:15] and the father sent Jesus to him
[36:20] Oh Glory to God
[36:22] Glory
[36:26] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[36:29] faith
[36:33] God is looking for faith
[36:37] it is faith that moves the hand of God
[36:41] it is faith that moves God
[36:46] so his feet touched the father
[36:51] and the father sent Jesus to him
[36:55] Here Comes Jesus
[36:58] full of compassion
[37:00] but going only where the father sent him
[37:04] doing only what the father showed him to
[37:07] do and nothing else full of compassion
[37:10] oh hallelujah praise God praise God here
[37:14] brother from the message the pool of
[37:16] Bethesda
[37:19] Jesus
[37:20] when he passed there he saw a great
[37:23] multitude
[37:25] he had all the power of God in him
[37:29] he could have healed every person there
[37:34] but he was a true prophet
[37:36] he only did what the father showed him
[37:39] to do
[37:42] instead of saying anything to them
[37:45] he healed one man
[37:48] not a but a man that had an
[37:51] infirmity for 38 years
[37:56] he healed him
[37:59] and walked away
[38:01] and left the great multitude of people
[38:04] laying there oh my
[38:08] God why did he do that
[38:11] next message they always come
[38:14] for LeBron
[38:16] Jesus passed by hundreds of people
[38:19] and walk right on by them
[38:23] because they didn't have the faith to be
[38:26] healed
[38:28] you see why he passed them
[38:31] he walked past the multitude and healed
[38:34] one man that had an infirmity
[38:40] so it's connected to Faith
[38:43] his faith reached a father and the
[38:46] father sent Jesus to him
[38:49] so tonight your faith can touch the
[38:53] father can we say Amen
[38:55] can we see him in tonight your feet
[38:58] can't touch your father
[39:01] Oh Glory to God glory glory glory glory
[39:05] this man's feet
[39:07] touch God
[39:09] that's God
[39:11] 38 years he held on believing
[39:15] because he stayed there he said there's
[39:17] a possibility I'm staying right here I'm
[39:20] going nowhere
[39:21] I can't get into the water but I stayed
[39:24] right here this is the place where the
[39:26] possibility lies
[39:28] this is the place where the angel
[39:29] troubling the water in this area right
[39:31] here and he's staying right there
[39:34] I can't get into the water but this is
[39:36] the place where the possibility is
[39:39] somehow
[39:42] he would get healed he didn't know how
[39:45] he didn't know him but he held on and
[39:48] his feet God honored his feet
[39:51] God honored his faith
[39:54] listen
[39:56] his faith and attitude
[39:59] was so outstanding
[40:03] that while the others were waiting in
[40:06] line to go after the angel in the pool
[40:10] his feet moved the father
[40:14] and instead of going to the angel
[40:16] deity came walking to him
[40:21] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[40:23] God
[40:24] let me see that one more time
[40:28] while the others were waiting in line to
[40:30] go after the angel into the pool
[40:34] his fate
[40:36] movie the father
[40:38] and the father said Jesus directly to
[40:42] him
[40:43] and hundreds of people laying by the
[40:47] pool
[40:48] deity
[40:50] came to him the others were going to the
[40:53] age of the following the pool but God
[40:56] came to this man hallelujah hallelujah
[40:59] this man had Jesus come directly to him
[41:03] by passing all the others
[41:07] will thou be made whole
[41:11] will you be made whole one person
[41:16] you the individual
[41:19] do you want to be whole
[41:23] do you want to be healed tonight
[41:27] take up your bed and walk give him
[41:29] another person right hallelujah
[41:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[41:34] party man thank you Jesus
[41:40] so this was his time
[41:43] this was his season of Deliverance
[41:48] this was his time for divine encounter
[41:53] his feet
[41:55] your fate tonight
[41:56] can move the hand of God
[42:01] we could see that tonight
[42:03] if we could see that tonight
[42:05] his feet according heaven
[42:09] and God sent his son to minister of
[42:13] virtue
[42:14] directly to him no glory to God not just
[42:18] blessed my heart so much amen others
[42:22] lining up doing the normal thing
[42:24] reaching for the angel to enter in
[42:28] his feet reach heaven and God sent the
[42:31] father send Jesus directly to him he
[42:33] didn't even have to go anywhere amen God
[42:36] came straight to him
[42:39] amen so tonight as we pray
[42:43] God can visit you directly and answer
[42:46] your prayer
