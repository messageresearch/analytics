bless you we certainly appreciate being here it's a joy to come into the house of god and that fellowship around your word and to share the word with you so this morning we want to go straight into the word saint john 1 we want to read from verse 19 to 37 and luke chapter 24 we want to read from verse 13 to 27. saint john 1 19 to 37 and luke chapter 24 reading from verse 37 to 27. saint john 1. and this is a record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him what thou and they confess to deny not and confess i am not the christ they ask him what then are thou elias he that and he said i am not a dao that prophet he said no then certainly unto him who are doubt that we may give answer to them that sent us what sees thou of thyself he said i am the voice of one crown the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as sat the prophet desires and thee which was sent of the pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptizes thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet john answered them saying i baptize with water but a standard one among you whom you know not he it is who commit after me is preferred before me whose shoes that i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptized in the next day john see jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of god which taken away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after becoming a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should maybe manifest to israel therefore i might come baptized with water and john b record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and an abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he hallelujah which baptized that with the holy ghost and i saw on their record this is the son of god and again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he said behold the lamb of god and the two disciples hear them speak and they followed jesus and luke chapter 24 from verse 13 and behold two of them went the same day to the village called emas which was about ru which was from jerusalem about three score full logs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they commune together and reason jesus himself drew near and went with them and the eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said to them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk on a sad and one of them whose name was cleopas answered and said unto him only a stranger in jerusalem has not known the things which have come to pass here in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him unto the condemned to death and crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and besides all this today's the third day since these things were done yey and sitting woman also of our company made us astonish which were earlier to see falcon when they found out his body they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels which have said he was alive and certain of them which were when us went to the falcon found it even as the woman had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken or not christ thus suffered these things and to enter his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself may god bless this word you may be seated we are grateful to be here today and uh it's always a privilege for me to be in the house of god amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i'm still rejoicing thanking god for his love his grace and his mercy and if you haven't heard that bible teaching why sit here and die go back and listen to something to listen listen but over again don't sit in your homes and die don't sit in the corner virus environment and just die do something do that them lepers you move forward you see if we stay here we die we go back in the city and familiar grounds we die we go to the syrian camp we might die we're going to do something oh harlan don't just sit there and die so this morning i have a title changed from the prophet to and his prophecy an inspiration a more sure word of prophecy more show and this scripture this inspirational martial or prophecy as you would know is on ii peter 1 uh 19 said we have also a more show with a prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as until light that shines in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in all by the will of man but the holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost so prophecy uh god breathed that's why all scripture is given by inspiration it is called breathe the breath of god is upon the prophecy the other context scripture i'd like to read before getting into the message and this context scripture is from second kings chapter two familiar scripture and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah onto heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went into elijah from giggle elijah sent elijah tarry here i pray thee for the lord it sent me the better and elisha said unto him as the lord live it as i still live it i will not leave thee so they went down to better so this prophet elijah was telling his successor elisha stay here and he was seen as the lord livid hallelu i will not leave thee hallelujah and the sons of the prophets that are next class now that what better came forth elisha and said unto him knoweth doubt that the lord will take away the master from my head today he said yeah you know it hold your peace then i would shut up don't even say anything don't try to discourage me don't try to hinder me don't try to tell me nothing negative hold your peace oh glory to god elijah said unto him darry here and i pray before the lord has sent me to jericho son you do have to continue you could stay right where you are and be blessed but the lord sent me to jericho and that young man said that the lord liveth as i so live it i will not leave thee so they went to jericho and the sons of the prophets that when jericho came to elijah so all of them under a special anointing of prophecy all the manner of special anointing to know elijah leaving that very day and as they go from station to station to station they are dear to tell him yo you know that your master will be taken from you today and they said no it's doubt that the lord will take away the mass of my head today he said yeah i know it hold your peace and elijah's in an entirely i pray here for the lord to send me to jordan and jordan represent that so if there ever was a time for the man to honk a dung in this tyrion thing was that but that young man was different he says the lord live it as i so live it i will not leave thee and they too went on hallelujah and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to you are far off and they too stood by jordan oh glory to god so while all these things are unfolding people looking people watching they're watching they're watching they're watching they all know along the way elijah tell this man stay here stay here stay here allow man they can't hold him down they can't pin him down they can't stop him oh glory to god when he hit jordan they want to know what happened no because this is a different calling altogether hallelujah elijah took his mantle wrapped it together smoked the waters and they were divided hither and thinner and they went who went on triground and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah's and elisha asks what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee elijah said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me he said there was a harder thing nevertheless if those see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall be so so there was a condition you have to see me go you have to know i am gone you have to know i have to come back you have to know my ministry is finished oh glory to god then you could have whatever you asked for or give the lord a shout oh glory to god and it came to pass as they went on and talked that behold they appeared that chariot of fire horses of fire and passing them both asunder and elijah was was up was taped up in the world under heaven so elijah was raptured isn't that right so god sent that rapture anoint him upon a last day elijah to release it to elisha bride hallelujah that's the anointing that was caught up in a charity of fire and one day you'll be caught up to meet him or give the lord a shout by that same anointing all glory to god is not by chance god sent back that's him elijah spirit back in this last day and there's elisha bright to come forth or give the lord a shout hallelujah some will stay at bethel some will say a jericho some will stay this and stay there but the bride will move across jordan all glory to god break to us the seals in the back of the book that we might cross jogger them oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus elijah saw it and like elijah was caught up in a whirlwind of the heaven and i just saw it he cried my father my father the child of israel and horsemen around and he saw him no more and he took a hold of his own clothes and rent them into pieces and he took up the matter of elijah and that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan he took the man of elijah and fell from him and smoked the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah where is the lord god of that prophet william branham oh glory to god we need a second venom we are neither next branham we need a next prophet we don't need no new elijah we are no modern prophet we just need where is the lord god and elijah that's what we need oh give the lord a shout feel inspired as even he took the mother of elijah that forever him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he also split smitten the waters they parted his anteda and elijah went over and then the sun when the sons of the prophets which were the viewer jericho saw him they say the spirit of elijah god rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowled themselves to the ground before him and the prophet said that the world will bow at the feet of men and women who cross jordan once more the world will hear direct from god oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah oh it's good to be here this morning oh hallelujah changed from the prophet to his prophecy hallelujah so what we need is an old-fashioned god sense called in religion that was called the willingness out of the church now the teaching can't do that you know no no no we need to come back to the holy ghost and fire back to the thing that burns out the drugs and brings the old-fashioned preaching back make heaven high hell heart gone barry straight we need that kind of a preaching tips can do that you know we need that kind of a preaching make heaven hell present tense hallelujah oh glory to god but to do it your congregation will vote you out sometimes good preachers are led astray by the congregation and that's the reason i have no denomination i have one headquarters and that is from heaven wherever he sends me there i go whatever he says i say we don't want no denomination this church ever talk about the nomination you lost your pastor right then i wouldn't hang around it for another five minutes every church that ever denominated went to seed tell me one that didn't and tell me one never rose again the holy spirit here we go is sent to lead the church not some group of men the holy spirit is all wisdom men get starchy and indifferent and after a while man get puffed up and arrogant and god just take his hands off for them they still be on the pulpit but no hand of god upon them they still have a congregation but no hand of god upon them they still minister in the world but no hand of god upon them the spirit of god take his hands off of them oh hallelujah you hear what the lord told john the one upon whom you see the dove descending it appeared in the people with anointing nice veteran holy men all kind of men coming together baptized but the one hallelujah is have won the dove drop down and then take off hallelujah because of looking for that one the one where the dove come now and remain that is the one hallelujah go there tell him his name is jesus he has so tell him this one that no he says just look for that sign and he baptized him look at me baptizing looking he is convinced of the message he's convinced of his prophecy he is prophesying there's one standing among you oh glory to god i cannot wait on loser's shoes but one day though he's coming he is here oh hallel i know he is here our center for run is coming and no dynamics is here in the form of prophecy hallelujah it is here oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and one day here come jesus hallelujah stand up in line with the rest of them hallelujah he was in line in a special line and he come to one side he was lining up with the rest of them oh glory to god he baptized this one he baptized that one he baptized the other one and then hallelujah and that very moment when that prophet eager i saw the messiah something click oh glory to god that very moment a change hallelujah from the prophet to his prophecy oh behold the lamb of god oh hallelujah two of john disciples when they hear him say it like him behold him they leave john and they follow jesus and guess what john cena disciples oh glory to god and god sent a lasting messenger with elijah anointed all glory to introduce the messiah and elijah's still our disciples they're still playing books and tapes saying no under that they're still our disciples don't stop them leave them alone does he like the disciples but we following jesus the capstone hallelujah the headstone what what what what what the prophet was said to introduce oh give the lord some praises hallelujah my god let's continue now there's some christmas mission will reveal all this mystery is revealed only he promised to his brain hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery oh glory to god hell is against revelation i i don't even have enough words to try to tell you the importance of revelation if people get revelation they run out of the churches eternally churches because recognizing pastors and found the revelation revelation is when god reveals himself to you not when you understand this and understand this when you hear from heaven when a man here from heaven changes him what do you think i'm the elisha why why elijah the prophet couldn't convince elijah to stay in jericho because he had a revelation of what he wanted he wanted a double portion and the sons of the prophets don't have that let me say it again the sons of the prophet they don't have that you know elijah had that and he wanted that hallelujah he knew what he wanted because he had a revelation of what he wanted that's why anything your soul god leaves your soul to believe is yours you can possess whatever god leave your soul to believe that is yours nobody could stop it i don't care if the prophet says stay here i'm not staying here hallelujah i have to cross jordan i have to get my portion a double portion or glory to god from a spirit from a soul from a body hallelujah you've got to get my portion once you see that way you would never allow a man a pastor man a bishop man a apostle man a evangelist man a teacher man no man hinder you from that go there god you think jesus the lord has come not to have a bunch of ministers to die up a bunch of people lieutenant wesley that spirit spirit a man looted where's that conquest congressional message how people tie up to men but jesus the lord himself come down so nobody ain't going to tie up he come to call our bride he said he will not be mishandled he will break up things mash up churches destroy wreck things over to make sure his bride come too clean his bike will pull through no man i got man handled that bride is the wife of the lamb it's the bride of jesus christ it's an old man's wife his wife had made herself ready but no pastor wife hallelujah lamb's wife you say why do you hunger church why do you tears it's the father trying to reveal his certain secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the kids of the world you let some pasta i'm reading you let somebody else get that out of you when dung in your heart you're tasting hungry is god trying to reveal himself to you are you tasting this morning i am twisting how do i know about you but i am tasting this morning oh hallelujah colossians 18 it says he's the head of the body called the church he's the head of the church which is which is his body and he wants the preeminence he's listening close while we are going he's a head of the body his bride's body which is even from him like adam isn't that right now what kelly eve unbelief right what unbelief in god no she had faith in god there is she didn't say there was no god she was not infidel she said she you know i don't believe is good at all no she didn't say that she believed all but one thing oh that's powerful hallelujah when it comes to the written promise eve had a problem she believed in god she believed the word but not every word issue with certain promises it's mine now the bible said i jesus has sent my angel to testify of these things unto you whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word to it no you know normally we just like to look at the one that add in people adding interpretation and add in revelation but you don't understand when you subtract you're taken away when you hinder the people from the holy ghost you're taken away when you're trying to do there's no experience of the holy ghost you're taken away oh glory to god anytime you take you you're cutting all there's no thunders there's no bright revival there is no seventh seal you're actually taken away oh glory to god the bible said seal not the scenes of the prophecy of this book because what was brought to us was a show with a prophecy if this didn't come to us we were going to still be in a baptist church catholic church methodist church going to hell or the tribulation period oh glory to god hallelujah but god rich in mercy oh glory to god rip the veil open and lose the blood lose the spirit and fold you your predestination had found you found the way you are that's why we could praise god that way we could worship he said no all the heartache and sorrow had come because a woman doubted one word of god will he let you back doubt in one word he would be unjust yes if he couldn't spare evil just one word oh god come on come on eve come on no he can do that and if he couldn't spare one word he sent a prophet well you could compromise with this word that's why his friend or no friend ministers association oh no mr association brilliant brethren let this work in me whether i maintain my family or not let christ live in me oh lord is my prayer oh glory again we have one life to live oh glory to god after this morning i tell my wife that last night we have one life i have no bones back in our reincarnation one life to live you better live it live the abundant life live for christ we'll live for your children live for christ don't live for your husband live for christ you'll live for your wife live for christ hallelujah unbelief in the word which is himself the word of life hallelujah moses had a great understanding of god till he met the boone and bush then he was a failure the brilliant bush had what moses lacked the word has got what denomination lacked so moses with all his understanding couldn't really go very far until fire hit him when fire hit moses all that word alone that come into our present tense reality hallelujah in other words he broke into the supernatural oh glory to god and this is the problem it needs a supernatural back in the church and if we don't call for it ask for it preach it it will not be oh glory to god nothing happened by chance the people was crying out and god came down and said i've heard the cries of my people there's people crying out right now the people in conditions right now they're crying all the conditions forcing them to cry out and god will hear their prayer and hear they cry you're people kindness are healing people are calling for deliverance people can't have a breakthrough god going to hear your prayer and you will be delivered you will be healed you will be set free oh glory to god god there's a promise in the word of prophecy i'll ride this trail once more there'll be one more ride oh glory to god that holy ghost going to mount a bride there'll be one more ride there will be another elisha bride oh hallelujah oh my let's go the bright body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery it is impossible for it not to go it is part of god and as the head was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to eden listen this bride have a body this pride belongs to a body and this body have a head he's not a headless body this body have a head i left the head going so the bright going so too if the head go up the bride going up too okay the lord has shout in the house because this bride is part of that body not part of a church come on now part of the body this is what the devil don't want people to see and people like the church and like the pastor and like this and like that i like the inspiration like i like the channel the handling with god is are you in the church triumphant are you in the savior's bride come and be baptized into the body because by one spirit not by one teaching why one spirit not by many mysteries by one spirit we are baptized into one party jew argentina everybody hundred and forty photos nothing gets sealed from the angel from the yeast having the seed of the living god they care walking about i'm a jew i'm a jew i'm a jew no no no no no the holy ghost have to recognize ten thousand from this tribe ten thousand from that tribe how much chosen from whichever tribe twelve thousand hallelujah recognize them and then baptize them give them a holy ghost experience oh glory to god hallelujah this is beyond the torah experience hallelujah this is not a leader in the way that you all are willing you know this is fire the same fire john was prophesying about he shall baptize you easy one go baptize you with the holy ghost on fire or give the lord some praises oh glory to god hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah therefore what the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow because that's the head and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because he's husband and wife hallelujah amen as long as you are pregnanted with the same word which is his body you took his body you becoming him and you took the wood not a creed anytime you're on creed you're in trouble he can't pull that that can't follow him therefore here we go the body cannot recognize he said don't feel this don't you feel this the body cannot recognize any other headship about the word so you can't point me to jessenville you can't appointment in new york you can't point me to london you can't point me to south america south africa or africa or caribbean you can't point it to a man behold the lamb of god this was the prophecy [Applause] therefore the body cannot recognize any other hatred but the word because the head is connected with the body and the hell is the word and the same word one handshape therefore there we go denominations holy fathers and everything else is dead dung i'm quoting it dead dung there is one headship that's christ the body only recognize one thing that's the word that's why the prophet said how do you how do you judge a man by how he stays with the word that is the only way you're going to judge him take the word and put it there some people don't want to be judged that was a bringing injury come true of angel who are mighty angels who meet this angel bring your angel and come all you come and let's examine your testimony by the word of god i don't want to hear you had this experience bring it back the word because the prophet examined everything by the word we recognize one thing the word you love him tonight oh my so the body must follow the head as the wife followed the husband being that adam was not deceived is not right so the body would have to comfort in the day of the lord jesus do you see it the redemption is going on now you see the seals when he was in his military look back they're redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed here we go are you ready and all that in this book would be him for that's the deliver the words of the book that's a believer that's you you are what the words of the book so that's why the words of the book had to be spoken because in the book had your name hallelujah name was sealed oh glory to god the devil couldn't interrupt the unsealing of your name so when we say seal not the saint of the prophecy adam was supposed to call your name he fell the book went up and come down revelation 10 whole glory to god and putting on books and tapes that's why this message had to find you oh glory to god because you are the words of the book oh glory to god when you hear the word priest you are hearing your name you know how yes stories nancy stories you know your imagination on some dream last night you want to hear the word isn't that right she cannot recognize any other headship notion no bishop no nothing she recognizing one handshape jesus christ here we go the word properly vindicated is the headship as isaac will say when you're driving slow you see more things not just the word because you can say the word have a book of the word a plainer tip of the word no the word properly vindicated is the headship the head of the church he is the word headship he is properly identified and vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person take that whole mouthful let me read it again we need to read this one again the word properly vindicated this is not some possibility some message and you say thank you saints i hope this voice was a blessing to you not that story this is not i hope it was a blessing to you this is not that now this is the word properly vindicated here's the word headship he's the properly identified vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing for himself a vindication is the direct proof to the entire body you don't need creeds then denomination has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identification see identifying himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one vindicated headship that is christ the word oh my then united under the headset then he said then our headship is a kingdom aha that changes everything now that changes church and who is your pastor that changes where you go it changes everything because afterwards the headship then you recognize now headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you then the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to our kingdom and the kingdom here we go is the word of god made spirit and life in your own life bringing to pass is that stop every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and god was won that is the kingdom within you what is that the word made spirit and life in your life bringing to pass every promise promise for this day oh i feel like a run through a troop right now oh glory to god that's why you said when you're here they say come here look at here look at here we have the revolution here there's the only place have it here there's the next place happened here he said whatever you know the kingdom is written in you anytime you decide to identify a man-made structure kingdom sometimes on some tenth covenant forget it the kingdom is where within you and the kingdom is what the word turn the spirit in like what's the secret the word is in the bribe so the word after we poured into you placed into you preaching to you seated into you but then there comes an hour when that word becomes spirit and life in your life then you belong to a kingdom hallelujah isn't that right and his body will do the works that he promised like in mark 16 and watch don't to the age of luther wesley has begun to raise up to its power hallelujah let me read it again the word that was done to the age of luther wesley has begun to raise up to its power they begin to move let it move a little more and now it's coming up to identification so sometimes in time it have to change from what the prophet to the prophet's prophecy when you begin to see it coming alive or you begin to see it being fulfilled so listen to this important part now now to the life in the body is a vindication of the rapture is at hand so we can't say rapture coming soon and there's no life life have to come to the bright body and when you see the evidence of that life with some time ago we preach about the appearing of the lord it will be a vindication that the rapture is at hand here is it's when you see the headship and the body becoming one continue and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about ready to receive to the headship so first revelation teaching inspiration but then when they switch over and begin to come into manifestation then you know we're heading up to receive the headship so we can't get around it no mini second got it wrong i think it was mystery how much revelation new name this name or whatever name they have whatever whatever they have they still have to come back to the part that it has to be manifested oh go away to god you have to walk on your house and devils have to scatter and head through the windows head to the corners as you walk inside the deer the enforcer oh god don't let me go there the enforcer you see that yet the message will i see that the enforcer going home with you oh give the lord a shout right now we talking we prophesy and we saying we plead and we anoint him but when they're all gonna come when the enforcer gonna be walking with you whatever you say it have to happen it's got to come to pass all glory to god because the fire is there to charge every word that's coming out your mouth oh glory to god come here cornelius was a predestinated seed god arranged a connection between peter and cornelius corneas couldn't miss it if we try hallelujah peter didn't understand what he was getting into but he was just speaking the word thinking there's words coming out like that but while periods speak these words holy ghost the enforcer hallelujah come and baptize cornelius with the fire oh glory to god what mystery he knew hallelujah what kind of revelation in you how much bible teachings he got fire fire fire the same god that comes among sinai come down in in carnival's heart oh hallelujah oh my oh glory to god i wouldn't stop preaching that sorry hallelujah i can't help it i'm not going to stop preaching that moses met a real thing moses didn't read a book and a scroll and sit down there and study for no no moses meets a thing like that paul only went into the scrolls after pillar fire lick him down knock him down after he gave fire so paul went and studied oh glory to god under that fire experience hallelujah are they gonna fire in front or you can fire behind moses had to study first and fire after paul had fire first and study after anyway anyhow fire oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god i hope you shouted in your house oh glory to god you're in fire inside your house all the argument goes stop all the fuss ain't gonna stop all the fools ain't gonna stop hurry to god amen hallelujah hallelujah see what i mean he has begun to give life to his body why the one that he has redeemed the military work is done listen this is this is prophecy he is bringing his life to the body in a vindication for the rapture or give the lord a shout he oh glory to god here what did the prophet say he is the dynamic did you get that church what's our man he christ is the dynamics oh glory to god so he bringing life no wonder why his thing is quarter of this evil age he said no other life could work in her this bride no and she's watching for her life to manifest the word no other life could work in her you can't put loot a life you know where's your life enough you can't charge your up and mock and and tomorrow engine with a pentecostal life no other life but charity life no other lives but dynamics no other life but the capstone you talk about the devil the devil is building a hybrid church hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word you know you place that knowledge instead of the word you see the word is what the prophet brought as prophecy as the word knowledge is could be interpretation men's idea something come to them they open up this way but what we're dealing with now is the word itself you see i had a revelation that a long time that the word coming out the prophet saw is god that is why i try to echo and say back what the tapes say by inspiration and revelation we have our understanding everything is a seed oh glory hallelujah a while before coming out here to preach it struck me that this mighty angel the one with the swept back wings the one that comes in around ten he is the chief messenger he is the chief of the seven earthly angels that man who command one with the amen with the rainbow over his head nice christ and christ know what the prophets say oh give the lord a shout in the house did you get that christ he knows the prophecy from the prophet because he is the one who uttered it oh give the lord a shout or he will vindicate hallelujah what the prophet said oh i feel that we have a show with a prophecy to say thank you lord he said watch hybrid knowledge instead of the word by intellectual men instead of born again men building an intellectual kingdom that will outshine christ little bitty flock what is it that what what is that fallen angels the bible said it was false angels who listen to lucifer instead of christ isn't that right now listen close these are not my words son fallen angels what kind of angels luther wesley his name in it luther wesley catholic pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the ancients did and fell into organizations that is what he called fallen angels so fallen angels gave birth to organizations and the reading bible and quoting seals oh harlow oh glory to god he said organize a great economical associated ministers to make an immigration to the peace as the bible said and building a christian economy that will close the doors of this church and others like it see lucifer at his work and i am trying to bring you the truthful revelation or a mystery of god and what was that truthful revelation number one to reveal himself god was too mysterious so he had issues with that he said he had to reveal himself yeah they come down in a special then the number two is i have the preeminences number three to go back to eden we can't go back to eating with all the preeminences because he didn't need the same image and likeness to have dominion over so god had to bring back a revelation of the image and likeness what adam had to return us back to eden so that is where the prophet took the image from second peter 147 and throw it in a pyramid and say that is the secret that enoch had how he left the earth his mechanics became dynamics and god took him or give the lord a shout and that same bride going to connect back with that statue of a perfect man that same image and he said this being when it's completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's going in a rapture not a man preaching mysteries this being when it's completed oh glory to god i keep saying over and over adoption is not based upon a man's sermon is based upon a man's behavior oh glory to god after we preach after we teach after we do what we do god see how we live oh give the lord some praises that had changed for nobody what we need is thousands of live voices the thunder of god in sweetness and humility oh hallelujah whereas he was the man of god but what followed him fallen just got into it so waiting happened this message it's in the prophet left bunch of fallen ninjas fall into it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah wait anybody go to fight with them we had to fight with them hallelujah a fallen angel what was it creative beings of god that fell for looting for wisdom fell for lucifer's wisdom fallen angels come in took it over made denominations out of it that's the reason the revelation the seventh seal had to be unfolded and there is only one thing that happened there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it oh glory to god when i'm finished nothing is supposed to follow that because this is the end this is where it has no impersonation to it satan do all the impersonation all the acting but when you come to face this bride there'll be no impersonation whatsoever oh glory to god the final showdown he said the fruit is at the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she is ripening the christ like fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in them hope you see it oh praise god here's lucifer at his job again remember the antichrist is not communism the antichrist is so close like the real thing they see the very elect if possible lucifer again breaking god's unity in man by his limiting the word of god to human reasoning that's why i'm looking for the power of god to strike the church i'm looking for the holy ghost to pour it right in your home here's why because the holy ghost is poured out on individuals you don't even have to be in church to receive the holy ghost oh get the lord and shout where you are hallelujah right now because the holy ghost is poured out on individuals thank you lord jesus hallelujah lucifer comes in kindness and breaks the unity of god to man just like he did in eden by great temptations of promises of self power and exaltation let me do that again lucifer brings great temptations of self-power and exaltations why you might become a bishop if you stay with us you might even be five-fold dear faithful you may come a district presbyter but brother ram says what's false promises to men to receive power outside the word hala you receive power when the holy ghost come upon you not when you become a bishop or a titan or whatever it is that's lucifer on his job again so office and post is irrelevant power comes by the holy ghost be it you are elder deacon trusty i don't care what you are usher it doesn't matter you still need holy ghost power you still need holy ghost to overcome you still need power to live power to pray power to say i forgive you hallelujah power to forgive that is why the holy ghost was given for oh glory to god power to get a revival in your soul hallelujah do you believe that lucifer coming cunning like he did then by temptations false promises of power outside and apart from the word oh praise god hallelujah he said well glory to god i've seen all kind of fleshly manifestation that scanner but i am talking about the headship of christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question he said glory amen we have the answer to the devil's question christ is risen and paid the price and he is risen the devil can't stand it and that's the reason these economical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're coming into what they're doing now that's the reason he's howling the way he is his scheme has been uncovered by the risen resurrected christ and the headship over his body oh glory to god you think the devil don't know when power works start to move and manifest itself just think about it now holy ghost fire and power fell in the upper room and that didn't move the devil the devil thought they were just excited he just thought it was emotional here even though them guys get adopted and pour all over them the quickening power they're speaking in tongues and they're staggering like junkling up in the upper room and the devil do not have a clue what's happening inside of there oh glory to god jesus already prophesy receive the holy ghost behold i send the promise of my father upon you showed a prophecy but tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be do it perform on high when power struck them here satan could not interpret what happened hallelujah he went back and sleep but when peter oh god raised that man and says silvan gold have i none he said no no no no no we have to stop this thing oh glory to god you think that the you think the devil goes stopping with books and tapes and playing ram tapes the devil have nothing that will find me wasting time devil laughing actually he and this thing you're healing this plane tape thing he in church thing he ain't passed the thing devil and moving no pressure coming down yet you know no press nothing happened we will present you for time the ways and you have the church already in coldness we could press you for in the church dead and cold and formal devils have visions already the plain tapes the plain books the preaching what teach them whatever it is but the church dead they will say i have them they stoned that i'm erupting for them that means tribulation says they miss my sins but when the power begins to move he said when the church get the desirement of the two spirits working and know and withstand the antichrist spirit when the power began to move the devil will say stop that there even something happening when something began to move when the paul began to move we had 50 years of teaching preaching mighty men's all over the world mighty apostles mighty prophets mighty pastors mighty teachers mighty evangelists devil move nothing hallelujah devil encouraging movement hallelujah what he not encouraging his power and to access power you have to access this life to access power you have to access character to access power you have to access adoption to accept power you have to accept access discipline or give the lord a shout to access power you have to access place of trying which is not preached much hallelujah you took my power now not blessings many ministries are blessed i know my blessings i don't want church blessed i know my blessing i don't want power when the paul struck the prophet he was numb for days he was packed in a corn i'm not talking about blessing i'm talking about power we see power yet i haven't seen it yet i know it's coming it's shaking me up because i know it's coming i want to be ready i want to be prepared oh glory because i know it's not not me man speaking it will be god himself speaking and the confirmed is god speaking it will be vindicated by god himself oh glory to god by the miraculous power of the living god being made manifest among god's people oh glory to god it will mean it will be quiet you know oh glory to god be a lot of noise oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus let me say it again he said that's the reason the devil howling his scheme has been uncovered by what by courts no by the risen resurrected christ in the headship over the body that's why william brown could stand a platform and said you know what i'm waiting on i don't know if you'll come but i'm waiting here oh glory to god i'm always saying he is here who is here hallelujah that resurrection crisis here is i take every spirit under my control because he's god's agent hallelujah he's got ambassador hallelujah he's qualified to do that i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god and then people can see the power of god working through a man oh glory to god they're not talking no that's a living witness they are living manifestation bringing the supernatural into being oh glory to god blessing cancer busting humor busting all kinds of sins and just licking them out hallelujah devils on the run no deceit no deceiver could come before him oh glory to god hallelujah you think that they're coming back that is coming back oh give the lord a shout is he going to walk in the church that sin can't even stay in it hallelujah then he said you think i'm beside myself i am not we have got the devil's answer not me that liveth but christ the word that living in me it's not my idea it's his power it's not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here here it is we got his answer christ is risen and paid the price for redemption what god is christ manifested he give the flesh and blood that in the blood might have life and the flesh might be redeemed and that god in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as we did in that day he said well whoa glory then he said we stand justified in the presence of god and i always say that i need a revelation to strike the bride revelation of justification hallelujah never did it we stand justified as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you never find the stain of the ink no more it went somewhere it never come back again when a man is fully redeemed i like these words allah the terminology when a man is fully redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished it is gone it is dropped into the ink of the blood of jesus never to remember god forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of god in the presence of god amen and amen now are we the sons of god not we will be we are redeemed we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god proves himself to his promises today he said the headship is here christ the risen lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he was manifesting himself dear is the devil's answer there is the devil's answer not books not quotes not tapes not ministries not five folds no that that the antenna devil devil tap among five also so-called hallelujah the devil answer is when christ is resurrected among the people and one time he said and then you're worshiping the living christ when them thunders begin to come forth he said then you're worshiping the living christ him moving in and out among you oh give the lord a shout all glory to god he said there will be a church with jesus walking in it the shout and the king will be in the camp oh give the lord a shout today hallelujah the shout of the king hallelujah not some man not some pastor the shout of the king will be in the camp oh hallelujah hallelujah he said what is it not them people the headship and the body have become one unit it is god manifesting himself in his people that's the reason the husband and wife are no longer tween they are one god in this church is one christ in you god's great revelation glory to god even behind his name his name of jesus the anointed the reason he's called jesus he is the anointed it's the anointed body of christ proven that christ manifested in his body just like his body did proven manifested god like the body did and that body redeemed every of this these bodies amen we stand justified in christ before him because he cannot pass judgment he already judged that body so christ's body was judged is that right at calvary he was judged and we the bride was in that body so he can't come and judge us we are free from all condemnation therefore there is no more condemnation to them who are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit oh glories as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god god has not given us the spirit of fear but god has given us the spirit of adoption wherever we call our pastor no have a father or give the lord a shout you know i have a pastor out of five fool it doesn't have that it have our father or give the lord a shout not have a bishop now i have a message pope we don't have that it glory to god

only world oh glory to god if god call me oh god call me home hallelujah going oh glory to god hallelujah so this man john anointed with elijah's spirit came out of the wilderness in that right a wild man he said and then afterwards he said there a few weeks after that that man was so positive in his message so he was preaching for a while and after a while mountain hit him strike him he said there's one standing among you all the time he wasn't preaching that message that title that that morning messi was one stand among you that that silver untitled was there was one standing among you there was one standing among you said the prophecy whose shoes are not he said he could baptize you with holy ghost on fire say think i i'm something he said i don't know [Music] there's one standing among you who should not worthy he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire as i have baptized with water look at the comparison so how come you want to explain the way the holy ghost john was baptizing water dip so how you get back from the holy ghost god take care and dip when you're dipping the spirit you must come up with spirit save the dependent water it'll get wet so how are you going to dip in this plate and you'll have an experience same he will baptize with the holy ghost as i have baptized with water so instead of water now what i am doing fire coming for you one day an ordinary young man about 30 years old walked down or baptized and when this man come there was such an attraction by the prophet the prophet act strange that day the congregation couldn't help but watching the action of that prophet while he was debating with the priests he said behold malachi he said behold i said am i messing with my face don't you know this fulfilled prophecy and this is where i get the inspiration from today and about that time the prophet turned and said behold here comes the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction and this is where i get it from it changed from the prophet to his prophecy now notice what comes to pass here come an ordinary man known to no one carpenter's son come walking out of the water and when john the great prophet said i have need to be baptized of thee why comes out to me he says suffer that to be so but as a prophet and the word it behooves us to fulfill righteousness so he understood the sacrifice had to be washed before presented and he baptized him and there's another attraction take place when he went out of the water the prophet this prophet who had been so loyal to declare this age and time he looked up he saw the heavens open and he saw the spirit of god like a dove descending upon him and a voice said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased god here we go was vindicating a prophet's message what was attracting the attention at the jordan at the jordan he was vindicating a prophet's message isn't that right oh glory to god so the prophecy that was released by this end time prophet messenger what was it it was jesus christ it was charity and that's why it changed from the prophet to his prophecy it changed the seven seals isn't that right even jesus christ because the prophet said those seals are christ all the sins are jesus christ he is those seals isn't that right so the prophecy that the prophet brought to us hallelujah glory to god first the shout and then the voice and then the trump isn't that right no more men angels isn't that right after the prophet they find a shout what will it define the voice not the archangel the voice of the archangel comes down upon a bride the secret it is the words and the bride isn't that right and she has what the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word at one time the prophet said i wish i had the voice of an archangel to bring it to a place where you could see it so the voice of the archangels bring clarity to the word to the vision to god's people isn't that right isn't that right so therefore this chief messenger this voice this archangel this this mighty angel is what the prophet came to introduce oh glory to god because brother branagh he was the eyes and next is what the intelligence which is the mind of christ which is christ himself to come upon a bride she said and she has the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word not to know the word what he wants done with the word not done with his word and she do it in his name she does it in his name what why what what she has the intelligence the mind of christ hallelujah praise god so we have to see evidence of christ having rain over his people we have to see evidence of his rulership hallelujah of his given directions of him of his authority coming back among the people then you know is that a man speaking that a man trying something is christ reigning and ruling giving supernatural instructions hallelujah giving guidance oh glory to god when joshua want to take jericho trying to figure it out the angel came oh hallelujah to give him what instructions hallelujah the captain of the horse that was the chief that appeared to joshua then joshua could tell the people hallelujah do this do that walk around do this give him instructions but he was under another instructor oh give the lord some praises hallelujah thank you lord jesus she has thus here the lord oh she keeps still oh my let's continue this is something i love he said this is the last morning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations has been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of that gigantic pills are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands sophie and glorious the heavens being heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet of a beauty tells a story of amazing grace and jesus love she is a city prepared this beautiful prepared people thank you lord a city prepared for a prepared people hallelujah she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will strung the streets with joy yes it is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over but thank god at this moment this age is not over he's yet crying his cry is not only in the spiritual heirs of men by his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land once more god revealed the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the loudest age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefits effect of that prophet's ministry and they will hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day when you take that day and people take that those are here could be part of the bride you can't take it so it have fine writings under that that is a general statement hallelujah to be part of that bride that'll be part of the body oh glory to god not just hear but obey what the prophet said is that right watch and who are mentioned in revelation 2017 the spirits and the bright side come the corner wheat bride wheat that fell into the ground at nicer has come back to original wood grain again yes listen to that authenticated prophet of god who appears in his last age what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among us now and be separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we don't know it won't be long for this is the last age oh glory to god there are so many voices in the earth today that it's absolutely a hard thing to hear the voice of god because here's why it deadens the voice of the supernatural so when people are the creeds and say you have to believe it this way and that way and they have no god behind their creeds you know there's a problem let me say it again they have their creeds they have the doctrines and the teachings and they're saying you have to believe it this way or that way or you're out of it and they have no god behind the creeds you know these problems hallelujah there are so many voices in here today it's absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual in the message we talk about them and in their intellectual conditions they shake nations they are not overnight people but they shake nations bringing great organization flowery campaign and a person could be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them how these things that go on and prosper and their voices that raise up that do these things and cause the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of god and the voice of god is see how will we know is the voice of god because mark voice of god in it or if i'm voice of god recording that we know or mark our book more spoken word that's not how we know the voice of god not today that wasn't brother branham time okay but how do we know it today he said what now today how we know is the voice of god he said because today then it wasn't a vindicated prophet right william branham but today how do we know it's the voice of god because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word oh glory to god in other words it's the prophet prophecy being made manifest that is how we know it's the voice of god it's not playing back brother brown tapes no no no it's a manifestation of what is on the tapes or give the lord a shout in other words we have to be able to say this is that that the prophet william random speak of oh glory to god that is the identification oh glory to god the fulfillment of the prophet's prophecy he said today let me read it again how do we know is the voice of god because then it wasn't a vindicated prophet which is himself now today how do we know the voice of god because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word this is god's prophet and a true voice of god only brings back that real living supernatural god with a supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word oh glory to god all goes together as a package then we know it's the voice of god oh my can we take some more hallelujah hallelujah with every prophecy there's a process prophecy doesn't just happen hallelujah when when when when the prophet elijah told the people in that bible story that barajas spoke about this he said tomorrow it will be sofa shekel the more you'll have food that have a way to fulfill that is just happening just like that it has four men four who was having a conference as to what to do at that very hour hallelujah and they decide they was controlling things you know they decide if we stay here let's figure this thing out let's let's work on this thing we we we out here so long if we stay here we have no food out there but has that masterfully brought out it wasn't the leprosy there was something about dinner there wasn't concern about dying of leprosy that concept was dynasty they gotta do it's a good meal so they said we stay here we die we goose cook we finish right here if we go back they starving inside not only that they don't want them inside so we could go back inside but if we go to the enemy camp go to the syrian maybe 50 50. hallelujah they might kill us they might feed us and when they say let's move show god calls but i'm saying you had to do something for something to happen you take a rock and chew it up in the air oh glory to god hallelujah and when he tried up in the air something happened don't come a whirlwind when they move god caused a rumbling to hit that nick it was so terrible then fellas leave the horses and run around they run drop everything and run it was time to take off god god about to make a mighty mighty move in 24 hours i love that i like her that's my message of preaching in 24 hours a mighty move of god mighty miracle of god mighty working of god hallelujah so these men was the process by which the prophets of elisha was being fulfilled so let's just get one or two and i'll show you what i mean with every prophecy there's a process to get to that prophecy so when herod this in matthew 2 when herrera the king had heard these things he was troubled all jerusalem with him i skipped them and they said when he and and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribe of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born all and fellas so backstage them three wise men come and shake up the whole jerusalem when he asks them now and they tell him but in bethlehem of judea for this is written by the prophet so they quote in scripture the opening scrolls now don't beat them in the land of judah at not released among the prisoners of judah although he shall come for the governor so now can hear it know that that's the prophecy isn't that right but here the process luke 2 he came to pass in those days that they went to the decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxi was made in sarinas was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone to his own city and joseph also from galilee out of the city of nazareth and judea under the city of david which is called bethlehem to be taxed with mary his exposed wife being great to a child so that was the process decree for taxation force joseph and mary to get into position to fulfill prophecy or give the lord a shout god going to force the issue to make sure we're in position to fulfill the prophecy my my my hallelujah glory to god the prophecy saint john 20 then jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father sent me even so center you and when he said this he breathed on them he said receiving the holy ghost hallelujah that's the prophecy here the process luke 24 that was john 20 luke 24 and behold i sent the promise of my father upon you but ty in the seat of jerusalem until they endured apart from on high and he led them as fast to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and tied up in heaven and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continuing the temple praising and blessing god so that is he possessed to get to the prophecy of receiving the holy ghost the heart was to be praising and blessing god they see him go they know he went up they saw jesus go they ain't crying for jesus and begin with jesus say he says i don't go the comforter will not come that has stayed here and begin to worship and praise dear god hallelujah praise god so god is not just concerned about you getting to the finish line but not but how you get there because there are no shortcuts you can't be staying home and looking for a job they know the process of getting that job dropping flying to the roof dub not coming to your window nobody lifting up the roof and dropping down a job for you isn't that right you can't expect to pass on exams if you're not studying for it it is the process that is the important part hallelujah praised god success could come and breakthrough could come if you're prepared to go through the process same thing apply to revival and healing and deliverance and so forth hallelujah praised god so you got to pray napoleon was defeated because he didn't play by the rules he got disqualified and if the rules of the game in this place is a man must be born again to enter the fellowship of the christ in his church we might be the greatest denomination on earth but if we haven't played by the rules we'll be disqualified at the end we have got to come straight with god rules it isn't our rules it is his rules oh my we are running the race according to the rules oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah but abraham says if we fail to play by the rules of the game right god will disqualify us and raise up these stones and so forth and god wants the game played right we must do it so it doesn't make any difference how much we feel like we're progressing on until we get back to the rule of the game oh my hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus he said if god has given you a talent stay with that talent no matter what you try to do if that talent isn't operated no matter how great it is if it isn't operated according to the rules you are disqualified in a race isn't that right so that means a little more than being talented or gifted you have to operate by the rules oh hallelujah anyone you know in the olympics or any other athletic exercises no matter or if you arrive first in the race if you haven't played the game according to the rules you are disqualified and that's the way it is with human life you can't play the rules of the game of life wrong and expect to win you've got to play it according to god's word and his purpose oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus praise god hallelujah so whether we are president whether we are governor or minister what church should belong to what denomination the rules of the game has to be kept we must run it fear we must play it by the rules we must preach the word we must do it willingly and here we are tonight in the shadows of the coming of the son of god we find a church in an anemic condition we ought to be great here we go we ought to be strong mighty wires of the faith that was shake a nation god give it to us we should just receive it not weak not anemic but we ought to be strong so much i will shake the nation oh my he came us sinners that we might become his righteousness oh my hallelujah praise god he said no not he that starts is he that finishes there are no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race no shortcuts you must come the way the scripture said he said you come except you die to yourself and be born of the spirit of god you're lost oh my hallelujah oh my hitting the home stretch here praise the lord thank you jesus thank you jesus except you die to yourself oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord so he said it this way there were many men raised up they have been for hundreds of years they had no prophet and then john came isn't that right and when he here we freeze this now and then when he come on the scene to prove that he was that ephesians made manifest that's what we're gonna call christ christ says what that ephesians made manifest john announced it but jesus was that he was the word manifested himself oh glory to god thank you lord so as john was sent to wine of the old testament and to bring forth the introduction of christ a message will wind up the loose ends and will introduce the messiah just before his coming the message in the last days so wait a minute but the banner was the introduced messiah yes who is the messiah luke 17 30 this sort of man oh my just think now the mighty angel swore the angel come from heaven the seven angels of the seven church ages earthly messengers but this angel all the messages finished the seven angels wind up the whole thing and this angel comes not he isn't a man from the earth as the messenger of the church ages that's finished but this angel brings the next announcement that israeli messenger he comes from heaven a rainbow over his head and that was christ the christ was the chief messenger so he was the boss that come down after the messengers that's the seven messenger boss that's the mighty angel that is christ oh my so what john said he said he must increase and i must increase this is about right now notice john immediately said he must increase and i must decrease and he presented truth the church to christ he presented the church to what to christ and we are told in last days that it will repeat again there's going to be a message come forth that will introduce the messiah to the people not faithful to the people no the messiah to the people isn't that right and it will be in such a way that they will stand down founded so william branham came with the elijah spirit to introduce you to christ hallelujah so some point in time we have to come back to christ because that is the prophet's prophecy oh glory to god behold the lamb of god oh thank you jesus hallelujah so what he said enoch bill the pyramid symbol stands as a symbol go into the prophet's chamber watch them seven steps where did the guard meet a challenge to bring the comma into the presence of the king at the top of the steps their shows we have got to come again with that same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we have got to come up to a place again here we go there's something that will introduce the messiah and then he dropped this bomb here how will they know the messiah the people believing him know it unless they are constantly in the word to know what he is so you have to be in the word to know who the messiah is what the messiah is he's not some man there's a capstone the capstone revelation of jesus christ capital manifestation of jesus christ so he winds up all the loose ends you talk about the seven angels if we know the book of redemption has proved that but will not be understood and the mysteries come down from god as the word of god and reveal the re-revelation of god now notice when the seas are broke the mystery revealed dunk on the angel the messenger christ set in his foot upon the land upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember here we go here we go the seven inches on earth at the time of this coming the seven angels on the earth at the time of this couple so christ came down to the prophet he took the prophet of the earth alas is already come if you see me go he's gone but christ the holy spirit the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel on the earth fixing things are wrong christ they're gone supernatural they're gone power going you probably say when i am gone healing is not gone because he boosted it prove that he's the same yesterday then forever let me say that again bro when i'm gone healing isn't gone supernatural has gone who dear oh out the power of god what about tongues interpreting tongues you're speaking dogs are pentecostal who said that it's not pentecost our own tongues we own that they spot anybody it's not pentecostal only sailment and prophecy and wisdom we own that that's ours that's the bright body hallelujah every gift will be back in the church oh glory to god hallelujah because jesus christ is the same and we're going to preach that hebrews 13 8 he has to be the same evil yesterday he can't heal yesterday and he having problem to heal today something wrong with us not him he's the same yesterday he can't change his behavior he can't change his attitude he can't change his healing power he catches his delivering power he can't change his way making power he could flip things around 24 hours as john was giving his message the same time that messiah come in the days john knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him we realized according to malachi 4 there has become one with elijah to whom the word of the lord can come to he is the revealed by the holy spirit all the mysteries of god and restore the faith of the church back to the fate of the apostles like the fathers oh my hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord here is the angel on the earth another angel mighty messenger come down and see this angel was the italy angel but one come down with a rainbow isn't that right so therefore that mighty angel knows all the words spoken from that prophet so he knows the prophet's prophecy so hika say the angel you know you know what prophet could you imagine what you trying to explain to the mighty angel what do you prophecy no think about it now could you imagine somebody trying to explain to the mighty angel what the prophet said and the feeling let them see this and when the prophet moves someone goes and moves from muslim oh glory to god hallelujah praise god russia i'm almost on home stretch here now russia they're looking for a man who conquered space all i'm saying is they give a messiah what about the church what kind of messiah that jesus looking for today what kind of messiah the church has cried the loudest what are we hollering about a messiah what are we hollering revival in our time baptist and back to the other what are they looking for what do you want question what does the church want anyhow we already got it god gave it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the bible we see it everywhere through the bible anointed once come on and make the word live again you know what the anointed word is right the anointed word is messiah almost finished not the one coming would live again right in the aura for that hour we have got the messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god the word remains god the same yesterday today and forever we know what is supposed to take place in this day we are wanting a messiah and god give us the messiah his promised word for this day i hope the people see that not books and tapes they're not the messiah the messiah is what is promised he says seven thunder is going to gather the right together that's a promise seven thunderbirds should about how to appear that's a promise isn't that right spread to them seven up to the voices of that group that's the promise isn't that right there'll be a super church or super race that's the promise hallelujah when the baptismally goes is made manifest outside the nomination that's a promise all these things are promises hallelujah when the power of this church rises that's a promise to pull that's a promise all these are promises that was prophesied isn't that right so we award the messiah now hear this bomb and god give us the messiah his promised buddha did he it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again yes sir it's the real messiah it's the word of god oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that today and the only place that could not strike is in the word there's only one place that spiritual that cannot strike that's the word death can't strike the word because it's the word of the living god he said the confirmation of his word always when the word is confirmed that is god speaking in his word look how he plays that he's not talking about text he's not talking about explanation and revelation he says when the confirmation of his word always when the word is confirmed that is god speaking in his word making himself visible that you can see that is god confirming his word making himself what say visible visible that you can see and the word was invisible he said now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word becomes visible but here more and through his sacrificial death at calvary and his resurrection he positionally places church in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual and make the word visible i wish my church could get that oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah the word becoming flesh makes the word that was invisible visible oh my hallelujah thank you lord the greeks said we will see jesus and then jesus promised to be in his church doing the same thing that he did then until he ate him now he said a little while the world seeing me no more well then how would we see him question answer by the prophet we will have to see his spirit not how will we hear him how will we see him we have to see his spirit if he's in us then that spirit would have to do the same thing that he did then or it wouldn't be the same spirit we're not talking about talk preaching teaching we're talking about the same spirit and then he went to say i am the vine here the branches and if the branch is in the vine the branch will bear the same kind of fruit the vine produces so we don't have to talk to talk and so paul for here and how great revelation we have we're not mountain and we see a light we don't talk don't tell talk it will speak for itself no boasting no putnam flag i am this and i am that and nobody else have it honey and whatnot you know i'll tell my wife about the amongst the false prophets that have you have a ton look jesus really say you choose to many foreign point nine and a half percent of them as liars you watching them prophesy this year by a year plentiful and how much crusade how many people in stadiums and how much this and that all them fun to be lies and i get caught up in the lord through them and the lord showed them that that and showed all them things wrong lying on god god never spoke to them never spoke to the lying spirits and their big ministries and and thousands of people following them still sending money and still backing them and what that liars think about it now lying man if his bible there's a stone you know it's keep a stone just just heaps just heaps all over america all over every time they come back to the lion god you can't say dust salon god they talk to you you don't lie on god that's why children comfort are not just truth by letter or truth by just man speaking but vindicated truth he's a desire truth from the in one part has taken my time and what's on the inside is connected to what on the outside is a harmony that is there oh glory to god that way you can say this is my son i'm pleased let me finish here oh glory to god he said if that he said watch that first vine branch come out of the vine was a pentecostal branch watch with visions powers healings but in the holy spirit great signs and wonders the next branch would have to be the same kind of branch oh glory to god hallelujah i know someone long dressed and brothers were entire and and sisters they point no grease in their hair and all kind of flimsy kind of things we're not talking about that and the message you know i mean you're looking messages they're not looking messages this is this is your reproduction of the original green goddess in a prophet doesn't look like weenie message he sent a perfect turn on us back to the face of the fathers the same thing that those guys had because only because it wasn't the time yet they didn't go into adoption they're going to the rapture they fell into the ground but we have a promise of going to that rapture oh glory to god musician come on please hallelujah glory to god thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you jesus thank you jesus blessed be the name of the lord so before elisha could get that double portion elijah made a statement if you see me go you have to know i am gone you have to know no man coming back after between me and no no money coming the prophet gone there's no prophet there's no promise of a man coming there's no prophet on behalf there's no malachi 4 and a half there's no behold like elijah and somebody else i don't have that god was very specific behold i said elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fate of the fathers and if he already come and mean his job is finished it is over if it comes to elohim that came down to abraham type in the bride he said i will return as a d according to the time of life and when that promise was given a man wasn't coming in between it was the power of god one more jesus when he was taken up from them they were him by by they saw him taken up and they returned to jerusalem with great joy all glory to god with joy that's what lacking in the message now the great joy hallelujah they're struggling they're fighting they're too long people tired and weary but they need to get the great joy the joy of the prophet's prophecy the joy of being called of god this last hour of joy oh glory to god the joy of seeing what prophets and sages long to see to see it right unfolding from their very eyes hallelujah the joy of seeing the fulfillment of your word america is finished final world dominating power finish oh glory to god look what they have today hallelujah utter disaster hallelujah is just downhill donghyu write down oh glory to god the bombs ready to loose hallelujah the nuclear bombs ready to strike rome ready to strike other places right just strike america oh praise god the prophet talked about the invasion of america talk about russian soldiers and everything else prophecy hanging over america already oh the world is coming to a close hallelujah the billions and billions and billions of dollars lost by all this fine coronavirus from the world internationally ruin the whole economic system they will be forced to bring on a new economic system that will set up the b system and through that b system they will form the marking of the beast oh glory to god but the system itself have to change and this will force everything to change and we ourselves have to change we have to be coming to form into the word image oh glory to god the prophet building material and people are still talking about building material they still talk about galvanize and wood and kung and and sand and cement they're believable they're talking about in this book have galvanized in this book have sam in this book have wood in this book have steel what we have done we take from the steel from here the governors from here and put it together as a prophetic vision that we could see where we're supposed to be at i am leaving john disciples john harvey's disciples but john said behold the lamb of god hallelujah it has changed from the prophet to the prophecy we are in the prophecy we are walking in the vision to fulfill this very word it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness oh glory to god so when jesus was taken up those disciples knew that jesus came back oh god he had to come back no he wasn't talking about they saw him go they went in the upper room they were waiting for their promise they know god they promised me the holy ghost he promised me to deliver my wife did i promise deliver my family he promised to heal me you promised to be a healer and be living in last days and i am resting on your promise oh glory to god oh my i'm gonna close wow the believers is commanded by the author to read and believe every word of it not just part of it one word to disbelieve it might as well quit trying until you believe the word every word is absolutely a part of almighty god is that right it's the complete body of jesus christ and in christ being male the groom the bride is represented in him also and these two are one and the true believers it is in this word who accept it and believe it and here we go with patience wait for its prophesied promises wait with what with patience every one of them to be manifested in this age every believer has watched it everybody have been on toes watching is the one that has been revealed to here we go and this is not extract from uh revision 310 because otherwise kept the word of my patience i will also keep these from the all temptation we shall come upon all the world to try them to dwell upon the earth what does he mean by the word of my patience hebrews 6 13 says for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he way by himself saying surely he had blessed him blessed so after you're patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word of god which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of abraham he endured i seen him who was invisible he was patient and then the word was finally fulfilled this is the way god teaches his people patience why if he fulfill his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would come more and more impatient with life let me show you how this is the truth hebrews 11 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac that he might have received the promises offered up his only begotten son there it is abraham was tried after he received the word of promise most think that as soon as they pray in jesus name over the good promises of god that there should be not be a trial but here it says that abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist 105 psalms 105 19 until the time his word came talk about joseph the word of the lord tried him god give us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life may god help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of these six aged learned patients we read the history of the lives of these great christians what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we all but overcome our over impatience and haste but as an every age people let men put their own interpretation to the word and cause them to be blinded to the event that happened the mission god confirmed his prophesied word then it's the believers watch the believers watch for the fulfillment of what the prophet said and that is the identification that they are god's prophets oh my the people are watching for some little outlet some bypass some shortcut but there are no shortcuts in the word of god there's one pattern and you must cut yourself to fit that pattern let's try to cut the pattern to fit you everybody must do that that's the only way the believers wait for the word to be confirmed so john prophecy was vindicated in god's order the word of the lord comes to the prophet jesus was the word john was prophesying of the coming of the word for fulfillment and jesus the word came to the water and watch when a man
