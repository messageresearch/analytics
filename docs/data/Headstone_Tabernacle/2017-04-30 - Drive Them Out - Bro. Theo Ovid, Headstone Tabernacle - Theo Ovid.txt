step straight amen amen amen hallelujah God is in control amen so we are coming back from a mighty Revival in Ivory Coast and we were there last year and this year was even greater than last year and I was saying to somebody you know it becomes very difficult because every convention every service you see this is the greatest convention and every time you say it people like but you said that the last time but this convention was the greatest convention that we have ever been in it started off in a way I've never seen where the con opened up the convention and from the moment he started it was just fire the anointing the place was packed out and he preached a masterpiece and after he spoke Friday morning I came Friday night and then brother Raymond Thompson was Saturday morning and then brother over came Saturday night and then brother Olu spoken about the country and by the end of the service we couldn't even have a prayer line because the convention the place was shaken it was about 2,000 people in the convention and God visited them he healed the sick he ministered people were baptized with the Holy Ghost it was fire wave after wave and every Minister every brother spoke under direct inspiration there was no coordination let's talk about this no every brother was led by the spirit and ministered as he was led by the spirit and God confirmed every service and made the all of services connect with one message the final message we are getting out of here we are going to The Rapture you know when you're leaving you tell people pack your bags you're leaving but this journey there's no back to pack don't even bother to pack your bags because it's going to be Goodbye World we stay no longer with you goodby sin goodbye cares of Life goodbye mortgage goodbye rent

in Nigeria and I spoke to the young people for a youth service on Friday night and then I preached on Sunday morning in Lagos as well and I spoke on the manifestation of a super Church as we near The Headstone which is taken from a direct quote from the prophet and it became so real to us because we know that the headstone has to unite with the body but there is a difference between uniting with the headstone and nearing The Headstone when we Unite with the headstone it's one body it's a finished work but brother Bram said as we near The Headstone even before we unite even before the full power even before the completion as we get nearer it's going to be a super church it's going to be a super race as we near The Headstone and I've got news for you this morning when we started the

to turn our Bibles to Exodus chapter 23 we want to read from verse 20 to 33 Joshua 14 1 verse verse2 Judges chapter 1 28-34 and we go back and read verse 20 Exodus chapter 23 okay behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites the Hittites the parasites the Canaanites hivites jebusites and I will cut them off Thou shalt not bow to their gods nor serve them nor do after the works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images for ye shall serve the Lord your God he shall bless thy bread thy water and I will take away sickness away from the midst of thee they shall nothing cast The Young nor be Barren in thy land the number of thy days I will fulfill I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom Thou shal come I will make all n enemies turn their backs onto Thee I will send Hornets before thee we shall drive out the hivites the Canaanite the HTE and before thee and I will not drive them out from thee before thee in one year least the land become desolate and the Beast of the field multiply against thee by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land hallelujah praise God and I will set thy Bones from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines and from the desert unto the river for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land unto your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee Thou shalt make no Covenant with them nor with their gods they shall not dwell in thy land least they make thee sin against against me for if thou serve their gods it will surely be a snare unto thee Joshua 14:12 this is Caleb giving his testimony praise be to Jesus now therefore give me this mountain there where of the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said Judges chapter 1 we want to go from verse 28 and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute and did not utterly drive them out verse 29 neither did Ephraim drive out the kenites that dwell in gizar but the kenites dwelt in gizar among them neither did zebin drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of n not the kenites dwelt among them and became tributaries neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Akon or the inhabitant of zidon no alab no asib no hilab no annik nor reab but the asites dwelt among the Canaanites and inhabitants of the land but it did not drive them out okay neither did naft drive out the inhabitants of Beth shesh nor the inhabitants of benan and he that and he dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of beses and beanas became tributes unto them and the amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley let's go to verse 20 that's the last script we're going to read of that same chapter and they gave Hebron unto Caleb as Moses said and he expelled in the three sons of Enoch let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your word may you come and interpret it to our hearts may this be a transformational service Lord that no one will leave here the same way they came if they came D may they leave up if they came sick may they leave heal if they came broken may you bind the Brokenhearted if they l d out May you strengthen the feeble knees if need encouragement bring that encouragement to them revive the Saints Lord Quicken the people to the word of God if there Sinners MIT may they be saved backsliders may they be restored in Jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated Give the Lord a shout as you take your seats Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory oh praise God hallelujah hallelujah what a scripture reading amen okay numbers 13 the people brought the report after the spies were sent out to bring back a report and they said they told him we came onto the land where the thou sent us us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people are strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great moreover we saw the CH of anak there the amenites dwell in the land of the South the Hittites jebusites amorites dwell in the mountains Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan that was the report they say yes land is good it is nice it is wonderful but it's just that you have Giants in that land and Caleb Steed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it and that's my inspiration this morning we are well able to overcome it and my title is drive them out praise God but that's what we come to do this morning we come to drive them out I don't care if it's in your home if it in a heart if it's in your life if it's in your body if it in sickness I don't care what disease I don't care what condition I care what demon power we had to drive them out Hallelujah and Caleb said if the Lord be with me I shall be able to drive them out we had to drive them out we are going to accept living with no kite living with no jebusite living with no hittite zeul didn't drive them out but Caleb expelled the sons of anoch there are going to be some sons of God oh Hallelujah called to drive these demons out oh hallelujah praise God praise God be seated so I appreciate the message but Isaac spoke before he left unfolding of the Bride praise God but Anthony when it dies it bringing forth fruit much fruit but the wal beneficiaries of the resurrection and but Steven last Sunday possessing your individual inheritance and that was such a tremendous blessing to me because that is the word you see God is not coming for a church the people are deceived in churches because the F of God coming for a church so they figure in the best group God is not coming for no group there'll be one taken and one left that between a field one will be taken one will be left so we not here to talk about no group talk we had to talk about individual give me my Mountain get the Lord I shout in the house I don't know about you I don't know about you but I come to possess what I know is my own Jesus you may be seated glory to God hallelujah habac 2 say write div Vision make it plain that he that read me run why why why why because the vision is for appointed time so you wouldn't get frustrated you wouldn't get fed up you would why did Lord ain't come yet no no no the vision is for appointed time and when you catch the vision you should wait on it I will wait till my change come oh give the Lord a shout in the H the vision itself is for an appointed time oh Hallelujah glory to God Abraham rated 25 years to see Isaac come forth Noah waited 120 years to see the rain fall children Israel waited 400 years before deliverer come but God can't lie God is not a man if God say you're going to be delivered there's no devil in hell to stop that deliverance from coming and I feel somebody going to be delivered this very day this very [Applause] morning may be seated so God coming for church it's coming for individuals isn't that right sir so individual is going to catch Revelation in going to catch Revelation is that right Abraham Faith Isaac love Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection God working his way out yes sir isn't that right so this vision of God this prophetic Vision that was loosed by Seven Seals and seven Thunders amen produce the spirit of Prophecy because once you see the vision then you know you could prophesy because the vision can't lie Abraham could say Isaac is coming there is no evidence there was no witness but Isaac still coming because God gave a vision and he had a revelation that put him on expectation and a spirit of worship that he staggered not at the promise of God to unbelief but was strong in faith giv glory to God you can't have faith and you can't worship Faith must have worship with it you could never have faith and you're dumb and you're dead no no faith is already a substance faith is something you can't show anyone faith is [Applause] revealed do I hear I shout in the house right now God is healing you my God my God we don't have a dead message this message is [Applause] real let be seated Hallelujah the only way Abel could do do different than Cain is because it was revealed to him it was a divine revelation to Abel Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and that's why Jesus come and say who man say I the son of man am some say you're this some say you're that some say you're that opinions men thoughts he said who do you say I am and Peter break out and said thou are the Christ and Jus said Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you but my Father in Heaven had revealed this God could reveal himself to a drunkard to a murderer to a backslider to a hater to a drug Pusher it doesn't matter what condition man somebody in many skirt some prostitute God is Sovereign God reveals to whomsoever he will and if God is Sovereign he could sovereignly deliver you this morning I don't care if you was boozing last night and piping Coke there before it matters not when you overcome youcome my God when the hour for your healing come the hour for your healing come when your hour for deliverance come your hour for deliverance come may be seated praise God for 400 years between Malachi and Matthew no Prophet no messenger just priest tradition pots and pans everybody seeing Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and this is how we just do it here here yes and God lose a man named John the Baptist not zebah not Zechariah John the Baptist gave him a different name different kind of a man to shake the thing up well I never see it so that's right it's different from everywhere else it has to be different because he's making way for messiah he's making way for Dynamics he making way for power it's have to be different what this message need is a revolution and we're going to have one a seventh under Revolution a revolution of the sons of God Fearless men Fearless Sons be aware come on now come on now come on now come on you sons of [Music] God what are you saying right over I'm saying that devil in your house when you see leave here he's starting to tremble because you're leaving here with something that devil in your home that devil in your life that going in that going in you're sending notice all now in the spirit realm angels are being dispatched to come to your assistance because faith is pushing faith is speaking faith is saying amen faith is worshiping faith is saying Hallelujah faith is on the move and God must respond to Faith over let me you don't how I'm feeling notice Jesus never said feel as th this never how you feel it's always believest th this the girl is sick somebody come and said don't worry to come she is dead he said I go wake her you other words he Chang the circumstance he flip the whole thing over you say sick I say sleep come on now you say I say walk you said blind I said see you said dumb I said speak come on now give the Lord a shout you said bong I said free I'm not hearing you ride with me this morning ride with me this morning that devil have to lose you and let you go oh give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house glory be seated so God told Daniel seal up the book the book is sealed till the time of the end there is coming a vision to unfold the mystery of that book that book must be unfolded to show you what to reveal you to reveal to you your here we go Land Of Promise all Joshua and Israel was a natural en type to a spiritual land that God promised us so he called them out of Egypt like he called us out of the world the journey is not the destination I'm sorry for some of you who expect so much thing in the journey but the journey is to a place he said I'm coming I taking you to a place that I have prepared you're going to a place along the journey you have this problem that problem but as I say you had to travel from Grenada to here to there to get to Ivory Coast that's but from Grenada to to to let's say Germany that's not the destination the destination is Ivory Coast but you're flying and stopping different places along the journey you have turbulance playing rocking a little bit fasten your seat belt you have shakes a little bit scary a little bit you land here you get out pick up your luggages you put it on there that's process but you have a destination destination is Ivory Coast destination is Dynamics destination to Holy Ghost Land destination Revival destination come on now preach back to me somebody so all the shakes along the Journey Don't let it upset you the tri of your faith being more precious than gold don't let that shake you don't let child shake you and problem don't let it shake you give the devil Romans 8:28 for we know all things what together for good to them that love God to them that call according to his purpose and the purpose of God must stand [Applause] Jesus said when the spirit of Truth has come Spirit of Truth he would lead you and guide you into all truth so the spirit of truth that is to come after the prophet could only speak according to the vision that the prophet brought so there are no new Mysteries that any man could bring there are no new Mysteries or Hidden Mysteries every mystery has been revealed it may not be revealed to you or me but it has been revealed to a prophet because the word comes to a prophet no other man can come and claim a mystery that the prophet did not reveal that's false that's contrary every mystery has been revealed it's God and a prophet but the Mysteries and the Mysterious Christ to be in you the hope of glory all right so all hell all hell will be against this prophetic Vision that is why God hate the nicolan spirit he hate ministers taking the place of God playing there at the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is a promise to you not no man the the Holy Ghost no the Holy Ghost is your promise I'll be with you but I'll be in you come on say Amen [Applause] somebody remember this do never forget this when Israel asks for a King Samuel dropped to the ground don't go there don't ask for that they want a king like other nations a king to go before them a man a go God God is a king what you want with flesh and blood for we we were human for Pillar of Fire hanging by Night Cloud hanging by day he brought you out with a mighty hand where you want a man for where you want flesh and blood for he told Samuel they have not rejected you that's right they rejected me give them what they want you see if you don't want God's perfect will he give you a permissive will and he could bless you in his permissive will too but that is not the bride the bride will have perfect will step God bless you brother Stephen Steph said the church member not going to be adopted because the church members ain't going to back up the Philistines this bride is born to overcome this is the age of overcoming so you are blessed to get the test don't just shake your head so say Amen say hallelujah hallelujah you are blessed to get the test you are honored to be [Applause] tested look look look at job job asked God for a trial God battling with the devil over job and say look at him cons consider him now he's my best man on the earth I am telling you what inside that man you can change all we think around him watch Satan's interpretation of job is he have a hedge around him and that is why he behaving himself he have money have a nice car he family every T everything nice that is why he's serving God that is why in church God telling the devil that's not why he's in church if you stripp him of his money his car his wealth his health he will s serve me is not what around him it's what's in him my God my God you don't make him a feel to preach God have to rough things up man to make sure there's nothing connecting to in you that is a contrary desire right you're going to break this and break this and break your pride and humble you and humiliate you because that's what Jesus did he humbled himself and became in the form of a servant and he became became obedient to the Cross then he said learn of me I'm humble and meek and lonly in heart there's a spirit of God that dwells in humility that b said the first sign of the Holy Ghost is humility that's what's lacking people are too proud and God will throw down your kingdom oh give the Lord some Praises whether you say Amen or not is still the truth my so this messenger of Malachi 4 is going to to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers then he reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in ration 10 which are the revelations contained of the Seven Seals it will be these here we go divinely revealed not humanly stated and and preached divinely reveal mystery truths is what will literally turn the hearts of a children back to the fathers turn it back to the fathers which is another Ephesians the promised land so if our understanding is open of this prophetic Vision then you will see you belong to that land no Pastor no Elder no Bishop no church could keep you out of it God have no secretary to pass through Give the Lord a shout in the house God have sons and daughters that's why God tell Joshua listen MOS was dead God didn't go to weep in M say God Moses dead God not in that Mode God said Joshua Moes my is dead now therefore take people across Jordan amen it was very simple three things Cross Jordan fight and divide the [Applause] land very simple the message of the hour is very simple Moses is dead now Joshua take the people over Cross Jordan fight D them out I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you some of you looking for God to fight for [Applause] you well I waiting on the Lord and go say I waiting on you I give you the land you want me to bring but and Cutlass you want me to bring hoe you want bring Fork you want me to send angels to help you cut the grass you don't want to take nothing you just want to just sit down there and relax and I do do all they work for you and say you overcome what there was a land to be taken this land was possessed by seven tribes h jeit g all the Hees plus Philistines let me there yet go them fell back down at the he Zeon couldn't hit this he na couldn't dig with that he them he is low level fellas the Philistines them is the dread [Applause] Lords them have char of iron don't even talk about that yet take adopted Sons to handle them guys out there but for now we going to drive out all might all what we could drive out we going to drive them out can somebody say Amen could somebody give a shout in the [Applause] house this messenger of Malachi first to do what bring back the original faith and he call it the resurrection faith that they seen Jesus after he was raised from the dead working among them amen about preach a masterpiece to identify the resurrection Ministry of Jesus Christ among the disciples was not de Easter oh the Lord is Among Us he is back yeah he is back yes yes yes but that is not your Easter amen Easter was Pentecost so he came among them show every he's alive heal sick multiply this fish and everything else do miracles for them but it was to give them a faith to go and believe for Dynamics in the upper room so testifying we see the Lord we see that's great that's a group testimony we see the Lord we see the Lord yeah yeah but you to go in the upper room Lord is Among Us yeah yeah yeah but he the promise is not to be among us his promises to be in you so you can't sit back and say woo we have a wonderful group of no no no until this fire come inside of you fight press push until you connected to the actual Source God have no grandchildren God have sons and daughters that's who are here this morning is that right GL oh my my my so therefore what you must see is Jesus back among the people since that Pro Prophet left amen so the prophetic Vision brings on the fith yes shows you that the Fate has been restored the Fate has been revealed yes sir the faith must be ripened amen and the faith must be manifested amen hallelujah but B and restor the faith that Faith came as a revelation 7 SE seven tunders it's revealed but that Faith must mature ripen yes Hallelujah then manifested not talk not tested manifested not just pulati Peter Peter had more than that true his his intellectual Faith make him deny Christ his intellectual Faith make him run but when Holy Ghost Came Upon Peter he didn't run he said Silver and Gold Have I None what have I I could give unto you rise up and walk that was the power we talking about that's the power to be in Sons amen permanent power resident power not temporary power permanent power resident power that's your promise could I he the sons in the house say Amen [Music] [Applause] Hall [Music] GL Glory Hallelujah believe it or not that's the backdrop [Applause] let's go into the message that's a c behind that's the backdrop the prophetic Vision revealed the promised land not the Ephesians amen the prophetic the prophetic Vision reveal a holy wall of occupation yes sir God want you to occupy the land not run and say might you know I see Enoch you see a son Enoch there and binoculars and telling people you see a cross there so that's my own up that hill there Jordan in front of you know but you're using spy glasses God tell Joshua are you ready every place you put your foot is yours if you don't put it it's not yours come on now preach back tell me somebody every place you put your foot you got to put your foot on your land [Applause] hallu don't leave the devil on your husband claim him if he don't want Pray when he eyes open Pray when he eyes closed don't leave the devil and your wife claim her don't leave the devil your children claim them say Satan I Ser when you notice Deliverance has come speak speak speak you may be seated hallel one of the hardest things is to do something that was never done before that's the hardest change you see if you're custom doing something and a little shift and a little Shi that's easy but when you are challenged to do something you have never done be sful that is a transformational experience this is what these brothers encountered God promised them a land words is what they hearing God couldn't wait to bring them up to the land god couldn't wait to send out spice to see it and bring back evidence here one more talk not when you reach the land he want to bring back evidence of signs wonders Miracles Powers healings deliverances he want evidence back am that's what the grapes represent that's what the wine represent that's what the oil represent that's what the milk represent evidence that God keeps his word the Brethren testimony was yes it's true but we see Giants we see we see children of Enoch and this guys is who Caleb going to expel the the boss man himself and his two brothers so so we see Giants and and therefore we we not able to take it Caleb yes who was the shortest man in the camp but brand said Cale stand up on a box what a paradox smallest man on a box telling people let's go up at once we are well able to possess it amen with all them Giants and people only watching him and shaking their head no I have a thought behind this whole thing let us stand like Joshua and Caleb am you have a choice this morning stand with them 10 spies who see and the faith get weak because the challenge is too big my husband this my child this I sick with this and all that is all that is all that is the talk it's so giant for God I have cancer I leukemia I this I have a tumor I have this case I lost my job I just get fired Insurance up and whatnot and all that is just Giants when you could flatten them Giants and pull them we are well a tell somebody I am able come tell somebody [Applause] oh give the Lord a shout when last have you shout when I B you to shout shout because the Lord had given us the victory we are well [Applause] able Hallelujah glory to God glory to God this is brother brandham he speak about Elijah under juniper tree he was tired he was hungry Angel woke him up eat some more because the journey is very hard and brother R is prophesying oh what we need in this journey that we is now is to find a place of rest and to Feast on the word of God that it will give us strength he said before there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church and I believe we have been children long enough God is going to turn his church into manhood now we have played and folic as children but now we're going to have to put up with childish things and take on manhood maturity who would have thought we would be here almost 50 years since the last has already come long journey yes hard journey and we are feasting on the word with the prophetic Vision that the land belongs to us listen if you see that it changes you then you're on your road to possess you can only possess what you know is your [Applause] own you can't claim somebody else land huah amen GL Hallelujah my Hallelujah hear this one and this some brother CH send this for me just in time beautiful quote from ration chapter 5 you understand now what the seven seed book was hallelujah what it is we got it in scroll now and just remember in these last days it was kept in an Earthly vessel you understand that now who was the Earthly vessel Jesus Christ amen no man had it nobody had it it's only through him it wasn't even written in the word if it was written in the word it was hid so you couldn't even find it that's right and if it's in him that it's revealed then in that Earthly vessel it wouldn't rust or rust when he comes he pulls back one to his church so this seven SE scroll book is to be veiled in Earth vessels amen oh my it has to be veiled behind you Hallelujah so it's a little more than talk right is a little more than preaching it right is a little more than explaining it right what it is it has to be veiled in you that's why the prophet had to eat the book it was representing of taking in the word and getting the word on the inside so you have to receive the word and become the word then you Veil the word itself because you are the words of the book so you will be veiling the book itself Oh Glory to God hallelujah remember Adam had the book the book had names in it Adam was supposed to call the names but Adam fell the book went back to God but the book came back down then you like Adam God bring back the book to put it back in sons in the last days that going to call names you're going to be born into manifestation oh Jesus my God help me this morning if you know what I'm seeing this morning I'm seeing beyond your failures beyond your sin beyond your fault beyond your fear I'm seeing Suns I'm seeing seeds I'm seeing jeans I'm seeing germ I'm seeing what you are to become not what you are Oh Glory to God help me Jesus I want you to see what I'm seeing I can see why the devil fought this prophetic Vision because if you catch it you'll begin to fight with all your might you would recognize is no sitting long and just taking things for granted you're accepting your sickness yeah asking this is the cause and this is how it is Lord and and no no you stop that start to speak a little thing look look go tell Moses bring the people to this place to worship me right and then he end up with Red Sea in front of him mountains on both sides hard case Moses fall back in human realm begin to cryto God God say why cry Toto me speak and move forward then Moses come back in order to say red se you had to move you [Applause] [Music] know now Elijah was a little different he was a different kind of a man he he he had to talk he just take his mantle and just strike the Jordan River Jordan supposed to understand give me room let me pass I want to pass Jordan open up the Lord and Shout in the H that's what we talking about right now we need a Revival right now we I feel to step my foot on the Revival step your foot on signs wonders Miracles lay hands upon the sick shall recover speaking the word put your faith on that you have a right to speak just as God spoke let may be seated a woman had had a child was sick she was in the in the audience and a woman next to her fell led to pray for her baby that's right and she prayed for the baby and then woman come in the prayer line or something like that come full story might be all details of it and then bam says a lady next to you pray for the baby and baby was healed because God saw that woman I'm more compassion than I and God used that woman to pray for the child so the prophet did not pray for the baby a woman ordinary person not Pastor wife not Bishop wife not Elder wife ordinary Soul daughter of God with faith could pray and God can answer prayer you tell me God can answer your prayer Satan trembles when he sees the weakest Saint upon their [Applause] knees Hallelujah Wonder so many say a marriage of the Lamb is that quote you're familiar with so many say if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I'll serve him that's up to you you have got something to do they that overcome shall inherit all things they overcome you have power to do it [Applause] see somebody tired got a tired let the house catch a [Applause] fire see if they so tired they and dead that tiredness is relative to the environment overcome this temptation oh yeah let something else come man you would run like Joseph it all depends upon the environment that's why Satan has make it nice to wheel you in but the wages of sin is still dead that's why the way is narrow and hard and that's the choice we make we choose this rugged way we ches to overcome our own selves we have to there is something called denying yourself [Applause] that's a word people don't use denying self wife want her own way husband want his own way everybody nobody want to deny and Jesus said deny yourself put yourself last now try it out and see how does [Applause] work people want I but God want you to deny self but that's what Christ did he push self aside in order to press forward not my will but thy will will be done I I wish I could push this aside but there's a cost hallelujah oh my Hallelujah so you see God could not push us through a pipe and pull us in the other end and say blessed he said overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just push you through but you have got decisions for yourself decisions are beautiful should I shouldn't I should I move through and a lot of fruit is what you see of your decisions so then you are challenged to seek God to make the right decisions because they want the right fruit Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah God they wanted a king go get them Saul Saul start off nice they always do until Pride overtake them then they go off track isn't that right Samuel come to say kill everything kill everything don't even take the nothing else come a day and hear bleeding he said where that here bleeding he said we keep some for the Lord and then King AAG big guy he he he covered he feeling safe man Samuel draw sword kill K I mean it was it was finished because God said don't do it don't touch it I will send a hornet before you I will send my angel before you you'll be there'll be an enemy to be your enemy and be enemy to your enemies as long as you stay with that word [Applause] but Israel heart always backsliding and anytime you backslide there's a king to take you into captivity and then when you repent God punish that King so we must know when you repent because you come back with the joy and your hands back up in the air when you see you in trouble hands down GL Hallelujah that nothing scripture and the four beast 24 Elders no no no they were saying amen hallelujah that's that's God is the object of worship that when you could Praise Him anyhow Praise Him in any circumstance Praise Him in a song in a timal praise him in the dance Praise Him in the fiery furnace Praise Him in your hot trial praise him when you don't understand what you're going through [Applause] hallah praise him when you're on the Potter spinning wheel and your life is spinning and it's cast up but he is shaping he's molding praise him when your money going low in your pocket praise him any and everything that had better praise God let God be a record this morning that your faith is worshiping your faith is praising you reject the circumstance that his eyes see your ears here listen where are you going what do they do in Canaan they were possessing their rights possessing their right say rights right now watch you could be your father worst child I didn't say you are but when he leave the deed and the will and leave property for you or something for you that is your right brother ABC and D who was the good doers in the house they could say what they want if your father said this is yours that is your right you didn't ask him for it he did it he will it when Jesus died you didn't ask him for it [Applause] he wi it he did [Applause] it you may be seated so let's say the the father have three properties is three brothers or three sisters property a property B property C when you come and he hear the deed will the will is r and you was given property C and you say it wasn't worthy I be so bad the father should should not Le for me and you're saying that but you're glad because it was left for you the other two in the family can say none for you they can say none how much they want when you go to the lawyer office you say come um to sign for my rights my father left this to me where do I put my signature you sin that has nothing to do with your fail that has nothing to do with it your backl that have nothing to do with it where do I sign I want to put my name I want to put my foot I want to rest on what is m [Applause] so let's eliminate this I'm not worthy and Mis behave and acted no forget that don't go there Jesus give Parables to demonstrate how the father sees things he give the parable of the prodal son who went and spent all the money he pick food and he said I arise I'll come back home and the father in the meantime looking out for his son to come back now listen listen he's not a servant he's a son once a son always a son you will not be [Applause] denied you can't go to Heaven's da and say I don't know you once a son always a son you will not be denied so stop hanging your head like if you the worst in in tongue you are not the Lord I shout is there anybody inside this house this [Applause] morning watch they were possessing their rights they could not possess their rights till they got into Canaan they didn't ow nothing in the wilderness when they come in Canaan they had rights and we have got rights but you have to fight for it every inch of grow you have to fight for it when you receive the Holy Ghost you're in Canan you have to fight for it every inch of gr you have to fight that's the reason people say brother brandham you pray for me today get over in Canan once brother you realize where you belong watch prayer start things you know when you get in can and say wait a minute I didn't know all is his Minds healing his Minds breakthrough his Minds Deliverance his Minds a great pray me in his L you know you're going through depressions and frustration and why this happen and why this happen see all that because you hit Canan land yet when you hit Canan land you can't explain all what happened but you're cutting off depression you're pushing back frustration you're getting the joy of the Lord which is your strength you don't have to get a movie to get some joy and then your joy lost no the joy is in the Holy Ghost you're getting a Revival in the word you're getting a Revival coming to church you're getting your breakthrough in the kingdom of God oh glory to God hallelujah praise God so Abraham was air to all things he could claim to everything and that was the land and Abraham had been given a promise and it looked like everything went going wrong for Abraham yet he owned the whole thing Abraham could possess that land what was in it God give it to him and lot was part of that land so Abraham had a right to it he could call or lay hold of it listen to this now God made a promise let me see and that was the land and that was mine you made a promise now My Kinsman have been taken and he is gone and Abraham I lay a hold of the promise it's my possession you told me so and then you can go after that enemy the devil and Slaughter you see many of us don't feel we could go after the enemy you [Applause] can the Bible said in my name you shall cast out Devils yes sir devils are not to be discussed with let's have a discussion um over coffee hallah we have a tea party and we'll discuss this thing no no no devils are to be cast out when the devil see you he say he come in let's go they coming that's a church and

go back and back him up you can't pray you can't get yes you're going to pray and bust right [Applause] you I like what God is doing know Moses run from Egypt take a 40-year break and God pack him up and send him straight back to Egypt that's right same place you run from that's right same place you running from go go send your right back there to deal with the Enemy and all you have to tell yourself to every Goliath there is a David or let's change it this way to every golad there's a stone so once you know golad he's family to anoch he same family all them in Giants thing but St Stone once there's a giant he could be conquered we have no reason to doubt anymore I don't care if it's a giant as cancer tumor leukemia I don't care what condition it is it could be conquered I have a shadow of death hanging over you now that could roll back Hallelujah it had one time a man a man God said set the papers time up for you and that man saved before God and said God I serve you all these years I need more time and God give him more time that an all could be conquered oh my my my I call you young men because you're strong don't ever let the devil tell you you're weak he call you because you have a strength as a young person to stand and withstand the devil come on say Amen somebody butam says we are air to every spiritual blessing Abraham had a right to the promise the promise was his and yet he had to fight to possess it there you are believer today with we air to All Things yet we are air to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight every inch of it that's the way God get it set [Music] up character is not a victory character is not a gift rather character is a victory and a victory is something that you have overcome and I see it over the years I've never seen where blessings give people character does all mean pain suffering anguish hurts this is what forms you into the image Hallelujah of God hallelujah I have seen blessings destroy people because it wasn't even prepared for iten Hallelujah that's why God could have blessed Solomon with riches you know because Solomon asked for wisdom he didn't ask for riches he asked for wisdom to govern God's people and because he asked for that God could weth put wealth on him because he have the wisdom to manage it hallu sometime when blessing come too fast and too much people go wrong because your human Spirit cannot handle it like a brother say something in the meeting was so powerful he said I don't want to know your weakness because I don't know how I could handle it I don't want to dig up and find what you do wrong and go down and no I want to know that he said because God know your weakness and he his attitude towards you doesn't change Hallelujah huj his nature towards you doesn't change but as a human we could change we could feel this way and feel that way but when God see you he looks beyond your faults he looks beyond your weakness he looks beyond your struggle when God saw Saul new testament Saul God saw him becoming Paul he was riding his high hor fighting the church killing battling all them Believers running from Saul and God see Paul coming but he riding a soul right in his high hor God knock him off his high hor who are th Lord who would have thought Saul was going to become Paul we write off the man called Saul because he fighting the church but God didn't write them [Applause] off don't write off anybody there's a real difference between opinion and judgment you could have an opinion about somebody that's fear that's fine with more information your opinion could change I didn't know this I I know have new information my opinion changed on that person but when you judge somebody put you put them in concrete there's nothing they could do because you have them fixed they could smile you still don't like them they can bring a gift for you with bow tie you still don't like them because you have an opinion and a judgment on that person thank God he's not like that he said Peter you deny me but after you converted strengthen your brethren Peter the devil want to S like wheat he could tell what going to happen he could tell when you're going to fail but he could tell when you going to be restored tell when you're going to bounce back tell when you're going to stand he can tell all about you he still chose you that's why you should be rejoicing you should be thanking God now God want you to possess your land no know skipping here jumping here listen to this Revelation 10K Christ Mighty angel ration 10:7 the messenger Revelation 103 and 4 S the voices the message but 10811 John represented the bride said take the book eat the book thou must prophesy again why should we have to prophesy because the time is not yet and the vision is for an appointed time Hallelujah then you have to get the spirit of Prophecy to prophesy over your own life Hallelujah David said the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me Hallelujah you have to connect with the prophecy your own prophecy to step into your position Hallelujah because you have to be a heart of the children who turn Hearts back to the faith of the fathers Hallelujah you have to connect with your prophecy the spirit in The Bride sck come this is you he shall turn the heart of the children back to the faith of the fathers Peter waiting on you Paul waiting on you we have to go back and pick up what they had and go further than them we have to bring up the resurrection because David us not made perfect we have to go and pick up what they had and go beyond them we are called to go beyond where any other people went before think about it North Korea have their nuclear thing America feeling this way bombs threats the world is going crazy am miss all of that God is teing up the heat but a bride has to be ready before anything take place the bride has to be ready and the Bible said his wife had made herself ready that means she have done something about the close of the word she just said she make herself ready ready look this morning thousands and thousands of people in churches sitting enjoying our service enjoying a preacher preaching they love the pastor they love the preacher and what not but is are they be made ready if we don't make you ready we are failed if you don't catch the prophetic Vision we have failed if I am the vision you have nothing to do just sit down and watch meall watch watch our TV I be like a movie just come and watch but when you understand that the whole creation is groaning travailing for the sons of God to step forward and you are that you are called to that the people that know their God what you know Luther didn't know what you know Wesley didn't know you who know the whole secret of God go in a prophet anyone of you can go back in the age and be a messenger with the knowledge that you have of this word therefore to whom much is given much is expected much is required we have a higher we have a higher calling hallelujah look look look look the president of America say he didn't know job was so hard he he applied for a job and receive a job that he didn't recognize what what all involved no he he thought it was an easier life he had an easier life before this that's what America have right now that's what they vote for God can't risk that Jesus Sons come in position and power well well your sees already how man has rule in dictatorship and Rule with rigor that's why God have to look for Sons with character because God can't wait to put his signature to put his ring on his sons in the beginning he was proud of Adam you know yes he said he turn his back man let us make man in our own image and likeness let him have dominion when he put Adam he walk away hallelujah oh Hallelujah the Bible said and he saw it was good God didn't get a fight oh gosh H son acting like me no a son reflecting the fathers Adam was just like God God even tell Adam to name the animals and the Bible said whatever the name was that was the name thereof Adam was a Tor authorized to name the animals an was had full Dominion on the earth he had the book he had the authority he had the power but there was war in heaven Oh Glory and Satan got kicked out and the Battle of angels became the Battle of men oh Hallelujah so that battle fell on the earth and tonight we in a great battle but we have a word drive them out and if Michael Kick Out Lucifer out of heavenly places what you think we're going to do here on the earth think about it he was kicked

back give it back it his Minds don't let him Bluff you stand right there and say he'll give it back but you have to believe in your Authority not power yet Authority when the policeman go out on the road and sto the traffic he no power Amen to stop no traffic that car could knock him straight down and get driving but what they respect is the uniform because he are backing the whole ATT police force the whole The Authority the whole legal system is behind that policeman so he could be small he could be a new recruit and they look thin and fresh you know how this look already everything

how neighbors go see me how I supposed to feel I feeling bad who build my cities he say you know what let me go after them that's what God wanted because God wanted to deal with them they don't understand that let the enemy come against you he come after you playing Fresh not after this morning when the angel of the Lord encamp around those that fear not after this morning this after this morning you got to understand angels have been dispatched to assist you in your Warfare I will send my angel before [Applause] you oh Glory Hallelujah the Prime Minister doesn't come out just like that just jump in a can take a try and go and drive he have escorts you have blue lights you have police in front and police behind a motorbike and whatnot why because of his office because of his position and when the church Finds Its place in Christ because of your position oh no devil the devil to get permission to approach you got angels are there to protect you because you have a destination you have a purpose in your system like Duck you're ordained to cut for the water you have a purpose to manifest the sons of God the manifestation sons of God you have to come to manifestation do you believe that oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah oh my so many people I listen to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Spirits they in the world they are demons and they get into places and they get among men ministers they get among church members they get among good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that are contrary to the word of God he call them enticing Spirits he said what we need is not a p not a not a Pentecost but the god of Pentecost you're coming to Jordan men and women each one of you is coming down to Jordan I don't know when that may be it maybe before daylight come but there's coming a time when you're going to need more than a old M eaten rope of some church you're going to need the god that set that church of fire in the early days you're going to have to have the vision that they had in the early church hallelujah oh glory to God I I tell somebody that money you need is Vision people could have money have no vision the main thing is the vision what do you see son of man what do you see what's what you see Hallelujah God see potential people sometimes they don't even understand what they're looking at why would God leave the Pharisees and the scribes who know scriptures to pick up Peter fisherman who no curing I no strong language Peter can't even read and write but God pick him up because God going be on head God seeing what's in a heart God going Bey on education God seeing a vessel that he could just step into it come on now Hallelujah God seen a house that he could live in he could walk in he's seen a shoes he could put on a dress he could wear a tie he could put on

who's the greatest who's the greatest Jesus bring a little child except you be like you to become like that little child then Jesus bust a curve ball on them he that great is among you let him serve for the son of man came not to be served but the son of man came to serve come and wash the feet and say see what I do do for one another who great serve wash one another feet trying to demonstrate leadership by Serv servitude servant leadership he demonstrated it to them he said the Gentiles have rulers ruling over them don't do like that if they want to rule serve oh could we give the L and [Music] Praises he is our example he is the example seat son he is who we connect with in order to live and operate the life of Jesus Christ oh my my my my my oh hallelujah oh glory to God glory to God enticing Spirit going forth demons under disguises people wondering brother brandham how do you let go I've heard a lot of people say I'm going to fast for 40 days so I can do something you don't need a 40-day fast you need to let go of the world and all these devilish things and take God word in your heart you got to be taught how to do that you don't do it by jumping up and down neither you do it by a 4day fast you do it by a surrendered heart to almighty God and then he compared to a little baby he said like a little baby and notice a little baby back there his mother tried to put a little jacket on him this morning and he want to get his little arm in the sleeve he couldn't put his arm in there he don't know how you have to guide his little arm he wants to get his arm in there but he's beaten all around he will never get the sleeve he knows not how to get in the sleeve so that is what you are you are not right with God when you are backbiting lying doing everything you can't be right with God I don't care how much churches you belong to until your soul becomes converted that's old fashioned that's that's that's boil down and put soup on your soul watch until you could he's got to have somebody direct him and that's the way it is every born again Christian when he really gets into God he watches his life with God's word and he realizes he's lined up with every bit of it he's got longsuffering gentleness quietness meekness power Faith love joy peace he in talks about like the trouble sea amen hallelujah praise God his thoughts are pure his heart is pure his intentions are pure his alternatives are right and and he knows he's line up with the word of God hell can't move him he's lined up with the word of God he's got Divine love pu in heart for every man
