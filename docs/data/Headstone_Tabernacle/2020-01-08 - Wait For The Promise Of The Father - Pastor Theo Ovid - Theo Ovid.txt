the needs of the people granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen god bless you thank you for coming if I hear by bus I like it returned tonight the three portion of scripture we want to read a clear sees chapter 11 verse 4 acts one want to eat in Revelation chapter 22 10 to 17 we didn't form those acts uniquely Aziz chapter 11 was full he did observe at the wind shall not sue and he that regarded the clouds shall not read ox one the former treaties are I'm a dirty awful us of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen to whom he also assured himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which said he have heard of me for John truly baptized at water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they would therefore come together they asked of him saying Lord will Dow at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel he 7 to them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father put in his own power but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and in Samaria under the uttermost part of the earth I'm gonna water a Revelation chapter 20 22 we don't waste em and he said unto me scene like the scenes of the prophecy of this book why for the time is at hand he doesn't just let me burn just till he the really filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still I me who like come quickly and my reward is with me to do what to give every man according on his work shall be am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed the data do his commandments that they may have right to the Tree of Life the enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers idolaters who shovel love it'll make it a lie and I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I'm the root an offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come let him but here it say come let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise God is such a blessing to be here tonight and together wrong the hood of God and that is what we got a wrong here we not gotten our own newspaper clippings or talk chats or talk readers talk shows we come here to hear the word of God the news is the same as the different people crooks bandit steals information just different people happening to but this word is eternal this word have deliverance in it this would have power in a dish would have the encouragement and strength and grease what you need amen praise God amen so tonight title of is wait for the promise of the Father the promise of the father not some Minister not some poop not some bishop wait for the promise because God came and give you a promise it's the promise of the Father God give you a promise he said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet he said me Elijah to the entire world that's that mean this Messi belong to all of us and he but if I see Elijah shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fate of the father's I witness a he Amin his message so we don't even have our own message we preach another man's message oh praise the name of the Lord so this promise of the father is from AK from Luke 24 this is Jesus he said behold I send the promise of my father so all this thing about children in their hearts back to the faith of the fathers you have the nobody father's ad you have to know what was promised at the father and you have to know what you went back to hallelujah you're not going back to school you came back to the Father the faith of the fathers because these guys they had the original fate hallelujah they had the power of God among them is not right so when Jesus these are guys with all the Holy Ghost now these are guys that following Solomon ministry these are guys that once was preaching had signs one of the miracles but there was that didn't a permanent power they were anointed with temporary power to have a ministry to work with Jesus they were under training under Jesus they were under teachings under Jesus but they had not yet received that resident personal power that is promised to make sons of God manifest because Jesus by the word is that in the beginning of the world it was with God and the Word was God that's good but the word became flesh that's even better and the purpose the word become flesh is that he could connect us to bring us back into position and the word became flesh and well Amara's he came unto his own one is although receiving his own rejected but whoever receive him to them Givi power not just more words but power to become the sons of God so all this Jesus come in word made flesh is that bringing atmosphere a channel that we could become sons of God now when God talking about become sons of God me essence of God but the sons of God he is talking about his tribute sons of the Spirit that's a different thing that's not attribute in you and taught in you and Germany that's not that we'll be talking about we're talking about coming it to be a manifested son a current film son I've indicated son the issues that about the sons you know is if you come a little a manifestation or glory they'll also talk over I went talk over you have to see the results behold I come quickly maybe waters with me so God give a space a time to see what these sons these last days sons what they will do or give the Lord a show we have the same subject the prophetic vision of the end time and our inspiration is the same as Sunday let us hold fast to the professional of faith little wavering because you see from that promise Heath is people that promise or glory to God if the passes or crooked doesn't matter he is faithful that promised he gave a promise and he can't lie God will change man God will change bishops Palmer change whoever have the change shake up this and shake up that back but he's not gonna change his promise to be with you Oh glory to God he said by myself have I sworn I went God's where it's got to happen or they believe that so this year what Jesus said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tyranny City of Jerusalem until until you have a clear understanding no that is what they had before Jesus spent always with them open up the understanding open up the word open the seeds of the Old Testament to reveals it and what must be released hallelujah so after they understand and open up Bella hungry after the word open up they have something to receive it have not understand and Obama say Allah understanding no no no no is understanding of what you're going to receive them shout out receive you have to receive something you have to get something when they come to church you come to get something or glory their God and once you come to get is beyond director of the word you've come to receive power or glory to God not when the press come down like nothing promised I am looking for no precedent and on my chromosome when the press come don't want you to put and that is the press coming on base that but this is this so I'm not looking for press I looking for the bride hundred looking for hunted somebody hunted me unto me I looking for power this is the promise of the father I will deal with that when that comes but I taken this year know did you know what I'm saying I will t be depressed I will be been hunted persecuted I will even order when that hand come but you see no this is the promise and this nobody can change that nobody can remove that from Saturday and nobody can stop you I'm accessing that because when Jesus had at Calvary he Buster fail from the top to the bottom and kill all the Old Testament High Priest stuff that you could have direct access no Mary no secretary nobody or get the Lord I sure I wanted to see that to my channel you have to see that you know because the Nicolaitans will come because they put all the anointed and power over on a man and gosh I hit that oh yeah I am here cause I hate that because he's a quarter of the audience I want to be among my people I'm gonna walk among them but among them I'm gonna live among them or give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory so Jesus purpose of coming and it wasn't the parade himself assembly Messiah I am God I'm no no it was not he came specifically to pay the price to release his spirit to get the produce of the sons way Adam field Jesus couldn't feel so Adam was supposed to reproduce sons sons of God Adam fell he couldn't do it telling the sex and reflection whatever it is but when Jesus come he come to release the word because you have to be born by the word you must be born again by the word and spirit so Jesus came to bring the word to bring us back to the Katmai even before the fall let us make man in our image and likeness that was spoken word man that was man to be born by the word and spirit so when he sent a prophet to gather all the scattered word the tide back in the world to bring on the Holy Ghost wants to bring back the image of God back a meal together so we are not normal sun's rays that's why Paul said I didn't come among you with words of enticing man's words but I came to preach that power that your faith may rest not in man but in the power of God your fear can rest on a man or get the Lord a shout I will say it again your feet your faith can address on a man you have the resin the power of God behold I send the promise of my father upon you there's a whole message myself behold let everybody else would be alive don't listen to nobody else Jesus talking behold I talkin I send the promise of the father upon you hallelu I assented to a next month I attend to some Bishop a servant upon you hallelujah but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high not perform shaking me pastor Han not perform fix Imelda hand on some teaching hand power from where that power coming from that power not come from the earth that Park on high and he left them as fast the Bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to Pat Metheny same Jesus they was crying about on the m11 the Jesus Jesus gone he was dead and they crying and they sad and everything else alone this time you said he bless in the right blessing upon you wait for the promise of the Father Oh glory to God the breath of God is upon them the world is open up to them the faith is in their soul nothing but stop them they are afraid to shut the doors because the Romans looking for them looking for these disciples looking for this type of Jesus they calls it off by the waitin the reason until but they're waiting in a certain atmosphere they are waiting idolan there with the frustration of setup how long no reason no and all these 40 years moody not talking that kind of talk did not with it in that spirit they know what is faithful then no God can't lie then they could hold to the promise they know they can have confidence in what court said or glory their court so they are waiting they're waiting on something people laughs on an ember this the waited we will claim to have this and claim to have that but they still with him or plural accord because man didn't make the promise and man can keep the promise and God is big enough to promise if he's big enough to promise he is big enough to bring his promise to pass or give the Lord a show tonight I will say it again if God big enough to make a promise he is be enough to bring that promise to pass I don't care what the circumstances look like now I get an excited little God that is why I read the scripture here observing the will shall not show what does that mean it means you don't regard the circumstance you don't regard what your eyes see you don't regard what their ears hear that is nothing for you you're not regarded not much anybody else in your news hole either but when everybody watching you are showing when you don't want to review I read them you will do exactly opposite so what all the sense unhuman the sea realm is hot enough hallelujah praise God [Applause] so we're not observing the wind we have observing anything external focus on the promise the promise of the Father and when you walk probably go to Gaza he that observer the wind shall not sow god I can't look at the condition everybody with a very bright condition to act the right at most right everything will be nice and and and already eyes had to see and the ears hear the convey unjust and the brightest completely opposite to that because when a mulatto Sarah if Abram taken Sarah looks Abram you sure are you sure but because of what was revealed to Abraham it was who save as looks and condition and wrinkle and age was irrelevant Barbossa did conquer things are not as though they were he flipped the script on the devil when the devil expect him to be pressed he was joyful when they expect devil expected to be sad he was happy when the devil expectable citizen though he was standing up or glory there Gordon and court and court say that his fate and I have proven that and paintin fountain that kind of faith as righteousness do I wrote in the host PC corner and working with this human Instagram thing [Music] unless you come to the spot to demonstrate active feet you just a new flesh natural believer halle-loo that's why I say out of a group of the true see they would call would represent a beloved bride because in that group of the to seat of the world who have natural and spiritual and the spiritual could be called out because the spiritual is the seed of Abraham or glory to God do you believe that still trying to come to know something he can they pass he blessed them he parted from them tied up at the heaven and they worship Him and they returned to Jerusalem with with smiles no if I see that here you know smiles and Joy's are the same thing I know yeah yeah smile and joy joy listen joy this bubble of joy people if I even say anything people know upon your heady great joy somebody's a great joy great joy hallelujah the message shows of that people just go into the motion but they had great joy and that great joy now they were continually with temporal continually in the temple wasn't staying home continually temple praising and blessing God as I'm Big Shot staying home and just watching services and and channel moving from church to church the channel moving this is and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God so they were in an atmosphere of worship they worship in a revelation it was worshiping with expectation they was worship another anointing of a promise of the Father every time they go to home go to work go everywhere they know the promise of the father's upon them do you know the promises upon you the promise of the father is actually upon you Goa can light that anointing is upon you wherever you corner promise going or glory to God hallelujah be like them five virgins in Joshua accent evening amounted give him a portion a bunch of them didn't ask for nothing there was natural cannot believers the ato wait and just say how long are you so strapped to get your promise oh come on push back to me denial no feeling good turnout hallelujah come on now come on now come on out and slackers getting a rebuke or glory there for them chocolates getting a rebuke how long it'll be slack - you can't be stuck inside oh yeah no we have with the Russell with that promise if the ores that never zalaya you try to tell you if you need to belong to you you're not worthy or don't you that off I'm excited about this you can I didn't make the promise so I could preach it I could preach it but if it I'm not afraid of it it's the promise of the Holy Ghost oh I know what I'm looking for no mando had to come and explain to me what I supposed to look for now I know what I'm looking for I'm telling what I'm looking for need for the promise of the Father go glory to God hallelujah angel yeah well bring the angel and come hallelujah I'm right to check out every angel money angel and winged angel or glory to God let them talk let them see what the messages Oh hallelujah because God sent one Elijah but the message that spanned the generation well Holly laser is dead but the days of the force is still here this is once more the world will get away from God that means that same anointing that same angel that the one with the swept-back wings may come back again the same promises oh how the promise of the Father the promise of dynamics to the mechanics the promise of Rebecca Vale old old Harvard a shiny ticket Oh glory to God hallelujah like Samantha you read when they will say the spirit eh ah dah press upon Elijah who is he like said a few that's the brighter Jesus Christ that's not some man or get the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory and they were continuing example how scratching the hell I'm gonna set our notebook right in like too many preachers say no longer you write for 40 years over take notes take your notes you know I say don't take no Jenna but TK knows and worship so give God praise give me glory my god your life like a week and pass yet did wrong anyway and the other part on fire and the oil passing through you on fire fire you dip in oil people pour water you still have fire people lie on you you still a fire people all they see what kind of nasty thing about you you still on fire because patter you dip down in the oil that is give me oil in my lamp Oh hallelujah you are the weak and some time you come to we get smoky and smutty up and then go come to cut that quick polish up the glass a little bit tactical shine a little better Oh glory to God when you come to church and looking back or to cut up all the black shifty part of your life that's a good one brains but your shame we call - I know the devil can take out your light I feel left to say that back again the devil cut the cord you like you have a light you could ever tap take on that light that light is in you that like this over you that light is with you the devil can take on your light or glory to come again somebody can take it out she was so confident she said upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell could never come on come on now the gates of hell newspaper media gets a hell some wonder cover all on the data can't stop I can still run some routine blood wash Church of the Living God and you understand that you should be screaming and shouting to the top of your voice you're gonna make it you're gonna come true My Lord may be seated all right let's read something you know [Applause] God promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true way with a message to return to the original Word of God and the fate of the fathers what for here the continuation to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost amongst the people so let's break it up now he promised to send a light up of it to bring us back to original world and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost among the people with a power that will raise her above these things and take him at that time so work can't take the bright in so why the church is not crying for power because you know why they think they have it already the screwed the messed up so they kept Christ feared because I think they have it already and they got it to get but tonight I am Telling You wait for the promise of the Father Oh give the Lord some praises because it's coming who want to laugh let them laugh you wanna make fun let them fun one new name who are injured who have mighty engine who measure any temporal who have Michael and this side and gable on that side of the elements who is God who is the Holy Ghost is that all kind of revelations or all kinda thing you know yeah let's continue he said no watch let me see let me just know what you're talking about adoption you know please love a son please love a son right take him out a certain please have a ceremony before angels and please him positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you want me to be a fanatic now all this adoption talk is not a question of sonship and is a question of behavior it's not the question of Simmons and teachings and revelation speech will be any pulpit adoption is really based upon behavior I don't think you get that if that is not so then sisters can be a doctor because this is the bridge so the mighty sermon that is behind the pulpit does not what been adopted Gordana doctor listen Manila got adopted in prison and forgot to adopt the person the behavior of that person have to be examined not by men but by God so he have the Holy Spirit the tutor the guide to report back to the father on people's behavior so then he said behold I come with me my reward with me to reward every man according to his Will shall be so we don't have to boss we don't have to raise a big flag the words will speak for itself the results will speak for itself one and one will or is equal to you could never make one on one tree much stuff to add up so when you said he must I don't know if you know something not right you must not add enough he must have to add up all praising of the Lord are you with me now so the only issue become not sons either brother is a suddenly the sun little sun know it what kind do I am the issue is not sons and daughters is what kind of daughter is what kind of a son I know your son I know your daughter but what pain and that trying have to do with your behavior not belief that's a big one that's a big one let me say again not belief but behavior because a lot of people confessing beliefs but the people behave is horrible the behavior is nasty the behaviors evil and jealous and wicked the behavior is intentionally evil and they'll in church hallelujah so many acquired by the shout but a few could be called by the voice hallelujah I say this with the show-quality kinda believers william branham malachi falls short message of calls three trains but only one can go in the rapture they believe i believe a shame hallelujah it called virgins but only the wiser because a wife and foolish it's a wise behavior and foolish behavior Alleluia is a wise action and foolish actions oh come on come on now come on now a wise version is a wise version not a stupid version not the foolish version but a wise version she'd know she has to get extra oil or glory to God and she this version is prepared to do whatever is necessary oh I love that tonight whatever is necessary to
