heavenly father I thank you for guiding us together and this opportunity that we could have Fellowship around your word and every word of encouragement every word of inspiration is my goal in this Dark Hour Lord the prophet saw a vision of Hell on the earth and we are actually passing through hell almost every single day and this gross Darkness covered yet any little light any little love any little encouragement any little word from you is so precious yes get so much faults and and and contrary stuff that's going on today and to think that you're listening gracious to us to give us a word we just thank you Lord have your way tonight Lord as we look away to you in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you at this time I want to uh bring on Brother Kelly's out brother Kelly God bless you and welcome God bless you it's good to see you with a little bit um uh this game is sort of a short notice brother Ovid asked me to speak I believe it was Wednesday I think but uh honestly there was already something on my heart and so you often can you hear me brother Ovid Okay so as brother Branham has often said that their God works on both ends so there is something that happened that I really was touched by Brother Isaac's message to other week uh motives of the heart and uh so I'll speak a little bit more on that but I wanted first to acknowledge the ministry there I write brother over little little Snippets of thanks and testimonies and things centers so many wonderful services and I wanted just to thank all you brother over the pastor and brother Isaac associate pastor brother Anthony ministering the word and sometimes Wednesday night doing it all that's wonderful uh Billy Stefan uh on prayer meeting and sometimes ministering brother Gideon you're blowing our minds thank you and also it's very special brother Anthony you're playing the guitar for us on Fridays uh and when we had prayer meetings it meant so much that it still does I want to let you know that and brother Gideon sometimes you're playing the piano and singing by the Stefan uh singing one time playing the guitar and I'm grateful for that we're all grateful for that so brother Isaac's message was the motives of the heart and um I was listening to that and I was we had heard before the week before uh he came to himself as Pastor Ovid and it's like the gospel was really being made clear and preached beautifully and I heard with Isaac's message and I was like Lord he's saying so much he's saying the gospel he's telling the truth he's really dropped it in there when he said it's kind of the word something the holy ghost in your heart this is where it's at this is where all this comes together you need the the heart doctor the surgeon to come in and take care and he was preaching that and I was so uh touched but I remembered that there were times and past um some of you may remember my testimony in October in 19 2021 and uh I was in the crowd many times and heard such sermons and I was like I've heard this before I've I've heard this before I've had no change nothing's happened to me I'm still stuck I I'm still stuck in sin the same things over and over and so listening to brother Isaac I was bleeding in my heart because I said Lord what if there's some folks there like me that like I was that couldn't hear that said I've heard this all before you know they always say come up to the altar they always say you know and they're supposed to do this let the ministers you know come up pray for the holy ghost or whatever but they're actually doing the right thing and um so brother Isaac preached it perfectly and I was so grateful for that so I wanted to I was really concerned and burdened for people that were maybe there that was like I was way back when and so I wanted to I really thought boy I would love to say something to them and then lo and behold then brother Ovid says hey I'll we like for you to share a testimony and a word man on a Friday night well as he said I was already I was already ready I had all these things I wish I could tell people and basically all I can tell you is my experience um and what I have found so far and hoping that it will help you along the way these are some Footprints and the sayings of time that God has given me sure it has and maybe you can see them and take some hope if you're in a condition where you wish that you could be free you wish that you could understand what they're talking about you wish you knew what that pyramid was about you wish that you could stop you wish the condemnation would go away and so that's my heart today so I've never given a title before but my title is to those who thirst come so I took it from Isaiah 55 which is so beautiful and it says Ho everyone is thirst come you to the waters and he has no money and that's like no righteousness of your own you've got nothing good to give to God you just feel you ain't got nothing he says come and buy eat come and buy wine and milk without money and about price they said why where do you why do you spend money for that which is not bread in your labor for that this doesn't satisfy hearken diligently unto me and eat that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness so the Lord has put out a beautiful invitation for everyone and um so um in this message also I I also if I may brother Isaac is a seasoned minister and sometimes though I think we should also remember the ministers go through a lot and to appreciate them and I wanted to when I was watching the message even though he knows it I wanted to tell brother Isaac don't look at the faces don't look at the faces just preach the word it'll do the job it'll do the job don't you know don't worry because if your father brother over here it paid attention to my face you know in 2014 2016 we saw each other he had a but he doesn't I know the word has got something in it it's just super powerful um I know people say you know I'm not worthy uh I did this I can't stop doing that I quit smoking I still want to quit I still want to smoke it's still in me I I I'm a young lady but I like makeup I I want to wear a certain dress I want to dress a certain way I want to be a certain way but I don't want to but it's it's in me and I understand that I understand it's exactly what brother Isaac said it's in our hearts we're born in sin shaped in iniquity we're just that way and it does take the great heart surgeon to come in and take that out and we're going to talk about that very thing so um in my experience my problem uh I struggled for years because I was trying to make myself good enough for God I was trying to be good enough to receive the Holy Ghost I was trying to overcome I was trying everything to try to pray and I tried fasting I was one of those that way in my early days of the message read the prophets message on receive the Holy Ghost and volunteered to stay all over Christmas holidays pray every day to try to receive the Holy Ghost you know just trying but um but I was telling someone at work that's given a testimony and said you know what I was doing was you know take sin it's and you wrap it up in a suit and tie and you take it to church you know and you're supposed to really that's only Where You're Gonna Go free let's go to church you know let the ministry of the word speak to you but it year after year after year and after a while that suit and tie won't hold it no more you know God lets things happen he lets pressures happen and the Damage begin to burst and what's in your heart really comes out so uh as you all know I'll probably hear my testimony that I went really really way down but I was brought down to his brother uh Gideon called it that last cry which God bless everybody that was beautiful Wednesday and I just had nothing left I had nothing left nothing to offer God nothing so I simply said Lord I have this and I confess my sins I am right right in the bedroom next door here and just said is this what I am I can't stop it but I'm now going to accept your sacrifice that you've made for me because that's the only thing on this Earth I have and that's all I did and one day I realized everything that bothered me for decades was gone totally gone all the sins and things I couldn't get rid of were gone and I was blown away I didn't know what it was uh I couldn't understand it so one of my favorite things that brother Branham said about Paul Paul the Apostle Paul he saw the the pillar of fire you know going up to Damascus to arrest the Christians and he had this great experience of the pillar of fire and brother Branham said he went down to Arabia for I think three years or something he said what I believe he did and I believe brother Brown was speaking this because he had this experience he said he went down and checked in the scriptures see what his experience was and so Paul just didn't run off and say hey I saw the Lord and you know he went and checked it in the scriptures to make sure it was scriptural so I took that and I said well I don't know what has happened but something has changed me and I'm not sure what it is I went into the word I just started looking and it was amazing it was identified everywhere and uh was so shocked but more than anything and for those of you who struggle this is why I'm saying this um you know with with men there's all kinds of issues nowadays with uh the way ladies you know forget it you go out into the summer time everybody's dressed a certain way and it's can be for a unconverted heart uh forgive me we can be hell on Earth it's terrible and you're like I'm a Christian I'm not going to pay attention but the devils are like crawling on your like slides and I'm being very honest now after my experience it's like I'm in another world um my wife and I were out west recently and we were in the kind of tourist town it was just all kinds of stuff and I was just like it was like you felt like there were thousands of Satan's tools I started dragging thousands of men to hell and I was amazed because of my I don't feel religious I don't feel particularly anointed I don't feel special but I'm in another world I am not affected by anything around me none of this nothing and uh and it was and so I was so deeply moved by it that's when I wrote brother Ovid the testimony uh of the blood of Jesus Christ the powers and the blood and um so anyway um one thing I was trying to do prior to that I said was was works I was trying to make myself holy I could not do it so that's the thing I'll tell my friends that were in the meeting with brother Isaac you can't make yourself holy you can't do it you gotta surrender and you gotta let God just accept what he said that he provided for you that's a sacrifice a lamb sacrifice for you just accept it when you accept it from your heart he'll come right in and he'll take all that out of you so one of the things that recently this this life this being this person that's in me that come in identifies itself in the word and so one of the most recent ones is I saw beautifully it was Hebrews 4 9 for he that entered into his rest he that is entered into his rest that's the believer he has also ceased from his own works as God did from his you know in creation so I thought wow that's right I don't even try anymore it just lives itself this life that's inside lives itself out so it's a different thing so I'm saying this to give hope not to say because I I didn't think it was possible I never thought it'd be here but I am so I would say another thing that when I was in my condition and I felt I truly didn't know if I died where I was going to go but I also did not believe I was desperate enough because you got to get desperate you got to get desperate you got to get desperate and you affect a while you're well I'm just not desperate enough that's why I can't ever receive the Holy Ghost that's why I can't ever change God doesn't see me desperate enough but I found out you know what it's not what we see it's what God sees he saw I thought you you you can't figure out what you think God thinks it's no way he saw it and he saw it and he knew I was ready and he knew I was ready to die to myself so what is death to self I know at least one part of it is and it's and greatest battle ever fought I believe you believe God's word be for your own thoughts before your own reasoning you take his word above your own thoughts your own reasoning because your own reasoning will say you know I did it again I messed up again I did that thing I'm ashamed I can't talk to God because I'm sure he's mad at me and you're like I'll I'd like to ask well pray tell how do you know what God thinks how do you know you know the only way you can know what God thinks about you is not your imagination the only way you can think is the Bible that's his thoughts about you and then he sent us a prophet to reveal this word right here in that word he revealed and shows what he thinks of you you go in there and see what he thinks of you as Satan will show you the bad stuff no no no you stick with the good because the prophet stays if you watch he doesn't preach it's encouraging all the time so I'm saying don't try to guess what God thinks of you you know you've got to stick with the word take your thoughts okay that's the next one okay Isaiah 55 7. love this one he says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man now that's that's a you know all there's none righteous you know everyone sins short of the glory of God and all that born it's in Chapin iniquity and the unrighteous man his thoughts let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man whose thoughts he didn't say his unrighteous thoughts he said his thoughts period forsake your thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy on him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon so you got to forget what you're thinking about yourself and what the devil is telling you about yourself he don't think that way about you he made a way for you to come in okay um and this is something that also is true and this is from the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way to say incredible beautiful message brother Brandon says but sometimes when God performs something and does something we ask for it it comes in an unexpected way and sometimes in an unexpected place and at an unexpected time but God will answer his own way if you'll just believe it so that's what happened to me I was totally unexpected gave up completely just I'm I'm yours I don't know what they do I accept what you gave me in unexpected time unexpected way I myself felt nothing saw nothing is just something changed a Life come out of began to live that I did not I couldn't explain so um so I talked about Paul Arabia um one thing that when my wife and I went out west and all those situations were out there with the way people were and you know there were the LGBT and all that all that stuff going on there and I was so divorced from the world it was that's the only way I can say and I came back and I was so amazed and I realized in that really really dark situation the gospel in me shown really really bright it's shown the brightest in that dark place you know and we didn't go into into any place we're just walking up and down the street you know maybe it was a restaurant um I would also say that there is um there is power in the spoken word um when I after I was I'll call it saved because I was I was saved from sin and misery and death hell and a grave and uh I look back at messages that uh brother Ovid started playing from years previous and I was like oh my goodness he was saying exactly what was going to happen to me it was just exactly you know he would say you're going to be delivered and you know all these things and I was like yeah yeah I was I was you know so there is something in the word that is alive and you hear the minister speaking it but it's actually alive and it's looking it's a seed it's looking for a round it's looking for moisture is looking for some place to grow and so brother Branham said um it's an unchangeable guy working an expectable way the same same message it's talking about basically the power of word under inspiration uh well anyway he says every promise has the same power of creation behind it he was talking about the power of the word when the world was created said every promise has the same power of creation behind it uh that God's word did at the beginning if we believe it to be the word of God so it's unbelievable but every promise in here has the same power of Creation in it so he's a moisture uh it falls into the ground a ground that can create this kind of moisture or nourishment around the promise of God it will bring forth every promise the Bible made it's just that he says why the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you just look at it and take care of the word just right so when the minister the pastor speaks those are those are inspired living words that go out to us that's what changed me because I was so messed up and I'm like I would hear something about the blood and it just struck me and a huge one small sentence whole service and it was the blood is still relevant you don't hear much about that anymore but the blood is still relevant amen something in me caught that in the midst of my despair that really you mean you mean I can walk forward even in my condition under the blood the way I am and it'll cover me and it it set me in in motion to start getting up and walking even though I was busted up inside and uh so the word spoken has power that's promises in the Bible have they are living they have Spirit they have life they just kind of hit the ground the right place so forgive me I forgot to look at my time brother always let me know if I go too far um so you might ask some of those maybe that were in brother Isaac's audience so why can't I see all this you know you know the Lord said it set the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God well there's my wife and I we went to see the Grand Canyon for the first time it's a huge huge chasm in the mid middle of the Earth it's 18 miles wide at this widest point it's a mile deep it's just massive and brother banham says that we are sin places a Chasm between us and God that we absolutely positively cannot get back to God because of this huge Chasm that would separates us and it's even mentioned it seems to me in the Lord when he talks about Lazarus uh you know after he dies he's in the bosom of Abraham and the rich man is in hell and a rich man asked Abraham Sin Sin Lazarus to give me some water because these Flames torment me and he's basically saying well even if we wanted to we couldn't because there's a giant Gulf between us so like even on the other side this Chasm that separates men from God that are in sin is there but no Lord Jesus by his death burial Resurrection then he bridged that for us so when you accept the Lord Jesus simply on the basis I mean you can't use your head well why did he no he just say Lord you said it there's a sacrifice for me I accept it and I thank you for it he takes you across that Chasm to him and you're no longer separated from God and I can tell you the truth I I've Marvel every day every day of of this experience just in me having a burden and then brother over reach out and say hey we'd like to share your word that's that's the kind of thing I'm sort of getting used to because it happens a lot and um so you might ask okay so how do I uh you know let's see here so he said except a man be born again you can't see it so you're on this other side this Castle you can't see nothing because you're separated from God so the question is then a person would say well how do I get born again and said so the question would be look for number one thing what is the birth and uh I defer to brother Ovid for anything you know if I go off a little bit or whatever but I'm trying to this is what I'm just digging into the word like Paul did and this is what I found he said first brother Branham how can I overcome it's a message first under justification the water baptism second under the new birth of Wesley sanctification so he identifies the new birth with sanctification and my experience is that's what it is because something changed me and he says that later and I was completely sanctified which he said sanctification with cleanses and then thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit put that Sanctified vessel into service so I'm just I'm not there I will be I'm so happy to be on the road that's all I'm happy to be on the road so he said well how do you get Sanctified how you how do you get Sanctified this born again and brother Brandon says you say brother banham when I can quit smoking when I can quit drinking when I can straighten this thing up I'll do it and he says oh it'll never be done right you will never that's the brother random you will never be able to do it why don't you just just come the way you are smoke and drinking just come the way you are and by faith go to that stream the flowing room Supply then redeeming love to be your theme shall be till you die why take a substitute why I try to get it by your church like you know doing in the Methodist or whatever why to come in because why try to come in because you quit drinking or quit lying come by the way of perfection now I used to stumble over the word Perfection I used to think oh I could never be you know you look at yourself but he's not talking about you he says come by the way of perfection four by one sacrifice he the Lord has perfected forever those that are sanctified so it's not you trying to be perfect it's him perfecting you because brother bam said if he said be you therefore perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect that he had to make a way for you to do that because you know he knew we couldn't do it so then brother Randall says how do I get sanctified he says confess your sins in the presence of the blood of Jesus and the life that come from that blood when the Lord died on the cross comes back to the worshiper and sanctifies him from the desires or the things of the world for so for you know I keep hearing sisters and you know that want the mini skirts and things you know that's in your heart that's what happens he sanctifies you from the desires or the things of the world for by that all sufficient sacrifice he has Sanctified us one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and then he quotes Romans 8 now there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus to them that walk not after the flesh but the spirit if you're trying to walk by the spirit and still lusting for the flesh to sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently applied to you but this is true right here I used to read this in the Bible but it says the worshiper weren't once purged has no more desire of sin so I tell my precious sister she has uh you know trouble she smoked all her life I said here it is because I know for a fact that you'd have no more desire for the things that used to plague you as a sinner it's gone the blood completely takes it away so then brother Branham says so my question then you say so brother Kelly how do I know that I have been born again so brother Branham says he's like someone's asking a question how will I know then brother Branham that I'm in there that's in the body you know born again watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull that means like I used to just fighting and fighting trying not to sin trying to be holy trying to stay in the atmosphere trying to do this trying to do that all these dead works he says see if it lives out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull see then you're doing it but don't try to do it don't you ever did you ever try he says yeah don't what's this brother Branham he says it's like putting a uh um a little baby's arm in in the sleeve hole you know like putting a coat on a little baby he's the babies he's just up and down and over everywhere else see he can't do it he's too small you know he's put your coat on honey but he can't do it his little arms up and down it takes your Steady Hand so you know he's talking about a toddler trying to put on his coat he can't do it so he says how glad I am that I can just yield my hand to the father and say Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put the coat on me I quit trying just let him do it see if the baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it and he's just everywhere he can't do it so he says neither can you and neither can I but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him here Lord here I am just let me be nothing I yield you put my hand in the right place that's the victory he says that's overcoming so the thing he says you have to overcome and I found this to be true is yourself your idea you're a saying surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't so this is one thing I have so greatly my wife and I talk about often in the prayer meetings that the pastor says if you don't feel desperate ask the Lord to make you desperate if you don't feel you know a burden for prayer ask the Lord for a burn for prayer and I remember uh brother a Sigmar colombrenner you remember me passed away a few years ago a couple of years and brother Ovid played a testimony of his that was there in uh in Trinidad and he said that uh he wanted to receive the Holy Ghost but he couldn't repent he said I was like the Son of a Preacher you know almost like I never did anything wrong it's kind of way I think he was saying I couldn't repent and so he was in a I think a Christian business kind of prayer group or something and one of the sisters said well you have to ask the Lord to help you repent and he did and the Lord helped him repent so I'm saying whatever you know I don't feel like that well ask and he will answer he's very quiet but he answers okay here we go so when you're uh born again then so you removed from Romans 7 to Romans 8. Romans 7 I try and I try and I try and I try and I fail and but in Romans 8 the law of life in Christ Jesus because our life comes into you has Set Me Free from the law of sin and death and another one of my favorites that I've read for many years I didn't get it but of him or ye in Christ Jesus so Christ Jesus who is Made Who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption and I used to read that and didn't quite get it but he's saying that Jesus the Lord is our righteousness and in Isaiah it says a couple of places says um I believe it's basically that in one shall say in the Lord is my strength and in the Lord is my righteousness and so that's what it is is his life his righteousness in you living its way out so um I will say this also then so we looked at what born again is a look at what how you get there and of course these are just what I have found the Lord does the work I can't do anything for you no more than but I just want to encourage you that the gospel is real it really can be born again you really can get started and so this is something I've got a few notes on my phone that I wanted to read um one thing is that I used to way overthink and brother Brown said you know we're so educated these days you know he said to go to places in Africa where there was just you know Natives and they didn't have the stuff that we have and they just believed you know but we over educate we think too much we got to figure everything out and that's a big problem and uh so he said it's in God hiding himself in simplicity we know that God is so great do we expect it just fill in the blank whatever it is we expected to be some great something and we miss the simple scene we stumble over Simplicity that's how we miss God Is by stumbling over Simplicity God is so simple let that one soak in my friends because he is God is so simple until the scholars of these days which were all educated and all days miss him a million miles because in our intellects they they know there's that that there is nothing like him so great but in Revelation he makes it so simple they go Plumb over the top of it and miss it and uh I remember brother Olu in one of the tapes we watched I think last winter he's like the gospel's so simple I was like yeah it is so and then now let's get to one more thing and that is you may say Okay born again and all that so what's this got to do with that pyramid we see up there on the hanging on the right side as we look at the pulpit you know the sport again thing how does that fit into that pyramid so brother random now we're born again sanctification now there's there's more to it I'm just talking about getting started you know being free getting delivered he said a lot of people go up this is a statue of a perfect man he's talking about the pyramid a lot of people go up to the Altar and pray and say Lord forgive me and a great experience of sanctification comes upon them and things then you have a great time and get up from The Altar and you go back and say bless God I got it and you know you just started to a place you can grow you ain't done nothing yet see you've only laid the foundation so what's he talking about still talking about the pyramid because we're trying to put what's this born-again thing have to do with that pyramid on the wall he said now notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith so that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of it all so I don't know how to put it properly but when you're born again you're placed on the foundation of that pyramid you're looking on the wall up there and by the band said that that begins to add to itself you know I mean there's things we do of course forgiving everything but and you know and that's where I'm at and I see things in myself that I never thought I would see coming out so I'm also happy when I saw that I just I'm here years looking at the pyramid you know man everybody else is way up there and I'm not even on it I'm way down here in the dirt you just intellectually thinking about it so he said now notice you must be born again that is he explains it changed there's got to be a change the blood of Jesus Christ now this one's from the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost given foreign man I'm sorry the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sinning upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God and then we become a dwelling place for God so so that's the relationship you say what's born again got to do that's what it has to do with the pyramid when you're born again you're placed in faith on the foundation and you've got the most wonderful opportunity ever given to mankind to be able to grow into faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and so forth so um I think that's pretty much it but there was one scripture that um it's Revelations 3 when the Lord's addressing the angel to the Church of led to see and and this scripture uh used to scare me but I'm just saying there's so much more now you're talking about born again but he says uh to the angel of the church or the laodiceans and of course he's writing the Lord's addressing us because that's at the last age that's our age these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know that works that you're neither cold nor hot I would that you were cold or hot so then because you are lukewarm and either cold or hot I will spew you out of my mouth you know I used to cringe real bad because you say I'm rich and increase with Goods that have need of nothing and know not that you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked and I looked at that this last time and I thought oh wow that was me I was wretched miserable poor blind and naked and you know if you feel that way about yourself you know what a blessing it is to know that you're miserable and poor and blind and naked that's a blessing um I know it's kind of hard to think of it that way but a lot of people don't see it he said I counsel and this was a blessing I said the Lord himself come down hid in a very simple man that we know is William Branham and he come down and he counseled us and he he said I and no other age where he come and said I counsel you you know what it's like to sit with the pastor and get some counsel this is the Lord Jesus I counsel you I said wow the Lord Jesus is counseling me and uh I counsel thee to buy me gold try it in the fire that you may be rich and white Raymond that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear and anoint your eyes and eyes after that you may see and and he said as many as I love I rebuke and Jason be zealous therefore and repent and that's the love of a father the best father there ever was is the one that corrects you and keeps you on the right track and uh that's tremendous so yeah here's the beautiful part behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice oh and open the door I will come into him in to him and sup with him and he with me and then here that's where we're coming into him coming into us and then he steps right up into our age of adoption to him that overcome overcome it I will grant this set with me and my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what this spirit says to the church so he that overcomes I'll Grant him to sit in with me and my throne is the son's name being just as good on the check as his daddy's so we've got some big stuff in front of us so that's what I wanted to say I wanted to encourage you all that those had are that are trying to live right and struggling they don't know how to get there God will answer you he sees it and you cannot look at yourself you got to look at what he says about you in the word and believe that you know don't don't listen to anything else because it's impossible for you to know outside of the word what he thinks of you anyway God bless you and uh I pray that this will help somebody because I am blown away with the gospel I I used to lose brother Brown say oh I read my Bible every day at lunch and I used to go how in the world did you read your Bible every day at lunch now it's I read my by I mean I want to know so much more about this Lord who saved me this I can't get enough of him so you will be there too I encourage you God bless you and thank you thank you brother over praise the Lord God bless you brother Kelly we certainly appreciate we give you a lot of praise praise God for our brother tonight I know that it was something that is inspiring and there's a word from the Lord to encourage all of us about the blood of Jesus and you know it was amazing because um my reader's here for you what he sent I just want to read this here he said this every service we are privilege to have deserved some sort of testimony of Thanksgiving but the Lord is so gracious and sends us so much service after service it's nearly impossible to get something written before he has another blessing at hand but a knight deserves at least a woe and a praise God the Beauty and the Simplicity of the inspiration given to brother Gideon was stunning we are so sincerely blessed may the Lord bless you all brother Kelly so I reply to him I say thank you it's very encouraging I would like you to give a testimony and share a word maybe on Friday before prayer meeting you say he said I I'm sending a small squeaky voice truthfully I would love to is there but um and so on either so it was quite quite an experience even for me um that's the true life out and I was he imagine I I'm asking him inviting him and I am stunned at his reaction is because he is Prime and ready to go to share and I was praying for the special service today and I was praying that God be glorified and that Jesus name be magnified and you know what I look forward to hear is to hear about Jesus Christ you know we talk about the prophet we talk about God for William Branham and so on but the truth is brother Branham came to point us to Jesus Christ so when I hear somebody giving testimony about the Lord Jesus how about the blood of Jesus this is something you don't hear much in this message about the blood of Jesus and that is where you get the legalism you get the people judging and condemning others with shock and who can't make it and as if they Alberta Kelly were sharing like as if they know what God thinks and what God sees and like The Prodigal Son um we could see what we want about his behavior in terms of him going out and and spending his father's money he didn't earn it it was something from his father and when you really see her in the older brother was was in the worst condition and yet he was the one who had the testimony I never did that I never did that I never seen I never did that whatever whatever but he had a heart issue and he had issue was exposed when his riotous brothers came back home and sometimes as we see like how God said he would leave in 1909 and go after that one and if you have a problem and an issue with with that one coming on on the shepherd's shoulder and getting what they call a shoulder ride you know and and and you could say well I never get that right before and if I get that kind of comfort and encouragement and what the material is God said he will leave the 1909 it's it's a it's a powerful lesson and what this does is could we really write somebody off could we really say this one can't make it and this one could make it and and but the Kelly's testimony is a powerful one because what you see there is the operation of God it's not a matter of stopping smoking stopping drinking stopping running around it's a matter of something happening on the inside that you can't explain when Bob ramadi 10 vision and they were passing through that little room and the sick past you on the other side come out here they said what happened I said we don't know I was crippled for 20 years now I'm you know something just happened and this is the sort of testimony we want to hear we want to see we want to see and this ties in with what guinea but again is not a time for giving up it's the time to fight back it's a time to pass on it's a time to encourage your own self and say you know what God you who called me and some time ago we talk about the Anchor Point when the devil have you all better than you all confusing you go right back right back there's an anchor point of your colon there's an anchor point where God spoke to you whether it's 13 years old 14 years old 12 15 20. when God did with your heart yes you may have Street and you have fallen in the different conditions and stuff but if you go right back and pick up that Anchor Point it was never a man a man was not responsible for your Anchor Point somebody could have given you a book share your testimony play a tip or whatever it is give it a Bible you read and you come to the Lord but that Anchor Point was the operation of God and that is where after many years we forgot we forget about it we we make light of it and of course the burden of the enemy and with reasoning and this is a powerful thing he expressed tonight that really die not have to do with you accepting God's thoughts as he taught to receive because the devil job you see the devil have nothing original so he's asking of Eve what did God see is not intentional to learn of God no it's it's a see how you could twist it and this is the job twist and and that is where God has to help us with these element to try to see regardless of what somebody carry on with what is a heart what is the intention what is their motive what is the objective well Kelly went through stuff and he is burdened to just tell himself you know their Artisan is true the others will write there about it he said snap out of it will take more than that you know it's almost like hell is the house of hell and people are under more pressure than we think people are no more strained and stressed and we think the milk and smile the mother God bless the mother hallelujah praise I thank you but they're under pressure and and that is why we ought to really sincerely pray for another I thank God for tonight I thank God sometimes we try to do something a little different so it was not the normal routine of things and I trust then that you would listen to it again are we going to put it up and take heed because God is speaking I see God using but either called using but uh Anthony called using for the Stephen called using bergerian God is using he has no other voice but your voice your ears and hands and feet he wants to use you of course the devil will say you are not usable or or why uh we'll look at the condition I'm in there's no way God could use me but sometimes God take it through stuff and the stuff that God take you through is to help somebody else I remember somebody came to me counseling abused as a child and said but what if God have your abuse condition to help other abused people because they have people that have been abuse and they don't want to manage it or go through their mind and thoughts and the stress of the whole experience but here it is somebody who gets strength and inner strength and say you know what I've been there and God has made me whole you see and I talk to people I say you know they get a cut on the outside together in your hand you could Stitch it up you could see it heal up and whatnot but what about the inside hurts what about the inside Cuts who sees that is it really healed and that's why I love the question will you remember all whole to be wholesome in Mind and Spirit not one put up not Twisted not religious not not fanatical but balance all orange not not not not lemon and tangelo sweet on one side and so on your next side come on the Middle with the orange it's tough to find out right now because it has some crazies out here and we don't want you to be crazy right so you cannot self-righteous yourself and think that yourself right but you could trust God trust in his blood trust in his Providence and his ability the one and the Bible says who started the work is able to complete it at the end that is Heavenly Father we thank you tonight and as the Believers pray Lord may they confess their sins and may the crowd unto you and call upon your name this may be a lash cry this may be the door just before that breakthrough father that that you sent brother Kelly is out here tonight to share this Lord and he says God works on both sides I just love it because that's how you work you put it in my heart to ask him and he was ready to receive it act upon it Lord it was just yesterday oh God and after the Wednesday night service and I could just send him a message and so on today's Friday and he was ready to share and poured his heart and I told him take the limit to share what you wanted to share he has that Liberty that's what we we do father we want to know what's in people's heart and he has a burden that other people might be delivered and the experience you have he says he's in another world and this is where brother Branham lives another world unless where the bride is going to be in the little world in this world but there's another world but Jesus said he prayed for them not that they'll be taken out of the world but to keep them in the world oh God we pass through hell every single day but we pray for preservation we pray for deliverance we pray for restoration we pray is that those who struggle they can't seem to snap out of it may they snap of it I'll snap out of it tonight here is a genuine testimony Lord you give yourself some money about two three years ago and it still holds it's not something fraudulent or something temporary is a work that you have done there's a work that have a witness it is a work that you have confirmed and father the work that you began is it it shows up in you it reflects you oh God you don't heal people half week you will

man is hard man don't fear God no man and he's a hard man Everybody by by psychology or by by the man behavior they don't want to approach that man but this woman have burdened her condition was so strong that she didn't she ignored completely the report of that man the reputation of that man and she persevered and the Lord said hear what that unjust just said shall not the Lord Avengers do they cry long unto him day and night day and night day and night and here we are in this in this year 2023 amidst all the the the social media I miss all the voices I mean it's all the distractions we

become a testimony a testimony of God and Lord sometimes we could ignore or Overlook the scriptures they say until his time came talking about Joseph the word of the Lord Charlie Lord it was a sin it wasn't conditions around the word of the Lord and we sometimes missed that part that the word is here to try us the word itself our own word or whether we're going to really believe or we're going to just live around the edge you call a people to receive a message and believe a message God when you're told the prophet pick up the tenant right you said the secret is the word is in the bride and she
