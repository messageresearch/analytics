[32:36] for us to really see Jesus okay so this
[32:42] morning I a thought be strong and of
[32:45] good
[32:47] courage and I want to speak a little bit
[32:50] about returning to the
[32:51] landmark based upon the scripture that
[32:54] we read remove not the ancient landmark
[32:58] which thy fathers have set
[33:01] amen a landmark is an object or feature
[33:05] of a landscape or Tong that is easily
[33:08] seen and recognized from a
[33:11] distance especially one that enables
[33:13] someone to establish their location amen
[33:18] you you can't even know where you're
[33:19] going unless you know where you
[33:21] at and based upon where you act you will
[33:23] know what direction to turn if it's East
[33:25] West North and South amen so when you
[33:28] come to church you come to find out
[33:29] where you
[33:31] at Landmark is also a marker an
[33:34] indicator a Guiding Light a signal a
[33:37] beacon is also the boundary or area of
[33:41] land or an object marking this all that
[33:44] pertain to Landmark boundary marker Dem
[33:47] marcor boundary line
[33:50] picket it's also an event or Discovery
[33:53] marking an important stage or turning
[33:55] point in something that's a landmark a
[33:58] turning point in your life a landmark
[34:01] when God arrest you and and put a stop
[34:03] right where you are and and it has a
[34:06] change all that's a landmark for you
[34:09] isn't that right it's a milestone a
[34:11] watershed a critical point and historic
[34:14] event a major event a crisis of divine
[34:17] now I want to go to Joshua 1 we know the
[34:20] scripture but I want you to listen again
[34:23] Joshua 1 chapter 1 after the death of
[34:25] Moses the servant of the Lord it came to
[34:27] pass the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[34:30] of n Moses Minister saying Moses my
[34:32] servant is dead now therefore arise go
[34:34] over this Jordan thou and all this
[34:36] people unto the land which I do give
[34:37] them even to the children of Israel
[34:40] every place that the sto of your foot
[34:41] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[34:43] you as I sent to Moses he the boundaries
[34:47] from the Wilderness of this Lebanon even

[43:16] position because it's not like Joshua
[43:18] has done this before everything is brand
[43:21] new he's now about to cross over amen
[43:25] now about to lead a people in into a
[43:27] land that he himself never walked
[43:30] on every step he made as a leader had to
[43:34] be a step of Fate every step he made it
[43:38] had to take some courage to say you know

[44:12] promise you could we hear a shout in the
[44:16] [Music]
[44:21] [Applause]
[44:25] house so I realize that we have to get
[44:27] real
[44:29] radical oh yeah amen we have to get a
[44:32] different approach alog together to what
[44:35] belongs to no you're not asking for what
[44:36] don't belong to you you know you see
[44:38] sickness don't belong to you you mean
[44:40] negative that don't belong to you
[44:42] depression and frustration that's not
[44:43] yours so we're not talking about what
[44:45] doesn't belong to you we talking about
[44:47] the Breakthrough and the deliverance and
[44:49] the Victory and the overcoming and the
[44:51] power over the lust of the eyes and the
[44:53] power over the lust of the Flesh and the
[44:54] power over the pride of life I'm talking
[44:56] about the these are the things that
[44:58] belong to you oh your possession is not
[45:00] just natural hallelujah praise God give
[45:03] the Lord a shout listen the world we
[45:06] going through is a real world this is
[45:08] not our real world oh hallelujah praise
[45:12] God God tell him watch uh only thou be
[45:16] th strong courageous verse 7 that thou
[45:17] May observe to do watch according to all
[45:19] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[45:22] thee turn here we go not from the right
[45:26] or to the left
[45:28] in other words don't let nobody shake
[45:29] you off the mark that the fathers have
[45:33] set don't let nobody turn you from the
[45:36] left or the right hallelujah it's not
[45:39] what this Minister feel or this pastor
[45:41] feel or this group feel is what the word
[45:44] says and as long as the word said it I
[45:46] could stand on it I could prophesy on it
[45:49] I could die on it or I'll rise on it as
[45:53] long as God said it that's it
[46:00] oh Hallelujah well I feel that's your
[46:03] feeling well I think that's your thought
[46:05] but what did God
[46:07] [Applause]
[46:13] say we have to come to that spot you
[46:16] know because some of you like to talk
[46:17] what the doctor say but what did God
[46:19] say then you got to challenge what the
[46:22] doctor say by what God say by his
[46:24] stripes I I am healed
[46:27] that's what God Said and when you come
[46:29] to that spot where you're returning back
[46:31] to walking by
[46:36] faith when brother bam claimed his
[46:38] healing he was eating and he had stomach
[46:41] problem and he was vomiting back out and
[46:43] come back out he push it back down
[46:44] because he was believing and acting as
[46:46] if it already
[46:49] done he was feeling worse but he was
[46:52] claiming the best he was feeling bad but
[46:54] claiming the promise of the father oh
[46:57] come on now that he's a Healer come on
[46:58] say Amen
[46:59] [Applause]
[47:04] somebody you always have to act before
[47:06] God
[47:09] react I shout it out again you always
[47:12] have to act before God reacts because
[47:16] your God coming to you is his reaction
[47:18] to your action you can't sit and do
[47:21] nothing that's why God tell Joshua every
[47:24] place you put your foot is
[47:28] come on
[47:29] now do I hear Believers in the
[47:37] house I want you to reject your present
[47:40] condition I want you to arrest your
[47:42] situation I want you to say to yourself
[47:44] the devil is truly a liar and a bluff I
[47:47] want you to believe that you could get
[47:48] your own I want you to believe that you
[47:51] could move into an actual possession
[47:53] from profession I want you to believe
[47:55] that you could be empowered

[51:45] child every day is not easy but the joy
[51:47] of the child takes you above the pain of
[51:50] the strain Oh Glory to God the pain and

[1:02:04] here you may be seated Oh Glory to God
[1:02:09] you get in an atmosphere where people
[1:02:10] are disbelieving and fasting and St
[1:02:12] among one another arguing whether they
[1:02:13] belong to this church you will never hat
[1:02:15] out Christians all you hat out is
[1:02:17] sectarians bunch of denominational
[1:02:20] hateful division people praise God like
[1:02:24] Donald Trump they want to build walls
[1:02:27] but there's a prophecy against walls but
[1:02:29] brandham said the
[1:02:32] walls will come down it just need Joshua
[1:02:36] it just need the captain of the host it
[1:02:38] just need a bunch of people who willing
[1:02:40] to take orders to walk to walk to walk
[1:02:44] down them Jericho walls it just it just
[1:02:46] a thing of
[1:02:52] people they want a pastor they want the
[1:02:54] best educated man the best dressed one
[1:02:57] the one who can get on the platform and
[1:02:58] look the best great tall guy six-footer
[1:03:01] ha flowing like that he said brother you
[1:03:03] got to get away you got away from the
[1:03:05] human line I'd rather have a man preach
[1:03:07] to me with a pair of overalls on with
[1:03:10] mud on his shoes and know God that all
[1:03:13] the DD and PhD and whatever you could
[1:03:15] put before me get back to the human line
[1:03:17] where's the Full Gospel where's divine
[1:03:20] power where it's divine revelation where
[1:03:22] it's inspiration upon the promises
[1:03:25] because Peter by these promises that's
[1:03:27] what you come to church for you don't
[1:03:29] come to church to hear some dream or
[1:03:31] some idea or talk about Pluto and Mars
[1:03:33] and Jupiter that's not what they come
[1:03:35] the church
[1:03:42] for so we notice Jehosaphat had seen the
[1:03:45] results from the kind of
[1:03:48] life from his father when he served the
[1:03:50] Lord and when he didn't serve the Lord
[1:03:53] so all of that together taking us under
[1:03:55] under consideration Jehoshaphat had
[1:03:58] purpose in his heart to serve the Lord
[1:04:00] and to cling to the things that his
[1:04:02] father did at the beginning this is
[1:04:05] Jehovah
[1:04:06] jfat I like that at the beginning in
[1:04:08] other words he went back to the old
[1:04:10] landmark and then they clean out the
[1:04:12] rose it will be good for Pentecost to go
[1:04:15] back to the old Landmark it will be good
[1:04:17] for all of us to go back to the old
[1:04:18] landmark and clean out the rose what
[1:04:22] would happen if actually the Church went
[1:04:26] back to the old Landmark you talk about
[1:04:29] a cleaning up there already be one a
[1:04:31] Pentecostal to the sure word how many
[1:04:33] knows that true how people would be
[1:04:36] acting different yes sir Here We Go
[1:04:38] dressing different amen talking
[1:04:41] different it just would be altogether a
[1:04:44] different church if we went back to the
[1:04:46] old Landmark where we started from so
[1:04:50] God blessed him here we go God will
[1:04:53] bless anyone
[1:04:56] who will go back to the old landmark of
[1:04:58] the Bible amen and start from the Bible
[1:05:02] not according to theology with the lot
[1:05:04] of theology has come to the message now
[1:05:06] but some manmade theology but the true
[1:05:09] Bible theology that starts from the old
[1:05:12] landmark and move up God will move with
[1:05:15] you so God begin to bless Jehoshaphat
[1:05:18] and the first thing you know he begin to
[1:05:20] prosper
[1:05:23] him and I've noticed something but
[1:05:25] people with Prosper prosperity and
[1:05:28] people with big churches and the the
[1:05:29] tendency is to become like like they are
[1:05:32] God they are they are uh like
[1:05:36] independent in themselves like they
[1:05:37] their own absolute and so on B say a
[1:05:40] trap ministers feel that they could do
[1:05:42] anything I get away with it he said but
[1:05:43] you must still continue serving God it's
[1:05:46] God that we are serving he told David I
[1:05:48] took you from feeding sheep to serve my
[1:05:50] people and so on is God that take us and
[1:05:52] bless us and place us is God doing that
[1:05:54] you know you get this you get that you
[1:05:56] study and have your education and you
[1:05:58] get his job is that right and a stroke
[1:06:01] taken the morning you have what job
[1:06:03] something happen and God FL your
[1:06:04] straight hospital bed what job you have
[1:06:06] so you better start to worship and
[1:06:07] praise God for health for strength for
[1:06:13] Grace so you can't go in the power of
[1:06:15] your own might so what josepher begin to
[1:06:17] prosper almost done and he built up
[1:06:19] garrisons here we go he began to
[1:06:22] prosper and he built up all the
[1:06:26] garrisons so that the uncircumcised
[1:06:29] could not come in and that's what the
[1:06:32] churches need today is a Garrison of the
[1:06:36] oldtime apostolic teaching yes sir so
[1:06:40] this lukewarm formal in and out up and
[1:06:43] down doesn't get into our church amen
[1:06:45] what I say he say that's right that's
[1:06:48] right we have permitted too many things
[1:06:50] to creep in Brethren too many things
[1:06:52] that we left the old Landmark from the
[1:06:54] beginning to creep in amen we have never
[1:06:57] gared the church brother the time has
[1:07:00] come we in the last age we in the atomic
[1:07:03] age the time has come that they got a
[1:07:06] weapon that can shake this world from
[1:07:07] the orbit in 5 minutes into the Sun and
[1:07:10] cause a total anation they couldn't have
[1:07:12] done it before but the time has come the
[1:07:14] time has come for falling away the Bible
[1:07:16] said except they come of Falling Away
[1:07:18] the manine won't reveal himself the time
[1:07:20] has come for signs to follow the
[1:07:22] Believers we are the end time we in the
[1:07:24] latter rain we at a time when men will
[1:07:26] be hey High minded lovers of Pleasures
[1:07:28] one lovers of God truth Breakers and
[1:07:30] false accusers the time has come when
[1:07:33] they are teaching doctrines of devils
[1:07:35] perverting the Bible teaching into
[1:07:38] theories and theologies to draw groups
[1:07:41] of people away after them but the time
[1:07:43] has come that God will gather his church
[1:07:45] together under the one great Banner of
[1:07:47] the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his
[1:07:49] powers among them and the great signs
[1:07:52] and wonders will take place the time has
[1:07:54] come the the time has come for the
[1:07:57] Pentecostal Church to make a stand the
[1:07:59] time has come to circumcise the church
[1:08:01] and cut out all this foolishness the
[1:08:04] time has come to go back to the old
[1:08:05] Landmark the time has come out for the
[1:08:07] outpouring the time has come to
[1:08:09] Gathering the people the time has come
[1:08:11] for Jesus to come time is be here to
[1:08:13] give all his rewards Oh Glory to God
[1:08:18] hallelujah he said brother be careful
[1:08:20] that your clown isn't set on someone
[1:08:22] head the time has come where the end
[1:08:25] time time if they ever was going to do
[1:08:27] anything Brethren we're going to have to
[1:08:28] do it now because the time is hum Oh
[1:08:32] Glory to God hallelujah do you believe
[1:08:36] it am praise God so brother talk about
[1:08:39] the Waters of separation and then is a
[1:08:41] kitchen where you feed on the word you
[1:08:43] eat the next place is a kind of
[1:08:46] relationship of this type where you
[1:08:47] embrace your wife you stand there maybe
[1:08:49] in the paror you put your arms around
[1:08:51] her you tell her you lover her she's
[1:08:52] going to be the most darling in the
[1:08:54] world you have your marriage vow and so
[1:08:56] on and whatnot and then you are ready to
[1:08:58] enter into real Fellowship excuse me for
[1:09:00] this rude expression but that's not
[1:09:02] complete yet Fellowship complete can
[1:09:06] only come through relationship and the
[1:09:08] only way you can completely fellowship
[1:09:10] with your wife as your wife she never
[1:09:12] become your complete Fellowship to you
[1:09:14] until she has an abide in a relationship
[1:09:17] and that's the bedroom that's where life
[1:09:19] begins and that's the way it is with the
[1:09:21] church today we can never take Creeds
[1:09:23] and things and ever bring back real
[1:09:25] genuine Fellowship until we come into a
[1:09:27] relationship with God to be born Sons
[1:09:30] and Daughters of God you say that's rude
[1:09:32] preacher but it's the truth oh praise
[1:09:35] God what you need here in this Valley is
[1:09:38] an oldfashioned God sent sky blue sin
[1:09:42] killing religion the power of the Gospel
[1:09:44] back in the church again back to the
[1:09:46] blood of the Lord Jesus into Fellowship
[1:09:49] by relationship not Fellowship because
[1:09:52] you're in this church or in any church
[1:09:55] but Fellowship because you have a
[1:09:56] relationship with Jesus Christ may the
[1:09:59] Lord bless you let's all stand praise

[1:15:19] amen so I'd like to go straight to the
[1:15:22] scripture reading three portions of
[1:15:25] scripture reading from Romans 8 reading
[1:15:27] from 2 Peter 3 and also reading
[1:15:31] Revelation
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:35] 21 thank you
[1:15:47] musicians reading
[1:15:49] Romans chapter 8 and reading verse 14
[1:15:57] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:16:00] God they are the sons of God for ye have
[1:16:04] not received a spirit of bondage again
[1:16:06] to fear but ye have received a spirit of
[1:16:09] adoption whereby we cry ABA
[1:16:12] father the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:16:15] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:16:17] of God and if children then ears ears of
[1:16:21] God and Joint ears with Christ if so be
[1:16:24] that we s uer with him that we may be
[1:16:27] also glorified together for I reckon
[1:16:31] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:16:33] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:16:36] glory which shall reveal shall be
[1:16:38] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:16:41] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:16:44] the manifestation of the sons of God I
[1:16:48] reading second Peter chapter
[1:16:52] 3 and reading from verse
[1:16:57] 1 2 Peter 3 and reading from verse verse
[1:17:04] one this Second Epistle beloved I now
[1:17:08] write unto you in both which I stir up
[1:17:13] your pure Minds by way of
[1:17:16] Remembrance in other words he's saying
[1:17:18] I'm writing this to you to bring back
[1:17:20] this to your memory that ye may be might
[1:17:24] mindful of The Words which were spoken
[1:17:27] before by the holy prophets and of the
[1:17:31] Commandment of us the Apostles of the
[1:17:34] Lord and Savior knowing this first that
[1:17:38] there shall come in the last days
[1:17:39] scuffers walking after their own lust
[1:17:42] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:17:45] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[1:17:48] all things continue as they were from
[1:17:51] the beginning of the
[1:17:53] creation for this they willingly are
[1:17:56] ignorant in other words they are
[1:17:58] choosing to be ignorant that by the word
[1:18:01] of God the heavens were of old and the
[1:18:03] Earth standed out of the water and in
[1:18:06] the water whereby the world that then
[1:18:09] was being overflowed with water perished
[1:18:13] but the heavens and the Earth which are
[1:18:16] now by the same word are kept in store
[1:18:19] reserved unto fire against the day of
[1:18:23] judgment and pedition of ungodly men but
[1:18:27] beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:18:30] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[1:18:34] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:18:36] one
[1:18:37] day the Lord is not slack concerning his
[1:18:40] promise as some men count slackness but
[1:18:44] is longsuffering to usw not willing that
[1:18:47] any should perish but that all should
[1:18:50] come to repentance but the day of the
[1:18:52] Lord shall come as a thief in the night
[1:18:55] in the which the heavens shall pass away
[1:18:57] with a great noise and the element shall
[1:19:00] melt with fervent Heat and the Earth
[1:19:03] also and the works that are therein
[1:19:05] shall be burned up seeing then that all
[1:19:09] these things shall be dissolved here's
[1:19:11] the question what manner of persons
[1:19:14] ought ye to be in all conversation and
[1:19:18] Holiness all conversation and godliness
[1:19:21] looking for and Hasting unto the coming
[1:19:24] of the day of God wherein the heavens
[1:19:27] being on fire shall be dissolved and the
[1:19:29] element shall melt with fervent heat
[1:19:32] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:19:35] look for new heavens and a new Earth
[1:19:38] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[1:19:41] beloved seeing that you look for such
[1:19:43] things be diligent that ye may be found
[1:19:47] of him in peace without spot and
[1:19:50] blameless and account that the Longs
[1:19:52] suffering of Our Lord is salvation even
[1:19:56] as our beloved brother Paul also
[1:19:59] according to the wisdom given unto him
[1:20:02] had written unto you as also in all his
[1:20:05] Epistles speaking in them of these
[1:20:07] things in which are some things hard to
[1:20:10] be understood which they that are
[1:20:12] unlearned and unstable rest as they do
[1:20:16] also the other scriptures unto their own
[1:20:19] destruction so Peter is exalting and he
[1:20:22] starts to speak about what Paul is
[1:20:24] saying in the other letters and he said
[1:20:26] ye therefore beloved seeing ye know
[1:20:28] these things before beware lest ye also
[1:20:32] being led away with the error of the
[1:20:34] wicked fall it from your own
[1:20:36] steadfastness but grow in Grace and in
[1:20:39] the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
[1:20:41] Jesus Christ to him be glory both now
[1:20:44] and forever amen and our last scripture
[1:20:47] Revelation
[1:20:48] 21 and reading from verse
[1:20:52] 1 Revelation 21 and verse one and I saw
[1:20:57] a new Heaven and a new Earth for the
[1:20:59] first Heaven and the first Earth were
[1:21:02] passed away and there was no more sea
[1:21:04] and I John saw the holy city New
[1:21:07] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:21:10] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:21:13] her husband and I heard a great voice
[1:21:15] out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:21:17] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[1:21:20] will dwell with them and they shall be
[1:21:22] his people and God himself shall be with
[1:21:25] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[1:21:28] away all tears from their eyes and there
[1:21:30] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[1:21:32] nor crying neither shall there be any
[1:21:34] more pain for the former things are
[1:21:37] passed away and he that sat upon the
[1:21:39] throne said behold I make all things new
[1:21:42] and he said unto me right for these
[1:21:44] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:21:46] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[1:21:49] the beginning and the end I will give
[1:21:51] unto him that is the thirst of the
[1:21:53] Fountain of the water of of Life freely
[1:21:55] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:21:58] things and I will be his God and he
[1:22:01] shall be my son may the Lord at a
[1:22:02] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:22:04] may be seated amen amen
[1:22:08] amen
[1:22:13] amen amen so I have a title this morning
[1:22:17] led by the spirit into that Eternal
[1:22:22] Church age LED by the spirit into that
[1:22:28] Eternal Church age and my subject the
[1:22:32] destination of the
[1:22:35] Overcomers the destination of the
[1:22:37] Overcomers and an inspiration he that
[1:22:40] overcometh shall
[1:22:42] inherit all things now my title I took
[1:22:46] my title in part from the message a
[1:22:49] statue of a perfect man where brother
[1:22:50] brandham said now we are approaching the
[1:22:53] Seven Seals and we have just finished
[1:22:55] the seven Church ages and then he says
[1:22:57] something profound he said this is a
[1:22:59] message on teaching that ties the man in
[1:23:03] that's going to be Redeemed by the blood
[1:23:05] of the Lord Jesus and is going to be in
[1:23:08] that church age that Eternal Church age
[1:23:12] at the end of the
[1:23:14] seals so what is an age an age is a
[1:23:17] period of time so what is a church age a
[1:23:19] church age is a period of time that's
[1:23:21] reserved for a specific church and the
[1:23:24] first time the word church is found in
[1:23:26] scripture is in Matthew 16 where Jesus
[1:23:28] says Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:23:32] church and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:23:34] Prevail against it so but the brandom is
[1:23:36] coming at the end of all of this and
[1:23:38] he's saying that this message that I'm
[1:23:39] bringing the seven Church ages the Seven
[1:23:42] Seals is a message that's going to tie
[1:23:44] the man that's going to be Redeemed by
[1:23:46] the blood of the Lord Jesus and it's
[1:23:49] going to be in that Eternal Church age
[1:23:52] so he's not talking about being in Leia
[1:23:54] because leosia has a beginning and it
[1:23:57] has an ending he's not talking about
[1:23:58] being in Ephesus because Ephesus has a
[1:24:01] beginning and has an ending but this
[1:24:03] eternal Church age that he's talking
[1:24:05] about could have never had a beginning
[1:24:08] it could never have an ending because
[1:24:09] it's Eternal and anything that is
[1:24:11] eternal can not have a beginning or
[1:24:14] cannot have an ending can the church say
[1:24:16] Amen so he's talking with the people to
[1:24:19] go into a specific age now we understand
[1:24:23] when we read scripture God existed alone
[1:24:27] he is in eternity he is by himself he's
[1:24:30] a self-existent one he can't even be
[1:24:32] called God because God is the object of
[1:24:34] worship but when he creates the Angels
[1:24:36] now he is God because the angels are
[1:24:39] worshiping him but there are certain
[1:24:41] attributes that he want to express and
[1:24:43] we have heard this preach before but it
[1:24:45] take a great God to put a pause to slip
[1:24:49] from eternity and create
[1:24:51] time so almighty God
[1:24:55] from eternity made a little crack and
[1:24:57] says in the
[1:24:59] beginning now remember God cannot die he
[1:25:02] cannot disappear he is God he is eternal
[1:25:04] and he is in eternity but all of a
[1:25:06] sudden time is created because in order
[1:25:08] for God to express his attributes fully
[1:25:11] it cannot be in
[1:25:12] eternity he could only express his
[1:25:14] attributes in time in eternity there is
[1:25:17] no time there is no morning there is no
[1:25:20] evening so God couldn't come in the cool
[1:25:22] of the evening to fellowship with than
[1:25:24] anybody in eternity CU there's no
[1:25:26] morning there's no
[1:25:29] evening there's no night there's no
[1:25:31] summer there's no spring there's no
[1:25:32] winter in eternity there's no sickness
[1:25:35] there's no pain there's no heartache
[1:25:37] there's no struggle so in Genesis God
[1:25:41] starts time and that same God if it took
[1:25:44] God to start time it'll have to take God
[1:25:47] as the mighty Angel to end the time
[1:25:51] that's why the devil hates two books he
[1:25:53] hates the book of Genesis and he hates
[1:25:56] the Book of Revelation because Genesis
[1:25:58] is where time began and Revelation is
[1:26:01] where time is going to end because there
[1:26:03] are some people who are walking the
[1:26:05] Earth who are not creatures of time but
[1:26:08] they are creatures of Eternity and
[1:26:11] they're just passing through from point
[1:26:13] to point but one day they're going to
[1:26:16] reconnect to who they really are one day
[1:26:19] they're going to reconnect to where they
[1:26:21] really come from somebody say Amen
[1:26:25] you may be seated so in Genesis in the
[1:26:28] beginning Let There Be and let there be
[1:26:32] time began to tick for the first time
[1:26:35] there was no clock before Genesis there
[1:26:37] was no calendar before Genesis there was
[1:26:39] no morning and the first day and know
[1:26:41] that all started in Genesis for the
[1:26:44] first time there came something that God
[1:26:45] could
[1:26:47] measure there was a first day there was
[1:26:50] a second day there was a third day for
[1:26:53] the first time there's something that
[1:26:55] could be measured there's a fifth day
[1:26:57] there's a sixth day and on the seventh
[1:26:59] day God
[1:27:01] rested anybody with me this morning but
[1:27:04] what God was doing and I'm seeing it so
[1:27:07] clar the prophet said God is a God who
[1:27:09] he loves to show what he's doing in
[1:27:11] secret but it's only when it's finished
[1:27:14] and you look back to it he's been saying
[1:27:16] the same thing over and over and over
[1:27:18] again uh God had certain attributes that
[1:27:21] had to be displayed uh he had certain
[1:27:24] things in him that he wanted to give to
[1:27:26] his children but how could he do it
[1:27:28] unless he had
[1:27:30] children how could he save unless
[1:27:33] somebody fell so with the brandham said
[1:27:35] everything was in God's mind as his
[1:27:38] attributes he said you were in his mind
[1:27:41] he said the birds were in his mind the
[1:27:43] animals were in his mind uh the moon was
[1:27:46] in his mind uh the sun was in his mind
[1:27:48] the Earth was in his
[1:27:51] mind and God expressed it and because
[1:27:54] God expressed it it came to pass and God
[1:27:57] allowed the devil to run around in his
[1:28:00] Eden and Satan took his best
[1:28:03] shot his best shot and man fell and God
[1:28:07] smiled to himself because God said now
[1:28:10] I'll be a savior now I'll be a redeemer
[1:28:13] now I'll be a
[1:28:14] [Applause]
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:18] restorer you may be seated but what the
[1:28:21] devil doesn't understand the Earth was
[1:28:23] not his thought because brother brandham
[1:28:26] taught us the devil cannot create he can
[1:28:28] only pervert so you come into God's
[1:28:31] creation and try to pervert God's
[1:28:33] creation and you're playing in time
[1:28:36] which God created time in the first
[1:28:38] place it's a losing battle because
[1:28:40] whenever God is ready he could say time
[1:28:42] no longer and he could end the whole
[1:28:45] cycle and I say s is this the time for
[1:28:48] time to be no more s is this the time
[1:28:52] for some individuals to go to that
[1:28:54] Eternal Church age that age that always
[1:28:57] was that age that never began that age
[1:29:00] that could never end a place where
[1:29:03] there's no sickness a place where
[1:29:05] there's no sadness a place where there's
[1:29:07] no depression a place can the church
[1:29:11] sayen
[1:29:13] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so when
[1:29:17] Adam fell because every mystery was not
[1:29:19] known to him he didn't know what was
[1:29:21] going on so when he fell Adam went into
[1:29:24] hiding and that's what happened to so
[1:29:26] many of us whenever something goes wrong
[1:29:29] we go into hiding we hide at home we
[1:29:32] hide in the group we hide somewhere we
[1:29:35] hide in our work we do something because
[1:29:37] we can't figure it out Adam didn't
[1:29:39] realize that there was blood for him
[1:29:41] that there was Mercy for him on the
[1:29:43] Judgment seat and instead of Adam
[1:29:46] looking for God God is now looking for
[1:29:48] Adam Adam where are you Adam I'm looking
[1:29:51] for you every evening I come down to
[1:29:53] talk to you I spoke to you yesterday
[1:29:55] where you are today and there was Adam
[1:29:58] hiding covering himself he said I heard
[1:30:01] your voice and I hid myself because I
[1:30:04] was naked he said who told you you were
[1:30:06] naked have you done what I told you to
[1:30:08] not do but this was all God's plan being
[1:30:11] unfolded but God made a promise to
[1:30:14] himself I will restore I will restore
[1:30:17] Eden I will restore Fallen man I will
[1:30:20] restore the son no wonder the whole
[1:30:23] creation is groaning it's waiting for
[1:30:26] the manifestation of the sons of
[1:30:30] God can the church say Amen I'm just
[1:30:33] warming up Hallelujah so there's blood
[1:30:36] Adam didn't know that there was blood
[1:30:38] for him he didn't understand that there
[1:30:40] was blood on The Mercy Seat he didn't
[1:30:42] know about the blood he covered himself
[1:30:44] but God had another covering for him
[1:30:46] there was a blood sacrifice of lambs
[1:30:49] that could cover him but there was a
[1:30:50] perfect sacrifice to come that was going
[1:30:52] to remove his sin completely as if you
[1:30:55] never did it in the first place uh can
[1:30:57] the church say amen and once you are
[1:30:59] under the blood the devil could only
[1:31:01] point and he could point but he can't
[1:31:03] touch you you know why because the Devil
[1:31:05] Himself cannot come under the blood you
[1:31:08] don't hear me tonight you don't hear me
[1:31:10] today when you are under the blood he
[1:31:12] could only point and try to accuse you
[1:31:14] but he can never touch you because you
[1:31:16] are under the blood and the devil cannot
[1:31:19] come under the blood because to come
[1:31:21] under the blood you had to have
[1:31:23] representation by predestination to be
[1:31:26] under the blood to be under the blood
[1:31:28] you have to repent and accept this
[1:31:31] gospel and the devil cannot repent and
[1:31:33] accept this gospel so he can only watch
[1:31:36] you but he cannot touch you your pastors
[1:31:39] doesn't matter your mistakes don't
[1:31:41] matter because there's blood for you
[1:31:43] this morning there's blood for you
[1:31:45] tomorrow there's blood for you until the
[1:31:47] day of your Redemption can the church
[1:31:49] say
[1:31:51] Amen you don't hear me this morning you
[1:31:53] may be seated can I preach a little bit
[1:31:56] I just trying to test the temperature a
[1:31:57] little bit because I want to make sure
[1:31:59] you understand that you have a
[1:32:01] destination and this destination is only
[1:32:04] for the Overcomers it's not for the
[1:32:06] church members it's not for people who
[1:32:08] stay there in the message there's a
[1:32:10] destination there's a destination it's
[1:32:13] an eternal Church age you may be
[1:32:16] seated what are you talking about
[1:32:18] brother Isaac we read the scripture I
[1:32:21] John saw a holy city I saw a new Heaven
[1:32:26] I saw a new Earth listen our inheritance
[1:32:29] is not out there somewhere this Earth
[1:32:32] belongs to manifested sons of God that's
[1:32:35] why the Bible says we shall reign on the
[1:32:38] earth the devil is squatting on our
[1:32:41] property sickness is squatting on our
[1:32:44] property sin is squatting on our
[1:32:46] property and we come to serve the devil
[1:32:49] notice that we know who we are we know
[1:32:52] what belongs to us
[1:32:55] you may be
[1:32:56] seated Hallelujah brother branam he made
[1:33:00] the connection clear he made the
[1:33:02] connection between the Natural Earth and
[1:33:05] between this Earth so he said listen
[1:33:08] this Earth was the attribute of
[1:33:12] God and because the devil came and
[1:33:14] messed it up God has to he is obligated
[1:33:17] to redeem
[1:33:18] it and this Earth Hallelujah is also the
[1:33:23] attribute of God
[1:33:24] and God has to redeem it because it's
[1:33:28] part of himself he can't leave listen if
[1:33:31] your hand get burnt and it's getting
[1:33:32] burnt you would leave it getting burnt
[1:33:34] all the time you will pull it back you
[1:33:35] will redeem your hand from that position
[1:33:37] that it's in because that hand is a part
[1:33:39] of your body you don't hear me this
[1:33:41] morning if your hand is caught in a door
[1:33:44] and the door is squeezing your hand
[1:33:46] you're not going to say oh God are
[1:33:46] getting squeez squeeze squeeze no after
[1:33:49] while are you going to redeem your hand
[1:33:50] because it's a part of you it there's
[1:33:52] some pain there there's some sensation
[1:33:55] so when you go through your trials he
[1:33:57] feels it he knows it he understands it
[1:34:01] so he is obligated to redeem you from
[1:34:04] your sickness redeem you from your
[1:34:07] condition redeem
[1:34:10] you you don't hear me this morning you
[1:34:14] may be seated don't use your intellect
[1:34:16] this morning don't use your mind this
[1:34:19] morning we are called to something
[1:34:21] higher we are called to something
[1:34:23] greater we are going to a new city we
[1:34:25] are going to New Jerusalem can the
[1:34:27] church say
[1:34:29] Amen you may be seated what are you
[1:34:32] saying preacher I hope everybody gets it
[1:34:34] this morning A lot of people are in the
[1:34:37] message and they don't understand what
[1:34:39] this whole message is about it is not
[1:34:41] even about a message because the message
[1:34:43] is a part of the whole story that
[1:34:46] started in Genesis and ends a very
[1:34:49] specific way in
[1:34:52] Revelation Hall
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:34:55] the ending of this story is not the
[1:34:58] church the ending of this story is not
[1:35:00] pastors and teachers and evangelists
[1:35:02] those are on the journey to the
[1:35:05] destination you don't hear me this
[1:35:08] morning you don't hear me this morning
[1:35:11] so wait a minute we are born for a
[1:35:14] destination and along the journey you
[1:35:17] might pick up a job along the journey
[1:35:19] you might pick up a car along the
[1:35:21] journey you might pick up a wife a
[1:35:23] husband pick up something but that's not
[1:35:25] that's not
[1:35:26] it you're in church for a season church
[1:35:30] is temporary because that new Earth and
[1:35:33] that new heaven there's no church there
[1:35:36] it's the holy city New Jerusalem and in
[1:35:38] that City it's a kingdom there's a king
[1:35:41] that sits on the throne and that King
[1:35:44] has subjects those subjects are not
[1:35:46] pastors teachers it's not that those
[1:35:49] subjects are princes
[1:35:51] Sons They are Kings and priest that's
[1:35:54] why he is the king of kings because we
[1:35:57] are Kings and we are priests don't you
[1:36:00] know who you
[1:36:03] are you may be
[1:36:05] seated you are Kings you are priests he
[1:36:09] is the high priest you are a king he's
[1:36:12] the king of kings because we are Kings
[1:36:15] you don't hear me this morning there's
[1:36:17] power in you right now that the devil is
[1:36:19] afraid of when you walk Angels walk with
[1:36:22] you because you you are son of the king
[1:36:25] you are a king you are a
[1:36:28] king can the church say Amen you may be
[1:36:32] seated is there anybody in the house
[1:36:34] with me this morning I know you thinking
[1:36:36] about your bills and your problem and
[1:36:38] your back pain but I'm not talking about
[1:36:41] that I'm talking about a new city
[1:36:43] there's no back pain in that City
[1:36:45] there's no pain in that City there's no
[1:36:47] Mortgage in that
[1:36:50] City you may be seated I'm going to jump
[1:36:53] ahead of my myself the Bible said Jesus
[1:36:56] said I'm going to prepare a place for
[1:36:57] you he said in my father's house are
[1:37:00] many mansions and but the said when you
[1:37:03] read that house don't mix it up he's not
[1:37:05] talking about a house that you see as a
[1:37:07] house he said that word house means
[1:37:08] Kingdom so my father's Kingdom there are
[1:37:11] many mansions there's no small house for
[1:37:13] you everybody gets a mansion you get a
[1:37:17] mansion you get a mansion you get a
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:22] mansion
[1:37:26] listen you get a mansion that you didn't
[1:37:28] even build because he's preparing a
[1:37:31] place but the Bram said he wants to
[1:37:33] prepare a place for his
[1:37:35] wife to her
[1:37:37] liking just the way she likes it so God
[1:37:41] knows your heart he knows what you like
[1:37:44] and he went to prepare a place in this
[1:37:46] new city and
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:50] it's you may be
[1:37:52] seated so where are we at this morning
[1:37:55] we are back to the leadership of the
[1:37:58] spirit for
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] what the spirit has to lead us to
[1:38:06] somewhere and that destination is New
[1:38:10] Jerusalem that destination is that new
[1:38:14] Earth that new city can the church say
[1:38:16] Amen we're going to go somewhere this
[1:38:18] morning hallelujah hallelujah so Genesis
[1:38:22] there's a fall everybody with me
[1:38:25] you have time today put on your seat
[1:38:27] belts so we're going on a journey this
[1:38:29] morning Genesis all the way to
[1:38:31] Revelation and Beyond can the church say
[1:38:34] Amen tell your neighbor get
[1:38:36] ready get
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:42] ready so led by the
[1:38:45] spirit to your
[1:38:47] destination So Adam Falls and God begins
[1:38:51] to
[1:38:51] lead because you cannot find your way
[1:38:54] unless God leads you you don't know
[1:38:56] where you're going can we admit that we
[1:38:59] don't know where we're going and without
[1:39:01] the leadership of the Holy Spirit Joshua
[1:39:03] said it like this we have not passed
[1:39:05] this way before so anybody who is moving
[1:39:07] without the Holy Ghost is really
[1:39:09] guessing that's right and I don't care
[1:39:11] how good the guest is I don't want the
[1:39:13] guess I want the guide can the church
[1:39:16] say Amen so we must be led by the spirit
[1:39:19] to rightly divide the word because if
[1:39:23] you are part of the word you must know
[1:39:25] which part of the word you
[1:39:27] are because if you know which part of
[1:39:29] the word you are then you know what to
[1:39:31] expect then you know how to prepare
[1:39:33] yourself then you got to know where to
[1:39:34] tell the devil to get off because you
[1:39:37] are in your position can the church say
[1:39:40] Amen so here we find a man that God
[1:39:42] finds to lead by the spirit and this man
[1:39:46] is Abraham and what does Abraham do the
[1:39:49] Bible said he is seeking a
[1:39:51] city that's right this same city I'm
[1:39:54] talking
[1:39:57] about whose Builder and maker is
[1:40:00] God could it be the holy city could it
[1:40:03] be a special City could it be the New
[1:40:05] Jerusalem listen to the prophet in the
[1:40:07] message future home of the Heavenly
[1:40:09] bridegroom and the Earthly bride he said
[1:40:11] are you ready this is the city that
[1:40:14] Abraham was looking for so this city
[1:40:16] that John saw coming down from heaven is
[1:40:20] what Abraham was looking for listen
[1:40:22] being a Prophet The Prophet said he know
[1:40:25] the city was
[1:40:26] somewhere so way back in Genesis he was
[1:40:29] a man of God and his first inclination
[1:40:32] when he gets led by the spirit is I'm
[1:40:34] looking for that City because this world
[1:40:37] is not how it's supposed to be there's
[1:40:39] got to be something more than this this
[1:40:42] cannot be what I'm called for and he's
[1:40:44] looking for a city the Bible said he
[1:40:46] forsook the city he lived and he went
[1:40:49] over and look where he went he was
[1:40:51] looking for a city whose Builder and
[1:40:53] jaob was God hallah listen to The
[1:40:56] Prophet Jesus going to prepare with the
[1:40:58] Divine hands a Divine City Divine
[1:41:01] architect for a Divine bought people for
[1:41:05] a predestinated people he is going to
[1:41:08] prepare so Jesus is not is doing
[1:41:10] something he's preparing for some people
[1:41:13] everybody with me this morning and
[1:41:15] listen Abraham was looking for it and he
[1:41:18] professed that he was a pilgrim and a
[1:41:20] stranger oh yes that's good now that's
[1:41:23] powerful because many of us we want to
[1:41:24] be citizens of this
[1:41:26] world we want to make sure we have a
[1:41:29] good presence our name our reputation
[1:41:32] what we are but but not Abraham he said
[1:41:34] I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger he said I
[1:41:36] don't belong here I don't need what you
[1:41:38] have to offer because I'm on my way to
[1:41:40] somewhere I'm seeking a city whose
[1:41:42] Builder and maker is God do you know
[1:41:44] where it is can you tell me where it is
[1:41:46] do you know somebody who knows where it
[1:41:47] is because that's where I want to be I
[1:41:49] don't want to be here it's all right to
[1:41:50] have a house but that's not my house
[1:41:52] that's temporary that's that's going to
[1:41:54] end one day Heaven and Earth will pass
[1:41:56] away but this city I'm talking about
[1:41:58] whose Builder and maker is God I've got
[1:42:01] to get there I want to see it I want to
[1:42:03] be there can the church say
[1:42:06] Amen listen brother B said that Prophet
[1:42:09] knowing it was somewhere he said John
[1:42:12] saw it coming down but listen to The
[1:42:14] Prophet but Abraham thought it must be
[1:42:16] on earth right
[1:42:18] then so Abraham is now starting out the
[1:42:21] journey this is the beginning of the
[1:42:23] story
[1:42:23] and he's seeking for that City and he's
[1:42:25] like where is it but the said he thought
[1:42:27] it was there right
[1:42:30] then brother Bram said I'm looking for
[1:42:33] that City just like my father Abraham
[1:42:35] did are you looking for that City this
[1:42:38] morning but the BR described the city
[1:42:40] said streets of gold Avenues and Parks
[1:42:44] if you want to read it the tree of life
[1:42:45] will be there with 12 different kinds of
[1:42:47] fruit one for each month you have a
[1:42:50] different diet every month he said the
[1:42:52] people that eat these fruit they change
[1:42:54] their diet every month he said it's only
[1:42:56] for the Overcomers it isn't for
[1:42:59] denomination can the church say amen he
[1:43:02] that had an ear let him hear what the
[1:43:03] spirit say to the churches to him that
[1:43:06] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:43:08] tree of life which is in the midst of
[1:43:10] the paradise of God Overcomers only that
[1:43:13] overcome the Beast overcome his mark
[1:43:16] That's Catholicism protestantism
[1:43:19] denominationalism who overcome the Beast
[1:43:22] his Mark the letter of his name he'll
[1:43:24] have a right to the tree of life that's
[1:43:26] what Adam had access to the Tree of Life
[1:43:29] to enter into the gates where nothing
[1:43:31] that defile could ever go in see
[1:43:34] hallelujah hallelujah the tree of life
[1:43:36] will be for Overcomers only the leaves
[1:43:39] will be for the healing of the Nations
[1:43:41] and the kings that live in there bring
[1:43:43] their honor in when they bring their
[1:43:45] honor in and lay Before the Throne of
[1:43:48] God one for each tribe when they bring
[1:43:51] their honor from the Blessed land in
[1:43:53] there they'll reach from the Tree of
[1:43:54] Life this must be real to you friends
[1:43:57] and break off a leaf from the Tree of
[1:44:00] Life and they'll walk out together
[1:44:02] because there'll be no more war
[1:44:04] everything is at peace so what is
[1:44:05] brother Bram saying in that new city
[1:44:07] there are people who are on the inner
[1:44:09] circle and the people on the outside and
[1:44:11] those on the outside the King Alone can
[1:44:13] come in to get a leaf but that's not the
[1:44:16] bride the bride is on the inside access
[1:44:19] to the Tree of Life all the time access
[1:44:22] to the fountain all the time access all
[1:44:25] the time you don't hear me this
[1:44:27] [Applause]
[1:44:28] morning listen to The Prophet there was
[1:44:31] a tree of life in the Garden of Eden and
[1:44:34] talking about Adam he might have eaten
[1:44:35] from it might have eaten from it if he
[1:44:38] hadn't
[1:44:39] fell the tree of life was to remind him
[1:44:42] all the time his youth was continually
[1:44:45] going on same with the Nations the
[1:44:47] leaves will be for the healing of the
[1:44:49] Nations can the church say Amen am sh

[1:51:23] up again even when Jesus was here he
[1:51:27] pushed the devil back but he came back
[1:51:29] again but this time is different because
[1:51:32] the ages time is coming to an end

[1:53:25] [Applause]
[1:53:29] age you may be seated if you can let me
[1:53:33] give you the secret why this is
[1:53:36] possible hallu why this age is so
[1:53:40] significant when you read the book of
[1:53:42] Revelation there were certain secrets to
[1:53:45] the Overcomers in each Age come on now
[1:53:50] but because you are not from Leia and
[1:53:53] because you are from what we call the
[1:53:54] bride age or the Eternal Church age and
[1:53:57] you're from eternity you have access to
[1:54:00] pick up everything that those in the
[1:54:02] other ages had you could pull up their
[1:54:05] power you could pull up the anointing
[1:54:07] you could pull up the inspiration you
[1:54:09] could pull up the promises for the first
[1:54:12] time you may be seated no wonder Abraham
[1:54:16] was searching but he couldn't see it yet
[1:54:19] because time had to unfold some more but
[1:54:22] now we the end of time but the brand
[1:54:24] call it the fullness of time when time
[1:54:27] runs
[1:54:29] out all the power that was in Jesus is
[1:54:33] poured into his
[1:54:37] bride you may be
[1:54:42] [Applause]
[1:54:50] seated Hallelujah you may be seated
[1:54:53] listen friends in each age I'm talking
[1:54:56] about the church ages now and there are
[1:54:59] so many types in scripture you read The
[1:55:01] Book of Leviticus there are seven feasts
[1:55:03] the Feast of Tabernacles and the Feast
[1:55:05] of and all the different
[1:55:08] feasts said each Feast represented a
[1:55:11] church
[1:55:12] age those in that day didn't know what
[1:55:14] they were
[1:55:16] representing Hallelujah Paul irenius
[1:55:18] Marth Columbo Luther Wesley they had no
[1:55:21] idea what was going on there were
[1:55:23] pieces that were being played on a
[1:55:26] board but your position is different you
[1:55:29] are now looking at the board for the
[1:55:32] first time there are people on the Earth
[1:55:34] who can look back and know every
[1:55:36] [Applause]
[1:55:37] mystery because those things which are
[1:55:39] revealed belong unto
[1:55:42] us every loose end has been tied
[1:55:47] up why because God sent a
[1:55:50] prophet to tie up the Loose Ends
[1:55:52] to reveal the secret things of God so
[1:55:55] that there could be some
[1:55:57] Overcomers the revelation of how to
[1:55:59] overcome is not for church Wars and to
[1:56:02] have conventions no it's to put us in
[1:56:04] that new
[1:56:09] city you may be
[1:56:13] seated I am so
[1:56:16] excited
[1:56:17] [Music]

[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:58] [Music]
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:15] [Applause]
[1:57:24] the Rapture is a revelation not to a
[1:57:26] group to an individual if I'm the only
[1:57:29] one in Trinidad to go I'm going is there
[1:57:31] anybody else is there anybody else is
[1:57:35] there anybody

[1:57:39] else you may be seated you got to know
[1:57:43] your message you got to understand what
[1:57:45] this is all
[1:57:47] about Hallelujah so let me drop this in
[1:57:49] here because understand my title led by
[1:57:52] the spirit into that Eternal Church age
[1:57:56] my subject the destination of the
[1:57:59] Overcomers because only Overcomers are
[1:58:03] going to make
[1:58:04] it so this is an encouragement to you
[1:58:08] because if you have something to
[1:58:09] overcome that already makes you a
[1:58:11] candidate Hallelujah because if you
[1:58:13] don't have a trial God a even looking at
[1:58:15] you and the bigger the trial you have
[1:58:18] the better it is because it makes you a
[1:58:21] real over come up oh you don't hear me

[2:02:50] get inheritance
[2:02:52] but the charge or the crime or the
[2:02:55] indictment or the prosecution was
[2:02:57] against Jacob but when Jacob wrestled
[2:03:00] with the angel and he overcame he was no
[2:03:02] longer Jacob he was now Israel and you

[2:06:36] city you may be seated but the brandom
[2:06:39] said the types brother Knights must be
[2:06:41] perfect throughout scripture perfect
[2:06:43] throughout scripture so when even when
[2:06:45] Jesus was at Mount Transfiguration
[2:06:48] brother Bram said it was also a type
[2:06:51] because who did he have with him Moses
[2:06:52] and Elijah why Moses and Elijah because
[2:06:55] Moses was representing the saints that
[2:06:57] were died that were were going to be
[2:06:58] resurrected Elijah was representing
[2:07:00] those that were in the Rapture he said
[2:07:02] that mount Transfiguration was a type of
[2:07:04] Mount Jerusalem the new city with Jesus
[2:07:07] on the top of the throne and with him
[2:07:10] those that from all ages were
[2:07:11] resurrected but also the bride who were
[2:07:14] raptured which there's only one group
[2:07:16] being raptured it's us that's right
[2:07:18] Elijah and Enoch that's the Rapture crew
[2:07:21] amen
[2:07:21] [Applause]
[2:07:25] only Enoch Elijah and this bride will
[2:07:27] have the testimony of rapture no wonder
[2:07:30] Abraham say he wish he could have been
[2:07:31] here and David say he wish he could have
[2:07:32] been here because we shall not all sleep
[2:07:36] we have the testimony we shall be
[2:07:38] changed so if that's no wonder the
[2:07:40] prophet say if how could we have faith
[2:07:42] for the Rapture if we don't have faith
[2:07:43] for Divine Healing when at the end of
[2:07:45] the day this body have to change anyway

[2:10:36] going to skip we're going to skip some
[2:10:37] parts so friends the Holy Spirit has to
[2:10:39] lead you to the revealed word of your
[2:10:42] day remember the BR did a type he said a
[2:10:45] th Years is as one day and a day is a th
[2:10:48] years so he says so the first day back
[2:10:50] in Genesis first the second third fourth
[2:10:52] fifth 6th 7th day was the resting day
[2:10:55] and he said throughout the ages and he
[2:10:57] goes to the type he said your word for
[2:10:59] your day if you have the wrong word is
[2:11:01] as if you living on the wrong day yeah
[2:11:04] so your day is Thursday but you you you
[2:11:07] you already think it's
[2:11:08] Monday and you reach late to the
[2:11:10] appointment cuz you on the wrong
[2:11:12] timetable you looking at the calendar
[2:11:14] the wrong way yeah because if a day has
[2:11:17] an expectation then you have to know the
[2:11:19] word for your day
[2:11:22] so you must be led by the spirit to the
[2:11:26] word for your day just as Simeon was led
[2:11:30] by the spirit to the word for his day
[2:11:32] which was Messiah and blind Anna was led
[2:11:36] by the spirit without seeing and this is
[2:11:38] types in scripture to show that it's not
[2:11:39] even natural eyes but it's the
[2:11:41] leadership of the Holy Spirit not man's
[2:11:44] leadership you're not here because of
[2:11:45] man I pray that you will not hear
[2:11:47] because of man because man will always
[2:11:49] fail but this Holy Spirit can never fail
[2:11:52] he's the comforter he's the guide he
[2:11:54] said I will never leave you I'll never
[2:11:55] forsake you can the church say
[2:11:57] Amen but expectations he said the same
[2:12:00] reason that you are here tonight you see
[2:12:03] I'm so used to checking for my time but
[2:12:04] I'm not
[2:12:08] even amen you you can take some more
[2:12:12] right the same reason you are here
[2:12:14] tonight you sick people the same holy
[2:12:16] ghost that led Simeon the same holy
[2:12:17] ghost that led Anna has led you here for
[2:12:20] you believe that there's a fountain open
[2:12:22] somewhere for healing it's here God
[2:12:25] moving among his people so the Holy
[2:12:27] Spirit friends could only lead you to
[2:12:29] the word that's right the young sister
[2:12:31] the Holy Spirit cannot lead you to cut
[2:12:33] your
[2:12:34] hair the Holy Spirit cannot lead you to
[2:12:37] wear clothes that's so tight that you
[2:12:38] could see what's going on the holy
[2:12:41] spirit will not lead you to wear a skirt
[2:12:43] that barely cut in your
[2:12:46] knee and I've preached on this a few
[2:12:48] times I want to make sure it clear so I
[2:12:50] want to I I don't say just I want to be
[2:12:52] very very clear you see cover your knee
[2:12:54] is not standing
[2:12:59] up covering the knee is not the the
[2:13:02] measurement of Co cover knee is not when
[2:13:03] he when he sitting
[2:13:15] down I'm speaking in my office this
[2:13:20] morning
[2:13:22] but over said this morning the pastor is
[2:13:23] in the house well the assistant pastor
[2:13:25] is in the
[2:13:28] house so I want to be very very clear I
[2:13:31] cannot speak for any church but holy
[2:13:33] decency and
[2:13:34] modesty you know what the Bible says
[2:13:36] present your body's a Living
[2:13:38] Sacrifice which is your reasonable
[2:13:41] service so God is saying this is not no
[2:13:44] rocket science no hard trial oh gosh did
[2:13:47] is your reasonable
[2:13:50] service amen amen because you cannot go
[2:13:53] to the new city dress the way s want to
[2:13:56] dress when you're not dressing for
[2:14:01] church you can't speak in the no City

[2:14:22] in the new
[2:14:24] city those things don't qualify for the
[2:14:27] new city even if you love them those
[2:14:30] things that you love not making it to
[2:14:31] the new
[2:14:34] city because but said nothing un
[2:14:37] rightous nothing contaminating nothing
[2:14:39] sinful nothing engineered by the god
[2:14:42] lowercase G of this evil age can make it
[2:14:44] to the new
[2:14:45] [Applause]
[2:14:47] city Heaven and Earth will pass away
[2:14:50] John said heard I saw the whole thing
[2:14:53] burn and destroy all of that going with
[2:14:56] [Applause]
[2:15:05] it I'm feeling
[2:15:09] good every gift has its place some
[2:15:12] always find myself in this in this
[2:15:18] groove but that's that's that's a
[2:15:20] requirement the holy spirit will never
[2:15:21] lead you to drink and smoke and people
[2:15:23] justify all kind of stuff and you want
[2:15:26] to go to the new
[2:15:28] city when it's dripping with blood the
[2:15:30] people going to be
[2:15:32] there the blood of disciples who stood
[2:15:34] for the truth and he want to barely make
[2:15:37] it in on on your little story and you
[2:15:40] didn't know what I was going through and
[2:15:41] that is that is why I drag
[2:15:45] myself
[2:15:47] Overcomers that's what I'm speaking to
[2:15:49] this morning the Overcomers who went to
[2:15:51] cut everything off and say listen I
[2:15:53] don't care what you have to offer I am
[2:15:55] seeking a city whose Builder and maker
[2:15:57] is God that's my focus that's my
[2:16:02] [Applause]
[2:16:03] priority can the church say
[2:16:08] Amen Hallelujah from the message return
[2:16:10] and Jubilee the church is a born against
[2:16:13] bunch of Believers that's in Christ by
[2:16:16] the Holy Ghost led by the spirit of God
[2:16:19] that's the definition I love it the
[2:16:21] church is a born again bunch of
[2:16:24] Believers that's in Christ by the Holy
[2:16:27] Ghost led by the spirit of God they are
[2:16:30] not of the world they are out of the
[2:16:32] world they are different from the world
[2:16:35] that's what makes them what they are
[2:16:38] their life is dead and they are HID in
[2:16:40] Christ dead in Christ and hid sealed by
[2:16:43] the Holy Ghost sons of God are led by
[2:16:47] the spirit of God not led by some other
[2:16:50] fanatics or some organization or
[2:16:52] something or other they are led by the
[2:16:54] spirit of God and the Holy Spirit was
[2:16:57] given to the church to be the overseer
[2:17:00] the tutor that was to raise the children
[2:17:02] of God not our Bishops and Cardinals and
[2:17:05] big ministers and so forth but the Holy
[2:17:09] Ghost but the B said I'm expecting the
[2:17:12] Holy Ghost not denomination not a bishop
[2:17:15] not a Catholic priest not a Baptist
[2:17:17] preacher or a Pentecostal preacher I'm
[2:17:21] expecting the Holy Ghost to come down
[2:17:23] and set in order a church that will go
[2:17:26] to meet him filled with the power and
[2:17:29] the resurrection of Christ I'm expecting
[2:17:31] that I believed it God promised it and
[2:17:34] there be a CH without spot or wrinkle
[2:17:35] can the church say
[2:17:40] Amen my my I'm going to skip some stuff
[2:17:44] we're going to touch it some of the time
[2:17:46] I wanted to hit on how the Spirit Led
[2:17:49] each individual the holy Spirit led
[2:17:51] Abraham the Holy Spirit Led Moses the
[2:17:53] Holy Spirit Led all through the
[2:17:55] scripture every type was the Holy Spirit
[2:17:58] leading them to the word for their day
[2:18:01] and you have to be led to the word for
[2:18:02] your day so let me just strike my text a
[2:18:04] little bit and we're going to begin to
[2:18:05] wind down in the message of future home
[2:18:07] of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[2:18:08] Earthly bride the brandom said these two
[2:18:11] scriptures we read from second Peter the
[2:18:13] 3r chapter and Revelation 21 they both
[2:18:16] speaking about the same
[2:18:18] subject but John didn't write it the way
[2:18:20] Peter
[2:18:22] [Music]
[2:19:20] I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for
[2:19:23] the first Heaven and the first Earth
[2:19:25] were passed away and there was no more
[2:19:27] sea Peter goes a bit deeper but the day
[2:19:30] of the Lord will come as a thief in the
[2:19:31] night in the which the heavens shall
[2:19:34] pass away with a great noise and the
[2:19:36] elements shall melt with fervent Heat
[2:19:38] and the Earth also and the works that
[2:19:40] are therein shall be burnt up but when
[2:19:42] the Brandon begins to connect the dots
[2:19:45] because a lot of people believe that
[2:19:46] this means a world is being destroyed
[2:19:49] and but the bible say that is not the
[2:19:50] case the word pass away doesn't mean
[2:19:52] destroyed or annihilated it means
[2:19:55] transformed or
[2:19:58] changed amen so he goes back to Isaiah
[2:20:01] because Isaiah was the prophet that
[2:20:04] wrote the entire Bible in Prophecy so
[2:20:07] there are 66 books in the
[2:20:10] Bible and Isaiah wrote 66 chapters
[2:20:14] basically from Genesis to Revelation so
[2:20:16] around the middle he started with
[2:20:18] creation around the middle of the book
[2:20:19] there's John the Baptist and he winds up
[2:20:22] in verse 65 speaking about the
[2:20:26] Millennium and saying this is Isaiah in
[2:20:28] the Old Testament for behold I create
[2:20:31] new heavens and a new Earth and the
[2:20:33] former shall not be remembered nor come
[2:20:35] in mind amen but be ye glad and rejoice
[2:20:38] forever in that which I create for
[2:20:40] behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing
[2:20:43] and her people a joy and I will rejoice
[2:20:46] in Jerusalem and joy in my people and
[2:20:48] the voice of weeping shall no more more
[2:20:51] be heard in her nor the voice of crying
[2:20:53] there shall be no more than an infant of
[2:20:56] days nor an old
[2:20:58] man this is in scripture in the Old
[2:21:00] Testament no more infants no more old
[2:21:02] men that had not filled his days for the
[2:21:04] child shall die 100 years old but the
[2:21:06] sinner of being 100 years old shall be a
[2:21:08] curse and they shall build houses and
[2:21:10] inhabit them and shall plant Vineyards
[2:21:12] and eat the fruit of them and they shall
[2:21:14] not build and another inhabit they shall
[2:21:16] not plant and another eat for as the
[2:21:18] days of a tree are the days of my people
[2:21:20] and he goes on speaking about the
[2:21:23] Millennium so but brandham brought her
[2:21:25] with the help of the holy spirit that
[2:21:26] the Earth is not being annihilated but
[2:21:29] it's the atmosphere and I want to get
[2:21:30] into this a little bit and it's the sin
[2:21:33] that's upon the Earth that will be
[2:21:34] destroyed Hallelujah so what does it do
[2:21:37] butam said these thistles and sickness
[2:21:40] and death and politics and sinful man
[2:21:43] and sinful woman and evil spirits that
[2:21:46] will be gone away amen because we are
[2:21:48] going to live right here amen so God is
[2:21:51] Not destroying the planet he's
[2:21:53] destroying the atmosphere the prince of
[2:21:55] the power of the air he's destroying
[2:21:57] sickness he's destroying evil he's
[2:21:59] destroying sin he's destroying demon
[2:22:02] powers and by the B go he say right now
[2:22:04] there are demons in the atmosphere
[2:22:06] pointing accusations at you but because
[2:22:09] of the
[2:22:11] blood God is seeing through the blood
[2:22:13] and they can't even get true to you
[2:22:16] that's the word that's the scripture
[2:22:18] people don't study the message but
[2:22:19] that's it
[2:22:22] amen but the B said now notice germs
[2:22:25] sickness and these things will all be
[2:22:27] completely taken
[2:22:28] away all that's in the earth now
[2:22:31] man-made systems politics sin all kinds
[2:22:35] of evil spirits that the world is
[2:22:37] contaminated with and all the heavens
[2:22:39] above us contaminated with evil spirits
[2:22:43] all that exists in the heavens and the
[2:22:45] atmosphere and the Earth this whole
[2:22:47] earth but the say it's holding stuff
[2:22:49] that wasn't it wasn't made for
[2:22:51] he said the purpose of the Earth was not
[2:22:52] to hold sin the purpose of the
[2:22:54] atmosphere was to hold Sin Sin caused it
[2:22:57] to be like that it was made by God the
[2:22:59] Creator and by the bom now brings it to
[2:23:02] our Earth he said and these bodies that
[2:23:04] we live in now that was put in the earth
[2:23:07] you are from the dust of the earth and
[2:23:09] sin come into your body that's why you
[2:23:11] get old sin come into your body that's
[2:23:13] why you get sick so he said the same way
[2:23:16] God redeems the Earth it's the same way
[2:23:18] he redeems the individual I'm not
[2:23:20] preaching any this
[2:23:21] [Applause]
[2:23:23] morning so he says the first step for
[2:23:25] man is this you repent you get baptized
[2:23:28] what for for the remittance of your sins
[2:23:31] and it's very clear because people don't
[2:23:32] get this remitting of your sins is your
[2:23:35] past sins so when you repent and you are
[2:23:37] baptized that takes you of the past it
[2:23:39] doesn't touch the present or the
[2:23:41] future years ago there was a brother who
[2:23:43] came to me said brother Isaac my son got
[2:23:45] baptized but he's still behaving the
[2:23:46] same
[2:23:49] way read the message repent and be
[2:23:53] baptized with the remittance of your sin
[2:23:55] so your sins of the past wiped away but
[2:23:57] by the brandham said in this same
[2:23:59] message there's still a snake inside the
[2:24:03] heart the repentance and the baptism
[2:24:06] that just the first spot that had taken
[2:24:09] that touching
[2:24:11] snake that dealing with remittance of
[2:24:13] your past he said something else must
[2:24:15] happen first he said you must go through
[2:24:18] sanctification because you have be set
[2:24:21] aside for service he said sanctification
[2:24:23] gets your mind right no only the Bible
[2:24:26] say be transformed by the renewing of
[2:24:28] your mind you have to have different
[2:24:31] company you have to have a different
[2:24:32] talk you have to put prayer in its place
[2:24:34] you as I said to them in the Nigeria
[2:24:36] convention when you wake up in the
[2:24:38] morning the first thing you reach for
[2:24:39] shouldn't be your
[2:24:44] phone you got to get your mind right he
[2:24:46] said that sanctification set aside for
[2:24:48] service then brother brandham now he
[2:24:50] makes a subtle separation between Holy
[2:24:52] Ghost and Fire he says because the fire
[2:24:55] comes to burn the steak and the Holy
[2:24:57] Ghost comes to dwell in
[2:25:01] there anybody with me this
[2:25:04] morning so as an individual you repent
[2:25:07] you baptized so that baptism washes away
[2:25:10] the old man but now you got to get
[2:25:12] Sanctified set aside for service and
[2:25:15] then the Holy Ghost and Fire comes down
[2:25:17] and burns the snake and all of a sudden
[2:25:20] the snake is no longer in there it's not
[2:25:21] a dove it's the Holy Ghost are you with
[2:25:26] me and that's the process for man to be
[2:25:29] redeemed but the B said that's the same
[2:25:30] thing God is doing with the Earth she
[2:25:32] said every 2,000 years in two days
[2:25:34] something happens so God baptized the
[2:25:36] Earth with water everybody with me on
[2:25:40] this right and then the next 2,000 years
[2:25:42] he sprinkled
[2:25:44] blood no wonder the Bible said this
[2:25:47] Earth is reserved for
[2:25:49] fire because water and blood not taking
[2:25:53] the sin out it'll have to take fire to
[2:25:56] burn the devil to burn the demons to
[2:26:00] burn the spirits to burn and wherever
[2:26:03] they hiding you can't hide from fire
[2:26:06] fire going to find it once you lose the
[2:26:09] fire that's why you got to have fire in
[2:26:11] your life you got to have fire in the
[2:26:13] church you got to have fire in your
[2:26:17] walk you may be seated friends this is
[2:26:20] to help you along your Christian Journey
[2:26:23] because if you have been baptized and
[2:26:25] you repented of your sins you now you
[2:26:27] now barely
[2:26:29] stting because after you repent and you
[2:26:31] baptized you get Sanctified then you get
[2:26:33] filled with the Holy Ghost and the
[2:26:34] brandom goes deeper he said now there's
[2:26:36] a
[2:26:37] baby and that baby has to grow up
[2:26:40] because a birth nobody born as a big man
[2:26:43] so you are baby in Christ when you're
[2:26:44] born again no wonder the Pentecostal
[2:26:46] they had a birth they had a
[2:26:47] birth but they never became mature
[2:26:51] so that baby has to grow up and now by
[2:26:53] the tutor watching your conduct and your
[2:26:56] behavior with what you have done with
[2:26:58] the gift of God in you now you can head
[2:27:00] to adoption Amen to now a son that can
[2:27:03] have the authority of the father when
[2:27:05] you speak and you say unto one go he has
[2:27:07] to go say unto one come he has to come
[2:27:10] why a son in position proven tested
[2:27:13] tried character development as the
[2:27:15] pastor loves to say can the church say
[2:27:19] Amen so the Bram in the message future
[2:27:21] home of the Heavenly bride and the
[2:27:22] Earthly bride he brings a connection he
[2:27:24] said water blood spirit as it is with
[2:27:30] man it is with the Earth as it is with
[2:27:32] the Earth it is with man God cannot
[2:27:35] change he is the same he is the same
[2:27:38] yesterday he is the same today he is the
[2:27:41] same forever can the church say amen he
[2:27:43] said if he ever healed a person he has
[2:27:45] to do it again when the same conditions
[2:27:48] are met he cannot change can the church
[2:27:51] say amen he said if he ever saved a man
[2:27:53] he's got to do it on the same grounds he
[2:27:55] did it the first time if he ever filled
[2:27:57] a man with the Holy Ghost he's got to do
[2:27:59] it on the same grounds he did it the
[2:28:01] first time if you ever Raise A Man from
[2:28:04] the grave he's got to do it the second
[2:28:06] time and every other time on the same
[2:28:09] principle he doesn't change there's no
[2:28:11] shortcut it's got to be that way can the
[2:28:14] church say Amen am amen
[2:28:18] amen hallelujah amen
[2:28:21] hallah glory amen so the fire of God
[2:28:25] cleanses our hearts from sin and puts
[2:28:28] the Holy Ghost in so with the brandom
[2:28:30] brings a connection clar he said listen
[2:28:32] how could the Holy Ghost dwell in this
[2:28:35] vessel if there's sin and lust and
[2:28:38] enmity and anger and jealousy in there
[2:28:41] it has to take fire to burn it out and
[2:28:43] how could a holy God come to dwell on
[2:28:46] this Earth if there's sin and lust and
[2:28:49] Evil on the Earth
[2:28:51] so we already had the Earth baptized
[2:28:53] with water Jesus already came and
[2:28:55] dropped blood to sanctify it it's just
[2:28:57] went with a fire to
[2:28:59] burn and when the fire consumes
[2:29:02] everything now all of a sudden there
[2:29:04] could be a connection now once more that
[2:29:06] City could come down from heaven and
[2:29:08] rest in its place amen everybody with me
[2:29:12] this
[2:29:14] morning amen I believe somebody's
[2:29:17] understanding where we're going friends
[2:29:19] Hallelujah
[2:29:21] skip a little bit
[2:29:23] here I have a I have a lot of stuff here
[2:29:26] I'm not even halfway through praying
[2:29:28] from
[2:29:30] Marathon so the heart has to be cleansed

[2:29:42] must be repented it must be baptized in
[2:29:44] water in his name to show who it belongs
[2:29:46] to it must be cleansed by the blood of
[2:29:48] Jesus and then the holy fire and holy

[2:31:02] message and I really encourage you
[2:31:03] friends it is really important that you
[2:31:06] get into these
[2:31:08] messages I mean when you get into the
[2:31:10] word it's such it's such a joy and a
[2:31:12] blessing to see everything begin to jump
[2:31:14] out and when you out of the word you
[2:31:16] ready you come to church you're lost
[2:31:18] in this should be your food every single
[2:31:21] day I wish I could go into all of this
[2:31:23] with you
[2:31:24] today but you need to get this and and
[2:31:26] this is your homework for this week
[2:31:28] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[2:31:30] and the Earthly bride that's your
[2:31:32] homework for this week and we will test
[2:31:34] it next week Lord
[2:31:39] willing that's good brother Bram said
[2:31:41] and the heavens will pass away to Great
[2:31:43] noise he said the whole earth will be on
[2:31:45] fire and will ignite the gases in the
[2:31:47] earth and explode
[2:31:48] it Peter said the heaven will pass away
[2:31:51] and the Earth with a great noise is such
[2:31:52] an explosion will rock it because it's
[2:31:55] got to kill this is why it's got to kill
[2:31:57] every
[2:31:58] disease every thistle every Thorn
[2:32:01] everything there is the fire will burn
[2:32:03] it up he said it's a holy fire it will
[2:32:06] take away Satan and all of his
[2:32:08] Devils both Heaven and Earth will pass
[2:32:11] away killing all the germs insects all
[2:32:13] natural life around it even the water
[2:32:15] talk about a noise and brother BR said
[2:32:18] there's always noise when I said you
[2:32:20] when a man receives the baptism of fire
[2:32:22] there's a lot of noise around there she
[2:32:24] said fire on the earth fire in your life
[2:32:27] there's going to be noise because
[2:32:28] something is happening is anybody want a
[2:32:31] Holy Ghost Fire
[2:32:33] [Music]
[2:32:37] experience
[2:32:39] Hallelujah so this is part of teaching
[2:32:41] message I know a lot of young people
[2:32:43] they don't know this stuff this is this
[2:32:45] is the Caleb some some of the calebs I
[2:32:48] I'll leave that comment
[2:32:53] Hallelujah so brother brandham goes
[2:32:56] deeply in Heaven and Earth will pass
[2:32:58] away and he talk about the passing and
[2:33:00] what and what the word means what it
[2:33:01] means a transformation a change he says
[2:33:05] uh Jesus us a same word for a pastor he
[2:33:07] says a change of man he's a changed
[2:33:09] person so he goes to say it's it's the
[2:33:12] same you it's the same your same
[2:33:14] height but now there's a holy ghost in
[2:33:16] there it's a different
[2:33:18] man so you look at jaob one day and look
[2:33:20] at Israel the next day he looks the same
[2:33:22] but it's a different man because a
[2:33:23] change took place and that's what's
[2:33:25] happening to the Natural Earth as well
[2:33:28] brother B said one time I was the
[2:33:29] devil's property I was his property but
[2:33:31] not now one time that little woman was
[2:33:34] his property but not now can the church
[2:33:37] say amen hallelujah I want to skip down
[2:33:40] begin to wrap up here like he did us his
[2:33:43] creation of the living before he could
[2:33:45] come in it he had to give us the baptism
[2:33:47] of fire then the Holy Ghost come in and
[2:33:50] live the baptism of fire then then and
[2:33:52] then when you get that baptism of fire
[2:33:54] then the Holy Ghost can come in that's
[2:33:57] what he was talking about the evidence
[2:33:58] of the Holy Ghost is when you can
[2:34:00] receive the word not some system but
[2:34:02] have a clear understanding how do you
[2:34:05] know the word is clear understanding
[2:34:07] watch it vindicate itself it can't work
[2:34:10] sometimes and then don't work other
[2:34:11] times it has to vindicate itself every
[2:34:13] single time it's got to be the entire
[2:34:16] word to be the bride you have to be a
[2:34:18] part of him because he is a word and
[2:34:21] what a part of him is it it's a word
[2:34:24] that's promised for this day when he
[2:34:26] calls his bride can the church say
[2:34:29] amen amen I want to skip through here so

[2:34:41] which is the first day we are now into
[2:34:43] eternity so but the B said the
[2:34:45] Millennium is not that Eternal Church
