got to go to the lot of the Holly to let us understand about the origin water represents it Kelly please on what it means to you and if you don't think I just look because jesus said as she say harvest and what since the end of the world in our faith wounds amen I mean now this means many things develop should not be pillow amen a spiritual eye to look at the Word of God they can be a parallel length the breath DUSU flow then they hide loose oof now what the depth of a life to get a bird's-eye view of well a helicopter view of the Word of God holiday to to another world Penelope like a second co they set so that shoots that one stab more from that one stab goes on another five unit 1200 meter goes and the five stances this is sick it is split seconds time is she was you have fallen all by stairs coup that's the power of a single rat since Angela we so silly to you does empower set up priests or the scripture the liquid to when Jesus said here since you're the harvest is the end of one so set up of the world of people that means many things sum total of it is this to the harvest is the end of one so cellophane of course Jesus was speaking she Paula about the great
