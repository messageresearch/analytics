[23:44] and leaded him out and when he put it
[23:46] forth his own sheep he go it fought
[23:48] before him and the sheep follow him
[23:50] and they know
[23:52] his voice
[23:53] and a stranger will they not follow but
[23:55] will flee from him for they know not the
[23:58] voice of strangers verse 14 i am the
[24:01] good shepherd
[24:02] i know my sheep and i'm known of mine
[24:06] as the father knoweth me even so no i
[24:09] the father and i laid on my life
[24:12] for the sheep because of verse 23 and
[24:15] jesus walked in the temple in solomon's
[24:17] porch
[24:18] then came the jews wronged about him and
[24:20] said unto him how long does thou make us
[24:23] to doubt
[24:24] if don't be the christ tell us plainly
[24:28] jesus answered them i told you and you
[24:31] believe not
[24:32] the works that i do in my father's name
[24:35] they bear witness of me
[24:36] but you believe not because you are not
[24:38] of my sheep
[24:40] as i said unto you my sheep hear my
[24:43] voice
[24:44] and i know them and they follow me
[24:47] and i give unto them eternal life that
[24:50] and they shall never perish
[24:52] neither shall any man plot them out of
[24:54] my hand my father which give them me is
[24:58] greater than all and no man is able to
[25:00] plot them out of my father's hand
[25:02] i and my father are one

[25:11] we thank you for your blessed word we
[25:13] thank you for the scriptures as a
[25:14] comfort our souls our rescue of our
[25:17] lives this is what we feed on father
[25:20] blessed and interpreted to our hearts in
[25:22] jesus may ask it amen and amen you may
[25:24] be seated oh blessed i could i feel like
[25:26] a room right now he said i know them
[25:29] i call them my name
[25:31] no man able to plug them out of my
[25:33] father's hands they can't plug them out
[25:35] of my thank you god bless you praise the
[25:37] name of the lord praise be to jesus
[25:40] hallelujah
[25:42] give the lord a shout thank you lord
[25:44] amen
[25:46] so the title i have this morning is my
[25:49] sheep know my voice
[25:50] a stranger they will not follow
[25:53] and that that sheep is not talking about
[25:55] tea or sheep
[25:56] all right this is jesus she'd be talking
[25:58] about here he said my sheep know my
[26:00] voice
[26:01] and a stranger they will not follow so
[26:03] when they see people going after
[26:04] strangers you know happening they have
[26:06] to question whether or not they belong
[26:08] to him as a sheep
[26:09] because his sheep know his voice
[26:12] and you know what his voice is right his
[26:13] voice is his word
[26:14] so when you're heartening to the word
[26:16] and listen to the word you show your
[26:18] god's sheep
[26:20] oh blessed be the name of the lord thank
[26:22] you lord jesus my sheep hear my voice
[26:25] and i know them and they follow me and
[26:27] the prophet gave her a story one time of
[26:30] those small eastern places the rules is
[26:32] very narrow
[26:33] and he says there are people selling
[26:35] goods at the side of the road
[26:36] and the sheep and the shepherds fought
[26:38] walking and the sheep following him and
[26:41] they said the sheep wouldn't even bother
[26:42] with what they selling inside the road
[26:44] whatever vegetables it doesn't matter
[26:46] don't even watch initial but like that
[26:47] and they're following the shepherd
[26:49] praise god my sheep know my voice and
[26:52] they follow me
[26:54] they're not in the they're not in the
[26:56] thing of following strangers and
[26:58] following strange stuff
[27:00] oh glory to god they're following the
[27:01] word
[27:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord and
[27:04] we find out in the scripture
[27:07] praise god he said now is my soul
[27:09] troubled what shall i say father saving
[27:11] from this hour from this course came i
[27:13] unto this world is jesus and then he
[27:16] said father glorify thy name then there
[27:18] came a voice of heaven saying i have
[27:21] both glorified it and be glorified again
[27:24] and the people that stood by said it
[27:26] thundered oh glory to god it stood it
[27:29] thundered the people heard that thunder
[27:31] but jesus was saying the voice speaking
[27:33] to him oh god god have a voice you know
[27:36] god is that mute god is not dumb god
[27:39] could speak god could speak to you this
[27:41] morning god is not mute god is not dumb
[27:44] god can speak oh glory to god and i
[27:47] believe this is an important message
[27:49] today and in this message praise god we
[27:52] are referencing some wisdom versus faith
[27:54] some of it the prophet was told to stop
[27:56] food and he said you will need this in
[27:58] this hour come in here it's store up
[28:01] food because you're going to need it oh
[28:02] glory to god you will need to know that
[28:04] his sheep hear his voice and why are you
[28:07] saying that brother ovid because no
[28:08] other age no other time have there been
[28:10] so much voices everybody have a voice
[28:13] whether it's a tick-tock voice where is
[28:15] a facebook voice where there's a
[28:16] whatsapp voice everybody have a voice
[28:19] everybody is saying something you i'm
[28:21] bombarded 24 7 my voices but amidst this
[28:25] all my sheep know my voice oh glory to
[28:28] god i miss all the voices that coming
[28:30] forth he said my sheep gonna know my
[28:32] voice and a stranger they will not
[28:34] follow oh glory to god because his voice
[28:37] is the word and the word will bring an
[28:38] influence upon your life or give the
[28:41] lord a shout your care be influenced by
[28:43] unbelievers you can be influenced by net
[28:45] believers oh give the lord a shout
[28:48] you're gonna be influenced by the word
[28:50] of god oh hallelujah
[28:53] glory to god you feel the anointing of
[28:55] that that anointing coming right off the
[28:57] word of god my sheep know my voice
[29:01] oh glory to god and the voice of god is

[40:37] swallow what they've given you
[40:41] hold that here
[40:43] yeah

[40:44] that's why jesus said my sheep in my
[40:46] voice
[40:47] that's some time ago that's a man
[40:49] whistling
[40:50] colonical sheep and make this cheap
[40:52] noise about the sheep let's go straight
[40:53] so
[40:54] don't bother with him
[40:56] the real shepherd comes when he makes
[40:58] his noise oh let's see make about two
[40:59] and go and follow him
[41:01] my sheep
[41:05] so i strange i could impersonate and do
[41:06] it whistling and doing all these cheap
[41:08] business something like that she paying
[41:09] buddy ain't nothing because i ain't no
[41:11] way talking about
[41:14] a death to hear any other voice all i
[41:16] could hear is what what promise for me
[41:19] when i dreamed last night and i see it
[41:21] so and what come to me you ever hear
[41:23] them people on the internet they'll be
[41:24] talking and i feel god speaking to my
[41:26] spirit you know god they talk to them at
[41:28] all and you know he is like he was
[41:30] telling me got to talk so she was
[41:32] telling me and the way i see it and that
[41:35] god not talking to them
[41:37] all them see the man come back into
[41:38] power i call them is liars
[41:41] and they still have followers you know
[41:42] following people and people say we
[41:43] believe them
[41:44] no they're preaching other scriptures
[41:45] and whatever but they are liars
[41:47] the source spirit is a lie
[41:49] even though they're talking truth
[41:50] sometimes
[41:52] 99 can be true but you see the lie they
[41:54] talk the spirit alive that is the
[41:56] problem there
[41:57] that not not not the correct what you
[41:59] know the spirit life that lie on god and
[42:02] said this will happen and that will
[42:03] happen and that's what happened i didn't
[42:05] happen god don't lie
[42:06] if god said what happened praise god
[42:09] [Applause]
[42:11] if god says something gonna happen
[42:13] nothing could stop it
[42:14] he know the end from the beginning he's
[42:16] not he's not guessing he's not gambling
[42:19] he's not rolling his eyes i hope
[42:21] on the lucky over seven look he's not
[42:22] rolling his eyes when he said dusty of
[42:24] the lord say the lord oh i shall deliver
[42:27] you that's thoughts here the lord
[42:29] they're gonna get a breakthrough that's
[42:30] tossing of the lord you're gonna be
[42:32] healed that's dossier when god speaks
[42:34] that
[42:34] listen every demon in your body of
[42:37] sickness have to tremble when god
[42:40] prophesy over your life of your
[42:42] deliverance of your healing of your
[42:44] restoration
[42:47] glory the god
[42:49] hallelujah
[42:51] glory to god amen
[42:55] the voice of politics is so much
[42:57] stronger on the earth today than the
[42:58] voice of god
[42:59] until people sow their christian book
[43:01] right
[43:02] for a mass of popularity political power
[43:05] if there's so many voices in the earth
[43:07] today that is absolutely a heart thing
[43:09] because it deadens the voice of god
[43:12] it deadens the supernatural there are so
[43:14] many he described intellectual voices
[43:18] great voices of mighty men mighty men
[43:21] he's not weak men are not these are low
[43:22] men and mighty men who are intellectual
[43:26] that in their intellectual conditions
[43:29] they even shake nations
[43:32] bringing great organization together
[43:34] great campaigns florida and a person
[43:37] would be a bit confused
[43:38] it's enough to confuse them i know one
[43:40] minute said every time you post
[43:41] something is something i'll give the
[43:42] vaccine
[43:43] well you know he's an anti-vaccine man
[43:45] and he'll be talking his anti-vaccine
[43:46] like if he had no message to preach
[43:48] all he could talk about what are they
[43:49] doing now what is going to do like if
[43:52] half of them dead who preaching that
[43:55] some of them who peddle it call them
[43:56] conspiracy theories i see the next one
[43:58] that conclude
[44:00] from the same covert they blasted
[44:02] blasting and blasting it
[44:03] one man said god i shall take the
[44:05] vaccine
[44:06] then i'm going
[44:07] people who they listen to nothing wrong
[44:12] a bit confused it's enough to confuse
[44:14] them and how i can see if they remark
[44:16] the beast will add a booster shot so
[44:18] maybe the bastard beasts are working so
[44:20] good
[44:21] need a boost to get the rest of the
[44:22] beast it's so foolish what kind of
[44:24] nonsense is that busy marketing beast
[44:29] are you going for a booster shot
[44:31] because i have to survive this
[44:34] because i have a punch for the enemy
[44:37] and i ain't playing stupid
[44:39] i'm wearing my mask i'm washing my hands
[44:41] i'm doing all the things i have to do
[44:43] don't be a fool
[44:45] joseph can i stand up to the potion
[44:48] let me show you a scripture
[44:51] joseph stupid to show that woman's
[44:54] scripture is not scripted she's
[44:55] interested in she don't want to talk
[44:56] about scripture he ran for his life end
[44:59] up in prison you better run for your
[45:01] life
[45:05] okay the lord i shout
[45:08] glory to god i ain't playing you know
[45:11] sorry it's not one of the preachers who
[45:13] likes it
[45:14] oh i presented this
[45:16] jewish
[45:23] when you finish with that you lose the
[45:25] test you lose the money everything else
[45:29] joseph did the best thing you have to
[45:31] know in life when to stand and you have
[45:33] to know when to run
[45:36] and with this corona virus run don't
[45:39] walk run
[45:41] because they will catch you and when it
[45:42] hit your soul you don't know what it
[45:44] might do you so you better do what you
[45:46] had to do
[45:47] or whatever don't do it do it quickly
[45:50] because omni run or comedy chrono
[45:51] wherever you don't even
[45:54] this is better over walking warning
[45:56] about covered
[46:00] let me say that again good
[46:02] this is about the ovid warning your body
[46:04] covered
[46:07] never say i didn't tell you
[46:09] hallelujah all right
[46:11] so watch he said no
[46:13] this causes the voice of god to be
[46:15] placed way back somewhere the true voice
[46:16] of god and the voice of god they say how
[46:19] will we know it's the voice of god
[46:21] because for today it wasn't a vindicated
[46:23] prophet that's willing brown now today
[46:26] how do we know it's the voice of god
[46:28] because it's the manifestation of the
[46:31] prophet's word
[46:32] this is god's prophet and a true voice
[46:35] of god will only bring back that real
[46:38] living supernatural god with a
[46:40] supernatural word with the supernatural
[46:42] manifestation of the true word and we
[46:43] know it's the voice of god because amen
[46:46] the others there's so much other in the
[46:48] realm it's almost dead in that out but
[46:50] it will glisten it will come forward it
[46:51] will do it
[46:52] so regardless of what hypocrites
[46:54] whatever people it have it will still
[46:56] have the voice of god that want to
[46:58] glisten and they're gonna go okay
[47:01] let's settle in and buckle it now just
[47:02] want to get into this here won't keep it
[47:04] too long
[47:05] um there are two sources of
[47:09] two sources sorry wisdom or knowledge
[47:12] and faith
[47:14] there's only two sources or by two
[47:15] sources which we must live did you know
[47:17] that there's only two sources that we
[47:18] can draw our life from and one of them
[47:21] is wisdom the other is faith and if we
[47:23] think that and if we think what wisdom
[47:25] produces and then what fate produces
[47:27] we find out that god was the order of
[47:30] fate to believe for people to believe
[47:32] and to trust his word and satan is the
[47:35] order of wisdom trying to get the people
[47:38] to accept his wisdom and pull him away
[47:41] from defeat that's in god's word
[47:44] now
[47:45] god is the order of fate
[47:47] satan is the order of wisdom
[47:50] now he said to eve
[47:52] that you will be wise knowing good and
[47:55] evil right now you see where that starts
[47:57] with
[47:58] where that wisdom come from no he was
[48:01] clarifying this he went further to say
[48:03] the wisdom that i want to get
[48:04] straightened out on before we start
[48:07] there's the wisdom of god
[48:09] our wisdom of god is to stay with the
[48:11] word
[48:13] so god wisdom is very simple stay with
[48:15] the word
[48:16] and you're wise
[48:17] regardless of what anybody say stay with
[48:19] the world
[48:20] that's god's wisdom
[48:22] but satan in his wisdom tried to twist
[48:25] the word so that's the wisdom i'm
[48:27] speaking of
[48:29] so it's not just wisdom wisdom he's
[48:31] talking about the wisdom that twists the
[48:34] word
[48:36] do you mean satan that order with a
[48:37] pitchfork and a red head and two horns
[48:39] no he's a wood twister
[48:42] that's what he does twist the word
[48:44] no there's a certain amount of faith
[48:46] that goes with satan listen listen
[48:49] there's a certain amount of faith that
[48:51] goes with satan
[48:53] in order to accept satan you've got to
[48:55] believe satan so there's a perverted
[48:57] fate to a perfected thing and anything
[49:00] that would try to twist the word of god
[49:02] and make it something that it doesn't
[49:04] it's the wrong spirit
[49:06] right
[49:07] offering wisdom against god's wisdom so
[49:10] we're going to refer to it as
[49:12] wisdom and not satan's fate
[49:15] so he could have said satan feet and
[49:17] god's feet but he's showing you know is
[49:18] satan's wisdom
[49:20] fighting god's feet
[49:22] now we know this scripture in ephesians
[49:25] 4 and verse 14
[49:27] after coming to a perfect man that we
[49:30] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[49:32] and fro and carried a boat with every
[49:35] wind of doctrine by
[49:37] the sleigh of man
[49:39] and conan craftiness
[49:42] whereby the and wait to deceive the
[49:45] amplified say so that we no longer be
[49:47] children tossed like ships
[49:50] to and fro between chance gust of
[49:53] teaching and wavering with every change
[49:56] in wind of doctrine
[49:58] the prey of the cunning and the
[50:01] cleverness of unscrupulous men now
[50:03] they're talking about pastors
[50:05] apostles
[50:07] people behind me pulpit there's not pan
[50:09] lovers and party goers
[50:11] this is the sleigh of men describing in
[50:14] the amplified what that is about
[50:16] the prey the cunning and the cleverness
[50:19] of unscrupulous men gamblers engaged in
[50:22] every shifting form of trickery in
[50:25] inventing errors to mislead
[50:31] right in training that i saw a picture
[50:33] of a guy marching by the anti-vax people
[50:34] going along the port of explain to
[50:35] protesters and protesters and the
[50:37] unexpected where he was getting the
[50:38] vaccine
[50:44] he played smart trippiness as i
[50:46] said
[50:48] he vaccinated no but he might want
[50:49] people
[50:52] and there's some people seem to have a
[50:54] gift
[50:55] have a spirit
[50:57] to project error
[51:03] somebody sent some clip of some man in
[51:05] some gas station a woman telling them
[51:07] why you take off your mask and leave
[51:08] your mask home and and stop your mask
[51:10] and whatnot and different things and you
[51:11] do like he caught it differently i say
[51:13] but i really have a genuine thing do you
[51:14] want to run fishing lights
[51:17] and the woman say trying to kill him
[51:24] no you're begged to wonder why would
[51:25] somebody get a spirit
[51:28] why would somebody be crafty
[51:30] clever
[51:32] trying to twist the word to suit their
[51:34] gender
[51:38] inventing errors to mislead
[51:41] all right so look at second corinthians
[51:43] four
[51:44] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[51:46] paul speaking we have received mercy we
[51:49] faint not
[51:50] but have renounced
[51:52] the hidden things of dishonesty
[51:56] not
[51:56] walking in craftiness
[51:59] so paul is actually going the opposite
[52:01] to show you what is being presented to
[52:04] the ministry that was allocated to him
[52:06] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[52:09] the word of god deceitfully
[52:12] that means the word of god could be
[52:14] handled deceitfully
[52:16] and he is saying we're not doing that
[52:18] not handling the word of god deceitfully
[52:20] but by manifestation of the truth
[52:22] commending ourselves to every man's
[52:25] conscience in the sight of god
[52:27] let's hear what amplifies about that
[52:29] therefore since we do not hold and
[52:31] engage in this ministry by the mercies
[52:32] of god we do all and engage in this
[52:35] ministry by the mercy of god granting us
[52:37] favor benefits opportunities and
[52:39] especially salvation we do not get
[52:41] discouraged spiritless or disbonded with
[52:44] fear or become faint with weariness and
[52:46] exotic exhaustion
[52:47] we have renounced disgraceful
[52:50] disgraceful ways
[52:52] secret thoughts feelings desires
[52:55] unhandedness the methods and arts that
[52:59] men hide through shame
[53:01] we refuse to deal craftily to practice
[53:04] trickery and cunning
[53:06] or to adulterate or handle dishonestly
[53:09] the word of god but we state the truth
[53:11] openly clearly candidly and so we
[53:14] commend ourselves in the sight and
[53:16] presence of god to every man's
[53:17] conscience or give the lord some praises
[53:21] hallelujah
[53:24] let's drill along a little deeper here
[53:27] what is this wisdom the prophet was
[53:29] talking about here now he said now what
[53:31] is the wisdom we're talking about
[53:33] something that will not agree
[53:35] that all this word is the truth
[53:40] it is something that will take away from
[53:43] the truth
[53:45] are you ready
[53:47] expressing itself
[53:50] as a higher knowledge
[53:52] and more wisdom
[53:55] that is what they try to present
[53:57] the faithful ministry will bring up the
[53:59] hidden mysteries that was hid from
[54:02] before the foundation of the world
[54:04] that's a quote
[54:05] that's that's somebody will say that
[54:06] that's based upon what brahman says
[54:08] bringing up the mysteries of god and
[54:10] explain to the church
[54:12] think about that quote a minute
[54:14] as if
[54:15] men
[54:16] have some mysteries god didn't have
[54:17] already revealed
[54:21] how on earth could any man
[54:25] bring a mystery that has not been
[54:27] revealed
[54:29] when god and a prophet to reveal
[54:32] every mystery
[54:34] so this mystery that was hid
[54:36] before the foundation of the world has
[54:38] to be already been revealed
[54:42] so when men come to try to present they
[54:44] have something in their back pocket that
[54:45] nobody else have
[54:46] is the black bag you know
[54:48] sometime when i listen to these
[54:49] preachers i see they started the word of
[54:50] god and started preaching they were all
[54:52] even glory hallelujah waiting for the
[54:53] black back to come
[54:55] i always said in the middle instrument
[54:56] they bring on the black bag like nothing
[54:58] but you know
[54:59] that's their own bag
[55:01] but they get the people saying amen
[55:02] first amen first i want a black back
[55:04] come
[55:05] the people can using amen don't do that
[55:06] you know
[55:07] because my sheep know
[55:09] my voice when you hear the black back
[55:11] come out they say
[55:15] you can't digest that
[55:17] because there's another word i heard a
[55:18] preacher say he had a pinfall in the
[55:20] church nobody's saying amen but when i
[55:21] listen he's not preaching any word
[55:23] he preached his thoughts
[55:25] and he said if a pin fall you could hear
[55:27] it
[55:27] why wouldn't say amen i said but this
[55:29] man believed brother brown
[55:31] you mean ghosts and a whole prophet my
[55:32] mother picked a whole man i have one
[55:33] thing from this message
[55:37] and you want to say he meant to that
[55:39] listen this is a powerful thing you know
[55:41] if you know how much you put inside of
[55:43] you
[55:44] if you know listen
[55:47] if you know how much the word inside of
[55:48] you even if you read it literally we
[55:51] because the word have been so pumping
[55:54] you have more the secret is the word is
[55:57] in the bride
[55:58] [Applause]
[56:01] that remind me some bum
[56:03] somebody backs in the airs and
[56:05] on the streets or something so i said
[56:07] wait a minute i'm first he said i might
[56:08] be backstage and drunk buy a stupid
[56:10] godsend a prophet
[56:12] you can't take that out
[56:13] when you know about revelation god's a
[56:15] nine-time messenger you might be dead
[56:17] drunk as ever you might be struggling
[56:18] and whatnot but you know the truth you
[56:20] know god had promised all these churches
[56:22] in the last days god promised sons of
[56:24] god children who had to be turned back
[56:26] to the faith of the fathers in the last
[56:28] days listen you are eager you might be
[56:30] wounded but you're still an eagle you
[56:31] might be tired but you must be eager you
[56:33] might lost wing lost feathers but you're
[56:36] still are you gonna give the lord
[56:37] eagles give the lord a shout inside of
[56:39] here
[56:46] glory
[56:47] i prefer to be a vaccine eating than to
[56:49] be executive chicken
[56:51] or can might fight that one will
[56:52] give the lord a shout
[56:54] glory to god i make my people to be a
[56:56] wounded eagle than to be a glorified
[56:58] chicken with all the perks and all the
[57:00] hair and all kind of things like that oh
[57:02] gloria come on you eagles
[57:04] my god this word is for you my sheep
[57:07] hear my voice listen to the word of god
[57:09] hear the word of the lord
[57:12] oh glory to god hallelujah
[57:16] let's let's say it again
[57:18] it is something
[57:20] that will take away from the truth
[57:23] expressing itself as a higher knowledge
[57:26] more wisdom nobody never said nobody
[57:29] ever revealed that
[57:33] and you heard about you hear that people
[57:35] come people comedy selfish
[57:38] days
[57:41] they can't wait to tell somebody that
[57:43] no they can't forgive the neighbor
[57:46] they help nobody here but oh you hear
[57:48] that
[57:49] the head stimulated
[57:54] what they have behind the property is a
[57:55] superman
[57:57] s on his chest
[57:59] because he's bringing up mysteries
[58:01] that they never hear so before no they
[58:03] can't find the prophet preaching them
[58:04] things
[58:06] and you ask yourself why
[58:10] i could preach about nimrod
[58:12] go and discover nimrod and the number
[58:13] was just a numerator the mystery of
[58:15] nimrod history of nimrod
[58:18] naman lineage and whatnot all that is
[58:19] bible and thing too
[58:21] but we is he promising that now
[58:23] you are named family
[58:26] would he promise to that that's
[58:28] information that's not revelation
[58:30] so don't get tired of information and
[58:32] revelation is not the same thing
[58:34] revelation brings faith revelation is
[58:36] revealing power revelation is when you
[58:38] hear from heaven revelation is not what
[58:39] you're hearing you have in your head
[58:42] revelation is when god spirit bring the
[58:44] word and reveal it to you
[58:45] [Music]
[58:46] [Applause]
[58:48] glory sometimes god gave me revelation
[58:51] they can't explain anything but you know
[58:53] something dropped inside your heart and
[58:55] no devil could take it out he said upon
[58:57] this rock i will build my church and the
[58:59] gates of healthcare prevail against it
[59:01] why i think we stand in the way we
[59:02] standing because we have a rock
[59:04] revelation oh glory to god the devil
[59:06] could never take me out do you take not
[59:08] a long time it's too late now okay the
[59:10] lord some praises
[59:14] we're standing
[59:16] on a rock
[59:17] [Applause]
[59:22] and if wisdom of that sort come from
[59:23] satan his children live by that wisdom
[59:27] oh
[59:29] they do yes
[59:31] and if faith of god comes from god and
[59:33] god's word god's children lives on faith
[59:37] the bible said that just shall live by
[59:39] wisdom no
[59:40] faith the joshua by faith not what we
[59:43] can learn but what we can believe oh let
[59:46] me say it again not what we can learn
[59:49] but what we can believe
[59:51] that is what you're living by not how
[59:53] much mysteries do you miss it do you
[59:55] know the mystery trumpets over the vials
[59:58] what about the wolves why would a woman
[59:59] in the sun
[1:00:02] how much mystery mode tick tick tick
[1:00:05] because knowledge shall increase
[1:00:07] and faith shall go so low down that
[1:00:08] jesus asked the question when is son of
[1:00:10] man coming will there any be faith left
[1:00:12] will i find faith in the earth so much
[1:00:14] of knowledge so much a box and yet the
[1:00:16] question was asked when the son of man
[1:00:18] cometh shall he find fate on the earth
[1:00:21] oh glory to god faith on the earth
[1:00:24] there was famine
[1:00:26] and god tell the prophet elijah i have
[1:00:28] commanded a woman to feed thee dear
[1:00:31] god and tell the woman a word
[1:00:35] but god tell elijah
[1:00:36] that woman under a command
[1:00:38] to feed you
[1:00:40] and god has said a word to that woman
[1:00:43] but locked up in that predestinated seed
[1:00:46] had a fate
[1:00:47] and when she went to break one last
[1:00:49] break one last bread one last meal and a
[1:00:52] man of god came up to us and bit me a
[1:00:54] kid first as she turned to do it she yet
[1:00:58] dost hear the lord oh give the lord a
[1:01:00] shout that is when faith is working
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:08] and the bible went on to save so
[1:01:10] beautifully there were many widows but
[1:01:12] the one
[1:01:13] was elijah's scent
[1:01:15] oh god this should make you shout there
[1:01:18] are many peoples there are many churches
[1:01:21] there are many sisters and brothers but
[1:01:23] god sent a word to you today
[1:01:26] oh glory to god my sheep hear my voice a
[1:01:31] stranger
[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:34] they will not follow
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:41] oh glory
[1:01:43] my god i feel like rumbling in the camp
[1:01:46] oh glory to god i feel that rumbling in
[1:01:47] the camp
[1:01:49] oh glory to god we rolling into 2022
[1:01:52] with faith
[1:01:53] not with wisdom not with knowledge with
[1:01:55] fate
[1:01:56] we're living in times of uncertainty but
[1:01:58] be certain of god
[1:02:00] oh give the lord a shout
[1:02:02] times may be uncertain but we are not
[1:02:04] uncertain on god
[1:02:06] oh we are certain this will surely come
[1:02:09] to pass
[1:02:11] oh hallelujah
[1:02:14] wisdom has reasoning
[1:02:17] faith has no reasoning but wisdom has
[1:02:21] reasoning
[1:02:22] now what we are doing trying to do this
[1:02:24] morning
[1:02:25] follow what the lord said
[1:02:27] lay up food
[1:02:29] you're going to need it one of these
[1:02:31] days
[1:02:32] so god told the prophet to preach this
[1:02:34] lay up food because we will need it and
[1:02:36] i feel we need it now
[1:02:38] because some of you had to stop
[1:02:40] listen to what's up stop your facebook
[1:02:42] stop all your voices again that contrary
[1:02:44] to this because something could be so
[1:02:46] stimulating that is stability on you not
[1:02:48] that's what we're preaching here you
[1:02:49] know what you want to listen to what you
[1:02:51] want to hear cut it out
[1:02:54] cut it out
[1:02:55] either listen to that i'm foolishness
[1:02:57] you know
[1:02:58] no i listen to the word of god i have no
[1:03:00] time with them nothing i don't listen to
[1:03:03] people send me forward this and that i
[1:03:04] didn't read it sometimes i have no time
[1:03:06] for that you really attempt to check and
[1:03:08] check answers
[1:03:10] you releasing our time for that
[1:03:15] the serpent was more subtle
[1:03:17] than all the beasts of the field
[1:03:19] which the lord god had made and he said
[1:03:21] unto the woman ye
[1:03:22] as god said believe in saying the word
[1:03:25] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:03:27] garden
[1:03:28] so the woman the devil bowler boiled her
[1:03:30] god said you shall not eat every tree
[1:03:32] she corrected him
[1:03:35] roman says we may eat of the fruit of
[1:03:37] the tree of the garden
[1:03:38] but the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:03:40] the midst of the garment god had said he
[1:03:42] shall not eat of it no neither shall he
[1:03:44] touch it does he die
[1:03:46] so he didn't know the full story
[1:03:48] so he put something out and he catched
[1:03:51] and started wheeling the fish now
[1:03:52] because he gets full state now
[1:03:56] so when he hear him you shall naturally
[1:03:57] die
[1:03:59] aha
[1:04:00] this is your channel
[1:04:02] watch
[1:04:04] but i'll say faith holds to that the
[1:04:06] serpent says you shall not surely die
[1:04:10] a reason god is too good
[1:04:12] i'm still reading god is too merciful
[1:04:15] he loves you too much
[1:04:17] you hear that same old devil today god
[1:04:19] is too good to do this god won't do this
[1:04:21] god won't punish he will do just exactly
[1:04:23] what his word said he will do
[1:04:25] he said you shall not surely die see
[1:04:27] what he's trying to do getting her to
[1:04:28] reason with him
[1:04:30] in a minute that you reason
[1:04:33] on god's word you're losing faith
[1:04:36] so once you start to reason start to
[1:04:38] figure it out and console yourself
[1:04:40] because you know i think someone says
[1:04:42] control yourself because you don't want
[1:04:43] to do what god said
[1:04:45] that's the problem you know people
[1:04:46] hearing hearing hearing but you don't
[1:04:47] want to do what god said
[1:04:50] now i recognize there are lots of
[1:04:51] unbelievers in this message
[1:04:53] you know when bahrain preached when i
[1:04:54] first read that message i couldn't
[1:04:55] understand the unbelieving part i could
[1:04:57] i could you cannot believe it i just see
[1:04:59] it make believe in part and they believe
[1:05:00] apart basically unbelievable i couldn't
[1:05:02] catch that one no we're catching it
[1:05:04] there are people who in this message
[1:05:05] seen coming to church and they are
[1:05:07] unbelievers
[1:05:08] they don't really believe they believe
[1:05:10] the dream they believe their thoughts
[1:05:12] their ideas they believe what they want
[1:05:13] to believe when coming to this a problem
[1:05:17] but my sheep
[1:05:20] not to you over cheap
[1:05:22] all i have is a wife that i still
[1:05:25] my wife that's what i have right now
[1:05:26] only stands out
[1:05:30] my sheep jesus said that
[1:05:32] knows my voice
[1:05:34] his voice is the word oh hallelujah all
[1:05:37] right now watch
[1:05:39] so watch don't have no yes knows maybe
[1:05:42] so stay right with it eve had the right
[1:05:44] approach but she listened to his
[1:05:47] reasoning there are so many people today
[1:05:50] that has the right knowledge
[1:05:52] that knows that this word should be
[1:05:54] god's word and it's god's word but they
[1:05:56] stand and let some seminary student
[1:05:59] reason them out of it
[1:06:01] a way watch from the holy spirit away
[1:06:05] from the things of god
[1:06:08] reasoning we have to cast them down
[1:06:10] so once they find yourself get caught up
[1:06:12] in reason there's a problem there
[1:06:14] you have to really walk in faith
[1:06:16] so the serpent said in the woman you
[1:06:18] shall not surely die for god know it i
[1:06:20] can imagine what he said
[1:06:23] for god knoweth that in the day you eat
[1:06:25] thereof your eyes shall be open and you
[1:06:28] shall be as gods knowing good and evil
[1:06:31] some real good boy oh god i want to know
[1:06:33] i want to be like god
[1:06:35] knowing good and evil
[1:06:37] he has given her a reason
[1:06:39] you will be like and be equal with god
[1:06:42] in other words you want to really be
[1:06:45] right with god take my advice
[1:06:47] listen to me god don't mean that he
[1:06:50] didn't when you hear that get away from
[1:06:52] it
[1:06:55] the piss of a serpent it sounds
[1:06:58] reasonable but don't reason
[1:07:00] just believe it god said so and when the
[1:07:03] woman saw that the tree was good for
[1:07:05] food
[1:07:06] and it was pleasant to the eye a tree to
[1:07:09] be desired to make one have knowledge
[1:07:12] and to make one wise you see what it was
[1:07:15] satan presented knowledge
[1:07:18] knowledge that was contrary to the word
[1:07:20] how to make one wise
[1:07:26] she took of the fruit did eat give with
[1:07:28] her husband with her he did eat the eyes
[1:07:30] were open
[1:07:31] and they knew they were naked and they
[1:07:33] sold fake leaves
[1:07:34] what started it off reasoning see faith
[1:07:37] has no reason you believe when you're
[1:07:39] prayed for you accept god's word for
[1:07:40] healing do reason with your feelings
[1:07:42] don't reason with nothing else there is
[1:07:44] no reasoning to it god said so that's a
[1:07:47] flip you must believe don't reason
[1:07:49] believe don't try to have wisdom just
[1:07:52] believe the word wait for a moment we'll
[1:07:54] go back to the seed again what was it
[1:07:56] the devil tried to do with wisdom make
[1:07:58] god's word say something it didn't say
[1:08:01] that's what wisdom does
[1:08:03] push something on people that god did
[1:08:05] not say
[1:08:06] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:08:09] glory to god hallelujah you said well i
[1:08:12] tell you brother branham you ain't have
[1:08:13] the right interpretation the bible said
[1:08:16] prophecy is of no private interpretation
[1:08:18] oh glory to god so who else is the
[1:08:20] prophet outside of our prophet oh give
[1:08:22] the lord i shout now
[1:08:24] god sent one messenger to interpret the
[1:08:26] word so all we have to do is to go back
[1:08:29] to the source
[1:08:30] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:33] praise god go back to the source
[1:08:36] and the source is the days of the voice
[1:08:38] revelation 10 7 of the seventh angel
[1:08:40] when he shall begin to slung the mystery
[1:08:42] of god shall be finished
[1:08:43] glory to god what the prophet said the
[1:08:45] bride will say oh glory to god you
[1:08:48] believe that
[1:08:49] he said watch he said why is it no
[1:08:52] private interpretation the word of the
[1:08:53] lord comes to the prophet it's
[1:08:54] interpreted by the prophet the prophets
[1:08:57] already interpreted to you
[1:09:04] could we continue
[1:09:05] all right
[1:09:07] all right in the beginning was the word
[1:09:09] the word was with god and the word was
[1:09:11] god see the word is in god it was god
[1:09:14] it was his torch that was with him see
[1:09:17] god taught is as eternal as god is that
[1:09:20] in skin milk brother see god taught was
[1:09:22] his word in the beginning and watch in
[1:09:24] the beginning was the word god taught
[1:09:26] and the word was with god and the word
[1:09:28] was god his thoughts
[1:09:31] is what he was
[1:09:33] that's you too
[1:09:35] what your thoughts are is what you are
[1:09:39] that's a big one you know
[1:09:41] let me read that again
[1:09:42] what your thoughts are is what you are
[1:09:45] no matter how you try to live by
[1:09:47] something else your torch is what you
[1:09:49] are you might go along act like a nice
[1:09:50] fellow but in your heart you are an
[1:09:52] adulteress or whatever it is that's what
[1:09:54] you are your torch
[1:09:56] and god taught was his word and that was
[1:09:58] him with him and him isn't that right
[1:10:01] god taught was expressing the human body
[1:10:03] and let's go back to genesis he said
[1:10:05] when the serpent said you shall not
[1:10:06] surely die now when
[1:10:09] what it presents what is it trying to
[1:10:11] make the word say something it doesn't
[1:10:14] say
[1:10:15] as satan was presented to her you shall
[1:10:17] not surely die it's trying to make the
[1:10:20] word say something so it's a twisting of
[1:10:23] scripture
[1:10:24] oh hallelujah what does fear do believe
[1:10:27] it
[1:10:28] just
[1:10:28] the way it is
[1:10:31] and all you say is god said so
[1:10:34] god said so
[1:10:35] you said to speak the word god said so i
[1:10:37] will never leave you i'll never seek you
[1:10:40] i'll be rich even in you to the end of
[1:10:41] god said so oh glory to god what is his
[1:10:45] voice his voice is his word isn't that
[1:10:47] right praise god hallelujah thank you
[1:10:50] lord jesus he said in the last days
[1:10:52] talking about the thunders that daniel
[1:10:53] heard in the last days these seven
[1:10:56] voices would be known by the real true
[1:10:58] church oh glory of course by them
[1:11:00] thunderstorm voices out those voices the
[1:11:03] true church will know what those voices
[1:11:05] are let's continue now watch
[1:11:09] there are atmospheres from these two
[1:11:12] sources
[1:11:13] knowledge and faith
[1:11:15] both release our atmosphere
[1:11:18] so there are some people that where they
[1:11:19] could sit down for six hours
[1:11:24] because there is the atmosphere of
[1:11:25] knowledge
[1:11:26] and information and you know there are
[1:11:28] some people i know somebody who always
[1:11:30] wanted to study
[1:11:32] but guess what they're talking
[1:11:34] work
[1:11:38] so instead of going on going on to get a
[1:11:40] job they only go in degree after degree
[1:11:42] after degree after degree after degree
[1:11:44] and you know what they're not even
[1:11:46] finishing a degree
[1:11:47] so by time they definitely want to jump
[1:11:49] on the next one jump on the next one no
[1:11:50] this is real this isn't that i'm not
[1:11:51] making fun you know
[1:11:53] or because they don't want to go to
[1:11:58] it's easier to do studies
[1:12:01] and there's some people just like that
[1:12:02] in church
[1:12:04] they're easy to get knowledge they don't
[1:12:05] want to go and get applied to apply the
[1:12:08] knowledge that they hear into their
[1:12:09] lives
[1:12:10] that's what he's supposed to be working
[1:12:11] on working on you
[1:12:14] not working on the world working on you
[1:12:16] creating the atmosphere for the world to
[1:12:18] be effective to you because all them
[1:12:20] heard moses and it was not effective to
[1:12:22] them
[1:12:23] oh glory to god only just one caleb the
[1:12:26] world had effect on oh glory to god so i
[1:12:28] could appreciate all the gray i have
[1:12:30] turned greater and fall off
[1:12:32] except you apply it except it become
[1:12:35] effective to you you're wasting your
[1:12:36] time
[1:12:39] is that honest
[1:12:40] i mean with you you're wasting your time
[1:12:42] yeah come here to waste your time you
[1:12:44] come here to get the word for your soul
[1:12:46] oh glory to god you're coming here the
[1:12:48] voice of god in the last days we had to
[1:12:50] pump that word word after word afterward
[1:12:53] when you leave here you must feel full
[1:12:55] glory to god hallelujah you must feel
[1:12:58] full with the word of god
[1:13:00] hallelujah yours feel full with extra
[1:13:02] oil
[1:13:04] hallelujah this gospel extra insider you
[1:13:08] and then god gonna turn this word into
[1:13:10] spirit
[1:13:12] and you have the oil already in word
[1:13:13] form
[1:13:14] why the foolish vision couldn't get it
[1:13:16] didn't have the word to turn to spirit
[1:13:18] oh give the lord a shout the secret is
[1:13:21] the word and the pride
[1:13:23] my word is spirit and life so god
[1:13:26] disguise the oil as the word and say the
[1:13:29] secret is the word is in the bride and
[1:13:31] all these years they're getting the word
[1:13:33] inside of you my sheep hear my voice a
