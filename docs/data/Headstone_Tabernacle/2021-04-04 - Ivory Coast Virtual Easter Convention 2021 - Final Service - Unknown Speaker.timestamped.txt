[47:40] your behalf
[47:41] for the grace of god which is given you
[47:43] by jesus christ
[47:45] that in everything you are enriched by
[47:47] him in all utterances
[47:49] and in all knowledge even as the
[47:51] testimony of christ was confirmed in you
[47:54] so that ye come behind in no gift
[47:57] waiting for the coming of our lord jesus
[48:00] christ
[48:00] and that is what are we awaiting in our
[48:02] personal life we are waiting
[48:04] for the coming of the lord jesus christ
[48:06] in ours
[48:07] amen praise the lord and in a german
[48:09] translation in the amplified
[48:10] it is written not a coming of the lord
[48:12] but a revelation of jesus christ
[48:15] that he reveals himself to us that the
[48:17] whales are broken up
[48:19] and we see jesus christ amen and his
[48:21] ministry again
[48:23] in our lives amen verse 8 who

[48:38] amen personally reveal to us
[48:41] christ coming out of the pages
[48:45] of the book coming out in our lives
[48:49] by a harmony of the words and it struck
[48:53] me so much
[48:53] when christ is coming christ is not
[48:55] coming alone
[48:57] he's coming with a ministry when christ
[49:00] comes there's always a
[49:02] ministry connected to it and at the end
[49:04] time
[49:05] another ministry is connected and this
[49:08] ministry
[49:09] when jesus comes is going to be the same
[49:10] ministry as it was when jesus christ was
[49:13] on the earth
[49:14] and the same ministry that adams should
[49:16] have had and should have
[49:18] shown as a manifestation but it was
[49:21] vindicated in jesus christ
[49:23] and a wave chief with the prophet and
[49:26] again in the pride
[49:27] hallelujah brother branham in the statue
[49:30] of a perfect man
[49:31] hallelujah praise the lord you you may
[49:33] be seated if you want
[49:34] amen hallelujah he says so watch this
[49:37] here's the key
[49:38] he says so face take the little hinges
[49:41] of the scriptures
[49:42] and unlocks the glories and the good of
[49:44] god
[49:45] hallelujah so face takes that little
[49:48] hinges
[49:48] face gets a grip into the little hinges
[49:50] hallelujah and it unlocks
[49:52] the prophet says the glories and the
[49:54] good of the lord out to his people
[49:56] so its face holds the key that unlocks
[49:59] christ
[50:00] to the people and i said christ doesn't
[50:02] come alone but christ comes with a
[50:04] ministry
[50:04] so face unlocks that hallelujah face
[50:07] unlocks heaven hallelujah
[50:09] and the goodness of the lord jesus
[50:11] christ amen
[50:12] what happened in the garden of adam adam
[50:15] had a ministry
[50:17] adam had a key but he
[50:21] doubted and he lost the ministry
[50:26] that's what adam lost he still believed
[50:29] in god
[50:30] he still believed in the promise but he
[50:33] lost the ministry of it
[50:35] but christ came back two thousand years
[50:38] ago
[50:39] and restored it back and he got the key
[50:42] out of
[50:43] hell he got on easter he got a key
[50:46] and he came back victorious and so now
[50:49] the pride
[50:50] has the key and he's gonna have to make
[50:53] same ministry
[50:54] the key unlocks the ministry of jesus
[50:57] christ
[50:58] amen what it takes what does it take
[51:03] it takes the same condition that jesus
[51:05] had
[51:06] and jesus was in brother brahm says the
[51:08] word of god
[51:09] look at jesus he says the word of god
[51:11] flowed through him
[51:13] so freely before he said through a
[51:15] sinless nature
[51:16] that even he could speak a word and it
[51:19] would create
[51:20] so you see that showed who he was who
[51:23] can
[51:23] create but god see god is the only
[51:26] creator there
[51:27] and he was so in perfect harmony that's
[51:30] one i want to emphasize
[51:32] jesus himself was in a perfect harmony
[51:35] hallelujah
[51:36] him and the word was so perfectly
[51:38] together until he created
[51:40] hallelujah he and he and the word began
[51:43] being won
[51:44] hallelujah so the harmony with the word
[51:47] the harmony with the promise and a face
[51:49] into it
[51:50] the harmony in the face hallelujah it
[51:53] will unlock the heaven
[51:54] and you will start to create hallelujah
[51:56] it takes a perfect harmony
[51:59] as jesus was he said not my will
[52:02] i can nothing do except i see the father
[52:05] doing
[52:06] hallelujah jesus when he healed the sick
[52:11] he was in perfect harmony with the world
[52:14] when he raised the dead
[52:16] when he broke the bread he was in
[52:19] perfect harmony with the word
[52:21] hallelujah when they spit on him
[52:25] he still was in perfect harmony when he
[52:28] was
[52:28] on the cross jesus was still in the same
[52:31] perfect harmony
[52:33] and he was so much in the heart in in
[52:35] the in harmony
[52:36] with the world that when his body was
[52:39] laying
[52:40] there in the grave the body
[52:44] itself was had to be in the harmony with
[52:48] the world
[52:48] and it was raised up on the third day
[52:51] because even the body had to obey
[52:53] and be in harmony with the world and so
[52:55] shall we be
[52:56] in harmony with the world that one day
[52:59] our body
[53:00] is going to change because we are in
[53:02] harmony back
[53:03] in the world amenity brother abraham
[53:06] speaks about that and we heard it on
[53:07] friday
[53:08] in a message shalom and brother branham
[53:10] speaks about it
[53:11] he speaks about the great symphony let
[53:14] me just strike it that
[53:16] and brother branham said the director
[53:18] and the composer must be in the same
[53:20] spirit
[53:21] and it's so he says master musicians be
[53:24] in the same
[53:25] spirit to act it all out it must be a
[53:28] perfect harmony
[53:30] like the little wheel in the watch a
[53:32] perfect harmony
[53:33] hallelujah and he says brother prince
[53:35] says you must
[53:37] begin in the music like he did
[53:40] so let's like he did i can do nothing
[53:44] except i see the father doing it final
[53:47] quote
[53:50] in a message the spoken word is the
[53:52] original seat
[53:54] paragraph 420 says notice what harmony
[53:58] it starts with harmony jesus never did
[54:01] anything
[54:02] until scene of the father or the father
[54:04] showed him first
[54:06] a harmony between god and christ see
[54:08] john 5 19
[54:10] and then he says so will the pride
[54:13] hallelujah we will be in the same
[54:14] harmony
[54:15] as jesus christ was hallelujah praise
[54:18] the lord
[54:19] so will the pride and he shows her the
[54:21] word of life
[54:23] he shows her and she receives it
[54:26] hallelujah
[54:27] that can start a revival and start a
[54:29] harmony she never doubts it
[54:31] and then he says here's the secret he
[54:33] says the word is in the pride
[54:35] hallelujah praise the lord it's ready
[54:38] for harmony time
[54:39] it's ready easter harmony time the word
[54:42] is in the pride
[54:43] and the mind of christ to know what's to
[54:45] be done to the word
[54:46] we what he wants to done
[54:49] with the word and what does he want done
[54:51] with the word
[54:52] he wants harmony for the ministry of
[54:54] christ to come forward in your life
[54:57] that's what he wants and she does it in
[55:00] his name
[55:01] and she has thus as the lord hallelujah
[55:04] they only will do his will
[55:07] perfect harmony lord
[55:11] i can do nothing except i see you
[55:14] show it me in your word perfect harmony
[55:18] satan has no entrance in this harmony
[55:22] no entrance in this symphony it's
[55:25] playing perfect
[55:26] and we are joining into it we're getting
[55:28] into the rhythm of it
[55:30] it's a perfect harmony and no one can
[55:32] persuade them differently
[55:35] they have dust as the lord or they keep
[55:37] still
[55:38] that's the perfect harmony and then they
[55:40] will do the works of god
[55:42] for it's himself in them continuing his
[55:45] word
[55:45] to fulfill and he did complete in his
[55:48] days
[55:48] so it's him fulfilling it the ministry
[55:52] of christ
[55:53] in your life it's him fulfilling the
[55:57] promise
[55:58] in your life a ministry of christ
[56:02] again was like it was in edom
[56:05] but this time hallelujah the this pride
[56:08] the prophet said
[56:09] it shall not fail and let me say these
[56:13] words
[56:14] i really thought about it how can i
[56:17] express it
[56:19] in a few words
[56:22] faith in his word
[56:25] brings you in full harmony with the word
[56:29] to unlock the heavens and to reveal
[56:33] christ in you the hope of glory
[56:36] for a vindication of the ministry
[56:39] of christ there's gonna be a vindication
[56:43] of the ministry of christ in you
[56:46] in every pride member around the world
[56:48] there's gonna be
[56:50] this vindication hallelujah and the
[56:52] prophet says
[56:54] when the last promise is vindicated
[56:57] then there will come an eternal peace
[57:00] upon the earth
[57:01] an eternal shalom and i say happy easter
[57:05] shalom to the pride we are back to the

[1:11:09] speak lip to hear to your children we
[1:11:11] are completely waiting on you in the
[1:11:13] precious name of jesus christ and the
[1:11:15] church says
[1:11:16] amen and amen so before i do my
[1:11:19] greetings i do want to get to this
[1:11:20] scripture
[1:11:22] if you have your bibles would you turn
[1:11:24] with me to
[1:11:25] one portion of scripture
[1:11:29] and we're going to be in the book of
[1:11:31] romans
[1:11:36] romans 8 and uh
[1:11:39] in romans this is a part of the
[1:11:41] scripture of the inspiration of this
[1:11:43] meeting
[1:11:45] so we're going to read from romans 8 and
[1:11:47] reading
[1:11:48] from verse 19.
[1:11:53] romans 8 and verse 19 for the earnest
[1:11:56] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:12:00] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:12:02] for the creature was made subject to
[1:12:04] vanity not willingly
[1:12:06] but by reason of him who had subjected
[1:12:09] the same in hope because the creature
[1:12:13] itself
[1:12:14] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:12:16] of corruption
[1:12:17] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:12:19] children of god
[1:12:21] for we know that the whole creation
[1:12:23] grown it and travail it in pain together
[1:12:25] until now and not only they but
[1:12:27] ourselves also which have the first
[1:12:29] fruits of the spirit
[1:12:31] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:12:34] waiting for the adoption to with the
[1:12:36] redemption
[1:12:37] of our body and in this same romans 8
[1:12:40] i'd like us to go down to verse 31
[1:12:44] just a little later down in the same
[1:12:46] chapter what shall we then say
[1:12:48] to these things if god be for us
[1:12:52] who can be against us he that spared not
[1:12:55] his own son but delivered him up for us
[1:12:57] all how shall he not with him also
[1:13:00] freely give us
[1:13:01] all things who shall lay anything to the
[1:13:04] charge of god's elect it is god that
[1:13:06] justify it
[1:13:07] who is he that condemn it it is christ
[1:13:09] that died ye rather
[1:13:11] that is risen again who is even at the
[1:13:13] right hand of god
[1:13:15] who also maketh intercession for us
[1:13:18] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:13:20] christ
[1:13:21] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:13:24] persecution
[1:13:25] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[1:13:29] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:13:31] killed all the day long we are counted
[1:13:33] as sheep for the slaughter
[1:13:35] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:13:38] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:13:40] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:13:42] nor life
[1:13:43] nor angels nor principalities no powers
[1:13:47] nor things present nor things to come no
[1:13:50] height no depth no any other creature
[1:13:53] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:13:54] love of god
[1:13:55] which is in christ jesus our lord may
[1:13:57] the lord add a blessing to the reading
[1:13:59] of his word
[1:14:00] you may be seated this morning this
[1:14:02] evening
[1:14:03] whenever you'd be connecting to this
[1:14:05] service

[1:15:21] hatsune aminaki here for their prayers
[1:15:22] support feet
[1:15:24] and the atmosphere of worship because
[1:15:26] it's the atmosphere that brings the
[1:15:27] results
[1:15:29] hallelujah
[1:15:31] [Applause]
[1:15:33] that anointing of worship that
[1:15:35] atmosphere of despite what's going on in
[1:15:37] your life you
[1:15:38] recognize that he is worthy of the
[1:15:39] praise he is worthy
[1:15:41] of the worship worship has nothing to do
[1:15:44] with how you feel it has all to do with
[1:15:45] who god is worship has nothing to do
[1:15:47] with
[1:15:48] what happened yesterday it has all to do
[1:15:50] with that he is our king he is our lord
[1:15:52] he is our
[1:15:53] redeemer he is our master he is our king
[1:15:56] not just king but king of kings he is
[1:15:58] not just
[1:15:59] lord but he is lord of lords he is
[1:16:02] mighty in battle and in this easter
[1:16:04] season
[1:16:04] when we come together to remember and
[1:16:07] every time
[1:16:07] every day is a memory a reminder that he
[1:16:10] is risen but in this meeting
[1:16:11] we come to to calibrate back who we are
[1:16:14] in god and and remind ourselves that he
[1:16:17] is not dead he is alive
[1:16:18] and because he lives we can live all
[1:16:20] soap because he is raised from the dead
[1:16:22] we also raise with him hallelujah and
[1:16:26] that's our position
[1:16:27] as believers you believe that this
[1:16:29] morning
[1:16:30] amen and brother paul uh was led with a
[1:16:34] really
[1:16:35] really powerful a big mountain of
[1:16:37] inspiration for these meetings
[1:16:39] uh the theme of the convention is the
[1:16:41] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:16:44] as they were in the garden of eden
[1:16:47] i'll say that one more time the
[1:16:48] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:16:50] as they were in the garden of eden with
[1:16:53] an inspiration the ministry of the bride
[1:16:56] and the ministry of christ are the same
[1:16:58] ministry what a statement
[1:17:00] to know that the ministry of christ and
[1:17:02] the ministry of the bride is the same
[1:17:03] thing
[1:17:04] a continuation of the book of acts it
[1:17:06] was not
[1:17:07] acts of the apostles but it was the acts
[1:17:09] of the holy ghost in the apostles
[1:17:11] and what we are continuation of that
[1:17:13] book of acts
[1:17:14] we are an extension of what god's plan
[1:17:16] was that's unfolding in this hour
[1:17:18] and in this season and nothing is going
[1:17:20] to stop it the pandemic cannot stop it
[1:17:23] lockdown cannot stop it what the
[1:17:25] government does cannot stop it
[1:17:27] what the economy does cannot stop it
[1:17:29] because this manifestation of the sons
[1:17:32] of god
[1:17:33] must come to pass amen so
[1:17:36] you know in these virtual conventions uh
[1:17:39] you know you you
[1:17:40] you are not able to hear what everybody
[1:17:43] preaches
[1:17:44] and so you're moving by inspiration and
[1:17:48] i don't know if what will be said in
[1:17:49] this service would have been said
[1:17:51] already but if it is said before and it
[1:17:54] is said again today it is
[1:17:56] it is just because god wants to bring
[1:17:57] emphasis on something
[1:17:59] so we want to stay in the spirit and
[1:18:00] stand a great expectation for god to do
[1:18:03] something special for us because we are
[1:18:05] looking at the same target we
[1:18:06] are focused on the same vision we are
[1:18:08] looking at this this sun's coming back
[1:18:10] into position and
[1:18:11] and and we're all around this same
[1:18:13] mountain of power this mountain of
[1:18:15] adoption this
[1:18:16] mountain of suns coming back to take
[1:18:18] back from the devil
[1:18:19] what was stolen from us sons coming back
[1:18:22] hallelujah father's back in position
[1:18:25] mothers back in position
[1:18:26] housewives adopted ministers adopted
[1:18:29] believers in their place hallelujah
[1:18:32] glory to god amen so
[1:18:36] oh my so i do have a title this evening
[1:18:39] or this morning
[1:18:40] and uh whenever the lord will have this
[1:18:42] this message to be part of the meeting
[1:18:45] and uh i do believe that the law give me
[1:18:47] something here and i trust that it comes
[1:18:49] from a different angle
[1:18:50] and it'll be a blessing to you so for a
[1:18:52] title
[1:18:53] this evening the sons of god will have
[1:18:57] the final answer
[1:18:59] the sons of god will have the final
[1:19:02] answer
[1:19:03] and a subject what shall we then say to
[1:19:05] these things
[1:19:07] that's a subject it's a question what
[1:19:09] shall we then say to these things
[1:19:11] and an inspiration we have the devil's
[1:19:13] answer
[1:19:15] can the church say man so just to lay a
[1:19:18] background
[1:19:19] i'm a simple preacher i know the the
[1:19:21] they are there are some some
[1:19:23] some really strong preachers who i don't
[1:19:26] consider myself one of them i'm a simple
[1:19:28] preacher i'm a bible student i'm a i'm a
[1:19:30] bible preacher and i
[1:19:31] i'm comfortable in that element there so
[1:19:34] i want a little background before i get
[1:19:36] to the thought this morning
[1:19:37] and it's that life is full of questions
[1:19:41] there are many questions you go to live
[1:19:42] life is full of questions
[1:19:44] who am i what is my purpose
[1:19:48] what must i do where should i go
[1:19:51] when should i do it what career i'm
[1:19:54] supposed to have
[1:19:55] what church should i go to all these are
[1:19:58] questions some
[1:19:58] simple some are complex but every day we
[1:20:02] are faced with questions
[1:20:03] what should i wear what scripture should
[1:20:06] i read
[1:20:07] questions and more questions and these
[1:20:09] are some of the questions we ask
[1:20:11] ourselves
[1:20:13] but then there are questions that we are
[1:20:14] asked that other people ask us
[1:20:17] where are you what were you doing
[1:20:21] what time did you arrive what is your
[1:20:24] plan
[1:20:26] what do you want what do you need
[1:20:30] then there are questions that we could
[1:20:31] ask of other people
[1:20:34] how can i help you how are you doing
[1:20:37] when asked you ask somebody how are you
[1:20:39] doing not
[1:20:39] not as a formality but because you're
[1:20:42] really interested in how
[1:20:44] are you doing questions such as how can
[1:20:47] i
[1:20:47] help and there's this thing about
[1:20:50] questions and i want you
[1:20:51] i'm building a background we're going
[1:20:52] somewhere questions can be used to
[1:20:55] investigate
[1:20:57] questions can be used to research
[1:21:01] questions can be used to test so to
[1:21:04] validate if you know something you have
[1:21:06] an exam and the examination comes
[1:21:08] in the form of questions questions can
[1:21:11] be used to challenge
[1:21:13] hallelujah and and we'll see it in
[1:21:14] scripture are you for us
[1:21:16] or are you against us that's a question
[1:21:18] that's used as a challenge
[1:21:20] questions can be used to embarrass
[1:21:25] could anything good come out of nazareth
[1:21:28] anybody with me this morning
[1:21:30] questions can be used to confirm
[1:21:33] are you a christian
[1:21:36] questions can be used to teach questions
[1:21:40] can be used to convict
[1:21:43] is your heart right with god
[1:21:46] are you living the right way questions
[1:21:48] can be used to make you think
[1:21:51] questions can be used to cause you to
[1:21:54] reflect
[1:21:56] unanswered questions can lead to fear
[1:22:00] you don't know if you're doing the right
[1:22:01] thing so you're asking questions is this
[1:22:02] the right place to work
[1:22:05] is this the right church to be in is it
[1:22:07] all these are questions
[1:22:09] and when the questions are not answered
[1:22:11] they can lead to fear
[1:22:13] they can lead to concern they could lead
[1:22:15] to
[1:22:16] uncertainty they could lead to being
[1:22:18] misinformed
[1:22:20] when questions are answered you get
[1:22:22] clarity
[1:22:24] you get direction you get purpose
[1:22:27] and you can get insight anybody with me
[1:22:29] this morning
[1:22:30] we're going somewhere i'm kind of
[1:22:32] teaching a little bible study a little
[1:22:34] preaching but
[1:22:35] i want to encourage you a little bit
[1:22:38] they are different types of questions
[1:22:40] they are open
[1:22:42] questions open questions give you room
[1:22:44] to run
[1:22:45] to answer the question so how would you
[1:22:48] approach this particular situation
[1:22:50] it's an open question you could answer
[1:22:52] it how you feel led so how you feel
[1:22:54] about the law that's a that's an open
[1:22:56] question you could you could take it
[1:22:57] anywhere you want so
[1:22:58] i feel that he's my king he's my god
[1:23:00] he's my waymaker it's a it's an open
[1:23:03] question you can take it however you
[1:23:04] want to take it
[1:23:08] they are closed questions close
[1:23:10] questions focus your answer on yes or no
[1:23:13] are you a disciple that's what peter was
[1:23:17] asked
[1:23:18] a close question there was there was no
[1:23:20] room for him to maneuver
[1:23:22] to answer some other kind of way there
[1:23:24] was no halfway answer in the closed
[1:23:26] question anybody with me this morning
[1:23:31] then there are loaded questions
[1:23:35] a loaded question is to try to trap you
[1:23:37] like many times they ask jesus presence
[1:23:39] to try to trap jesus
[1:23:41] so a loaded question is like did you
[1:23:43] take two pieces of chicken or three
[1:23:46] pieces of chicken
[1:23:49] no matter how you answer the question
[1:23:51] you are admitting to taking the chicken
[1:23:54] i'm giving you an option did you take
[1:23:56] two pieces or three pieces
[1:23:59] but the motive for asking the question
[1:24:01] could be really to ascertain if you were
[1:24:03] the one who took the chicken in the
[1:24:05] first place
[1:24:07] so that's a loaded question then we have
[1:24:09] rhetorical questions
[1:24:12] rhetorical questions uh young people say
[1:24:14] you're asking answers
[1:24:16] so are we in church today that's a
[1:24:17] that's a question but it's
[1:24:19] it's a rhetorical question we know we're
[1:24:20] here
[1:24:22] anybody with me there are leading
[1:24:25] questions
[1:24:28] are you sure you want to go tomorrow
[1:24:30] it's a question but there's a
[1:24:32] there's an element of the question that
[1:24:34] could motivate your decision to do or
[1:24:36] not do
[1:24:37] are you sure depending on how i ask the
[1:24:40] question it could place doubt in your
[1:24:41] hand
[1:24:42] are you sure you really want to do that
[1:24:45] so it's a leading question and depending
[1:24:48] on the motive of the person
[1:24:49] asking the question it could take you
[1:24:53] somewhere
[1:24:55] you have a problem with brother so and
[1:24:56] so don't you
[1:24:58] that's a leading question it's to carry
[1:25:01] you to a certain place even if you
[1:25:03] didn't have a problem and brother so and
[1:25:04] so
[1:25:05] all of a sudden you better think of all
[1:25:06] the possible problems
[1:25:08] that you might have had with brother so
[1:25:10] and so but he didn't shake my
[1:25:12] hand last week i do have a
[1:25:15] problem with brother sue and so i didn't
[1:25:18] realize it until you
[1:25:19] made me aware of the problem i didn't
[1:25:21] know i had
[1:25:23] that's a leading question and i'm not
[1:25:26] going to go
[1:25:26] on and on because i'm showing you there
[1:25:28] are different types of questions they
[1:25:29] are probing questions
[1:25:31] they are funnel questions they are
[1:25:33] recall questions when were you saved
[1:25:35] when when did the lord call you
[1:25:38] anybody with me so i'm saying all of
[1:25:41] this
[1:25:42] because we are talking about going back
[1:25:44] to sons of god
[1:25:45] back in edom
[1:25:49] and i want to bring to your attention
[1:25:51] that before or
[1:25:53] outside of god having a direct
[1:25:56] communication with adam in eden
[1:26:01] outside of the communication between
[1:26:04] god and adam the first question recorded
[1:26:07] in
[1:26:08] scripture is what did god say
[1:26:14] the beginning of the fall of man started
[1:26:17] with a question
[1:26:20] before this question what did god say
[1:26:22] there were no questions
[1:26:30] i'll say it one more time outside check
[1:26:32] it in your bible outside of god
[1:26:34] speaking directly to adam there was no
[1:26:37] reason for
[1:26:38] adam to ask god a question there was no
[1:26:40] reason for god to ask adam a question
[1:26:43] there was full transparency adam was in
[1:26:45] his position
[1:26:46] of authority he was in his position of
[1:26:48] supreme control what he needed to know
[1:26:51] he knew
[1:26:52] god gave him everything he needed to be
[1:26:54] king ruler god of this earth and what if
[1:26:57] branham said
[1:26:57] he wasn't wondering what he was about he
[1:27:00] wasn't
[1:27:00] perplexed or mortified or concerned or
[1:27:04] questioning why am i here he knew why he
[1:27:07] was there
[1:27:07] he knew that every place he put his foot
[1:27:10] was his
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:12] he had no questions so when we're going
[1:27:15] back to eden we're going back to where
[1:27:17] there's no doubt
[1:27:18] there's no question there's no confusion
[1:27:20] there's no wandering anybody with me
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:24] we're building so that first
[1:27:28] question what did god say
[1:27:32] because a question can be used depending
[1:27:34] on the motive and the agenda
[1:27:36] the question what did god say was not
[1:27:38] for satan to get clarity
[1:27:41] it was not for satan to get
[1:27:43] understanding on knowledge it was to try
[1:27:45] to exploit
[1:27:46] weakness so his question was asked what
[1:27:50] a motive
[1:27:51] so when people ask you questions you
[1:27:53] have to know where they're coming from
[1:27:56] what are they trying to achieve what are
[1:27:58] they trying to do
[1:28:00] because the fall of man started with it
[1:28:02] seemed an innocent question
[1:28:04] even now if i ask that question it'll be
[1:28:07] considered positive
[1:28:08] what did god say about healing what did
[1:28:10] god say about revival
[1:28:12] what did god say about perfection in
[1:28:14] isolation the question is not the
[1:28:16] problem
[1:28:16] but the motive behind the question
[1:28:20] was the issue back there in genesis
[1:28:23] anybody with me this morning
[1:28:25] just a little teaching to encourage you
[1:28:27] a little bit right
[1:28:29] how this question was handled is
[1:28:31] connected to everything that follows
[1:28:35] because eve had a choice with how to
[1:28:37] respond to that question
[1:28:39] and we have choices with how we respond
[1:28:42] to the questions that come our way
[1:28:47] i want you to remember my title is the
[1:28:50] sons of god
[1:28:51] will have the final answer and you only
[1:28:54] answer to a question right
[1:28:56] and my subject what shall we then say to
[1:28:59] these things this was a
[1:29:00] question that paul asks to the romans
[1:29:02] and i have an inspiration we have the
[1:29:04] devil's answer
[1:29:05] which is taken directly from what the
[1:29:07] prophet said can we can we keep going
[1:29:09] today i trust it will be an
[1:29:11] encouragement to you
[1:29:13] so how this question even was answered
[1:29:16] is connected to everything that followed
[1:29:19] eve could have said i'm not answering
[1:29:21] this question wait till adam come home
[1:29:26] there was a choice and she chose to
[1:29:30] answer the question not
[1:29:31] expecting or suspecting that there was
[1:29:34] an ulterior motive
[1:29:37] we studied in the study of joseph when
[1:29:40] the father asked the sons jacob after
[1:29:41] something why did you tell them about
[1:29:43] your family they said he
[1:29:44] he asked questions about us we didn't
[1:29:46] how were we to know
[1:29:47] that he was going to try to lock up our
[1:29:49] brother we had no way
[1:29:51] the questions came across innocently
[1:29:54] anybody with me
[1:29:56] so we have to appreciate the fact that
[1:29:58] satan had been kicked out
[1:30:00] out of heaven he had lost access to many
[1:30:03] things
[1:30:04] and his question is what you call a
[1:30:06] probing question he was he was probing
[1:30:08] what did
[1:30:09] what did god say here hallelujah
[1:30:14] so that first question asked in genesis
[1:30:16] was what did god say and the
[1:30:18] second question is adam
[1:30:21] adam
[1:30:25] the first question now created a context
[1:30:28] and a situation
[1:30:29] for a follow-up question or or a second
[1:30:31] question or a needed question
[1:30:32] because the way the first question was
[1:30:35] addressed and answered
[1:30:37] created a situation that required god to
[1:30:40] ask
[1:30:43] where are you adam and that's not a
[1:30:45] question to acquire information because
[1:30:47] it's not as if god didn't know
[1:30:49] where he was i want us to appreciate the
[1:30:51] kind of question this is
[1:30:53] it was not adam what is your location
[1:30:57] it was adam what is your condition
[1:31:02] i know where you're at you're you're
[1:31:03] it's only eaten there's only garden here
[1:31:05] we have other i'm not searching for you
[1:31:06] or not
[1:31:09] but but where are you standing because
[1:31:11] you're not where i left you anybody with
[1:31:13] me
[1:31:15] so as scriptures were written some
[1:31:17] questions were answered and we realized
[1:31:20] that as we got deeper
[1:31:21] understanding of the mysteries of god
[1:31:24] new questions would continue to
[1:31:26] emerge because as adam and eve were
[1:31:29] reluctantly pushed out of eden
[1:31:32] they would have had the question how do
[1:31:34] we get back
[1:31:36] how do we get back can we get
[1:31:40] back is there a way to get back
[1:31:43] because adam knew what it felt like

[1:35:44] are where they are going
[1:35:45] he said there's been many great books
[1:35:47] written but there's only one book in the
[1:35:49] world
[1:35:50] that tells you where you come from what
[1:35:52] you are
[1:35:53] and where you're going that's god's word
[1:35:55] the bible
[1:35:56] and every little text in the bible will
[1:35:59] never perish
[1:36:00] because it's god's word you could hang
[1:36:02] your soul
[1:36:03] on any face of god's word or any
[1:36:06] scripture
[1:36:07] any verse or just one word and sometimes
[1:36:11] one word
[1:36:12] could change a man life oh come on now
[1:36:16] so abraham we left abraham thinking
[1:36:19] about his destiny
[1:36:20] thinking about that city and there we
[1:36:22] find job job had a big question
[1:36:25] in job 14 he said if a man die
[1:36:28] shall he live again that is what stood
[1:36:31] up job
[1:36:32] he sat there in his condition and he had
[1:36:34] this burning question
[1:36:36] he said there got to be something more
[1:36:37] than this can i just read
[1:36:39] what led up to him doing this thing here
[1:36:42] oh hallelujah may be seated
[1:36:44] job 14 verse 1 and this is job in the
[1:36:47] middle of his condition brother papua
[1:36:49] he is looking at his life he is looking
[1:36:51] at his experiences
[1:36:52] he is looking at what has happened and
[1:36:54] out of it he is coming to
[1:36:56] point of questions and reflections and
[1:36:59] analysis because something in him oh
[1:37:02] hallelujah that he didn't put himself
[1:37:06] he didn't put it himself and in the
[1:37:08] midst of his situation
[1:37:10] we know god asked him a question he said
[1:37:12] job
[1:37:13] where was thou when i used
[1:37:16] you getting it this morning he asked a
[1:37:19] question to job
[1:37:20] to judge memory that you are bigger than
[1:37:23] this situation
[1:37:24] that the trial the testing the pandemic
[1:37:28] what is present what is past what
[1:37:30] happened yesterday

[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:43] you may be cheated so job is there
[1:37:47] oh hallelujah i don't know about you but
[1:37:49] me as an individual
[1:37:51] i think about death i think about life i
[1:37:54] think about the length of time when
[1:37:56] there's it
[1:37:56] it's reflective it makes you do things
[1:37:58] at a level of urgency
[1:38:00] it makes you wonder about wasting time
[1:38:02] and using time and here is job
[1:38:05] in job 14 saying man is born of a woman
[1:38:09] man that is born of a woman is a few
[1:38:10] days and full of trouble
[1:38:13] he come and fought like a flower and is
[1:38:15] cut down
[1:38:17] he flew it also as a shadow and continue
[1:38:20] with not
[1:38:21] so job is describing what he is seeing
[1:38:23] with his natural eyes
[1:38:24] he said and does thou open thine eyes
[1:38:27] upon such and one
[1:38:28] and brings me the judgment with v who
[1:38:31] can bring a clean
[1:38:32] thing out of an unclean so job is
[1:38:36] looking at it he said there's got to
[1:38:37] is there a way to move from being
[1:38:39] unclean
[1:38:40] to being clean is there a way to move
[1:38:43] from sinner
[1:38:44] to santa is there a way to move on being
[1:38:46] unwashed
[1:38:47] to be in wash oh hallelujah
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:52] job is going through his his questions
[1:38:55] hallelujah
[1:38:56] and he goes on seeing his days are
[1:38:58] determined
[1:39:00] the number of his months are with thee
[1:39:02] so why are you worried about
[1:39:04] life and death when your days are
[1:39:06] already numbered
[1:39:08] oh come on now somebody help me this
[1:39:09] morning though
[1:39:11] has appointed his bones that he cannot
[1:39:14] pass
[1:39:15] so job is seen i've realized that as
[1:39:17] much as i try to go beyond
[1:39:19] what i want to go a man tries to go
[1:39:21] beyond what he wants to go
[1:39:22] you can run around the savannah you can
[1:39:24] jog all you want to do if there's a line
[1:39:26] that god said you cannot pass
[1:39:28] you cannot pass because he's the one
[1:39:30] that determined
[1:39:31] you're going out you're coming in he's

[1:39:53] shall accomplish
[1:39:54] as an island his day and job is now
[1:39:56] bringing a context he said
[1:39:58] for there is hope of a tree if it be cut
[1:40:01] down
[1:40:02] that it'll sprout again and that the
[1:40:04] tender branch thereof will not cease
[1:40:06] though the root thereof was all in the
[1:40:08] earth and the stalk thereof died in the
[1:40:11] ground
[1:40:11] yet through the scent of water he said
[1:40:14] when this tree go down
[1:40:15] when the scent of water you ever smell
[1:40:17] water i don't know how
[1:40:19] fresh water to smell but but he said
[1:40:20] when these trees have to smell water
[1:40:23] it brings it's had to grow again he said
[1:40:25] there's a way for a tree
[1:40:27] to be restored this is the easter
[1:40:30] message now
[1:40:31] anybody with me
[1:40:34] verse 10 but man died and wasted away ye
[1:40:38] man give it up the ghost and where is he
[1:40:41] there has to be a place
[1:40:43] there it can't be that the trees can get
[1:40:45] restored and man can be restored a
[1:40:47] cavity tree
[1:40:48] could get his scent of water and he'd be
[1:40:50] refreshed
[1:40:51] and there's no way for man to be
[1:40:53] refreshed
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:40:58] hallelujah as the waters feel from the
[1:41:01] sea
[1:41:02] and the flood decayeth and dryeth up
[1:41:05] so man lie it down and rise it not
[1:41:09] till the heavens be no more they shall
[1:41:11] not awake no be raised out of their
[1:41:12] sleep
[1:41:13] oh that door would just hide me in the
[1:41:15] grave that would that dog would just
[1:41:17] keep me secret
[1:41:18] until thy wrath we pass that dog with us
[1:41:21] appoint me a set time and remember me
[1:41:23] and then verse 14 if a man die shall he
[1:41:26] live again
[1:41:27] all the days of my appointed time will i
[1:41:29] wait
[1:41:30] until my change comes can the church say
[1:41:33] amen
[1:41:38] i may know the testimony it'll be job
[1:41:40] that will scream out
[1:41:41] i know my redeemer lived
[1:41:46] hallelujah anybody feeling fine
[1:41:49] oh hallelujah so we leave abraham he's
[1:41:53] seeking a city
[1:41:54] and although job knew his redeemer lived
[1:41:58] job also didn't get the complete answer
[1:42:00] because he also went down into the
[1:42:02] ground
[1:42:04] hallelujah hallelujah he got a taste of
[1:42:07] the answer he got a revelation of the
[1:42:09] answer
[1:42:10] but the answer was still coming
[1:42:13] anybody with me can we take a little
[1:42:15] more
[1:42:18] we're talking about questions and
[1:42:19] answers
[1:42:21] here we have a situation now where with
[1:42:24] a branham and the message
[1:42:25] what here is thou elijah he's speaking
[1:42:27] about moses
[1:42:28] and i said lord one time moses wanted to
[1:42:32] know
[1:42:33] this is his question what you look like
[1:42:37] hallelujah oh to know what he looks like
[1:42:41] and you took him over to a cleft and a
[1:42:43] rock and you hit him
[1:42:46] and when you pass by moses said it
[1:42:48] looked like the back of a man
[1:42:52] but moses didn't get to walk with that
[1:42:54] man
[1:42:55] he didn't get to eat with that man so he
[1:42:57] also got a part answer
[1:43:00] to the question and the question
[1:43:02] remained unanswered in its fullness
[1:43:05] because something had to happen with the
[1:43:06] pop well to fully answer the questions
[1:43:09] that abraham had and that and that job
[1:43:12] had and that
[1:43:13] abraham had that and that moses had
[1:43:18] everybody with me moses isn't
[1:43:21] in his experience and
[1:43:25] he would ask his own question of god who
[1:43:27] shall i say send me
[1:43:30] i need an answer for that i can't just
[1:43:32] go and talk to them i want to
[1:43:34] i have a question is there a question in
[1:43:36] your heart that you want god to answer
[1:43:38] for you today
[1:43:39] in this convention in this meeting and
[1:43:41] god respond to moses
[1:43:43] that's what i'm saying some question god
[1:43:45] answered immediately
[1:43:46] and others he had to wait for the
[1:43:48] appointed time for the answer to the
[1:43:50] question
[1:43:51] everybody with me so when moses said who
[1:43:54] shall i say
[1:43:55] send me he said tell them i am
[1:43:58] that i am oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:44:02] hallelujah
[1:44:04] glory and i want us to build
[1:44:07] a little bit to i'm crafting the
[1:44:10] unanswered questions
[1:44:13] so there came a point where we know the
[1:44:16] sacrifice and the way the sacrifice had
[1:44:18] to be performed had to be done
[1:44:20] a certain way you couldn't just pull any
[1:44:23] kind of animal
[1:44:24] to do sacrifice and not only for the
[1:44:27] approved animals
[1:44:28] the animals had to be in a certain
[1:44:29] condition it had to be alarmed without
[1:44:32] blemish
[1:44:33] so in order to bring a lamb without
[1:44:35] blemish with a punch you have to ask the
[1:44:36] question
[1:44:37] does it have a blemish the only way to
[1:44:41] know
[1:44:41] if it has a blemish or not is to ask the
[1:44:43] question and the question would be
[1:44:45] investigative
[1:44:46] because the priest has to check to make
[1:44:48] sure if there's a mark
[1:44:49] that disqualifies it so he could ask the
[1:44:52] question is it qualified
[1:44:55] does it have a blemish and the believer
[1:44:57] would want to know will my sacrifice be
[1:45:00] accepted
[1:45:03] i don't want to take chances with this
[1:45:04] am i doing the right thing am i am i
[1:45:06] coming the right way
[1:45:07] if there's an approach to god the
[1:45:09] question should be is this the right
[1:45:10] approach
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] it's not good enough to know there is an
[1:45:15] approach the question should be what is
[1:45:16] the approach
[1:45:18] am i approaching it the right way
[1:45:22] will this sacrifice be accepted
[1:45:25] but that sacrifice we know of bulls and
[1:45:29] goats and these things
[1:45:30] was limited it was attempting to
[1:45:34] cover sin not
[1:45:38] remove sin so and it was a question but
[1:45:41] i asked me that would
[1:45:42] always have to be asked when is my next
[1:45:45] sacrifice
[1:45:46] do we have the right animal for the
[1:45:48] sacrifice is it with
[1:45:50] and this question would live for
[1:45:52] centuries
[1:45:53] are we ready for the sacrifice is the
[1:45:56] sacrifice ready to be accepted
[1:45:57] is this the right approach and these
[1:45:59] questions such as where is this city
[1:46:01] can a man live again is there a perfect
[1:46:04] sacrifice
[1:46:05] we'll live on and on and on and on
[1:46:07] questions about redemption
[1:46:09] questions about restoration questions
[1:46:11] about going back to the way adam was
[1:46:15] everybody with me we mentioned joshua
[1:46:18] asking a question as a challenge a
[1:46:21] closed question
[1:46:22] are you for us or are you against us he
[1:46:24] wasn't there's no in-betweener there was
[1:46:25] no room for i'm not sure and the captain
[1:46:27] of the whole says
[1:46:28] i'm the captain i've come to give
[1:46:31] instructions
[1:46:33] over and over we can see true scripture
[1:46:36] in the message of basis of fellowship
[1:46:38] but ibrahim said look at elijah the
[1:46:41] prophet
[1:46:42] hallelujah and and he goes on to to
[1:46:46] elijah we we did the bible study when he
[1:46:48] went down into the cave
[1:46:50] after the whole mount carmel experience
[1:46:52] and god fed him with some kicks
[1:46:55] and then he wondered in the wilderness
[1:46:57] he was fleeing from his life
[1:46:59] and god found him and pulled him back in
[1:47:01] the cave somewhere
[1:47:02] the mighty rin while rushing wind went
[1:47:04] by and god wasn't in the wind do you
[1:47:06] remember that
[1:47:07] the thunder went by and he was in the
[1:47:09] thunder but then he said what what does
[1:47:11] that
[1:47:11] hear elijah he had to ask
[1:47:15] elijah what is your condition you come
[1:47:17] from a great victory on carmel
[1:47:19] you let jezebel have you go into hiding
[1:47:21] after your great victory having a pity
[1:47:23] party you want god to kill you
[1:47:28] how many of us do in this pandemic put
[1:47:30] ourselves in our
[1:47:31] cave and hide
[1:47:35] may this message come to you to ask what
[1:47:37] do is though here
[1:47:39] what are you hiding for what are you
[1:47:40] afraid of all the victories you have
[1:47:42] been through
[1:47:43] you will let one situation come and put
[1:47:46] you back and
[1:47:47] and have you all depressed in lord take
[1:47:49] my life no come on now
[1:47:50] come on now rise up rise up sons of god
[1:47:53] rise up daughters of god
[1:47:55] [Applause]
[1:47:56] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:48:00] so i'm dealing with questions and
[1:48:01] answers so god took elijah
[1:48:04] then out of the situation and that's how
[1:48:06] he was commissioned to raise up elijah
[1:48:08] because out of that cave and that
[1:48:09] situation is when god sent him to go and
[1:48:12] pull elisha up
[1:48:15] hallelujah moving on in second-handed
[1:48:17] robe
[1:48:19] this is elisha following elijah
[1:48:22] so you've got to alter yourself to meet
[1:48:24] god's holy spirit that's the prophet
[1:48:26] speaking
[1:48:27] you won't alter the spirit to meet your
[1:48:28] desire see you've got to alter yourself
[1:48:32] so elisha had several years of growing
[1:48:35] in
[1:48:35] to fit the robe he's speaking about his
[1:48:37] character development now
[1:48:39] so he thought it would put him fit him
[1:48:41] pretty well he was on his road up the
[1:48:43] hill
[1:48:44] and elijah turned around the only thing
[1:48:46] that he wanted to know was
[1:48:47] he could ever get the promise that's all
[1:48:49] he wanted and he said now i'm going to
[1:48:50] ask you tell me
[1:48:52] what my desire is he said i want a
[1:48:54] double portion of your spirit to come
[1:48:56] upon me
[1:48:58] what are you going to say and elijah the
[1:49:00] prophet turned around and said
[1:49:01] don't ask a heart thing but this will be
[1:49:04] given to you on one condition
[1:49:06] oh hallelujah if you see me go and but
[1:49:08] about him in that same quote
[1:49:10] said hallelujah the holy ghost is given
[1:49:12] to you on a condition as well
[1:49:14] come the church say amen oh hallelujah
[1:49:17] hallelujah
[1:49:18] so we're going through the scriptures
[1:49:20] the tsunami woman
[1:49:21] we went through the study of it she
[1:49:24] didn't have a child
[1:49:25] she was very careful and very hospitable
[1:49:28] to god's prophet
[1:49:29] and they wanted to do something for her
[1:49:30] and she ended up with a child and the
[1:49:32] child died
[1:49:33] and she's racing you remember it racing
[1:49:35] to meet elijah
[1:49:36] everybody ask her the question what's
[1:49:38] going to say all is well
[1:49:39] all is well i must go find a man of god
[1:49:42] that's what's in our heart
[1:49:43] everything will be well
[1:49:47] oh hallelujah by the way said brother
[1:49:50] that that
[1:49:50] elijah said here comes the son of man go
[1:49:52] and meet her
[1:49:54] she seems like she's in a rush go meet
[1:49:56] her and say unto her ask her this
[1:49:57] question
[1:49:58] is all well with you it's all well with
[1:50:00] your husband
[1:50:01] it's all well with the boy and as his
[1:50:03] servant ran and meet her
[1:50:04] and she said all is well her baby was
[1:50:07] dead her husband frantic but ibraheem
[1:50:09] said but all
[1:50:10] is well she knew god was in his servant
[1:50:12] the prophet
[1:50:13] she knew she could hear from god and she
[1:50:15] wanted to know
[1:50:16] this is the other verse the prophet says
[1:50:18] you wanted to know why
[1:50:20] her son had been taken
[1:50:23] and she runs up close elijah and he said
[1:50:26] her heart is full of gloom
[1:50:27] and god has hid it from me oh hallelujah
[1:50:30] but everyone said you know there's a
[1:50:31] wonderful thing
[1:50:32] god don't tell his prophets everything
[1:50:34] he just tell them what he needs them to
[1:50:36] know
[1:50:37] or what he wants them to know can the
[1:50:39] church say man but we know that she got
[1:50:41] her answer
[1:50:42] when elijah went back to the house oh
[1:50:44] hallelujah
[1:50:45] so we see true scripture questions
[1:50:48] answered
[1:50:48] and the question that were not answered
[1:50:50] they are moving on
[1:50:52] moving on until the right time until the
[1:50:54] right season
[1:50:55] oh brother branham speaks about the
[1:50:57] queen of sheba she said listen
[1:50:59] she heard something she wanted to know
[1:51:01] if it was true
[1:51:02] do you realize what that woman had to do
[1:51:04] the questions in her
[1:51:06] heart led her through the desert but
[1:51:08] abandoned
[1:51:09] he was probably at least three months in
[1:51:11] the desert a woman not with an air
[1:51:13] conditioned room
[1:51:14] but sitting on a camel do you realize
[1:51:16] what a sacrifice
[1:51:18] and tonight we could hear of god's gift
[1:51:20] and won't walk across the street
[1:51:22] no wonder she'll raise up and condemn
[1:51:25] this generation
[1:51:26] but she wanted to know it was worth more
[1:51:29] than life to her
[1:51:30] now whenever she took riches and gifts
[1:51:32] to give it was so
[1:51:34] now this woman settled with all these
[1:51:36] riches spices
[1:51:37] and talents of gold and everything to
[1:51:39] give it to the cause of god if it was so
[1:51:42] she didn't know it was so she had just
[1:51:44] heard hallelujah
[1:51:46] so she goes to the meeting to find out
[1:51:48] she came with a question
[1:51:50] is this thing real is the wisdom of
[1:51:52] solomon real
[1:51:55] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:51:59] amber brandon builds it i'm gonna skip
[1:52:01] this but she came to solomon
[1:52:03] she didn't come just to stay one night
[1:52:05] she was going to see the thing through
[1:52:07] that's the way to do it stay with it she
[1:52:09] was going to test it
[1:52:10] she was going to examine it so it
[1:52:13] finally come her turn
[1:52:14] and when she stood before solomon he
[1:52:17] revealed to her everything that was in
[1:52:19] her heart
[1:52:20] every question that she had in her heart
[1:52:23] she got the answers and and she didn't
[1:52:24] have to ask it it was revealed
[1:52:26] oh hallelujah he revealed to her
[1:52:30] everything that is in her heart how real
[1:52:32] god's gift up
[1:52:34] always works right solomon told her the
[1:52:36] things
[1:52:37] that were in her heart according to the
[1:52:40] bible
[1:52:40] told her every question that was in her
[1:52:43] heart god working through his gift
[1:52:45] and when the queen got ready to return
[1:52:48] what did she say
[1:52:49] when she gave all these gifts to solomon
[1:52:50] she said the things i heard about was
[1:52:52] right
[1:52:52] and even greater than i ever heard she
[1:52:55] said blessed be the god of solomon who
[1:52:57] has given all his wisdom
[1:52:59] and these things and jesus because she
[1:53:02] did that
[1:53:03] being a peasant and come and was
[1:53:05] reconciled to god
[1:53:07] by seeing the gift of god work perfectly
[1:53:09] became a believer in god jesus jesus
[1:53:12] said you bunch of educated church-going
[1:53:14] hypocrites
[1:53:15] he said she'll raise up in the day of
[1:53:17] judgment and condemn you
[1:53:19] because she come from the uttermost part
[1:53:21] of the known world at that time
[1:53:23] to see the wisdom of solomon and yet i
[1:53:26] say unto you
[1:53:27] that are greater than solomon is here
[1:53:29] and hallelujah
[1:53:32] [Applause]

[1:54:00] that's going to be answered
[1:54:08] hallelujah young people this is for you
[1:54:12] samson was asked a question
[1:54:16] samson samson what is your secret
[1:54:22] listen church you got to know what
[1:54:23] questions answer you know
[1:54:33] knowing the answer don't mean you have
[1:54:34] to give the answer
[1:54:39] there are some secrets you have to keep
[1:54:43] samson samson was his secret to your
[1:54:44] strength
[1:54:47] samson playing around he's playing
[1:54:49] around and some of us here were playing
[1:54:51] around
[1:54:52] playing around with the world samson
[1:54:54] knew better
[1:54:55] he knew the answer he knew what his
[1:54:57] secret was
[1:54:58] but he he was just slowly being broken
[1:55:01] down the question kept asking over and
[1:55:03] over what's his secret to your strength
[1:55:04] handsome he said he'd do this dude and
[1:55:06] it didn't work of course samson
[1:55:08] give me the truth
[1:55:11] you see samson was strong at first
[1:55:16] but the questions begin to increase and
[1:55:18] get more persuasive and
[1:55:20] samson you don't love me
[1:55:26] samson i told it to me okay why you
[1:55:29] wouldn't tell me the secret
[1:55:34] you want to make me cry
[1:55:42] until the strength that samson had was
[1:55:50] questions and answers and the wisdom to
[1:55:53] know the right question to understand
[1:55:55] the right answer and how to answer
[1:55:58] can the church say amen and we can go
[1:56:00] through scripture there's so much of
[1:56:01] this in the world there's so much
[1:56:03] in the message and then we meet someone
[1:56:05] like david
[1:56:09] and while david is walking towards the
[1:56:12] camp
[1:56:13] of the battle saul is also having his
[1:56:16] question
[1:56:17] in response to another question
[1:56:21] who will you send to fight me that's
[1:56:24] goliath's question
[1:56:26] soul question is who will i send
[1:56:32] david's question when he asked it was
[1:56:34] not about sending or going or coming
[1:56:36] his question was very simple who
[1:56:40] is uncircumcised philistine
[1:56:46] that dare defy the armies of the living
[1:56:48] god
[1:56:49] the focus of this question was in his
[1:56:52] name you know
[1:56:54] the who was tied to the uncircumcised
[1:56:56] philistine
[1:56:57] which meant according to the covenant
[1:56:59] our foot should be upon this
[1:57:01] [Music]
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:06] he wasn't asking this is like god asking
[1:57:08] adam where are you where where are those
[1:57:10] it's not your location it's not
[1:57:11] who i don't want his name i don't want
[1:57:13] his bird people i i'm not really
[1:57:15] interested in who he is as a name i know
[1:57:17] i don't know who is this uncircumcised
[1:57:18] philistine
[1:57:19] that dare defy the army of the living
[1:57:21] god come the church see amen
[1:57:25] and back sitting soul and backs it in
[1:57:27] israel they're curled up in the position
[1:57:29] and here it was david isn't asking about
[1:57:32] the strength
[1:57:33] and about the armor and about how long
[1:57:35] he's fighting and
[1:57:36] the experience that's not the important
[1:57:38] question you have to know what is the
[1:57:40] most important question
[1:57:41] the question was not about david's
[1:57:42] ability the question was not about
[1:57:44] about no it was who is the uncircumcised
[1:57:47] philistine
[1:57:48] because according to my bible hallelujah
[1:57:50] we are promised victory
[1:57:52] over every enemy we are promised victory
[1:57:55] over every philistine
[1:57:56] we are promised victory it didn't say
[1:57:59] large philistines small philistines it
[1:58:02] it didn't
[1:58:03] specify it says if they uncircumcised
[1:58:06] and if they are philistines
[1:58:07] they are moving target can the church
[1:58:10] say man
[1:58:11] anybody with me there were no conditions
[1:58:14] put on this thing there are no
[1:58:16] limitations put on this thing they
[1:58:18] didn't say these small philistines no
[1:58:20] no anybody who's a philistine
[1:58:22] uncircumcised too
[1:58:23] they are to be destroyed and we are more
[1:58:26] than able
[1:58:27] we are more than able can the church say
[1:58:30] amen
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:33] saul was so not convinced he said well
[1:58:36] if you're
[1:58:36] if you really want to go i can't even
[1:58:39] say are you sure that's a kind of
[1:58:41] leading question are you sure you want
[1:58:43] to go
[1:58:43] have big strong men here who don't want
[1:58:45] to go in are you sure that you want to
[1:58:47] go and deal with this goliath
[1:58:48] the men who fighting for a long time
[1:58:50] they don't want to go are you sure you
[1:58:51] want to go
[1:58:52] he said well if you want to go take my
[1:58:54] armor take my sword take my shield take
[1:58:56] everything i have
[1:58:57] and when david look at it he look at it
[1:58:59] he said my victory
[1:59:00] can't be based on this armor my victory
[1:59:03] is not based on this
[1:59:04] my victory is based on the fact that
[1:59:06] this uncircumcised philistine
[1:59:08] is challenging the armies of the living
[1:59:10] god
[1:59:11] [Applause]
[1:59:13] our victory is not titan but your
[1:59:15] strength your victory is not tied to
[1:59:17] your ability
[1:59:18] the battle is the lord's hallelujah
[1:59:21] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:59:25] he may be seated oh and so on so it
[1:59:29] unfolds
[1:59:30] questions and answers until we meet the
[1:59:32] new testament
[1:59:34] many questions in the old testament were
[1:59:36] answered but many were being transferred
[1:59:39] over
[1:59:39] into the new testament that were left
[1:59:42] unanswered
[1:59:43] that had to still be answered because
[1:59:45] we're going back to eden
[1:59:46] where there were no more questions but
[1:59:48] upon they had the questions have to get
[1:59:50] answered

[2:03:09] is that if you're here going to grow
[2:03:10] back it's always going to grow back
[2:03:12] the question is not if your limbs are
[2:03:14] going to be restored because the prophet
[2:03:16] said missing limbs
[2:03:17] will be restored the question is how the
[2:03:20] question is when

[2:03:40] revelation
[2:03:41] and it opened up to her that she had
[2:03:43] been chosen
[2:03:44] and she found out by the asking the
[2:03:47] right question
[2:03:48] how will this be when she heard the holy
[2:03:50] ghost she didn't wander
[2:03:52] she didn't doubt she went straight to
[2:03:54] elizabeth who was six months or so
[2:03:56] pregnant
[2:03:57] and at that point john had not been
[2:03:59] kicking in the belly just yet
[2:04:01] and when she relayed the testimony of
[2:04:04] the conversation
[2:04:05] and about the question and about the
[2:04:07] answer and what his name would be called
[2:04:10] when john heard it john start to have a
[2:04:12] revival

[2:04:47] nine years old
[2:04:49] went to the wilderness to be alone with
[2:04:51] god
[2:04:52] so he would not make a mistake i'm
[2:04:54] reading from the prophet
[2:04:55] he wanted to know this was his question
[2:04:58] he wanted to know what this messiah
[2:05:00] would be
[2:05:01] how he could find him what would he look
[2:05:04] like
[2:05:05] so that he could introduce him
[2:05:09] friends if there's a purpose for your
[2:05:10] life you must know the questions are
[2:05:12] tied to the purpose for your life
[2:05:17] you can't say i want to be an architect
[2:05:19] and don't ask the questions
[2:05:20] what does it take to be an architect
[2:05:25] you want to be a great accountant not
[2:05:27] just an accountant
[2:05:29] let me just make that clear to young
[2:05:31] people god doesn't accept just average
[2:05:33] in this kingdom so if you want to be
[2:05:36] anything you need to be a great one
[2:05:40] you give me the best but even i'm
[2:05:42] talking if you want to be a bum
[2:05:43] be the best bomb let them know look the
[2:05:45] best bum
[2:05:48] he said you finally filthy his garbage
[2:05:50] cans you're stuck and you're bringing
[2:05:51] all you got to come to your area
[2:05:53] let them respect your ability to show
[2:05:56] what a bomb is supposed to be like
[2:05:57] whatever you do you say listen you want
[2:05:59] to be a bum follow me i'll show you how
[2:06:00] to be a real bomb but if you want to be
[2:06:02] a great christian accountant
[2:06:04] lawyer architect secretary whatever it
[2:06:07] is
[2:06:07] then i'll show you to be a great
[2:06:08] christian one hallelujah
[2:06:13] so john wasn't trying to be average
[2:06:16] he wanted clarity he wanted questions
[2:06:20] answered so that when he meets the
[2:06:21] situation he could answer
[2:06:22] he could give an account he can respond
[2:06:27] so we find instead i'm reading from the
[2:06:29] prophet instead of going to take all of
[2:06:31] his degrees
[2:06:32] and come up as a priest as his father
[2:06:34] was and
[2:06:35] following the footsteps of his father he
[2:06:38] went as far away from the school as he
[2:06:40] could
[2:06:40] plumb out in the wilderness alone with
[2:06:42] god
[2:06:46] so that by the time john comes back out
[2:06:48] of the wilderness he's
[2:06:49] outcast he's an unknown nobody knows
[2:06:53] where he's been
[2:06:54] nobody knows his story nobody knows his
[2:06:56] experience backside of the desert time
[2:06:59] but when he comes out he's rebuking
[2:07:01] he's on fire he said there's one coming
[2:07:04] right now i baptized water
[2:07:05] but he will baptize with the holy ghost
[2:07:07] he had clarity
[2:07:13] when he saw jesus he said you should
[2:07:15] baptize me she said no no no no
[2:07:18] everything must be fulfilled but then we
[2:07:20] see john
[2:07:21] in prison
[2:07:26] john faithful disciples coming to him
[2:07:29] you say
[2:07:30] i hear a few things go go ask him
[2:07:35] i just have one more question go ask him
[2:07:38] are you the one
[2:07:40] or should we look for another
[2:07:43] and when they ask jesus the question
[2:07:45] jesus sent them back he said
[2:07:46] tell john give john this answer
[2:07:51] tell john that the sick are healed
[2:07:54] tell john that the blind received their
[2:07:57] sight
[2:07:58] tell john that the cripples are walking
[2:08:01] tell
[2:08:01] john that in 2021 the bride is in
[2:08:04] revival
[2:08:05] tell john hallelujah that they could be
[2:08:08] a pandemic
[2:08:09] but in the middle of the pandemic are
[2:08:11] greater than solomon is here
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:14] [Applause]
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:15] [Applause]
[2:08:17] come he gives a lot of shout out praise
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:25] you may be seated
[2:08:28] i'm trying to build a place i'm not
[2:08:30] going to be too much longer with you but
[2:08:31] just kind of eating good
[2:08:33] so jesus himself had to deal with his
[2:08:34] own questions
[2:08:36] if thou be
[2:08:40] turn this stone into bread it was the
[2:08:43] question that the devil asked that led
[2:08:45] to his answer
[2:08:48] but look how a master answers
[2:08:54] manchester united lived by red alone
[2:08:58] he gave him a real answer you know he
[2:09:00] gave my answer i was not answer this
[2:09:02] question
[2:09:05] he said go to court and he said man but
[2:09:06] every word i proceeded out to the amount
[2:09:07] of god
[2:09:11] and if you question the devil so if you
[2:09:12] want to learn how to answer questions
[2:09:13] just check jesus
[2:09:17] without the holy ghost without power he
[2:09:19] just answered the question and his
[2:09:21] answers
[2:09:21] but abandoned had so much power in it it
[2:09:24] was like electric
[2:09:24] vault city devil he never went away for
[2:09:26] a season just based on the right answer
[2:09:30] to the question
[2:09:33] so when the devil come at you with a
[2:09:34] question you could give the right answer
[2:09:37] and senator will fly in
[2:09:40] reversing faster than he drove
[2:09:45] he come driving at 60 reversing at 120
[2:09:50] because you gave her answer that you
[2:09:52] bought the ball your body sent you you
[2:09:54] return the ball
[2:09:55] you knock it straight out over you you
[2:09:57] hit it straight out
[2:10:00] can the church say amen
[2:10:03] oh hallelujah and jesus himself
[2:10:08] answered questions and he also asked
[2:10:12] questions
[2:10:15] the woman at the world bring me a drink
[2:10:20] go call your husband he's probing but
[2:10:24] random said
[2:10:25] it's an interesting kind of question
[2:10:27] he's probing
[2:10:29] and she says who are you talking to me
[2:10:31] because we saw marathons and we're not
[2:10:33] supposed to be talking he said if you
[2:10:34] knew
[2:10:35] who talking to you you'd ask me for a
[2:10:38] drink
[2:10:39] do you want to know who is he calling me
[2:10:42] say well
[2:10:43] you see i have not you say that's right
[2:10:44] because you you're you're you're you're
[2:10:46] you're you're with one and
[2:10:47] and and you had so many before and these
[2:10:49] things and what was it
[2:10:51] answered her question she'll have come
[2:10:53] see a man
[2:10:54] who told me all about me let's begin the
[2:10:58] whole and now i'm trying to bring this
[2:10:59] to
[2:10:59] a point matthew 16 two of the most
[2:11:03] critical scriptures
[2:11:05] questions who do men say that i am
[2:11:10] that's easier that's a a first level
[2:11:12] question
[2:11:14] because of the question that doesn't
[2:11:15] deal with you
[2:11:17] it's easy to speak about what other
[2:11:18] people say what do people believe
[2:11:21] well they believe they think they see
[2:11:25] and when jesus was satisfied with the
[2:11:27] answers and what he said he said who do
[2:11:29] you say i am
[2:11:31] he brought it personal to them and he
[2:11:34] realized that although they had been
[2:11:36] with him for a season
[2:11:37] didn't know who he was
[2:11:41] until god revealed to peter who he was
[2:11:44] and jesus could say flesh and blood and
[2:11:46] reveal this to you in other words
[2:11:47] the answer you have you didn't come up
[2:11:49] with that answer
[2:11:54] so it means that there could be ancestor
[2:11:56] situation that you didn't come up with
[2:12:01] anybody with me it's simple we know it
[2:12:04] so jesus was saying your answer to my
[2:12:06] question wasn't your answer
[2:12:09] you had some help
[2:12:12] hallelujah this was a son who gave an
[2:12:16] answer
[2:12:17] that he didn't know how to create the
[2:12:18] answer he had help
[2:12:21] he said flesh and blood and reveal this
[2:12:22] to you but my father give you the answer
[2:12:25] and that's the right answer and upon
[2:12:27] this rock
[2:12:28] of revelation of the ability of god to
[2:12:31] reveal to you how to respond to a
[2:12:33] situation
[2:12:34] i will build my church can the church
[2:12:38] say man
[2:12:39] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[2:12:41] against it
[2:12:43] i'm almost finished
[2:12:48] there's a young man he's in jesus
[2:12:50] meetings he's in the conventions he's
[2:12:53] maybe connected at a virtual convention
[2:12:56] something would have touched him enough
[2:12:58] to ask his own question
[2:13:01] found jesus when maybe nobody else was
[2:13:03] around
[2:13:06] he said master what luck are yet
[2:13:12] i've listened to all the preaching i've
[2:13:14] listened to all the services i've
[2:13:16] discussed with my friends and i've i
[2:13:18] realize i'm missing something
[2:13:20] but i don't know what it is
[2:13:26] what lacquer yet it's a burning question
[2:13:30] coming to church i know the message
[2:13:34] but i know i'm missing something
[2:13:40] jesus says obey the commandments
[2:13:43] follow the law he said from my youth
[2:13:45] i've done all of this
[2:13:46] that's not the issue
[2:13:51] i've been in church i've been in bible
[2:13:54] study
[2:13:55] i've been in prayer meetings i've done
[2:13:57] the things that everybody else does but
[2:13:59] there's still something that's missing
[2:14:01] and i
[2:14:01] don't know what it is help me
[2:14:05] help me help me
[2:14:08] help me is anybody who feels that way
[2:14:12] today you know you're missing something
[2:14:16] and you want jesus to give you the
[2:14:19] answer
[2:14:20] because he is the answer he has the
[2:14:24] answer
[2:14:29] and the fact that he was genuine
[2:14:32] and he pushed for more clarity jesus now
[2:14:36] was invited to
[2:14:37] discern fully said well
[2:14:41] go sell all that you have
[2:14:44] and give to the poor
[2:14:49] friends the issue here was no longer
[2:14:51] question and answer
[2:14:53] the issue was now what do you do when
[2:14:56] you do get the answer
[2:14:59] if there was one person on this earth
[2:15:01] who we know got an answer
[2:15:03] from the lord was this rich young ruler
[2:15:10] oh for god to tell me today what i need
[2:15:12] to do
[2:15:14] how sweet and precious would it be
[2:15:19] to have the opportunity
[2:15:23] and that young man the bible said he
[2:15:26] left sorrowful
[2:15:29] he left with the answer but with
[2:15:33] the answer there was a sorrow because he
[2:15:36] was unable to do
[2:15:38] what needed to be done when he got the
[2:15:41] answer
[2:15:43] i pray that today the answers that you
[2:15:47] are looking for
[2:15:48] from the word will come to you with such
[2:15:50] clarity
[2:15:51] and that you will have the fortitude and
[2:15:53] the strength and the courage to do
[2:15:55] what you need to do with the answer
[2:15:59] maybe like that rich young ruler you're
[2:16:01] not rich with wealth but you're
[2:16:02] rich with pride or rich with envy or
[2:16:05] you're rich with something else and and
[2:16:07] you're being told today
[2:16:09] get rid of it i pray that you don't walk
[2:16:12] away sorrowful from this service
[2:16:15] the bible said jesus loved him that that
[2:16:17] love went out because jesus saw the
[2:16:20] pain he was in with not being willing to
[2:16:22] give up
[2:16:25] what was affecting his life
[2:16:28] you can't tell me you don't know what's
[2:16:30] affecting your life
[2:16:33] not now not in this season when
[2:16:36] everything is made clear to us
[2:16:38] through scripture and through this
[2:16:39] message of malachi 4
[2:16:43] don't you leave sorrowful because you
[2:16:45] are unwilling to make the adjustments
[2:16:48] unwilling to make the changes unwilling
[2:16:50] to change your walk your talk your
[2:16:52] friends your network what what you do
[2:16:55] with your time and then you want to know
[2:16:56] why god is not
[2:16:58] helping you when god already told you
[2:17:00] what you need to do
[2:17:03] he did not like the answer so he walked
[2:17:07] away sorrowful
[2:17:17] jesus is tired
[2:17:20] he's wary but there's a need a situation
[2:17:24] we've preached about it
[2:17:26] on the other side
[2:17:31] the maniac of kadara the cries the
[2:17:35] questions in his life
[2:17:37] because although there were demonic
[2:17:38] influences on his life there was still a
[2:17:40] cry
[2:17:41] that reached god and touched jesus to
[2:17:43] intervene on his behalf
[2:17:45] and while jesus was on a mission to
[2:17:47] cross to the other side his disciples
[2:17:49] would have had questions no doubt
[2:17:50] because they were not allowed to go to
[2:17:52] the other side but jesus was maybe he
[2:17:54] was just too tired to ask or maybe they
[2:17:56] just
[2:17:57] were shy to even ask the question how
[2:18:00] could he go to the other side
[2:18:02] but while he is going the devil raises
[2:18:03] up a storm to attack
[2:18:07] and we know the story jesus wakes up
[2:18:09] rebukes the storm and goes back to sleep
[2:18:12] and the disciples asked their own
[2:18:13] question they had seen a lot but they
[2:18:16] now ask a new question
[2:18:18] what manner of man is this
[2:18:24] and we preach about it but at that point
[2:18:26] in time they didn't get
[2:18:28] the answer it was still unfolding to
[2:18:32] them
[2:18:33] because they didn't fully understand his
[2:18:35] mission his purpose his objective
[2:18:37] what he was there to achieve hallelujah
[2:18:40] and brother brahman
[2:18:41] says we would see jesus he said they
[2:18:43] said what manner of man is this
[2:18:46] wonderful amen wonderful don't you
[2:18:47] believe he was wonderful
[2:18:49] when that man himself listen to the
[2:18:51] prophet describe this when that man
[2:18:53] himself
[2:18:54] left the heavens when the entire solar
[2:18:56] system was his crown
[2:19:00] every billion stars that hung in the
[2:19:02] earth every star
[2:19:03] that millions of miles beyond when they
[2:19:06] looked through that glass out yonder
[2:19:07] at mount paloma and could see 120
[2:19:11] million
[2:19:11] years of light space and all those
[2:19:14] billions and trillions of stars was in
[2:19:16] his crown
[2:19:19] and he left them to take a crown of
[2:19:21] thorns who would do it wonderful
[2:19:25] this is the easter eternal was his robe
[2:19:29] he was robbed with eternal life he never
[2:19:32] had a beginning
[2:19:33] he never started at bethlehem you know
[2:19:36] as people tried to think he did
[2:19:37] he had no beginning amen robed
[2:19:40] with eternal life and pushed it aside
[2:19:43] to take an old dirty robe of death for
[2:19:46] you and i heaven
[2:19:48] was his palace all heaven belonged to
[2:19:51] him
[2:19:51] that was his palace nothing could ever
[2:19:54] shine with him he came to the earth and
[2:19:58] even said the foxes have holes
[2:20:00] and the birds have nests but i don't
[2:20:03] even have a place to lay my head
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:08] that's the jesus you must see that's the
[2:20:11] jesus
[2:20:11] that you must see not the jesus of the
[2:20:14] nomination they talk about
[2:20:16] not the jesus of creeds not the jesus of
[2:20:19] some sort of
[2:20:20] mythical christmas not the jesus of some
[2:20:23] bunny rabbit easter
[2:20:24] but the jesus of calvary the jesus who
[2:20:27] laid aside
[2:20:28] everything
[2:20:36] [Music]
[2:20:41] hallelujah hallelujah trying to
[2:20:44] bring her close to this
[2:20:49] we're almost done so we talked about
[2:20:52] questions throughout the old testament
[2:20:54] many answered some unanswered being
[2:20:56] carried forward as it were
[2:20:58] to now come together when jesus is on
[2:21:01] the earth
[2:21:02] and even when jesus is on the earth he
[2:21:05] would ask
[2:21:06] over 300 questions
[2:21:09] in matthew mark luke and john over 300
[2:21:12] someone said about 239 or so questions
[2:21:16] i have to go try to check it but over
[2:21:18] 300 questions
[2:21:23] i'll just touch a few matthew 5 46
[2:21:26] for if you love them which love you what
[2:21:28] reward have you
[2:21:31] do not even the public comes the same in
[2:21:34] other words you need to be better than
[2:21:35] this if you loving people who love you
[2:21:38] what what reward you get there's no
[2:21:39] reward for that
[2:21:41] matthew 5 47 if you salute your brethren
[2:21:44] only what do you more than others
[2:21:49] that's two out of over 300 questions
[2:21:51] jesus asked
[2:21:53] and remember you could ask a question to
[2:21:54] encourage inspired a guy to teach to
[2:21:59] matthew 6 27 which of you by taking
[2:22:02] thought can add one cubit under his
[2:22:04] statue
[2:22:06] matthew 7 3 we forget some of these
[2:22:09] questions
[2:22:10] and why be wholeness though the mote
[2:22:13] that is in thy
[2:22:14] brother's eye but consider us not the
[2:22:17] beam
[2:22:18] that is in thine own eye let us go back
[2:22:20] to the
[2:22:21] questions that jesus asked we wouldn't
[2:22:24] have time in this service to ask them
[2:22:26] all
[2:22:27] but make it your personal study to
[2:22:29] understand the kind of questions jesus
[2:22:31] would ask
[2:22:32] to bring his disciples into the soldiers
[2:22:34] he shaped them to be
[2:22:38] when they brought the man with palsy
[2:22:41] jesus the bible said in matthew 9
[2:22:43] 4 and jesus knowing their thoughts said
[2:22:46] wherefore thinking
[2:22:47] evil in your hearts
[2:22:50] i just heal the man but you're thinking
[2:22:52] evil i discern it why
[2:22:53] why why why would you think evil when
[2:22:56] good is being done
[2:22:58] why can't you be happy that god is
[2:23:00] blessing somebody
[2:23:01] why can't you be happy for somebody
[2:23:05] else
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:10] jesus using questions to teach to rebuke
[2:23:14] the guy to mentor to shape the mold
[2:23:18] matthew 11 7 speaking about john
[2:23:22] as they departed jesus began to say unto
[2:23:24] the multitudes concerning john
[2:23:26] what went you out in the wilderness to
[2:23:28] see
[2:23:29] a reed shaken with the wind just to see
[2:23:31] something going on is that
[2:23:32] yeah you're attracted by fireworks
[2:23:36] what what went you out to see a man
[2:23:38] clothed in soft raiment
[2:23:40] behold they that wear soft clothings are
[2:23:42] in king's houses
[2:23:44] but what went you out for to see a
[2:23:46] prophet yeah
[2:23:47] i see unto you and more than a prophet
[2:23:51] can you take a little more
[2:23:54] john 3 12. now this is not a preacher's
[2:23:56] questions
[2:23:58] this is jesus asking questions
[2:24:01] jesus said in john 3 12 if i have told
[2:24:04] you
[2:24:04] earthly things and he believed not
[2:24:07] how shall he believe if i tell you of
[2:24:09] heavenly things
[2:24:13] i'm almost done matthew 20 32
[2:24:17] and jesus stood still and called him and
[2:24:19] said what will he

[2:24:59] people sit in the message and forget
[2:25:01] these questions
[2:25:03] that jesus asked that he that he
[2:25:05] requires us to answer
[2:25:09] these are questions we must all answer
[2:25:12] what shall it profit a man if he shall
[2:25:15] gain the whole world
[2:25:16] and lose his own soul

[2:25:46] and see jesus walk into calvary with
[2:25:49] every step that jesus took towards
[2:25:51] calvary
[2:25:52] questions that had remained unanswered
[2:25:54] for centuries
[2:25:56] were merely now hours away from being
[2:25:58] answered
[2:26:01] questions about the perfect sacrifice
[2:26:03] were hours away from being answered
[2:26:06] questions about redemption were hours
[2:26:08] away
[2:26:09] from being answered questions about the
[2:26:12] way back to eden
[2:26:13] were hours away from being answered
[2:26:16] question about being able to have a city
[2:26:18] who we could where we could go were
[2:26:20] hours away from being
[2:26:22] answered hallelujah
[2:26:26] paul would say in the book of hebrews
[2:26:28] and we know it
[2:26:29] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:26:31] lord but this
[2:26:32] man hallelujah this is hebrews 10 verse
[2:26:36] 12 but this man
[2:26:38] after he had offered one sacrifice
[2:26:41] four sins sat down on the right hand of
[2:26:44] god
[2:26:45] oh hallelujah from henceforth expecting
[2:26:48] till his
[2:26:48] enemies be made his footstool
[2:26:52] for by one offering he had perfected
[2:26:54] forever
[2:26:55] them that are sanctified in other words
[2:26:58] when jesus came and
[2:26:59] he died and he rose again in that one
[2:27:02] experience he was answering all
[2:27:05] unanswered questions
[2:27:07] about the sacrifice about sin about
[2:27:10] getting back to eden
[2:27:15] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:27:23] [Music]
[2:27:24] oh blessed be the name of the lord i'll
[2:27:27] skip a few things
[2:27:29] hallelujah and when jesus died
[2:27:32] we know he went down to hell reading of
[2:27:34] the lost
[2:27:35] and questioned they had they in paradise
[2:27:37] but abraham preached it out
[2:27:39] the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[2:27:42] ezekiel wonder what that
[2:27:43] what that was and he said when he saw
[2:27:45] jesus say but wait a minute that's
[2:27:46] that's the answer
[2:27:47] that's the wheel in the middle of the
[2:27:49] wheel oh hallelujah
[2:27:51] oh this they were getting all of the
[2:27:52] answers that weren't answered throughout
[2:27:54] all the ages can the church say amen
[2:28:00] i'm almost finished
[2:28:05] and on the day of pentecost we're moving
[2:28:08] beyond now
[2:28:10] peter was speaking and peter
[2:28:13] speaking led to a question in acts
[2:28:16] 2 verse 37 says no when they heard this
[2:28:20] this is where peter was preaching and by
[2:28:22] actually he said when they heard this
[2:28:24] they were pricked in their heart and
[2:28:27] said unto peter unto the rest of the
[2:28:28] apostles
[2:28:29] men and bridging what shall we do in
[2:28:32] other words the word being preached to
[2:28:34] you
[2:28:34] should bring a different question a new
[2:28:37] question because they were clear
[2:28:38] and there was a way out but they want to
[2:28:40] know what do i need to do what shall we
[2:28:42] do
[2:28:43] then peter said unto them repent and be
[2:28:45] baptized every one of you
[2:28:46] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:28:48] remission of your sins and you
[2:28:49] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[2:28:52] and by the random goal he said paul paul
[2:28:55] being a teacher
[2:28:56] we just go in trump getting rid of the
[2:28:57] clothes coming on the road to damascus
[2:29:00] there was a great light shining out of
[2:29:01] heaven
[2:29:02] hallelujah and the voice spoke saul saul
[2:29:05] why persecutions down me
[2:29:07] hallelujah and saul said who who are you
[2:29:10] that i'm persecuting he said i'm jesus
[2:29:13] hallelujah and we go on and on and on
[2:29:15] and we see the romans where we read
[2:29:18] these rhetorical questions that paul by
[2:29:21] the time he's writing
[2:29:22] he is writing questions that he's also
[2:29:24] answering that we know the answer to
[2:29:26] he said what shall we then say to these
[2:29:28] things
[2:29:29] in other words we don't even need to
[2:29:30] answer you know because if god before us
[2:29:33] who could be against us he that spared
[2:29:35] not his own son
[2:29:37] but he livered him up for us all how
[2:29:39] shall he
[2:29:40] not with him also freely give us all
[2:29:43] things
[2:29:43] so that's why i picked for and a subject
[2:29:46] what shall we say
[2:29:47] to these things all these things that
[2:29:49] are happening around us what shall we
[2:29:51] say
[2:29:51] this bride will have a voice the sons of
[2:29:55] god
[2:29:55] will have a voice the sons of god will
[2:29:58] speak
[2:29:58] and when they speak it'll flash like
[2:30:00] lightning when they speak they will push
[2:30:02] back to heaven
[2:30:03] when they speak they will push back
[2:30:05] diseases can the church say amen
[2:30:07] give the lord a shout of praise
[2:30:09] [Applause]
[2:30:16] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my
[2:30:20] my mind oh my
[2:30:24] and from the message this is my last
[2:30:26] quotes here from the message christ
[2:30:28] is the mystery of god revealed
[2:30:30] hallelujah
[2:30:32] hallelujah then we can see that the
[2:30:35] marriage supper is at hand
[2:30:36] and now if i never see you again
[2:30:39] hallelujah we don't know if this is the
[2:30:40] last convention but if i never see you
[2:30:42] again
[2:30:42] remember the marriage supper is at hand
[2:30:45] and then the kingdom
[2:30:46] according to the promise is ready to be
[2:30:48] issued in
[2:30:49] the great millennium the taken up of the
[2:30:52] church
[2:30:52] and the destroying of the wicked and the
[2:30:55] world under the sixth seal
[2:30:56] to be purified by volcanic to take all
[2:31:00] the corruption
[2:31:01] and sin of the world and to mold her out
[2:31:03] again and bring forth a bright new
[2:31:05] millennium for the age that is succumbed
[2:31:07] when we see all these great threefold
[2:31:10] revelation
[2:31:11] listen here now god in christ christ in
[2:31:14] the church
[2:31:15] and the kingdom coming listen adam and
[2:31:18] eve redeem back to the garden of eden
[2:31:21] in the representation of christ and his
[2:31:23] bride then the kingdom is going to be
[2:31:26] restored
[2:31:26] according to his promise so in other
[2:31:28] words what is about to happen now
[2:31:30] had to really wait brother heathcliff
[2:31:32] until all these forces are in their
[2:31:34] place
[2:31:34] the world is in their place the world
[2:31:36] churches are in their place
[2:31:38] the economy is in their place sin is in
[2:31:40] its place
[2:31:41] and now when all these things are in
[2:31:42] their place the bride is coming into her
[2:31:44] place
[2:31:45] sons of god are getting into their place
[2:31:48] the whole creation groaning
[2:31:50] for the manifestation of these sons of
[2:31:52] god then the kingdom is going to be
[2:31:54] restored praise be to god now
[2:31:56] listen to this by the revelation of the
[2:31:58] threefold mystery
[2:31:59] the secret and by the personal
[2:32:02] vindicated word
[2:32:03] by his original headship not say well
[2:32:06] glory to god we shout hallelujah we sing
[2:32:09] that's that ain't it i'm a missionary
[2:32:12] i've been seven times practically over
[2:32:15] the world see
[2:32:16] i've seen heathens devils and everything
[2:32:18] else dance and shout
[2:32:20] i've seen all kinds of fleshly
[2:32:22] manifestation that's carnal so whatever
[2:32:25] said that's not what i'm talking about
[2:32:27] this is what i'm talking about he said
[2:32:29] but i'm talking about the headship of
[2:32:31] christ
[2:32:32] hallelujah notice being personally
[2:32:35] identified by the original hanship
[2:32:38] so he says when that happens in other
[2:32:40] words we have the answer
[2:32:42] to the devil's questions hallelujah we
[2:32:45] have the answer
[2:32:46] to the devil's question he christ is
[2:32:48] risen
[2:32:49] and has paid the price the devil can't
[2:32:51] stand it
[2:32:52] that's the reason these economical
[2:32:54] kingdoms are setting up
[2:32:55] that's the reason they're coming into
[2:32:57] what they're doing now the devil that's
[2:32:59] the reason he's howling the way he is
[2:33:01] his scheme has been uncovered by the
[2:33:04] risen
[2:33:05] resurrected christ in the headship over
[2:33:08] his body
[2:33:08] so in other words his scheme has been
[2:33:10] uncovered and the headship
[2:33:12] the headstone the head of the church the
[2:33:15] head of the body
[2:33:16] is united with the body hallelujah but
[2:33:18] it by himself you think i'm beside
[2:33:20] myself i'm not
[2:33:21] we have got the devil's answer
[2:33:23] hallelujah
[2:33:24] not me that live it but this easter the
[2:33:27] word living
[2:33:28] in me it's not my idea it's his power
[2:33:31] not my idea it's his word he promised it
[2:33:35] here it is he said it would be here and
[2:33:38] here it is
[2:33:38] we got his answer christ is risen this
[2:33:42] convention this easter christ is risen
[2:33:45] and has paid a price for our redemption
[2:33:48] what god in christ manifested
[2:33:50] he gave that flesh that and blood that
[2:33:53] in the blood might come to life
[2:33:55] and the flesh be redeemed that god in
[2:33:58] his redeemed flesh
[2:33:59] could manifest his word for the day
[2:34:02] hallelujah
[2:34:03] oh hallelujah
[2:34:07] i'm done almost finished then we stand
[2:34:10] justified
[2:34:11] in the presence of god as a drop of ink
[2:34:14] dropping into a tub of bleach you will
[2:34:17] never find a stain of the ink no more
[2:34:19] hallelujah it went somewhere it'll never
[2:34:22] come back again
[2:34:23] and when man is truly redeemed that
[2:34:26] predestinated sea that sees it
[2:34:28] and accepts it his sins are demolished
[2:34:31] it's gone it's separated in this
[2:34:34] convention
[2:34:35] it's dropped into the ink of the blood
[2:34:38] of jesus christ
[2:34:39] and it's never to be remembered no more
[2:34:42] memory no more sin your past finished
[2:34:46] your failures finished
[2:34:48] [Music]
[2:34:50] brother branham said god forgets it he
[2:34:53] stands as a son
[2:34:54] and daughter of god in the presence of
[2:34:56] god now

[2:35:26] church

[2:35:37] earth and the questions
[2:35:38] that he left unanswered he left it for
[2:35:40] his bride
[2:35:41] he left it for his sons he left it for
[2:35:44] the manifestation
[2:35:45] of the sons of god to bring back a
[2:35:47] complete restoration
[2:35:49] of eden jesus left a portion of his
