grace and i'm blessed to have you all here and um tonight i want to give my title first and a title that i have is faithful and little faithful and much productivity a biblical perspective so the night we want to sort of talk about productivity um or being fruitful about how god sees this thing called productivity and um so you want to get straight into it i don't want to say i won't be alone but is a a small lesson tonight and let's begin from the very beginning god created man to be productive by giving this command in genesis 1 28. this is the scripture here now and god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the ear and over every living thing that move it upon the earth so god never intended man to be in a static position a position controlled by the environment like we might say this happened to me that is external it's because of this one that is why again external we miss it is not what happened to us it is our always our response to what's happened to us let me say it again it's not what happened to us it's our response to what happened to us as you hear that i'm taught that god doesn't condemn the sinner for being a sinner because the condemnation comes from not wanting to get out of the sin because sinner sins that's what the sinner does so that static position that we find ourselves sometimes in is not really ordained of god god wants us to be and and this was the word he gave to adam in genesis was to subdue and it would subdue the calm pacified soothe and have dominion which is to reign over dominate or to make it your territory to have dominion over so it is as if man was supposed to be in a position that the not the external control him but he actually dominate the external environment and circumstance today productivity is measured or defined by getting the life you want be unsuccessful to fulfill your dreams but it's in god's picture it's a little different it's not about you it's not about fulfilling your dreams and ambitions and so on like that but i'm seeing it as if god we listen listen closely we are god deposit on the earth or his investment on the good and he's looking for a return on his investment how we would see that by the text that we're going to reach the text we want to get to we need to be good stewards that stewardess custodian guardian keeper stewards of our time our gifts and talents life is too short to waste redeem the time bring glory to god note the emphasis bring glory to god by restructuring your life our lives in doing good and in serving others that would repeat it i'll say this way you can bring glory to god by restructuring your life in doing good and serving others the hebrews 10 24 shares with us and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works that would provoke is to incite aggravate to arouse is not a deadness the voc is not well you know i see it no it's taken sign it's the aggravate it's the arouse question how do you allocate your time question how do you use your gifts and talents what you do now and how you do it now does it bring honor and glory to god so when we speak about productivity we're not talking about professional and business folks we are talking about christians believers in all walks of life you eat a housewife a janitor a gardener a business owner owner because jesus give himself for us that we can become productive maybe you never appeared like that way before but listen to titus and this is titus chapter 2 verse 11 to 15 and it reads for the grace of god if you want you could find this titus 2 verse 11 to 15 don't read it i'll read it first in the uh king james and then i'll go the amplified for the grace of god it bring it salvation had appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and of our savior jesus christ who give himself for us here we go that he might redeem us from all iniquity so let's go again who give himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity one and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good words these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee and we want to read that in the amplified uh i read from the team awaiting and looking for the fulfillment the realization of our blessed hope even the glorious appearing of our great god and savior christ jesus the messiah the anointed one who gave himself on our behalf that he might redeem us purchase our freedom from all iniquity and purify for himself a people to be peculiar his own people who are eager and enthusiastic about living a life that is good and filled with beneficial deeds so i want you to notice tonight that jesus said die for us to just leave here he died that we can be witnesses on this earth by living such a life that that glorifies him that's the object of this whole redemption and pain the blood price that we could hear you know and it always touches me uh when i hear jesus words i come that you might have life and have it more abundantly in other words he didn't come for us to exist he didn't come very hanging in there no he said come that you might have life and have it more abundantly that's why i appreciate the exhortation from the prophet sunday do not be worried do not be fearful but you want to put your feet and trust in the lord amen praise the lord now he said enough if i tell all these things urge advice encourage warn and rebuke with full authority let no man did not let no one despise or disregard or think little of you conduct yourself on your teaching so as to command respect now so the next scripture is what i want to call a key soon keystone scripture in regards to being productive it is like an anchor point this scripture which is matthew 5 16. and this is jesus speaker and this confronts all of us all of us listen to jesus one word in matthew 5 16 and i wish had pen and paper and you could write on the scriptures i guess maybe you'll put it out on on whatsapp that you could look back at the scriptures we we have here but jesus said here let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven emphasis so shine not light shine but let your light so shine before men now they may see one your good works not bad works not crazy books you have good works and glorify your father which is them in the amplified it says let your light so shine before men that they may see your moral excellence and your praiseworthy noble and good deeds and recognize and honor and praise and glorify your father who's in heaven so shine so shine that your good deeds would bring honor and praise and glorify your father so by doing good to others you are actually bringing glory to him we still ain't get all our substances text us yet but we we're gonna get there or we you're here praise god i hope you are blessed tonight and you are uh working with us tonight and going with us tonight and we want to turn into a bible so this is our main text tonight and it's just going to be read on sunday matthew 25 who's 14 to 30 second revival i like to turn to that by matthew 25 verse 14 to 30 and you know what is interesting is that this was right after a parable of the 10 virgins jesus gave this parable right after the ten veterans he presented this now remember with the virgins um there was wise and foolish he identified them as good people nice people sanctified people one person want to get the oil the other just the oil ran out it's not that they didn't have oil what they had actually ran out the prophet used these words they they missed the wisdom of revelation to catch the open door to receive the holy ghost that knowledge information but miss your revelation to touch the open door okay let's go this is our substantive text tonight from matthew 25 reading from verse 14 to 30. jesus speaking isn't read for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and onto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several abilities straight we took his journey then he that received five talents went and traded with the same and made them an other five dollars likewise he doesn't receive two you also gain other two he that received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lord's money after a long time the lord of those servants comment and recommend with them so right here in verse 19 is where you see there will come an accountant for the gifts here we go talent that you have been given i think that would repeat it there will come a time of recognition of what you have done with your time with your gifts with your talents who's twenty so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord dog delivers unto me five talents behold i have gained besides them five talents more so this was presentation time this was a time when he could present the point and say here what lord you give me five i have another fight to show you what i have done with what you give me verse 22. he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliver us unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents besides them his lord censored him well done or i skipped something okay i did yeah from five his lord senator tim bishop is 21 sorry well done though good and faithful servant dao has been faithful over a few things i will make the ruler over many things now this is very powerful and as i announced my title faithfulness it feels much now it's impressive the analysis that is presented here in what was done this man and his own accord his master didn't tell him do it he didn't write a memo a note a letter on his own accord he took the five talents invested it traded it and got another five and the lord pronounced one you have been faithful over a few i will make you a ruler over many enter into the joy of the lord verse 22 he also that received returns came and said lord thou deliver us unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents besides them his lord said unto him well done but unfaithful servant has been faithful over a few things i will make the ruler over many things enter into the joy of the lord that he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee the doubt a hard man reaping where dog has not sown and gathering the dog was not stored so maybe this guy wasn't even minding his own business he was 25 but i was afraid and i went so he's in his emotions and went and hid that talent in the low dear dog that is done his lord answered and said unto him what you deserve and though wicked and slugful civil don't know us that i reap where i swore and gathered where i have not struggled though orders therefore to have put my money to the exchanges and then at my coming so watch how jesus freezed it at my comment i should have received my own with usury and not using his interests take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which had ten times for unto everyone that had shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that had not shall be taken away even that which he had and cast ye the unprofitable servant into all the darkness there shall be weapon and nash of teeth so friends this is serious all of us had been given time gifts and talents that were repeated all of us have been given time gifts and talents gifts and calling are without repentance you're born with it god has gifted you god has blessed you and is your choice to waste it lose it use it surrender it to him all of that is your choice he is not forcing anyone the bible plainly states there between a bed one taking one life there has to be something about that one being thing it has to be something about why that other one was left i think where isaac can we keep speaking about it about being prepared now all what we are talking about has nothing to do with going to church this have to do with what is expected of you as a christian as a believer as a housewife as a father as a as a brother so let your light shine that men may see your good works because we're not supposed to have bad works because we come out of that to be coming to christ that men may see of good works and glorify the father heaven note what he says you because you are facing little things and you know how the human being is we have ambition we want big things and we want big things no big things fast big things immediately and when we get the little things we mess up and if you cannot manage you cannot account you cannot handle the little that god gives you how could you be given much it can't work it does not work it cannot work it's impossible for it and that is why you know i remember something i remember my wife had a testimony concerning this message when she had received the message she liked you know covering your knees and not cutting your hair and the life around the message was what was attractive to her and she had a battle to come to church and she had 55 brothers and my mother just passed the radio and and she has a battle to come to service with a whole battle and my mother's done it before she got a tissue after cook so she has to wash brother's clothes without any reward and she did all of that and she was telling me uh you know years later about what it taught her because she wanted to come to church she had to cook and that's how she ended up learning to cook because you want to go to church nothing must stop us if this is oh i get a church i'm going to cook before i go to i'm going to cook she has to wash the clothes without reward and you know what she said she learned she learned to work hard now what if she was laid back what if she was lazy what if she was full she may not have met me this is my point whatever was in her pushing her to get to service to get to the lord and so on is because god was rearranging things and and sometimes that's why i think i said it sunday when you work harder than you're getting paid eventually you'll get more p than you're working for you see so so people shun work they shun the the backbone of things but you see she was preparing for future life you see because there's work to be done and if you cannot handle the task presented to you in a small form how you'll handle it how big a stuff there so that is why you see little shops remain little shops for years and that is why we see people that are not changing because they have the same thoughts the same friends the same circle and there is nothing new coming within their zone so they think the same way speak the same way live the same way act the same way and go to church and they remain as they are and age so they're not really growing they're getting old to grow is not to get old let me say that many times to grow is to listen let me repeat that to grow is not to get old they are all people that has not grown our inch they just get old in their ways all in their thinking all in their behavior and attitude what the ghost become is to bring about change as we say pain could come to your life and it could be just be that pain oh gosh it's not working out for me this door closed and i'm based on this but pain come also to change people and it's how you interpret what comes your way are you going to change or are you just going to stay in your pain nobody know the trouble i see yeah the way in trouble you see sometimes you get in your own truck but the point about is this is if you are learning from what you are going through if you are learning from the challenges that is before i remember one time in my job uh working in school and they bought a new machine and was you know a long time duplicator big machines and then papers and stuff and i said to myself oh it's not my business it's not my job secretary will do all these printing and stuff and i tell myself you know what i am not going to learn how to use that machine because they're going to put a set of work on me the print and to do this and do that and then when i thought about that and i retake it i say but but if i don't learn it i'll be ignorant of how to use it so you know what i want to live that was my choice now i could have docket and say well so anybody come and say could you do that i don't know i i don't know how to use the machine yeah that's the easy way out but there'll be a dance i wouldn't know how to use the machine i wanted to know how to use the machine it doesn't matter who want help or who want to print paper you have to want to learn to want to change there are too many people satisfied with themselves they're satisfied with how they are they have no ambition they have no drive they have nothing to spill them on and i hope that you see what god sees when go tell adam be fruitful and not decline adam feeding lead not to multiply near feeling left to be fruitful i don't find the garden so nice he could just relax itself and eat upland grapes no there's a commission behind everything there's our order behind everything amen so i hope you love them tonight and you love the word tonight and let's continue listen to this scripture in luke 16 2011 this is jesus speaking again and he said these words he that is faithful luke 16 10 he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much he that is unjust in the least is also unjust in the much so then little literating comes say it after me little thing comes literal things come and sometimes you hear me preach on it talk about it sometimes god give us an instruction to test our response if we will obey maybe it is too simple maybe we expect something complex just like the leper uh who was told to go and wash in the jordan and dip seven times and he was angry he's a leper he he is given a solution uh when he when he do realize he have to dip but could you send me to the beach could you send me to an island pool could you commit a blue caribbean waters why jordan what kind of what is that here what kind of medication it have there anybody know what's in that water is it still h2o but that gave to a plus the question wasn't the water the question was obedient eventually he got the result when he obeyed so that's what i'm saying little things are important you know when you're off target somebody if you're supposed to go north east and you find yourself some other way some other channel the longer you stay in that position is the further away you get from your target that's why the target has to be the word the target has to be god it has to be christ it has to be what god promised you that has to be the target and if god wants us to be productive as christians as fathers as mothers as believers we have to re-examine our lives and ourselves as to why is it roughness laziness tiredness tiredness what is it that is hindering us from becoming at our best man at his best paul expressed himself about he that striving for the mastery is temperate in all things and as we spoke about those virtues and i realized every one of them is a powerhouse every one of them conquering something every one of them overcoming something the impatience overcoming impatience temperance temperance overcoming penalty intemperate behavior and so on every one of them is a powerhouse that we need they need these things to stand to overcome let's continue you know i could see why it's paul very simple man don't want to let him eat like very christian behavior don't let them eat because they don't want to work they're lazy but they want food food that they're not working hard for for very table a lot of people you know they find itself in that way they they don't want to go there learning the street that kind of behavior all right so i want to identify what god is expecting of us now in the amplified okay okay right okay this here is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in march and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much then he continued if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammal who will commit to your trust the true riches this is jesus now hear this in the angry side he who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little thing is dishonest and unjust also in much beautiful if you have not been faithful in the case of unrighteous mammal which is deceitful riches money and possession who will entrust you with true witches so we come back to what i recall a work ethic one attitude it come like if you are working for someone some business somewhere and you are half-hearted and you're putting in halfway supposed to put in on your attitude sloppy and lazy and whatnot how could you get your own business and be hard-working that's impossible because you see taught come words words become actions actions become habits habit becomes a life so if you are sloppy on the job and you continue to be sloppy and you can't even stand out you can't even be like a joseph he does so well you get promotion if you get your own you will be sloppy it wouldn't work for you because you don't have to discipline you don't have the muscles like you say you want a gym and if you lifting up weights that is just light you have no muscles to get in that's not how you work in the gym as you lift off well i'm not a gym person i just tell you what i know okay if you live up 10 pounds and it's training afterwards you need 11 pounds you need 12 you need 14 you need 16 you need 20. and that's train and stretch and stream and stretch this is what get muscles but if you just want to break a sweat you could use the same thing same with and just you know keep doing like that and so on you can because if you want to get muscles you need to exercise and you need to add weight upon that and if you want your feet muscles to to build because some people just slim you know they have no faith muscles they just it's just going through but if you want fat muscles to bring the trials and intestines and the exercise of fate is what gives those muscles strength and as the winds blow you manage it better every time so afterwards it doesn't matter as bahram says uh you meet the devil media challenge anywhere anytime any place under any condition because that is what you have now feet muscles do you have that tonight trust that you do if you're not given again okay let's continue i want to read secondary tree but it means amplified so you have to find it i want to read it and i think it's almost present tense right now um and what is happening in the world today um we would see it but understand this in the last days will come a set in perilous times of great stress and trouble hard to deal with and hard to bear four people will be lovers of self and utterly self-centered lovers of money and aroused by inordinate greedy desire for wealth proud and arrogant contemptuous posters they will be abusive blasphemous coffin disobedient to parents ungrateful unholy and profane they will be without natural human affection callous and human relentless admitting of no truth or appeasement in other words these people don't want to peace at all they're like whoa they like they like it like that they will be slanderers false accusers troublemakers in temporary loose immorals and conduct uncontrolled and fierce haters of good they will be treacherous betrayers rash inflated with self-conceit they will be lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of god for although they hold a form of piety through religion and the bible in the kingdom say having a form of godliness they deny and reject and as strangers to the power of it their conduct the lies the genuineness of their profession avoid all such people turn away from them for among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly and weakness and spiritually dwarf women spiritually dwarfed women loaded down with the burden of their sins and easily sweet and led away by various evil desires and seductive memphis these weak women would listen to anybody who will teach them they are forever inquiring and getting information anna but are never able to arrive at a recognition of the knowledge of the truth so the thing about the scripture here identifying not sinners outside this is church folks this is church members this is people who believe they say they believe the bible is the scripture but their belief and life not in harmony it's not measured sometimes wonder people want to be christians that's a beautiful song we sing sometime lord i want to be a christian in my heart you have to want to be a christian you see you are you and you know you you're living with you paul said that to me life he said uh for me to die is gain and people don't want to die you know and i want to say die i'm talking about debtor's self-doubt get to your own will your own desires why why should i just walk out for you the bible teach you about setbacks through what i said mark jobe is an example of having a setback it's not that you was a sinner in job was antichrist and joke misbehaving and do having adultery and fitting and smoking no he was he was fine but life dealt him a hand that set him back with his family with his health and everything else people could muck and laugh at him but at the end of it all listen god god glory could we give the lord a hand the praise hallelujah at the end of it at the end of what he has been through god glory now you know after time the plain fear truly is level um your ute is no longer there your hair is no longer black it's grain um face is no longer smooth it have wrinkles and and things on it and we all head in the same direction that's our attitude shall return you know just as david told solomon i go to the way of all flesh save the lord he exhort his son but david knew his time was getting near david was the same one that said lord help me to number my days to know and i have wisdom out of or to behave myself how to conduct myself you only have one life to live and you only have one time to be mortal and this is where we are do your best become the best this is what this is about you know you not staying as you but you becoming the best version of you the version that god wants of you gideon didn't know he was better than that we wanted to exhort him and say mighty man of honor in other words you and your mind battle and fight did i not be with you that i see no i'm seeing a leader in you i'm seeing you leading an army i'm seeing your leadership i see you conquering the midianites and so i see you doing all of that lord i'm the biggest i'm the least but yes that's how you see you i don't know i'm seeing you how do we get you to see what god sees are you because this is what the gospel is about this is what the revelation is all about i am not god i am not the holy ghost the holy ghost is the revealer to reveal you who you are now when you get capped listen carefully when you get that cut by your environment kept by your friends crap by what grandfather see and grandmother say and this one's here just go up to you and the second workout when you get kept by all these voices you kept your own self when you shake those things off and you come to us but wait a minute you mean i'm a believer right and all things are possible to them i believe right these signs are falling then i believe right all of a sudden you begin to uncap you begin to disconnect from all the negative and you recognize listen i reacted this way i was immature i reacted that way because i wasn't i didn't have the temperance i needed to have i was too impatient that's why i moved the way i did i thought i was going to woke up because in my and i went with my mind and it didn't work out because it was in my mind it wasn't the minor god did you seek the mind as well you did not you went about it your own way and then it unfold the way it unfolded you are here because of how your life and your choices that you make but the thing about it is the first day of the rest of your life is the first day that you can look and say you know wait a minute my whole life could turn around tonight the light could be my break tonight because as a man thinking his heart sounds he if if you know he's a biblical be transformed by the renewal of your mind could you see yourself pressing forward could you see yourself overcoming the things that keep you down could you see yourself raise up above where you are yes you can you have to see it you have to see it you must just refuse perilous times shall come stressful times are here what is amazing to me 99.9 percent of the world is under the same condition corona virus socialism the government saying this vaccine thing mandate no mandate people protesting whatever all of that the whole world in turmoil you can be like them all there not when god brings us here the lottery shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do this is supposed to happen but we're supposed to hold steady we're supposed to be pressing on so let your light shine oh praise the lord let's continue now we read this before after a long time the lord of the servants commit and reconnect with them and this scripture here matthew 25 19 is a scripture that gives evidence that we all have to account for the time i'll put this with time talent and gifts that god has given us and this time talent and gifts i see it as if we are like an investment to go on you you yourself you your second investment are you bearing your talent are you wasting your time are you misplacing your gifts is god gonna get interest from your life oh you're going to come to god and say lord this is what you give me i come back with it 20 years ago i discovered you and did you see me that's why peter said add to your feed virtue productivity don't stop there and divert your knowledge productivity don't stop me and the knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and the patience guardians the godliness bodily kindness alberta's charity don't ever get tired of hearing that because this is being when it's completed is the sermon of god issues of god going to rapture this is raptor material this is what the big magnet coming to magnetize not so much not who is the pastor what church you go to it's what's inside of you you hear me say the rapture is inside out not outside him the change of the body is only because there's a power on the inside the power the inside will affect what on the outside this is what this rapture is all about the big magnet of the holy watch which is the capsule coming to connect with the power that's already inside it the reason jesus could say destroy this body in two days i'll raise it up is because there was something resident in him with a time on it that that sets off an alarm before three days so jesus knew according to the scriptures he have the right it have no ifs it has no buts so he could declare destroyed his body into his eye myself would raise it up again and he did prove it he was not only mechanics word flesh but he was also a dynamic spirit car was resident in him so when time came his body was quickened and he rose from the dead so there was prophecies of our lives and we have to connect with those prophecies that we could see this day this scripture is fulfilled in my life for my house for my home for my family let's see if we could get that stretch you know now this scripture here i am i just fell in love with it it's from titus chapter 3 14. and i it's a powerful scripture i don't think we ever use that scripture before but i feel in the context of what we're doing tonight it's a key scripture titus 3 14 says and let always also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful oh it sounds kind of strange but let's read the amplifier of that and let our own people really learn to apply themselves to good deeds to honest labor and honorable employment so that they may be able to meet necessary demands whenever the occasion may require and not be living idle and uncultivated and unfruitful lives oh that's a beauty i think i want to read it again me and perfect titus 3 14. something to meditate on let our own people really learn to apply themselves to good deeds now doing good deeds is not automatic thinking people is not born with a gift of doing good dj people do good deeds to themselves on a selfish level they're doing for them they're doing their family they're doing it for their loved ones but doing good deeds to others you have to apply yourself to that you have to want to do that you have to choose to do that some people do good deeds to get back goods guys business that is trading that is a different kind of good deeds thing i am talking about good deeds and you expect nothing in return it's a choice of your action it's a choice of your decision that you do that and when you do that you reap the benefit of that so let me read it again and let our own people really learn to apply themselves to good deeds and listen to honest labor and honorable employment so that they may be able to meet necessary demands whenever the occasion may require and not be living idle and uncultivated unfruitful lives praise god and you know the bible talk about stop fullness and we spoke about peter says given all diligence and that diligence is thoroughness persistence attentiveness you know there are some people overlook so many different things they just take general but giving out diligence means you are focused now you know what i want to pay attention to this i think this is very important i can't afford to miss it proverbs 6 6 says go to the adult slugger consider ways and be wise and the prophet and the bible the second corinthians 9 6 says but this i say he that sweats sparingly shall also be sparingly without sweat bountifully shall reap also bountifully the amplified of that says remember he who sows tyranny and grudgingly and also leaves tyranny and grudgingly he will sues generously that blessing may come to someone will also reap generously the blessing do you ever help someone and realize it happened yourself remember years ago early christian experience i was under some real pressure and i was thinking about backsliding and i met a brother who was senior to me and he was standing with the lord and he telling me he going on backslide i said what so go on but i said i testified to him and talked to me would when i finished with him i was so charged he taught her backside in the left and i learned something from that when you give truly you get i was seeing how could you even think about backsiding brother and he was an older brother loneliness long sleeving alone and whatnot and it was something else to me that still be up so much but i he told the backside so friends begin to testify begin to give your testimony begin to share about what god has done for you how god spoke to your life how god came into your life begin to share it with somebody somebody need to hear and be encouraged with your own testimony okay praise the lord eclair says 11 6 in the morning should i seed and in the evening with whole nothing hand for thou know is not where they shall prosper either this or that or whether they vote shall i like be good what does that teach us don't hold back you put all that you're supposed to do you're so old some people sow two seasons and and two might be bad seeds when you saw a hundred seeds if they have 50 or very bad they are 50 coming good because you put the labor your soul sparingly you reap spiritually you're so bountiful you read bountifully put your hands in the dirt put your hands to libra labor in prayer labor in faith labor and study put your hands to it and then and only but there is reward ephesians 5 the scripture we read verse 15 see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is but i never read it in the amplified which i'll read now look carefully then how you walk live purposefully and worthily and accurately not as unwise and witness but as wise sensible intelligent people making the very most of the time buying up each opportunity because the days are evil therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the lord is hallelujah thank you lord give the lord some praise and here we go now the only way we stretch here to the backbone of what we are sharing tonight which is from colossians chapter 3 verse 23-24 and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the lord but not unto men now this is a little different from what you may get in productivity books or people talk about productivity nobody will ever talk that only the scripture could define it that way that what we do we do it as unto the lord not as under man and to me what that bring is a consciousness that the eyes of god is on you not so much money the boss may not see you rationally work the boss may not see you on the cotton or whatever it is but god sees so when you have a consciousness that the eyes of god is upon you not just job-wise but life-wise be wise it changes the picture of how you walk how you talk who you live how you behave yourself so this is a powerful scripture are we going to get it to the amplified will shine more light in it he said whatever you do how to do it you're doing you could do it grudgingly you could do it unwillingly you can do it and your next action to do it or you could do it heartily ask to the lord not unto men verse 24 knowing that of the lord you shall receive the reward of inheritance for you serve the lord jesus christ and the amplified states here now whatever may be your task look at it heartily from the soul as something done for the lord and not from men knowing with all certainty that is from the lord and not from men that you will receive inheritance which is your real reward the one whom you are actually serving is the lord christ the messiah and i found this beautiful psalm psalms 101 and that psalm should be our testimony our our witness this should be our psalm psalms 101 and you can find it and maybe if you find it we could read it together psalms 101 and it just ate verses i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i sing i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way oh when will dog come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart i will set no wicked thing before my eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cling to me a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked person who so privily slandered his neighbor him will i cut off that hat and hi look and a proud heart will i will not i suffer mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall save me he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that tell it lies shall not tarry in my sight i will only destroy the wicked of the land that i may cut off all the wicked doors from the city of the road may god bless this world and this is brother branham he's speaking here but i hope i got better hopes of you brethren here this morning that you'll be men of god who stay with the word of god and let everything else fall right to left but still right with that word don't move no matter if you're a doormat out there be a good doorman don't try to compete with someone else to do this just get right in the wood and stay right there i hear this and god will positionally place you into his kingdom where you can be the best oh this is good give god some praise for this and this is there's a little too much here right now you see where god gonna place you you do you see where go gonna place you god will place you into his kingdom where you can be the best what if my finger were taking a notion because it was not i it wouldn't be a finger anymore i would hate to lose that finger do my eye may be more valuable but i love that finger it's part of me you understand what i mean i'm sure you do so whatever office whatever it might be whatever you are and where god has positionally placed you stay there and be as loyal to that word as you know how to be god will bless it if he takes a notion for something else he replaces you where he needs you just be what you are god wants you the way he made you and just keep that in mind if it's a doormat i want to be the best doormat he ever had if i have to be a doormat whatever it is in the house of god let me serve my office the best that i can for him now jesus said they'll come to pass they will kill you thinking they're doing god's service you remember that jesus said that through the same spirit predicted it against in the end time it's got to come if these others hit perfectly with the scripture watch and see if it doesn't coincide exactly with the scripture god said it would happen here and it did happen then we are going to do then what we are going to do let me get down to laodicea again oh praise god i'm going to close oh blessed be the name of the lord but i am speaking about saint martin here you say one of his first miracles he was a soldier to begin with i believe then one day he was coming by a man lying cold and shivering all the people not willing was not able to help the man just pass him by the priests the levites did in the good samaritan when said martin came by realizing his duty as a christian believer he had one coat cloak over his shoulders he cut it and told his sword and gave half of it to the beggar he took the other half and and that night began his career for jesus christ appeared him in a vision wrapped in the same robe that he cut half into which fulfilled the scripture in so much as you have done these you have done it unto me i wonder if god take that scripture and bring it to us how we how will we feel how would he examine us based upon how we treat each other how we treat one another how we treat the church members how we church church people how we handle other ministers or the believers other churches hope as you have done it into the release of this one you have done under me in other words you treat somebody evil you treat christ's ego you treat somebody bad you are actively treated in christ bad as you have done unto the release of this little one you've done it on me but we have to come back to this now this is the bible we are reading the bible this is what the prophet was saying to open up this very scripture this is the absolute this is the word of god let's continue so so now he said so let's take that for a lesson whatever you do to somebody you're doing it to christ nobody said let's say that together and brother branham and the congregation speak a new nation and he make them say this and you could sit with me what or you see after me what you do to others you say what you do to others you have done to christ you have done to christ so no matter what he thinks about you listen it is what you think about him see that brings the blessing that was his first miracle and the beginning of his ministry and there's another one and he was praying and why is congress was waiting for what's important and there was a beggar come to the door knock at the door and he opened the door and he was busy and he told him he wanted a garment he was naked had nothing he was cold he sent him to see the chief deacon and the chief deacon was irritable with him and ran him out and when he did he run around he come back again and told saint martin that the deaton had run him out as i run out and so then after that time the chief didn't come back in and told him kind of sharply your congregation is waiting on you you keep them waiting but he was in prayer it is better that he stayed in prayer till he feels like of god to go up and this beggar came back to the door and said martin took of his own garment good garment and give it to the beggar and the chief deacon to go and get another one and bring it to him so he had to get a garment any of putin on saint martin and he wore the lesser garment out before the people instead of the good girl you see it goes to show give the best what you have give your life give your time give everything to christ and that same spirit that lived in christ lives in you and your influence in your neighborhood and upon the people that you deal with will be so much like christ children work the same thing christ did so finally it come to pass that the people lived in the shadows and was healed that's right there's so much power of love around them and they said when sin martin was preaching after he come out with the lesser road on the entire corrugation notice a glow of light all around him see because he's done the right thing always do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and you've got to come out right that's right you have to and the final scripture tonight are we going to close and this scripture i believe caps it off in truth of what god sees as productivity and this scripture is a familiar scripture it's in john 15 1-8 i am the true mind my father is a husker every branch in me the beard not fruity take it away that is plain that is the knife that is no if and bought and maybe every branch in me that bear it not fruit he take it away and every branch that beared fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit so now just by verse 2 you recognize god is interested in foodbearing he is not interested in no fruit he want fruit and if he sees fruit you're going to purge it to get more fruit now this tree now you are clean to the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot be a fruit of itself except it's abide in the vine no more can he except you abide in me i am divine you are the branches either abide in me and i and him the same bring it fought much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit socially by disciples so we went from fruit more fruit much fruit god is interested in food bearing not so much the talk but bearing fruit ask god that you'll be a fruit bear bearing fruit and that takes us to psalms 1. i've been thinking about that hope sometime i'll preach about samsung blessed is the man who will walk not in the counsel of him godly walking away of sinners who sit in the seat of his cornfield but as a light is in the law of the lord and in that lord that he meditated day and night he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of what oh my whatever you shall trust hallelujah praise god it's not just the trees where he's planted may the lord bless you i trust tonight that this taught you in a special way in a special way that when abraham offered isaac and the altar and god said hold your hand stay your hand i know you fear me and blessing and complicity and multiplying and multiply d and thai seizure you never yet go talk about subtraction and division and so on always addition multiplication this is the god reserve he put a seed and that seed would bring forth after its kind in in multiply form he put you on the earth as an investment what will be his returns let us bow our heads almighty god there are so much aspects of this term productivity there are so much aspects of faithful and literal faithful and much lord are you know i just crashed the surface of it tonight i know that others may do much better in presenting this topic and presenting this bible study and have this bible class but i pray god that it will be enough for these people guided here and those who would listen to be stood in spirit and ask themselves in introspection what am i doing how am i doing it how am i i like talling up to this thing we don't want to be found on that scale when the pronouncement comes we hear you're found in a balance raising the balance and from wanting god we want that skill to truly balance balance with the word and spirit balance with what you require of us and lord you will never lose your slutful the bible said in the seventh day you rested you rested after your work after your labor you labor let there be let there be every day first day secondly today and after the work on labor you rested because you saw it was good you please man in the garden of eden and you were comfortable knowing that he was in position to take control have dominion and subdue father here we are in this 20 or a century father god and here we are father god with all this

never feared with the love of god sweep into every heart here tonight god especially the weak ones the struggling ones remember our young people remember the sick law those are hell in need of
