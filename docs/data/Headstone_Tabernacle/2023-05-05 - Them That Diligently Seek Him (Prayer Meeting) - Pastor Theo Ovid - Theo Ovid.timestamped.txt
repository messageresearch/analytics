[10:27] email anymore God bless you and welcome
[10:30] and it's a blessing to have all of you
[10:31] here tonight
[10:32] and there's something upon my heart I'd
[10:34] like to share before the government
[10:36] prayer and um it's I want to open my
[10:39] bible to Hebrews chapter 11. I want to
[10:42] read verse one to six
[10:43] you appreciate your service on Wednesday
[10:45] night the god of testimony appreciate
[10:48] that for Anthony to your testimony God
[10:50] get glory to your testimony goal
[10:52] expresses himself you have to have a
[10:54] testimony The Voice
[10:57] so Hebrews chapter 11.
[10:59] the reason from verse one
[11:01] now Faith is a substance of things will
[11:03] form evidence of Things Not Seen
[11:06] before
[11:08] through faith we understand that the
[11:10] world's refrained by the word of God so
[11:12] that things which are seen
[11:15] are not made of things we should work
[11:16] with you
[11:17] by faith evil offered unto God a more
[11:21] excellent sacrifice than King
[11:23] which he obtained witnessed and he was
[11:25] righteous God testify other skills the
[11:30] diet he being dead yet speaking by faith
[11:33] Enoch was translated that he should not
[11:35] see that was not formed because God had
[11:38] translated
[11:39] before before his translation he had
[11:43] this
[11:44] testimony
[11:46] that he pleased God
[11:48] are without faith it's impossible to
[11:50] please him
[11:51] for he that coming to God must believe
[11:53] that he is one two he is rewarder of
[11:57] them that division please seek him
[11:59] and that is where I want to take a
[12:01] thought tonight them that brilliantly
[12:03] Seeker
[12:04] God bless you amen now
[12:09] it is not a man to seek the Lord
[12:12] just want to get up straight off
[12:15] it is not something that we wake up and
[12:18] want to seek the Lord is not a man to
[12:21] seek the Lord Jeremiah 79 and brother
[12:23] Isaac but he quoted it the heart is
[12:25] deceitful above all
[12:28] right
[12:31] the God knows the heart
[12:33] born in censorship iniquity whether you
[12:35] are seed or whatever but the condition
[12:38] that we are in the Bible said is
[12:40] non-righteous
[12:41] Mark 7
[12:43] a couple of scriptures read and just to
[12:45] bring all this point tonight Mark 7
[12:49] verse 5 says then the Pharisees inscribe
[12:52] African why
[12:54] what not that disciples according to the
[12:56] tradition of the elders
[12:58] but he's bread with unwashing handles
[13:01] he answers to them well
[13:04] you Hypocrites has written the people
[13:07] honored me with their lips but the heart
[13:10] is far from me but for example
[13:13] spoken about this
[13:16] be very respond to God
[13:19] albeit in vain do they worship me
[13:24] teaching for Doctrine
[13:26] the Commandments of men
[13:28] ify the Commandment of God he holded the
[13:31] tradition of men as of Washington
[13:33] up some many other so Jesus identifying
[13:37] the external things that they're trying
[13:38] to see what why those guys not doing
[13:41] like what we do
[13:42] he said well full well you reject the
[13:45] Commandment of God that he may keep your
[13:47] own tradition
[13:48] for movies
[13:52] he said no okay
[13:54] Silver City making the word of God of
[13:56] non-effectual your tradition which you
[13:58] have delivered and many such like things
[14:01] you do and when you call all the people
[14:03] under him he said happen unto me every
[14:05] one of you and understand
[14:09] there is nothing from without a man
[14:13] that entering into him can Define him
[14:17] but the things which come out of him
[14:21] those are thee that defile the man If
[14:25] any man out there stay here
[14:28] and walk away
[14:34] I didn't know so Jesus just give them
[14:36] that new explanation
[14:37] verse 17 and when he was entered into
[14:40] the house from the people
[14:42] his disciples asked him considering the
[14:46] parable he says
[14:51] will you not perceive that the whatever
[14:53] things from without anything to the man
[14:56] it cannot Define
[14:58] because it entered not in his heart but
[15:01] into his belly and going out to the
[15:03] drought put in all meat he said that
[15:06] which comes out of the man
[15:08] that be found
[15:10] so from within out of the heart of men
[15:14] to see the inventors adulteries
[15:17] fornications murders thefts
[15:19] Consciousness wickedness deceit
[15:23] lasciviousness and evil eye blasphemy
[15:26] Pride foolishness all these evil things
[15:32] 65
[15:34] now listen to this verse 21 and so on in
[15:38] the amplifier for from within that is
[15:40] out of the hearts of men on base and
[15:43] Wicked on sexual immorality stealing
[15:47] Buddha adultery competence
[15:53] dangerous and destructive wickedness
[15:56] deceit
[15:58] unrestrained in decent conduct an evil
[16:02] eye Envy slander Eva speaking malicious
[16:06] misrepresentation abusiveness Pride the
[16:11] sin of an uplifted heart against God and
[16:13] man
[16:14] foolishness fully lack of sense
[16:17] recklessness recklessness and
[16:19] thoughtless
[16:20] all these evil purposes and desires come
[16:24] from within and they make the man
[16:26] unclean and rendered him
[16:30] so then you see clearly
[16:32] that external performance and
[16:36] Impressions whether long dress or
[16:38] straight time
[16:40] and jacket doesn't impress God
[16:43] what God really want to see is what's in
[16:46] that huh
[16:48] today is non-naturalistic after God
[16:51] must believe he is and he's reward of
[16:54] them that them that are hoping that we
[16:56] all hear Englishman tonight will be part
[16:59] of this damn that
[17:00] diligently seeking
[17:02] Romans 3
[17:05] the Lord speaks
[17:07] in verse 10.
[17:09] others is written there is non-righteous
[17:13] you see them there is none that
[17:15] understand that
[17:16] there is none
[17:18] that seek it after God
[17:21] they are all gone out of the way they
[17:23] are all together become unprofitable
[17:25] there is none that could do not
[17:28] the truth is
[17:31] it oh it's not us
[17:33] under their lips so therefore from man
[17:37] to be in a position
[17:39] who even have a desire or to seek after
[17:42] God something have to happen within the
[17:46] heart of man to give him that desire
[17:48] no wonder he offered a new heart
[17:50] the new spirit
[17:54] no we
[17:56] this old man seek after things
[17:59] we seek success we seek film we seek
[18:02] Fortune we speak respects we seek
[18:05] happiness we seek fulfillment we seek
[18:07] after World Pleasures we seek the best
[18:09] for our family but we don't seek him
[18:14] or seek after him
[18:16] now seek is an active woman
[18:19] I like that song that by Anthony sang
[18:22] take up your cross and follow Jesus
[18:24] now what it is today in religion or
[18:27] religious people just go to church
[18:30] they go decision here
[18:32] trying to leave they're going to say
[18:34] something by going to the church to give
[18:36] them an entitlement to this thing called
[18:39] The Kingdom or this thing called the
[18:41] program of God or whatever
[18:43] but that is not what that song strikes
[18:45] take up your cross and follow you have
[18:48] something to do would you take up the
[18:49] cross and the next thing you have to
[18:52] follow it across
[18:53] so therefore
[18:55] we the seek
[18:58] and the dictionary say is the attempt to
[19:00] find something
[19:02] attempt or desire to obtain or achieve
[19:05] something or ask for something from
[19:08] someone
[19:09] seek him is not passive
[19:12] seek him
[19:14] is active
[19:15] and you hear it in those words that we
[19:19] are echoing from verse 6 of Hebrews 11
[19:21] he said coming to God must believe that
[19:25] he is
[19:27] and he is a rewarder of them that
[19:31] diligently or enthusiastically
[19:34] or excitedly
[19:38] watch this I'm Luke chapter 19. verse 8.
[19:43] and Zacchaeus stood and said unto the
[19:45] Lord be who Lord
[19:47] the half of my goods I give to the poor
[19:50] and if I have taken anything from any
[19:52] man by false application I restored
[19:54] forth
[19:56] Jesus said unto him
[19:58] this deed is salvation come to this
[20:01] house
[20:02] for so much as he also is a son of
[20:05] Abraham
[20:06] Christian
[20:08] for a son of man
[20:10] is come to seek
[20:12] and deceased that which was lost
[20:19] for succumbed to seek
[20:21] to deceive that which was lost
[20:24] so the truth is
[20:26] it is God who have been seeking us
[20:30] I want you to think about that tonight I
[20:31] don't think that it seems that we know
[20:34] but because whether or not this register
[20:36] is not you seeking a new after oh
[20:39] God is the one that have been seeking
[20:42] after us Ezekiel 34 12.
[20:46] it says
[20:48] as a Shepherd seek it out his flop
[20:51] in the day that he is Among Us
[20:54] so I support my sheep
[21:01] so I will seek out my sheep I will
[21:04] deliver them out of all places where
[21:07] they have been scattered in the cloud
[21:10] you got me
[21:12] so God is seeking
[21:14] at least one of us to seek after him
[21:18] why do we need to seek the Lord
[21:20] I remember I'm not talking about going
[21:23] to church I'm in a message we're not
[21:25] talking about talk we're talking about
[21:27] this scripture here
[21:30] this week he said give me a box of it
[21:34] give me a family give me a preacher
[21:38] whatever any man that will put God first
[21:42] I will show you some body that is
[21:44] successful despite what everybody could
[21:47] do
[21:49] why do we need to seek the Lord Crosby
[21:51] backslide
[21:52] we sin ful
[21:56] we get cool
[22:00] let me read something for you but I'm
[22:01] talking about the question and answers
[22:02] there's some questions you feel
[22:05] the third of January 1954.
[22:08] I don't know on blackstriden he said
[22:11] somebody said but saying that you were
[22:13] baptized in Christian baptism at the age
[22:15] of 13. if you have a Christian Life all
[22:17] the way along if you backstabbed a few
[22:19] times I don't know
[22:21] is on the backside I wish somebody would
[22:24] would ask me that but on Friday remember
[22:27] your backslide every day there's no way
[22:30] at all for you to keep hold of it all
[22:32] right but you backside to the people in
[22:34] the church but not before God see you
[22:37] backslide on Christ but not don't thank
[22:39] God cause if you sin you're gone but
[22:42] you're constantly Fallen Paul had to die
[22:45] every day is that right you have to die
[22:47] every day repent every day and just
[22:50] constantly repented all the time and if
[22:53] Paul had to do that then I'm going to
[22:55] have to do it
[23:03] February 9th uh 19.
[23:07] environment is lukewarm condition died
[23:09] in the United States now here comes
[23:12] jehuram and just like him apart is
[23:15] jerusal Father righteous man and fire
[23:17] for God growing up with his lukewarm man
[23:22] listen this one it's a problem a
[23:25] lukewarm believer
[23:26] is worse than an infidel
[23:30] ity
[23:41] but you see these things I'm reading you
[23:43] know I wonder they really believe that
[23:45] because if they really believe that you
[23:46] are concentrate that you can't stay in
[23:48] this dead
[23:50] natural you can't stay there
[23:53] you have to say Lord I am in your
[23:55] apartment tonight you can't even wait
[23:58] for something you you can't even wait
[23:59] for that you need that tonight so
[24:02] therefore you should be encouraged to
[24:04] truly seek after the Lord let me read
[24:06] that again like something good to read
[24:08] he says a lukewarm believer
[24:13] is worse than an infidel
[24:16] God
[24:18] glory in the dead but every man will
[24:22] either be a Christian or a sinner and
[24:24] stay the same
[24:26] he said every one of you know someday
[24:28] you'll be calling a pile of bones laying
[24:30] underneath somebody's clear around here
[24:32] just as sure as you are sitting here
[24:34] tonight
[24:35] you're heading towards that houses here
[24:38] should you be there you know what I mean
[24:40] maybe you might start in an hour from
[24:43] now this time next year there may not
[24:45] even be a piece of Flesh on your bones
[24:46] in the next 12 months they may even not
[24:48] be a speck of life in your body in the
[24:50] next 25 minutes and then from that time
[24:52] till endless ages cease to be will never
[24:55] be the state you are in now that state
[24:57] will be forever
[24:58] tonight
[25:03] and those that were here right the
[25:05] church on Sunday if you are lukewarm
[25:07] brother that is dangerous please for you
[25:10] to start it's a lukewarm condition
[25:12] Jesus said either you be hot or cold
[25:15] either we meet with me before me with
[25:18] all your heart will be against me if you
[25:20] just live a pretty good life that will
[25:22] never count put in political life
[25:26] your self-righteous rugs will never
[25:29] stand in the day of judgment that's
[25:32] right okay so let's continue Psalms 105
[25:36] so it's for said seek the Lord
[25:45] no no
[25:47] seek the Lord oh nicely pasta no he
[25:50] didn't feel that here seek the Lord I
[25:51] saw them in the street no no seek the
[25:54] Lord and his strength seek his faith
[25:56] come on Psalms 24 6 this is the
[26:00] generation of them that seek him that
[26:03] seek thy face o Jacob seller to seek the
[26:06] Lord is the seek his presence this thief
[26:10] Seekers protection
[26:11] seek his kingdom seek His blessings seek
[26:15] his forgiveness seek is Mercy seek is
[26:19] wisdom
[26:20] is wisdom yes
[26:22] do we need it yes James 1 5 says if any
[26:25] of you lack wisdom let the marks I'll go
[26:27] give it all men liberally and read it
[26:30] not and it shall be given him wisdom is
[26:33] something we need is our wisdom with our
[26:34] wives our family our business our
[26:37] neighbors this is cool
[26:39] Proverbs 13 3 happy is the man that
[26:41] finds wisdom
[26:45] reverse four five get wisdom
[26:47] that understanding forget it not for the
[26:51] decline from the goods
[26:54] we need wisdom to know when to stand and
[26:57] when to run some people foolishly just
[26:59] stand up when they're supposed to run
[27:01] you know when they run Joseph when
[27:03] potipheral rice make his a move he ran
[27:06] he gets out of that scenario sometimes
[27:09] that is wisdom to know when to run when
[27:11] to start psalms 27 1 the Lord is my
[27:15] light and my salvation who shall I fail
[27:18] the Lord is the strength of my life
[27:22] it's seven yeah oh Lord when I cry with

[27:32] are really home this time seeking my
[27:34] face my heart is
[27:37] are you saying that tonight
[27:39] or is it just the words you just get an
[27:41] exhortation and you know about all which
[27:43] are speaking some words or this is going
[27:46] to be real to you when those fear this
[27:48] is the sound is David in Psalms 27 verse
[27:50] 8 when though see us seek ye by Feast
[27:54] like heart said unto thee thy face Lord
[27:57] blessing
[27:58] you know some people are talking about
[27:59] you wake up and alone as if they are in
[28:02] the passive and they expect God to
[28:03] predict active and they're waiting for
[28:05] God to make a move if you're looking for
[28:07] a sign and you're looking for a signal
[28:09] you're looking for a rainbow you can
[28:10] find light you're looking if I miss
[28:12] looking for some kind of thing somebody
[28:13] to call you tell you whatever it is and
[28:15] he said
[28:19] you
[28:22] six
[28:23] 31 says therefore do not worry and be
[28:26] accessing what are we going to eat what
[28:29] are we going to have to drink or what
[28:31] are we going to wear for the Gentiles
[28:33] the heathens wish for and seek those
[28:37] things honestly I'm obviously Amplified
[28:39] I was a publication but seek in
[28:43] our life after first of all his kingdom
[28:46] this is the Amplified and his
[28:47] righteousness his way of doing and being
[28:50] right and then all these things taken
[28:53] together will begin to you besides do
[28:55] not worry
[28:56] or be anxious about tomorrow
[28:59] more worries and exactly of his own
[29:01] sufficient but each day wow
[29:06] and that's it I'm almost done here now
[29:08] can we come back to the the oriented we
[29:10] read foreign
[29:22] testimony
[29:28] she said beloved
[29:31] she know how she lives and how what she
[29:33] reflected and everything else
[29:35] and she is so thirsty forgotten now
[29:38] that she doesn't care what anybody think
[29:40] what anybody see
[29:42] personally
[29:47] because you see people talk about this
[29:49] one talking about me and I've seen it so
[29:51] I feel so
[29:52] forget it
[29:54] that person in a condition in a
[29:57] condition when you just still think
[29:58] about what others think
[30:02] because this sister she says
[30:05] she says that I'm so tasty all I want is
[30:09] water I brought around first I talk
[30:12] about this man was fruit tasty I want
[30:14] water and they keep postponing the
[30:16] postpone it and one time when he saw
[30:18] some water in some green or something
[30:20] like that he just drop off the car and
[30:22] run and drink the water he was so
[30:24] painful just to me is when you
[30:27] alligators pack the tooth for life
[30:30] you begin to act you don't care what the
[30:33] neighbors say what people say or do
[30:35] about your sin and how you fell and how
[30:37] you're feeling all your fault that
[30:39] becoming relevant doesn't matter
[30:40] doesn't matter if you want to do well
[30:42] she
[30:43] uh her life was just me and that way
[30:46] anybody could know about her life of
[30:47] course when Jesus freed her she could
[30:49] run with that Liberty and say come see
[30:51] him I'm gonna close
[30:54] no
[30:58] he didn't commit to God
[31:00] he'd pick up his cross follow us
[31:03] and this ties in with Jesus said
[31:07] the gospel is preached since that time
[31:10] and and the customers preach and every
[31:12] man pressed their way
[31:13] into the kingdom of God you don't hear
[31:15] much about that you get people going to
[31:17] church and he passes a nice man and he
[31:18] has Christmas trees and Revelation stuff
[31:20] but the reality is is a kingdom that you
[31:24] have to enter it
[31:29] it's a place to get to Abraham his whole
[31:34] effort and testimony was seeking a city
[31:37] who's making the less God he wasn't
[31:38] saying well you know what bless me
[31:39] recall me elected
[31:46] quarter note
[31:48] out of his coming

[32:00] in one of God of things that he moved
[32:03] here prepared and out he didn't say Noah
[32:06] make a nice wooden new bench and he
[32:09] sucked uncomfortable to hear God's voice
[32:10] as I said already all the Hallelujah
[32:13] glory and you shout and dance and think
[32:15] that when you sweep your house that
[32:17] wouldn't take your bills in other words
[32:18] you still have to go to work you still
[32:20] have to do your stuff God expects that
[32:22] that's why you put man on Earth to tell
[32:24] his soil to work watch this now by feet
[32:27] Stephen
