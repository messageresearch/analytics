[57:55] sitting in your office Lee and feeling
[57:58] the vibrations of heaven amen we know
[58:01] that God is here this morning and it's
[58:03] already in the building so what we have
[58:05] to do is to just yield ourselves so the
[58:08] spirit that is already here and then see
[58:11] what he would do for us this morning
[58:13] because only he can do what he promised
[58:15] he do when he he can do what he said
[58:17] what happened Amen so we just want to
[58:20] just heal ourselves now and you get
[58:22] ready to switch over god bless you and
[58:24] let's just turn to our Bibles like to
[58:27] invite your attention to our reading of
[58:29] the word amen and I have two readings
[58:34] here the first one we want to look at is
[58:36] a First Samuel 16 and then you can find
[58:40] for marking the New Testament Saint
[58:42] Matthew 24 a man so let's start now with
[58:47] First Samuel chapter 16 and
[58:59] man a man so for Samuel 16 well we just
[59:08] read it from boots 1 ok so then the Lord
[59:11] said unto Samuel how long will they
[59:14] mourn for soul seeing I have rejected
[59:18] him from reigning over Israel filled
[59:22] einhorn with oil and go I will send thee
[59:26] to Jesse the Bethlem the Bethlehem ight
[59:29] for I have provided me a king among his
[59:33] sons and Samuel said how can I go if
[59:37] Saul hear it he will kill me and the
[59:41] Lord said take an heifer with thee and
[59:44] say I am come to sacrifice to the law
[59:46] Amen so God gave him a kind of an alibi
[59:49] here amen
[59:50] so he said I called Jesse to the
[59:52] sacrifice and I will show thee what thou
[59:55] would do watch out thou shalt do and
[59:57] thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I am
[1:00:01] I named unto thee right so in this
[1:00:04] situation also samuel is completely
[1:00:07] trusting in the lord to know who this
[1:00:09] person is because he doesn't have a name
[1:00:12] to go away he just is going by the
[1:00:15] witness of the law a man I could imagine
[1:00:18] he's like somebody waiting at the
[1:00:20] airport he doesn't have a face he just
[1:00:22] knows he's got to pick somebody up and
[1:00:24] he just waitin there for the Lord to
[1:00:26] tell him who it is
[1:00:27] Amen so so so this is the scene now is
[1:00:31] set you know so and Samuel did that
[1:00:35] which is Lord speak and booze for and
[1:00:37] came to Bethlehem and the elders of the
[1:00:39] town tremble that is coming hmm and he
[1:00:43] said what comment stop peaceful
[1:00:45] peaceably and he said peaceably I am
[1:00:47] come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify
[1:00:50] yourselves and come with me to the
[1:00:52] sacrifice and he sanctified Jesse and
[1:00:54] his sons and colon to the sacrifice and
[1:00:57] it came to pass when he could come that
[1:00:59] he looked on Alya
[1:01:00] and said surely the Lord is anointed as
[1:01:04] before him but the Lord said unto Samuel
[1:01:08] look not on his countenance or on the
[1:01:12] height of his stature because I have
[1:01:15] refused him for the Lord see it watch
[1:01:19] not as man seeing for man looketh on the
[1:01:23] outward appearance but the Lord looketh
[1:01:28] on the heart he men any man I want to
[1:01:32] stop right there priest good and bad
[1:01:35] chap 24 will read that no I 224 and was
[1:01:41] 21 please God
[1:01:47] 1924 and was 21 it says for then he got
[1:01:54] it man
[1:01:54] not to 24 21 says for then shall be a
[1:01:57] Great Tribulation such as was not since
[1:02:00] the beginning of the world to this time
[1:02:02] no nor ever shall be that's what's
[1:02:05] coming and except those days should be
[1:02:08] shortened there should no flesh be see
[1:02:10] but for the elects eat whose these shall
[1:02:15] be shortened and if any man shall say
[1:02:18] unto you lo here is Christ or there
[1:02:20] believe it not for they shall arise
[1:02:23] false Christ's and false prophets and
[1:02:27] shall sow great signs and wonders and so
[1:02:29] much that if it were possible they shall
[1:02:32] deceive the very elect behold I have
[1:02:35] told you before wherefore if they shall
[1:02:37] say unto you behold he is in the desert
[1:02:39] go not forth or behold he's in the
[1:02:42] behold isn't a secret chambers believe
[1:02:45] it not he said was lightning comment out
[1:02:48] of the east and china even unto the West
[1:02:51] so also shall the coming of the Son of
[1:02:55] Man be for wheresoever the carcase is
[1:02:59] there will the eagle's be gathered
[1:03:02] together amen amen so we got it together

[1:06:19] come to us a word in due season
[1:06:21] how good it is this morning so that's
[1:06:24] what we come to here
[1:06:25] we're in due season you can wake us up
[1:06:28] for such a time as this now we just want
[1:06:31] to thank the Lord this morning to be
[1:06:32] here and it says moosian greece this
[1:06:35] morning we could come into this place
[1:06:37] and worshiping and praise God like we do
[1:06:39] as many others that wish they could be
[1:06:41] in your seat this morning for some it's
[1:06:44] too late praise God for some it's not
[1:06:45] their time yet but God has anointed you
[1:06:48] this morning
[1:06:49] with a special measure of grease that
[1:06:51] you could shout that you could lift your
[1:06:54] hands if you could see man oh it's a
[1:06:57] grace of God this morning where would we
[1:06:59] be without the grace of God will be
[1:07:02] nothing this morning
[1:07:03] we'd be nobody so we thank God for His
[1:07:05] mercy and we just want to just land
[1:07:08] ourselves over to the Holy Spirit this
[1:07:10] morning
[1:07:11] I have a title this morning and it is
[1:07:14] the true seed of the word and I also
[1:07:17] have an inspiration here and says the
[1:07:19] Lord looketh upon the heart a man the
[1:07:23] Lord look at upon the heart then be
[1:07:24] taking that inspiration here from Samuel
[1:07:27] which you read in the scripture is now
[1:07:29] right Laureen so let's begin so we're
[1:07:33] hearing a story of David being - and
[1:07:35] just before the scripture we read in
[1:07:38] Samuel we see that God had rejected Saul
[1:07:41] as king over his people Israel it's not
[1:07:45] right and here it was that the people
[1:07:48] said we want a king over us the judges
[1:07:50] and Samuel pleaded with the people said
[1:07:53] God is all King a man we we have no need
[1:07:56] of a judge is now right in that way and
[1:07:59] he said but nobody they reason against
[1:08:01] him and and and Bible said Saul was
[1:08:06] disturbed and when God spoke
[1:08:08] samuel was astir brother and God spoke
[1:08:11] to Samuel a prophet he said they have
[1:08:13] not rejected you but they have rejected
[1:08:15] me
[1:08:16] amen amen all is now right so the people
[1:08:19] wanted to be like the other nations is
[1:08:22] my right and sometimes that's the
[1:08:24] problem we begin to compare ourselves
[1:08:26] with others and other people and what
[1:08:30] they've gotten where they are in life
[1:08:32] and we fail to see that God's doing
[1:08:35] something special with you isn't that
[1:08:38] right so sometimes we just got a humble
[1:08:41] ourselves and let God use us where we
[1:08:43] are
[1:08:44] stop trying to be like so-and-so the
[1:08:46] Prophet said that he said you know they
[1:08:48] get jealous and said well so-and-so's
[1:08:50] planting corn I want to plant corn too I
[1:08:52] want to pump barley - but God can't
[1:08:54] place you
[1:08:55] if you're running around trying to be
[1:08:57] like brother so-and-so or sister so and
[1:09:00] so you have to take the anointing he
[1:09:02] gives you you have to work with what
[1:09:04] measure he gives you to work with his
[1:09:07] mind so I'm not trying to be like
[1:09:10] anybody this morning I'm I'm not no
[1:09:12] great man I'm not no great praise God
[1:09:15] person or anything I'm just our brother
[1:09:17] praise God bring in the Word of God to
[1:09:20] you this morning
[1:09:21] amen but I know someone who's here this
[1:09:24] morning who can meet your need and he
[1:09:27] could set the captive free and he could
[1:09:30] bless you beyond anything that I could
[1:09:33] ever to hallelujah is not about me it's
[1:09:37] about him it's not about you this
[1:09:39] morning it's not about what we can do
[1:09:41] it's about what he has already done this
[1:09:44] precious blood has made a way that we
[1:09:48] could come into his presence through the
[1:09:52] blood or we could plead the promises
[1:09:55] through the blood we could claim my
[1:09:58] inheritance we could claim our promise
[1:10:06] see many man please God so we don't
[1:10:11] claim to be nothing great it's God I
[1:10:15] look at upon the heart sees what's
[1:10:18] inside of it amen amen how a few things
[1:10:21] to see this morning so I'll just kind of
[1:10:23] take my time and go into it but I just
[1:10:25] want you to worship and get into the
[1:10:26] spirit this morning and go on a journey
[1:10:28] with me this morning because sometimes
[1:10:31] you get so bogged down with life and
[1:10:33] things get you know you're pulled here
[1:10:36] and there this family commitment work
[1:10:39] commitments bills taxes payments courts
[1:10:43] you name it you have all these things
[1:10:45] happening all around you and somehow you
[1:10:48] have to find a place of quiet in the
[1:10:51] midst of all of this to hear God speak
[1:10:55] to you
[1:10:56] he had a rustle in the mulberry tree you
[1:10:58] may not have to meet actually make a
[1:11:00] conscious effort now to turn off a lot
[1:11:03] of the channels and a lot of the noises
[1:11:05] and a lot of the distractions he means
[1:11:09] now I'm a man somehow I wish I could go
[1:11:12] back ten years younger than I was even
[1:11:16] so much has happened in 10 years there's
[1:11:18] so much distractions no your cell phone
[1:11:20] alone has 15 different ways people can
[1:11:22] communicate with you it's not if it's
[1:11:24] not Instagram its whatsapp is inaudible
[1:11:26] Facebook it's not Facebook is this is
[1:11:28] not this is that is that is that it's
[1:11:30] work amen and chain emails different
[1:11:34] things and sometimes
[1:11:35] day off is just it's almost impossible
[1:11:38] amen but we have to fight to redeem the
[1:11:43] time now God and it's been set up that
[1:11:46] way and all nature is set up that way
[1:11:49] you've got to fight the toughest will
[1:11:52] survive it's not you've got to make up
[1:11:56] in your mind that you're going to make
[1:11:57] it it's not like you're gonna tell
[1:12:00] yourself something this morning gotta
[1:12:03] tell yourself that you're not going to
[1:12:05] give up you're not going to back down
[1:12:07] what are you telling yourself this
[1:12:10] morning hallelujah
[1:12:14] because the true seed of the word it's
[1:12:18] gonna shine forth the praises of his
[1:12:21] glory the true seed in the last days
[1:12:24] every false Christ's false anointed
[1:12:27] people who claim to have this dream to
[1:12:29] have that but God promised for the
[1:12:31] elects sake he's gonna shorten those
[1:12:34] things so that he can make a way out for
[1:12:37] you and for your family and for many
[1:12:40] years a lot of hotshot Paul he's gonna
[1:12:43] make a way out
[1:12:44] Oh glory to God a man
[1:12:49] paulownia promise to make away when you
[1:12:58] see these things happening look up for
[1:13:00] your redemption try it now amen amen
[1:13:03] hallelujah we look into the hills this
[1:13:05] morning for men's comment our help we're
[1:13:08] not looking to natural things we're not
[1:13:10] looking to our pockets we're not looking
[1:13:12] to what people can provide what we can
[1:13:14] do for ourselves we are nothing this
[1:13:16] morning without its presence without its
[1:13:19] power we are nothing there's nothing
[1:13:20] that we can achieve our finite minds
[1:13:23] could never comprehend the grace of
[1:13:27] Almighty God the vastness of our God the
[1:13:30] powerful God the glory of our God so
[1:13:34] don't even try
[1:13:35] you just worship Him this morning you
[1:13:38] just praise him this morning
[1:13:40] for his goodness and mercy man you have
[1:13:55] an air this morning I'll give you a
[1:13:58] spiritually down in your soul that you
[1:14:02] could be a receptor for the waves of
[1:14:05] glory sing over us right now hallelujah
[1:14:09] the true seed of the word of God you've
[1:14:11] got something inside your hearts the
[1:14:14] devil didn't put it there

[1:15:19] taste but all of the taste Oh hallelujah

[1:15:27] weary change on the piece of feel tired
[1:15:29] right now miss relax he promised you a
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:43] many man so we thank God for His Word
[1:15:46] and I've a note here second Timothy
[1:15:48] three all Scripture is given by
[1:15:52] inspiration of God what we do it
[1:15:55] audience permission of God it would just
[1:15:58] be that letter but the Spirit of it like
[1:16:00] it keep by inspiration oh I love it
[1:16:05] Peter Paul James there were men just
[1:16:08] like you and I but they met cause they
[1:16:11] have situations and trials they had
[1:16:13] circumstances but they met God Moses
[1:16:16] elusive stutter but he met cause and
[1:16:19] crop became his mouthpiece oh hello
[1:16:21] Jacob was a deceiver but God there's
[1:16:24] something in Jacob and he turned his
[1:16:26] name from Jacob to fly
[1:16:28] oh hello my take my chosen nation God
[1:16:33] could change your name this morning you
[1:16:35] don't have to be the same Oh hallelujah
[1:16:38] we can leave here change well that's the
[1:16:41] purpose of the gospel
[1:16:43] what's the changes from glory to glory
[1:16:46] even as by the Spirit of the Lord will
[1:16:50] be holding a glass left with the Peace
[1:16:51] of the Lord we are changed into that
[1:16:53] glory let's give God give you an image
[1:16:55] something to look at but you get a spy
[1:16:57] atchoo and more you look at it the more
[1:17:00] your noisy to yourself the more you
[1:17:02] begin to change into that image I'm not
[1:17:04] looking on the left I'm not looking on
[1:17:06] alright I got my eye on the prize
[1:17:08] come on Calvary I come I going up here
[1:17:11] yonder
[1:17:12] gotta quit up him seven steps seven
[1:17:16] steps of glory oh yeah what did the
[1:17:23] Prophet say he took my place he said now
[1:17:26] Lord let me take his poor that's a
[1:17:28] purpose e-type oh oh my that's right so
[1:17:36] a charge to look at this vision here of
[1:17:41] these seven steps and to see what we are
[1:17:46] to become a many men it's not right
[1:17:50] let's go back to Samuel here no ma I
[1:17:54] don't want to jump around a little bit
[1:17:56] but I just want to man see what because
[1:17:59] God has somebody's here to show you this
[1:18:00] morning so now we see that Samuel is
[1:18:03] supposed to go on anoint one of the sons
[1:18:05] of Jesse that's that's that's the
[1:18:07] instruction he got if used to write it
[1:18:10] on a piece of paper he said I'm going
[1:18:12] today to anoint one of the sons of Jesse
[1:18:15] I don't know which one I don't have an
[1:18:19] ID card I don't have a passport size
[1:18:22] photo I don't have a IG profile I don't
[1:18:26] have anything to go with I don't even
[1:18:28] have a GPS location all I know is I'm
[1:18:31] supposed to go down to Jesse the
[1:18:33] Bethlehem and to search out one of his
[1:18:36] sons to anoint for King
[1:18:39] you see and God is doing something in
[1:18:41] secret cuz he didn't tell him to go and
[1:18:42] anoint the king in that we said we just
[1:18:45] come for sacrifice and we just come to
[1:18:47] make way for the Lord
[1:18:49] isn't that right just kind of let him
[1:18:52] know what they need to know get him in
[1:18:54] the spirit of the thing in May that God
[1:18:55] could begin to do work his mystery and
[1:18:57] unfold his mystery right among the
[1:19:00] people is now right see Samuel aggrieved
[1:19:03] that even anointed Saul and Gore
[1:19:06] repented that saw the king of Israel so
[1:19:09] what happened so I got fired so I got
[1:19:14] fired God said I have refused him amen
[1:19:18] amen it's now and I'm gonna find
[1:19:20] somebody now who's more worthy of this
[1:19:22] throne of this position of this
[1:19:25] Authority isn't that right
[1:19:27] so here comes Samuel no and I love what
[1:19:30] the Bible said he come down and they
[1:19:31] make the sacrifice and Jesse and his
[1:19:34] sons were sanctified and they come to
[1:19:35] the service we're Schiffman to please
[1:19:38] the Lord and to do that one third and do
[1:19:42] what they supposed to do a man and just
[1:19:44] in perfect order is now right God was
[1:19:47] pleased God begin to move and then all
[1:19:50] of a sudden in Samuel look upon a lion
[1:19:53] and Samuel says surely this has to be
[1:19:56] the one he looked at him might have look
[1:19:59] at his height this is his tall this
[1:20:01] structure maybe he did hundred push-ups
[1:20:04] a day I don't know yeah muscles look
[1:20:06] nice to look at
[1:20:07] you know Saul look nice too until he
[1:20:10] failed to slaughter the Amalekites until
[1:20:14] he failed to do what God told him to do
[1:20:15] it man it's not right he was good look
[1:20:18] at you know he was a tall guy he was
[1:20:19] real handsome looking priests go it's
[1:20:21] not right that was the outward
[1:20:23] appearance you man and God told Samuel
[1:20:26] he said no said see that you do not not
[1:20:28] he said if I have refused him it's not
[1:20:32] right said why because God does not look
[1:20:36] as man see it but he looks not at the
[1:20:41] outward appearance but God is looking at
[1:20:45] the heart
[1:20:46] it's not right it's not right he's
[1:20:50] looking down down on the inside it's
[1:20:53] nice so now I have a few slides actually
[1:20:58] want to show you and brothers get ready
[1:21:00] to begin to show that and it's kind of
[1:21:03] about dimensions and all of it is pretty
[1:21:06] much mathematical in nature so I'm just
[1:21:09] gonna go through it real quick and I
[1:21:11] don't mean to confound you by in any way
[1:21:12] but please God I'm gonna make this down
[1:21:15] real simple
[1:21:16] please go so I don't know if you can see
[1:21:19] what I'm seeing here but it's my first
[1:21:21] projection here now and this is what
[1:21:23] they call a one dimension object so it
[1:21:26] just has one dimension it's a line see
[1:21:28] and it goes from here to here back here
[1:21:31] that's pretty much all of the movement
[1:21:33] that you can get you know first
[1:21:36] dimension object this is one dimension
[1:21:37] here is now right so we all good with
[1:21:40] that amen okay so let's go to the next
[1:21:41] line let's go to our second dimension
[1:21:44] object so now what I want you to
[1:21:46] understand now is to catch a picture of
[1:21:48] something a little greater than we're
[1:21:50] accustomed to because this is a second
[1:21:53] dimension object now perfectly this is
[1:21:55] the second dimension screen so we can
[1:21:58] see there's a length and either a width
[1:22:00] and those are the measurements and of
[1:22:03] course it's a perfect square so they put
[1:22:04] the seen and this is what a second
[1:22:06] dimension object looks like all right so
[1:22:09] it's a square shape you can have a
[1:22:11] circle triangle of different things got
[1:22:13] it okay great let's follow me here now
[1:22:15] let's go to the next line you know thank
[1:22:17] you you may wish it was brothers back
[1:22:19] there in the third dimension object now
[1:22:22] now this is where it gets interesting
[1:22:24] now this is the world that we live in
[1:22:26] the third dimension and we see that
[1:22:30] there's different heights of things
[1:22:31] there's length
[1:22:33] there's width but there's also height
[1:22:34] and depth to things and we are operating
[1:22:38] in that world every day we walk around
[1:22:41] and we see things depend perspective we
[1:22:44] see light shadows being cast and this is
[1:22:47] a world where we are accustomed to this
[1:22:49] is what we grow up knowing this two
[1:22:52] dimension world isn't that right now
[1:22:55] mathematics has kind of suggested
[1:22:58] something
[1:22:59] and they say that if we begin to
[1:23:01] progress in mathematics we can actually
[1:23:04] begin to catch a picture of what's
[1:23:06] happening outside of our world so they
[1:23:09] said if the lines come together to make
[1:23:12] a second dimension object then the
[1:23:14] second dimension object which is the
[1:23:15] square come together to make the
[1:23:18] two-dimensional object which is these
[1:23:19] here you see that right
[1:23:21] so the two-dimensional object is made up
[1:23:23] of second dimension objects so they are
[1:23:25] willing to suggest that the third
[1:23:28] dimension object can suggest what the
[1:23:31] fourth dimension object will look like
[1:23:32] now let's flip that picture over there
[1:23:35] so this is actually what science says
[1:23:39] and mathematics both agree is a fourth
[1:23:42] dimension object and what they call it
[1:23:45] is they call it a tesseract
[1:23:47] now our human minds are too finite to
[1:23:52] comprehend what this is really supposed
[1:23:55] to look like so science has tried to get
[1:23:59] the best picture of what a
[1:24:01] four-dimensional object would look like
[1:24:03] so this isn't perfect
[1:24:05] this is just what science best guess is
[1:24:09] what a four-dimensional object actually
[1:24:12] looks like now this could get very
[1:24:15] complicated because obviously we are not
[1:24:17] cubes so if we were to look like this
[1:24:21] you begin to see some really crazy stuff
[1:24:23] the over your brain can't comprehend it
[1:24:26] see it's in a world outside of ours okay
[1:24:29] now let's put the next picture now what
[1:24:31] they've been able to do is they've been
[1:24:34] able to rotate this tesseract what we
[1:24:37] call it and what we are beginning to see
[1:24:40] here I don't know if you could notice if
[1:24:41] you look at it close enough you're gonna
[1:24:43] notice that the square on the inside is
[1:24:46] actually coming out on the outside and
[1:24:49] becoming the square the outside and it's
[1:24:52] continuously rotating like that
[1:24:55] that's so science is saying that if
[1:24:58] there is a creature that exists outside
[1:25:01] of the third dimension he's going to see
[1:25:05] something that looks like this where the
[1:25:08] inside of the object is just as
[1:25:11] visible as the outside of the object
[1:25:15] does that sound familiar in any way flip
[1:25:19] to the next picture they try to break it
[1:25:21] down into what it could be in terms of
[1:25:23] atomic structure and this is kind of
[1:25:26] what they came up with still very
[1:25:29] confusing they put a bunch of tesseracts
[1:25:31] together but I just want you to catch a
[1:25:33] picture this morning of what a fourth
[1:25:36] dimension creature they call it someone
[1:25:38] outside of our world outside of our
[1:25:41] universe is able to see 50 next picture
[1:25:44] now all right so you got that class a
[1:25:47] man I'm sorry for all the slides but I'm
[1:25:49] getting to a point here now let's go
[1:25:51] back to the 2-dimensional field is now
[1:25:53] now I love this part here what they
[1:25:55] thought about they said that the
[1:25:57] two-dimensional field this is what it
[1:25:59] looks like it's like a piece of paper
[1:26:01] that you could pull in your hands and
[1:26:03] you could see a book maybe you have a
[1:26:06] piece of people like this this is a
[1:26:08] two-dimensional plane this
[1:26:10] two-dimensional plane could represent a
[1:26:12] whole world
[1:26:14] now let's for instance imagine that we
[1:26:18] are this circle right over here in this
[1:26:21] two-dimensional world we can't really
[1:26:24] see much because if we were the circle
[1:26:27] we wouldn't be able to see much of
[1:26:29] anything here actually what we would see
[1:26:32] is a line here and a line here because
[1:26:34] our eyes would be looking in this
[1:26:35] direction but we would never see the
[1:26:38] whole picture but because we are
[1:26:42] three-dimensional creatures we could
[1:26:45] look into a two-dimensional world and
[1:26:48] see the entire picture it gives us a
[1:26:52] higher perspective that means that we
[1:26:56] know the end from the beginning we know
[1:26:59] the top we know the bottom we know it's
[1:27:01] where it starts and we know where it
[1:27:03] finishes and science and mathematics is
[1:27:06] suggesting that if there is we as
[1:27:09] three-dimensional creatures could see a
[1:27:11] two-dimensional world then it is
[1:27:13] possible to the next picture
[1:27:14] it is possible for a fourth dimension
[1:27:17] creature to see something that looks a
[1:27:20] little more expanded than what we are
[1:27:22] accustomed to
[1:27:24] it means that God has the ability to
[1:27:27] look down on our three-dimensional world
[1:27:30] and see everything in a greater measure
[1:27:34] and you can see you can see your end you
[1:27:38] can see your beginning you can see a
[1:27:40] pass you can see your future you can see
[1:27:43] a top you can see your bottom you can
[1:27:45] see a potential you can see how far you
[1:27:47] are how far you need to be who you are
[1:27:50] what name you are where your family was
[1:27:53] where you are praise God he knows
[1:27:56] everything about you did you get it and
[1:28:05] it's like but overall they say it's like
[1:28:07] a book and God has the ability to scroll
[1:28:11] through the book and that's a picture
[1:28:13] that we could catch but really what it
[1:28:15] is
[1:28:16] it's a great big universe that God has
[1:28:19] in his hands and each one of you he's
[1:28:22] turning and he's flipping and he's
[1:28:24] looking for our representation of
[1:28:27] himself some over here some over there
[1:28:31] in each age we keep flipping the object
[1:28:34] flipping the image because he was
[1:28:37] looking for something oh he was looking
[1:28:42] for his seat from before the beginning
[1:28:44] God has the ability to flip your
[1:28:47] three-dimensional objects well over and
[1:28:50] over until you see what's inside your
[1:28:52] heart
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:29:02] now I know this is this is really
[1:29:05] there's a really a bloomer now let's go
[1:29:08] to that next slide I was supposed to
[1:29:09] come after this one now I finished with
[1:29:12] lesson here this last two last two
[1:29:14] slides I promise now this is a
[1:29:17] three-dimensional view of a ball in a
[1:29:18] box we got that right so someone is
[1:29:20] putting the ball inside of the box now
[1:29:22] what they say is that in the third
[1:29:24] dimension where we are a three
[1:29:27] dimensional object it has the ability to
[1:29:30] hide other objects inside of it that's
[1:29:32] because we are only seeing the outside
[1:29:35] of the box we are not allowed to see
[1:29:37] inside of the box if they took a lid and
[1:29:39] put it over this box close the ball and
[1:29:41] sang you wouldn't see it they said but
[1:29:45] outside of that dimension flip the next
[1:29:47] picture mathematics is suggesting that
[1:29:51] in the fourth dimension you can actually
[1:29:54] see inside of that box it's exposed it's
[1:29:59] almost like an x-ray you could just flip
[1:30:02] the picture and see what's inside of it
[1:30:04] and then what's inside comes out on what
[1:30:06] outside comes in it's all the same to
[1:30:08] them out there outside of that dimension
[1:30:11] is nice hallelujah it's a perfect
[1:30:14] picture you see it take it off this
[1:30:15] right in man god bless you thank you and
[1:30:18] it's a perfect picture to me this
[1:30:20] morning that God is not looking at
[1:30:24] things the way that you are seeing it a
[1:30:27] lot of the times we focus so much on
[1:30:31] this outside thing and we trying to
[1:30:34] pretty up this two dimensional object
[1:30:37] ohyes not put on a nice time suit on all
[1:30:41] that is wonderful but God is not looking
[1:30:44] at tap this morning God seeing more than
[1:30:47] that to come praise God Ricardo cell
[1:30:52] together we see one another we check
[1:30:55] each other's hands that's wonderful but
[1:30:58] when God
[1:30:59] tongue in your world he could see more
[1:31:02] than you can see he's seeing a bigger
[1:31:06] picture this morning or he could see
[1:31:09] Tong pass your flesh pass your spirits
[1:31:13] tongue in a socket of your heart and the
[1:31:16] higher you go in the dimensions is the
[1:31:19] more that you can uncover it's the more
[1:31:22] that you can see or the higher you go
[1:31:25] and he said I am the high and lofty one
[1:31:28] oh well it with him of a broken heart on
[1:31:31] a contract spirits God knows you're
[1:31:34] inside this morning that in the presence
[1:31:45] of God we actually stand naked before
[1:31:49] him we are completely exposed all that
[1:31:54] you try to cover up Adam had a cover in
[1:31:59] one time he saw fig leaves try to cover
[1:32:03] himself because he felt naked holiday
[1:32:06] because that's not covering I was over
[1:32:09] in a supernatural cover him was pulled
[1:32:11] off of him and he knew the sin that he
[1:32:13] had committed and he was afraid of God I
[1:32:16] went quote calm down caught on pick up
[1:32:20] already
[1:32:20] not a Darlene nothing the same condition
[1:32:23] he was when I left him because when I
[1:32:26] flipped the test something is wrong
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:34] [Applause]
[1:32:40] Adam Adam welcome where are you I'm not
[1:32:46] seeing you in my Kazem in my economy
[1:32:52] here the way things move and working the
[1:32:54] thousand places but as soon as he got
[1:32:56] out of position everything went out of
[1:32:58] whack
[1:32:59] try to get a picture know the chaos that
[1:33:03] took place don't in that dimension when
[1:33:06] man lost his position of authority the
[1:33:09] lion is to live with the lamb but now
[1:33:11] all that flip over all that change color
[1:33:14] different nature holiday I got a
[1:33:16] different behavior different things
[1:33:18] started to happen and God knew something
[1:33:20] went wrong the whole turn change and go
[1:33:23] to realize something was wrong he come
[1:33:25] down to investigate because man was out
[1:33:28] of position the world fell in darkness
[1:33:34] Halloween I know the profits that come
[1:33:37] after was the shadows was just types but
[1:33:40] there was one that come the Bible said
[1:33:42] when he hallelujah put him and when he
[1:33:44] came upon the people the Bible said the
[1:33:47] light had sprung up holily a lighter
[1:33:49] Sean where there wasn't light before he
[1:33:52] came a man saying the kingdom of heaven
[1:33:54] is at hand it was Jesus he was different
[1:33:58] he was unique he was special when God
[1:34:02] flip him when God flip and he said
[1:34:04] behold here's my beloved Son in whom I
[1:34:07] am well pleased I'm well pleased
[1:34:08] apologized him I'm well pleased I carry
[1:34:11] him in the wilderness to be tested and
[1:34:13] tempting Oh hallelujah alright because
[1:34:15] he's not like the image I was in the
[1:34:19] beginning
[1:34:19] [Applause]
[1:34:23] well are you catching it now a man so
[1:34:27] God doesn't look at the output
[1:34:28] appearance but he looks on the inside
[1:34:31] and he knows the whole plan now it's as
[1:34:36] I said it's really complicated and it's
[1:34:38] beyond us trying to even figure out
[1:34:40] because if he dwells in a seventh
[1:34:43] dimension then think of how much
[1:34:46] dimensions they are beyond between us
[1:34:48] and him and how much understanding you
[1:34:52] have to get to before you can even begin
[1:34:55] to see or understand what God sees David
[1:34:59] said knowledge to high for me
[1:35:02] I cannot attain unto it follow me so
[1:35:10] we're not trying to figure it out this
[1:35:11] morning we're just trusting in God
[1:35:14] because he knows the plan he knows the
[1:35:18] way he knows we're supposed to go what
[1:35:21] you're supposed to do who is supposed to
[1:35:23] talk to what shop is supposed to have Oh
[1:35:26] hallelujah Oh glory
[1:35:30] so this morning or prayer ought to be
[1:35:33] lon
[1:35:34] show us thy will show me what I'm
[1:35:38] supposed to do because if he knows the
[1:35:41] end from the beginning he knows what you
[1:35:43] are supposed what you have need of he
[1:35:46] knows where you're supposed to end up
[1:35:48] and he knows what decision you're
[1:35:51] supposed to make so that means this
[1:35:54] morning you are charged to trust the God
[1:35:57] that knows the whole picture with all of
[1:36:01] your decision-making
[1:36:02] hallelujah with everything that you're
[1:36:04] supposed to to trust God this morning
[1:36:08] he knows his glory fills the temple he's
[1:36:17] a part of the universe
[1:36:19] he's a part of the Stars part of the
[1:36:21] mountains there's nothing greater than
[1:36:23] Alcorn hallelujah
[1:36:26] heaven is my throne the earth is my
[1:36:28] footstool he come down and visit his
[1:36:31] people ohand blesses people with healing
[1:36:35] and deliverance oh he's always on time
[1:36:45] he hears your voice a man a man the
[1:36:56] woman at the well she didn't know what
[1:37:05] was inside of her she didn't know what
[1:37:10] is inside of her
[1:37:11] furthermore the outward appearance
[1:37:12] looked bleak because when you look at
[1:37:15] our output appearance when you look at
[1:37:17] her works you wouldn't want to be near
[1:37:20] to that woman people didn't want to be
[1:37:23] seen with her people don't want to talk
[1:37:25] to her it's not right and in those days
[1:37:28] there was Pharisees there was Sadducees
[1:37:32] there was man who lofty man of the cloth
[1:37:36] men who were revered and respected among
[1:37:39] the people is now right tippy in the
[1:37:42] marketplaces kissing the babies looking
[1:37:46] all political piracy means that actor
[1:37:49] which means they acted out their
[1:37:51] religion holy holy when tall hats is now
[1:37:56] right but when poor look Tong and that
[1:37:59] same thing what people call ingrates
[1:38:02] call Paul foolishness consider like
[1:38:06] Deadman points and the Nexus focus
[1:38:09] when I look at them I don't see no
[1:38:12] witness when I slip damage it can't
[1:38:15] nothing I can see
[1:38:17] it don't make sense to me let me go find
[1:38:21] somebody but this word will make more
[1:38:24] sense to because the Messiah came to
[1:38:27] them and they understood him not and
[1:38:30] they knew him not but as many as
[1:38:33] received him to them gave he power to
[1:38:36] become the sons of God because they had
[1:38:39] a witness in their soul thank you Jesus
[1:38:56] Oh glory glory glory glory it's a bigger
[1:39:02] picture span your vision this morning
[1:39:06] beyond all this 3-dimensional stuff
[1:39:09] beyond the chair that you're sitting on
[1:39:11] beyond a suit that you're wearing a
[1:39:13] dress that you're wearing forget about
[1:39:15] all that there's a world that's more
[1:39:17] real and this one and you are here what
[1:39:21] you are somewhere else and we are going
[1:39:24] to that somewhere else by the sweet
[1:39:27] by-and-by promised us the hands of man
[1:39:33] Oh hallelujah glorious City as a bride
[1:39:37] adorned for her husband go here to meet
[1:39:40] him all the bridegroom comets let your
[1:39:44] robes white this morning Holy Ghost God
[1:39:54] in your soul fire come inside of there
[1:39:58] and change you and rearrange you
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:05] yeah come to this woman she gave me a
[1:40:13] drink
[1:40:14] he was waiting they told the disciples
[1:40:17] go and get some meat one buy something
[1:40:20] one relish yourselves I pass to Samaria
[1:40:25] I am just a two of his will but God have
[1:40:29] the plan I am just operating and accord
[1:40:33] with the plan in his hand
[1:40:35] see I have somebody down there who has
[1:40:37] who's got something in their soul she
[1:40:40] got her seed of predestination she don't
[1:40:42] know it yet
[1:40:43] she don't hear it yet but she's gonna
[1:40:45] hear it I'm sending you down go talk to
[1:40:48] that woman go tell her her name is on
[1:40:51] the book go tell her she's not what she
[1:40:53] ought to be but that boat Ella she's not
[1:40:56] what she used to be that voice speak to
[1:41:02] her gonna talk to the woman
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:08] investigating spirit of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:10] does feeling Christ begin to probe out
[1:41:13] the woman no we tell his story so many
[1:41:18] times but I can imagine cause reaction
[1:41:22] when Christ said go call your husband
[1:41:25] and she could have at that point she
[1:41:30] could have lied here was a
[1:41:32] respectable-looking man came and asked
[1:41:34] her you know for a husband she could
[1:41:36] have brought the man she was living with
[1:41:37] and see what this noise were she could
[1:41:39] have done that she could have fronted
[1:41:41] put up a front seal it's a shameful
[1:41:44] thing to say I don't have but she chose
[1:41:47] at that moment to be honest she chose at
[1:41:52] that moment
[1:41:52] might have been a quite a dishonorable
[1:41:54] thing what she said at that point in
[1:41:56] time but she chose rather to be honest
[1:41:59] right there and then with this stranger
[1:42:02] she's never met but yet she felt that
[1:42:05] there's something about this man that
[1:42:06] was different I when he spoke to her go
[1:42:09] call your husband she said I have none
[1:42:11] and I can imagine at that moment God
[1:42:13] begin to smile
[1:42:15] I said I didn't make a mistake this is
[1:42:18] the one and he said you speak the truth
[1:42:20] because I won the 11 it is not shown he
[1:42:28] said if you know who you are talking to
[1:42:30] you asked me for drink of water and he
[1:42:35] said there's gonna come a time what the
[1:42:39] true worshipers the father in spirit was
[1:42:48] a true worshiper she was going to come
[1:42:50] out of a situation come out of a
[1:42:52] circumstance come out of a trial come
[1:42:55] out of a chest it's only a test it's
[1:43:00] only temporary this morning fill your
[1:43:04] hopes on things eternal and a hold of
[1:43:07] God's unchanging hand all the things of
[1:43:10] this world are temporal it's just 3d
[1:43:14] just an illusion of reality it'll all
[1:43:17] fit away pretty soon well hallelujah
[1:43:20] what's more real than this it's the
[1:43:22] thing that keeps put to this world in
[1:43:24] the first place and it'll be a thing
[1:43:27] that recreates it John said behold I
[1:43:29] said a new heaven and a new earth and
[1:43:31] the old one was faded away and town come
[1:43:33] a city whole hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:37] hallelujah
[1:43:38] and just as God has a city but it's
[1:43:41] pulling up people to go and inhabit that
[1:43:43] city and you are that people hallelujah
[1:43:49] the devil is a liar this morning try to
[1:43:52] tell you couldn't make it but you were
[1:43:54] born for this you will raise up for this
[1:43:57] oh don't let the devil tell you
[1:44:00] otherwise God knows your story this
[1:44:03] morning
[1:44:07] man said I just speak it to you I am he
[1:44:12] woman ran why because she saw something
[1:44:16] something greater than what she was
[1:44:18] seeing all the time something greater
[1:44:21] than her 3d world she saw something
[1:44:24] higher a higher perspective
[1:44:26] yeah higher voice calling her upward out
[1:44:30] of what she was into what God wanted her
[1:44:32] to be a man and we answered a call this
[1:44:35] morning because there's a voice calling
[1:44:37] you this morning calling you higher come
[1:44:41] out of her my people be not partakers of
[1:44:43] her plagues come out of her Oh
[1:44:46] chimera confusion come out of Babylon
[1:44:48] and be lifted up let the King of glory

[1:44:56] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[1:44:59] fire where is faith and virtue and
[1:45:01] dollar temperance
[1:45:03] wait you can turn you into that image
[1:45:05] from glory to glory man God knows the
[1:45:14] whole plan it's a big complicated plan
[1:45:19] there's many roads that you could take
[1:45:22] what God this wisdom is beyond anything
[1:45:26] finite in this world knows where the
[1:45:30] path is he knows he knows what's
[1:45:34] supposed to happen when I suppose happen
[1:45:35] we're supposed to happen these leagues
[1:45:37] above your thinking leads up of your
[1:45:40] situation leads up of your trial leads
[1:45:43] up of your circumstance trust in God
[1:45:47] this morning he is able to take you
[1:45:49] through hallelujah
[1:45:52] hallelujah he just knows I'm not trying
[1:45:59] to figure it out I'm just trusting in
[1:46:01] God because what science is declaring
[1:46:04] right now they say if they continue
[1:46:06] going so they go into bong supper entity
[1:46:08] that is so big it will scare them they
[1:46:13] just keep racing on in technology and
[1:46:15] figuring things out and as far as the
[1:46:17] radio waves gone hope far do the voice
[1:46:18] go and hope I'll is this going what's in
[1:46:20] this dimension wasn't that dimension man
[1:46:23] is continuing to tap into it isn't it
[1:46:25] trying to figure out the greatness of
[1:46:27] this car and this is quartz but this is
[1:46:31] this is God's this is God's plea feel
[1:46:34] God just moving at our own moving this
[1:46:37] around every time they try to do this we
[1:46:39] pluck them he plucked them here praise
[1:46:40] good God know where they're going
[1:46:42] you have them like enough fish for God
[1:46:44] is wanting control you could only go so
[1:46:47] far no more science don't see the try to
[1:46:49] figure out a 4 dimension object look
[1:46:52] like much more powerful for six but
[1:46:54] their brain is past figuring it out
[1:46:55] where we stop code continues and it goes
[1:46:59] on and he goes on and he goes on and he
[1:47:00] goes on and to eternity to Eternity Oh
[1:47:03] hallelujah
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:10] Goliath made a mistake when he defied
[1:47:13] the armies of the Living God he didn't
[1:47:16] realize what he was up against he
[1:47:18] thought his might he thought the
[1:47:20] structure he thought his shekels of iron
[1:47:22] had anything to do attached he thought
[1:47:24] he was nine cubits and a span and I was
[1:47:27] gonna measure up to anything what he
[1:47:29] didn't realize on the finger of God
[1:47:33] hallelujah molecule orientated sir who
[1:47:38] is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:47:41] [Applause]
[1:47:43] I'm Ananias who was thinking like God

[1:47:51] own heart

[1:59:28] silence in heaven space enough for now
[1:59:31] God press a button shut down nothing
[1:59:39] moved - ah and the devil was looking
[1:59:46] because he wanted to see what all this
[1:59:49] great thing was coming to he was
[1:59:52] building up to something 60 or 50 or 60
[1:59:53] coming on or something
[1:59:54] the devil is excited because he wanted
[1:59:57] to see what is under the Seventh Seal
[1:59:58] that was so important and he got a major
[2:00:03] disappointment when it opened and there
[2:00:08] were silence when a prophet said when
[2:00:11] that was taking place revelation 10 was
[2:00:15] taking place at the same time is now
[2:00:19] the Bible says seen as we have such a
[2:00:21] great cloud of witnesses let us run the
[2:00:24] race with patience so this cloud of
[2:00:26] witnesses which was Paul Iranians Martin
[2:00:29] Columba Lou - Wesley when the service
[2:00:34] here was shut down he shut down heaven
[2:00:36] God said come come my servants I'm gonna
[2:00:39] close you in the cloud and we're gonna
[2:00:41] go down to my prophets who is on the
[2:00:44] earth because he's got a message to get

[2:00:56] seven seals seven Thunder message oh the
[2:01:00] Eternals forbidden to write it he heard
[2:01:02] it I was about to write leaders had
[2:01:05] sealed up those things which is haven't
[2:01:07] done without her and write them not I'm
[2:01:09] gonna give it to my prophet he's gonna
[2:01:12] prophesy he's gonna testify of me the
[2:01:15] seven thunders will get paper wrapped
[2:01:17] her in grace
[2:01:19] antennas we'll call it back together

[2:01:52] in there nicely is now right on room and
[2:01:54] please key to the whole thing I'm gonna
[2:01:57] run a town into the ground and he tagged
[2:01:59] back there matters time for the truth
[2:02:02] this gospel dripping with blood but God
[2:02:05] swore by himself said I will restore see
[2:02:09] the Lord God promised he we saw that
[2:02:11] tree right back
[2:02:13] so up come loser I'm from Wesley I've
[2:02:16] come down other Pentecostals in the
[2:02:18] right they were coming onto something
[2:02:20] but when the Prophet come on eh that was
[2:02:23] the fullness of God made manifest oh and
[2:02:26] he counted together all of the mysteries
[2:02:29] all of the loose ends all of loser did
[2:02:32] all that Wesley Taylor he made it known
[2:02:34] attentive people what God was doing
[2:02:37] coming up to something it was coming up
[2:02:39] what it was to do this perfection
[2:02:45] now I'm gonna say something
[2:02:48] call us so mysterious that he couldn't
[2:02:52] give you the whole plan because they
[2:02:54] would blow your mind up like a scratch
[2:02:56] bomb okay it's too much
[2:02:59] so what God did he hid a mystery of
[2:03:03] himself all throughout through the ages
[2:03:07] hit it so Luther come up and preach the
[2:03:10] just shall live by faith and he was just
[2:03:13] living a part of it and the devil didn't
[2:03:16] know what's going on all he knows a big
[2:03:18] move and the people raised up and
[2:03:20] believe the word of that out hallelujah
[2:03:23] and then only rise they should take it
[2:03:24] over and the devil found a way in it
[2:03:25] it's nice
[2:03:27] let Wesley come up and he had another
[2:03:30] greater measure here speaking on
[2:03:32] sanctification it's nice and he ran up
[2:03:35] people of that day rose up and believed
[2:03:38] the world for a town and cried out
[2:03:40] hallelujah and begin to lift this Hannah
[2:03:44] fication so much until it please the
[2:03:46] Holy Spirit until I wanted to pour out
[2:03:48] upon them but the age was not yet
[2:03:51] Holland was not allowed to pour out in
[2:03:54] that way but they had a revival on the
[2:03:57] word for their name because this was a
[2:03:59] word in season it was a word for their
[2:04:02] time an hour and call throughout the
[2:04:04] ages throughout the dispensations was
[2:04:07] unfolding himself unfolding himself
[2:04:11] because when his loveliness in his
[2:04:14] wisdom his pictures are too much for us
[2:04:18] to understand God spoke to John and said
[2:04:21] come up hither I want to show you
[2:04:23] something and John began to see this the
[2:04:26] son of man liken us to one standing
[2:04:28] among the seven golden candlesticks and
[2:04:30] he said this and he spoke that John saw
[2:04:33] a light and a throne and it's now all
[2:04:36] these things are images images and
[2:04:39] visions a God gives to his servant John
[2:04:42] to show him things that was things that
[2:04:45] aren't things I want to come because it
[2:04:47] was too mysterious to show it and it's
[2:04:49] it's his brain can tell him all of that
[2:04:53] so court unfolded a revelation to him
[2:04:56] a book of symbols and you're gonna
[2:04:58] understand what this means and what that
[2:05:00] mean God beginning to speak to the
[2:05:01] church through symbols and to types and
[2:05:04] true shadows clawed hallelujah I never
[2:05:07] show in its mystery and full but here
[2:05:09] little they are little until you come
[2:05:12] into a perfect state where you could
[2:05:14] know all of these things it's not so
[2:05:18] it's gonna come out where you are going
[2:05:21] to know as you are known when God showed
[2:05:35] prophet the plan of what God was doing
[2:05:38] with them pyramids
[2:05:41] this was God's representation God given
[2:05:45] us our vision God given us a picture of
[2:05:48] what we are supposed to be isn't that
[2:05:51] right
[2:05:52] now this is just a picture but what you
[2:05:56] are going to do is to live this thing
[2:06:00] this has got to become a presence my
[2:06:05] experience in your life because the
[2:06:11] Bible said a letter killeth
[2:06:12] but the Spirit give it life and you've
[2:06:16] got to know God by an experience the
[2:06:18] Spirit has got to come and I love what
[2:06:21] Buddha George can lease and Wednesday
[2:06:22] night he said the spirit King you know
[2:06:25] after Jesus was baptized he suffered his
[2:06:27] baptism and then they'll come down and
[2:06:30] lighten up on him there was a sign of
[2:06:32] the Messiah but now watch he had to go
[2:06:35] into the wilderness to be tested and to
[2:06:38] be tried he had to be proven to be the
[2:06:42] right kind of a son so we can't just sit
[2:06:45] around saying we're gonna talk about it
[2:06:47] or we gonna fellowship around it how
[2:06:50] long are we going to hallelujah mon-sol
[2:06:53] let's go up color to perfection this

[2:08:16] accepting it believing it and it
[2:08:18] suddenly happens in here then God moves
[2:08:20] in with his spirit in that little hollow

[2:08:30] the Word of God and you have everlasting
[2:08:31] life and what you need now he said if
[2:08:34] you've never been baptized with water is
[2:08:36] to be baptized for the remission of your
[2:08:37] sins and then God has promised to give
[2:08:41] you the Holy Spirit oh he promised that

[2:28:50] his voice out he said it sent his voice
[2:28:51] out all around the earth I said you are
[2:28:54] the receiver might have been 2000 years
[2:28:57] later but God knew you would be here
[2:29:00] and that you would be the recipient of
[2:29:03] his voice
[2:29:05] [Applause]
[2:29:13] when Jesus said unhappy you shall know
[2:29:16] I'm and the father here in me and I knew
[2:29:19] that wasn't just three disciples that
[2:29:21] wasn't just whatever was all wrong but
[2:29:23] that world was for you that word was for
[2:29:25] me when he said I love you shall receive
[2:29:28] the gift of the Holy Ghost that wasn't

[2:29:59] spoken word and when that thing went out
[2:30:02] it was like a sparrow it had to find
[2:30:05] somebody and I thought find somebody

[2:30:54] to be a spouse of Joseph God set it up
[2:30:57] that we can look like confusion they
[2:31:05] make it look like commerce as we call it

[2:31:33] compute hallelujah pretty calm processes
[2:31:36] that is above their thinking it is above
[2:31:38] their understanding but somehow God put
[2:31:41] something in Mary to believe this thing
[2:31:44] she said be upon unto me according to
[2:31:48] thy word she didn't doubt it for one
[2:31:54] moment he just said he owns the Holy

[2:32:05] not the Son of the Living God
[2:32:08] Oh holily and she believed it all of us
[2:32:10] but she had to stand a persecution for
[2:32:13] that she understand a reproach and
[2:32:17] anytime you go out there to step out to
[2:32:19] believe something for God you're gonna
[2:32:21] stand a reproach oh there's a reproach
[2:32:24] that you have to bear for the words sake

[2:36:17] that's why when he speaks he knows and
[2:36:20] sunny you that will respond well he's

[2:36:31] are he knows where you are
[2:36:32] he knows who your family is he knows
[2:36:35] what your promises he knows you were
[2:36:37] born for this he knows you were raised
[2:36:39] up but such a time as this he knows that
[2:36:42] not long until eruption uh-huh crisis I
[2:36:50] miss your God reveal he said now notice
[2:36:53] what I retrieval purpose in his great
[2:36:55] mystery Secret Garden his mystery secret
[2:36:58] that he had before all began he's got a
[2:37:00] three-fold per person and he said I know
[2:37:02] we want to go up this morning and is
[2:37:05] what is this true for purpose he said
[2:37:06] see now I believe by the help of God who
[2:37:08] is present and he'll show it to us now
[2:37:11] if he had this threefold purpose we want
[2:37:13] to find out what is this tree for
[2:37:15] purpose I said the first thing was that
[2:37:17] God wanted to reveal himself to the
[2:37:19] people he's nobody couldn't do it as the
[2:37:22] great Jehovah God who covered all space
[2:37:25] and time and eternity that that picture
[2:37:28] is too big you don't know nothing
[2:37:30] outside of the third dimension so how
[2:37:32] are you gonna understand the vastness of
[2:37:33] this God it's impossible he said it was
[2:37:36] too mysterious right so he can do it as
[2:37:38] great Jehovah God to cover all eternity
[2:37:40] he couldn't so he's too great to ever be
[2:37:42] revealed to the people because it would
[2:37:44] be too mysterious how could that create
[2:37:47] big being that never to begin that never
[2:37:49] went beyond a circle of a hundred
[2:37:50] billion
[2:37:51] Trulia trillions years of life space and
[2:37:54] out into the in finite into the eternity
[2:37:57] and a great creature that was all that
[2:38:01] and still is so he describes his
[2:38:04] vastness trillions and trillions of
[2:38:06] light space I'm gonna occupies all of
[2:38:09] that and he still is this morning the
[2:38:12] mighty Conqueror the great and mighty
[2:38:14] spirits oh there is a mighty spirit this
[2:38:19] morning I covers here it covers you it
[2:38:23] speaks to me no I come in a volume of
[2:38:26] the book oh I didn't like to do thy will
[2:38:31] o my said I enter eternity a great
[2:38:46] creature he was and not all that is and
[2:38:49] still in sea but what he wanted to do
[2:38:51] well he loved fatherhood for he was a
[2:38:54] father and the only way that he could
[2:38:56] express it was to become a son of man he
[2:39:00] said that's the reason Jesus kept saying
[2:39:02] the son of man see the son of man they
[2:39:05] didn't they didn't know what he was
[2:39:05] talking about many of them but he was
[2:39:08] actually expressing God's attributes to
[2:39:11] be the son of man oh isn't that right oh
[2:39:13] my hallelujah excuse me he may I didn't
[2:39:18] know he was talking about no do you get
[2:39:19] it see a man he said he wanted to
[2:39:21] express himself that was his one of his
[2:39:24] great three four purposes was to express
[2:39:26] himself to identify himself they came to
[2:39:30] make a picture of himself that we could
[2:39:32] see that we can have fellowship with and
[2:39:35] we can interact with now he could know
[2:39:37] you by infirmities and by a false and my
[2:39:40] mistakes and my ax failures he the part
[2:39:43] of the universe became a humble man and
[2:39:46] grown with a headache

[2:43:31] oh my and when I said this is just rich
[2:43:34] to me the Prophet said just they even

[2:44:03] of loss if you never been lost before
[2:44:06] you wouldn't know how it meant to be
[2:44:07] saved if he wasn't burden you wouldn't
[2:44:11] know how it meant to be free if he
[2:44:13] wasn't empty you wouldn't know how it
[2:44:15] meant to be filled
[2:44:17] you wouldn't be gracious and you would
[2:44:19] never be able to sing Amazing Grace how
[2:44:22] sweet the sound but God calls God let
[2:44:26] all of this happen here so that his
[2:44:29] fullness could be expressed Oh cuz he
[2:44:36] could have been a father there that's
[2:44:37] true but he's also a savior he couldn't
[2:44:40] be a savior there when I remain evil
[2:44:42] perfect in a condition so he had to let
[2:44:45] things happen
[2:44:46] see he's saying how do you know he was
[2:44:47] well because I've had an experience the
[2:44:50] Prophet said see he's a savior and he

[2:57:45] forgave the unforgivable he reached out
[2:57:49] to those who are hungry to those who in

[2:59:11] David how horsemen David had a real good
[2:59:15] army they was jealous phalion kinds and
[2:59:18] yet God did not put his trust in Princes
[2:59:20] knowing horses when he put his trust in
[2:59:24] the Lord
[2:59:24] Oh put your trust in the Lord this
[2:59:26] morning and everything is going to be

[2:59:46] Oh hallelujah oh dear
[2:59:49] a man can ride away no no Oh hallelujah
[2:59:51] the unity of one God in one church the
[2:59:54] Prophet said it wasn't that it's here
[2:59:55] it's the so-called meetings here today
[2:59:57] he said oh they're Greek meetings but it
[3:00:00] only works on he limped intellectual
[3:00:02] part of man see a man gets under the
[3:00:04] spell of a revival and he says well yes
[3:00:06] I accept Christ he does it
[3:00:08] intellectually because maybe there isn't
[3:00:10] a great crowd and so forth he does it
[3:00:12] because maybe there's great ministers
[3:00:13] before him but it's only an intellectual
[3:00:16] conception that man could never go on
[3:00:18] he's got to come from his mind to his
[3:00:21] heart and be born again or he'll never
[3:00:25] be able to go on a mess now you never be
[3:00:28] able to stand the test well that's
[3:00:31] important when the real test comes can
[3:00:33] you stand it it'll prove the experience
[3:00:35] you have that's why he said it's got to
[3:00:37] come from your head all this
[3:00:39] intellectual stuff but you got to lay in
[3:00:42] the presence of the Sun until all the
[3:00:44] greenness it's beat out of you until you
[3:00:48] become mature until you become a right
[3:00:50] wing until it called down into the
[3:00:52] sockets of your heart and then the will
[3:00:55] it takes a real effect in your heart and
[3:00:58] life and then you begin to live
[3:01:00] something that this world will hear
[3:01:02] tyreq from cloth that's what it's got to
[3:01:05] come down to or we'll never make it
[3:01:07] friends
[3:01:08] oh my poor procrastinator a bride she's
[3:01:11] got what it takes
[3:01:12] she's like Mary she's got what it takes
[3:01:14] to go through the trial to go through
[3:01:17] the persecution to do all the way we
[3:01:20] cover many men see oh my remember is now
[3:01:25] right oh my god accept Christ's
[3:01:29] intellectual conception is all right but
[3:01:31] when remember when the eye looks upon it
[3:01:34] Oh will see an eye of God he said the
[3:01:37] devil used oh no he said your
[3:01:39] intellectual eyes sorry he said your
[3:01:40] intellectual eye when the devil uses
[3:01:42] your eye isn't in a Garden of Eden it
[3:01:44] proved that the devil chose the head of
[3:01:46] man to work in but God chooses his heart
[3:01:49] and the devil chooses him with his eyes
[3:01:51] so you cease your eyes to look upon
[3:01:54] something that's why when cats look
[3:01:56] around he saw plains of Jordan not
[3:02:00] Jordan rather but of Sodom and Gomorrah
[3:02:02] so that was wonderful
[3:02:04] oh and it was pleasant to look at he
[3:02:07] pitches tend towards them but when God
[3:02:09] spoke tell you about it said look not
[3:02:10] look West look salt all is yours I
[3:02:13] couldn't tell you that because they were
[3:02:15] closed up with Lawton he's they and
[3:02:17] their strife between you but as soon as
[3:02:19] he got out by yourself now I could speak
[3:02:21] to you no I could show you my promise
[3:02:23] and not lose his eyes and pitch his tent
[3:02:26] toward Sodom and then sooner or later
[3:02:30] you know he ended up in some hollow why
[3:02:32] because he uses eyes to look at the
[3:02:34] scene Sodom didn't take much work to
[3:02:36] cultivate it was already cultivated that
[3:02:39] land you just gone below who is you see
[3:02:43] sign up get a mortgage
[3:02:45] stock up start a new it look easy but
[3:02:49] the end thereof he didn't calculate it
[3:02:52] he didn't realize how much you would
[3:02:53] lose orange it's time to lose by that
[3:02:56] investment make the right investment
[3:02:59] today friends look to the Word of God
[3:03:01] don't look to intellect amen hallelujah
[3:03:05] oh my getting ready to close now
[3:03:08] position could come remember when the
[3:03:10] eye looks upon AWI what but it poop that
[3:03:13] the devil chose a head of man to working
[3:03:14] but God chooses his heart the devil
[3:03:18] shows him with his eyes something that
[3:03:19] he can see and he says well seeing is
[3:03:21] believing but when God comes to a man he
[3:03:25] comes to his heart and lets him believe
[3:03:27] things by his heart truth in that his
[3:03:31] eyes does not see but the scripture says
[3:03:34] faith is the substance of things hoped
[3:03:36] for the evidence of things not seen God
[3:03:40] working here sitting working here so
[3:03:43] what does these big schools and
[3:03:45] seminaries do anyhow it's sometimes not
[3:03:47] always but too many times it pulls from
[3:03:49] here up to here it ought to be taken
[3:03:52] from here down to here in a man's heart
[3:03:53] you see it stays up here and it doesn't
[3:03:56] go down here see he said you know the
[3:03:58] scripture says as a man thinketh in his
[3:03:59] heart so is he
[3:04:00] oh isn't that right a man the infidel
[3:04:05] the critic used to say how foolish God
[3:04:06] was to see that there was a mental
[3:04:08] faculties in a man's heart for there's
[3:04:10] nothing left to think with but he said
[3:04:12] about four years ago the Prophet said
[3:04:13] science found out that in the human
[3:04:16] heart there is a thinking faculty there
[3:04:19] is a little room a little place where
[3:04:22] there's not even a self a little
[3:04:24] compartment in a human heart it isn't
[3:04:27] the animal or no other life but in the
[3:04:29] human heart there's a little place that
[3:04:32] they could never come to a conclusion
[3:04:34] about what it was but finally they said
[3:04:36] this is a place where the soul dwells
[3:04:38] and so God does not speak his words
[3:04:41] right as a man thinketh his heart so is
[3:04:43] he not in his head if God would have
[3:04:46] meant that he would have said it but he
[3:04:48] said heart is now right skipping on down
[3:04:51] here now he said he said that's what he
[3:04:52] meant he said he never sent to shake
[3:04:54] hands he said he never said to join
[3:04:56] church is now right he said you must be
[3:04:59] born again and that from above a man you
[3:05:03] must be born again
[3:05:04] not put your name on a book but be
[3:05:07] regenerated and your soul changed your
[3:05:11] entire being made new again
[3:05:15] Oh Holly is now right that's what God
[3:05:18] deals with his now or spoken word he was
[3:05:21] no seed he said I'm from a little group
[3:05:23] of the seed of the word God presents a
[3:05:25] Christ our beloved brother a virgin a
[3:05:28] virgin of his word a man through them
[3:05:31] will be fulfill all that has been
[3:05:34] promised for this woman and a virgin who
[3:05:36] knows no man may creature dogmas but
[3:05:39] would have promised in himself like it
[3:05:40] wasn't Mary called himself that we just
[3:05:43] spoke about it may manifest he will act
[3:05:45] himself by his own would've promised so
[3:05:48] to fulfill that that has been written of
[3:05:50] him a mess not right and as he did when
[3:05:53] he came from that virgin womb
[3:05:55] isn't that right he says a little on
[3:05:57] down he said you know he said they will
[3:05:59] love him and they will love his and love
[3:06:02] his and they will be half his potentials
[3:06:04] for he is their head and they are his
[3:06:07] subjects oh we are subjects here this
[3:06:10] morning
[3:06:11] subjecting ourselves our every high
[3:06:13] thought into captivity
[3:06:15] oh isn't that right this morning man my
[3:06:18] subject to his head headship of Christ
[3:06:20] was his notice what harmony jesus never
[3:06:24] did anything until seen of the father or
[3:06:26] the father showed him first
[3:06:28] how many between God and Christ see
[3:06:30] Saint John 5:19 so will the bride so
[3:06:35] will you be this morning you're gonna be
[3:06:37] that same way harmony just as God has
[3:06:40] with Christ you will have with him we

[3:06:45] alright oh my she never doubts it a man
[3:06:48] hallo he shows that his word of life he
[3:06:50] shows her and she receives it she never

[3:07:09] great holy spirits to water that seed to
[3:07:12] bring it to life to make it live it'll
[3:07:16] raise it up again Eman the Prophet said
[3:07:18] I got a great big hallelujah here's the
[3:07:21] secrets the word is in the pride and the
[3:07:24] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[3:07:28] done with the word and she does it in
[3:07:32] his name she has just sayeth the Lord
[3:07:35] oh and a man arrives and then it's two
[3:07:39] more times so the holy sprit waters it
[3:07:41] until it's grown until it serves its
[3:07:44] purpose

[3:08:16] an organization start up in these last
[3:08:18] twenty years of this great revival he
[3:08:20] said its anointed prophet so knowing the
[3:08:21] teachers are so forth but why anything
[3:08:23] he said well there's nothing beyond the
[3:08:25] green sea it's back without an
[3:08:28] organization oh my he said a blind man
[3:08:30] can see it you could borrow his now you
[3:08:33] see that it cannot organize it's so
[3:08:35] firmly against it it's a grain of wheat

[3:08:54] there we come false impersonations of it
[3:08:55] in the last days that will almost
[3:08:57] deceive the elected if possible he said
[3:09:01] look at their organizational shocks
[3:09:03] pulling away now is that it only lets
[3:09:05] that only happens now but it lets the
[3:09:07] wheat to be known to the elected which
[3:09:10] is you here this morning which are part
[3:09:12] of it
