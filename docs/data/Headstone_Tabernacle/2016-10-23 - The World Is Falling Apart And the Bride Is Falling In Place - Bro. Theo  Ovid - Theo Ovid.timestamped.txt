[22:34] purpose behind
[22:36] that for a message of communion but
[22:38] brandom then God showed in Abraham what
[22:40] he would do for all Not only was the
[22:43] Blessed promise of the resurrection and
[22:44] eternal life given to Abraham but to his
[22:48] seed after him the elected of God Amen
[22:52] and be notice that Abraham out in the
[22:53] fields was adjourning his brother he
[22:55] called lot Israel his nephew at the time
[22:59] here we go at the time come for the
[23:02] testing oh yeah you're Christian you

[23:07] you're doing good you're trying to be
[23:09] evil but don't nobody and you're
[23:10] expecting everything to work fine but
[23:12] there's a Time come where it's called a
[23:14] time
[23:15] of testing say testing testing that time
[23:18] come to everyone a time of testing a
[23:22] church get tested homes get tested
[23:24] marriage get tested Health get tested a
[23:27] time of test
[23:29] things that you don't even can explain
[23:31] sometime the winds are contrary you
[23:33] didn't start it you didn't cause it but
[23:35] things are just contrary all around you
[23:37] that's a testing time it just comes you
[23:40] didn't set it you didn't start it you
[23:43] didn't arrange it it just comes that's
[23:46] the time of testing God expect a certain
[23:48] attitude of you when your time come and
[23:52] God looking on no babies God looking for
[23:54] men and women God looking for sons and
[23:57] daughters you're looking for Rascals he
[23:59] looking for scamps no he looking for
[24:01] real sons and daughters of God though he
[24:03] slay me yet I'll trust him that's who
[24:06] he's looking for that's the men of God
[24:08] is how he's looking for he looking for
[24:10] young men that wouldn't back down young
[24:12] men that will be a standard for Jesus a
[24:15] stand up for the Lord is that right
[24:18] let's continue now but in the time of
[24:21] testing lot
[24:24] weakened under the testing he's a
[24:28] perfect picture of the caral believer so
[24:31] it have spiritual believer and it have
[24:33] natural caral believer all the
[24:36] interested in house and food and car and
[24:38] pay and money and just natural people

[24:50] make sense being a canal believer being
[24:53] a natural person what is in it for me
[24:55] forget about that what's in it for the
[24:57] kingdom
[24:59] not for you it's about not about you

[25:20] will not count the money in your banking
[25:22] have will not count what will count is
[25:25] what you do for the kingdom and the
[25:27] kingdom is not in meat and drink but in
[25:31] power in the Holy Ghost come on now can

[35:12] whenever God speak it it can't get back
[35:16] empty and the reason I'm immune from the

[35:26] do with my inheritance that has been
[35:29] reserved for me since Glory you not hear

[1:28:35] manifest himself getting
[1:28:38] one that he can work through like this
[1:28:42] and say there is my spirit flowing
[1:28:45] freely Hallelujah not there is my
[1:28:48] Mysteries teaching

[1:28:59] know yes sir yes sir that the objective
[1:29:02] is to come to the spot where God could
[1:29:04] find not a group of ministers not the
[1:29:06] Min Association he's not using that one
[1:29:09] here one there one there that God can
[1:29:14] say there is my spirit
[1:29:18] flowing hallu when you begin to see that
[1:29:21] you begin to see the ministry of Jesus
[1:29:22] Christ because Jesus that virtue that's
[1:29:25] why the woman could re uh uh withdraw
[1:29:28] from him
[1:29:30] Hallelujah are you with me he had it in
[1:29:33] him but the BR might understand 8 ft
[1:29:36] from him and it is on deep call to the
[1:29:39] Deep you could feel the
[1:29:42] anointing am so when people came up to
[1:29:44] the prayer line and they came up they
[1:29:46] feel like a wall around the he said
[1:29:48] that's just his presence Hallelujah so
[1:29:50] when you're walking into him you're not
[1:29:52] just walking you're walking into a
[1:29:55] presence because God was veiled inside a
[1:29:58] de am a rainbow was around the throne
[1:30:00] amen Angels around there an atmosphere
[1:30:04] around there there is my spirit flowing
[1:30:08] freely so he would say he preaching he
[1:30:10] said you know what I'm waiting on I'm
[1:30:12] waiting on the angel of the Lord all of
[1:30:13] a sudden he say he is here now he is
[1:30:16] here means I have the authority now to
[1:30:18] take every Spirit under my control for
[1:30:20] the glory of God because I have backups
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:23] [Applause]
[1:30:26] I have Angelic beings working with me so
[1:30:29] I know not have a devil could move until
[1:30:30] I say so you don't hear what I'm saying
[1:30:34] so when he said I take every Spirit
[1:30:35] under my control for the glory of God he
[1:30:38] means that he have full authority to
[1:30:42] handle those
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:46] Devils he cast out one Spirit here and
[1:30:49] that Spirit upon this person asking for
[1:30:50] help from another another
[1:30:52] person amen
[1:30:56] then say all who have diabetes stand up
[1:30:58] because got a diabetic Spirit he's
[1:30:59] telling all them out one
[1:31:05] time Glory Spirits diabetic demons

[1:31:30] powers so you don't know what the man
[1:31:32] fighting behind the pulpit a real
[1:31:35] spiritual man a man under the spiritual
[1:31:37] warfare it is
[1:31:39] War people walking with demons but the
[1:31:43] Bible said in my
[1:31:48] [Applause]

[1:41:14] has to come from God and with that if I
[1:41:16] lead people off on the wrong part just
[1:41:19] because a certain group said that God
[1:41:21] will require me to pay for it at the day
[1:41:23] of judgment praise the name of the Lord
[1:41:26] so he can't do that isn't that right oh

[1:41:43] and that's the new birth Hallelujah and
[1:41:45] what are you going to do when you get
[1:41:47] all that group together where the
[1:41:49] Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and
[1:41:52] God expressed in it through his word by
[1:41:54] the same actions the same things he did
[1:41:58] making the word manifest if the church
[1:42:01] only knew its position it will one day
[1:42:05] then the Raptor will come Hallelujah if
[1:42:08] the church knew its position you have
[1:42:11] got to get into your position then the
[1:42:13] Rapture will come oh hallelujah praise

[1:42:27] are resting on that you said I preached
[1:42:28] every word that Paul preached million
[1:42:30] scream I'm resting on that now watch
[1:42:33] watch and that's the way I wanted to be
[1:42:36] when I crossed there I wanted to be that
[1:42:38] way just like that what Paul said don't
[1:42:41] want to add one thing to it don't want
[1:42:42] to take away from it just what the Bible
[1:42:44] said that's just the way I want to keep
[1:42:46] it going you see you people like that
[1:42:49] denomination on every side is going to
[1:42:50] raise up a barrier against it many times
[1:42:54] the Brethren think I'm against my
[1:42:55] brothers God knows different from that
[1:42:58] just as long as he knows what's truth I
[1:43:01] am not against Brethren listen carefully
[1:43:05] it's the system that is making us not to
[1:43:08] be brothers it isn't the word of God
[1:43:10] keeping us from being Brothers It's the
[1:43:12] system We join into that keeps us from
[1:43:16] being brothers that's right and that is
[1:43:18] where we stand oh blessed be the name of
[1:43:22] the Lord
[1:43:24] hallelujah praise God so gyrus had a
[1:43:26] need and he had a need because his only

[1:43:34] you what did the prophet okay no the
[1:43:37] daughter was dying right then he had to
[1:43:39] go then it was time for action it's time
[1:43:41] for Action Brethren it's not time to
[1:43:43] argue about whether we should be
[1:43:45] baptized face forward or backward or
[1:43:48] whether we should belong to this church
[1:43:50] or that church it's time for the Holy
[1:43:52] Spirit to come into the church and get
[1:43:55] in action it's later than you think the
[1:43:58] hour is here it's not time to F about
[1:44:01] Creeds and doctrines and things like
[1:44:03] that it's time to get God's spirit and
[1:44:07] move on because the atomic bombs are
[1:44:09] hanging the missiles are everywhere the
[1:44:12] spotniks is in the sky and everything
[1:44:14] that Jesus said would take place the end
[1:44:16] time is now taking place the Holy Ghost
[1:44:18] is here yes the critics are rising amen
[1:44:22] so they ought to be no argument there

[1:44:48] another reason why s hits This Book of
[1:44:49] Revelation he know that Jesus Christ is
[1:44:51] a chams yesterday today forever and he
[1:44:54] changes not he knows a whole lot more
[1:44:56] than 90% of the theologians he knows
[1:44:59] that since God is immutable in his
[1:45:01] nature he's also immutable in his ways
[1:45:04] does Satan know assuredly that the
[1:45:06] original church at Pentecost with the
[1:45:08] power of God In Action Mark 16 in action
[1:45:11] is the true church amen that Jesus
[1:45:13] claimed to be his own all else is false
[1:45:17] Christ in the true church is a
[1:45:20] continuation of the book of Acts amen
[1:45:22] but the book of Revelation shows that
[1:45:24] the Antichrist Spirit would come into
[1:45:26] the church and defile it what making it
[1:45:29] lukewarm formal and Powerless think
[1:45:32] about it now half-hearted praise
[1:45:34] half-hearted worship lukewarm formal
[1:45:37] powerless yet people going to
[1:45:41] church that is
[1:45:44] Satan Hallelujah are 15% say Amen but
[1:45:47] it's still
[1:45:48] Satan God say I rather you're hot or
[1:45:51] you're cold Luke 1 he spew out of his
[1:45:54] mouth so God can handle lukewarm you see
[1:45:56] lukewarm is in between if you're cold we
[1:45:58] know you're
[1:45:59] dead if you're hot you're on fire but
[1:46:02] lukewarm God can handle it so God want a
[1:46:05] people on fire for God you know why
[1:46:08] you're on fire god open your eyes God
[1:46:11] open your understanding praise God you
[1:46:13] know what is going to take place you
[1:46:15] know the bmbs is about to fall you want
[1:46:17] to have a bum shelter which is to be in
[1:46:20] Christ Jesus don't 10,000 fall on my

[1:46:32] me in the Cliff of the rock oh
[1:46:34] Hallelujah you want to be in that secret
[1:46:37] place oh glory to God listen to this
[1:46:40] listen to this he's making it lukewarm
[1:46:42] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[1:46:45] revealing his Works attempted
[1:46:46] destruction of God's people and discing
[1:46:49] of God's word right down to the time is
[1:46:50] cast in Lake of far he know know here we
[1:46:53] go if the people get the true revelation
[1:46:57] of the true church what she is what she
[1:47:00] stands for that she can do the Greater
[1:47:03] Works she will be an invincible Army if
[1:47:06] they get a true revelation of the two
[1:47:08] Spirits working in the framework of the
[1:47:10] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:47:12] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:47:14] spirit that Antichrist spirit is so
[1:47:16] close it will receive the very elect if
[1:47:18] possible that's why you have to be on
[1:47:20] the word because it's a razor ed between
