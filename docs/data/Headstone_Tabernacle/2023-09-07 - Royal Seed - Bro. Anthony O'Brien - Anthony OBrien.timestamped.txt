[32:35] Royal seed and my subject is the kingdom
[32:39] of heaven amen and my inspiration
[32:42] actually I got it from listen to
[32:44] brotherhood's message just almost
[32:47] exactly a month ago in August 6th amen
[32:51] and we're actions uh September uh six
[32:54] now
[32:55] it's exactly a month from now he
[32:56] preached this message uh seven steps to
[32:58] bring down the Capstone
[33:00] amen and um and that's where I got the
[33:02] inspiration for this from praise God
[33:04] because he was speaking and it just
[33:06] struck me praise God uh about something
[33:09] in the scripture and how he was bringing
[33:12] out that the return of the Capstone a
[33:14] headstone the Chief Cornerstone is
[33:16] coming back into its position coming
[33:19] back into its authority to sit upon the
[33:22] the body structure that he has built
[33:24] isn't that right age to age he keeps
[33:27] honing out an image and then he comes
[33:29] and sits at the head of it because he is
[33:32] Christ and Christ is ahead of his church
[33:34] and he said Upon This Rock I'll build my
[33:37] church and the gates of hell would never
[33:40] Prevail against it amen so it just got
[33:42] me all excited because I began to see
[33:45] that the King was coming back for his
[33:48] throne he was coming back for his
[33:50] Dominion here it was the world had been
[33:53] lost to the devil oh and All His angels
[33:55] and all his demonic forces but there is

[35:35] so what is it
[35:37] it's a royal seed
[35:39] so it speaks to our Royal bloodline
[35:42] isn't that right
[35:44] I know that it comes out of royalty
[35:46] comes out of a kingdom isn't that right
[35:48] and the kingdom has Kings
[35:50] and only the Kings they have a line of
[35:53] Kings which is the sons and their ears
[35:56] they are heirs to the throne and it's a
[35:58] Royal bloodline
[36:00] isn't that right if the king were to die
[36:02] then his sons would take over the
[36:05] kingdom isn't that right there's ears
[36:07] joint heirs with the king oh Hallelujah
[36:10] and God has a kingdom tonight and he
[36:12] also has ears showing ears with Christ
[36:15] that's who you are tonight you are not
[36:18] just anybody but you are royal seed
[36:21] cause
[36:23] and who we call he justified and who he
[36:27] justified he had already glorified what
[36:31] shall we then say to these things if God
[36:34] before us who can be against us tonight
[36:38] oh Hallelujah seed of God tonight
[36:42] pretestinated from before the foundation
[36:44] of the world to take this glorious stand
[36:47] for the gospel in 2023 God put something
[36:52] in your soul to stand against the Devils
[36:55] stand against the walls of the enemy
[36:57] standing in the darkness standing at the
[36:59] force of of evil signs against sickness
[37:02] oh I've seen you tonight oh he put it
[37:05] inside of you and what God put inside of
[37:08] you the devil cannot take it out of you
[37:10] no weapon formed against you shall
[37:14] prosper oh somebody say man oh
[37:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[37:20] Glory
[37:22] amen
[37:24] so we're talking about kingdoms
[37:26] powers
[37:27] rulers isn't that right a kingdom is a
[37:31] territory
[37:32] a kingdom is our domain
[37:34] isn't that right
[37:36] a kingdom talks about Dominion
[37:40] have the same rights praise God as a
[37:43] king as the rulers of that Kingdom isn't
[37:45] that right now the power to move they're
[37:47] the movers and shakers Hallelujah they
[37:49] can make decisions Holly isn't that
[37:51] right and that's how God had his son
[37:54] under him Adam when God created Adam and
[37:57] the Earth and everything he made him
[37:58] ruler over all the kingdoms of the earth
[38:01] of all the kingdoms of the animals of
[38:04] all the kingdoms of plant life animal
[38:05] life over the fish of the sea over the
[38:09] fall of the air and over every creeping
[38:11] thing that creeped upon the Earth God
[38:14] had a man in position on the urge to
[38:18] have dominion over everything that was
[38:21] upon the urge he could speak and it was
[38:24] so he could create and it would be just
[38:27] like Dutch because he had the same power
[38:30] that the father had and God's gonna have
[38:33] sons in these last days with the same
[38:36] kind of power same kind anointing that
[38:39] was upon Adam that was upon brother
[38:42] pranam God's gonna have sons and
[38:45] daughters with the same power oh
[38:48] somebody say Amen oh hallelujah oh I'm
[38:52] all fired up tonight glory to God
[38:54] hallelujah oh this makes me excited
[38:58] Holland do you see what God is restoring
[39:00] back he's restoring back your sonship oh
[39:03] the truth of Zion Oh Hallelujah are
[39:07] coming back into Purity and light once
[39:10] more the world will hear direct from God
[39:16] amen
[39:18] so a kingdom is a political territory
[39:21] unit
[39:22] ruled by a sovereign
[39:24] and the short story is this
[39:28] whenever there's a kingdom if there's
[39:30] two kingdoms at War
[39:32] what the other Kingdom will try to do is
[39:34] to to topple the other Kingdom
[39:37] in order to do that they have to remove
[39:39] the ruler that is there they have to get
[39:41] rid of the king they have to get rid of
[39:43] his ears because if they kill the king
[39:46] and he has an heir then the throne
[39:48] remains so the whole objective used to
[39:52] be to break the line of Kings so if the
[39:54] king ran out into war with his soldiers
[39:57] this presented an opportunity for the
[40:00] enemy to get at the king or but if he
[40:03] has an heir pray then he will also be
[40:05] able to thrown that they are trying to
[40:07] destroy so it's one kingdoms War
[40:10] infractions do you get it now no wonder
[40:13] the enemies attack praise God he
[40:15] attacked the word because he was trying
[40:17] to get to Adam he was trying to get to
[40:19] Eve they were the rulers of the world at
[40:22] that time when they were in the Garden
[40:24] of Eden everything was perfect
[40:26] everything was lovely and the devil saw
[40:28] that and he saw an opportunity to creep
[40:31] in and to destroy the kingdom that God
[40:34] had set up here on Earth oh that was the
[40:38] attack or he's always been after the Sun
[40:41] of God always went after the daughters
[40:44] of Zion Oh it's been after you but all
[40:47] King is Victorious tonight our King is
[40:50] triumphant tonight he knows no Retreats
[40:53] he knows no surrender we have a
[40:55] five-star general and his name is Jesus
[40:59] and he is here tonight to give you what
[41:03] you need to bring the battle over the
[41:05] enemy
[41:06] oh kill a lot of how to pray
[41:10] Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[41:14] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[41:17] amen
[41:19] amen
[41:20] so that's a paraphrase
[41:22] so now we see what Satan attack was
[41:25] it was after the sons of God
[41:27] because they have the ability to
[41:28] reproduce praise God God put something
[41:30] in there Adam was supposed to speak and
[41:33] more Sons were supposed to come out
[41:35] praise God but the devil tested that
[41:37] program
[41:38] isn't that right and introduce a
[41:41] different seed introduce our serpent
[41:43] seed and now we can trace that seed all
[41:45] the way down from Genesis all the way
[41:47] down to the Bible we can see that

[49:00] the devil said he had a head wrong I may
[49:03] not be able to see the Hedge but it was
[49:04] there
[49:06] yeah so you see he protects oh Jesus is
[49:10] a fence
[49:11] amen all around us every day amen you
[49:15] believe it praise God okay
[49:17] something I want to read here the
[49:19] prophet said to breach between the seven
[49:20] changes he said now when Adam's sin by
[49:23] heating his wife's reasoning instead of
[49:24] holding to God's word that's what made
[49:26] Adam sin his wife reasoned with Satan
[49:29] and then produced the product to Adam
[49:32] and Adam turn loose the word and sold
[49:35] out
[49:36] he lost also his inheritance when he
[49:40] lost his fellowship and right to life
[49:42] remember he said the day either of that
[49:45] day you die and when he lost his life he
[49:48] also lost his inheritance in life oh so
[49:53] I want you to get it amen's not right he
[49:55] did not only that didn't only die in
[49:56] that way
[49:57] but also his inheritance was lost praise
[50:00] God to write all things isn't that right
[50:02] not the father had given he lost that
[50:04] say God is God of the universe
[50:06] everywhere but his son had his this
[50:09] Earth under his control
[50:11] amen and that's the domain that he gave
[50:13] up when he sent in the garden even you
[50:15] get enough all right he said he could
[50:17] speak he could name he could see he
[50:19] could stop nature he could do anything
[50:21] he wanted to do see but when he did that
[50:23] the sin he lost his inheritance and now
[50:27] Adam could say let this mountain move
[50:28] over here and it would do Adam could say
[50:30] let this tree here be plucked up and
[50:32] planted it would do it see for he had
[50:34] complete Supreme control as I might not
[50:37] go under God or father because he was a
[50:40] son of God you see it
[50:43] was a e now could we stop here a minute
[50:45] and just get a real sermon see he said
[50:48] oh then if the blood he said no the
[50:50] prophet said then if the blood has
[50:52] cleansed it back then what about now
[50:56] see look what the Son of God the second
[50:58] Adam did see he said the work that I do
[51:01] shaliru also he said Adam lost his
[51:05] inheritance the Earth but now it passed
[51:07] from his hand on to the one he sold out
[51:09] to Satan he sold his faith to God soul
[51:13] is Faith to in God to Satan's reasonings
[51:15] and therefore his eternal life is right
[51:17] to the Tree of Life his right to the
[51:19] Earth belonged to him and he forfeited
[51:21] every every bit of it to the hands of
[51:23] Satan he passed it from his hand to
[51:26] Satan so you see Satan is controlling
[51:28] all over this world this Kingdom over
[51:30] here
[51:31] it's not right he told Jesus when he's
[51:33] up on the mount exceedingly great mount
[51:34] isn't that right and he told Jesus said
[51:36] to you I am rule over all these things
[51:38] all of these kingdoms of the world let's
[51:40] not run he said therefore now he said it
[51:43] had been uh and it returned see and he
[51:46] had been polluted and the seed of Adam
[51:48] was destroyed the inheritance that Adam
[51:51] should have had that's the Earth that's
[51:53] right he said the Sea of the seed of
[51:55] Adam and when wars were fought uh him
[51:57] it's not right okay all right
[52:00] here now
[52:02] so
[52:04] so we see the world is once again once
[52:05] governed by the spirit of God isn't I
[52:08] and sin came into the picture
[52:10] and then the world ended up in captivity
[52:12] to the devil but Satan just but God
[52:15] promised to restore his kingdom
[52:18] isn't that right Psalms 149 verse 1 says
[52:22] praise he the law sing unto the Lord a
[52:25] new song and his praise in the
[52:27] congregation of the Saints let Israel
