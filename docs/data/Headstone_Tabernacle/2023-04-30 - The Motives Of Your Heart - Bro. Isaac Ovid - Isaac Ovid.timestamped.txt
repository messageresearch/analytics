[48:07] of the way may you encourage your church
[48:10] we thank you this morning may you bless
[48:12] the reading of the word and the opening
[48:14] of our understanding to it and the
[48:16] precious name of Jesus Christ and the
[48:18] church says
[48:19] amen any man he may be seated for a few
[48:22] minutes
[48:23] certainly a great privilege
[48:25] to be in the house of the Lord this
[48:28] morning
[48:28] uh you're happy to be in the house of
[48:30] the lawn
[48:32] you know the psalmist David said I was
[48:34] glad
[48:35] when they said unto me letters go into
[48:37] the house of the Lord it's a good thing
[48:40] it's a choice to be in the house of the
[48:42] Lord It's a decision to be in the house
[48:44] of the Lord and it's nothing we ever
[48:46] want to take for granted it's nothing we
[48:48] ever want to take it as just something
[48:49] to do but it's a great privilege and an
[48:52] honor and I salute you for being here
[48:55] this morning we live in perilous times
[48:58] we live in dangerous times we live in
[49:01] times when men's hearts are feeling for
[49:04] fear and the love of many have waxed
[49:07] cold
[49:08] cold because of the cares of the world
[49:11] cool because of different issues in life
[49:13] and they lose focus of why we are born
[49:16] and what we are here to do and what we
[49:18] are here to achieve but we thank God
[49:20] this morning that we uh have a
[49:22] revelation of who we are and whose we
[49:25] are and we have a clear sight of where
[49:28] we want to go and even if we are
[49:29] struggling we are identifying that we
[49:32] are on the journey and nothing is going
[49:34] to take us off of that Journey we might
[49:36] have our ups and our downs but we are
[49:38] pressing on
[49:40] we might fall down sometimes but we are
[49:42] quick to get back up
[49:44] and we are reporting for Duty in the
[49:46] army of the Lord with our souls with our
[49:49] Shields with our breastplates with our
[49:51] with our with our everything we may not
[49:54] win every battle but we know we're gonna
[49:55] win the war
[49:57] because he already settled the war for
[49:59] us we have confidence that we are more
[50:00] than conquerors more than conquerors not
[50:03] just conquerors but more than conquerors
[50:05] so when we come into the house of God we
[50:07] come with a revelation that we are more
[50:09] than conquerors and no demon no devil no
[50:13] sickness no depression no bill no
[50:15] problem no instance no situation the
[50:18] Bible said nothing pass nothing present
[50:20] nothing to come is gonna separate us
[50:22] from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[50:24] Hallelujah is the reason we woke up this
[50:27] morning is the reason we sing it's the
[50:29] reason we worship halleluia can the
[50:31] Church Say Amen
[50:33] so I'm under great expectation for what
[50:35] God is going to do and before I get it
[50:37] in a message I came across this Psalm
[50:41] this week and I thought I just it
[50:43] encouraged me and I want to encourage
[50:44] you before we get into the message it
[50:46] may be a familiar scripture to you but
[50:49] I don't know who this is for but it
[50:51] blessed me this week so I trust is going
[50:53] to bless you
[50:54] so if they could help me with Psalms 37
[50:58] and the Bible says here fret not thyself
[51:02] because of evildoers
[51:04] we have too many Believers threatened
[51:08] so if there's a little bible study this
[51:10] morning is fret not thyself
[51:13] because of evildoers
[51:15] in the Amplified it says do not worry
[51:17] because of evildoers neither be envious
[51:20] against the workers of iniquity
[51:23] for they shall soon be cut down like the
[51:25] grass and wither as the green herb
[51:27] there's so much going around and it's
[51:29] easy to get agitated easy to get
[51:31] stressed easy to get overwhelmed the
[51:33] crime situation this happening and
[51:35] you're living in fear and you're doing
[51:37] this I'm not saying don't be sensitive
[51:38] to what's happening but as Believers we
[51:41] fret not ourselves this is not consuming
[51:43] our every energy
[51:45] it's not consuming our thoughts
[51:47] trust in the Lord and do good
[51:51] that's the instruction so this scripture
[51:53] here is an encouragement with
[51:54] instructions trust in the Lord and do
[51:57] good
[51:57] Hallelujah so shall thou dwell in the
[52:00] land and verily though shall be fed
[52:03] Delight thyself also in the Lord is
[52:06] anybody who is delighting themselves the
[52:09] Lord is your Delight you're just happy
[52:11] when you talk about him you're happy
[52:13] when you're in his presence here when
[52:15] you hear about your lord you feel good
[52:17] when you see somebody blessed you'll
[52:19] feel good all of that is
[52:24] delighting yourself in the Lord is a
[52:26] delight it's a joy it's an excitement to
[52:30] know that the Lord is good to know that
[52:32] he put food on your table whether it's
[52:34] cricks or bread or a beagle it doesn't
[52:36] matter he put food on your table he said
[52:39] I never see my righteous forsaken us oh
[52:42] come on now anybody helped me this
[52:44] morning
[52:45] Delight thyself also in the Lord and the
[52:48] Bible said when you do that and he shall
[52:51] give Thee the desires of thine heart so
[52:53] the desires of thine heart is actually
[52:55] title a delight oh you don't hear me
[52:58] this morning just being excited about
[53:00] the Lord yes in the light of the Lord is
[53:03] connected to the things you're trying to
[53:05] get them you're working to get and
[53:07] you're doing it grudging on you you're
[53:09] stressing and you're straining God is
[53:11] saying just give thanks just be
[53:13] delightful come to church positive don't
[53:16] walk around with a frown put a smile on
[53:18] your face when somebody asks you why
[53:20] you're happy in my delight is in the
[53:22] Lord when somebody say why you why are
[53:24] you moving someone you have a flat tire
[53:26] my delight is in the Lord don't you have
[53:29] 15 reasons to be sad My Delight is in
[53:32] the
[53:33] that's only 22 percent my delight is in
[53:36] the
[53:38] it goes on
[53:40] commit thy way unto the Lord
[53:43] some of us trying to control our way we
[53:46] want to be in charge of our way we want
[53:48] to do good in our way
[53:50] but the Bible says commit thy way unto
[53:52] the Lord trust also in him and he shall
[53:56] bring it to pass and he shall bring
[53:58] forth listen he shall bring forth thy
[54:01] righteousness as the light and thy
[54:04] judgment as the Noonday he has taken
[54:06] responsibility for the manifestation of
[54:09] your righteousness and he has taken his
[54:11] place as your judge and he is also your
[54:14] lawyer so he say don't worry I'm your
[54:17] judge and your lawyer your judgment I'm
[54:19] going to take control of your judgment
[54:20] nobody has the right to sentence you
[54:23] because I am your judge

[55:04] rest he could sleep and wake up tired
[55:06] because you didn't get rest but if you
[55:08] rest in the Lord
[55:10] and wait patiently for him
[55:12] fret not thyself because of him who
[55:14] prospered in his way because of the man
[55:17] who bringeth Wicked devices to pass some

[59:23] writer plead last Wednesday and remember
[59:25] last Sunday I don't know what to say
[59:27] that was that a tremendous tremendous
[59:30] blessing I appreciate the message last
[59:31] Sunday
[59:34] and I can just keep going back and going
[59:36] back and but every serve is such a
[59:39] mighty time in the Lord So reading
[59:41] Ezekiel 36
[59:43] or familiar scripture Ezekiel 36 and
[59:45] reading verse 22 therefore say unto the
[59:48] house of Israel thus saith the Lord God
[59:52] I do not this for your sakes
[59:56] in other words the action I'm about to
[59:58] take is not just because of you
[1:00:01] or House of Israel
[1:00:03] but for mine holy namesake
[1:00:06] in other words the action I'm taking is
[1:00:08] because of me not even because of you
[1:00:11] because my name is important to me my
[1:00:13] promises are important to me my word is
[1:00:16] important to me and my declaration
[1:00:18] concerning my people is so important to
[1:00:20] me that even though my people fall down
[1:00:22] I have to do certain things because I
[1:00:24] said it
[1:00:25] and because I chose you and because I
[1:00:28] predestinated you let's go but for mine
[1:00:30] Holy Name six which you have profaned
[1:00:33] Among the Hidden whether he went in
[1:00:36] other words you have lived among the
[1:00:38] Heathen and you have brought shame to my
[1:00:41] name
[1:00:43] but I'm still doing something because my
[1:00:46] name is important to me and not because
[1:00:49] you went to your job or you went to your
[1:00:50] family and you do something that caused
[1:00:53] a reproach against my name doesn't stop
[1:00:55] me from taking action to change course
[1:00:59] verse 23 and I will sanctify my great
[1:01:02] name
[1:01:04] because my name will be clean my name
[1:01:07] will be pure my name will be recognized
[1:01:10] there will come a time that every knee
[1:01:11] will bow and every tongue will confess
[1:01:13] that by this name anybody with me this
[1:01:15] morning and I will sanctify my great
[1:01:18] name which was profaned Among The Hidden
[1:01:22] which ye
[1:01:24] he's speaking to Israel now have profane
[1:01:26] in the midst of them in other words your
[1:01:29] actions your words your deity speaking
[1:01:31] to Israel have bought hurt
[1:01:33] to the cause
[1:01:36] and the Heathen shall know that I am the
[1:01:39] Lord sayeth the Lord God when I shall be
[1:01:43] Sanctified in you
[1:01:46] so the same vessels that were used to
[1:01:49] cause profane he say I'm gonna sanctify
[1:01:53] in you before their eyes
[1:01:56] so the same world that see you one way
[1:01:59] will start to see you another way and
[1:02:01] it'll be my doing not by might nor my
[1:02:04] power but I am going to live in you can
[1:02:06] the church say Amen can we go on a
[1:02:08] little bit
[1:02:09] for I will take you from among the
[1:02:12] heathen
[1:02:13] and gather you out of all countries
[1:02:16] and will bring you into your own land
[1:02:19] then will I sprinkle clean water upon
[1:02:22] you and ye shall be clean from all your
[1:02:25] filthiness and from all your Idols will
[1:02:29] I cleanse you oh for sprinkling this
[1:02:32] morning of clean water
[1:02:35] clean water this morning so that all the
[1:02:38] filthiness of yesterday and the
[1:02:40] filthiness of last week and the
[1:02:42] filthiness of our thoughts and our
[1:02:44] emotions and actions
[1:02:46] verse 26
[1:02:48] a new heart also will I give you
[1:02:52] Hallelujah
[1:02:53] and a new spirit will I put within you
[1:02:57] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[1:03:00] of your flesh and I will give you a
[1:03:03] heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit
[1:03:07] within you
[1:03:08] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:03:13] ye shall keep my judgments and do them
[1:03:16] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:03:18] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:03:20] this morning in the presence of the Lord
[1:03:24] Hallelujah
[1:03:27] a time of cleaning a time of
[1:03:30] purification a time of change a time of
[1:03:34] transformation
[1:03:35] Hallelujah and we have a promise that he
[1:03:37] will do it there's something that he's
[1:03:39] going to do there's something that we
[1:03:41] have to do but the thing that he
[1:03:43] promised to do oh and I'm so thankful
[1:03:45] that we can depend on God to do what he
[1:03:47] said he would do Hallelujah let me ask
[1:03:50] somebody to help you do something and it
[1:03:51] doesn't work about when you come to God
[1:03:53] and it promises when he says he's going
[1:03:55] to do something he's going to do
[1:03:55] something and he said he's going to
[1:03:57] clean us he said he's going to sprinkle
[1:03:59] clean water upon you Hallelujah if you
[1:04:02] came in this morning and you have what
[1:04:03] kind of dirt and cross on you oh thank
[1:04:06] God for some clean water this morning
[1:04:08] some clean water of the world to wash us
[1:04:10] to cleanse our stuff to give your soul
[1:04:12] in the presence of the Lord that he
[1:04:14] could walk out of this service today
[1:04:15] clean Hallelujah nothing against you
[1:04:18] nothing upon you nothing hindering you
[1:04:20] nothing holding you back nothing keeping
[1:04:22] you back from the promise nothing
[1:04:23] keeping you back from worship you know
[1:04:25] that's what hinders are worship for a
[1:04:26] lot of people it's the weight of life
[1:04:28] and and issues and stuff but if the
[1:04:30] clean water could just fall upon you and
[1:04:32] you can know that he is the purifier
[1:04:34] that you could do so much but when the
[1:04:36] purification of God comes when the Holy
[1:04:39] Ghost comes when the rain comes when the
[1:04:41] showers come oh what a joy what a peace
[1:04:44] what a satisfaction whether a Blessed
[1:04:46] Assurance what a delight Hallelujah
[1:04:50] so I have a title this morning the
[1:04:53] motives
[1:04:55] of your heart
[1:04:57] I want to speak about your heart this
[1:04:59] morning and a subject a new heart a new
[1:05:02] spirit and his spirit
[1:05:05] and an inspiration
[1:05:07] resolving the conflict
[1:05:09] between the mind
[1:05:12] and the Heart
[1:05:13] resolving the conflict
[1:05:16] between the mind
[1:05:18] and the Heart
[1:05:19] and this is a deep topic a deep subject
[1:05:22] because it's interesting but Ovid was
[1:05:25] preaching last week and I was sharing
[1:05:27] with him as he was speaking all I was
[1:05:29] seeing was is the issues of the heart
[1:05:33] the Bible said as a man think in his
[1:05:35] heart
[1:05:36] so he is
[1:05:38] and I want to actually read that shortly
[1:05:40] so we could see even the context of that
[1:05:42] verse so we can understand what we're
[1:05:44] dealing with
[1:05:45] but the reality is that prodigal son
[1:05:48] left his house based on what was in his
[1:05:51] heart
[1:05:53] the issue with the older brother when he
[1:05:55] came home was the issue that was in his
[1:05:58] heart
[1:06:00] and as you begin to think about this and
[1:06:02] think about that scripture as a man
[1:06:03] think in his heart it makes a
[1:06:06] distinction between what is in your
[1:06:08] heart and what is in your head
[1:06:11] because our head controls a lot of our
[1:06:13] actions
[1:06:15] but eventually
[1:06:17] what is in your heart will come out
[1:06:18] that's why the Bible says as a man think
[1:06:20] in his heart that's who he really is
[1:06:23] so in other words you could hear
[1:06:25] something about somebody
[1:06:27] you could think you know something on
[1:06:29] somebody in your heart but if in your
[1:06:31] heart you'd already like them
[1:06:33] even if you hear something positive
[1:06:35] about it
[1:06:36] you will still respond you can respond
[1:06:39] nice to know God bless you so that they
[1:06:40] see you and that's on an intellectual
[1:06:42] level but in your heart you see in word
[1:06:44] Israel is just a piece of work
[1:06:47] because in your heart you have a
[1:06:49] different thought a different picture a
[1:06:51] different understanding of that person
[1:06:54] so when you start to look at it deeper
[1:06:55] now you see fear come by hearing and
[1:06:57] hear any word that word is being heard
[1:06:59] intellectually but everyone speak about
[1:07:01] mentally
[1:07:03] and first we catch mental faith
[1:07:05] but until that mental Faith becomes
[1:07:08] spiritual fate it still stays here and
[1:07:11] this is where the great battle is fought
[1:07:13] so many Believers when you understand
[1:07:15] why somebody backslide many times
[1:07:18] because they never had it in their heart
[1:07:20] you know
[1:07:22] it was a head understanding all along
[1:07:24] because if it is in your heart nothing
[1:07:26] could really shake your heart
[1:07:30] so I'll share it with my wife the other
[1:07:33] day my daughter wants to carry a toy to
[1:07:34] school
[1:07:36] we say no you're not carrying it you're
[1:07:38] not carrying it because when you carry
[1:07:39] it you're not sure you're coming back
[1:07:42] when the evening came she bringing it
[1:07:44] toy back
[1:07:47] bringing it back
[1:07:49] so all they talk about don't carry
[1:07:51] towards all intellectual enough she here
[1:07:53] she processed it she analyzed it but she
[1:07:55] stuffed the toy in her bag because it
[1:07:57] was in her heart
[1:08:03] and he began to realize and I want to
[1:08:05] drill down a little bit into this thing
[1:08:06] here now we're gonna get somewhere
[1:08:07] because we're going to get a new heart a
[1:08:10] new spirit and his Spirit but I want to
[1:08:12] address this issue because there's this
[1:08:14] conflict
[1:08:15] that exists between the mind and the
[1:08:17] heart that if you don't understand it
[1:08:18] you wouldn't understand why you go
[1:08:20] through what you go through
[1:08:23] when you tell a child to study your
[1:08:25] school work they can pass the exam
[1:08:28] it is not that they don't understand
[1:08:29] that intellectuality
[1:08:33] but in the heart it will resonate
[1:08:36] it is also the reason why people Succeed
[1:08:38] in Business and in life without all the
[1:08:41] intellectual because it's in their heart
[1:08:42] to achieve
[1:08:44] they may lack the intellectual knowledge
[1:08:46] to do it they may like the schooling to
[1:08:48] do at the University to agree to do it
[1:08:50] but in the heart nothing can change you
[1:08:52] tell them you can't make it what's
[1:08:54] driving them is the heart
[1:08:58] so this issue of resolving conflict is a
[1:09:01] good and a bad thing
[1:09:03] because when there's a real when when
[1:09:05] you begin to water the seed the word
[1:09:07] seed in your soul
[1:09:09] that also begins to create a conflict
[1:09:11] between your heart and your soul and
[1:09:12] your mind you know
[1:09:13] because the real believer
[1:09:17] is the word in you you know
[1:09:20] so there's always going to be this war
[1:09:22] between your mind and your heart
[1:09:24] but if you could ever get your mind and
[1:09:26] your heart to align
[1:09:29] if you shall see to this mountain we
[1:09:31] move and don't doubt in your
[1:09:34] in other words if you get your mind and
[1:09:36] your heart in alignment then things
[1:09:38] begin to move
[1:09:40] so if you came to chill this morning
[1:09:42] because you decided to come but your
[1:09:44] heart not really here you're not getting
[1:09:45] anything
[1:09:49] could we drive a little bit so it's done
[1:09:51] to your motives I'll come to church
[1:09:52] because I want them to think any no
[1:09:54] that's all here you know you already
[1:09:55] come because you're one God
[1:09:59] but if you come and you're made up your
[1:10:01] mind to come this morning but in your
[1:10:02] heart you really want to change then
[1:10:05] when there's an alignment no you're
[1:10:07] processed you will a certain way and
[1:10:09] when he would come to you it could keep
[1:10:10] dropping from mental Faith to spiritual
[1:10:12] Faith you receive it to me you hear it
[1:10:15] you're process it and you receive it
[1:10:17] wholeheartedly in your heart
[1:10:19] but if in your heart you can't take this
[1:10:22] brother is that Christian this morning
[1:10:23] boy
[1:10:26] then your dial only filter or your turn
[1:10:28] on the filter whichever way is process
[1:10:30] it so now you're filled in so because
[1:10:32] your heart have an issue yeah
[1:10:39] anybody with me this morning
[1:10:42] that's what everybody say guard your
[1:10:43] heart because out of your heart become
[1:10:45] all the issues of life
[1:10:47] notice a real thing and people and and a
[1:10:50] good example is speaking I just sharing
[1:10:52] something with you before we get into
[1:10:53] your service right that older brother
[1:10:55] last week
[1:10:56] didn't know what was in his heart until
[1:10:59] younger brother came home
[1:11:03] so God sent a work in a situation in
[1:11:05] your life
[1:11:07] to expose what is in your heart because
[1:11:10] you could think one thing mentally you
[1:11:12] could think you know how you will behave
[1:11:14] you could think you understand how to
[1:11:16] deal with something until something
[1:11:18] comes your way and then what is in your
[1:11:20] heart
[1:11:21] begin to reveal itself anybody with me
[1:11:23] can somebody say Amen this morning
[1:11:26] [Applause]
[1:11:32] so we're speaking about motives
[1:11:35] you're speaking about your heart
[1:11:37] we speaking about why some people
[1:11:39] struggle to live a holy life
[1:11:41] because your mind and what you process
[1:11:43] intellectual is a doorway to your soul
[1:11:46] is a gateway so you feed in yourself
[1:11:49] with movies and certain music and
[1:11:51] certain conversations you actually could
[1:11:54] be expanding that conflict because if
[1:11:56] there's a seed in your soul that desires
[1:11:58] the truth and desired Holiness and
[1:12:01] desires the Holy Ghost but you are not
[1:12:03] feeling it and aligning these things
[1:12:05] together then you will never you'll
[1:12:07] never overcome and you'll always be in a
[1:12:08] frustrated conflict that's why I say to
[1:12:11] young people you can never enjoy the
[1:12:12] world
[1:12:14] you could never enjoyed the world
[1:12:15] because this seed in your soul is always
[1:12:17] in conflict with your intellectual
[1:12:19] conception with life you're trying to
[1:12:20] live out there
[1:12:22] you will never be happy because you are
[1:12:24] designed differently you are built
[1:12:26] differently can the church say Amen so
[1:12:29] what we are fighting for is an alignment
[1:12:31] of what is in your mind and in your
[1:12:33] heart and every service this word is
[1:12:35] coming to feed your soul and if you
[1:12:37] receive it inwardly I let it drop down
[1:12:39] and say yes that's mine even though you
[1:12:41] don't understand it so we say yes you're
[1:12:42] going to get the Holy Ghost yes they're
[1:12:44] going to get and you believe it
[1:12:45] and that seed started Rejoice is that
[1:12:48] again you're gonna overcome I'm gonna
[1:12:50] clean you your house is going to be
[1:12:52] delivered your farm is going to change
[1:12:54] you can live above sin
[1:12:58] a man can live in such way but a man who
[1:13:00] said that the devil don't know what to
[1:13:01] do with him
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:05] let the weak say I'm strong
[1:13:12] that itself is a leap of your mind and
[1:13:15] your heart so let's go on
[1:13:18] I would have read this sometime before
[1:13:19] but I want you to understand this within
[1:13:21] the context of this issue of the heart
[1:13:24] behind every action there's a motive and
[1:13:27] motivation
[1:13:30] let me read it first here in in Proverbs
[1:13:33] 23
[1:13:38] and I want to let me get it quickly in
[1:13:40] the Amplified as well
[1:13:47] when those sitters to eat with a ruler
[1:13:51] considered diligently what is before
[1:13:53] thee
[1:13:55] and put a knife to thy throat
[1:13:59] if there will be a man given to appetite
[1:14:03] any Amplified when you sit down to die
[1:14:06] with a ruler consider carefully what is
[1:14:08] set before you
[1:14:10] for you will put a knife to your throat
[1:14:11] if you are a man of great appetite
[1:14:14] verse 3 be not desirous of his deities
[1:14:21] for they are deceitful meat
[1:14:24] we're building something description of
[1:14:26] the reference Allah but I want you to
[1:14:27] see the context it says here do not
[1:14:29] desire his Delicacies
[1:14:31] for it is deceptive food
[1:14:34] offered to you with questionable motives
[1:14:41] and then it goes into verse four I don't
[1:14:43] know who this is for but labor not to be
[1:14:46] rich
[1:14:49] cease from thine own wisdom
[1:14:52] in the Amplified do not worry yourself
[1:14:55] with the overwhelming desire to gain
[1:14:58] wealth
[1:14:59] cease from your own understanding of it
[1:15:04] verse 5.
[1:15:06] well thou set thine eyes upon that which
[1:15:08] is not
[1:15:10] for riches certainly make themselves
[1:15:12] wings
[1:15:15] they fly away as an eagle to what heaven
[1:15:19] in the Amplified when you set your eyes
[1:15:22] on wealth it is suddenly gone
[1:15:25] for wealth certainly makes itself wings
[1:15:27] like an eagle that flies into heaven
[1:15:35] verse 6 eat thou not the bread of him
[1:15:38] that hath an evil eye
[1:15:41] neither desire thou his deity meets
[1:15:44] in other words in the Amplified do not
[1:15:47] eat the bread of a selfish man
[1:15:50] or desire his Delicacies
[1:15:53] and this is where we get that verse for
[1:15:55] as he thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:15:59] verse 7 for as he thinks in his heart so
[1:16:03] is he in Behavior one who manipulates
[1:16:10] eat and drink see it he to thee but his
[1:16:13] heart is not with thee
[1:16:18] for he thinks in his heart so he says
[1:16:20] eat and drink yet his heart is not with
[1:16:22] you but it is begrudging the cost
[1:16:30] no no
[1:16:33] he giving food but he's saying how much
[1:16:34] his thing costs
[1:16:36] because he already want to give you
[1:16:38] but it's showing here because we use
[1:16:41] this scripture a lot as a man thinking
[1:16:43] his heart to his Heath but I want you to
[1:16:45] see the thinking in his heart back is
[1:16:47] really about emotive
[1:16:49] his desire and I want us to look deeper
[1:16:53] because everything that is affected in
[1:16:55] our lives is driven by what's in our
[1:16:57] heart
[1:17:00] conflicts
[1:17:01] people working people doing this when
[1:17:03] and they've been driven by motives that
[1:17:05] is not in alignment with what God wants
[1:17:08] for you
[1:17:10] I am not saying it is the word saying it
[1:17:13] behind every action is a more to be and
[1:17:15] every word is a motive
[1:17:17] what is your motive to is it in Courage
[1:17:19] is it is it to be a better Christian is
[1:17:21] it a serve God is it to live this
[1:17:23] message is it to be pure is it to be
[1:17:25] truthful it's to be holy
[1:17:28] motive is the reason why so I mean so
[1:17:31] many motive of your heart
[1:17:33] the reason why
[1:17:38] the action may be good but the motive
[1:17:40] could be wrong
[1:17:42] so we see somebody here giving food but
[1:17:45] the motive is whatever it is and in the
[1:17:47] heart they already want to feed you
[1:17:51] do we really have true motives
[1:17:54] or is it we need a sprinkling of water
[1:17:57] Upon Our Hearts
[1:17:58] no wonder because he realizes they say
[1:18:00] your heart could get corrupted
[1:18:03] that's why these psalmist David can say
[1:18:05] create in me uh
[1:18:10] you see where it begins to connect now
[1:18:12] so David was looking at himself and he
[1:18:15] said wait a minute there's some issues
[1:18:16] in my heart
[1:18:19] when somebody can't take a record from
[1:18:20] the world that is not intellectual they
[1:18:22] could hear they can always write you
[1:18:23] know but you feel aware about that
[1:18:24] feeling is an intellectual think about
[1:18:26] it
[1:18:27] the pastor correction somebody says
[1:18:29] something to you or say that is wrong
[1:18:30] you should not do it
[1:18:33] 99.99 of the times you know what was
[1:18:36] said is correct you know but I feel
[1:18:39] better here and then he said the finals
[1:18:40] I like how he tell me that's not
[1:18:42] intellectual
[1:18:44] that is the heart
[1:18:46] jealousy is not an intellectual thing
[1:18:48] friends it's a heart
[1:18:51] Envy is that intellectual it's a hard
[1:18:54] matter lust is that intellectual it's a
[1:18:57] hard matter
[1:19:01] we have an agreement that the mind is a
[1:19:04] Battleground
[1:19:06] it's fear game for battle they ask the
[1:19:08] prophet what to do
[1:19:11] and yet a white dog or he says a fight
[1:19:15] is wet on your feet you you know that
[1:19:17] right so we understand that the mind is
[1:19:21] a Battleground we're not dealing with
[1:19:23] the Mind here this morning we're dealing
[1:19:25] with what you allow into your heart
[1:19:30] so many Bible says receive not an
[1:19:33] accusation against an elder that's not
[1:19:34] an intellectual you know
[1:19:36] who
[1:19:37] that's receive in your heart
[1:19:41] because your mind is not a really a
[1:19:43] reception that sin is a processor
[1:19:46] it is taking inputs from around you and
[1:19:48] making a determination about your
[1:19:50] character and your nature because who
[1:19:52] you are is not your intellect that
[1:19:54] breaks up into pieces but who you are is
[1:19:57] what's in your heart
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:19:59] that's your nature that's your being
[1:20:02] that's your character
[1:20:08] so we are contending for the motive and
[1:20:11] even Paul say people preach and they
[1:20:13] came to Paul we read this scripture
[1:20:15] before
[1:20:16] in Philippians 1.
[1:20:19] are you riding with me this morning
[1:20:21] I'm gonna come I'm going to come into
[1:20:22] your house just now don't worry
[1:20:24] let's Circle and let's land in
[1:20:27] Philippians they brought an issue here
[1:20:28] Paul is writing Paul and timothyus the
[1:20:31] Servants of Jesus Christ this is
[1:20:32] Philippians 1 1 to all the sins in
[1:20:35] Christ Jesus
[1:20:36] with the Bishops and the deacons so he's
[1:20:39] writing to the entire church Grace be
[1:20:41] unto you and peace from God our Father
[1:20:44] and from our Lord Jesus Christ I thank
[1:20:46] my God upon every remembrance of you I
[1:20:49] love scriptures like this do you thank
[1:20:52] God every time you remember these Saints
[1:20:54] oh I love these scenes I just so happy
[1:20:56] about this saying that thank God that
[1:20:58] I'm part of the body of Believers and
[1:21:00] these Saints who are on this journey
[1:21:01] with me I know I'm not the only one
[1:21:03] struggling but we're all struggling
[1:21:05] together but I thank God I'm not alone
[1:21:06] because he didn't just call me there are
[1:21:08] others who are called also and there are
[1:21:10] others who are part of tasty Harvest is
[1:21:12] plentiful Deliver us are few but for the
[1:21:15] few laborers we have an opinion we are
[1:21:17] fighting with Aviation Ground God I
[1:21:19] thank you I thank you for the pastor I
[1:21:22] thank you for the ministers I thank you
[1:21:23] for the Deacons
[1:21:25] I can't give a sister their sister this
[1:21:28] but it is
[1:21:29] that's Paul he said I thank my God upon
[1:21:32] every remembrance of you always in every
[1:21:35] prayer of mind for you all making
[1:21:37] requests for joy
[1:21:38] for your fellowship in the gospel from
[1:21:41] the first day until now
[1:21:43] being confident of this very thing that
[1:21:45] he which have begun a good work in you
[1:21:48] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:21:51] Christ so God is still working on us and
[1:21:54] Paul is saying I'm confident and we are
[1:21:56] confident this morning that he who
[1:21:58] started his journey with you is more
[1:22:00] than able to bring it to pass he
[1:22:03] promised to never leave you he promised
[1:22:05] and never forsake you he promised to be
[1:22:07] with you even in you he promised you a
[1:22:10] new heart he promised you a new spirit
[1:22:12] he promised you his spirit
[1:22:20] listen to Paul making now that
[1:22:22] distinction here and I want to say begin
[1:22:24] to become more sensitive because it
[1:22:26] supplies on your job it applies in your
[1:22:29] school there are people on your job who
[1:22:31] Intel you're here and I'm talking nice
[1:22:33] and then here somebody say well you know
[1:22:34] behind me back they really say and so on
[1:22:36] so because what they said to you was in
[1:22:37] their mind
[1:22:38] they prepared it was a PPN speech
[1:22:42] but when you're not there what in the
[1:22:44] heart really show up but I like that I
[1:22:46] like him and he both think I like him I
[1:22:48] like him and he's your heart
[1:22:51] you understand how much your brain is a
[1:22:53] filter
[1:22:54] you look at a child
[1:22:57] my daughter said something about me this
[1:22:59] morning I can't repeat
[1:23:02] and it's because you have a filter
[1:23:06] she's trying to say I looking big
[1:23:09] but she didn't quite say it like that
[1:23:21] how she could tell me I look like a
[1:23:23] dumpling
[1:23:36] and it's because you'd have a filter yet
[1:23:38] now as she gets older she's three years
[1:23:40] old I said you start to learn new you
[1:23:42] can see that you know afterwards what
[1:23:44] starts happening you start to think it
[1:23:50] but you don't say it
[1:23:53] because your mind filtering
[1:23:56] but what she is processing is in our
[1:23:58] little world
[1:24:00] and the reality is this is what it is
[1:24:02] after a while when there is no filter on
[1:24:05] you only your heart speaks on them
[1:24:08] so when people come to church it's a
[1:24:10] filtered version you see in here this
[1:24:11] morning people filter their dress
[1:24:15] but with Audi filter people take no
[1:24:18] filter there's a social mediator no
[1:24:19] filter
[1:24:22] we had this whole no filter means the
[1:24:24] real you then
[1:24:26] the real person that nobody really has
[1:24:28] seen are taking a no filter
[1:24:31] and the real you is what in your heart
[1:24:36] now if you're real you it's not a real
[1:24:38] Christian then what we've seen is a
[1:24:39] filtered version of a fake Christian
[1:24:42] and in no filter version is you with
[1:24:45] your makeup with your pants on with your
[1:24:46] with your drinking and your swing on
[1:24:48] your
[1:24:49] does it know or you're just you're lost
[1:24:51] in jealousy and every whatever form that
[1:24:53] takes
[1:24:55] no performance because you have nobody
[1:24:57] to impress somebody filter makes you
[1:25:00] anybody with me
[1:25:03] I still reading the scripture hear this
[1:25:05] don't know how I get there verse seven
[1:25:07] this is Paul still speaking and dealing
[1:25:09] with this issue of mind and heart and
[1:25:11] resolving this conflict even in verse 7
[1:25:14] as it is meet for me to think this of
[1:25:16] you all in other words Paul is saying
[1:25:18] even though it is appropriate it is fit
[1:25:20] for me to think this thing about you all
[1:25:22] listen it goes deeper because I have you
[1:25:25] in my heart
[1:25:27] so it's not just an intellectual thing
[1:25:30] for Paul he's saying it's not just a
[1:25:32] thinking about you I already have only
[1:25:33] in my heart
[1:25:35] so when somebody say listen pray for the
[1:25:37] pastor that's intellectual until you
[1:25:40] catch because a burden is not
[1:25:41] intellectual
[1:25:44] a burden is a movement of the mind to
[1:25:47] the heart
[1:25:50] can I connect Digger deeper
[1:25:53] somebody said pray for me pray for the
[1:25:55] city and somebody say sure we praying we
[1:25:57] respond in prayer is that in an
[1:25:59] intellectually sponsored as a heart
[1:26:00] response
[1:26:05] I want to ask the question again
[1:26:09] somebody say well remember me in prayer
[1:26:11] and so make sure I remember in prayer
[1:26:14] that initial response
[1:26:17] thank you very Terrace
[1:26:21] because we already pray for somebody
[1:26:24] you have to step into their shoes
[1:26:28] and that's not an intellectual thing
[1:26:30] that means there's a heart and you
[1:26:32] really catch a burden Lord if it was me
[1:26:34] if it was my son if it was my daughter
[1:26:37] if it was my wife if it was my business
[1:26:39] if it was my house oh God
[1:26:44] all of a sudden the perspective changes
[1:26:47] from an intellectual to
[1:26:50] because in your heart the heart is where
[1:26:53] the real connection between us lives
[1:26:54] they see German you is the same sauce as
[1:26:57] you see German me so when it comes to
[1:27:00] the heart now the connection becomes
[1:27:02] deeper connection and you feel for your
[1:27:04] brother you feel for your sister instead
[1:27:07] of working well as previously Brothers
[1:27:10] pray for you know how much how long you
[1:27:12] pray
[1:27:15] all glory
[1:27:19] I want to move away from this
[1:27:21] intellectual casual responses because
[1:27:24] this issue of being a real heart issue
[1:27:31] brother only when we listen to the
[1:27:33] message
[1:27:34] some weeks ago
[1:27:36] he was making a reference and I said
[1:27:37] listen when somebody end up in adultery
[1:27:40] it's not that they don't know
[1:27:43] she's not a mind issue
[1:27:46] it's a hard problem
[1:27:52] when somebody lies nobody lies without
[1:27:55] knowing is a lie
[1:27:57] so the issues that in knowledge
[1:28:00] is that the intellectual issue is a
[1:28:02] heart issue
[1:28:07] and it is a seed in you that see the sin
[1:28:10] don't do it
[1:28:15] you're hurting me
[1:28:17] because that's not my nature
[1:28:25] but the problem speaks about
[1:28:27] after a while people
[1:28:30] silence The Voice
[1:28:32] the voice I tell you don't do this and
[1:28:34] don't do this and don't do this The
[1:28:35] Voice starts her after wearing voice get
[1:28:37] shot up so much he stopped talking
[1:28:41] and there's no more voice of warning
[1:28:44] there's no more voice telling you you
[1:28:45] know you're doing the wrong thing oh God
[1:28:47] don't let us lose sensitivity
[1:28:49] to that still small voice
[1:28:53] try to get us to Calvary and then on to
[1:28:56] the rapture can the Church Say Amen
[1:28:59] I'm still in this verse here
[1:29:02] you have to forgive me I even get into
[1:29:04] the message
[1:29:06] I just didn't hear the silver seven even
[1:29:08] as it meant for me to think this of you
[1:29:10] all because I have you in my heart in as
[1:29:12] much as both in my bonds
[1:29:16] so even though he in bondage and in the
[1:29:18] defense and confirmation of the Gospel
[1:29:20] ye are all partakers of my grace
[1:29:23] in other words where I'm in bondage or
[1:29:25] not we are all participating in this
[1:29:27] thing
[1:29:28] for God is my record
[1:29:31] how greatly I long after you all in the
[1:29:35] bowels of Jesus Christ
[1:29:37] and this I pray that you'll love me
[1:29:39] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[1:29:42] and in all judgment
[1:29:45] so in other words every service we're
[1:29:47] supposed to be growing in knowledge and
[1:29:50] in all judgment and by judgment there it
[1:29:52] means our ability to discern and make
[1:29:55] proper decisions
[1:29:58] in other words every week we're supposed
[1:30:00] to be getting stronger better as
[1:30:02] Christians as Fathers as mothers as Sons
[1:30:05] as daughters as believers
[1:30:08] every service is a different class form
[1:30:11] one from two from three every service is
[1:30:14] a different class
[1:30:15] of you getting more refined and the
[1:30:17] mistakes and the issues you made a week
[1:30:19] ago two weeks ago four weeks ago 12
[1:30:21] weeks ago I don't expect it anymore
[1:30:26] and now you can make more active
[1:30:28] decisions about silencing when you need
[1:30:30] to this mind
[1:30:31] and feed his heart
[1:30:36] verse 10. that listen because verse 9
[1:30:40] there's a semi colon
[1:30:43] is that a semicolon right after all
[1:30:45] judgment
[1:30:46] in other words the sentence is not
[1:30:47] finished that email approve in other
[1:30:50] words all of this is so that you may
[1:30:52] approve things that are excellent
[1:30:55] in other words when something comes to
[1:30:57] you to approve you only approving things
[1:30:59] that are
[1:31:02] that he may be sincere
[1:31:06] sincerity is a hard thing
[1:31:08] sincerity is a no filter thing I won't
[1:31:11] admittee real you
[1:31:17] this is a deep thing you know
[1:31:22] your cousin's coming over so you have to
[1:31:23] behave yourself why the behave yourself
[1:31:25] when it was not there
[1:31:27] in other words the parents teach your
[1:31:29] children put on a filter
[1:31:32] but over coming over here
[1:31:35] so you know what that means
[1:31:37] and then people start to move things
[1:31:38] around shift things around adjust things
[1:31:39] why filter
[1:31:43] approve all things that are excellent
[1:31:45] that he may be sincere and without
[1:31:47] offense till the day of Christ
[1:31:50] being filled with the fruits of
[1:31:52] righteousness which are by Jesus Christ
[1:31:54] unto the glory and praise of God
[1:31:56] but I word that ye
[1:31:58] I would you should understand Brethren
[1:32:01] that the things which happen to me have
[1:32:03] fallen out rather under the furtherance
[1:32:05] of the Gospel
[1:32:08] so that my Bonds in Christ are manifest
[1:32:11] in all the palace and all other places
[1:32:13] in other words all the things that are
[1:32:15] happening is only extending this gospel
[1:32:18] so don't be bothered when things happen
[1:32:21] Don't Be Shaken when things happen
[1:32:23] because the gospel is being preached
[1:32:26] and verse 14 and many of the brethren in
[1:32:30] the Lord Works in Confident by my bones
[1:32:32] in other words they see in me in bondage
[1:32:35] they're seeing me keeping my head up
[1:32:37] they're seeing me not crying and
[1:32:39] frustrated they are being encouraged
[1:32:41] it's an encouragement friends when you
[1:32:44] are in a struggle and to make it see
[1:32:45] yourself standing
[1:32:50] it's an encouragement
[1:32:59] I look at Bella Terence is the Jenny
[1:33:01] here Michael their son my cousin is in
[1:33:04] hospital they gotta be home crying
[1:33:07] but they hear test they found any
[1:33:09] goodness of the Lord here in faith
[1:33:11] looking for God to perform a miracle
[1:33:12] that before the doctor could even
[1:33:14] operate the Holy Ghost will perform a
[1:33:16] surgery
[1:33:19] it's an encouragement to see them in the
[1:33:21] house of the Lord
[1:33:24] and many of us have testimonies
[1:33:27] and they're people who are not here who
[1:33:29] have no excuse
[1:33:36] you know why it's not in the heart to be
[1:33:38] here
[1:33:42] friends I'm not saying to have
[1:33:43] legitimate punch legitimate strong 100
[1:33:46] excuse but why are you not here with a
[1:33:49] weak excuse
[1:33:51] you have a flimsy issues that can't work
[1:33:53] nowhere else because you're showing what
[1:33:55] in your heart
[1:33:57] because even in your heart to be in the
[1:33:58] house your lord you'll be here
[1:34:03] anybody with me see that kind of rough
[1:34:05] Brothers
[1:34:09] but it's true
[1:34:13] people make excuses for stuff because
[1:34:15] they're trying to cover up what really
[1:34:16] in their heart and when they get caught
[1:34:18] in it as well it's just a little thing
[1:34:20] it's a whole thing it's a little thing
[1:34:21] but it's really your heart
[1:34:23] Lord creating me a clean heart you know
[1:34:28] it must be in your heart what your heart
[1:34:30] has is what you will live out
[1:34:32] let's get back I keep getting pulled
[1:34:34] away from the sea
[1:34:35] many of the brethren in the Lord waxing
[1:34:37] Confident by my bonds so when you're in
[1:34:40] trouble it's an encouragement to
[1:34:42] somebody when you still serve the Lord
[1:34:46] people drawstring from it so don't think
[1:34:49] well because I'm in trouble and my break
[1:34:50] my foot I want to come no come with the
[1:34:52] broken foot let us see it coming because
[1:34:54] some minutes I don't say look if he
[1:34:55] committed broken foot but my my foot I
[1:34:57] break
[1:34:59] what I what is my excuse
[1:35:02] Paul saying they're waxing Confident by
[1:35:04] my bones they're here in prison lock up
[1:35:06] and because they're in prison still
[1:35:08] preaching they're feeling good the
[1:35:09] preacher on the street they are much
[1:35:11] more bold to speak the word without fear
[1:35:14] that's what Paul's saying there
[1:35:16] and now it goes deeper coming to the
[1:35:18] issue of the heart some indeed preach
[1:35:21] Christ even of envy
[1:35:24] and strife
[1:35:26] and some also of Goodwill
[1:35:29] so Paul's saying they're preaching
[1:35:32] but no in the heart
[1:35:34] is because the Nvidia Ministry
[1:35:36] they have strive there like how I deal
[1:35:38] with this and how I deal with it but
[1:35:40] some doing it for Goodwill too you know
[1:35:42] the one preached Christ of contention
[1:35:45] not sincerely so it is dessert
[1:35:47] Discerning it supposing to add
[1:35:49] Affliction to my bones so he's saying
[1:35:51] their brothers preaching with an
[1:35:52] intention to hurt me while I'm in prison
[1:35:56] this is Paul
[1:35:58] star in the right hand of God messenger
[1:36:01] for the first age acknowledging
[1:36:03] ministers out there preaching to cause
[1:36:05] him hurt
[1:36:07] verse 17 but the other of love knowing
[1:36:10] that I'm set for the defense of the
[1:36:11] Gospel so the other preaching of love
[1:36:12] knowing where my heart is what then in
[1:36:16] other words he's saying what is that
[1:36:17] then in other words
[1:36:19] notwithstanding everywhere whether in
[1:36:22] pretense or in truth crisis preach
[1:36:25] and I do daring and I daring to Rejoice
[1:36:28] yea and Will Rejoice so he's saying I'm
[1:36:30] not going to let that bother me I'm not
[1:36:32] even gonna let enmity come into my heart
[1:36:35] again those brothers who doing it out of
[1:36:37] Envy because I want to keep my heart
[1:36:39] pure so because Christ is being preached
[1:36:42] I Will Rejoice I will sit in his service
[1:36:44] and lift my hand on worship because it
[1:36:46] is happy that God gets in the glory
[1:36:49] anybody with me this morning
[1:36:56] motive drives us
[1:36:58] what is the motive for the way you dress
[1:37:00] for the way you speak
[1:37:02] for the way you conduct yourself in your
[1:37:04] home
[1:37:06] the way you speak to your children the
[1:37:08] way you speak to your parents the way
[1:37:10] you speak to your friends the way you
[1:37:12] operate in church all of it stems from
[1:37:15] your heart
[1:37:17] it speaks of your deeper desires what
[1:37:20] are you feeding your heart what do you
[1:37:22] feed in your spirit what are you doing
[1:37:24] to draw yourself closer to God not
[1:37:26] intellectually now but in your heart
[1:37:30] what this message is calling for is a
[1:37:33] move from an intellectual I believe the
[1:37:35] message to my happy and change and a
[1:37:39] recognition of the need for your heart
[1:37:41] to be changed and that's why I read the
[1:37:43] scripture in Ezekiel a new heart I'll
[1:37:45] give you I'll put my spirit in there
[1:37:49] I'll give you a new spirit and then put
[1:37:51] my spirit in there
[1:37:53] and that's what I want all of us to live
[1:37:55] our lives know and listen I need a new
[1:37:57] heart I need a new spirit and I need his
[1:37:59] spirit and brother Branham taught us
[1:38:01] many people mix up that new spirit with
[1:38:03] the Holy Spirit he said it's not the
[1:38:05] same thing he said the new spirit is to
[1:38:08] be compatible with the Holy Spirit
[1:38:10] because your spirit can't even gets
[1:38:12] along with your wife he said that's in a
[1:38:13] message but when I give you a new spirit
[1:38:15] now that Spirit now is agreeable and
[1:38:18] that she is now compatible is that the
[1:38:19] same operating system
[1:38:21] so I think if you're operating system to
[1:38:23] receive the Holy Spirit can the Church
[1:38:24] Say Amen
[1:38:28] as we get closer to God
[1:38:32] we need to look more and more at our
[1:38:34] actions and our motives
[1:38:36] because our words
[1:38:39] God sees beyond the words
[1:38:41] we can fool one another with what we say
[1:38:43] you know we could even fool one another
[1:38:45] with what we see
[1:38:48] but who you really are
[1:38:50] is what's in your heart
[1:38:52] and a closer walk with God is really
[1:38:55] about your heart
[1:38:57] getting right with God
[1:38:58] let me say that one more time a close-up
[1:39:00] many people say I'm on a closer walk
[1:39:02] with God and you're ready to want to
[1:39:03] change your behavior
[1:39:06] and what I'm talking about here this
[1:39:07] morning is not what people see is what
[1:39:09] people don't see
[1:39:12] and that's a deeper message of this
[1:39:13] gospel
[1:39:15] it's a change that makes your life
[1:39:16] consistent across the board
[1:39:19] you know what they said about brother
[1:39:20] randomly couldn't tell us enemies from
[1:39:22] his friends
[1:39:23] because he was consistent across the
[1:39:25] board that's who I want to be consistent
[1:39:27] across the board not I'm a Christian on
[1:39:29] a Sunday and by Monday is a tyrant
[1:39:34] by Friday forget it I need to be
[1:39:36] re-baptized because make it back to
[1:39:38] Sunday service
[1:39:39] but your behavior now is one of Charity
[1:39:42] of love Faith virtue knowledge
[1:39:45] Temperance patience godliness living on
[1:39:47] oozing out of your heart not a mental
[1:39:51] not breathing for that you breathe in
[1:39:53] not an intellectual thing
[1:39:58] and you know every one of these virtues
[1:40:00] could be impersonated intellectually
[1:40:03] natural patience man just patient he
[1:40:05] just he never moving he's just patient
[1:40:06] he want to work he's patient
[1:40:10] so many patience of God which is a
[1:40:12] spiritual thing
[1:40:13] not an intellectual thing so this
[1:40:15] message for many people is an
[1:40:16] intellectual thing I'm not going to be
[1:40:17] too long with you
[1:40:19] but as Believers if you really want to
[1:40:21] grow in god grow in life
[1:40:24] you have to really want a high change
[1:40:29] and when your heart is change and you'll
[1:40:31] see everything else in your life begins
[1:40:33] to change
[1:40:44] I share this part in a Bible study when
[1:40:47] we look closely at our lives they are
[1:40:49] really only two things that affect us
[1:40:50] words and actions all of our challenges
[1:40:53] issues and frustrations come from our
[1:40:57] failure to understand motives
[1:41:00] how many arguments in your home could be
[1:41:02] avoided if you pause to understand the
[1:41:05] motive
[1:41:06] how many conflicts
[1:41:08] in your job could be mitigated if you
[1:41:11] pause to understand the motive
[1:41:15] how much trouble would you have avoided
[1:41:17] if you pause to consider the motive
[1:41:19] before you took a certain action
[1:41:21] because action is still a decision
[1:41:24] so your heart triggers a thought the
[1:41:26] thought is triggers an a decision or an
[1:41:28] action or a word
[1:41:30] and sometimes we just allow this to
[1:41:32] override this and something we allow
[1:41:33] this to take control of this
[1:41:36] so our desires Believers is to bring
[1:41:39] this mind now on the subjection
[1:41:41] and keep feeding this habit the word so
[1:41:44] out of your heart
[1:41:46] flaws the abundance of your heart the
[1:41:48] mouth speaks that that's it because you
[1:41:51] had it down so full of life until so you
[1:41:53] can only see a thing because your heart
[1:41:55] is not bubbling you're overwhelmed your
[1:41:57] heart's so Joy you're hard to Abundant
[1:41:59] that you can only speak the Praises you
[1:42:01] can always speak about the Delight
[1:42:02] you're so happy you're speaking positive
[1:42:04] over your children
[1:42:07] you're not in trouble but look at God in
[1:42:09] Ezekiel is he go to his sin I know all
[1:42:13] your profane my name
[1:42:15] I'm not even doing it for yourself my
[1:42:18] sake because my name is important I am
[1:42:20] willing to overlook what you have done
[1:42:22] because I need to protect my name
[1:42:25] my name are protected but also because
[1:42:27] in my name they're casting on devils in
[1:42:29] my name they will speak a new tongues in
[1:42:31] my name the enemy will scatter
[1:42:33] for my name's sake I will deliver you
[1:42:35] for my name's sake I will clean you up
[1:42:39] another speak last week that father had
[1:42:42] a choice
[1:42:44] and hear God the father in Ezekiel is
[1:42:47] showing the choice he had and he said I
[1:42:49] know your mess up but I am going to
[1:42:50] speak I'm going to deliver I'm going to
[1:42:52] sort it out Lord give us the heart of
[1:42:54] our true father
[1:42:55] the heart of a true mother the heart of
[1:42:57] a new son a true son out of a true
[1:42:59] daughter can the Church Say Amen
[1:43:03] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:10] your heart
[1:43:13] is really who you are who are you this
[1:43:15] morning
[1:43:20] who are you really
[1:43:22] not the intellectual response
[1:43:27] when Jacob wrestled with the angel
[1:43:29] and the question was asked who are you
[1:43:32] he was not in place resume
[1:43:36] he wasn't asking for the detail of his
[1:43:38] genealogy and his name he said I'm a
[1:43:40] Deceiver
[1:43:42] he was describing the condition of his
[1:43:46] he was asking who are you really
[1:43:49] because before I could fix you
[1:43:52] you have to know and understand who you
[1:43:54] are really
[1:43:58] so that's why when many people came they
[1:44:00] say save me I have sinned I'm a sinner
[1:44:06] I could see
[1:44:12] the woman
[1:44:13] are they well
[1:44:15] go call your husband
[1:44:19] her answer was have none
[1:44:24] she almost answered what Jesus didn't
[1:44:26] ask you know
[1:44:28] because she went deeper she could have
[1:44:29] just said I have none and leave it right
[1:44:31] there but he said I have one dirty one
[1:44:33] day I had five under one eleven is not
[1:44:34] mine and she said to just reveal what
[1:44:36] was in heart it was like this was a
[1:44:38] heaviness
[1:44:40] that was holding her down for a long
[1:44:41] time and it's like the first time you
[1:44:43] got to tell somebody who she really was
[1:44:46] you you you understand the liberty and
[1:44:48] the freedom that she had
[1:44:51] when she finally let oh that's it meant
[1:44:56] how free
[1:44:59] friends you know how free you are when
[1:45:00] you could finally release who you are
[1:45:02] and allow you Holy Ghost to come in and
[1:45:04] take take this seat of your heart
[1:45:06] you know what I should be walking around
[1:45:07] alive with the heaviness and the guilt
[1:45:09] and the shame and the past and the
[1:45:11] mistake and as if your carrying this
[1:45:12] huge weight on your shoulder you have no
[1:45:15] Outlet no release and you're just there
[1:45:16] and you're trying to press you and
[1:45:19] may you leave this service today with
[1:45:21] our freedom
[1:45:23] and a shout and that's why the Bible say
[1:45:25] who this son of man set free is free
[1:45:27] indeed you don't have to leave in
[1:45:29] bondage of your past
[1:45:31] your fears your mistakes today you can
[1:45:34] leave here shouting jumping on your
[1:45:36] rooftop and when you get that freedom no
[1:45:38] devil could ever come back in there can
[1:45:39] the Church Say Amen
[1:45:48] there's a few more scriptures could you
[1:45:50] take some more
[1:45:52] is this helping anybody
[1:45:58] Proverbs 16 2.
[1:46:00] all the ways of a man are clean in his
[1:46:03] own eyes
[1:46:06] but the Lord weigh at the spirits
[1:46:11] and I read it and he Amplified all the
[1:46:13] ways of a man are clean and innocent in
[1:46:16] his own eyes and he may see nothing
[1:46:19] wrong with his actions
[1:46:21] that's why the word comes
[1:46:23] but the Lord weighs and examines the
[1:46:25] motives and intents of the heart
[1:46:29] and knows the truth
[1:46:33] anybody with me
[1:46:36] Jeremiah 17 9.
[1:46:39] familiar scripture
[1:46:40] the heart is deceitful Above All Things
[1:46:44] and desperately wicked who can do it
[1:46:48] in the Amplified the heart is deceitful
[1:46:51] above all things and is extremely sick
[1:46:54] who can understand it fully and know its
[1:46:57] secret motives friends
[1:47:00] no wonder that song David said created
[1:47:03] me a clean heart
[1:47:06] takes on a whole new meaning
[1:47:10] because only God could do that operation
[1:47:14] is there anybody want to leave here this

[1:47:17] operation on the inner man on the heart

[1:47:36] to lead you and to guide you to direct

[1:50:58] how do they want to come to church to to
[1:51:00] hear something and go back on the net I
[1:51:02] know I learned something no I want to
[1:51:04] change
[1:51:05] I want somebody to say what happened to
[1:51:06] you
[1:51:07] what happened to you you're different

[1:51:24] because you went to the heart doctor
[1:51:27] you went to the heart specialist where's
[1:51:29] the heart doctor cardiologist is that
[1:51:30] the right one yeah cardiologists or a
[1:51:33] heart surgeon and he's able to give you
[1:51:34] a new one
[1:51:38] you see I take all this to anyone
[1:51:40] I'll take it out
[1:51:42] that one after go
[1:51:44] if you never had a heart transplant
[1:51:45] today today's a day to have a hundred he

[1:51:53] have is a stony one but I want to give
[1:51:54] you a heart of Flesh because only a
[1:51:57] heart of Flesh could take a new spirit
[1:51:59] this story
[1:52:08] [Applause]
[1:52:19] you may be seated I want to separate I
[1:52:21] want to resolve the conflict between the
[1:52:24] mind and the Heart the purpose of the
[1:52:26] preaching of the gospel because faith
[1:52:28] comes by hearing and hearing his word so
[1:52:31] they put you know especially men men
[1:52:32] don't like to go by the doctor
[1:52:38] they like to self-medicate yeah they
[1:52:40] feel it that it threatens their machismo
[1:52:42] de bravado they're strengthened
[1:52:48] so then you have to go and talk them and
[1:52:50] talk them and talk them and talk them
[1:52:52] and tell them and tell them and tell
[1:52:53] them
[1:52:54] and that talk is just like
[1:52:57] because until they intellectually
[1:52:59] convinced to go by the doctor only then
[1:53:01] the doctor could really operate so it's
[1:53:03] the same principle with mind and heart
[1:53:05] we are here this morning for people to
[1:53:07] accept witness I really need to change
[1:53:10] you know that people don't think they
[1:53:13] need to change
[1:53:15] that is a bigger fear you know better
[1:53:16] punch
[1:53:17] people who in the message who think
[1:53:19] because I believe the message here
[1:53:22] that this change automatically as a
[1:53:24] result of what happened here
[1:53:26] because you can believe the message will
[1:53:28] be leaving us and they're not here
[1:53:29] anymore
[1:53:31] even the devil believer not the belief
[1:53:33] is not the issue is if you will allow
[1:53:35] the belief to take it to action which is
[1:53:37] surgery table to shape and mold for the
[1:53:40] Potter to have permission to touch the
[1:53:42] clay
[1:53:47] the whole objective of preaching is to
[1:53:50] prepare you you ever go about doctor and
[1:53:51] say well fill out this form never talk
[1:53:53] to you you're not supposed to eat for

[1:56:21] teaching so why you can't do it
[1:56:25] it's because you have a medicine

[1:57:11] rapture
[1:57:13] is that a new message
[1:57:17] but we struggle to live it
[1:57:19] because you haven't allowed the surgeon
[1:57:22] to cut out the Stony heart to put a new
[1:57:24] spirit in there and for the Holy Ghost
[1:57:27] the holy ghosts the step into 16
[1:57:31] elements

[1:58:15] sisters don't wear makeup
[1:58:17] don't cut your hair don't wear pants how
[1:58:20] much time you want to hear that
[1:58:26] when you come to church worship God
[1:58:30] all the worldly friends
[1:58:34] is there anybody here in this video the
[1:58:36] first time
[1:58:41] because if it's the first time then it
[1:58:43] have to be your first day you're here
[1:58:48] it was the first day here
[1:58:51] but if you've been here at any point of
[1:58:52] time you would have heard this from
[1:58:54] the god called me that says he has
[1:58:56] placed in his house
[1:58:57] who every service and you know what
[1:58:59] better but I'm said I could preach it
[1:59:00] I'm blue in your face
[1:59:04] but I tell us what is inspired to you
[1:59:06] and inspire me and dropping from mentors
[1:59:12] it had to move it needs to move it needs
[1:59:15] to be a movement and listen when this
[1:59:17] moves
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:24] when this thing move
[1:59:26] when I see people running wrongly
[1:59:27] building hunting it's because I'm moving
[1:59:30] that's why as ministers we know when it
[1:59:32] move
[1:59:34] we could tell when he touched you we can
[1:59:37] know when you're met decision we know oh
[1:59:40] come on now Hallelujah
[1:59:45] [Applause]
[1:59:49] you have to forgive me
[1:59:51] but I am blessed because this is the
[1:59:55] word this is not my thoughts this is the
[1:59:57] word of God
[1:59:58] and I want to see this for me and for
[2:00:01] you
[2:00:01] because brother Adam said after you
[2:00:03] receive the Holy Ghost now you have to
[2:00:04] make yourself a Christian
[2:00:06] so it's not as if it's a switch because
[2:00:08] some of us like this switch thing
[2:00:11] it just switched on you just walk out
[2:00:12] and everything no you're a soldier
[2:00:17] so now you receive the Holy Ghost pick

[2:00:58] you still have to make yourself a
[2:01:00] question and all that in it no don't let
[2:01:03] me preach this morning all that in it is
[2:01:05] working no life is work this kingdom is
[2:01:07] work
[2:01:12] the Holy Ghost gives you a new control
[2:01:14] tower it lets you know what to do and
[2:01:17] what not to do but you're still into
[2:01:18] work you're still going to pay your
[2:01:20] bills you still need to go to your job
[2:01:21] and situation will come because the
[2:01:23] prophet taught us the devil will test
[2:01:25] every virtue you claim you have
[2:01:27] and yes every right to test it you say
[2:01:29] you have patience
[2:01:34] and turn only calypso music for you and
[2:01:36] see how much patience you have
[2:01:42] put in a traffic jam I see believers
[2:01:48] somebody struggle with road rage
[2:01:51] road rage
[2:01:54] we need to go back to decision
[2:01:56] they call back what's the number of
[2:01:58] researchers
[2:02:00] the doctor does checking up to see how
[2:02:02] things go into the operation say hey Doc
[2:02:06] we call any back yes because we have a
[2:02:08] road rage incident here
[2:02:12] we need something more
[2:02:14] and we we we need a Top-Up
[2:02:17] and that's why when those disciples went
[2:02:19] every day he said they were refilled
[2:02:20] with you when he goes
[2:02:24] the first time
[2:02:28] any dynamics of this church will be uh
[2:02:30] refilling
[2:02:31] the top up
[2:02:33] Morty spirit
[2:02:35] anybody with me this morning
[2:02:37] [Applause]
[2:02:38] but your car joined this Spirit talk if
[2:02:40] you have a stone your heart
[2:02:44] I would love we could talk about you
[2:02:46] know where any car really talk about it
[2:02:48] you can talk about it but we really want
[2:02:50] to talk about it
[2:02:52] but until you're willing to come and say
[2:02:54] Lord are broken I really recognize I'm a
[2:02:56] horrible wife I'm a horrible husband our
[2:02:58] horrible father I really mess up and I
[2:03:00] recognize it's a hard problem I have and
[2:03:01] I want you to perform surgery and cut
[2:03:03] out the Stony heart give me a new heart
[2:03:05] so I can start over today
[2:03:07] you see when I reached that point of
[2:03:09] Brokenness because Isaiah was not there
[2:03:11] until he came into the presence of God
[2:03:13] he wasn't seeing his issues
[2:03:16] until he was close to the presidency
[2:03:19] with him
[2:03:21] I'm a man of unclean what was me
[2:03:25] the close side came into presence the
[2:03:27] more he recognized Lord I'm undone
[2:03:30] daughter was okay
[2:03:32] I thought I was prophesying fine but I
[2:03:34] recognized there's some my lips on
[2:03:35] cleaner say anything that shouldn't be
[2:03:37] saying I'm a man of unclean lips I need
[2:03:39] to adjust the words I use
[2:03:42] take the calls burn it burn it change it
[2:03:44] I just don't want to be the same
[2:03:45] whatever you need to do Lord whatever
[2:03:47] you need to do
[2:03:49] God wants to bring us to that spot
[2:03:52] where you say Lord whatever you need to
[2:03:54] do do it
[2:03:56] so that I could be permanently changed
[2:03:57] because listen when is Tony I'll come on
[2:04:02] CE it's only had this old is a flesh
[2:04:05] heart is in there it's just
[2:04:07] new spirit and then his holy spirit next
[2:04:10] so you need to know where on this
[2:04:12] journey you are
[2:04:17] no I'm going to say something here there
[2:04:18] are people saying Lord I want this
[2:04:20] spirit and I want to be very clear if
[2:04:22] your heart tells Tony
[2:04:24] let me adjust address the process now
[2:04:31] if your heart change now we can really
[2:04:33] pray
[2:04:34] for the Holy Spirit to come unto need or
[2:04:36] to be new spirit but if you know that's
[2:04:38] Tony hat in there then today
[2:04:41] don't you leave without meet any surgeon
[2:04:50] the musicians can get ready I'm almost
[2:04:52] done
[2:05:03] just go a little deeper and I shared
[2:05:05] this before in a Bible study
[2:05:07] in James he's speaking
[2:05:11] he said he asked and this is just to
[2:05:13] kneel down the need this morning friends
[2:05:17] to Bear your heart before the Lord
[2:05:20] prostrate yourself before the Lord
[2:05:23] forget everything else and say Lord I
[2:05:25] need help
[2:05:27] we don't need an extra service you need
[2:05:29] help from the Lord
[2:05:32] he said your ass and receive not this is
[2:05:34] James 4 3.
[2:05:36] because you ask a miss
[2:05:39] that he may consume it upon your lusts
[2:05:43] and he's saying here in the Amplified
[2:05:45] you ask God for something
[2:05:47] and you do have receive it because you
[2:05:49] ask with wrong motives
[2:05:51] and wrong motive speaker
[2:05:54] I had a problem
[2:05:55] motives out of selfishness or with an
[2:05:58] unrighteous agenda
[2:06:01] so that when you get what you want you
[2:06:03] may spend it on your hedonistic desires
[2:06:12] be something
[2:06:17] [Music]
[2:06:25] I'll skip this
[2:06:55] foreign
[2:07:04] God is looking for honesty
[2:07:07] he's looking for sincerity
[2:07:12] the surgeon is ready this morning
[2:07:14] [Music]
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:45] [Music]
[2:07:52] thank you
[2:07:56] every head about every eye closed
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:05] I believe this morning God wants to
[2:08:07] minister to Believers in different ways
[2:08:14] you have to know where you are at
[2:08:20] there are those here who
[2:08:22] you may realize from the word that you
[2:08:24] have a Stony heart
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:27] and what you need is a heart of Flesh
[2:08:29] here to deal with that this morning
[2:08:32] the surgeon is here this morning
[2:08:35] with one purpose as a decision
[2:08:37] to cut out the Stony heart
[2:08:39] and to put a heart of Flesh
[2:08:43] to get that heart of Flesh
[2:08:45] the random taught us so many times he
[2:08:46] wants to give you a new spirit
[2:08:49] he said you can't even get along with
[2:08:51] yourself
[2:08:52] the Old Devil Spirit you had in you
[2:08:55] so he's got to put a new spirit in you
[2:08:58] so that he could get along with his
[2:08:59] spirit
[2:09:03] he said you can't get along with your
[2:09:06] wife you can't get along with your
[2:09:07] husband you can't get along with your
[2:09:08] neighbor how are you ever going to get
[2:09:10] along with God
[2:09:11] so he has to give you a new spirit
[2:09:13] before you get along with him
[2:09:16] so he puts a news hurt in you then he
[2:09:18] puts his Spirit In You
[2:09:20] then he puts his holy spirit there
[2:09:22] down
[2:09:24] so maybe you have had a surgery
[2:09:27] and you have a heart of Flesh and maybe
[2:09:30] you have not experienced a new spirit
[2:09:34] he's here for you too this morning

[2:09:45] this spirit and you're looking now for
[2:09:46] the Holy Spirit
[2:09:48] he's here to meet you also
[2:09:51] and maybe you've already received the
[2:09:53] Holy Spirit and you're looking for a
[2:09:54] refilling of the Holy Spirit he's here
[2:09:56] to meet you to this morning
[2:09:58] so he's here to meet every need
[2:10:00] every request every situation this

[2:43:02] [Music]
[2:43:09] this one to Bald Head says you want to
[2:43:10] breathe
[2:43:11] for sister Naomi who is presently
[2:43:14] experienced light heaviness hadness and
[2:43:16] body pain and feeling unwell that God
[2:43:18] would break all stronghold of sickness
[2:43:20] upon her even now according to his word
[2:43:22] if you all agree on anything shall be
[2:43:24] dancing she's presently downstairs
[2:43:27] father God we pray that your presence
[2:43:29] with visitors even now and when you
[2:43:32] break whatever is upon her Lord Jesus
[2:43:33] break it off I mean she really touched
[2:43:36] from the crown of the head to the soul
[2:43:38] of her feet and Jason we ask it amen and
[2:43:41] amen God bless you we have your seats
[2:43:46] what a time this morning
[2:43:48] we certainly appreciate
[2:43:51] amen the word
[2:43:53] that's what I enjoy so much that the
[2:43:55] Brethren the brothers the ministers were
[2:43:57] just deliver the word
[2:43:59] they're not here to promote themselves
[2:44:02] or they won't taught some ideas just to
[2:44:04] deliver the word that will help your
[2:44:07] help you as a person because that's
[2:44:09] where we want to be we want to be better
[2:44:10] persons and and God search the reins of
[2:44:13] the heart
[2:44:14] God tested that young man that's why he
[2:44:17] left and he went and a far country and
[2:44:19] God tested his older brother also when
[2:44:22] he came back and there's some people who
[2:44:23] can't handle when Baxter has come back
[2:44:25] they can't handle I'll be talking about
[2:44:27] the Sheep uh the the one sheep that was
[2:44:29] a street and they come back on the on
[2:44:31] the on the shoulder of the shepherd when
[2:44:33] you get fight with that because that
[2:44:35] person getting our shoulder right
[2:44:37] but the point about it that God said he
[2:44:39] lives in 1909 and go for that one
[2:44:43] so I pray that God gave you a burden
[2:44:45] because only those people with the
[2:44:47] burden could effectively pray
[2:44:49] and strange enough only those who pray
[2:44:51] and could get a burden
[2:44:52] so when you pray you get a burden when
[2:44:54] they get a burden you pray more
[2:44:56] if you have no burden you're living for
[2:44:58] yourself you know you're doing your own
[2:44:59] thing you're going your own way but you
[2:45:00] see when you get that spirit that you
[2:45:02] have recognize the world is not about
[2:45:04] you
[2:45:05] watching the mirror it's not about you
[2:45:07] watching yourself it's not about you you
[2:45:09] think it's about you it's not about you
[2:45:10] your deceived thing is all about you
[2:45:12] it's about God
[2:45:13] what his will is many people don't even
[2:45:16] imagine whether it will be five years
[2:45:17] from now
[2:45:18] see they don't know they make decisions
[2:45:21] and choices and things begin to unfold
[2:45:23] but you've got to put God first
[2:45:26] and he would bless you and keep you amen
[2:45:29] so this morning we want to welcome uh
[2:45:30] Tamika modest I hope I pronounced right
[2:45:32] from invited by Jose Bautista
