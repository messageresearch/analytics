[2:30] So Unworthy to stand in your presence
[2:32] today Father you said we were born in
[2:35] sin and shaped in iniquity but Lord is's
[2:38] a blood sacrifice that was paid for us
[2:41] so that when you look through this Blood
[2:43] father you see different from what the
[2:45] world sees you see different from what
[2:47] our experiences see and our backgrounds
[2:50] and the situation that we have been
[2:52] through I pray dear God that as We
[2:54] Gather here together you would touch us
[2:56] in a mighty way that you would speak to
[2:58] our hearts and you would bring Liberty
[3:00] father to the marriages to the lives
[3:02] that are here father Lord we are a needy
[3:04] people today needing a touch from you

[3:23] your hands in the precious name of Jesus
[3:25] Christ may you take me out of the way
[3:27] may you bless Lord everything that will
[3:29] be said said and done in the precious
[3:30] name of Jesus Christ and the church says
[3:34] amen you may be seated in the presence
[3:37] of the
[3:38] Lord well it is with a great privilege
[3:42] great honor I stand here this evening to
[3:44] welcome you to our first marriage
[3:47] conference headstone Tabernacles first
[3:49] marriage conference and uh I could
[3:52] assure you it will not be the last I see
[3:55] it as the beginning of a program to
[3:58] really strengthen the the building block
[4:01] that God established in the Garden of
[4:03] Eden when he put Adam and Eve together
[4:05] as the foundation for everything that
[4:08] would be
[4:09] established I just want to read one
[4:11] scripture you don't have to find it it's
[4:13] found in the Book of Proverbs chapter 4
[4:15] and it is verse 7 Proverbs 4:7 wisdom is
[4:21] the principal thing therefore get wisdom
[4:25] and with all thy
[4:27] getting get on
[4:30] understanding and that's why we are here
[4:32] this evening to get understanding and
[4:35] it's interesting um I have good news and
[4:38] I'm bad news the good news is I'm not
[4:40] the speaker tonight that's the good news
[4:44] the bad news is I'll be speaking for
[4:45] about 10
[4:47] minutes and uh I have the pleasure of
[4:50] introducing the speaker
[4:52] tonight but um the reason I'm happy that
[4:56] I'm not speaking is that um I haven't
[4:58] been married that long
[5:01] to really share what I could call
[5:03] profound or deep insight into marriage
[5:07] um I do not by any means consider or
[5:10] count myself a professional in the area
[5:12] of marriage but I have observed certain
[5:15] truths certain realities and just coming
[5:17] up in the car I was saying it's
[5:18] interesting that maturity and age are
[5:21] not correlated a lot of people are under
[5:23] the assumption that the older you get
[5:26] the mature you are but I that that
[5:29] assumption is defied every single day
[5:31] when I see people who are 60 70 doing
[5:34] stuff that 15 year olds don't want to do
[5:36] so I have come to the realization that
[5:39] we can no longer assume certain things
[5:43] and therein lies the foundation for why
[5:45] this exists today we could no longer
[5:48] assume that because someone is in church
[5:51] as a brother that they understand what
[5:54] it means to be a
[5:56] husband we could no longer assume that
[5:58] because some someone says they come to
[6:00] church for 30 years as a woman that they
[6:03] understand what it is to be a wife or to
[6:05] be a mother or to be a caregiver so we
[6:08] are here tonight to remove the
[6:11] assumptions we are here tonight to start
[6:14] from scratch we're here today to start
[6:16] from the basic building blocks of
[6:20] certain elements that were passed on
[6:22] many generations ago but as time evolved
[6:24] we have somehow lost these things we
[6:27] have somehow lost them lost l through
[6:30] traveling to work and lost through
[6:32] washing to pay the bills and rushing to
[6:34] do this commitment 50 years ago 100
[6:37] years ago it was okay to say I'm the man
[6:40] of my house and my wife can stay home
[6:42] and do the dishes and things like that
[6:46] now you tell you speak about the woman's
[6:49] places to do the dishes you will start a
[6:51] revolution that you will not hear the
[6:53] end of CCN TV6 CNC3 will come storming
[6:57] up say say say that one more time just
[6:59] so we we can get it on
[7:02] Facebook the world has evolved but God
[7:06] has not
[7:08] changed and as the environment around us
[7:11] changed doesn't mean certain core
[7:13] principles are not held the
[7:16] same I have two more minutes before our
[7:19] speaker comes along but I do want to
[7:22] make mention of the fact that we now
[7:24] require a balance in life and many
[7:28] people inquired as to the nature of
[7:30] today's session and what we are trying
[7:32] to achieve and accomplish and who can
[7:34] come and I would say that I would pray
[7:36] that as we do more of these sessions
[7:38] more would come because it is not just
[7:40] for those who are married or those who
[7:41] have intention of getting married it is
[7:43] to empower individuals as Christians who
[7:46] follow the Bible First and the message
[7:49] of Malachi for William brandham to what
[7:52] we should represent as marriage what we
[7:55] should teach people so when somebody
[7:57] asks us What is marriage all about we
[7:59] can tell them this is what God intended
[8:01] for marriage to look like can somebody
[8:04] say Amen am so I pray that today's
[8:07] session would be an encouragement to you
[8:09] it would be an inspiration to you and it
[8:11] will be the seed because it is
[8:12] impossible to capture in one session
[8:15] everything that we have in our hearts to
[8:16] share it's impossible to capture in 15
[8:19] sessions because as a friend of mine
[8:21] said recently there was no graduation
[8:22] class for marriage after you've been
[8:25] married for 30 years you realize you
[8:26] know what I just discovered something
[8:28] new and I'm speaking this after just
[8:30] about 10 months of
[8:32] marriage fresh out the gate and I tell
[8:36] you wife God bless
[8:40] you it is a journey that and and the
[8:43] reality is the Bible tells us to
[8:45] encourage one another to support one
[8:47] another and sometimes you might think
[8:48] that the situation you are in you are
[8:50] the only person on the planet going
[8:52] through that and then you realize when
[8:53] you talk to somebody you know is a
[8:55] similar thing is a similar thing because
[8:57] there are only so many permutations of
[8:59] human behavior that could exist but
[9:01] every answer to every question we could
[9:03] ever have is found in the Bible amen
[9:06] somebody say amen amen so that's enough
[9:08] of what I have to say that's my
[9:10] introduction without hesitation this
[9:12] evening I would like to welcome to the
[9:14] podium this evening the pastor of this
[9:16] church the Reverend theopus o Jr who has
[9:18] the distinct privilege of presenting
[9:20] tonight's word to you uh as a foundation
[9:23] for what marriage is for the church for
[9:26] this for for the group I do want to take
[9:28] this opportunity to wel welcome all the
[9:29] visitors in our gates those that are

[14:15] Jesus name I ask it before I have a
[14:17] seats I'd like to read a scripture the
[14:19] scripture you want to read is some
[14:21] Ephesians maybe you didn't reading your
[14:23] Bible but I will have to read that
[14:26] scripture for you and that is from ephes
[14:28] Ephesians chapter 5 we want to read from
[14:31] verse
[14:33] 21 I want to welcome everyone of you

[14:57] the same you're here to be edified
[15:00] enriched and to enhance and improve your
[15:03] relationship we would speak to you by
[15:04] experience inspiration and knowledge
[15:08] praise the Lord so you want to go to
[15:10] Ephesians amen somebody saying
[15:14] yes all right from verse 21 we read
[15:19] submitting yourselves one to another in
[15:21] the fear of God wies submit yourselves
[15:24] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord
[15:27] for the husband is the head of the wife
[15:29] even as Christ is the head of the church
[15:32] and he's the savior of the body
[15:34] therefore as the church is subject unto
[15:36] Christ so that the wives be to their own
[15:39] husbands in everything husbands love
[15:42] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[15:44] church and give himself for it that he
[15:47] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[15:51] washing of the Water by the word that he
[15:53] might present it to himself a glorious
[15:56] church not having spot a ring inle or
[15:58] any such thing but that it should be
[16:01] holy and without blemish so ought men
[16:05] ought so ought men to love their wives
[16:08] as their own buddies he that loveth his
[16:11] wife loveth himself for no man ever yet
[16:13] hated his own flesh but nourisheth and
[16:16] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[16:19] church for we are members of his body of
[16:22] his flesh of his bones for this cause
[16:24] shall a man leave his father and mother
[16:27] shall be joined unto his wife and they
[16:28] two shall be one flesh this is a great
[16:31] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[16:33] and the church nevertheless let every
[16:36] one of you in particular so love his
[16:37] wife even as himself and the wife see
[16:41] that you reference a husband may God
[16:42] bless his word you may be
[16:49] seated okay so the ties are
[16:54] off and all the seriousness going to go
[16:57] off I want you to get relaxed this
[17:00] evening this is something burning on my
[17:03] heart and uh as we say we speak to you
[17:06] by inspiration by experience and by
[17:08] knowledge
[17:09] question on a scale of 1 to
[17:12] 10 people start to
[17:14] laugh where one is the lowest and 10 is
[17:17] the
[17:18] highest how would you rate your
[17:21] relationship don't
[17:23] answer no
[17:25] answers we just want you to keep a
[17:27] number in your mind I'll repeat it on a
[17:30] scale of 1 to 10 where one is the lowest
[17:32] and 10 is the highest how would you rate
[17:35] your relationship or
[17:39] marriage arrive at a number in your
[17:42] mind you can't ask your spouse or your
[17:46] partner this is through your eyes you
[17:50] getting that
[17:52] number so it has to be through your eyes
[17:56] how is your relationship ship through
[18:00] your eyes and experience is it a five a
[18:04] four a six a nine I'm talking about
[18:10] you is it a
[18:13] four what make it a four or a five let
[18:17] us hear the positive of how you arrive
[18:19] at the Grand number of
[18:22] three now I don't want you to think it
[18:25] need three more to move to 10 I just
[18:29] want you to think that you say three and
[18:31] whoo let's talk about the Tre not talk
[18:33] about a short seven to make the
[18:36] 10 so then let's hear of how you
[18:41] positively arrive at
[18:43] two because you have to have something
[18:45] to make you move it to two then how can
[18:49] you shift from 2 to 6 or from 5 to 7 or
[18:52] from 8 to 10 and that's what we're here
[18:54] to do to shift that lever in your Mar
[18:58] marriage to shift that lever in your
[19:02] relationship now the title I have for
[19:05] this session is breaking the curse of a
[19:10] signning blame don't ask me how I got it
[19:14] don't ask me where I got it I just got
[19:18] it how God knows but this is what is
[19:22] upon my heart breaking the curse of
[19:26] assigning blame and under that of a
[19:29] subtopic broken
[19:31] homes scripture Genesis 1:27 and God
[19:35] created man in his own image and the
[19:37] image of God created he him male and
[19:39] female created he them God blessed them
[19:41] God said unto them be fruitful multiply
[19:44] replenish the Earth subdue it have
[19:46] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[19:47] the fall of the air over every living
[19:49] thing that moveth upon the Earth Genesis
[19:52] 311 and God said who told thee thou was
[19:55] naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[19:57] whereof I commanded that thou shouldest
[19:59] not eat the man said the woman whom thou
[20:02] givest to be with me she gave me of the
[20:05] tree and I did eat the Lord God said
[20:07] unto woman what is this that thou has
[20:09] done the woman said the serpent begil me
[20:13] and I did eat and the Lord God said unto
[20:15] the serpent because thou has done this
[20:17] thou are cursed above all cattle above
[20:19] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[20:21] shal thou go and thus shalt thou eat all
[20:23] the days of thy life and I will put enry
[20:25] between thee and the woman between thy
[20:27] SE and her seed it shall bruise thy head
[20:30] Thou shalt bruise his heel unto the
[20:32] woman he said I will greatly multiply
[20:34] thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow
[20:37] shalt thou bring forth children thy
[20:39] desire shall be to thy husband and he
[20:43] shall rule over thee and unto Adam he
[20:46] said because thou has harkened unto the
[20:48] voice of thy wife and has eaten of the
[20:51] tree of which I commanded thee saying
[20:53] Thou shalt not eat of it curse is the
[20:55] ground for thy sake and sorrow shall sh
[20:58] thou eat of it all the days of thy life
[21:02] I read that scripture to put a
[21:04] background of broken homes and ass
[21:07] signing
[21:08] blame did you come from a broken
[21:11] home a broken marriage a broken
[21:15] relationship I'm here to tell you you
[21:18] are not
[21:19] alone broken home is not new in fact the
[21:24] first broken home was in Genesis with
[21:28] Adam and Eve the marriage the union the
[21:33] commission to multiply and replenish was
[21:36] given to continue the family of God on
[21:38] the earth it was God's purpose or intent
[21:43] that marriage Union was the means by
[21:45] which there would be
[21:47] increase as you see in the
[21:50] scriptures because of sin blame was a
[21:54] sign first Adam blamed the woman now God
[21:58] spoke to Adam when God spoke to the Adam
[22:01] the woman was even
[22:03] wrong Eve didn't come forth yet God gave
[22:07] adam to work God gave adam uh uh his
[22:11] word and then give God get Adam a
[22:15] woman not the other way around he gave
[22:18] him word
[22:21] work and woman isn't that right and when
[22:25] sin came in when God say Adam you are
[22:29] responsible Adam say not me is she and
[22:34] Adam begin to pass the blame and the
[22:36] woman said not me is we wouldn't call
[22:40] him is a
[22:42] serpent okay now
[22:44] watch Adam blame his wife the woman
[22:49] blamed the serpent question
[22:52] who or what are you
[22:55] blaming for your condition
[22:58] or your
[23:00] predicament judgment was pronounced on
[23:03] the
[23:04] family the lesson from this we are
[23:08] individually responsible in other words
[23:12] I am responsible say that after me I am
[23:16] responsible I am respons say louder I am
[23:19] responsible I am responsible it is time
[23:22] to break the curse of
[23:25] excuses and assigning blame
[23:28] by accepting listen responsibility for
[23:32] your behavior action and
[23:36] attitudes if you are
[23:38] sick it is your responsibility to seek
[23:42] help by going to the doctor Hospital
[23:45] wherever and if your marriage or
[23:47] relationship is sick you seek all the
[23:50] tools all the help all to know how to
[23:54] get it back on
[23:56] track judgment struck the family because
[24:00] of sin and sin has
[24:04] consequences Genesis what we read your

[26:11] popularly created repeated that
[26:14] expresses a truth based on common sense
[26:16] or practical experience of humanity for
[26:20] example a proverb you can lead a horse

[26:39] wisdom is the principal thing therefore
[26:43] get wisdom I with all I get in get
[26:47] understanding Proverbs 9:13 a foolish
[26:49] woman is clamorous she is simple and
[26:52] knoweth nothing that in the Amplified

[27:16] with her hands Psalms 34:19 many are the
[27:21] Affliction of the righteous but the Lord
[27:22] delivered him out of them
[27:25] all job was doing
[27:28] fine his marriage was fine
[27:33] until things were fine until and that
[27:38] until becomes a point of blame things
[27:41] going good money coming in good
[27:44] everything smooth until and that until
[27:49] becomes a point of
[27:52] blame in job's case God's plan was to
[27:56] bring out and manif EST the faith that
[27:59] was resident in job a Fai Tried by
[28:05] fire if righteousness can be achieved by
[28:08] works we need the law but it is achieved
[28:11] by and through faith in the blood of
[28:13] Jesus therefore The Vow for better for
[28:17] worse for richer for poorer in sickness
[28:20] on health
[28:21] stands no excuses really it's a covenant
[28:26] with the indiv viil that you walk up
[28:28] that a better for worse richer for
[28:32] poorer there is no excuse to break that
[28:35] vow it's a commitment and a covenant to
[28:40] God
[28:42] therefore God promised to make all
[28:45] things work together for good Romans
[28:48] 8:28 to them that love the word Lord
[28:52] therefore you cannot be good enough or
[28:53] clean enough forget about it there is
[28:55] none righteous no not one
[28:58] it is not like if somebody is more
[28:59] holier than you or you have to get holy
[29:01] like that person there is not right n
[29:03] righteous no not one watch therefore you
[29:07] cannot be bad enough that God hand is
[29:09] short that he cannot redeem the bottom
[29:13] line is do the best with what you have
[29:16] got with your eyes on him who holds your
[29:20] future God can heal Hearts how many
[29:23] believe that God can heal lives how many
[29:26] believe that yeah God can heal homes how
[29:29] many believe that and God can restore
[29:32] families and we have a testimony I'd
[29:34] like to share with you brother and
[29:37] sister uh Kristoff and um they here this
[29:42] today and they are Fellowship among us
[29:44] and this is a testimony and this is his
[29:46] testimony have been among us about two
[29:49] months about a month now officially
[29:51] about a month officially right now and
[29:53] he said my marriage was in a real
[29:54] damaged State my wife said she hated me
[29:58] there's a powerful statement
[30:00] there the
[30:03] wife and I had no chance of getting back
[30:06] I didn't even want it to be in the same
[30:08] church together there are many compiled
[30:10] circumstances that cause us to want to
[30:13] be away from each other and to lead us
[30:14] to us being separated and after a while
[30:18] I wanted my marriage to work out after
[30:20] hearing sermons of how we could not run
[30:21] from our trials I wanted another chance
[30:25] when I heard of a common Deliverance
[30:26] service I said to myself I'll get them
[30:29] to pray for me in it in that Deliverance
[30:31] service the pastor and his Minister join
[30:33] arms and prayed for me they told me it
[30:35] will work out trust in God I pledge to
[30:38] hold Jesus to his servant's prayer I
[30:41] believe it would have been done a couple
[30:43] of weeks later my sister and I streamed
[30:45] a Sunday service in which the pastor at
[30:48] the end of the service read a letter
[30:50] that teed the high calling I was
[30:53] immediately consumed with it I felt like
[30:56] the letter was all about me me I
[30:58] couldn't wait to search the internet to
[30:59] get my own copy but I could not find
[31:01] anything of that sort I download the
[31:03] Sunday service Sunday service to hear it
[31:05] again and I even let my sister hear it
[31:08] in believing Jesus healed my wife's
[31:10] heart towards me I would call her to
[31:12] check up on my son and ask her how she
[31:15] was doing but tasted her bitterness each
[31:17] time but on that particular Sunday even
[31:21] I did a bitter test it was bitter and I
[31:23] cried and said Lord I know you will do
[31:25] it you already you're already working on
[31:28] it a few hours later I called her again
[31:31] she said she have got something she
[31:34] believe I should hear she asked if I
[31:38] would could hear
[31:39] it to my
[31:41] surprise she read the letter teed the
[31:45] High
[31:46] Calling pretending as though it was the
[31:48] first time I heard it I asked her where
[31:50] she got it my wife said from her dad
[31:54] which goes to the same church I go to I
[31:56] Knew knew it was God for me she was
[31:59] different her bitterness was not dear so
[32:01] I believe it was my breakthrough to
[32:03] press forward into my answered prayer
[32:06] which I did and receive my now restored
[32:09] marriage it may still not be all it
[32:11] could be but it's much better than it
[32:12] was before thank you Jesus brother
[32:15] Kristoff
[32:20] Maller he said I hope it helps someone
[32:23] to trust in Jesus too and this is his
[32:25] wife testimony while staying in my
[32:28] mother's house I really believed that my
[32:30] marriage was over but God had a plan for
[32:33] me praying was the hardest thing for me
[32:36] why because when I pray and I really
[32:38] pray and hurt and pain I felt I didn't
[32:40] want to feel it anymore one night I
[32:43] kneel down to pray and ask God I said
[32:45] Lord I know I'm not supposed to test you
[32:48] but I want to test you if it is wrong
[32:51] I'm sorry but I would like you to let me
[32:54] know you are here with me and you here
[32:56] in my pray prayer if that is so then
[33:00] tomorrow let my father come and bring or
[33:05] say something to me and I know that
[33:08] you're with me knowing my father don't
[33:12] really come to my mother's
[33:14] house so this is like provoking God this
[33:17] is something say you know I know this
[33:19] doesn't happen so Lord let it
[33:23] happen the next day I went out when I
[33:27] reach home around evening time my mother
[33:29] said to me NOA I have something for you
[33:31] to read she then went inside and get it
[33:34] for me before she read it she said your
[33:36] father brought it for you to read and
[33:39] said his Pastor read it on Sunday for
[33:40] the church it was the high calling when
[33:43] she finished read when she finished read
[33:45] it I told her about about the prayer I
[33:48] prayed to God and asked him for I knew
[33:50] that his presence was with me I read it
[33:52] twice again and something tell me to
[33:54] read it to my husband so when he called
[33:56] I asked him if I could read something to
[33:58] him he said yes my husband and I were
[34:00] separated for months in obedience to the
[34:02] voice I read it to him he was quite
[34:05] quiet and listening I knew I was ready
[34:07] to accept him back into my life and
[34:09] stand the trials and tribulation with
[34:11] Jesus at my side after reading a few
[34:13] days past he came by my mother and we
[34:14] talked since then we are together till
[34:16] now I can really say my my God is the
[34:19] author and finisher or when he join you
[34:22] together no man can put you
[34:25] aund
[34:28] I really wish I had the High Calling to
[34:31] read now but I don't have it at this
[34:34] time now we are not trying to
[34:36] spiritualize
[34:38] marriages but you may that you may
[34:41] understand God can use tragedies pain
[34:45] and suffering to set us into our
[34:49] destiny example
[34:51] Joseph Joseph his father openly loved
[34:54] him favored him gave him a special C
[34:57] quote and I wrote here Joseph was set up
[35:00] to be
[35:02] hated open love favored love special
[35:07] coat all his brothers seeing what the
[35:09] father doing I say he was set up to be
[35:13] hated plus Joseph had special dreams
[35:17] Brothers got jealous sold him to the
[35:20] Egyptians it brought pain lots of pain
[35:23] to Joseph pain to his father pain to his
[35:27] family but Joseph was about to be sent
[35:29] out into his purpose of God for his
[35:34] life
[35:36] question what do you have to thank God
[35:38] for in your
[35:40] husband don't
[35:42] answer I know some of you have a whole
[35:46] lot what have you to thank God for in
[35:48] your
[35:50] wife somebody say I have nothing like
[35:54] one woman complain my husband has come
[35:55] late late late at least he coming
[35:58] home some husband don't even come home
[36:00] at all some husband not even there so
[36:04] thank you Lord he comes
[36:14] home okay I got it here at the high
[36:17] calling so I think I'll read it what
[36:19] motivate them to respond and so on if
[36:22] God has called you to be really like
[36:23] Jesus in all your spirit He will draw
[36:25] you into a life of crucifixion humility
[36:28] and put on you such demands of obedience
[36:30] that he will not allow you to follow
[36:32] other Christians and in many ways he
[36:34] will seem to let other good people do
[36:37] things which he will not let you do
[36:39] other Christians and ministers who seem
[36:41] very righteous and useful may push
[36:43] themselves pull wires work schemes to
[36:46] carry out their plans but you cannot do
[36:48] it if you attempt it you will meet with
[36:51] such failing and rebuke from the Lord as
[36:53] to make you solely penitent others can
[36:55] brag on themselves on their work on
[36:57] their success on their wenss but the
[36:59] holy spirit will not allow you to do
[37:00] such a thing if you begin it he would
[37:03] lead you into such deep mortification
[37:05] that will make you despise yourself and
[37:07] all your good works others will be
[37:08] allowed to succeed in making good SS of
[37:10] money or having Legacy left for them or
[37:13] having luxuries but God May Supply you
[37:16] daily because he wants you to have
[37:18] something far better than gold that is
[37:20] helpess dependence on him that he may
[37:22] have the privilege of providing your
[37:25] needs day by day out of his unseen
[37:27] treasury the Lord may let others be
[37:29] honored and put forward and keep you hid
[37:32] away in obscurity because he wants to
[37:34] produce some Choice fragrant fruit for
[37:36] his coming Glory which can only be
[37:39] produced in the
[37:42] shade God will let others be great keep
[37:45] you small he will let others do work for
[37:48] him and get the credit for
[37:50] it but he will make you work and toil on
[37:53] without knowing how much you are doing
[37:55] and then to make your work still more
[37:57] precious he will let others get the
[37:58] credit for the work which you have done
[38:00] and this will make your reward 10 times
[38:02] greater when Jesus comes the holy spirit
[38:05] will put a strict watching you with a
[38:06] jealous love will rebuke you for little
[38:08] words and feelings or for wasting your
[38:11] time which other Christians never seem
[38:13] distressed over some make up your mind
[38:16] that God is infinite Sovereign and has a
[38:18] right to do as he pleases with his own
[38:20] and he will not explain to you a
[38:22] thousand things which will puzzle your
[38:24] reason in his dealings with you God will
[38:27] take you at your word and if you
[38:29] absolutely sell yourself out to be a
[38:30] slave he will wrap you up in jealous
[38:32] love and let others say and do many
[38:34] things that you cannot do or say settle
[38:36] it forever that you are to deal directly
[38:39] with the holy spirit that he is to have
[38:41] the privilege to tying your tongue and
[38:43] chaining your hand closing your eyes in
[38:45] ways that others are not dealt with now
[38:47] when you are so possessed with the
[38:49] Living God that you are in your secret
[38:52] heart pleased and delighted over this
[38:55] peculiar personal private jealous
[38:57] Guardianship and management of the Holy
[38:59] Spirit over your life you will have
[39:01] found the vestibule of Heaven oh is not
[39:07] wonderful so as we were saying what do
[39:09] you have to thank God for in your
[39:11] husband is he a provider thank god he's
[39:14] a provider he's not doing as well as he
[39:16] ought to thank God for what he's doing
[39:18] well
[39:19] in he's a companion maybe he's not
[39:22] talking much we going to get him to talk
[39:24] just now but that's still good he's
[39:26] doing something is not right what is it
[39:29] that you don't see that you can't praise
[39:31] value cherish admiring him or her what
[39:33] is right about her him what is right
[39:36] about her notice I didn't say what is
[39:37] bad about
[39:39] him he look stunned
[39:41] by what is right about her what is
[39:46] right it look people strain their mind
[39:49] but right did I hear right am I hearing
[39:52] right does he really means right yes I'm
[39:54] talking about right what is right about
[39:57] him there got to be something right
[39:58] about him because I mean that's your
[39:59] husband
[40:01] right that's your wife right you was
[40:04] once excited about her right her heart
[40:07] make your beat skip heart beat skip one
[40:10] time right now it might be skipping

[40:14] right now but it once upon a time it
[40:16] used to be your heart skip a beat once a
[40:19] time you open the door that's once now
[40:21] we tell you go around the other side
[40:23] used to be but there was once upon a
[40:26] time it was like that your whole hands
[40:28] walking in the pth now she walk and she
[40:30] walk and she walk and she walk some she
[40:31] in front you behind she be behind you in
[40:33] front but there was once upon a time
[40:35] there was romance once upon a time there
[40:36] was drama Once Upon a Time you wasn't
[40:38] afraid to put your hands around her once
[40:39] upon a time you can't tell last put your
[40:41] hands around her but that's going to
[40:42] come now because we're going to get down
[40:44] into it this we set in the background
[40:46] this going to be
[40:47] real
[40:49] Hallelujah God is
[40:52] real and marriage is great oh
[40:57] are we give a testimony
[40:58] [Applause]
[41:01] yet before you can honor
[41:04] praise please ensure that you're
[41:07] speaking the same
[41:11] language because this is very important
[41:14] if I
[41:19] say welcome that's French now if you
[41:22] understand French I catch you the words
[41:23] if you don't understand French they say
[41:24] what an earth is he talking well this
[41:27] happen in marriages the husband is
[41:29] speaking and the wife is saying what on
[41:32] Earth is he
[41:34] saying and when the husband talking what
[41:38] is he me so I mean I'm not getting him
[41:42] and he's not getting me now watch I'm
[41:45] not talking about talking I am talking
[41:48] about
[41:50] communicating it come like NASA have
[41:53] spacecraft I think one approaching Pluto
[41:54] right now to take pictures it was was
[41:56] sent about 11 or 9 years ago and they
[41:58] have all the systems to communicate is
[42:00] not they calling hello are you hearing
[42:03] me no no no it is communicating it's
[42:06] connections so communication is not
[42:08] words it's not talk a lot of men believe
[42:11] when they talk to the wife they have
[42:12] communicated to the my wife that's not
[42:14] true that's
[42:16] talk communication is when what you say
[42:19] and the meaning of what you say they get
[42:20] it the way you said
[42:22] it I'm not hearing
[42:25] you that's
[42:28] communication so the ability to get the
[42:31] other partner to understand clearly
[42:34] about what you love about
[42:36] life what you like what you love what
[42:40] you dislike what you care about the most
[42:45] getting to learn the language the
[42:48] husband speaks getting to learn the
[42:50] language the wife speaks then we could
[42:53] speak plainly we could communicate
[42:55] because what might be a joke to you
[42:57] might be a pain to to to your partner
[43:00] there are some people life for them is
[43:03] funny life for them is a bubble

[51:03] Artistic and your and and and your
[51:05] husband is not because what could work
[51:08] with that person with an artistic
[51:10] husband will not work with you with a

[51:45] investigative there is no perfect
[51:49] wife or perfect
[51:52] husband for
[51:54] you that is a myth and I want to destroy
[51:57] that Myth
[51:58] today there is no perfect husband or
[52:03] wife or rib or
[52:06] soulmate get over
[52:08] it you can learn to love you can grow in
[52:12] love and you could stay in love could we
[52:15] say
[52:18] Amen now imagine I went you all the
[52:21] personality type to say this I'm going
[52:23] to say now wo afterwards you'll dismiss
[52:27] all that personality thing when you
[52:29] finish here where we
[52:31] going Isaac and
[52:33] Rebecca did not take a personality test
[52:36] to sa the
[52:38] match she never saw Isaac
[52:41] before no picture on
[52:43] Facebook no
[52:45] emails no
[52:47] chats no
[52:50] messenger just a word from
[52:53] elazer no cour
[52:56] no dating yet it worked why why it
[52:59] worked the Bible is a Eastern book and
[53:03] the attitudes of wom at that time was a
[53:05] scriptural one in which here we go they
[53:09] respected the
[53:10] man and in return the man loved
[53:17] them the language of
[53:20] love to the man is translated as respect
[53:26] or respect is interpreted by the man as
[53:31] love from the
[53:34] woman marriage is a little more than
[53:37] finding the right person it is about you
[53:41] becoming the right person could somebody
[53:44] say amen hallelujah because it's it's
[53:49] bothersome when people fall in love see
[53:52] now that's the problem that's the easy
[53:53] one that's the easiest one one to fall
[53:56] in love as you fall in people can fall
[54:00] out I fall in love and guess what
[54:03] happened after 3 years fall out of love
[54:05] clean because you didn't get the
[54:07] opportunity to grow into love and then
[54:11] have that love just consumed and get
[54:14] both of you all glued together that
[54:16] nobody could come between you and your
[54:18] wife and you on your partner
[54:21] amen so
[54:24] watch
[54:26] marriage is a little more than finding
[54:27] the right person is about you becoming
[54:29] that right
[54:30] person and I want you to say this after
[54:32] me I am responsible I am responsible for
[54:36] becoming the right person for becoming
[54:38] the right person for my companion for
[54:41] say it again I am responsible I am
[54:43] responsible for becoming the right
[54:46] person the right for my
[54:49] companion all right I want to read that
[54:51] scripture again of Ephesians what we
[54:53] read but this time I want to read it
[54:55] from the
[54:56] Amplified be subject one another out of
[54:59] reverence for Christ the Messiah wives
[55:02] listen be subject be submissive and
[55:07] adapt yourselves to your own husband as
[55:11] a service to the Lord for the husband is
[55:13] the head of the wife as Christ is the
[55:15] head of the church as the church is
[55:18] subject to Christ so let the wives be
[55:20] subject in everything to their husbands
[55:22] husband love your wives as Christ loved
[55:25] the church and give himself up for her
[55:28] so that he might sanctify her having
[55:30] cleansed her by the washing of the water
[55:33] with the word that he might present uh
[55:37] uh the church to himself in glorious
[55:39] Splendor without spot a wrinkle or
[55:41] having such things she might be holy and
[55:42] faultless even so husband should love
[55:45] their wives being in a sense their own
[55:47] buddies he who loves his wife love
[55:49] himself for no man ever hat his own
[55:51] flesh but nourish it and cherish it and
[55:53] protect it so does Christ as the church
[55:55] for this reason shall a man leave his
[55:58] father and his mother and shall be
[55:59] joined to his wife and the two shall
[56:01] become one flesh this is a great mystery
[56:04] but I speak considering Christ and the
[56:07] church oh praise the Lord blessed be the
[56:11] name of the Lord all right however Let
[56:14] each man of you without exception love
[56:17] his wife being in a sense his very own
[56:20] self and let the wife see that she
[56:24] respects
[56:25] and reverence her husband listen that
[56:29] she notices him regards him honors him
[56:34] prefers him venerates esteems him that
[56:38] she defers to him Praises him loves and
[56:42] admires him
[56:44] exceedingly now you keep hearing we are
[56:47] promised another Ephesians right we are
[56:50] going back to the Fate another Ephesus
[56:53] another Ephesians if Ephesians holds the
[56:56] key to the Moder day dilemma of what
[57:00] ills
[57:01] marriages Ephesians says husband love
[57:05] your
[57:06] wives it never said wife love your
[57:10] husband strange isn't it it never say
[57:12] wife love your husband it say husband
[57:15] love your wives but it said
[57:19] wives reverence or respect your husband
[57:23] 1 Peter 3:1 says likewise he wives be in
[57:26] subject to your own
[57:27] husbands if any obey not the word that
[57:30] also May by the word be W by the
[57:32] conversation of the wise while they
[57:35] behold your Chase conversation coupled
[57:37] with fear let me read it and Amplified
[57:39] for you in like manner you married woman
[57:42] be submissive to your own husband
[57:44] subordinate yourselves as being
[57:46] secondary to dependent on them adapt
[57:49] yourself to them so that even if you do
[57:51] not obey the word of God they may be one
[57:53] over not by discussion but by The Godly
[57:57] lies of their wives when they observe
[58:00] the pure and modest way in which you
[58:02] conduct yourselves together with your
[58:04] reverence for your husband you are to
[58:07] feel for him all the reverence includes
[58:10] to respect defer honor esteem appreciate
[58:14] prize in the human sense to adore him
[58:17] admire praise be devoted to deeply love
[58:20] and enjoy your husband let not yours be
[58:23] merely external ad elaborate into
[58:25] weaving nothing of here wearing of
[58:27] jewelry change of clothes let it be the
[58:29] Inward adorning and the beauty of the
[58:31] Hidden person of the heart which is
[58:34] Incorruptible an unfaded charm of a
[58:36] gentle and peaceful Spirit which is not
[58:39] anxious or rough up but is precious in
[58:42] the sight of God for thus the pious
[58:45] woman of
[58:46] old who hoped in God were accustomed to
[58:49] beautify themselves and were submissive
[58:52] to their husband adapting them elves to
[58:55] them as themselves secondary and
[58:58] dependent upon them it was thus that
[59:01] Sarah obeyed Abraham following his
[59:04] guidance and acknowledging his headship
[59:06] over her by calling him Lord Master
[59:08] leader Authority and you are now true
[59:10] daughters if you do right and let
[59:12] nothing terrify you not giving away to
[59:15] hysterical fears of letting anxiety
[59:16] unnerve you in the same way you married
[59:19] men should live considerably with your
[59:21] wives with intelligent Rec nition of
[59:25] marriage relation honoring the woman as
[59:29] physically the weaker but realizing that
[59:31] you are joint ears of the grace of God's
[59:34] UNM merited favor of life yet this SP
[59:37] Brothers in order that your prayers may
[59:40] not be hindered and cut off in other
[59:42] words otherwise you cannot pray
[59:44] effectively so understand this this is
[59:46] very important and I'm so glad that you
[59:49] here because if you don't get it right
[59:51] your prayers will be affected as a man
[59:54] as a Son of God your prayer will not be
[59:57] effective so you have you have to have a
[1:00:00] desire by God's grace to get this right
[1:00:03] how do you respect a man you hear the
[1:00:06] word respect respect means to esteem
[1:00:09] Aspire admire think highly of hold in
[1:00:12] high regard to honor applaud praise
[1:00:17] favor so when you hear a wife say you
[1:00:20] you're looking for
[1:00:23] praise
[1:00:25] yes he's looking for praise he's not
[1:00:28] just looking for it he needs
[1:00:31] it I only hear one sister clapping
[1:00:33] that's my
[1:00:36] wife only one sister clap and that was
[1:00:39] my wife clapping
[1:00:41] there she's
[1:00:44] good she does give her man what he
[1:00:48] needs Oh Glory she's very good she's a
[1:00:53] wise woman all right all right do you
[1:00:56] praise
[1:00:57] him do you have a high opinion of
[1:01:01] him do you hold him in high
[1:01:05] regard you
[1:01:08] see your
[1:01:10] man your husband is not a woman who wear
[1:01:18] pants and your wife is not a man who
[1:01:21] does wear dress she is
[1:01:25] different and many men sometime they
[1:01:27] don't get that and many women don't get
[1:01:30] that they think the other half is one
[1:01:32] just like them who do understand
[1:01:35] them and they're trying to get them to
[1:01:38] understand what they are saying but they
[1:01:40] don't understand that I when I say that
[1:01:42] that man there is man m
[1:01:46] n your wife is not a man who we a dress
[1:01:50] many times you want your husband to
[1:01:52] think like you but he is not female male
[1:01:55] could somebody say
[1:01:57] Amen many husband want the wife to think
[1:02:00] like them but she is not
[1:02:03] male the Bible said respect the man if
[1:02:07] God said it and you do it you will get
[1:02:09] the benefit from
[1:02:11] it men are
[1:02:14] logical women are
[1:02:17] emotional I was reading and preparing
[1:02:20] this scientists have discovered that
[1:02:22] woman physically in their brain are wir
[1:02:26] different whatever the brains is as he
[1:02:28] this is and this is I'm not a scientist
[1:02:30] so I'll just generalize so recogn I'm
[1:02:32] not in that category their brains are
[1:02:35] different they are
[1:02:39] different okay I'm going to skip so men
[1:02:42] have what they call logical thinking and
[1:02:45] the moment are emotional
[1:02:48] thinking men respond to the gate of
[1:02:50] their
[1:02:51] eyes women through their ears what they
[1:02:55] hear and that is why man have fight and
[1:02:58] Tra with lust and all the advertisement
[1:03:02] you see wrong is some kind of half naked
[1:03:03] woman because they know men through the
[1:03:05] eye gate will respond and women will
[1:03:08] respond with their ears what they
[1:03:10] hear therefore here we go Brothers

[1:09:24] I got I got have to have a Brother's

[1:09:33] directly to their face they cheap on
[1:09:35] that amen what we talking about

[1:09:47] that we alive make life worth living
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:57] man and this thing struck
[1:10:01] me and it was such a blessing today I
[1:10:03] got a phone call from my brother and he
[1:10:04] was such a blessing to me didn't
[1:10:06] know because he gave such a witness to
[1:10:09] what I wanted to say today he tell me
[1:10:10] brother over he said I want to thank you
[1:10:12] for your ministry and helping his
[1:10:14] marriage and so on and he said his wife
[1:10:16] said something to him that blew him out
[1:10:19] sometime back really blew him out she
[1:10:22] said I think about you first I fold your
[1:10:26] clothes first I see about what for you
[1:10:29] first and I said she is showing you
[1:10:31] respect he said
[1:10:32] exactly and he you know it did something
[1:10:35] for him and he treat her differently
[1:10:37] after that and you could see from what
[1:10:40] the brother is saying it mean something
[1:10:44] to him and you know what strange enough
[1:10:48] that respect is what bugs so many
[1:10:52] women so many

[1:16:59] himself come and talk to Abraham you
[1:17:01] know ABR going talk to Sarah and Sarah
[1:17:03] say is that right look hagga
[1:17:07] there God tell you that look have a made
[1:17:09] there you know you know Abraham listened
[1:17:12] to to his wife isn't that funny that
[1:17:16] that man just hear from God and he just
[1:17:18] put God aside and just do what that
[1:17:20] woman tell him do that's that's kind of
[1:17:23] SC yeah but what I'm saying then she had
[1:17:27] influence if you have no influence you
[1:17:30] have some work to do all
[1:17:32] right but you see now we have women who
[1:17:35] figure the you know the equal status and
[1:17:39] and the figure that's the way go you

[1:17:47] you you supposed to be helping to your
[1:17:49] husband Bible didn't say the man going
[1:17:51] be helping to the woman you have it back
[1:17:53] to front you have it wrong you supposed
[1:17:56] to be help me to the man you supposed to
[1:17:58] be his assistant you supposed to be a
[1:18:01] help meet that you could help meet his
[1:18:02] needs and if you not meet his needs
[1:18:05] problems it come like a home a home a
[1:18:08] house supposed to be a refuge for a man
[1:18:11] it's supposed to be a place where you
[1:18:12] feel safe where a man want to come home
[1:18:15] it are some men who don't want to come
[1:18:16] home they work extra and over time no
[1:18:19] not I'm not hit it over time don't don't
[1:18:22] don't hit me anybody here extra overtime
[1:18:23] I'm not accusing you of anything I'm
[1:18:25] just making a point you have men who
[1:18:27] they would stay back lying with the boys
[1:18:29] a little bit because they know home is
[1:18:31] like a war
[1:18:32] zone when the home that a duck might be
[1:18:35] in Iraq and they ducking
[1:18:39] Baghdad so you you beat out yourself and
[1:18:42] then you ease yourself at home ease
[1:18:45] yourself at home but it's not supposed
[1:18:46] to be that it's supposed to be when the
[1:18:48] man come tired and weary he can't wait
[1:18:51] to see that lady standing on that door
[1:18:53] he can't wait to see a welcome sign a

[1:27:00] and honest with him with her a woman
[1:27:03] needs a man to talk to
[1:27:05] her I believe a woman shouldn't have to
[1:27:07] beg for finances for things that she
[1:27:10] needs she don't have to feel she's in a
[1:27:13] prison in your house are the mercies of
[1:27:16] what you have to give
[1:27:20] her if she have to beg for money and
[1:27:22] complain about money that you have power
[1:27:24] to give you as a man have blown
[1:27:27] it you have messed up is you have to beg
[1:27:32] and ask and fight for funds to buy the
[1:27:33] things the home needs to improve and
[1:27:35] make it better and you're in a position
[1:27:37] to do so and do not you are acting mean
[1:27:40] and you are outing the fire of her
[1:27:42] creativity to make the house a great
[1:27:46] home you see without that creative
[1:27:48] Spirit without that atmosphere is just
[1:27:51] for walls that two people living under
[1:27:55] roof that they're living under it's not
[1:27:57] a home it's a house and two people
[1:27:59] people live there and you can't
[1:28:01] understand why two of them on the edge
[1:28:03] of the bed and they facing each other
[1:28:07] they back each they facing each other
[1:28:08] back to
[1:28:14] back whether you say Amen or not doesn't
[1:28:17] matter I'm not going to ask for Amen on

[1:30:40] marriage the Bible said for this cause
[1:30:43] shall a man leave his mother and father
[1:30:48] and cleave to his wife
[1:30:52] and they shall become one
[1:30:55] flesh husbands and wives are directed to
[1:30:59] leave their fathers and mothers it does
[1:31:02] not make it doesn't mean to ignore
[1:31:05] abandon or
[1:31:07] forsake it does not mean that you must
[1:31:09] move away from the vicinity of your
[1:31:11] parents what it
[1:31:13] means is that the husband wife
[1:31:16] relationship is
[1:31:18] priority and your relationship with your
[1:31:20] parents have to take a back
[1:31:23] seat secondary to the relationship with
[1:31:25] your
[1:31:26] spouse it means that you are more
[1:31:29] concerned about your
[1:31:31] spouse opinions ideas and so forth than
[1:31:35] your
[1:31:36] parents it
[1:31:38] means you cannot try to change your
[1:31:41] husband or wife because your parents
[1:31:43] don't like this about him or this about
[1:31:45] her and your parents feel about this
[1:31:47] because once there is in-laws Outlaws
[1:31:50] men in-laws it will affect the
[1:31:52] opportunity to blend amen because it
[1:31:55] would have the influences that affects
[1:31:58] the marriage it have some men are Mommy
[1:32:01] boys they are mommy boys I don't know if
[1:32:05] there's any here but it have people are
[1:32:07] like that it have girls who are daddy
[1:32:11] girls and mmy boys sometimes Tak an
[1:32:13] inflence from their mother from his
[1:32:15] mother so into the marriage is what the
[1:32:17] mother say and the mother say and the
[1:32:19] mother say and the wife saying something
[1:32:21] too
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:23] like I always get trouble with brothers
[1:32:25] who will talk nice nice with everybody
[1:32:27] ex nice except their wife that's a
[1:32:29] problem with me Charity B is at home you
[1:32:31] had to be able to talk to her nice at
[1:32:33] home and everything else and it will
[1:32:35] reflect on the
[1:32:36] outside your husband line of respect is
[1:32:39] for somebody respect the pastor they
[1:32:40] respect the husband how how that could
[1:32:41] be your husband
[1:32:44] first and if he see you respecting
[1:32:46] somebody outside of him he feels the
[1:32:48] pressure as a man you're not supposed to
[1:32:50] tell any other woman what you haven't
[1:32:52] tell your
[1:32:53] wife as a woman you're not supposed to
[1:32:55] tell any person anything other than your
[1:32:58] husband you will just mess up you have
[1:33:02] to have their trust and confidence and
[1:33:05] let them protect

[1:33:20] nice because she that col enough for she
[1:33:24] that's for me to smell right on the job
[1:33:25] and for my
[1:33:27] wife are you with me you I'm saying so
[1:33:31] if somebody push and move I want my wife
[1:33:32] to know there's a character there on the
[1:33:35] job all right because she is the one
[1:33:38] there to protect what if I don't say
[1:33:41] what if she start to move now and I
[1:33:44] start to respond to that and next minute
[1:33:46] there's a hidden something is not clear
[1:33:48] it's not above board and next minute I
[1:33:50] find in fault with my wife and she don't
[1:33:51] know why I edgy and irritable and
[1:33:53] irritated and you have to complain about
[1:33:54] this and complaining about that and
[1:33:56] complain about yeah because somebody is
[1:33:57] screwing up outside of day and messing
[1:33:59] things up onside
[1:34:01] there so on my job I used to value my
[1:34:04] wife I said my wife is a Mercedes-Benz
[1:34:07] don't mess with me don't bring no Beetle
[1:34:09] and no bug and whatnot this guy is
[1:34:11] different alog together and her name
[1:34:13] she's precious and ask man job how is
[1:34:16] precious how is precious a valuer a
[1:34:18] cherisher when the teacher say oh look
[1:34:20] at that dress you know they talk about
[1:34:21] other workers and so I said it would
[1:34:22] look good on my wife that's who she is
[1:34:25] right I not I not congratulate nobody
[1:34:27] about all looking no that will look good
[1:34:28] on my wife my wife is the lady I don't
[1:34:31] care who's the best cook in the country
[1:34:33] and what not she's the best cook in I
[1:34:35] tell my wife every all the other food is
[1:34:36] to block a hole when she cooks that is
[1:34:39] food that is
[1:34:42] food that is food best cook in the
[1:34:45] country and you can't challenge that
[1:34:47] that's right because she's the best cook
[1:34:50] to me
[1:34:54] and I tell her she my mama
[1:34:58] guy but that's not true it do really
[1:35:01] taste good to
[1:35:03] me I tell her when I get her soup so she
[1:35:06] said other people canot cook soup like
[1:35:08] this best soup in the country now what
[1:35:11] do you tell your
[1:35:15] wife you got to tell her the right
[1:35:17] things she need to hear from you she
[1:35:20] need to hear certain words
[1:35:22] and that does what it's supposed to
[1:35:27] do it's almost
[1:35:29] done so there's a leaving that Adam must
[1:35:32] do your father and mother help you the
[1:35:35] other the people that you owe so much in
[1:35:38] life but then the Bible call you to
[1:35:41] leave to lose forsake depart why would
[1:35:45] God say
[1:35:47] that the home nurtured you prepared you
[1:35:50] confront of um comforted you and so on
[1:35:52] and yet you're called to leave why in
[1:35:56] order you cannot cleave until you leave
[1:35:58] your mother and father because that
[1:36:00] relationship affect with your
[1:36:03] bonding God is holding you as men
[1:36:06] accountable and your responsibilities
[1:36:08] your wife and your children isn't that
[1:36:10] right blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:36:14] friends let me say
[1:36:16] this we all come from broken homes
[1:36:19] healing is in Christ the word word amen
[1:36:22] the word is Ephesians amen for husband
[1:36:25] to love their wives for wives to respect
[1:36:28] their husband respect is to hold him in
[1:36:33] high esteem respects is to speak highly
[1:36:37] of him we must break the curse of a
[1:36:41] signing blame stop a signing blame I'm
[1:36:47] from a broken home my father wasn't a
[1:36:50] true father
[1:36:51] my mother was this my father was that my
[1:36:55] family is this way all of them is this
[1:36:57] way my mother acted this way my father
[1:37:00] acted this way you are assigning blame
[1:37:03] for your condition stop
[1:37:07] it life and marriages is about change
[1:37:11] you change from being
[1:37:13] single to be a couple you change you get
[1:37:17] a new name you take on your husband's
[1:37:19] name you change the that you cannot just
[1:37:22] make individual decisions because it
[1:37:25] affecting the partnership within the
[1:37:27] home you are committed in this
[1:37:30] relationship For Better or For Worse
[1:37:34] this is our first marriage seminar there
[1:37:37] are lots of things that I know that is
[1:37:41] outstanding and I wouldn't be able to
[1:37:42] get in today and I would share some of
[1:37:44] the things that I have written on
[1:37:46] here depleting the bank account of love
[1:37:49] romance respect kindness and Goodwill
[1:37:52] some people just draw down they only
[1:37:54] writing out checks they're taking all
[1:37:56] the benefits from off the marriage
[1:37:59] account and afterwards it's empty it's
[1:38:04] in red then when you make deposits it
[1:38:06] look so small you do something and
[1:38:07] you're looking for a praise from your
[1:38:08] wife and your wife G none and you're
[1:38:10] looking for a praise because things get
[1:38:13] so bad it's depleted how do we replenish
[1:38:16] the bank account of love and emotions
[1:38:19] love doesn't just stay love have to grow
[1:38:22] or love will
[1:38:23] die I want you to say a big Amen on that
[1:38:26] I have seen
[1:38:30] it people in love just two of them then
[1:38:33] one child comes on the attention shares
[1:38:37] no longer husband and wife no longer two
[1:38:39] it's three is a husband wife and a baby
[1:38:42] then another baby come along there's not
[1:38:44] three is
[1:38:46] four and as the attention gets divided
[1:38:50] time spent get
[1:38:51] less communic communication become less
[1:38:55] and and very slowly they drift
[1:38:59] apart they don't even know when they
[1:39:02] don't even know how they get so apart
[1:39:04] the silence no
[1:39:07] communication the wife screaming out for
[1:39:09] love and the husband doing like he don't
