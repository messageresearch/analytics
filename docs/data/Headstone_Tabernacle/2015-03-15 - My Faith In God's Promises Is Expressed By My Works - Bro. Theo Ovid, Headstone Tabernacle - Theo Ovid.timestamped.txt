[26:06] did before what about when the spirit
[26:08] comes upon you you you have things to do
[26:10] that you ain't even think about yet not

[27:24] and David was greatly distressed for the
[27:27] people spake of stone in him
[27:31] when you're having Victory people love

[29:27] about this morning we're gonna do

[29:33] we want to turn to the scriptures to
[29:35] James chapter 2
[29:37] you want to read from verse 15 to 26.

[30:31] reading James 2 reading from verse
[30:35] 15.
[30:40] if a brother or sister be naked and
[30:42] destitute of daily food and one of you
[30:44] saying to them departing peace be warmed
[30:48] and filled
[30:50] you're speaking the word
[30:53] notwithstanding you give them not those
[30:55] things which are needful to the body
[30:57] what does it profit
[30:59] even so feet
[31:01] if it had not works is dead being alone
[31:04] yeah a man may say thou has faith and I
[31:07] have worked show me thy faith without
[31:08] thy works and I will surely my faith by
[31:11] my Works don't believe us that there is
[31:15] one God they'll do us well the devil
[31:17] also believe and tremble
[31:18] but will though no oven man that faith
[31:21] without books is dead was that Abraham
[31:23] or father justified by works when he had
[31:25] offered Isaac and his son upon the altar
[31:28] seeing thou how Faith wrought with his
[31:31] works and by works was Fit made perfect
[31:34] and the scripture was fulfilled with
[31:37] said Abraham believed God
[31:39] and it was imputed unto him for
[31:41] righteousness and he was called a friend
[31:44] of God you see them how thereby Works a
[31:48] man is Justified and not by faith only
[31:50] likewise also was not rehabbed the halot
[31:53] justified by works when she had received
[31:55] the messengers and had sent them out
[31:58] another way for as the body without the
[32:00] spirit is dead so feet without works is
[32:04] death also I read it from Saint John
[32:07] chapter 4.
[32:10] excuse me
[32:12] I want to read from one verse 34.
[32:16] and this is Jesus disciples just before
[32:19] they came and said Master eat he said I
[32:23] have me to eat that you know love
[32:26] and then we'll study for Jesus said my
[32:28] meat is to do the will of him that sent
[32:31] me and to finish his work let's pray
[32:33] father we thank you for your word
[32:35] interpret it to our hearts inspired the
[32:37] word to your people and made us be a
[32:39] life-changing service Lord May no one
[32:41] leave it the same way they came but may
[32:44] the word be effective to them in their
[32:48] spirits in their heart and may the word
[32:49] become flesh I may have confirmly with
[32:52] signs wonders and miracles May the
[32:54] anointed me so powerful that when they
[32:56] leave here it will go in their cars it
[32:59] will go in their houses it will go on
[33:01] the job wherever they go it will go with
[33:03] them and give them tremendous victory in
[33:06] GSM I ask it amen and amen you will be
[33:09] seated who prays the name of the Lord
[33:12] blessed be the name of the Lord I have a
[33:14] title
[33:15] my faith in God's promises
[33:18] is expressed by my works my faith in
[33:23] God's promises is expressed by my works
[33:28] and I have an inspiration doing all we
[33:32] can do
[33:33] now last week's the title was let us
[33:36] provoke one another to love and good
[33:38] works
[33:40] and we asked a question who is
[33:43] responsible for the bride seventh and
[33:46] the Revival and I brought it to the part
[33:48] that you must play but there's a path
[33:50] that the Ministers of the play and
[33:53] there's a part that God has to play so
[33:55] all together is what going to produce
[33:57] that bride's Revival
[33:59] isn't that right and I have a thought I
[34:02] thought of God expect results
[34:05] an action is caused action don't just
[34:10] happen action is caused and today I want
[34:14] to introduce a new word which is like
[34:16] opposite to action that is caused and
[34:19] that new word is inertia
[34:21] i n e r t i a inertia and we're going to
[34:25] find out a little bit in a while what
[34:27] that is
[34:28] now I just have this written in my
[34:31] commission this is me
[34:34] is to go into all the world and preach
[34:36] the gospel
[34:38] that is the instructions that Jesus have
[34:40] given us
[34:41] so on the fields I know I'm in the will
[34:45] of God
[34:46] and but around say one once a minister
[34:48] is on the fields he is in the will of
[34:50] God
[34:51] now I know I could stay in The Newsroom
[34:54] and give comments on what is happening
[34:57] on the Battlefront
[34:58] because that is what Newsroom people do
[35:00] sometimes they have hurricane and
[35:02] earthquake and different things and
[35:03] somebody outside in a hurricane and
[35:05] they're reporting to headquarters and
[35:07] the person in the studio they're not
[35:08] getting wet they are commenting on who
[35:12] is getting wet outside the deal and they
[35:13] said now we have a report from so and so
[35:16] on they could talk and sometimes they
[35:17] have a big table and the son talking to
[35:19] this one and this one talking this one
[35:20] but they're not in the hurricane place
[35:22] they're not getting wet they're not
[35:23] feeling the breeze nothing in the storm
[35:25] they're just commenters or talkers or
[35:28] just uh yeah that's all I'm saying I
[35:30] wasn't ordained to be in The Newsroom
[35:33] praise God I wasn't ordained to be in
[35:35] the commentary box I wasn't ordained to
[35:38] be a wrong Morning Edition around a
[35:40] table and people sitting on a couch and
[35:42] this cuspect is happening no no no no I
[35:44] am going to be on the battlefield
[35:46] for my Lord
[35:48] Hallelujah are you with me so therefore
[35:52] there are three kind of people those who
[35:54] are wondering what is happening those
[35:56] who are watching what is happening and
[35:58] those are the commentators they're in
[36:00] the box they're watching what is
[36:01] happening and the last bunch is the part
[36:03] that I am in those who are causing
[36:05] things to happen don't you've got to
[36:09] pick your sluck you got to pick what you
[36:11] want to be identified but because
[36:13] everybody gonna be identified one way or
[36:16] the other or give the Lord some Praises
[36:18] people
[36:19] hallelujah it's not something
[36:23] so you have always heard about the tax a
[36:26] tax that was supposed to be done
[36:28] and everybody had a chance to do it
[36:30] anybody could have done it somebody
[36:32] thought anybody will do it but in the
[36:34] end nobody did it so everybody is
[36:36] looking for anybody and anybody thought
[36:39] somebody was going to do it so we don't
[36:41] want to be anybody and everybody and
[36:43] somebody know somebody gonna do the task
[36:45] because Jesus said my meat is to do the
[36:48] will of him that sent me and to finish
[36:49] the work God will just have things God
[36:52] will just have talk God have things to
[36:55] fulfill
[36:59] is this when God speaks to a man he give
[37:02] that man ambition and purpose
[37:04] two things
[37:06] you give that man ambition and purpose
[37:08] and when that man gets Revelation one
[37:10] evidence you're going to see is two
[37:12] things you're going to see humility
[37:14] and fearlessness Oh Glory to God could
[37:18] we give the Lord some amens but because
[37:20] the Lord I shout when God speaks to a
[37:23] man he gave him ambition and purpose and
[37:26] after that when God reveals himself you
[37:28] will see two things a humble man and a
[37:31] man praise God with a tries
[37:34] Hallelujah Fearless because he has been
[37:38] in the presence of God and he has heard
[37:40] from The Lord Oh Glory to God that's
[37:43] when Elijah stumbled he said not even
[37:45] due or rain will fall till I call for it
[37:48] I don't care what the weather is saying
[37:50] I don't care what the weather man is
[37:51] saying I don't care what the people are
[37:53] saying I shut up heavens and you are
[37:56] awake till I call for it to get the rain
[37:58] that you're looking for I stop your
[38:01] blessings I stop the anointing I stop
[38:04] everything Hallelujah Heaven is short
[38:06] until I call
[38:10] cinnamon
[38:11] yes from God oh Hallelujah
[38:16] are we coming to crunch time now this is
[38:18] when the tire
[38:24] hit a solution hope you be part of the
[38:26] problem because if you're not part of
[38:28] the solution you are simply part of the
[38:30] very problem itself but Jesus said my
[38:33] meat is to do the will of him that sent
[38:35] me and to finish the work he just
[38:37] finished handling the woman at the well
[38:38] all glory the God he said the disciples
[38:41] because he couldn't let them see what he
[38:42] was about to do he was about to call a
[38:44] name in the book and he had to push them
[38:46] guys away to always they get to speak to
[38:49] this woman and God will push this one
[38:50] away and push that one away to get to
[38:52] speak to you God will make sure you're
[38:54] in the right place and the right time to
[38:56] hear the right message come on shame man
[38:58] somebody got gonna make sure
[39:03] because you have to hear from God you
[39:06] must you must hear from God hallelujah
[39:10] you see it has been soon emphasized so
[39:12] much about ministers and ministers I
[39:14] have to push that straight into a corner
[39:20] no to bring it into a balance
[39:22] have been too much about men
[39:24] and men have just messed up
[39:27] Hallelujah but a real man messed up is
[39:29] not not the bad part you know yeah
[39:32] because in the Bible the fundament
[39:34] messed up but you know man uh who is
[39:37] real man man of God I should say they
[39:40] accept responsibility they don't blame
[39:43] they accept responsibility and they deal
[39:45] with where they messed up they confront
[39:47] but where they messed up they will
[39:49] handle where they messed up messed up as
[39:50] part of the package but is if you're
[39:52] gonna handle with what you're wearing
[39:53] messed up oh God because somebody say
[39:55] Amen oh praise the name of the Lord so
[39:59] when God tells you something you have
[40:01] got to do it
[40:02] nobody else that's a quote when God
[40:05] tells you something you have got to do
[40:07] it nobody else oh we have to face up to
[40:10] it and do it it's our responsibility so
[40:13] that's why I challenge you to provoke
[40:14] one another not a rat not the anger not
[40:17] the backslide but the love and the good
[40:19] works come on you could make it not to
[40:21] talk not the yap yap yap yap yap we had
[40:24] it for 40 years works

[41:13] said I require at the hands of those
[41:15] pastors who did not feed my flock and
[41:18] who fed themselves and did not feed the
[41:21] sheep they will unsuffer that my sheep

[43:42] understand the beat that your past is in
[43:44] he's not trying to please anybody
[43:50] Hallelujah I'm not accountable to any

[48:42] blood when that sun
[48:44] had come to the age of 21 we call it a
[48:46] day
[48:47] if the tutor had brought with to the
[48:49] father and told him everything was fine
[48:51] this boy was a gallant man he was
[48:54] zealous here we go
[48:56] of the father's Kingdom
[48:58] not just you know
[49:01] uh
[49:02] I don't even know my father businesses
[49:06] Jesus could have said that when he was
[49:07] five years old he said I am about
[49:10] my father's business now if you are both
[49:14] your father's business it means you have
[49:15] to know the father's business
[49:17] you're getting a revelation of the
[49:18] father's will to execute the father's
[49:21] plan for business because son has to be
[49:23] approved you can't be doing nothing and
[49:25] get approval there's an approval for
[49:27] nothing
[49:28] your holy ghost telling you all for
[49:30] nothing how was he he did nothing he
[49:33] prayed nothing he worshiped nothing he
[49:35] actually did nothing he just came and
[49:37] occupied a seat in church and worship
[49:39] sometimes according to how he felt he
[49:42] was never interested in seeking the
[49:43] father's business and reading a word to
[49:45] get the father's will for his life
[49:48] now watch watch that he was jealous of
[49:51] the father Kingdom and he'd done all
[49:53] here we go
[49:55] he's done all he could to improve and
[49:58] embedded the kingdom
[50:00] that is what the father is looking for
[50:03] Hallelujah to see the sons that want to
[50:06] improve and embitter the kingdom they
[50:10] father take him out in the pub
[50:13] that means every true ordained
[50:16] predestinated Ministry of God
[50:19] must become publicly identified
[50:26] it can't be hidden in the corner
[50:29] hiding under bushel saying God is with
[50:32] me
[50:33] no some point in time God himself will
[50:36] take the mask off of all of that
[50:39] he will push you into the position where
[50:42] you have to be public
[50:44] ified
[50:45] his son
[50:50] Jesus had 18 years of Silence but when
[50:54] the silence was about to be broken God
[50:56] loose John the Baptist to make a way for
[51:00] that announcement that the sun is about
[51:02] to comfort so when John the Baptist here
[51:05] Behold the Lamb of God God was ready to
[51:07] say this is my beloved Son
[51:10] and whom I'm pleased to publicly
[51:12] identify myself with
[51:15] come on same as somebody
[51:18] pull him out from the bunch I'm gonna
[51:21] pull him out from the rest and let the
[51:23] world know I'm with him oh give the Lord
[51:25] a shout to praise people that's what God
[51:28] gonna do for you one day that's what God
[51:30] is about to do for you maybe today
[51:34] they got fire that love of
[51:36] identification gonna come down upon your
[51:38] life
[51:39] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:41] hallelujah
[51:43] are you ready
[51:45] the father take them out into a public
[51:47] place set him up before the public
[51:50] his same son
[51:53] that have been born in his home years
[51:56] before
[51:57] all the time is sun here we go but his
[52:01] character and his conduct had brought
[52:04] him to another office
[52:07] notice not his sermons not his mighty
[52:13] Revelation an unfolding of many hidden
[52:17] mysteries
[52:19] no his
[52:22] character and his conduct had brought
[52:26] him into another office
[52:29] or position
[52:31] so all these messages is only part of it
[52:41] so God is not so much interested in The
[52:44] Newsroom dictation and reading the
[52:46] script over the prompt screen
[52:48] ah something kind of good behind Helen
[52:52] has the news coming in the slitting the
[52:55] news station she's reading off of a
[52:57] screen
[52:59] this has happened that has happened you
[53:01] can't get character reading off a screen
[53:04] you read the news
[53:05] in The Newsroom to get character you
[53:08] have to get out The Newsroom
[53:11] I'm not hearing you
[53:12] I am not hearing you reading quotes that
[53:15] come back The Newsroom but when you
[53:18] loosed into the situations and you could
[53:21] come true
[53:23] oh hallelujah hallelujah my God because
[53:28] character is a victory
[53:30] glory to God you've got to overcome
[53:32] something that means god does designed
[53:35] conflict we need conflict we need
[53:38] battles we need sword fighting we need
[53:42] issues because that is our character
[53:44] comes forward
[53:46] foreign
[53:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[53:56] Hallelujah
[53:57] I told them in Europe there are plenty
[53:59] of people who don't like battles
[54:01] they do like confusion they don't like
[54:03] to hurt anyone
[54:05] distilled anyone
[54:07] so they have no stand
[54:09] they don't even have a sit they stand
[54:12] for nothing
[54:14] they have no witness in their mouth
[54:16] they please everybody
[54:18] they take no signs
[54:21] they hurt nobody they end up additional
[54:24] dish right I want the whole world to
[54:26] know what side I'm on
[54:28] I'm on the side of the word
[54:30] I will stand with any man who's with the
[54:32] word he don't even have to believe all
[54:34] that I believe but as much as he
[54:36] believed I will stand by him
[54:38] because the word is God I am not the
[54:41] revealer of the word the Holy Ghost is
[54:43] and if the Holy Ghost don't reveal it to
[54:45] that brother he can't get it
[54:47] because every man must Minister
[54:49] according to the grace and faith that
[54:52] God give that man and if God gave me
[54:54] this small measure and give somebody a
[54:57] bigger measure God bless them but you
[54:59] see this little measure I have I'm going
[55:01] to use it because that's the measure God
[55:04] gave me
[55:07] foreign

[55:14] sword some with nice Hilt some with

[59:24] son
[59:26] restoration oh hallelujah hallelujah
[59:51] foreign
[59:58] Behavior
[59:59] brought him into another position
[1:00:02] inertia
[1:00:05] that's stupid that would call it nature
[1:00:07] last week he did about action scores
[1:00:09] wanna deal with another word what called
[1:00:11] inertia
[1:00:12] inertia is a tendency
[1:00:14] to do nothing
[1:00:16] or remain unchanged
[1:00:20] it speaks of inactivity
[1:00:22] passivity
[1:00:24] stagnation
[1:00:25] idleness
[1:00:27] sluggishness
[1:00:29] lethargy
[1:00:31] popidity
[1:00:33] indolence laziness
[1:00:37] and thoughtfulness
[1:00:38] that is
[1:00:40] inertia
[1:00:41] in physics
[1:00:43] it is a property of matter
[1:00:45] by which it continues in existing state
[1:00:49] of rest
[1:00:51] or uniform motion in a straight line
[1:00:55] unless that state is changed by an
[1:00:57] external Force
[1:01:01] so in inertia means when that comes to
[1:01:04] arrest it steers rest it don't move it
[1:01:09] is rested nothing change it inertia
[1:01:12] means when it comes to your lower line
[1:01:14] it says straight line so same speed same
[1:01:17] time same channel no change whatsoever
[1:01:21] 20 years no change 30 years no change
[1:01:24] it's the inertia I come to challenge
[1:01:27] that break that bust that rip into that
[1:01:30] shut down that act on his cause it means
[1:01:34] that could just happen we are here to
[1:01:36] cause something to happen the properly
[1:01:39] think about wrapping straight up in the
[1:01:40] air and don't come a whirlwind hold
[1:01:43] Hallelujah
[1:01:50] you'll be seated
[1:01:53] the tendency of a body
[1:01:55] to preserve its state of rest
[1:01:58] or uniform motion unless
[1:02:01] acted upon by an external Force says if
[1:02:07] love don't get you desperate
[1:02:10] the external force will
[1:02:15] also carries lack of movement
[1:02:18] or activity when movement or activity is
[1:02:22] wanted or needed
[1:02:24] a feeling of not having the energy
[1:02:28] or this
[1:02:30] that is needed to move
[1:02:32] or change
[1:02:35] one of the saddest thing for me as a
[1:02:37] pastor is to talk to Christians who
[1:02:40] don't want to change
[1:02:43] they are religious and they are
[1:02:45] spiritual but not happy
[1:02:48] spiritual at least I think they are
[1:02:49] spiritual but it is contented spiritual
[1:02:53] thing because there's prayer and they
[1:02:55] love Jesus
[1:02:59] but the thing to move them to where
[1:03:01] they're supposed to go
[1:03:04] they're not moving because this is all I
[1:03:06] was with all these years
[1:03:10] you call that
[1:03:12] inertia
[1:03:14] this is what I know and change is always
[1:03:17] hard
[1:03:19] Hallelujah
[1:03:21] Oh Glory
[1:03:22] Hallelujah
[1:03:24] Moses know what Wilderness but you know
[1:03:26] what landline Joshua was the man was the
[1:03:29] land man Moses was pushed out into the
[1:03:31] wilderness and there's a beautiful
[1:03:33] scripture where jecho take him and lead
[1:03:35] him and she was seen about Jethro sheep
[1:03:38] leading sheep you think Moses know he
[1:03:41] had to lead all them bunch of people out
[1:03:42] there Moses were even think about going
[1:03:43] back and then leading sheep so God had
[1:03:46] to strip him humble him give him an
[1:03:48] experience not knowing all of this is
[1:03:51] background for what he is going to do
[1:03:55] what if Moses said I you know who I am
[1:03:57] Joshua
[1:03:59] come on
[1:04:00] former Prince of Egypt and Joshua said
[1:04:03] correct former
[1:04:05] go and see body sheep
[1:04:09] they will come and claim your former
[1:04:11] power that's what you used to have this
[1:04:13] is not Egypt you're in my territory
[1:04:16] and you see my daughter there she's a
[1:04:18] nice lady
[1:04:21] so relax yourself settle down
[1:04:24] and he gets settled down
[1:04:25] leading sheep
[1:04:27] no burden for Egypt they're on their own
[1:04:30] back there until the Lord called out to
[1:04:33] him
[1:04:34] in the burden Bush but before God called
[1:04:37] unto him that God sent the attraction to
[1:04:40] see if he will turn aside and see and
[1:04:42] the Bible said when he turned inside the
[1:04:43] sea because some people are even telling
[1:04:45] aside they're so fixed in their ways in
[1:04:47] inertia all kind of things happening
[1:04:49] around them but they're going down one
[1:04:51] way one way one way you got to turn some
[1:04:54] point in time I hope this service is a
[1:04:56] turning point a change in point a
[1:04:58] different kind of point
[1:05:00] foreign
[1:05:08] aside to see
[1:05:10] what God is trying to tell you because
[1:05:12] he wants you to live on if your mind is
[1:05:14] crippled up your spirit is crippled up
[1:05:16] you you crippler
[1:05:20] you decide to see
[1:05:22] I went to another see God spoke to Moses
[1:05:24] and said Moses time up fella
[1:05:27] head down to Egypt
[1:05:29] new commission for you
[1:05:31] Hallelujah go down and bring the people
[1:05:33] out Hallelujah Moses started to make
[1:05:35] excuses lord I can't talk like you know
[1:05:38] what it is I settled down right now I
[1:05:39] get new furniture I have a new tent
[1:05:42] I have new goats I have a whole fresh
[1:05:45] block of sheep and sworn and lambs and
[1:05:47] so on but business going well good God
[1:05:49] said you didn't hear what I said do I
[1:05:51] have to repeat myself
[1:05:52] a pack-up shop and head down to Egypt
[1:05:55] and bring my people out
[1:05:57] then when Moses started to accept watch
[1:05:59] that word accept now accept that there's
[1:06:01] nobody else could do what he has to do
[1:06:03] and when you begin to accept that nobody
[1:06:05] else could do what you are to do stop
[1:06:08] running
[1:06:10] and accept responsibility that you have
[1:06:13] got a job
[1:06:14] Hallelujah
[1:06:18] when when Moses recognized God not
[1:06:21] taking No Excuses he wanted to talk
[1:06:23] differently and who shall I season me
[1:06:29] who who who because this is both of us
[1:06:31] talking here now but when I get down
[1:06:33] here I mean
[1:06:36] what I will tell them
[1:06:37] you should tell them I am
[1:06:39] tell them I am that I am sent you
[1:06:43] you're so someone said God
[1:06:46] not tell his wife uh
[1:06:51] we go in Egypt
[1:06:56] when a month from now no tomorrow
[1:07:04] you think Egypt is 24 hours
[1:07:07] is not a train ticket
[1:07:10] it's a long journey there and you had to
[1:07:13] come over one time and you know I mean
[1:07:15] God have a right timing for everything
[1:07:17] else when everybody come in with a gifts
[1:07:19] and so on they want to know what Moses
[1:07:20] bringing because those days Egypt was
[1:07:22] the place all modern technology there

[1:07:28] big players super plays Super country
[1:07:31] they were the Metropolis in that time
[1:07:34] and everybody bringing homemade to Egypt

[1:08:54] second they shall recover all right
[1:08:58] Glory
[1:09:04] that they interrupted Egypt
[1:09:07] the custom getting natural gifts all
[1:09:09] kind of bongs and work and things like
[1:09:11] that but then let's get a word
[1:09:13] if you ever say what is this

[1:09:25] throw it on the ground
[1:09:26] to shoot a Dean Spirit into
[1:09:30] sticks turn to snakes
[1:09:32] but Moses met snakes along the way
[1:09:35] in Egypt in the wilderness so he he
[1:09:38] accustomed with snakes if he never saw a
[1:09:40] snake before
[1:09:42] Moses get frightened but Moses are

[1:10:42] you may be seated understand this the
[1:10:45] devil can't get stronger the devil has
[1:10:48] always been the devil but we can get
[1:10:50] stronger
[1:10:52] come on Israel Give the Lord a shout the
[1:10:56] devil can't get stronger but we can
[1:11:05] Glory
[1:11:07] Hallelujah
[1:11:09] you may be Caesar
[1:11:11] so I want you to move
[1:11:13] from this inertia
[1:11:15] from this continue along the same path
[1:11:18] and get into activity
[1:11:21] into movement
[1:11:23] into becoming a Dynamo because from that
[1:11:26] narrative is where you get the word
[1:11:28] dynamics come from
[1:11:30] Dynamo is to be in constant motion to
[1:11:33] produce a result
[1:11:35] isn't that right you got to have a
[1:11:38] movement in order to get something going
[1:11:40] for you you've got to have a Stern up a
[1:11:43] worship up a praise up you've got to do
[1:11:46] something Jesus said the works that I do
[1:11:49] shall you do also we are talking about
[1:11:52] words let's call it this way we talk
[1:11:55] enough I said talk done
[1:11:59] glory to God we're gonna do something
[1:12:02] about all this talk that we talk that's
[1:12:05] why we're having a prayer line next week
[1:12:10] we are we are serving notice that we are
[1:12:13] going to do more than just preach we're
[1:12:14] gonna pray we're going to cast Devils
[1:12:16] out we are saying it before it happened
[1:12:18] we are going to heal the sick yes
[1:12:22] we have authority to do that
[1:12:25] yes
[1:12:27] how many believe that
[1:12:32] my God
[1:12:34] all right
[1:12:36] so it works but around them preached his
[1:12:39] feet expressed Works show that faith has
[1:12:43] already took a whole and Paul wrote
[1:12:46] about Josephine Abraham by what God saw
[1:12:49] in Abraham which is Faith and James
[1:12:52] Justified Abraham by works and people
[1:12:54] thought it was a conflict or argument
[1:12:56] but then the prophet brought out that
[1:12:59] one was what God sees and the other is
[1:13:02] what man sees so the thing of it is this
[1:13:04] if you claim to have faith that's what
[1:13:06] God sees they have to be Works to prove
[1:13:09] and bring evidence of the faith that you
[1:13:12] claim to have and if the word is
[1:13:14] bringing fit to you there got to be
[1:13:16] evidence by your work by your life by
[1:13:19] your action and attitude that faith is
[1:13:21] truly taken a hole so if we don't see a
[1:13:23] behavior that matches up with the faith
[1:13:25] you claim then you maybe don't have the
[1:13:27] faith that you claim because once that
[1:13:30] Faith inside you take a hole there's a
[1:13:32] behavior that goes with it the Bible
[1:13:34] said Abraham started not at the promise
[1:13:36] of God through unbelief but was strong
[1:13:38] in faith giving praise to God so when
[1:13:41] Faith take a whole it gives praises the
[1:13:43] evidence of faith is the ability to
[1:13:45] worship because you can't be condemned
[1:13:48] and worshiped so when all condemnation
[1:13:50] is ripped out of you Faith taking hold
[1:13:53] of you going to give God praise because
[1:13:55] faith is saying it's already done
[1:13:58] yeah
[1:14:00] see it have no need to be worried
[1:14:04] because faith is the very substance of
[1:14:07] what you're hoping for
[1:14:10] eign
[1:14:34] a while ago he's depressed
[1:14:37] he is struggling and after God speak to
[1:14:40] him he's smiling his wife is not there
[1:14:42] yet but he's smiling he's sure but he's
[1:14:45] smiling the people has not returned yet
[1:14:47] but he is smiling why faith is the
[1:14:49] victory
[1:14:50] and Faith listen is a revelation from
[1:14:53] God
[1:15:01] that's why people love group Revelation
[1:15:03] they like to hide because it saves them
[1:15:06] the burden of seeking God it saves them
[1:15:08] but guess what that's a group thing
[1:15:10] I'm fit never belongs to a group
[1:15:13] said never God never give a group a
[1:15:16] revelation so when the pastors mess up
[1:15:19] the people and indoctrinize them for a
[1:15:21] personal gain manipulate them all the
[1:15:23] group the whole bunch saying the same
[1:15:25] thing
[1:15:27] and sometimes the word of God
[1:15:29] that's why Jesus
[1:15:31] some say that man always have opinions
[1:15:34] men always have interpretation men
[1:15:36] always have ideas I could do what other
[1:15:38] brothers doing
[1:15:44] he said the reason we can't be placed is
[1:15:47] because this one want to do what I want
[1:15:48] doing so God blessing the brother with
[1:15:50] corn and everyone on the plant corn too
[1:15:52] God say you're the quarter plant corn
[1:15:54] your land is not a corn land your land
[1:15:57] is to go grass to feed the sheep
[1:15:59] draw your grass and feed your sheep
[1:16:01] let that everybody see what is called
[1:16:04] come on say Amen somebody say God give
[1:16:06] me corn leave me with my corn
[1:16:17] don't interfere with me messing with the
[1:16:21] wrong guy oh Hallelujah
[1:16:24] foreign
[1:16:38] it was a great thing to do as it was
[1:16:40] happening too why it was God listen
[1:16:43] revealing himself to individuals
[1:16:46] yet was 120 in the upper room but was
[1:16:50] God here we go revealing himself to
[1:16:52] individuals noting it wasn't a group
[1:16:55] baptism everybody get the liquor fire
[1:17:00] the Bible said tongues of fire sat on
[1:17:03] each and every one of them everyone got
[1:17:06] their portion
[1:17:10] so when Mary got abortion she didn't
[1:17:12] feel let the preach
[1:17:16] she feel led to make a nice apple pie
[1:17:19] you know something
[1:17:20] all right
[1:17:22] so the anointing have to come
[1:17:25] to produce what God Said supposed to
[1:17:27] produce okay now here we go here we go
[1:17:29] Noah Works expressed a man what his
[1:17:33] faith was in God's promise
[1:17:35] they couldn't see Noah's fate they could
[1:17:37] see him building an arc so man could see
[1:17:39] wait a minute he's serious he is asking
[1:17:42] upon what he believed now here we go
[1:17:43] David a Shepherd sling expressed to the
[1:17:45] whole Israel army the faith he had in
[1:17:48] their God
[1:17:48] notice when it's revealed David become
[1:17:52] Fearless
[1:17:55] so when I see people frightened and
[1:17:56] scared when I say mirrors are shaking
[1:17:58] and they're saying things because they
[1:18:00] don't want to upset the apple card
[1:18:03] I know they do have a religion
[1:18:06] they're just following
[1:18:08] you see because they don't want to be
[1:18:10] punished
[1:18:13] because the food bowl might be taken
[1:18:16] away
[1:18:17] and they crack the preaching the
[1:18:19] convention
[1:18:23] and if they need the attention of a
[1:18:27] convention they have to conform
[1:18:30] to the group theology
[1:18:33] to fit in
[1:18:35] but you know what the people have been
[1:18:37] denied genuine operation of gifts to
[1:18:41] minister effectively to the people
[1:18:44] by people trying to tell them what to
[1:18:46] preach and what inspiration to preach we
[1:18:48] don't need all of that all of us are
[1:18:50] different Anthony's different from Isaac

[1:19:23] one and help that one and help that one
[1:19:26] we need help
[1:19:35] I'll keep reading over and over I read
[1:19:37] for you he said the Revelation and the
[1:19:39] Hidden Mysteries are for us to be able
[1:19:41] to know how to bring the members of our
[1:19:44] body in subjection to the word to know
[1:19:47] to conduct ourselves the message is not
[1:19:49] to just argue and talk about we have
[1:19:50] Mysteries I know more than you I am a
[1:19:52] Russian than you I deeper than you I
[1:19:54] liked it on you I floated on you
[1:20:00] a man
[1:20:02] what if I come and tell you this one
[1:20:04] Falls that one false that will never
[1:20:05] fall down for dismiss our fault that
[1:20:07] means our fault that is our fault you
[1:20:09] know why you're doing there I'm messing
[1:20:11] everybody up I'm showing you I am the
[1:20:13] man
[1:20:14] no I'm not saying that
[1:20:16] Direct
[1:20:18] I am seizing that at the subconscious
[1:20:20] level by messing everybody up like
[1:20:23] spoiling that off that off that off that
[1:20:25] off and the way I off at the weight all
[1:20:27] them off because I seen them off so they
[1:20:29] are off
[1:20:30] and if they are off I have to be on
[1:20:34] no that's that's wrong
[1:20:36] that's just plain wrong
[1:20:39] this church have faults of course these
[1:20:41] are false this church is open
[1:20:44] critic out there sitting listening to
[1:20:46] these services I don't like that I don't
[1:20:48] like that he could have said that he
[1:20:49] could have said that of course I can say
[1:20:50] that by not saying that I can't say what
[1:20:53] you think I see now there come and say
[1:20:55] it for me send it for me for me to say
[1:20:57] it so anybody can say what they want
[1:20:59] because what we are saying we have no
[1:21:01] private gospel we preach the word
[1:21:03] that's why after service we could put up
[1:21:05] on the internet and who want to hear it
[1:21:07] hear it who don't want to hear it they
[1:21:08] don't listen to it that's fine but we
[1:21:11] are free
[1:21:13] this church is free and I am free to
[1:21:16] preach the gospel the gospel is not bad
[1:21:20] news the cosplay is the good news
[1:21:23] come on saying that somebody the gospel
[1:21:26] is that bad news about this one and that
[1:21:28] one all them pastors struggling
[1:21:32] here's a double minute
[1:21:34] you didn't having a granted
[1:21:38] someone in my grand problems because the
[1:21:41] Holy Ghost not dear
[1:21:43] so to take the human element they have
[1:21:46] turned loads of digging ushers spies
[1:21:48] assistance and Associates people walking
[1:21:51] helping them nurturing them when I ride
[1:21:54] home and everything else people almost
[1:21:56] live in a nutritional
[1:21:58] so you never wouldn't get to them
[1:22:05] husbands the same body Church
[1:22:09] they serve in the church they're like
[1:22:11] church nuns
[1:22:16] you know how to say Amen
[1:22:18] is just the truth
[1:22:20] Hallelujah
[1:22:22] and God want to lose you out there to
[1:22:25] face the music
[1:22:27] wasn't God do Jesus loose him into the
[1:22:30] Wilderness Let The Devil tempt him
[1:22:34] amen do this do that you think God's
[1:22:36] Sorry God wants to break your spirit
[1:22:40] yes God went to breakfast be too strong
[1:22:43] yes God went to break the spirit that he
[1:22:46] could get a yield in a position where
[1:22:48] you depend on him
[1:22:53] it's good to be victorious but sometimes
[1:22:55] God does bring us to defeat for a
[1:22:57] purpose
[1:23:01] defeat this part of God's program
[1:23:06] I'm not hearing you
[1:23:08] some of you feeling dumb because you're
[1:23:09] defeated praise God defeat doesn't mean
[1:23:12] you're going to stay defeated defeat
[1:23:14] means Allah
[1:23:16] that is not the war
[1:23:18] somebody
[1:23:20] that is only wrongs number one
[1:23:27] Gloria Give the Lord a shout
[1:23:30] you're gonna bounce back
[1:23:32] You're Gonna Know amen
[1:23:38] struggling
[1:23:47] you know I always preach
[1:23:50] just as the treat of a vision or the
[1:23:52] prophet brought a vision a home should
[1:23:54] have a vision
[1:23:55] but everybody have a vision connected to
[1:23:57] where we want to go
[1:23:59] what we want to achieve if a horned of a
[1:24:01] vision the husband of a vision what the
[1:24:03] wife helping into it
[1:24:06] is a man going nowhere
[1:24:09] man I have no set of purpose man always
[1:24:12] had a vision because you're not seeking
[1:24:13] God for vision
[1:24:15] of where you want to go where you want
[1:24:17] to be what you want to accomplish
[1:24:18] because anytime you have purpose and you
[1:24:21] have a vision that is what will wake you
[1:24:23] up in the morning and say it is a great
[1:24:26] day because you are nearer than when
[1:24:28] your first believer
[1:24:31] in other words Sarah was a boss is here
[1:24:34] to get up
[1:24:36] because here was old
[1:24:39] and she didn't have a revolution
[1:24:41] so she had to hear Abraham saying don't
[1:24:43] worry Sarah you will make it
[1:24:45] and she promised oh
[1:24:48] and Abraham's story is I don't know
[1:24:51] but God said so
[1:24:53] that's the problem every so often
[1:24:56] there's a fight for the Abraham and
[1:24:57] Syria
[1:24:58] because Sarah don't understand why is
[1:25:01] Abraham smiling like that
[1:25:03] because Abraham only seen Isaac and she
[1:25:06] can't see what he is seeing because she
[1:25:08] don't have the Revelation he has and
[1:25:11] that's a problem
[1:25:12] oh Hallelujah so the stimulation of
[1:25:15] Revelation that Abraham had Sarah like
[1:25:19] that
[1:25:24] oh
[1:25:25] so when Abraham come home and sing I
[1:25:27] feel like traveling on ask me something
[1:25:29] to drink their sister when Abraham's
[1:25:31] singing that kind of way she don't
[1:25:33] understand why why you could sing like
[1:25:35] that when she is feeling old and still
[1:25:37] go and lie down
[1:25:39] oh give the Lord some praises
[1:25:42] oh Hallelujah
[1:25:44] Oh Glory
[1:25:45] Hallelujah but you know what anoint
[1:25:48] Sarah fate when the tree men came to
[1:25:51] walking it was a hot day it was about 12
[1:25:54] o'clock noon and three men came walking
[1:25:56] and Sarah went to meet some big because
[1:25:59] Sarah taught by some other man talking
[1:26:01] and Abraham began to talk to that man
[1:26:03] and not to say Allah and that man began
[1:26:06] to talk he said I will return unto you
[1:26:08] and Syria gonna have that son and Syria
[1:26:11] last because she was hearing the
[1:26:13] conversation and the man said why did
[1:26:15] Sarah laugh and she knew she laughed
[1:26:18] within herself she knew not a man could
[1:26:21] have known that she was laughing in her
[1:26:23] heart that had to be God
[1:26:27] foreign
[1:26:40] after that realization Sarah was changed
[1:26:44] all together because she knew something
[1:26:46] went between the bone and the marrow
[1:26:47] something went beyond her spirit and
[1:26:49] he's still in the very total intents of
[1:26:51] her heart she knew that was almighty God
[1:26:54] she knew that was Elohim and everyone
[1:26:56] said I'm gonna come back not as man
[1:26:59] anymore but as power as Dynamics in the
[1:27:02] mechanics and Abraham knew his wife
[1:27:04] caught the vision come on say Amen
[1:27:07] somebody just had to wait on the
[1:27:09] physician but the wife caught the vision
[1:27:11] and once the pride that's the vision the
[1:27:14] only written for the visitation but the
[1:27:17] vision is from appointed time oh I will
[1:27:20] surely visit you
[1:27:24] there's gonna be Almighty
[1:27:26] Mighty visitation
[1:27:28] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:31] you may be seated oh Hallelujah
[1:27:34] sometime I want to tell you something
[1:27:36] you talk about pulsation work on that
[1:27:39] position that's pay of the moment Joshua

[1:31:29] act not talk
[1:31:33] some people like the philosophical thing
[1:31:37] philosophy
[1:31:39] we want to get into the action path
[1:31:42] oh Hallelujah
[1:31:44] no circumstance is considered oh man let
[1:31:47] me just skip down here remember Joe
[1:31:49] dad know what happens to read listen to
[1:31:51] this one he didn't have it as easy as we
[1:31:53] got today to read the words and see
[1:31:55] others who took it remember it's only by
[1:31:57] Revelation Joseph
[1:31:59] in Genesis there was no Bible Moses or
[1:32:02] Genesis Leviticus Deuteronomy none of
[1:32:04] those characters and they had any bible
[1:32:06] to read until after Moses they didn't
[1:32:08] have a Bible that we got to help us
[1:32:10] along in our condition they were
[1:32:12] rugged men God revealed to them and they
[1:32:16] stood right there nothing moved them
[1:32:19] it's once nothing can move you once it
[1:32:22] revealed to you
[1:32:23] but you just have to get a little start
[1:32:26] that's all you have to do just get your
[1:32:29] faith moving one time and God will do
[1:32:31] the rest
[1:32:32] oh hallelujah praise God he said the
[1:32:35] attitude is what brings the results it's
[1:32:37] the attitude you take towards God here
[1:32:39] was a woman touches garment she was
[1:32:41] healed with a blood issue a soldier spit
[1:32:44] on his face and no virtue it's your
[1:32:46] approach the attitude is what it takes
[1:32:48] and that's what it is tonight dear
[1:32:50] friend it takes the attitude we are and
[1:32:53] believe that we are in the presence of
[1:32:55] Jesus Christ but is our attitude that
[1:32:57] brings the results the mechanics is here
[1:33:00] here we go and so is the Dynamics if you
[1:33:04] can just get started God will do the
[1:33:07] rest
[1:33:08] he didn't say get seated
[1:33:11] he said started in other words you got
[1:33:13] to get the moving
[1:33:15] I'm not hearing you
[1:33:17] that's why he said what we see should
[1:33:18] make a church that can make a Revival
[1:33:21] you have got to want it you've got to
[1:33:24] want to make it
[1:33:30] yeah

[1:33:45] no you feel my cake gets booty
[1:33:48] just reading the book
[1:33:51] I can make cake too
[1:33:53] but what I'm saying that you need all
[1:33:55] the things to mix it together then you
[1:33:57] beat it
[1:33:58] bring it in that's not a cake
[1:34:02] that they mixed you you have to go in
[1:34:04] the oven
[1:34:05] and be baked at the right temperature
[1:34:10] isn't that right I went all that process
[1:34:13] you get the cake what it went through a
[1:34:15] process
[1:34:16] come on say Amen somebody
[1:34:18] so if we have to get a Revival come on
[1:34:22] you have to get the right mixture come
[1:34:23] on
[1:34:24] they were in the upper room they were
[1:34:26] praising God continually they have to
[1:34:29] mix it and blend in that's a blending
[1:34:31] blending
[1:34:34] oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory that God
[1:34:38] has to blend in and I said blending
[1:34:41] something being created around you and
[1:34:43] atmosphere is being created either that
[1:34:45] person being created it attracts the
[1:34:47] Holy Ghost

[1:35:03] bringing Israel out his people a nation
[1:35:05] a nation out of a Nation a beautiful
[1:35:07] time of the day God is calling here we
[1:35:09] go a bride out of a church a Christian
[1:35:13] bride out of a church isn't that right
[1:35:16] it's sometimes called the chosen the
[1:35:18] elected The Remnant it was called the
[1:35:21] bride the for ordained and so forth
[1:35:23] isn't that right praise be to Jesus so
[1:35:27] what Ramadan says that he will call you
[1:35:29] a side church if you'll only obey him
[1:35:32] and stay on the word he will place into
[1:35:35] the church before the coming of Jesus
[1:35:37] Christ all the powers that was in Christ
[1:35:39] will be in the church isn't that right
[1:35:43] God wanted his work done he sent his son
[1:35:46] his son wanting the work done he sent it
[1:35:50] into the church a doctor you will know I
[1:35:52] and the father heal me and I knew isn't
[1:35:54] that right and the same power that was
[1:35:57] in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ
[1:35:59] the same power that President Jesus
[1:36:01] Christ rest in place sons in the body of
[1:36:06] Christ
[1:36:07] that's the prophecy isn't it right place
[1:36:10] another son there will be a power put
[1:36:12] into the church and now it's coming in
[1:36:15] that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the
[1:36:19] people till they will speak the word I
[1:36:22] never created self right there like that
[1:36:25] we haven't seen power likes coming into
[1:36:27] the church I know it as a fact
[1:36:29] he knew it was coming the Holy Ghost is
[1:36:32] going to anoint the people
[1:36:35] how could the Holy Ghost anoint the
[1:36:37] people that means the people must become
[1:36:38] the word
[1:36:40] because the spirit comes on the word
[1:36:43] oh Hallelujah glory to God in the
[1:36:47] beginning was the word isn't that right
[1:36:49] then the world became flesh and Jill was
[1:36:52] anointed with the Holy Ghost but he was
[1:36:54] the word and the bride will become the
[1:36:56] word then the Holy Ghost have to come
[1:36:58] upon you the Dynamics will strike you
[1:37:04] because the Dynamics is for the bride
[1:37:07] and the church hallelujah it's going to
[1:37:09] strike you oh Blessed Be of the Lord
[1:37:13] no he listen to this adoption
[1:37:16] Ephraim don't want to stay one of them
[1:37:18] over there we send Manus over there God
[1:37:21] said well wait a minute I'm supposed to
[1:37:23] raise oats I'm gonna get corn too you
[1:37:26] ain't got nothing to do with corn get
[1:37:28] oats oats is your part to raise you
[1:37:31] until you're supposed to hurt sheep and
[1:37:34] you are supposed to hurt cattle God
[1:37:36] wants to place the church listen
[1:37:38] carefully I don't want anybody to miss
[1:37:40] this God wants to place the church but
[1:37:44] every one of them wants to do the same
[1:37:47] thing
[1:37:50] and you can't tell them nothing about
[1:37:52] that
[1:37:53] Hallelujah they got that goatee
[1:37:57] now what God can take a man adopt him
[1:38:01] into the family and give him something
[1:38:04] first
[1:38:05] try that
[1:38:09] if it is right
[1:38:11] the Bible said try the spirit so if any
[1:38:16] Minister pastor Pastor whoever claim
[1:38:18] whatever claim anything and they don't
[1:38:21] want to be tried that is not the spirit
[1:38:23] of God because if you have what is right
[1:38:26] it could be right
[1:38:29] try that we're supposed to try the
[1:38:31] spirits
[1:38:32] nobody say accept this no try it see if
[1:38:35] it's right I'm gonna claim a certain
[1:38:37] thing try it see if it is right if it is
[1:38:40] right move right with it and say Lord
[1:38:42] send us something else and that's how
[1:38:44] God going to place the church isn't that
[1:38:46] right oh Hallelujah now watch God could
[1:38:49] have chosen to preach the gospel by the
[1:38:51] Sun by the Moon by the Stars by window
[1:38:54] nature but he chose men to preach the
[1:38:56] gospel and that is where the voice of
[1:38:58] God will come from and you can judge the
[1:39:02] voice according to the word it expresses
[1:39:06] then you can see what kind of voice
[1:39:09] you're listening to if it is contrary to
[1:39:12] the word don't listen to it
[1:39:15] but if it is the word then God is Duty
[1:39:18] bound to back it up so God will always
[1:39:20] back up and confirm his word Moses
[1:39:24] Pharaoh look out the window and saw
[1:39:27] these bunch of madabas Moses look out
[1:39:30] the same window and Moses saw Victory he
[1:39:33] had focused himself though he was a
[1:39:35] prince he was a Heir but he knowed God
[1:39:37] promised Abraham that he would visit his
[1:39:39] people
[1:39:40] Moses looked out his window and he
[1:39:42] believed it because Moses looked out by
[1:39:45] faith and when you are focused with the
[1:39:47] word of God you are indirectly in line
[1:39:49] and zurion then that fate of God is in
[1:39:52] you isn't that right look at the church
[1:39:54] today God wants us to watch for the
[1:39:57] supernatural when his word is made
[1:39:59] manifest and Vindicated
[1:40:01] now if the devil says for you no wait a
[1:40:03] minute wait a minute maybe tonight you
[1:40:05] might be a little bit better when the
[1:40:06] Revival starts might be fear might be
[1:40:09] good but don't wait till Revival start
[1:40:11] become part of Revival right now God
[1:40:15] wanted started in you how many believe
[1:40:17] that boy want to start it in the church
[1:40:20] the holy spirit will take the messenger
[1:40:23] and send forth a message is not right
[1:40:25] and this quote I got it from uh pastor
[1:40:28] but a cliff Chima in Nigeria he said
[1:40:32] this on why I'm praying for the sick he
[1:40:35] said I don't come as a fanatic I do not
[1:40:37] believe in fanaticism I wouldn't stand
[1:40:39] for it I know you don't believe in
[1:40:40] financism you believe in the truth here
[1:40:43] we go and truth will always speak for
[1:40:47] itself you don't ever have to strain
[1:40:50] truth truth will always be truth
[1:40:53] your daughters try to prove truth and
[1:40:55] think truth no truth will speak for
[1:40:57] itself I love that oh praise God Amen
[1:41:02] Hallelujah do you believe that
[1:41:04] praise God so here we go he said no
[1:41:07] wonder God can send a Revival he has got
[1:41:09] nothing to build it on then he will take
[1:41:11] individuals and build it on them
[1:41:13] individuals and declare them before the
[1:41:15] world who will stay with the word
[1:41:17] from God called man he said we hear all
[1:41:19] this cry for Revival and so forth and
[1:41:22] it's uplifting but God made a promise if
[1:41:24] my people has come by my name shall
[1:41:26] Ascend themselves together and pray then
[1:41:28] they'll hear from heaven now this is the
[1:41:30] other half of what we're talking about
[1:41:31] the minister card being a Revival but
[1:41:34] listen to this part and before we can
[1:41:36] have a Revival God has to call out and
[1:41:39] train men God train men to carry this
[1:41:43] message and did he describe the kind of
[1:41:46] men that they are they don't care what
[1:41:48] the opposition is they are willing to go
[1:41:51] into sorry furnace and defeat or to the
[1:41:54] Lions them or wherever it is because
[1:41:57] they have been in the presence of God
[1:41:59] and they know he is whether it's victory
[1:42:02] or defeat they will stand the same and
[1:42:05] that's the kind of training God gave his
[1:42:07] man isn't that right
[1:42:09] God very seldom calls smart men educated
[1:42:13] and intellectual they play their part
[1:42:15] they're great men but usually when God
[1:42:18] wants the job done
[1:42:20] it have men who could explain the job
[1:42:22] they they could explain a job
[1:42:24] description they could conduct the
[1:42:26] interview they could explain all what
[1:42:28] you're supposed to do but when talking
[1:42:30] about the job done God have certain kind
[1:42:32] of men to get job done hallelujah my
[1:42:36] meat is to do the work the will of God
[1:42:38] and to finish the work in other words I
[1:42:41] have a job to finish to do it's not
[1:42:43] right so what's something usually he
[1:42:45] gets somebody who hardly knows his ABC
[1:42:50] look to the histories men that are
[1:42:52] marketed something with God were not men
[1:42:54] of great education but men who had no
[1:42:56] education only desire in their heart to
[1:42:59] serve God he got a plow man he got a
[1:43:02] shepherd He got fishermen he got hunters
[1:43:05] and so forth oh what we need is that
[1:43:08] kind of man today not polished Scholars
[1:43:10] but men who know God in the power of his
[1:43:14] resurrection oh bless let's all stand
[1:43:16] and give God some wish
[1:43:18] please
[1:43:21] oh Hallelujah
[1:43:24] Oh Glory
