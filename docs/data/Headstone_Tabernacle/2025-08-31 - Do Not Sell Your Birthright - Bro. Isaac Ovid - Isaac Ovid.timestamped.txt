[28:08] Psalms 27.
[28:12] Amen.
[28:16] Reading from verses 1 to8 from Psalms
[28:18] 27. And it says, "The Lord is my light
[28:22] and my salvation.
[28:25] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[28:27] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[28:29] afraid? When the wicked, even my enemies
[28:32] and my foes came upon me to eat up my
[28:35] flesh. They stumble and fell. Do who
[28:39] encamp against me. My heart shall not
[28:42] fear. The war shall rise against me. In
[28:46] this will I be confident. One thing that
[28:49] I have desired of the Lord, that I will
[28:52] seek after, that I may dwell in the
[28:55] house of the Lord all the days of my
[28:57] life, to behold the beauty of the Lord,
[29:00] and to inquire in his temple. For in the
[29:03] time of trouble, he shall hide me in his
[29:05] pavilion. In the secrets of his
[29:08] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[29:10] set me up upon a rock. And now shall my
[29:14] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[29:18] round about me. Therefore will I offer
[29:21] in the tabernacle sacrifices of joy I
[29:24] will sing. Yay I will sing praises unto
[29:26] the Lord. When thou said seek my face my
[29:30] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[29:34] I seek. Amen. Let's just bow our heads
[29:37] for a word of prayer this morning.

[59:59] Thank you, brother Jason, for the song
[1:00:01] service atmosphere we in. Amen. Praise
[1:00:05] the Lord.
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:08] You know, Brother Isaac spoke some time
[1:00:10] ago, my brother Norris church about
[1:00:12] finding faith in the time of storm.
[1:00:15] And it's amazing the words that Jesus
[1:00:18] told them amidst the storm. He tell
[1:00:21] them, "Be of good cheer." And the
[1:00:23] hardest thing to find cheer is when
[1:00:26] you're going through the rough spot.
[1:00:27] When things are all cloudy, when things
[1:00:30] are dark and your home boat, financial
[1:00:33] boat, whatever boat is rocking, marital
[1:00:36] boat, health boat, whatever boat you're
[1:00:38] in, and it is shaking and rocking and
[1:00:40] Jesus come and say, "Be of good cheer."
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; And your face is hard like a rock. You
[1:00:45] say, "No, Jesus, I can't share." But he
[1:00:48] said,
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; "Be of good cheer."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; So, it's not you, it's what he said. At
[1:00:54] some point of in time, we have to begin
[1:00:56] to listen to what he said,
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; not what you feel. People feeling too
[1:01:00] much. A feeling and a feeling. A feel.
[1:01:02] Stop feeling.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Find out what God said
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and start to believe what God said
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; because God is not a man that would lie.
[1:01:09] Your husband will lie to you. Your wife
[1:01:11] would lie. Your children will lie.
[1:01:12] Parents will lie. The boss will lie. But
[1:01:14] God cannot lie.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever God speaks, it got to come to
[1:01:17] pass. It must come to pass. If God say
[1:01:20] he'll heal you, he will heal you. If God
[1:01:22] say deliver you, he will deliver you. If
[1:01:24] God say will cast that devil out of you,
[1:01:26] that devil is on his way out.
[1:01:30] If God say going to multiply and add to
[1:01:31] you, he going to multiply and add to
[1:01:33] you. Because God is God. He's not your
[1:01:36] uncle. Praise God. Not your father or
[1:01:38] mother. He is God Almighty. And he
[1:01:40] cannot make a promise that he cannot
[1:01:42] keep. He is big enough to make the
[1:01:44] promise. He is big enough to keep it.
[1:01:46] And we big enough to say, "God, you said
[1:01:48] it and I believe it." And that settles
[1:01:52] it.
[1:01:54] You may be seated.
[1:01:57] So we believe that uh it's a special day
[1:01:59] today and a special time and we just
[1:02:02] under great expectation to see what the
[1:02:04] Lord will do and it's up to you, you
[1:02:06] know,
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; to have that expectation. The preacher
[1:02:09] cannot do it.
[1:02:11] In the exhortation in the Zoom prayer
[1:02:12] meeting on Friday, I read about blind
[1:02:14] batimus. It's always a thrill for me to
[1:02:17] read that scripture, that text about
[1:02:19] blind Batimus. He was on one street
[1:02:20] begging and somebody tell him Jesus on
[1:02:23] the other side. So have mercy upon me.
[1:02:26] They say he can't he can't hear you.
[1:02:28] That didn't stop him. That when you're
[1:02:30] desperate,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; when you're you see some people, they're
[1:02:32] too comfort in their sickness. They're
[1:02:34] too comfortable in their disease.
[1:02:35] They're too comfortable in the way of
[1:02:36] life. They're too comfortable inside of
[1:02:38] that.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Have mercy upon me. They say keep quiet.
[1:02:41] He start to make a lot of noise.
[1:02:43] So much noise that that noise, that
[1:02:45] emotion, that faith went up to heaven
[1:02:48] and stopped Jesus. Something come down
[1:02:50] and stopped Jesus and Jesus sent for
[1:02:52] him.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Everybody know the man blind. You could
[1:02:55] see that
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; he's a blind man.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And look at Jesus words. What would you
[1:03:00] have me to do for you?
[1:03:05] If you're a diseascal,
[1:03:07] you will say, "Yes, he blind.
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:14] But that is not the response Jesus
[1:03:16] wants.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; He wants you to speak.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, that I might have my
[1:03:22] sight."
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; You have to speak what you want. Whether
[1:03:28] for yourself, for your husband, for your
[1:03:30] wife, for your children, for your
[1:03:32] marriage, for your family, for whatever
[1:03:34] it is, you have to express and have a
[1:03:36] desire in your heart that God will
[1:03:38] answer your prayer.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That man received his sight
[1:03:42] because he asked for it.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus carried your mind. Is your mouth
[1:03:47] he want to hear?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Because he sure if the man want his
[1:03:50] sight, he could want to win the lotto.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; He could want more money.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; He could want a white house, a big
[1:03:57] house. He want a swimming pool. He just
[1:03:59] don't know what he wants. So he's not
[1:04:01] assuming anything. He want to hear from
[1:04:04] you.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; May he hear from you this morning.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Somebody through it all.
[1:04:09] True it all. True and all.
[1:04:14] True all
[1:04:19] to trust in Jesus.
[1:04:22] I learn to trust in God. Oh, through it
[1:04:27] all.
[1:04:29] Through it all.
[1:04:33] Hallelujah. I've learned to depend
[1:04:38] what is good.
[1:04:40] Yes, this morning. I thank God for the
[1:04:44] mountains.
[1:04:46] Thank God for the valleys.
[1:04:50] I thank God for the trials I've been
[1:04:53] through.
[1:04:55] [Music]
[1:04:58] If I never had a problem, I never knew
[1:05:03] that God could solve them. I never knew
[1:05:07] what thing this world can do. But
[1:05:12] hallelujah, true.
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:19] Hallelujah. Well, I learn to trust in
[1:05:22] Jesus.
[1:05:24] I learn to trust in God. Oh,
[1:05:30] true.
[1:05:34] My Lord, my Lord, I've learned
[1:05:39] the word of his word. This morning, I
[1:05:41] want to call to the prophet to greet you
[1:05:43] all. Andrew Lulen from Living Word
[1:05:45] Healing and Deliverance Tabernacle. But
[1:05:47] Andrew, could you come and read the
[1:05:49] believers? Amen. Praise God. He's here
[1:05:50] with us this morning.
[1:05:53] Learn to trust in Jesus.
[1:05:56] Well, learn to trust in God. Oh,
[1:06:01] through it all.
[1:06:06] Through it all.
[1:06:07] I learn to depend on his word.
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:19] Praise him.
[1:06:22] Thank God this morning. Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I give God thanks to be here.
[1:06:28] My wife is just across here. Amen.
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; I forget his wife is here. God bless
[1:06:36] you, sister. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Praise him.
[1:06:42] I I I I just want to greet you and let
[1:06:46] you know that we serve a God of signs,
[1:06:50] wonders, and miracles.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, and miracles.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And as a old Pentecostal sisters used to
[1:07:04] tell me, when you're down to nothing,
[1:07:07] God is up to something.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And just yesterday, I was looking
[1:07:14] at the the sometime we we we read things
[1:07:18] in the scripture, but we don't
[1:07:20] understand the magnitude of the miracle.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; We just read it now. Now for God to for
[1:07:29] Hezekiah say for God to turn for the
[1:07:32] clock to go forward is no problem
[1:07:33] because everything is going forward.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Hezekiah say I want it to go backward.
[1:07:39] So you say I want it to go backward 10°
[1:07:43] and 10°
[1:07:46] is 40 minutes.
[1:07:49] Okay. One degree is 4 minutes. 10
[1:07:53] degrees is 40 minutes.
[1:07:56] Okay, forget about the calculation. But
[1:08:00] just trust me. One degree is 4 minutes.
[1:08:03] 10 is 40 minutes.
[1:08:05] And that is not enough. Joshua said,
[1:08:08] "Well, Lord, just let it hold on. So
[1:08:12] time stop."
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serving.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Okay? And and if you never experience a
[1:08:20] miracle,
[1:08:22] today could be your day.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Today could be your day. And by by the
[1:08:30] grace of God, I've I've had many
[1:08:32] miracles in my life. There was a time
[1:08:34] when I couldn't walk. They used to carry
[1:08:36] me around in a in a little trolley, the
[1:08:39] little box cart or something.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And as a little boy in eight, nine
[1:08:43] years, I believe in God.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. because I I I know what the Bible
[1:08:48] says.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And I holding on to God until God raised
[1:08:52] me up.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:59] [Applause]
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, miracles.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; The the the the the
[1:09:08] prophet said the song that the angel
[1:09:10] loved to hear was only believe.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And I just want to let you know that God
[1:09:27] knows what you're going through.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; God feels the pain. He knows what you're
[1:09:34] going through. But he just says, "Just
[1:09:37] ask me.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Just ask me."
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, do it today."
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] So we talk about
[1:09:51] this Godself is a real God.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; He's a God of miracles.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; I can't go into all the different
[1:10:00] testimonies, but I just give you a
[1:10:03] little thing. Okay?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; God, the God of miracles. And today I
[1:10:08] want to say that I want to stand like
[1:10:11] Caleb here and say
[1:10:15] Joshua
[1:10:17] give me my mountain.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; It is it wasn't a matter if you want to

[1:10:53] late.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Today.
[1:10:57] Today is my day. Hallelujah.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And he he he praise him. You know pastor
[1:11:06] pastor Theo talk about blind Batamus.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Batimus. And you know what Batimus said
[1:11:12] in his heart? The Bible say and he
[1:11:15] casting away his garment.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He casting away his garment. Ran to
[1:11:20] Jesus. Now that garment was the beggy
[1:11:23] garment that he had. He was saying today
[1:11:26] is my last day for begging.
[1:11:28] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Praise him.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; he said I am going to receive my sight
[1:11:38] today.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "For she said in her
[1:11:43] heart, not a mind. Faith bypasses the
[1:11:47] mind and human intellect and gets down
[1:11:50] in the spirit." He said, "Today, if I
[1:11:54] could only touch him, I shall be made
[1:11:56] whole. Forget the crowd. Forget the who
[1:11:59] pushing to anywhere I could pass. I
[1:12:02] passing but I'm going to touch and I
[1:12:06] shall be made whole.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Praise him.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Praise him. Praise him.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Friends, today this God we serving is
[1:12:19] real.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; This is not a religion.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; This is not like the others. Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; This God that we are serving is a God of
[1:12:28] signs. Keep it in your mind. Wonders and
[1:12:32] miracles.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Praise him. That's the God we serving.
[1:12:41] For too long, the devil's back up the
[1:12:43] church in a corner. Back us up in a
[1:12:46] corner. And and and and with
[1:12:48] intimidation.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; It's time we step out like
[1:12:54] David and said, "Who is this
[1:12:57] uncircumcised Philistine that defy the
[1:13:01] army of the Lord that defy the Holy
[1:13:04] Ghost that defy the power of miracles?"
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise him this morning.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; So, I believe I'm trusting God to do
[1:13:19] great things among us.
[1:13:22] I want you to once you could believe for
[1:13:24] it,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; you will receive it now. Once you could
[1:13:26] believe,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; forget what's what's around you. Forget
[1:13:29] what's around you. Peter said, "Lord,
[1:13:31] uh, let me come." And Peter started to
[1:13:34] walk.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; But what happened? He went back into the
[1:13:38] reasoning and and the seeing and the
[1:13:40] senses and then he he he begin to
[1:13:45] doubt
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; and the Bible say begin to sink. But
[1:13:49] even if you sink in, cry out.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, help me. Help thou my
[1:13:56] unbelief.
[1:13:57] [Applause]
[1:13:59] Cry."
[1:14:00] [Applause]
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And as the song as the song says, he is
[1:14:06] there all the time.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; He never leave us. He listen as brother
[1:14:11] Tio says and I always say it when God
[1:14:14] says something he said the word that I
[1:14:17] speak unto you shall not return unto me
[1:14:20] void. It shall accomplish that which he
[1:14:23] was sent to do and prosper in the think
[1:14:26] which I sent it. And as the word of God
[1:14:29] comes so much word is coming from this
[1:14:32] pullpit friends. We ought to prosper in
[1:14:35] that word. That worship was to change us
[1:14:38] from from from
[1:14:40] into his image,
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; from faith to belly kindness.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That word supposed to change us
[1:14:50] from faith to belly kindness.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; So that God could come down and seal off
[1:14:58] our lives.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And say, "This is my son."
[1:15:03] Hallelujah. Hear him.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise him. I thank God for the
[1:15:08] little opportunity. I give God thanks. I
[1:15:11] pray that these word would store your
[1:15:13] faith and and and and and raise you up
[1:15:16] inside.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Raise up that lion inside of you.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Raise up that warrior spirit inside of
[1:15:23] you. Hallelujah. Say, I am ready to
[1:15:27] fight again. 85 years old. I'm strong
[1:15:30] just like what when I was 40 years ago.
[1:15:33] have strong to go out and slay them
[1:15:35] giants.
[1:15:37] Oh, praise him. Thank you.
[1:15:43] God bless you.
[1:15:46] Hallelujah.
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:16:14] That's all of them.
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:22] He's there
[1:16:25] all
[1:16:27] the time.
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:31] I know that he's there
[1:16:35] all
[1:16:37] the time.
[1:16:41] Oh, when it seems like
[1:16:45] my trles,
[1:16:47] I'm more
[1:16:49] you can bear. I know that he's there
[1:16:55] all
[1:16:57] the time.
[1:16:59] So brother Isaac will come to the pulpit
[1:17:00] this morning and speak to you Jesus.
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:13] He's there all all the time.
[1:17:20] But when it seems like it seems like all
[1:17:24] your trouble, what the trouble they are
[1:17:27] more than you can. Hallelujah. I know
[1:17:31] that he's there. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:37] can we sing it one more time all over
[1:17:39] the building? Oh,
[1:17:42] he's there.
[1:17:44] Oh
[1:17:47] my glory.
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:17:53] He's there all
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:05] [Applause]
[1:18:08] you can.
[1:18:10] I know I'm leaving there
[1:18:14] all
[1:18:16] the time.
[1:18:18] Can we give the Lord a hand of praise
[1:18:20] this morning? Bless his name. Are you
[1:18:23] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[1:18:24] this morning?
[1:18:26] You appreciate his presence. You
[1:18:28] appreciate his love. You appreciate his
[1:18:31] grace. You appreciate his mercy. He's
[1:18:34] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:18:36] He is the great shepherd. He's the great
[1:18:39] I am. He is the way. He is the truth. He
[1:18:42] is the light this morning. There's no
[1:18:44] sickness that can stand in his presence.
[1:18:47] There's no problem that can stand in his
[1:18:49] presence. There's no situation that he's
[1:18:51] not big enough to handle this morning.
[1:18:53] Can we give him the Lord a hand of
[1:18:55] praise? Oh, blessed be the name of the
[1:18:59] Lord.
[1:19:01] You appreciate the Lord this morning.
[1:19:04] You appreciate the atmosphere.
[1:19:06] Amen. and blessed be the name of the
[1:19:08] Lord. Well, it's certainly great to be
[1:19:09] in the house of the Lord this morning.
[1:19:11] Uh to be in his presence and to be able
[1:19:13] to have this service together one more
[1:19:15] time. So, while you're standing, we can
[1:19:17] go straight to the word.
[1:19:19] I greet you all in the precious name of
[1:19:21] Jesus Christ.
[1:19:23] I want to read from three portions of
[1:19:26] scripture. I want to read from Romans 8,
[1:19:30] Romans 9,
[1:19:32] and from Hebrews 12 this morning by the
[1:19:34] grace of God.
[1:19:37] Reading Romans 8, reading from verse 28,
[1:19:41] a very familiar passage of scripture.
[1:19:44] And we know that all things work
[1:19:46] together for good. To them that love
[1:19:48] God, to them who are the called
[1:19:50] according to his purpose. For whom he
[1:19:52] did forno, he also did predestinate to
[1:19:56] be conformed to the image of his son,
[1:19:57] that we might be the firstborn among
[1:19:59] many brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[1:20:02] predestinate them, he also called. And
[1:20:04] whom he called, them he also justified.
[1:20:07] And whom he justified, them he also
[1:20:10] glorified.
[1:20:12] A reading Romans 9 and reading from
[1:20:14] verse 10.
[1:20:21] And not only this, but when Rebecca also
[1:20:24] had conceived by one, even by our father
[1:20:28] Isaac, for the children being not yet
[1:20:30] born, neither having done any good or
[1:20:33] evil, that the purpose of God according
[1:20:36] to election might stand not of works,
[1:20:39] but of him that calleth.
[1:20:43] And our last scripture reading from
[1:20:45] Hebrews,
[1:20:49] Hebrews uh 12, reading from verse
[1:20:55] 15.
[1:20:57] looking diligently, lest any man fail of
[1:20:59] the grace of God, lest any root of
[1:21:02] bitterness
[1:21:04] springing up trouble you, and thereby
[1:21:07] many be defiled, lest there be any
[1:21:10] fornicator or profane person as Esau,
[1:21:13] who for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:21:17] birthright. For you know how that
[1:21:20] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:21:22] the blessing, he was rejected, for he
[1:21:25] found no place of repentance. Listen
[1:21:28] carefully here. Though he sought it
[1:21:31] carefully with tears. I want to read
[1:21:33] this one more time. This last verse. For
[1:21:36] you know how that afterward when he
[1:21:39] realized his mistake. When he realized
[1:21:42] what he had done, when he would have
[1:21:45] inherited the blessing, he was rejected.
[1:21:48] For he found no place of repentance,
[1:21:52] though he sought it carefully with
[1:21:54] tears. Can we bow our heads for the
[1:21:56] reading of uh for uh for bow our heads
[1:21:58] for the blessing of the word. Heavenly
[1:22:00] Father, Lord, we come before your throne
[1:22:02] this morning, your throne of grace, your
[1:22:04] throne of mercy. Lord, we are so humbled
[1:22:06] to be in your presence on this Sunday
[1:22:08] morning. Lord, the psalmist David said,
[1:22:10] "I was glad when they said unto me, let
[1:22:12] us go into your house." And Lord, we
[1:22:14] come to this special service, Lord, on
[1:22:17] this independence day. This day our
[1:22:19] nation celebrates another year of
[1:22:22] independence, Lord. And Father, we are
[1:22:24] here to also declare our independence
[1:22:26] from the works of darkness. We are here
[1:22:28] to depend, Lord, to declare our
[1:22:30] independence for Lord, from our past and
[1:22:32] our failures and our mistakes and our
[1:22:34] doubts and our fears, Father. So Lord,
[1:22:36] we could step boldly, Lord, not only
[1:22:38] into your presence, Father, but into the
[1:22:40] promises of God and our inheritance that
[1:22:42] by right we have access to this morning.
[1:22:44] Any man could read the scriptures, but
[1:22:46] it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life
[1:22:48] upon your people. So may you walk out
[1:22:50] the pages of the Bible and Lord, may you
[1:22:52] have the preeminence in the service this
[1:22:54] morning. We give it over to you. May you
[1:22:56] take me out of the way and speak lip to
[1:22:58] air to your people in the precious name
[1:22:59] of Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. You may be seated in the
[1:23:04] presence of the Lord. this morning. It's
[1:23:07] certainly a great privilege to see you
[1:23:08] all here and spending time among the
[1:23:12] things of God. There's no better place
[1:23:14] to be. So, I greet you one more time in
[1:23:16] the precious name of Jesus Christ. And I
[1:23:18] I know I haven't been here for a few
[1:23:20] services two weeks ago and I would have
[1:23:22] I think greeted in the Bible study. Um
[1:23:24] but greetings from France and we had a
[1:23:27] tremendous time in the in the meeting in
[1:23:28] France and certainly the Lord is
[1:23:30] blessing. And then uh how many
[1:23:32] appreciate the song service this
[1:23:34] morning? Brother Jason, God bless you.
[1:23:37] Certainly blessed. And then the special,
[1:23:40] how many you appreciate the special?
[1:23:43] Amen. And uh that special is from last
[1:23:46] Sunday where a small group of us would
[1:23:48] have uh been at Mispa Tabernacle to
[1:23:50] minister the word. And we thank God for
[1:23:52] his grace and his love. And uh it's
[1:23:55] certainly great to be called in such a
[1:23:57] time as this. You know, there's nothing
[1:23:59] that we could claim to have done on our
[1:24:01] own. There's nothing we could have
[1:24:03] achieved through works or effort. But
[1:24:04] it's the grace of God. We are all here
[1:24:06] trophies of the grace of almighty God.
[1:24:08] And that should take away all the pride.
[1:24:10] Take away all how we feel because God is
[1:24:12] the one who brought us all here. We
[1:24:13] didn't choose ourselves. We didn't bring
[1:24:15] ourselves. We didn't wake ourselves up
[1:24:16] this morning. I've said many times you
[1:24:18] take an alarm clock and put it in a
[1:24:20] morg. Nobody will wake up because it's
[1:24:21] not the alarm clock wake you up. But if
[1:24:23] God wake you up this morning, it's
[1:24:25] because there's still a purpose upon
[1:24:26] your life. Brother Brandon said when God
[1:24:28] is finished with you, then he could take
[1:24:30] you home. But the fact that you are here
[1:24:31] means God is not finished with you yet.
[1:24:33] And that is enough of a reason to shout.
[1:24:35] That's enough of a reason to praise God.
[1:24:37] God is not done with me yet. I'm not
[1:24:39] what I used to be. I'm not what I'm
[1:24:41] supposed to be. When I look back at the
[1:24:43] journey, I could see the Lord has been
[1:24:45] keeping me all the time. And it's been
[1:24:46] the Lord preserving me all the time. And
[1:24:48] the sovereign God we serve is more than
[1:24:50] able to pick you. You are here because
[1:24:52] God picked you. You didn't pick him. He
[1:24:55] picked you. And God is not now choosing.
[1:24:57] God is not waking up this morning and
[1:24:59] saying, "I pick you. I pick you." His
[1:25:01] fornowledge picked you. Hallelujah.
[1:25:04] Hallelujah. He predestinated you before
[1:25:06] you were here. You heard the scripture
[1:25:08] we read before Jacob and Esau were even
[1:25:10] born. Hallelujah. He said, "Jacob, I
[1:25:13] love Esau. I hate a decision was already
[1:25:16] made before they even did good or evil."
[1:25:18] So, you don't you think you're here by
[1:25:19] accident? Oh, somebody may have invited
[1:25:21] you, but you had no choice to be here
[1:25:23] this morning. You had no other place to
[1:25:25] go. Every other thing you try to do will
[1:25:28] have fallen down because God wanted you
[1:25:30] here this morning. Can the church say
[1:25:32] amen?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; You've got to be excited about your
[1:25:35] future. There's nothing you can do to
[1:25:37] change your past, but God holds your
[1:25:39] future. You are not holding it yourself.
[1:25:41] And I want to encourage you that the
[1:25:43] glory that's ahead of you is greater
[1:25:44] than anything you have ever experienced.
[1:25:47] The sufferings of this present time are
[1:25:49] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:25:51] which shall be revealed in us. We are on
[1:25:53] our way to the rapture. We on our way to
[1:25:56] the resurrection. We on our way to the
[1:25:58] wedding supper. You on your way to your
[1:25:59] healing. Brother said, "How could you
[1:26:01] have faith for a rapture if you can't
[1:26:03] even have faith for divine healing?" You
[1:26:05] heard what brother Andrew said. Miracles
[1:26:06] belong to you. It's part of your
[1:26:08] heritage. It's part of your inheritance.
[1:26:11] If you're sick today, today you shall be
[1:26:13] healed. Hallelujah. Today your day for
[1:26:16] miracles. Today is your day for a
[1:26:18] transformation. You shall not leave the
[1:26:20] same way you came today. Can the church
[1:26:22] say amen?
[1:26:24] Glory to God. I'm just trying to get
[1:26:26] through my greeting to share a few words
[1:26:28] with you this morning by the grace of
[1:26:30] God. But I'm excited because God is in
[1:26:32] the deliverance business. He's in the
[1:26:34] resurrection business. He's in the mercy
[1:26:36] business. I'm not going to be too long
[1:26:38] with you. We have a lot happening today,
[1:26:39] but tomorrow is a public holiday. So you
[1:26:41] have to forgive me. We don't get much
[1:26:43] days like this where the next day is a
[1:26:44] public holiday. It's a independence day.
[1:26:46] So we breaking free.
[1:26:49] But the Brandon say when you lift your
[1:26:50] hands, you defy the laws of gravity.
[1:26:52] When you stand up, you defy the laws of
[1:26:55] nature because the world wants to keep
[1:26:56] you down. But little lily, press your
[1:26:58] way. Press your way into your
[1:27:00] inheritance. Press your way into your
[1:27:02] promise of God. Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Before we go further, let me just make
[1:27:10] it very clear. There is nothing you
[1:27:12] could do yesterday.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; There is nothing. The pastor said to say
[1:27:18] it again. When the pastor tell you
[1:27:23] There is nothing you could do about
[1:27:24] yesterday. It's gone. It's finished. But
[1:27:26] today is a new day. Watch out, devil.
[1:27:29] The moment the bride gets to know who
[1:27:30] she is, then the rapture could go. The
[1:27:33] greatest trick the devil tries to play
[1:27:35] on you is that you make this mistake and
[1:27:37] you're not worthy and you can't be
[1:27:39] counted. But I've got news for the
[1:27:41] devil. If God could take Jacob, who made
[1:27:43] all of his mistakes, if God could take
[1:27:45] Jacob, who was a shy, and say, "I love
[1:27:48] this man because I put his name on the
[1:27:50] book." Hallelujah. Before he made a
[1:27:52] mistake, his name was there. Before he
[1:27:54] fell, his name was there. Before he
[1:27:56] committed a sin, his name was there.
[1:27:58] That's why Jesus could tell the
[1:27:59] disciples, don't rejoice because you
[1:28:01] have power. But rejoice because your
[1:28:03] names are written. And if your name is
[1:28:05] not written in those stands, but if your
[1:28:07] name is written, oh, there's no devil in
[1:28:09] hell. There's no sickness. There's no
[1:28:11] principality. There's no power. There's
[1:28:14] nothing present. There's nothing past.
[1:28:16] There's nothing to come that could stop
[1:28:17] you from coming into your inheritance.
[1:28:20] Hallelujah.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not crazy. This is
[1:28:25] joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:28:27] That's why when John saw his name, he
[1:28:29] said, "All in heaven, all on the earth,
[1:28:32] all under the earth heard him praising
[1:28:34] God because he got a revelation." You
[1:28:36] may be seated for a minute.
[1:28:38] Many people come to church and they
[1:28:40] don't have a revelation. They have
[1:28:42] information. They have knowledge. They
[1:28:44] have they see things. But when you get a
[1:28:46] revelation, you forget who's next to
[1:28:48] you. You forget who's behind you. You
[1:28:50] forget who's in the front of you. You
[1:28:51] forget around in your workplace, you
[1:28:53] praising God. You in your home, you
[1:28:55] praising God. Situations come and the
[1:28:58] stuff that used to bother you, they
[1:29:00] don't affect you anymore because you are
[1:29:02] anchored. Anchored in the word, anchored
[1:29:05] in the Lord because it's a revelation.
[1:29:07] It's revealed to you. You didn't get it
[1:29:09] from the pastor. You didn't get it from
[1:29:10] the minister. You didn't get from the
[1:29:12] deacon or the elder. But it's the Lord
[1:29:14] himself make himself known to you.
[1:29:18] That's why overnight you could see
[1:29:20] somebody change. Don't write off
[1:29:22] anybody.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Don't write off anybody. In 5 minutes in
[1:29:26] the presence of God, God could raise up
[1:29:28] an apostle. Raise up a pastor. Take a
[1:29:30] wife who has been struggling. And in 5
[1:29:33] minutes, she's changed. You can't judge
[1:29:35] it. God could say, "I love Jacob."
[1:29:38] Because he was not going to be Jacob all
[1:29:39] the time. He was going to become Israel.
[1:29:41] Oh, come on now. Hallelujah.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:47] Glory.
[1:29:49] Hallelujah.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Jacob was not going to stay Jacob.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah. Saul was not going to save
[1:29:54] Saul. Saul was going to come Paul. Is
[1:29:57] the power of transformation. And we are
[1:29:59] here to be transformed. We are here to
[1:30:01] be changed. We are here to be
[1:30:02] encouraged. We are here to recognize
[1:30:04] that this world is finished.
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; So we are happy this morning
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; and today by the grace of God we have a
[1:30:24] few things happening after the service.
[1:30:27] There are few situations we want to pray
[1:30:30] for and this is why we want to reinforce
[1:30:33] the faith
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; and the conviction that God is real and
[1:30:37] that he's a healer. So we want to pray
[1:30:39] for some of the sick among us. And after
[1:30:42] that, we will pray for the school
[1:30:44] children going back out to school
[1:30:47] because all hell is against them.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; The lid of hell is uncovered. The
[1:30:51] prophet told us streams of demon powers,
[1:30:54] 200,000,000 devils. They're not loose
[1:30:57] against the world. They're loose against
[1:30:59] this end time bride. Loose against those
[1:31:01] who are trying to do something
[1:31:02] different.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; So, we want to fortify our young people
[1:31:06] with prayer. And then after that, we
[1:31:09] want to acknowledge those from the
[1:31:10] Sunday school program by the grace of
[1:31:12] God so that um we could really celebrate
[1:31:16] because friends, you have to know what
[1:31:17] ground you're standing on to be able to
[1:31:19] defend yourself.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was being tested in the
[1:31:23] wilderness,
[1:31:24] he could say, "It is written. It is
[1:31:27] written. It is also written."
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Well, I think is this
[1:31:31] and I hope is this and my mother had
[1:31:33] told me some story and it was a phrase
[1:31:36] and the old people used to say this. It
[1:31:37] wasn't that it was it is written. It is
[1:31:40] written. It is also written. So his
[1:31:42] faith could have rested on the word of
[1:31:44] God.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; And you have to know in scripture why we
[1:31:48] do what we do and why we cannot do
[1:31:50] certain things. Because you are a royal
[1:31:52] priesthood. And because you are royal
[1:31:54] priesthood, there are things you can do
[1:31:56] and there are things you cannot do. Not
[1:31:58] that because God is restrictive, but
[1:32:00] because you are royalty.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Because you are
[1:32:04] royalty. There are conditions and
[1:32:06] parameters within which you could
[1:32:07] operate. In France, I shared with them
[1:32:09] that President Trump got a Tesla and he
[1:32:12] couldn't drive it. Why? Because the
[1:32:14] Secret Service policy is the president
[1:32:15] of the United States car in a car
[1:32:17] accident.
[1:32:19] Could could you imagine the headline the
[1:32:21] president drive and bomb something that
[1:32:22] they cannot allow for that to happen. So
[1:32:24] even if you gift him a car, he's not
[1:32:26] allowed to drive it. Not be. So imagine
[1:32:29] all the power the president has and the
[1:32:30] things he cannot do because the office
[1:32:32] requires a certain behavior, a certain
[1:32:35] conduct in the office. You ever see the
[1:32:37] queen of England drive a car?
[1:32:41] You wouldn't see it because you have
[1:32:43] trained drivers for that because of who
[1:32:44] she is. What do you think about you? I
[1:32:46] ain't telling you not to drive or no.
[1:32:49] I ain't saying don't drive. I'm just
[1:32:50] saying you are royalty. And because you
[1:32:52] are royalty, there are things that are
[1:32:53] allowed, there are things that are not
[1:32:54] allowed. There are things you could do
[1:32:56] and there things you cannot do. So don't
[1:32:58] feel bad when the world challenges how
[1:33:00] you dress and how you walk and how you
[1:33:02] speak. You are royalty. Your father is
[1:33:04] the king. Hallelujah. And you are born
[1:33:06] into a royal family. And because of
[1:33:08] this, your conduct is a certain way.
[1:33:10] That's why you could never come to the
[1:33:12] house of God looking sad and depressed
[1:33:13] because you know who your father is.
[1:33:14] Somebody preach back to me this morning.
[1:33:17] I'm not going to be too long with you.
[1:33:19] I'm but just making sure the temperature
[1:33:21] is right because I want to, you know, go
[1:33:24] bless Andrew. God bless you to you and
[1:33:26] your wife. So happy to have you here
[1:33:27] with us. You appreciate brother Andrew
[1:33:31] and his greetings to the church and he
[1:33:34] will join us in praying for some of the
[1:33:36] sick cases after the service as well. So
[1:33:38] this morning by the grace of God for a
[1:33:41] little encouragement to the church I
[1:33:42] have a title do not sell your
[1:33:45] birthright.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Do not sell your birthright.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And it's an inspiration the mystery of
[1:33:53] why God hated Esau.
[1:33:56] The mystery of why God hated Esau. I
[1:33:58] would have preached this as the mystery
[1:34:00] of go of why God hated Esau last week,
[1:34:02] but I wanted to bring it along a similar
[1:34:05] line, but also a bit different this
[1:34:07] morning along the lines of do not sell
[1:34:09] your birthight.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, let's get into it.
[1:34:18] The Bible said that in Proverbs 6:16,
[1:34:21] these six things that the Lord hate.
[1:34:25] The word hate is a powerful word. It's
[1:34:27] not dislike. It's not it bothers you.
[1:34:30] Hate is a strong word. These six things
[1:34:32] do the Lord hate.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; So if these things are found in us, it
[1:34:38] actually raises the hatred of God.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; And that's a very harsh or tough thing
[1:34:43] to one say and two to accept because we
[1:34:46] see God as love.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; We see God as mercy. We see all this
[1:34:51] side of God. But then there's a side of
[1:34:53] God where God can say, "I hate certain
[1:34:55] things."
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; What are they? He says, "Yay, seven are
[1:35:00] an abomination unto him." A proud look.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; So it don't even mean the pride is
[1:35:08] manifest. It's just the look.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; You know, people who look proud, the
[1:35:12] moment you start to look proud, God
[1:35:14] start to hate it.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; This is why as a believer, we could
[1:35:18] never look proud because there's nothing
[1:35:19] we could have ever done. And you can't
[1:35:21] judge nobody because the grace of God,
[1:35:23] mercy. If you ever experience mercy and
[1:35:26] grace, this is why God has to allow so
[1:35:28] many of us to fall and fail and scattle
[1:35:30] on the ground so we can recognize
[1:35:32] there's nothing to be proud about. It is
[1:35:34] just the grace of almighty God. Can the
[1:35:37] church say amen? The moment we start to
[1:35:39] feel that it's us and you achieve and
[1:35:41] you do and God has a problem with it and
[1:35:43] we see it in scripture, God has an
[1:35:45] agenda against pride.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; So you can't be proud. Well, I proud of
[1:35:49] my car. I'm proud of my job. I got a
[1:35:51] degree. I'm proud of this. I'm proud of
[1:35:52] my testimony. Once the word pride gets
[1:35:55] injected in there because there's a look
[1:35:57] in there. You don't even have to say the
[1:35:58] word. You just look at you just come out
[1:35:59] the cast. You have a certain look.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; God hates it. And we're going to get a
[1:36:04] bit more into it. Can the church say
[1:36:05] amen?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; He hates a proud look. He hates a lying
[1:36:08] tongue.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Hands that shed innocent blood and heart
[1:36:12] that devisth wicked imaginations.
[1:36:16] feet that be swift in running to
[1:36:18] mischief.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; The feet not swift to run in church,
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; but where mischief is, they're looking
[1:36:27] for it and soon they see it.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; They're quick to run to mischief.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; This is the Bible says, "Don't hate.
[1:36:33] Don't shoot the messenger."
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Don't shoot the me. I'm just the
[1:36:38] messenger this morning.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; A false witness that speaketh lies and
[1:36:43] he that sweth discord among brethren. So
[1:36:46] these brother Clarence are the things
[1:36:48] that God hate.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; We know through the word God says things
[1:36:51] that he hate the deeds of the
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; nicolatans.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; We understand these things but through
[1:36:55] scripture from Genesis to Revelation
[1:36:57] there's only one man that God say I hate
[1:36:59] that man.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; And that's a powerful statement to make
[1:37:05] to hate one man.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; So we have to begin to understand and we
[1:37:10] do it in the scripture and we're going
[1:37:12] to get a bit into it. Let me just switch
[1:37:14] my notes here.
[1:37:19] Wonderful.
[1:37:21] So as a background, we know that God
[1:37:25] started this whole foundation after man
[1:37:27] fell and all this stuff. He started a
[1:37:28] build on a foundation of faith and he
[1:37:30] called Abraham. He say leave your
[1:37:32] family, leave your background, leave
[1:37:33] your tribe, leave your nation and come
[1:37:35] follow me. And Abraham by revelation
[1:37:37] begin to seek a city whose build land
[1:37:40] maker was God. He wasn't looking for an
[1:37:42] earthly city. He was looking with the
[1:37:43] heavenly city built by the divine
[1:37:45] architect. There was a revelation in him
[1:37:47] that moved him forward. And as God began
[1:37:50] to deal with Abraham like he deals with
[1:37:51] many of us, we begin to see, wait a
[1:37:53] minute, Lord, I seeing this, I see this.
[1:37:55] And Abraham said to say, "Well, Lord,
[1:37:56] you're talking about I'm blessed, but
[1:37:58] see here, I have no children." So God
[1:38:00] say, "You have talk. No problem. Come go
[1:38:02] outside and count the stars."
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; And Abraham began to count 1 2 3. And
[1:38:06] then he said, "I'll run out of numbers."
[1:38:07] He say, "Wait, you you're done. Count,
[1:38:09] so shall thy be. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And out of Abraham, God visited him. We
[1:38:15] know all of this. I'm building it a
[1:38:16] foundation. And through the baronness of
[1:38:19] Sarah, who could have no seed, Abraham
[1:38:21] had transformation of his own body being
[1:38:23] an old man. And Sarah, who was not only
[1:38:25] barren, but old, the angel come and do a
[1:38:27] work upon them, and they end up with
[1:38:29] Isaac, the seed of the promise, the son
[1:38:30] of the promise. Can the church say amen?
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Just like his father,
[1:38:36] Isaac's wife, Rebecca, was also barren.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; And they went to the Lord. Can the
[1:38:42] church say amen?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And the Lord say, "Okay, I'm going to
[1:38:44] bless you." But within Rebecca, there
[1:38:48] was a war taking place.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And she began to question the Lord and
[1:38:53] say, "Well, Lord, how come this thing
[1:38:55] have a war in me even though is your
[1:38:57] blessing?" Because she knew it was a
[1:38:59] miracle. And many times we ask God for
[1:39:01] something, but within the blessing,
[1:39:02] within what we asked for, within God
[1:39:04] giving us something, there's a war in
[1:39:06] there. Can the church say amen? And God
[1:39:08] told Rebecca in Genesis 25:23, "And the
[1:39:11] Lord said unto God, two nations are in
[1:39:13] thy womb,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; and two manner of people shall be
[1:39:17] separated from thy bowels, and the one
[1:39:20] people shall be stronger than the other
[1:39:22] people, and the elder shall serve the
[1:39:24] younger." So even while they were in her
[1:39:26] womb, there was a war taking place.
[1:39:28] Jacob on Esau was fighting in the womb.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; There was a war in them. But the man
[1:39:32] says, "We have two natures in you
[1:39:33] fighting every day. There's a war in all
[1:39:35] of us. There's a war telling you go
[1:39:37] back. Go back to the world. And there's
[1:39:39] something in you saying keep on
[1:39:40] fighting. There's a voice saying you can
[1:39:42] make it and there's a voice saying
[1:39:43] you're not going to make it. And with
[1:39:44] the Brandom said whichever one you feed
[1:39:46] is the one that's going to take you
[1:39:48] where you need to go. You I'm preaching
[1:39:50] to you this morning. Right. So within
[1:39:52] Rebecca, Rebecca is also in that context
[1:39:54] a type of all of us. There's a if God is
[1:39:56] with me, why I having problem? That's
[1:39:58] what she was saying. But Lord, you
[1:40:00] abused you are the one give me the the
[1:40:02] child
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; and within her is an issue and but
[1:40:05] that's how God will be because God is
[1:40:07] unfolding something. Can the church say
[1:40:08] amen?
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; And we know when the child Esau was
[1:40:11] born, he was red. He was hairy and
[1:40:12] that's how we got the name Esau. And
[1:40:14] then Jacob came also. Can the church say
[1:40:17] amen?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And as the boys grew, the Bible said
[1:40:20] Esau was a cunning hunter. He was a wise
[1:40:23] man. He was a man's man. He was a man of
[1:40:26] the field. And Jacob was a simple man
[1:40:28] dwelling in the tent almost like a
[1:40:30] mama's boy. And the Bible said that that
[1:40:32] that that Rebecca loved Jacob. But Isaac
[1:40:35] loved Esau.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; All of this we should know from Sunday
[1:40:42] school, right?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; This is why Sunday school. What if you
[1:40:44] don't know this? We need to do some more
[1:40:46] work.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; This is foundational stuff. Abraham,
[1:40:49] then Isaac, and then Jacob and Isra. So
[1:40:51] we are talking about Abraham's
[1:40:53] grandchildren.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; And we are talking about the fact that
[1:40:56] they grew up in church. It grew up in
[1:40:57] the message. It grew up in the belief.
[1:40:58] Can the church say amen? But within
[1:41:00] there, we see one line going after truth
[1:41:03] and one line going the wrong way.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; And we see it today in the church. There
[1:41:06] are those going along the truth and
[1:41:08] there are those going the wrong way. Can
[1:41:09] the church say amen?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Let's build a little bit.
[1:41:13] So in Genesis 25
[1:41:16] 29
[1:41:18] the Bible said and Jacob saw pottage so
[1:41:20] he cooked he's a man of the house so he
[1:41:22] cooking a a nice meal and Esau came from
[1:41:26] the field and he was faint
[1:41:29] and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray
[1:41:32] thee from that same red pottage for I am
[1:41:36] faint and therefore his name was called
[1:41:39] Edom. Now, I want us to notice
[1:41:41] something, friends, before we go
[1:41:42] further. To this point, there was
[1:41:45] nothing you could pick against Esau.
[1:41:48] There's nothing in scripture to say Esau
[1:41:49] had an issue. And I want to go back to
[1:41:51] the Bible study on King Saul. Many
[1:41:53] people think man is who picked King
[1:41:55] Saul.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; God is the one who picked King Saul.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; God told Samuel, "They didn't reject
[1:42:02] you. They rejected me. But I will
[1:42:04] choose." Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And when God makes a choice, he has an
[1:42:08] expectation of that choice.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; We read in the Bible study, Saul was
[1:42:13] hiding. This big big tall man hiding.
[1:42:15] They had to ask the Lord, "Lord, you
[1:42:16] sure you here?" He say, "Well, look him
[1:42:18] over there."
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Because he wasn't a man trying to be in
[1:42:22] the front and show and and say, "Look at
[1:42:24] me and my muscles." And no, he was a man
[1:42:26] who was not even interested in the
[1:42:28] position.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; So, what we have here is a situation of
[1:42:31] people who starting off good.
[1:42:34] Both Saul and Esau start off good
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; to this point. There's no issue you
[1:42:39] could have against Esau. Let's go.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy
[1:42:46] birthright."
[1:42:48] Now, this is an offer. In other words,
[1:42:51] is a choice. If somebody say, "Sell me
[1:42:53] your pen. Sell me your phone." What? You
[1:42:55] could say, "No."
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; You could say, "No, I'm not selling it."
[1:43:00] In other words, this thing is too
[1:43:01] important to me to sell. This thing is
[1:43:04] so valuable. This watch I have here is
[1:43:06] my grandfather watch because this is the
[1:43:08] birthright we talking about. This is the
[1:43:10] birthright. Can is anybody in the house
[1:43:12] here? What is this birthright we talking
[1:43:14] about? But Brandon said it's the Holy
[1:43:16] Ghost. And we're going to read more
[1:43:17] about it. But the reality is this
[1:43:19] church. This was all that God gave to
[1:43:21] Abraham. Can the church say amen was
[1:43:23] wrapped up into something called his
[1:43:25] birthright
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; and Abraham had passed it on to Isaac.
[1:43:28] So thy seed shall possess the gate of
[1:43:30] the enemy. That was part of the
[1:43:32] birthright. In blessing, I will bless
[1:43:34] thee was part of the birthright. Your
[1:43:36] line will be established forever was
[1:43:38] part of the birthright. Can the church
[1:43:40] say amen? In other words, there's a
[1:43:42] value to this thing. This wasn't a
[1:43:43] natural thing. This was not even
[1:43:46] supposed to be a thing that could be
[1:43:47] sold. Can the church say amen? Because
[1:43:50] it was an eternal thing. It was a
[1:43:52] spiritual thing. It was a prophecy
[1:43:54] thing. Don't ask me to sell my
[1:43:56] birthright. It is too valuable to me.
[1:43:59] There's too much in this thing. There's
[1:44:01] too much power in this thing. There's
[1:44:03] too much this birthright could do for me
[1:44:05] to even consider selling it. It's too
[1:44:07] valuable.
[1:44:09] Esau could have said, "Hear this now. I
[1:44:11] rather faint here today than sell this
[1:44:14] birthright. This birthright have too
[1:44:16] much preaching to bring it to me. My
[1:44:18] father, my grandfather Abraham went
[1:44:20] through too much for me to give up his
[1:44:22] birthright." Can the church say amen?
[1:44:24] Jesus died on the cross for his
[1:44:26] birthright. Oh, you don't hear me this
[1:44:27] morning? God sent a prophet because of
[1:44:29] this birthright. This message of Yahwa
[1:44:31] is because of the birthright. In the
[1:44:34] birthright is miracles. In the
[1:44:36] birthright is healing. The birthright is
[1:44:38] the Holy Ghost. In the birthright is
[1:44:40] every promise of God. It's too important
[1:44:42] to sell. You don't hear me this morning.
[1:44:46] There's rapture and faith in this
[1:44:47] birthright. There's adoption in the
[1:44:49] birthright. There's these signs shall
[1:44:51] follow them that believe. That's in the
[1:44:53] birthright.
[1:44:55] Somebody preach back to me. Joy,
[1:44:57] unspeakable, and full of glory is in the
[1:44:59] birthright. There's mercy in the
[1:45:01] birthright. This birthright has my
[1:45:03] protection. This birthright will take
[1:45:05] somebody to the rapture.
[1:45:07] This birthright will change your body
[1:45:09] from mortal to immortality. This
[1:45:11] birthright will make you stop your
[1:45:12] lying. This birthright will send the
[1:45:15] devil flying. This birthright, oh, come
[1:45:18] on now. This birthright has power in and
[1:45:20] of itself. Who has the birthright has
[1:45:23] the power? Who has the birthright has
[1:45:25] the authority? Who has the birthright
[1:45:27] has the kingdom. Who has the birthright
[1:45:29] has the access. Who has the birthright?
[1:45:31] Come on now. Somebody preach back to me.
[1:45:33] Do not sell your birthright.
[1:45:37] Come on now. Come on now. Come on now.
[1:45:39] Hallelujah. Do not sell your birthright.
[1:45:44] Birthright is the inheritance. You can't
[1:45:46] earn the birthright. You can't work for
[1:45:49] the birthright. There's nothing to do to
[1:45:51] achieve the birthright. You may be
[1:45:53] seated. I want us to appreciate
[1:45:55] something, church. Esau could never earn
[1:45:58] it. Brother Anthony, all he had to do
[1:46:00] was stay in the atmosphere, stay in the
[1:46:02] channel. He was the first born of his
[1:46:04] father, Isaac. It was going to come to
[1:46:06] him automatically. You don't hear me
[1:46:08] this morning. It was going to come to
[1:46:10] him automatically. He just had to wait
[1:46:12] until his change come. Wait until his
[1:46:14] time come. All that was in God, he
[1:46:16] pulled into Christ. All that was in
[1:46:18] Christ get pulled into the church. All
[1:46:20] that God gave to Abraham went on to
[1:46:21] Isaac. All that was in Isaac was now
[1:46:23] locked up, ready to be divided.
[1:46:26] Birthright and blessing. Two things
[1:46:28] Isaac had to pass on. Birthright and
[1:46:30] blessing. Can the church say, "Amen." Do
[1:46:33] not sell your birthright. Don't give it
[1:46:35] up that easy, church. Don't walk away
[1:46:37] from your inheritance. Don't walk away
[1:46:39] from your eternity. Don't walk away from
[1:46:41] your destiny.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody preach back to me.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I want to establish a few
[1:46:53] things here. Jacob said, "Sell me the
[1:46:55] birth tri." He didn't say, "Give it to
[1:46:57] me." You know,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; he says, "Sell it to me."
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; So to say that Jacob tricked Esau is a
[1:47:05] lie.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; In fact, Esau would tell his father
[1:47:09] Isaac later on twice Jacob tricked me.
[1:47:12] That's a lie.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Because Jacob said, "Sell it to me."
[1:47:18] Amen.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; A sell is a trade or it's a transaction.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; And if you go to KFC, you go to buy a
[1:47:27] Coca-Cola, you go to buy something,
[1:47:29] somebody is selling and there has to be
[1:47:30] a value of payment
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; for the transaction to be closed.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Now, if I say to you, hear this. I have
[1:47:38] a box of KFC and it's $1,000.
[1:47:42] Anybody here will buy it?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Why not?
[1:47:48] But don't say it overpriced.
[1:47:52] In other words, but say it overpriced.
[1:47:58] But don't say overpriced.
[1:48:02] In other words,
[1:48:06] when people go into the market, instead
[1:48:07] of people going to the market, right,
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Well, how much for the
[1:48:10] oranges?" You say, "That's not good
[1:48:13] value.
[1:48:15] there's too much value or somebody say
[1:48:16] well you have to pay me more because
[1:48:17] this is too valuable. Here we have a
[1:48:20] comparison because the question being
[1:48:23] asked to Jacob was
[1:48:25] uh Jacob asking Esau sell me the
[1:48:27] birthright. And what Jacob have to pay
[1:48:29] with
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; is better upon say red beans.
[1:48:34] [Applause]
[1:48:36] What all he have to pay is a bowl of
[1:48:38] soup. Now imagine you go and try to buy
[1:48:40] a house and the man say the house is a
[1:48:42] million dollars and you say well here
[1:48:43] what you you'll you'll take a bowl of
[1:48:45] soup.
[1:48:49] This is I want you to see the picture. I
[1:48:51] want it to be clear to the young people
[1:48:53] to the children because there's a lot of
[1:48:55] information out there. It's as if
[1:48:57] they're going to buy a house because
[1:48:58] this was more than a house.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; This was more than land.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; This was more than property and money.
[1:49:04] This was the birthright of God's word to
[1:49:07] Abraham that was now being discussed
[1:49:09] into where it goes next.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And Jacob say, "All I have is a little
[1:49:14] bowl of soup,
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; but I want your house, your car, your
[1:49:17] land, your inheritance, your spiritual
[1:49:19] blessing."
[1:49:20] Anybody with me?
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Verse 32.
[1:49:27] And Esau said, "Behold, I am at the
[1:49:31] point to die.
[1:49:33] You young people say I go dead.
[1:49:37] If I don't get to say I go dead. They
[1:49:39] want to go and go to a party. Oh god. My
[1:49:41] my is is my daughter upstairs.
[1:49:47] I have to be careful saying this
[1:49:50] because what this really is is very
[1:49:52] childlike behavior
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; because Esau is saying if I don't eat
[1:49:56] this soup now I go dead. That is not
[1:49:59] true.
[1:50:01] This was a tantrum being shown. There
[1:50:03] are people say is my friend and if I
[1:50:05] don't go my whole life fall apart in a
[1:50:07] whole tantrum.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; If I look at this phone you don't love
[1:50:12] me. I want the phone. I go dead without
[1:50:15] the
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; anybody ever see that? Is it anybody
[1:50:18] ever see that kind of behavior from
[1:50:19] anybody?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; It's not just children. Even grown-ups
[1:50:23] you know something and you want
[1:50:24] something so bad and if I don't get them
[1:50:26] my life go fall apart and
[1:50:30] So, Esau is not only not seeing the
[1:50:33] value of what he has, but his temporary
[1:50:37] carnal impatient
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; position says I want to die. In other
[1:50:44] words, if I don't get this thing, I go
[1:50:45] dead. If I don't get if I don't get a
[1:50:47] car, I go dead. If I don't get a job, I
[1:50:48] go dead. If I don't get a phone, I go
[1:50:50] dead. If I don't get this outfit, if I
[1:50:51] don't get to go to this party, I go
[1:50:53] dead.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; I want to go by this friend. And if I
[1:50:55] don't go by this friend, I fell up and
[1:50:57] they see the child jumping and close the
[1:50:59] door.
[1:51:01] And then parents give up and say, "Well,
[1:51:04] all right, go go go go go." And 5, 10,
[1:51:06] 15 years later, you look back and you
[1:51:08] regret the decision because there's a
[1:51:09] lack of discipline. And there's a lack
[1:51:11] of not understanding the exchange of
[1:51:13] value. Because friends, whatever God say
[1:51:15] is valuable is valuable. It's not up to
[1:51:18] us to place value on things.
[1:51:21] Many of us are placing a value on
[1:51:23] spiritual things and God's value is
[1:51:25] different from ours. When you see the
[1:51:28] way God values things, how God values
[1:51:30] humility,
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; how God values mercy, how God values
[1:51:34] forgiveness, that's not what the world
[1:51:36] values, the world has a different value
[1:51:38] system, but God's values, the value
[1:51:40] we're talking about this morning. Can
[1:51:41] the church say amen?
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be too long with you.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Behold, I'm at the point to die. And
[1:51:48] Esau responded, "What profit shall this
[1:51:51] birthright do to me?" In other words, if
[1:51:53] I don't get this simple, carnal,
[1:51:54] natural, temporary pleasure right now,
[1:51:57] what is the value of this birthright?
[1:52:08] pleasure
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; a temporary situation
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; and this here was the beginning
[1:52:18] the beginning of the problem with Esau
[1:52:20] because Esau problem was bigger than
[1:52:22] this you know
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; but there's a beginning of problems we
[1:52:24] preach about Samson convention Timnat
[1:52:27] was the beginning Timnath led to Sorak
[1:52:29] Sorak led to Gaza
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; it was a progression it was a decline
[1:52:34] and here it is this is the point the
[1:52:37] moment you don't realize what you have.
[1:52:39] The moment you begin to take this gospel
[1:52:41] lightly, the moment you begin to take
[1:52:42] the word lightly, the moment we begin to
[1:52:44] place a different value on what this
[1:52:46] message is, something is wrong with you.
[1:52:48] And God begins to look at you different
[1:52:50] because this message is the most
[1:52:52] powerful thing on the face of the earth.
[1:52:54] It will take you to the rapture. It'll
[1:52:56] change you in your moment of crisis.
[1:52:58] When the doctor has given up on you,
[1:53:00] this is what it will take to bring you
[1:53:02] healing. When the doctor don't know your
[1:53:04] answer and you have to come for prayer,
[1:53:06] it'll be the great physician that's
[1:53:08] locked up in the birthright.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? I can't afford
[1:53:13] to trade my birthright. Hallelujah.
[1:53:16] [Applause]
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; There are hard cases in the church. We
[1:53:21] need more than blessings. We need the
[1:53:23] birthright to be in operation because
[1:53:25] the birthright is everything.
[1:53:27] [Applause]
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Come the church say amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] Hallelujah.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Verse 33.
[1:53:38] And Jacob said, "Swear to me this day."
[1:53:40] And he swear unto him. And he sold his
[1:53:44] birthright unto Jacob.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Do not sell your birthright. We're going
[1:53:50] to build now.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottish
[1:53:54] of lentils.
[1:53:57] Imagine that. You give up your old
[1:54:00] spiritual. People give up their
[1:54:01] spiritual thing for their job. For a
[1:54:04] girlfriend, for a boyfriend, for to for
[1:54:06] a party, for a cigarette, for to lime
[1:54:08] outside and and for a temporary 5
[1:54:10] minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes,
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; your whole spiritual destiny gets
[1:54:17] wrecked.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; And we read the scripture when Esau
[1:54:22] finally came to a spot to want to fix
[1:54:24] it,
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; he couldn't fix it. There was no
[1:54:27] repentance found for him because he had
[1:54:29] gone too far. Years ago, I preached a
[1:54:31] message, do not cross the line. Brother
[1:54:34] Brandham said, "I see a day coming when
[1:54:36] people come to the altar to be prayed
[1:54:38] for, but they will get nothing because
[1:54:40] mercy is finished." That's why the Bible
[1:54:42] said, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be
[1:54:45] found. Call ye upon him while he is
[1:54:47] near." You don't have all the time in
[1:54:49] the world. You don't even know what next
[1:54:51] week will hold. You don't know what
[1:54:53] tomorrow will hold. If you don't have
[1:54:54] the Holy Ghost today, I challenge you by
[1:54:57] the strength that's in here this
[1:54:58] morning. Be desperate to your spiritual
[1:55:01] inheritance. There is no substitute. Do
[1:55:04] not accept anything less than your
[1:55:06] birthright.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you came to church
[1:55:14] here for this morning, but we're not
[1:55:16] here to play games. Lives are at stake.
[1:55:19] Houses are in danger.
[1:55:21] [Applause]
[1:55:22] And decisions have consequences.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? People want to
[1:55:28] come into the house of God and go back
[1:55:30] and live any way they want. That's not
[1:55:31] how God operates. God is a God of love.
[1:55:34] He's a God of mercy. But he's a God of
[1:55:36] principles also. He's a God of his word.
[1:55:38] And if God don't keep his word, he's not
[1:55:40] God. He's a God of judgment. He's a God
[1:55:42] of mercy. He's a God of grace. He's a
[1:55:44] God of forgiveness. That's the God we
[1:55:46] serve. There are things he loves and
[1:55:48] there are things he hates. I want to be
[1:55:49] in the channel of what God loves. I
[1:55:51] don't want to have the things that God
[1:55:53] hate. I want to give value to the things
[1:55:55] that God gave value. And the thing that
[1:55:56] God said is no value. He said it's dung.
[1:55:59] It's filthiness. All of it is vanity.
[1:56:01] All of it is nothing. This world is
[1:56:03] finished.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Give me liberty or give me debt. Give me
[1:56:07] the Holy Ghost or give me debt. Your
[1:56:09] degree when the time comes has no value.
[1:56:12] Come on now. I'm not saying don't go to
[1:56:14] school. I'm not saying don't have a
[1:56:16] degree. But understand the value
[1:56:17] equation. There's a value in the
[1:56:20] spiritual things. Your eternity has a
[1:56:22] value no amount of money could pay for.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Your testimony
[1:56:29] has a value, young sister. Your
[1:56:31] testimony, your virtue, your virginity
[1:56:34] has a value. Don't sell it for a pot of
[1:56:36] soup. Don't sell it for a box of KFC.
[1:56:39] Don't sell it for temporary. Oh, you
[1:56:41] don't hear me this morning.
[1:56:43] You are worth more than that. You are
[1:56:45] royalty. You are born for a purpose. You
[1:56:48] are worth something that Christ would
[1:56:50] leave glory, change form, take your sin,
[1:56:54] go to Calvary to die for you so you
[1:56:56] could have access to the birthright.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Let me say something, church. Even
[1:57:05] though Esau sold his birthright, that
[1:57:08] birthright could not have been affected
[1:57:10] until Isaac died.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; You heard what I said? Even though Esau
[1:57:16] sold a birthright to Jacob, that
[1:57:18] birthright was ineffective until Isaac
[1:57:20] died. Because only when Isaac died could
[1:57:22] it be passed on. Hallelujah. And for us
[1:57:25] in our day until Jesus came, the
[1:57:28] birthright could not have been effective
[1:57:29] to us. But when he died on the cross,
[1:57:32] the inheritance was now made available
[1:57:34] to those who had value for the
[1:57:36] birthright. This is why Christ dying is
[1:57:38] so important because him dying unlocked
[1:57:41] the flow of the birthright in the form
[1:57:43] of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:46] for a total complete redemption.
[1:57:49] [Applause]
[1:57:52] I cannot give up this eternity. Christ
[1:57:55] died and I want to give it up for a
[1:57:56] boyfriend, for a girlfriend, for a
[1:57:58] party, to wear a mini skirt, to wear a
[1:58:00] short dress, to wear a short pants, to
[1:58:02] live in the world. Come on, you got to
[1:58:03] be crazy. All that is soup.
[1:58:07] All that is soup.
[1:58:10] [Music]
[1:58:11] I like soup on but not that kind of
[1:58:13] soup. My butt it is not worth the soup
[1:58:16] that Jacob is cooking. It could be a
[1:58:17] good chef. It could be a good deal. It
[1:58:19] could be a good offer, a good
[1:58:20] presentation. It could have garlic and
[1:58:22] ginger and spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and
[1:58:25] I don't care what it have in it. My
[1:58:27] birthright is so important. Do not sell
[1:58:29] your birthright. I want the Holy Ghost
[1:58:32] and nothing less. Adoption and nothing
[1:58:34] less. perfection and nothing less. My
[1:58:37] whole family and nothing less. As for me
[1:58:40] and my house, we will serve the Lord.
[1:58:42] It's my right.
[1:58:44] Birth right. It's my right. It's my
[1:58:48] privilege. It's my inheritance.
[1:58:51] [Applause]
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; I don't care where your son is. It's
[1:58:56] part of your birthright. I don't care
[1:58:57] where your daughter is. It's part of
[1:58:59] your birthright.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:13] Hallelujah.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Let me drop this in here in the message
[1:59:16] of thinking man filter. Brother Brandham
[1:59:19] said, "Esau thought that the birthright
[1:59:22] didn't mean what God said it did."
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. Esau thought that
[1:59:29] that birthright didn't mean what God
[1:59:32] said it did. That was the difference
[1:59:34] between life and death. In other words,
[1:59:36] Esau had an interpretation of the
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; birthright. That's right.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Because when you don't take it, because
[1:59:42] you know God is his own interpreter.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; So when you don't take it the way God
[1:59:46] presented, then you have your view of
[1:59:47] it. Well, well, if we go to church,
[1:59:49] we'll be fine. If we in the message,
[1:59:52] we'll be fine. That's not the word,
[1:59:53] right? You know,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; and I want to make a distinction. We'll
[1:59:55] preach on it. But there's a difference
[1:59:57] between the blessing and the birthright.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; And many of us, we have the blessings of
[2:00:04] the message.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; The blessings of salvation, but that's
[2:00:07] not the birthright.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel were blessed in
[2:00:10] the wilderness. Their shoes never got
[2:00:13] messed up. They closed with they got
[2:00:14] manifest blessing. Birthright was the
[2:00:16] promised land. Only Joshua, Caleb, and
[2:00:18] the young people made it into the
[2:00:20] birthright.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; They had blessings. And many of us, we
[2:00:23] come to church, well, I'm blessed. I'm
[2:00:24] too blessed to be stressed. I'm not
[2:00:26] preaching with blessing. It's good to
[2:00:27] have a blessing, but I want the
[2:00:28] birthright because the birthright I
[2:00:30] could pass on the birthright to somebody
[2:00:31] else. Can the church say on Oh, come on
[2:00:34] now. That's a seed germ in the body. Oh,
[2:00:36] come on now. Somebody preach back to me.
[2:00:38] Peter had lived with the blessing. God
[2:00:40] gave him power.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; He gave the disciples power. That wasn't
[2:00:44] the birthright.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; And they were casting out devils. Even
[2:00:48] Judas was casting out devils.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Read the Bible. Read the message. Judas
[2:00:52] was casting out devils, too. Amen.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; But Judas never made it to the
[2:00:55] birthright.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; He had blessings and God say listen
[2:00:58] don't rejoice because you have power
[2:01:00] over these things but rejoice because
[2:01:01] your name is in the book because you get
[2:01:03] name on the book it means you are on the
[2:01:05] list to get the birth right. That is the
[2:01:07] will he talking about
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; because he knew death was coming and
[2:01:11] when he died the Holy Ghost would be
[2:01:13] released to those whose name on the
[2:01:14] book. Oh come on now. That's why God is
[2:01:17] not looking at you at your condition
[2:01:18] now. He's looking at what you could
[2:01:20] become because your name is on the book.
[2:01:21] Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to preach you're happy,
[2:01:28] you know. I'm not trying to tell you all
[2:01:30] is well and all going to be right
[2:01:31] because your name in the book. That's
[2:01:32] what I'm trying to teach you.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; You have a part to do.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; You have a choice to make. You have
[2:01:39] actions to take. Decisions have
[2:01:41] consequences.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Look at walk because of the message
[2:01:47] you're going to make it
[2:01:49] the theme of every apostle. Acts 19.
[2:01:51] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:01:54] you believe?
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; I don't question that there are
[2:01:58] believers in here, but do you have
[2:01:59] something on top of your belief?
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Do you have the Holy Ghost since you
[2:02:03] believe?
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody preach back to me this morning.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; So, I want to say that again. Esau
[2:02:17] thought the birthright meant did mean
[2:02:20] what God said it did. So he had an
[2:02:23] interpretation.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; He want a piece of it. In other words,
[2:02:25] he wanted to serve God the way he wanted
[2:02:26] to. So he said this thing this all this
[2:02:28] preaching and all this shouting and all
[2:02:30] this thing about holy living and thing.
[2:02:31] I don't think it really mean that. You
[2:02:32] know,
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; I have friends who are Christians and
[2:02:35] and they not under this kind of
[2:02:36] pressure. I don't think this bird really
[2:02:38] mean what it is.
[2:02:41] Anybody with me this morning
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; in the message? Hearing, recognizing,
[2:02:47] acting on the word of God. You could
[2:02:49] take some more. All right. Cuz we here
[2:02:50] for the we here for the day and we have
[2:02:52] food at the end of service. So nobody
[2:02:53] have any.
[2:02:58] [Music]
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; You know one time Paul was preaching
[2:03:01] until somebody dead in the service.
[2:03:04] He's preaching so long. Somebody dead.
[2:03:06] He pray raise them dead and keep on
[2:03:08] preaching. He said just ignore that. You
[2:03:09] know he say just ignore that. Just stay
[2:03:11] focused because we have to we have a
[2:03:12] railroad to cut here this morning
[2:03:14] because when we finish here we have to
[2:03:15] pray for the sick and all them demons
[2:03:17] that have been trying to stress you out
[2:03:19] have a time limit. They have a expiry
[2:03:21] date.
[2:03:23] They have expiry date. You know
[2:03:27] if you know anything about me I'm very
[2:03:29] serious about when things expired. So if
[2:03:31] I get a yogurt or anything I be like
[2:03:33] where's the expiry date? So I always
[2:03:35] making an issue that the other day my
[2:03:38] daughter took some jam out the fridge
[2:03:40] and the first thing she came and say
[2:03:42] daddy this thing expired
[2:03:45] I say look how environment and things
[2:03:46] people see they start to reflect say no
[2:03:49] that that jam is good it's not expired
[2:03:53] but the demons trying to flick you
[2:03:54] expired
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; they have expiry date on them no you
[2:03:58] have no expiry date or you eternal you
[2:04:00] come from God they going back to God you
[2:04:03] had no beginning how you can have an
[2:04:04] ending If you never had a beginning and
[2:04:06] you were part of the spirit that rotated
[2:04:08] off of God and part in the mind of God
[2:04:10] from the before there was a world before
[2:04:11] how could you have an ending when you
[2:04:13] never had a beginning? You are part of
[2:04:14] God. That's why the sickness upon your
[2:04:17] body has got to go because sickness is
[2:04:19] temporary. Sickness had a beginning. You
[2:04:21] can identify when it started and today
[2:04:24] we will define when it ends.
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:28] [Applause]
[2:04:30] But you have no beginning. You have no
[2:04:32] ending because you are eternal creature.
[2:04:34] Come now on this earth to prove in this
[2:04:36] Eden, in Satan's Eden, that you could
[2:04:38] stand the test. You could stand the
[2:04:40] opposition. You could stand the
[2:04:42] pressure. Whatever the devil throws at
[2:04:43] you, you chest strap it. Lift up your
[2:04:46] head and say, "I know my redeemer live
[2:04:47] it. The Lord gives. The Lord takes away.
[2:04:50] Blessed be the name of the Lord." Though
[2:04:52] the skinworm destroy this body, yet in
[2:04:54] my flesh I will see God. There's a
[2:04:56] resurrection. There's a promise. There's
[2:04:58] a power.
[2:05:14] Can the church say amen?
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; So we back to our scripture.
[2:05:20] Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage
[2:05:22] of lentils and he did eat and drink and
[2:05:27] rose up and went his way as if he didn't
[2:05:30] do anything. Imagine that. He eat and
[2:05:33] then went yes went away.
[2:05:37] And God, this is God's commentary on the
[2:05:40] transaction. Thus Esau despised
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; his birthright. That word despise is a
[2:05:49] powerful word you know it's just like
[2:05:50] hate. It means reject. It means devalue.
[2:05:54] So when God saw that he say this man
[2:05:57] value I give him something and that's
[2:05:58] how we treat it.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; God looked at that. Esau say he he hated
[2:06:06] it. No he say I despised it. But when
[2:06:09] God saw his attitude towards the
[2:06:11] birthright, his attitude towards the
[2:06:13] things of God, his attitude to what God
[2:06:15] promised him, when God saw his attitude
[2:06:18] towards it, he say, "Nah, he don't want
[2:06:19] this thing." He despised the birthight.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; What is our attitude towards the house
[2:06:23] of God, towards the things of God,
[2:06:25] towards the people of God, towards the
[2:06:27] promises of God, towards the inheritance
[2:06:29] of God, towards the birthright, towards
[2:06:31] the Holy Ghost?
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Will God look at us and say, "Boy, like
[2:06:36] you despise this thing, boy.
[2:06:39] Oh, will God be able to say no?
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; He wants it.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; in the message question and answers
[2:06:49] 1959. But there's one thing Jacob wanted
[2:06:52] and that was the birthright. Regardless
[2:06:55] of what come, how he had to get it, what
[2:06:58] level he had to come on, that birthright
[2:07:00] was all he cared for. And Esau, the
[2:07:02] Bible said, despise his birthright. The
[2:07:04] Bible said that. And the Bible said,
[2:07:06] "Except there come some vain fornicator
[2:07:09] among you, like that evil person, Esau,
[2:07:11] who despised his birthright and sold it
[2:07:14] for me or pottage." Now, what is a
[2:07:16] birthright? It's the right. That's what
[2:07:18] I'm trying to tell you. This Holy Spirit
[2:07:20] is your birthright.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; That's your birthright. That's your
[2:07:23] God-given right. Now, people say today,
[2:07:26] "I'll go to church. I'm just as good as
[2:07:27] the next fellow. But me, act like one of
[2:07:29] them holy rollers." Not me. Well, you
[2:07:30] see, Esau, so you say when you start to
[2:07:32] talk, so you see Esau, it's just the
[2:07:34] same thing. despising the birthright,
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; he swapped it for a mess of pottage
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; in hearing recognizing, acting on the
[2:07:42] word of God, Jacob, the reason that he
[2:07:44] chose to find that birthright
[2:07:46] regardless. He wanted to get it because
[2:07:48] he knowed that birthright held the
[2:07:50] blessings. It held life. He didn't care
[2:07:52] how it come. Just so he got it. That was
[2:07:54] the main thing. What plane it came on
[2:07:56] didn't matter. Hallelujah.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; He wanted it and he must have it and he
[2:08:01] got it. Blessed are they that do hunger
[2:08:03] and thirst for righteousness. They shall
[2:08:05] be filled. He was on his own. He was
[2:08:07] after it and he received it. Can the
[2:08:09] church give the Lord a shout of praise?
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Could we say some more things, church?
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Anybody sleeping? Deacon, just check.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; If anybody sleeping, just point them out
[2:08:29] to me.
[2:08:31] Let's give him a friendly call
[2:08:35] to acknowledge him.
[2:08:37] So, let's go. So, it's easy to say that
[2:08:42] Esau despised the birthright and given
[2:08:43] the birthright. And that was all that
[2:08:45] there was to hate about Esau.
[2:08:48] What we have just discussed is what
[2:08:50] should be covered in Sunday school.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Now, let's begin to push a little bit.
[2:08:56] Now
[2:08:57] at that time there were like three lines
[2:09:01] bloodlines or family lines. There was
[2:09:04] the descendants of Canaan. Canaan was
[2:09:06] Noah's grandson. So you had Noah, Ham,
[2:09:09] Canaan. From Canaan the Canaanites.
[2:09:12] Canaan had a son named Het. Out of Het
[2:09:14] come the Hittites. So all of these names
[2:09:17] have a generational origin. So from
[2:09:20] Israel became the Israelites. Are we
[2:09:22] together?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; All right. from Canaan who the grandson
[2:09:25] of Noah came the Canaanites. Kaan had a
[2:09:27] son named Het. Out of Het came the
[2:09:29] Hittites. So all of these out of Lot
[2:09:30] came
[2:09:32] Moab which was the Moabites. So each of
[2:09:34] these you could trace back the line and
[2:09:36] this is where it starts to get important
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; to see how God sees things and why God
[2:09:42] treat things a certain way and why we
[2:09:44] have to be so careful and not not pull
[2:09:47] punches when it comes to what is what
[2:09:49] God sees as right and what is wrong. Can
[2:09:50] the church say amen?
[2:09:54] Esau despising the birthright was the
[2:09:56] beginning of the end because the moment
[2:09:58] he walked away, the moment he devalued
[2:10:00] the birthright, he began to value other
[2:10:02] things.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Let me say that one more time.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; The moment you lose the value of God's
[2:10:07] word, his promise, his purpose, his
[2:10:09] plan, his destiny, what he's doing. The
[2:10:11] moment you say that is not important to
[2:10:13] me, other things become more important.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; How your friends feel become more
[2:10:17] important because you're basically
[2:10:18] saying what God wants is not important.
[2:10:20] So I need to go and meet my friends. Why
[2:10:22] not in church? Well, we're friends.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; The only way you could reach that spot
[2:10:26] is because you've already determined
[2:10:28] that what God says is valuable is no
[2:10:30] longer valuable. Can the church say
[2:10:32] amen? But the brand would say people
[2:10:33] miss Wednesday night church because they
[2:10:35] want to watch TV.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; For you to reach that point, it means
[2:10:38] you see God's word and value as not
[2:10:40] important and then TV become more
[2:10:42] valuable.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Because everybody have the same 24 hours
[2:10:46] in a day. You know,
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; nobody have 36, nobody have 12, same
[2:10:50] hours in a day. You have a choice with
[2:10:52] how you spend the time.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get to somewhere. So the
[2:10:55] question you have to ask yourself is,
[2:10:57] what do you value? Because for you to
[2:10:59] value worldly music, you have to give up
[2:11:01] the value God has on spiritual things.
[2:11:03] Can the church say amen? For you to
[2:11:05] value the boy in the world or the
[2:11:06] worldly style and fashion, you cannot
[2:11:08] just value it unless you give up what's
[2:11:11] more valuable.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:11:15] Now when I preach on Samson and I talk
[2:11:18] about Timnat, I say he'd have never end
[2:11:20] up with a girl in Timnat if he had
[2:11:21] stayed with his people.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Anybody remember that?
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; So after Esau
[2:11:29] despise the birthright and lose the
[2:11:32] value of the birthright in Genesis 26
[2:11:36] verse 34. And the Bible says, "And Esau
[2:11:38] was 40 years old when he took to wife
[2:11:41] Judith." No offense to anybody named
[2:11:43] Judith.
[2:11:45] the daughter of Bry the Hitittite
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; and Bashimat the daughter of Elon the
[2:11:51] Hitittite.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; So the moment he despised the birthright
[2:11:55] he went and marry a Hitittite
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; and this begins to get important and
[2:12:02] we'll see why it begins getting
[2:12:03] important in a in a few minutes
[2:12:06] because the Bible goes on next verse
[2:12:08] which were a grief of mind unto Isaac
[2:12:11] and to Rebecca. In other words, this
[2:12:12] thing stress out Isaac and Rebecca
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; in so much. And when it was Jacob time,
[2:12:18] the Bible said that that Rebecca said if
[2:12:21] Jacob only go after a daughter of Heth,
[2:12:23] which is the Hittites,
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; it life not even worth living anymore.
[2:12:29] We can't get to all the scriptures, but
[2:12:30] I'm building into something. So, I want
[2:12:33] us to understand young people,
[2:12:36] especially you younger ones. Well, I
[2:12:37] want a boyfriend and I want a girlfriend
[2:12:39] and I want this.
[2:12:42] You have to know where you're standing
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; because if you go after the birthright
[2:12:46] and after the spiritual things, God will
[2:12:48] take care of you. You know, but don't
[2:12:49] make Esau's mistake
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; because we're building into a case of
[2:12:53] why God hated Esau. It was a sequence of
[2:12:56] things. In the case of King Saul, it's
[2:12:58] two things made Saul rejected. Not one,
[2:13:01] two things.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; The first was when he did what he was
[2:13:04] not supposed to do. When God through
[2:13:06] Samuel says, "I am going to perform the
[2:13:09] sacrifice. Wait seven days." And Saul
[2:13:12] took it upon himself to say, "Well, I
[2:13:14] don't need to wait on Samuel. I'm a
[2:13:15] king."
[2:13:17] He was not a priest. He was not a
[2:13:19] prophet. And he offered a sacrifice. And
[2:13:21] when Samuel came and say, "What have you
[2:13:22] done?" And God said, "Because you did
[2:13:25] this thing, I'm going to cut off the
[2:13:26] kingdom."
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; So had s had Saul not done that, he
[2:13:30] would have had the kingdom.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; That was the first strike against King
[2:13:34] Saul. And the second was when he didn't
[2:13:37] kill King Aag.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; And we'll talk about that in a minute as
[2:13:39] well. But I wanted to see this. So to
[2:13:42] show you how God is viewing this thing.
[2:13:44] So the first thing, brother George, that
[2:13:46] Esau went to marry these Hittite girls
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; which were a grief of mine to Isaac and
[2:13:51] Rebecca. And he not a fool. By the time
[2:13:55] we reach to Genesis 28 verse8,
[2:14:01] Genesis 28:8, I've given you the
[2:14:03] brothers back a little few minutes. And
[2:14:05] Esau
[2:14:07] seeing that the daughters of Canaan,
[2:14:09] talking about the ones he married,
[2:14:11] pleased not Isaac, his father. So you're
[2:14:13] not a fool. You don't know what pleased
[2:14:15] God.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Nobody here is a fool. when he
[2:14:21] recognized that he made a out in his
[2:14:23] decision and it pleased not his father.
[2:14:26] Verse 9, then went Esau unto Ishmael. So
[2:14:29] there are three lines is the Canaanites,
[2:14:32] the Ishraelites and the descendants of
[2:14:33] Isaac. So Esau trying to fix the problem
[2:14:36] but he had gone from the Hittites to uh
[2:14:39] in his own tribe you know he going to
[2:14:40] the next one.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; So there's a still a level in him that
[2:14:45] can't come to the full truth.
[2:14:47] He give up the Hitittite but but oh God
[2:14:49] the compromise in him now because he why
[2:14:51] he already give up the birthright.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning?
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; So the Bible said and Esau seeing that
[2:14:57] the daughters of Canaan pleased not
[2:14:59] Isaac his father.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Then Esau then went Esau unto Ishmael
[2:15:05] and took unto the wives which he had
[2:15:07] Mahalat the daughter of Ishmael
[2:15:09] Abraham's son the sister of Nebajot to
[2:15:11] be his wife.
[2:15:14] So all is God building a strike,
[2:15:16] building a case against Esau.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; A word to the wise is sufficient in
[2:15:19] their church.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; This is why the prophet say under no
[2:15:22] circumstances a believer marry an
[2:15:24] unbeliever
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; because we're trying to protect you from
[2:15:26] certain things.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; It is the word. All right. Good. Let's
[2:15:29] go.
[2:15:32] Esau
[2:15:34] in his heart. The Bible says because of
[2:15:37] what Jacob has done to me,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; I want to kill him.
[2:15:42] Anybody with me?
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, because he do me, this
[2:15:45] is what he didn't say it audibly. It was
[2:15:48] in his heart.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Rebecca picked up on it. Tell Jacob, "Go
[2:15:51] and hide." Eventually, they reconciled
[2:15:54] in Genesis 33. And the Bible said, "And
[2:15:56] Esau ran to meet him and embraced him
[2:15:58] and fell on his neck and kissed him and
[2:16:00] they wept." But that was only external
[2:16:03] punch because that hug and that shake
[2:16:05] hand and that God bless you things
[2:16:07] behind us. Let let bygones be bygones
[2:16:09] water under the bridge. It was just
[2:16:11] words because the problem was in his
[2:16:13] heart. And I want to show the moment you
[2:16:15] sell your birthright, you'll be you're
[2:16:16] just going down and down and down. And a
[2:16:18] root of bitterness was born in Esau's
[2:16:21] heart.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Everybody with
[2:16:24] me.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Now, let's build to show how the
[2:16:28] decision start to have consequences.
[2:16:29] Now, now the Bible said Esau equal to
[2:16:32] Edom
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; multiple times.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; And God still gives Esau a blessing. He
[2:16:39] doesn't have the birthright because you
[2:16:40] would recall when when Rebecca heard
[2:16:44] that Isaac was about to give the
[2:16:45] birthright and Isaac told Esau, "Go and
[2:16:48] kill her animal and cook a meal because
[2:16:49] I want to bless you." Rebecca, well,
[2:16:51] bless her heart. Rebecca said, "Jacob,
[2:16:53] come come." Esau, go on and go and hunt
[2:16:56] here. Let's go and get some kids. Let me
[2:16:57] cook a nice little stew to cook and you
[2:17:00] get the blessing. But Jacob said, "Don't
[2:17:01] fool." He said, "But listen, mom, my
[2:17:03] hand smooth, Esau handy." She said, "I
[2:17:06] will fix that. put this thing here. She
[2:17:09] wants to roll him in the dirt because we
[2:17:10] know when Isaac came to try to bless, he
[2:17:13] said, "Who is this?" He say, "Your son,
[2:17:15] Esau." He said, "But you're sing like
[2:17:16] Jacob. Let me feel your hand." Because
[2:17:18] Isaac was blind. Let me feel your hand.
[2:17:19] He said, "You're feeling like Esau. Let
[2:17:21] me smell you. You're smelling like Esau,
[2:17:23] but you're sing like Jacob." And at that
[2:17:25] point, Isaac pronounced the blessing
[2:17:26] upon him.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen." And we
[2:17:30] learned that when God pronounced a
[2:17:31] blessing on you, he can't take it back.
[2:17:34] He can't take it back. So Jacob there,
[2:17:37] his hands raised, his father Isaac put
[2:17:39] his hand on him and said to pronounce a
[2:17:41] blessing that thy seed shall possess the
[2:17:44] gy and everything that was in Abraham
[2:17:46] that passed through him was now passing
[2:17:48] to his son Jacob. Can the church say
[2:17:50] amen?
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Which was confirmation of the birthright
[2:17:54] blessing.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; We building into something.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Esau now missed the surface.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; He was hunting. It was no fault of his
[2:18:04] at this point bear in mind he don't sell
[2:18:06] the bird any heart. So he going through
[2:18:08] the motion he reach with the nice animal
[2:18:10] and he cook the nice food and he bring
[2:18:12] the food for the father and the father
[2:18:14] say what is this I just eat who is this
[2:18:17] he say where is he? So he say who is
[2:18:19] just here
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; he said but son I done I done the
[2:18:22] blessing done gone
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; the birthright done gone I give blessing
[2:18:27] upon blessing upon blessing.
[2:18:30] Anybody with me this morning?
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; And Esau said, "But wait now, you don't
[2:18:34] have anything left to give me.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have any can of blessing
[2:18:37] self."
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; And and Isaac said, "Well, all right.
[2:18:39] I'll still bless you." And he pronounced
[2:18:41] a blessing upon him. Still,
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; no birth, right? But he was blessed.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, "By the sword you shall
[2:18:47] live and all this stuff, but the reality
[2:18:49] is Esau still left with a blessing."
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Even though God hated him, oh, let me be
[2:18:55] careful. He still had a blessing.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; So God can have a problem with somebody
[2:19:04] but a George
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; and still bless them. Oh God help me
[2:19:07] this morning
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; because before he was born God already
[2:19:15] determined he hate him.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; So God can have a problem with somebody
[2:19:19] and still bless them. This is why when
[2:19:21] David say how are these people blessed
[2:19:23] around me? God asks the question have
[2:19:25] you considered their end?
[2:19:28] Because what we preaching about is the
[2:19:29] end of the story, not the blessing, not
[2:19:31] who have the house and the car and this
[2:19:33] and that. Have you considered the end
[2:19:35] because many have run the race. The race
[2:19:36] is not for the swift, but for those who
[2:19:38] endure until the end. I've run my race.
[2:19:42] I've finished my course. I've kept the
[2:19:44] faith.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody give God a shout of praise.
[2:19:50] So I want to encourage you this morning.
[2:19:52] What blessing God pronounced upon your
[2:19:54] life could never be taken back. His
[2:19:56] blessing is permanent. His word, as
[2:19:59] brother Andrew said, could never return
[2:20:00] void. If God said you're going to be
[2:20:02] healed, healing has got to come to you.
[2:20:04] I believe it could happen today. I
[2:20:06] believe it could happen today.
[2:20:08] [Applause]
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:20:13] [Applause]
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; So, Esau equals Edom. still having a
[2:20:24] blessing and God gave them land. He gave
[2:20:27] them land, Mount Sir.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; So when in scripture you see Esau or you
[2:20:33] see Edom or you see Mount Sir or you see
[2:20:36] Edomia, which is the Greek for Edom, is
[2:20:38] all the same thing he's talking about.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; True scripture, four words define this
[2:20:42] issue. Because when God speaks about
[2:20:44] Israel, he speaks about Israel the man,
[2:20:46] Israel the people, Israel the land,
[2:20:48] Israel the promise. It's all one.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; So, thus Esau
[2:20:59] in Genesis 36, thus dwelt Esau in Mount
[2:21:02] Sir. And we know Esau is equal to Edom.
[2:21:06] And God, because he knows it, he told
[2:21:08] Israel, I want us to understand this
[2:21:10] because this is wisdom. This is sibling
[2:21:12] rivalry in its highest form.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Could his two brothers be speaking
[2:21:16] about? Yes.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Good. God told the children of Israel in
[2:21:20] Deuteronomy, "Med meddle not with them,
[2:21:21] telling Israel, don't meddle with Saul,
[2:21:24] with with with Esau and Edom and Mount
[2:21:26] Serum, for I will not give you of their
[2:21:29] land."
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; So God is telling Israel, the land I
[2:21:33] give to Esau, leave him with it. It's
[2:21:35] not yours.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Respect the boundaries. There are some
[2:21:39] boundaries you have to respect
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; because God could have a problem with
[2:21:43] somebody. It's not your problem.
[2:21:47] Could I say that again?
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Plenty of us like to take on God fights,
[2:21:51] you know.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; God have a problem. Is God have the
[2:21:56] problem with Esau? You know, so Jacob
[2:21:57] Carfield led to say, "Well, we taking
[2:21:59] all the land including that one because
[2:22:00] that one is a problem. We taking that
[2:22:01] too."
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Let me make the point clear. God could
[2:22:05] have a problem with somebody. It's not
[2:22:06] your problem.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Because God still gave Esau that land.
[2:22:11] Amen.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, not so much as a foot
[2:22:15] breath because I have given Mount Seir
[2:22:17] unto Esau for opposition."
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; In fact, God told Israel when you pass
[2:22:23] through their land, pay them for
[2:22:25] everything.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Don't even have no expectation. Don't
[2:22:28] say, "Well, because it's my brother."
[2:22:29] Plenty of us have the same because well,
[2:22:30] it's my brother, he's supposed to give
[2:22:32] me. Yes.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; God said when you pass through that
[2:22:34] land, pay them. Walk with your money.
[2:22:36] Walk with your credit card. Don't don't
[2:22:37] don't have no expectation. You go into
[2:22:39] the house, carry food.
[2:22:43] pay them for it. I'm reading this. This
[2:22:45] is the This is the Bible, right?
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Because God was establishing boundaries
[2:22:49] because he was also seeing what Jacob
[2:22:51] couldn't even see.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Because when Jacob hugged Esau, he
[2:22:56] thought the reconciliation was real.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning?
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; He thought it was his tears. The Bible
[2:23:02] said they wept to know.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Friends, if you have a come and hug you
[2:23:06] and crying and think,
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; I would think it done.
[2:23:10] a punch. If you have beef with somebody
[2:23:12] for years and I see you hugging both all
[2:23:15] your crying and I say, "Well, they both
[2:23:17] delivered all dropped everything in the
[2:23:18] past." Hallelujah. Glory to God. But God
[2:23:21] seeing the heart
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; and seeing that weeping day is a show.
[2:23:25] Is Oscars coming? Is the Oscars or
[2:23:27] Grammy? One of them is the Oscar is have
[2:23:29] a Oscar award
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; for that weeping and hugging and there
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; brother leave church. It look things
[2:23:35] make right and thing but between there
[2:23:37] is a root of bitterness.
[2:23:41] after the hug, after the crying and God
[2:23:44] seeing that root of bitterness.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; And the problem with a root of
[2:23:47] bitterness is root of bitterness to get
[2:23:49] hold of other people.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; So it passed from father to son to
[2:23:57] grandson. The root of bitterness and
[2:23:58] we'll see it in a second. All right,
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; church say amen.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Could you take some more?
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; But pastor say cast up now. is normally
[2:24:08] brother Clarence that has hold me but
[2:24:10] the pastor say I cast off now I want to
[2:24:12] go to because we've preached about this
[2:24:14] brother but Terren know but Terren loves
[2:24:15] this kind of thing here in in in Genesis
[2:24:18] 36
[2:24:20] verse let's go down to verse
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; uh Genesis 36 verse 10
[2:24:27] these
[2:24:30] Genesis 36:10
[2:24:32] brothers
[2:24:34] I want to make sure the people see it
[2:24:35] with
[2:24:36] All right. Genesis 36:10. These are the
[2:24:39] names of Esau's sons. So, I want to
[2:24:42] start to show you now how this thing
[2:24:43] start to connect the dots. Elephas, the
[2:24:46] son of Adam, the wife of Esau. Ruel, the
[2:24:50] son of Bashimat, the wife of Esau. Let's
[2:24:53] go. And the sons of Elephas was Teman,
[2:24:56] Omar, Zeo, and Gatam, and Kenaz. Go on.
[2:25:00] And Temna was concubine to Eleif's
[2:25:02] Esau's son, and she bear to Elephaz
[2:25:05] Amalecch.
[2:25:07] Now, we preach about Amalcch plenty
[2:25:09] times. This is the father of the
[2:25:11] Amalachites.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; So when we preach, you should have
[2:25:17] killed all the Amalachites.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Saul lost the kingdom because he didn't
[2:25:22] kill King A who was king of the
[2:25:24] Amalachites. So in other words, if Esau
[2:25:27] didn't be misbehave, he wouldn't have a
[2:25:29] grandson called Amalecch.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; So when God say I hate Esau, it's not
[2:25:36] just Esau the man. Esau grandson is
[2:25:38] Amalecch who was of the Amalachites who
[2:25:41] was one of the worst enemies of Israel
[2:25:42] from generation to generation in so much
[2:25:45] that God keep reminding them remember
[2:25:48] what Amalecch did. Remember what Amalcch
[2:25:50] did. Remember what Amalecch did. When
[2:25:52] you came out of Egypt and you had no
[2:25:54] army and you were weak and you were
[2:25:56] tired, Amalecch waited for you and
[2:25:59] punished you. What reason did Amalecch
[2:26:01] have to go after them? Israel had no
[2:26:04] beef with nobody. They were 400 years
[2:26:06] under Egyptian prison.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; But the root of bitterness from their
[2:26:12] great great great grandfather was
[2:26:14] sitting in the tribe all the
[2:26:16] generations. So when Israel came out of
[2:26:18] Egypt with no army, with no weapons,
[2:26:22] with no defense, they were tired. They
[2:26:24] were just happy to be free. The Bible
[2:26:26] said Amalecch was waiting for them.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; And God say, "I hate that thing, boy."
[2:26:32] because they
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amalcch would become Israel's worst
[2:26:42] enemy all the way to Esther
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; when Hmon Hmon was an Agagite
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; which is of in other words Hmon was a so
[2:26:50] these are so what we show is the
[2:26:52] descendants of Esau so Esau is not a
[2:26:54] genesis story
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; because Esau become Edom Edom is mount
[2:27:01] sir mount series Idomia the grandson is
[2:27:03] Amalcch who is all the Amalachites
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; and what God saying had Esau kept the
[2:27:11] birthright no Amalcch would be there
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; had he stayed in line because even
[2:27:16] listen even after he gave up the
[2:27:18] birthright he didn't have to go and
[2:27:20] marry the Mites he didn't have to go and
[2:27:21] do those things come on now somebody
[2:27:22] preach back to me because even even Cain
[2:27:26] and Abel without a revelation God told
[2:27:30] Cain listen Abel I the sacrifice. I know
[2:27:32] you'd have a revelation, but if you at
[2:27:33] least do what your brother do, I'll
[2:27:34] still bless you.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; So, no matter how far you go, you still
[2:27:39] have a choice. But people like to go
[2:27:41] down the slippery slide. Well, I don't
[2:27:42] mess up here, so I go worse. I don't
[2:27:44] mess up here, I go worse. Cut it today
[2:27:46] and start to reverse your steps.
[2:27:47] Repentance means to change your mind,
[2:27:49] change your way, change your behavior,
[2:27:51] change your attitude.
[2:27:53] Because if you don't change, it gets
[2:27:55] worse.
[2:28:00] Anybody in the house this morning?
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Exodus 17 was Amalecch's first attack on
[2:28:08] Israel. We're going to say a few things.
[2:28:09] They're trying to find a place to close
[2:28:11] off, but the pastor don't say go
[2:28:12] already. So
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Exodus 17:8, then came Amalecch and
[2:28:17] fought with Israel and referred him. And
[2:28:19] Moses said unto Joshua, so you see in
[2:28:22] this thing with Esau, now reach Moses
[2:28:23] table.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; You see how problems could move? Yes.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; So this is not a Jacob problem. Now it
[2:28:29] go now to Israel. Under Moses and
[2:28:30] Joshua. Now Esau to them now is now
[2:28:32] Amalecch.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Which is the grandson of Esau.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Moses said unto Joshua, choose out men
[2:28:40] and go out fight with Amalecch. Tomorrow
[2:28:42] I will stand on the top of the hill with
[2:28:44] the rod of God in mine hand. Now we see
[2:28:45] the context of how these things begin to
[2:28:47] connect because God is seeing from
[2:28:49] Genesis to Revelation. He's seeing from
[2:28:50] eternity into time back into eternity.
[2:28:52] And Joshua discomforted Amalecch and his
[2:28:55] people with the edge of the sword.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Moses, "Write
[2:29:00] this." This is how important this is to
[2:29:02] God.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Write this for a memorial in a book
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua.
[2:29:09] In other words, make sure Joshua have
[2:29:11] this clear, clear, clear.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; For I will utterly put out the
[2:29:15] remembrance of Amalecch from under
[2:29:17] heaven.
[2:29:20] Hallelujah.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; And Moses built an altar and called the
[2:29:23] name of it Jehovah Nissi.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; So when we talk about Jehovah Nissi,
[2:29:26] this was the context of even the
[2:29:28] establishing of that name.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; For he said, "Behold, the Lord had sworn
[2:29:32] that the Lord will have war with
[2:29:33] Amalecch from generation to generation."
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; And we going on now. We talking about
[2:29:40] why God hate Esau
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; and what happens when you choose to give
[2:29:44] up your birthright. Do not sell your
[2:29:46] birthright, church. Let's go in
[2:29:47] Deuteronomy 25:17.
[2:29:50] Remember what Amalecch did unto thee by
[2:29:52] the way
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; when you were come forth out of Egypt.
[2:29:55] Imagine you now get a breakthrough. You
[2:29:57] now get delivered. You now get free. And
[2:29:59] the enemy they trying to punish you. God
[2:30:01] say listen you see when somebody getting
[2:30:03] free time is the time to give them the
[2:30:05] space to get free.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Hear the demonic spirit because with a
[2:30:08] brand call it a Esau spirit.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; So I'm not preaching history. I'm
[2:30:13] preaching the spirit operating today.
[2:30:15] Brother Brandham say spirits don't die.
[2:30:17] We know this.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Spirits move on. The spirit of Elijah
[2:30:22] rest on Elijah. God took the spirit of
[2:30:24] Moses and divided across seven 70 men.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; When Jesus met Legion, these spirits say
[2:30:31] don't cast us back into the bottomless
[2:30:33] pit, throw us into the pigs. Spirit's
[2:30:34] looking for some place. So the spirit of
[2:30:36] Esau is operating today.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; And if God sees it, he has an agenda
[2:30:42] against it because something he hates.
[2:30:44] Can the church say amen?
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 25:17, remember what
[2:30:52] Amalecch did unto thee. By the way, when
[2:30:54] you were come forth out of Egypt, how he
[2:30:57] met thee, by the way, and smokeote
[2:30:58] behind most of the the weaker ones,
[2:31:00] they're always weaker ones. And God say
[2:31:03] that he went after the weaker ones,
[2:31:04] those that are struggling.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; And church, the enemy want to take out
[2:31:07] the weaker ones. The enemy want to come
[2:31:09] into your family and find all the
[2:31:11] weakness and destroy the weaker ones and
[2:31:13] put pressure on you and stress you out.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; The devil not trying to go after these
[2:31:18] strong ones. He want to take out the
[2:31:19] weaker ones.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; Those that now trying to get stabilized.
[2:31:22] The enemy is after you is a Esau spirit
[2:31:24] we dealing with. Can the church say
[2:31:26] amen? But we identifying it this morning
[2:31:28] and say not one shall be left behind. We
[2:31:30] will draw our swords and fight back to
[2:31:32] back soldier to soldier against the
[2:31:34] Amalachites under the against the
[2:31:36] Hittites, the Jebusite, the Canaanite. I
[2:31:38] don't care what kind of it is today. We
[2:31:40] serve all the itites. Notice every giant
[2:31:42] will fall. Every ite will fall.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; There's power in our birthright. We are
[2:31:49] not giving it up. We know what the
[2:31:51] birthright is. We are holding on to it.
[2:31:53] I mean the Bible will give us power over
[2:31:55] every spirit over doubt, fear, lust,
[2:31:58] unbelief, pornography, adultery,
[2:32:00] whatever it is. In the name of Jesus
[2:32:02] Christ, house of hell, give way to the
[2:32:04] name of Jesus, you shall be free. And
[2:32:07] who the son of man sets free is free
[2:32:09] indeed. Somebody say free indeed.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Free indeed.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:32:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 25, we're still here. 17
[2:32:22] Remember what Amalecch did unto thee by
[2:32:24] the way when you were come forth out of
[2:32:25] Egypt. How he met thee by the way and
[2:32:28] smoke behind most of thee, even all that
[2:32:30] were feeble behind thee. When thou was
[2:32:32] faint and weary, and he feared not God.
[2:32:35] So God looked at it. Friends, when
[2:32:37] somebody down, isn't it time to kick
[2:32:39] them down?
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; How many time people struggling and
[2:32:42] instead of you giving an encouraging
[2:32:44] word, you you want to push them down?
[2:32:46] Amen.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; God is looking at the spirit of Esau and
[2:32:50] saying, "My people were in trouble.
[2:32:52] There were those weak and faint and
[2:32:54] weary."
[2:32:56] And God goes on, "Therefore, it shall be
[2:32:58] when the Lord thy God had given thee
[2:32:59] rest from all thine enemies round about
[2:33:02] in the land which the Lord thy God given
[2:33:03] thee for inheritance to possess it, that
[2:33:06] thou shalt blot out the remembrance of
[2:33:09] Amalecch from under heaven. Thou shalt
[2:33:11] not forget it." Amen.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; And this is what God brought to King
[2:33:15] Saul. He said, "Remember what Amalecch
[2:33:18] did? Wipe them out."
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; And instead of Saul doing his job, he
[2:33:22] kept Aag and he kept animals and all
[2:33:24] this kind of thing.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Helping keep the line alive.
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; I'll skip a few things.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; I want to go to the book of
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Oadiah.
[2:33:41] How many people love the book of Oadiah?
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Half of you I read the book of Oaya.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Obadia is one of those prophets. Most
[2:33:57] people not never spend time looking at
[2:33:58] it. Look at Ezekiel and Jeremiah and
[2:34:00] Malachi and Isaiah and and all these
[2:34:05] prophets. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, all these
[2:34:06] prophets prophesied to Israel, about
[2:34:10] Israel, for Israel. Their focus was
[2:34:11] Israel.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Obadiah was the only prophet who had a
[2:34:16] dedicated ministry to deal with Esau.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; To deal with Edom and to deal with this
[2:34:22] issue. So, he's the Esau specialist
[2:34:24] among the prophets.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Obadiah 1 vers1. The vision of
[2:34:29] Obadiah, thus said the Lord God
[2:34:31] concerning Edom. He starts off calling
[2:34:34] out the spirit.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord God concerning
[2:34:37] Edom. We have heard a rumor from the
[2:34:39] Lord, and an ambassador is sent among
[2:34:41] the heathen. Arise he and let us rise up
[2:34:43] against her in battle.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Behold, I have made thee small among the
[2:34:49] heathen. Thou art greatly despised.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; So God is saying, Edom, you are greatly
[2:34:53] despised.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; And it's not just that they despis, you
[2:34:57] know, but he wants to give context about
[2:34:59] what about the Esau spirit, what God
[2:35:01] would like. Can we see a consistency?
[2:35:03] When we read about the six things God
[2:35:05] hate, he start with a proud look.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; Look at how he start to speak about what
[2:35:09] he doesn't like about Edom.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Verse three, the pride of thine
[2:35:14] heartath.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Thou that dwellest in the cliff of the
[2:35:19] rock. So he said, Edom, Esau, Mount
[2:35:22] Siri, the Edomians, all you have pride.
[2:35:25] You're in the cliff of the rock. You
[2:35:27] think you're untouchable.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; There are people who think you're
[2:35:29] untouchable.
[2:35:30] that we so we start to describe the Esau
[2:35:32] spirit. I'm not going to be too much
[2:35:33] longer with you, but I want you to see
[2:35:35] how the Esau spirit moving from age to
[2:35:37] age.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Thou that dwellest in the cliff of the
[2:35:40] rock whose habitation is high and say it
[2:35:43] in his heart, who shall bring me down to
[2:35:45] the ground?
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; So people who saying I can't fall, I
[2:35:49] can't make no mistake. I think I top of
[2:35:51] the world. I think this thing and this
[2:35:53] is what God saying. This is what he's
[2:35:54] saying in your heart. You're not telling
[2:35:55] anybody listen.
[2:35:57] the spirit of Esau.
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; Listen to what God says through Oah.
[2:36:02] Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle,
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; and though thou set thy nest among the
[2:36:07] stars, then will I bring thee down, said
[2:36:09] the Lord.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; So God is saying the higher you try to
[2:36:13] go, if that spirit I will bring you
[2:36:14] down.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; So church, you don't have to bring no
[2:36:17] God watching the spirits and then you
[2:36:19] see people just fall fall because God
[2:36:21] say that pride you have, that thing you
[2:36:23] say you can't touch and and nobody could
[2:36:25] touch, God himself will bring you down.
[2:36:26] Can the church say
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; amen?
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; And then God goes on in verse 10 of of
[2:36:32] of that same chapter to call out exactly
[2:36:36] and I want to deal with the spirit of
[2:36:37] Esau. Now we not going too much longer.
[2:36:39] Verse 10. For thy violence against thy
[2:36:42] brother Jacob.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; You see how God sees sibling rivalry and
[2:36:46] war between brothers and family. For thy
[2:36:48] violence against thy brother Jacob,
[2:36:51] shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be
[2:36:53] cut off forever. I want to repeat
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; this narrative here.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Listen to verse 11. In the day that thou
[2:37:02] stood us on the other side
[2:37:06] in the day that the strangers carried
[2:37:08] away captive his forces.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; So in other words, while it taken away
[2:37:12] Israel into captivity, he's saying you
[2:37:15] were there and could have done something
[2:37:16] about it.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; But you stood there watching the
[2:37:20] carnage, watching the war. Brother
[2:37:22] George
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; saying you're not getting involved when
[2:37:24] you could have come and help.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; So the spirit of Esau is seeing people
[2:37:29] in trouble and not doing nothing about
[2:37:31] it and saying well I just watch it.
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; And foreigners entered into his gates
[2:37:42] and cast lots upon Jerusalem. Even thou
[2:37:44] was as one of them. So God is saying,
[2:37:46] Edom, not only did you stand aside and
[2:37:49] watch my anointed children get rams
[2:37:52] sacked, but when the ram sacking taking
[2:37:55] place, you was there picking up thing
[2:37:56] too.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; Now bear in mind, every time Israel got
[2:38:02] in trouble, it was God's will
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; to bring them into subjection. But God
[2:38:06] is calling out the spirit that still say
[2:38:08] I are trying to help them and are trying
[2:38:10] to defend them and are trying to because
[2:38:12] there's a level of brotherly love that
[2:38:13] says if somebody in trouble he's
[2:38:14] supposed to help them.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Anybody see this is the Esau spirit.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. But thou shouldest not have
[2:38:25] looked on the day of thy brother in the
[2:38:27] day that he became a stranger.
[2:38:30] Neither should thou have rejoiced over
[2:38:32] the children of Judah in the day of
[2:38:34] their destruction. So in other words,
[2:38:36] God saying, "Here's what not only did
[2:38:38] you not do anything, but when they get
[2:38:39] in trouble, you say it good for them. It
[2:38:41] it I know it is going to happen. I know
[2:38:43] that brother was going to fall."
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; You see, wherever wherever he he he
[2:38:49] reaping his what he had sowed,
[2:38:52] that is the Easter spirit, you know,
[2:38:53] that's in the spirit of love
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible is saying is calling out
[2:38:58] the spirit. So when he say
[2:39:01] that thing happen in this church you
[2:39:03] know
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; spirit
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; this thing know
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; spirit know because the moment we're
[2:39:10] going to talk like that that is not how
[2:39:12] God operates.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; Neither should thou have rejoiced over
[2:39:17] the children of Judah in the day of
[2:39:18] their destruction. Neither should thou
[2:39:21] have spoken proudly in the day of
[2:39:23] distress.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; You see what happened there? That what
[2:39:27] happened here. You see what you see all
[2:39:28] of that kind of thing that comes across
[2:39:30] that way goes Esau spirit
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; and God judged them for speaking that
[2:39:37] way when Jerusalem fell to show that
[2:39:41] these issues wasn't a temporary issue
[2:39:44] throughout multiple scriptures just to
[2:39:46] touch them quickly before we begin to
[2:39:47] wind down to see how God sees this true
[2:39:49] scripture in Isa uh in Isaiah 63 verse1
[2:39:53] who is this that cometh from Edom. So
[2:39:55] even Isaiah pick up this this issue with
[2:39:58] dyed garments from Buzzra
[2:40:00] is that is glorious in his apparel
[2:40:03] traveling in the greatest of his
[2:40:04] strength. I'll skip through some of this
[2:40:06] and Buzzra Edom is all together.
[2:40:08] Jeremiah
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; verse uh chapter 49:1 16 thy
[2:40:12] terribleness had deceived thee and the
[2:40:14] pride of thine heart oh thou that
[2:40:17] dwellest in the cliffs of the rock that
[2:40:18] holdst the height of the hill. Though
[2:40:20] thou shouldest make thy nest as high as
[2:40:22] the eagle, I will bring thee down from
[2:40:25] then, sayeth the Lord.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Also Edom shall be a desolation.
[2:40:30] Everyone that goeth by it shall be
[2:40:32] astonished and shall hiss at the plagues
[2:40:33] thereof.
[2:40:35] In Ezekiel verse uh chapter uh 25:12,
[2:40:39] thus sayeth the Lord God, because that
[2:40:41] Edom had dealt against the house of
[2:40:43] Judah by taking vengeance, and had
[2:40:46] greatly offended and revenged himself
[2:40:49] upon them.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; Therefore say the Lord God, I will also
[2:40:54] stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will
[2:40:56] cut off man and beast from it, and I
[2:40:59] will make it desolate from Taman, and
[2:41:01] they of shall fall by the sword. Amen.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; Just a few more and we're done. Ezekiel
[2:41:07] 35. Ezekiel 35:2.
[2:41:12] Son of man, set thy face against Mount
[2:41:14] Syra and prophesy against it. So you
[2:41:16] see, God is not letting this issue rest.
[2:41:18] Because it's something that he sees from
[2:41:20] Genesis all the way through scripture,
[2:41:22] and say unto it, thus say the Lord God,
[2:41:25] behold, oh mount Sir, I am against thee,
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; and I will stretch out my hand against
[2:41:30] thee, and I will make thee most
[2:41:31] desolate. I will lay thy cities waste,
[2:41:35] and thou shalt be desolate. Thou shalt
[2:41:37] know that I am the Lord, because thou
[2:41:39] has had a perpetual hatred, and has shed
[2:41:43] the blood of the children of Israel by
[2:41:45] the force of the sword in their time of
[2:41:48] their calabity, in the time that the
[2:41:50] iniquity had an end.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Malachi, last one of this.
[2:42:01] Yes. Yes.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; We know Malachi 4:5 and 6. But Malachi's
[2:42:06] ministry started dealing with Esau.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; Malachi 1:2, I have loved thee, sayeth
[2:42:12] the Lord. Yet you say, wherein hast thou
[2:42:14] loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother?
[2:42:16] Sayeth the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob. And
[2:42:19] I hated Esau and laid his mountains and
[2:42:22] his heritage waste for the dragons of
[2:42:24] the wilderness. Whereas, listen to the
[2:42:27] pro listen to Malachi's words. Edom
[2:42:29] said, "We are impoverished. We will
[2:42:32] return and build the desolate places." I
[2:42:34] want us to catch this. So Edom saying,
[2:42:36] "We in trouble and we will rebuild."
[2:42:38] Thus say the Lord of hosts, "They shall
[2:42:41] build, but I will throw down."
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; So God is saying, if the spirit of Esau
[2:42:48] is operating, every time he try to build
[2:42:50] back, he going to break it down again.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; You build, he break it down. You try to
[2:42:55] do it again, he will break it down. And
[2:42:56] you want to ask why is the people can't
[2:42:58] see the way?
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; Because if the spirit of Esau either
[2:43:02] Mount Se Idomia is operating and God
[2:43:05] sees it there no matter what you try to
[2:43:07] build God will break it back down again
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; because he set his face his heart his
[2:43:11] agenda against Esau against Edom against
[2:43:14] Mount B against Edomia. Can the church
[2:43:16] say amen?
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; We are in poverty but we will return and
[2:43:19] build the desolate place. Thus say the
[2:43:21] Lord of hosts. They shall be but I will
[2:43:22] throw it down and they shall call them
[2:43:25] the border of wickedness and the people
[2:43:27] against whom the Lord hath indignation
[2:43:30] forever.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; And of course we brought it now into the
[2:43:35] New Testament with the scripture we read
[2:43:37] in Romans
[2:43:39] and begin to wind out the musician can
[2:43:41] begin to get ready. Hebrews 12:15,
[2:43:44] "Looking diligently, lest any man fall
[2:43:46] of the grace of God, lest any root of
[2:43:48] bitterness spring up trouble you, and
[2:43:50] thereby make and that thereby many be
[2:43:53] defiled, lest there be any fornicator or
[2:43:55] profane person as Esau, who for one
[2:43:58] moral of meat sold his birthight. For we
[2:44:01] know that afterward, when he would have
[2:44:03] inherited the blessing, he was rejected,
[2:44:06] for he found no place of repentance,
[2:44:08] though he sought it carefully with
[2:44:10] tears." It's a warning to the believers
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; because he had just gone too far. And
[2:44:17] for us who are in the message, the
[2:44:18] virtue of this age is brotherly kindness
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; is the blood of this age.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; I ask a question of you this morning.
[2:44:25] What if Esau had just forgiven Jacob.
[2:44:31] How different the story would have been
[2:44:35] because Esau in his heart created an
[2:44:38] ought against Jacob that became a
[2:44:41] perpetual hatred.
[2:44:44] The ought that we thought was dropped
[2:44:46] when they met and they wept and they
[2:44:47] greeted wasn't really dropped. It was
[2:44:50] renewed annually, renewed from
[2:44:52] generation to generation. And God saw
[2:44:54] that ought never die and he saw the
[2:44:56] hatred there. What happens if you drop
[2:44:59] your oughts today?
[2:45:01] The Bible says that when you come to
[2:45:03] bring an offering to the Lord, if you
[2:45:04] have ought against your brother or
[2:45:05] sister, go make it right first before
[2:45:07] you even present your offering.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; We are being challenged here because if
[2:45:14] Esau had just done that one thing, what
[2:45:16] we would have talked about this morning
[2:45:18] may have been a very different story.
[2:45:20] But Esau held that in his heart and a
[2:45:22] root of bitterness was in his heart.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; Is there a root of bitterness in your
[2:45:27] heart this morning?
[2:45:29] Because if there is, you have to drop
[2:45:31] it. This is not just for those in church
[2:45:33] or your family. It's to everyone because
[2:45:35] brother Brandham said, "One ought puts
[2:45:37] you in danger of hellfire."
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; One ought will prevent you from going to
[2:45:42] perfect love.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; So the message this morning, the true
[2:45:45] mystery of Esau is the fact that he held
[2:45:47] a passed on from generation to
[2:45:50] generation to generation. I want to
[2:45:52] encourage you church this morning, drop
[2:45:55] it. Amen.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; If you have a against your husband, drop
[2:45:58] it.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; You have a against your wife, drop it.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; You have a against your son, your
[2:46:03] neighbor, your school friend, I don't
[2:46:05] care who it is. I don't care who wrong
[2:46:06] you. There's no reason for you to hold
[2:46:08] her out this morning.
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they did to you. Esau
[2:46:12] felt violated. He say, "Jacob robbed me.
[2:46:15] He took away what was mine."
[2:46:18] But he also had a choice.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; In the midst of it, they say, "I forgive
[2:46:21] you.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; I forgive you.
[2:46:24] I forgive you.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; And we are being challenged this morning
[2:46:28] to drop it
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; to forgive your brother, to forgive your
[2:46:31] sister. And I said in a service last
[2:46:33] week, some of us we even need to forgive
[2:46:35] ourselves
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; because God could forgive you and you
[2:46:38] could hold it against yourself. God
[2:46:42] don't even bring it up, but you there
[2:46:43] keeping yourself in your own prison,
[2:46:45] your prison of your own past because you
[2:46:46] haven't forgiven yourself. Some of us,
[2:46:49] the freedom we're looking for is freedom
[2:46:51] from our own selves. We could forgive
[2:46:54] others, but we still holding ourselves
[2:46:55] and in our own grip.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; You could begin to play something
[2:47:00] softly.
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; But today is a day of forgiveness. Today
[2:47:04] is a day of restoration.
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; Today is a day of reversing the effects
[2:47:11] of forgiveness, lack of forgiveness, and
[2:47:14] most importantly, giving up your
[2:47:15] birthight. There are many here this
[2:47:17] morning on this blessed Sunday morning.
[2:47:21] You've come to the house of God. I
[2:47:22] believe looking for a brand new touch,
[2:47:24] looking to see something different in
[2:47:26] your own life. I want to encourage shift
[2:47:28] your value equation. Don't value the
[2:47:31] things of the world because that will
[2:47:33] fade. Don't value what is temporary.
[2:47:36] What is eternal? Is is your heart right
[2:47:38] with God?
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; Is there any ought any enmity, any
[2:47:41] desire that should not be there? Have
[2:47:43] you been valuing the wrong thing or
[2:47:45] holding and grudges in the wrong way?
[2:47:47] May today be a day that you are released
[2:47:48] and you release others. Even the Lord's
[2:47:51] prayer said, "Forgive us as we forgive
[2:47:54] those who trespass against us." Every
[2:47:57] single person in this room has somebody
[2:47:58] who has done something to us.
[2:48:01] And many of us sometime we say we
[2:48:03] forgive and we let it go. And then
[2:48:04] something happened and it triggers back
[2:48:06] memories, feeling we realize the thing
[2:48:07] we thought we let go is already not let
[2:48:09] go. You know because something comes up
[2:48:11] and brings it up again. Have you really
[2:48:13] forgiven?
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; Have you really dropped out? Have you
[2:48:17] really let it go and say it's not
[2:48:20] affecting me anymore?
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; If that is not your position, there are
[2:48:24] children who need to forgive parents.
[2:48:26] There are parents who need to forgive
[2:48:27] children.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:34] [Music]
[2:48:44] I want you to take a few minutes and
[2:48:46] search your heart.
[2:48:47] [Music]
[2:48:49] The Holy Spirit is here.
[2:48:53] God loves you. He wants all of you, not
[2:48:55] part of you.
[2:49:00] [Music]
[2:49:05] If you came in here this morning and you
[2:49:06] know you've not been living right, this
[2:49:08] is this is your day. I challenge you to
[2:49:10] not leave here the same way that you
[2:49:12] came,
[2:49:14] I challenge you to let everything go
[2:49:16] because we we have some hard cases to
[2:49:19] pray for this morning. And before we
[2:49:21] pray for the hard cases, before we pray
[2:49:23] for the children, before we go into all
[2:49:25] these things, is your heart right with
[2:49:28] God this morning? Do you really want to
[2:49:30] serve God?
[2:49:33] Do you really see the value of the
[2:49:34] birthright? Do you see the value of the
[2:49:36] Holy Ghost and say, "Lord, I want the
[2:49:38] Holy Ghost. I'm not leaving here." The
[2:49:40] prophet give a testimony say, "Lord, I'm
[2:49:42] not leaving here until I get it. I don't
[2:49:45] want to go home the same way I came. I'm
[2:49:47] tired of just living. I want a reality.
[2:49:49] I want a fresh experience. I want to
[2:49:52] experience what it is to have no ought,
[2:49:53] no grudges. Just to be free, to serve,
[2:49:55] to worship, to pray, to praise, to get
[2:49:58] to fall in love with Jesus all over
[2:50:00] again. He said, "Take me back to my
[2:50:02] first love." Is there anybody wants to
[2:50:04] go back to your first love?
[2:50:07] Many hands all over the building.
[2:50:10] Oh yes, yes, yes. Talk to him right now.
[2:50:13] If you need forgiveness, say, "Lord,
[2:50:15] forgive me." You need restoration, Lord,
[2:50:17] restore me. You need deliverance, Lord,
[2:50:19] deliver me. Pass me not, oh gentle
[2:50:22] savior.
[2:50:24] Oh, hallelujah. You can begin to sing
[2:50:26] softly.
[2:50:31] [Music]
[2:50:35] I want to worship
[2:50:40] you.
[2:50:44] Hallelujah.
[2:50:45] [Music]
[2:50:55] You can go free this morning if you want
[2:50:56] to go free
[2:51:00] because
[2:51:02] [Music]
[2:51:08] my heart
[2:51:12] Lord take the pride out of my heart.
[2:51:16] Take the pride out of my heart. Jesus.
[2:51:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to be humble. I want to be
[2:51:20] whole. I don't want to take this for
[2:51:22] granted. There's not much time left. But
[2:51:25] Lord, while there's time, Lord, I want
[2:51:27] to make things right.
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go home the same way I
[2:51:31] came. I don't want to take chances.
[2:51:34] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody this morning?
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can make your altar where you
[2:51:44] at? Lord, I rededicate my life to you.
[2:51:48] Lord, I've not been serving you as I
[2:51:49] should, but from this day on, Lord, I
[2:51:52] want to be a true Christian.
[2:51:54] Lord, I rededicate my life to you. Lord,
[2:51:57] take away the root of bitterness,
[2:52:00] Lord. You have held the root of
[2:52:02] bitterness for long enough.
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; Forgive this morning. Forgive. Forgive
[2:52:07] yourself. Forgive your brother. Forgive
[2:52:09] your family. Forgive anyone whoever
[2:52:11] around you. Forgive this morning.

[2:52:15] Drop it this morning. Drop it this
[2:52:17] morning. Yes. When you drop it, you can
[2:52:20] go free. When you forgive, you can go
[2:52:22] free. Drop it. I don't care who did it.
[2:52:24] I don't care what it was. Drop it this
[2:52:26] morning. And watch the Lord work on your
[2:52:29] soul. Come on, you are free. Forgive.
[2:52:32] Forgive. And watch God forgive you.
[2:52:34] Forgive your brother. Forgive your
[2:52:36] sister. Forgive your children. Forgive
[2:52:38] your boss. Forgive your neighbor.
[2:52:41] [Music]
[2:52:44] Don't let anything hinder you.
[2:52:46] Hallelujah.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; All over the buildings.
[2:52:50] &gt;&gt; Get your heart pure.
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; Get your heart pure. Surrender.
[2:52:54] Surrender. Give up this morning. Give up
[2:52:56] this morning.
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; God will judge. God will deal with his
[2:53:01] situations. You don't have to fix it.
[2:53:04] Let him fix it.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not for you to fix. Let
[2:53:08] him fix it this morning.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:53:14] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe you made mistakes.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe you think that that you that that
[2:53:22] there's no hope for you. God has
[2:53:24] forgiven you. Forgive yourself this
[2:53:26] morning and say, "Lord,
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm coming home. Lord, I'm coming
[2:53:30] home. Lord, I'm coming home. Restore
[2:53:33] unto me the joy of my salvation."
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:53:45] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory,
[2:53:47] glory.
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes.
[2:53:53] &gt;&gt; Talk to the Lord.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; Why are you doing this, preacher? We
[2:53:57] want to get the atmosphere right
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; because we have some hard cases to pray
[2:54:01] for. We don't want anything holding it
[2:54:04] back. God is able this morning to take
[2:54:06] away the root of bitterness.
[2:54:09] Your yesterday, you can't change it, but
[2:54:11] from today, drop it. Drop it. Drop it.
[2:54:13] Hallelujah. God wants to forgive you. He
[2:54:16] has forgiven you, but you got to drop
[2:54:17] what's in your heart.
