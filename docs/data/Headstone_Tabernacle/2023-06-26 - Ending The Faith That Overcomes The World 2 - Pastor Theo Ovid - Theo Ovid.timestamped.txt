[40:35] want to really encourage you as we enter
[40:36] into this month of July and the
[40:39] convention month
[40:40] that he continued to be in prayer and
[40:42] Consecration and it's a big sacrifice
[40:45] you know I was just talking about a
[40:47] little bit before coming out here that
[40:49] you know for somebody to come to the
[40:51] convention from overseas from certain
[40:53] countries it takes sometimes two to
[40:55] three days to make it to this convention
[40:57] two to three days to go back home it
[41:00] takes around maybe around twenty
[41:02] thousand dollars per person for those
[41:04] who are coming to the convention on
[41:05] average to make it to this meeting you
[41:07] know so I want to really encourage you
[41:09] who are here who could drive up your
[41:11] road or travel up the service you know
[41:13] or to to really take this opportunity
[41:16] seriously we didn't have physical
[41:18] conventions for a few years because of
[41:20] the pandemic and we don't know if this
[41:22] will be our last convention so I really
[41:24] want to challenge you to give this your
[41:27] everything we have seven services
[41:30] that will be for the convention for the
[41:33] 14th the 15th and the 16th of July there
[41:36] will be two services on the Friday three
[41:39] on Saturday and two on Sunday and by the
[41:42] grace of God we have ministers coming
[41:45] who will be ministering uh to be a great
[41:48] blessing to the bride here in Trinidad
[41:51] and Tobago and around the world as well

[41:55] be under preparation for that and for
[41:58] the remainder of the services before the
[42:01] convention we are in convention
[42:02] preparation mode so I want to challenge

[42:16] don't know if this convention will
[42:17] trigger Dynamics everything that we've
[42:19] been looking for can the church say Amen
[42:20] so let us be under critics be so easy it
[42:23] was for the Holy Spirit to just move
[42:24] into the church oh you imagine from the
[42:27] face of his brother Anthony the Jose
[42:29] moves in service after service if we
[42:32] didn't even finish the convention

[44:45] Lord and more and more friends musician
[44:48] good players but Anthony gets ready I'm
[44:50] realizing that this this journey this
[44:52] walk is really a daily walk
[44:56] you know many times you look and you see
[44:58] things around you and you realize that
[45:00] the people who are successful in the
[45:02] spiritual and the natural and the more
[45:03] you go back to the scripture you see
[45:05] this meditate on the word day and night
[45:09] your life is a product of what you do
[45:11] every single day
[45:13] your habits your thoughts your decisions
[45:17] every single day it compounds
[45:22] progress
[45:24] process is a day by day thing
[45:27] it cannot just be on a Sunday you're
[45:30] spending time with your lord and then
[45:32] maybe you catch piece of a Wednesday and
[45:34] then maybe no it's a day by day
[45:36] discipline
[45:39] you breathe every day you're supposed to
[45:40] drink water every day it's supposed to
[45:42] eat something every day and the more you
[45:44] realize that your prayer life has to be
[45:46] a daily thing
[45:48] reading the word has to be a daily thing
[45:51] and when you make it a part of your
[45:53] daily walk you find so much stuff that
[45:55] bothered you stop bothering you
[45:58] because you're plugged into a source
[46:01] can the Child Say Amen someone encourage
[46:03] you as we become more mature in the
[46:06] world and more mature in this thing that
[46:07] you practice on a daily basis I have to
[46:10] pray today
[46:11] the deer cannot finish without me
[46:13] praying the day cannot finish without me
[46:14] reading the Scripture it is I'm not
[46:17] becoming unacceptable for you to have a
[46:19] day without praying
[46:21] it should become
[46:23] unacceptable to have a deal without
[46:25] reading the scripture
