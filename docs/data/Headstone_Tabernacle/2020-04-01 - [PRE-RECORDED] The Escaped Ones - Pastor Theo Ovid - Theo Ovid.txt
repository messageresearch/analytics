verse 24 to 27 and second Peter 1 wanna read verse 1 to 10 Ezekiel chapter 24 verse 24 thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he had done shall he do when this commit he shall know that I am the Lord God also know son of man shall it not been the day when I take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of the eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and the daughters that he that escaped it in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears in that day shall die might be open to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be a sign unto them and they shall know that I am the Lord 2nd Peter 1 we have a voice 1 Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that are obtained like precious feet with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you to the knowledge of God and our Jesus our Lord according as his divine power had given to us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that call us to glory and virtue whereby I give unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by deeds he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence up to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and if these things be in you and abound they shall make you that ye shall neither be barren unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he had luck at these things is blind currency a fowls had forgotten that he was pushing his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make a call and election sure so if we do these things he shall never fall may God bless his word you may be seated our title tonight the escape once lets that have that the escape once the escape once and you know America started off as a lamb and the Bible speaks that he would speak like a dragon and what we have seen unfold in the inform if we are not writing for the eyes is the dismantling of democracy that's what you see in the dismantling of democracy it has to happen because the lamb have to speak like a dragon and things have to happen to turn a lamb in the dragon and the Prophet said they were raised up of pharaoh that knew not Joseph and Joseph represent freedom of religion see so therefore it will be a force system and take away the freedom from the people freedom of religion and I want to just go back to Revelation chapter 13 and read something from the earth to history said I saw one of his heads talking about the beasts it was wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they will ship the Dragon which gave power unto the beasts so the beasts have to be empowered let's continue that's coming and they worshipped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to walk with Him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he open his mouth in blasphemy against God the blasphemous name his tabernacle and them that will have and was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given unto him over all Kindred's and tongues and nations this is not skim milk this is the word we're eating you know and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world not some all therefore all those who will escape that's you know the bride gonna be the ones that gonna be not gonna escape on everybody else going to worship the beasts and the B system watch if any man an a let him here he doesn't leave it leave it leave it on to captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints and I beheld another beast coming out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb and he speaks as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and constantly earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed we should know as pig on Rome to enter Papa room let's continue and he do a great wonders so he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast seen unto them the pollinator that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live hallelujah made what image unto the Beast and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast so the image to our power in itself the image has to be given power hallelujah hallelujah and he had power to give life under the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here his wisdom let him that had understanding Kong the number of the beast for it is a number of a man is not been six hundred threescore and six 666 it's not something tonight all glory to God to the Bible identify the image on to the beasts or praise God you know and the thing of it is in the beginning in Genesis God said let us make man in our image and likeness hallelujah and God put an image with first created image isn't that right wasn't flesh man yet and God put this flesh man in the body isn't that right that man couldn't feel that man could not fall that was the original man isn't that right and got completed creation with a man that was in power a man that was in dominion because the man himself as a son had a reflect God and to reflect God you have to reference his attributes so he say let us make man let her have dominion over over over over everything that creepeth upon the earth so man wasn't was supposed to be a conqueror overcomer a Dominator is that right hallelujah man was supposed to be in control of in charge of ruling over that was man and God's original intent but through a by-product because Eve was a by-product of the man hallelujah she was that in the original she pulled out of e of man and that became the woman is that right Satan didn't approach the man he approached a woman we know the story and man fell but God promised to restore brains got your gets caught in that God promised to restore because court had a plan the ring right man right back [Applause] and I've got news for you tonight you live in in the verge of the manifestation of the fulfillment of the plan that God had since man fell God always was going to bring back man back to his original condition back to his first created image so just as a piece of an image we have an image that images faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity is men right and the mystery of God come down from God as the word of God and the world is being preached and the world come as a seed and that image coming to you in seed form by the word of promises and Peter said by these promises not by these explanation by these promises you have become a partaker of his divine nature but power show total power power after commentator image and we are promised dynamics we are promised charity we are promised the price absolute isn't that right power down Oh hallelujah hallelujah two images going to be empowered you may be seated praise God the ears of the beasts this is the image of God is not something let's continue know anyone who can explain anything you don't have to accept it any more by feet if these things that we cannot explain that we have to accept my feet we cannot explain God no man can explain God he is sovereign he is great and mighty we just accept it because we know he is there and then I our faith and accepting it he brings the response back to us the baptism of the Holy Spirit so the baptism the Holy Spirit comes in response to your acceptance by hate parties and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness because in this last is it wouldn't be two churches or two groups there'll be two max holiday I get the Mac of God or look at the mark of the beast let me see it good tonight there were just two max is got six is the twenty it's just blue or chlorine of God and you come to church tonight to get mocked by God because in Ezekiel 9 Oh glory of God the slaughtering angels wants them to tell ugly young and old male female little children but come not near any man let that man and caution a prophet to bring a revelation of the mask of God or the seal of God every mystery is to bring a seal in your life there's only seven seals or to the Lord a shout Oh glory to God you'll be sealed hallelujah like a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost go either God they be seated but a brand I'm damned brother and sister if you haven't got the popular Holy Ghost this morning we run into the kingdom of God us because you can the ceilin time is on when they have any cover like a flood his reason a standard against said he prophesied that there will come a sealing time when the church will be sealed I mean uniting time ensign he said I believe the writers chord I believe she is sealed into the kingdom of God and when God put you in the kingdom no man could take you out no trial no testing norge emulation nothing present nothing to come bring you my call you are blessed tonight to be one of the escape once or glowing of God you escape hallelujah you escaped the piece gasket force anointed the escape room let's get the Pope you escaped the systems well glory to God do I escape once are you gonna ask him the corruption that is in the world she lost or did the Lord a shout in the house glory hallelujah listen you had just come to the message you know you escaped you escaped you didn't know myself friend you know myself family you escaped the boss who receive you escape the prime ministers who receive your swap the bishop the Pope yes give all of them and you are yet because you're seeing name on that book or glow that's why you could rejoice and shout and have nothing to do with what condition it was in hold back Satan what's in your come true that have nothing to do with it all that barrier shall worship the Beast if they're not worshiping the Beast have to be worshiping God you may be seated [Applause] [Music] the Holy Spirit always speaks the world I've got meetings that tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he will guide you to it so after the prophet was taken off the scene God released the Spirit of Truth two spirits was unfold on the earth the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error but the Spirit of Truth was sent to guidance to the truth so listen this part now that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time in other words you're supposed to be on top a brotherly kindness like that time you're supposed to have it based on forgiveness by that time by that time they oughta be lords no grudge no jealousy no malice no foolishness by that time it's just a fail to pull down the cap or blow it up God give the Lord a shout listen to this listen listen a the stone that Daniel saw no money cut that out no - cut that so now that's only coming they're coming up the headstone ready or not it's coming or glory no God you better get ready bride Oh hallelujah I'm a sinner again the finishing of this seventh seal not the beginning this is 54 years since the prophet left this is commonality and known we finish it we're supposed to be up here this pyramid is the Bible the zodiac is the Bible and we have a Bible a written Bible all three is the Bible your car preaches aurilla you can preach the word and when the world coming to you is a pyramid so that's why when the rapture come and the magnet come it only can magnetize and pull up those that have that in them because that have the magnetism of the Holy Ghost Jesus listen Jesus could see destroyed his body in three days I will raise it up because jesus knew the cripton power was resident in him all glory to God hallelujah praise God that light was already in hell he is there oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah conditions kind of holier you are higher than that the Bible the Bible call it listen the glorious liberty of the sons of God that's not you think you're free you know that's not you think you're free you know that is free on the inside free free the glorious Liberty the whole creation said come on you can make it come on come on come on you sons you can make it we waitin on you we waitin for our masters we've met since our rulers may be seated let's continue watch he set the seed of God the Word of God Jesus said in a certain place the wood is a seed and every seed will bring water after his came now if the Christian the children of God the churn of the kingdom has to become the seed of God then there must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the East at the Lebanon you shall replace it that these children is the seed then there must be the word with manifested don't get tired not talking with no word manifested Oh hallelujah so when is it a cheer another seed in the turnout a word with manifested so what I want a life from you don't elect a panda when you speak the devil must hear hell must know our son and a daughter is walking the street do you believe that these are not to join continue no this is coming for sonship coming in the god ship coming into inheritance coming to know who you are and what God brings you up for let me season okay we are fostered children with your husband wife children family whatnot and fuss it's not really fast you know it's pretty son them if God give you the power and you're walking with the anointing back this will offer them to get free era because they don't even know what turn them in oh now you watch in flesh and blood they act answered and sabacc the road at this but you see me spirit behind that but if you get a spread offer that if the child nice decide normally shyly born to me like they want everyone to look like that but something moving upon that child that's why the professor when the charge of the ears of accountability the devil has come and the Holy Ghost has come and what every child means two years true that is what overtakes the channel then you have trouble in schools then after I get it bandits and robbers and anything else a spirit animal a spirit - spirit bondage we all know internalizing an alternative employment across the spirit and the prophecy a spirit after come from the brain [Music] it wasn't Sampson muscles is what the spirit upon Sampson it was the spirit upon David it was a spirit upon the brothers it's love you it's not gonna be you is the spirit coming upon you jesus said the Spirit is upon me because he has anointed me Oh glory no God or give the Lord a shout you could be anointed and get your dealing tonight get your sealing tonight get your deliverance tonight you can leave your completely change and transform tonight [Applause] do I hear shout in the house all glory to God hallelujah do maybe season that is why the devil fight worship fight the atmosphere fight your worship and a prisoner like like nobody by best in the last day we'll have people with itching ears you know what I want teachers not preachers on don't want teachers people have to stimulate the gray matter stimulate the head but that calf I'd you Devlin on you can explain this because there's some fellas intellectual thought they could get a gift and the power and say come on every name of Jesus Paul preaches come on Daryl name of Jesus and the impersonation talk to the man is they Paul I know Peter I know that talk I don't know you know have what you're talking about and he straight jump on them and all I'm getting trouble but when Paul come walking them devil's going left right this is a for them that was moving away why because a man of God is talk become a son of God especially earth somebody you know where they come from know where they're going how much time they'd ever back up in your own home back up in your whole house and your own environment you don't even know what to do but there's a mind of Christ every situation there's an intelligence behind everything if we could tap into the intelligence its mover or give the Lord a show praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God every situation in your life and I wrong you there's a intelligence behind it nothing is by chance hallelujah glory to God when Esther was in the king and she didn't know where she was at him and who she be a belongs they had to tell her but do you know that you were dear for such a time as this do you think you will escape because you only palace you don't know you will get a lake up to you and you get astray - you have to do something then SSA if I perish I perish she come to a point that desperation she comes a point where she didn't care no more she said I'm going to the prison of the King you're not supposed to go unless you are called did you hear that you're not supposed to go until you a call but this woman she saw the need she saw Deora she saw what was going to happen if she didn't make a move and if you don't make a move Norman or normal but there's a rupture glory of God there is a wedding supper I don't want to miss it this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's going in a rapture not this being when we talk about get that is not something on a backbone to stand up blackboard and say faith and virtual knowledge and circle be the one food that has to be a living [Applause] maybe season I want to see if God could bring it I'm inspired real to you those virtues have to come alive it has to be living and the only way if you're not alive is when it's tested and I know you might wanna say Amen because I said tested because people have a problem with using certain words but I will say that II how the only way I can know that alive is when is tested the only way I can know yet brotherly kindness is when somebody really do you in and you have no you have to forgive them and there are situations where you are right and they are wrong and you forgiving them you've given up your rights to be right and letting it go even if you are right and let us kill you because you know you're right but you're taking wrong or give the Lord a show hallelujah praise God you're pressing for peace because you want to keep the atmosphere right never want to shake you on the atmosphere oh my Oh glory to God when the Prophet was behind the pulpit you may be seated and that maniac man come compete in the preachers he thought it was another one of them what he come up with he said you snake in the grass he said yeah you know your hypocrite I could beat you I know why I checked in the Prophet mat nice words you know it's not just what he speak and spirit if you only like that see the inside are you afraid that you run to 400 men how much many other prophet role on the platform and they leave he alone 5 foot short man standing there and the Prophet just under the anointing he keeping the atmosphere yeah breaking at the devil and that man talk and his talk he said because you have challenged the Spirit of God you will fall over my feet you will fall over my feet so you had a come-come on the platform somebody said call the police you said no to call the police they'd enough flesh and blood I fail no blue blue lights and in December this thing hallelujah drop blue blue uniform coming to interfere with this thing visit their welcoming center here and this is caught on top I hear this is God versus the devil or glory naquadah the Devlin that man is God in me develop on that man is caught up on me oh he shall fall on my feet the man come on a platform spinning around come on I'm fittin to and fall right over the prophets feet or glory to God you can defeat the Spirit of God show me once wherever the spirit already fitted in Genesis darkness cover it and God said let there be light under Spirit of God began to move upon the water and in every confusion and every darkness and every chaos wants to spirit begin to move what we need is the spirit to begin to move you can't explain that you can't don't talk that Hollow you can't teach that that is something to be manifested or give the Lord a shout the one teachers having itching ears they are he enough still want to hear more Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God even know if the churn is the Train of God is churning of the kingdom I become the seat of God there must be the Word of God the Word of God manifested in the age that they living in for the promises of that age that is why I watch watch we have lived two looters age Wesley age Pentecostal age and the Pentecostal age each age is given a promise of the world and the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age I'm gonna do holy past this the people that manifests the promise of that age so God put brotherly kindness on top and on top of that have the holy spirit because the ki aapke come down on top of Oerlikon is that they be called out so the called out is the escaped one be called out as those who escape loud Isha which is heady highminded lukewarm God spew them out amount amidst church members that is not wise version those foolish virgins be called out as who see the oil who see the holy spirits flood that is DEA after get into so that is what he said does if that be so then the seven thunders CAPTA bernal then he was not designed earth under strangers in that way he was showing the thunders in the Holy Spirit slot to cap your pyramid the pyramid of your life or glory of God therefore the seven thunders julie's in two parts mechanics and dynamics hallelujah literally turn the hospital cheering back to the face as far as these mysteries that's that's a mechanic part but the dynamic part what really should make a church that will make a revival that people would find them everywhere saying them seven thunders is being manifested the devil I see nothing here all he's in his church and groups and pulpit and nice talk and nice messages and nice titles the devil s see nothing yet or give the Lord a shout when the way knee up Aroon they were shouting and dancing up a room that can move shape hug but when Peter says vandal halenann such as I have I give it unto you general close up he took North Iraq orders ever gotta take the north and no message he's not impressed [Music] but hungrily Ravello deep breaths we have nice messages nice sermon and Lucy Lucy nothing Reds not impressed when this become manifest oh ho yeah he said no no no no this can't work this just our work but it going to work because God promised to release the sons of God when born sons filled sons speak and their word is backed up there will begin to materialize or glory to God using all these years the training was just to be talking talking yapping yapping yapping no the Ravan said the Lord Himself whenever you ever they're confirming the word with signs following do you know the glory of God at the fill this tabernacle do you know that you added tabernacle do you know if you have to be filled with the glory of God do you know when Solomon had everything in place and shall begin to pray the glory of God filled the tabernacle that the minister couldn't even stand the minister do you know man what is finished with you word on top a word on top of oil and Tupperware and that glory coming upon you it will fill your tabernacle you shall be filled that is your promise or get a lot some praise and worship hallelujah hallelujah glory to God what's this what's this year and the people of a rage that manifests that promise word is the seed of that age when the Jesus idea they are the children of the kingdom not any message nabiyev a prophet not that this is children of the kingdom the manifestation did he didn't know this if I like the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is the seed of the kingdom at that age so boy they will rests until the Holy Spirit began to operate in you in me until the coming to your position until the getti inheritance he gives some apostles he gives some pastors he gives some teachers he kept some Vangelis he gives some profits isn't that right and after that he gives gifts of poems interpretation of tongues prophecy gift of healing give of wisdom give of knowledge different reputation every gift have to be underfloor every difference needed God only God only allah mode what a nice true what happens to God a football or get the Lord and show your body is not just a mo pot or get a lot of show what do you say my love it I'm seen every member it's just as important as the preacher I know I know I know the preachers might talk that I'm preacher but I say to you every member is just as important as the man behind the pulpit because everybody will be baptized into the body there are outward pass a body and they're inside matter your body you like your hand you're like a head like it is take what you have to see well let somebody come and take off your two kidneys and see what happened to your body your nice body it'll pass you can see but they are necessary in a classic you'll see but they are needed and I'll pass working behind the scenes you can see but you need to have them because all of them is what make up this glorious body that you have they will give the Lord a shout there is one Lord there is one set there is one body there is one baptism not to hit one hit and he fell a prophet to turn our hearts back to defeat okay the Lord a shout I know what this bunch of group sing but I know about the faith once delivered to the Saints are we going back to that or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I read it for you sometime back about Ezekiel he took Ezekiel to the valley of dry bones he's Academies won't live talk to me talk to me back easy go talk to me Ezekiel sit down yes he said prophesy the bones tell the bones they will live I will call Brett to coming to you it's all in the endgame the end product the finished work that life will come back into that but before the bones to the to the breath there's something done for Boone have to come to Boone flesh

us unto inheritance what if I am if I'm a right inheritance of something if God is knocking at my heart and said see William Branham I called you a long time before the foreign world to preach a gospel I have an inheritance of eternal life God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me we ourselves had inheritances we were sinners we had returns all of a sudden we find out we have a deed we have a book of a seal oh good and somebody say your name and they know let me see the Missy when he said of pearl receives off you see it's me I'm what my name connected with inheritance what what my father lives on it oh you mean me a house land a boat to leave this city oh yes I want it it didn't say you deserve it you want it because you leave it for you I thought I'm a I thought I taught you bustin refer ready already this is not I'm so unworthy look call me that talk there's not your moody business I'm I said oh God they done that this is inheritance left [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and remember that guy who the kind of comedian guy chemical guy he said um he was checking his how much boots how much square because it would have and he recognized that if you measure it everybody T equals something so and he asked what for et IGAs and then he said Lord has some friends in prison didn't come earlier could I get this to an e end up getting about a hundred acres and he's like he you know I mean but I'm saying I Hannah a childlike kind of it he said if you don't want what God promised it has somebody else who will take it no more my Nana he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as receive and that's you like me to them he release power for what to become but what to be transformed but what to add okay the Lord I sell is that instant thing is something I take from one phase to another phase one step to another step you see we all want to get there right away but God half steps sheltered steps right order my steps oh god go half steps and he make her go to these steps and test every step that you're qualified to go to the next step or glory the quarries are trying to pressurize you he's trying to qualify you to go to the next level you know like I don't believe in a video game the game business well to go to next level you're the pacifism level if you do pass a level you never in a memory code there are people on keep on keep on keep on [Music] and I connect LeBron to room next level next level but I will go to have here in every age God love having levels hallelu until the final age all them Tunde that we'd ever get in each each God gather them together and this is and dropping it on the bride to give him all seven every age he was getting them one by one by one go say get it all I drop in some Sunday last days they will get it there were some good thunders know about shake up he'll shaken up listen this place will be so shaken the greens and all go shake open there will be a resurrection because the children are the perfection by manifestation till the Lord I shall all this fivefold ministry for the perfect innocence men flesh man ordinary man human be instinct that they doing that monka perfect man sinful man too perfect man they don't understand is five for ministry as prophesied by the Prophet of William Branham and he's to be fine for ministry is the ministry of Jesus Christ it's not this man ministry and that you have a great ministry while you talk about that that name is Jesus Christ the Messiah so maybe phone all together you have to be given that you have to comment to that but after we put you put that upon you there is that a man trying a king and my church I'm I choose better than anybody else chaired by foolishness like humans business that nothing mister Jesus Christ there was one cap there was one head there was one heavier must recognize the headship of Jesus Christ Oh glory to God I'm not a head of the church he is the head of the body called a church in that body of fivefold ministry in that body of believers with gifts with places in that body but on top that body Christ alone is the head trick of the Lord a shout or do you see well I'm saying in all glory to God so the early part of our ministry he said I said I represent the faith by way of a divine gift it's a powerful statement I represent the faith by way of a divine gift TV didn't come into him yet he had a gift of healing and that was so powerful they taken for Jesus Christ but he at was the growth of first full second poll purple into the ministry Jesus friends where God Himself was filled in him that's why you can say come to the unveiling of the mighty God Oh glory to God and when God was veiling him God spoke himself out on books and tapes in the form of promises hallelujah and we catch the promises or the preacher sketch explanation interpretation or kind of crazy revelation but what we see as promises so when you come to church all you want to hear is what your promise you want to hear what your heritance is you want to hear what your call on truth you want hear what they're here for what you must enjoy what you must clean what you must pull down you know you have a bacchanal and confusion and talking other people business you know here for that I am NOT here for that we have to speak as the Oracles of God Oh glory to God when we speak you have to speak for God to the escaped ones or give the Lord a shout that's the promise you know hallelujah yes prophetic utterance we'll go out to the escaped ones hallelujah you wouldn't want to miss a service because I don't know what God want to say you don't know what call wonders speak because cork honestly by direct inspiration it's not just the course we're quoting here is the Spirit of God coming and speaking to you because once more the world will get direct from God or glory God direct from God God speaking directly to you when you leave here you're no God talk to you or glory they're gonna get that directly from the Lord oh my my my my my hallelujah so but he said I call you a long time ago before the fog in the world and God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do but inherited there's nothing I can do but in the fullness of time God sent his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I'm a Gautam inheritance to be walked whatever it has the sonship to be a son of God not remember that's Courtney a little bit right Moses people children in Israel God's people pillar of fire they come out on its own right so go get them prophets they have the word they have the law from Malachi to Matthew hundreds of years no prophet here comes John the Baptist repent by that time one hundred years fast then fellows are tall hats long gowns nice little and beards nice Tabernacles on temples and so on nice traditions and so on people respect them or whatnot here come a man that Zechariah his name is Johnny yeah how a man with camel skin blastin bring forth fruit meat to repentance and blessing them if our sees new something happening because that behavior is auto-sync but what their custom with they say I you him are you the Messiah should we look for another see me I not me there's one standing among you the whole Harlan who shoes I'm not Buddhist unloose you're gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost somebody fire all glory to God you under know who it is yet she called given my sign upon whom you see the stuff coming and resting on remaining that's a Messiah Jesus he is watching what's happening he had to wait for his time he came out of all a mess I'm Jesus until everybody I'm Jesus he can't introduce himself John have to introduce him and we have to be made for the Messiah so geez had a whiff of John to start to preach and John the time and have to be just right and then all of a sudden Holy Spirit tells Jesus move now he stand in line to be baptizing anybody else I'm John baptized on when you see Jesus he said I said you should baptize me he said that might be so but it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness I'm John baptized he said behold the lamb of God then the elect among John disciples stopped following John and instead the follow Jesus because the neutron was introduced Jesus John Scylla disciples but this guy is following Jesus no because they know the Messiah or glory that God but Jesus fine a lot of priests so qualified fooling them days you who so-called custodians of the wood in those days they have the books that the tips of the scrolls your fallen same with the caretakers they work ethic in the Moodle schools after John got packages that baptized Holy Spirit again not man Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness yeah but Lord is that you I've seen we'll listen front is that you I thought I was going I wouldn't on a platform and people welcomed me I thought I get enough love to shake my hands but is that real yeah that really you the Holy Spirit led him into the wilderness to overcome Lucifer one-on-one private trial to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life to overcome himself a lot of people that they don't have the internal power self discipline self order conquering of self today's by the moat fly loosely get temper they carry on because they don't have the internal stuff so when Jesus had that discipline look at this stone could turn into bread and say it is written it is written is also written he overcame no the spirit come back upon ever so here is a baptized spirit on him when he hit the wilderness spread off of him now yeah the feast just alone no helper fit it is written as written he's doing that for you and me you don't need power to beat that devil you just need to know your word hallelujah it's written it's written but I'm say did that for you he did that for me that you could tell see it and it is written it is written if you do it is written that's why you have to be in the word to know it is written or give the Lord a shout you have to know it is written you have to know it's in the word yeah after study the word so when he come true and he come back over then he speak come back upon him be back before that the power of the Spirit so now you have a super anointing upon him he goes to the temple they say if somebody wanted some want somebody to read just put up his hands I really first time me when I read hallelujah and then he had a finished school of Isaiah Isaiah okay that is closer then he's : don't know and finally and going down to the part where Hema the Spirit of the Lord is upon me so they taught he read in scripture the scripture this is the manifestation right now they thought he just written a text the Totti cotton and cotton he just caught him but his himself is cotton the spirit alone upon me because they learn a meter and when he finished finish me that is it this day the scripture is fulfilled in your air and his laptop close the book dominoes action knows that hallelujah victorious vibrations from heaven Oh glory the but he is nominated define the scripture he is no Commission he is ready to go out and heal the sick and raise the dead and give them Skype and Pharisees and run for the money or give the Lord a shout what you think that brag gonna do and no I didn't Commission fine your scripture Spirit is upon me Oh glory to God hallelujah you are gonna be here you belong to them escape once the escape punch let me see look wrap up here gonna keep you long hallelujah praise God this may choke you to death but they do know that men that are sons of God are mature gods or this is beautiful men that are sons of God are mature gods he didn't say men there are tons of other preachers and teachers and explainers he's showing you that the inheritance is your sonship to be a son of God and the son of God right not Church son citizen pew son of God right Lee is a mature God watch watch how many ever knowed how many know Jesus said so did not they lost it at your gods watch impotence is two because they had full don't mean the mean of the world he couldn't do million of all things he lost his quad ship he lost his sonship he lost his domain Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time and then now he wanted equality side the fullness of time as when the pyramid gets to the top so he showed it can happen before time it has to come at the fullness of time when when the pyramid comes to the top watch watch watch watch when the previous to the top when the full sons of God who will be manifested so this have a Titan in it do I am n this ever time in it when the pyramid gets to the top when the when the full sons of God will be manifested let's picture a little bit full sons when the power of God will walk out evil Alleluia and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him that's right that's why Jesus said usually about wars and rumors of wars and kingdom rise against Kingdom and earthquakes in diverse places he said the end is not yet but then he's qualified with this gospel must be preached not taught this is not taught now this is after all the teachings this gospel must be preached and then shall the end come nobody is committed in us without us preaching the gospel they not end in us we have that we have to close this story or give the Lord a shout let me see it again me have to close the story no manacles in this story the bride the escape ones we have
