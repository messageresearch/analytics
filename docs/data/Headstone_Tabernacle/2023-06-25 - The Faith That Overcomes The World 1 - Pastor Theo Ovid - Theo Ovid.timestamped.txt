[46:12] Mark 11 and Jesus answering said unto
[46:17] them her faith in God
[46:20] for verily I say unto you that whosoever

[46:59] William from verse one no feet
[47:01] it's a substance of things hoped for
[47:04] the evidence of Things Not Seen for by
[47:07] it the elders obtain a good report
[47:09] true faith we understand that the
[47:11] world's refrained by the word of God so
[47:13] that things which are seen were not made
[47:15] of things were to appear
[47:16] by Fate Abel offered unto God a more
[47:19] excellent sacrifice than Cain
[47:21] by which he obtained witness that he was
[47:22] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[47:25] and buy it he being dead yet speak it by
[47:28] faith Enoch was translated that he
[47:30] should not see that I was not found
[47:32] because God had translated him
[47:35] for before his translation he had this
[47:37] testimony that he pleased God but
[47:39] without fit it is impossible to please
[47:42] him for he that come into God must
[47:44] believe that he is
[47:45] and that is a rewarder of them that
[47:48] diligently seek Him Allah scripture from
[47:50] first John chapter 5
[47:52] reading from verse 2.
[47:55] by this
[47:56] we know
[47:58] that we love the children of God when we
[48:01] love God
[48:03] and keep his Commandments for this is
[48:06] the love of God that we keep his
[48:08] Commandments and his Commandments are
[48:11] not Grievous
[48:12] it's not Buddhism it's not over heavy
[48:17] okay verse four for whatsoever is born
[48:20] of God overcometh the world
[48:22] and this is the victory that overcometh
[48:24] the world even our faith
[48:26] amen let's spot Pray Again father we
[48:28] thank you for your word and we have read
[48:30] it and we pray that your spirit will
[48:31] come and bring life and bring life to
[48:34] the people this morning granted Lord and
[48:36] Jesus might ask it amen amen you may be
[48:38] seated
[48:39] praise God you know brother Branham said
[48:42] he hope other ministers take the word
[48:45] he's trying to lay in the seeds and he
[48:47] hope to take it and make more sense to
[48:49] it and he didn't stop there like ever
[48:51] since to make an argument but make sense
[48:54] it and he hope that they bring the seats
[48:57] to life
[48:58] so the object of all these bible
[49:00] promises and Bible Sees God wanted to
[49:02] come to life Governor wanted in a book
[49:04] God wanted on a tape he don't want it to
[49:08] just reason on it and listen to it and
[49:09] you listen to the word he wanted to
[49:11] become life the scripture declares and
[49:13] the word became flesh and dwell Among Us
[49:15] so when the world becomes flesh in you
[49:17] the word lives itself out you are not
[49:20] living you the word living through you
[49:23] by you and through you that we're gonna
[49:25] live
[49:26] question do you believe that
[49:29] do you even believe that is possible
[49:31] that this word could live through you
[49:33] and by you do we even think that you
[49:36] could live a Victorious Life
[49:38] after coming through so many defeats
[49:40] that you don't forget every time you go
[49:42] back and ring it says licks again
[49:47] you get so much blues and let me know
[49:49] again he says looks coming you know
[49:51] you're going in because you had to go in
[49:53] but his blog not this morning

[50:09] shortcomings and your mistakes and your
[50:11] errors and your sins you are you nobody

[50:14] yourself then you know it takes a
[50:16] greater power to deal with you nobody
[50:19] can handle you nobody can manage you it
[50:22] will take the spirit of the Living God
[50:24] Moses could reimagine himself with all
[50:27] the knowledge he had that he was born to
[50:28] be delivered Moses couldn't take care of
[50:30] himself with all the information that he
[50:33] was born from mighty task and a mighty
[50:35] Ministry and a mighty calling he
[50:38] couldn't do nothing until he met the
[50:40] pillar of fire until God came on that

[51:23] and it was an experience because that
[51:25] experience caused him to fight he killed
[51:27] a man and then he recognized water more
[51:28] than flowers we would say he had all the
[51:30] tongue had done out the thing altogether
[51:32] until God was ready for him God gave him
[51:35] time with a hot tempered wife God gave
[51:37] him a time to do homework God getting
[51:40] our time to relax himself as if nothing
[51:41] is moving it was a relaxing time for
[51:43] Moses the people of Israel was not
[51:46] burden no more there was out of sight
[51:48] outer mind out the sight out of mind
[51:50] until until something Supernatural begin
[51:54] to move and God couldn't speak to him
[51:57] until Moses turned aside to Sea and
[52:00] someday you have to turn inside to see
[52:02] oh glory to God you have to turn aside
[52:05] to see to have an interest in what God

[54:19] else for me to look and see when the
[54:21] rain trying to come

[54:24] and sometimes I set up dark and you see
[54:26] the rain one to come and you know who
[54:27] will win that battle
[54:29] you should understand
[54:31] shake it off because dry season
[54:34] so the Sun have the upper hand but when
[54:36] is rainy season
[54:38] sometimes it's rain the Sunshine's
[54:40] shining normal normal and in 10 minutes
[54:42] hold them that close like they have a
[54:44] commission
[54:45] to cover the sky and to bring rain you
[54:49] know the season change

[55:02] God the word the promise no devil could
[55:06] stop it
[55:07] all the demons that haunt and you
[55:08] taunting you they can't stop what God is
[55:10] about to do what God is about to release
[55:13] praise God Amen
[55:15] so this morning have a title defeat that
[55:19] overcomes the world
[55:21] the Fate
[55:22] that overcomes the world
[55:26] and you know
[55:27] in the
[55:30] permission now speaking about whatever
[55:31] you asked for in my name as presenting
[55:34] all that I am he may give it to you
[55:38] you see and sometimes and when I when it
[55:41] struck me I start to repent
[55:43] because I realized that we are seeing
[55:46] that t is the I am but there's a level
[55:49] of unbelief
[55:51] in the power of that I am
[55:53] because you are saying I am I am your
[55:55] lawyer I am your doctor I am your healer
[55:59] I am also why you are anxious
[56:02] if he's a provider
[56:04] why are you questioning if you know he
[56:07] gonna make a way for you
[56:09] it come like when Moses was told by the
[56:11] commission to bring them to this place
[56:13] to worship me Moses knew he had a return
[56:15] ticket
[56:16] but Moses was demonstrating oh God
[56:18] Christ look God said white behind me
[56:20] speak and move forward I give you a
[56:23] commission to bring them straight
[56:24] through so if God say your family will
[56:26] be delivered we've got to tell you your
[56:27] family will be delivered I don't care
[56:29] what they're doing now that will God say
[56:32] that's what you have to believe you
[56:34] can't believe different if God said you
[56:36] are going to be delivered you are going
[56:37] to be delivered you don't know how you
[56:39] don't know when but today might be your
[56:41] day but you are going to be delivered
[56:43] and have a time limit on things you know
[56:46] it doesn't go on and on and on you know
[56:48] even time is above a limit God put a
[56:51] limit on time God put a limit on your
[56:54] bondage he said I've heard the cries of
[56:56] my people it had it had all kind of
[56:58] characters among them people but he
[57:00] heard their cries
[57:07] Peter to do this Striker to do that push
[57:10] it to the Taskmaster hanging over you
[57:12] but God coming to break the power of the
[57:14] task master and see it with a portal and
[57:17] complete deliverance
[57:19] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[57:21] world
[57:22] so when you begin to see the I Am
[57:25] whatever he you have need of
[57:27] then you could have confidence
[57:30] in him you could have full trust in him
[57:33] oh glory to God that's why David can say
[57:36] don't ten thousand fall on my right side
[57:38] I shall not be moved because what my
[57:40] shield my popular my strong and mighty
[57:44] tower
[57:45] you are my help Lord glory to God some
[57:48] trust and Men some trust and horses but
[57:51] I
[57:51] trust in the Lord
[57:53] so David had a testimony of his trust in
[57:56] God what about David David had the same
[57:58] testimony God delivered me from the beer
[58:01] God delivered from The Lion and this
[58:03] Goliath
[58:04] oh he wanna be delivered into my hands
[58:06] do you believe that today
[58:08] oh praise God so let's get into the
[58:10] message
[58:14] Mark 11 23.
[58:18] if you shall say to this mountain
[58:21] and this is the God we serve he like to
[58:23] give you the end picture
[58:25] to see where you are predestinated unto
[58:28] to see where you are destined onto this
[58:31] year the third pull if you shall speak
[58:34] if you shall say to the mountain and
[58:36] believe in your heart you can have what
[58:38] you say
[58:39] but before you
[58:41] use you have to ask
[58:43] you have to be able to be and speaking
[58:45] things with God
[58:46] so Jesus said if you shall see then he
[58:48] said when you pray believe you have
[58:50] received and you shall have it
[58:52] now that is a little lower than speaking
[58:54] speaking you have it speaking and it's
[58:55] right there
[58:56] Peter heal below seal below deliver
[58:59] devil go you speak it you have it but
[59:01] before you reach dear he put ask
[59:04] When you pray I'll give you an exercise
[59:06] just believe you have receive it before
[59:08] you get it
[59:09] and I would say get it before you get it
[59:11] you believe you're getting it before you
[59:12] get it because faith is already the
[59:14] substance of what you're hoping for
[59:16] so the revelation of God comes down into
[59:18] your heart as a fate that you have seen
[59:20] the manifestation yet but you believe it
[59:22] Abraham couldn't show exactly anybody
[59:24] but he had Isaac as a fate seed
[59:27] Revelation in his soul nobody could take
[59:30] that out and that comes for your
[59:31] deliverance that comes for your healing
[59:33] that come from your breakthrough that
[59:35] come from your ceiling that come from
[59:37] whatever you have need of it comes
[59:39] inside a deal by a revelation of God
[59:41] that no man can give you only God could
[59:43] give you somebody Gonna Leave You heal
[59:45] today praise God I am speaking it I am
[59:48] believing it somebody only get delivered
[59:50] today praise God because the world
[59:52] brings Deliverance the word brings
[59:54] healing and God is the author of his own
[59:56] word and he will vindicate his word
[59:59] do you believe that
[1:00:01] so not because somebody opening them out
[1:00:03] the praying God is listening
[1:00:05] David said
[1:00:07] in Psalm 66 if I regard iniquity in my
[1:00:12] heart
[1:00:13] the Lord will not hear me
[1:00:15] you could pray for an hour two hours ten
[1:00:17] hours 24 hours God will not hear you if
[1:00:20] there's iniquity in your heart
[1:00:22] and iniquity is knowing to do right and
[1:00:24] doing wrong iniquities when you have
[1:00:26] condemnation in your heart to have the
[1:00:27] freedom to praise and worship God that
[1:00:29] was the devil's job is to make sure you
[1:00:31] got your Light Tangled Up and tied up
[1:00:32] now when you come to church there's no
[1:00:34] praise there's no worship you're sitting
[1:00:36] down here and the wooden hit in your
[1:00:37] head not your heart
[1:00:39] praise God but when iniquity is out you
[1:00:41] could worship God you could praise God
[1:00:44] Psalm 6 18 if I regard iniquity in my
[1:00:47] heart the Lord will not hear me
[1:00:51] but verily God had heard me he had
[1:00:53] attended unto the voice of my prayer
[1:00:55] blessed be God which had not turn away
[1:00:58] my prayer
[1:00:59] nor his Mercy from me
[1:01:02] Proverbs 15 29 the Lord is far from the
[1:01:05] wicked but here at the prayer of the
[1:01:07] righteous
[1:01:08] Oh Glory to God and you're not righteous
[1:01:10] in yourself you're righteous because
[1:01:12] you're under the blood of Jesus you're
[1:01:14] righteous because of his righteousness
[1:01:15] the Lord here with the prayer of the
[1:01:18] shout out righteous
[1:01:20] right standing with God
[1:01:22] it's not right
[1:01:24] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:01:27] and in Proverbs 15 29 in the Amplified
[1:01:29] said the Lord is far from the wicked but
[1:01:32] he hears the prayer of the consistently
[1:01:34] righteous the upright in right standing
[1:01:37] with him
[1:01:39] Matthew 24 12 and because iniquity shall
[1:01:43] abound the love
[1:01:45] of many not some of many Church message
[1:01:49] Believers the love of many with the wax
[1:01:52] call they will go to church and just go
[1:01:54] and warm a bench they will wear dress
[1:01:56] covenantes in service and then outside
[1:01:58] the knees they dress above the knees
[1:02:00] they watch cold they have problems
[1:02:03] having their nails clean face cleaned
[1:02:06] their problems standing and walking as a
[1:02:08] Christian that Muslim coming from head

[1:02:17] everything black just their eyes they
[1:02:19] see it and they're walking proudly but
[1:02:22] questions have a fight Oh Glory to God
[1:02:24] but there's a Mrs Jesus Christ that I'm
[1:02:27] called to address I'm not called to
[1:02:29] address others I'm called to speak to

[1:03:16] amen amen amen let's go
[1:03:21] what is faith

[1:03:24] when Jesus asked them who do men said
[1:03:28] they were anxious and excited to talk
[1:03:30] about what others saying about him and
[1:03:33] there are some people like that they
[1:03:35] could talk to you about others they
[1:03:37] can't talk to you about themselves
[1:03:39] they can't come real with you she said
[1:03:42] he said them say what about you hey
[1:03:47] but Jesus said who do you say I am
[1:03:49] and they were dumb from gold and get
[1:03:51] them
[1:03:52] volume all them they can't talk now
[1:03:54] and Peter broke you and said don't

[1:06:05] Christ defeated him he said have the
[1:06:08] power I have the keys of death and Hell
[1:06:10] oh boy recorder when I talk about faith
[1:06:13] overcoming the world I'm not just
[1:06:15] talking about things and problems and
[1:06:17] issues and situations I am talking about
[1:06:19] your mortality putting on immortality it
[1:06:23] will take Faith to do that to overcome
[1:06:25] this time Dimension to break into our
[1:06:27] Rapture in faith and wrapped in
[1:06:29] condition Oh Glory to God a little more
[1:06:32] than going to church a little more
[1:06:33] unbelieving the word it will take Faith
[1:06:36] because Enoch had it okay the Lord some
[1:06:39] praises
[1:06:40] Enoch was translated Oh Glory to God
[1:06:44] either overcome gravity or glory to God
[1:06:47] he was walking one morning all of a
[1:06:49] sudden he couldn't tell his wife goodbye
[1:06:51] they're between a bed one taken one left
[1:06:54] he couldn't tell his children to go in
[1:06:55] he was walking all of a sudden his feet
[1:06:58] got very light okay the Lord I shout it
[1:07:02] was a wrapped in the sea it was a seat
[1:07:04] that was overcoming gravity will not
[1:07:07] come in the world overcoming these five
[1:07:09] senses
[1:07:10] [Applause]
[1:07:15] my
[1:07:16] [Applause]
[1:07:23] let me see that
[1:07:25] I don't understand why anybody don't
[1:07:28] wouldn't want to break out
[1:07:30] wouldn't want to break out
[1:07:32] of what they end
[1:07:34] is that scripture because they might
[1:07:35] people like it so you know
[1:07:39] the like false prophets
[1:07:42] they're like lying prophecies they like
[1:07:44] some heavy Mysteries with no life behind
[1:07:46] it the life interpretation and
[1:07:48] electoralism to get them are warmth in
[1:07:50] the spirit
[1:07:51] because you see this is the atmosphere
[1:07:53] that you're in and religious spirit
[1:07:55] don't want to be elsewhere they want to
[1:07:57] be in a church atmosphere it's a
[1:07:59] religious spirit
[1:08:02] I know
[1:08:03] what is faith
[1:08:06] faith
[1:08:07] is what what is Faith it is God by the
[1:08:12] spirit
[1:08:13] revealing to you something that he is
[1:08:16] going to do
[1:08:17] or he promised
[1:08:21] God revealing to you
[1:08:24] something he is going to do
[1:08:26] or what he promised
[1:08:28] yet his bum
[1:08:29] if you only hear Faith come by hearing
[1:08:33] watch how deep this is
[1:08:35] if you only hear fake on my hearing but
[1:08:38] hearing is not faith
[1:08:45] a loaf of bread is purchased for 25
[1:08:48] cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of
[1:08:51] bread
[1:08:53] hearing only brings the word that
[1:08:56] produces faith
[1:08:58] so you can't say casually Faith come my
[1:09:00] hearing and hear him by the word of God
[1:09:02] not yet
[1:09:04] not so
[1:09:06] you hear the word to bring you into
[1:09:09] faith
[1:09:10] so hearing is the channel
[1:09:13] by which you get the word
[1:09:15] to activate Faith inside of you
[1:09:18] and faith is the victory that overcomes
[1:09:21] the world that's a little bit here I'm
[1:09:23] gonna do the same thing under here and
[1:09:25] do the same thing because it's not
[1:09:26] revealed it's not unfolded it has to be
[1:09:28] revealed to you oh glory to God and then
[1:09:30] Is Anchored in your soul and only your
[1:09:33] spirit's job is to bring Revelation the
[1:09:35] devil's job is to take care of the
[1:09:37] spirit Leah figure this morning
[1:09:43] to me
[1:09:45] I had time with you
[1:09:47] so looking for stones to chew I see a
[1:09:49] spirited
[1:09:53] into that you know I tried to get a
[1:09:55] message get something for the bride for
[1:09:57] the people and deliver it
[1:10:00] Hallelujah and you have to receive it if
[1:10:02] it's the word of God
[1:10:03] take on my hair and watch
[1:10:06] no faith hearing only brings the word
[1:10:09] that produces Faith but faith is the
[1:10:11] substance of things hoped for the
[1:10:13] evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:10:15] then you see you hear the word god
[1:10:18] revisit to you if it's the truth and by
[1:10:21] his Spirit reveal truth confirms your
[1:10:24] feet to God
[1:10:26] Spirit reveal truth
[1:10:28] so Faith doesn't come by reading
[1:10:30] newspapers and reading magazines Faith
[1:10:33] come by the word it's not right now
[1:10:35] watch notice
[1:10:36] that's the church that God built upon
[1:10:39] the rock that the Gatesville can't
[1:10:40] reveal against it
[1:10:42] 20 000 people in this congregation
[1:10:45] and only 50 people have Revelation in
[1:10:48] that conversation you see we're going on
[1:10:50] there
[1:10:51] you see what's happening there now the
[1:10:52] church is not built upon those who
[1:10:54] doesn't know the church is built upon
[1:10:56] the Revelation that those 50 people have
[1:10:58] inside
[1:10:59] that's the rock so this kingdom is not a
[1:11:02] church thing
[1:11:03] come on now write with me this kingdom
[1:11:06] is that I Fellowship in here you know
[1:11:08] the kingdom we're talking about this
[1:11:11] kingdom is a spirit kingdom and the Holy
[1:11:13] Ghost baptize you into that Kingdom you
[1:11:16] are placed into that Kingdom and when

[1:11:24] Kingdom of armies in that Kingdom of our
[1:11:25] King in our kingdom of a domain in our
[1:11:28] kingdom of protection

[1:11:44] subjects of my kingdom or can the Lord

[1:12:30] what does it do what is Faith what is
[1:12:33] the Conqueror conqueror and the Victory
[1:12:34] is the same

[1:47:11] if God when I was an alien from him so
[1:47:14] loved me till he stooped down to get me
[1:47:16] and pick me up that gives me the
[1:47:18] confidence that he wants to use me
[1:47:22] do you believe God want to use you
[1:47:27] not to bring embarrassment to the

[1:57:35] no Resurrection
[1:57:36] dead man
[1:57:38] so if you have the resurrection power
[1:57:39] Resurrection God's blessing God has to
[1:57:41] take you to something
[1:57:43] David said do I walk through the valley
[1:57:44] of the shadow of death I shall fear no
[1:57:46] evil for thou art with me that I read
[1:57:49] and stuff they Comfort Me Oh Glory to
[1:57:52] God hallelujah there's always that value
[1:57:54] after pass through
[1:57:56] pissing on both sides devil hissing on
[1:57:59] this side of hissing that side and all
[1:58:00] you keep focused don't look at them he
[1:58:03] says let them keep listening they can't
[1:58:05] make it you can't make it you're going
[1:58:06] too far you're not supposed to go there
[1:58:08] we are supposed to go no we're the sons
[1:58:10] of God we are supposed to go return in
[1:58:12] trouble we are supposed to go Oh Glory
[1:58:15] to God I'm going to the Lord I'm going
[1:58:17] under the Hill from and call my help I
[1:58:20] will look unto the hill so make up my
[1:58:21] help comes from the Lord and when you
[1:58:23] recognize where hell coming from you
[1:58:25] could get strength to press on and get a
[1:58:27] picture in God you need to break through
[1:58:29] this morning
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:32] all right
[1:58:32] [Applause]
[1:58:34] now first let me go
[1:58:37] are we doing good
[1:58:38] at first the disciples didn't have this
[1:58:41] perfect faith
[1:58:42] they didn't have it here's why because
[1:58:45] they had Christ walking with them
[1:58:48] but then afterwards Christ was in them
[1:58:51] so he could walk with you and not in you
[1:58:54] walking with you he's still with you
[1:58:56] oh I'll never leave you I'll never see
[1:58:58] you walking with you but he wants to get
[1:59:00] into you
[1:59:01] do you believe that
[1:59:02] so you see it's hard then to have this
[1:59:06] perfect fit without the Holy Spirit
[1:59:08] it has to bring it it does
[1:59:12] so the same Holy Spirit the people
[1:59:14] reject
[1:59:15] is what have to bring the Fate
[1:59:17] and to leave this earth to overcome this
[1:59:20] world to overcome gravity we need defeat
[1:59:28] look at our tragedy this week on here a
[1:59:30] man take some people long to see Titanic
[1:59:32] the wreck and the ship just disintegrate
[1:59:35] and blow up
[1:59:36] when they check him out no he do a thing
[1:59:38] he tracking it wasn't legitimate it
[1:59:40] wasn't qualified it wasn't the
[1:59:41] constructed right and it blew up
[1:59:43] people lost their lives a billionaire
[1:59:45] and a son they say they would have died
[1:59:47] instantly I wonder what was the
[1:59:49] condition of their soul
[1:59:51] because they have the money they could
[1:59:52] go down to see a wreck that was wreck
[1:59:54] since 1912 or 1916 or whatever was
[1:59:57] wrecked and Tyler was wrecked when they
[1:59:59] say not even God could sing this ship
[2:00:01] and go through them who is the boss
[2:00:04] put it to the Bottom of the Sea not even
[2:00:06] God could sing the ship so proud was it
[2:00:09] wasn't man's achievement God sink it
[2:00:11] it's still down there
[2:00:12] people lost their lives
[2:00:14] Hallelujah leaning on the strength of
[2:00:17] mans and man's ability lean on the
[2:00:19] strength of Demands and Man's power Oh
[2:00:22] Glory to God hallelujah praise God glory
[2:00:25] to God so it's hard to have this perfect
[2:00:27] fit without the Holy Spirit it has to
[2:00:30] bring it no the disciples didn't have
[2:00:32] the perfect fate for the other epileptic
[2:00:36] child there and they were trying to cast
[2:00:38] this devil out and they couldn't do it
[2:00:40] and the father seen Jesus come and said
[2:00:42] we brought my son to your disciples and
[2:00:44] they could not kill him
[2:00:46] afterwards the disciples asked Jesus why
[2:00:49] could we not kill him
[2:00:51] and Jesus said because of lack of faith
[2:00:55] no God Jesus give him power
[2:00:57] but they had
[2:00:59] some level of unbelief
[2:01:02] unconscious unbelief they themselves
[2:01:04] didn't even know they were lacking in
[2:01:06] faith they thought was business unusual
[2:01:09] come on devil
[2:01:10] and their customers saying that and they
[2:01:12] will come out and moving
[2:01:13] but that epilepsy
[2:01:15] here moving
[2:01:17] but I didn't say that episode talk back
[2:01:19] to them I said listen Jesus told the
[2:01:21] class but not one of you could do it
[2:01:24] the spirit had to talk back to them
[2:01:26] Jesus told you all to cast me out I'm
[2:01:29] not one of you could do it
[2:01:31] and Jesus no come out of adoption
[2:01:34] he know coming of the mountain quietly
[2:01:37] he's walking down the mountain now and
[2:01:40] he said the devil said the German one
[2:01:41] time
[2:01:42] yes I don't talk yet does everyone want
[2:01:44] to know where to go how fast to go is to
[2:01:47] go immediately or immediately
[2:01:48] immediately you want to know faster get
[2:01:50] other side of there because our power
[2:01:52] coming I live in faith I live in virtue
[2:01:55] and living knowledge I live in
[2:01:57] Temperance and living patience and
[2:01:59] living godliness and living Godly
[2:02:01] kindness charity the love of God a life
[2:02:05] walking down with Thunders lightning and
[2:02:08] voices every devil has shaken up oh give
[2:02:11] the Lord some praises
[2:02:13] oh Gloria
[2:02:15] let me see if I can say you know wow
[2:02:18] remember let's continue they had the
[2:02:21] power here we go
[2:02:22] Jesus had given them power to heal the
[2:02:25] sick to raise the dead and cast out
[2:02:28] Devils just a few days before that they
[2:02:30] had the power
[2:02:32] but not the Fate to use the power
[2:02:38] did you get that church
[2:02:40] they had power but not the faith to move
[2:02:42] the power then he said no there's
[2:02:44] Ibraham Tabernacle there's the church
[2:02:46] The Brighter Day the holy spirit is here
[2:02:49] with the power but you haven't got the
[2:02:51] faith to move it it takes faith
[2:02:55] to move it
[2:02:56] it takes faith
[2:02:59] to move it
[2:03:00] sober the brown gods and a prophet to
[2:03:03] turn our hearts
[2:03:04] back
[2:03:06] to the faith of the fathers that we
[2:03:08] could take the faith
[2:03:10] and move the power
[2:03:12] okay the Lord I shall do you get that
[2:03:13] now
[2:03:14] could do you get that job
[2:03:18] [Applause]
[2:03:20] not to stand up here and explained
[2:03:22] mysteries for the last 50 years and we
[2:03:24] can't be the chance they are
[2:03:35] that name is not just a name
[2:03:38] I mean we'll have a reputation of
[2:03:40] killing people
[2:03:40] and he said if he had the gun he should
[2:03:42] have gone unpaid
[2:03:43] but amidst that you both come
[2:03:48] and he said gosh he forgets a gun and
[2:03:50] then he says something came over him
[2:03:53] you see that something
[2:03:55] you need that something
[2:04:00] what if he did not have something
[2:04:02] he said bull this mystery of these Seven
[2:04:04] Seas and seven trumpets in seven
[2:04:05] violence and seven wolves so one of his
[2:04:07] son
[2:04:12] don't understand that language
[2:04:14] the language people understand is the
[2:04:16] language of l-o-v-e love
[2:04:18] that's the original language that Adam
[2:04:21] had when he was dominating
[2:04:23] over the Beast of the field Adam had
[2:04:26] love flowing through him or give the
[2:04:28] Lord a praise
[2:04:30] Hallelujah through the fall of Man he
[2:04:33] got that love broken so he and Eve have
[2:04:35] this harmony
[2:04:39] because it's a brick of the connection
[2:04:41] with God
[2:04:43] every husband had no connection how the
[2:04:44] wife go connect with that the wife of
[2:04:46] connection holy husband connect with
[2:04:48] that both have to connect with God then
[2:04:50] they can connect with other when when it
[2:04:52] was broken relationship was broken
[2:04:53] because Adam connection with God was
[2:04:55] broken
[2:04:56] so everything else was broken oh give
[2:04:58] the Lord some praise do you see it now
[2:05:00] Hallelujah prayed so love came over by
[2:05:02] the Branham and the bull coming down he
[2:05:04] said bull I come to pray for a civil of

[2:09:46] Holy Ghost faithful Revival you've got
[2:09:48] to have that this morning
[2:09:50] oh my my
[2:09:52] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[2:09:56] God praise God hallelujah
[2:09:59] remember they had the word
[2:10:01] and the Word was flesh then
[2:10:03] and the word told them I give you power
[2:10:05] I give you power they had the power but
[2:10:09] they didn't have the faith to operate
[2:10:12] the wood that was in them
[2:10:15] not how we place that what's the secret
[2:10:18] the word is in the bride and what is
[2:10:21] telling us now you have to have faith to
[2:10:24] operate the word that is in you God put
[2:10:28] the word in you you see when 1906 came
[2:10:31] and the Holy Ghost fell it fell among
[2:10:33] people without the word so Pentecostal
[2:10:36] was shocked they had the anointing they
[2:10:38] had tongues they had signs and wonders
[2:10:40] but they had nothing to hold it because
[2:10:42] the prophet didn't come yet so they
[2:10:44] didn't have the word to hold it so God
[2:10:47] was using men men in adultery men
[2:10:49] fornicating men with other people's
[2:10:51] wives and so on God's still using them
[2:10:54] but God purposed not so again he's not a
[2:10:56] prophet to bring the word and the world
[2:10:58] will bring us into character character
[2:11:00] formation by the Charles of our faith
[2:11:03] and that character will connect with
[2:11:05] power Oh Glory to God give the Lord some
[2:11:09] Praises so this is not the Pentecostal
[2:11:11] age where God using flesh God using his
[2:11:15] own word in you okay the Lord some
[2:11:17] Praises do you get that tonight do you
[2:11:20] get that this morning he is not using
[2:11:22] men he's using the word he put him in
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:26] [Applause]
[2:11:29] so you sitting there must be able to see
[2:11:31] the operation of God as the spirit of
[2:11:34] God take the man of God and spit all the
[2:11:36] ways out of his mouth you know it's not
[2:11:38] a man is the spirit speaking expressly
[2:11:41] ministering to you
[2:11:43] Oh Glory to God hallelujah they didn't
[2:11:46] have the power the Fate to operate the
[2:11:48] word that was in them see what I mean
[2:11:50] but Jesus had it he was the word and he
[2:11:54] had faith in what he said would happen
[2:11:56] Oh my he had Faith with his power so he
[2:12:00] cannot power and no faith and they gotta
[2:12:02] faith and no power but he needs to come
[2:12:03] together it's not right praise God he
[2:12:07] said I can't do nothing in myself why he
[2:12:09] relied upon what he was he relied on
[2:12:11] knowing he was the word he had faith in
[2:12:13] God who made him the word you see that
[2:12:15] he was the word he had faith in God who
[2:12:17] made him the word what has God Made You
[2:12:19] God called you all to what to be a
[2:12:21] church member or God called it to be the
[2:12:23] Bride of Jesus Christ God Called It Be
[2:12:25] the wife of the Lamb you talk about I'm
[2:12:27] not worthy that's not the issue
[2:12:28] worthiness that come into this question
[2:12:30] is what God choose oh give the Lord a
[2:12:32] shout
[2:12:33] when elieza was praying for a bride for
[2:12:35] Isaac he said Lord let the damself come
[2:12:38] that offer me to feed my camera with
[2:12:41] water praise God and give me water and
[2:12:43] feed my camel Also let her be the
[2:12:45] damself
[2:12:48] is a good thing God didn't tell that in
[2:12:51] a text message to all them sisters in
[2:12:52] that area
[2:12:54] hold everyone with buckets one time to
[2:12:56] feed him
[2:12:59] but Ilyas I prayed in his heart
[2:13:01] and here come Rebecca Rebecca always

[2:17:59] a stick one time I say looking like
[2:18:00] Moses he dropped his sick one time
[2:18:03] he said no no I said you dropped the
[2:18:05] second one time I say look like most
[2:18:08] say look at him you're running for me
[2:18:10] calling
[2:18:11] you might want to be Moses yet
[2:18:13] I want to be Spider-Man and everything
[2:18:15] else praise God but God coming for them
[2:18:18] because prayers hanging over them and
[2:18:20] when you chop them prayers over your
[2:18:22] children drop them prayers over your
[2:18:24] family if you die the prayers still
[2:18:26] stand if they die the person that file
[2:18:29] and when they go go take your present
[2:18:31] pour it out don't stop praying don't
[2:18:33] stop sighing don't stop crying oh give
[2:18:37] the Lord some praises
[2:18:38] [Applause]
[2:18:42] Hallelujah
[2:18:44] so you have to have faith that you're a
[2:18:45] believer
[2:18:46] a believer of this word isn't that right
[2:18:48] all right
[2:18:50] here we go as long as you're doing
[2:18:52] things wrong
[2:18:53] you can't have confidence towards God
[2:18:56] so you're automatically know you're
[2:18:58] wrong you automatically put yourself
[2:19:00] back there a sinner by knowing your own
[2:19:03] the devil don't have to bother with you
[2:19:05] you know he just know you're doing it
[2:19:06] wrong he said leave that one alone that
[2:19:08] one called them already
[2:19:11] up like Moses and put a brick underneath
[2:19:14] it
[2:19:16] they're doing nothing
[2:19:18] because the heart condemned already
[2:19:20] so the first thing I want to do is like
[2:19:21] take that condemnation out of your heart
[2:19:23] that you don't leave they're condemned
[2:19:25] you could leave her with a relief
[2:19:27] when when brother Branham
[2:19:30] the taxman was terrorizing by the brand
[2:19:33] and the man came to the front of the
[2:19:34] house he run outside tell you I tell him
[2:19:38] tell him tell him I know this idea so
[2:19:40] you run on the house technically he's
[2:19:41] outside
[2:19:42] that technical thing and I'm not inside
[2:19:45] the house I'm not
[2:19:48] when he did that I think somebody come
[2:19:50] and bring a baby fame or something like
[2:19:52] that and he prayed God say hypocrite
[2:19:54] Amanda pray for the sick
[2:19:57] make that right first he had a cold
[2:19:59] attack myself listen I was right there
[2:20:00] decided
[2:20:02] I tell my wife the lie to say I wasn't
[2:20:04] there and when he correct that he could
[2:20:07] come and pray and go dancing
[2:20:10] so don't be surprised if I need to make
[2:20:13] things right make it right
[2:20:14] make it right and go go hear your prayer
[2:20:16] go gonna answer your prayer go gonna
[2:20:18] give you that breakthrough as long as
[2:20:21] you're doing things that's wrong you
[2:20:22] can't have confidence towards God
[2:20:25] so you automatically know that you're
[2:20:27] wrong you automatically put yourself
[2:20:28] back there a sinner by knowing that
[2:20:31] you're wrong but when your heart don't
[2:20:33] condemn you you know you're a Believer
[2:20:35] there's nothing between you and God you
[2:20:37] can ask what you will and know it will
[2:20:39] be given because it's the word is given
[2:20:41] to you just like those disciples
[2:20:44] the only thing you have to do then is to
[2:20:46] have faith in what you are
[2:20:47] have faith and what the words say you
[2:20:49] are so it's not so much you you know is
[2:20:51] what God placed you what God called you
[2:20:53] to oh my Hallelujah
[2:20:56] praise God praise God
[2:20:58] A Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus had
[2:21:01] perfect feet he had it because he was
[2:21:04] the word
[2:21:05] are you ready now
[2:21:06] that sounds good right this will song
[2:21:09] even better and you become the word as
[2:21:12] you receive the word
[2:21:13] [Applause]
[2:21:15] that's not good enough
[2:21:17] I want the devil I want you to say Amen
[2:21:20] to let the devil know whose side you're
[2:21:22] on you become the word
[2:21:25] as you receive the word
[2:21:27] and when you say and when you say Amen
[2:21:30] you are confirming you're receiving the
[2:21:31] word your amen is the word receipt
[2:21:34] [Applause]
[2:21:34] [Music]

[2:21:48] in you said John you can ask what you
[2:21:50] will will be done then recognize your
[2:21:53] position in the scripture as a believer

[2:22:47] you're walking the spirit and when the
[2:22:49] spirit said you will do what it forbid

[2:22:55] that's the way it is to all believers
[2:22:57] their Mystic the people don't understand
[2:22:59] because they live in the world to
[2:23:01] themselves Jesus live in a world that

[2:25:47] revelation from God Peter alone had it
[2:25:49] and he said the word Peter and upon his
[2:25:51] Rock I'll build my church so faith can
[2:25:53] be shared

[2:26:30] at his feet
[2:26:34] Glory
[2:26:40] this is good
[2:26:41] when a man lives by faith
[2:26:43] are you living by faith or flesh
[2:26:46] you argue because you're in the flesh
[2:26:48] you argue because you're not seeing God
[2:26:52] and you feel you have to make a point
[2:26:55] when you make a point it's like a win
[2:26:59] take win
[2:27:01] that's the name
[2:27:03] when they want to make a point they say
[2:27:04] but take away and take with you you win

[2:27:40] bad spirited people
[2:27:42] in church
[2:27:47] like people in church and like church
[2:27:49] folks
[2:27:52] all right let's go
[2:27:55] when I'm unless by faith and walk by
[2:27:57] faith I mean substance Faith he's
[2:27:58] isolated from the entire world
[2:28:01] and becoming the recruiter in Christ
[2:28:02] there now you are getting into bright
[2:28:05] material
[2:28:06] see see you are getting into rapturing
[2:28:10] condition now
[2:28:12] that means for each one of us
[2:28:14] here we go not just the pastor the
[2:28:17] deacons the trustees that means the
[2:28:20] laity every individual walks in a world
[2:28:24] where God Alone
[2:28:26] you are baptized into this kingdom and
[2:28:29] there's nobody in there but you and God
[2:28:33] could we get there
[2:28:35] could we as individuals get to a place
[2:28:37] where
[2:28:38] you and God Alone
[2:28:41] doesn't matter what sisters will say
[2:28:43] Brothers one say what preachers say what
[2:28:46] pastors say it matters what God's saying
[2:28:49] you and God in a cocoon
[2:28:53] wrap up here now
[2:28:55] hope you're not tired
[2:28:57] before the astronauts leave here before
[2:29:00] they take off on those please
[2:29:01] in space is weightlessness
[2:29:04] there's no gravity up there so when they
[2:29:06] have to drink something you see them
[2:29:08] doing so
[2:29:09] and they drink floating from them and a
[2:29:11] whole drink and pull it so that's how
[2:29:12] they go
[2:29:15] you walk in prison don't walk brisking
[2:29:17] yeah you know when you're walking you're
[2:29:19] walking so
[2:29:22] it's weightlessness
[2:29:24] so when somebody send a cup to you the
[2:29:26] cup floating same speed
[2:29:28] I see the cop coming towards you the
[2:29:29] copy hustling you know
[2:29:31] and you had to reach up your hands too
[2:29:32] and get it up soon bring it to zero
[2:29:35] gravity
[2:29:36] no you don't send a man up there who
[2:29:37] never experienced that
[2:29:39] you have to have create that zero
[2:29:41] gravity on Earth
[2:29:42] and they get a training
[2:29:44] to understand how to pick up things put
[2:29:46] away things handle things and move and
[2:29:49] they have to live in that environment
[2:29:50] because up there is like that
[2:29:53] of their different
[2:29:54] are you with me
[2:29:56] if there's a Rapture and we know there
[2:29:58] is
[2:29:59] it has to be an environment of training
[2:30:03] that we can walk with a substance Faith
[2:30:06] live with the substant faith knowing
[2:30:09] that we're going to believe in here
[2:30:11] you know what he says
[2:30:12] the resurrected Saints will appear to
[2:30:14] those who live in
[2:30:17] and you're gonna know who they are
[2:30:19] [Applause]
[2:30:21] in the Bible the sleeping sense arose
[2:30:23] and appear to many
[2:30:25] so they hurt our people from Among Us
[2:30:27] who have left
[2:30:28] that when they come you know it's time
[2:30:30] up
[2:30:31] you know what's happening
[2:30:33] they didn't appear to the public you
[2:30:34] know they appear to be elected or give
[2:30:37] the Lord a praise offering
[2:30:39] glory to God give the Lord a shout
[2:30:42] they are going to appear
[2:30:44] [Applause]
[2:30:50] what
[2:30:51] that means for the laity every
[2:30:53] individual walks in the world but God
[2:30:55] alone you are baptized into this Kingdom
[2:30:57] there's nobody in there but you and God
[2:30:59] see he give the orders you pack them out
[2:31:01] whatever he says there's not a shattered
[2:31:02] out nowhere you walk right in if the
[2:31:04] Lord says this there's nobody in the
[2:31:06] world can talk you out of it you go
[2:31:07] right on do the same now you are coming
[2:31:10] into perfect fit
[2:31:13] his perfect Perfection that cannot feel
[2:31:18] my God that faith never fails he was a
[2:31:22] Mystic to them with his Perfect Fit And
[2:31:23] so there's no way those who are perfect
[2:31:24] will you miss it to others notice now
[2:31:26] perfect Faith Masters is a must of all
[2:31:30] circumstances
[2:31:33] perfect Faith Masters all circumstances
[2:31:36] no matter what it is
[2:31:38] if in a room of sickness the Lord
[2:31:40] revealed this is going to happen you
[2:31:41] just speak it and go on you don't ask
[2:31:43] questions it's already over faith
[2:31:45] believes God will work it out I don't
[2:31:47] know how he's going to do it but he will
[2:31:49] do it anyhow it's a master of all
