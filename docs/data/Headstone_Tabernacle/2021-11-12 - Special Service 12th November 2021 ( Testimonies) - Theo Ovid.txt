bless you and welcome tonight thanks for being here among us uh we certainly appreciate you being here and um i'd like to share something with you before we have two testimonies as we'll come up just a few moments but we want to share something with you tonight so god bless you if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to hebrews chapter 2 hebrews chapter 2 i trust you are enjoying the lord enjoying the bible study the teaching the services the rhythmic services i trust them that you're receiving and you're applying what you're hearing and hebrews 2 says chapter 2 therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them slip for if the words spoken by angels were steadfast and every transgression and disobedience receive a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will for unto the angels had he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak but one in a certain place testified saying what is man about mindful of him or the son of man that dog visits in him though marries him to what man a little lower than the angels now crowned him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hands though has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him i want to read that very amplified for you have put everything its subjection under his feet to what man now when putting everything in subjection to man he left nothing outside of man's control but at present we do not yet see all things subject to him man this night but we see jesus who was made a little lord of the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should tease death for every man amplified we are able to see jesus who was ranked lower than the angels for a little while crowned with glory and honor because of his having suffered that in order that by his grace unmerited favor of god to us sinners he might experience debt for every individual person who is ten for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of the salvation perfect through suffering amplified for it is an act worthy of god and fit into the divine nature that he for whose sake and by whom all things have the existence in bringing many sons into glory should make the pioneer of the salvation perfect should bring to maturity the human experience necessary to be perfectly equipped for his office as a high priest through suffering verse 11 for he both he that sanctified and they who are sanctified are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praises unto thee and again i'll put my trust in him and again the whole i and the cherubimist god has given me for as much here we go as the children which is us are partakers of flesh and blood he also likewise took part of the same and true death he might destroy him that had the power of debt that is of the devil the amplified since therefore these his children shear in flesh and blood in physical nature of human beings he himself in a similar manner partook of the same nature that by going through debt he might bring to note and make of no effect him who had power of death that is the devil verse 15 and delivered them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject abundance for verily glory he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham and this verse here in the amplified says for as we all know he christ did not take hold of angels the fallen angels to give them helping and delivering hand but he did take hold of the fallen descendants of abraham to reach out to them a helping and delivering hand to 17. wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of his people humbly fighting 17 says so it is evident that it was essential that he be made like his brethren in every respect in order that he might become a merciful sympathetic and faithful high priest in the things related to god to make atonement and preparation for the sins of people's sins verse 18 for in that he himself had suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that attempted the amplified for because he himself in his humanity has suffered in being tempted tested and tried he is able immediately to run to the cry assist relieve those who are being tempted tested and tried who therefore are being exposed to suffering may god bless this world isn't that a wonderful script to reading tonight that christ became one of us that we could become like him so that can't fail so even in your failures in your temptations in your suffering understand the mission that he came with he came to break the power of debt and spread the power of hell to bring liberty to the royal seas of abraham so tonight even though we were born in sin and shape iniquity christ came forward that we could get that big breakthrough you know what he did he called us bretville could we give the lord a hand the praise jesus call us brethren just a little more and we're going to hear from the rhetoric all right brother brown look when elijah was on the hill he said if i be a man of god let the fire fall and heaven will consume you and god be a witness he was a man of god god always be a witness your life will be a witness i don't know what your testimony is but your life speaks so loud your voice can be heard your living your everyday life will testify what you are hallelujah god be a witness yes the holy spirit is a seal and i see you takes both sides of the people do you see you standing here they see you when you go away not only in church but that everyday work you're sealed on both sides inside and outside by the jaw you have by the life that you live you are sealed in and outside and you know you are safe and the world knows you're saved by the life that you live he said brother when the world knows that you have been with jesus when you can live such an uncultivated life in this present world in this darkness that the world knows and can see that you have been with jesus when a rugged old vulgar prostitute on the street can become a lady washed in the blood of the lamb god is bearing witness that he lives take a drunkard who is so low down that he would run around on his wife and would mistreat his children and take the food from their table to spend on a prostitute let him get with jesus once you will see him returning like legion whereas in his right mind and close to his babies under his wife and to his loved ones suddenly almost finished here some time ago he's talking about a little doctor who went to give her testimony and spoke of christianity and he told the story of lady maccabee of oklahoma and america she was so ornery so lowed down till even when they went to kill her they wouldn't even put their hands on her she was so vulgar and vile they had her arrested on a charge smoking a cigar driving a stagecoach broke the laws the records in oklahoma when she passed through the street driving four headed horses she was so violent so dirty until society would even get around when she was that so much until when the executors was going to execute her they wouldn't even hang her just four times feathers on her to kill her and when this little preacher gave her story in such a way till he had the people sitting on the edge of their seats listening what would be next and when he got down to that very vile dirty louder until the lords wouldn't even want to fool with her she was so low the very devil in hell would reject the chocolate snail the way he told the story and when he said gentleman of the religions of the world has your religion cut anything that would clean the hands of lady macabee everybody set still and then he clapped his hands together and jumped in the air he said glory be to god the blood of jesus christ won't only clean her hands but they will clean her heart and make her his bride and then go around begin to sing amazing grace how sweet the song that see the rest like me you say how shall we escape if we dig like such you get to eat you will die you neglected in a corner you would wreck you neglect to melt the cow she will go dry you neglect your teeth you'll have them pulled out certainly you will pay for your neglection oh branham tabernacle are you visitors let me tell you something now you neglect to testify of the glory of god you neglect to give god the praise and the glory you would find yourself cool former and pakistan one of these days you give god praise how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation and this is the last thing i have here oh christ when i read here how they wondered about in sheepskins goatskin live in the dens of the earth and caves they wandered about under vile persecution and yet obtained defeat under the ministry of angels how will we escape when the lord jesus give us fine homes and cars and clothes and food and we murmur we sit around we are lazy we never try to get out and do something about it how will we escape god who i pray that you will burn old fashioned conviction into every heart of god in every heart this morning we say tonight lord that people might be up and at it let us work but the daylight is shining because the sun is swiftly sinking and civilization is going and there'll be no more time to blend eternity god grant today that we go with a fresh vision with wisdom with understanding to know how to approach sinners and bring them to christ hear the prayer of your servant lord so he said if we neglect to testify if we neglect to give god praise and glory we find ourselves back sitting someday and i'm so happy that we have a veteran who willing to testify and give a testimony one brother assured me he felt like if he even testified he was going to burst he just had was to say something it was almost as if god opened up a well god open up a channel that he could express the grace of god to his life and i believe that what that's what we're going to see tonight god's grace on people's lives oh god kept them oh god dealt with them and god led them and and we we're going to see that because as the prophet said that when we get on the other side we'll be surprised to know who's there the strugglers the weak ones the ones that jim might even think gonna make it they're gonna make it because of god's grace because of god love jesus didn't come for strong people he came for the weak he came for the downtrodden he came for the accident he came for the sinners he came that's why when he was among them the scribe and pharisees had a problem dealing with that he said this man would find bibles he would be moving with his sinners jesus told them this the well don't need of a physician but the sick they do they need a physician do you need a physician tonight if you're not well in heart and mind and spirit then christ could minister to you by something somebody says testify everybody have a story every one of you have a story story only you can tell it's your story it's not a story how strong you are the story of the grace of god comes into your life i have a story i have a testimony and the key just as you have also and the key to it is is what do you learn from what you go through more than anything else and i hope that it will resonate in your heart are you learning because to grow is to learn we don't want you just come to church we want you to sit back listen learn grow you might want to look back and say you know what i was this way two years ago but i'm changed now i'm being more patient and being more willing to wait upon the lord you hear me share something on you about the beauty of holiness and i send out a text and something like that that you could reflect on the scriptures and they reflect on what god is speaking to your heart that you could begin to think i want to be like him i want to be an under sanctification i want to be where i could guide not just my heart but before you could guard your heart you have to guide your mind because every day you are bombarded by thoughts by words like texts by messages and everything and then if you stay too long holding these things drops into your heart and then give your desire and that desire is what will drive people that lust that desire so by god's grace and god's help i trust then that the word become the legislation of your heart but you see really why god will tell joshua meditate on the word day at night it's christianity is a process another one tablet and you threw it in and you take a pill and you're okay no you fight every day you battle every day you pray every day you try to read the bible every day try to get a word every day you want to fill your soul so tonight it's my privilege to invite uh sister elise o'brien she would share a testimony with us tonight uh by the grace of god and i want to welcome her we have known to alicia for a long a long long time and we want to invite her now praise the lord who call a minister's elisa trying to somehow but isaac could you help here on muta okay thank you let me just get this thank you very over a pleasant good night everyone um it is my pleasure to be here to give a short testimony of the grace of god in my life are you hearing me okay yes okay um i was 19 years old when the lord called me i come from a very strong a very staunch catholic background um i had my first job at age 19 at inven revenue and i remember very distinct it was a monday at lunch time i was walking through woodford square on my way to lunch and i was thinking i said no one knows anything about god and i wish that i could find somebody who did lo and behold wednesday of that week my supervisor came to me and she said listen i have someone who's going to be your understudy you have to teach this person the ropes and show them everything that you knew i said fine i agree the new recruit stood before me wearing a long sleeve shirt buttoned up to the neck and down to the cuffs of this sleeve down down there at the sleeve i took one look at him and i thought oh my you look like you are something else um before i could say a word he said do you know jesus so i was really taken aback you know so and he repeated do you know jesus i said no i have a nodding acquaintance with him he said a nodding acquaintance that's not good enough i asked who are you and he said i am ricardo bramble minister of god and that's how i met brother ikaru he spoke about god all day long and i listened to him all day long i was so intrigued to learn about the holy ghost and baptism in jesus name serpent seed and lots more i felt i was being given a handbook to the message he told me all about the glory days when brothers would board the bus to san fernando and preach all the way you know they would be preaching to the people i said so how did the people react to this he said well they couldn't do anything else they were a captive audience they couldn't jump up the bus and they had to listen to us preach and he said along the way some of the people are actually clapping and singing and some were upset and say you will find that you know some of them dictate and some did not but they got an opportunity to preach and as he was talking i wish i was there in those days when everything was so you know exciting it seemed to me like it was that way so i said how do you know all this stuff about god and everything and he said well god sent a prophet his name is william marion branham 20th century prophet so i i made a connection i said that is what i wanted to know i wanted to find somebody who knew about god and this is the man william marion branham i said how can i meet him i want to talk to him i still have so many questions i want to ask him he said well he's dead i was so disappointed he said but wait you know he's he he has books and tapes that he's left behind so we can i bring you some books and some tips and i started to read the books and listen to the tips and from that time until now every time i pick up a book i am in floods of tales i cannot read a spoken word book without ending up very emotional i just get so involved in it and the spirit of gorgeous it's just amazing every time i may have read a book years ago and i'll go now and pick it up and it has the same effect on me every time floods of tears um but ricardo never smiled later on he lightened up but at that time he was a very serious person so he would rebuke the ladies in the office about their short skills and their makeup and he would talk to them men about their misbehavior and so on so i asked him one day i said do you know that what you are called at the office you have a name here you know that he said no what do they call me i said they call you fire and brimstone bramble well he started to laugh i never saw him laugh in my life he laughed and laughed and laughed he said that's what they're calling me and say yes they call you fire and brimstone bramble he said well at least they're getting the message and to cut a short long long a story uh a long story short we became great friends and his wife and i we became great friends and they are both deceased now but they played a really major part in initiating me into the message and understanding all about god and everything else i became i got baptized one month later and uh my sister who was supposed to join the nunnery came to my baptism i used to talk to her about the message and about the prophet and so on i didn't even know if she took me on but she came to my baptism and um she was so touched by it something happened she had an epic experience with the presence of god and she immediately changed her mind about becoming a nun and she decided i want to get baptized she said i like what is happening here this has really touched me and um since that time the lord has really dealt with me over the years and i realized that i was full of head knowledge but i had no heart experience and i wanted an experience of the heart with the lord i knew a lot of things i had a lot of knowledge and so on but i didn't have that hard experience so i was looking for that and longing for that throughout the years um over time i got married to my darling husband barry o'brien we met and we got married and my husband or my children often ask me so mommy why did you marry daddy so i said well he has a lovely smile and beautiful teeth and they didn't buy that at all they say come on mommy tell us the truth so i did i said well at the time um in those days young man didn't dress like that he did he had his tie and his shirt and when he was ready for church he had a big bible in his hand in those days brothers flashed their bible like a sword it wasn't a shame to walk around with her bible you know it was a thing i mean you were subject to ridicule just being looked at like that but he didn't care he walked he said i'm dressing for jesus and he would dress in his until and walk with his bible in his hand so um he was he's also a prayer warrior five o'clock in the morning he's up praying and he has been like that all the time so i admire that you know and so that was the person i wanted in my life out of that bond came two beautiful children like anthony and you know in your christian journey god comes and he confirms to you that he's with you he's with you and he's real and that really does a lot for your faith and everything else um that was in the 80s in 1983 i skipped over to 1983 um that was the ceiling season when the spirit the holy ghost was falling and people were getting packed out and it was a wonderful marvelous time the young people were being sealed and the older ones were just getting their experiences and wave after wave of the holy spirit was just flowing over the people and so on and um uh we had belmont on fire that year really really the place was on fire everybody knew well you know here it is there's a bunch of people down there just experiencing something really special from god and we created quite a hullabaloo in belmont the church went from house to house after a while having cottage meetings house meetings and our apartment we were newly married so it was our turn to host the cottage meeting so we went to our landlady and we told her um we told her that we were going to have a meeting she said no problem at the time uh life was tough we wanted our rent to be lowered so we could live and eat so we approached her and she wasn't too crazy about that so we went to the rent assessment board and she wasn't happy about that either and um so i don't know how she managed to allow us to have the meeting but we did and as we were there we made a lot of noise the next day she was really upset with us and um this is just a story to let you know that god is god is with you god is with you whether you're me or whoever it is god is in your life and he works on your behalf so this was my first contact with witchcraft i guess you know in different countries which craft raises its head here we have something called the obia in in jamaica he's called a shepherd or a captain in haiti he's called a a huguan or onugan and in louisiana he's called a root worker or the conjure man and in trinidad we have the obia man and our landlady saw it fit to seek some extra help to get these tenants out so my seamstress who knew the obia man very well saw her coming out and she's when she went to him and she said what is that lady doing there what did she want she said she wants to get he wants she wants to get her tenants out of the apartment she said what did you tell her what did you tell the lady he said well i told her i can't do anything to those people you see those people they have something around them something protecting them that i just can't touch them at all and my mind was blown i was like oh my god and you know after that my prayer always included thank you lord for your hedge of protection around me father thank you jesus so he does these things to show you that he's with you you're not alone on this journey of life um i saw that um that showed itself up later as well when my husband was um abducted trying to work do extra work to get extra money to look after the family that's his story really but i'll just tell you my part of the story he was abducted by four young men who looked just like men from church normal looking so he didn't know that they were bandits he said they didn't look like like robbers or anything they abducted him took him away and the first thing he told him was i am a christian and i love the lord he threw out his acts he said i'm a christian and i love the lord and that must have given them a joke because later on when they were going to when they were deciding to kill him or not i don't know what happened one of the guys said don't kill him and that must have been around the time and i got up around four o'clock that morning my husband not at home and i'm wondering where is he and i felt that something was wrong something woke me up to pray and i started to pray pray pray pray i don't know what i was praying for prayed for him pray pray pray but it was just about that time when they were deciding should we kill him or not and one of them said no we're not gonna kill him gonna leave him here we're gonna take the car they wanted the car so they took the car and when he came home and he gave me that testimony i said around what time that would have been that that happened he said around 4ish so so god will wake you up to pray he will do things he will speak into your life you have to listen listen to that it speaks to you all the time um moving on quickly the time i lost my job that was an epic experience to me i was promoted from a teacher out in the classroom early childhood facilitator i had my own office i was in charge of the whole of the east and i felt really fine and important i said wow i've arrived you know this is great and one day i sat down early morning in the office and a voice said to me what if you lose that job and i said wow and the thought would not go away so i said lord i don't care i will serve you whether i had a job or not i will serve you whether i have a house or not i will no matter what happens in my life i will serve you anyhow one week later i applied for no feeling one month later i was told i abandoned my job two months later i lost my job and every door seemed to just shut down i went back to the ministry chatted with them nothing to be done one woman told me she said people who do that don't ever get their job back that is it for you i prayed i prayed i went to a bit of deep depression really depressed all the promises i made to god throughout the winter serious depression and praying praying my husband encouraging me standing by my side telling me you know you must be tested you're a christian you're going to be tested you have to go through your test this is your test at the time i didn't see it as a test i said oh god this is so unfortunate why me and then one day i went to church and brother ovid was preaching and he said he gave his experience of being on the job and uh wanting changes and so on things to happen and he realized that he had the wrong attitude and that that made me realize lord you know i don't have the right attitude i'm complaining i'm carrying on and i went home and i prayed right over i prayed i said lord i'm sorry forgive me i know i have the wrong attitude please forgive me i'm gonna start all over again with this like thank you for this test that you're putting me through i see it as a test loan and i accept it and right after that everything changed everything started to change immediately the ministry called me and they say miss o'brien um we have a letter here for you do you know that three years ago you were given a letter to return to it i said what i didn't receive any letter i've been doing all kinds of jobs all over trying this right they said the letter is in your file i said i did not receive it he sent me another turn on the department they worked this out with that all with that out a week a week after that a letter came in the mail please resume duty come to the office and resume beauty and that was it back i went to work my mind was blown so when i went to the bank and i'm trying to initiate my salary and put things in place the bank teller is telling me how come you know doing this um how long you've been a teacher so well i lost my job for seven years and i now got back in and so on so he was like how does that make you feel what did you do how does that make you feel aren't you bitter i said no i'm not bitter i'm better i said i i i gotta pray i got closer to god and i told him all the wonderful things that happened during that time he was amazed he said wait let's go to church yeah i got a chat with sandy granny i gave him the address he said i want to come to that church so i don't think he ever did but he was completed so far away though white diego that's a long distance away but he was amazed at all that that had happened you know so those are just a few things i want to share you know when i i got this um call to do the testimony i i actually started doing it i said um listen i can write a book and i started thinking about all the things i've been trying to say this could fit our entire whole book but i won't do the book tonight i'll end right here on those high points and i want to thank god for the god-given trials that he has given me and for seeing me true when i reflect upon my life and all that i've been through and achieved all of that i've achieved will mean nothing at the end of the road if i don't have the baptism of the holy ghost and fire when i'm called upon to give an account as isaac was preaching in the messenger he said you know we have to give an account i will need to present that token and i am pressing on pressing on to receive the full baptism of the holy ghost on fire fell from fated charity the life of christ in me i pledge to do that it's not over my journey is not over i thank you for listening thank you for having patience with me tonight i trust that it will bless someone bless somebody's heart and encourage somebody's soul

least 17 18 years old now i used to watch the hills and tom stayed along in woodbrook and watch up to the hills and wonder what is beyond those hills and what is in the sky and where is this god and you know like where would i go in my life not having my subjects and all this thing and just keep thinking thinking and um just so i started to read the whole bible i found and started getting into proverbs and things that had moved me and shaped me and then eventually one day i met a guy who said um as brother robert robert who said um you know god sent up he got a message i say no he's early messages god sent a prophet i say what prophet you say yes look a book here and saturday and so on and i got enthused into it and kept following and kept following that was about 19 1972 and i kept falling and joined many churches was in and out and in an alternative till i reached a high place in a big church so to speak and um but i wasn't satisfied that i knew my life wasn't changed i was i was reformed but i wasn't changed i was reforming rituals and wearing right clothes and no doing don't smoke don't do this to do that but i wasn't i didn't reach the peak that i thought i would have reached and um eventually things happened that i went the wrong way temptation and um the people there weren't able to help me to get out of what i was in and i sit down here listen to all these other preaching and teachings and um not being able to get out i want to get out like i've been in a hole in something and i can't reach the way i want to reach and i decided um this after 20 years following this message you decided um i going back anyway let's see if i'm gonna go let go go find me and i left we went back in the world and did all i shouldn't do but i kept saying god will find me and if i my son like god god will come for me and strange enough in um 1920 12 i believe it was yeah 2012 i got a phone call from a minister brother to you of it say now i'm having three nights meeting and i want you to come three days meeting it was uh i think it was independence i believe it was a friday saturday sunday so i said i'd come the friday i didn't go this saturday i didn't go and saturday night i said listen you thought you might come the coming you better find yourself there you know so i found myself in headstone on that sunday morning and when i came in to hit soon i just felt like something that's like someone something that's in in and we looked me in and said welcome you reach home and i've been there for the past nine years and everything in my life all the wrongs all the questions everything just melt and i believe that i got grounded into a fellowship with the lord jesus christ and um i get rooted but well what i did i did so the very children say it's hard but i don't live with it no problem the grace of god is there to support me and um i'm striving i'm coming along um i know a lot of things i i've been a place where you know i mysteriously sort of speak not not for what not wanting to speak i said i was in a mysterious place and while he was preaching sometimes god had a man backslide of to be phoned and um i i i am i am i am totally convinced i am totally settled i'm looking for the supernatural the one of the scriptures that started me from even before i came into the message was the lord jesus christ said peter said repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost i was a roman catholic but i can't get this holy ghost at all because every saturday i go confession sunday take communion and money back in sin so i can't get this one he goes to this whole egos is always something that i want to get what is this holy ghost and this after in this point in time i am still striving looking and i know by little things that happen within me and i know that god is just watching over me that i'm in the arms awkward jump high exam blue how many arms are good and god has been blessing providing a given or taken you know life is sweet and um i enjoy the lord jesus christ in every way and like i was telling somebody i do have to go hollywood to see no movie i pick up my bible you read about jacob read about this one read about that one he picked his events in life creed but noah you know yeah and all kinds of things you know men like judah and what they do and what they know and this and that and i say man you know i was in hollywood now all my intrigue is in the bible you know and that's my joy the will of god and um this is not my simple testimony just me punch and shoot so bless hope it will be a blessing i know there too you know but it's the grace of god for my life that knowing i could i used to sit down in bars and see people going to church and tell people i'm going to treat when i did this again you know i just take in the spirit yeah but it is wrong spirit i going back look at the right spirit and you know that's that's all my life so peace and love i enjoy the lord jesus i enjoy the fellowship i enjoy the virgin you have to live you have to prove that your fruit is good and you know be uh make uh what i say multiply and you know and break one more fruit record the lord want something from your life try your best and make it every day you're conscious that you know what you're called to do and try to speak because i have a lot of words i like to make a lot of joke i always riddle in something within something but i don't like that danielle because i i don't even have all this guy in me but you know i i changed him i changed it he's a corner ascent because i can't change but i know i changed him so i come in sure right by the years i enjoy the fellowship i don't know we we see members going deaf right and center leaving here going on they just skipped up to the presence i go out and at my age i just had to walk cautiously and pull run and feet and um everything will be all right so this is all i have to present tonight maybe a blessing to you all in jesus name thank you oh praise the lord god bless you by the punch how many appreciable approaches tonight oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you let's let's let go some priests father we bless your name we thank you lord we appreciate you lord we thank you for your love we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy praise the lord you know it's very odd um considerable punch i met brother punch i think maybe 20 something years years ago the service i was in in barataria i met for the punch and something struck me about him i i don't know if we even spoke but i i i know him from i think i met him and somehow it's almost like if you be a witness of somebody be a record of somebody and i always wanted to meet him again and i don't know why so it was at the funeral of my daughter-in-law's mother which is such a great sister arlene at that funeral at mrs 2012 i saw him in the funeral for the first time after so many years and when i saw him i knew i had us to go and stick to him i just knew that i didn't know he was back sitting i didn't know what was his condition and so on i didn't have any idea of him at all i lost track of him for many many years and when i spoke to him and he came that sunday he never misses he never turned back after that and that is the grease and the mercy and the presence and power of god i certainly appreciate him and i invited him to be one of the trustees in the church and he told me you know previously in some other church distrusting his problems because when he you like to stick with the books and whatnot and one time they give an account they want to do things different i said no no no i said we want accountability we want things to be in order and i trust them i said have to feel free and have the liberty to share with us what we need to do and how to do it and so on like that i said um we we here are different you know and um i am so happy and pleased with him he said my brother ovid he said you don't have to worry you'll take care of things and so far he has i certainly appreciate and assume we should give god a good praise offering for brother like brother punch and um you know who have a heart for the things of god and the people of god and reminds me a bit of like oh but a monday we operate but amanda's always having something to do around the church he's painting he's cleaning he's always doing something you love the law you love god's people love to see things in order and we appreciate that so much and i really appreciate the fine people that god choose the cinemath to give us that kind of support and everything else the church is not a one-man show i don't believe in that i i saw how um churches manage how ministers managed over the years and i told god i would not do that i wouldn't um rule these people with rigor you know i would do completely different and um because they controlled people's lives and and manipulate and work on a psychology and i reject all of that i was prepared to reboot my whole thinking and viewing god's people and how the care of god comes down to god's people and realizing that um that i'm just like you um i see myself called to an office and function in that office and because i function at office i have to do certain things preach and so on like that but it's not as if i am up there somewhere in the sky floating like some angel and you all that don dear you know like needed like me to send manna or anything like that no we are all waiting upon the lord we all have that call of god to come to perfection we all have that call of god to be in the upper room and says don't like to talk about it but when they were in the upper room they were all waiting on the holy ghost they were waiting to be placed positionally by god because remember the holy ghost uh the god was above pillar fire and cloud and eureka had it when the club began to move you have to move when the pillar fire began to move you had to move you guys say well you know i mean i can't feel the move no you know no no you move by the cloud you move by the pillar of fire and that pillar fan club became into a man a pillar of fire took flesh on it and that was jesus christ when he came he said i am with you but the comforter whom the father will send he is going to be in you another comforter you call him another comforter and he call it also the spirit of truth not truth not just truth but the spirit of truth i like what elisa says she had a but she wanted to get this heart experience and that is where the spirit of truth comes not just truth so when brother byron said out of a true seed of the word called to present christ with a beloved bride it means that it had people with false seed but written true seed now you get christ bride being hewn out from the cloth of the world so we are not here just to say we have a church over here in church we are here to actually become the word so that is very important that you seek to know what god has said i like just identify this way you seek to know the prophet's prophecy life here people talk about brother branham talk about he went up in your canyon and they know all his life and when he went here and there in chicago and this and that what i want to know is what did he prophesy what is to be here you see and when you see what is prophesied then you could hold on to the prophecy of the lord god said lord to your life so this is what it's all about so i really thank god for a punch and i know every one of you tonight uh have a testimony every one of you tonight have something that you could share and that is so great i remember myself coming to the lord and strange enough she called his name ricardo brandon carol brambles elisha he was about two years or three years higher than me and since even scholarly princess strong where i went to school and he gave me a book spoke my book and i never take mine to it i think i slept on the bed never read it and um he was a great testifier and so on know he passed and um one day i was a catholic myself i got invited by while berlin brother prince long san fernando was obliquely opposite our house in salt and he invited me to listen to tape i believe the tape was etude excellence and when i listened to that tape i mean i was here but around voice something struck me and he just asked me do you believe that that this is god's prophet and i just say yes i just received it the very first city that i heard and then he gave me a message a book and when he gave me this spoken word book i said but i have one like this under my bed home and when i look was another message i was there and i remember telling my parents that i want to go and get baptized i want to go and save the lord and my parents i got rebuked um then i catholic the whole family is catholic i got rebuked and i remember that night i cried i cried and i said lord you will bring me back to this someday so i cannot leave it alone i remember 1974 walking in south and under bypass and i said god i said i don't know you please please could you reveal yourself to me this coming year i was 1974 i was 17 years old i was a young man hungry and twisted after righteousness and it was an incredible twist a twisting for god and it so happened that um all the family of course my older brothers and sisters went to college and then went further education and i choose a little different part i um after getting my subjects i i really wanted to be a medical doctor because i always felt i wanted to help humanity not even knowing that go to bring me into the ministry to minister to people and um of course we didn't have the money to pursue um medical stuff so what i did i switched to what you call um electrical engineering technician to do electrical engineering thing like that so i went john the imported space i was to leave san fernando and go to porter spin and um it was god's plan to get me away from family so when i went up to porter spain i saved my message some maureen i know she's deceased now she got baptized and stood a lot and i went and stayed there i used to walk from deer to school and i was at maybe about a hour and a half i'm passing through with foot square with a famous square that square where everybody preaching everybody saying something i met a brother named brother phipps michael phipps and he was preaching and preaching they come and listen to him so when i went home or coming back and seeing and i i had one question because i read about i read about somebody who said in a life past they they um it was in some village in india and under the under the dead have a goal only that boys have gold and when they went and checked this place and the family never went there before and they went to dig they got gold there and so on like that tonight that used doesn't bother me that maybe there's a life beyond this and kind of reincarnation stuff so i asked him one question about that and he just say familiar spirits and when he said that that was the key i understood it right away it's not the person coming back when the person was there before it's familiar spirits of the person and that's in the bible but family spirit so after that they got baptized and begin to serve the lord and um you know it was really something else i had my first experience with god um in my sister's home i closed it don't begin to pray and seek the lord and that pillar light flash that that that was my first encounter with god when i got an encounter with god like a presence was it come to my heart and life and it brought discipline and i couldn't see a word about it i knew i had a gift and i couldn't say a word about it and it was like that you know and and and god sometimes i might fill in the gaps for you and and share some more and and lord began to lead me then and brother coleman came and trained at 1974 and 75. i wasn't different from before but i was then meeting for 75. i heard him preach promises preach from the prophet's message and prophesy and and the church i was in i asked them would you really preach what that man created for him that man brother said i have to check but i believe paul i said but what he was saying what the brother brahman says would you preach what you want to preach what he was preaching for the bride he said no and i left seventeen year old with a bag over my shoulder student and i walked out of a church because i wanted what that man was preaching i was hearing promises for the bride seventh understand the bride sometimes they bright revival i was hearing things for the bride and i believe i am part of that bride so i don't want people to find me i want to hear brighter promises so i went from church to church you know and looking to see who is the preaching closest to these brother promises eventually you know i got settled in and then afterwards the whole ministry of that pastor fall apart and eventually i got to kaiwea and um michael mcmahon he was instrumental in that he was starting a group in a country there it was gaslamp it was tauting water from the well it was rugged and so on i remember by the george kangli a day coming from belmont to taiwa and i came and three people was upstairs in the house but george tell me um why are you wasting your time coming from so far to preach to three people and my answer to him was when you repent god will forgive you well he repented afterwards but it wasn't about the three people it was about the training and um that was a wilderness experience that was a dry experience a hard experience but it was you can't get fame up there you can't get popularity you can't get it wasn't anything like that at all it was just loving the lord i remember a service and just recently i spoke about the jericho he's in canada he came up he came up to preach up there and and when he was there after his service he was amazed a few people and everything else and the anointing that was jerome and he says god gonna bless you and he used these words because he who is faithful and little shall be faithful and much i was reminding him of that and i never forgot that and that is why you hear me talk about being faithful faithful to little and if god bless you and you take what god bless you and thank him for it and bless him for it he could he could actually take care of him and we use our prayer meetings all night prime meetings and so on one night i remember i saw a vision first vision like a she dropped down and i saw the second coming of the lord and that was like a vision and i wanted to know where i find that and i got the book called the second coming of the lord preached my brother branham and i began to read that book when i came to the spot where it says when the church finds his bloody love when the church finds his whole religion see when the truth finds peace in christ it will cause the other members of the body come rejoice with us and when i hit there and struck there like an anointing came and i said church this has to be revealed got a long story short in 1981 a revolutionary kindness truck called a group particular group up there and the spirit poured out and i never saw that before i come from catholics so we don't know about not pointing a spirit catholic sit down on the priests you know you know stuff but the spirit poured out and was like a shocking thing it's just like a gusher yes about about 12 people one and then we begin to testify and go different places and testify about it and when we speak the holy spirit will pour up now i at that time never really connected broadly kindness for the holy spirit at that time it was just like many churches is brought in love who doesn't see and i'm seeing god confirm the word by sending on the spirit and eventually i traveled to new york and then brother mark introduced me to barack obama and i said his brother i have a testimony of our nation very kindness and then he said that you know he never heard anybody talk about bernie kennedy since then even before when he got revelation about terrorists and this was seven years later so then we talk and we fellowship and that is how we got connected by this revelation of brethren about it and like needed to in penn harris and um what i didn't know later in the years what brother common told me is that when i was walking towards him the holy spirit told him join yourself to that man so i don't understand that that's his testimony and later on in the years said holy spirit told him put brother over in the convention because i have a work for him to do put him and train him that's how i end up in you know the child with new york and something like that went up there by revelation with revelation and still blessed by revelation up there i saw the good the bad and ugly i learned from the good i shunned it bad and i didn't mess with you but that is life and uh you know and i'm still standing today still blessed by the experience of things that were shared because you see a lot of things are not taught a lot of things are caught you know we share we talk and you catch something not teach teach teach teach teach so sometimes you just have to be ourselves be authentic be original be real and share our own testament you know and over the years i try to you know stick close as possible with what the prophet says see what the deep sea and i wanted to be so close that even if i am not quoting what i'm seeing i could find it back in the message because i always wanted to be a preacher that nobody could challenge on the word and i have never had a service where somebody come and say what do you mean when you say so answer because i know what you mean i say what is to be said and once it is spoken you can find it back that's very important because you must be able to examine what is spoken from behind improvement so it's not just i'm saying this and you believe me and what nothing you know and then like you know people like to say um problem says how you said um if you get the people that believe you're not even cancer we sign your way and men take that i'm no prophet right that's how men have all the answers i don't i will share with you what i i know sometimes i tell people that above my pay grade let me find help somewhere else okay so i don't have all the answers and i think two answers are back there was a message that was spoken through wednesday night and brahman says if you find someone who have all the answers you know that is something wrong with that because god doesn't show his servants everything could we give the lord a hand to praise god just does not show his servants everything so we have to work with what god a lot to us what god give to us that's what we have to work with and i remember when we went we were doing enterprise and the first time i saw sister ann marie somebody invited her and that is why you should invite people to keep on inviting people even to the testimony of bible study first time i saw anyway it's totally pastor there's something about that sister that i like and um i never already talked to her it was just something that registers and i want you to get this it's just something that clicks so and those days brothers were very serious very very sweet and i was very serious very serious there was no smiles nothing like that and one day somebody said something and i laughed and smiled and she reacted and said i never know you could smile and guess what i've been smiling since so um you know it's quite a great experience and you know god bless us with three sons and now we have um isaac gideon and andrew are no you know we know we don't have tree anymore we multiplied in that time of daughter-in-law's grandchildren and so on and you see the hand of god i wish i could talk to more young people to tell them the joy of serving the lord the joy of being tested i remember when i was going to john donaldson how somebody was blasting me from barbarian and when i go to testify about brother branham i started stutter at the woodstock county mother we break the man say look look look at him he he falls he kind of can't come with his mouth like a talk and everybody are wrong a whole crowd around it would have been embarrassing but i was prepared to have the reproach of the world in those days you understood what it had was to be report of the world because like everybody's profit no profit is profiting in those days once you say profit somebody say false prophecy last days they have a rise false prophet no different ones are prophets and so on but in those days you couldn't talk prophet talking much but it was real and um i want to encourage you tonight ask god to create a new hungering and twisting it is something that gives you strength it's something that keeps you alive i remember only lord who come to me um about money woman and popularity treat things that is wipe out a man and i ask god to protect me from these things and when i was scared of its popularity i was very concerned about it and the lord show me how to manage that and you know along the way what teach you like i shared that already on my job people don't respect you for what you get into people respect you for what you stand for it was an experience i went through to learn that because you want to give in to people you want to be nice you want to be fine you want to represent but then god doesn't want you to be a discharge god doesn't want people to walk over you so you have to put down your foot sometimes and say no that's not i'm not going to do that i'm not gonna operate this way and when you do that yeah people might pull back but at the end of the day you're gonna respect what you stand for and that is very very important you know like one experience a man a boss i had and he was kind of smart man my lord show me he said when you're looking at a snake don't rush it watch how that snake is moving and then you time it and then you take it and cut his head off you wouldn't find it in a book but that is the experience that i got because the man was very crafty he's a boss he's up dear but he's very slippery and eventually he got nailed you see and that never what happened in that whole experience never happened before but it did just like he said elisha people said that um you never you're not going to get back at work you're not going to get back your job and i had experiences where i recognized was bad attitude and i had to repent to god and say lord this is not it and when i repent adjust my attitude everything fall in line i remember last thing i'll say i didn't mean to say no this tonight but it was it was really nice being here and being able to share um it when i came to the lord i was going in the wrong direction with my family i was telling my question a prophet and this and that and one day my sister said you are so hard nobody could talk to you and then i said i'm so sorry please forgive me and when i said that like something just jumped over her i didn't realize that i was going the wrong direction i hope you catch this tonight that you could actually be serving god standing for the lord and going in the wrong direction thinking that you're right you're almost like you get that self righteous that the knowledge that you have and your family don't have and you want to point in on them and they are not ready yet to receive it look what happened over the years but a terry i remember dropping a book for him he was second hospital and he does i just felt like economist for one book and when i came back to visit him a couple of days afterwards he testified to me gross and a prophet remember terry got baptized and then my sister lystra she got baptized then maureen she got baptized and then my mother she got baptized and i'm grateful to go on you know for god could come around and the same family that was so strongly catholic god could make them see the light so this time i trust them that this would be encouraging to you i know i mentioned something um about evangelism and i want to encourage you invite people up not just a service but to listen to the network service so coming to the bible studies invite share your testimony um what a blessing it was tonight to hear these two brethren testifying by the point you see him in no comfortable operation he had one eye operation another either very highly of messiah he's he's recovering right now but he was still willing to give his amazing testament and i just thank god for his love his leadership his guidance i thank god for you all here tonight so let's borrow our heads as you want to close and i would i pray heavenly father we thank you tonight for the liberty of the spirit that we feel oh god your spirit is you the unction is from you father i pray tonight that light will shine and the lives of those guarded here if anyone in darkness may they come to the light if anyone bomb are you afraid anyone secure me you heal them anyone backs in me restore it oh god when amber a black man spoke about it about the god of the impossible that dustings are so unexpected like a paradox incredible but true tonight lord we just thank you thank you for your grace thank you for your love thank you for the intestines and trial father we don't want to be backslidden we don't want to be no glory and no testimony we want iran to talk about if we don't testify we find ourselves back to the sunday father may this a little meeting tonight be something that would steal your people to be witnesses of you witnesses to share their own story of your love of the grace of your mercy granted father bless the service on sunday may your power come down may your spirit fall freely bless your servant lord and anoint him in a special way that spirit spoken word will go forth in the name of jesus we ask it amen and amen god be with you thank you again for being here with us and have a wonderful evening god you
