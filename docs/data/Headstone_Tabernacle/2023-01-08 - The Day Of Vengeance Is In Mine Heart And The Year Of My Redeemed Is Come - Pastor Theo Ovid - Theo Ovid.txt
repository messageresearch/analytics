Jesus my mind my tongue speak what you want spoken and Lord may your circumcised to hear us that they could receive your word granted Father and Jesus might ask it amen God bless you and welcome if in the Bible I'd like to turn to three portions of scripture ex Isaiah chapter 63 verse 4. Exodus chapter 14 verse 13 to 20 and Romans 8 1-2 reading from Isaiah 63 verse okay it's uh 63 verse 4. 63 verse 4 for the day of vengeance is in my heart on the year of my redeemed is come and Exodus chapter 14 verse 13 and Moses said unto the people fear not fear ye not stand still I see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you he shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ down unto me speak under the general Israel that they go forward but lift up thou thy bread and turtle thy hand over the sea and divided and eternal Israel shall go on dry ground to the midst of the sea and I behold I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them and I will get me on upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts upon his chariots upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have cut me honor upon Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel it was a cloud on Darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night Allah scripture from Romans chapter 8 verse 1 and 2. there's definitely no no condemnation to them which in Christ Jesus who worked not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death may God bless us what you may be seated praise God thanks so much for being here this evening praise God's have a title the day of vengeance is in my heart and the year of my redeemed is come and have an inspiration Redemption by power okay so it's very interesting how Isaiah capture all these things about the day of vengeance and description now identify not only vengeance is in his heart God but that the year already my redeemed has come so God has designed a particular time and season for his redeemed his people that he called to bring to Redemption now we're not talking about salvation no we're talking about Redemption a Redemption means Faith virtue all these virtues coming into you that is when you're fully redeemed redeem is to bring it back where I was before and before we fell and God wanted being a restoration because we as man was back there in represented by Adam so God has to bring us back that complete Redemption our Redemption is in two parts Redemption is by Blood and also by power Redemption is also coming in and going out coming going out um Redemption of two parts it's out of and going into now many of you like just a matter of the scripture you talk about Ephesians and Redemption as two different parts coming out of and entering into first you have to come up some people want to bring the world in with them but you got to come out of the world to enter into Christ you have to come out of unbelief to enter into fate they cannot be wanting in your way to really have genuine Faith you must absolutely leave everything that is contrary to the word of God so you come like a clinging to the word of God not even your feelings not even your emotions not even your past you're clinging to God's word there are some people still stuck in a rut by their history by their environment by their home by what happened to them when there was a child and you're still wallowing inside the deer you have to kick all them things away and say God your word is true you can't lie I've been through them things but that can't bring me to where I'm supposed to be no the only way I can activate what God wants for me now is to receive his word and this is a trust will help you today what about a reader he said we cannot base salvation upon prayer as good as it may be we cannot base salvation on prayer for if that be so the Muhammad the muhammadins are saved the Buddhists are saved the hidden are saved so it cannot be based on prayer neither can it be based upon experience salvation is not based on experience because people can have any kind of experience the muhammadans have experiences the Buddhists have an experience every different religion have experiences and neither can salvation be based upon fasting prayer experiences sensation or sincerity many people say well it doesn't make a difference just what I believe as long as I'm sincere in what I believe well if that be so the is saved the Buddhist is saved all the rest of them the heedness saved for I say that they can outshine us any day when they come to prayer and fasting Sensations and so forth they cannot shine us and salvation doesn't pertain or is not based upon the other things but the word of God God said so salvation is strictly upon God said so God said so feeling on her feeling prayer or no prayer whatever is God has done it it's nothing you could have done salvation is a rook wrought by God could we give God some prisons hallelujah salvation can be based upon any church any Creed nothing but the word of God it is God's word God's word is so perfect not one iota it ever will fail all heaven will fail Earth will fail praise God John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth I want you to notice in technique how infallible the word of God is when the two T's and Jesus was dying on the crosses together they took Hammers and broke the teeth leg perhaps maybe the man who had the hammer had already drawn back the hammer to break the legs of the Lord Jesus so that they could get away over the Sabbath but before the hammer could ever strike the legs of the Lord Jesus his word must be fulfilled there wasn't a bone in his body to be broken because the Bible said that one bone could be broken because the law is when they when they kill you and crucify you they break your bones but the word say not one of his bones will be broken isn't that right Hallelujah before the hammer could strike his legs a Roman spear hit his body hit his side and blood and water came forth they pierced my hands and my side all the word of God has got to be fulfilled every word so the reason I like to get people I know I'm going to have to answer before in the day of judgment based not upon my own thoughts based upon my own Doctrine I want their soul experience based on the word of God so it will stand because I knowing that great day we're gonna have to answer for everything so our hope is built on nothing less but Jesus Christ and his righteousness I dare not trust in a sweetest frame but I holy lean on Jesus name Oh Glory to God be arrested on that Solid Rock word no devil could move them from there he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell can never Prevail against it so once God puts you on a rock of Revelation there is enough devils in hell to shake you over that no trial no testing no pandemic praise God hallelujah nothing present nothing to come to separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus hallelujah praise God bring it on devil Oh Glory to God hallelujah Bring It On God said so Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the case of heaven will never be real against it Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God God can't give you power until you are tested Give the Lord a shout on that I want to say it again God cannot give you a power until you are tested so when Jesus got the Holy Ghost he went to the Wilderness to be tested by that devil but when he came to the test it is written it is written it is also written when he came to the test he returned in the power of the spirit will give the Lord a shout that's how Jesus did it he returned in the power of the spirit oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah please tell inspired we're still anointed Hallelujah glory to God you may be seated but before Jesus could start his ministry before Jesus will get them Motors humming he had to go into the temple to find a place where it is written the spirit is now upon me they thought he was reading scripture that day but it was literally happening to him he had the spirit upon him they couldn't see it they couldn't touch it they couldn't feel it they didn't know it but it was there anyhow and one of these days that same Spirit oh God the world can't see it but people can't see it but are gonna be upon you oh Hallelujah the spirit of God is upon me because he had anointed me you have to be anointed for purpose you have to be at whatever power you have to be placed for power or glory to God but you have to find the scripture to declare the acceptable year of the Lord all glory to God unto the Heavenly of Vengeance and today we have two packs of Glory to God tendencies in my heart but I hear the redeem Has Come Oh Glory that God for Glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah my cold water opening service for the year right oh Glory the court vengeance is in my heart but I hear of thy redeemed my redeemed for Glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God Hallelujah you may be seated so what did Jesus do there he came to the temple to identify the season and time and then he said this day the scriptures fulfilled nothing happened yet and all them men have dead in me message at that time they fulfilled with me my death on the true remote he rejected Stone and he just started to let that devil know who he is oh Hallelujah all the time if don't be if don't be if don't be he's ain't telling nothing I ain't shown you anything and when he does step out and reject it after he identified by the season and time what the season was he was ready for his ministry and now we have two scriptures not only look for the Avengers of our god what we have revelation 22 17 the spirit and the pride how could the bride have the spirit how could the bride get unless the season of the spirit time come how could the bride move into the spirit and the bride except Dynamics come we can't come and talk this mechanics it has to be the spirit itself not Luther not Wesley not Pentecost the spirit itself Christ all anointed okay the Lord a shout oh help me here am I gonna feel charged I feel like I'm fresh I feel like I'm not starting this night oh glory to God I have a super anointing here Glory that God preach this morning come back this evening or glory of God because spirit is here to anoint you Oh Glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah today for the pride I have to step out and begin to attend their life and declare her season and walk into it oh my hallelujah what what we talk about before sometimes that the bride have what the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word what to do with the word to make a jubilee what to do with the word make a Revival he said what we see should make a church that will make a Revival The Pride will have the mind of Christ not sit down in self-pity not say no wallowing in your human spirit and your filthy stinking flesh not sitting on in that but rise up and let the weak say I am strong rise up I'm shaking your fever leaves rise up you are Sons and Daughters of the Living God [Applause] you're not a Mystic you're not a mishap you know the accident God ordain you and call you for this hour Oh Glory to God you may be seated [Applause] we are leaving here the prophet called it Exodus but the first Exodus they have to redeem my blood Oh Glory to God because judgment was set it was fixed and God told him take a lamb and take the blood and apply it and when I see the blood I'm gonna pass over you I will pass through the land of Egypt this night I will Smite all the first born in land of Egypt but man and peace against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord but the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt oh give the Lord some Praises what a time What atmosphere 400 years abundance all of a sudden prophecy step forward in the former Moses with a mighty hand I would deliver my people here come Moses and the people standing alone here come judgment and the people stand the land but they had to get out but first was the blood the blood had to be applied Oh Glory to God and caught in a blood message seven Thunders is the blood message had to be applied see it got to be applied virtue have to be applied knowledge have to be applied but now is not the blood it's the spirit or glory of God we've got to abide the spirit because the spirit has to come on display not too close not a tie not the church not the pastor you have to get the spirit and it has to be on display Glory [Applause] Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God before we get the Redemption by power you have to get Redeemed by Blood redeem our love to Proclaim it Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Redeemed by to his infinite Mercy his challenge forever I am I am redeemed Redeemed by the blood people don't like to talk about too much of blood into Pentecostals Hallelujah to buy Bless but we believe in the blood There Is Power in the Blood oh one the work and Power in the Blood praise God on Friday night brother Kelly saw testimony he said when God show him the blood is still covering him oh well he was in a low condition but the blood was still covering him yes that blood shall cover you because you're not even seeing your sin if you die in your sin you go to hell you go and you get exposed but when you're under that blood that blood covering the world here that God giving you an opportunity he came to seek to save the Lost he came to redeem your their condition to redeem you of your situation God Don't Make halfway Christians but Christians can be halfway God make whole complete Christians he wanted to be a genuine grumpy Christian he wanted to be a genuine son a genuine daughter okay the Lord some shout not so message church member or give the Lord a shout in the house [Music] hold it before the plagues when the plates Begin to Fall God called Israel devotion and Goshen they're applying the blood no better striking down there here we go are you ready the last plague that struck the it was dead all your Bible's readers here know your Sunday school lessons but that was the last enemies from Egypt I'm The Last Enemy that's going to strike the church now is dead spiritually speaking people in the message on the Dead pastor's death Elders dead Deacon's dead to his members dead and you know what sad they don't even know the Dead the only thing they're in the message oh God help Mercy have mercy Jesus the church is blacked out the church is in darkness the church has no light because they rejected the Messiah they rejected the anointed they rejected the Holy Ghost they rejected the baptism they rejected the fire of God to the church itself is dead and God for Mercy thank God for his grace thank God for his blessing thank God for his pregnant power that is here this evening okay the Lord some praises foreign they never knew it oh God they never know it they never get in contact with it so they wouldn't even miss it they're going down to the tribulation but the books and tapes going down to the tribulation with nice Bibles with the nice preacher that they love they're going down there and God to the prophet Salman Tabernacle you got to display the token he end up talking about apply he went past apply he said God to be on display that's what God had in that time when I see the blood like when you pass I see anything or some Bishop see anything God must see those virtues faster than us okay the Lord a shout you have no time to gossip you have no time to play the fool you have no time to run around you have time to apply the blood because the day of sentences in my heart her glory to God that day is coming foreign [Music] he died foreign [Music] night time nobody playing no disco no DJ it's a black Miss Hallelujah no rap no dub no funny music playing no loud

Enemy that struck Egypt The Last Enemy that's going to strive to change his death spiritually speaking those who will not follow Christ in the baptism of the Holy Spirit Will spiritually dry up and die that word reeling in those who will not follow Christ in the baptism of the Holy Spirit Will spiritually dry up and die let the message world fight up with that because that is the truth it has to follow with the Holy Ghost it has to follow with the fire of God and no man can give you the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a promise from God you've got to know it's for you you've got to know what it is you continuous given for you you've got to know the results that bring then you will know you have it when you get it or give the Lord a shout in the house this is a promise of unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as a lot of a culture call it still applies Peter had the key and when Peter unlocked the door he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall child receive the gift of the Holy Ghost doctor change that not changing God does not change Hallelujah and if God sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers the same message preacher preached we're gonna preach you because Paul preacher too Paul say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you have something to get if you get it to go to the gate if there's something to receive that there's something to press forward too could we give the lawyers to pray please offering foreign you can see it now after many many great revivers and evangelists has passed through the land at a Church's politically Church speaking is getting worse all the time as members are living any way they want to doing anything they want yet policy of Christians and say they're all right to be a Christian I believe the message you know who are haters who are evil who are wicked who are jealous who are envious understanding message they're not Christians you're hitting it hard not me this is the word Christian has to be christ-like how you want to avenge yourself and that is like or you want to get even that Christ's like you can't shake your brother hand I cry fake you're crossing the street when they see somebody else like you're pushing a hard face and then cut high and bad eye you're evil eye your blood yeah take this one

Fellowship one with another the blood of Jesus Christ godson cleanses us from all unrighteousness amen hallelujah glory to God the last thing was debt and before that dead come you had to be atonement

it was fenced around he said I give it to you it is yours and that's what God has did today he'd give everyone of you that wants it the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you got to go in and possess it first you have to want it you have to know it's given for you you have to know that some preacher out smack you and say the baptism without sensation Army and he don't even know what you're talking

condemn a lady who was there who works with some men drinking and carrying on he said I study I thought oh God how can you style it how can you look at such a stat when even in my heart I'm as bad as I am yet I won't let my little serum Rebecca will have to raise up in such a generation to see the coming Lord why won't you do it Lord why don't you just wipe it off the face of this it I sat down there started to weep I saw a vision I saw as it was the world whirling around the air undested a rainbow around the world and someone was speaking to me said that's the blood of Jesus Christ around this world that keeps him from destroying it if God can see sin the day you eat there of that day you die every man under the blood there's a free moral agent to make your choice but if you ever die your soul soil is beyond the mercy of that blood you're already judged before you get there there's nothing left for you then I see myself I see my Lord Jesus standing there with a crown of thorns on his head the tears running down mix up with blood as it washed off his beard I see my sins coming before him and every time they would come before him still he was shaking the Thorns with sticking his voice more he would stagger back so he's describing as if the sins his sins hitting Jesus and as it hit him the Thorns just just penetrate more he said father forgive him he know not what he's doing and again I would do something then his blood was like a bump on a car protecting the car shivering me from the wrath of God on this event I come to him slowly not down to him I looked down lean in front of me there was an old book of sin and my name wrote across the top I said Lord will you forgive me certainly he said with loving eyes reached his side got some blood out and wrote in it pardon included back in the sea of forgetfulness I said Thank You Lord listen to these words now he said no I forgive you and you are condemning her he said that changed the picture for me I come out of it I walk over there and sat down to her I began to talk she's had some rough life back before her I said was you never a Christian she said I was raising a Christian home I said what happened she told me about the mystery with the husband and how the children and so forth and all these years you'll never live a peaceful since you met God she said say that's the truth I said won't you receive him right now she said will he hear me I said he's knocking at your heart now and out of that put deer on the floor knelt down before the audience of people slot machine stopped vulgar cursing stopped and everything else I lifted up my hands and then poor wrinkled hands led her to Jesus Christ friends I don't care what you have done how black your sins are how smart your life is God Is Standing tonight knocking at your heart's door to forgive you no matter who you are [Music] that's it that's it in the Old Testament if a man lost his inheritance and squatter come on his land he could not hold it any longer from the owner until 50 years and after 50 years the tree of Jubilee came by and the Year of Jubilee is when the Year of Jubilee come along everything went back to the original beginning again all slaves they went back if a man was holding in the field and the trumpet song that he heard it he chewed on his whole I'm no more a slave I can go back to my home and family everything was given back if my squatter was on the ground he had to get off the ground you have to go off the ground because the legal owner was coming back and Hallelujah one of these days the kingdom of this world will fall and the legal owners will come back one of these days Glory they're going to win Christ went to Calvary there was 40 days into the Ascension it was a debate whether Satan's group could take it and say he did not raise from the dead they begin to start a proclamation it's his disciples stolen from the night his people come and stole him but on the 50th day was the day of Pentecost and the legal owner come down from among them and sure it was no organization it was a feeling of the Holy Ghost that was God's anus for his church to be controlled not by organization and so forth oh give the Lord some Praises at the end of the 50th day there was no more dispute Oh Glory to God instead to go with the old Orthodox difficult church God sent the Holy Ghost back and run all the squatters out all them no praise demons gets run out all them dead certain church members get run out and only church and fire isn't that right it's the power the Holy Ghost had come down no Brethren not to hurt their feelings he said the earnest of our Salvation is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without any organization and I'm gonna close with this oh my Hallelujah the 50th year was the day of Jubilee and the power of God was taken back to his original the 50th day the Year of Jubilee is when all things went back and there will come another year of Jubilee or give the Lord I shout what kind of time
