[8:19] Psalms chapter 126 for a scripture
[8:23] reading this morning. Praise God. Before

[8:29] Thank you, Jesus. Psalms chapter 126
[8:32] says, "When the Lord turned again the
[8:33] captivity of Zion, we were like them
[8:37] that dream." Then was our mouth filled
[8:40] with laughter and our tongue with
[8:42] singing. They said, "Then they said, uh,
[8:46] then then said they, sorry, among the
[8:47] heathen, the Lord had done great things
[8:50] for them. The Lord had done great things
[8:53] for us, whereof we are glad. Turn again
[8:58] our captivity, O Lord, as the streams of
[9:02] the south. For they that sew in tears
[9:05] shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth
[9:09] and weepeth, bearing precious seed shall
[9:12] doubtless come again rejoicing, bringing
[9:15] his sheav with him. May God add blessing
[9:18] to the reading of his word. Let's bow
[9:20] our heads and pray. Almighty God, we are
[9:24] grateful to be in your house this
[9:26] morning. We thankful for your presence,
[9:28] Lord, Father, that has been here. Lord,
[9:31] though, amidst the challenges and the
[9:33] trials coming into your house this
[9:35] morning, we thank you, Lord, that you
[9:37] give us a grace to be here this morning,
[9:39] Lord. Lord, we come through all the
[9:41] traffic and everything else, Father.
[9:43] Lord, we are greatly humbled by you this
[9:46] morning, Father, that you would call us,
[9:48] Lord, that you would choose us, Father.
[9:50] And Lord, I was glad when they said unto
[9:52] me, "Let us go into the house of the
[9:55] Lord." We're here to praise you this
[9:57] morning. We're here to worship you.
[9:59] We're here to lift you up on high. We're
[10:02] here to make your praise glorious this
[10:04] morning and to get into the presence of
[10:07] God because we believe with all our
[10:09] hearts, Lord, that you are worthy to be
[10:11] praised. And there's something good in
[10:13] store for us this morning for they that
[10:15] wait upon you this morning. Hide us in

[37:44] There are troubles, trials, test,
[37:47] tribulation, all manner of opposition,
[37:52] issues,
[37:53] but it's something to come to a spot
[37:55] where you can say, "It is well
[37:57] &gt;&gt; with my soul."
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here this morning.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; It's always good to be in the presence
[38:05] of God.
[38:07] It is something we we fight for, we
[38:10] battle for, we worship for, we sing for
[38:12] &gt;&gt; to be in God's presence.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Waste of time if we just gather just to
[38:16] just intellectual like if it's a
[38:18] Catholic or Jehovah witness or just some
[38:21] club is waste of time
[38:22] &gt;&gt; if we not in the spirit. Waste of time.
[38:24] There's no revelation. There's no
[38:26] uncction. There's no inspiration. He
[38:27] said that is what the Holy Ghost is
[38:29] given for.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; It's to give uncction to the preacher.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; It's to bring holiness to the group.
[38:34] Yeah.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Is to set the church in order.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is for. Not
[38:38] just yapping, yapping, yapping, talking,
[38:40] talking, talking. No, but to get
[38:41] something moving
[38:42] &gt;&gt; because he promised to come among us.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; I am not him. He promised to come among
[38:47] us.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; And he said, and then you are worshiping
[38:50] the living Christ.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Him moving in and out. That mean he
[38:54] could move in this morning.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; And if you move in this morning, your
[38:59] worship shows whether you have
[39:01] revelation or not. Your worship shows
[39:03] whether you see your name on the book or
[39:05] not.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Just a message
[39:08] believer. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you
[39:11] see your name, something happens. If you
[39:13] see your name, you have to do like John.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; If you see your name, you have to
[39:16] worship. You have to give God praises
[39:18] and honor.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:22] Glory.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Be seated. And
[39:26] worship have nothing to do with you

[39:43] praises.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; We are not. We We seeking a city whose
[39:47] maker and builder is God.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; We on our way to get out of here. I am
[39:51] journeying. I pick up a wife. I was

[40:03] &gt;&gt; Let me read the scripture before we get
[40:05] in some of this. But let's stand. You
[40:06] want to read Joel chapter 1 1-4. Joel
[40:09] chapter 22 23-29.
[40:11] This anointing inside of here. I believe
[40:13] that God going to break forth
[40:16] &gt;&gt; something of his presence and his power
[40:17] and supernatural. Joel 1, the word of
[40:20] the Lord that came to Joel the son of
[40:22] Petuel. Here they see old men and give
[40:24] he all the inhabitants of the land. Had
[40:26] this been in your days or even in the
[40:28] days of your fathers, tell your children
[40:31] of it. Let your children tell their
[40:33] children and their children another
[40:35] generation. That which the paloon had
[40:38] left had the locust eaten. That which
[40:40] the locust had left had the kang eaten.
[40:42] That which the kang left had a had the
[40:45] caterpillar eaten. God said tell it to
[40:47] your children. Let them tell. Some don't
[40:49] overflow. overflow with wine and oil and
[40:52] I will restore to you the years that the
[40:55] glucas had eaten the cankerworm and the
[40:57] caterpillar and the palm my great army
[41:00] which I sent among you and he shall be
[41:02] eat and in plenty and be satisfied and
[41:05] praise the name of the Lord your God and
[41:07] that that that dealt wondously with you
[41:09] and my people shall never be ashamed and
[41:12] he shall know that I am in the midst of
[41:13] Israel that I am the Lord your God and
[41:16] none else and my people shall never be
[41:18] ashamed and it shall come to pass
[41:20] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[41:22] upon all flesh. Your sons and your
[41:25] daughters shall prophesy. Your old men
[41:27] shall dream dreams. Your young men shall
[41:30] see visions and also upon the servants
[41:32] and upon the handmmaids. In those days
[41:34] will I pour my spirit. Let's pray.
[41:36] Father, we thank you for your word
[41:37] interpreted our hearts today and confirm
[41:39] your word with signs, wonders, and
[41:41] miracles. I ask in Jesus name.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will be seated and give God
[41:44] some praises
[41:45] &gt;&gt; as you sit down. Praise God.
[41:48] There's a reason why we talk so much
[41:49] about praising God and give the Lord a
[41:51] shout and glory to God because the
[41:52] message about the dead
[41:54] &gt;&gt; and we fighting against that dead
[41:56] spirit.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you don't if if you don't
[41:59] open your mouth and praise God, you will
[42:00] just stay cold and dormant
[42:02] &gt;&gt; and the devil will put an air condition
[42:03] right by your ears and soo your way and
[42:06] out your light and make you sleep
[42:08] &gt;&gt; in the arms of morphas.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. to fight sleepy
[42:12] spirit, fight dead spirit, fight former
[42:15] spirit, fight Catholic spirit, fight the
[42:17] spirit of Luther and Wesley, them man
[42:19] spirit that come across into the message
[42:20] to fight all of that. Fight the message
[42:22] spirit too. Praise God. Hallelujah. Sit
[42:25] down and do sit down and don't forget
[42:27] that. Praise God. I forbe say amen. 24
[42:30] elders cast on their crown and worthy is
[42:32] the lamb to receive honor and blessing
[42:34] and dominion. And people talking about
[42:36] they see the name on the book. They see
[42:37] the name not even the Catholic book. Oh,
[42:39] blessed be the name of the Lord. But the
[42:41] lamb's book of life, God's privilege.
[42:44] You are one in a million. And God open
[42:46] up this word to you. Put your name in
[42:48] the lamb book of life. I don't get
[42:49] you're sick in your foot. You're sick in
[42:50] your hand. You're sick in your head or
[42:52] you're sick in your mind. The fact that
[42:54] God put your name, Jesus told them,
[42:56] don't rejoice because the devil is
[42:57] subject unto you. Rejoice because your
[43:00] name is in heaven.
[43:03] [Music]
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] So a title this morning, I will restore
[43:09] &gt;&gt; and I'm an inspiration, the restoration
[43:12] of all things.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Now we preach Wednesday night was a real
[43:16] battle with a tech and something like
[43:18] that. But I want to bring back that from
[43:20] Wednesday night and then I'll come after
[43:21] it and share some things with you. I
[43:23] have some things I would like to share.
[43:24] But this is the scripture here uh Acts
[43:28] 3:19:21.
[43:30] And he said, "Repent ye therefore and be
[43:32] converted that your sins may be blotted
[43:35] out when the times of refreshing shall
[43:39] come from the presence of the Lord. And
[43:41] he shall send Jesus Christ which before
[43:44] was preached unto you." Here we go. whom
[43:47] the heaven must receive
[43:49] &gt;&gt; until the times of the restitution of
[43:53] all things which God had spoken by the
[43:57] mouth of his holy prophets since the
[43:59] world began.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; So it's a prophecy
[44:02] &gt;&gt; that there's going to be a restitution
[44:04] or a restoration of all things. Now in
[44:07] Matthew 17 10-12 and the disciples asked
[44:10] him saying why then say the scribe
[44:13] &gt;&gt; that the liars must first come
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto them Elias
[44:19] prophecy
[44:20] &gt;&gt; truly
[44:21] &gt;&gt; shall first come.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; He's talking about William Brham
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Elias truly shall first come and restore
[44:27] all things.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. So brother Brandham
[44:30] anointing was a restoration anointing.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. That's why he came to
[44:35] restore our hearts. back to the faith of
[44:37] the fathers wasn't just to add another
[44:39] church or to announce another church. It
[44:42] was to restore the church back to the
[44:45] original back to the faith that the
[44:48] father has had. We give the Lord some
[44:50] praises. So right now this morning, you
[44:53] are under a restoration anointing or
[44:55] anointing of reconciliation. That mean
[44:58] God going to bring you back. That is why
[45:00] under the spirit and the bride.
[45:01] Revelation 22:17, the voice say come.
[45:05] Whosoever will come. Oh, glory to God.
[45:08] Whatever condition they're in, come. Oh,
[45:11] glory to God. The spirit of the bride
[45:12] will say come. Not go come. Oh the Lord,
[45:16] I shall come and delivered. Come and be
[45:18] healed. Come be set free. Come. Let God
[45:21] break the band of wickedness over your
[45:24] life. Oh the Lord, I shout in the house.
[45:31] Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; So, we want to go straight to that table
[45:36] of Shane want to get into this morning.
[45:38] Just just soak it in. If you was here
[45:41] Wednesday night, listen to it again.
[45:42] There a lot of stuff inside of there.
[45:44] You can't afford to miss. So, let's go
[45:46] straight into that
