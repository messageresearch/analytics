[56:15] church and the Believers in Germany from
[56:17] mother the stephanus krena and the
[56:19] Believers over there and I believe one
[56:21] of those messages was played here for
[56:25] the church amen and I trust it was a
[56:27] blessing uh to the church so the
[56:29] Believers in Germany on fire they are
[56:32] under expectation they're looking for
[56:34] God to move in a mighty way and I could
[56:37] testify that all over the world the
[56:39] spirit of God is moving can the church
[56:41] say
[56:42] Amen so and two Sundays ago I was in
[56:46] Nigeria and the Saints in in Nigeria on
[56:49] fire and they are looking for Redemption
[56:52] to draw nigh they under expectation for
[56:55] the same holy ghost that fell and the
[56:56] day of Pentecost to fall upon this end
[56:58] time bride they are under expectation
[57:00] and I bring greetings from Lagos as well
[57:02] as from Port harcour from Brother Olu
[57:05] and the Believers in the Lagos Church
[57:07] the many ministers who were there and uh
[57:10] I was able to be present for the
[57:12] homegoing service of Pastor Elijah
[57:14] akademi who has been to every convention
[57:17] we have had and he went on to be with
[57:19] the Lord and I was there to be for
[57:21] present for the service and the burial I
[57:24] was able to give some words uh at the
[57:26] funeral service as well as go over to
[57:29] Port harkort where uh he was based where
[57:32] the burial was and two Sundays ago I was
[57:36] in fellowship with uh the fful ministry
[57:39] of River State so many of the churches
[57:41] in the State uh River State where Port
[57:44] hak is a part of our present and uh we
[57:47] are grateful for God for the Saints and
[57:49] for the Believers and they send their
[57:51] love their greetings their appreciation
[57:53] to the church
[57:56] and last week Sunday I was in France by
[57:58] Brother Jano so we had a wonderful time
[58:00] in the Lord we preached twice there uh
[58:03] in France as well so it's been quite a
[58:05] journey and we know that God is doing
[58:07] something tremendous and it's certainly
[58:09] good to be back home there's no place
[58:12] like home you know when I was sharing
[58:15] with my wife that many times you travel
[58:17] in the field and uh one thing that I've
[58:20] seen it with brother ID as well and
[58:21] maybe it's it just uh maybe it's what
[58:25] what we have been trained with but many
[58:26] times the messages that we preach on the
[58:28] fields and in conventions actually start
[58:31] right here that's you know the message I
[58:33] preached in Lagos some time ago about
[58:35] jeffa it was preached here when I
[58:37] preached about the continuation of the
[58:38] generation of Jesus Christ it was
[58:40] preached here then I preached in Ghana
[58:42] uh time no longer time is running out
[58:44] preach here then spoke about brother
[58:46] Norris church and I took it to Nei
[58:48] church and you know so many of the of
[58:50] the of the services and the prayers it's
[58:52] your prayers and your encouragement
[58:54] because we can only do so much as the
[58:56] gift of God is operated by the prayers
[58:59] and the pull of the people so we thank
[59:00] you for your commitment for your
[59:01] dedication for your labor for your love
[59:04] for being present for understanding your
[59:06] post of Duty to knowing that you were
[59:08] born for such a time as this to know
[59:10] that time is short and before we realize
[59:12] it will be out of here this world is
[59:14] finished and we are under expectation
[59:16] for God to move beyond our reasoning
[59:18] beyond our imagination you know and last
[59:20] weekend in France uh I was able to
[59:23] witness a baptism and uh it's quite
[59:26] something uh sister came for baptism and
[59:30] uh it's one of the first times I've seen
[59:32] so many friends uh I guess who uh from
[59:35] the world come to witness the baptism
[59:37] you know and you know it's one thing to
[59:39] be here from the Caribbean and but it's
[59:41] another thing to see this in Europe and
[59:44] many of those who came drove 5 hours to
[59:46] come to a baptism that speaks of
[59:48] something am it speaks of it doesn't
[59:50] matter what the enemy does it doesn't
[59:51] matter how much technology it has it
[59:53] doesn't matter what the God is still
[59:55] calling sons and daughter daughters and
[59:57] it was moving to see that they came uh I
[1:00:00] spoke Saturday night and Sunday morning
[1:00:02] but their intent and their intention was
[1:00:04] to be there just for the Saturday night
[1:00:05] service and go back home you know for
[1:00:08] the drive you know so I asked brother
[1:00:10] Jano will will they be in the Sunday
[1:00:11] morning service he said no they plan to
[1:00:13] go back home but the Lord having his way
[1:00:17] the way the Lord moved on Saturday night
[1:00:18] Sunday morning we got there and they
[1:00:19] were all there still in the service I
[1:00:22] was like what happened they say well the
[1:00:23] way the service went last night they
[1:00:25] couldn't afford to go back
[1:00:27] and we are looking to see God move
[1:00:29] calling individuals because it's an
[1:00:31] individual Affair God doesn't move by
[1:00:33] groups he moves by individuals and it
[1:00:34] doesn't matter if you're in Germany if
[1:00:36] you're in France if you're in Nigeria if
[1:00:37] you're in Trinidad you're in America
[1:00:39] Australia or you take a rocket and go to
[1:00:41] another planet once your name is on the
[1:00:43] book God is going to call you home can
[1:00:46] the church say Amen so everybody feeling
[1:00:49] fine so if you have your Bibles let's
[1:00:52] stand to our feet let's read two
[1:00:54] portions of scripture really want to
[1:00:56] appreciate uh the Bible uh sorry the
[1:00:59] prayer meeting the exhortation on Friday
[1:01:01] night and the service last Wednesday if
[1:01:03] you did not hear that service last
[1:01:05] Wednesday I tell you that was a Thunder
[1:01:07] From Heaven so I want to salute brother
[1:01:09] ID I want to salute all the services
[1:01:12] brother Anthony what a tremendous what a
[1:01:15] tremendous time Amen to see how God is
[1:01:19] moving and connecting because it's one
[1:01:22] body it's one Lord It's one faith and
[1:01:24] it's one baptism so we're looking for
[1:01:26] God to speak to us this morning from his
[1:01:29] word so reading two portions of
[1:01:32] scripture we're going to read from
[1:01:33] Revelation 5 and we're going to read
[1:01:35] Matthew chapter 6 and we know that today
[1:01:37] is Sunday uh it is the Lord's day so we
[1:01:41] are here in the house of God to spend
[1:01:43] our time in the presence of the Lord so
[1:01:45] forget about your bills forget about
[1:01:47] tomorrow forget about everything else
[1:01:49] and I want to encourage you to pay full
[1:01:52] attention on what God wants to say here
[1:01:54] this morning so reading from Revelation
[1:01:56] 5 I'm reading from verse
[1:02:00] one and I saw in the right hand of him
[1:02:02] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:02:04] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:02:06] Seven
[1:02:07] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:02:10] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:02:11] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[1:02:14] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[1:02:17] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:02:18] able to open the book neither to look
[1:02:20] there on and I wept much because no man
[1:02:23] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:02:25] book neither to look there on and one of
[1:02:28] the elders saith unto me weep not Behold
[1:02:31] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:02:33] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:02:36] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[1:02:38] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:02:40] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:02:41] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:02:44] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:02:46] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:02:48] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[1:02:51] he came and took the book out of the
[1:02:53] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:02:54] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:02:56] the four beasts and the 4 and 20 Elders
[1:02:58] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:03:01] one of them Hops and golden vials full
[1:03:03] of odors which are the
[1:03:05] prayers prayers of the Saints and they
[1:03:09] sung a new song saying now are worthy to
[1:03:11] take the book and to open the seals
[1:03:14] thereof for thou was slain and H has
[1:03:15] redeemed us to God by the blood out of
[1:03:18] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[1:03:20] nation and H has made us unto our God
[1:03:24] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[1:03:27] the earth and reading Matthew 6 reading
[1:03:31] from verse 9 a very familiar scripture
[1:03:34] and uh we're going to spend some time
[1:03:37] here relooking at this by the grace of
[1:03:40] God Matthew 6 verse
[1:03:44] 9 after this manner therefore pray ye
[1:03:48] our father with art in heaven Hallowed
[1:03:52] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:03:55] done in earth as it is in heaven give us
[1:03:59] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[1:04:02] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[1:04:05] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[1:04:07] Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom
[1:04:11] and the power and the glory forever amen
[1:04:15] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:04:17] reading of his word can we bow our heads
[1:04:19] for word of prayer our gracious Heavenly
[1:04:22] Father any man could read the scriptures
[1:04:24] but it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe
[1:04:26] life upon it Lord for the few moments we
[1:04:30] have together on this Sunday Lord we
[1:04:32] come as a needy people looking for a
[1:04:35] fresh
[1:04:36] touch Lord looking for a word in due
[1:04:39] season the right word one day Lord your
[1:04:42] Prophet said the right words will be
[1:04:43] spoken and we'll Dash into the presence
[1:04:46] of God lord may this be that kind of a
[1:04:49] day May something that be said Lord May
[1:04:51] something be said that Lord that will
[1:04:53] touch the hearts of the people in such
[1:04:55] way Lord that if there's a backslider in
[1:04:58] our midst this morning they'll be
[1:04:59] restored completely if there's anyone
[1:05:02] sick in our midst they'll be healed
[1:05:04] completely if there's anyone Lord down
[1:05:06] or uncertain or father going through
[1:05:09] some struggle Lord that the word of God
[1:05:10] would bring peace and Clarity and
[1:05:12] comfort Lord Lord if there's anyone
[1:05:14] Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:16] they'll be filled father Lord may you
[1:05:18] pour out your Holy Spirit upon your
[1:05:20] people and may you confirm the word with
[1:05:22] signs with wonders with Miracles Lord
[1:05:24] and may you Lord speak to us as you've
[1:05:27] never had before take me out of the way
[1:05:29] hide me behind calvary's cross father
[1:05:32] Lord I don't want my thought I don't
[1:05:33] want my ideas but father Lord you send
[1:05:35] us a prophet with a message Lord and the
[1:05:37] opening of the seals has turned the
[1:05:39] Bible into a new book so may you walk
[1:05:42] out of the pages of this book father
[1:05:44] Lord father through the lens of the
[1:05:46] revealed word uh so we can take comfort
[1:05:48] and safety to know how we going to leave
[1:05:50] this place father Lord may you Lord take
[1:05:53] complete control in the precious name of
[1:05:54] Jesus Christ and the church says amen
[1:05:57] and amen you may be
[1:05:58] seated I'm under
[1:06:00] expectation for what God is going to do
[1:06:03] I want to take my time because I want to
[1:06:05] do a bit of a teaching some little
[1:06:07] preaching some little encouragement but
[1:06:08] by the grace of God at the end of the
[1:06:11] service I want you to be able to relook
[1:06:13] at the Lord's Prayer maybe in a way you
[1:06:15] never thought about it you know many
[1:06:17] things uh we look at in scripture uh and
[1:06:21] in the word become common to us you know
[1:06:24] and and until when Jesus came he said I
[1:06:26] I don't like all the Traditions you have
[1:06:29] turned everything into just a tradition
[1:06:30] and a and a ritual but there is
[1:06:33] substance in the word and there's things
[1:06:35] in there that God left and if you don't
[1:06:37] spend time to to look at it and
[1:06:39] investigate it and study it and pick it
[1:06:41] up then then you'll not see the
[1:06:42] magnitude of it so can the church say
[1:06:44] Amen so I have a title this morning the
[1:06:47] Lord's Prayer connects the altar to the
[1:06:52] throne The Lord's Prayer connects the
[1:06:56] altar to the
[1:06:59] throne so for us to even start this
[1:07:02] study if I could use that word this
[1:07:04] morning we need to go back to the very
[1:07:07] beginning and in the very beginning when
[1:07:10] God created the Sun the moon the stars
[1:07:13] the Earth man everything was in place we
[1:07:15] could clearly see that God's will was
[1:07:18] perfectly established on the earth God
[1:07:21] has a will he has a desire he has a
[1:07:23] purpose he has an objective he has
[1:07:25] something something that he wants to see
[1:07:26] and when God had finished he could say
[1:07:28] it was good can we agree on this this
[1:07:31] morning when God looked at the work of
[1:07:33] the first day and the second day and the
[1:07:35] third day and the fourth day every
[1:07:37] single day God said it was good the very
[1:07:39] thought of God the very picture of God
[1:07:42] the what God had in his mind had been
[1:07:44] perfectly expressed and God could rest
[1:07:47] can the church say Amen the perfect will
[1:07:50] of God was established on the earth and
[1:07:51] there was no separation between Heaven
[1:07:54] and Earth
[1:07:56] that's right can the church say amen and
[1:07:58] I'm beginning to hint at certain things
[1:08:00] because in the Lord's Prayer it says
[1:08:02] your will on Heaven and Earth can the
[1:08:05] church say Amen so at the very beginning
[1:08:07] before man fell God's will was the same
[1:08:10] on Heaven and Earth because man was in
[1:08:12] perfect harmony with God hallelujah man
[1:08:15] didn't have his own will he didn't have
[1:08:16] his own idea about things he didn't have
[1:08:19] his own Ambitions about things he was in
[1:08:21] perfect harmony with God can the Church
[1:08:23] Say Amen hallelu Hallelujah God and man
[1:08:27] had full communion full fellowship and I
[1:08:30] want to add something there was no need
[1:08:32] for
[1:08:34] prayer Hallelujah in the Garden of Eden
[1:08:37] there was nothing like a prayer meeting
[1:08:38] brother Lyndon there was no need to
[1:08:40] prayer because it was perfect Fellowship
[1:08:42] that was perfect harmony there was never
[1:08:44] Adam did not pray before the fall oh
[1:08:47] somebody preach back to me maybe you
[1:08:49] never heard that before but there was no
[1:08:50] need for Adam to pray because he was in
[1:08:53] perfect fellowship with God God could
[1:08:55] come down in the cool of the evening and
[1:08:56] just have a conversation with his son
[1:08:59] because his son was in perfect alignment
[1:09:01] with his will with his purpose with his
[1:09:03] plan with his vision with his objective
[1:09:05] can the church say
[1:09:07] amen and our whole objective from the
[1:09:10] fall of Man is to get back to Eden can
[1:09:13] the church say Amen so prayer has to be
[1:09:15] a means to get us back because prayer
[1:09:18] wasn't there but God had to oh I don't
[1:09:21] want to get ahead of myself this morning
[1:09:23] can the Church Say Amen
[1:09:26] but after the fall communion was lost
[1:09:29] Fellowship was lost Adam went into
[1:09:32] hiding can the church say amen and
[1:09:35] prayer became necessary as a way for man
[1:09:38] to reach God can the church say Amen
[1:09:41] somebody help me preach this morning the
[1:09:44] Bible tells us the first time you could
[1:09:46] find prayer is in Genesis 4 when the
[1:09:49] Bible says then began men to call upon
[1:09:51] the name of the Lord so in Genesis 1
[1:09:54] Genesis 2 Genesis three you can't find
[1:09:56] one reference to prayer but at the end
[1:09:59] the last verse of Genesis 4 it says then
[1:10:02] men began to call upon the name of the
[1:10:04] Lord because they recognized they
[1:10:06] couldn't do it on their own and they
[1:10:08] needed something more they needed to
[1:10:10] reach Beyond themselves somebody help me
[1:10:13] this morning anybody with me in the
[1:10:16] [Applause]
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:21] house brother Brandon would pick this up
[1:10:24] and in Revelation chapter 4 we have said
[1:10:27] this before but the bandam said the only
[1:10:29] way back to Eden is by the
[1:10:37] altar here you go again see Back to Eden
[1:10:40] through the altar so the
[1:10:44] altar is the way back to
[1:10:46] Eden but we preach about the war of
[1:10:48] altars the war of priests the war of
[1:10:50] sacrifices some months ago when you have
[1:10:52] an altar altar is one part of the puzzle
[1:10:55] you have to bring your sacrifice to the
[1:10:58] altar the altar is a means to pray at
[1:11:01] the altar so when you come standing
[1:11:03] praying at the altar without if you have
[1:11:05] the altar without prayer there just an
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:10] altar can the church say
[1:11:16] Amen I'm building it this it's a little
[1:11:18] encouragement so we could now Rel look
[1:11:20] at the Lord's
[1:11:23] Prayer so man because he is Fallen man
[1:11:27] because he is broken man because he has
[1:11:30] needs throughout all of the Bible we
[1:11:32] could find instances of
[1:11:35] prayer we see Hannah in the temple
[1:11:37] praying because she wants a child and
[1:11:40] God
[1:11:41] answers her prayer hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:45] you could go example after example he
[1:11:47] said If my people will humble themselves
[1:11:49] and pray seek my face turn from their
[1:11:52] Wicked Ways they will hear from heaven
[1:11:54] and I will heal their
[1:11:56] land prayer was a means for God to be
[1:12:00] activated he said I've heard the cries
[1:12:02] of my people and I've come down I can't
[1:12:06] move until you call me I can't respond
[1:12:08] until you call me when you start to
[1:12:13] pray you begin to move Heaven you begin
[1:12:17] to
[1:12:18] activate the Hallelujah Hallelujah the
[1:12:20] celestial realm to bring the celestial
[1:12:23] realm down to the terrestrial realm you
[1:12:24] begin to bring God to Earth because man
[1:12:27] has dominion over the Earth and he needs
[1:12:28] to be invited he said I stand at the
[1:12:31] door and knock If any man hear my voice
[1:12:33] and open it that voice is a voice of
[1:12:38] prayer anybody with me this
[1:12:48] morning many scriptures Abraham prayed
[1:12:52] his conversation God was a pray say Lord
[1:12:54] if there
[1:12:59] 50 Moses prayed David prayed you could
[1:13:02] find it all through
[1:13:05] scripture and these men prayed with a
[1:13:08] partial
[1:13:10] realization a partial understanding can
[1:13:13] the church say
[1:13:14] Amen but when Jesus
[1:13:18] came because at the highest level of
[1:13:21] Prayer in the Old Testament it was the
[1:13:22] high priest brother George who had to go
[1:13:24] and intercede for the
[1:13:27] people but when Jesus
[1:13:31] came the King was on the earth the king
[1:13:34] who was
[1:13:36] prophet the prophet who was Priest the
[1:13:39] priest who was sacrifice the sacrifice
[1:13:42] standing there and the disciples in Luke
[1:13:45] said teach
[1:13:48] us teach us how to
[1:13:50] pray it had to have been something about
[1:13:53] the way he prayed that attracted their
[1:13:59] attention can the church say
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:08] and he gave them a structure of a prayer
[1:14:13] that every single believer should know
[1:14:16] but what does it really mean because the
[1:14:18] real issue is Brother George anybody in
[1:14:21] Christendom who claims to be Christian
[1:14:23] could look at the LA
[1:14:26] prayer but what does it mean to us as
[1:14:29] Believers now that the seals have been
[1:14:33] opened because the seals being open
[1:14:35] means the Bible is a new book means we
[1:14:38] could read that prayer with the lens or
[1:14:40] the eyes of the fullness of the revealed
[1:14:43] word because if the question was asked
[1:14:46] Lord teach us how to pray and Jesus
[1:14:48] begins to give them a way to
[1:14:51] pray that would withstand time that's
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:55] would withstand ages would withstand
[1:15:00] situations I want to encourage you this
[1:15:02] morning that in that Lord's Prayer God
[1:15:04] dealt with all the church
[1:15:05] ages in the Lord's Prayer he dealt with
[1:15:08] the Seven Seals in the Lord's Prayer is
[1:15:11] the seventh thunders in the Lord's
[1:15:13] Prayer is your inheritance in the Lord's
[1:15:15] Prayer is your deliverance in the Lord's
[1:15:18] Prayer is your Revival
[1:15:27] The Lord's Prayer is more than just
[1:15:28] words in the Lord's Prayer he actually
[1:15:30] expresses the whole plan the whole Plan
[1:15:33] of Redemption for the bride is in the
[1:15:35] Lord's
[1:15:36] Prayer you remember when Peter was there
[1:15:38] and the Lord told Peter Peter I've
[1:15:40] prayed for you that your faith don't
[1:15:42] fail the Lord give us some ammunition
[1:15:45] because there's a certain prayer and
[1:15:47] within his prayer there's a mystery of
[1:15:49] this Lord's prayer that is most relevant
[1:15:50] to us today can the church say Amen not
[1:15:54] everybody could pray Lord's Prayer you
[1:16:00] know this is not the Our Father prayer
[1:16:03] no it's more than that it's a weapon
[1:16:06] there's power in this prayer there's a
[1:16:09] secret in this prayer there's a mystery
[1:16:11] in this prayer are you ready let's
[1:16:15] go the Lord's Prayer a Divine
[1:16:20] blueprint and the Lord Prayer has a
[1:16:23] certain number of statements being made
[1:16:28] are you
[1:16:29] ready let's
[1:16:38] go brother pun shine to preach ahead of
[1:16:47] me Glory Glory Glory
[1:16:51] Glory so the Lord's Prayer starts with
[1:16:54] our father
[1:16:55] which art in heaven now when you look at
[1:16:58] this statement this was a very
[1:17:00] interesting statement because this is
[1:17:02] the only time where Jesus actually says
[1:17:05] our father he would many times say I am
[1:17:08] my father
[1:17:10] one my father this is the only time he
[1:17:13] brought a level of
[1:17:14] inclusion into this concept of
[1:17:17] fatherhood because it means for you to
[1:17:19] say our father you are part of this
[1:17:22] family of God of which he is the a and
[1:17:25] we become join a So within this just
[1:17:27] simple Declaration of our father there's
[1:17:30] an acknowledgement of a mystery of
[1:17:32] adoption because it's only by the spirit
[1:17:35] of adoption we could properly cry AB
[1:17:37] father so outside of Hey Brother
[1:17:40] Clarence good to see
[1:17:42] you Hallelujah So within the Our Father
[1:17:46] you can't especially now in this age
[1:17:49] with the George when you say our father
[1:17:51] it is with now the revelation of
[1:17:52] adoption not just God is my father no
[1:17:55] but by the spirit you could the spir
[1:17:58] What Spirit the spirit of adoption you
[1:18:00] could truly cry AB father so the Our
[1:18:03] father now means access to God as your
[1:18:06] father because you are now part of the
[1:18:08] body it means the Our Father part of the
[1:18:12] prayer speaks to Divine
[1:18:14] privilege Divine access so outside of
[1:18:17] the body you can't even pray our father
[1:18:20] because it's only by the spirit
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:26] Hallelujah you have to be led by the
[1:18:28] spirit say as many as are led by the
[1:18:30] spirit they are the sons of God so if
[1:18:32] you're not spirit-led you can't even
[1:18:34] start to pray just pray oh you don't
[1:18:36] hear me this
[1:18:38] morning
[1:18:41] hallelujah hallelujah so when Jesus said
[1:18:44] our father he was speaking about the
[1:18:46] restoration of
[1:18:52] sunship Glory Hallelujah Hal Hallelujah
[1:18:55] this was not a light Our Father brother
[1:18:57] George he was talking about your check
[1:18:59] your signature being good as a father's
[1:19:01] check this is not the Pentecostal age
[1:19:03] this is not ireneus age this is the
[1:19:05] pride age the same Lord's Prayer worked
[1:19:09] in the first age it was prayed in the
[1:19:11] second age it was prayed in the third
[1:19:13] age it was a prayer for all ages but now
[1:19:16] in our
[1:19:18] day what does it mean in our day
[1:19:25] now in our day Sons daughters could pray
[1:19:28] our father with a revelation of being in
[1:19:31] your rightful position as a Son of God
[1:19:34] hallelujah because this is listen if
[1:19:37] somebody random who you don't know come
[1:19:38] and call you father you will
[1:19:41] respond somebody just walking and say
[1:19:44] daddy you see who are you there's no
[1:19:46] relationship but this very prayer starts
[1:19:49] in our father a level of Fellowship a
[1:19:52] level of communication with a D direct
[1:19:55] pathway of sunship inheritance
[1:19:58] adoption Romans 8 for you have not
[1:20:01] received a spirit of bondage against a
[1:20:02] fear but you have received a spirit of
[1:20:04] adoption whereby we can cry AB father
[1:20:08] Hallelujah brother brandom taught us
[1:20:09] adoption mean placement so we talking
[1:20:11] about this prayer there comes a point
[1:20:13] with a draw where this prayer is about
[1:20:14] play sons having a certain kind of
[1:20:17] communication with God can the church
[1:20:19] say
[1:20:22] Amen everybody with me this morning this
[1:20:25] is the same Lord's Prayer right let's go
[1:20:27] we building so we're going to look at
[1:20:29] just two snapshots and going to go
[1:20:30] through the prayer then we're going to
[1:20:32] look and see how does the seals connect
[1:20:34] to the
[1:20:36] prayer everybody with me you know we are
[1:20:39] not creatures of time become from
[1:20:40] eternity and the seeds unlock the
[1:20:42] mystery John wept because there was no
[1:20:44] found no one worthy to to lose the seals
[1:20:46] but the breaking of the seals gives us
[1:20:48] direct access to Redemption the full
[1:20:50] Plan of Redemption can the Church Say
[1:20:52] Amen
[1:20:55] and brother BR I'm taught of the Seven
[1:20:57] Seals is the mystery of God being
[1:20:59] unveiled to God's children can the
[1:21:02] church say amen he that overcometh in
[1:21:04] Revelation shall inherit all things and
[1:21:06] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[1:21:10] Hallelujah
[1:21:12] Glory it goes beyond this Our Father
[1:21:15] which art in Heaven speaking about the
[1:21:18] sovereignty of
[1:21:20] God glory acknowledging the separation
[1:21:24] acknowledging the fact that God is Not
[1:21:26] on our
[1:21:28] level acking that he's above all our
[1:21:31] problems that the situations on this
[1:21:33] Earthly existence this is small to God
[1:21:36] because he is God in heaven Hallelujah
[1:21:38] and this will make more sense when we
[1:21:39] get to the seals but Our Father Who Art
[1:21:41] in Heaven he is bigger than your problem
[1:21:44] he's bigger than the Earthly situation
[1:21:46] he's bigger than Earthly kingdoms he's
[1:21:48] bigger than your bills Our Father which
[1:21:50] art in Heaven this was a prayer but the
[1:21:53] prayer was also a blueprint but it also
[1:21:55] teaches us that before you ask God for
[1:21:57] anything you have to acknowledge who he
[1:22:02] is this prayer has seven Parts but the
[1:22:05] first part just acknowledges Our Father
[1:22:07] Who Art in Heaven Hallelujah he's not a
[1:22:10] God of this Earth he's a god of the
[1:22:12] heaven he is higher than the earth he is
[1:22:15] higher than your problem he is higher
[1:22:17] than your situation he is higher than
[1:22:18] your sickness he is higher than your
[1:22:20] mind battle he is higher than your
[1:22:22] depression
[1:22:34] then it goes
[1:22:35] on and only true Sons could really pray
[1:22:39] this prayer Hallowed be thy
[1:22:44] name Worthy is your name there's
[1:22:49] reverence in this name there's power in
[1:22:53] this name there's Deliverance in this

[1:23:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ she'll because
[1:23:15] Mrs Jesus Christ because she will have
[1:23:17] his name oh can the church say Amen but
[1:23:20] do you recognize that there's power in
[1:23:22] his name do you recognize that his name
[1:23:24] is is Holy At The Mention Of His Name
[1:23:27] that John was dead in Elizabeth's womb
[1:23:29] but At The Mention of the name that John
[1:23:32] came alive there's power in that name

[1:27:41] redemption that belongs to the human
[1:27:43] race and that is the name of
[1:27:51] Jesus and that name will be your
[1:27:53] identification
[1:27:58] everybody with me just encourage you
[1:28:00] this morning then the prayer goes
[1:28:03] on thy kingdom
[1:28:07] come and here Jesus is connecting all
[1:28:10] the way back to when Daniel saw that
[1:28:13] image talk about the stone that was cut
[1:28:16] out with the hands of man that stone
[1:28:18] that strike the image of the Beast and
[1:28:20] destroyed every single Kingdom this is I
[1:28:23] want you to understand this this is a
[1:28:24] prayer that Jesus is saying we ought to
[1:28:26] be praying this
[1:28:28] way so you ought to be praying with a
[1:28:32] consciousness of the relationship you
[1:28:34] have with God and the relationship you
[1:28:36] should have with God the fullness of
[1:28:38] that relationship through the mystery of
[1:28:40] sunship and adoption Hallelujah the fact
[1:28:44] that God is Sovereign and he is bigger
[1:28:46] he is more powerful he's not here in
[1:28:48] Earth limited to our limited beliefs but
[1:28:50] his thoughts are higher than our
[1:28:51] thoughts his ways are higher than our
[1:28:52] ways as the heavens are on the earth he
[1:28:55] is in
[1:28:58] heaven Hallowed be his name and then his
[1:29:03] kingdom before you ask God for blessing
[1:29:06] before you ask God for healing before
[1:29:08] you ask God for anything you want to see
[1:29:10] his
[1:29:12] kingdom thy kingdom come
[1:29:15] Hallelujah Jesus said the kingdom of God
[1:29:18] the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom and he
[1:29:20] when he came he was preaching the
[1:29:22] kingdom the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:29:26] hand the whole Bible is about the
[1:29:28] restoration of this
[1:29:30] Kingdom that's right Deliverance when
[1:29:34] you're in trouble what he supposed to do
[1:29:35] pray and if you pray a certain way with
[1:29:37] the revelation of what you're praying
[1:29:38] for that's how you overcome Jesus
[1:29:40] overcame by
[1:29:44] prayer everybody with me this morning so
[1:29:46] you're saying brother is I'm praying for
[1:29:47] my family I'm praying but are you
[1:29:49] praying with a revelation of
[1:29:51] sunship of where God is with a
[1:29:54] revelation of his name with a revelation
[1:29:56] that his kingdom coming also means
[1:29:58] certain privileges to those who are part
[1:30:00] of this Kingdom die Kingdom Come means
[1:30:03] those who are part of the Kingdom could
[1:30:04] access Kingdom benefits could access
[1:30:06] Kingdom Authority could access Kingdom
[1:30:09] power and that when this kingdom is
[1:30:10] fully realized Satan has no place
[1:30:13] because the sons of God will be in their
[1:30:14] position no wonder the whole creation is
[1:30:16] grown in for the manifestation of the
[1:30:18] sons of God which is the same as Sons
[1:30:20] coming into position in the Kingdom can
[1:30:24] the church say
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:29] hallelujah fear not little flock it is
[1:30:31] your father's good pleasure to give you
[1:30:33] the
[1:30:39] kingdom and the Bible says in Revelation
[1:30:41] 11 the kingdom of this world I become
[1:30:43] the kingdom of our Lord and of his

[1:32:33] looked for it in the second
[1:32:35] age do you realize every Church age had
[1:32:39] this
[1:32:41] prayer every Church age prayed for the
[1:32:44] kingdom to
[1:32:47] come they had this same blueprint and
[1:32:50] every every member of the Bride of every
[1:32:53] age could pray the same prayer they say
[1:32:56] Lord thy kingdom come Lord we need your
[1:32:58] kingdom but it was not for the first age
[1:33:01] it was not for the second age it was not

[1:33:07] final Voice final people thy kingdom
[1:33:10] come
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:36] we are not just talking about
[1:33:41] sunship Hallelujah the same way brother
[1:33:44] punch Jesus could be
[1:33:46] Prophet priest king sacrifice lawyer and
[1:33:52] judge
[1:33:55] it's the same way the bride could be son
[1:33:59] King priest intercessor Advocate oh come
[1:34:03] on now you don't hear me this morning
[1:34:06] you're looking at yourself
[1:34:08] small come on Gideon you mighty man of
[1:34:11] Valor do you know who you are do you
[1:34:13] know what you're called to do do you
[1:34:15] know that there's more power in you than
[1:34:17] everything the enemy has there more
[1:34:18] power in you now greater is he that's in
[1:34:21] you than he that's in the world
[1:34:25] that's why your female condition has got
[1:34:27] to
[1:34:28] go that's why cancer has got to go
[1:34:31] that's why high blood pressure has got
[1:34:32] to go that's why every disease has got
[1:34:35] to go because the kingdom is coming into
[1:34:37] Power the kingdom is coming into view
[1:34:40] thy kingdom
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:52] come the kingdom
[1:34:54] coming is the authority that Adam lost
[1:34:58] coming back into
[1:35:02] Power full restoration of
[1:35:06] Eden everybody feeling fine
[1:35:10] Hallelujah
[1:35:12] Glory
[1:35:13] Hallelujah could you take some more we
[1:35:16] still in the
[1:35:19] prayer and it's a prayer you know many
[1:35:21] of us when we hear prayers like you want
[1:35:23] to ask God for something but here Jesus
[1:35:26] is saying you want to know how to pray
[1:35:28] and God has given a secret in this
[1:35:30] prayer a mystery in this prayer a key in
[1:35:32] this prayer he given them a road map he
[1:35:34] given them a way of Escape he's given
[1:35:36] them power in the
[1:35:40] prayer now it's one thing because but
[1:35:42] said the moment the bride gets to know
[1:35:43] who she is then the Raptor could
[1:35:46] go a virgin shall conceive set a
[1:35:49] scripture until Mary
[1:35:52] came Malachi 4 five and six sat a
[1:35:55] scripture until brother brandham
[1:36:00] came so this full mystery of redemption
[1:36:03] unlocked by the revealing of the Seven
[1:36:05] Seals has sat a
[1:36:11] scripture now revealed it's been here
[1:36:13] because Rapture in faith is laying in
[1:36:14] the
[1:36:15] message the key to out of here is lay in
[1:36:18] the message but preach all of
[1:36:20] this thy will be done
[1:36:26] on Earth as it is in heaven now this
[1:36:29] scripture is
[1:36:30] powerful because this scripture is not
[1:36:33] about your will or my will this is about
[1:36:36] the administration of
[1:36:40] will so in Gethsemane in get Gethsemane
[1:36:44] Jesus says Lord not my will but thy will
[1:36:47] be done but this scripture is a little
[1:36:48] different this is saying thy will be
[1:36:51] done on Earth as
[1:36:54] it is done in heaven in other words when
[1:36:56] God has a will in heaven it is carried
[1:36:59] out a certain way oh you don't hear me
[1:37:02] there's nothing to challenge his will in
[1:37:08] heaven the administration of his will
[1:37:11] whatever existed to challenge his will
[1:37:14] was kicked out when Lucifer was kicked
[1:37:16] out and we were there doing the kicking
[1:37:19] out
[1:37:22] [Applause]
[1:37:25] hallah Hallelujah so this prayer before
[1:37:29] you even ask for anything is Lord thy
[1:37:31] will be done on Earth with the same
[1:37:34] ease with which it is done in
[1:37:37] heaven where there's nothing to stop it
[1:37:40] you don't hear me this morning thy will
[1:37:42] be done on Earth the same way when God
[1:37:45] say move in heaven but the L nobody stop
[1:37:48] they move Hallelujah and there's coming
[1:37:51] a time when God's will on Earth will be
[1:37:54] just like his will in heaven where
[1:37:56] there'll be no nothing to stop his will
[1:37:59] from being fulfilled and if God's will
[1:38:01] is to see you come to Perfection there's
[1:38:03] nothing to stop that will from being
[1:38:05] expressed there's been no demon no
[1:38:08] sickness no power no doubt no fear no
[1:38:11] unbelief his will will have a perfect
[1:38:14] will a perfect
[1:38:19] way you may be seated
[1:38:24] God's will is always done in
[1:38:28] heaven the problem is not in
[1:38:31] heaven the problem is here on Earth
[1:38:34] because man have dominion over the Earth
[1:38:36] and it takes a man totally surrendered
[1:38:38] to God for God's will to be able to
[1:38:42] operate but there's some resistance on
[1:38:46] Earth that's hindering the
[1:38:48] will so in that prayer before you ask
[1:38:51] for anything is th will be done because
[1:38:55] if you could ever get to the spot where
[1:38:57] the way your will is managed and
[1:38:59] administered and
[1:39:01] expressed so when those boys were in the
[1:39:04] fiery furnace worm would say send me
[1:39:06] I'll
[1:39:07] go but God's will say woman no you don't
[1:39:12] go woman say led to go
[1:39:15] down the Lord himself became the forth
[1:39:18] man in the fire his will perfectly
[1:39:21] expressed
[1:39:26] we are waiting to see the will of God
[1:39:29] fully expressed on the earth the same
[1:39:32] way is expressed in Heaven Can the
[1:39:34] church say
[1:39:37] Amen this battle of will where on the
[1:39:41] earth now
[1:39:43] Jesus has to pray not my will but thine
[1:39:46] be done and this battle that we face on
[1:39:49] this Earth of this two Wills your will
[1:39:52] your desire your goal your dream your
[1:39:54] ambition and God has a will for your
[1:39:56] life he has a purpose for your life he
[1:39:58] has a plan for your life he has
[1:39:59] blessings for your life and we end up
[1:40:01] actually hindering the plan of God for
[1:40:03] our Liv because our will gets in the way
[1:40:04] of God's will that's right that's right
[1:40:08] can the church say
[1:40:10] Amen
[1:40:12] Glory Hallelujah now after this picture
[1:40:17] brother the Clarance is is painted Our
[1:40:19] Father adoption sunship Who Art in
[1:40:22] Heaven his thoughts hide on our thoughts
[1:40:24] the celestial realm above the
[1:40:26] terrestrial
[1:40:27] realm Hallowed be thy name the name of
[1:40:30] God the name above every other name
[1:40:32] there's no other
[1:40:34] name thy kingdom come prophetic speaking
[1:40:38] of the coming Kingdom that has been
[1:40:40] spoken about that brings us all the way
[1:40:42] back to
[1:40:43] Eden thy will be done on Earth as it is
[1:40:47] in heaven now we finish this first part
[1:40:50] of the prayer that has nothing to do
[1:40:52] with you
[1:40:56] all of that prayer thus far has all to
[1:40:58] do with God our Father in heaven
[1:41:02] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:41:05] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[1:41:07] heaven no man in that
[1:41:13] prayer some of we approach God and say
[1:41:15] Lord is me
[1:41:19] again Lord I look in you know your nor
[1:41:22] need
[1:41:23] and you approach god without
[1:41:25] acknowledging if you even have a
[1:41:28] relationship without acknowledging the
[1:41:30] sovereignty of who he is and the Majesty
[1:41:32] of his power without reverencing his
[1:41:35] name without speaking the way he said of
[1:41:38] his coming
[1:41:40] Kingdom without acknowledging the fact
[1:41:42] that his will has to be here on Earth as
[1:41:44] it is in heaven the way it was in
[1:41:46] Eden because we said at the beginning
[1:41:48] God's will was perfectly expressed
[1:41:50] before the fall anybody with me this
[1:41:52] morning
[1:41:54] now after this he could say give
[1:41:57] us this
[1:41:59] day our daily
[1:42:03] bread speaks of the provision of
[1:42:06] God every single
[1:42:09] day so every day you supposed to be
[1:42:12] asking God where is my bread for
[1:42:18] today because he's the one who's suppos
[1:42:20] to give you your daily bread
[1:42:23] and the prayers give us this day our
[1:42:26] daily bread on a daily basis you
[1:42:29] acknowledging the fact that there's no
[1:42:31] bread outside you don't want bread
[1:42:33] outside of God's
[1:42:39] bread so when you get in the morning and
[1:42:41] you working because you working and and
[1:42:43] it's your effort and that's not God's
[1:42:45] bread you going to work because you want
[1:42:47] to go to work for God to determine how
[1:42:50] what bread you supposed to get so this
[1:42:52] is in the natural as much as it is in
[1:42:54] the
[1:42:56] spiritualise are you looking to your own
[1:42:58] strength for your daily bread or are you
[1:43:01] ready trusting in God to give you every
[1:43:04] day your daily bread because he said
[1:43:07] I've
[1:43:08] never seen the righteous forsaken or his
[1:43:12] seed begging bread this is not you
[1:43:15] begging bread this is God saying he has
[1:43:17] promis to provide your needs but you
[1:43:19] have to ask him on a daily basis give us
[1:43:23] this
[1:43:25] day I want my bread for Sunday Lord
[1:43:28] whatever is for me today in the natural
[1:43:30] in the spiritual I want it today this
[1:43:32] day I'm talking about this day we will
[1:43:34] deal with tomorrow tomorrow but this day
[1:43:37] there's a daily bread there's spiritual
[1:43:40] food in due season take no thought of
[1:43:43] Tomorrow there's bread for tomorrow and
[1:43:46] the bread of yesterday is not good for
[1:43:47] today I want the daily bread for today

[1:44:12] Pentecostal had bread for their day what
[1:44:15] about our day give us this day our daily
[1:44:18] bread
[1:44:33] hallu and this is why the preaching of
[1:44:35] the word is so
[1:44:37] important because it's presentence food

[1:48:10] this thing good all by itself all the
[1:48:12] nutrients for the body is in this bread
[1:48:15] this is not man big bread this is daily
[1:48:18] bread from the Lord himself
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:23] friends you may be seated I have no
[1:48:26] bread to give
[1:48:27] you my bread a taken you anywhere
[1:48:30] because Jesus said he is the
[1:48:37] bread he's the living
[1:48:41] bread so the daily bread is eaten
[1:48:44] brother George of the living
[1:48:46] bread we are feeding on the body
[1:48:50] word the unfailing body word of the son
[1:48:52] of man that's the living bread fresh
[1:48:56] every day can the church say Amen come
[1:48:58] on young people you got to know this
[1:49:00] this is your
[1:49:05] message throughout every age with the
[1:49:08] pop well they had to seek
[1:49:11] God for the bread of that
[1:49:15] day so the just shall live by faith was
[1:49:19] the bread for luter day and if you fed
[1:49:22] on that bread you were nourished in that
[1:49:25] age in Wesley's age they had bread for
[1:49:28] their day Luther's bread was stale in
[1:49:32] Wesley's day they had to get fresh bread
[1:49:36] baked for their age baked for their hour
[1:49:39] God called men had to stand identified
[1:49:42] with the revealing of the word for that
[1:49:44] day only preaching fresh bread only
[1:49:47] bringing fresh bread but that bread also
[1:49:50] became stale during the open door age
[1:49:52] when the Pentecostals come can the
[1:49:55] church say amen and now under the
[1:49:58] messenger of the seven Angel seven star
[1:50:02] in the right hand of God Malachi 45 and
[1:50:04] 6 St Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 William
[1:50:08] Bram the prophet we have all the food
[1:50:11] value that was Tau up all over the ages
[1:50:14] baked into the best bread you could ever
[1:50:16] eat the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[1:50:19] because the son of man was veiled in a
[1:50:22] son of man giving out the bread
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:26] himself hallu you may be
[1:50:32] seated hallu so I want to underscore
[1:50:34] friends that Jesus gave this Lord's
[1:50:36] Prayer and as a believer in every age
[1:50:39] you had a right to pray this
[1:50:42] prayer with the revelation of the word
[1:50:44] you had in that day it is just that in
[1:50:46] our day it means the fullness of of
[1:50:49] everything because we can look back and
[1:50:51] see what has already taken place
[1:50:53] everybody with me could you take some
[1:51:02] more
[1:51:09] Glory so much I want to skip a few
[1:51:12] things here cuz I have some give us this
[1:51:15] day our daily bread and let's move
[1:51:17] on forgive us
[1:51:24] everybody with
[1:51:26] me forgive us our
[1:51:30] debts as
[1:51:33] we so your
[1:51:36] debt is
[1:51:39] conditional now this is a mystery here
[1:51:42] because this age there's a virtue of
[1:51:45] this age Bly kindness
[1:51:47] forgiveness so Jesus was praying and yes
[1:51:50] they could have prayed it in the first
[1:51:51] age second age third age but this has
[1:51:55] significance because if this virtue is
[1:51:57] not displayed your father can't even
[1:51:59] forgive
[1:52:00] you who am I to hold something against
[1:52:03] you when God had to tell the prophet
[1:52:06] that when he was judging The woman there
[1:52:09] he said I forgive you and you condemn
[1:52:18] her so within the Lord's Prayer God God
[1:52:22] drop a mystery of the virtue of this
[1:52:25] age it was relevant in every age but
[1:52:28] this age has particular
[1:52:33] significance we are dependent on God's
[1:52:36] forgiveness I cannot stand here this
[1:52:38] morning before you without God's
[1:52:41] forgiveness last week Sund brother was
[1:52:43] preaching he say he know
[1:52:49] to I know Isaac you know yourself
[1:52:54] no one could stand here and claim to be
[1:52:57] anybody because the same blood for you
[1:53:00] is the same blood for me without the
[1:53:02] blood I cannot say anything because I
[1:53:04] need the blood to speak better things
[1:53:06] for me than I what I can say for myself
[1:53:09] I need the voice of the blood to speak
[1:53:11] for
[1:53:13] me who am I to hold a grudge sometime
[1:53:16] ago but over preach people renewing
[1:53:17] their grudges
[1:53:22] the the The Grudge on a
[1:53:26] subscription until some you forget what
[1:53:28] The Grudge is
[1:53:29] for mama why we to talk to them again I
[1:53:32] can't remember you know I just know we
[1:53:33] to talk to
[1:53:37] them but within the
[1:53:40] prayer God is saying on a daily basis
[1:53:43] because you grow as a Christian by
[1:53:45] reading the word and praying every day
[1:53:47] and however you pray this here is a
[1:53:49] template that every day you're dying on
[1:53:52] to yourself and every day you're
[1:53:53] forgiven looking for God to release you
[1:53:56] and as you release others God releases
[1:54:00] you forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:54:05] our debtors and if you hold one ought
[1:54:08] but bam said you stand in danger of
[1:54:12] Hell's fire thank you just one just
[1:54:16] one you imagine you stand for this B all
[1:54:19] these years and you can't forgive one
[1:54:21] brother one sister one Deacon one Usher
[1:54:23] the pastor your wife your children your
[1:54:26] coworker your
[1:54:29] boss and you risking your life because
[1:54:31] you you want to
[1:54:35] forgive we still in the Lord's
[1:54:44] Prayer and that simple verse speaks of
[1:54:46] two kinds of forgiveness it speaks of
[1:54:48] God's forgiveness and it speaks of
[1:54:50] forgiveness towards one another amen and
[1:54:53] friends quite honestly if there was no
[1:54:56] nothing to offend or nothing to hurt or
[1:54:57] nothing to create conflict there'll be
[1:54:59] never situation for us to have issue
[1:55:00] with one
[1:55:02] another but God by Design you Lord
[1:55:06] allows
[1:55:07] situations so that we can express this
[1:55:10] thing and brother brandham taught us
[1:55:12] that the devil will test every
[1:55:14] virtue to see what stuff he really made
[1:55:16] up because that those virtues is the
[1:55:19] entire word image of God
[1:55:23] that's the being when complete will go
[1:55:25] into Rapture so you have to have it all
[1:55:28] can the church say Amen everybody
[1:55:30] feeling
[1:55:32] fine could you take some
[1:55:38] more and then the prayer goes
[1:55:44] on lead
[1:55:46] us not into temptation
[1:55:52] but Deliver
[1:55:54] Us from
[1:55:57] Evil that lead us not into
[1:56:01] temptation it's powerful and we'll get
[1:56:04] to it when we dealing with the
[1:56:06] seals but it speaks of a testing time
[1:56:10] and a certain kind of a test can the
[1:56:13] church say
[1:56:19] amen and Deliver Us from
[1:56:24] evil So within the prayer and and your
[1:56:27] daily prayer and we'll see it in the
[1:56:28] seal exactly what this prayer really
[1:56:29] means for us you're looking for God to
[1:56:32] Lord don't lead me into temptation don't
[1:56:34] lead me into a trial a situation a
[1:56:38] test and Deliver Me from all
[1:56:46] evil and then it ends with a
[1:56:50] declaration for thine is the
[1:56:53] kingdom kingdom is in power now and the
[1:56:57] power so by the time you reach this
[1:56:59] portion of the prayer this is full
[1:57:02] restoration for dine is the kingdom and
[1:57:05] the power and the
[1:57:07] glory
[1:57:09] forever can the church say
[1:57:13] Amen at the end of this prayer it speaks
[1:57:16] of God's kingdom fully
[1:57:20] restored it speaks of the kingdom with
[1:57:23] Christ as king over all the Earth it
[1:57:26] speaks of the full authority of God
[1:57:28] being displayed and it speaks of the
[1:57:31] bride and the groom
[1:57:33] glorified his kingdom coming into Power
[1:57:36] Daniel's Vision come into full
[1:57:39] manifestation can the church say Amen
[1:57:42] now I want to jump into a few things
[1:57:43] here now from the message of 7
[1:57:46] seal brother brandham said the breaking
[1:57:48] of their seal was so great as heaven was
[1:57:50] hushed
[1:57:53] there was nothing thing move for half an
[1:57:55] hour but in the suspense of between
[1:57:58] death and life it seemed like a
[1:57:59] millennium it was so great Jesus never
[1:58:02] mentioned it none of the rest of them
[1:58:04] John couldn't even write it he was
[1:58:05] forbidden to write it can the church say
[1:58:08] Amen we're building into something the
[1:58:10] 420 Elders have stood and goes and
[1:58:13] breaks out the whole drama of
[1:58:19] itl let me skip through a few things
[1:58:21] here
[1:58:24] hallu God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:58:27] secret he kept it a secret nobody know
[1:58:29] nothing about it even the angels didn't
[1:58:32] understand it he didn't reveal it that's
[1:58:34] the reason under our seven mystery when
[1:58:36] the seven seal was open there was
[1:58:37] silence so all of this is painting a
[1:58:40] picture of the importance of the
[1:58:41] ministry of the prophet and the
[1:58:44] importance of the breaking of the seals
[1:58:46] and the re revelation of this mystery to
[1:58:49] us a voice to break the silence and
[1:58:52] brother Bram taught us a seal is a
[1:58:54] finished work and a seal signifies
[1:58:57] approval and the seal is necessary to
[1:58:59] protect what's inside and we know the
[1:59:01] seventh seals was that book of
[1:59:04] redemption it was tied up in those seals
[1:59:06] and when you open a seal to look at the
[1:59:09] contents you could know what's happening
[1:59:10] under the seal now the first seal to the
[1:59:14] fourth seal identifies how Satan
[1:59:17] infiltrated the church with the
[1:59:19] Antichrist Spirit everybody with me four
[1:59:22] Riders the White Horse red horse black
[1:59:25] horse Pale Horse we're going to do a
[1:59:27] little teaching here some of you will
[1:59:28] know it some of you it's a reminder to
[1:59:31] you but even though Satan caused havoc
[1:59:34] in the church God still did a work of
[1:59:37] redemption and in every age even though
[1:59:39] these Riders were riding through the
[1:59:41] ages God still call upride and God send
[1:59:45] forth a lion ox man and an eagle to deal
[1:59:49] with these Riders can the church say
[1:59:50] Amen this great drama of God being
[1:59:54] unfolded as he opened each seal and when
[1:59:57] he opened the fifth seal we see another
[1:59:58] work of redemption a work of redemption
[2:00:00] for the Jews and The Sixth Seal we know
[2:00:03] is a judgment seal the judgment to come
[2:00:06] but when he opened the seventh seal
[2:00:07] there was
[2:00:08] silence a mystery under there Satan
[2:00:12] don't know what's there Hallelujah the
[2:00:14] invisible God doing a work in secret
[2:00:17] because if he reveal it the devil could
[2:00:19] do
[2:00:20] damage and Satan is because he doesn't
[2:00:22] know the mystery of how you going to get
[2:00:24] into Power how you going to move from
[2:00:26] the altar of having to pray all the way
[2:00:29] to your throne of power moving into your
[2:00:31] full position as a royal priest can the
[2:00:33] church say
[2:00:35] Amen every seal had a
[2:00:37] symbol but the seven seal itself is
[2:00:40] Christ the lord himself he sending with
[2:00:42] a shout voice Trump Hallelujah could it
[2:00:45] be that you and I are the living symbol
[2:00:48] of the seventh seal to take us back to
[2:00:50] Eden back to the spoken word each seal
[2:00:54] had a word had a history had a age had a
[2:00:58] vision had a people the first to the
[2:01:01] four seals had their age and the history
[2:01:04] it was the church ages the fifth seal
[2:01:06] has the age of the Jews the six seal has
[2:01:09] a age which is the
[2:01:13] Tribulation the six seal will have a
[2:01:15] history or a time three and A2 years but
[2:01:18] the seven seal since the prophet left we
[2:01:21] have been feasting under the of the
[2:01:24] under under the hidden manner under the
[2:01:26] seven
[2:01:27] seal the seven seal as a age we are in
[2:01:30] the bride age the age of the seven seal
[2:01:32] and hidden under silence every mystery
[2:01:35] being unfolded say is a time for the
[2:01:37] bride to break the Silence from under
[2:01:39] the seven
[2:01:42] seal and it could it be that the mystery
[2:01:44] of God of all ages was locked up through
[2:01:47] that Lord's Prayer when God said Deliver
[2:01:49] Us from Evil this is not just smoking
[2:01:51] and drinking but is the evil one
[2:01:53] himself Deliver Us From Time Deliver us
[2:01:57] from sin Deliver Us from sickness
[2:01:59] Deliver Us from unbelief Deliver Us from
[2:02:01] all
[2:02:04] evil Adam had lost the book this book of
[2:02:08] redemption Adam lost it Satan tried to
[2:02:10] grab it but that book of redemption went
[2:02:13] back into the hands of the original
[2:02:16] owner only a certain hand could hold
[2:02:19] that book
[2:02:22] and John was weeping because there was
[2:02:24] nobody found worthy to even touch it or
[2:02:27] even look upon it and they cried out
[2:02:29] Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[2:02:32] Judah the royal king and there to a lamb
[2:02:37] Hallelujah and that lamb stepped forward
[2:02:40] and John could shout because he knew
[2:02:42] that the silence was about to
[2:02:44] break the breaking of the seals to
[2:02:47] reveal the secret Plan of Redemption can
[2:02:50] the Church Say Amen
[2:02:54] Hallelujah Glory
[2:02:57] Hallelujah everybody feeling fine we are
[2:03:01] more than conquerors this morning do you
[2:03:03] know who you
[2:03:05] are could you take some more now I want
[2:03:08] to do something here
[2:03:12] now we started in Genesis we started
[2:03:16] with the perfect will of God on Heaven
[2:03:17] and on Earth we started with man falling
[2:03:20] out of position we started with man not
[2:03:22] needing to pray and then prayer becoming
[2:03:24] a requirement because man communication
[2:03:26] with God was broken we talked about
[2:03:28] Jesus coming on the earth king priest
[2:03:31] Prophet sacrifice to restore the
[2:03:33] connection we talk about Jesus Christ
[2:03:35] dying because the lamb slain was the
[2:03:37] only one who could take the
[2:03:40] book and we talk about he giv them a
[2:03:43] blueprint brother cence of a prayer that
[2:03:46] would withstand time or withstand ages
[2:03:48] it will work in the first age it will
[2:03:50] work in the second age work in the third
[2:03:52] Agee and work in the last age can the
[2:03:53] church say
[2:03:59] Amen now the Seven
[2:04:03] Seals brother bam showed us the seven
[2:04:06] Mysteries unfolding God's Redemptive
[2:04:16] plan Revelation
[2:04:19] 6 and I saw when the lamb open one of
[2:04:21] the the seals and I heard as it word a
[2:04:23] noise of Thunder one of the Forbe saying
[2:04:25] come and see and I saw Behold a white
[2:04:29] horse and he that sat on him had a bow
[2:04:30] and a crown was given unto him and he
[2:04:32] went forth
[2:04:34] conquering and to
[2:04:40] conquer and but manam
[2:04:42] identified this first Rider as the
[2:04:49] Antichrist that started riding through
[2:04:51] the first church
[2:04:54] age and M brandham taught us that this
[2:04:56] Antichrist Spirit began as a deception
[2:04:58] in the early church with the nickan
[2:05:02] influence and what this what did this
[2:05:05] nickan influence bring it actually
[2:05:07] brought a false
[2:05:11] fatherhood everybody with me in so much
[2:05:15] that we started to call for the Holy
[2:05:16] Father because that is where paple Rome
[2:05:19] started to
[2:05:20] form so when Jesus is now giving this
[2:05:23] Lord's Prayer The Lord's Prayer starts
[2:05:26] actually dealing with the deception of
[2:05:29] the first
[2:05:30] seal because those who were caught under
[2:05:33] that age of the first seal were being
[2:05:35] deceived into paple Holy
[2:05:40] Father fake
[2:05:42] father so when Jesus saying Our Father
[2:05:45] which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[2:05:49] this was now ammunition
[2:05:52] to deal with that first horse
[2:05:54] rider that was bringing deception to
[2:05:56] introduce a different
[2:05:59] fatherhood so the Lord's Prayer had in
[2:06:02] it a secret as it were to deal with the
[2:06:05] deception of the first
[2:06:08] seal the Antichrist Spirit under the
[2:06:11] first seal was trying to overcome God's
[2:06:14] position and receive worship as a Holy
[2:06:17] Father so here it is the Lord in the
[2:06:20] Lord's Prayer is given a weapon for the
[2:06:22] first seal Our Father which art in
[2:06:25] heaven Hallowed be thy name and that
[2:06:28] first horse rider trying to bring a Holy
[2:06:31] Father Pap Rome that prayer dealt with
[2:06:33] that father dealt with that horse rider
[2:06:36] come on
[2:06:43] now everybody with me can the church say
[2:06:50] amen I when he opened the second seal I
[2:06:52] heard the second beast say come and see
[2:06:54] and they went on another horse that was
[2:06:56] red and power was given to him and sat
[2:06:58] thereon to take pre peace from the earth
[2:07:00] and that they should kill one another
[2:07:02] and they were given unto him a great
[2:07:05] sword look at the mystery of God
[2:07:08] unfolding Jesus is actually speaking
[2:07:11] about all the church ages and all the
[2:07:12] seals in the Lord's
[2:07:14] Prayer because amidst this shift brother
[2:07:18] brandham calls it of the rider coming
[2:07:20] off of the White Horse to go onto the
[2:07:23] red horse but the BAM said now here is
[2:07:25] my revelation of it this is Satan again
[2:07:27] it's the devil again in another form he
[2:07:30] dropped his bow he got off his White
[2:07:31] Horse he got on his red horse for he can
[2:07:33] kill anybody that don't agree with him
[2:07:35] there's your
[2:07:37] seal so when Jesus said diey Kingdom
[2:07:44] Come prise God what began as deceit on
[2:07:48] the White Horse became open violence
[2:07:50] Under the Red Horse
[2:07:52] W and by the Bron revealed that the
[2:07:54] Antichrist Spirit under the second seal
[2:07:57] was uniting church and state to create a
[2:08:00] false
[2:08:01] Kingdom so in response to the red horse
[2:08:06] creating a false Kingdom he is Jesus
[2:08:08] saying thy kingdom
[2:08:12] come so within the Lord's Prayer the
[2:08:15] Lord pread deal with the White Horse the
[2:08:17] Lord's prad deal with the red horse
[2:08:19] anybody with me this morning
[2:08:27] thy kingdom come stands at a bold
[2:08:30] declaration as the false church was
[2:08:33] rising up under that red horse rider as
[2:08:37] it were the falsehood rais a sword there
[2:08:39] was a kingdom that was being established
[2:08:42] and in the face of that kingdom here is
[2:08:44] the voice in The Lord's Prayer declaring
[2:08:46] thy kingdom come there's no other
[2:08:49] Kingdom that can match his kingdom it
[2:08:51] doesn't matter what they do the second
[2:08:53] seal showed a kingdom being formed which
[2:08:56] is church and state but the bom taught
[2:08:57] us
[2:08:59] that by the time we reach the third seal
[2:09:02] what was it a black
[2:09:03] horse
[2:09:05] balancing with a but balances in his
[2:09:07] hand the Bible says a measure of weed
[2:09:09] for a penny and three measures of barley
[2:09:11] for a penny and so forth and what was it
[2:09:13] brother random typed this out as the
[2:09:15] will of man being expressed this was
[2:09:17] paple Rome expressing the will of man
[2:09:20] with how you're supposed to go to heaven
[2:09:21] and all these things isn't that right
[2:09:24] what does your Lord's Prayer have thy
[2:09:26] will be done on Earth as it is in
[2:09:30] heaven so that Rider tried to bring
[2:09:33] man's will as established and God is
[2:09:35] saying not man's
[2:09:37] will but thy will be done on Earth as it
[2:09:39] is in heaven the will of man with how he
[2:09:42] supposed to be saved God deals with that
[2:09:44] Rider can the church say Amen oh
[2:09:48] Hallelujah in that age but the brandom T
[2:09:51] the age of great
[2:09:52] hunger as they held back the wheat from
[2:09:55] the people as it were can the church say
[2:09:58] Amen the Believers had little access to
[2:09:59] the Bible we know these
[2:10:01] things by the time we come to the fourth
[2:10:04] seal what was it the Pale Horse butam
[2:10:06] said that Pale Horse was wrapped up in
[2:10:07] him all the other
[2:10:09] horses and that rider was
[2:10:13] dead and what did God give us as a
[2:10:16] response to death in The Lord's Prayer
[2:10:17] he said give us this day our daily
[2:10:20] bread because in that age of death is
[2:10:22] not just natural that is spiritual death
[2:10:24] famine in the land death in the land and
[2:10:26] in the midst of that as a response to
[2:10:28] that those in that age could say give us
[2:10:30] is there our daily bread and they could
[2:10:32] have life and sustenance away from what
[2:10:34] the devil was doing can the church say
[2:10:36] Amen we see the unfolding of God can the
[2:10:39] church say amen
[2:10:44] glory when he opened the fifth seal what
[2:10:46] was it Jews under the altar crying out
[2:10:49] for what for
[2:10:53] vengeance the next part of the prayer
[2:10:55] actually says about
[2:10:59] forgiveness because those Jews could
[2:11:01] only cry for vengeance because they
[2:11:03] hadn't received
[2:11:04] Christ but receiving Christ's Ministry
[2:11:06] would give you a Ministry of forgiveness
[2:11:08] but yet still they were true so God
[2:11:10] would actually still do a work of
[2:11:12] redemption with the Jews but the
[2:11:14] connection there is still that Ministry
[2:11:16] of forgiveness and
[2:11:19] Reconciliation can the church say amen
[2:11:22] glory everybody feeling fine I'm almost
[2:11:26] done and the six seal what is it it's a
[2:11:29] judgment
[2:11:31] seal and I beheld when he had opened a
[2:11:33] sick seal and lo there was a great
[2:11:35] earthquake and the sun became black a
[2:11:37] sackcloth of hair and moon became as
[2:11:39] blood and the stars of Heaven fell under
[2:11:40] the Earth even as a fig tree casted her
[2:11:42] untimely figs when she was shaken of A
[2:11:45] Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a
[2:11:47] scroll when it was rolled together and
[2:11:49] every mountain and Island will move out
[2:11:51] to the their places and the kings of the
[2:11:53] earth and the great men and the rich men
[2:11:55] and the chief captains and the Mighty
[2:11:57] Men And every Bor man and every free man
[2:12:00] hid themselves in the dens and in the
[2:12:02] rocks of the mountains and said to the
[2:12:05] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[2:12:07] us from the face of him that sited on
[2:12:09] the throne and from the Wrath of the
[2:12:11] lamb from the great day of his wrath is
[2:12:13] come who shall be able to
[2:12:18] stand the Judgment seal
[2:12:25] and in the Lord's Prayer the next part
[2:12:28] of the say lead us not into this
[2:12:31] temptation in other words this prayer
[2:12:33] actually means Lord don't I don't want
[2:12:35] to see the tribulation or
[2:12:38] know don't take me down this road not
[2:12:41] this Tes in other words we are being
[2:12:43] taught that we have to pray Lord
[2:12:45] whatever I need to do I don't want to
[2:12:46] make that I don't want to be in that
[2:12:49] that's not my portion
[2:12:53] so the Lord's Prayer is actually saying

[2:14:21] because the Bible say but asking God a
[2:14:23] Miss we asking God for all kind of

[2:14:33] lead us not into temptation ask for him
[2:14:36] to deliver you from evil ask for him to

[2:15:03] place under any condition with a
[2:15:05] revelation of who you are and with all
[2:15:08] of this food value how desperate ought
[2:15:11] we to be to know who God is to know all
[2:15:14] about he say when we reach up there we
[2:15:16] should know all about him his nature his
[2:15:18] being his attributes that should give us
[2:15:21] a reason to shout and praise God like
[2:15:23] never before because we are children of
[2:15:25] the most high God and we are called for

[2:33:57] this service this day plenty with what

[2:34:02] brother Isaac has God has blessed him to
[2:34:04] be traveling this little season here and
[2:34:07] get more more experiences of what God's
[2:34:10] love and the commitment of the Believers
[2:34:12] all around how they love the Lord and
[2:34:14] they're seeking after God the same devil
[2:34:15] fighting them fighting you fighting us
[2:34:19] and we have have to fight for one
[2:34:20] another pray for one another and pull up
[2:34:23] one another not to beat down somebody
[2:34:26] your candle lightting brighter doesn't
[2:34:28] mean that you want to out somebody light
[2:34:30] to make your candle light bright you
[2:34:31] want to help somebody light up you want
[2:34:34] to encourage somebody you want to pick
[2:34:36] them up there's so much negative all
[2:34:38] around and that's why God bring these
[2:34:40] things that you could see it clearly why
[2:34:42] he could justify us why because it is
[2:34:45] Adam and Eve's fault that's why we are
[2:34:47] here why we are great here that why we
[2:34:49] we have sorrow that where we have debt
[2:34:51] that where we have crying because of
[2:34:52] Adam and Eve if Adam and Eve did not
[2:34:54] fall we was going to be in a perfect
[2:34:56] State as Sons and Daughters of God am so
[2:34:58] God in bringing this whole Plan of
[2:35:00] Redemption he could bring us back to
[2:35:02] full justification as if we never did it
[2:35:06] now you as a finite person a human
[2:35:08] person remember all what you have done
[2:35:10] but God said he doesn't remember you
[2:35:13] because he has a sea of forgetfulness
[2:35:16] now if he does remember it why should I
[2:35:18] hold it against you
[2:35:20] doesn't make any sense because he's the
[2:35:23] boss he's in charge I want I think about
[2:35:26] if he doesn't remember it why should I
[2:35:28] hold it against you so it is important
[2:35:32] because faith is based upon forgiveness
[2:35:34] you guys what people feel of they have
[2:35:36] faith and what they have no faith if
[2:35:37] they the big old grud grud so big
[2:35:40] pumping out their
[2:35:42] skin pumping out the mouth every time

[2:35:47] Grudge talking they are Grudge it's like
[2:35:49] grud speak have a voice you have to drop
[2:35:52] it you have to let it go it's like your
