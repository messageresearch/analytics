[35:32] are meeting, Lord, with the awesome,
[35:34] wonderful God, creator of heaven and
[35:36] earth. Lord, how you loved us, Lord. You
[35:39] give us your word to live by and to live
[35:42] in us, Lord Jesus, by your word and by
[35:44] your spirit. Lord, help us tonight. We
[35:47] are in great need of you, Lord. Father,
[35:50] we are a fallen race of people. And
[35:53] Lord, we admit tonight how much we need
[35:55] you, Lord. Your need. We need your
[35:57] guidance in this hour. We need your hand
[35:59] of mercy in this hour. Minister to us by
[36:02] the word tonight. Lord, give us a
[36:05] helping hand, Lord, for we need it so
[36:07] much tonight. Minister to our hearts, to
[36:09] our lives. Help us in some way, Lord.
[36:12] And just for the next few moments, would
[36:14] you just raise us up, Lord? May the
[36:16] spirit of God come and anoint the word
[36:18] and make it live, Lord, and make it uh
[36:21] uh Lord, fortify our hearts as it were,
[36:24] Lord, to uh to to fight the battle, to
[36:28] fight the good fight of faith in these
[36:30] last days that we're living in. Lord, we
[36:32] see what's coming upon the earth. Lord,
[36:34] may you equip your people with the power
[36:36] of your Holy Spirit, with your word
[36:38] living in us, oh God. Grant it, almighty
[36:40] God. Take charge now. Have your way,
[36:42] Lord, Father, in this service. We commit
[36:44] it into your hands, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[36:46] And amen.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; For a title tonight,
[36:59] there is a bomb in Gilead.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; There is a bomb in Gilead.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; That's our title tonight.
[37:12] And it was so interesting to what was
[37:14] preached on Sunday uh or what the tape
[37:17] what you heard rather uh living under
[37:20] the inspiration
[37:22] of the Holy Spirit
[37:24] &gt;&gt; and uh you know I just knew that I just
[37:27] felt it was right tonight to come with
[37:28] this coming behind that message and so
[37:31] that uh we just want to see what God
[37:33] will do for us tonight. Amen.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; But there is a bomb in Gilead.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's our title tonight.
[37:42] I think it's pretty obvious at this
[37:44] point
[37:46] that when we look around at the world
[37:48] today,
[37:50] we see that we live in a sick world.
[37:55] The world is full of sick people.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Everywhere is sickness.
[38:03] Mankind himself
[38:05] is in a sick condition.
[38:08] He's in a need of healing.
[38:11] Healing for his mind, his body, his
[38:14] soul.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; The whole system is corrupt
[38:19] &gt;&gt; to begin with.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Man himself is in a fallen condition.
[38:25] This version of man that we know,
[38:28] that we are familiar with on a
[38:30] day-to-day basis, this man that we
[38:32] interact with, men and women are all in
[38:36] a sick condition.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; They are in a fallen condition.
[38:42] Men and women are shriveled and a
[38:43] deformed version of what we were meant
[38:46] to be.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; We might look normal on the outside, but
[38:51] on the inside we are ailing.
[38:54] there's something wrong with us.
[38:57] You might not think that, but that is
[38:59] because we get used to this going to
[39:02] work and coming home and paying the
[39:04] bills and doing what we do. But this is
[39:07] not how it was meant to be.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; When God made man in the beginning, he
[39:12] made a perfect man.
[39:14] And he placed that perfect man in the
[39:16] garden of Eden in a perfect garden, in a
[39:19] perfect atmosphere, and told that man to
[39:22] eat of every fruit of every tree, but
[39:25] that fruit of good and evil toucheth
[39:27] not.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; And as long as man stayed within the
[39:30] obedience of God, within the will of
[39:32] God, he was in a perfect condition.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; But something happened back there.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Something took place back
[39:40] there that caused us to be in this
[39:43] current condition that we're in. The
[39:46] glory that was once upon man's life and
[39:49] crowned creation and man and man in his
[39:52] position and Adam in his in his Eden
[39:55] state, that whole thing was erased.
[39:58] We ended up with a very twisted and
[40:01] broken and and warped idea of reality.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; This is not what it was intended to be.
[40:08] Hallelujah.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; We were not supposed to be born in sin.
[40:12] We were not supposed to come into the
[40:13] world speaking lies. But that is our
[40:16] reality tonight. We are all sick.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; We are all in need of healing.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; We [snorts] are all in need of
[40:26] deliverance.
[40:27] No matter how polished you might find
[40:30] someone or what kind of a good
[40:31] background or doesn't matter whether
[40:33] someone didn't spit on the sidewalk or
[40:36] whether they had grown up right, done
[40:38] all the commandments, right? There was
[40:40] once such a man who met Jesus. He said,
[40:43] "Lord, I have obeyed all of my
[40:45] commandments to my from my youth up
[40:48] until now." But he knew within himself
[40:51] that he lacked something. And even
[40:53] though he went to the Pharisees, they
[40:56] could give him an answer. Even though he
[40:58] went to the Sadducees, they had no
[41:01] answer to give him. But yet, he knew
[41:03] within himself that he lacked something.
[41:06] He knew within himself that he was not
[41:08] good enough. There was something about
[41:10] him that needed fixing. There was
[41:12] something about him that needed to be
[41:14] addressed. There was something about him
[41:16] that needed healing, but he didn't know
[41:18] nothing about it. He didn't know how to
[41:20] diagnose the problem. He didn't know how
[41:22] to fix his sickness. He didn't know how
[41:25] to cure his disease. He just knew that
[41:28] there was something that he lacked
[41:30] &gt;&gt; and he knew that there was a great
[41:32] teacher in town. And so he decided to
[41:34] come up to Jesus and he said, "What lack
[41:36] I yet?" And the Bible said that at that
[41:40] moment Jesus loved him. The love of God
[41:44] come down for that man, that that rich
[41:46] young ruler. And he said, "Go and take
[41:49] all that you have and sell it to the
[41:52] poor and take up your cross and follow
[41:56] after me." Oh, forget about all that you
[41:59] have. He discerned the spirit that was
[42:01] in that young man. Even though he was
[42:04] dressed right, he was looking right. He
[42:06] was smelling right. He was doing all the
[42:08] right things. He was giving his money to
[42:10] the poor. He was doing this and doing
[42:12] that, but there was something he liked.
[42:15] He had a money spirit upon him. He He
[42:18] worshiped his assets. He worshiped the
[42:20] things that he had and he loved what he
[42:23] had and he enjoyed what he had. And God
[42:26] said, "You can't go on with that in you.
[42:28] You've got to sell all that you have."
[42:31] And this gospel that we have received in
[42:33] this last day requires us tonight to
[42:36] sell all that we have. We can't risk
[42:39] keeping anything that would separate us
[42:42] from our God. Tonight, we got to make
[42:45] our calling and election sure. Tonight,
[42:48] we've got to make sure that we make it
[42:50] in. Yes, sir.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; We've got to have all the pieces in
[42:53] place.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; We've got to cure, find a cure, find an
[42:57] ailment
[42:59] &gt;&gt; for your sickness.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Tonight, we come to hear the truth.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And the truth is that we are in a in a
[43:06] condition tonight
[43:08] &gt;&gt; and that we need help.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; I know I need it.
[43:13] I know that many others need it tonight.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; We didn't come here because we all
[43:17] right. We come here because we have a
[43:19] need.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And we know that there is a man in here
[43:22] tonight who can touch us at the point of
[43:25] our need.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; We know there's a man in here who can
[43:28] fix problems that we can't fix. We know
[43:31] there's a man in here who can do things
[43:32] that we cannot do. There's a man in here
[43:35] tonight who is able to heal the sick
[43:38] among us. There's a man in here tonight
[43:41] who can raise the dead, who can cast out
[43:43] devils. There is a man in here tonight
[43:46] &gt;&gt; who's got something oh that the world
[43:49] cannot give
[43:51] &gt;&gt; and that is a man we are seeking
[43:53] tonight.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; The man called Jesus Christ.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; He's still as alive today as he ever was
[43:59] tonight.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; As when he had walked the streets of
[44:02] Galilee,
[44:03] &gt;&gt; he's still alive tonight. And
[44:06] &gt;&gt; we believe his spirit is here with us
[44:08] tonight
[44:10] &gt;&gt; to minister to us.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; There is a bomb in Gilead tonight.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. There is a physician
[44:18] there.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; He is a great physician.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Oh that knows
[44:24] &gt;&gt; everything that's wrong with you.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; He can fix it tonight. He can help you
[44:30] tonight.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; We hardly have enough faith for divine
[44:34] healing.
[44:36] much more faith that we need for the
[44:37] rapture.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Which means we need a greater greater
[44:41] measure of faith. We need something
[44:43] greater than just divine healing. Divine
[44:46] healing is just a fraction of what we
[44:48] need to change our bodies and to change
[44:52] us from this mortal into immortality. We
[44:55] need more more of that power, more of
[44:57] that glory, more of that healing flow to
[45:01] change this mortal into immortality.
[45:05] Paul said in a moment, in a twinkling of
[45:07] an eye, we'll be changed. What kind of
[45:10] power is about to be released upon the
[45:12] church in the last days? Oh, hallelujah.
[45:16] We've got to have faith for that
[45:17] tonight, friends. And God, send us a
[45:20] prophet. Oh, God, send a message on the
[45:23] earth to give us that faith tonight.
[45:26] SEVEN THUNDERS GIVE FAITH FOR RAPTURE in
[45:30] grace. It is the rapture in grace of the
[45:33] church. Seven thunders have been sent
[45:36] out uh throughout all the earth. Uh oh
[45:40] hallelujah. Seven spirits which are the
[45:43] seven eyes, seven horns which are the
[45:46] seven spirits of God sent all throughout
[45:49] all the earth to FIND YOU TO FIND ME to
[45:53] block YOU OUT OF LAIA.
[45:56] to pull you out of darkness, to pull you
[45:59] out of chaos, to pull you out of
[46:01] confusion, to pull you out OF YOUR SICK
[46:04] CONDITION. There is a bomb in Gileia
[46:07] tonight. AND THAT BOMB IS HERE. THAT
[46:10] PALM IS A manifested reality. Oh, out of
[46:14] a vindicated voice word, an abiding
[46:17] shakina glory. That same Jesus, oh, the
[46:22] spirit that dwelt in him, that is the
[46:24] bomb tonight. And he is here to touch
[46:26] you. He is here to heal you. He is here
[46:29] to deliver you. He is here to restore
[46:31] you. He is here to discern the thoughts
[46:34] and intents of your heart. He's here to
[46:37] go past your flesh. GO PAST THE BONE and
[46:40] the marrow. Go past your mind. Go past
[46:43] your spirit and see your FRACTURED SOUL
[46:47] UH AND see what he can do about it. Only
[46:50] God can fix it. ONLY GOD CAN HEAL IT.
[46:53] Only God can deliver you. Oh, there's
[46:56] things that the DOCTORS CAN'T DO.
[46:58] THERE'S things that man has reached
[47:00] their end. When man has reached the end
[47:03] of their road, THEN GOD IS JUST ABOUT TO
[47:06] GET STARTED. GOD IS JUST ABOUT TO GET
[47:08] FIXED. HALLELUJAH. OH, HALLELUJAH. When
[47:11] the world gives up, when they throw
[47:14] their hands in the air and they have no
[47:16] more answer, they have no more cure.
[47:19] They have no more remedy. They have no
[47:21] more balm. No more bomb to soothe your
[47:24] aches and to soothe your hurts. I COME
[47:27] WITH A MESSAGE TONIGHT TO TELL YOU that
[47:29] there is [screaming] a bomb in Gileian.
[47:32] There is a physician there. Oh,
[47:36] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, you might be
[47:39] in a spiritual ICU tonight. Uh but God
[47:43] never gives up on his patience. Oh, you
[47:46] might be in a spiritual condition. You
[47:48] might be torn. Uh, you might be
[47:50] fractured. You might be broken, but
[47:53] there's nothing God can do. There's
[47:56] nothing I've seen him not do. Oh, eyes
[47:59] are upon Jesus tonight. Our eyes are
[48:02] fixed upon him. Oh, [screaming]
[48:05] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:08] Oh,
[48:10] hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's going to do
[48:12] something in this world, something in
[48:15] this message, something in this church,
[48:18] uh something in your life. Uh you're
[48:20] going to pass through one way and come
[48:22] out a next. Uh you're going to go in
[48:25] broken and come out heal. You're going
[48:28] to go in halfway and come out whole. Oh,
[48:32] he touched me. Oh, he touched me and he
[48:36] made me whole. Oh, hallelujah. That's
[48:39] what the bomb of Gilead can do.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Do you believe it
[48:44] tonight?
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, every day we need help.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Every day we in a broken condition
[48:54] &gt;&gt; and is only by his grace that he is
[48:56] fixing us,
[48:58] &gt;&gt; mending us,
[49:00] breaking uh bringing us back uh to a
[49:03] place of restoration.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Only he is able to do that kind of a
[49:08] work.
[49:12] The
[49:13] &gt;&gt; government can't do it.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Prisons can't fix the crime problem.
[49:18] They just holding crime, criminal
[49:21] spirits for a time and a season until
[49:24] the law has to let them go and they back
[49:26] out on the streets again doing the same
[49:29] things they did when they came back in.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; It didn't fix the problem. They they
[49:33] tried to reform them. They tried to to
[49:36] bring them back into society to make
[49:38] them meaningful contributors of society.
[49:41] But only God could transform a life.
[49:44] Only God could change a soul. Only God
[49:48] could change your walk. Only God could
[49:50] change your talk. Oh, hallelujah.
[49:53] Hallelujah. People come and say, "Oh, I
[49:55] just slipped up. I I just made a
[49:57] mistake. It won't happen again." Yes, it
[49:59] will. Humans are habitual. Humans have
[50:03] patterns of behavior that they can't
[50:06] break. It takes God to change a man. It
[50:09] takes God to change a human heart. It
[50:12] takes divine intervention to break in on
[50:15] you. We couldn't save ourselves. But
[50:17] something along the way. We were born in
[50:20] sin. We were coming up through how we
[50:22] come up. We grow up in different homes
[50:24] and different families and we come
[50:26] through different situations and
[50:28] different things hurt us. Different
[50:30] people hurt us. But it took God to help
[50:33] us in our point of need. It took God to
[50:36] intervene on our behalf. It took God to
[50:39] step in in our path and stop us on our
[50:42] way to hell. He came in the way and
[50:45] stopped us while we were on our way to
[50:47] hell. God stopped us in our tracks and
[50:50] said, "No, no." MERCY SAID, "NO, I'M NOT
[50:54] GOING TO LET YOU GO. I'm not going to
[50:56] give up on you. I'm not going to let you
[50:59] slip out of my hands like grains of
[51:02] sand. No, no, no. But I'm here to keep
[51:05] you. I'm here to take you. I'm here to
[51:08] nurture you. I'm here to encourage you.
[51:11] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm here to
[51:13] show you a better way. Oh, hallelujah.
[51:17] Isn't that right?
[51:19] So in this passage of scripture in
[51:21] Jeremiah 8 that we just read,
[51:24] &gt;&gt; God is using the words of Jeremiah the
[51:27] prophet to speak to the children of
[51:29] Judah.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; And in this scenario, the children of
[51:33] Judah are actually falling away. They
[51:36] are going through a decline, a decline
[51:39] of their own society and a spiritual
[51:42] decline in their kingdom. Their hearts
[51:45] are falling further and further away
[51:47] from the Lord.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; This is the condition of the people that
[51:51] are in this context of the scripture
[51:54] where we find God referencing this bomb
[51:57] of Gilead.
[51:59] And whenever God's people begin to get
[52:01] into trouble, God always sends a word of
[52:06] warning.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[52:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, William Brandham,
[52:10] said, "God always warns a man before he
[52:13] judges him. Isn't that right?
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Before God releases his judgment upon
[52:18] the people or unleashes his judgment, he
[52:21] always sends things are not happening
[52:23] the way they should.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; That people aren't as fervent as they
[52:28] should be.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; When people aren't walking the straight
[52:31] and narrow as they should be, brother
[52:34] Abraham said, God always asks the
[52:36] question, why?
[52:38] Why aren't the people healed? Why aren't
[52:42] the people delivered?
[52:44] Why are people so tossed about in this
[52:47] message when God gave a message through
[52:49] a prophet? Why are the people preaching
[52:52] strange things and leaning towards
[52:54] strange doctrines and saying strange
[52:57] things? Why after all these years when
[53:00] we supposed to have clarity in the
[53:02] message? Why are people so tossed about
[53:06] and so driven this way and that? Oh,
[53:09] hallelujah. Why are they not worshiping
[53:11] God? Why are people not praying? Why are
[53:14] people not on fire? Why are people not
[53:17] asking for the Holy Ghost? Why are
[53:19] people not burning? Why are people not
[53:22] praying without ceasing until every one
[53:24] of these virtues are living in them? Uh
[53:27] when God's prophet told them in the
[53:30] stature of a perfect manuh that we ought
[53:32] to pray without ceasing until everyone
[53:35] of these virtues are living in you.
[53:38] That's what we are supposed to be in.
[53:40] That kind of an atmosphere. Oh, for the
[53:43] coming of the Lord. Oh, is close at
[53:45] hand. We know that the time is at hand
[53:48] for the Holy Ghost to pour out upon the
[53:50] church. We know the time is at hand for
[53:53] America to be bombed up. WE KNOW THE
[53:56] TIME IS AT hand for Los Angeles TO SLIDE
[53:58] IN. WE ARE not waiting ON CONDITIONS TO
[54:02] MAKE US DESPERATE. But we see the love
[54:05] of God expressed to us in his word. And
[54:08] that alone ought to make us desperate
[54:11] tonight. To make a conference with this
[54:14] God of the Bible to seek the Lord while
[54:17] he may be found. UH AND CALL UPON HIS
[54:20] NAME uh while he is near. And let the
[54:23] wicked forsake his way. AND LET THE
[54:26] UNRIGHTEOUS MAN FORSAKE HIS THOUGHTS UH
[54:29] AND RETURN unto the Lord. Uh [screaming]
[54:32] oh, that's what we need tonight. THAT'S
[54:34] WHAT WE NEED IN THE MESSAGE. That's what
[54:36] we need in this hour to return unto the
[54:40] Lord. Why? BECAUSE THERE IS A BOMB IN
[54:42] GILEAD. There is a physician there. Oh,
[54:46] hallelujah. Who can touch the
[54:47] brokenhearted? Oh, he can heal you
[54:51] &gt;&gt; and bind up your wounds.
[54:54] Oh, hallelujah. that he is able to do it
[54:57] tonight.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; He can minister to you.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; So God is warning the people.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? And in this
[55:10] passage of scripture, God is actually
[55:12] asking a rhetorical question.
[55:15] It's not like it necessarily needs an
[55:17] answer. It's a question that doesn't
[55:19] really need an answer because the answer
[55:21] is an obvious response.
[55:23] Is there a bomb in Gilead? And the
[55:27] reason the people are not healed
[55:29] physically is because they haven't
[55:31] sought the remedy. It's because they
[55:34] haven't sought a cure. Is the reason
[55:36] because they haven't sought a balm for
[55:38] what ails them.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; But this cry is not about a physical
[55:43] healing. What God is asking about is
[55:46] about a spiritual condition. And God is
[55:49] saying, "I have a spiritual remedy to
[55:52] perform. Spiritual restoration for your
[55:55] spiritual brokenness for your spiritual
[55:58] twistedness, for your spiritual lack. I
[56:01] have an answer. I have a cure. I have a
[56:05] bomb. I have a remedy." Brother
[56:08] Brandham, call it the toxin. Oh,
[56:10] hallelujah. God give a toxin. Oh, an
[56:13] inoculation. Lord, to help you with what
[56:16] ails you, to help you with what you're
[56:18] struggling with, you're struggling to
[56:20] pray, struggling to believe God,
[56:23] struggling to stand on your own two
[56:25] feet. Oh, but God wants to put something
[56:28] in you tonight to cure what ails you, to
[56:32] cure your sickness, to cure what's in
[56:35] your heart, to fix what's wrong in
[56:37] there. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:45] God is crying out to the people.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Is there not a bomb in Gilead?
[56:51] &gt;&gt; People put so much confidence in a
[56:53] doctor,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; they will quicker take a tablet. Praise
[56:57] God. Isn't that right?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They have so much
[57:00] confidence. If they have a headache,
[57:02] they take a tablet.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; If they have a sore throat, they'll chew
[57:06] some ginger. But God is saying, "I have
[57:09] an answer to your problem. Yet you would
[57:12] not seek me. Yet you would not turn your
[57:14] face towards me and seek me for the
[57:17] answer that you need. I see what's wrong
[57:20] with you. You're running around trying
[57:22] to quench the thirst that I put in your
[57:25] heart for the Holy Ghost. And you're
[57:27] trying to quench that thirst with all
[57:28] kinds of things that I did not give to
[57:31] you. Trying to quench your thirst with
[57:33] TV and trying to quench your thirst with
[57:35] social media. trying to trench your
[57:37] thirst with community and and this and
[57:40] civilization and technology and creature
[57:43] comforts and trying to seek after this.
[57:46] Trying to cure your thirst with money,
[57:48] trying to cure your tur with family. But
[57:50] the only thing that can cure that thirst
[57:52] tonight is the palm of Gilead. Oh,
[57:56] hallelujah. Is the great physician
[57:59] taking his hand in your situation. Oh,
[58:02] and curing
[58:04] &gt;&gt; what ails you. Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; God is essentially saying you have a
[58:09] cure for your ailment,
[58:11] &gt;&gt; but you refuse to use it.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; You have a cure for your sickness,
[58:16] &gt;&gt; for your disease,
[58:18] &gt;&gt; but you refuse to apply it in your
[58:21] situation. And instead of embracing
[58:23] ideas as de as such as idolatry and
[58:26] injustice, which is what uh Judah's
[58:29] condition was, he said, "And you fail to
[58:31] return to the Lord, yet you find no ease
[58:33] for your suffering.
[58:36] The prophet said, "And why are we not in
[58:37] denomination?" He said, "Now we got
[58:39] gifts of healing working." Oh, it's it's
[58:42] going good. Well, brother, he said,
[58:44] "There's other gifts as well. Gifts of
[58:47] healing. That's just one of them." He
[58:49] said, "That's just a little minor
[58:51] thing." He said, "Well, here is a far
[58:53] greater gift right here, which would be
[58:56] the best gift, the gift of the Holy
[58:59] Ghost of wisdom."
[59:01] He said to put the word of God together
[59:05] and to show the church where we are
[59:07] standing
[59:09] &gt;&gt; than just to get somebody healed.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying that is a greater
[59:13] gift to put the word together is a far
[59:16] greater gift than what we go off on
[59:17] healing and and and and miracles and all
[59:19] of that kinds of stuff. Isn't that
[59:21] right?
[59:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet said here, he said, "We all
[59:23] want to be well." Yes.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "But I'd rather have my soul
[59:28] well than my body well anytime." He
[59:32] said, "Oh my, oh, how many feel that way
[59:34] tonight?" Oh, hallelujah. I might be
[59:36] sick in my body. Oh, I might be sick in
[59:39] my spirit, but I want to know that in my
[59:41] soul is stamped with the glorious,
[59:45] wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'd
[59:48] rather have my BODY SICK AND KNOW THAT
[59:50] MY SOUL IS sealed with the fire of the
[59:53] living God. I'd rather have a broken leg
[59:56] and know that my soul is passport stamp
[59:59] to glory. Oh, to know that you are
[1:00:02] sealed with the fire of God IN YOUR
[1:00:04] SOUL. THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE BAPTISM
[1:00:07] OF THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE. I'd rather
[1:00:10] see my soul well than my body well at
[1:00:13] any time. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:16] Isn't that right?
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We all want to be well.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; You're just saying it here. Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Everybody is sick in some way.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; But I'd rather have my soul well.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, if he gave me a choice
[1:00:29] between my soul and my body, prophet
[1:00:32] said, I'll choose my soul
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; because if this body fails me when my
[1:00:37] soul is on to glory, I step from this
[1:00:40] dimension into another dimension that is
[1:00:43] just as real as this one. Oh,
[1:00:45] hallelujah. Isn't that right? I step
[1:00:48] from here into glory and I leave this
[1:00:50] party behind. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[1:00:54] God. Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, leave it behind temporarily. Praise
[1:00:57] God. Until the resurrection. Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; My but you know where your soul is
[1:01:03] going. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; And that's a real gift to put the word
[1:01:07] of God together. Because remember in the
[1:01:10] beginning when when the devil came into
[1:01:12] the picture and deceived Eve, she fell
[1:01:15] by the word.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; He twisted the word, one word, and told
[1:01:20] her
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; she shall not surely die. And then he
[1:01:24] started to unfold his revelation. He
[1:01:27] started to unfold his gospel. He started
[1:01:30] to inject his virus into the situation.
[1:01:34] And what was a perfect setting in the
[1:01:36] Garden of Eden, what was a perfect man
[1:01:38] and and and and a woman, praise God, and
[1:01:40] everything that was set up the way God
[1:01:42] had it, it was perfect. There was no
[1:01:44] sin, no sickness. But here come the
[1:01:46] devil with an agenda, with a big
[1:01:48] injection needle of unbelief. That's
[1:01:52] what it was. It was unbelief as an
[1:01:55] injection against the word. And Eve
[1:01:58] received that injection and she gave
[1:02:01] that injection to her husband. And right
[1:02:03] there, the devil's virus began to grow
[1:02:06] inside of them like a darkness. It began
[1:02:08] to pollute their minds, pollute their
[1:02:11] atmosphere, pollute their spirits,
[1:02:13] pollute their bodies until one moment
[1:02:16] they woke up and realized that they were
[1:02:18] naked and went and hid themselves and
[1:02:21] for ashamed. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[1:02:23] right? Isn't that right? And God come
[1:02:25] down in the garden saying, "Who told you
[1:02:27] that you were naked?" Right there. The
[1:02:29] presence of God that was over them, the
[1:02:31] anointing that overshadowed them had
[1:02:34] left them because they fell by the word.
[1:02:36] So God to restore us, he has to now
[1:02:40] restore us by the same word that he fell
[1:02:43] by. Oh, hallelujah. This bride will not
[1:02:46] be deceived. THIS BRIDE WILL HAVE THE
[1:02:48] ABILITY TO STAND NOT ONLY TO HEAR THAT
[1:02:51] WORD but to stand with that word and say
[1:02:55] it is written. It is written. The
[1:02:57] prophet said she WILL HAVE THUS SAYETH
[1:03:00] THE LORD OR she will keep still or she
[1:03:03] will stay right where she is and she
[1:03:06] will say GIVE ME THAT GIFT. STAY WITH
[1:03:08] GIVE ME THIS UNTIL THAT COME. I PREFER
[1:03:11] TO STAY WITH THIS UNTIL THAT COME AND
[1:03:15] THEN THAT DON'T COME. [screaming] I'M
[1:03:17] STAYING RIGHT HERE WHERE HE told me to
[1:03:19] stay. I'm staying in Jerusalem. I'm
[1:03:22] carrying in Jerusalem until he tell me
[1:03:25] to go TO GO AND TELL SOMETHING. But I
[1:03:28] can't go and tell nothing. Until the
[1:03:30] spirit come down until I'm endued with
[1:03:33] power from on high. I'M WAITING ON. I'M
[1:03:38] CALLING ON. I'm praying on. I'M LOOKING
[1:03:41] FOR THAT SAME HOLY GHOST THAT FELL in
[1:03:44] the upper room. THIS BRIDE IS LOOKING TO
[1:03:47] BE GRAMMATIZED. THIS BRIDE IS LOOKING,
[1:03:51] HALLELUJAH, TO MEET WITH HER, LORD. OH,

[1:04:06] VIRGIN TO ANYTHING ELSE. UH, DON'T TELL
[1:04:08] US NOTHING. IT'S TOO LATE TO INFECT US.
[1:04:11] IT'S TOO LATE TO INJECT US WITH ANY KIND
[1:04:14] OF MAN'S IDEA, WITH ANY KIND OF MAN'S
[1:04:17] UNBELIEF, WITH ANY KIND OF MAN'S
[1:04:19] TEACHING. IT'S FAR TOO LATE, DEVIL. OH,

[1:06:42] you see by revelation what you are
[1:06:44] called to do, you're going to make

[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; A virus killer.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; A bomb in
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Gilead.
[1:07:16] Lord,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; can I go on?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; The literal palm tree that God is
[1:07:22] actually referencing.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I did some research.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Is known as the balsam of Mecca.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; It's a literal tree. [snorts]
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; It grows as a shrub.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. around the region of Gilead.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Notice I said a shrub.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; It's not a great oak tree.
[1:07:41] It's not a big mahogany.
[1:07:44] It's not a teak or a cedar.
[1:07:47] It's a shrub
[1:07:50] around some little rock somewhere on the
[1:07:51] dusty side of the road is where you'll
[1:07:54] find the balm of Gilead.
[1:07:58] [laughter]
[1:07:59] A shrub. People with carts and slippers
[1:08:02] walking past this shrub every day
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; in the regions of Gilead.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; They don't pay it no mind because
[1:08:09] nothing to be to look at. The balm tree,
[1:08:12] this palm tree, this balm tree that God
[1:08:14] is actually talking about is an
[1:08:16] unattractive tree.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; There is no beauty in this tree that you
[1:08:21] would desire it. It is a palm tree that
[1:08:24] grows in a strange land in a far
[1:08:27] distance. It is unattractive.
[1:08:30] It's a shrub. You would walk past it if
[1:08:33] you didn't know what it could do for
[1:08:35] you. [clears throat] You would walk
[1:08:36] straight past it. Isn't that right? But
[1:08:39] for those who know what the tree can do,
[1:08:42] for those who know what that tree is
[1:08:44] capable of, it is a source of healing.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; It is a source of deliverance. It
[1:08:51] soothes the aches. Isn't there research
[1:08:54] even shows that it was used for
[1:08:55] embarmming the dead and many other
[1:08:57] medicinal practices? It could be used as
[1:09:00] a remedy, as a cure for an ailment.
[1:09:04] Isn't that right?
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Inside of this shrub was a resin that
[1:09:08] would come out and they would take it
[1:09:09] out and refine it and use it in their
[1:09:12] daily practice of medicine.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Healing tonight is in the tree.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Deliverance is in the tree.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? But there's another
[1:09:23] interesting fact about this tree. Not
[1:09:25] only is it unattractive, not only is it
[1:09:27] just a itty bitty thing that most people
[1:09:30] call might be call a common shrub, isn't
[1:09:33] that right? But in order to get healing
[1:09:35] out of it, you have to cut it.
[1:09:39] You have to cut this tree.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; In order to get access to the resin that
[1:09:44] is on the inside, and only then will the
[1:09:47] true powers that are in the tree could
[1:09:50] be unfolded to you. Oh, hallelujah. I
[1:09:53] know who you know I'm talking about to
[1:09:55] Stephen tonight. I'm not just talking
[1:09:57] about a tree.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; I know you have spiritual thinking caps
[1:10:00] inside here tonight. You know I'm not
[1:10:02] just talking about a tree. But Isaiah 53
[1:10:06] and verse one said, "Who had believed
[1:10:08] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:10:12] Lord revealed? For he shall grow up
[1:10:14] before him as a tender plant and as a
[1:10:17] root out of a dry ground. He had no form
[1:10:21] or comeliness. That when we shall see
[1:10:24] him there is no beauty that we would
[1:10:26] desire him. He is despised and rejected
[1:10:31] of men. A man of sorrows and acquainted
[1:10:35] with griefs and we hid as it were our
[1:10:38] faces from him. He was despised and we
[1:10:42] esteemed him not. Surely he had borne
[1:10:45] our griefs and carried our sorrows. Yet
[1:10:48] we did not we did esteem him stricken
[1:10:52] and smitten of God and afflicted. And
[1:10:54] verse 5, we know it. He was wounded for
[1:10:57] our transgressions. He was bruised for
[1:11:00] our iniquities. Oh, that tree was cut.
[1:11:04] That tree was bruised. That tree was
[1:11:06] heuned down. Oh, isn't that right? The
[1:11:09] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[1:11:13] But by his stripes, we were healed. Oh,
[1:11:17] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:11:21] that palm lay on a cross ONE CALVARY
[1:11:25] AFTERNOON. THAT PALM LAY ON A CROSS AND
[1:11:28] HE CRIED and he screamed for the pain.
[1:11:32] Uh oh. That he suffered. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:11:35] He died. Oh, and he was cut. Oh, A
[1:11:39] SOLDIER PIERCED HIS SIDE. AND BLOOD AND
[1:11:42] WATER came out. OH, HE DIED an agonizing
[1:11:45] death. He carried the cross that I was
[1:11:48] supposed to carry. Oh, he bore the nails
[1:11:51] UH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO IN MY HANDS.
[1:11:53] UH BUT he took it. He bore it all. He
[1:11:57] paid it ALL AND HE DIED. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:00] AND THAT BOMB ON THAT CROSS WAS CUT ON
[1:12:04] THE DAY OF CALVARY. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:06] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. And
[1:12:09] the prophet said when he died, the
[1:12:11] spirit that was in that body, God tore
[1:12:13] that spirit out of him. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:16] That was the Holy Spirit. Oh, THAT
[1:12:18] VICTORIOUS SPIRIT THAT CONQUERED DEATH,
[1:12:22] THAT CONQUERED HELL. He was ON HIS WAY
[1:12:24] TO HELL TO CONQUER. OH, HALLELUJAH. That
[1:12:27] spirit went out of the body of Christ.
[1:12:29] OH, AND IT WENT DOWN TO HELL. WHAT DID
[1:12:32] IT GO DOWN THERE FOR? HE WAS THE BOMB OF
[1:12:34] GILEAD GOING DOWN TO HELL TO FREE THE
[1:12:37] SOUL THAT WAS IN HELL. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:40] HALLELUJAH. He took the KEYS OF DEATH
[1:12:43] AND HELL AND THE GRAVE FROM THAT DEVIL.
[1:12:46] HE SAID, "THAT BELONGS TO ME NOW. THAT'S
[1:12:48] MINE NOW. I'll have it. Thank you very
[1:12:50] much." And he kicked down the doors AND
[1:12:53] HE LET THE prisoners out. Oh,
[1:12:55] hallelujah. Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:12:57] Hallelujah. Oh, glory, glory, glory.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Deliverance is in the
[1:13:05] tree.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Healing is in the tree tonight.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Send the bomb of Gilead. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:13:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you got to
[1:13:13] have a revelation
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; of who he is
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; to know that he can do it for you.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Pharisees call him be elabub.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; The Sadducees called him a heretic.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; They kicked him out of the churches.
[1:13:26] They didn't want him. Well, the little
[1:13:28] woman at the well said, "If you are
[1:13:30] him," praise God. She had a
[1:13:32] conversation. She said, "I know that the
[1:13:34] when the Messiah comes, he will do these
[1:13:36] things and he will have these gifts and
[1:13:38] these signs and God revealed himself to
[1:13:41] her." He said, "I that speak to you. I
[1:13:43] am here." When she saw what was laying
[1:13:46] in that balm of Gilead, she brought down
[1:13:49] her water pot. She threw down her reason
[1:13:51] to be there that afternoon and she ran
[1:13:54] down to her people and said, "Come see a
[1:13:57] man who told me all that I have done.
[1:14:00] Come see a man who touched me and made
[1:14:03] me whole. Come see a man who did
[1:14:05] something for me that no other man could
[1:14:08] do. She had five husbands and the one
[1:14:11] she was living with were not her own.
[1:14:13] Oh, hallelujah. She knew men, BUT THIS
[1:14:16] WAS A DIFFERENT ONE. OH, THIS WAS A
[1:14:18] GLORIOUS ONE. THIS ONE HAD SOMETHING SHE
[1:14:21] NEEDED. HE HAD A BOMB. A BOMB THAT
[1:14:24] SOOTHED HER HURTS. [laughter] A bomb
[1:14:26] that soothed her pains. her palm that
[1:14:28] was a remedy for her situation. A remedy
[1:14:33] oh for what she needed in that hour.
[1:14:35] [screaming] Oh, he healed her in her
[1:14:37] soul. Healed her in her spirit. Oh,
[1:14:40] hallelujah. He discerned her very
[1:14:42] thoughts.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; There was that bomb at work.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. My So, we struck
[1:14:52] that already. He fell by the word.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Hallelujah.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God departed from them
[1:14:59] and they knew that they were naked.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; They were covered with a glory with an
[1:15:02] anointing. They did not even know. They
[1:15:04] were not even aware.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; But something happened when the devil
[1:15:08] come and injected his virus into the
[1:15:10] system. And the whole thing was corrupt.
[1:15:12] And from that time on
[1:15:15] that virus spread more and more and
[1:15:17] more. It got to the point when and we
[1:15:19] find in Noah when God is getting ready
[1:15:22] to judge the earth that virus that the
[1:15:25] devil injected back in Eden had grew a
[1:15:28] corrupt people.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Mankind was corrupt upon the face of the
[1:15:32] earth.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; They taught evil continually.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Every imagination and mischief they had
[1:15:38] in their heart,
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; they manifested it in the flesh.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; So terrible was a condition. It was like
[1:15:44] a stench coming up to God's nose. He was
[1:15:47] he was he was he was he was uh uh uh uh
[1:15:50] turned off by it. He was he was angered
[1:15:52] by it. Even the Lord repented that he
[1:15:55] had made man. Isn't that right? And he
[1:15:57] had vowed to judge them by water. But
[1:15:59] one man found grace in God's sight. And
[1:16:02] that man was Noah. Isn't that right? And
[1:16:05] we found grace in God's sight. This is
[1:16:08] an again another judgment hour. This is
[1:16:11] again another judgment day. Judgment is
[1:16:14] coming to the education system, to the
[1:16:16] governments, to the justice system, to
[1:16:18] the polluted system of this world. The
[1:16:21] virus of the devil has been allowed to
[1:16:23] spread again in this end and in end end
[1:16:25] of days. Isn't that right? In this low
[1:16:27] DC and age, that virus multiply itself
[1:16:30] again. And we have more corrupt
[1:16:32] wickedness, more spirits just like it
[1:16:34] was in the days of Noah. So shall it be
[1:16:36] in the days of the coming of the son of
[1:16:38] man. Oh, they eating, they drinking,
[1:16:40] they married, and they giving in
[1:16:42] marriage. Oh, that's the condition we
[1:16:44] find in now. And that evil virus that
[1:16:46] was injected by the devil. That virus of
[1:16:49] unbelief, that virus of sin, that virus
[1:16:51] of filth, that virus of pollution has
[1:16:54] multiplied itself again into an untoward
[1:16:57] and evil and crooked generation. Oh,
[1:17:00] this age was not supposed to have any
[1:17:03] light. But by faith, God put a slither
[1:17:06] of light right in that loud DC age. And
[1:17:10] that light represented you and I. The
[1:17:13] prophet said in the evening time there
[1:17:15] shall be light. God's going to find a
[1:17:18] group of people somewhere who are going
[1:17:21] to manifest that light. You are going to
[1:17:23] manifest that light, my brother. Oh,
[1:17:26] TELL ME MY SISTER. TELL ME my brother.
[1:17:29] When was THERE A TIME OUTSIDE OF THIS
[1:17:31] TIME NOW FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF THE
[1:17:35] SONS OF GOD UPON THE EARTH? OH, we need
[1:17:38] it, brother. [laughter] We need a
[1:17:40] healing. We need a release of GOD'S
[1:17:43] SPIRIT, OF GOD'S BOMB. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:46] HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:48] OH,
[1:17:50] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. To heal what has
[1:17:52] been broken.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; To heal our land. Isn't that right?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So to cure that sickness,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; he had to come back by the word and the
[1:18:04] spirit again.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; In order to restore it back.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, he was the word and he
[1:18:12] preached the word and he spoke the word
[1:18:13] over them and prophesied over them.
[1:18:15] Isn't that right? As a son of man
[1:18:17] sowing, sewing the word, sewing the
[1:18:19] seeds. Amen. Is now the kingdom of God
[1:18:21] is like this. The kingdom of God is like
[1:18:23] that. Cast this body down and in three
[1:18:25] days I'll raise it up again. Oh,
[1:18:27] hallelujah. He confounded them, but he
[1:18:29] had to speak it because the word went
[1:18:31] out as a prophecy, knowing that the
[1:18:33] spirit of God would come behind and
[1:18:35] manifest that word. Every word that he
[1:18:38] spoke would be manifested, but it had to
[1:18:41] be spoken first as a prophecy.
[1:18:44] Hallelujah. And though they did not
[1:18:45] understand it, one day he knew that they
[1:18:48] would remember his words. Oh,
[1:18:50] hallelujah. He knew that it would come
[1:18:51] back to them in the time and the season
[1:18:53] that it had to come back. So he spoke
[1:18:56] it. The son of man sewing seeds. Some
[1:18:59] fell on thorny. Some fell on stony
[1:19:01] ground. Some fell on wayside. But some
[1:19:04] fell on good ground. Oh, I believe with
[1:19:06] all my heart. GOD FOUND GOOD GROUND
[1:19:09] TONIGHT. RIGHT HERE IN HEADSTONE
[1:19:11] TABERNACLE, RIGHT HERE IN SANGRY GRANDE,
[1:19:13] RIGHT HERE IN TRINIDAD, GOD FOUND GOOD
[1:19:16] GROUND uh to sew his seed in. Uh oh,

[1:19:58] we're HERE TO RECEIVE IT TONIGHT. GOD
[1:20:00] PROMISED TO HEAL OUR BODIES, AND WE'RE
[1:20:02] HERE TO RECEIVE IT TONIGHT. GOD PROMISED
[1:20:04] THE HOLY GHOST. GOD PROMISED THE POOR
[1:20:06] DYNAMICS TO OUR MECHANICS. GOD PROMISED
[1:20:09] THAT THE SEVEN THUNDERS THAT ARE NOT
[1:20:11] EVEN WRITTEN UH WILL BE MADE MANIFEST IN
[1:20:13] SUCH A WAY UH THAT PEOPLE WILL COME
[1:20:15] FLYING IN UH TO TRINIDAD TO FIND OUT

[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Prophet said here
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; on exposition of seven church ages, the
[1:22:09] sadishian church age.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; He says in divine service the words of
[1:22:13] men are usually heard more than the word
[1:22:16] of God. Each one chatters as he pleases
[1:22:19] [laughter] or kills time by learned
[1:22:21] dispositions and disproving the views of
[1:22:24] others. A melting pot of of nonsense.
[1:22:27] This man versus that man. This minister
[1:22:29] versus that minister. This church versus
[1:22:31] that church. The views of men [laughter]
[1:22:33] usually heard more than the word of God.
[1:22:36] The prophet said, "Here's your remedy
[1:22:38] tonight." Are you [laughter] ready? He
[1:22:40] said of the new birth and how a man must
[1:22:42] be changed into THE LIKENESS OF CHRIST
[1:22:46] TO BECOME A PARTAKER OF THE DIVINE
[1:22:48] NATURE. ACCORDING TO JUST SECOND Peter
[1:22:51] 1:4, he said, "Scarcely anything is
[1:22:54] said." Oh, hallelujah. That's what we
[1:22:58] need tonight. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:23:00] Hallelujah. A divine nature. We need to
[1:23:02] come into that nature. You are promised
[1:23:05] friends to come into a nature that's
[1:23:08] going to change the way you walk, change
[1:23:10] the WAY YOU TALK, CHANGE THE WAY YOU
[1:23:12] APPROACH LIFE, CHANGE THE WAY YOU
[1:23:14] APPROACH SITUATIONS, CHANGE THE WAY YOU
[1:23:16] APPROACH CIRCUMSTANCES. WHEN YOU HAVE
[1:23:18] THIS NATURE, THE DEVIL IS UNDEFEATED. Uh
[1:23:21] is is defeated in your life. You become
[1:23:23] undefeated. Praise God. Hallelujah. You
[1:23:26] stand anywhere, anytime. PRAISE GOD.
[1:23:29] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT
[1:23:31] TAKES TO TAKE YOU THROUGH the trial.
[1:23:34] even to the rapture. Praise God. This
[1:23:36] these seven things living in you. Praise
[1:23:38] God. They make you that you shall
[1:23:40] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:23:43] knowledge of God. Oh, and unto a perfect
[1:23:46] man, unto a measure of stature of THE
[1:23:49] FULLNESS OF CHRIST. When these seven
[1:23:51] things come in you, oh, THAT'S WHAT
[1:23:52] WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR ALL THESE YEARS
[1:23:55] TO GET THESE SEVEN THINGS IN US TO MEET
[1:23:57] GOD'S REQUIREMENTS. AND THE DEVIL HAS
[1:23:59] LOOSED HIS AGENTS UPON THE EARTH.
[1:24:02] INJECTING PEOPLE WITH UNBELIEF,
[1:24:04] INJECTING PEOPLE WITH VIRUSES SO THAT
[1:24:06] THEY would not believe. Oh, but we did
[1:24:08] not believe the DEVIL'S LIE. WE DIDN'T
[1:24:11] BELIEVE IT UP THERE. [screaming] AND WE
[1:24:12] WILL NOT BELIEVE IT DOWN HERE. WE KICKED
[1:24:15] THE DEVIL OUT UP THERE AND WE'RE GOING
[1:24:17] TO KICK HIM OUT DOWN HERE. AND [snorts]
[1:24:20] AS A WITNESS, MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL IS
[1:24:23] COMING DOWN BECAUSE HE WAS THERE WITH
[1:24:26] YOU WHEN YOU FOUGHT THE BATTLE AGAINST
[1:24:28] SATAN AND YOUR ANGEL REPRESENTED YOU.
[1:24:31] WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW
[1:24:33] IN THIS TIME THAT WE LIVING IN? THAT
[1:24:35] ANGEL COME BACK DOWN AGAIN TO STAND WITH
[1:24:38] THE SON OF GOD, TO STAND WITH THE
[1:24:40] DAUGHTERS OF GOD AND TO FIGHT THE GOOD
[1:24:42] FIGHT OF FAITH. WE ARE GOING TO PRESS
[1:24:44] BACK THE ENEMY, PRESS BACK LUCIFER,
[1:24:47] PRESS BACK SICKNESS, PRESS BACK DISEASE.
[1:24:50] OH, HALLELUJAH. THAT MIGHTY CHURCH IS
[1:24:53] GOING TO STAND THERE AND ALL HER GLORY.
[1:24:55] OH, THEN THE PHILISTINES WOULD GO TO
[1:24:58] BACKING UP. THEN THE SHORT WOULD GO OFF.
[1:25:00] THEN THE HAIR WILL GO MALACHI 4. LIVE IN
[1:25:04] ME is my prayer. OH, THAT'S WHAT I WANT
[1:25:06] TO SEE. THAT'S WHAT I'M PRAYING FOR. IF
[1:25:09] IT'S THE LAST SECOND BEFORE THE RAPTURE,
[1:25:11] I WANT THE HOLY GHOST. IF IT'S THE LAST
[1:25:13] SECOND BEFORE THE RAPTURE, I WANT TO BE
[1:25:15] FILLED. I WANT TO BE SEALED WITH A
[1:25:18] GLORIOUS, wonderful
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; balm of Gilead.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Let's let's try to finish [laughter]
[1:25:38] this out. Amen. Obama Gillia the prophet
[1:25:40] said there's people today it's just like
[1:25:43] this he said a man is dying on the
[1:25:45] doorsteps of a doctor's office when the
[1:25:48] doctor in the building has the cure for
[1:25:51] his disease but he refuses to take it if
[1:25:54] the man has a disease and the doctor has
[1:25:56] a cure for it then the man may lay on
[1:25:59] the doctor's doorstep but if he refused
[1:26:02] to take the medicine he will die on the
[1:26:06] doorstep you cannot blame the doctor.
[1:26:09] The doctor would have given him the
[1:26:10] medicine to cure him if he would only
[1:26:13] come and take it. But it isn't the
[1:26:15] doctor's fault. He's got the remedy, BUT
[1:26:18] THE MAN is too stubborn to take it. The
[1:26:20] prophet said, "Whose fault is it?" He
[1:26:23] said, "And so it is today that many
[1:26:26] people die in the front of the church on
[1:26:29] the steps in the pews. They die in their
[1:26:32] sins because they refuse to accept God's
[1:26:35] bomb that is in Gilead. They die in
[1:26:38] their sins BECAUSE THEY REFUSE IT. NOT
[1:26:41] BECAUSE THERE isn't any there, but they
[1:26:43] just refuse to take it. Oh, he said,
[1:26:45] "Then what will they take?" He said,
[1:26:47] "They'll have to take something false
[1:26:49] instead." Oh, there's your mark of THE
[1:26:51] BEAST. THEY REJECT THE HOLY SPIRIT, THEN
[1:26:54] THEY'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING FALSE
[1:26:55] INSTEAD. But we are here tonight to take
[1:26:58] God's medicine. WE ARE HERE TONIGHT TO
[1:27:01] TAKE GOD'S WORD AND TO RECEIVE the
[1:27:03] spirit OF GOD THAT MAKES that word
[1:27:06] alive. Oh, that makes that word live in
[1:27:09] you tonight. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said night after night inspired
[1:27:21] prophets of God speaking who takes a
[1:27:23] word fearlessly and lays it out. He said
[1:27:25] he must be born again. He said, "But men
[1:27:27] and women sit in the pews and die and
[1:27:30] sink into utter despair and annihilate
[1:27:33] from God because they because there's
[1:27:35] not grace and salvation." Not because
[1:27:37] there's not grace and salvation, but
[1:27:39] because they refuse to receive it. Oh,
[1:27:42] what a condition. Oh, don't fall into
[1:27:44] that condition, friends. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:27:46] No, no. We come too far to fall into
[1:27:48] such a condition. Amen. There is a bomb
[1:27:51] in Gilead tonight. There is a physician
[1:27:53] there. A great position now is here. Oh,
[1:27:57] the gentle loving Jesus. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:28:00] Sweeter. Oh, any note on Sarah's song.
[1:28:03] [screaming] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:06] Hallelujah. Sweetest name on mortal
[1:28:09] tongue is Jesus. Precious Jesus. Our
[1:28:12] heart beats for him. Uh oh. We long for
[1:28:15] him. Uh we long for his bomb to come and
[1:28:18] touch our hearts again. Uh oh. People
[1:28:20] need the Lord. Uh people need God.
[1:28:22] People need a savior. People need a
[1:28:25] redeemer. People need a healing. PEOPLE
[1:28:28] NEED DELIVERANCE. PEOPLE NEED a
[1:28:30] resurrection. UH THEY DYING AND THEY
[1:28:32] DON'T KNOW IT. THEY SICK AND THEY DON'T
[1:28:34] KNOW IT. THEY GOING TO [laughter] HELL
[1:28:35] AND THEY DON'T KNOW IT. WHAT they need
[1:28:38] is THE BOMB OF GILEAD TO INTERVENE
[1:28:41] TONIGHT. Uh oh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:46] Oh my. Oh, I'm getting ready to close.
[1:28:49] Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Sometimes we join
[1:28:53] church a lot of pretty things and so
[1:28:55] forth. Maybe we we try to pretty
[1:28:57] ourselves to go to church, get some
[1:28:58] something another to wear to church."
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Is that all church
[1:29:02] means to you?" He said, "Then I'm
[1:29:04] persuaded you need a new birth." That's
[1:29:07] exactly right. That grain of corn will
[1:29:09] never produce any new life until the own
[1:29:13] grain rots away. He said, "And a person
[1:29:16] at the altar can't get down there and
[1:29:19] kneel down and then just get up and say,
[1:29:21] I've got a new birth." No, no, no. You
[1:29:23] have to stay there until all of your
[1:29:26] thoughts, your [snorts] own self, and
[1:29:28] all your worldly things has rotted away
[1:29:30] from you, has died and rotten and gone
[1:29:33] from you. And then a new birth takes
[1:29:37] place. He said, "Oh, you might slobber
[1:29:39] and jabber and slobber like a horse."
[1:29:41] Amen. Hallelujah. But you come up from
[1:29:43] there in a new condition with a new
[1:29:46] birth and something in you that is alive
[1:29:49] and makes you something different than
[1:29:52] what you was. Oh, that's the effect of
[1:29:55] the bomb of Gilead. It makes you
[1:29:58] something different than what you was.
[1:30:01] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:03] Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Oh my, my
[1:30:07] my my. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Let me
[1:30:11] finish out here. Praise God. Ready to
[1:30:12] close out. That musician could come.
[1:30:14] Amen. Begin to come and get ready. Amen.
[1:30:16] So the prophet says, "Here's something
[1:30:17] here. Now I want to bring it out." He
[1:30:19] talks about the toxin. He says, "Now all
[1:30:21] those lambs were a shadow or stepping
[1:30:22] stone pointing to a time when God would
[1:30:25] bring the real toxin down." Oh, so they
[1:30:28] had sacrifice in the wilderness. They
[1:30:30] offered up bullocks and goats and so
[1:30:32] forth. Isn't that right? Praise God. But
[1:30:33] they was waiting for a perfect one to
[1:30:35] come. God was promised to release a real
[1:30:38] toxin to deal with the sin issue to deal
[1:30:41] with the unbelief issue to deal with the
[1:30:44] devil's injection. Isn't that right? He
[1:30:47] says, "So God never chose a guinea pig.
[1:30:49] Neither did he choose anything else. He
[1:30:51] tried the serum out on his own son, a
[1:30:55] virgin-born son of God, come down to the
[1:30:58] earth, and God gave him the toxin. Gave
[1:31:01] him the toxin t test. Isn't that right?
[1:31:04] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. And it
[1:31:06] happened on the bank of Jordan when he
[1:31:08] was 30 years old. John per record after
[1:31:11] he baptized him and said, "I saw the
[1:31:14] spirit of God descending like a dove and
[1:31:17] it went upon him and he was filled with
[1:31:20] God's toxin and he proved it that he
[1:31:23] could stand THE TEST. HE WALKED OUT
[1:31:25] THERE BEFORE SICKNESS AND sickness
[1:31:28] vanished from him. He walked before the
[1:31:30] cripples and the cripples walked. And
[1:31:33] when he was put to the test, they spit
[1:31:35] on him. They whipped [snorts] him at the
[1:31:37] back. They riled him up. Try to get his
[1:31:40] temper up. And he said, "I could speak
[1:31:42] to my father and he would send legions
[1:31:44] of angels." [snorts] What was the
[1:31:46] matter? WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT? THE PROPHET
[1:31:48] SAID THE toxin was holding. Oh, he was
[1:31:52] put to the test AND THERE THE TOXIN WENT
[1:31:55] TO CALVARY. HALLELUJAH. Mockery and spit
[1:31:58] on his face. His face was bleeding and
[1:32:00] so forth. He could have spoke the word
[1:32:02] and it was changed the whole thing. But
[1:32:04] the toxin held. The prophet said he died
[1:32:08] and he had the sins of the world and
[1:32:10] every sin that was ever in the world was
[1:32:14] placed on him under that burden of sin
[1:32:17] with all of the sin laid upon him. He
[1:32:20] died. Oh hallelujah. That toxin work in
[1:32:24] temptations. That toxin work IN EVERY
[1:32:26] TRIAL. THAT TOXIN WORK IN DEATH. THAT
[1:32:29] TOXIN WORK IN BURIAL AND THE TOXIN
[1:32:31] WORKED IN RESURRECTION.
[1:32:34] Oh the prophet SAID THERE IS A BOMB IN
[1:32:37] GILEAD. And then Jesus said he TOLD HIS
[1:32:39] DISCIPLES I WANT YOU TO BE INOCULATED
[1:32:43] WITH IT. SO I AM SENDING YOU FORTH WITH
[1:32:46] A KIT TO GO OUT INTO ALL THE WORLD AND
[1:32:49] INOCULATE EVERYONE THAT WOULD BELIEVE.
[1:32:52] OH, SEVEN TENDERS TO INOCULATE YOU. OH,
[1:32:56] UNTO A GLORIOUS RAPTURE, UNTO A GLORIOUS
[1:32:59] WEDDING SUPPER. GOD'S GOING TO INOCULATE
[1:33:01] THIS BRIDE FROM THE VIRUS OF THE DEVIL.
[1:33:04] OH, and the prophet said 120 climbed
[1:33:08] into an upper room and closed THE DOORS
[1:33:11] AND THEY BARED the windows and they
[1:33:13] stayed there for 10 days waiting for it
[1:33:15] to happen. And while they were there in
[1:33:18] one place and in one accord, ALL OF A
[1:33:21] SUDDEN THERE CAME A SOUND FROM HEAVEN
[1:33:24] like a rushing MIGHTY WIND. IT WAS GOD'S
[1:33:27] BOMB COMING DOWN. AND WHEN IT STRUCK THE
[1:33:30] ROOM, CLOVE AND TONGUES OF FIRE SET UPON
[1:33:34] THEM. OH, AND OUT INTO THE STREETS THEY
[1:33:38] WENT. THE TOXIN HAD THE RESULTS. OH,
[1:33:41] THEY SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN
[1:33:42] INOCULATED. HALLELUJAH. THEY SHOW THAT
[1:33:45] SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. UH ALL
[1:33:47] THE FEAR AND EVERYTHING VANISHED AWAY AS
[1:33:51] SOON AS THEY GOT THE INJECTION OF GOD'S
[1:33:53] TOXIN OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT WAS POURED
[1:33:57] OUT UPON THEM. OH, IT MADE THEM STAMMER.
[1:34:00] IT MADE THEM RECEIVE NEW LIFE. GOD PUT
[1:34:02] HIS LIFE INTO 120. OH, GOD IS GOING TO
[1:34:07] DO THE SAME FOR YOU TONIGHT. GOD HAS A
[1:34:09] TOXIN TONIGHT. IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT
[1:34:12] MARY RECEIVED. IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT
[1:34:14] PETER RECEIVED. YOU CAN STAND. IT'S THE
[1:34:16] SAME ONE THAT JOHN RECEIVED. IT'S THE
[1:34:17] SAME ONE THAT PHILIP RECEIVED. YOU'RE
[1:34:19] GOING TO RECEIVE A TOXIN TONIGHT. THE
[1:34:22] TOXIN HELD IN JESUS. AND ALL OF US IN
[1:34:24] CHRIST, HE'S ABOUT TO POUR IT INTO THE
[1:34:27] CHURCH TO INOCULATE YOU AWAY FROM THIS
[1:34:29] WORLD AND ENTER GLORY. THE BAPTISM OF
[1:34:33] THE HOLY GHOST, THE BOMB OF GILEAD. OH,
[1:34:40] it keeps the bugs away. It keeps the the
[1:34:42] the the the pest away. OH, IT'S NOT A
[1:34:45] HYBRID PLANT. IT'S an original. It's an
[1:34:48] original seed. UH AND THE SPOKEN WORD IS
[1:34:51] THE ORIGINAL SEED. UH AND [laughter] WE
[1:34:52] HAVE RECEIVED THE SPOKEN WORD. UH MARY,
[1:34:55] YOU ARE BLESSED AND YOU ARE HIGHLY
[1:34:57] FAVORED BECAUSE IN YOU IS GOING TO BE
[1:35:00] FORMED THE CHRIST. YOU ARE GOING TO
[1:35:02] RECEIVE A GLORIOUS WONDERFUL BAPTISM OF
[1:35:06] THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE. IN THERE WILL
[1:35:08] BE FAITH, VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE,
[1:35:12] PATIENCE, GODLINESS, BROTHERLY KINDNESS.
[1:35:14] AND WHEN GOD SEES THE TOXIN HOLDS IN
[1:35:17] YOUR HEART, HE'S GOING TO SEND DOWN
[1:35:20] CHARITY UPON YOU AND CROWN YOUR LIFE OFF
[1:35:24] THIS BEING WHEN IT IS completed is a
[1:35:28] servant of God that goes into the
[1:35:31] rapture. May the Lord bless you. May you
[1:35:34] receive your toxin tonight. may receive
[1:35:37] your bomb and give you tonight. Oh
