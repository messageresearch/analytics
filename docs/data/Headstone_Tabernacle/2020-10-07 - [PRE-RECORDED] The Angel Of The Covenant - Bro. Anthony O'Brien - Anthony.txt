house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the ink on right uh writers income by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of men that sigh and cry for their for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof that's mercy going forward first isn't that right and then verse 5 says

to run his run the devil had his chance to prove himself to prove his power and to prove what he can do by the science and technology of man and civilization the devil has had his chance to prove himself this morning i asked a question when is the bride gonna have a chance to prove herself and what she's made of when there's a pride this morning gonna have a revival luther had her revival wesley had their revival the pentecostal had their revival brother what are we waiting on we are waiting on a revival the bride hasn't had a revival yet but the angel of the lord is here to make sure that you have your time of deliverance oh hallelujah another time of life oh amen isn't that right hallelujah so when that pillow fire dropped down moses do battle with pharaoh it wasn't easy you know round one battle round two battle but with every battle the enemy's grip was loosening it was loosening on the people that were in pondage oh hallelujah hallelujah that time of slavery was just about finished that time of slavery was just about over and with every round god went higher and god went higher and god went higher praise god until it come to the point where moses said take your cattle

angel of the covenant to lead god's people out of egypt and into the promised land here was god fulfilling his agreement praise god that almighty hand he will lead them out that was that fulfillment in the form of the pillar of fire that angel drop down praise god pillar of cloud by day pillar fire by night isn't that right everything that they have need of was in that pillar of fire and i love the picture even moses had to subject himself to the leading of that pillar of fire brother in this hour no man is going to lead us there's no groups going to lead us but it'll be the pillar of fire leading us out it'd be the pillar of fire showing us the way showing us where to go what to do what to say it'll be the pillar of fire failing the adopted sun pray that's the ministry that we're going to have we've got to have it before the coming of the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh we're going to have it before don't tell me there's going to be a rapture without a mighty manifestation of god for this hour no no no no it's got to happen before god has got to prove something to the devil that all that he's tried to do for 2 000 years according to in one year the prophet said one year could this be the year we are standing in january i wonder what's gonna happen this year brother don't you lose faith don't you lose hope we have not followed cunningly devised fables oh hallelujah but our salvation is drawing narrow this morning lift up your heads your redemption is drawing now [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise corny man [Applause] i love how god didn't show the whole picture to abraham he just told him that his people would sojune in a strange land and then he told him with a mighty hand he bring them out he didn't tell them how long it would take he didn't tell him how bad it would be he just told him i overview gave him a kind of skeletal frame of what was supposed to happen oh hallelujah but the details were stretched out through the process of time isn't that right abraham we got isaac isaac we got jacob jacob he got joseph and so it went on until joseph ended up in egypt and then the whole scene played out and then the children of israel ended up in egypt and then they raised up a pharaoh that knew not joseph oh hallelujah things seem to be all right until they raise up a pharaoh that knew not joseph oh hallelujah hallelujah you rose up somebody that didn't know this god that didn't know the court of miracles they rose up somebody that grew up in his mommy's house that grew up in his puppy's house hey man he was all spoiled and everything i didn't know this god that we were talking about he didn't know this god of miracles he didn't know this court of armies he thought he had all the power but god wanted to prove something to this pharaoh that i am the boss i am the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah and there's a generation on the earth who doesn't know this god that we're talking about they don't want miracles they know about healing they know about science they don't know about wonders they don't believe in this god they almost kick god out of america isn't that right but god is getting ready god has got enough people ready to witness this court one last time oh isn't that right and the angel of the lord just like he was with the book of acts the angel of the lord will go everywhere with you confirming the word with signs confirming the world with wonders confirming the word miracles oh hallelujah hallelujah that's this angel that we're talking about this morning amen do you believe that all right let me read something here now from the brahma's message on the angel of the covenant amen uh verse 46 amen praise god hallelujah amen oh do you love him this morning praise god okay he said it didn't said a thunder head of fire now he said it was a pillar of fire and where it stopped they stopped and then priests watched it and whenever it moved they sounded the trumpets if it was midnight three o'clock in the morning 12 o'clock noon you see they all packed and went packed and away they went they uh followed the pill of fire they kept in the will of the lord by doing so oh how beautiful he said if they ever lost that pill of fire in the new testament he said uh i mean in our age he said through 1500 years of dark ages he said they failed to see it but there was a fellow one day by the name of martin luther and he saw the pillar fire and away he went on the first reformation you see you have to follow this pill of fire wherever it's leading you've got to go praise god we are in the army of the lord this morning and if they wake us up at all 500 hours we've got to move we've got to run and if we don't run we get left behind praise god isn't that right so keep on running this morning we're running away from the world and we're running into christ we are running away from the lld earth and running into rapture into glory priests connie man isn't that right so here he talks about martin luther says he saw the pill of fire and the way he went on the first reformation he said but you know what he organized his church so tight it began to be it was only the lutheran church he was either lutheran or he wasn't it and the pill of fire won't hang over nothing like that oh so you mean there's no it group we are it you are not it the pillar fire by bernab said won't hang over that he don't want no association with that you are not it the pillar fires it if you follow the pill of fire you'll be all right if you are it then you stay with your it but it may not make into the rapture it may not make it into the wedding supper but if you call it a fill of fire oh he will lead you out and out of this pilgrim land hey many many men hallelujah praise god in many man or something huh amen said if he wasn't it see pillow fire wouldn't hang over nothing like that so a wade went and luther couldn't follow it because he uh luther had been uh dead for years and another round of servants of apostles of church and another round another round and just got weakened just like your disciples okay and then the pillar fire moved away from the luton church luther couldn't go because he had all of his rituals and everything wrote up and then there was a little fellow by name of john wesley in england and he saw it and away he went and he had a revival that saved england us in the united states and an english known world in that day isn't that right praise god honey another great revival but then the first thing you know they got so organized down till they begin to get after a few rounds just cold starchy as they could be that's right the pillow fire won't hang over that so a way it went and a bunch of people called pentecostal seen it and away they went after it it is receiving the holy ghost and then they built them a church order but you know the sad part the pentecost is so organized that the pillar fire move out again and they can't go that's right the pillow fire is moving anyhow oh isn't that right god said it would that's right they had the sign of the fire by night and cloud by day that led them he said now tonight here in god's house where that same pillar of fire harlan is here in the house here right now because it was the angel of the covenant the lord jesus christ and when he died he rose again and he lives forever more he promised the things that he did we would do also isn't that right and greater for he went unto the father he said if i not go the comforter cannot come i have to leave this form and come in another form which is the holy spirit which is the watering spirit the protoplanet talked about and spoken with the original seed to water the seed that was in your soul to bring forth another revival to bring forth a manifestation of what the prophets prophesy hallelujah isn't that right praise god amen isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right said okay now it is there today that same pill of fires here because it was the angel of the covenant the lord jesus christ when he died he rose again and he lives forever more he promises the things that he did amen um that we will do also and greater for he went unto the father he said is that right amen any man amen hallelujah isn't that right so we know the pillar fire is here this morning and he's leading his people out he's leading you out pray out of your condition out of your situation out of that message you're in hear a voice this morning someone else calling us up hither come praise our pack your bags we're leaving egypt this morning we're leaving the mess of the world we're going to a higher way we're going to a way of holiness away hallelujah praise god amen the pill of fire knows the way you got to follow the pill of fire you can't trust your own might you can't trust your own strength it's not about your might it's not about your power but it's by his spirit saith the lord that this mountain shall be removed oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah it's a spirit that is going to do the work in your life oh hallelujah isn't that right praise not by much not by power oh hallelujah not by any works of man lest we should boast but it's by the grace of almighty god that we could even make it to this spot this morning that we could even lift our hands up it's the grace of god that we could even shout is the grace of god that we even made it this far [Applause] angel amen dropped down on the earth now what's he here for he's calling names that are in the book calling names isn't that right when jesus took the form of flesh he began to call names he said peter come andrew come philip those were the names in the book they didn't know that they were names but god had a special mission god had a special harlot commission to go after these men hallelujah didn't know they didn't know who they were there were mysteries locked up in god hallelujah but god swore by himself that he would restore that he would bring a pride on the scene oh hallelujah he had had disciples praise god to go after three thousand souls on the day of pentecost they had to be trained they had to be ready to pack this great revival that was about to be played out oh isn't that right [Applause] and i love how jesus operates he's not moving where man is moving he's moving where the spirit is moving and one time they started up a rumor about jesus and they started talk something about jesus and decided to do some things and jesus could have argued a point he could have made his point valid he could have came and made a whole scene of it but he chose to move away the bible said he had another business to tend to the bible said he had needs passed through samaria so he left these men and their confusion and he went up to tamaria he was traveling north but he had to pass through samaria because there was somebody there that he had to talk to there was somebody there that he had to meet oh hallelujah she had an appointment he had an appointment that he had to keep she didn't know she had an appointment she didn't know that that was a day of visitation but god keeps all of his appointments and this morning the angel has an appointment with you and will keep all of his appointments you are his son you are his daughter this morning and he is your father praise god hallelujah and you are going to know him by revelation and by manifestation isn't that right here come jesus pill of fires veiling flesh sitting at a well waiting for a specific woman he told the disciples go and buy some meat go and see about yourselves go get some kfc or something i have something to do that is very important go and delight yourselves with something hallelujah they went out to buy meat oh hallelujah they went out to enjoy themselves and while they went out hallelujah here come this woman oh hallelujah hallelujah coming with her water putt coming to do what she ordinarily doing not even knowing that a pill of fire was there about to do a work in her life whoa hallelujah [Applause] samaria is a strange place they were kind of cut off from the jews as far as history's tell us they weren't very much in relations amen is not right and even more than that this woman was living a contrary life isn't that right so her situation seemed very bleak and nobody wants to talk to her and nobody wants to fellowship with her but there was somebody who wanted to speak to her more than anyone else because this person knew who she was the world thought they had an interpretation of who this woman was you see the devil cannot really tell you who you are even the devil didn't know who jesus was he said if thou be if thou be the son of god do this and do that but jesus gave him the word it is written it is written and it is also written that was his identification oh hallelujah so the devil can't tell you who you are you can't go ask the devil who i am no but there's somebody who knows or a world to oh count hallelujah hallelujah oh he began to talk to this woman oh i'll ask her for a drink of water isn't that right oh holla she could begin to hunt a spirit she had a question she said when the messiah comes they say that he will do these things these earned hearts and whatnot he said woman i am he that speaketh today that woman begin to run brother when god speaks to you you don't walk you run halal when god tells you something in your soul brother something inside of you praise god you just can't contain it you can't explain it it's the love of god speaking to your heart oh hallelujah hallelujah oh her name was in the book we don't know the names in the book but if god speaks to you say amen if god speak to you you worship god this morning because you know you heard from your theophany i can't tell you praise god hallelujah hallelujah the real truth in the way that caught it speaking to you we could preach the revelation we could preach that we're blue in the face but when god we feel something inside of your soul then that's anchored in there then you know god spoke to you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise glory man hallelujah hey many many men all right praise god so we're predestinated hallelujah to receive the holy ghost this morning because we are sons of god and the angel of the covenant is here to keep his agreement you see before the beginning you were somebody hallelujah you are a son of god in the beginning holiday was never trouble there was never a trial

his commandments if you do all that he said to do the holy ghost is to them that obey him isn't that right praise god how did you give the holy ghost to you this morning if you're in full obedience hallelujah full obedience entitles you to the token isn't that right and the token was preached last week and now the angel lord is here to make sure that you get your portion before those six angels those slaughtering angels come through praise god hello michael is here we read it in the scripture revelation seven the four angels are hauling back destruction holding back the four winds nothing is moving until you're the servant of god are sealed praise god with the seal of the living god they are holding back destruction put not the earth hurt not the wind hurt not the sea until we have sealed the holy seal the servants of god in their forehead what are you saying this morning nothing is going to move until god seals you into the kingdom of god god is holding back the destruction this morning don't you know how privileged you are don't you know who you are this morning you are god's people this morning oh hallelujah the devil could watch you but he can't touch you hallelujah hallelujah judgment is waiting to strike but the ceiling must go forth first oh the ceiling time is on this morning receiving the holy ghost [Applause] oh hallelujah okay isn't that right he said now the first man now he said me the first man in this image and we're returning back to that image is that right to our first created image oh hello the one that adam was in where he could speak to the birds speak to the bees all that he had power over every creeping thing that creeped upon the earth every high thing every little thing oh hallelujah he was called on the earth this morning oh holla you don't even know who you are this morning because if you if jesus if if god is the god of the earth and you are his sons then what does that make you this morning ask yourself a question if god is god over the earth and you are his sons and you are his daughters then what does that make you that makes you a little god that makes you a messiah that gives you authority this morning you could go home and take authority over every spirit oh hallelujah hallelujah stick to this man to be moved and don't doubt in your heart you gotta have whatever you ask for oh hallelujah [Applause] and the angel will back it up this morning amen okay amen so we're going back to our first created image amen isn't that right babana speaking i love this part he said when god created me william branham he said i was before the foundational world he made my being my spirit he said i wasn't conscious of anything as far as i know of but he said i was there and he said he said oh i don't believe you're getting it oh he said but now just wait a minute he said jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world isn't that right hallelujah when you wanted a fig tree hallelujah amen isn't that right philip i called you i done already hallelujah praise god seeing you amen in the book isn't that right jesus said and said paul said there that he chose us in him before the world began isn't that right he said and i was some part of me all my never and the rest of you all here that is in jesus christ before the world ever began he said and here's to my analysis of that he said he said and i think that people that the people today are possessed with this spirit or the spirit a part of these angelic beings which are spirits okay let me read that back again i don't want you to miss it he said and here's to my analysis of that he said i think that the people today that are possessed with this spirit amen or or these spirit a part of these angelic beings spirits which rotated off of god do you know who you are now you are not just anybody but you are angelic being a spirit that rotated off of car that's why when you heard the message something inside of you connect something inside of you connect you can't help but say amen because your spirit bear witness with that spirit that you are the son of god praise god hallelujah hallelujah oh holy what can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus he said i am my father and one at that day you shall know i am in the father he and me and i and you and you and me oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah that's why we could have faith for the holy ghost because if we look at ourselves we can never have faith we have too much fallings we have too much shortcomings we made so much mistakes we've done so much sin and we feel like we can't talk to god but if ever you get back connected to your real father i'm not talking about your earthly connections no no no i'm talking about your spirit that rotated off of elohim from before the beginning that same spirit that drew his sword and fought with the dragon that same spirit that kicked lucifer out of heaven when you connect back to that same spirit then you could call for fire in your life because that fire belongs to you that's your fire that's my fire that's our inheritance that belongs to us the holy ghost belongs to us this morning we are not asking for a strange thing we are asking for a portion of our name in the book somebody shout this morning hallelujah praise court oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise him praise him praise him michael is here he is fighting the enemy he's cutting the satan off of your life every situation every trial has brought you to this spot oh hallelujah to this mountain say to this mountain praise

ceiling time is all oh hallelujah hallelujah rider is in the building this morning the angel with the seal is in the building this morning ask what you will michael is in the building this morning the holy ghost is in the building this morning oh hallelujah asking for rain in the time of the rain oh that time is here now it's another time of life oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh can you feel his presence can you feel the witness of his spirit this morning you are not alone you've never been alone you might feel alone but michael is here you might feel like nobody loves you you might feel like nobody cares about you but the angel of the covenant is on the earth now fixing things around for you to be sealed hallelujah praise god hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh somebody's going to be sealed somebody's going to be sealed are you saying are you crying this morning oh hallelujah let this life within me cry i know my redeemer live it oh we know in whom we have believed this morning oh hallelujah yemen you are not an accident you are not a mishap you are not a maybe you are not a oops i'm sorry pray no no no no that's not who you are god ordained your life for this purpose god ordained every step that you would make he knew that you would fall he needed you would get back up he needed she would make this mistake isn't that right joel he knew praise god but he already loved you in his heart and he cannot change his mind about you this morning he's already made his mind up he is not a man that he would lie oh holler you are gonna be adopted praise god shut hallelujah [Music] [Applause] my god my god my god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah lift up your heads retention draw at night darkness cover the earth cross darkness cover the people but at that time michael shall stand up the great prince which standing for the children of our people isn't that right isn't that right that's daniel 12. and i always talked about that scripture that it'd be a great time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time but the bible says at that time when things get messed up at that time when it seems like there's no hope for the world when it seems like satan's got everything covered under his thumb when he's got everything under his power under his control when it seemed like the devil is sitting pretty at that time is when michael shall stand up listen the word stand doesn't just mean physically stand i'm not talking about physically standing up but that word stan means to take up a position that word stand means to take up an authority on the matter that word stand [Applause] glory to god hallelujah oh standing for having done all to stand this morning glory to god hallelujah [Applause] oh you catch what i'm saying this morning so in the beginning when we were fighting with biker michael recognized that we took our stand with him we took up our position in the matter we resisted the devil's lie we resisted the devil's confusion we resisted the devil's interpretation we took the word and we fought the devil out and michael recognized your stance and michael is here this morning to stand for you you're all confused i don't know if i get the holy ghost but michael is here to stand for you you stood at me i'll stand for you praise god stand still and see the salvation of our god [Applause] we got the victory this morning oh the devil thought he had us oh the devil don't have us we got the devil because when we get to realize who we are who god is and who the devil is brother the rapture could go at any minute oh hallelujah because you recognize your position in christ isn't that right you are in heavenly places and brother branham said heavenly places is the position in christ and when you find your position then god could speak to you he told abraham to come out i'll show you a place i'll show you a city i'll show you a land abram began to walk but lot was written it's only when he separated from lot then god could speak to abraham i said look to the west look to the lord look to the south all of it is yours i couldn't tell you that before when you were all caught up in this humanistic hallelujah in this family business but when you come out of that then god will show you something walk before me abraham and beat our perfect oh hallelujah [Applause] he was going to have a son isn't that right hallelujah tested it for 25 years seemed like nothing would happen seemed like nothing would move harlem isn't that right go on come along to abraham three men hallelujah visited the tent isn't that right elohim michael and gabriel they come down to visit abraham and to talk to abraham a little while hallelujah if they come to show him something shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing as he is heir of the earth because of who abraham was good god could no longer hide his mysteries god could no longer hide his secrets because his man was now on the earth only his people was now on the earth represented through abraham oh and there's a people in the land this morning oh hallelujah there's a job for you to do and god can no longer hide the secret of his heart this morning he is about to pour out the greatest manifestation of omnipotence that this world has ever seen he's got to whisper into your air this morning he is making you ready this morning oh hallelujah praise god amen [Music] hallelujah okay hallelujah isn't that right oh my please god i'm already on here now speaks to abraham talking with him in the tent and there's syria in the back and she's doing her thing and part ventures she's hearing them she's eavesdropping isn't that right and the holy spirit amen to this man rather speaks to abraham and says surely say we'll have this son and sarah at that point the bible says she laughed within herself i'm not talking about it the loud laugh there's a loud laugh everybody knows a loud laugh you're happy excited but this was a cynical laugh isn't that right this was a hidden laugh not even abraham heard this laugh he was talking to the man in the tent and she laughed within herself her siblings didn't hear it the people around didn't hear it this was her silent interpretation of what that man was saying and while she laughed the holy spirit picked it up and a man spoke and said why therefore did sarah laugh and i could believe at that moment her eyes popped open she was surprised she didn't think that anyone had heard her she ran outside she said no no no it wasn't me she tried to deny it but god said i know that you left i heard it when you laughed praise god isn't that right the bible talks about a father which seeth in secret isn't that he can see the secret things the things that we tried to hide the thing that you tried to cover up he sees it he knows it he knows what you're going through this morning he knows what is in your mind this morning he knows that you have doubts he knows that you have fears sarah doubted herself that she could have pleasure with her lord after that she was old and apparent but god had a different plan god have a different thing and it didn't matter how much unbelief sarah had in her heart god said that he would bring through sarah the promise of isaac and through you god will fulfill all i was promised you are the one that god has been looking for all this time you might doubt yourself but don't you worry god is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all you could ask oh hallelujah he knows the secrets this morning hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right look at tanya daniel is there king nebuchadnezzar has a dream a terrifying dream but he forgets it and he called his wise men and his sages prophets and asked them to reveal to him the dream and they can't do it and he gets frustrated and he goes to daniel and tanya says go king give me some time because i know a god that is the revealer of all secrets he knows the secrets that you cannot tell the secrets that you cannot see the secrets oh you cannot explain he knows every secret every mystery isn't that right isn't that right the devil when he came into the garden of eden adam was not aware his back was turned he's slipping subtly and began to begin leave and begin to tell a different thing i began to talk to eve and ask her what did god say and then he began to attack the word and when he got the word he got thrown off the world he caught her right there and entertained her mind isn't that right he slipped down in secret and when god's back was turned adam's back was turned and didn't know what was going on the devil was slipping into the picture when god came back to the garden of eden he found a big mess that was there he found a big corruption that was there in so much that he cried out adam adam where are you why are you not in your position why are you not in your place that i left you at before i came isn't that right oh hallelujah and god purpose in his heart that i trusted the devil the devil think he knows about secrets but just as the devil came down in secret and messed up god's eden god is now ready to come down in secret and mess up the devil's eater oh hallelujah same and somebody this tip and thought he was slippery the sip and thought he was subtle but here's a bride she don't even know our own fullest potential but one day you're gonna know as you are known and the great secret of god's heart will be revealed upon you oh hallelujah in secret you slip past the devil in secret you slip past the enemy oh the devil don't even know who you are if thou be if thou be but every day we're getting stronger every day we're proving something to the devil totally we fail but we may fall there's a part of us in this morning that comes from immortality that is going back to immortality oh hallelujah oh we are here as a witness of a true and living car isn't that right look even mary she's pregnant and she and joseph actually passed through jerusalem on their way with the messiah praise god isn't that right didn't even know that messiah was among them while the scribes was looking and looking uh for the prophecy of this man child and so far and didn't know what's going on some of them didn't was so 400 years caught up in the thing and caught up in a religious realm they didn't even were aware that this little woman with a baby in her stomach the messiah was passing through jerusalem on her way to bethlehem isn't that right going to give birth to the messiah and jerusalem was looking for him jerusalem was first praise god looking for him to come in their own interpretation and he was a humble little woman riding on a little donkey joseph by her side oh hallelujah holidays are getting shorter and she's about to have that baby and jerusalem don't even know the urgency of the hour oh not even herod knows the urgency of the hour that the stars are beginning to line up and that star bethlehem was going to lead those wise men onto the messiah oh what are you saying this morning the devil doesn't know who you are this morning the devil doesn't know that you are the greatest secret oh you were so secret that god slipped you under the seventh seal and dropped silence under there oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh and then what happened michael dropped down revelation 10 with a cloud closed o hal a rainbow upon his head feet as it were the sun pillars of fire hallelujah features pillars of fire isn't that right what he come down with he come down with the book of names he didn't come down with a closed book but he came down with an open book an open book with names names of people on the earth that were to be called in their season and in their time oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and your name was in there and my name was in there and when that angel dropped down he come down to a prophet isn't that right when that cloud appeared in arizona god told the prophet are you looking at the picture right the prophet saw the clown and formation and the angels all that isn't that right but god told the prophet ask the prophet question are you looking at the picture right he said turn the picture to the right and when he turned it to the right seven angels consolation become one picture which was jesus christ oh hallelujah seven angels become one voice the voice of the archangel [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right now god takes his man but not his spirit god took the prophet but not that angel that angel is still on the earth this morning he's already used a prophet in the fullness of his capacity all of the mysteries are revealed he has gone on there is nothing more for the prophet to do but god is waiting now for our bride to come on the earth to be the fulfillment of the prophecy that that prophet spoke that is why you are here this morning that is why judgment has to wait until the sons of god find their position then the rapture could go then the earth could move and the sun could be blotted out then all these things could happen but not before you receive your sealing of the holy spirit not before you become a witness of his resurrection oh hallelujah god will have a pride on the earth once more we will hear ty wrecked from core yay many men wow preschool time is fast pen please go to man but uh hallelujah please god okay let me skip down here now okay wanna readers here angelo covenant said i heard a radio broadcast recently here's a prophet talking he said where the majority of the great scientists of the world give the world 10 years before total annihilation 10 more years he said no that's just guesswork that was in 1954. amen he said but uh but here's the the hydrogen or oxygen he said if they ever start in a battle with that he said brother he said one burst in here one day and there he said i don't know what will take place just probably sweep the whole world over and that will be it it won't be even a mountain or a tree or a green thing or anything left on the earth just exactly what the bible said isn't that right here's the prophet says here's an encouragement he said but we'll be gone at that time yes sir he said there's a part of us that's immortal isn't that come from god going back to god it's immortal he said no atom no hydrogen or nothing come on now is needed for that it's spirit we'll be caught up in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to meet the lord in the air [Applause] oh hallelujah isn't that right oh my okay let me read this quick you know uh second coming of the law said the church but we examined himself by the word now he said of purity or loyalty or devotion he said we've become tattlers tailbearers cigarette smokers back biters painted up decibels everything in the calendar the world does the christian church is associating in those things till today you can hardly tell one from the other he said it's time we took inventory is getting late he said now in order he said it's so late that she had to light a candle and she got a candle not only did she get a candle but she got a broom and she went to house cleaning oh how many want to do some house cleaning this morning praise god oh hallelujah your spiritual house isn't that right he said oh brother if there's ever need a time of lighting a candle the sending forth of the gospel light the holy ghost back into the church not so much for an emotion not for some fantastics not for some emotional workup or for a jump of joy jump for joy but a heart searching experience when men and women get right with god he said we are right we are at the end time oh hallelujah people want to jump for joy people want to worship on the shouts but it comes as a sacrifice it's got to come at a cost there's no revival that ever broke out that didn't come with a labor that didn't come at a cost that didn't come at a cost to pray that they never come out of course hallelujah to being at the altar or into searching yourself oh hallelujah something that you've got to do before god does his thing you've got to do your thing before god pours out the holy spirit you've got to live right you've got to do it praise god you've got to do the house cleaning emails nareng and she lit a candle to give a light and brother he said every little candle in here ought to be lit tonight not only that but she got the broom and the neighbors could see the dust fly she had a real house cleaning time oh hallelujah hallelujah oh she was praying she was crying she was crying out hallelujah in the spirit house cleaning time isn't that right for her husband was about to come isn't that right and we say the bridegroom is about to come and if he caught her with that one coin out she was a harlot brother we the church of the living god in these great hours that we're now living in he said it behooves us to check up go before god light the candle of the word of the gospel and examine ourselves and find out if we're not falling short and especially when we see all these things coming we are at the end time the coming of christ is at hand there's not another hope in the world for the church oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right he said look the church is lollying the church has no conscience anymore you can hardly wake them up the bible said they would come in that condition when they would say law or law delays is coming and they'll be devouring and biting one another and so forth and fighting around it's just exactly that hour everything's ready he said the pages are tuned and as it was like that it's ready for the coming of the law oh hallelujah isn't that right i'm down in maraval i was preaching and he's talking about ezekiel 8 and how god had seen the secret things that jerusalem was doing isn't that right and if you go through it i mean i have time to go through it but the holy spirit took ezekiel up into another realm into our vision realm it was between heaven and earth can say where he could see all that god was seeing and god took him up into a place and showed him a hole and told ezekiel dig the hole and he will see a door and when he saw the door but the god told ezekiel open the door and he will see all the abominations and i begin to think to myself look at what god had to do to show ezekiel all the hidden things that were being done in the city god had to take him to a hole take him through a door to see things that god had already seen amen isn't that right so people coming to church and hiding but they don't know that god has already seen you god is seeing what you are doing praise god he's seeing your attitude he's seeing what approach you have into the gospel he's seeing how you're praying he's seeing if you are searching for god he is seeing if you are really genuine about this gospel that we are preaching he wants to know what is in your heart he wants to know that you are making things right that you are doing all that you could do to be ready when he comes isn't that right he said i come quickly and my reward is with me to do what to give every man as his work shall be isn't that right oh hallelujah hallelujah so you'll be rewarded according to your work isn't that right okay hey man i'm gonna write the wrongs up said now when i was here the other time i tried to tell you um god's confirming the word with signs one doesn't miracles and so forth okay i'll skip back marquee you know he said he said now look at the age we're living in you know he said now to my opinion this is the age of the turning time it's a time when men are either will come into the kingdom of god or be sealed out of the kingdom of god he said and i believe that the antichrist seals a person he said we're taught in the scriptures in the book of revelation if any man receives his seal or his mark or the letter of his name and so forth is doomed is sealed out of the kingdom of god and the spirit of christ come on now when once sealed with that you are sealed into the kingdom of god oh that's what i want this morning not to be sealed out but to be sealed in to the kingdom of god hallelujah isn't that right when noah and all of his family went into the ark the door was shut at the shutting of the door they were sealed in the world and everything else outside was sealed out the animals were in everything were packed in and ready there was no more names to be called that was it judgment was set hallelujah and all who were in was in and all who was out is out isn't that right what does that mean filthy filthy still holy holy still there is coming that time friends where the tide will turn over to the jews and where there were no more blood left for the gentiles but before that time make sure this morning that you are sealed in oh honey make sure that you are sealed into the kingdom of god by the baptism of the holy ghost and fire in your heart and in your life that you are applying this token that you are living praise god this life of jesus christ that we are so earnestly contending for this morning hallelujah it's not about playing church hallelujah but it's been being real with god honey being real since saying your heart one time one a man came up to brother branham and he said brother branham they told me to come and talk to you but rather said what's what's wrong so the man said well i wanted to receive christ in my heart he said and i used to go to church with my wife and so on and he said but i wanted to receive god in my heart and i didn't know how he said and i saw a piece of paper written somewhere about uh where will you spend eternity and he said right there the man he got a conviction and he decided he wanted to serve the lord and he said he was wealthy he had money he said he started to sell out his business and his cars and he just wanted to know god's will for his life and he said he went to bethlehem's church and the methodist church told him do this thing and he'll be all right and he did it but he wasn't satisfied he went to the baptist church he went to this church he went to that church and he still wasn't satisfied and the brother of the brother said i come to you but about him because i don't have an answer i want to find christ and brother branham said listen let's go back to the story let's go back to the beginning of this story he said what made you want to serve god he said well i looked at a piece of paper he said that was it he said right there something in your heart began to ask a question and right there you started searching for god he said it doesn't matter what church you go to it doesn't matter how much you jump doesn't matter how much you shout please go but it's the life it's it's a praise god it's that thing in your heart that's crying out for a reality he said that's the thing that is connecting to god not the tides you pay come on now that's fine that's all right all that is church order hallelujah but more than that there's a deeper desire within to want to know god to want to be with god to want to have that seal that mark of the holy ghost in your life to want to have that witness of his spirit oh halal where he go you go where he lead you follow that's what we want this morning enoch walked with god and was not but god took him and he had a testimony that he pleased core not his mother not his father but it was about god what he was doing for the kingdom isn't that right oh my my hallelujah amen praise god he said now if you come tonight uh this is on manifestation of spirit okay he said uh he said no if i come to you tonight listen closely if i come to you tonight and said i had the spirit of a criminal john dillinger and john jillian just prayed us on me he said you'd expect me to have big guns and be a big outlaw like he was and if i had his spirit that's what i would do he said you know god never takes his spirit from the earth god takes his man but never his spirit he said do you know what say for he took elijah a double portion of elijah's spirit come upon elijah is that right and several hundred years later he come out in john the baptist same spirit isn't that right and it's predicted to come out on the last day is that right god takes his man but not his spirit his spirit remains here and when his when the spirit's gone the church is gone then he said then there'll be no more salvation no more care mercy's over then the spirit's gone he said the holy spirit was upon the apostles that was upon the apostles is here tonight that same holy spirit god takes his man but never his spirit amen musicians could begin to come now if i told you i had the spirit of this famous outlaw uh you'd expect me to act like him to be anointed like him and if i told you i had the spirit of some famous artist you'd expect me to stretch your canvas out here and catch waves of the ocean and things like that he said if i had a spirit and if i confess to have the spirit of jesus on us then we should do the things that jesus did jesus said he could do nothing but what the father showed him amen isn't that right he said now when the angel of the lord appeared to moses it wasn't moses it was the angel of god and when he when he appeared oh what was he when he appeared a pill of fire isn't that right and he led the children of israel and then his scholar knows that that was the angel of the covenant which is christ isn't that right and he's the same yesterday today and forever and as he read uh and as he read the lead uh the lead church back there in the natural body he's leading us today in the spiritual body hey many men isn't that right a few more quotes i'm closing here praise god they love him this morning amen so the angel of the covenant is here to lead us out lead you into your ceiling lead you into your filling lead you into the holy ghost amen amen lead you into your place and crash don't stay where you are this morning oh hallelujah to stand still is death oh but keep on moving keep on moving into the presence of god keep on moving into the atmosphere of god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh amen okay question and answers on genesis he said what is where what is remnant what is remnant he said the piece that's cut left same kind of goods isn't that right he said you go to cut a dress out of calcu or patton or something he said and he spread out a big piece of calco and cut it out he said it's your business where you laid a pattern and it's god's business where he lays the pattern he cuts her right out is that right and now this rest of this calculus left here it's just as good is uh it's just as good a calico as in in the in the dress is that right but it's god's election god elects his church god predestinates his church god for ordained that ordains his church and he takes his church out and the remnant is left to go through the tribulation period isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right oh my my my praise god looking to close out here now he said uh praise god he said now we're coming to that mark of god he said i got 30 minutes remember the mark of the beast is not communism mark of the beast comes from rome throughout the world catholicism with protestant protestant uh protestantism joined into it organized religion they're going to unionize the churches till every church will have to bow to that thing or enter the nominations up or kick to the sideline isn't that right revelation 9 chapter he said and it was commanded that it should not hurt the grass or the trees neither any green thing neither any tree but those men which have not the seal of god in their forehead he said when the plagues was coming only thing that was protected was those who were sealed away into the kingdom of god he said this is the investigating judgment when men and if god helped me he said uh with the word of the lord that is at the time of the sealing of the plagues and those things are rejected there is nothing left but eternal punishment hey many men hallelujah do you love him he could begin to please something softly hallelujah i'll end this off here with his quote the seal of god 11 this morning let's talk about that seal and we closed he said well did he ever see a railroader loading cars he said he'll go out and set so much hair and so much there the inspector comes by he looks in he said and if this is a little loose it shakes nope he said i won't seal it got to tear it out and do it over again next thing he'll do is try to load it again he'll get this wrong the inspector will come by wrong do it over again and that's what god has been doing with his church for a long time you load up and you're going to heaven you're taking everything with you your card games huh every other thing that you can load into the church you're trying to take it with you god just condemns it ain't ready for sealing but when god sees a man contract broken spirit sincere in heart down at the altar god closes the
