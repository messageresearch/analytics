[13:34] chills and fever this is from brother
[13:36] Michael Blackman let us bhead once more
[13:39] Heavenly Father we bring your son and
[13:41] servant to you by the black man Lord
[13:42] that you would visit him and touch him
[13:44] from the crown of his head to the sore
[13:46] of his feet he had Faith to reach out to
[13:48] believe and the Saints in praying that
[13:51] you would hear an answer because you
[13:53] work through prayer Lord you use prayer
[13:56] as a tool Lord as this is part of the
[13:58] Christian
[13:59] armor this thing called prayer and we

[14:07] name I ask it amen and amen God bless
[14:10] you and thanks again for being here and
[14:14] we going to start tonight and we looking
[14:16] to see what the Lord will do among us as
[14:19] the meeting comes up we want to be
[14:21] praying that the hand of God will be
[14:23] upon us in everything that we do because
[14:27] God have to find a people what have to
[14:29] find people that be praying people that
[14:31] you could use and so on and you know
[14:35] like when they come to church you have
[14:37] to believe that in that service that the
[14:40] man of God that will step forward to
[14:42] speak that God will speak through him if
[14:44] we don't have the faith and confidence
[14:46] that God will do that then we like we're
[14:48] wasting our time we have to have
[14:50] confidence that this God and I always
[14:53] say some recently about what BR talk
[14:56] about he knows when every fly bat his
[14:58] eye
[14:59] and when you think about it he knows
[15:03] everything and I sharing with brother
[15:05] Clarence I believe yes by Clarance that
[15:09] God is omnipotent and he's omnicient so
[15:13] he knows all things Satan doesn't know
[15:16] all things so I was telling by the
[15:19] Clarance that Satan was waiting for this
[15:22] technological Advanced uh uh age that
[15:27] they could have all these systems and
[15:29] all these things to get information
[15:31] personal information total knowledge
[15:33] through technology it's really the god
[15:36] of knowledge the God of this evil age
[15:39] the prince of the power of the air this
[15:42] is what is happening he needs this
[15:45] technological advancement to pursue his
[15:49] agenda we on the other hand are
[15:52] challenged to our hearts to turned back
[15:55] to the fate of the fathers because no
[15:58] technology could defeat the real fate of
[16:01] our fathers when Peter was in prison the
[16:04] church went into desperate prayer and
[16:07] God opened up the prison and let Peter
[16:10] out in so much that when Peter appeared
[16:12] they say it it was his Angel it was so
[16:15] as such astonishment to know that the
[16:17] church no Peter couldn't get himself out
[16:19] but prayer could have and this is what I
[16:22] want you to see tonight the power of a
[16:24] believing Church The Power of a Praying
[16:27] Church The Power of a Praying people
[16:29] the power of praying individuals so I
[16:32] just want to go into scriptures tonight
[16:33] from Ephesians 6 familiar scripture
[16:36] verse 10 are we going to read finally my
[16:39] brethren we read that on Wednesday night
[16:41] be strong in the Lord and the power of
[16:43] His might put on the whole armor of God
[16:45] that you may able to stand against the
[16:47] Wes of the devil for we wrestle not
[16:49] against flesh and blood but against
[16:51] principalities against Powers against
[16:53] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[16:56] spiritual wickedness and high places
[16:58] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[17:01] of God that you may be able to withand
[17:05] in the evil day having done all to stand
[17:08] stand therefore having your loins good
[17:09] about with truth having on the
[17:11] breastplate of righteousness your feet
[17:13] shut with the preparation of the gospel
[17:15] of peace above all taking the shield of
[17:17] Faith whereit he shall be able to quench
[17:19] all the fiery darts of the wicked and
[17:21] take the helmet of salvation and the
[17:24] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[17:26] God note that there is no protection for
[17:28] the back you have a breastplate of
[17:30] righteousness but your back is not
[17:32] protected there's no protection for the
[17:33] back and that is why we should stand
[17:35] back to back with one another you look
[17:37] out for me and I look out for you but
[17:39] this is the verse we want to get on to
[17:40] tonight Verse 18 praying always with all
[17:44] prayer and supplications in the spirit
[17:49] and watching there unto with all
[17:52] perseverance and supplication for All
[17:56] Saints ver 19 and for me
[17:59] so imagine this Paul is asking for
[18:04] prayer what for and for me that
[18:07] utterance may be given unto me that I
[18:10] may open my mouth boldly to make known
[18:13] The Mystery of the gospel for which I am
[18:16] an ambassador in bonds and therein I may
[18:19] speak boldly as I ought to speak now let
[18:23] me say this here I sent a note out from
[18:26] the pastor's desk and this week and I
[18:29] was sharing about the Believers that
[18:31] will be coming from different parts to
[18:33] this convention I believe we have two
[18:35] people coming as far as Australia to
[18:37] come to Trinidad for these
[18:39] meetings um those who choose to come
[18:43] make serious personal sacrifices not
[18:45] just in the distance to come here but
[18:47] even financially they are making a
[18:50] sacrifice to come here we are expected
[18:54] each one to make a sacrifice and if you
[18:57] don't something not clicking right
[19:00] because they are making a sacrifice
[19:02] because they believe they are coming and
[19:05] it is a it's it's going to give them a
[19:07] breakthrough a blessing a turn a change
[19:10] they come in because they they they are
[19:13] hungering and tasting not that we have
[19:15] something but that together this could
[19:18] be a bonfire a transformational bonfire
[19:22] that will change the course of things
[19:25] but R we know that the Holy Ghost will
[19:27] go across the world overnight
[19:29] what we don't know is where and when it
[19:32] will start we don't know and we cannot
[19:34] declare God's season by faith we could
[19:36] say stuff and say things but God is the
[19:40] one who interprets seasons and times
[19:42] that is what and there's a time for the
[19:46] the lingering time there's a time for
[19:48] mechanics there'll be a time for
[19:49] Dynamics there a time for word seed
[19:52] there a time for rain Spirit water so we
[19:56] have to move in God's timing now
[19:59] Faith works with patience for the
[20:01] promise to be confirmed real faith is
[20:04] never frustrated real faith is never
[20:07] depressed in that sense because Faith
[20:09] knows that God can't lie so you could
[20:12] rest your Hope on what God have said so
[20:15] let's continue so I say I want to drop
[20:17] that in about the Believers coming in
[20:18] all right now this text that we read
[20:22] about praying always with all prayer and
[20:24] supplication in the spirit you know I
[20:26] never really focused on this testament
[20:28] which Focus tonight and in the Amplified
[20:31] it says pray at all times so this is a
[20:34] charge to prayer all times but let's go
[20:37] further in it pray at all times on every
[20:41] occasion in every season in other words
[20:44] prayer don't have nothing to do with
[20:45] summer autumn winter spring no season no
[20:48] change prayer is prayer Pray at all
[20:50] times on every occasion in every season
[20:53] in the spirit listen with all manner of
[20:58] prayer and and
[20:59] entreaty I want you to underline that
[21:02] all manner of prayer and entreaty to
[21:05] that end keep alert and watch with
[21:10] strong purpose and perseverance
[21:13] interceding in behalf of All Saints God
[21:17] consecrated people and pray also for me
[21:20] that freedom of utterance may be given
[21:22] me that I may open my mouth to
[21:26] proclaim the mystery of the good news of
[21:29] the gospel and in that light I want you
[21:32] to pray not just only for Sunday service
[21:34] that's coming but pray for the
[21:35] convention that will be coming up at the
[21:37] end of this week next week that God
[21:40] would give the ministers all who would
[21:42] speak all who would greet all who will
[21:45] testify that his spirit will come upon
[21:47] their mouths and they will speak on
[21:50] behalf of God and speak Spirit spoken
[21:53] word to God's people utterance that be
[21:55] given not only just utterance but at the
[21:57] pillar of Fire rest on their shoulder
[21:59] and God by his Spirit could speak right
[22:02] out this is what I want you to have in
[22:04] your heart as praying tonight all right
[22:07] all manner of prayer and ENT
[22:09] treaty prayer is of various kinds I want
[22:14] you to note this tonight it have prayer
[22:16] of confession it have formal prayer it
[22:19] have prayer of Deliverance it have
[22:21] silent prayer it have vocal prayer it
[22:23] have public petitionary prayer
[22:26] supplication desperation inter
[22:29] and I want to just go a few tonight
[22:31] under intercession this is how Moses in
[22:34] Exodus 32 intered for Israel after the
[22:37] made the golden calf and this is verse
[22:40] 11 and Moses besought the Lord his God
[22:43] and said the people misbehaving the
[22:46] people kind out with their foolishness
[22:48] and here Moses picture here is Moses
[22:51] attitude and Moses besought the Lord his
[22:53] God and said Lord why do thy wrath wax F
[22:57] against thy people
[22:58] which had thou has brought forth out of
[23:00] the land of Egypt with great power and
[23:02] with a mighty hand wherefore should the
[23:05] Egyptian speak and say for Mischief did
[23:08] he bring them out to slay them in the
[23:10] mountains and to consume them from the
[23:12] face of the Earth turn from thy Fierce
[23:15] wrath and repent of this evil against
[23:19] thy people could you imagine Moses
[23:22] asking go to repent verse 13 He said
[23:25] remember Abraham Isaac and Israel thy
[23:29] servants to whom thou swearest by thine
[23:32] own self and say unto them I will
[23:35] multiply your seed as the stars of
[23:37] heaven and all this land that I have
[23:39] spoken of will I give unto your seed and
[23:42] they shall inherit it forever and verse
[23:45] 14 stunning verse and the Lord repented
[23:49] of the evil that he taught to do unto
[23:53] his people I want you to take that
[23:56] caption as how you could see praying
[23:59] with all supplication and interceding on
[24:03] behalf of the Saints there are great
[24:05] needs among us there are great
[24:07] conditions among us there are great
[24:09] issues and challenges in homes and
[24:12] families Among Us you can't just pray
[24:15] for yourself you just can't pray for
[24:17] your story there are others and I pray
[24:20] God that God lay upon your heart to pray
[24:22] for others if you don't remember who to
[24:24] pray for look where they have
[24:26] participants here tonight and just pick
[24:28] any name and pray for them look at any
[24:31] name you see there you might even met
[24:33] the person know the person but say Lord
[24:35] that name that that that representation
[24:37] there are bringing them before you are
[24:39] crying out unto you Lord that is what I
[24:41] want you to do tonight let's continue
[24:44] this is Samuel Samuel 1 Samuel 7 5-9 and
[24:49] here what it says and Samuel said gather
[24:51] all Israel to
[24:53] mispe and I will pray for you unto the
[24:56] Lord and they gather together misp and
[24:59] Drew water and poured it upon the Lord
[25:01] and fasted that day and said we have
[25:03] sinned against the Lord and Samuel
[25:08] judged the children of Israel in
[25:10] misp and when the Philistines heard that
[25:14] the children of Israel were gathered
[25:15] together to misp the Lords of the
[25:18] Philistine went up against Israel and
[25:20] when the children of Israel heard it
[25:22] they were afraid of the Philistine now
[25:25] listen to verse 8 and the children of
[25:27] Israel set to Samuel cease not to cry
[25:31] unto the Lord Our God for us that he
[25:34] will save us out of the hand of the
[25:37] Philistines here the climax in verse 9
[25:41] and Samuel took a suckling lamb offered
[25:44] it for a burnt offering holy unto the
[25:46] Lord and Samuel Cried unto the Lord for
[25:52] Israel and the Lord heard him oh my this
[25:56] is so great tonight pressure under
[25:59] attack from Philistine you know you're
[26:01] not ready for that battle you know you
[26:03] will get lick up but here it is somebody
[26:05] could stand in the Gap and pray note the
[26:09] attitude of the children of Israel at
[26:11] that time they said Don't Stop Don't
[26:13] Stop you talk to God on our behalf and
[26:16] the Bible said God heard Samuel oh just
[26:20] a few more I we wrap up prayer of
[26:23] confession Psalms 51 this is David said
[26:26] have mercy upon me oh God
[26:29] according to thy loving kindness
[26:32] according unto the multitude of thy
[26:33] Tender Mercies blot out my
[26:36] transgression Wash Me thoroughly from my
[26:39] iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
[26:43] silent prayer through Samuel 1112 to13
[26:47] Hannah it came to pass as she continued
[26:51] praying before the Lord that the line
[26:53] marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in
[26:56] her heart only your lips smooth but her
[26:59] voice was not heard therefore Eli
[27:02] thought she had been drunken have we
[27:04] know the story of Hannah and Hannah
[27:07] persevered and pressed through and you
[27:09] will see Hannah prayer change from
[27:11] Silent prayer to a supplication before
[27:14] god let's continue praise the Lord s
[27:19] under supplication pray now 1 Samuel 1
[27:23] and and she was in bitterness of soul
[27:25] and prayed unto the Lord and wept saw
[27:28] and she vowed a vow and said oh lord of

[27:33] Affliction of thine handmaid and
[27:35] remember me and not forget thine
[27:37] handmade but will give unto thine
[27:39] handmade a man child then I will give

[28:11] no pretense in this prayer he's not
[28:13] saying I right and them wrong and

[28:17] pretend something there is absence of
[28:19] pretense in Daniel he said behold our
[28:22] what our desolation okay and the city
[28:26] which is called by thy name for we do

[28:49] thou respect unto the prayer of thy
[28:51] servant andto supplications oh Lord my
[28:53] God to Heen unto the cry to the prayer
[28:56] which thy servant prayed before thee
[28:57] today th eyes may be open towards this
[28:59] house night and day do you understand
[29:02] that as we read these scriptures as you
[29:03] read your own Bible and you read the
[29:04] scriptures you could draw from how these
[29:07] men pray for you to pray for you to
[29:09] understand how you must pray and talk to
[29:10] God my name you said even unto the was
[29:12] the place where thou said my name shall
[29:14] be there that thou May Heen unto the
[29:17] prayer which thy servant shall make
[29:18] toward the place and Heen thou to the
[29:20] supplication of thy servant and of thy
[29:22] People Israel when they shall pray
[29:24] towards this place and hear th in Heaven
[29:27] by thy DW in place and and when they and
[29:29] when th hearest
[29:31] forgive one
[29:32] more
[29:34] desperation we know this one 2 Kings 20
[29:37] Hezekiah word come that your time is up
[29:39] man time to go and then Hezekiah turned
[29:44] in other words let's say something
[29:45] something confronting you and it look
[29:46] like if this is what is ahead of you you
[29:48] could actually ask God and God could
[29:51] change things wrong then he turned his
[29:54] face to the wall and prayed onto the and
[29:56] said I beseech thee oh God remember me
[29:58] how I have walked before thee in truth
[30:01] with a perfect heart and have done that
[30:03] which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah
[30:05] wept s and while the prophet was walking
[30:07] up the same Prophet had told him time up
[30:09] you got to go go tell that Prophet go
[30:11] back and tell that man your life is
[30:14] spared things have changed oh give the
[30:16] Lord some Praises tonight how many would
[30:19] like God to do that for you tonight for
[30:21] for whatever things are in front of you
[30:23] and God bring a word and said things
[30:25] have changed because of your prayer
[30:27] tonight and we close with this
[30:30] Hallelujah brother
[30:33] br oh we have a few more wow all right
[30:36] okay but BR our dear Lord Jesus himself
[30:38] in the world greatest Battleground
[30:40] Gethsemane he cried out in despair
[30:42] should he take the sins of the world or
[30:45] should he just remain on Earth and his
[30:46] beloved with his beloved disciples what
[30:48] he wanted to do but what his humility as
[30:52] he humbled himself not my will but thine
[30:55] be done humble himself to the word the
[30:58] promised word of God of Heaven notice he
[31:01] went a little further and if he went a
[31:03] little further how much more we to go a
[31:06] little further notice the scripture says
[31:08] in Luke he prayed earnestly brother
[31:11] sister if Jesus had to pray earnestly
[31:15] how much more have we got to pray
[31:17] earnestly if Christ the god of Heaven
[31:19] made flesh had to pray earnestly then
[31:21] how much more we Sinners and saved by
[31:23] grace pray earnestly if the decision
[31:25] thrown to the Son of God into the SP if
[31:28] it into this Spar what will it do you
[31:30] and I desperately we must cry we have to
[31:34] cry we have to ask God for our own
[31:36] Deliverance Matthew 6:13 and lead us not
[31:38] into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil
[31:41] for thine is the Kingdom power and the
[31:44] glory Philippians 4:6 in the amplifi Do
[31:47] Not fret or have any anxiety about
[31:50] anything stop freten but in every
[31:53] circumstance and in everything by prayer
[31:56] and petition which is definite request
[31:59] so petitioning is a is that Lord bless
[32:02] me Lord in Jesus name bless my family
[32:04] bless the house bless the car bless
[32:06] everything no no no petition is definite
[32:09] request you could write it down and you
[32:11] could see when you pray for it and you
[32:13] could see when God answer that prayer
[32:16] definite request with Thanksgiving
[32:18] continue you what the Bible says
[32:20] continue to make your wants known to
[32:25] God and 1 Timothy 21 I know we lot of
[32:28] scriptures tonight I exal therefore
[32:30] first of all supplication prayer
[32:33] intercession and giving of thanks be
[32:36] made to all men Mark 13 this is the
[32:39] amplifier I'm going to read be on your
[32:41] guard constantly alert and watch and
[32:44] pray for you do not know when the time
[32:46] will come it's like a man already going
[32:49] on a journey when he leaves home he puts
[32:51] his servants in charge each with his
[32:53] particular task he give orders to the
[32:56] doorkeeper to be constantly alert and on
[32:58] the watch therefore watch give strict
[33:02] attention be cautious and alert for you
[33:04] do not know when the master of the house
[33:07] is coming in the evening or at midnight
[33:09] or at cro or in the morning what I say
[33:12] least he comes suddenly and unexpectedly
[33:15] and find you asleep what I say unto you
[33:18] I say to everybody this is Jesus watch
[33:21] give strict attention be cautious active
[33:24] and alert and this here is the final
[33:27] quote I have but BR the devil took many
[33:30] of us captive years ago it was a sin for
[33:32] you woman to cut your here but today
[33:35] Pentecostal women look just like the
[33:37] women of the street you can't tell the
[33:39] difference that's right it used to be
[33:41] for a sin in the old days for women to
[33:43] wear makeup today you can't tell the
[33:45] sinner from s what's the matter back to
[33:48] the old human human line again back to
[33:51] re Pentecost back to the old Aza
[33:54] experience and then some of you
[33:56] preachers that let down the bars some of
[33:57] you men you know I'm ashamed of you any
[34:00] man that will call himself a born again
[34:03] child of God and will let his wife act
[34:06] and do the way the pente people let
[34:07] their Woman Act today it shows not very
[34:10] much man about you that's exactly the
[34:13] truth what we need today here we go
[34:16] brother brother BR speaks is a calling
[34:18] back to the oldfashioned baptism of the
[34:21] Holy Ghost and people is right back
[34:24] again that's the truth it may scor a
[34:27] little bit but I rather be scorched here
[34:29] than burn and this is the last part if
[34:33] the devil has took you
[34:36] captive it's Jubilee time it's time to
[34:40] come back to the old experience again
[34:44] back to the oldfashioned Bible back to
[34:47] the place here we go where we can feel
[34:50] the power of God search through that
[34:53] will call men and women to the altar
[34:56] that will make them St on their face all
[34:59] night long and pray to God and seek
[35:02] Deliverance what a time let's bow our
[35:05] heads Heavenly Father this is what come
[35:08] together to share with your people
[35:11] praying with all prayer all supplication
[35:14] all manner of prayer I trust the people
[35:17] grasp is not just one approach there is
[35:21] silent prayer there is prayer of
[35:23] petition there is prayer of Supplication
[35:26] there is prayer of intercession there's
[35:28] all different types Lord there's even
[35:30] prayer against the enemy but Lord
[35:32] tonight help them help them to know that
[35:35] God answers prayer and Prayer Changes
[35:39] Things Lord may it not be a phrase but
[35:42] may they see the reality that if Prayer
[35:44] Changes Things then with my words in
[35:48] faith to God things can change to Me In
[35:52] Me Through Me by me around me Lord
[35:56] change things tonight May a fire fall in
[35:58] every Home Fire Fall upon the husbands

[36:14] seal to put your token upon them granted
[36:18] God we know there are challenges these
[36:20] years ahead Lord we keep saying it and
[36:23] maybe because people don't see terrible
[36:25] things as yet they don't believe it but
[36:28] it will still happen because your word
[36:30] has declared it oh God we cannot change
[36:34] what is going to happen upon the Earth
[36:36] as I was showing my grandson Heil fallen
[36:38] in France about an inch tick oh God and
