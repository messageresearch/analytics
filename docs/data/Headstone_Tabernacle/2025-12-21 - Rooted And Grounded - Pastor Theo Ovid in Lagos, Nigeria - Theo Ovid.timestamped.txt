[19:44] Reading from Psalm chapter 103 [music]
[19:51] for a scripture reading this [music]
[19:52] morning.
[19:54] Amen.
[19:56] Psalms 103 says, "Bless [music] the
[19:59] Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within
[20:03] me, bless [music] his holy name. Bless
[20:07] the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all
[20:11] his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine
[20:14] iniquities. [music] Who healthth all thy
[20:17] diseases. Who redeemth thy life from
[20:20] destruction. [music]
[20:22] Who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[20:25] and tender mercies. Who satisfies thy
[20:28] mouth with good things. That thy youth
[20:31] is renewed like the eagles. [music]
[20:33] The Lord executute righteousness and
[20:36] judgment for all that are oppressed.
[20:38] [music]
[20:39] He made known his way his ways unto
[20:42] Moses [music] and his acts unto the
[20:44] children of Israel. The Lord is merciful
[20:47] and gracious, [music]
[20:49] slow to anger and plenteous in mercy. He
[20:53] will not always chide, neither will
[20:54] [music] he keep his anger forever.
[20:57] He had not dealt with us after our sins,
[21:00] [music]
[21:00] nor rewarded us according to our
[21:02] iniquities.
[21:04] For as the heaven is high above the
[21:06] earth, [music]
[21:07] so great is his mercy toward them that
[21:10] fear him. And as far as the east is from
[21:12] the west, so far has he removed our
[21:15] transgressions from us. [music] May the
[21:18] Lord have blessing to the reading of his
[21:20] word. Let us bow our head. Almighty God,

[36:06] Teach me all [music]
[36:09] to me. [singing]
[36:13] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[36:17] I remember as a young Christian
[36:20] I saw [music]
[36:22] where the Bible telling me young men
[36:23] shall utterly fall and fail but they
[36:26] that [music] wait upon the Lord shall be
[36:27] left and my heart I pray God make me a
[36:31] young man that will wait upon you. You
[36:34] can't ever go wrong waiting upon God.
[36:38] The [music] right answer will come true.
[36:40] When we go in our own strength and our
[36:42] own human spirit, we could get things,
[36:44] we could achieve things, we could
[36:46] conquer things, but when [music] we wait
[36:47] upon the Lord, we know it's God.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; God come down and confirm.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Because I didn't want to run and be
[36:54] weary and faint and fail. I wanted
[36:56] [music] to succeed for God's kingdom.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; And the only way we could do that is
[37:00] when you prepare to wait upon the Lord.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; He has that [music] answer for you.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads tonight. Father God,
[37:05] we thank you for your presence, Lord. We
[37:07] This is our life, Father. not just come
[37:10] into church but to [music] encounter
[37:12] your presence. Without your presence, we
[37:14] just killing time with just words and
[37:16] human. But father god, I pray you come

[43:49] [music]
[43:50] God richly bless you and good morning.
[43:54] God bless you.
[43:56] God bless you.
[44:02] It's great to see We are still in
[44:03] thanksgiving mode. That's what we should
[44:06] be. God, entice us with praise and
[44:10] thanksgiving, letting the devil know on
[44:13] which side you are on. On whose side you
[44:15] are on.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Before you sit
[44:18] down, let me just read to you from 1
[44:20] Corinthians chapter 13 and I'll read
[44:23] verses 1-13.
[44:34] 1 Corinthians 13 and verse one um
[44:37] through verse 13.
[44:39] It reads on these wise.
[44:42] Though I speak with the tongues of men
[44:44] and of angels, and have not charity,
[44:47] &gt;&gt; and become a sounding barazzle, a
[44:49] tingling symbol. And though I have the
[44:52] gift of prophecy, and understand all
[44:54] mysteries, and all knowledge, and though
[44:56] I have all faith so that I could remove
[44:59] mountains, and have not charity, I am
[45:01] nothing.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; And though I bestow all my goods to feed
[45:04] the poor, and though I give my body to
[45:07] be burned, and have not charity, it
[45:09] profited me nothing.
[45:11] Charity suffereth long and is kind.
[45:14] Charity envied not. Charity vaunted not
[45:17] itself. Is not puffed up. Does not
[45:21] behave itself unseemly. Seketh not her
[45:24] own. Is not easily provoked. Thinkketh
[45:27] no evil. Rejustth not in iniquity, but
[45:31] rejusted in the truth.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Be beareth all things. Believeth all
[45:36] things. Hopeeth all things. Endureth all
[45:39] things. Charity never failth.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; But whether there be prophecies, they
[45:45] shall fail.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues, they shall
[45:47] cease.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Whether there be knowledge, it shall
[45:51] vanish away.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; For we know in path, and we prophesy in
[45:55] part. But when that which is perfect is
[45:58] come, then that which is in path shall
[46:00] be done away.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I spoke as a child.
[46:05] I understood as a child. I thought as a
[46:08] child, but when I began, I put away
[46:12] childish things. For now, we see through
[46:14] a glass darkly, but then face to face.
[46:18] Now I know in path, but then shall I
[46:21] know even as also I am known. And now
[46:24] abide in faith, hope, charity, these
[46:27] three, but the greatest of these is
[46:29] charity.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his blessing of
[46:33] his holy words.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Please be seated.
[46:37] Good morning. One more time. God bless.

[52:46] [music]
[52:57] [music]
[53:02] [music]
[53:02] We all
[53:26] [music]
[53:29] are.
[53:31] Hey Heat. Heat.
[53:34] [music]
[53:40] [music]
[53:44] Gat.
[53:53] [music]
[54:06] [music]
[54:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music]
[54:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[54:48] [music]
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:05] One more [music] chance.

[55:29] [music]
[55:39] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. [music]
[55:44] Hallelujah.
[55:46] Glory.
[55:49] [music] The shout of the king
[55:51] is in the camp.
[55:54] HALLELUJAH.
[55:56] GOD IS NOT DEAD. HE IS STILL ALIVE.
[56:00] HALLELUJAH. OH, praise the name of the
[56:03] Lord. God bless you.
[56:06] Welcome to LCL Legos.
[56:10] [music]
[56:12] Oh, it's good to be here.
[56:15] God bless you. May be seated.
[56:19] I'm not much of a talker before the
[56:21] word, [laughter]
[56:24] but I want to bring greetings from the
[56:25] headstone table of Trinidad. We are
[56:28] happy to be identified with you all.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; I've known brother Ulu since 1981. We
[56:34] have been friends ever since.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; And it's a great blessing to be
[56:37] associated with you all.
[56:41] He preached a powerful message in Neri
[56:45] and he took the text, the scripture,
[56:48] uh the thought from what God told
[56:51] brother Brham, if you could get the
[56:52] people to believe you,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; not even cancer will stand in your way.
[56:56] Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; And it's very very powerful because
[56:59] that's not if the people hear you preach
[57:02] or teach, but if the people could see
[57:06] what kind of life you're living
[57:08] &gt;&gt; and believe you to be that kind of son
[57:10] or servant,
[57:11] &gt;&gt; that means God must trust that man
[57:14] &gt;&gt; and then you could trust that man
[57:16] &gt;&gt; because God trusts that man.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; How could you not trust somebody that
[57:20] God trusts? Oh, praise the name of the
[57:23] Lord. So for years we have been
[57:25] identified with this message. But now
[57:28] what you're about to see is the message
[57:30] identify itself with the sons and
[57:33] daughters of God where God can say this
[57:36] is my beloved son. Regardless of what
[57:40] the ministers say, regardless what the
[57:42] message popes, preachers, teachers,
[57:46] INTELLECTUAL GIANTS SAY. THIS IS MY
[57:49] BELOVED son in whom I'm well pleased. or
[57:53] you may be seated. God is not adopting
[57:56] the position the man has.
[57:59] God is not adopting because you're an
[58:01] engineer or a doctor or a pastor or
[58:03] teacher. God adopting the man.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; When Saul failed, he said, "I found a
[58:10] better man."
[58:12] &gt;&gt; He found David. He wasn't READY YET, BUT
[58:15] HE GOD FOUND HIM. HE WASN'T READY YET,
[58:17] BUT GOD ANOINTED HIM. HE WASN'T READY
[58:20] YET, BUT GOD WAS WITH HIM.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. NOT BECAUSE IT DON'T
[58:26] SEEM HE'S NOT THERE. SOMETIME HE JUST
[58:29] STAY SILENT. THEN HE UNVEILS HIMSELF.
[58:32] THEN HE reveals himself. THEN HE SHOWS
[58:35] HIMSELF. GOD IS ALIVE THIS MORNING.
[58:39] HALLELUJAH.
[58:41] So this morning, there's something upon
[58:43] my heart. I like to share with you. If
[58:44] you have your Bibles, I like to turn to
[58:46] Colossians chapter 2. Want to read from
[58:48] verse 5 to 7?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3 from 14-21.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 from 10-17.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Want to read Colossians 2.
[59:04] But my got the Bible. Thank you.
[59:08] When I saw this Bible, he have it all
[59:10] big writing. Got these eyes, you know,
[59:14] these fine print and so on like that.
[59:16] You had to almost get a magnifying glass
[59:18] to read some of these things. So,
[59:20] Colossians chapter 2, reading from verse
[59:21] 5. And though I be absent in the flesh,
[59:25] &gt;&gt; yet am I with you in the spirit,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; joining and beholding your order and the
[59:31] steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; As you have therefore received Christ
[59:37] Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. rooted and built up in him and
[59:44] established in the faith as he have been
[59:46] taught, abounding therein with
[59:48] thanksgiving.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. And then Ephesians
[59:52] 3,
[59:53] reading from verse 14, Paul speaks,
[59:58] above all things,
[1:00:01] above all these things, put on charity,
[1:00:04] which is the bond of the perfectness.
[1:00:07] Let the peace of God rule in your hearts
[1:00:10] to the which also ye are uh you you you
[1:00:15] are uh called into one body and be
[1:00:17] thankful. Let the word of God dwell in
[1:00:20] you richly in all wisdom.
[1:00:23] Something right here.
[1:00:34] Just minute.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Glor
[1:00:50] some.
[1:00:52] All right. I can't blame this new Bible,
[1:00:55] you know.
[1:00:58] But let's let's go to Ephesians 6.
[1:01:01] I want to get I want to get um rooted
[1:01:04] and grounded.
[1:01:07] Huh?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; It's three. What?
[1:01:17] Oh no. I'm still looking in Colossians.
[1:01:20] I'm so sorry. I am still
[1:01:24] looking in Colossians. So I want to know
[1:01:27] where is this scripture?
[1:01:32] Glory. Do you have it? Ephesians. You
[1:01:36] read it first. Yeah. Okay. All right.
[1:01:40] Ephesians chapter 3
[1:01:43] 13 to
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; 14.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; 14 to 21. Okay. All right. For this
[1:01:49] cause I bow my knees unto the father of
[1:01:51] our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[1:01:54] family in heaven and earth is named that
[1:01:56] he would grant unto you according to his
[1:01:58] riches to the riches of his glory to be
[1:02:01] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[1:02:03] the inner man that Christ may dwell in
[1:02:06] your hearts by faith that ye being
[1:02:08] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[1:02:10] to comprehend with all saints what is
[1:02:13] the breadth and length and depth and
[1:02:14] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:02:17] which passeth knowledge that you might
[1:02:19] be filled with all the fullness of God.
[1:02:21] Now unto him that is able to do
[1:02:23] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:02:25] ask or think according to the power that
[1:02:27] workketh in us. Unto him be glory in the
[1:02:30] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:02:31] ages world without end. Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. And on Ephesians
[1:02:37] chapter 6 reading from verse 10.
[1:02:40] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[1:02:41] Lord and the power of his might. put on
[1:02:43] the whole armor of God that he may able
[1:02:46] to stand against the ws of the devil.
[1:02:48] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:02:49] blood, but against principalities,
[1:02:51] against powers, rulers of darkness,
[1:02:53] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:02:54] places. Wherefore take unto you the
[1:02:56] whole armor of God, that you may be able
[1:02:59] to stand
[1:03:01] in the evil with stand in the evil day,
[1:03:03] and having done all to stand, stand
[1:03:05] therefore, having your loins good about
[1:03:06] with truth, having on the breastplate of
[1:03:08] righteousness, and your feet shut with
[1:03:10] the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[1:03:12] Above all, taking the shield of faith
[1:03:14] wherein he shall be able to quench all
[1:03:15] the fiery dust of the wicked and taking
[1:03:17] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:03:20] the spirit which is the word of God.
[1:03:21] Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank
[1:03:22] you for your word and father, you know
[1:03:24] the needs of the people here. Father, I
[1:03:26] pray take me out of the way and may you
[1:03:27] be glorified in our midst. Confirm your
[1:03:29] word with signs, wonders, miracles, and
[1:03:31] healings. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen.
[1:03:34] You may be seated. As I sit down, we
[1:03:35] will give the Lord some praises.
[1:03:38] [cheering]
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; We'll have a title this morning, rooted
[1:03:44] and grounded.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to type that rooted and
[1:03:49] grounded in love. I just say rooted and
[1:03:51] grounded because it have people rooted
[1:03:53] and grounded in foolishness. It have
[1:03:55] people rooted and grounded in nonsense,
[1:03:57] in false doctrine, false teachings, and
[1:03:59] false revelations. So, I just want to
[1:04:01] say rooted and grounded. Everybody going
[1:04:03] to be rooted and grounded in something.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; But you, the bride, will be rooted and
[1:04:07] grounded in love.
[1:04:09] Hallelujah.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Have a subject. Having all done all to
[1:04:13] stand, stand.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Having done all to stand. You have to
[1:04:17] know you have done all
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; then you could stand.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And have an inspiration. Hold the line.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We're going to get to that.
[1:04:24] Hold the line. But Brandham in Titarian
[1:04:28] age, he was talking about the depths of
[1:04:29] Satan. He said it seems this verse has
[1:04:31] been left out by the commentators for
[1:04:33] they were not able to figure out what
[1:04:36] doctrine or what experience are meant by
[1:04:39] this phrase. Actually it is simple to
[1:04:42] know what is meant. What you have to
[1:04:44] experience or know is the depth of God
[1:04:47] and the opposite will be the depth of
[1:04:49] Satan.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; So then he read Ephesians 3, same
[1:04:53] chapter we read that Christ will dwell
[1:04:54] in you to know the love of Christ which
[1:04:57] passeth knowledge.
[1:04:59] and that he might be filled with all the
[1:05:01] fullness of God.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Now in these verses, when a man
[1:05:05] experience the depth of God in his life,
[1:05:07] it is an actual personal experience of
[1:05:11] the spirit of God indwelling him and his
[1:05:15] mind is illuminated by the wisdom and
[1:05:17] the knowledge of God through the word.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; But the depth of Satan will be in that
[1:05:23] he will attempt to destroy this. He will
[1:05:25] attempt to make a substitute for this
[1:05:29] reality of God. How will he do it? He
[1:05:32] will take away the knowledge of the
[1:05:34] truth of God, destroy the word by
[1:05:37] putting his own. Yay had God said he
[1:05:40] will then substitute the personal Christ
[1:05:44] in our spirits.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; So the depths of Satan had been entered
[1:05:49] into that age. and the fruit of the
[1:05:51] depth of Satan are lies, murders, and
[1:05:53] horrible crimes that come from it. Did
[1:05:57] you ever think that those men who ever
[1:05:59] do anything for the kingdom of God stand
[1:06:01] alone? Did you ever think you have to
[1:06:04] stand by yourself? Jesus stood alone.
[1:06:07] All through the ages, he had to stand.
[1:06:10] They had to stand alone. And if you can
[1:06:12] only see, it is God's will to do these
[1:06:14] things for you. It is God's will to save
[1:06:17] you all. It is God's will to heal you
[1:06:19] all and he will literally lead you into
[1:06:22] deeper depths and higher heights. Don't
[1:06:24] be satisfied with your fire built here
[1:06:26] last night. Let us build a little
[1:06:28] further up the road tonight. Never build
[1:06:31] it in the same place. You can't stand
[1:06:34] still. You're either backsliding or
[1:06:36] going forward. Oh, glory to God. Praise
[1:06:40] God. So, you have to choose this
[1:06:42] morning. He said Moses choose the
[1:06:44] affliction and disgrace. Lot had to make
[1:06:46] his choice. 5 years from today, you may
[1:06:49] be a missionary. 5 years from today, you
[1:06:51] may be around Christians. Or 5 years
[1:06:53] from today, you may be in hell because
[1:06:55] you made a wrong decision. So God still
[1:06:58] put it on us to make the right
[1:06:59] decisions. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:07:01] the Lord.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Daniel 10:1. In the 30 of
[1:07:07] Cyrus, king of Persia, a thing was
[1:07:09] revealed unto Daniel, whose name was
[1:07:11] called Beltic Shaza, and the thing was
[1:07:14] true. But the time upon it was long. But
[1:07:17] he understood the thing and understand
[1:07:19] the vision. When the thing is true and
[1:07:22] the TIME IS LONG, YOU HAVE TO HANG IN
[1:07:24] THERE. YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON. YOU HAVE TO
[1:07:27] HOLD THE LINE BECAUSE THIS PROPHECY IS
[1:07:29] TRUE. The thing is true. BUT THE TIME IS
[1:07:33] LONG. OKAY. THE LORD A SHOUT. I CAME TO
[1:07:36] THIS MESSAGE WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS OLD.
[1:07:39] NOW I'M 67. THIS IS 50 YEARS. BUT THE
[1:07:42] THING IS STILL TRUE.
[1:07:44] OH, GLORY TO GOD. IT WAS TRUE WHEN I WAS
[1:07:48] 17. IT IS TRUE RIGHT NOW. COME ON, YOUNG
[1:07:51] PEOPLE. HALLELUJAH. GIVE THE LORD A
[1:07:53] SHOUT. [cheering]
[1:07:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:58] A THING WAS REVEALED TO DANIEL. THE
[1:08:01] THING WAS TRUE, BUT THE time was long.
[1:08:04] You may be seated. Daniel was in Babylon
[1:08:06] for 68 years. 68 years he kept the
[1:08:09] victory and was undefiled before God
[1:08:12] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:14] without THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:08:16] HALLELUJAH. PRAISE. He stood the test in
[1:08:19] the land of his captivity.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. I Daniel by
[1:08:24] books understand the words of the
[1:08:26] prophet Jeremiah what was about TO BE
[1:08:29] ACCOMPLISHED. HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[1:08:32] Praise God. In the MIDST OF ALL OF THAT,
[1:08:34] DANIEL HELD ON TO WHAT JEREMIAH SAID. IN
[1:08:38] THE MIDST OF ALL THIS TIME, WE HELD ON
[1:08:40] TO WHAT THAT PROPHET William Maria
[1:08:42] Brandham said. MAN SAID THIS, MAN SAID
[1:08:44] THAT. WE SAID, "SHUT UP." WE KNOW WHAT
[1:08:46] THE PROPHET said because the spirit, THE
[1:08:49] PROPHET, AND THE BRIDE THE SAME THING.
[1:08:52] OKAY. THE LORD HAS SHOUT IN THE HOUSE.
[1:08:55] HALLELUJAH. I HAVE NO NEW MESSAGE. I
[1:08:57] DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE. I AM PREACHING
[1:08:59] ANOTHER MAN'S MESSAGE. GOD SENT A
[1:09:01] PROPHET, ONE MAN,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; ONE MESSAGE TO GET THAT BRIDE.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering]
[1:09:10] You may be seated. Daniel, no church to
[1:09:12] go to, nobody to fellowship with.
[1:09:15] Everybody went to heathen temples, NO
[1:09:18] CHRISTIAN SONGS, NOBODY BELIEVE THE SAME
[1:09:20] THING HE DID IN 68 YEARS FROM A YOUNG
[1:09:24] MAN FROM 12, 14 YEARS old when he was
[1:09:26] taken there. BUT HE HELD TRUE AND
[1:09:29] UNDERSTOOD BY JEREMIAH'S PROPHET THAT
[1:09:31] THE DAYS were almost accomplished. AND
[1:09:33] HALLELUJAH. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT the
[1:09:36] days ARE ALMOST ACCOMPLISHED. RUSSIA
[1:09:38] GETTING IN POSITION. HALLELUJAH. THE
[1:09:40] FACT GETTING IN POSITION. OH, GIVE THE
[1:09:42] LORD A SHOUT. CHINA GET INTO POSITION.
[1:09:45] And America IS A FALLEN EMPIRE FALLING
[1:09:48] IN SLOW MOTION. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME
[1:09:50] PRAISES. HALLELUJAH. BLESSED BE the name
[1:09:53] of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He
[1:09:56] made himself sack. I almost skipped
[1:09:57] that. How can we spend waste less time
[1:09:59] gambling swimming holes on Sundays? No
[1:10:01] time for the Lord. When the pastor speak
[1:10:03] something you don't like, you get up and
[1:10:04] go out.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He went to prayer to find
[1:10:08] out about it. Hallelujah. The perplexed
[1:10:11] handwriting on the wall and everything
[1:10:12] else. How can we sit slotfully? How can
[1:10:15] we just run over on top of it? Time we
[1:10:17] are checking up, watching for this great
[1:10:19] hour approaching.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus give it very simply,
[1:10:24] you know. He said they build they given
[1:10:25] in marriage they sold but the day
[1:10:29] [sighs]
[1:10:30] l come out
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; fire fell.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; So what he saying normal living
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; no signs of the time of the hour. You
[1:10:37] can't look outside to see the signs is
[1:10:39] prosperity is is all kind of fancy car
[1:10:42] house land everything making it work
[1:10:44] easy technology and what not. You have
[1:10:46] to look to the word
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; to see what is prophesy
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; because someday something going to
[1:10:51] happen. Someday something going to
[1:10:53] change.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; It could be today.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; It could be now.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; It could be here.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; It could be with you.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Everywhere I GO, I LOOK FOR IT.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That love will drop down and take all
[1:11:08] the EVIL OUT. EVERYWHERE I LOOK, BECAUSE
[1:11:11] IT HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE,
[1:11:17] [cheering]
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I'll skip that. You talk about thus says
[1:11:30] the Lord, land shall be desolate.
[1:11:31] Prophesy. I prophesy that this whole
[1:11:32] nation shall become desolate. How about
[1:11:35] America? God shall punish this nation
[1:11:37] for her sin. You may be seated.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Something I keep saying over and over,
[1:11:42] this message world has not seen God's
[1:11:44] judgment.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; They have not seen God's wrath.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Understand this. The same God that
[1:11:50] brought out 2 million people, killed
[1:11:51] them.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; See, get quiet.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; The same God.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; You are Jehovah. Hallelujah. They dance
[1:12:04] at the bank of the river.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; THE DANCE COMING OUT, THE SHOUTING.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; AND GOD wasn't seeing them, you know. He
[1:12:12] was seeing all who getting pregnant.
[1:12:15] He was seeing the babies that was coming
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; because he know that generation was
[1:12:18] going to fail.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; So he was looking to the next generation
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; to [laughter] take them into the
[1:12:23] promised LAND
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; because he's a God of his promise.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; He's a God of his word.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; TO BE GOD, HE HAS TO KEEP HIS WORD.
[1:12:34] [cheering]
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; You know what happened? THE MINISTERS
[1:12:39] FAILED THE PEOPLE.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; You don't never see that before.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; No. I'm seeing it here. NOW, THE
[1:12:45] MINISTERS FAILED THE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE
[1:12:47] TOLD THEM, "GO BACK
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; INTO THE land and bring evidence
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; to my people.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I'm a good God. I'm a great God. I'm a
[1:12:56] favor God. I'M A COVENANT KEEPING GOD."
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WENT INTO THE LAND.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; 12 MINISTERS WENT INTO THE LAND.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; There's a whole association by itself.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; 10 of THEM COME BACK QUICKLY. [laughter]
[1:13:12] And they brought the Bible call it a
[1:13:14] evil report.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; It brought an atmosphere in the
[1:13:19] congregation of negativity,
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; of darkness and gloom and lack of faith.
[1:13:28] [cheering]
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to go here, but I'm
[1:13:30] [laughter] inside of here already. I
[1:13:31] can't come out yet. I'm still inside OF
[1:13:32] HERE.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN it when uh uh Joshua and Caleb came
[1:13:38] back, they came back late.
[1:13:40] They had white coats and they the coat
[1:13:43] pink and it's grape juice. You know
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; them guys enjoying theself.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Them guys saw giants and they didn't
[1:13:49] bother. They on grapes. SEE
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; THE OTHER GUYS GOD SAW GIANTS AND COME
[1:13:55] BACK ABOUT GIANTS. NO SIGNS AND WONDERS.
[1:13:58] GIANTS NO HOLY GHOST. GIANTS NO NO NO NO
[1:14:00] NO DYNAMICS MECHANICS. GIANTS NO
[1:14:03] thunders
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; giants. THAT WHY WE CAN'T PREACH IT.
[1:14:07] GIANTS. [screaming]
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T SAY IT.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Question. Question. Did the giant see
[1:14:15] you? No.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; You mean the giants didn't see you and
[1:14:21] you run back?
[1:14:23] You see in our eyes, you see that when
[1:14:26] it thinks real bad. When you see
[1:14:27] yourself small, you're real small. IN
[1:14:29] OUR EYES, WE WERE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS.
[1:14:32] Don't let the devil TELL YOU THAT YOU
[1:14:35] ARE SOME GRASSHOPPERS. [screaming] WE
[1:14:36] ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. [cheering]
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; WE ARE WARRIORS.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; WHEN JOSHUA AND CALEB COME BACK, THEY
[1:14:54] COUNT NEGATIVE. Count negative.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; You know what Caleb did? You know what
[1:14:59] Bible say? He was the shortest man.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; He take a box to stand upon.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; I tell you,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; HE STAND UP ON THE BOX. CALL them shorty
[1:15:06] for now.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Shorty on the BOX
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; TELLING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WE ARE MORE
[1:15:11] THAN ABLE
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THEM CHANCE OUT.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Who you going to believe?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; SHORTY OR THOSE OTHER EIGHT MINISTERS IN
[1:15:22] THE MESSAGE TALKING THE NEGATIVITY
[1:15:25] TALKING ABOUT WE CAN'T MAKE IT TALKING
[1:15:27] ABOUT WE NOTING THE BRIDE. OH GIVE THE
[1:15:29] LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. [cheering]
[1:15:33] CALEB SAID WE ARE WELL ABLE. AND I SAY
[1:15:36] TODAY WHEN THE PROBLEM IS GONE, BUT WE
[1:15:40] ARE WELL ABLE. 60 YEARS PASS, BUT WE ARE
[1:15:44] WELL ABLE. WE COMING UP TO 2026, BUT WE
[1:15:48] ARE WELL ABLE.
[1:15:52] [cheering]
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Let be seated. [applause]
[1:15:57] [cheering]
[1:16:00] Daniel read the same books. we are
[1:16:02] reading this morning. Daniel read the
[1:16:04] same Bible, same punctuations, same
[1:16:07] sentences, the same thing that I'm
[1:16:09] reading.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; He set himself to order.
[1:16:13] And then he said, I understand, you may
[1:16:14] be seated, there'll be scuffers in the
[1:16:16] last days. I understand that there will
[1:16:17] be nations against nations. I understand
[1:16:19] there'll be tidal waves in the last
[1:16:21] days. There'll be fearful sights. I
[1:16:22] understand the women will bump their
[1:16:23] head. I understand they'll wear short
[1:16:25] high heel shoes. I understand the morow.
[1:16:27] Here we go. I understand that the
[1:16:29] preachers will be false shepherds in the
[1:16:33] last days that will compromise. I will
[1:16:36] not feed the people of God. If those
[1:16:38] eight ministers came back to the people
[1:16:40] and said, "Boy, our God is a good God.
[1:16:42] We the land is able." Everybody was in
[1:16:44] the land.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; But the people believed them wanted to
[1:16:50] Joshua and Caleb. God had enough. He
[1:16:52] said, "There's my red line.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; I bring you to Egypt, out of Egypt. You
[1:16:56] complain. I give you meat. I give you
[1:16:58] food. I give you water. I GIVE YOU MANA.
[1:17:00] I GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED. But
[1:17:01] when you come to this borderline here,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; when we about to hit dynamics, when we
[1:17:06] about to hit the miracles, when we are
[1:17:08] about to hit the supernatural, when the
[1:17:10] dynamics of this church will come in and
[1:17:13] hallelujah, he said, then you worshiping
[1:17:14] the living Christ, HIM MOVING IN AND
[1:17:16] OUT. WHEN WE ALMOST THERE AND YOU TALK
[1:17:19] NEGATIVE, DON'T TALK NEGATIVE INSIDE OF
[1:17:20] HERE. HOLD THE LINE.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; HOLD THE LINE.
[1:17:26] WE ARE UNDER ATTACK, BUT HOLD THE LINE.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Tell somebody, "Hold the line."
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:17:37] [cheering]
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "HOLD THE LINE."
[1:17:52] IT'S A IT'S A ARMY TERM. WHEN THE ENEMY
[1:17:55] IS GREAT, WHEN THE ENEMY IS ATTACKING,
[1:17:58] WHEN THE ENEMY THINK THAT WE GOING TO
[1:18:00] STOP BACK AND GO BACK, IT MEANS DON'T
[1:18:02] MOVE [screaming] BACK.
[1:18:04] HOLD THE LINE. DON'T GIVE THEM AN INCH.
[1:18:08] Don't give them no room. WE ARE GOING TO
[1:18:10] HOLD [screaming] THE LINE.
[1:18:16] [cheering]
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; So Daniel Hallelujah
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; took his stand.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; There are three realms that man live by.
[1:18:33] Be seated. The humanistic
[1:18:37] divine revelation and vision.
[1:18:39] [gasps]
[1:18:40] The realm of the mind and the realm of
[1:18:43] the heart are two different things.
[1:18:47] You may be seated.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Having done all to stand.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Have you done all to stand?
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; You have to stop going shady places.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; You have to fight the good fight of
[1:18:56] faith.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; You have to come into full obedience.
[1:18:59] You have to bring yourself into the
[1:19:00] order of the spirit.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; There's some people who just like to be
[1:19:04] contrary. Everybody saying yes, yes,
[1:19:06] yes. And they feel they have to say no.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; They don't want to be in harmony.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; They don't want to come in the order of
[1:19:12] the spirit. But there's something called
[1:19:14] the order of the spirit. You have to
[1:19:16] bring yourself in the orderly spirit.
[1:19:18] You have to be intentional to fulfill or
[1:19:22] accomplish the purpose of God.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; You have to purge yourself. Paul said it
[1:19:27] this way. I do not fight like the air.
[1:19:30] He said, "I run that I may obtain."
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; You have to put away the works of
[1:19:36] darkness.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; But Brandon says, "You may have the
[1:19:39] biggest church in the country. You may
[1:19:41] have more money than you got, but God,
[1:19:42] that can have one thing to do with it.
[1:19:44] God wants a clean heart and a clean
[1:19:47] hands. He want a clean up church that he
[1:19:50] can show himself. Like the little woman
[1:19:52] with a pure heart and a defiled body and
[1:19:55] the Pharisee with a pure body and a
[1:19:58] defiled heart. It condemned one and say
[1:20:02] this is sweet. This is sweet. He called
[1:20:03] the woman having a pure heart
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; but she had five and one. She wasn't her
[1:20:07] own husbands but she called her pure
[1:20:09] heart. A body defiled but her heart is
[1:20:12] pure. That's why Jesus could ask her the
[1:20:14] right question. Go call your husband. He
[1:20:17] didn't dictate or he didn't come to
[1:20:19] address what she was doing or how she
[1:20:20] was living. You know, he came to address
[1:20:22] who she was because her name was in the
[1:20:24] book and he was the book. So, he knew
[1:20:27] her. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Do
[1:20:30] you get that? DO YOU GET THAT? DO YOU
[1:20:32] GET THAT? HE DIDN'T COME TO TALK ABOUT
[1:20:34] HOW SHE WHAT SHE DOING AND WHAT NOT. HE
[1:20:36] CAME TO CALL HER OUT.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:42] Jeremiah 17:9, the heart is deceitful
[1:20:45] above all things and desperately wicked.
[1:20:49] Who can know it? I the Lord search the
[1:20:52] heart. I try the reigns even to give
[1:20:55] every man according to his ways and
[1:20:57] according to do the fruit of his doings.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Praise God. Moses
[1:21:02] tried to work it his own way,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; but there's a way for of God. It will
[1:21:07] never work. We must meet God's program
[1:21:10] word, letter by letter. There's where
[1:21:13] the Holy Spirit works. Make you do the
[1:21:15] things that you didn't think you would
[1:21:17] ever do. It make you repent and go back
[1:21:19] and shake hands, make up with the
[1:21:21] people. You could join church and still
[1:21:23] call yourself a Christian and hate down
[1:21:25] in your heart.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And we have experienced it.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. One of the greatest
[1:21:31] challenges for me in one things that
[1:21:33] give me a a problem in believing is when
[1:21:35] Baram talk about unbelievers in his
[1:21:37] message.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; I understand the believers understand
[1:21:39] the believers but the unbelievers.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Now I know
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; ministers who preach a message they
[1:21:44] don't believe the message
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; because they see what Baram's saying and
[1:21:46] they not they don't believe that
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I'll give an example. There is no such
[1:21:50] thing as a holy church.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can be preached in it but
[1:21:56] in it you find good,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; bad, and everything else.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Under everything else is everything
[1:22:03] else.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; That's outside of good and bad. Then
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; everything else
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; in the church. So when a man show that
[1:22:12] his church is superior than
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; above than higher than
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; other churches, he doesn't believe what
[1:22:19] the prophet said
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; because in every church have three kinds
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; because the prophet said that.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Do you get that now? So we don't want to
[1:22:27] DECEIVE YOU AND TELL YOU UP THERE
[1:22:28] SOMEWHERE. NO, you have to down there by
[1:22:30] the by the cross.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Not up there yet.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; You got to hit the cross first.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; But Abraham talk about you could join
[1:22:37] church and sell call of a Christian and
[1:22:38] hate down in your heart. But you can't
[1:22:40] be led by the Holy Spirit and do that.
[1:22:43] You can't cheat. You can't lie. You
[1:22:45] can't pull shady deeds. It's got to be
[1:22:48] out of board.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Okay, you may be seated. All right,
[1:22:51] let's go to the title now.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Rooted and grounded. This word rooted is
[1:22:56] a Greek word named rizo. I don't even
[1:22:58] the pronunction might be right but it
[1:23:01] means to take root to become firmly
[1:23:04] planted fixed like a plant to be rooted
[1:23:06] for nourishment and stability. That is
[1:23:10] what rooted means. The grounded is
[1:23:14] another word pronounced timo. It's a
[1:23:17] verb to lay a foundation to make stable
[1:23:21] to establish on something solid. So Paul
[1:23:25] used these imagery of root and ground.
[1:23:29] Root as to identify the source or the
[1:23:34] nourishment or how deep you can go. So
[1:23:37] when the trials come, it give you deeper
[1:23:39] roots that you get a source from the
[1:23:42] source of life to draw into you. Isn't
[1:23:44] that right? A root system that you
[1:23:47] cannot be uprooted.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It makes you stable.
[1:23:51] continuous drawing from the life of
[1:23:53] Christ. Hallelujah. A tree joining its
[1:23:56] nutrients. Foundation gives stability.
[1:24:00] Foundation is stable like a building. So
[1:24:03] the root alive like a tree. Foundation
[1:24:06] stable like a building. Firmness in
[1:24:08] doctrine. Stability in character. Not
[1:24:11] given by deception. Not easily moved by
[1:24:14] the slay of hands of man. Isn't that
[1:24:17] right? So being rooted is where you draw
[1:24:19] your LIFE FROM. BEING GROUNDED IS WHAT
[1:24:22] YOU stand on. So God want you rooted and
[1:24:25] grounded
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; in the love of God. So our direction is
[1:24:29] heading towards love because it will
[1:24:31] take love to enter deal. Do you get it
[1:24:34] now? NOT TO BE IN CHURCH BUT TO BE
[1:24:36] ANCHORED TO BE ROOTED LIKE PSALMS 1.
[1:24:39] BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT WALKETH NOT IN
[1:24:41] THE COUNSEL OF THE UNGODLY, NOR STAND IN
[1:24:43] THE WAY OF SINNERS, NOR SIT IN THE SEAT
[1:24:45] OF THE SCORNFUL, BUT HIS DELIGHT IS in
[1:24:48] the law of the Lord, AND IN HIS LAW,
[1:24:49] THAT HE MEDITATE DAY AND NIGHT. HE SHALL
[1:24:52] BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED.
[1:24:55] HALLELUJAH. NOT JUST REST THERE, BUT
[1:24:58] PLANTED. HALLELUJAH. WHERE? BY THE
[1:25:01] RIVERS of water, whatever he do going to
[1:25:03] prosper. Oh, praise the Lord. Some
[1:25:05] shouts in the house. Glory to God.
[1:25:08] Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's how God want us. Grounded,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; rooted, joined from the source.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your source is not
[1:25:17] Hollywood. Your source is not the world.
[1:25:19] Your source is not friends. Your source
[1:25:21] is not Tik Tok or social media. That's
[1:25:23] not your source. Your source is the
[1:25:25] word. That's where you want to draw
[1:25:27] from. Everything you have need of is in
[1:25:29] the word. And the devil of everything
[1:25:31] right now to give like shiny things in
[1:25:33] your front to face to shake you off the
[1:25:35] source. But God want you to get rooted.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. How let your
[1:25:39] roots go deeper. HEADING TOWARDS
[1:25:41] CHARITY, THE BOND OF PERFECTNESS, the
[1:25:44] love that passeth all knowledge. Praise
[1:25:47] God. Amen. So know how to stand. Abraham
[1:25:50] had to stand. Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:25:52] Abednego have to stand. And the time
[1:25:54] will come when you have to stand on
[1:25:55] God's word and to stand alone. There's
[1:25:57] got to be a time when you separate
[1:25:59] yourself between your feelings and your
[1:26:01] faith.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord A SHAMAN READING. THERE'S
[1:26:04] GOT TO come a time when you're separate
[1:26:07] from your feelings AND YOUR FAITH. YOUR
[1:26:09] FEELINGS WANT TO STAY HOME, BUT YOUR
[1:26:10] FAITH WANT TO GO TO CHURCH. YOUR FEELING
[1:26:12] DON'T WANT TO PRAISE GOD, BUT YOUR
[1:26:14] FAITH, I HAVE TO PRAISE HIM. OH, glory
[1:26:16] to God. BECAUSE ABRAHAM STOOD AND HE
[1:26:18] STAGGERED OUT OF THE PROMISE OF GOD
[1:26:20] through unbelief. What was strong and
[1:26:22] faith-giving. GLORY TO GOD. GOD DID NOT
[1:26:24] SPEAK TO SARAH. GOD SPOKE TO ABRAHAM.
[1:26:27] ABRAHAM HAD THE REVELATION. SARAH DID
[1:26:29] NOT. HE HAD TO BELIEVE FOR HIMSELF AND
[1:26:30] FOR HIS WIFE. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; YOU WALK WITH Christ as an individual
[1:26:40] walk or you stand alone.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Not you and the pastor. You and God
[1:26:44] alone. Not you and the deacon. Sometimes
[1:26:47] you and your wife or you and your
[1:26:49] husband, you and God alone. You stand
[1:26:52] alone on your convictions. Salvation is
[1:26:54] not a church affair. It's an individual
[1:26:56] affair. Church is a gathering place. You
[1:26:59] become in one common bong and worship
[1:27:00] God. But salvation is personal,
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; isn't that right? Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. You be
[1:27:09] seated.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. God brings
[1:27:14] tension into the church.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; See? Amen. Go.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Still reading. You believe this prophet.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Brother see this prophet. God brings
[1:27:27] tension into the church. For every son
[1:27:29] that cometh to God must be tried,
[1:27:31] proven, tested.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; He let sickness strike you.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say amen. Just tell
[1:27:40] the word.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching to your feelings. I'm
[1:27:42] preaching to your faith. [cheering]
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Nobody want sickness.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I don't want sickness, but sickness
[1:27:51] could come.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Last night, I heard some big big
[1:27:53] thunders.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; I had thunders. I don't even breathe him
[1:27:57] or what. I didn't look outside.
[1:28:00] I didn't ask for thunders.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; But the thunders had a crack.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you may be seated. He said the
[1:28:07] bright skies approve another not a sign
[1:28:09] of God's approval.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; The dark skies are not a sign of God
[1:28:12] disapproval.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; God's approval is in the beloved. You in
[1:28:15] the beloved.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; He can send you through the waters,
[1:28:18] through the flood, through the fire,
[1:28:19] through trials, through testings.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; It's his prerogative to do that. He
[1:28:22] said, "How shall we know we love God? By
[1:28:24] conducting ourselves with joy. am
[1:28:27] trials, he in his wisdom sends our way.
[1:28:32] [cheering]
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. How do we prove and
[1:28:39] show our love to God? By conducting
[1:28:42] ourselves. This a quote, you know.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; I know it by heart.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; If you press me, I will play. Let me
[1:28:50] [laughter]
[1:28:51] how do HOW HOW
[1:28:55] DO we know the love of God? How do we
[1:28:57] show God his love? By conducting
[1:28:58] yourself with joy amidst the trials he
[1:29:01] in his wisdom sends our way.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He let diseases come on you to test you
[1:29:07] and to prove you to show the world that
[1:29:10] you are truly the seed of Abraham. He
[1:29:12] permits it by his own will. He permits
[1:29:14] disasters. HE PERMITS THE FRIENDS TO
[1:29:17] TURN against you. HE PERMIT ALL THESE
[1:29:19] THINGS AND TURN the devil loose to tempt
[1:29:21] you. HE WILL DO IT BUT TAKE YOUR LIFE.
[1:29:24] Oh give the Lord a praise and offering
[1:29:27] having done all to stand. WE STAND.
[1:29:30] SICKNESS OR NO SICKNESS. BOYFRIEND OR NO
[1:29:33] BOYFRIEND. GIRLFRIEND OR NO GIRLFRIEND.
[1:29:36] WIFE OR NO WIFE. HALLELUJAH. IT DOESN'T
[1:29:38] MATTER WHAT. [cheering]
[1:29:43] Having an order to stand. Stand. Oh,
[1:29:47] praise the name of the Lord.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; He could throw you in a bed of
[1:29:49] affliction. He could turn your neighbors
[1:29:51] against you. He could turn the church
[1:29:53] against you. He can do anything.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; I I trust I'm preaching to the right
[1:30:03] group this morning.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not frightening you this
[1:30:06] morning. RIGHT.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I know Pastor lay down, you know.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go. All right. Now,
[1:30:14] what about Abraham and Isaac on the
[1:30:15] mountain? One promise was given
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; by his loyalty and his knowing, his
[1:30:19] faith in Jehovah. Watch. He said there
[1:30:21] was no greater he could swear. He saw by
[1:30:23] himself. Then he let Abraham be tested
[1:30:25] to the final point.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Now you see a minute.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Now you could say I'm waiting for the
[1:30:34] ram in the ticket. God offer your son
[1:30:36] only son.
[1:30:39] But the ram is up there
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; where the altar is at. You can't see the
[1:30:45] ram by the man say I waited but if the
[1:30:46] people of God hallelujah glory but God
[1:30:49] tell him I will offer up Isaac on the
[1:30:51] mountain I will show you not not he tell
[1:30:53] him no because he tell him he might take
[1:30:55] a Uber and pass straight
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; so he didn't want to tell him he said I
[1:31:00] will tell you so he's riding go say here
[1:31:04] then Abraham said I in the lab we're
[1:31:06] going up and we coming back down
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; he know God can't kill that child
[1:31:10] [cheering]
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; if God brought him out and not bring him
[1:31:13] back That's the faith Abraham had.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham was so confident he laid Isaac
[1:31:18] on the Isaac was a smart guy. Wasn't
[1:31:20] foolish. He said, "Daddy,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; I see the wood."
[1:31:27] But when he sacrifice
[1:31:33] was no foolish guy, you know,
[1:31:36] father tie him up. A good thing wasn't a
[1:31:38] rebellious son. You want to fight?
[1:31:42] No. time up there. Come along with the
[1:31:45] knife. Go say I am hold your hand. Look
[1:31:48] at there. Look there. I am Jehovah Gyra.
[1:31:53] I could provide for you. Make that step
[1:31:56] forward. Take your stand. OBEY GOD. DO
[1:32:00] WHAT GOD TELL YOU. DO WHAT GOD SAY TO
[1:32:03] YOU. GOD IS SPEAKING TO YOU THIS
[1:32:04] MORNING. WHATEVER GOD SAY, YOU GOT TO
[1:32:07] DO. OKAY. THE LORD I SHOUT IN THE HOUSE.
[1:32:10] [cheering]
[1:32:11] HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; He tested Abraham to the final point.
[1:32:16] HE'S GOT TO TEST you and me to that
[1:32:18] final moment, that time of decision when
[1:32:20] everything is away from you, you have to
[1:32:22] stand alone there.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And so me and my house will serve the
[1:32:26] Lord.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Though there be
[1:32:29] tactless coming to the church, though
[1:32:31] there be twisters, though there be all
[1:32:32] kind of false prophets, everything else
[1:32:33] in the church, among the people, in the
[1:32:35] neighborhood, everything. But for me and
[1:32:36] my house, we're going to serve the Lord.
[1:32:38] Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; My Lord, a real Christian fight for his
[1:32:40] position. You may be seated.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Are we Christian?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Shout out fight.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Are we Christian? Fight for his
[1:32:47] position.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; You have a position in Christ. And in
[1:32:49] that position, the devil can't move you.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; The devil can't cancel you.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; David was anointed to be king over
[1:32:55] Israel.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; HE RAN FROM SAUL. HE PLAYED CRAZY. DAVID
[1:33:00] WENT THROUGH ALL KIND OF TRIALS, BUT HE
[1:33:02] KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE KING.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Do you know you ordained to be in the
[1:33:05] rapture? Do you know you don't ordain to
[1:33:08] receive power? Oh, glory to God. A real
[1:33:11] Christian fights for his position. He
[1:33:13] has to stand alone. Him and God, he
[1:33:15] fights every inch. You don't have to
[1:33:17] baby them around. Hallelujah. So, after
[1:33:20] you prayed, you may be seated. After you
[1:33:23] obeyed,
[1:33:24] after you resisted,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; after you trusted,
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; after you fought and used every
[1:33:30] spiritual weapon, stand your ground.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Hold the line.
[1:33:35] Hold your position.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Hold your testimony.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Standing. Standing means you're not
[1:33:41] running.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Standing means you're not retreating.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Standing means you're NOT SURRENDERING.
[1:33:46] STANDING MEANS it is NOT A PASSIVE
[1:33:48] POSITION.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; STANDING DOESN'T MEAN PASSIVE. YOU KNOW,
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; STANDING IS FIRM.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE GROUNDED.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; WELL, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. [cheering]
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; THE LIGHTHOUSE. [screaming] DON'T ARGUE
[1:34:02] WITH THE STORM.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; THE LIGHTHOUSE. DON'T ARGUE WITH THE
[1:34:05] SHIP, THE LIGHTHOUSE. DON'T ARGUE WITH
[1:34:07] THE DARKNESS. THE LIGHT WILL JUST STAND
[1:34:09] THERE AND GIVING LIGHT TO THE SAILORS,
[1:34:13] TO THE SHIP. THAT IS LEGOS. GIVE THE
[1:34:16] LORD A SHOUT. LEGOS HAVE TO STAND LIKE A
[1:34:18] LIGHTHOUSE. UNMOVABLE, UNSHAKABLE,
[1:34:22] UNSTOPPABLE.
[1:34:23] HOLD the line. Hold the line. Hold the
[1:34:26] line. Hallelujah.
[1:34:31] You
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; may be seated.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; So when the thing is true and the time
[1:34:39] of one is long, it requires endurance.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; It requires fortitude. It requires
[1:34:45] resilience. It requires resistance.
[1:34:48] Resistance against slotfulness,
[1:34:50] resistance against apathy, resistance
[1:34:52] against hopelessness, resistance against
[1:34:54] the world and the things of the world.
[1:34:56] It means trusting God when the battle is
[1:34:59] long. You may be seated. Oh, give the
[1:35:00] Lord some shout.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Faith that cannot be tested cannot be
[1:35:07] trusted.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; That's why WHEN GOD GIVE YOU FAITH, YOU
[1:35:09] HAVE to
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; tested faith. It's trusted faith.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; When God could test your faith, he could
[1:35:17] trust you.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Trust in God when the battle is long.
[1:35:22] Ephesians 6. Watch. Finally, my
[1:35:25] brethren, be strong in the Lord. in the
[1:35:28] Lord, not your strength and in the power
[1:35:30] of his might, not your might. You're
[1:35:33] being strong in the Lord and the power
[1:35:35] of his might. The enemy's job is to try
[1:35:38] to break you, break your faith, break
[1:35:41] you down, break you to a point where you
[1:35:43] want to give up. God's purpose AND GOD'S
[1:35:46] DESIRE IS THAT YOU REMAIN STANDING LIKE
[1:35:49] the tree planted by the rivers of water.
[1:35:52] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Psalms 125:1, THEY THAT
[1:35:59] TRUST IN THE LORD SHALL BE AS MOUNT
[1:36:01] ZION, WHICH CANNOT BE REMOVED, BUT
[1:36:04] ABIDETH FOREVER. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME
[1:36:06] PRAISES. GLORY TO GOD. [screaming]
[1:36:10] STANDING IS A POWERFUL TESTIMONY. THE
[1:36:13] FACT YOU DIDN'T QUIT, THE FACT YOU
[1:36:15] DIDN'T RUN, THE FACT YOU DIDN'T HIDE.
[1:36:17] WHEN YOU FELL, YOU CUT BACK UP. YOU
[1:36:19] STOOD AS A YOUNG MAN, YOU STOOD IN A
[1:36:22] MIDDLE AGE, YOU'RE STILL STANDING AS YOU
[1:36:24] GET OLDER. [screaming] YOU HAVE STOOD
[1:36:26] THE TEST OF TIME. OH, GIVE THE LORD A
[1:36:29] SHOUT. WHERE ARE THE CALEBS IN THE
[1:36:32] HOUSE?
[1:36:34] [cheering]
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; You become like a time testing moral
[1:36:39] shining light to others.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; My God, I like that the lighthouse
[1:36:44] doesn't argue with the storm.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Why you so stormy?
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Why so dark? No, it just stands and
[1:36:51] shine.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Notice God didn't argue with the
[1:36:53] darkness. as darkness cover the earth.
[1:36:55] God's darkness cover [laughter] the
[1:36:56] people. God say, "How how long you so
[1:36:58] dark?"
[1:37:00] No, God didn't talk darkness. No, he
[1:37:02] just said, "Let there be light."
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; GOD DID NOT JUST SEE DARKNESS. God spoke
[1:37:07] for light.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; DON'T BOTHER ABOUT THE DARKNESS. LET
[1:37:12] THERE BE LIGHT.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Matthew 7:24 to25. You may
[1:37:20] be seated. Jesus speaks. Therefore,
[1:37:22] whosoever he hearth these sayings of
[1:37:24] mine and doeth them, I would liken him
[1:37:26] unto a wise man which built his house
[1:37:28] upon a rock, and the rain descended, and
[1:37:31] the floods came, and the winds blew, and
[1:37:34] beat upon that house, and it fell not,
[1:37:37] because it was founded upon a rock. And
[1:37:39] then he made the contrast, and everyone
[1:37:40] that he hearth not these things of
[1:37:42] mines, and doeth them not, not just
[1:37:44] hearing, but doeth them not. Watch shall
[1:37:46] lighten unto a man a foolish man, build
[1:37:48] his house upon sand. And the rain
[1:37:50] descended and floods came blew and great
[1:37:53] was the fall of it. When Jesus ended the
[1:37:56] scene, people were astonished. They said
[1:37:58] he took them not as as one having
[1:38:00] authority. Never a man speak like THAT
[1:38:02] MAN.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; THE MAN WHO HOUSE is on the sand.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Six bedrooms.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Nice roof.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; The storm may come yet.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; You have guests. Nice garage, fancy car.
[1:38:16] The storm may come yet.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; The storm is coming.
[1:38:21] So that is why you have to be founded
[1:38:23] upon a rock.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAY UPON THIS ROCK
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; I WILL BUILD
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; HIS CHURCH UPON SAND. YOU BELIEVE TODAY
[1:38:34] YOU BELIEVE [screaming] TOMORROW YOU'RE
[1:38:35] SEEN IT NOW YOU'RE NOT SEEING IT AGAIN.
[1:38:37] YOU'RE ONCE IN A MESSAGE. YOU WALK OUT A
[1:38:39] MESSAGE. YOU HAVE NO [screaming]
[1:38:40] REVELATION.
[1:38:44] [cheering]
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Founded upon a rock
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; and the rock is when this you hear from
[1:38:49] heaven.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; We could preach but then heaven have to
[1:38:52] reveal it.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; And when heaven reveal it to you, it's
[1:38:55] on your rock
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; inside your heart.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; I like Abraham. Abraham had Isaac in the
[1:39:00] heart. He can't show Shar Abraham.
[1:39:03] Serious say where's Abra? Where's Isaac?
[1:39:06] She's revealed to me and go have a son.
[1:39:09] Check the doctor. Dr. T see him. Don't
[1:39:11] see him. You know it's a gimmick. After
[1:39:13] a few years, doctor said don't come
[1:39:14] back. Don't come back here. Old man go
[1:39:17] come back here.
[1:39:19] Go and drink some kind of coffee or
[1:39:20] something. Don't come back here. Doctor
[1:39:23] doctor give up on him.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said HE STACKED NOT.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; WHERE'S THE evidence of HIM STACKING
[1:39:28] NOT? BUT WAS STRONG in faith giving
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; praises to God. EVERY
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; EVERY SERVICE HALLELUJAH every praise
[1:39:43] HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH BELONGS
[1:39:46] TO GOD EVERY SERVICE THAT ARE COMING
[1:39:49] WITH YOUR PRAISES REGARD WHAT HAPPENING
[1:39:52] IN THE CHURCH YOU'RE COMING TO HOLD THE
[1:39:54] LINE BY YOUR PRAISES BY YOUR SHOUTS BY
[1:39:57] GIVING GOD'S GLORY BY THE PRAYER
[1:40:00] MEETINGS BY YOU BEING FERVENT IN GOD
[1:40:02] FERVENT IN PRAYER FERVENT IN PRAISE
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; The contrast must be made between the
[1:40:15] rock and the sand. Every man work will
[1:40:18] be tried. I'm reading this. This is I
[1:40:19] have here. There's a reason I title this
[1:40:21] message rooted and grounded. The bride
[1:40:24] will be rooted and grounded in love. But
[1:40:26] there will be others will be rooting and
[1:40:28] grounding in foolishness, in cult
[1:40:30] leaders, in false teachings, in false
[1:40:33] revelation, in false interpretations.
[1:40:36] Some on the way to the tribulation and
[1:40:37] some on the way to hell. You can't
[1:40:39] change that. We didn't make that.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; You can't move that. God help them.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. 2 Samuel 23. Are we going good?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; 2 Samuel 23:8. These be the names of the
[1:40:54] mighty men whom David had. The
[1:40:57] Tashmonite that sat in the seat of chief
[1:40:59] among the captains. The same was Addio
[1:41:01] the Esnite. He lifted up his spear
[1:41:03] against 800
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; whom he slew at one time.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; One man, 800.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo,
[1:41:11] the Ahite, one of the three mighty men
[1:41:14] with David. And they defied the
[1:41:16] Philistines that were gathered together
[1:41:18] to battle. And the men of Israel was
[1:41:20] going away. He arose and spoke the
[1:41:21] Philistine until his hand was weary. His
[1:41:24] hand clave unto the sword AND THE LORD
[1:41:27] WROUGHT A GREAT victory that day. And
[1:41:29] the people returned after him only till
[1:41:31] the spoil. After him was Shama, the son
[1:41:34] of Agi the Harite and the Philistine
[1:41:36] were gathered together in a troop. THERE
[1:41:38] WERE A PIECE OF GROUND FULL OF LENTILS
[1:41:40] AND THE PEOPLE FLED FROM THE
[1:41:41] PHILISTINES. BUT HE STOOD
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; IN THE MIDST OF THE GROUND AND DEFENDED
[1:41:46] IT. THIS MAN SHAMA, OH GLORY TO GOD. HE
[1:41:50] THE PEOPLE FLED FROM HIM AND HE STOOD IN
[1:41:54] HIS LENTIL FIELD AND SAID, "NOT TODAY.
[1:41:57] NOT TODAY." AND I AM [screaming] TELLING
[1:42:00] YOU, HOLD THE LINE.
[1:42:02] WE NOT GOING TO GIVE ONE INCH TO THE
[1:42:05] PHILISTINES. [screaming] HOLD THE LINE.
[1:42:08] [cheering]
[1:42:14] He stood in the midst of the ground and
[1:42:16] defended it and slew the Philistines and
[1:42:19] the Lord wrought a great victory. SHAMA
[1:42:23] STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD AND
[1:42:25] REFUSED to run. Refuse to give up. IF
[1:42:28] YOU RUN, YOU CAN'T FIGHT. IF YOU RUN,
[1:42:30] YOU CAN'T GET THE VICTORY. YOU CAN'T
[1:42:32] RUN. YOU HAVE TO STAND. [cheering]
[1:42:41] God give us seven seas and seven
[1:42:43] thunders.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; God give us this Holy Ghost line of
[1:42:45] promise.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; We're not going to run from it.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; We're not going to let anybody chase us
[1:42:49] from it.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Psalms 91 verse one. He that dwelleth in
[1:42:54] a secret place, note the location.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Not he that dwells in Lagos or Trinidad.
[1:43:03] No. No. Know the location of this place.
[1:43:05] If you send this in Google, you had to
[1:43:06] find this location. Secret place. I
[1:43:08] don't think Google picked this up. He
[1:43:09] that dwell in the secret place of the
[1:43:11] most HIGH SHALL ABIDE UNDER THE SHADOW
[1:43:13] OF THE MIGHTY. HEY. [cheering]
[1:43:19] HALLELUJAH. I WILL SAY OF THE LORD, HE
[1:43:22] IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS, MY GOD. IN
[1:43:27] HIM WILL I TRUST. SURELY HE SHALL
[1:43:29] DELIVER THEE FROM THE STATE OF THE FOWL,
[1:43:32] FROM THE NOISE AND PESTILENCE. HE SHALL
[1:43:34] COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS. UNDER HIS
[1:43:36] WINGS SHALL DOUBT.
[1:43:42] [cheering]
[1:43:51] [cheering]
[1:43:56] But hear the bomb in verse 9.
[1:43:59] Because
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; thou has made the Lord which is my
[1:44:05] refuge even the most high thy
[1:44:10] habitation. YOU HAVE TO MAKE GOD YOUR
[1:44:14] HABITATION. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE HIS
[1:44:18] HABITATION. WHERE YOU'RE DWELLING
[1:44:19] [screaming]
[1:44:20] UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE MM MIGHTY.
[1:44:23] YOU'RE WALKING ANOINTED. YOU ARE
[1:44:25] APPOINTED. YOU ARE INSPIRED. YOU ARE
[1:44:28] ELECTED. YOU ARE PREDESTINATED. YOU HAVE
[1:44:32] CHOSEN THE LORD.
[1:44:34] [cheering]
[1:44:40] [cheering]
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; The phrase hold the line. It's a
[1:44:50] military phrase. It means not to yield
[1:44:53] ground.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Any ground. It means maintain your
[1:44:58] defensive positions and not retreat from
[1:45:01] an enemy.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a TESTAMENT TO THE
[1:45:06] ENDURING human need for resilience in
[1:45:09] the face of overwhelming odds.
[1:45:11] 200,000,000
[1:45:13] DEVILS LOOSE AGAINST THE BRIDE, LOOSE
[1:45:16] AGAINST YOUR FAMILY, LOOSE AGAINST YOUR
[1:45:18] MARRIAGE, AGAINST YOUR CHILDREN, AGAINST
[1:45:19] YOUR JOB, AGAINST YOUR MONEY, AGAINST
[1:45:21] YOUR BUSINESS. LOOSE AGAINST YOUR WHOLE
[1:45:24] LINE.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:45:31] [cheering]
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Why you say that, Mo?
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Because Joel said, "Blow a trumpet in
[1:45:36] Zion, sung an alarm in my holy
[1:45:39] mountain." He said, "I'm talking about a
[1:45:41] people now." Talk about you, a fire
[1:45:43] devoured upon them, before them, before
[1:45:45] them, behind them, a flame of fire. The
[1:45:47] appearance of them is like the
[1:45:48] appearance of horses, like the noise of
[1:45:50] chariots on the tops of mountains. Shall
[1:45:51] they leap before their faces? The people
[1:45:53] shall be much pain. They shall run like
[1:45:56] mighty men,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; not weak men.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I call you young men because you're
[1:45:59] weak.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; I know Bible for that. You know,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; I call you young men because you're
[1:46:03] strong.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; You have young, you have youth, you have
[1:46:05] energy. God can give you a vision to
[1:46:07] fulfill the vision BECAUSE YOU HAVE
[1:46:08] ENERGY FOR THAT. THE OLD MEN GO CONTINUE
[1:46:11] DREAMING DREAMS. BUT YOU, OH, THE LORD
[1:46:13] SHALL FULFILL THE vision [cheering] that
[1:46:16] the old man dreaming. THE LORD SHALL
[1:46:18] UTTER HIS VOICE BEFORE HIS ARMY. This
[1:46:21] camp is very great for he is strong
[1:46:23] [laughter] that executed his word.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham said, "You may be
[1:46:28] seated. This angel come didn't come from
[1:46:31] the earth. He come from heaven." He
[1:46:32] said, "The mysteries is all finished.
[1:46:34] Time shall be no more. Seven thunders
[1:46:37] throw their voices out. Will we run and
[1:46:39] leap over walls?" That's what Joel said.
[1:46:41] You know, we're going to leap and run
[1:46:42] over walls, right? Is there something
[1:46:44] fixing to happen that these old my
[1:46:47] violent bodies going to be changed?
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Time shall be no more. Then seriously
[1:46:52] think if it is then the pyramid is
[1:46:55] capped by the seven thunders. So the
[1:46:57] same thunders they rejected becomes the
[1:46:59] capstone
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; become the head stone become the cap
[1:47:02] that rejected and therefore that they
[1:47:04] were going to come up the bride which is
[1:47:06] charity the bund of perfectness. When I
[1:47:08] come upon you the church world will
[1:47:10] reject you before the government squeeze
[1:47:12] us. You see how king tariff, president
[1:47:16] tariff want to come there and invade
[1:47:17] Nigeria and do work in Nigeria before
[1:47:20] the press comes the bride have to
[1:47:22] comfort be on display.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; What happened in Jesus time? Jesus you
[1:47:28] may be seated. You may be seated on
[1:47:29] this.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; In Jesus time he he was a child of that
[1:47:33] day. It had the old fire scar sees
[1:47:35] traditional people seeing this is how it
[1:47:37] was and the message 80 years and and so
[1:47:40] like that is the old folks and so like
[1:47:42] that but Jesus he came present tense
[1:47:45] bringing prophecy bringing miracles and
[1:47:47] signs and wonders and so on. What did
[1:47:49] they do? They rejected him. Who should
[1:47:52] we choose? Barabus or Jesus GIVE US
[1:47:55] BARABUS.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH JESUS CALLED THE
[1:47:57] CHRIST?
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; CRUCIFY HIM.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; So do you think the bride will just get
[1:48:01] away like that?
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; No. same church folk.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; It will come against the bride
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; because you're going to be the capstone
[1:48:08] rejected.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; You're going to be Joseph rejected.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You will be the word manifested
[1:48:14] rejected.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; But Brandon, is this the mystery of the
[1:48:19] thunders that will bring back the
[1:48:20] headstone?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there is things in the
[1:48:23] thunders to do something because to
[1:48:25] leave here, we have to be kept.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; To leave here, we have to have power.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Man don't have power. Power belongs to
[1:48:31] God.
[1:48:32] Hallelujah. I want to repeat that. Man
[1:48:34] don't have power.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Power belongs TO GOD.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. A minister can't bring a
[1:48:40] revival. The people have to bring it.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; You have to see something.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; And then you could run and produce it.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Joel tree. Okay, we going good.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; That's what page I'm on. I have 20 pages
[1:48:52] on page 15. So don't worry. Going good.
[1:48:58] Joel 3:10. Beat your plowshares into
[1:49:01] swords
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; and your pruning hooks into spears. Let
[1:49:05] the weak say
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; I am strong.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; HE IS TELLING THEM TAKE YOUR GARDENING
[1:49:14] TOOLS, YOUR GARDENING, your plers, your
[1:49:16] this. He said beat it into swords.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Beat it INTO SPEARS.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; WHAT FOR? TO FIGHT.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Prepare for war.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; WAR IS COMING.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ATTACKS IS COMING,
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF ROOTED
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; AND GROUNDED
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; IN THE LOVE OF GOD.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. He said, "Wait
[1:49:40] till them seven thunders to the voice,
[1:49:42] that group who can take the word and
[1:49:44] hand it to you, it will slice and cut.
[1:49:46] He will be slayed by the word of God."
[1:49:48] Hallelujah. Praise God. Whatever they
[1:49:50] say going to happen because it's the
[1:49:52] word of God coming from the mouth of
[1:49:54] God. It is his word but he always uses
[1:49:57] man to work it.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. You may be seated.
[1:50:00] Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; So the type is rooted where you draw
[1:50:06] your source. Where you draw your
[1:50:08] inspiration where you draw your strength
[1:50:10] from. Roots is what going it looking for
[1:50:12] water. It looking for substance to draw.
[1:50:15] Because the more you draw is the more
[1:50:16] you grow. The more you draw is the more
[1:50:18] the leaves come out. The old leaves and
[1:50:20] your life will fall off. New leaves will
[1:50:23] come in because you're drawing from the
[1:50:24] source. And then you switch gears to be
[1:50:27] steady, to be stable, like a mountain,
[1:50:29] like a rock. H LIKE A PILLAR. OH, GLORY
[1:50:32] TO GOD. You cannot be moved. Praise God.
[1:50:34] But the brand himself said, "He that
[1:50:35] overcome it will make a pillar in the
[1:50:37] temple of God. A pillar, a foundation."
[1:50:39] Praise God. Hallelujah. These are those
[1:50:42] that took the word which they heard and
[1:50:44] went back to the foundation. And then he
[1:50:46] read Ephesians 2:19. Paul talk about we
[1:50:49] are built upon the foundations of the
[1:50:50] apostles and prophets. He let's go back
[1:50:53] to the foundation. Therefore, you're no
[1:50:55] more strangers or foreigners but fellow
[1:50:57] citizens with the saints and the
[1:50:59] household of God that are built upon the
[1:51:02] foundation. Watch are built upon the
[1:51:04] foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[1:51:06] Jesus Christ himself being the chief
[1:51:08] cornerstone. What will I give him? I'll
[1:51:11] put him the doctrine of the apostles and
[1:51:13] prophets at the beginning. Isn't that
[1:51:15] right? And this is where he said, "I'll
[1:51:16] give you the new name." Praise God. I'll
[1:51:18] make you a pillar and I'll write upon
[1:51:20] you my new name. Go give the Lord some
[1:51:22] praises.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:51:26] So, you going to make you a temple. A
[1:51:28] pillar in the temple OF GOD. WHAT IS
[1:51:30] THAT? IF HE'S A PILLAR, he is not going
[1:51:32] out anymore. He is the bride. Oh, give
[1:51:35] the LORD A SHOUT. GOD SAID YOU ARE THE
[1:51:38] BRIDE THAT HE GOING TO MAKE A PILLAR. A
[1:51:40] PILLAR IS what the building is on.
[1:51:42] PRAISE GOD. TO STAND AS PART OF THE
[1:51:44] FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING. THEY CAN'T
[1:51:46] DO WITHOUT YOU. THEY CAN'T MOVE WITHOUT
[1:51:49] YOU. YOU ARE PART OF THIS THING. THE
[1:51:51] DEVIL CAN'T MOVE YOU. OKAY, THE LORD HAS
[1:51:53] SHOUT. [screaming] YOU'RE ROOTED. YOU'RE
[1:51:55] GROUNDED. YOU'RE STANDING.
[1:51:59] [cheering]
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I come quickly. Hold fast which
[1:52:07] thou hast that no man take thy crown. He
[1:52:10] that overcometh will I make a pillar in
[1:52:11] the temple of my God. He shall go out no
[1:52:14] more. I'll write upon him the name of my
[1:52:16] God, the name of the city of my God,
[1:52:18] which is new Jerusalem, which cometh
[1:52:20] down from heaven. And my God, I'll write
[1:52:22] upon him my new name. Praise God. It's
[1:52:25] to hold fast, to persevere. Don't give
[1:52:28] up reading. Put on the whole armor of
[1:52:30] God. Use every weapon he HAS GIVEN US.
[1:52:33] USE EVERY GIFT at our disposal. LOOK
[1:52:36] AHEAD WITH JOY BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO
[1:52:39] CROWN BY him who is king of kings and
[1:52:42] lord of lords. He is not only given
[1:52:43] crowns but he says that there IN THE
[1:52:45] BRIDE WILL BE MADE PILLARS IN the temple
[1:52:48] of god. SO THIS ANCHOR THIS ROCK THIS
[1:52:50] BUILDING THIS STANDING IS NOT JUST FAIRY
[1:52:53] TALE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE A PILLAR. GOD
[1:52:56] BY THE holy ghost within us he's going
[1:52:58] to make and overcome our pillar in the
[1:53:00] temple. What is the pillar? A pillar is
[1:53:02] actually part of the foundation. It hold
[1:53:04] up the super structure. Oh my.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And brother talk about Revelation 7:14.
[1:53:13] Almost done. I heard the number of them
[1:53:15] which were sealed and 144,000 of tribe
[1:53:18] of Zabelon and so on. After this I
[1:53:19] beheld and a great multitude which no
[1:53:21] man could number all the nations and
[1:53:23] kindreds and people and tongues stood
[1:53:24] before him before the lamb clothed with
[1:53:26] white robes and palms in the hand saying
[1:53:28] salvation to our God which sited upon
[1:53:30] the throne. All the angels stood. That's
[1:53:32] the bride.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; He said and they said so uh who are
[1:53:35] these? and so on. Praise God. They will
[1:53:37] hunger no more. They will thirst no
[1:53:38] more. For the lamb shall wipe away their
[1:53:40] tears. Jesus come. He sealed 144,000.
[1:53:44] But there is another group that doesn't
[1:53:46] belong to 144,000 that we seen in verse
[1:53:48] 9 to 18. Who are they? They are the
[1:53:50] bride taken from among the Gentiles.
[1:53:53] They are before his throne day and
[1:53:55] night. They serve him in his temple.
[1:53:57] They are special care of the Lord. They
[1:53:59] are his bride. The bride goes wherever
[1:54:01] the bridegroom is. She will never be
[1:54:03] left by him. She will never leave his
[1:54:05] side. She will share the throne with
[1:54:06] him. She will be crowned with glory and
[1:54:08] honor. I will write upon him the NAME OF
[1:54:10] MY GOD, THE NAME OF THE CITY OF MY GOD.
[1:54:12] WHAT'S THE NAME OF GOD? OH, EMMANUEL, I
[1:54:15] CALL MY FATHER'S NAME. THEREFORE, THE
[1:54:17] NAME OF GOD IS JESUS. OH, GIVE THE LORD
[1:54:19] A SHOUT. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHAT
[1:54:21] NAME DOES A WOMAN TAKE WHEN SHE MARRIES
[1:54:23] THE MAN? SHE TAKES HIS NAME. [cheering]
[1:54:37] All right,
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; I think the mission is going to come.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, our God, we come to
[1:54:44] the spring praying in the name of thy
[1:54:46] beloved son who has bid us to come. I
[1:54:49] ask ask the father anything in my name,
[1:54:50] I'll do it. So we come in Jesus name to
[1:54:53] first repent of our own sin and our

[1:55:09] cleanse our hands, pile our hearts, wash
[1:55:12] us in the waters of separation from the
[1:55:14] things of the world by the word. And may

[1:55:18] clean through the word. And we pray that
[1:55:20] the word will search deep into our
[1:55:22] hearts tonight and will cleanse us from
[1:55:25] all unbelief that may our heart be
[1:55:27] renewed by the Holy Spirit. And oh God,

[1:55:32] in as we look ahead for the world
[1:55:34] crisis, we only see darkness ahead. and
[1:55:36] you who promised our redemption time and
[1:55:38] John and the Isaac must pray, even so
[1:55:40] come Lord Jesus. And we pray that you
[1:55:43] will grant these things to us tonight
[1:55:45] and heal all that are sick and afflicted
[1:55:48] and comfort the saints, call sinners to
[1:55:51] repentance, RENEW US ALL THAT WE WOULD
[1:55:53] GO from here, tightening up on the armor
[1:55:56] of God to go for our shoulders, prepare
[1:55:59] for the battle that lays before us in
[1:56:01] Jesus name. Let's stand and worship God

[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; As a church,
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; as a people, if the devil get a chance,
[1:56:38] he will destroy this church.

[2:07:13] stay.
[2:07:19] But all too soon it [music] went away.
[2:07:27] And in its place [music] the storm
[2:07:30] clouds came
[2:07:35] [music]
[2:07:36] and with the clouds there came the

[2:08:08] [music]
[2:08:09] Without your help, I'd surely fall.

[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you know I need a brand new

[2:09:48] My heart may cry instead of sing.
[2:09:54] [music]
[2:09:56] But it matters [singing] not what comes
[2:09:59] my way.
[2:10:01] Lord,

[2:10:07] day.
[2:10:10] [music]
[2:10:12] Your loving touch drives all my fears
[2:10:17] away.

[2:11:32] touch.
[2:11:34] But if you give me, Lord, another

[2:11:54] Hallelujah.
[2:11:56] Hallelujah.
[2:11:59] Amen. God bless you. Before Uzzama comes
[2:12:01] to lead us in some songs of worship, let
[2:12:04] me tell you what I believe went on here
[2:12:06] this morning. You may be seated.
[2:12:09] Amen.
[2:12:11] [music]
[2:12:17] Three Sundays ago, I believe it was
[2:12:19] three Sundays ago,
[2:12:21] yeah, we had a Thanksgiving service. You
[2:12:24] remember that?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:12:28] And then the very next week, you know
[2:12:29] what happened?
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Monday, Stanley was gone.
[2:12:35] Tuesday, Miriam was gone. Um, Thursday,
[2:12:39] Brother DC was gone. Friday, I mean, all
[2:12:43] it was just I mean, Friday, Seth was
[2:12:45] gone. Saturday, Sister Kaiser was gone.
[2:12:48] The whole week right after a great
[2:12:52] victory
[2:12:53] and the enemy came in with a flood.
[2:12:57] What was God trying to tell you? Hold
[2:13:00] the line.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Hold the line.
[2:13:04] Brother Theo has no idea.
[2:13:08] All that happened that week, he has not
[2:13:11] one speck of an idea. You might think
[2:13:13] I'm spiritualizing something. This is
[2:13:15] what I'm taking from this service here.
[2:13:19] I'm thanking God who even when I don't
[2:13:22] say it out, he knows the needs in my
[2:13:24] heart and sent his servant here
[2:13:28] to tell you ROOTED AND GROUNDED. HOLD
[2:13:31] THE LINE IN THE FACE OF EVERY DEVIL.
[2:13:34] HOLD the line in THE FACE OF EVERY
[2:13:36] DARKNESS. LET THERE BE LIGHT. HOLD THE
[2:13:39] LINE. CAN SOMEBODY SAY HALLELUJAH?
[2:13:44] [music]
[2:13:48] The very next week that three Sundays
[2:13:51] ago, we were ALL OVER HERE REJOICING AND
[2:13:54] PRAISING GOD. HALLELUJAH. We saw the Red
[2:13:57] Sea OF DESTRUCTION. WE SAW VICTORY
[2:14:00] DANCE. And the devil said, "You think
[2:14:02] that's how it's going to be? You think
[2:14:04] that's how it's going to be? If you're
[2:14:06] not rooted and grounded, that next week
[2:14:08] you are GOING TO BE WIPED OUT." And
[2:14:10] that's WHAT THE DEVIL WANTED TO DO. But
[2:14:13] the Holy Spirit come here and told you
[2:14:16] supernatural interventions. WHAT IS THIS
[2:14:19] MORNING HERE? A SUPERNATURAL
[2:14:21] INTERVENTION BY the way of a message.
[2:14:25] Hold the line.
[2:14:27] OH HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:29] Brother I am so excited.
[2:14:33] Brother Theo has no idea what the Holy
[2:14:38] Spirit USED HIM TO DO THIS MORNING. GOD
[2:14:41] IS COMING BACK a second TIME LAGOS TO
[2:14:44] TELL YOU don't let the devil move you.
[2:14:48] Don't let THE DEVIL SHAKE YOU.
[2:14:50] HALLELUJAH. HOLD THE LINE.
[2:14:53] HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:54] OH, HALLELUJAH.

[2:15:00] You know what that's telling me? go on
[2:15:02] my right on my right side and tell me
[2:15:05] whatever THE DEVIL DOES.
[2:15:08] WHATEVER HE DOES, STAND YOUR GROUND. I
[2:15:12] am with you. I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I'LL
[2:15:16] NEVER FORSAKE YOU. OH, HALLELUJAH. Come
[2:15:20] on. Let's do some songs on Zion. Come on
[2:15:23] up here. [music]
[2:15:25] Can you thank the Lord for the message
[2:15:26] this morning? How could brother Theo
[2:15:29] know? How could he know? That's what we
[2:15:31] needed. That's what we needed. Legacy.
[2:15:34] That's what I needed. That's what you
[2:15:36] needed. Come on. Let's sing some songs
[2:15:38] to s put on your shield. [music] The
[2:15:42] thanksgiving is still on. And it's not

[2:18:30] are still skeptical,
[2:18:33] the Holy Spirit this morning connected
[2:18:36] brother Oick's message with two Sundays
[2:18:39] ago.

[2:18:44] brother Andy gave me? Same quote.

[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; You bring something.
[2:29:08] I'm I'm excited beyond words. But
[2:29:10] there's no excitement. This is rooted
[2:29:12] and grounded in the love of God from
[2:29:15] deep [music] within my soul. Do you
[2:29:17] understand what this message this
[2:29:18] morning means? As you go out of here,
[2:29:21] whatever the devil says, whatever he
[2:29:24] does, you are going to stand flatfooted,
[2:29:27] rooted and grow in law, you are going to
[2:29:30] hold your line. [music]
[2:29:33] If if you are sick and God has spoken to
[2:29:36] your heart that you are well. He has
[2:29:38] healed you on Calvar's mountain. The
[2:29:41] enemy is going to come [music] going to
[2:29:43] bring the symptoms worse. But what are
[2:29:45] you going to do? YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD
[2:29:47] THE LINE.
[2:29:50] You are GOING TO HOLD THE LINE. [music]
[2:29:52] The enemy is banging with a habit and
[2:29:55] you are crying for deliverance and you
[2:29:57] ARE CRYING OUT TODAY and you are saying
[2:29:59] thank you Lord for deliverance. The
[2:30:01] enemy is going to come tomorrow with A
[2:30:03] FIERCE, MORE FIERCE ATTACK. WHAT ARE YOU
[2:30:06] GOING TO DO? HOLD the line. Hold the
[2:30:10] line.
[2:30:11] Listen to brother Bham tell you this
[2:30:13] this morning. Amen.
[2:30:16] [music]
[2:30:18] It said his seat shall possess every
[2:30:22] gate of the enemy.
[2:30:25] Now the city is not battered at the
[2:30:26] gate. He will conquer and take every
[2:30:29] gate. He will possess it. And I say
[2:30:34] after the prophet in the judge of the
[2:30:36] living God this morning, lays the power
[2:30:40] to heal all sickness. What do you say to
[2:30:43] that? Amen. Do you believe that the
[2:30:48] devil WILL MAKE THE SYMPTOMS WORSE, BUT
[2:30:50] I STAND my ground rooted and grounded. I
[2:30:54] am not moving.
[2:30:57] Hallelujah.
[2:30:59] I have MADE THE LORD MY HABITATION. I
[2:31:03] live in him. LET THE DEVIL COME AGAINST
[2:31:05] THAT HOUSE.
[2:31:07] ALL THE line
[2:31:12] in the church of the living God LESS
[2:31:15] POWER TO OVERCOME ALL TEMPTATION.
[2:31:19] WHEN the devil comes and knocking,
[2:31:21] [music] tempting you this way, that way,
[2:31:24] THEY'LL THINK YOU OVERCAME THAT DEMON,
[2:31:26] that sin, that habit, WHAT DO YOU DO?
[2:31:29] HOLD THE LINE.
[2:31:33] Because in the church of THE LIVING GOD
[2:31:35] THIS MORNING, LET'S THE POWER TO CHANGE
[2:31:38] SIN AND THROW IT AWAY and receive the
[2:31:42] person of the Holy Ghost in the church
[2:31:45] of Jesus Christ. Whatsoever you desire,
[2:31:48] ask in my name and it shall be given to
[2:31:51] you. A little while and the word, the
[2:31:56] originated se will see me no more, but
[2:31:59] you will see me for I'll be with you,
[2:32:02] even in you to the end of the world.
[2:32:06] What the royal seed, the work that I do
[2:32:10] shall you do also. I VERIFY MYSELF THAT
[2:32:15] I AM WITH YOU. WHY? BECAUSE YOU ARE A
[2:32:18] CANDIDATE FOR ASSOCIATION WITH ANGELIC
[2:32:21] BEINGS AND THE SUPERNATURAL. Look all
[2:32:24] around you. Another supernatural event
[2:32:27] this Sunday morning.
[2:32:33] Hallelujah. He shall possess
[2:32:37] the the seed of the enemy. He shall
[2:32:39] possess, he shall possess the gate of
[2:32:42] his enemy. No matter what the gate is,
[2:32:45] if it's sickness, if it's temptations,
[2:32:49] if it's sin, WHATEVER GATE IT IS, IT is
[2:32:52] already conquered.
[2:32:54] And the seed of Abraham possesses it.
[2:32:58] Aren't you happy this morning to know
[2:33:00] that we stand now more than a conqueror?
[2:33:03] I'm reading more than a conqueror. Oh,
[2:33:06] there's nothing to fight about.
[2:33:08] Nothing to fight about. The fight is
[2:33:11] over. The whistle has blowed. The flag
[2:33:15] has rose. And in the midst of every sin
[2:33:18] path in the midst of every sick room is
[2:33:21] the old rugged cross planted by the
[2:33:24] blood of Jesus Christ, a conqueror. Only
[2:33:26] thing we do is believe. Look, and live.
[2:33:29] I'll be with you. I'll prove. People
[2:33:32] come in the last day and say, "Oh, well
[2:33:34] that was, but I'll be with you." And the
[2:33:37] very things I did here on earth, I'll
[2:33:39] have been you [music and singing] doing
[2:33:40] the very same thing. Then they will
[2:33:42] know. They'll see me. My people will see
[2:33:46] me. He's telling you, you will see me.
[2:33:49] You'll see me tomorrow on your job.
[2:33:51] You'll see me when the direction [music]
[2:33:53] going to break you down. You will see me
[2:33:56] when it seems like there's no way out.
[2:33:58] When it seems like I just can't go on no
[2:34:00] more, you will see me. Hallelujah. And
[2:34:03] the world will not see me, but you will
[2:34:05] see me. Open your open eyes.
[2:34:10] The people will see me. The seed of
[2:34:13] Abraham will see me. They will recognize
[2:34:15] me. They will call me. The others will
[2:34:18] come in behind
[2:34:25] your eyes. You'll see me for I'll be
[2:34:28] with [music] you even to the end of the
[2:34:29] world. the very same things that I do,
[2:34:33] he that believeth on me, the works that
[2:34:35] I do shall lead to also. Same kind of
[2:34:38] work. And today, the church of the
[2:34:41] living God has the privilege of standing
[2:34:45] and seeing the [music] conquering
[2:34:48] resurrected Jesus Christ, the son of the
[2:34:50] living God, [music] standing present,
[2:34:54] living in his church, doing the same
[2:34:56] thing he did then. then we possess the g
[2:34:59] of every enemy.
[2:35:01] [music]
[2:35:03] And as I leave you here this morning,
[2:35:08] hear the words of the prophet. If you've
[2:35:10] got an enemy this morning, [music] then
[2:35:13] my brother, my sister, there's only one.
[2:35:18] If you are a seed of Abraham, after
[2:35:21] hearing this this message this morning,
[2:35:26] there's not enough devils in hell that
[2:35:30] can KEEP THAT GATE BEFORE YOU. If you
[2:35:33] don't believe it, it won't happen for
[2:35:34] you. But if you believe it, THERE'S NOT
[2:35:37] ENOUGH DEVILS to keep that gate before
[2:35:40] you.
[2:35:43] I don't care what it is.
[2:35:46] Walk up there as a promise seed and say,
[2:35:50] "I claim this for mine. This is mine
[2:35:54] because God swore that he will raise up
[2:35:57] Jesus and through Jesus, I'll conquer
[2:35:59] it. And I conquer it in the name of
[2:36:02] Jesus Christ."
[2:36:04] Step back and pressing through.
[2:36:07] Hallelujah. It shall possess the gate of
[2:36:09] the enemy. Then stand up there with your
[2:36:13] shoulders back with a holy boldness. Did
[2:36:16] you hear me? A holy boldness. [music] A
[2:36:20] boldness to declare the word of God. It
[2:36:22] shall be because it already was. Because
[2:36:25] Jesus died to save you from [music] sin,
[2:36:29] sickness, and bondage. HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:32] HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:34] Then stand up there with your shoulders
[2:36:36] back and your shield are shining covered
[2:36:39] by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:36:42] with your plow shears into swords.
[2:36:49] The enemy will recognize it. If you have
[2:36:52] need this morning, talk to him now while
[2:36:55] we pray. you in here this morning while
[2:36:57] you have your heads bowed and all you
[2:36:59] that have a need will you just raise
[2:37:01] your hand towards Jesus and just speak
[2:37:03] it in your heart in your heart and say
[2:37:05] Lord you know my need now I've heard
