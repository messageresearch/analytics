from Canada in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ special greetings to real brother Theo Ovid his wife family and the headstone tabernacle I thank brother Theo for inviting me to say a few words to the convention I believe the time of life it's perfect inspiration relative believe this pride is right now in her time of life my little thought tonight to share with you with you all praise the lord god bless you all it's from Exodus 23 2009 dan angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared wow talk about God's grace he has sent an angel yes with Malachi for the angel of the Lord and he has prepared a place for us and I do believe that the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is that angel as never left the bride praise God and it's nothing else but God's grace we don't need no man's GPS because we have God's GPS the angel knows the way to the rapture he knows the way to the supper of the Lamb hallelujah I know the way to the resurrection amen hallelujah and this is being that this is God's grace this is his attitude towards us because we take this promise and we we take it present tense because everything we read this present tense of course and we see that it's God's attitude towards us the bride so in return God wants to see our attitude praise God towards his grace towards what he has done for us that's why verse 21 beware of him and obey his voice do not provoke him for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if you will obey his voice and do all that I speak is he speaks through that angel amen which is manifested in a five for ministry fission's praise God Ephesians four praise God I speak then I will be an enemy to your adversaries for my angel will go before you and bring you listen to this bring you to a flower betta bees no bring you to the amorite and the jebusite and all the ice you see testing hard trials yes amen being rejected and despised and bring you to a Gethsemane amen bring you to a Calvary Calvary first and then to the rapture oh praise God bring you to perfect weakness I do believe that this angel is now leading every member of this bride into a state of perfect weakness he's taking care of all be myself and I in you and I you see the Prophet says Lord more of you in me and less of me in me and that's it you see the bride has to learn that she is nothing and I believe that she's learning it right now and he's taking us of course to to a Calvary like I said and we have the promise of a squeeze and right now we see a pandemic we never thought we would see a pandemic like this but I believe that God has everything under control that is for our good everything works together for good to those who love God praise God so I do believe that it's nothing else but God's grace grace was before the law during the law and after the law that's brother branham's words and I do believe that this Ephesians that he has led us to will bring a perfect bride she has the staff the Lord she keeps still and she had learned she has learned to wait on him and they that wait upon him shall renew their strength so perfect weakness will bring perfect strength which will be nothing which is nothing that we have ever done but totally His grace so may God be with every one of you as we're waiting on him as we're taking were taken to Calvary Gethsemane first in Calvary and then to the rapture may the Lord bless you richly in a many many men you appreciate that god bless you hallelujah let's get a lot of shout of praise amen amen

asked that we open our Bibles as we read from three parts of Scripture sin looks on in 30 so 24:36 2:45 and that's one one two three say Luke 7:30 written is wise even those shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed and seen Luke 24:36 2:45 and as they don't speak Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and shear them to them peace be unto you but they were terrified and have fried it and suppose that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do the thoughts arise in your hearts behold on my hands and my feet that is I myself handle me and see for a spirit had no flesh and bones as sashimi had and when he had thus spoken he showed unto them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here been him it and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and an honeycomb and he took it and did it before them and he said unto them these are the words which are speaking to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms concerning me he had been speaking to them this is the son of man I've been speaking to them revealing them to them unveiling the mysteries of the Old Testament that's what he's referring to right here he's bringing back all those mysteries in his resurrection ministry for 40 days while he speak to them concerning the things of the kingdom of God verse 44 rich again and he said unto them these are the words which are speaking to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and the prophets in the SAMS concerning me then open here they are understanding that they might understand the scriptures - one verse 1 to verse 3 before my traders arrived mirror with your philosopher that Jesus began but to do and teach on to the day in which was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commands unto the Apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs been seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God no not especially no his early works god bless you and trust that wherever you're watching from a trust that the blessing of God has been with you and you have had a great time in the meetings and the griffon about you know the virtual convention is that everybody can attend even those who are denied II would not be entry in that everybody can attend so we thank God for this blessing in everything we think we give God all the queries because the Bible says all things work together for good to them that love God why they called according to his purpose so we thank God and we bless them for everything I want to send my greetings to you know the believers are watching from everywhere and also to the pastures and the managers and the believers you know from everywhere who are watching and especially to my mentioned brethren who also spoken the means and those who are yet to speak god bless you and thank you for your ministry and thank you for your blessing your messages and the blessing you have been done through the years god bless you so I'd like to take a little thought there's seven sales with chief and I know brother feels inspiration is the chime of life and speaking about the chime our lives I would like to look at it from the context of the harvest and because the harvest and the time of life are very closely intertwined as a matter of fact they are one and the same thing because in the harvest that's when food is brought forth I'm one a footage but for that's sick time that's fruit sick time and also the time of life is very much the same thing because some of life is also about fruitfulness see time also harvest time that's when all of the life that's in the shot get into the seed in order the receipt can go back to original condition so you can become like this seed that was planted because in the harvest you don't expect something different you plant a a corn seed you expiry currency and the consid your planet you expect the same thing at the harvest the only difference is you get so much more you don't plant one conceed and they get one policy you get one constant I get so much more conceit but the integrity the quality of the seal is the same thing so what you planted is what you are going to get at the cabbage and all of the life that's in the seed comes in so that at harvest time while you planted the seed goes back to original condition again so that the seed you're harvesting is exactly the same set as you planted so the harvest time and the sum of life I'm speaking about that but the bumps it on the masterpiece page probably 166 on 168th he said now at harvest time the series back to his original life back to the Bible but I won six feared harvest and the city's back to its original condition so some of life speaks of harvest time and harvest time speaks about some of life they are one of the same thing is the time when all of the life gets into the sea and this it goes back to original condition goes back to original seed green that can be harvested now speaking about the harvest Works tells describes and defines the harvest the following ways is the season for gathering in agricultural crops number two is the act or process of gathering in a crop three in might or crop of grain or fruit for the quantity of a natural product gathered in a single season 5 the product or reward of Accession those are the different definitions that works as give the harvest I'm sure there are so many other editions we can give for this capture the harvest is not for us so from all of this we can gather that the harvest is a gathering time here at noon time is it my drawing time the time of joy the time of hope the time of Plenty the time of increase is the time of fruitfulness now speaking about the harvest this edge here or below recent church age spiritually speaking is the harvest age of all the ages because they the recent church age is the end of the church ages and so it's the harvest age jesus said the harvest is the end of the world is an insane Matthew 13 verse 39 I believe so the ladies nitrogen is the harvest age is the gathering age of the church edges when dough will gather up and harvest all the seeds that he has planted all down through the ages the whole eastern church age the ripen time is maturing time is the gathering time of all the ages when all the seats will be gathered together and taken back to their father's home and at the same time what God is doing his garden off you sit together there's gonna be a gathering of all the tears are uniting together you gather together of all the tears that I've been planted from the beginning since the gonna be done and Jesus captured this so well in the parable of the wooden tears in st. Matthew chapter 13 the wheat and the tares leave them all let them go together another end go see our sin is angelic Reapers and they shall separate the wheat from the tears the tears they shall gather to be burned on the width they shall gather into the father's arm gana so in this harvest of God's great plan and program for the human race God is gonna harvest his own crop the wheat and take them into his gana the same gana that Jesus Adam the early bright malik al for the Kim Arif and that's this same gana that this endtime bright was the bread of all the ages is trusting to be gathered back into and at the same time like I said already the other crop the tears go will gather them into bundles to be burned in the Tribulation Period so we are the in time they harvest the tamil life so if Larissa is the harvest age then must be a time of life it is a harvest age it's our life then must be an age of life the venom said he said Alicia this is the age of personal life and that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is interested in the personal life of Jesus Christ to get that life into their person to the bin that's what the blood is about so you get the life the personal life of Jesus Christ not he gets another man's life and they gather past his life the minister's life the daddy's life nobody's life but the personal life of Jesus Christ and the blood of Christ understands that the whole essence of the gospel of Malachi first message this endtime message that we so believe in that the prophet brought preached and lived and manifested the essence of it is an invitation to the life of Jesus Christ we have been invited to meet the life of Jesus Christ we have been invited to add the like the behavior of Jesus Christ every single day of our lives and that's what the promises that when the personal life of Jesus Christ is for Satan and manifested by the Holy Spirit in the flesh of this bride then at that time she becomes the Word made flesh she becomes like the original seed she becomes back to the original grain that can be harvested that can't be taken back to the father's Ghana taking in the rapture checking back to the Garden of Eden the Bramson on the message how can I overcome he said this is the age of life the personal life of Jesus Christ so we thank God to understand that there is here is the interpersonal life is the charm of life is the harvest age so we thank God to be here to have a knowledge and understanding of this face that the prophet taught us and to know what our promise is what we are looking for so we can leave every day with expectation on the anticipations knowing that God he will keep his word now if this is the harvest age then there's going to be a famine there's going to be a hospital man and God is the great husband man in this harvest who walks through the feast in the harvest time looking at the crops and when he sees the first ripen crop he plucks it just like Boris did in the story of Ruth in the Bible Boris the kinsman redeemer while he was on the way to redeeming Ruth Nami and Ruth walk through the harvest fields in Bali season in Bali harvest now in the Old Testament barley harvest what happened there now we gotta get some historical context here some understanding here of the nation and the Land of Israel because Israel climate is quite moderate there to harvest seasons each year in Israel one in the fall one and the one in the spring firstly and then the other one in the fall barley harvest takes place in the spring and with harvest follows in the fall now what happens sign of the harvest in Bali harvest the husbandmen walks through the fields and in going through the fields looking at the crops and when he sees the first ripened grain he plucks up the first ratman green that he has and according to their law given to them by God he takes their wrap and green to the high priest who takes that green wrap and green and offers it on his behalf before the Lord for his acceptance as a sign that the harvest is here number one and number two as a sign that the there are more crops coming in the harvest the wheat harvest that's coming on very shortly thousands follow and the Israelites could not eat of the fruit from the harvest on to the Mideast offered so that this was the the Bali harvest was the the the firstfruits from their the harvest and they had to lock that to take the high priests if they don't do that they are not to eat from the fruit of the harvest themselves and so God had the Jewish nation his chosen people signify and type out this events of the harvest by the third and fourth feast of Jehovah of course the Old Testament God had spoke the prophet Moses and gave instructions for Israel through their generations to observe seven feasts and these seven feasts represent amends so many things for the nation of Israel and of course means so many things for the Christian believer down through the ages and especially in this age here now the feast of Jehovah the Feast of the Lord and you find that in Leviticus chapter 23 the feast of Jehovah as follows number one the feast of Passover number two the feast of unleavened bread number three the fist of will ship or the feast of firstfruits that's the Bali harvest a number for the feast of with loaves or the feast of Pentecost there was which harvest a number five was the Feast of Trumpets number six the feast of atonement and number seven the feast of tabernacles now we're not getting to that but if you look at this fish here it captures the whole story of the nanofy of position of Israel from their deliverance in Egypt from sleep in Egypt to their entry into the promised land and if you go along the line this some fish typed so many things the tab represented so many things down through the Bible down through the ages especially this selfish type Redemption this selfish type the seven spirits of God this seven feasts of a low tide the seven companions of Jehovah this some fish type the seven churches and so many things that excite but our focus is on the third and the fourth fish of Jehovah which were the fish of the first fruits which was the wave sheaf to represent Valley harvest and the fourth feast was the fist of the wit loose which represented with harvest which is also called the feast of Pentecost now this third and fourth freeze was separated by a period of 50 days when the turn of Israel obviously when they are Patek of the feast of firstfruits and the feast of Pentecost which is the barley harvest and wheat harvest they are separated by a period of 50 days now there are several types of the Bible of these two fists that we can type this - three - through the scriptures and the church edges now we can speak about this - fishing so so many different types barley harvest wheat harvest Bonnie harvest with others and is so very many things that it's up to the Bible because we understand that the Bible the Word of God is a book of symbols and the way the Bible is reading like what the Panem taught us is in love later that like a man who is in love the woman who writes to her and other people just really perfunctory lady just Rudy's from his office but the woman who is reading to can look at the typical read in between the lines and that's what God the way God has designed the water God for his children is beloved is bright because the fact that there are so many types and shadows in the Bible gives the Bible a death gives the Word of God it did give it give it give gives a profundity that the natural eye cannot see but with spiritual eyes you can look into the Word of God and see deeper meanings beyond what the natural eyes can see and that's what type in the scriptures does for the believer and so but the Benham said here or a quote it is the rising of a son whatever you want is there a lot you read a little scripture here for you I'd like for you to turn to another scripture a girl wrote on here it might help you a little he's fine in the book of Liberty calls the 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th verse that's this same scripture I just referred to speaking about the seven feasts of Jehovah about Brahmaji find true this fish here look at what he said listen close in the law the Levitical law God speaking to Moses listen all these things are types now I will stop here for a few moments to get into this type and it's type in a certain way and I'm typing in a certain way also and there's so many types down through the Babel because Balaam said God doesn't reveal his mystery full but down through the ages down through the Scriptures he has revealed his mystery through different types and shadows down through the Bible and through the ages so barley and wheat harvest let's look at a few types here our first type the fists of waved sheath spoke of Jesus Christ the firstfruits of the residue remember in Bali harvest the husband won't walk through the fields and the first crop that come to maturity it clogged it and to be dehydrates and Jesus Christ represented that to the believer in God's great grant program of redemption Jesus was the width I mean was a work shift the first fruit of the resurrection the first one to come out from the day the first one to raise from the dead the will shift the Bali harvest and they stab Jesus at his resurrection because he rose from the dead and become became the firstfruits of the Resurrection when the firstfruits like the husbandmen took it to the to the high priest like the phosphorus Jesus was waved before the Lord for our acceptance when he rose from the dead and Mary met him Mary wanted to touch him he said no Mary I got to appear before my father first don't touch me Mary I've got to ascend to my father and your father my god and your God my Lord and your Lord don't touch me Mary because he had to be presented before the Lord for our acceptance before he could come I'm Minister to his children in those 40 days of his resurrection ministry resurrection represented the feast of firstfruits or barley harvest so you may ask the question why did he need to be waived for the same reason that the first-fruits was waved in the Old Testament he need to be waved in order number one two reasons number one in order that the Christian Church that this kinsman redeemer had died to redeem may be accepted in the beloved he had done the job father I have done the job have finished a walking game etude to do that they might be accelerating the beloved and number two he had to be waved for his sign that the Christian church that he died to redeem was soon coming into view and exactly that's what happened because fifty days later on the day of Pentecost the Christian Church started coming to view when he was waved over the people the predestiny received by the holy spirit the holy spirit waved him over the people in the Marriott calling of the holy ghost in the feast of Pentecost and that Christian should Derek died to redeem started coming into view that Feast of Pentecost that happened exactly 15 years after his resurrection that represented the Feast of the wave moves the wit habit the fourth feast of Jehovah so get the picture let's recover be the focus of Jehova barley harvest represented Jesus Christ the firstfruits from the resurrection and when he rose from the dead that was Bally harvest the firstfruits presented before the Lord for acceptance for a sign that the Christian Church that dr. Aydin is going to come forth on fifty days later the second are the four fish the fish of whipped loaves the wheat harvest after barley harvest wheat harvest follow through on the fiftieth day after his resurrection the Babson of the Holy Ghost pour into the Christian Church to give birth to that church and that was the waving in over the people so it was with before the Lord and was weaved over the people Bramson the rising of the sun bhagavaty for the shift which was the first of your seat that you planted when it comes up and ripened you cut down this ship and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the lot for your acceptance that you are accepted you have come with your ship and used to wave it the hat trick is to wave it before the Lord program idiot noticed it was the form of God's wit that had been raised on the dead Jesus God's foreskin of wheat by God's quick clean power gotta quick in his life reasonable from the dead and he was the frost foot or those that select the first fluid he was that shift that's why they had to waive that shift for him for it was the first one that come to maturity he was the first son of God that come to maturity after Adam fell by sin in the Garden of Eden and he was waived as a memorial of thanks given to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign so that's why he had to be waived I'm before we go on let's notice a few lessons here number one he was a whiff sheaf and what does that mean okay it was a worship but the Christian Church that he died to are random in an Kim thought in the wit harvest was with loose he was the will ship this was with lows Bali has produced the would shift the wood harvest produce the with loaves what does this mean Christ on the day of his resurrection was the work shift and the first foot of the resurrection and what this means is that the Chadha was born at Pentecost unlike him was he was one single with sheath but the child that was born our tentacles was not a single ship but it was a real union of different particles mixed together joined together and made into one homogeneous body but the way she was one single ship and so listings let me see that God had defense so well thought out that to totally represent what he was going to do today represent for us this same boss and types that he let in the scriptures so we will see very very clearly that the gospel redemption was pre-planned by God how it all figured out and plan it before the foundation of the world and secondly if you notice also a few lessons there if you notice also first lesson was he was a whiff ship single ship the archer that came after him on the day of vehicles was whipped loose different particles ground together and mixed together to form a homogeneous body and secondly you noticed from Libya 33 that are the Feast of the will chief there was no leaven offered you can read it there because 23 verses neither 22 there was no 11 offered you in other words Jesus Christ no leaven because he represented the wood sheaf in presenting the work she there was no leaven offered brought in presenting the with loathes the loaves were baked in with leaven now what does this mean the leaven like we all know like Bible believers you know the eleven represents in the leaven is saying a little leaven leavens the whole lump so that means the if the firstfruits had no leaven this represent amend that Jesus Christ there was no leaven no sin no evil in Jesus Christ the width shift but in the chart that was born on the day of Pentecost it was bacon the Whitlow's was bacon with our arm with 11 the 11 there represents and signifies that there was still seen in the church now when we say that if you don't understand it might look like they sinned a lot in the church no that's not what it means that's not what it means because this here this fact here therein lies the mystery and the greatness and the glory of the Church of the Living God because the glory of the church is not the absence of cinema Church but the glory of the church is in the power that is in the church to raise and live far above sin to live in total victory over and above sin because the devil is still there to trouble the people so it's not an inability to sin even when the bride is at the object she will still be subject to temptations it is not an adoption is not an inability to sin coming to profession is not an inability to sin or an inability or you are you you are you are you are you can not be so via the temptations anymore no but the glory of the church is coming to adoption and the Christian believer now knows that the glory of the choice' there's power in the church to live above sin even though there's leaven there seemed as evil for the glory and greatness of the Church of Christ is the power to live above the sin so it's not an inability to sin he's not unabie to be tempted but is the power and the glory and the ability and the grace of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer to live in total victory and dominion over sin that's what the leaven represents the cinema Chur believers do things and they are still that people struggling back and forth but the the the the hope is that don't let the same tie you down don't let the devil tell you you cannot overcome this know the level in the church is there to let you understand that there is power there's glory there's greatness that's the grace of God in the church in your life to live above that sin because Jesus said the gates of Hell shall not prevail against you saying shall not have dominion over you and you are predestinated to live that glorious life that's what the arm the leaven in the church baked in with the wave loss that's what it represents that's one type of the harvest and the wheat harvest let's quickly take a second second type the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost that was the Feast of Pentecost right to start the Christian Church that outpouring was the first fruits of the Holy Spirit been caught up knows what first fruits of the Holy Spirit being poured out and you can relate that to Jesus cry being the firstfruits and the deer pinnacles that bride was the firstfruits in the Christian Church the phosphors they received they are point of the Holy Ghost once it was given because before this time the Holy Ghost was not given but when the Holy Ghost was given or the japanagos to breath and may come to pass the Christian Church this R was the firstfruits and then a long period 50 days later brother branham said the fish the next fish which was the feed feast was the fish of the trumpets now what do all these represent what do all these represent between Christ and panicles between the with shift the Bali harvest and winner which was fifty days between panicles the first foods of Pentecost and the feast of the trumpet which was the fifth feast of jehovah was also fifty days long period poppadom said was fifty days so what do all these represent here's what it represents and so many of the things for these are context here represent that between Christ the would shift the resurrection and Pentecost there are fifty days and also be limp in occurs on the face of the trumpets was also 50 days and fifty days is a jubilee fifty days represent seven Sabbath's seven times seven is forty-nine that leaves you an extra day with takes you into eternity beyond the seven churches because the seven Sabbath's represent and type out the seven Church edges of the Christian Church that the Redeemer died to redeem and what the fifty days represent here is this seven the Holy Ghost was put out on fifty days seven church ages this Holy Ghost will continually be poured out to call out this Christian Church in seven Church ages that this Redeemer had died to redeem so it represents the long time between the Feast of Pentecost and the next which represents the long Pentecostal Jubilee or the coroner of the Christian Church through the seven Church ages and that began on the day of Pentecost so these are some types that this fish represents to the believer today and these types are so very very meaningful to you and I now problem-set here on the message recognizing a Deanna's message now we noticed last Sunday there was their walls are there preaching the feast days and there was a feast of Pentecost that's the the the with here'sh that's whipped loose that's the fourth feast preaching the Feast of Pentecost and between the Feast of Pentecost and Feast of Trumpets does it fit fish was a long period of time exactly fifty days between Pentecost and the Feast of Trumpets and fifty days with Pentecost means 15 it was the ship waving the first fruits of the harvest was brought in and this was the first fruits of the Holy Ghost being poured upon the church and we see it was in tight back that it's always inside because that's where the deepness the depth of the meaning is as where the richness is that's where the profundity that's where they that's that's where God hides it's from the arm from the wise and the prudent and refrig the bit such as we learn and tap is not just for intellectual you know to tickle your intellect is to bring you the richness of the lessons that God wants to impart into your life and into my life so for the banca news here the fruit frost full of the harvest was brought in and we see it was in tight back there with the natural force fruits Jesus I mean the the the Bali average was natural first fruits Jesus was the first fruits from the resurrection and the Church of Pentecost was the first fruits to receive the Holy Ghost is just showing these different types here show you you can't add these things to Bali harvest is surely different first fruits first fruits first fruits sure and we see it was in tight back there with the natural phosphors representing the phosphates of the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon the people first fruits and we find out about 150 days that the 50 days was received by the Gentiles the Christian Church tatted and 50 days before the next feast that's what he's talking to you about here the firstfruits and then 52 because the firstfruits showed that more are coming so we've seen here actually from the 50 days would be exact now actually I know I'm sorry let's back up a bit and we found out that the 50 days was received by the Gentiles which got call from the gent as a people for his name the Feast of the Pentecost the Feast of Pentecost and then 50 days inside representing seven church ages and we have been going through that long Feast of Pentecost the seven churches now actually from the fifty days would be exactly seven Sabbath's and seven Sabbath's represented the seven churches to be called the seven areas to be called in the time of the Pentecostal feast of Pentecost to call it people from the Gentiles for his name and that's the fish we have been going through this long feast of Pentecost so we can see the different types here the Bali harvest and we harvest represent Bali harvest fresh fruits a sign that more gonna come a sign that God has accepted a Santa you have been examine the beloved and that's what you want to understand God has accepted you Christ died rose up presenting before the father is and then we were coming and to prove the point on the deer plane comes fifty days later the truth that he died to redeem started to come and they have been coming in this long Pentecostal feast for seven church ages that's why said like that this promise on to you until your children and to them that took us to them that afar off to as many as the Lord our God shall call and he's still calling and by the Brahma said there three ages matter age the reformer age and the cold are aging with saying go to have a revelation that we are here at the close of this calling out in the Pentecostal age we are in the call our age under problem husband sent a call out a bride and here we are so barley harvest and with average so we don't lose a foot here Bali harvest and wheat harvest so if we say that this latest empathy Jia is the harvest age of the of the church then it simply follows against all this background that if this indeed be the harvest age of the church ages the judges remember span all the way to Adam in the Garden of Eden if this indeed be the harvest age then to perfectly tap the events of the harvest this age must have a barley harvest and a we harvest the Bali has been the wave ship the first fruits and the wheat harvest been there's so many more to come after that first fruit that we'd have I mean that that thou with ship that first fruits and so there must be a Bali harvest with a well shift in this age and a wheat harvest with web those are not the Feast of Pentecost in this larry-san age here how are we getting the picture barley harvest Jesus Christ first fruits of the Resurrection barley harvest the blood of Pentecost phosphorus we see the Holy Ghost and after phosphorous the most common harvest and wheat harvest after Jesus Christ the first was resurrection would have a scheme on the day of Pentecost and the Christian child was born now the dear pinnacle said in a second type was the firstfruits of the Christian Church first was of those who see the Holy Ghost and the same way after the firstfruits must also come with habits the Feast of Pentecost at the end if this be the age of the harvest age of the church ages we must have barley harvest and wheat harvest in other words there must be in this age the wave sheaf Jesus Christ the firstfruits in a Bali harvest in this age because he alone is the firstfruits unknown else he was the firstfruits on the other resurrection it was the first fruits or real Pentacles he is always the phosphors and if is in this area he must be the first fruits or Jesus Christ has got to be here somehow in this area as the first fruits in this harvest in the valley harvest in this age here in other words after him the Bali harvest in this age here there must also come sons and daughters like on the day of Pentecost there must come in with harvest to produce another feast of Pentecost another day of Pentecost in this area just exactly as the day of Pentecost follows the original waving of the wave sheaf Jesus Christ I hope you again in the picture in your foreign me so Jesus Christ is gonna be here as a whipped this have is age at the end of a church ages well before the Lord and also waved over the people as the with ship he must be here to be waved before the Lord and worked over the people as the whiff ship for our acceptance and for assignment that more and more sons and daughters are coming after him in a wheat harvest also in this age and this sons and daughters grow as they harvest another harvest the seed is back to original condition again and so these sons and daughters that will come after the phosphors the barley harvest the worksheet Jesus Christ in this age must also come back to original grain again original seed because this is harvest time the seed is back to original condition again in harvest time the cities back to original grain again in harvest time because as you're ready coded at harvest time the city's back to his original life is back to its original condition now having said that you want to understand what is original condition the bottom said the spoken word is the original seed and the original seed is a spoken word now we understand jesus said in matthew 13 and he said this when he spoke about the purple or the or the other surah he said the seed is the word of God and we and I know the life is in the seed but if the life is in the seed and the cities the world so the seed must derive is life from the word so the life in the city is actually in the world the life in the city is hidden in the world and that's where the bomb is coming from when he said the proper word is the original C in other words the spoken word is the life of the siege the life in the spoken word is actually the life is what give the city's life so original condition we get back to original seed and the life of a spoken word will be there in that original seed so that's the life to look for in harvest time and that's the life to look for in God's harvest the life of the original seed and brother Branham said the spoken word is original it was a spoken word there spoken what the logos that came out of God in the beginning when God spoke the word Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit their life life is in the world well what gives the Civic's life and the Lotus in the beginning the life in the logos because Lucas is the spoken word the life in the logos is what gives the seeds life Adam was a seed of the word so the life Adam lived came off of the life of the Mobile's and the locust is the son of God so the life in the logos the original sword of God is the life of the scene the spoken word is the life of the original seed and that's why in the harvest the life we are looking for in this good harvest at the end time is the life of the spoken word the spoken word is the life that you are looking for when you see a break come back to spoken war thus saith the Lord hear ye him or keep still then you know you have seen a bride you are witnessing would have as you are witnessing a bride that has come back to original condition again because the spoken word is the original seed and the life of the spoken word is the life that's in the seed and Adam demonstrated this token what like in the Garden of Eden before the fall spoken word life of course you understand that Adam was the pinnacle of God's original habits on the earth because the Christian was a harvest because God spoke let there be and there was let there be and there was let there be on the words is cook an egg or a harvest right away he spoke the plan came of in spoke the Salaf came up he spoke our animals came in land and he spoke and credit man so Adam was the pinnacle of God's original harvest the original lad that Adam had he derived it from the spoken word of God when God said let there be and the logos the Son of God came out of Elohim that spoken word that life in the spoken word that's what Adam ultimate of because Adam was his seed of the world and just like you and I are a seat of the world and the spoken word the life in the spoken word which was a son of God give Adam his life in the Garden of Eden so when we say Adam have spoken words it was the life he lived is spoken what life when we talk about adoption coming to perfection of the spoken word it's a life he's not just words like what when you hear here he is life and uh we will try and break it up a little bit for a few minutes before we close out so Adam had this is talking about life that was the original seed the original seed the spoken word is the life of the recognize it when you hear the spoken word is original seed it means the life of the city is in the spoken word in other words the life the spoken word is the life of the original seed and the life of the spoken word is the life of the Son of God the logos did feel funny the world the life of the origin honorable and Adam had the life that a lot of the dinosaur of God and it was all expressed as the spoken word life that Adam had but the Brahms Adam could speak Adam could name you could do whatever he had spoken what is spoken what like it all tied connected to his life and this total one that was what I don't had in the Garden of Eden now what did Adam having the gamin of Eden Adam had three things and that's what he lost when he fell by sin he had eternal life you have fellowship with God he had an inheritance in his eternal life he had a fellowship God he had eternal life and eternal life Adam had a body in which it could live forever because it was said the day you eat thereof that day you die in other words if it is not eat thereof he his body could make him live forever another story but he had fellowship with God he had eternal life and he had in his eternal life and inheritance in his eternal life this inheritance summed up this his um spoken word life some of the life of the Son of God that expressed it on the outside his fellowship with God is our eternal life was all expressed unveiled and hidden in his expression all these inheritance in life and that expression was by the spoken word but the spoken word that he had included the kind of life he lived in the garden had them with Eve Adam and Eve with the spoken word speak it was the life of the Son of God the spoken language was the expression of it and showing Adam had supreme complete control on the face of the earth that was the life of a son of God that's a life of the logos the logos way up in heaven Lucifer came up against him he had total complete dominion over a Lucifer that was the life of the logos that was the life of the Son of God now was the life that was intellectual Adam that was the life in the scene in Adam and that's the life in the city in you and I that we were not aware of Augustine had profited a message with a seven singers to wave it over us so we'll have an awareness of what we have been given by God what we have been predestinated to to in this enzyme here so Adam went through the garden lived on the face of this earth here with that spoken word life is in inheritance he's throwing the absolute joy to be a son of God on the face of the earth Adam was leave us it was the pinnacle of God's habits Adam wasn't even the original see the original son of God on the earth original condition Adam was the Word made flesh the Word was posited through his flesh that was the spoken word life and it could speak it couldn't name but the venom said a tree never dead before Adam but the drum said Adam could get whatever he wanted Adam could ask for anything whatever you wanted that was the spoken word life it was such power such authority such a no-show that is son of God and I matured God was on the face of the earth deputizing and acting on the face of this earth in the place of his father God that's what Adam oars that's what original condition is that's what the seed going back to see again is that's what the seed boom but is still harvest and that's what we are looking for so in this abbis time here we are looking for the word to be made flesh in this era Samia we are looking for the supreme control panel thority like Adam hadn't got a reading and this power and authority was was very and in a book in a title deed which was hidden in the tree of life which was the book of life she went Adam sinned he lost access to that book and the book went back to the hands of ignorant owner she said and try to check it he couldn't check the book but notice now Shannon could not take the book body inheritance Adams inheritance their earth did not go back to the hands original owner the authority went back to the hundred of God I mean the title deed went back to the hands of the original owner but the inheritance that's why the devil by banquet is water is squatting on the face of the earth that's why he can go around and exhibit this parent that modest and that power because is his free property and his ruin alone on the face of the earth as do you only but he does not have it does not have the title deed it's like somebody you know you leave your house and your heart is empty and somebody comes in and stays there and is behaving like the owner in the neighborhood and all that feels like that but if the authority comes the the government comes even want to see the papers of the house your people study healthier it doesn't have any purpose to show Lucifer has not too much to show for the UH for his for it claims to the earth here like it to Jesus distance have been given to me bow to me he is the prince and the pound the rule of the air right now heroes in the world litter of disobedience right now but he doesn't have the title deed that's where the 7-series coming that's where Malik offers ministries of such vital importance in the kingdom of God and that's why the devil has got to attack it is you deal me to a type of the Proms message it'll be a full an idiot to not attack it so attacking it it's totally perfectly in line with the scriptures but you and I we know what is about because Adam lost that title and Buckley has original owner but God said I will restore it right back I'll resolve that Church right back and that's the story that's why Jesus Christ died and rose from the dead to become the firstfruits from among the dead to rise in victory and power and authority over Lucifer because when he died he went to a head east said they are the saints of God free because Jesus had not died so they could not break through the folds or demon powers and go before our to heaven before God and Jesus had to die went to hell and took the the keys of death and hell from from Lucifer and and in doing that is said God's children free and said all of gods are the human race free for ever and that's what Jesus Christ dying represented and when he rose on the resurrection morning when he rose on research Wayne rose in victory and triumphant over Lucifer over death hell and the grave that was our kinsman redeemer rising in victory total victory he had won the battle that was the price then that we paid tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu get this book back for us to get this title deed back for us he had that prize and when he paid the price he took the keys of death and hell from ceiling he took the secret of death secret of Hell from Lucifer he took it from him and he rose from the dead and that's one we won't touch him like no other ago before my father job John job completed it is finished and he rose the first fruits from among the dead and then on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit poured out it was waved over the people and the trust help is matched back those are the chatter Pentecost was back to original green you could see that authority and the power and the spoken word it was sit right there and the first for church eighties Paul arenas Martin Columba that power was in that church until they went to the ground in a um nice Shack Council and for a thousand years that should was uh and that seed went to sitting again but I will restore it right back and I knew that God said to restore Wesley Pentecost Wesley the Pentecostals until it come to our age Malachi for the profit at the end time here with a promise in this end time here I will come right back a son of man again to reveal all these mysteries and then I'll be ready getting my church right back again to original condition I'm ready to get them right back to adoption charm again get get get them right back to that spoken word authority and power so acquainted the promise of Scripture we understand is gonna be waived again in the last days Afghanistan looks on in 30 because he said even thou shall he be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed he's gonna be waived revealed to unveil uncover the Misha's of the kingdom of God and all that has gone in the church egg is gonna reveal and waive these things over us to open our understanding to the scriptures and so that we will know all that went on so that we'll know how to get back to our inheritance and he's he he ever promised and Malachi first mean she was a based upon that same looks on in theory Revelation chain he'll return as son of man again just like he came as son of man in his earthly ministry and when he came a son of man he died and rose from the dead son of man when he came a son of man son of man ministry for three and a half years when he rose from the dead resurrected logis transmission is son of man he was there what was he doing he was being waved over the people with over the peoples in Luke 24 then openly they honestl beginning from most all the prophets when all the way down to Genesis what Moses wrote and open expanded their understand of scriptures that's sort of ministry because son of man is the word the son of man is the word the opening of the world that's Son of Man to open the word to you to open the mysteries of the kingdom to you and Jesus Christ he did all of that in the days of his earthly ministry in his resurrected ministry and then he was with over the people by the revealing of the world to them that was the way the way the way he was the revealing in the days when the Son of Man is revealed all waved and so after the waving on the day of miracles the Holy Spirit came upon them and the Christian Church Terry so in this enzyme here if this be the habit age there's gonna be barley harvest which the firstfruits which will be Jesus Christ the Son of man has got to be here again to be weaved the revealing of a son of man the revealing of the words of the Son of Man must take place a game in this age here and then like it happened that time the revealing will be followed by another waving of the Holy Spirit to come upon what has been revealed and there you are gonna have a time of life to whether all of the life of God will go into the seed all of the life will be in the seed and you have people the songs that daughters have got back a kids original condition like Adam wasn't a Garden of Eden or in a condition with a spoken word being the original seed with the life of the Son of God being the original seed with the spoken word life of this original son of God builder Tennessee thus said the Lord keep still hear ye him the his brow was speak and the Lord will be back that's a people back to original condition again even thou shall he be in the day when they sort of manage reveal all waived the revelation of the Son of Man the revealing of the son of man would it is a resin of the zone he was weird day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was worked over the people the Pentecostal people there was opportunity was waiting for the blessing to come and to be waved a game we realized in the last day a courtesan look 7:30 in the Sunday again in the day that the Son of Man will be revealed or waved again all the people the revealing of the son of man is the waving of us on a man is the waving of the firstfruits if the waving of Jesus Christ the world the mysteries of the kingdom of God all of the people they reveal in our wits of the people that's what the Raven is that's what the reveal of the son of man is the revealing of the word the word reveal is that the thought pool the we know the world the thought is a reveal of the slum man the sermon going upwards in ministry to reveal the world to waive the word over the people in both mechanics and dynamics quote the unveiling of God all brother/sister with 29 are you catching it look don't you see it's been it's been well through these edges according to what God said and it will be opened in the last days those seven series will be broke now we are getting to the seven seals here we are coming to understand these revelations of the Son of man did so now we will reveal what would he be revealing is the revelation of the seven seals the seven seals will be the revealing of the ceremony service will be water so now we will reveal and in those seals will be contain all about your Redemption on all about how Adam lost the book all about how the the kinsman redeemer paid the price to get the book back for you and I and how in the a came on the day of Pentecost and had the Christian Troy was rejected and how he must come back I saw a man again the seven seals words or that is what is telling you right here he said the only sea is been veiled through the ages according to what God said and will be open in the last days those seven cells will be broke and the full thing will come into view of the people what - what US took place all along all the way down to Adam the power of the seven angels message all the mysteries of God values all the Old Testament mysteries and the New Testament mysteries when it came here for that sort of man he revealed the missions of the Old Testament what had gone on and then the missions of the future coming 70° when he was shown the dead it the Bible says in Luke 24 that we read then begin a noise and all the prophets he went all the way back down the mysteries of God all the way back down to Adam in the Garden of Eden what happen and losing the book and all of that what Adam lost and the implications of it lost the state of glory and power and rulership and domain authority of the song original son of God he loves that is so dr. Satan in Solarize inheritance and lost in Anna's the Lucifer but Lucifer could not get a wall of the of the authority the the title deed the abstract to the earth you could not get that they went back to God whoever has the abstract has the rulership and torture continued on the face of the earth a loose 5zs water and that's why he hates this message so much because this message expertise that is only his quarter and you and I only need to understand that that Lucifer is a squatter he can't put on film you we can't put a sickness down for the disease calculus same can't put a condemnation can put nothing on you because the son of man set you free and you who the son of man set free is free indeed the son of man died and rose triumphant he went to hell and let captivity captive and gave gifts unto men who cannot be held captive anymore the son of man already broke the back of Lucifer so let's go on with this career he said it will be open in the last days those seven central broke and the full thing will come into view of the people what took place all along here is here it is the hour of the seven angels message all the mysteries of God both the Old Testament mysteries and New Testament mysteries he preached Old Testament mysteries he told them all the way back unto Moses repeating Testament mysteries the future commenced I'm attracted to men say that I the Son of man am there are the Christ the Son of the Living upon this rock I will build my church future common church and the guest version of the bill again see he preached all the mysteries Old Testament mysteries New Testament mysteries even in his resurrection the Son of Man was still there opening the word to them opening their underst turning to the world then open he their understandings in Luke 24 45 that they might understand the scriptures all the mysteries of God thus Old Testament mysteries New Testament mysteries should be made known in that Elijah the sort of man will come into that Elijah with all the mysteries of God with all the revelation of the mysteries of God should middle mean that Elijah in this last hour how that Christ is put out of his church the mysteries of God the mystery of the church and that was all the way back to Adam because the church story the sort of the Chester from Adam Adam was put in the garden but because he he deserved it disobeyed and lost his inheritance then the story continued and the next up was the church who received the word from the second Adam and that the first Adam lost this second Adam had it right not like Eve but this but also when the way of Eve but wanna make is that that church stir all the way back them from the Garden of Eden and so the Alveston angels message all the mishegoss menu in the Elijah how the Christ province church I was rejected by Adam and I was rejected it after the church at Pentecost all the way down to Nicaea council how they rejected him that was the son of God in the church the son of man had come and the poor discreet honor waved the water on them it's undermines the world and with the speedo condom and that gave back to the Son of God in the Christian Church and that was still him but then a nasiha council he was rejected and the seed went to the ground these are all the things that are contained in the 7 CS the mysteries of God the 7 seals were broke these are all the mysteries that contain the seven seals like Jesus himself preached the seven seas in Matthew 24 the Son of Man revealing the seven seals and and it kept quite on the seventh seal of that day and hour knoweth no man but what is there for so that your Lord would not come in the way you are not watching but know that if the woman of the house would have known the in what day is Master calm you would have watched and his house that has not be broken up into so the seven seals was what Jesus preached the seven seas is the son of man's message the seventh season of man's message amen the Seventh Seal is a sort of men's message and so going over the quote he said how are the other seven angels message all the missions of God should be made known in that Elijah and his last hour how that Christ is put out of his church that's right the son of God kicked out of the church and how he is revealed as a man again because when he is Church the son of God is kicked out for him too for you to get the Son of God back in the church you have got to get the son of man back in the church first you cannot just get Son of God back again you have got to get the Son of God back in a me son of man back in the church to reveal the mysteries of all that has happened just like you could not just get back and get the bride of pentacles back to that's what can life that he had without the Son of Man there so the son of man had to come back and Malachi for his explanation issue is billing to where there is in to let you see why she looks I mean theory has to happen he's letting you understand and see all of that why st. Luke's son in theory had to happen so um how his reveal as son of man again and when his resort manager which is Sampson in theory all of these things are what the seven seals reveal to us and then how that the church is to be put in order shut or the life or the whole order the order of God in the life of these people that's built not to the spoken word life the life of Christ is life in mechanics the legal what do what you have to do do what you need to do be a Christian live like a Christian amen the life of God everything in order because Chuck order is not sit down jump up whatever is the order of the coming of the Lord in the life of the people because that's an order to the coming of Lord the Lord Himself first the Lord shall descend from heaven they shout the dead in Christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them that's an order to everything got doors and to go in the rapture there's an order to it and he's saying like that this father here is son of man comes is word over the people the Holy Spirit comes and annoys the water the sooner manners are spoken and that gives back to the Son of God in the church but when the Son of God was kicked out how you gonna get the Son of God again you have to come back as soon a man and that's where we come back to our mission looks on in 30 so how does it charge to be put in order and everything for the last day no creed no denomination just absolutely the world living in the individual H I'll take one and live one I'll take this and leave that one there's no strings no denominations no bunnies or nothing is the heart with God and him alone just absolutely the word living in the individual so this is the message of the seven seals like I said above here the seven seals will be broke and in this year explain to us how the sort of man needs to be refilled again and that's what bombs expend when we understand that in the last days st. Luke's immunity the Son of Man is to be waived all reveal over the people again so you understand Malachi first machine was standing just like Jesus - it is time to look all the way back down and all the mysteries of God will be made known in that Elijah to go all the way back down to the Garden of Eden like Jesus did all the way back unto Moses and took all those pieces and screwed them all open to him plus all the future missions over seven church it is just by the son of man did in eight days of his earthly ministry and packaged all that together into a message called the seven seals of redemption and waving over the people or reveal it to the people and when that is done when that is done then you are gonna have a people a bright on the face of the earth that's gonna be you know you know at the Spirit of God is gonna wave over them again the power of the Living God by Dynamix and then you are gonna have another day of Pentecost that's the seven seals so Jesus Christ came right back in idea he was king the son of God but he came right back in after here in Luther is said to restore right back Luther Wesley Pentecostals but I will restructure I will show you all right but all I'll restore back and in Melaka for here he was son of man right back again I know the people who have issues brother Branham and all of that and things like that we are not talking for those people because if you ever have an inkling of this best yet note you will be like well easily if we or an angel from heaven to say and all that gospel on to you let that even we let us be opposed become see another thing because once you ever on the stand I just open the understanding ones who ever understand this message here understand the purpose over several cells of redemption there's no terrible English learning an equation that can turn you away from it because you see the picture of the gospel or Redemption so clearly so the son of man will reveal today is messing with the message of a services and ramps up this other services is at that direct cognition that's what I came to this earth yet to do to open those services and those Salinger's cut him up and said both observable and revealed the mystery open up the mystery of the seven seals and that revelation was compassion all the missions of the Old Testament all the way back down to Moses all the way back down to the cattle hidden why Adam lost and all the way back down to the man how the mana goddess spoken the Elohim the spoken word the logos the life of the Son of God the war in heaven those were all the mysteries of redemption have got plenty before the foundation of the world those were all the missions of attention that's parted in the seven seals and the same man came to William Branham with this message here that's what Adam lost in the Garden of Eden and prepackaged it as the revelation of the seven seals is the services of redemption friends this gospel is based upon attention establish on retention redemption to go back to original green agin redemption to go back to the story of life then we'll go back to power to Authority to demons being cast out right now we pray for the sick sometimes the gag heels sometimes they don't but well that Brad gets back to original condition again gets back to the spoken word power and life all these run around for signs and wonders you are gonna find a bride that's leaving unpacked reflection against the Word made flesh in the bride she will speak and our world will be back but right now we pray for the sick we cast out Devils that's our commission we don't back off from it but we know beyond that we have a promise it's not this snow small things we want in such a flow and that are promised rivers of living waters rivers of virtuous full impact of this bride that's the revolution that's the message that's the son of man is a mystery that's this old man's measure that's the mission of the seven seals that's what he was he went over us by his measures over seven seas under seven thunders and that's what he packagers that's what the seven seas represent that's what this gospel represents the seven six seven seas our Redemption she one two three four five six seven and under the seven seals were seven on releases on the backside he plays them under the Seventh Seal under the seventh written seal so we have not fourteen seals no four seven series of redemption it's all about our attention to go back to the Garden of Eden to go back to Authority supreme control on the face of the earth to go back to demons backing off to go back to the devil shaking and screaming the trends of the sons of God sons of God are coming back we're right back on the way and thank God he sent a prophet thank God for that we'd like you to build Malachi for sure Jesus Christ he Malachi for Elijah where the Christ over us as his message of the seven seals and the seven thunders the seven seals of redemption it didn't send like same sign seven wonders like Jesus ah so he knows doubt to you that it was the same son of man exactly same sort of men over and over BAM said is that this is the same sort of man but even if they said we saw that we saw that that this was the same son of man the same life same ministry same works not for so so that there will be the Son of God back in the church so that the life of the Son of God hath spoken we're going to the bath son of God is the life of the son of god which is the spoken word life of the son of God that's what we are looking for we are the body sort of go back in the church that's why son of man calm so that the son of God will be back in the church because a set of man waves do what over you and then the spirit comes upon the world to unmask it and after will come to water God and I will come a ride with a spoken warden life of the Son of God with supreme power to that the minimum control that's we open wound the ends of the world has come so with the same life signs and wonders William Branham waved I revealed the Son of God revealed the Son of Man the revealing of this one evil exhaust shall he be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed the same life a minister exactly as Jesus Christ the worksheet himsel demonstrated proven to us was the same Jesus Christ the same Jesus Christ exactly doing this waving and this waving was a seven seals of redemption that he would do burrows and the seven seals what was in it asteroid but let me just sum it up Azzam are running down to close the message of a seven seas that was with over us by the son of man who will embark is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the firstfruits of the resurrection the work shift because he is the seals but mom said he is those seals on the rising of the Sun is said he's the one who opened their seals he's the seals for the will of God is Christ and though the seven seas all about the mysteries of God of the Old Testament or the New Testament all the way back to Adam but not to the matter before the fashion of the wall all the way to the future is the New Jerusalem all the way publicly challenged in the future the mystery of God that's what's contained in seven seals the miche's of the Old Testament and the New Testament grass was contained in the are in the seventh years of redemption he is those so the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the series doors open what is the open of the seals reveal in Christ revealing this one man that's the whole purpose of the seals so with seven seals book the seven seals crew was it about the seven seals book the seven seals message this evolution scroll is the title determines inheritance that's what Adam lost the inheritance would be a son of God just exactly like Adam was exactly like Jesus was in the seven seals cruel in the seven seals message in the seven seals book of redemption is outline the successive steps of how to go back to our inheritance that Adam lost how to obtain that inheritance back the seven seals Cruz shows us how to obtain actual possession of the kingdom the inheritance not just talk about it but actual possession of it and when you have it you can show you have it you are not hoping so you'll know you have it you have the title deed to the earth you have the title deed the dominion over everything on the earth when to me now right now we are reigning life and godliness that's where we are called to do but this is nothing compared to what its gonna be when that's Raven comes over the bride's like it did on the day of Pentecost the 70th scroll shows us how to obtain after opposition of the kingdom the inheritance that Adam lost and has already been purchased for lost bad kinsman-redeemer our boards the Lord Jesus Christ and this possession the seven seals wave chief has revealed that was in work Jesus questions and Gia crisis 7c the son of man the seven seals will ship the son of man will ship the first foods with ship the Bali habits would shield the seven seals with Shem the revealing of the Son of man has already revealed to us it meant that this inheritance is demonstrated by a possession and a manifestation of spoken word power which is the the life of the mature are the son of God that's back in original condition like Adam in the Garden of Eden like Jesus had like the bed of Pentacles had the seven seals screws showed us that that's what it means a meant to be in the harvest that's what it means to have the life of God on the inside of you Malachi for the the prophet Elijah William Branham wait or reveal this successive steps of our Redemption over us in the revealing of the son of man that was his message that was the measure that had the reasoning of the world the food all clean of the word open the watch was born all the way back to Adam to Moses to the manticore going all the way to the future amen the the mysteries of the kingdom of God the rapture the New Jerusalem the wedding supper the New Jerusalem the telling the future open up to us Malacca for waves reveal or wave these successive steps of our Redemption over us in the revealing of the Son of Man the steps are to go back to our inheritance the original which is the original glory of the Son of God like Adam had like Jesus demonstrated the second our Malaka for revealed this successive steps to us success as a comeback step-by-step by real true religious cash real true reverse and kitchen real true revealed part of the Holy Ghost that sensation amen and then that's where Perico stops and then after the baptism three days later on truly adoption and even many don't understand that there is the promise of dynamics which is the term life so why was worth over us all of these things I'm saying but put it together what was worth what the seven seals Sheen what would each service is worth ship with over us the seven seals web ship was the revealing of the son of man anywhere the promises over us the points of adoption perfection the wedding supper the Millennial the new city a wealthy over us he revealed these things to us wave the movers said something very even virtually being the different sort of managed reveal or waived the revealing the waving of the Shadowman the seven seals with sheath oh my as we are fixing the pros here here we are Jesus Christ the seven seals the son of man the original son of God that made it back then heritage that Adam lost in the gunnery married back he said was the first one to come to McCoy so he was pumped from the earth Malachi first they were ready port he has been waived over us by the messier missio malacca for william branham with the same life Sam Sam Sam no no no no doubts at all the same Jesus Christ this was Christ veiled in that friend all the mysteries of God will be made known in thy light it was all the mysteries into himself because the Son of Man was there behind flesh bail because Son of Man Jesus Christ must be here like we said in the Bali harvest and he found William Branham to use his body his flesh body in this valley huh Bashir to wave it before the Lord and for overalls for acceptance our war he was waived is got to come to pass because they're waving the revealing wolf it was well he's got a contract once the happy to waive the the the first fruits before the love for the husband man he was bound to happen with harvest once this mistress the the the the Word of God the Son of man has been whipped over was is got to come the past you are coming forth this brand is coming forth all the attack on the message today it has to be there that was more than I was missing because Jesus Christ look at the column on him push to all of that stuff it was missing from brother bands like she had to come and he's because of all of those things that God is sending some of these temporary cliques that we see on the face of the earth today but that's not for us to focus on right now but we know that Jesus Christ was very in that prophet and revealed the revelation of the Son of Man they what of God the miche's of God the Misses of the Son of God and they cut all the way back to Adam to the man of God adoption perfection everything was revealed and the son of man Jesus Christ well in that prophet to reveal these things to us and Malachi for where'd our this message over us amen were the son of man over us revealed the son of man where did over us initial sign the sign wasn't waived the sure sign that we are going to come for two we're gonna come forth ripen my horse it's sons of God in the stature of Jesus Christ standing there in the stature of a perfect man that's why we want to focus now on making sure our lives what we can do measure up in every aspect with the stature of a prophet man and we are gonna be harvested in the end time by the waving of the dynamics for our mechanics the spirit of the world because one was waved it has got to contrast so just as true as wheat harvest always followed berry harvest Bali harvest Jesus Christ in Malacca for waiving this mysteries around waving the seven seals over Ross waving the wishes of redemption of us women the plan of redemption over us as sure as we'd have this happen with hobbits going to happen here also but the venom did this weaving in mechanics and dynamics because the seven sales with shift the ravine of the son of man was with over us in both mechanics and dynamics just quickly I will write a closed Jesus Christ with the dennah the the with the the Son of man was with over them in both mechanics and dynamics the revolution over seven seals are in Somali 24 Jesus revealing the seven seals in Saint Matthew r24 to them and then Jesus like we said over and over Jesus the Son of man revealing to them all the missions of the kingdom or the mission of the Old Testament in his earthly ministry in his ministry after his resurrection when all the way back down to Moses Jesus revealing to them all the mysteries of the New Testament church upon this rock I build my church and all of that he was waving the seven seals over them in mechanic's the revealing of the world it was waving the what over them his for the resurrection is all of that the waving in mechanics was the first wave him and then on the day of Pentecost was the second waving when the Spirit came back to wave him all over the people again but this happened spirit from because the sweet has got to be this back to the world to make down what common like that's what is contained in the seventh series of redemption the waiting was done in both mechanics and dynamics and that's why melaka for left is bad a promise of dynamics also it's not just wood woodworkers there'll be a spirit to fire the world right now he said we have the mechanics at the dynamics because that makes is a spirit and before you can get anything done at all you have got to have the spirit there but we are talking about a definite from is all dynamics to where the breath of jesus christ like the church on the day of pentecost will have the street of god weight over them in dynamics to anoint the word that they are received from the seven seas of redemption and there will be an outpouring and there'll be do the word were also and knowing them into the flesh they will become the word made flesh oh my so just like jesus with this are what over the early bride are in mechanics and dynamics in the same manner melaka for also not only preached the world you also demonstrate the power manifested that word with such awesome Authority and that authority displayed our loss inheritance in I eternal life and what was the display or is expressed by spoke over piety was this was a song that was back to that spoken what being the original is listen that was back to the life of the spoken word the life of the original Son of God the spoken word life of the Son of God that was then let there be and there was let there be and there was the son of God that talked and galaxies come into existence the spoken word of God then that life Malik Kafur demonstrated that a man last spoke about life he left us five examples of spoken what karna thority re-write son go back and shine for days and little fish I give you a life and and and all of those examples that that or spoke about panel through that what the machine is like though this son that was back back to original a grin again proving it was the same Jesus Christ that was with over us as a seven series with shape the message of redemption that the son of man amen came back in this age here with Amen he said on the undertones at any time in the very day that the Son of Man is revealed relation to one who said read when you get home though the Son of Man Jesus Christ coming right back and he found nobody to use to Valen but William Branham to come back to flesh of the mystery of redemption in first shall it be I mean there isn't any but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of gosh we finished by the time this takes place here the May seventh Messiah is on the face of the earth and the ASA reading mysteries is finished then it goes to the backside seals to put all together and put the boxes underneath the seven regions here too the word the son of man's message to be revealed or weaved over his people in the very day that the sort of manager of eruption someone is a really when you get home the seven angels message open up this is what is it now the angel is a sort of man the seventh angel but the messenger the seventh angel is revealing the Son of Man can you get it separated now that's right seems to be so hard for you see not the son of man himself not Jesus himself not Jesus skin but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the Son of Man because it has let the shocks you're talking about the life has led the shock and card that in the son of man very William Branham does his song that has come back to all of the life in the seed all of the life of the world has come right back in this son and he's backed origin again again all of the life this was a son in a time of life amen he can organize is the grain itself again the son of man William Branham the grain itself again oh the ravine of the son of man back to original green again as an Eden the Word made flesh a possession and a manifestation or spoken word power and authority the spoken word the original seed now quickly about this in a man mister no man there have been three days of the Son of Man throughout history all scriptures and all history I Jesus himself made allusions to in the days of Abraham when Elohim came down to Abraham fill behind human skin of Abraham in Genesis 18 secondly in the days of our Lord on earthly ministry the Son of Man was there also when he came down himself the Word made flesh when he came to Abraham he put on human skin and candelabrum Jesus referred to it as the day as one of the days of a Son of Man the number three in our day are constants only 31 days no man has been here veil behind the human skin of William Branham as in Genesis 18 Jesus skin as needed of a lot earthly ministry but as in Genesis 18 when he came down to Abraham and the son of man was revealed to Abraham in his day when Elohim himself came down in human flesh and with the promises over him in mechanics with the promise of a short-timer life with a promise of dynamics to come upon the promise that he has revealed to him there was gonna be with the Tommies over him and there's gonna be another wavin by the spirit the Spirit of God did the woman through the church Edge's the speed of God always does the women because it not only comes in by the Holy Spirit with the landing of his word he also comes in with the Holy Spirit but the manifestation of his word so the whole street does do does the does the the the waving mechanics and dynamics brother son of Mallory to Abram in his day Elohim came in right down sir men revealed himself to Abram in very inhuman scheme but Abram recognized Abram recognized Lord did not recognize my Abram recognize this is called veil in human skin not the man is God but God fell in human skin God borrowing the skin of them of man to do his work that's where we are going to become the Word made flesh Jesus skin God was the speed on the inside but the flesh was Jesus his earthly name was Jesus his earthly name was Jesus but God was the spirit on the inside of him so in it came to Abraham and waive the promise over him reveal the promises to him over all the promised son he was gonna have a son and with a promise I will return to you according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a baby there's gonna be a son there when the Son of Man comes on the scene he always comes in human skin is always the what made flesh and there's always a promise the Sun there's always the promise that the Son of God will be made manifest in your flesh always there you always see that there the promise of adoption is always there so Abraham receive the mechanics with a promise or dynamics the Elohim will return is second time but in spirit from Z I will return on to the occurrence time of life it wouldn't be Elohim coming again in flesh it will be by the spirit to wave over him like he did on the day of Pentecost and Sarah will give birth to a child a promise on Jesus Christ in the days of his earthly ministry same thing happened after his resurrection with over them mechanics mechanics mechanics and said he's explained for you are going away when he went away on the 50th day down came the spirit he returned again is that our comic King unto you I will not leave Italy I will come back it came back again to them on the day of Pentecost to anoint the promises in their soul and I came the Son of God like Isaac the son of God in the Christian Church but what was it it was the Word made flesh the word was living in their flesh to this Sodom and to notice that they had been with Jesus Christ and likewise the same sort of man as we turn to us in this data condors the looks of 9:30 and he has hidden cell behind the human flesh veil of William Branham and has been world over us as a seven seals which shift the revealing of the Son of Man in both mechanics and dynamics he has been with others as the seven seasons work shift in the form of Bible promises with the promise of a time of life a promise of a second woven with a promise of the dynamics one the horsemen were should over this bride in dynamics for a manifestation of every promise word that she received in the waving of the truck of the seven seals will shift the seven situation reveal promises rules or adoption perfection the birth of the oldest priests and education limits and we are promised a time of life when all of the life of God will depart upon all all the light in the seat has been brought in to us with the revealing of the worth of a certain man but without the spirit that would we'll just lay dormant there so the Holy Spirit same way as come back to us in the revealing of the Son of man in the window the seven series which she with a promise of the time of life a second waving when the Holy Spirit will come right back and ship over this bride in dynamics for a manifestation of every promised word that she received in the waving of the seven seas worship unlike unlike Abraham excuse me like Abraham and Sarah this manifestation will give birth to the promised son of God with the same life same power same authority as Adam poses and demonstrated as Jesus pushes at the machine as the early practices and the machinery and as Malachi flow in this eight-year process and the Messiah as the Son another firstfruits to palm to perfection to make it back to original clean to make it back to the carnival and he said is to ritual Eden has already begun the seven seals with sheep has been whipped over was in boat mechanics and dynamics by the son of man fell behind the flesh veil of William Branham with a promise that the son of man that was failed that was with other seven sins which she will return unto this bride by His Holy Spirit one in freshman again by his Holy Spirit in dynamics a promise of dynamics of the Holy Spirit in the term of life to pack all of the life of the speaking tours to correct all of them life in the love that's right in us for the promised son to be born the egg of God amen meeting the Spirit of God the Word of God the Son of God the Son of God will be manifested in your flesh oh my the time of life is a short time of life a short time set aside in which season with harvest season at the same time here and we are looking for it where all of the life of the seed or the life the dynamics will be whipped over that seed in you he has worried over us mechanics but he is coming a time of life when all the life of the Spirit will be whipped over you in dynamics and will and knowing that sidon you the fullness of the words you are ready now the fullness of the Spirit 28 and africanus son of God your Isaac under manifest in your flesh you get back to original and green again and together the fullness of the spirit dynamics and the fulness of the word in you the mechanics were good together on this ride as the fullness of the life of the original seed the Son of God the life of the original seed expressing together expressed together and coming forth as the spoken word the original seed and you will become mature ripen or regional seed great sons of God with the possession and a manifestation of spoken word power that sin inheritance in life that Adam lost sons of God coming back with the fullness of the power and authority of the Living God in the living church how does telling wheat harvest at the end of ladies here and gather into God's gana into God's household into God's amen home in the rapture in the skies the resurrection will bring them all and together we shall go into God's Danna the same gana Adam had the same gana Jesus had the same gonna the eligibles are the same Canada málaga for was gathered into the spoken word means original see the seven cents worth shift will make this come to pass because the promise is there it has been spoken and socially be and as sure as what it was waived when it was revealed it has got to come apart just as sure as wheat harvest will always follow Bali harvesting the seven seals will shift
