us in a special way and speak to our hearts and transform our lives we wait on you father we thank you for your presence we thank you for this glorious convention that just passed lord we thank you for all the ministers all the greeters all the testimonies all the specials all the songs all the singing we thank you lord the brothers made sacrifice to take time off to send a message that will bless your people everywhere and we thank you for that father may you honor their faith bless them and their family reward them richly father with your love grace mercy forgive their past and bless

that bomb you freedom father those that need to hear from heaven may they hear direct from heaven father oh god we need to hear from you this morning have your way i pray in jesus name i ask amen god bless you have your seats amen we are so grateful to god to be here today and uh we thank god for the convention and i think we get some real uh positive feedbacks and someone told me this was the greatest convention we've ever had so it's quite an experience and as encouraged by the kangaroo's words he told me it blew him all the water he didn't expect his virtual convention and to see when it come in reality they come into the service and experience it i really want to salute in particular berna gideon here who was the project manager of this whole thing um we certainly appreciate him and he had that sharp feel to get the user experience to get what the people would be seeing and so on so he had that eye for that also about ian paul francis and brother anthony brother anthony ryan and also supporting brother nicholas and of course brother isaac the whole team that was there we certainly appreciate what what the time off and so on and to give you an idea you here had nine services but the reality was 20 something services because all had was to be done in french and spanish then uploaded and then streamed so all being streamed at the same time french spanish english so all that was done and that is what we have by gospel so we are grateful to god um we try to do our best because we see this kingdom this this kingdom i don't see i mean i remember the early years of my ministry when i got invites to go outside i didn't want to go i didn't want to go i felt that as a pastor staying with the home stay with the sheep and then the lord spoke to me you are going in the body for the body by the body and then i understand the body of christ which is a universal body it's not just this church here it's it's a universal body and that blood could flow through any part of that body that's the body of christ and when you begin to see the kingdom for what it really is your whole view of church and church life comes different so i see myself as a worker in this kingdom of god i want to say it again the kingdom of god that's why in october i believe was 2012. i was preaching in new york i said i'm not here to represent trinidad i'm not here to represent my church i'm here to represent the kingdom of the most high god and this is what god told me to say to them what i am representing and this is what all of us must represent that all of us supposed to represent god's kingdom and if you are part of that kingdom and you represent that kingdom you will get the support of that kingdom because that kingdom have a king that's why it's called a kingdom hallelujah we become his domain that he rules so just as but isaac preached so masterfully about the jurisdiction in heaven and on earth god's judicial earth is through his kingdom people because he's the god of heaven so he have to have people that he could sit on anoint and that's why he could tell samuel i found a better man saul messed up i found a better man quoted house at jesse and loit as one of the sons of jesse because i find a better man to replace that king called saul a man i could anoint a man that i can inspire a man that i could work with this is what god want from you he wanted you a woman he could anoint a man he couldn't anoint a daughter a son a husband and wife he can anoint for his purpose and his willingness plan make yourself available hallelujah hallelujah you get protected in this kingdom you get fed in this kingdom you get strength in this kingdom david said i was young now i'm all i've never seen a righteous forsaken or a seed-backed bread you don't beg bread in this kingdom god does make a way for you in this kingdom oh glory to god know oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in this kingdom the lord is your shepherd you shall not want he will bring you beside the still waters and restore your soul so this morning we want to go into the wood and uh let's all stand i have just two scriptures to read this morning luke chapter one we want to read from verse 26 to 35 and john chapter 20. we want to read from verse 19 to 22 god bless you and welcome to all those connected to us this morning god bless you i trust that you enjoy the convention and all of you here is something that you have to go back and listen to it is it is too much of food is this forget it you have to go and eat rest go back and eat again hallelujah it's just too much so next year god's willing we have to add a date to that because it's just too much it's too condensed too it's too packed up so we have to think ahead already to see how we're going to give all this food because this is spiritual food in due season this is juicy the food you know hallelujah so reading from luke chapter one we want to read from verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god and the city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin exposed to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin name was mary an angel came unto her and said healed our highly fevered and the lord is with thee blessed the daw among women and when she heard him she was troubled at his sin and cast in her mind what manner of salutation there should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seen i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon me and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which thou shalt be born of thee shall be called the son of god that's in john chapter 20 reading from verse 19. then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus stood in the midst and says unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord and then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me so son are you and when he had said this he breathes on them and says unto them receive e the holy ghost let's pray father we thank you for your word may you come inspired our hearts lord you know what you put upon my heart to share with the people this morning i pray release the unction to speak and the unction to hear granted lord and jesus may ask it amen you will be seated so this morning i have a title the dynamics of that promised wood the dynamics of that promised wood and of an inspiration my word shall not return unto me void that's the experience my word shall not return to me void and that's that inspiration my wish have not written to me void it's on isaiah 56 you know it six eleven seek the lord while he may be found that means they're gonna come out oh you can't find him and call upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and his unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord that's not church now this is the lord and he will have mercy upon him unto our god for he will abundantly pardon for my torture not your torch neither your ways my ways here the lord for the heavens i hide on the earth saw my ways hide and your ways and my torches and your torch here we go for as the rain cometh down and snow from heaven and return it not thither but water at the earth and make it bring forth and bud that it may give sea to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goed forth out of my mouth not every word is important he's making a type as the rain fall gives sea to the sower bread to the eater so shall my word be not just word is where it coming from that go it fought out of my mouth hallelujah that's very important now it shall not return unto me void or empty but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it oh glory to god i feel inspired this morning oh glory to god because this word that you believe this word you're holding on to it cannot come back void [Music] it's impossible for the not to be a bride in trinidad and around the world it is impossible for the power of god not to strike the church that's impossible oh glory it's impossible for the brighton not to have a revival that is impossible because before once god speak it something has to come behind it to make it materialize [Applause] oh glory to god and the devil job is to get you to doubt the seed or to question the word ought to want a better uh uh a horizon a better fitting for the word that is why i like it the word that come out of my mouth no god mouthpiece are his prophets and god only had seven more peace through seven ages not 27 not 14 just seven one two three four five six seven let me count it for you again one two three four five six seven in seven ages he only had seven mouthpiece this god we serve he called them seven stars in his right hand not 27 stars just seven stars in his right hand and we were honored and privileged to be in this day that god sent a prophet named william marion prana a 20th century prophet according to the scripture of malachi 4 behold i sent you elijah and god sent that prophet with a purpose to turn our hearts back to the faith that the fathers had oh glory not to explanation but to a manifestation or glory to god because god's sons was always supposed to be manifested beings that's what identifies as different from others oh glory to god you may be seated oh hallelujah i'm still feasting off that last message jurisdiction on heaven i'm judging on earth and jesus said all power up there and down here is in me and the way i went on to say all that was in god he poured into christ all i was in christ he now pours into the church therefore what you're binding on earth coming in heaven watching loose on earth and loose in heaven praise god we are stepping into a different realm altogether oh hallelujah praise god you know god longing for you to break into this level break into this expectation all glory to god hallelujah you will be seated you can't take the book as a sinner you have to take the book as a son you have to get converted from sin of the son this is not for sinners you know this is for sons sons who know who they are some who know where they come from sons who know where they are going sons who have been placed positionally oh glory to god i love it i love it i love it oh god this mighty cherub this mighty archangel once was in heaven no fallen he is troubled and disturbed by a man walking the earth with power given to him that he can't touch he could only watch other move mountain and until the streams go to the left and go to the right and satan couldn't touch such a man oh glory to god hallelujah a man of god on the earth made in god's image and likeness and you want to tell me if a man like that in god's image and likeness ruled and reigned and dominated the earth if god restores the image and likeness what will happen with sons of god in our last days when god was preparing us for satan's eden god was preparing us for such a time as this this battle is going on right now oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god we are backing this morning between sickness and health between light and darkness or glory to god with your [Music] oh glory listen there's a prophecy hanging over the center the last days they're going to challenge sicknesses do you hear what i'm saying you're going to challenge diseases do you hear why i'm saying you wouldn't accept your condition you wouldn't accept your cancer your tumor your leukemia your diabetes your high blood pressure you will accept none of that [Music] [Applause] it's the devil's right to afflict you with sicknesses and disease it's our right to cast them out i wanna have a bigger show than that i wanna hear a bigger show than that devil to do what he wanna do what we have to do what we have to [Applause] [Music] and do said in my name shall cast out devils it's very interesting something but isaac said in the old testament you'll never hear one devil cast out the closest was david playing the harp to get him spirits of assault for season and after davidson playing after a while his spirit come back on soul so the first power of jesus released upon disciples is power to run devils what is he doing he letting them sons know that them devils could be subject to you the first thing he said in my name they shall cast out devils do i shall come on you sons and daughters the first if not second it's not third it's not fought it's the first they shall cast them out because he don't belong here [Music] oh glory to god hallelujah do you understand maybe seated his realm as an angel was up in heaven but he got boots and the only other place he got kicked out is only earth so he have no domain but the earth was made for sons [Music] [Applause] [Music] when god create everything he said there was nothing like him he said i want somebody like me on the earth let us make man in our own image and let them have dominion and god put spirit man on the earth and the devil couldn't touch him just watch him a son in position hallelujah a perfect man a son from god hallelujah but we know this story i hope and that somebody are repeating and it's a good repeat in any case oh glory to god but the devil when he saw adam he wonder how to get to his man i don't know how long it could be two years three years i don't know what time was unfolding that time a long time adam's spirit moving was a dust [Music] put that spirit man dust man man become a living soul i don't walk in now because he come to physical now he could turn to the ground tend to the garden speak this god gave him some time to know how to work and to work hard too then god bringing wife to him after he could work god gave my sleep and when he came out he said this is woman let's take another man put a label on eve things going good season just watching and observing watching and observing boy things looking different then he saw an opening when adam went to shift a mountain 36 20 degrees to the left in a northeastern position i'm saying a little bit so on a mountain doing so whatever i'm saying everything that will be while adam planting his garden and setting his his garden is right because i'm i want i want this line straighter why are you doing that the devil asking evil who will god has to tell earlier because he don't tell me nothing at all since i get caught things bad and eve in all her naive innocence say tell us we could eat a wally tree in the garden but it's in the midst don't eat for the day we shall die he said no you shall not surely die god knows god knows that tree what that she will do for you it will make you wise so the first offer at the earthly level was wisdom that that come with full knowledge hallelujah to break watch the word now that word don't eat out of that tree is the word from god's mouth that word cap got apple back that that would have a life in it the day you eat that day you die that that is the life of that word you eat you die god can say oh gosh remember the son of evil no no no you eat you die the devil said you shall not surely die she believed that not and she died right away something happened the veil left them the holy veil left them the image left them they come back ordinary a lot of christians they don't understand is the anointing and the grease and the blood is what keep you how you are and anytime you step out the dark you come back ordinary getting slapped up like the devil top up by the devil outside the doctor to get permission to approach you you ain't shouting the house especially in this day because this is the day of restoration shout out restoration god is not replacing you he's restoring you so don't say why me why not you to change you and to change you into what you're supposed to be [Music] let's read you put that little eye detector you try to impersonate the truth but don't inside you know that is you're lying talk about the light detector in the subconscious there's a place called the soul and this intellectual mind does not govern the vibration of the system the mind is only a director it will direct you and it's very it is in incapable of bringing you to god your mind cannot know god by your mind or you cannot know god by your mind or intellect it is just one of the resources or the channels that would lead you to it but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul [Applause] [Music] so that is why when samuel went to anoint one of the sons of jesse and the first one come pass he says surely this is he he's tall he's handsome he looks right here degrees and so like that god said no don't watch by your senses however this isn't meant by your heart so it's not what your eyes see and when it all passed through because now he recognized he cannot go by his senses he had to go by the witness of the spirit that there was no witness for all them brothers that passed by and he said you have any more because god can lie if god sent me to anoint one of the sons of jesse it can have nobody with a witness it has to have somebody here to anoint god has sent me here this morning and and there is nobody here to receive the word of god if if god sent us to anoint and speak and prophesy and get delivered there must be somebody inside of here that is ordained for such a time as this and a service like this so they said do you have one more they say yes in the bush he with the sheep he he he obeyed yet he still smelly as ever she says send for him here come david david you have a clue what they set him for and as soon as david made his appearance samuel take the whole corner oil and dump it on a man the man i get baptized in jesus name the man i repent they might do nothing the man just is who he is oh glory god lord i feel like running through that troop it's not what you do is who you are oh god it's not who your mother is it's who you are oh glory to god not what your children do is who you are do you know who you are nor are we the sons of god you got to know who you are david was always a son a predestinated son oh glory to god hallelujah let me be seated here we go ah good and i think i read this last series that i preached dear brother branham what is the difference when jesus breathed on the disciples and said receiving the holy ghost when they had to go into the upper room to tarry it was he said watch uh what was the difference when jesus breathed on them receiver the holy ghost and then when they had to go in the upper monetary he said it was a promise he gave them he breathed upon them his promise so when he said receive the holy ghost they didn't get the holy ghost then what he breathed upon them was what sultan promised so that was a promised word to them [Music] [Applause] receiving your healing receiving the holy ghost receiving your deliverance receiving your breakthrough receive you the fire of god [Music] what is it a promise let's go then they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled and that's the same thing when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled oh glory to god you get prayed for i'm gonna be healed i'm gonna say that oh god you're back hurting your foot your hand whatever but you know god the word is already upon you the breath of god is over you the promises over your life [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh so they were waiting for the promise to be fulfilled breathe upon them what the promise would and then the wait for the dynamics of that promised word to make that word manifest so don't let the devil say you don't have anything [Music] you are pregnant with promise [Music] [Applause] what's the secret the word is in the brain what word the word of promise oh glory to god so you become a target for the enemy because you just don't know who you are you have no manifestation you have no vindication you have no power you have no miracles but you are son of the king your name is on the book and you have received these promises and by these promises according to ii peter you become a partaker of the divine nature of god so this pyramid is being built into you by the word itself what are you saying preacher i am saying the pyramid word is already in you to connect with the germ that's already in you and that seed germ that's in you was now given to you you had that before the foundation of the world that path is what god was thinking in the back part of his mind before it dropping into flesh your flesh hallelujah hallelujah and only the word could bring that thought path into expression so that's why you have to hear the word oh glory to god to bring the german you into our manifestation hallelujah let's continue the holy spirit is an experience of being filled and endued with for service you don't hear much preachers talking about that power for what for service jesus the scripture he read he said as my father sent me the father that sent him went in him [Music] that's why he said when you see me you see the father it is not me that with the words but the father in me he is doing the works what is he saying he said i am the word my father is spirit oh glory to god and when that same spirit comes into you then it will ooze out your flesh to continue the works that jesus did jesus did and continue to do oh give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah we can't say he's the same yesterday in one part he's in every part he doesn't only open the word and open understanding he's manifest that word too oh glory i am going to preach it till i see it all glory to god is not just unfolding word revealed in word nor the mysteries come down as the word as we receive the word you receive the mysteries [Music] [Applause] let me say it again as they receive the word you receive the mysteries jesus told the father when you're praying father they have

hallelujah at least i'm so beautiful jesus so these people he said no i think mary and joseph they forget jesus and they come back looking for him right and they find him just where they left him you see and i think that's a whole lot today they went trying to find where he was at did you know where they found him right where they left him and that is where we would find him that is where the church will find him we won't find him in lectures so here we won't find him in lectures we won't find them in entertainers we won't find them in the way we dress or you know should be going to we'll go back to the day of pentecost you mean that pendigo is still important yeah we know the 120 euro happened again but we have to still go back because that's what the prophet come to do you know to turn us back to the faith of the fathers not to the talk of the fathers you know be fair to the fathers listen jesus those disciples followed jesus for so much years three and a half years and when pressure come they bolt nobody blocking jesus saying yeah take him with jesus today no no no it had no it had no barricade the disciples trying to help jesus him when the corner peter said you one of them no no no no not at all i was not in that service i didn't know what the prisoner and we know this story because they didn't have power for service yet they were given power given power power by association being associated with jesus they got power given to them including judas including judas a devil giving power with the other disciples but paul wasn't resident in them so the power that is promised is resident power artisan will power self-generation power a dynamo or dynamics oh glory to god hallelujah are you with me because the word dynamics come from the word dynamo and the dynamo have to be moving you are not dead anymore you have to have it moving something has to be moving the church has to be on the move your spirit must be on the move there must be something stirring within you and it'll get faster faster faster and then something if you only get started god will do the rest of this dynamo this moving activity oh glory to god god help a dead church hallelujah help us oh glory you can't be in a dead environment you have to be connected to the dynamo before they had all them battery business them long time cars had a big piece of iron in front i know because i had one i had a crank it and here you had a and they pulled on you and you do so when you do so the engine start to kick in there that's a canky mom oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god what you're doing is motion not that's stationary every place you put your foot is you have to go in motion they can't be marching one step one step same place no you've got to be in motion every place you put your foot it's yours you got to move in motion in motion you have to walk around jericho seven times they've got to be in motion when a bit of the shout shout they've got to keep on keeping on until the fire fall until the power come oh they were in the upper room praying in his name they were baptized with the holy ghost and powerful service came know what he did for them that day he can do for you the same i'm so glad that i can say oh glory to god we're talking about real power now power to pray powder repent power say i'm sorry paul to live a holy life power to pray for the sick power to cast out devils power no power no no church member sitting on the church bench give the lord a shout power to overcome power at the press power to sing power to give praises come on now church oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord we have to go back to pentecost hallelujah where he came into the church there is where we find him because there is where the church left him here we go these greeks were not looking for a lecturer on jesus they came to disciples it says we would see jesus they wasn't looking for pulpit clones they were not looking for that they were not looking for entertainers they wanted to see him the prison jesus christ they longed to see him because they had heard of him and faith and my hearing hearing the word and he is the word and they wanted to see jesus no they never said they wanted to hear him i like that they heard about him already they didn't want to hear him on all the mysteries he was revealing they want to see the man who really mystery they want to meet the mystery himself because christ himself is the mystery of god reveal remember the word is the conduct of the spirit so the word gives a channel for the spirit to flow through if there is no word you can't get the spirit to come so he was the living word or the word made flesh so the spirit had the preeminences in him he said i do nothing unless my father show me first so the father himself and i a son always pleases my father and the father already announced this is my son in whom i'm well pleased so there was pleasing on both sides the son was praising the father and the father was very proud and please of his son and that is how the bride has to become all glory to god you please in the father and the father pleased with you and he said one day he will call you a side church if you stay with him he will call you aside and give you a power and give you something that the whole world will know god is with you do i shout in the house you wouldn't have to say nothing it will speak for itself this word can't return void oh god i could see it i could feel it all glory to god this world will be stunned by who god begin to use oh glory to god some broken up ben up hallelujah beat up men oh glory to god in your brokenness huddle in your struggle in your sickness god will do something for you power going to break through in your inner being whatever you believe that yes i do you believe my family going to come in yes i do yes your children can be delivered too i believe that i am they have to be [Music] i'll prove it in a while i'm gonna be seated all right watch [Music] the invitation wasn't here the invite was to see when john i get walks over and this don't disciples come to ask jesus should we are you the one who should be sent for another hi are you the one he said tell john i tell him i am he and him you know he said tell john he blind deaf hearing dumb speaking crippled walking just go tell john that john can read between the lines that is not the work of the pharisees describe and decide you oh glory to god there's some some of them real sad you know tell me these sad ones themselves you see so glory to god the bride is going to be enjoying this thing you know if you feel this bright you have one long face you wrong enough the bride will be walking this line enjoying it you know if you feel the bride will be depressed and frustrated and fed up and can't take it no more i don't know what i would do and i've set up they break down the bride you know [Music] [Applause] [Music] the bride is the elected be called the predestinated the one who gets in the weathering the one who walking up the isles the bride no she's not bridesmaid jesus told them you have not chosen me have chosen you me yes but lord i filthy and no god yes i choose you i will clean you up i can make you whole i go wash it up i could restore you i will give you power i will change you i could transform your life [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right let's continue we will they didn't say the question i'm still reading the question we would like to hear jesus because jesus preaches some deep stuff preaching that no other man speaking it says sir we they want to hear jesus no they wanted to see jesus their purpose of inquiring was to see him are you ready not to have him explained [Music] is this real today with great intellectual messages we can explain it till you can see the picture but that isn't what we are looking for tonight we are not looking for the mechanics we are looking for the dynamics of it [Applause] and i want to nail this down this is what this church is looking for this is what pastor teo is looking for he is not looking for mechanics explainers lecturers mystery teachers and talkers we're not looking for that we're looking for the dynamics of it we had it for 50-plus years i hear you oh glory to god we had it for 50 plus years we're looking for the dynamics of it [Applause] because i need it i don't know about you i need it from me and believe in my family i knew the cast of devils i needed to heal the sick i needed to do what jesus did oh glory to god i need it not want it not wanted i need it to stop like coronavirus to stop cancer not to party with them you know to stop it to arrest it and bind it need it to deal with the world come to the churches needed to deal with the press and the pressure that's going to come upon the bride we need it not want it we need it we have to have it but don't worry the prophet said don't worry it will be there when the power of this church rises oh glory to god hallelujah my god my god this morning i'm in my element this is what i was born for this is what i was raised up for this is what i waited for since 1975 oh glory to god the power to strike the church to preach the gospel with signs with wonders with miracles with power [Applause] [Music] oh glory to god [Music] let me say it good if the mysteries going to bring the power bring on the mysteries with the power if the five-hour service will bring the power we want a five-hour service if a man have that power we want that man [Music] but we want the power [Applause] [Music] if a teacher could teach it down bring him on we wanted i i want that teacher okay if i appreciate that please sit down bring him on i want that preacher but daniel saw a stone cut out not the five word cut it out not nothing that message pope cut it out is what with all the hands of men and it so happened that when sarah had to be transformed along with abraham not just say her alone you know abram had the faith but sarah had the body oh glory to god oh glory to god my god sarah had old body abraham had all body but he had the faith sarah didn't have that faith abraham had the faith for sarah but abraham believed god but when elohim come down seven perfect spirits and say i will return power was coming transformation was coming hallelujah dynamics of the promised world this here [Music] if this don't make you shout i don't know what will all these years all these years people laughing because we're coating laughing because we're repeating what the prophet said little did they know these words came out of the mouth of god and my word from my mouth shall not oh glory to god return unto me fight but i will send fire after it i could send water after it as water come down from heaven and water the seed [Applause] i am convinced there will be signs and wonders and miracles and the i am convinced we are getting started yet [Music] we 40 years plus waiting to get started we are about to get started this is church undercover this is not the church of the book of acts oh you're gonna have another pentecost and no book of acts they write a book of acts they didn't close the door like there was an unlocked dong peter slammed the door he said locked on over look at the lord i shout peter islam opened the door he said we not no no gong we're not under no fear of the jews this is that that the prophet jewish speak of it was fire it was power it was the anointing [Applause] [Music] you see it give me a word preacher he said if that original tree was an orange tree right and the graphene grapefruit and lemon and tangelo and all kind of characters get grafted in the tree you say but when that tree put forth another original brand everybody important not not another branch original until the original brand shall go back to the original word original seed original life hallelujah when that seed put forth another original branch it will be a original fruit and that original fruit is what was manifested after the pentecost when peter spoke and the holy ghost was active now in suns with full sea germ in the body resident in the body what did that pentecost we're going to do that dynamics not talk not more word not more letter but the dynamics of the promised world oh glory to god so isaiah prophesied a virgin shall conceive like i was known by senses because the inspiration coming to this prophet was coming direct by passing the senses dropping into the heart and coming out the mouth if it only gets interpreted senses they get messed up you know you go question how a virginia could conceive but because it dropped from thought into heart then out his mouth that word can return void it's looking funny it's looking wrong it looking like nothing happened for hundreds of years but it's waiting for mary nothing can move till mary come that word lay in dormant dead letter but the word come out of god's mouth a virgin shall conceive that word waiting for mary to be born when mary born the worst had to jump a little bit all glory to god the word can stay quiet because mary now is on the earth to fulfill that word when mary's had to go angels are to escort mary in the spirit realm the catholic demon come and mess up mary with some contrary interpretation mary going to church marrying the gospel mary and a word a virgin shall conceive it wasn't something new to her they were preaching that it was a promised word [Music] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah one day angel gabriel come to me hail mary highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are thou among women oh glory to god how many drop that promise weren't you and you had one question one question i know god said it in isaiah i know god promised it but how shall this be how shall this be i hear about transformation i hear about adoption i hear about the power of the last day church super church super race the headstone but how shall these things be he said the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost they don't like it but it is the holy ghost they don't preach it but as the holy ghost i'm the power of the highest oh glory to god the holy ghost and power holy ghost and power holy ghost and fire they don't want to preach it they don't want to speak it but it's the same holy ghost i feel that holy ghost here this morning do you feel that holy ghost here this morning it's the holy ghost and fire it's the holy ghost and power all glory that god is keeping us alive this morning [Music] holy ghost [Applause] holy ghost holy ghost power of the highest holy ghost and power the eyes what is the angel telling her you have received the promised word but now the dynamics of the promised world will come upon you to manifest or to prove or to confirm or to vindicate the promise that god has made and if god send behold i sent elijah and he shall tell the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers not devil no fallen angel satan and all his angels just stopped that word from coming to pass he said my word that gold in my mouth cannot will not return void or empty you see why the prophet says say what the tips say so every revelation had to be identified by the scriptures and my what has been revealed not only by what have been revealed but by the scriptures because when the angel came to the prophet with the seals he went back in the bible to see if the angels were talking according to the word because if that innocent engine if only would that injure him take a post posted stamp and fly back to where he come from any angel wing or knowings that say any other thing than the scriptures pack him up and send them out i don't care what knowledge in the field you have a way of saying i don't want to see your wings and i want to say a talk let the engine open mount because satan disguise himself as the angel of light but he talks whether to expose him he have unbelief so don't just working like you're flapping you're flapping yes i wait a little talk go sing talk you can sing christian song and still be a devil talk i want to hear where you're talking what coming out your mouth because i know when god speaks it's only the word oh come on now when satan opens his mouth is a bunch of lies but when god speaks is the word and once that come on god's mouth there's going to be revival in this church a holy ghost revival a seventh on the rewriter oh glory to god god can lie i like how you feel the revival not turned by your feelings [Applause] [Music] some people some people feel that they see a certain thing that they want to hear or when they say that then you only would amen so the written see if you say no word if i say that and because this man is the high priest in his district and area and his kingdom he must have come straight to him hill caissons okay first had the biggest bible his bible is cool gold plated his scriptures is not normal print everybody have normal print but kaifa's bible is different his his hat is a little taller than all the rest because he is high priest not low priest high priest so what on his head is real high and he expect messiah to come to him herod get caught napping when them three wise men come screaming where is he born king of the jews no we hear that when we are king and them these they like you're looking for trouble you know because they're going to see yourself as a permanent king like him let me say that where is he getting the jews he you looking for him tell me when you find him god has to get in my dream to get all today you know because if he finally killed him go cabbage descriptions take off and run somebody say karen and you're a christian but you're not stupid you get killed run that'll take years straight out from the until i hear it dead and i know you didn't leave that troll do you think he'd ever play in games odd in moses day when he heard about some star and they seen some deliverer anthem wise man sounds lucifer i said kill every baby i must catch him every meal you must catch him i'm young and used to bed they take boozes and put him on a boat and just steal them so i appreciate that song says genevieve i commit to you i commit to you what they did for moses they commit him to god god you give me this child special child look that is yours i given back to you at moses they push and they push baby moses straight to fear straight into the hands of the enemy camp they mine him they feed him they send the university they educate him they groom him they do everything to him i'll show you what the devil could do do everything to moses to fix him up to be the next pharaoh and moses want to be a mud dubber with his brethren moses a border with all them big little family fell in your wit all them big grapes and all the fine women moses forget all of that and moses say i go and show with them he said bon your pharaoh your son moses no this is my gene here this is my people here this is what i call to hear oh glory to god hallelujah praise god amen moses know by his mother by teachings he is supposed to be the deliverer he's supposed to call it the people and moses know all the word and mother sit down there studying it and my god moses feeling inspired to deliver them and he you make a move he killed one man and when he recognized dumb and dead look around me again moses take off god made a promise told abraham my peoples are jesus in australia's land and with a mighty hand i will bring them out that was the word from god's mouth that word can't return void moses was going to be the mighty hand that god was used to bring the people out now this mighty hand gone on the run this mighty hand take off does god get moses part two moses is second no moses goddard looking for no new moses is he saying moses what moses need is the dynamics of the promised word here made that yet that is why he failed and we will fail meeting the dynamics of the promised word look for it expect it pray for it ask god for it you've got to have it so god let moses out of egypt and moses there with his wife and family settling down for years and god do like nothing happening like god's sleeping because god of a time a tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick oh glory to god can't go and work out timing it has to be the appointed time then people have to cry and ball and groan and travail like all the people not doing now let me say it again those peoples had to cry and groan and bald like all the people not doing now bye bye pressure coming you know if you think pressure you see logan pressure more pressure coming you know people had to cry and grown and then god came down and tell moses moses moses moses moses hallelujah light come down fire and bush you bush that burn and moses is going to be able to see and when they come in the presence of god mostly got to take off your shoes this jurisdiction here is minds you're not on your grounds you're not in your carpet and you're not in your house this is my ground zero i come down because i hear in the cries of my people i come down to deliver them watch this i come now but you go in [Applause] because god has to use a man to accomplish his purpose hallelujah he after he's in the affairs of men when god flirted moses then moses gone back to his wife she said where you're going to pack up one time all the time is bringing in things and no he's packing up he said we should win she started going to egypt what for to take over baron said it like that to take over anybody here in that man's statement if he's a madman newspaper interviewing anything but his job on moses he's totally insane say moses gone looney he said in print he's going to take over egypt that newspaper on that side moses is going long straight down to egypt iran his wife child he go unknown egypt tell pharaoh let my people go no moses know the word they would carry turn void he has to bring them what god tell moses bring them to this mountain go get my return ticket a return ticket means you're going and you're coming back no devil can't kill you out your light you can't get no accident some motorbike jump over and function in the dead that can happen i say that is not happening so forget about that kill your fears today yet i know at all forget that that take another go make a spin somewhere check somebody else oh give the lord a shout you're not going to leave you and get depressed as it was before no no no that died today too oh give the lord a shout out we know the story pharaoh thought moses was joking when moses dropped down the stick they said that's what you're doing we could do that too then drop two sticks turn to snake moses snake is up there soon and that was as the first rounds and moses connected to the voice of god the mouth of god do you think was moses speaking it was god speaking let there be flies hallelujah let there be frogs let there be fleas and moses is only dropping the word oh glory to god bro says and just a little bit of flies and then so much a bounce per inch fly zest take over the place just words from the mouth the creative power and that could be in the bride we have five manifestations to fight for to contend for one of them is spoken with creation one or one is power over the element oh glory to god hallelujah praise god isn't that right hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah the prophet said little fishy you may be seated god tell the prophet you have a resurrection of a small animal he thought what this he thought was that he was talking to that he forget about it he in the boat fishing take out the little fish trees on the ground all of a sudden he's a rumbling of the mountain what is that the dynamics the spirit the power roll off he stand up to his feet speak he's a little fishy i give you back your life in the name of jesus christ and a dead fish turn over and speed off and if god can get power ah a little old fish where's our fish thousands us die and god show and demonstrate if god could put power and bring a fish to life what about your loved ones what about your family what about your back sudden son your mental daughter whatever condition they're in god is able do you believe that [Applause] let me see if i can wrap up here we are looking for the dynamics of it so many we've got the mechanics of religion and the bible so bottle eyes it looks like a great big five coach sitting out there on a track but if you haven't got any steam in it it takes the dynamic to perform with the mechanics and what we need now is to see that this is what we have been taught all these years is it the truth or not i'm still reading it's been explained over and over and over through different seminaries and churches and so forth until we are looking to see who this person is no you say brother branham how would you do it well you know did you notice when they come to a servant of christ who had been trained to know what to do not just say sit down wait now sit down here i'll explain it no he brought them straight to him cause that is what they wanted to see they say we would see jesus oh glory to god hallelujah isn't that right that wasn't the question they wanted to see jesus god had someone standing there philip that could take them to show them to the person of jesus christ now that is what we want to see we want to see the person you say well brother branham we will see him when he comes yes but he promised that he in the person of the holy spirit would come in the last days and would be with us even in us to the end of the world and the things that he did we would do also so this is a little more than talk right this is a little more than explain right the same things he did we would do also oh praise god and notice hebrew state in it he's the same yesterday today and forever and there is only the only one way to know what he is today we find we couldn't find him and find lecturers because we find people who listen we find people who can stand up and explain the word in such a way it is just breathtaking and we find it it's still just a lecture just a lecture it's the mechanics and we find the entertainer who could go through all the action and so forth but that still isn't it that isn't what we are looking for we are looking for the person jesus christ who is the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to god could you take a little more god is here jesus christ is the same yesterday and forever his power is just the same today as it ever was he does not fail he cannot fail he is god he has to remain god says we would see jesus not hear the mechanics but see the dynamics of him so you understand where pastor over coming from now we're not talking about mechanics a nice explanation of vile sees wars mysteries between a woman and the sun and everything else we're not talking about that we talk about the dynamics of him so i'm not talking about the pope i'm not talking about israel god's time peace i'm not talking about those things i'm talking about the dynamics to your mechanics [Music] [Applause] and we call it the dynamics of the promised word oh my god here we go god in this holy ghost dispensation god the father was the word god the son was the word and god the holy ghost is the word it's just three offices and the holy ghost seals you therefore you are sealed by the word oh that's a big one that's a big one because the words that i speak this is jesus talking now they are spirit and they are life so before you are sealed with the spirit you are sealed by the word so when jesus opened the word to them they were sealed receiving the holy ghost they were sealed [Music] they were sealed with the word of promise [Music] [Applause] their wombs were sealed their minds were sealed their heart was sealed they were pregnanted with god they couldn't receive another seed what they had in them was the seed of god now here comes the bread of god in the upper room they had to wait for the prophecy that was hanging over them receiving the holy ghost oh glory to god so jesus told them carrying the city of jerusalem until until until you'll be endued with power from on high not from a fightful minister trying to make an explanation that's not what we talking about power from on high [Music] no i can't do that i ain't make the fifo i can't cancel god fight for ministry ephesians 4 says so the fight for ministry is for the perfecting the saints but the fight for ministry according to what the reveal is the ministry of jesus christ and that is the cap stone coming upon a man that have added them seven things and for them seven things to be proven and vindicated it has to be tested [Applause] and he says satan or lucy he will test them things for you oh devil lord you can't bluff it there'll be no impersonation to the temple we could talk or we talk but we have to walk the talk give the lord a shout out [Applause] my god but over the preaching brutal yeah brutal preaching because the devil not taking no prisoners he come to steal rob and destroy when adam lost his life he lost his inheritance in life then he lost the book and satan had the book temporarily fast to his hands his greasy hands was going to hold it but the greasy hands of unbelievable his hands went back to the hands of the original owner waiting for redemption claims wait is the who is worthy waiting for the royal sea of abraham to come and take that book and revelation 10 said i saw another mighty angel call with a clown descend from heaven with the same book that adam lost is open it's on the earth until the lord i shout i feel strengthened this morning i feel encouraged this morning because the book that i almost lost the book that was unsealed is now open tonight oh glory to god oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah right with me right with me right with me right with me ride with me glory oh glory do you feel the anointing do you do you feel that that is what's going to come inside of you you may be seated this book adam lost this book that was sealed is now on seal every seal towed off because the seventh seal the last seal is what lock up the book say they pull out succeed the books are closed but the angel came with the book open that mean all seals traps was busted open duncan the angel drop it to the hands of the prophet they probably put it on books and tapes and then god john was told go to the angel not go to some man go to the angel i said give me that book that book that i might have that book that was lost that book i was sealed i want it i need to have it because he paid for that for me that is my book i know man book that book belonged to all the sons of god that's the book of authority that's the book of power that's the book that had your name you have to see your name or give the lord a show i want to see my name give me the book [Music] [Applause] [Music] maybe season in the catholic church there's the lock up the bible nobody can read the bible they tie them i have a chance luther got a revelation they just sell it by faith he struggled and opened a big old bible and read it just like my faith and that caused a revolution that shook up europe a thunder hit them because a man saw his name in the book and produced justification don't let no man keep you from themselves don't let their man keep it on the open book no man no bishop man no message man no pope man no fightful man no minister man [Music] maybe season just think about it you could go to any message and read it and eat it listen to any tape and say lord this is mine you had to wait for the pastor to interpret that to you god's speaking directly people you think the god have a kind of funny motherhood god can't talk goku talk french spanish english german god know all the language when peter the holy ghost fell they say oh here we our own tongue they was hearing in their own language so when god talk is an automatic translation oh glory to god you're hearing in your own tongue this is god we talking about do you think god didn't know they're trying to build the tower people to heaven that way he confused them again in other languages god could talk any language and god could talk to you this morning god is talking to you this morning you have a promise you will hear direct from god god is speaking to you this morning oh glory hallelujah glory to god so watch so the holy ghost is the word father is the word the son is the word but the holy ghost is also spirit see you get that now hallelujah so you see the letter why i just love that scripture jesus told them search the scriptures which is the text but in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me what is telling them i am the scriptures made alive or i am the living word of the text that you're reading and when the living word has come you're getting life by living word [Applause] [Music] your care called text when living word is here so when the holy ghost fell on their pentacles peter and all of them they became the living texts remember there was no scripture called the book of peter and the book of paul and corinthians they just got the holy ghost gay were god's text a word made flesh or word manifest [Applause] so now life was coming out of their mouths [Music] to vindicate what they had peter was allowed to meet this man and they get caught beautiful and god allowed him to have no money that day because if he had money he just give him man money normal normal but because when he pushed in his pocket he didn't have anything he's a silver goal i do have but brother what i have what i have not what i think i have not what i imagine i have but what i have i could give rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ a man had to jump and leap and all jerusalem had to talk about that that was the talk of the tongue that went viral that was on facebook that was on twitter that was everywhere a man who was crippled is not walking that gone viral but god has something more to unfold because jesus told him the works that i do shall you do and greater. [Music] so to identify and unveil what greater was god let peter get an invite to come to cornelia's house and god gave cornelius to send her invite for peter this is god working on both sides peter don't want to go gotta drop a vision go cornea is on their expectation he is just he is devout he's a given person a caring person a praying person oh glory to god that's the kind of money is peter just come and start to testify peter air come to try to make no manifestation or do no action he was just talking about jesus and while peter spoke the words the holy ghost the word was a seed but the spirit the dynamics of the promised world was present tense so peter had mechanics and dynamics together working the cornelius didn't have to wait as the word went out the spirit went out and he was filled with the same holy ghost that peter had and corniness wasn't even baptized yet oh get the lord i shout is this real to you this morning [Music] [Applause] so what was he doing imparting eternal life by the word oh glory to god are we going to come back to that yes we will when dynamics the dynamics of the promised word make the word manifest oh glory to god let me drop a bomb on you you say you know what the mechanics of the church is teacher prophet evangelist hallelujah they are god's mechanics and the dynamics is the fire [Music] that light them guys up or give the lord a shout all glory to god so if the fifo ministry is god's mechanics you have to see the working of that mechanics by the dynamics not talk oh glory to god hallelujah give me another word look at philip you're the fightful minister evangelist he's in a convention he's preaching and the dynamics which is the spirit translated him you hear what i said no maxi no taxi no bus he was translated translated taken from one place and appear in another place by the power of the spirit how shall these things be oh glory to god he was sent not he went he was sent to our egyptian who was reading scriptures because philip was the living word the spirit was upon him to interpret the written word he was reading a mystery he wanted to know who that was philip he was the guide because the guide was upon him the guide was in him the spirit was upon him he was sent to unveil or loose or make many says the promise to this man it was done oh glory to god this is the book of acts this is man under god this is man under the spirit of the living god we are going right back to that oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my i want to finish oh glory to god hallelujah so you see every everybody everybody that in our system is in trouble because you have to be free to receive the word without shades over your eye so if i as the pastor give you a blue shade you see everything blue if i give you a yellow glasses you see everything yellow if i give you a pink shade you see everything pink we can't afford that you have to have the word clear no agendas no we just do it so you don't have that this is god here they don't have that god is preached but inside of there i get good bad ugly and different all kind of correct inside idea the holy ghost is poured out on individuals so you don't have to wait for nobody and look around you have to look for your portion [Music] don't look who behind you who in front of you who are praising god that's the business they don't want to praise god that is their business that's not your business mind your own business praise god yourself [Music] [Applause] [Music] my business i come here looking for dynamics of the promised world i'm looking for the party looking for every sick person here in this building right now to leave you healed [Music] [Applause] when them lepers ask jesus fat touch he said go and show yourself to the priest while they were walking they said rishi priests yet while they were walking their skin smooth smooth like baby skin oh glory to god because they were healed by a little obedience a little word no hands laid on them you don't have to have a hand laid on you let god hand come upon you this morning and power hit your jawbone power hit your mouth your heart your back your body oh god your liver your kidneys hot your belly your bloodstream yeah whatever condition your mind your head power hit it oh glory to god oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah glory to god hallelujah could you take some more you say you can't belong to a system and be sealed with the system and the word called this contrary one to another so somebody wronged our system they believe that church alone is the bride that that cannot be enough shaping us that doesn't make sense is it bright update falls update off that's foolishness [Music] the mechanics here we go there are so many people trying to explain the mechanics when they don't know it you ready are you ready you don't have to know the mechanics just the dynamics of it the dynamics is what you want to know i don't need to know about plugs spark plugs the line the connector and this unit and the spark plugs and the engine all i want to know when you turn that key the engine tumble [Music] if the engine can't tumble you might as well ride a bicycle you might as well get a pair of good shoes and start to walk to where you're going because that car are going nowhere i look how nice it is on the inside nice on the outside it ain't going nowhere when you turn the key all the mechanics line up it have to tumble oh bring on the indian tumblers [Music] oh glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is that some people i like to look at your body job with them say about a good body job boy oh good i like the color because that yeah you get a good straightening hair boy oh i like that color never see that blend yet let me go for a spin see boy it's 50 years working on this guy here his original toxin the lights you see this light here i get that direct from england and this bumper here this bumper has shiny shiny shiny from a long time you can't beat that bumper i say let me go now we can't go this whole thing is mechanics nothing's back nothing moving nothing [Music] you know what i'll do after that that's that real nice can take a picture take a picture and walk because if you expect to get a ride home or get right to your destination you're not getting it next mechanic soon friends we can't have that after 50 years we demonstrated oh how nice the church is yesterday pulpit they have a picture here they're too late for that we need to see jesus not pictures not pyramids [Applause] we'll give the lord a show [Music] [Applause] remember the black one we don't need pictures we need to see people healed cancer dissolve humor trimble oh the church was rocking when you hit the top there an anointing hit your back so you're walking here under the anointing that hanging right over there pillar fire in the building that's what you're looking for that is what you want not some man coming to explain what let me be seated i believe this message i received this message and i know this message there's no man to come and teach me something new about this message ein especially says 1975. what can you go tell me the gross on a prophet come on now go make a spin go and play a tape don't keep you here already you're too late for that how much the tribulation will make a speech be played when you press come down you say what she taped then you have no power as i said already if if if the voltage comes on the beaters can we get sting and butt because i think i love the dvd bull the bull the bull you can't mistreat the ball at all enough bull hear me i need message so much ears and he will come along so you keep talking laptop is that they run really fast get out of there or you better have charity you know yeah because that bull was coming for the prophet you know he said i don't mean to disturb you no they're not talk you know that's not just words you know that come from the inner being you know here it is they're not intellect you know the prophet said something came over him you see that something that were we talking about he didn't explain to the bull but you know i'm a son of god i'm a prophet i'm a 20th century prophet nobody believe in that language understand that something that is him something adam had [Applause] [Music] [Applause] come on ride with me ride with me i ain't done yet i ain't finished yet that is the same something adam had he had dominion over every creeping thing all every animal everything [Music] and that prophet came and demonstrated it he said if i had my gun i was going to shoot the bull and pay for it but god makes sure he is vulnerable well that's a big word we don't like to be vulnerable we like to be strong we let the people protected we like to know we have everything our base covered god make sure this base wasn't covered he was exposed he was vulnerable do you want to be vulnerable nobody wants to be vulnerable but god set him up to be vulnerable in order that he could become his strength he could become his protection he god could become his help [Applause] when he said bull i don't mean to they say they go back and lie now that bird said okay and he went back and lied down people understood they both know how to talk back in them i had a privilege to have my granddaughter by me and anna anna just to tell her say what about your um uh a ducky and she'll look around her toys and pick up a ducky i said what i call the mother says she find her ducky says here she know her toys no she can't talk yet but she understands she understands this is a ball there's a rubber ducky she understands that well the bull will understand when we speak with the language of love the bull will understand you can't bluff it [Applause] i hope they shake us today you know not shake you shake us because we have to deal with real things you know goliath was real enough the reason nobody has stepped up because he was really beginner he was really a giant channel he was really invincible until david came in when david came david shape him into size he said uncircumcised then you give us a bullseye target i ain't going to sword but he nice foolishness do you expect david david a good david come with a different tool they might see his head so and see the big big brother he's a target i'll take him his viewpoint is different and our viewpoint have to become different understand what brother isaac preached jurisdiction come the power on earth that satan tried to make a grab for and he had temporarily he lost it he is wounded he's already defeated what he can't handle is us getting back into our position that is the that happened to digest these men these humans oh being given a power and authority so when badabanam came but a man was running everywhere baron was a dangerous man to satan's kingdom you know because he was cast endeavors out one time he called some spirit and he said like a spirit asking for help for another one across there so like high blood pressure spirit here and he calling for other spirits because you don't want to go see ask him for help no you're not seeing that inaudible young people just saying no saying but spirits jumping on them and then you will just take say all the wi-fi represents stand up and bam some power and just slap them out all them demons go in one shot [Applause] casting them up cast them by groups all what diabetes stand up and then afterwards just get out all in spirits [Applause] what does balram do yeah what he says i don't know if what he will do i'm waiting on him you know what i'm waiting on i don't know if you come you know he's not sure he preached the word mechanics he just pushed it without mechanics but i'm waiting you know waiting on you're looking for the spirit the dynamics now all of a sudden he is here now let me backward a little bit when god told brother branham to show billy paul the angel not his brother the only dead and the ram came at night and covered billy paul with a pillow and said you know nobody table that you know what he think of that watch there the angel is there he saw the angel what that he said since that time he always know when the angel come into the building even before braham say he is here soon but he knows so god allowed by the paul to get the experience because billy paul gonna be working with his father the prophet right now notice when he says he is here what he says after that i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god this is putting all them in our kids and bind them up front and say you're not moving until i say so [Applause] these are the angels that fell from heaven these are fallen angels in the realm of sicknesses disease depression and affliction and he is binding them all of them i take every spirit under my control so now they can't move they're waiting to get cast out notice not not escorted out notice not uh you know you leave if you want to no he said in my name [Applause] you saw what say it say don't love you shall what cast out devils cast out means just that hold in my hand and fling them i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you you're throwing them out you're flinging them out you're casting them out get the enemy [Music] [Applause] [Music] satan [Applause] glory glory [Applause] you don't have to know the mechanics just the dynamics of it the dynamics is what you want to know but i'm saying he didn't know it moses he didn't know the mechanics he just know the dynamics that's the way now moses might have known the mechanics but there was nobody else's place to understand about moses then he said he is the dynamics christ who that was a man from america i thought somebody from europe he is the dynamics oh so you mean we have to connect with him oh that's really that's true he christ is the dynamics that's what we say we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him united with us and in his works love gifts as he hands them to us before the wedding supper museum please the dynamics of this church we know it will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while it has some come down to unite with the body hallelujah it's your approach friends the attitude is what it takes and the other order just here tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are and believe that we are in the presence of jesus christ but it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here and so is the dynamics if you can get started god will do the rest and this is where i got the inspiration from the message the dynamics of the promised work hallelujah today we study mechanics until it's all mechanical okay let me back up a little bit our educational system or denominational system has took the place of the holy spirit leading the church our great fine train of ministers and things have taken the place of the all-night prime meetings and the old time we were used to get to god now instead of having preachers we got lecturers men knows the word just as well they can sit there and put it together in such a way that is astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics but that ain't the dynamics now we're talking about truth you know i don't know what force teaches you know man accurate with the word anything and no problem with what they're teaching our preaching but no dynamics that come like samson starts with no power he can't beat nobody he had muscles and things like that and all he could do is then bodybuilders do so pictures just posting something posing there's no good reason to post to get pictures all right watch they know the mechanics but that ain't the dynamics we want the dynamics i don't care about the mechanics i want to know the dynamics that you're talking about no i'm reading what the prophet said i don't know how that car runs out there you've got pistons cylinders i don't know how much pressure to use the only thing i know is the dynamics put it over there drive it that's what we know god made a promise i'll pour my spirit upon flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy how is he gonna do it i can't tell you i just want to know the dynamics of god's system he said that's the main thing that's the what shout out maintain today we study the mechanics until we got it all mechanical what's good is an automobile without something to drive it what good is the lights or fixtures if there's no current to go to it we've got mechanics we've got schools educators man trained man he can stand the pulpit with such manners till he's an eloquent person that still don't bring the power of god where is the power that used to be in the church where is the pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches that's the reason the world is falling apart hallelujah and here we go we see nations breaking israel awakening the signs that this bible foretold for this day nor we see the mechanical taking place no are you ready the spirit the dynamics of that promised word to get into his church and drive them into calvary under unto the rapture that is where i get the title from the dynamics of the promised world before you see the dynamics he said the spirit have to do what drive you to calvary everybody gold got us here nobody is a calorie so and you're going slow you're going so you're going so you're getting feeling let it go this way if you're going to go this way feel it but when that time has come that commented drive you right now with conor vios running in america like if it's just like i don't know rampant some states looking to lock down again yeah stop in the bar stop any fets any party people they're not reading they don't care they don't want there were no masks and they're getting worse it passed 3 million that could take it to 9 million 20 million millions could actually die is something don't happen hallelujah what will drive people to do the right thing what will drive people to come with the liturgy and laziness and sluggishness dynamics is to drive you to calvary why calvary when those greeks act so with jesus what did jesus tell them except a corner wheat fall in the wrong and die it abide alone in other words at calvary is where you see me at calvary is where you get a manifestation i am done he is the dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles prophets teachers and so forth he is the mechanic that works that then he says now watch when he tried this way he feels okay i'll skip that the mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word it's not a seminary that teaches you all the theology in greek but it's the dynamics of the holy ghost that's set there it takes mechanics and dynamics the word and the spirit they are the one that give life it's the dynamics that got into the word he said we got the material and everything else we got the mechanics but where is dynamics that's what we need to move jesus christ in on the scene what's the matter i tell you there is one here today hallelujah called the holy ghost that can touch dynamics he is the dynamics of the mechanics so the dynamics is the holy ghost dynamics is jesus christ oh he's the one to touch oh glory to god it's the word here we go it's the word turn on the light turns on the mechanics and they become dynamics oh glory to god they have the word but the light is what turn it on like a switch the word is there but when the light comes it turn it on hallelujah and turn watch the mechanic become dynamics they are dynamics when the dynamics comes to the mechanics it start the thing and rolling oh praise one the enoch the mechanics he reflected became dynamics and god took him i'm almost finished here right now there have been churches churches brides brides churches and brides but there's got to come one that is the real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it to make that church live and move in the power of the resurrection not the power of argument nobody's like no no nobody power the beat therefore just laugh at that all the people's gonna argue one another that can work the power of the resurrection he said watch until we come to that place what the good does it do to do the cars and so on there's no dynamics that oh my until that church become both with mechanics and dynamics and the spirit of god moved in to do the same things he did oh praise god you can scream you can shout the mechanics with all the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do you any good you're just cranking the pistons it will only work when they come together so one will set still and the other one will go up oh praise go it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with the octane in the gasoline oh glory to god do you believe that national force put israel in our homeland national forest will put the church in the workings of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride all glory the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upwards the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in a place because you recognize a position in a word then she's in christ so god you are here by chance you're not you haven't received the word by chance don't give up now and pack up now that word carry to avoid that word in you cannot go back to god empty that word in you will materialize your healing your deliverance your breakthrough your restoration that word inside of you oh glory to god amen hallelujah so when god dropped that promise on abraham that isaac coming hallelujah and he come down he said the lateran is fixing to fall you held that seat in there long enough believing you're looking for the common sun that real church oh praise god the lattering is coming oh praise god hear this part no what christ found christ find the people couldn't wait that's the matter with the people today they can't wait here this for the real holy spirit to take the church in position so that they make claims that god has not vindicated they have to put tall hats and make themselves fresh caiphus high priest otherwise known as the new modern out of the body fifo you've got to be in the body you have to be placed there and dynamics put you in the body to make you a faithful minister in the body of christ other than that is a fight for me outside the body just doing things and saying things with zero vindication all right they couldn't wait that's the reason the people today they can't wait for the real holy spirit to take the choice in position they got to manufacture something to get more members when christ come to his bride here we go she will be a virgin like mary was for god will not bring christ to the womb of a or prostitute and neither will he bring the bride he can't bring his word through a whole of his word that means you can't have no interpretation you can have no ideas you have to have what the tapes say what the promised words say you have to have what gossip the lord is that is what i have to have inside of you promise after promise after promise i'm done this is the last quote here holy spirit told and pick up the pen on the right right you see in the last days the true bride you're bringing the police will come to the headstone and she will be a super church a super race as she nears him not a normal church the promised world to you is a super church a super race as she near the headstone okay watch day in the bride will be so much like him [Music] you know people's behavior so off you have none with christ day in the bride will be like him that day will be in his very image do you believe that yes someone like mary there but how shall this be no it come in this is in order to be united with him they will be one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this i'm finishing true the members of the bride will be fulfilled what was promised of god to be manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary but the word of promise was he himself to remain manifest god was made manifest he himself here we go ready acted at that time and fulfill his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that brought the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time and the members of the bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head here's the secret the wood is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name and she has dusty as the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass so the bride will have mechanical dynamic yo you speak the word and it quicken son delivered daughter you are free and you speak it the spirit just back it up like that and enforce the word your child have demons and them and they come home but you'd visit them they come home visiting normal normal and all of a sudden god inspired to speak the word and you back the devil right off of them and the seed in them come forward to receive presents because you are now anointed with the spirit oh my the bride has no revival yet there have been no revival there no manifestation of god to stood up right yet we are looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up he will send it he promised it so this is a promised word now i know it's coming because he promised it he will send it and he said what we see happen here should put every soul into action it should make a church that would make a revival in phoenix that people would fly from everywhere from europe to see what's taking place they would say there's a place in arizona called maricopa valley a city called phoenix there is something broke out here until the seven thunders of version 10 that's not even wrote in the bible is being manifested i'm closing final thoughts the devil all these years he no interpretation he know men's idea he know the power when them were trying to imprison it he would say paul i know peter i know he know when somebody blocked him he no one is serious authority and badge of power is upon a man of god or woman or god the devil knows that the devil could recognize that you want to tell me if the church had to come up to super it means that coming back to power and authority is coming back to the open book in your life god fill you with dominion and power over devils over situations over conditions right now things over your head but you're gonna have them under your feet oh give the lord a shout god bless you let's pray heavenly father i pray for your people today that the holy ghost and fire will break upon them in revival in power in the anoint and break every yoke may the holy ghost be loose in their homes run the demons

hallelujah that's what they're looking for do you know that you're under expectation to receive dynamics to your mechanics amen not just the mechanics but the dynamics will make the thing move to make it live and breathe and act oh not the act of the apostles but the act of the holy spirit in the apostles is what healed the sick is what rays are dead it's not cast our devils that's what we're looking for today amen do you believe it do you know it are you an expectation for it oh then say amen to the world hey many many men hallelujah we're inspired today glory to god hallelujah give me
