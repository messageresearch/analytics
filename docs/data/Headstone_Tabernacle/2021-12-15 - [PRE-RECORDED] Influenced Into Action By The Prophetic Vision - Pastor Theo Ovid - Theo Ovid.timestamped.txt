[17:43] had about 50 ministers over there
[17:45] pastors i believe and we had a great
[17:47] time in the lord

[17:51] god's people hungering and twisting for
[17:53] righteousness
[17:55] oh blessed be the name of the lord we'll
[17:57] be hearing more about those meetings
[17:59] but god has been good to us
[18:01] and god has been good to me they gave me
[18:03] the strength and they gave me the grace
[18:06] to be able to amen make these trips and
[18:08] these journeys but
[18:10] i thank god for his love
[18:12] and to think that you know we just have
[18:14] a short space of time
[18:17] to do what we have to do
[18:18] before you know it the years just pass
[18:20] by
[18:22] hallelujah whatever you do
[18:24] what kungs is what you do for the
[18:26] kingdom of god
[18:27] not the house that you build not the car
[18:29] that you drive know what you do for the
[18:32] kingdom
[18:33] of god
[18:34] we went out not to represent trinidad
[18:36] represent this church but to represent
[18:38] the kingdom
[18:40] every christian represents the kingdom
[18:42] of god
[18:43] you represent a higher power a higher
[18:45] authority
[18:47] your anointing and your unction and your
[18:49] authority comes from above
[18:51] it doesn't come from the local church it
[18:53] doesn't come from an elder or a pastor
[18:55] or bishop it comes from above
[18:58] hallelujah praise god you are sons and
[19:00] daughters of the living god
[19:02] it doesn't have a great one among us and
[19:04] a greater one among us it doesn't have
[19:06] that it only have sons and daughters of
[19:08] god
[19:09] a pastor pastor and five people is just
[19:12] as good as a pastor pastor in ten
[19:13] thousand people it's just sons and
[19:16] daughters of god that god put gifts and
[19:18] places and and talents and so forth for
[19:21] his glory and for his honor he know what
[19:23] you could handle he know what you could
[19:25] manage he know what stress you can take
[19:28] and he wouldn't give you more than you
[19:29] can bear that's the god that we serve
[19:32] with every temptation he makes a way of
[19:34] escape he wouldn't leave you just to
[19:36] give up and let go and pack up shop he
[19:38] will always make a way because he has
[19:40] proven himself to be a waymaker where
[19:43] there seems to be no way where you're
[19:45] seeing press pop and you can't have a
[19:47] way to turn you have a way of opening
[19:50] doors
[19:50] that you didn't even know was there
[19:53] sometime in the room or locked up but
[19:55] god slam on the open and when god opened
[19:58] that door for you whatever god opened no
[20:01] man could shut that door
[20:04] glory to god hallelujah
[20:06] maybe this morning
[20:08] god might open a door to good health
[20:11] maybe this morning god could open the
[20:13] door to you for revival
[20:15] maybe this morning god could open the
[20:17] door that you could receive the baptism
[20:20] of holy ghost
[20:21] and your deliverance maybe this morning
[20:24] god could open your prison and you could
[20:26] walk a free man
[20:28] a free woman this morning
[20:30] oh what a mighty god we serve
[20:33] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[20:36] hallelujah
[20:37] hallelujah
[20:39] but for the blood of jesus
[20:41] where would we be without that blood
[20:44] that's why today there is still power in
[20:46] the blood
[20:47] you may not understand all what we
[20:48] preach but there is power in the blood
[20:51] a blood price was paid for your
[20:52] deliverance
[20:54] that's why the devil have no right this
[20:55] morning to hold you back
[20:58] hold you down
[20:59] and cage you did you ever have no right
[21:01] this morning
[21:02] because jesus paid a price
[21:04] that you could soar but you never went
[21:07] before
[21:08] jesus paid a price that you could go
[21:11] free
[21:12] [Applause]
[21:15] you may be seated
[21:16] but the brandon said one of the worst
[21:18] things is to see an eagle caged up
[21:21] you got caves up
[21:23] a bird
[21:24] that was born to soar
[21:26] no limits
[21:28] or how high you could go
[21:30] where you could fly what meat you're
[21:33] going to eat no limits
[21:35] oh hallelujah and some spirit of man
[21:38] come to entrap an eagle
[21:40] how that eagle long sword
[21:46] it's built into flies
[21:48] built into sword
[21:50] built in the press and when you tell a
[21:53] son of god you have to stay in that
[21:55] estate you cannot tell a true son of god
[21:58] that you were built to rise from the
[22:00] ashes
[22:01] you were built to punch back up
[22:04] you were built to raise up
[22:06] from the jaws of defeat
[22:08] to be given victory
[22:10] over the kings of the enemy
[22:12] you will raise up for godzilla
[22:15] and squad glorious good to be here this
[22:17] morning
[22:18] it's good to be in the presence of god
[22:21] it's good to be under the anointing
[22:23] of victory
[22:25] of triumph
[22:27] oh blessed be
[22:30] the name of the lord
[22:32] glory to god amen
[22:34] god bless you may be seated
[22:36] i want to thank brother
[22:37] anthony and brother isaac for holding on
[22:39] and
[22:40] amen preaching the word of god
[22:43] that's what the anointed to do
[22:45] to preach the gospel
[22:47] without compromise
[22:50] hallelujah we are not responsible for
[22:52] what god said we're responsible for
[22:54] giving the message of what he said
[22:57] if you fight with it that's your problem
[22:59] that's not our problem because once god
[23:01] said it got to come to pass
[23:03] god don't raise words
[23:05] god don't waste time god don't play
[23:08] games god don't play politics god said
[23:12] my word is different from every other
[23:14] world my word have a peak a way about it
[23:17] it just cannot return void but it always
[23:21] accomplished the purpose that i said and
[23:23] fought to accomplish and if god sent me
[23:26] in this morning with a word for you that
[23:28] word can't return for it
[23:31] oh glory to god hallelujah
[23:34] glory to god
[23:36] you know what somebody made a statement
[23:38] if you keep speaking the truth every
[23:40] time
[23:41] you wouldn't have to fight up to try to
[23:43] remember what you said last
[23:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah if you keep
[23:48] speaking the truth every time
[23:50] you wouldn't have to fight up with what
[23:52] you try to remember what you told that
[23:54] person the time before because it is not
[23:56] so straight because your life become
[23:58] consistent your life comes you directly
[24:01] with the words from your mouth you see
[24:04] it is powerful to be authentic
[24:06] it is a stress to act to perform to do
[24:10] to impress people you have to make a
[24:12] great effort to do that but when you are
[24:15] you you and you are you when when you
[24:17] know who you are and where you come from
[24:19] you are just who you are
[24:21] you don't take effort to be who you are
[24:23] you you just you just are who you are
[24:26] when you see me you see the father
[24:28] because the father dwelleth in me that's
[24:31] what jesus said hallelujah praise god
[24:34] give lord some praises
[24:37] oh
[24:38] hallelujah
[24:40] glory
[24:41] and the only thing that
[24:43] could return you to that uniqueness is
[24:46] divine revelation
[24:48] and jesus said upon this rock i will
[24:50] build my church
[24:52] the prophet said he don't need man to
[24:53] help him build his church he is the
[24:55] architect
[24:56] he draw the design for it he know where
[24:59] he wants what so stop trying to help god
[25:03] and just move in the spirit the way god
[25:06] wants you to move
[25:07] be free to serve him breathe free to
[25:10] worship you'll have to sit stiff
[25:13] like you belong in some priesthood back
[25:15] there
[25:16] no you don't have to walk like you have
[25:17] some angels wings and some fall off and
[25:20] you're looking to recover here this
[25:22] morning no no he be lit he make himself
[25:25] lower than the angels he became one of
[25:28] us
[25:29] to become like us
[25:31] to feel the way we feel you feel tired
[25:34] you feel weary but he kept pressing on
[25:37] because you know if you only get the
[25:39] calvary
[25:40] we will come true
[25:46] oh
[25:50] oh precious is the flow
[25:52] that mainly white is slow
[25:55] the fountain oh
[25:57] nothing but the blood of jesus

[26:15] but god rich
[26:17] rich in mercy

[26:21] mercy deserve to be condemned
[26:24] deserve to die
[26:26] but god rich
[26:29] in mercy
[26:30] hallelujah
[26:32] for glory hallelujah
[26:34] rich and mercy mercy there was great and
[26:38] grace was free

[26:49] at calvary
[26:54] oh hallelujah
[26:56] mercy there was great and grace was free
[27:00] pad and death was multiplied to me
[27:04] [Applause]

[27:31] foreign
[27:36] hallelujah
[27:39] oh glory
[27:41] how many an expectation this morning
[27:44] [Applause]
[27:48] that god can do more
[27:50] than you could ask
[27:52] or think raise your sight a little
[27:54] higher
[27:55] than where you are raise your faith a
[27:57] little higher

[28:01] a lot and where you are
[28:03] going to bless this morning
[28:05] god want to deliver this morning
[28:07] god want to change this morning
[28:11] i found a powerful statement
[28:14] and i believe it's from franklin d
[28:15] roosevelt that said not everything that
[28:17] is feast
[28:19] can be changed
[28:21] but nothing can be changed
[28:24] until it is faced
[28:26] i cannot like that
[28:29] i want to say it again
[28:31] not everything that is faced
[28:34] can be changed
[28:36] but nothing can be changed
[28:39] until it is faced
[28:41] if you want to change
[28:43] you have to listen
[28:45] confront yourself
[28:50] you know some people like to confront
[28:51] other people
[28:52] that confront this one they're free no
[28:54] confrontation they come from
[28:55] confrontation they love confrontation
[28:57] some people run from confrontation
[28:59] but when are you going to begin to
[29:01] confront
[29:02] yourself
[29:04] where you are
[29:06] the way you operate
[29:09] what you think what you feel
[29:12] where you go
[29:14] why are you saying all this this morning
[29:16] but over i don't know
[29:19] i just have to say what he gave me to
[29:21] say
[29:22] and i just hope it sticks somewhere
[29:25] between the left rib
[29:27] somewhere down here inside your heart
[29:29] but you got to confront yourself some
[29:31] point in time
[29:32] as a husband
[29:34] as a wife
[29:36] as a man as a woman as a sister as a
[29:39] daughter
[29:41] as parents
[29:43] father mother
[29:45] as a believer as a worshiper as a child
[29:47] of god you have got to confront
[29:50] yourself
[29:52] because you're going to find out today
[29:53] god's
[29:55] behavior
[29:56] is his person
[29:59] so that god's
[30:01] behavior is especial not what you say
[30:05] but what you are
[30:07] so on authenticity
[30:09] comes to the point of what you are
[30:11] not what you say you are
[30:13] but what you are
[30:16] and that's what jesus came to do
[30:18] to bring us into a revelation and a
[30:21] recognition of who we are
[30:24] because we lost it amen
[30:26] amen
[30:28] we lost it we lost our dominion we lost
[30:33] our inheritance we lost our position
[30:36] with god we've lost when we look in the
[30:38] mirror we didn't recognize who that was
[30:41] because we lost the vision
[30:43] we lost the purpose and intent of god
[30:46] for what we were born for
[30:48] what we created for but jesus in sins 14
[30:51] 20 said that day you shall know
[30:54] that i am and the father he and me
[30:56] and i knew and paul said we know in part
[30:58] be prophesying part but when that which
[31:00] is perfect is come then that which is
[31:03] part is done already and we shall know
[31:05] as we are known so we're going to know
[31:08] that we don't know just yet but we're
[31:10] going to know something that's so
[31:11] powerful
[31:12] that it will change and revolutionize
[31:14] your life
[31:15] you are dumb because you don't know who
[31:16] you are you are depressed because you
[31:18] don't know who you are you act weak
[31:20] because you don't know where you are but
[31:21] if the weak begin to say i am strong and
[31:24] get the strength of god on the inner man
[31:26] then you begin to see something a little
[31:28] different you stop complaining you stop
[31:31] praising
[31:32] you stop complaining you start
[31:34] worshiping
[31:37] [Applause]
[31:42] we're going to read the scriptures just
[31:43] now
[31:44] but we want to float a little bit
[31:47] i want to feel something like that
[31:50] hallelujah let the probe of the spirit
[31:51] go down to prove our hearts
[31:53] football minds and souls amen
[31:56] it takes effort to act
[31:58] it take effort to be like somebody else
[32:01] but it's natural to be unique and people
[32:03] don't appreciate their uniqueness in god
[32:05] that's why we can't have one cover in
[32:06] one banner one method is one baptist he
[32:08] kind of one church to be under there has
[32:09] to be one holy ghost
[32:12] has to be one kingdom because man are
[32:14] different countries are different
[32:15] cultures different and we are shaped by
[32:17] an environment our culture our country
[32:19] and everything else make us act and
[32:21] behave a certain way but the life gonna
[32:23] be christ
[32:24] in the different countries in the
[32:26] different environment you're gonna be
[32:27] christ one christ there's only one lord
[32:30] you've got ten laws only one lord
[32:32] there's only one baptism and distinct
[32:34] today the sting today is there's only
[32:37] two forces
[32:39] or two influences
[32:41] you don't have three you don't have ten
[32:42] just two
[32:43] i want you to think about that because
[32:44] this is where i'm going today
[32:46] and the title this morning is being
[32:47] influenced
[32:50] hallelujah
[32:52] praise the name
[32:53] by the prophetic vision to get into
[32:55] action
[32:56] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[32:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[33:02] getting into action by the prophetic
[33:04] vision
[33:05] being influenced to get into action by
[33:07] the prophetic vision and that is what
[33:09] has happened to your life you have to be
[33:11] influenced
[33:12] ain't meant to get into action there are
[33:14] only two influences you either influence
[33:16] towards god or away from god
[33:18] some light up something coming to
[33:19] influence your marriage to break it or
[33:21] to heal it
[33:22] you come into church to get closer to
[33:24] god a further from god influence is
[33:25] everywhere
[33:27] it's ever all around us
[33:28] all the advertisements are wrong is to
[33:30] influence us to buy this product or that
[33:32] product they have it on the airwaves
[33:35] they had it on billboards what is that
[33:36] for to influence us
[33:38] to make a choice between coke and pepsi
[33:40] or whatever it is they want to influence
[33:43] us and the devil have his influence
[33:45] and god have his influence god
[33:47] influences his word
[33:49] and that's what he want to bring to you
[33:50] this morning an influence of the word
[33:53] hallelujah and if you have the influence
[33:55] of the word then you have the influence
[33:57] for life
[33:58] oh glory to god so as we want to stand
[34:01] and give god some praises
[34:03] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god
[34:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[34:18] [Music]

[36:07] we want to turn our bibles ezekiel
[36:09] chapter 12
[36:10] 10 from 22
[36:12] to 28
[36:14] also from harbourcot chapter 2 1-3
[36:17] proverbs 28 29-18
[36:27] influence into action
[36:30] by the prophetic vision
[36:35] ezekiel chapter 12
[36:37] reading from verse 22.
[36:40] son of man
[36:42] what is that proverb that you have in
[36:44] the land of israel saying
[36:46] the deeds are prolonged and every vision
[36:49] feel it
[36:51] tell them therefore thus saith the lord
[36:53] god
[36:54] i will make this provoked disease
[36:57] and they shall no more use it as a
[36:58] proverb in israel
[37:00] but say unto them
[37:02] the days at hand
[37:04] and the effect of every vision
[37:06] for there shall be no more any vain
[37:09] vision
[37:10] no flattering divination within
[37:13] the house of israel
[37:16] for i am the lord
[37:18] i will speak
[37:20] and the word that i shall speak shall
[37:22] come to pass
[37:24] it shall be no more prolonged
[37:27] for in your days oh rebellious house
[37:29] will i say the word and will perform it
[37:32] say the lord god
[37:34] again
[37:35] the word of the lord came unto me saying
[37:37] son of man
[37:38] behold day of the house of israel say
[37:42] the vision that he see it is for many
[37:44] days to come
[37:45] and he prophesied of the times
[37:48] that are afar off therefore
[37:51] say unto them
[37:53] thus saith the lord god
[37:55] they shall none of my words be prolonged
[37:56] anymore
[37:58] but the word which i have spoken
[38:00] shall be done
[38:02] saith the lord reading from habakkuk
[38:05] chapter 2
[38:07] reading from verse 1.
[38:11] i will stand upon my watch
[38:13] and set me upon the tower and will watch
[38:16] to see what he will say unto me
[38:18] and what i shall answer when i am
[38:20] reproved
[38:21] and the lord answered me and said
[38:24] write the vision
[38:26] and make it plain upon tables
[38:28] that he
[38:30] may run
[38:31] readed it
[38:33] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[38:35] time
[38:35] but at the end it shall speak
[38:37] and not lie
[38:39] do it tarry wait for it
[38:41] because it will surely come
[38:43] it will not tarry
[38:45] and from proverbs chapter 29
[38:47] reading verse 18
[38:52] where there is no vision
[38:54] the people perish
[38:56] let us pray father we thank you for your
[38:58] word and i pray give us spiritual
[39:00] insight
[39:01] bless the word lord take me out of the
[39:03] way and be glorified in jesus in my
[39:05] asket amen amen you may be seated
[39:24] but abraham
[39:26] our eternal destination is not all
[39:27] together determined by what we see
[39:30] or what we hear
[39:32] it is determined
[39:34] on what diseasement we have
[39:37] of what we see
[39:40] on what we hear amen
[39:42] what a christian looks to is never the
[39:45] scene
[39:46] all our power and strength is unseen
[39:50] that's why we walk not by sight
[39:53] but by faith isn't that right
[39:55] and the prophet said in influence
[39:56] phoenix what we have seen
[39:59] his promises in the last days ought to
[40:01] put each one of us into action
[40:04] you have to see something that will
[40:06] inspire you
[40:08] into action
[40:09] many people sit and hear
[40:12] sit
[40:12] and you know understand but that's more
[40:16] on an intellectual level
[40:18] but what you hear
[40:19] must put you into action
[40:22] so somehow the holy spirit have to
[40:24] translate
[40:25] what you hear
[40:26] into an understanding that is so simple
[40:29] that when you read it you could run
[40:32] because he was told
[40:34] to write the vision
[40:36] and then make it plain
[40:37] it ought not to be complicated it ought
[40:40] not to be that you don't understand the
[40:42] vision
[40:43] because the vision must be made clear
[40:47] must be made clear plain for you to
[40:50] understand it
[40:51] that you could move into action
[40:53] if you don't understand it you would
[40:55] freeze if you understand it you're going
[40:57] to begin to understand the part that you
[40:59] have to play
[41:00] because a minister cannot bring a
[41:02] revival
[41:03] if the people have to bring a revival
[41:05] therefore the understanding has to come
[41:07] to the people so it's not about the
[41:09] minister it's not about the preacher
[41:11] it's about you
[41:13] getting divine revelation to enter into
[41:16] your inheritance
[41:17] oh blessed be the name of the lord do
[41:20] you believe that this morning
[41:22] now watch what we have seen
[41:24] do you know what
[41:25] he said cover yourselves humble
[41:27] yourselves then get into action
[41:30] watch what we have seen happen should
[41:31] put every soul in action it should make
[41:33] a church that would make a revival here
[41:36] in phoenix that people will be flying in
[41:38] from europe to see what's taking place
[41:41] there's a place in arizona called
[41:42] maricopa valley a city called phoenix
[41:45] there was something broke out until the
[41:47] seven thunders of revelation 10 that's
[41:50] not even wrote is being manifested in
[41:52] other words somebody some group
[41:54] somewhere some part of the world will be
[41:57] able to say this day this scripture is
[41:58] fulfilled
[42:00] oh hallelujah the seven thunders is
[42:02] being made manifest
[42:04] you mean that's a promise that's a
[42:06] promise you mean that's a vision that's
[42:08] a vision it's a vision of perfection
[42:10] because you cannot move unless you get
[42:12] revived
[42:14] [Applause]
[42:18] you see if the pipe is dripping you
[42:20] could let it drip yes
[42:24] you don't have to fix it right away if
[42:26] you choose not to it could drip all day
[42:28] and just make noise pip
[42:31] but if the kitchen catch a fire you
[42:33] can't just watch the city's on fire
[42:35] that's a different thing altogether you
[42:37] get into action
[42:39] you see the dripping pipe you're not
[42:40] going to move
[42:42] because that's just drip
[42:43] drip
[42:44] drip but the fire forget it if you don't
[42:46] move your house is gone
[42:50] and that's what we need
[42:52] we need to see
[42:53] fire somebody say fire
[42:56] oh hallelujah
[42:59] but either the fire gonna move all them
[43:01] turtles hiding in their shell they're
[43:03] gonna make the title come out the shell
[43:06] beating them with the stick won't do it

[43:55] rise up
[43:56] hallelujah

[44:19] life this morning

[44:22] amen
[44:24] praise the name of the lord
[44:26] hallelujah praise god
[44:28] so friends this is the time
[44:30] to be influenced by the word that's
[44:32] right to be put into action with
[44:34] reverence
[44:35] and humility
[44:37] isn't that right
[44:38] blessed be the name of the lord and
[44:40] that's why people feel safe hiding in
[44:42] groups
[44:43] they feel they want to take the burden
[44:46] off of their being an individual and put
[44:49] it on the group
[44:51] so therefore you are safe in the group
[44:52] and i belong to this group i'm a

[45:16] what i'm talking about you have been
[45:17] given a name given a part given a role
[45:20] and that part is unique now when you

[46:25] respect me respect me it will live a
[46:27] life
[46:30] and people will respect you
[46:32] because people respect you
[46:34] not for what you're given to but what
[46:36] you stand for
[46:39] come on and see him and
[46:41] glory glory
[46:43] you see when you come to be who you are
[46:45] in god you not you don't cater for the
[46:48] group
[46:49] for the crowd for what the exciting
[46:51] council is saying you don't cater for
[46:54] that you said you have heard in all
[46:55] times hate your enemy and kill and do
[46:58] that but i say unto you love your
[47:00] enemies do good to them that do evil to

[47:22] oh hallelujah
[47:24] do you believe that
[47:26] hallelujah
[47:28] glory to god amen
[47:30] so then when you have to please people
[47:32] you have to find out what they say
[47:34] somebody asks a question you can't
[47:35] answer yet because you want to know what
[47:36] the other saying what are you saying
[47:38] were you seeing we used all right i say
[47:40] the same thing too
[47:43] you have no revelation
[47:46] you have no inspiration
[47:48] it depends upon what the groups say what
[47:50] the
[47:51] feel of saying
[47:52] and jesus had that
[47:54] he said who do men say i am
[47:57] let's hear what the group of men oh they
[47:58] say
[47:59] some say you're this some say that
[48:01] everybody have an interpretation of who
[48:03] i am no church tell me who i am
[48:07] and they look to the left look at the
[48:08] right
[48:09] nobody can help because they didn't know
[48:12] he's a good man
[48:14] he's a powerful man
[48:16] he's a man of god
[48:18] that's what he just wanted to hear
[48:20] everybody knew that
[48:21] but peter said about the christ
[48:23] the son of the living god now the
[48:25] revelation is not what he said
[48:27] but heaven revealed to him
[48:30] and that's why balarama says it will
[48:31] take divine revelation
[48:35] so what people have for these years is a
[48:37] lot of intellectual conceptions but
[48:39] lacking divine revelation because divine
[48:42] revelation take you out a group think
[48:47] divine revelation raise you up into a
[48:50] reconciliation with god as a son
[48:53] [Applause]
[48:56] that means you can stand anywhere any
[48:58] place anytime under any condition you
[49:01] will stand
[49:06] because you are built upon a rock
[49:09] [Applause]
[49:12] i i'm not hearing you
[49:14] in other words if god put you in the
[49:17] fiery furnace you're going to stand if
[49:19] god put you in the lies then you're
[49:21] going to stand if god put your way ever
[49:24] 25 years waiting for isaac you're going
[49:26] to
[49:28] stand all
[49:31] his children have to stand
[49:33] as individuals
[49:35] you can't rely on your mother and your
[49:36] father you can't rely on your brother or
[49:38] your sister you got to rely on the
[49:41] revelation of god come into your soul
[49:44] because what your soul believe what's
[49:46] your fault of faith that's yours
[49:49] your faith in your soul that's yours
[49:52] you can be healed right now as the word
[49:54] is being spoken that is yours

[55:19] i speak
[55:20] what you are
[55:22] coming to
[55:24] authentic you
[55:26] peter
[55:28] peter had to get converted
[55:30] and jesus knew it so he told after they
[55:31] converted strength to bedroom you will
[55:34] deny me because you're human
[55:36] yeah you'll reject me because you're
[55:38] human
[55:39] you'll run away from me because you're
[55:40] human that's the human you
[55:43] but when you get converted
[55:45] that's a power
[55:46] that's not natural
[55:48] that's an inner power
[55:50] that brings out the review
[55:53] so peter as a human run away and deny
[55:55] christ
[55:56] peter as a human wept peter's the human
[55:59] but when he was filled with the holy
[56:01] ghost
[56:02] that changed peter totally
[56:05] completely
[56:06] to the self that god wanted to have
[56:08] at that day you're going to know who is
[56:10] inside of you
[56:12] because god said new heart i'll give you
[56:14] but that's not the end of it it's a new
[56:16] spirit i will give you
[56:18] because i want you to be able to agree
[56:20] with your neighbor at least
[56:21] there are some people so sour
[56:23] they saw with everybody
[56:25] by sight they are sour they walk sour
[56:28] they look sour they talk sour they're
[56:30] just negative you don't want to be
[56:33] around them
[56:34] because they just plain sour
[56:37] if you're joyful they will suffer your
[56:38] joy if they get a chance to they are
[56:40] sours
[56:42] they are grapefruits they are lemons
[56:44] that's the spirit upon them so god shall
[56:47] give you a new heart
[56:48] i have to watch god i'll give you a new
[56:50] spirit so it wouldn't be sours
[56:53] save your source inside of here you need
[56:55] a new spirit
[56:56] because god had put in the holy ghost
[56:58] into sowers
[57:00] hallelujah you have to come out of
[57:02] showers
[57:03] god put in holy ghost and wolf
[57:07] [Applause]
[57:08] hallelujah
[57:10] holy ghost coming on lambs
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:13] and the only way to check out isaiah is
[57:15] to do something to you
[57:18] to see if the lamb coming out or the
[57:20] wolves coming out if the wolf's coming
[57:23] out you have to keep pressing on
[57:26] cause somebody say amen
[57:28] if the lamb come out then you're looking
[57:30] to be anointed
[57:32] come on say amen somebody
[57:34] give the lord a shout
[57:36] that is why it has no bull head in god's
[57:39] kingdom as a woman
[57:46] because woman bullhead is big bullhead
[57:48] in god's sight
[57:53] man i already have his head black
[57:55] already
[57:56] much just to add a woman to that too
[57:58] i just a little too much

[58:17] in themselves
[58:18] um
[58:19] posting themselves anointing one another
[58:21] and so on just to be somebody they want
[58:24] testimonies to come from who they are
[58:27] because they're not even sure who they
[58:28] are so when somebody give a test
[58:29] somebody who you are you are this oh you
[58:31] are that and how you pray here and how
[58:33] you pray and
[58:36] you know i told them in africa
[58:38] this is amazing that brother branham
[58:40] being a prophet
[58:43] light over his bed as a baby
[58:45] all the signs people's prophecy and
[58:47] whatnot that didn't exonerate him

[1:05:12] then you worship him not because they
[1:05:13] get a cow or get land or get house i get
[1:05:16] something you know people fight for so
[1:05:17] much things
[1:05:18] and afterwards they have to leave it all
[1:05:20] back
[1:05:21] with five pieces of land and they're
[1:05:22] going down on it the family they're
[1:05:23] fighting the land and fighting on and
[1:05:25] when they get the land
[1:05:27] they're all
[1:05:31] fighting night for 30 years and after
[1:05:33] all they said this
[1:05:34] this is my land
[1:05:38] can i even walk 100 steps on it
[1:05:42] what a waste of life
[1:05:44] what we fighting for
[1:05:46] what's what you want to achieve
[1:05:48] oh my isaiah was leaner than king uzziah
[1:05:52] until the king got rot he got proud he
[1:05:55] felt he could be a minister he felt he
[1:05:56] could do whatever he wanted to do that's
[1:05:58] what happened when people get arrogant
[1:06:00] when they feel they're so powerful they
[1:06:02] don't care
[1:06:03] they live they act they do whatever they
[1:06:05] feel to do and the king went in there to
[1:06:07] offer sacrifices and the priest tell
[1:06:09] them don't do it don't do it he still
[1:06:11] was angry
[1:06:12] they saw leprosy struck him he died
[1:06:14] leopard that they took him out
[1:06:16] and when isaiah saw his prop collapse
[1:06:19] isaiah went to the temple and a vision
[1:06:21] broke upon him
[1:06:23] he saw the lord high and lifted up
[1:06:26] trail filled the temple
[1:06:29] seraph's flying back and forth
[1:06:31] holy holy lord god almighty the
[1:06:33] worshiping so strong that the post was
[1:06:35] moved
[1:06:37] by the glory and by the worship and the
[1:06:39] atmosphere
[1:06:41] and god was put upon the god was
[1:06:44] teaching isaiah something that six wings
[1:06:47] these creatures two wings that cover
[1:06:49] their face two wings they cover their
[1:06:50] feet and two wings they did fly
[1:06:53] all the wings wasn't the fly
[1:06:55] or every ring had a purpose
[1:06:57] a pair to cover the feet to talk about
[1:06:59] humility isn't that right appear to
[1:07:01] cover the face rather talk about
[1:07:02] humility isn't that right and pray to
[1:07:04] cover their face reference fit humility
[1:07:07] and appear to be in action
[1:07:09] so you could be reverent you could be
[1:07:11] humble but you're dead
[1:07:14] you're not in action you can be crying
[1:07:16] to god crying when you're telling do
[1:07:18] something you're not doing it because
[1:07:19] you're stubborn
[1:07:24] so the gospel effect you can pray plenty
[1:07:26] you like to pray oh let me say it this
[1:07:28] way you like to say words
[1:07:31] to god but i'm not even praying
[1:07:33] praying is getting in tune
[1:07:35] they're all different kind of prayer
[1:07:36] enough supplication you could pray for
[1:07:38] somebody else you could be in
[1:07:39] thanksgiving and worship to god amen
[1:07:42] that's what you start off with thanking
[1:07:43] god and worshiping him
[1:07:44] let him know who he is and you know who
[1:07:46] he is and how he deserves all the glory
[1:07:48] and honor

[1:09:32] notice he didn't see a need for
[1:09:33] convention he's a prayer meeting i'm
[1:09:36] permission you're not looking to man
[1:09:38] you're looking for the minister and
[1:09:39] preached are permitting a good one you
[1:09:41] don't go to a permit with books and
[1:09:42] notes to take notes in the mango and see
[1:09:44] our permission is to talk to
[1:09:46] god amen
[1:09:49] hallelujah you talking to god
[1:09:51] not you hearing what everybody prayed
[1:09:53] and said i'll go pray that too that is
[1:09:54] you

[1:09:57] because god wants to speak to you how
[1:09:59] many believers
[1:10:00] how many people want to speak to you
[1:10:05] watch this
[1:10:06] he said ministers break down a middle
[1:10:08] wall of petition
[1:10:09] church members that will forget the
[1:10:11] differences between the nomination of
[1:10:12] churches church members ministers hold
[1:10:15] to the halls of the altar with one
[1:10:17] accord and pray until
[1:10:20] fire of god
[1:10:22] begins to fall again
[1:10:25] pray
[1:10:26] until
[1:10:27] the fire of god
[1:10:29] begin to fall again
[1:10:33] somebody gonna catch a vision
[1:10:35] somebody will get an inspiration to
[1:10:37] understand the path that they have to
[1:10:39] play
[1:10:40] to see a revival break out
[1:10:42] and fire began to move again because
[1:10:44] fire has already started to move
[1:10:46] that's why we could preach what we
[1:10:47] preach because the fire making us preach
[1:10:50] what we are preaching right now
[1:10:51] because you have got to catch a vision
[1:10:54] that will put you in action
[1:10:56] oh hallelujah could somebody say amen
[1:11:00] so i don't care you can have the
[1:11:01] mightiest preachers
[1:11:03] the very best
[1:11:05] elected teachers
[1:11:07] line them up one by one to minister to
[1:11:09] you
[1:11:10] if you don't get a vision
[1:11:12] then preachers and them just doing just
[1:11:14] that what they're doing for the last 40
[1:11:15] years yes
[1:11:18] just so in seed and whatnot
[1:11:20] but when you are ready
[1:11:22] when you say lord i want a revival
[1:11:24] what a revival does a revival boils the
[1:11:27] trash
[1:11:28] out of the church and the trash out of
[1:11:31] your life
[1:11:33] all what you can't do all what you're
[1:11:34] tolerating all what you're compromising
[1:11:36] right now all that gets flushed out
[1:11:40] it's the same sea
[1:11:41] but guess what it throws the trash on
[1:11:43] the shore because the sea is having a
[1:11:45] revival so when the storm come and it
[1:11:48] whip up the ocean like whip up this is a
[1:11:50] revival taking place it brings a still
[1:11:53] in your heart it brings a stay in your
[1:11:55] spirit it rip out the deadness the
[1:11:57] coldness it takes out the excess flesh
[1:12:00] it could be compared with when the wick
[1:12:02] get moldy and get black you got to cut
[1:12:05] the wick that means trimming your lamps
[1:12:07] afterwards the lamp gets so the
[1:12:09] revival takes a suit out your lamp it
[1:12:12] cut the wick that you get fresh light
[1:12:14] that they could see where you're going
[1:12:17] you need a revival
[1:12:18] we need a revival not want need
[1:12:24] like a car need gas to drive
[1:12:27] the church needs a revival
[1:12:31] like the car need gas to drive
[1:12:34] the church has got to have a revival
[1:12:37] what if we don't preach it what if we
[1:12:39] don't ask for it what if you don't claim
[1:12:41] it
[1:12:42] i want you to leave here claiming it in
[1:12:44] your home claiming it on the street
[1:12:47] claiming it going to school claiming it
[1:12:49] on your job lord i need a revival
[1:12:52] want a revival he said make me a revival
[1:12:56] have revival in me let me be the revival
[1:13:01] then everybody walk into the church here
[1:13:03] let me be a revival and you come here
[1:13:05] under great expectation your spirit
[1:13:07] revives your heart revive you on the
[1:13:09] prayer you're under consecration you're
[1:13:11] under worship you're on the praise
[1:13:13] you're under sanctification you're under
[1:13:14] the blood then something got to take
[1:13:16] place
[1:13:20] those demons affecting your life with
[1:13:21] the backup shop those unclean spirits
[1:13:24] have to sign off
[1:13:27] why because you are now beginning to get
[1:13:29] into action
[1:13:31] once god people begin to get into action
[1:13:33] watch the devil pack up and leave
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:39] hallelujah
[1:13:41] fall without god
[1:13:42] you understanding it will raise up
[1:13:45] watch the stubbornness
[1:13:46] the indifference of men is broke up
[1:13:49] godly fear and brother love takes its
[1:13:51] praise in the human heart
[1:13:53] then it becomes salty then the message
[1:13:56] will have the preeminences in the heart
[1:13:58] it will have influence in the city
[1:14:01] we could scream shout do whatever we
[1:14:03] want it will never influence man
[1:14:05] until they see the life of christ
[1:14:08] being projected in you
[1:14:10] someone who's tend and merciful
[1:14:12] forgiven ready to run the other side of
[1:14:14] the cheek
[1:14:15] or give a second quote
[1:14:17] or go a second mind
[1:14:19] christianity in action
[1:14:21] not just taught from the pulpit but
[1:14:24] acted among the members
[1:14:26] among the pastors that's when you see
[1:14:28] christ living in the church
[1:14:30] oh hallelujah yes christ in action
[1:14:34] not just in teachings people love the
[1:14:37] teachings
[1:14:38] it is intellectually stimulating
[1:14:40] and it stimulates the great matter in
[1:14:42] front or behind the head
[1:14:44] but the action life that's different
[1:14:46] that's applied to christianity
[1:14:50] oh hallelujah
[1:14:52] glory to god they come like you go to
[1:14:54] school you learn knowledge but you have
[1:14:55] to apply the knowledge down apply the
[1:14:57] christianity where you have to love your
[1:14:59] wives where you have to listen carefully
[1:15:01] to your husband
[1:15:03] and talk try to talk the same language
[1:15:04] at least
[1:15:06] that he will understand what you've seen
[1:15:07] and you will understand what he's saying
[1:15:09] and you want to understand what he's
[1:15:11] saying because you were there to be a
[1:15:12] help meet
[1:15:13] not the other way wrong
[1:15:15] amen gone
[1:15:17] that's okay hallelujah it's still the
[1:15:19] truth right
[1:15:20] you see christ living in the church
[1:15:22] decisions are made of brother he said
[1:15:24] before going to calvary the father
[1:15:26] brought his own son into a conference in
[1:15:27] gethsemane while angels taking their
[1:15:30] positions to see
[1:15:32] what the decisions would be
[1:15:34] so jesus was having a conference in the
[1:15:36] garden of gethsemane angels at the
[1:15:38] approach of duty watching to see what
[1:15:39] the son of god will do and see if it is
[1:15:41] possible that this could pass
[1:15:42] nevertheless not my will but die will be
[1:15:44] done he was confronted by decisions and
[1:15:47] that's all our lives will be confronted
[1:15:48] by decisions and choices and based upon
[1:15:51] the choices you will see whole life
[1:15:52] unfold for you
[1:15:53] and jesus took the decision to go to
[1:15:55] calvary it was a hard choice but that's
[1:15:57] what the father presented to him
[1:15:59] a cup of death a bitter cup
[1:16:01] a cup of cruelty whipped beaten
[1:16:03] embarrassed humiliated stripped of his
[1:16:06] clothing but he was going to pay a price
[1:16:08] because he saw people coming forth by
[1:16:10] the power of the blood being released
[1:16:12] because when the blood was shed the
[1:16:13] spirit came out and that spirit was to
[1:16:16] hunt every predestinated seed
[1:16:18] that is why you're here this morning
[1:16:20] because the spirit found you
[1:16:22] go give the lord some praise people
[1:16:25] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:16:27] there are so many people right off this
[1:16:29] one and right off that one because they
[1:16:30] write up in their minds and got their
[1:16:32] write-off notes on god didn't write off
[1:16:34] that one if god was writing off right of
[1:16:36] all of us
[1:16:37] for all i've sinned have come short of
[1:16:38] the glory of god but the bible teaches
[1:16:40] god so loved the world we have to
[1:16:42] stretch
[1:16:48] amen amen
[1:16:49] oh hallelujah are you ready for some
[1:16:51] more
[1:16:52] watch if god acted any one time on a
[1:16:55] certain circumstance and if that same
[1:16:57] circumstance arise again he's got to act
[1:17:00] a second time like he did the first time
[1:17:02] or he's unjust no matter how bad you are
[1:17:04] in sin
[1:17:05] how stupid you may become he has got to
[1:17:08] act to you
[1:17:09] like he did that fallen woman or he
[1:17:11] acted wrong then
[1:17:13] that is and here we go god's behavior is
[1:17:16] his person
[1:17:18] what he is in his behavior declares his
[1:17:21] person
[1:17:22] and that's the way you are in your
[1:17:24] behavior of life tells what you are
[1:17:28] as we went on
[1:17:29] less than two years two days ago the
[1:17:31] methodist people wanted to declare when
[1:17:33] you shout you got it the pedicles don't
[1:17:35] say when you spoke in terms of got it
[1:17:37] the sheikah say when you're shaking got
[1:17:38] it
[1:17:39] watch
[1:17:40] your life declares it
[1:17:43] your person declares what you are
[1:17:47] so it's not when you shout people want
[1:17:49] them simpleton identification when you
[1:17:52] have this when you're on this when you
[1:17:54] believe this and so forth they want that
[1:17:56] but what about when you have the life
[1:17:58] when you can manifest his works when you
[1:18:01] can manifest his presence when you can
[1:18:02] live something that is more important
[1:18:05] but but people it come like if all i do
[1:18:07] is to believe but it has to be more than
[1:18:09] that
[1:18:10] because even the devil believe and
[1:18:11] tremble
[1:18:12] but you have to believe and go on and to
[1:18:14] possess what
[1:18:15] you know is your own
[1:18:17] so a revelation has to come to you as an
[1:18:19] individual because you're kind of
[1:18:21] possesses of the church
[1:18:23] because your name is you
[1:18:25] your inheritance is yours you cannot
[1:18:28] take somebody's heart it's yours
[1:18:31] glory
[1:18:33] look look look
[1:18:34] look at joseph hated by his brothers and
[1:18:37] i said he was set up to be hated his
[1:18:39] father loved him openly
[1:18:40] give him a coat openly loved them openly
[1:18:43] his brothers got a fight with that
[1:18:45] his brothers wasn't feeling that love
[1:18:46] from the father the way joseph was
[1:18:48] feeling it
[1:18:49] plus joseph had dreams
[1:18:50] that's even more complicated so they had
[1:18:53] enough on him to get rid of him they say
[1:18:56] no let me solve a problem get rid of him
[1:18:58] and that's what god wanted
[1:19:03] no you may not think that way
[1:19:05] and you may not like the experience of
[1:19:08] being stripped of being given by your
[1:19:10] family and and separated and so on in
[1:19:12] pain and spending for joseph he's young
[1:19:15] he's in pain
[1:19:16] left to the egyptians to take him over
[1:19:19] isn't that right his father in spain
[1:19:21] because the son he loves is not gone
[1:19:23] and they bring a coat with blood on his
[1:19:25] team like
[1:19:26] somebody kill him and eat him or
[1:19:27] whatever the animal and so on so it's a
[1:19:29] lot of pain
[1:19:30] but god's smiling
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:35] god was not in pain
[1:19:36] god was at last
[1:19:39] at last my son
[1:19:41] is gently
[1:19:43] being guided into his position
[1:19:47] [Applause]
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:48] to be at the right hand of pharaoh
[1:19:51] he doesn't know that yet
[1:19:54] he doesn't understand that yet
[1:19:56] that vision is for a point of time
[1:20:00] the vision i give him is for an
[1:20:01] appointed time
[1:20:02] it got to come to pass because the word
[1:20:05] that i spoke it will not be prolonged it
[1:20:07] will come to pass
[1:20:09] so joseph had the egypt by force
[1:20:12] but was it force or was it a gentle hand
[1:20:15] of jehovah
[1:20:17] using the egyptian past masters
[1:20:19] to bring a son to be positionally placed
[1:20:22] to be ruler
[1:20:25] how they need because joseph is coming
[1:20:28] hallelujah you see when you understand
[1:20:30] that no trial nothing going to stop you
[1:20:35] from confessing romans 8 28.
[1:20:38] for we know
[1:20:40] that all things
[1:20:41] work
[1:20:43] together for
[1:20:44] good to them that love god
[1:20:48] the devil won't be called
[1:20:50] according to his purpose
[1:20:52] joseph is bawling
[1:20:54] joseph is screaming
[1:20:56] joseph is suffering
[1:20:58] but god is smiling because joseph is
[1:21:01] going to come into power
[1:21:03] he has a process to go through
[1:21:05] he has destined to go through he have a
[1:21:08] prison to go into but george is going to
[1:21:10] come true
[1:21:12] because the world can't return fine
[1:21:14] you are going to be adopted
[1:21:17] you are going to be perfected
[1:21:19] you are going to be sealed
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:24] that is according to division
[1:21:27] oh give the lord some praise his people
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:37] look how much he has passed
[1:21:39] at that time the father pay must be
[1:21:41] healed all right joseph pay might be
[1:21:43] healed all right do they have family
[1:21:46] joseph in power
[1:21:47] and the brothers
[1:21:49] famine
[1:21:51] who making that farmer who created the
[1:21:52] famine
[1:21:53] god is arranging everything hallelujah
[1:21:56] because joseph got vision
[1:21:58] of the pharaoh god vision and they say
[1:22:00] send for joseph he going to reveal and
[1:22:03] make known to the king
[1:22:05] the vision
[1:22:06] hallelujah when joseph made the vision
[1:22:08] clear seven years of plenty
[1:22:11] seven years of famine the king said you
[1:22:13] are the man
[1:22:14] to set things in order to put things in
[1:22:17] place for this plague that coming upon
[1:22:19] the land
[1:22:20] so george i was given full authority to
[1:22:22] set the band and set this and said that
[1:22:24] joseph is now in power
[1:22:26] his brothers
[1:22:29] his brothers
[1:22:30] who knew the dream
[1:22:32] about boeing before jesus bowing before
[1:22:35] that chief as it was his brother's no
[1:22:36] coming trips into egypt
[1:22:38] for green
[1:22:39] oh hallelujah
[1:22:42] oh hallelujah
[1:22:44] joseph had every reason without the life
[1:22:47] of christ to put some licks on them
[1:22:49] joseph had every reason with the love of
[1:22:52] christ to give them wood
[1:22:55] deal with them heavy
[1:22:57] but joseph with the life of christ
[1:23:00] sorry he's got to tell them god god send
[1:23:02] me a head
[1:23:07] the trials over now
[1:23:09] destined over now
[1:23:10] the maturity is there the understanding
[1:23:14] is there god sent me ahead to preserve
[1:23:17] life god has sent me ahead that i could
[1:23:20] be lord over you no without me being
[1:23:22] here
[1:23:23] what happened we all perish
[1:23:26] so let's bless the lord all together
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:34] and that is when
[1:23:36] you begin to understand
[1:23:38] whatever plan and purpose for your life
[1:23:42] division didn't mean potiphar wouldn't
[1:23:44] make a move upon joseph division didn't
[1:23:46] mean to even go to prison the vision
[1:23:48] drinking just have to wait for the
[1:23:49] appointed time because joseph told the
[1:23:52] butler when they get promoted remember
[1:23:53] me as soon as butler get his thing to
[1:23:56] serve he forget joseph
[1:23:58] because the time was not yet
[1:24:00] the vision
[1:24:01] is always for
[1:24:03] an appointed time

[1:30:56] bound by your sins make sure your sin
[1:30:58] don't find you wrong that's what we're
[1:31:00] trying to say
[1:31:01] jesus of course they tried to belittle
[1:31:02] him but ram he said no they want to hurt
[1:31:05] your influence before the people that's
[1:31:07] the way you want to watch careful what
[1:31:08] you do walk like real man of god talk
[1:31:10] like man of god act like man of god live
[1:31:13] like man of god because the devil your
[1:31:15] adversary is going about like a roaring
[1:31:17] lion seeking what he may devour why did
[1:31:19] he do this why did they act like that to
[1:31:21] jesus they were jealous of him
[1:31:23] that's the main reason they tried to
[1:31:25] belittle him
[1:31:26] they were jealous of his ministry and
[1:31:28] that's the reason they tried to belittle
[1:31:29] him he had a ministry of god and they
[1:31:31] knew that but it was contrary to the
[1:31:33] creeds so they tried were trying to
[1:31:36] belittle him make everything every
[1:31:38] little flaw they could find that way
[1:31:40] they want him to quit he listen
[1:31:43] they wanted him to quit
[1:31:44] they wanted the people to denounce him
[1:31:46] they wanted to say no this guy's nothing
[1:31:47] look here how he is oh he's this this
[1:31:50] you know that's not right we've been
[1:31:51] taught all our life we should believe
[1:31:53] the elders and here he is stood right
[1:31:55] then bald here though
[1:32:01] what choice they would have made if
[1:32:02] jesus come back again
[1:32:04] and jesus disagree with the bunch of
[1:32:06] elders in this message
[1:32:08] amen
[1:32:10] hallelujah we have been taught by each
[1:32:12] rabbi
[1:32:13] all the years true
[1:32:15] and this man comes along and disagree
[1:32:17] with them
[1:32:18] that man ain't fit to be a preacher
[1:32:21] they were trying to belittle him but all
[1:32:22] of that the ones that believe him loved
[1:32:24] him they seen the scriptural miracle
[1:32:26] signs that would not be hindered by them
[1:32:28] no sir them who believe and believe him
[1:32:30] those who love them stood by him and
[1:32:33] they would not see what others pointed
[1:32:34] to them oh hallelujah god always calls
[1:32:38] are you ready
[1:32:39] they're not trying to hit the spiritual
[1:32:42] not the other way or wrong
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:47] that events are in the light boy
[1:32:50] amen are you spiritual
[1:32:53] you'll be you'll be hated
[1:32:55] i told them i told africa join the bunch
[1:32:59] hallelujah all those who are going under
[1:33:01] perfection will be hated
[1:33:03] because joseph was the word that's why
[1:33:04] he was hated jesus was the word that's
[1:33:06] why he was hated the bride will be the
[1:33:08] word that's why she'll be hated
[1:33:11] join the bunch so don't think everybody
[1:33:13] will put a bouquet over your flower or
[1:33:15] over your head and put a robe a ring of
[1:33:17] flowers around your neck no no no no
[1:33:19] they wouldn't see with you because you
[1:33:21] are going to perfection
[1:33:23] oh praise god so watch something they're
[1:33:25] not trying to hate the spiritual of
[1:33:26] course the kings hit evil it caused
[1:33:28] quran to hit moses it caused judas to
[1:33:30] hate jesus and on and on it goes isn't
[1:33:32] that right they tried to destroy the
[1:33:34] influence try to destroy everything
[1:33:35] because nothing but jealousy started in
[1:33:37] cain and proved it was jealousy and
[1:33:40] and then when the natural the carnal and
[1:33:42] the spiritual meet together it proves
[1:33:44] seat and no other way because jealousy
[1:33:46] comes from satan and then causing an
[1:33:48] impersonation of truth
[1:33:50] oh hallelujah
[1:33:52] so if people don't want god's perfect
[1:33:54] will god give you a permissive will
[1:33:56] isn't that right
[1:33:57] god made a perfect will and his perfect
[1:33:59] will isn't what we want today amen is
[1:34:01] not right so god wants his people to be
[1:34:03] one
[1:34:05] and the devil have a plan to try to put
[1:34:06] people under his one under his plan
[1:34:09] god has a plan and the devil has a plan
[1:34:11] and when the devil is trying to get all
[1:34:13] people under his plan while god is
[1:34:15] trying to get people to be under his
[1:34:17] plan there are two
[1:34:19] great spirits in the world one of them
[1:34:21] is the devil the other one is god
[1:34:24] so all in your life there's just two
[1:34:27] influences
[1:34:28] that's right everything is connected
[1:34:30] with those two
[1:34:32] not three not four just two
[1:34:36] is either the devil is inspiring
[1:34:38] something or god is inspiring something
[1:34:41] influence come towards or against
[1:34:47] hallelujah somebody could influence
[1:34:49] somebody against this church or to watch
[1:34:51] this church somebody could influence you
[1:34:53] away from what is right or towards
[1:34:56] something that is wrong is to and fro
[1:34:58] that's how you are influenced
[1:35:00] and jesus came to bring an influence of
[1:35:01] god
[1:35:02] upon the face of the earth they wanted
[1:35:04] the influence of a man to take power
[1:35:06] back from rome
[1:35:08] jesus said my kingdom is not of this
[1:35:10] world
[1:35:11] so the influence you want i ain't come
[1:35:12] to bring you that because you i'll have
[1:35:14] meant to fight for me my kingdom is of a
[1:35:16] different world all together because
[1:35:18] that rome and all i'm think is just
[1:35:19] temporary
[1:35:21] isn't that right all what having you
[1:35:23] captive is just temporary
[1:35:25] isn't that right
[1:35:26] so the devil of his messengers and god
[1:35:27] with messengers and we had liberty to
[1:35:29] make our choice to whom we would yield
[1:35:32] ourselves to
[1:35:34] so who have influence over your life
[1:35:36] have power over you
[1:35:40] are you hearing me whatever have
[1:35:43] influence over your life have the power
[1:35:46] over you
[1:35:47] that's why the adopted son must have
[1:35:49] dominion over himself
[1:35:51] before he have dominion over others
[1:35:53] and other things that's why jesus was
[1:35:55] led into the wilderness that he gave
[1:35:57] power over himself over the lust of the
[1:35:59] eyes the pride of life lust of the flesh
[1:36:02] when he overcome that he was ready to
[1:36:03] return in the power of the spirit to
[1:36:05] deal with the humans because when you
[1:36:07] could deal with the devil humans are
[1:36:09] secondary because you already deal with
[1:36:11] the devil it is written it is written it
[1:36:12] is written and he dealt with it by the
[1:36:14] word to prove we gonna deal the devil by
[1:36:16] the word
[1:36:17] and overcome it is written it is written
[1:36:19] it is written then the spirit come upon
[1:36:21] jesus to really handle the devil and
[1:36:24] deal with the devil and our brother
[1:36:25] bring our tremendous taught in uganda
[1:36:27] there he said the devils ask jesus to go
[1:36:29] into the pigs
[1:36:32] and jesus give them their request
[1:36:35] and if jesus could give devils
[1:36:38] their requests
[1:36:40] because they asked they're going to pick
[1:36:41] to do more mischief what about the sons
[1:36:43] and daughters
[1:36:45] the devils asked jesus
[1:36:47] let us go into the prayers and jesus
[1:36:49] said i i allow you to
[1:36:51] i give you permission i answer your
[1:36:53] requests what about you sons and
[1:36:54] daughters of god
[1:36:55] that shall wake you up inside of here to
[1:36:58] make a request known unto god
[1:37:00] there's no good thing he will hold from
[1:37:02] you
[1:37:03] there is no good thing he will withhold
[1:37:04] from you
[1:37:05] let me say it good now there is no good
[1:37:07] thing he will withhold from you
[1:37:09] he want to pour it on you and let your
[1:37:10] cup run over
[1:37:12] hallelujah david said my cup run it over
[1:37:15] my cup runs over
[1:37:18] sully goodness and mercy shall follow me
[1:37:20] all the days
[1:37:21] of my life oh that's
[1:37:23] a man that i love that man loved god he
[1:37:25] anointed the promises of god i look
[1:37:28] under the hill so might come with my
[1:37:29] help my help comes from the lord isn't
[1:37:31] that right
[1:37:32] oh praise god amen
[1:37:34] so what the only two forms
[1:37:36] are gonna skip down oh blessed be the
[1:37:38] name of the lord
[1:37:39] praise god praise god
[1:37:42] hallelujah hallelujah you talk about
[1:37:44] united nations everybody trying to get
[1:37:46] the unity everybody on the same thing
[1:37:48] now watch it's choosing time you must
[1:37:50] choose you this day whom you're going to
[1:37:51] serve the devil has presented many
[1:37:53] things glamorous that you can choose if
[1:37:55] you wish to is that right he said no
[1:37:58] you say when an unclean spirit here we
[1:38:00] go it's gone out of a man he walks in
[1:38:02] dry places
[1:38:04] and he's going around trying to find
[1:38:07] rest here we go
[1:38:09] a spirit is not very bad
[1:38:11] until he can find somebody he can talk
[1:38:14] to
[1:38:15] or live through
[1:38:18] so the spirit is harmless until it gets
[1:38:20] somebody he could talk to
[1:38:22] and work through
[1:38:24] just recently i could feel a spirit in a
[1:38:26] meeting all sending a letter of apology
[1:38:29] the first night i forgive you god does
[1:38:30] too or when the meeting was going on an
[1:38:33] evil spirit in the meeting and that
[1:38:35] spirit here we go is almost harmless
[1:38:38] until it can cut somebody it can work
[1:38:40] through that's right
[1:38:42] watch
[1:38:42] then
[1:38:43] it can work through it certainly do
[1:38:45] damage because it's an evil spirit and
[1:38:48] the holy spirit is here trying to find
[1:38:50] somebody to work through
[1:38:52] and when it finds somebody to work
[1:38:53] through it can do good
[1:38:55] so it's two spirits their motives the
[1:38:58] objectives watch how it is watch their
[1:39:01] works
[1:39:02] watch their fruits and then you see what
[1:39:04] spirit is on you
[1:39:06] you are motivated by spirit
[1:39:11] are you hearing me this morning
[1:39:13] you are motivated by spirit if you have
[1:39:16] no spirit you are dead
[1:39:18] and if you have spirit it motivates your
[1:39:21] life
[1:39:22] and your life because the fruit of a
[1:39:24] christian is a christian spirit
[1:39:26] if you've been afraid of a christian is
[1:39:27] not right
[1:39:29] you see it in deep qualitatively people
[1:39:31] come up on the platform and bahrain says
[1:39:34] you're not sick you're you're christian
[1:39:36] what does he the man didn't speak
[1:39:39] there's a spirit of vibrating of the man
[1:39:42] that braham know he's a christian he
[1:39:44] said you're a minister the gospel you're
[1:39:45] not here you're here for revival he
[1:39:47] could discern the spirit of a christian
[1:39:50] it sends out a vibration
[1:39:53] you don't have to even speak it speaks
[1:39:55] for itself
[1:39:56] so when jesus was walking them devil was
[1:39:58] crying out
[1:40:01] because the devil seen big bright light
[1:40:03] walking
[1:40:04] and other people watching them balling
[1:40:05] belzebo
[1:40:07] and those devil seen son of god
[1:40:10] hallelujah
[1:40:12] those never seen big bright light
[1:40:15] walking the face of the earth that is
[1:40:17] about what they want to see what
[1:40:18] thousands of live voices
[1:40:21] the thunder of god
[1:40:23] turning up and sweetness and humility
[1:40:26] undefiled walking around the earth
[1:40:28] without the blemish
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:32] oh hallelujah hallelujah are you with me
[1:40:36] so what this spirit now goes out walks
[1:40:38] in dry places hunting the fine rest the
[1:40:40] baby said he could not find it so he
[1:40:42] said i'll return to where i come out of
[1:40:45] so he goes back to this person that he
[1:40:46] once was in
[1:40:48] and he find all the house swept
[1:40:50] cleaned up
[1:40:51] sanctified condemnation gone a real
[1:40:54] happy believer but it is empty
[1:40:57] he said come here seven other spirits
[1:41:00] worse that he was will you please try to
[1:41:02] get this the bible said that's the truth
[1:41:06] jesus said it's the truth he comes back
[1:41:08] to this house a man who confessed christ
[1:41:10] to be a savior got rid of his wickedness
[1:41:13] quit his drinking quit is smoking his
[1:41:15] lion is stealing he has become
[1:41:17] sanctified cleaned out his house is all
[1:41:19] swept if he's free he comes back you can
[1:41:22] find that house then he goes and gets
[1:41:23] seven other spirits worse than he was
[1:41:26] comes into this person and the bible
[1:41:27] said the last state of that person is
[1:41:29] seven times worse than it was in the
[1:41:30] beginning
[1:41:33] was that i tell you
[1:41:34] our empty house
[1:41:36] is a target
[1:41:38] for the devil
[1:41:39] so we have to get the empty house filled
[1:41:43] with the holy ghost
[1:41:44] so you rarely have no time to waste
[1:41:47] you have time to be hungry and tasting
[1:41:49] looking to be filled
[1:41:51] with the holy ghost because the devil
[1:41:53] gives an empty clean house and you know
[1:41:55] he get kicked out so he's not coming by
[1:41:57] himself you gotta get kicked out again
[1:41:59] he needs some help so he gets seven more
[1:42:01] and then has to be better than he was
[1:42:04] those seven worse than him to help bust
[1:42:06] down the door to come and occupy your
[1:42:09] house
[1:42:10] but today
[1:42:11] the bible said when the enemy
[1:42:13] coming like a flood
[1:42:14] the spirit of god raised a standard so
[1:42:17] we are believing this morning that
[1:42:19] standard will be raised in your life
[1:42:21] oh blessed be name of the lord
[1:42:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:26] so watch
[1:42:27] if you are filled with the world lords
[1:42:28] god send the holy spirit to the earth to
[1:42:30] motivate the church you might be filled
[1:42:32] with thoughts you might be filled with
[1:42:34] theology you might be filled with
[1:42:35] education you might be filled with
[1:42:37] religion and still be a target of the
[1:42:40] devil
[1:42:41] watch when god made you that you could
[1:42:43] empty i love that when you are born you
[1:42:47] was made with a place to be filled by
[1:42:50] nature you're a child of the devil the
[1:42:52] evangelists come along you repent get
[1:42:54] cleaned up you see what the devil comes
[1:42:56] he brings back to you and sets you in
[1:42:58] some little nomination i say our church
[1:43:00] is the biggest one and then you get
[1:43:02] heady high-minded why don't condemn me
[1:43:03] just stay home watch television it
[1:43:05] doesn't condemn me to smoke a little
[1:43:06] friendly cigarette your fruits tell you
[1:43:08] what you are
[1:43:09] now watch and then somebody come and
[1:43:11] talk about miracles you sit down
[1:43:12] somebody said don't believe that
[1:43:13] we don't believe it and then you get
[1:43:16] behind it is the same motive that was in
[1:43:18] the tower of babel
[1:43:20] god don't want that he don't want us
[1:43:22] united all under methodists under
[1:43:23] baptist or any church dominion he wants
[1:43:26] united under his spiritual kingdom the
[1:43:28] holy spirit and when the holy spirit
[1:43:30] comes the world becomes dead and you are
[1:43:33] filled with the baptism of the holy
[1:43:34] ghost and the devil is a person that has
[1:43:37] to stay away from you
[1:43:38] you are under god's domain
[1:43:40] so with the holy ghost inside of you the
[1:43:42] devil have to get permission he will
[1:43:44] stay away from you because he got
[1:43:47] shocked when jesus touched when he had
[1:43:49] to touch and interfere with jesus in the
[1:43:50] wilderness isn't that right
[1:43:52] so god made you a place that you could
[1:43:55] be emptied out oh praise the name of the
[1:43:57] lord blessed be the name of the lord and
[1:44:00] jesus will not permit disciples to
[1:44:02] preach the gospel until they receive the
[1:44:03] holy ghost they have been honored to
[1:44:05] walk with him for three and a half years
[1:44:07] they were holy men accepted in the sight
[1:44:09] but he would not let them preach until
[1:44:10] they waited up there and got all the
[1:44:12] differences out of them and then the
[1:44:14] holy spirit came what the world needs
[1:44:16] today is that same feeling when the
[1:44:18] dumping comes out its need of filling it
[1:44:21] brings love where you have doubts it
[1:44:23] brings fate where you have indifference
[1:44:24] it brings love where you have hatred it
[1:44:26] brings fellowship and when and when the
[1:44:28] church of the living god someday will be
[1:44:30] united under one head the head of god o
[1:44:33] praise the name of the lord blessed be
[1:44:36] the name of the lord o hallelujah
[1:44:38] hallelujah
[1:44:40] glory to god so watch
[1:44:42] watch
[1:44:44] your life being different from what they
[1:44:46] say
[1:44:47] your testimony of your life is louder
[1:44:49] than the testimony that someone could
[1:44:51] say something about you so keep in that
[1:44:53] in your mind
[1:44:54] we are bringing influences every day
[1:44:57] and the life you live proves what's
[1:44:58] inside of you you cannot change that it
[1:45:01] reflects
[1:45:02] what's on the outside
[1:45:04] and if we take the testimony of being
[1:45:05] christians i think that is one of the
[1:45:07] most solemn things that a man or woman
[1:45:08] and boy could do when you take on the
[1:45:10] name of christ
[1:45:12] here we go he is going to be a
[1:45:14] representative of christ
[1:45:16] so you are not representing headstone
[1:45:18] tabernacle you are representing jesus
[1:45:21] christ
[1:45:22] you are representing the kingdom of god
[1:45:24] when you leave here is not the believers
[1:45:26] watching you is god watching you
[1:45:28] amen others watching you too isn't that
[1:45:30] right so satan was castled from heaven
[1:45:32] isn't that right and he actually oh
[1:45:35] praise god okay he said now watch
[1:45:39] when you get man
[1:45:40] that will break up and organize and
[1:45:42] break a brotherhood that's the devil to
[1:45:43] me i've never seen a person too low
[1:45:46] i have never seen a person too far in
[1:45:48] sin yet i have never seen a woman too
[1:45:50] stooped or man to stoop
[1:45:52] but what i would go to him
[1:45:54] and put my arms around him and bring him
[1:45:57] out of that if i can
[1:45:59] i have never seen a bunch of holy
[1:46:00] rollers or whatever you want to call
[1:46:02] them shouting and rooting whatever they
[1:46:04] might do but what i'll get right there
[1:46:05] and root and jump and holler with them
[1:46:08] to glorify god
[1:46:09] whether he is black yellow brown
[1:46:11] whatever he is the holy ghost comes on
[1:46:14] one level and that's when you meet god's
[1:46:16] requirement if you ever get it it will
[1:46:18] come on god's level o praise the name of
[1:46:21] the lord do you believe that
[1:46:23] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god
[1:46:26] blessed be the name of the lord if you
[1:46:28] get it you're going to be on god's level
[1:46:30] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:46:32] so let's go over it again write division
[1:46:35] make it plain
[1:46:37] that he that readeth miran
[1:46:39] the word has to be made plain to you
[1:46:41] that as a child of god the book was
[1:46:43] sealed is unsealed to bring back what
[1:46:45] sons and daughters of god that's god's
[1:46:47] purpose and plan that sons and daughters
[1:46:49] god be restored he sent a message to
[1:46:52] restore our hearts back to the faith of
[1:46:53] the fathers
[1:46:54] faith then have to take us to power paul
[1:46:57] must take us to the promise to manifest
[1:46:59] the promise so god sent the word that we
[1:47:01] could have faith fear to raise up from
[1:47:03] where you are to possess what god
[1:47:05] promised you so faith leads to power
[1:47:08] power to the promise that manifests the
[1:47:10] promise isn't that right so the vision
[1:47:12] is this god sent a revelation of
[1:47:14] perfection
[1:47:16] jacob grace through the perfection what
[1:47:17] for to bring a resurrection

[1:47:21] going to be a resurrection all the
[1:47:23] saints that have died and going on
[1:47:24] they're going to be raised from the dead
[1:47:26] there's going to be a perfect bride she
[1:47:27] will be the capstone bride she's going
[1:47:29] to be the magnet to pull the others out
[1:47:32] of the grave hallelujah that's what we
[1:47:34] were ways up for
[1:47:36] to become god magnetically our
[1:47:39] christ is forming a headstone bride and
[1:47:41] he gonna come into it and raise the rest
[1:47:43] of them from the grave
[1:47:45] l-o-v-e is coming down
[1:47:47] the love of god is coming down they're
[1:47:49] going to transform the church the love
[1:47:51] of god going to transform the church we
[1:47:53] got to break into that divine love all
