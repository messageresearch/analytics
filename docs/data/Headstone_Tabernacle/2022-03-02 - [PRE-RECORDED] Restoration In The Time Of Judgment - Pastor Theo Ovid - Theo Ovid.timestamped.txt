[19:41] god veiled in human skin
[19:44] and father god you promised to come back
[19:45] in the last days
[19:47] unveil yourself in a people
[19:49] to give one final witness
[19:52] to the world
[19:54] before the judgments of god strike
[19:57] lord the uncommon judgment
[19:59] father prepare our hearts this morning
[20:02] speak to our hearts take me out of the
[20:04] way and be glorified in our midst in
[20:06] jesus name we ask it
[20:08] amen and amen you may be seated praise
[20:11] god i want to welcome each and every one
[20:12] of you here this morning
[20:14] in the precious name of jesus
[20:16] and that name is the all-powerful name
[20:19] isn't that right
[20:20] and he give us the opportunity to serve
[20:22] him
[20:23] and to love him
[20:24] and to have great expectation from him
[20:27] amen you love him this morning
[20:33] well to those of you who was in your
[20:35] oldest night happy new year
[20:37] and may the blessings of god
[20:39] uh be upon you for this coming year that
[20:41] god would shine his light
[20:43] upon you
[20:45] in a life of service
[20:46] and if you're in prison that god will
[20:48] bring you out
[20:49] of your prison
[20:51] because there are people that are in
[20:52] prison
[20:53] and they need to come out of the prison
[20:55] some people in the prison of selfishness
[20:58] the prison of lust in the prison of
[21:00] anger and temper in the prison of hate
[21:02] and the prison of jealousy in the prison
[21:05] of holland grudges and the prisoner of
[21:07] holy oaths
[21:08] real prisons these are like spiritual
[21:11] prisons
[21:12] and you have to have a desire to get out
[21:14] of it and uh
[21:17] you know i was sharing something with
[21:19] some brothers about
[21:20] something i'd like to say it like a
[21:22] default position
[21:24] each one of us have like a default the
[21:26] default in which the environment family
[21:29] environment what you grow up how you
[21:31] grow up uh what you learn educational
[21:34] level whatever but there's a default
[21:36] position in which you react to things
[21:39] and do things and act in a way that that
[21:41] is what you know
[21:43] that is what you call the default
[21:45] position so anything happen you fall
[21:47] back to that level of what you are
[21:49] custom with we don't like new things we
[21:53] don't like strange things we don't like
[21:55] things that shake us off of our comfort
[21:58] zone
[21:59] but sometimes god arranged those things
[22:03] it's amazing that god don't ever tell
[22:05] people stay where you are i'm gonna come
[22:06] to you he just tell abraham get out
[22:10] get out from among your people
[22:12] get out from your country onto a land i
[22:15] will show you i'm not even sure here
[22:17] right now i will show you just take a
[22:19] move
[22:20] get out so what god challenges us is to
[22:23] get out our default zone
[22:25] get out of our comfort zone you don't
[22:28] ever raise your hands and you get out of
[22:30] that by raising your hands you don't
[22:32] ever shout you get out of that by
[22:33] shouting you're selfish you get out of
[22:35] that by giving by sharing you're
[22:37] extending yourself there's some people
[22:39] who see for themselves and their family
[22:42] their own circle they cannot effectively
[22:44] serve
[22:45] but for god so loved the world that he
[22:47] gave his only begotten son
[22:49] and jesus came serving whosoever want to
[22:52] hear him whosoever want to receive him
[22:55] whoever want to get a breakthrough he
[22:58] went about doing good and to serve
[23:00] and there was one man he was full of
[23:02] demons full of devils isn't that right
[23:04] he was legion had a thousand devils and
[23:06] he cried out hallelujah forgot to
[23:09] deliver him
[23:10] he was still an individual having a
[23:13] choice he born by demon powers still had
[23:16] the voice to cry for a breakthrough
[23:20] there is no excuse for you not having a
[23:22] desire
[23:23] for a breakthrough there is no excuse
[23:25] for you i will not have a desire to
[23:27] break past your limitations your
[23:30] situations your past your psychological
[23:33] issues there is no reason for that
[23:35] because that man had a thousand demons
[23:37] wasn't six wasn't ten a whole thousand
[23:40] and he cried and he cared to call upon
[23:43] the lord and when he cried jesus heard
[23:46] his cry and jesus came and delivered him
[23:49] those demons had him naked those demons
[23:52] had him stripped and when he was
[23:54] delivered he went and get some clothes
[23:57] praise the name of the lord so i don't
[23:59] care what your condition is this evening
[24:01] i don't care what your condition is this
[24:02] morning god is able
[24:04] to deliver you from your default
[24:06] condition
[24:08] environment and situation what your mama
[24:11] tell you what your grandmother tell you
[24:13] what your grandpa tell you what your
[24:15] environment allowed for you you could
[24:18] break out of that
[24:19] you need to break out of that you need
[24:23] to get out to that god will drop some
[24:25] bums to rock you out of that
[24:29] oh hallelujah could somebody say amen
[24:32] amen
[24:33] that's why the bible said let the weak
[24:35] say i am strong because the weak default
[24:38] position is i am weak and i am
[24:40] struggling and i can't make it but god
[24:43] like to jam the issue and shake you and
[24:46] rock you from that default position to
[24:49] say let the weak say i am strong
[24:53] harley let the poor say i am rich and
[24:57] let the sick say i am healed give the
[25:00] lord a shout of prayer
[25:07] oh glory glory glory glory
[25:10] the bible talk about the desert
[25:12] blossoming like a wilderness the bible
[25:14] talk about in the desert springs will
[25:16] come forward god like to challenge the
[25:18] situation he like to question baroness
[25:21] and say rejoice don't parent you're
[25:23] going to produce more than the woman
[25:25] with child god loves to do that
[25:29] oh hallelujah who going to help me
[25:31] preach this morning
[25:35] oh
[25:36] hallelujah
[25:38] why would talk about the baron brick
[25:40] fort into singing
[25:44] a baron can't sing
[25:47] baron is grieving for child grieving for
[25:49] breaks reprove him
[25:51] and the church is barren and not even
[25:54] grieving all these virtues the early
[25:57] church had
[25:58] we have more books than they had
[26:01] we have more preachers than they had we
[26:04] have more tapes more mystery more
[26:05] knowledge than they had it seems that
[26:08] our hearts have been turned back to the
[26:10] books that the fathers did not have
[26:13] but that's not the promise
[26:16] turn the hearts of the trend back to
[26:17] reading
[26:18] no
[26:19] back to the fate
[26:22] that was once delivered to the saints
[26:25] let me tell you something church that's
[26:27] backslide
[26:30] i'm not hearing you this morning
[26:31] [Applause]
[26:34] preaches this backslide
[26:36] elder's backslide people has backfired
[26:40] but god have a way of bringing them back
[26:47] not because somebody is in church
[26:49] everything is all right no
[26:52] sometimes the devil calls in havoc
[26:55] sometimes they walk into what the devil
[26:57] have created and the devil not moving
[26:59] because sin is there unbelief is there
[27:02] principles broken is there and god can't
[27:04] even touch it
[27:11] this year is going to be a different
[27:12] year
[27:13] [Applause]
[27:16] this year you're going to get a
[27:18] breakthrough
[27:21] this year you're going to get a
[27:22] breakthrough
[27:23] yeah yeah this year it's also going to
[27:25] be judgment if you're going to get a
[27:26] breakthrough
[27:27] judgment is also going to strike
[27:30] because you're going to get the picture
[27:31] in the midst of judgment
[27:33] oh hallelujah we're not looking for
[27:34] blessings no no no god said behold
[27:37] i send you elijah before what
[27:40] before that great and terrible day of
[27:43] the lord that's what's coming
[27:46] a terrible day is coming a day of
[27:48] blackness and gloom is a terrible day is
[27:50] coming for the entire world a terrible
[27:52] day is coming if you think think tough
[27:54] now a terrible day is coming it's going
[27:57] to get worse
[27:59] worse
[28:00] worse so stop complaining
[28:06] my god they're going to get worse
[28:08] so you are one in a million
[28:10] that's why you should shout that's why
[28:13] you should rejoice that's why you should
[28:15] honor god
[28:17] listen
[28:19] with your whole heart
[28:24] you won't be seated
[28:25] [Applause]
[28:27] money is a corrupter you know
[28:29] the bible said the love of money not
[28:31] moneyness but the love of it
[28:33] some people just love it
[28:36] they say more money
[28:38] they just love it the love of it is the
[28:41] root
[28:42] of all evil because they keep grabbing
[28:45] at it
[28:46] they're lusting for it they're pushing
[28:48] for it depressing for it to get things
[28:52] and jesus said a man life does not
[28:54] consist of the amount of things that he
[28:57] possessed that there are people have
[28:58] more cars that they could drive but they
[29:00] have the things like toys
[29:04] natural things that are going to
[29:06] fade away
[29:08] and you come to church
[29:10] hearing a message that god has sent
[29:13] to prepare a people
[29:16] for the coming of the lord
[29:18] but jesus said they're going to say the
[29:21] lord
[29:22] delay his coming
[29:25] and if the lord delay is coming we must
[29:27] well do our own thing
[29:30] but there is going to be a brand
[29:33] that's going to testify
[29:35] that the lord himself
[29:37] has
[29:38] descended with a shout out
[29:42] to get us out
[29:47] oh can we give the lord some worship
[29:50] we're gonna read the scripture just now
[29:56] there's some ministers going to preach
[29:57] till they die
[29:59] they're not preaching for the rapture
[30:02] they're not preaching for the second of
[30:03] the lord they're preaching because the
[30:05] whole service is around them they will
[30:08] preach till they're dead
[30:11] they have no burden
[30:12] for the people
[30:14] they have no burden for revival
[30:17] because revival comes with a burden
[30:19] another question i want to ask you this
[30:21] morning god promised a revival what are
[30:24] we willing to do to get it
[30:27] amen
[30:29] god promised a revival
[30:33] god promised a revival
[30:35] what are you
[30:37] willing to do
[30:38] to get it or are you just going to come
[30:41] to church and go back home and think
[30:43] that is all right i say a big fat no
[30:46] that is not all right if god promised
[30:49] something there's going to be somebody
[30:51] that's not going to only speak it
[30:54] or claim it but they're going to walk in
[30:56] the light of it
[30:58] there's going to be a people
[31:00] that he's called for his namesake
[31:04] oh glory to god
[31:06] my god i feel inspired now
[31:09] you may be seated one time god told
[31:12] israel is not because of you
[31:14] i am doing what i am doing i am doing to
[31:17] you for my name's sake
[31:20] that my name not be defiled among the
[31:24] gentiles
[31:25] god does do things for his order god is
[31:28] doing things for his glory god does do
[31:30] things for his name's sake
[31:34] oh
[31:34] hallelujah
[31:36] not for you
[31:38] but for his glory
[31:40] not for you
[31:41] but for his honor he deserves the honor
[31:45] he deserves the glory
[31:52] there's going to be healings
[31:54] [Applause]
[31:59] i shouldn't tell you to say email on
[32:01] that you should be so convinced i'm not
[32:05] talking about this pentecostal fraud i'm
[32:08] not talking about that i'm talking about
[32:11] the dynamic power
[32:12] coming into the songs of god
[32:15] listen to unveil god
[32:18] [Applause]
[32:22] you may be seated
[32:24] no no no i'm not talking about the man

[32:37] skill step into sixteen elements and god
[32:41] put on your shoes and god take the
[32:44] scriptures break the word and god come
[32:48] along and confirm the word
[32:50] that's what we are talking about a
[32:53] living god
[32:54] not a paper god
[32:56] a living god of god that discerns the
[32:59] god that could call out sin the god that
[33:02] rebukes the god that corrects
[33:05] the god that instructs
[33:08] the god that bring down the intelligence
[33:11] for your family's condition for your
[33:14] house

[33:27] god
[33:29] that brings the probe of the spirit
[33:32] who
[33:33] the word

[33:57] eyes and seen into the souls of those in
[34:00] the church that is the pillar of fire
[34:03] promised to be in the sons of god in the
[34:06] last days could we give god some praises
[34:14] i'm not talking about some preacher
[34:16] going to bible school i'm not talking
[34:19] about education and intellectual stuff
[34:22] because they had that in the old
[34:24] testament they had that with israel you
[34:26] may be seated
[34:28] the story we know with david angola
[34:31] and we know the story
[34:33] intellectuals was governed in a church
[34:35] at that time
[34:36] intellectuals with natural sword because
[34:38] then these is natural sword
[34:40] but you are afraid with your soul
[34:41] trained men
[34:43] they are afraid
[34:44] nobody want to go out glad had him
[34:45] pinned down and they would come
[34:47] untrained untrained
[34:49] no school
[34:50] no training no left right left right
[34:52] left right turn right turn left polish
[34:54] your boots none of that
[34:56] none of that
[34:58] but he knew god
[35:02] you don't have to know the mechanics
[35:05] come on now come on now who who's with
[35:08] me this morning
[35:09] who's with me this morning you don't
[35:12] have to know
[35:13] all the mechanics but you got to know
[35:16] when you put in the key that engine
[35:18] tumbles
[35:23] maybe
[35:27] how many talk heard about keaton and
[35:29] keaton
[35:30] but like the king of the door you know
[35:32] they're just doing so
[35:34] the key turn
[35:36] you could turn a keyhole also
[35:38] but baram said a key is for door
[35:41] and the reason the door is locked
[35:42] because that treasure is behind it
[35:45] if you have nothing behind it it'll make
[35:47] sense to lock in the door with nothing
[35:48] there but if you have stuff
[35:50] i mean you have virtual knowledge and
[35:52] you have temperance and patience and
[35:54] your signs and wonders and you have
[35:55] miracles and powers and blessings you
[35:58] have it all locked up then fate is the
[36:01] key that unlock the door come on oh keep
[36:04] acting
[36:04] [Applause]
[36:11] you don't lock up nothing
[36:15] where are behind there boy
[36:18] i want to tell you
[36:20] let us see here we know there's nothing
[36:22] there should we look in that four
[36:24] man does look up treasures
[36:26] have fought and lock it tight
[36:28] because they have stuff behind there but
[36:30] god put stuff in the wood behind there
[36:32] that no scallywag can't just come and
[36:35] take the stuff
[36:39] because god does prove his word
[36:42] bye
[36:43] believers you believers give yourself a
[36:46] shout
[36:49] how many believers in the camp
[36:58] so god
[36:59] when god want to prove something
[37:01] he ain't coming to unbelievers listen to
[37:03] what he said if my people
[37:06] never call by my name
[37:08] shall pray no shall humble themselves
[37:11] not pray yet you can't pray until you
[37:14] get humble
[37:15] you cannot pray until you could break
[37:17] down yourself and the only thing that
[37:20] hinders you from humbling yourself is
[37:23] your pride
[37:25] oh can somebody say amen
[37:27] this is pastor over in the house this
[37:30] morning
[37:32] don't even think about the service
[37:38] when you're wrong
[37:40] you're wrong
[37:43] the only thing
[37:45] that would hinder you from humbling
[37:47] yourself
[37:48] in your home as a husband
[37:50] and your home as a wife
[37:53] and your home as a child
[37:55] is your pride
[37:57] hallelujah
[37:59] but god is so great
[38:01] he has the ability to humble himself
[38:05] and that's what we must begin to do
[38:08] humble yourself
[38:09] under the mighty hand
[38:11] of the living god
[38:14] humble your pride humble you
[38:16] god can't do that for you he could floor
[38:18] you he could humiliate you he could
[38:20] strip you and many of us need to be
[38:22] stripped because we get puffed up and
[38:25] when they get puffed up you get arrogant
[38:27] and you dress and you shoot some money
[38:29] in the bank and nobody can talk to you
[38:31] but the bible said he come to the humble
[38:34] he come to the mick he come to those
[38:37] people humble yourself under the mighty
[38:39] hand of god and he going to exalt you in
[38:43] due time let people laugh
[38:48] at you
[38:53] don't find this they shouldn't laugh let
[38:55] them laugh
[38:56] let them mock let them scuff

[39:01] sign the wonders and guess what many of
[39:03] them were not impressed

[39:12] to say who we love the lord we're going
[39:15] to serve god

[42:25] led by
[42:27] the spirit into the wilderness to slap
[42:30] up the devil to let him know i am here
[42:31] now
[42:36] when jesus put some slap on his face he
[42:38] said i go taking a break
[42:40] and jesus went into the temple
[42:42] went into the scriptures i began to
[42:44] release
[42:46] power
[42:47] by the word the spirit is now upon me
[42:49] you can't see it you can't feel it yet
[42:51] but i'm speaking it i am prophesying it
[42:54] the spirit is upon me because he has
[42:56] anointed me to bring good titans not bad
[42:58] news good tidings to set the captain
[43:00] free to bring out the prison doors that
[43:02] are bound hunter heal the sick he's
[43:04] prophesying he's talking about a
[43:05] ministry coming he's talking about what
[43:08] is about to happen nobody are healed yet
[43:10] nobody delivered yet but he has taken
[43:11] the word and he is presenting it because
[43:14] you know the word is the conductor of
[43:15] the spirit and when you get the word
[43:17] line up the spirit have to follow
[43:20] the spirit have to follow
[43:22] what is lined up by the word
[43:25] [Applause]
[43:30] then
[43:31] jesus made a shocking statement this day
[43:35] this scripture is not present tense
[43:38] this scripture is alive the scripture is
[43:40] vindicated
[43:42] and they were shocked you see if you
[43:44] read it and just leave it there then
[43:47] it's just another reading you know the
[43:49] catholic readers come and read the
[43:51] scripture right they thought he was just
[43:52] doing that but then he made something
[43:54] more than that he said this scripture
[43:56] you hear
[43:57] right now
[43:58] today
[43:59] present tense i am that fulfillment
[44:02] you are hearing you are seeing
[44:05] you are witnessing
[44:07] and that is where the drama start
[44:10] [Applause]
[44:15] could you imagine
[44:16] reading quotes for years all of a sudden
[44:19] season 10
[44:21] and when you sit this day the scripture
[44:22] is fulfilled and then they say it's not
[44:24] that do this
[44:25] that's not the man we know
[44:27] carpenter man
[44:29] joseph's son is that this the same man
[44:31] we know we took out drive with him he
[44:33] gave us a drop in his car
[44:35] is that the same man
[44:37] then they threw him out
[44:38] and he became the rejected
[44:41] the rejected son of joseph the rejected
[44:44] messiah the rejected cornerstone the
[44:46] rejected stone and they didn't recognize
[44:48] that was the headstone
[44:50] the stone the builders rejected and as
[44:53] they kicked him out he was ready for his
[44:54] ministry he was anointed slap up the
[44:57] devil read the scripture and now he is
[44:59] ready for his ministry officially
[45:01] rejected by church people that were
[45:04] supposed to be expecting messiah
[45:07] officially turned down
[45:09] jesus christ rejected
[45:12] now he was ready could you go through
[45:14] that could you come to being rejected by
[45:17] your mother by your father by your uncle
[45:19] by your neighbor by your friends and
[45:21] your family because you are standing for
[45:23] the word of the messiah and you have
[45:26] become a messiah could you go through
[45:29] that and understand that all the
[45:31] rejection all the confusion is only
[45:34] preparing you for the ministry that god
[45:37] is about to break upon your life

[49:05] be interpreted our hearts by your spirit
[49:07] may bring life
[49:09] may begin strength and encouragement and
[49:11] anointing and blessing to your people
[49:13] bless those here with us bless those on
[49:15] the internet connected to us and would
[49:17] hear this message bless them may the
[49:19] anointing flow freely into their homes
[49:22] into the churches into their lives in
[49:24] jesus name we ask it amen god bless you
[49:26] welcome and welcome again you may be
[49:28] seated and welcome to those connected to
[49:31] us live via the internet god
[49:33] richly
[49:35] bless you
[49:36] our title restoration
[49:39] in the time of judgment
[49:44] god promised a revival amen what are we
[49:47] willing to do
[49:50] to get it
[49:52] but if you know the history of revivals
[49:55] or look at church history of any revival
[49:57] it didn't just come
[50:00] there was a preparation always has
[50:03] hearts prepared
[50:04] to get to the revival
[50:07] the astonishing thing
[50:09] the prophet said
[50:11] was that a minister
[50:13] cannot bring
[50:15] a revival that's powerful
[50:19] because we need a revival
[50:21] and you can't have a revival until you
[50:23] have god call men to take it and yet a
[50:26] minister cannot bring it he said it
[50:28] takes the people
[50:30] so somewhere along the line there got to
[50:34] be a transference
[50:36] of the vision
[50:37] of the word being open not to the
[50:39] minister
[50:40] to show how much knowledge he has
[50:42] but it has to be affected to the people
[50:46] that it would transform their lives so
[50:49] as to produce a revival
[50:51] and if you come to church and the word
[50:54] being preached doesn't affect your life
[50:57] affect your life to influence your life
[51:00] you need to get another church
[51:02] you need to get somewhere where you
[51:04] could be inspired enough to move you
[51:06] into action notice what the lord told
[51:10] the people in joel chapter one the meat
[51:12] offering is cut off drink offering he
[51:14] said weep all night he ministers of the
[51:16] lord sanctify your fast call a solemn
[51:19] assembly in other words take action to
[51:21] get restoration take action to get
[51:24] revival take action to get the
[51:27] breakthrough you don't just sit and said
[51:29] i don't have this you don't just sit and
[51:32] say i'm not getting this i'm not feeling
[51:34] the prison you don't do that you begin
[51:36] to cry out because that's your right as
[51:38] a son to cry out he said if my people
[51:41] that are called by my name shall humble
[51:44] themselves and pray you see when you
[51:46] humble yourself then you can sincerely
[51:48] pray because you know you are dependent
[51:50] on him but when you got something in
[51:52] your pocket and you don't depend upon
[51:55] god and you're going by your might and
[51:57] your strength and by your power you
[51:59] can't pray because you are all right you
[52:02] are strong you're going in your strength
[52:04] but when you understand without him you
[52:06] are nothing when you understand you are
[52:09] nobody and you need him more than ever
[52:12] when you understand that you have to
[52:14] break down yourself before your god then
[52:17] you could effectively pray oh god we
[52:20] have sinned we have failed we have
[52:22] fallen short restore the oil restore the
[52:25] wine restore hallelujah
[52:28] [Applause]
[52:32] cry out
[52:34] this is what god wants
[52:36] from his people
[52:38] but abandon he said god was waiting for
[52:40] the people to pray
[52:41] in order to get his siblings
[52:44] into action
[52:45] when the people begin to prayed and god
[52:47] could come down and said i've heard
[52:49] the cries of my people
[52:52] and i come down to any time if if if
[52:55] legion didn't cry out jesus couldn't
[52:57] respond he had was to cry out
[53:00] in order to get help you see a lot of
[53:03] people in drugs and drink and smoke pong
[53:06] and all kind but they're not crying out
[53:09] they get contented at their place of
[53:11] defeat they are satisfied
[53:14] at their place and they are comfortable
[53:16] that they wake up in the morning have to
[53:18] hit the bottle they go through the day
[53:20] they have to take cocaine they have to
[53:22] smoke a cigarette they are comfortable
[53:24] in that zone nothing tells them that
[53:27] they are dying let me tell them they're
[53:29] on the way out to here you're not living
[53:31] to be 120 you'll be all on our way out
[53:34] of here but why i'm on my way let's give
[53:37] the devil a jamming why i'm on my way
[53:40] let's get victory over the lust of the
[53:42] eyes over the lust of the flesh over the
[53:45] prayer while we are on our way
[53:47] [Applause]
[53:51] jesus knew he was going
[53:53] he knew the victory was at the cross the
[53:56] victory wasn't the signs and the one is
[53:58] actually jesus had small miracles and
[54:00] built up to the racing of the dead
[54:02] that was like a capstone miracle
[54:05] and when they saw the dead raised with
[54:07] lazarus they see the whole world going
[54:09] after this man we have to do
[54:12] something
[54:13] let's call our emergency meeting all we
[54:16] disagree with we have to shake their
[54:18] hands
[54:19] let's form a sahaja yoga immediately
[54:22] immediately let's get this console going
[54:25] to stop this rolling revival called
[54:28] jesus a one-man revivalist
[54:33] we can't stop him because when the
[54:34] people were hungry i was three thousand
[54:36] he took five loaves and two fishes and
[54:37] fed five thousand people that's a
[54:39] dangerous man you can't even cut him off
[54:42] with the bakery you can't cut down food
[54:44] from the man when we say taxes he told
[54:47] his disciples go get a fish and pay
[54:49] give caesar what is caesar how could you
[54:52] defeat a man that seems to know all what
[54:55] he's supposed to do when he's supposed
[54:58] to do where he's supposed to go and how
[55:01] he's supposed to do it
[55:05] [Applause]
[55:11] how could you
[55:13] how could you throw a man like that off
[55:16] how could you recommend
[55:17] inviting your wedding everything going
[55:20] good they're saving their motives
[55:22] showing the main course menu and they
[55:24] come and tell them the wine ran out
[55:27] do you say i am a guest too
[55:30] i don't have a winery
[55:32] i'm not in the grave stamping business
[55:34] i don't need great store in business
[55:36] what have i to do with that
[55:40] then some whatever you say do do what
[55:42] could we come to that spot that whatever
[55:45] he said
[55:47] whatever god tell you you could do
[55:50] without question
[55:54] then jesus said let them go and draw
[55:56] some water
[55:57] put draw some water with the water parts
[56:01] know what that could do
[56:02] it's the same water
[56:04] it's the same water it's just have to
[56:06] obey
[56:07] and as they draw the water and they pour
[56:09] oh hallelujah same word
[56:13] i'm poor
[56:14] come on now same books
[56:16] and poor because jesus said draw it this
[56:20] morning and poor and he going to turn
[56:23] your water
[56:25] into wine
[56:27] and wine is the stimulation
[56:29] of revelation
[56:31] with wine you can't sit down
[56:33] you can't sit still
[56:35] your hands have to do something your
[56:37] foot have to do something
[56:39] your elbow have to do something even
[56:42] your neck
[56:45] hallelujah but your body got to do
[56:48] something because wine brings us
[56:50] stimulation
[56:57] jesus
[56:59] turned water
[57:01] into wine
[57:03] he bypassed the grapes
[57:06] he bypassed the crushing of the grapes
[57:09] he bypassed the whole process
[57:11] so what you're worried about
[57:13] is anything
[57:14] too hard
[57:16] for the lord
[57:18] he could bypass
[57:20] your tumor
[57:21] and took it from the inside
[57:24] the tumor hiding
[57:25] that demon and life on the inside you
[57:27] could go behind it
[57:29] you were finished
[57:31] come on now
[57:32] come on now
[57:34] cancer over
[57:36] female condition holder
[57:42] [Applause]
[57:45] god
[57:46] you let me see the goddess do some
[57:48] restraints inside job you know
[57:50] inside job you're calling
[57:52] hallelujah moving on the inside
[57:54] oh that's a god be serving now oh
[57:56] hallelujah you see after a while you
[57:58] have to take note right now people
[58:00] taking notes write and write directly
[58:02] but afterwards they will take note that
[58:03] you have been with jesus a different
[58:05] kind of note you can write that note you
[58:08] have to run and tell somebody that man
[58:10] have been with jesus because he is doing
[58:13] what jesus did
[58:19] are we ready for that
[58:21] are we ready for the same jesus
[58:23] the same jesus
[58:25] not another one
[58:30] you may be seated
[58:32] this
[58:33] same
[58:35] jesus
[58:37] in the old days in the 60s
[58:40] there's a preacher i feel like i'm in a
[58:41] hunchback you know hundred buckets big
[58:43] comeback and he mentored him turn around
[58:46] put his knee man back on boy jesus
[58:50] and people told the man back break
[58:52] when they look the man back straight as
[58:54] ever
[58:57] now don't go and try that they've got
[58:59] their anointing
[59:03] these guys
[59:05] were not intimidated
[59:07] by no physical condition
[59:09] no wheelchair we get this opportunity
[59:11] to get people out
[59:13] when them see wheelchair they get
[59:15] excited when there's a crutches that get
[59:17] excited when they see playing defying
[59:20] their eyes
[59:22] because the blind have to see because
[59:24] jesus is here and if jesus is here
[59:27] something got to take place
[59:32] is there believers in the house today
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:41] hallelujah
[59:44] nothing
[59:45] all you have to look
[59:46] at your conditions at your mountains
[59:49] at your obstacles at your hurdles you
[59:51] have to look at them as opportunities
[59:53] for god to come on the scene
[59:55] one gideon one time say lord if if
[59:58] you'll be with me do this do that
[1:00:00] guinness take things for granted he said
[1:00:02] the lord be with us where
[1:00:05] are the miracles
[1:00:07] because god is a god of miracles but
[1:00:10] when people have money in the pocket
[1:00:13] they believe they're working miracles
[1:00:15] because they could pay to go to the
[1:00:17] doctor they don't need jesus until the
[1:00:19] money runs out
[1:00:23] but when you understand
[1:00:25] that we are promised
[1:00:27] a restoration
[1:00:28] of this miracle working god
[1:00:31] one time brother brown said there was a
[1:00:32] place that was farming in the land no
[1:00:34] rain
[1:00:35] and a man had enough of it an old man he
[1:00:38] went in the middle of the street i like
[1:00:39] that not in his house and close the
[1:00:41] window
[1:00:42] in the middle of the street
[1:00:44] he went and said lord god has all frail
[1:00:47] hand raised up he said i serve you all
[1:00:49] these years send on rain he said a man
[1:00:52] people run because no rain was coming
[1:00:54] what god sent said reign without prayer
[1:00:59] do you understand what we're talking
[1:01:00] about
[1:01:01] elijah said not even jew or rain will
[1:01:03] fall till i called for it
[1:01:05] was i shot up heavens by my message
[1:01:08] i shut up the blessings by my message
[1:01:11] and only my work could unlock the
[1:01:12] presence of god
[1:01:14] you talk about power
[1:01:16] i want to know i'm not i want to feel a
[1:01:19] fire in your soul wanting this revival

[1:02:02] this is the gift that god gave me
[1:02:05] this is the fire
[1:02:06] that god put in my soul
[1:02:08] you see any man could study for seven
[1:02:10] days and bring a lot of mysteries trump
[1:02:12] is violence woes please woman his son
[1:02:14] plus israel
[1:02:16] got on magog russia amen blood moons
[1:02:22] universe star saturn mars line up
[1:02:26] number nine and number six and number
[1:02:27] this are number three and number five
[1:02:30] and what can i find and turn
[1:02:32] keys and after all of that nothing
[1:02:35] happening
[1:02:36] it's just what i call verbal gymnastics
[1:02:39] flipping here and someone's sorting it
[1:02:40] verbally
[1:02:42] but it's not causing the fire of faith
[1:02:45] to break upon your soul
[1:02:47] understand this
[1:02:48] understand that jesus got newsletters
[1:02:51] were sick
[1:02:52] jesus said the disciples are glad i'm
[1:02:54] not here
[1:02:57] he said lester's hurry get a quick car
[1:03:00] took one get my friend lazarus come come
[1:03:02] let's pray for him quickly he's some guy
[1:03:03] on that day
[1:03:04] news comes lazarus is dead
[1:03:07] so now the default is coffee
[1:03:10] and biscuit
[1:03:12] sad faces
[1:03:13] black veals everybody in sad mode that's
[1:03:16] the default okay jesus went down to the
[1:03:19] funeral
[1:03:20] week
[1:03:22] only to hear testimony lord
[1:03:25] if you had not if you had been here
[1:03:28] my brother had not died
[1:03:31] hallelujah
[1:03:32] but then the sister said something a
[1:03:35] little more
[1:03:36] she said but even now
[1:03:38] [Applause]
[1:03:43] no no no no hear the thing
[1:03:46] if she had stopped it lord if i had
[1:03:47] nothing yeah my brother and i died and
[1:03:48] stop right there they bury him
[1:03:51] complete the burial
[1:03:53] and give
[1:03:54] lazarus a salute
[1:03:57] [Music]
[1:03:59] a good send-off
[1:04:01] but when she said even now
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:09] even though
[1:04:11] cause a chain reaction
[1:04:13] even no
[1:04:14] activate faith and power
[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:20] now watch
[1:04:21] the default atmosphere was there
[1:04:23] because the bible said the shortest two
[1:04:25] words in the bible is jesus wept
[1:04:28] so jesus finds himself in default also
[1:04:31] but when even knows
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:34] even brought him out of the default
[1:04:36] of tears
[1:04:37] and weeping to say i am
[1:04:43] i am
[1:04:45] you have to watch what he's saying after
[1:04:46] that
[1:04:47] because he can be anything
[1:04:49] a man is dead he can't just say anything
[1:04:53] you have to say the right thing
[1:04:55] the man is dead we need an answer he
[1:04:58] said i am the resurrection
[1:05:01] come on now give the lord a shout of
[1:05:02] prayer
[1:05:06] and what you have need of the i am
[1:05:10] is willing
[1:05:11] the i am
[1:05:13] oh glory to court
[1:05:17] i am
[1:05:19] the resurrection
[1:05:20] and the life you may be seated
[1:05:22] he that believeth on me
[1:05:24] though he would death
[1:05:26] yeah shall he live
[1:05:27] watch this loudness is dead
[1:05:31] elijah's gonna come aboard i believe
[1:05:32] jesus wake me no he's dead
[1:05:35] so that is not for lazarus
[1:05:37] in that way
[1:05:39] this is for people are wrong
[1:05:40] to get activated
[1:05:42] with resurrection power with
[1:05:44] resurrection faith to move jesus a
[1:05:47] little further when jesus couldn't have
[1:05:49] he couldn't help it he said where have
[1:05:51] you lead him
[1:05:54] he didn't say go and raise him
[1:05:57] he just said where
[1:05:59] have you laid him
[1:06:02] human say but he's thinking
[1:06:07] he really did
[1:06:09] in case he didn't
[1:06:11] catch the full pictures
[1:06:13] he's not just sleeping he is really dead
[1:06:17] he stink it
[1:06:21] that's human talking
[1:06:22] jesus said roll away the stone
[1:06:27] no now if you believe he's thinking
[1:06:30] and he really dead
[1:06:31] he really did
[1:06:33] where he went
[1:06:36] so they had to roll past
[1:06:38] his thinking real past he really did and
[1:06:41] say and believe the command roll away
[1:06:45] roll away
[1:06:47] in those days there's a roller stone
[1:06:48] over the hole with the man they roll
[1:06:50] away the stone because you can't bring a
[1:06:52] man in the big stone there are you
[1:06:53] coming out he can't rule from inside
[1:06:54] roll away the stone do something
[1:07:00] you get that
[1:07:01] you have no manifestation until you do
[1:07:04] something
[1:07:09] roll away your stone i'm not praising
[1:07:11] him this morning i started praise god
[1:07:13] maybe your gray hair might start to turn
[1:07:14] back black i don't know but roll over
[1:07:16] god could still do miracles maybe your
[1:07:19] wrinkles might start to leave you
[1:07:21] that's not impossible because sarah
[1:07:23] sarah was all but sarah got back young
[1:07:30] i feel like 19 and a half this morning
[1:07:35] why do you think i move intro
[1:07:37] hallelujah i don't feel like no old
[1:07:39] tired old man long in a message 40 years
[1:07:42] i don't feel like that i feel just as
[1:07:45] strong as when i first started out i'm
[1:07:48] feeling inspired i feel anointed this
[1:07:50] morning i feel for revival
[1:07:53] this morning
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:08:03] in the pentecostal age
[1:08:05] when fire struck the pentecostal
[1:08:07] men shoot bullets on them and it falls
[1:08:10] we won't close like nothing
[1:08:12] they were bulletproof
[1:08:15] fire was on them
[1:08:17] and these are run them
[1:08:18] and people say look oh god look what
[1:08:20] they're going through but i'm saying no
[1:08:22] everywhere they go fire picking up god
[1:08:24] let people run them out at fire breaker
[1:08:27] they run them to that city next fire
[1:08:28] breaker they run them here and go to
[1:08:30] like the devil never end up in that kind
[1:08:33] of booboo mode because if he only knew
[1:08:34] what was happening he would tell him
[1:08:36] stay right there keep the fire right
[1:08:37] there don't keep it burning up but sit
[1:08:39] right there but god had them devils run
[1:08:42] in the people and have to run them fire
[1:08:43] picking up here that's what we want
[1:08:45] inside of here let fire strike one
[1:08:47] sister in one pew and let them charm the
[1:08:50] other
[1:09:00] me
[1:09:18] do something for jesus
[1:09:20] you're calling for more than watching
[1:09:22] anyways do something for jesus
[1:09:26] you call for more than giving your
[1:09:27] husband to me and do something for jesus
[1:09:29] get on fire for god
[1:09:37] fire of god
[1:09:42] the people of israel when they came out
[1:09:45] they never knew
[1:09:46] about this fire
[1:09:48] moses met the fire they didn't
[1:09:51] when they saw moses and saw one just
[1:09:52] like them
[1:09:53] i won't even say trying to make yourself
[1:09:54] a prince over us
[1:09:59] you went and come back and you're trying
[1:10:01] to make yourself a prince over us
[1:10:06] you are one of us
[1:10:11] don't get too big for your breaches
[1:10:17] they didn't know that man met god
[1:10:22] there was no witness
[1:10:23] there was no evidence
[1:10:25] there was nothing to show the people
[1:10:26] that this man met god
[1:10:28] when moses went into the court of
[1:10:30] pharaoh the two million people was not
[1:10:31] there
[1:10:33] they were
[1:10:34] seen about
[1:10:36] saving the slave masters
[1:10:38] moses went into the court of pharaoh as
[1:10:41] all kings and kingdoms bring homage to
[1:10:45] pharaoh and bring gifts and tidings to
[1:10:47] pharaoh
[1:10:48] moses was in the lineup
[1:10:50] and the king of greece is here
[1:10:52] drums beat
[1:10:54] and they bring claude
[1:10:56] bring ivory bring goal because egypt was
[1:11:00] first world
[1:11:02] egypt was the modern city
[1:11:04] pharaoh was the man
[1:11:06] president of the whole world
[1:11:08] known well at that time
[1:11:10] so if you want to be good with pharaoh
[1:11:12] when you come before you can't walk
[1:11:13] empty-handed you walk with gifts
[1:11:16] and 10 commandments moses time come they
[1:11:18] say what kingdom do you represent
[1:11:20] they recognize him yet he said the
[1:11:23] kingdom of the most high god

[1:12:07] i come for them
[1:12:09] i have come to go back and report to my
[1:12:10] god i can't bring them out because my
[1:12:13] god is great

[1:12:17] in all the earth and if my god is with
[1:12:20] me there ain't no stopping me now
[1:12:23] oh give the lord a shelter praise
[1:12:26] come on now
[1:12:28] and when you understand come on now the
[1:12:31] power of your god

[1:12:45] take your people you and your god
[1:12:47] everybody
[1:12:48] leave take them and go
[1:12:51] and i see the devil

[1:13:11] word

[1:13:16] now watch not in the right head
[1:13:19] in the bride's heart
[1:13:20] and the devil can't get there

[1:13:37] just ordinary she thought she was a
[1:13:39] normal one having this man and that man
[1:13:41] and that man until jesus come and bring

[1:13:57] and when she saw that she was convinced
[1:14:00] she was convinced and she ran as it
[1:14:02] comes to a man
[1:14:04] who told me everything i needed to know
[1:14:10] now um

[1:14:20] you've been through torment
[1:14:22] you've been through humiliation you've
[1:14:24] been through rape what kind of condition
[1:14:27] and god come and cover you with his love
[1:14:30] wrap you with a blanket of his grace
[1:14:33] bless you with his righteousness
[1:14:36] how you could come and not worship him
[1:14:44] he redeemed you
[1:14:46] you have nothing to say
[1:14:48] but thanks and honor and praise and
[1:14:50] glory and blessings
[1:14:55] [Applause]

[1:15:02] i don't want to burst your balloon
[1:15:04] balloon at your living room it is a
[1:15:06] balloon
[1:15:08] that's my voice eventually
[1:15:10] but the thing of it is
[1:15:12] we are here really
[1:15:14] for the honor and glory of god
[1:15:17] and all what we do that is not for
[1:15:19] christ doesn't count
[1:15:23] the currency of heaven is not
[1:15:24] materialistic
[1:15:25] the currency of heaven is not cars and
[1:15:27] house and land
[1:15:29] and whatever that's not the currency of
[1:15:30] heaven
[1:15:32] that's why when jesus gets the power of
[1:15:34] the rich man and
[1:15:35] the poor man and the rich man in hell
[1:15:37] the rich man said oh tell my family
[1:15:39] don't come here
[1:15:41] we can't do that

[1:16:32] you think i was talking like that i took
[1:16:34] from experience
[1:16:37] a dog was after me
[1:16:42] i was doing something with all them
[1:16:43] healing steps
[1:16:44] man i was running by like seven steps at
[1:16:46] a time
[1:16:49] just past coming and trying small father
[1:16:51] but that dog
[1:16:52] forget that i never run i think i'll do
[1:16:54] hundred meters oh dude
[1:16:56] recordings on such speed
[1:16:59] the dog was fierce the dog was coming
[1:17:00] for me and i didn't let him catch me i
[1:17:03] was running for my life and if the devil
[1:17:06] is behind you don't let him catch you
[1:17:09] keep on running run for your life
[1:17:16] hallelujah
[1:17:18] the passion to survive
[1:17:20] the passion to overcome
[1:17:22] the passion for breakthrough it has to
[1:17:24] strike you in such a powerful way
[1:17:26] that you can't let anything stop you
[1:17:29] from your goals and from the vision that
[1:17:31] god put in your soul
[1:17:33] whatever god put your soul to believe
[1:17:36] you cannot
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:42] that is why a people
[1:17:44] that break out a group think are
[1:17:46] powerful people
[1:17:48] and that's why the devil's job is to
[1:17:49] keep people into group thing i'm a
[1:17:51] baptist group i'm a metaphor
[1:17:56] so they're covered by the group
[1:17:57] anointing and the group is what
[1:17:58] determines their vision their outlook
[1:18:00] their pictures there is no individual
[1:18:03] revelation that inspires them
[1:18:06] and notice how jesus he dealt with
[1:18:08] disciples as individuals
[1:18:10] peter this what is that to thee
[1:18:12] followed on me he dealt with them as
[1:18:15] individuals because they are
[1:18:19] when the group decided to do something
[1:18:21] when judas was
[1:18:23] hung himself the group decided to choose
[1:18:26] a man by luck and they pick up a man
[1:18:27] called matias
[1:18:28] matthias did nothing no book of matas
[1:18:31] revolution matters prophet said just
[1:18:33] matters just fit in there like matthias
[1:18:35] baran said i was all human
[1:18:37] that was man's choice these people had
[1:18:40] the holy ghost and they choose a normal
[1:18:43] man that was going to have no testimony
[1:18:45] nothing because god choose paul
[1:18:48] to fit in that place there
[1:18:50] to be part of that number paul was the
[1:18:52] man that god choose so you see man have
[1:18:55] a way of you know using the eyes and
[1:18:56] seeing and whatnot we give them room for
[1:18:58] that but when god put his hand on you
[1:19:01] you know what i said
[1:19:03] when god put his hands on you
[1:19:06] it is his hands
[1:19:09] come on now
[1:19:11] come on now
[1:19:13] that's why paul said this way nothing
[1:19:15] present nothing past nothing to come
[1:19:18] could separate me from the love of god
[1:19:21] that is in christ jesus not peril not
[1:19:24] sword not poverty not trials not testing
[1:19:27] not tribulation
[1:19:32] that's not group think that is
[1:19:35] revelation
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:41] with that revelation
[1:19:43] you know your children will be delivered
[1:19:45] i don't care who they are right now
[1:19:47] i don't care what condition right now
[1:19:49] that is what challenges your fear
[1:19:50] because jesus didn't let lazarus death
[1:19:52] intimidate him
[1:19:53] blind but he must didn't look look
[1:19:56] people tell black to me he cannot hear
[1:19:57] you
[1:19:58] blind you're blind
[1:20:01] but he cried out
[1:20:03] and and that crime brought a faith
[1:20:05] that knocked heaven's dawn
[1:20:07] and heaven
[1:20:10] why do you think men set up satellite
[1:20:12] satellite is high to send down signals
[1:20:15] and information and radio and different
[1:20:17] kind of things they satellite they need
[1:20:19] it high up there to send these signals
[1:20:21] all around the world
[1:20:23] right now that is the impersonation of
[1:20:24] what we have
[1:20:30] what do you mean by thought for the
[1:20:31] branham was in south america
[1:20:34] a baby had died
[1:20:35] a woman heard about a baby race from the
[1:20:37] dead
[1:20:38] she didn't want to bury her baby she
[1:20:39] came to the service that day it had
[1:20:41] about two three thousand people with
[1:20:43] those people there

[1:20:48] people came to what brother brown said
[1:20:49] brother branham there's a woman longer
[1:20:50] given real trouble
[1:20:52] nobody could stop her
[1:20:53] she's passing through people's leg
[1:20:55] climbing over
[1:20:57] she's trying to get to the man of god
[1:20:59] somewhere on that platform of somebody
[1:21:01] that could give her back the life of her
[1:21:02] child
[1:21:04] she is battling with men only she's not
[1:21:06] asking permission please do you have a
[1:21:09] seat for me
[1:21:10] it have no seat
[1:21:12] it has no room
[1:21:13] everybody looking for a breakthrough
[1:21:15] and when everybody looking for the same
[1:21:17] thing is the desperate one
[1:21:21] who's gonna get it
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:26] but i'm saying let somebody go and pray
[1:21:27] for because you don't know who i am they
[1:21:28] send somebody down but you want still
[1:21:30] backing true
[1:21:31] she battled to the point
[1:21:33] where she touched the satellite
[1:21:38] that is what in him
[1:21:40] our satellite her faith
[1:21:42] hit god
[1:21:43] and god touches prophet
[1:21:45] break a vision and you say send for that
[1:21:47] woman bring her up
[1:21:52] now that is when god could take it from
[1:21:53] the back and bring you in front
[1:21:56] i'm not hearing you
[1:21:58] you want to be shouting because you want
[1:22:00] to see
[1:22:01] that nobody could stop
[1:22:04] the fate in your soul
[1:22:06] from being confirmed
[1:22:08] from being answered
[1:22:10] from being vindicated
[1:22:12] [Applause]

[1:22:19] that woman touch the satellite of god
[1:22:21] touch heaven soon heaven touch the
[1:22:23] prophet the brother said bring her
[1:22:26] and then that baby was raised from the
[1:22:27] dead
[1:22:28] who did that
[1:22:30] what did that what everyone say you know
[1:22:32] what too much of people here by going

[1:22:41] raised and the same god that raised that
[1:22:43] one could raise this one
[1:22:45] and i want that same god
[1:22:47] wherever that god is
[1:22:49] listen when revivals have to break out

[1:24:29] determine his future to be a spokesman
[1:24:32] and a turner of the key to unlock the
[1:24:35] kingdom to the gentiles paul was a
[1:24:38] murderer he saw stephen stone as it was
[1:24:41] paul was fighting the church but his
[1:24:44] spouse didn't determine his future
[1:24:46] murder but moses was a murderer as it
[1:24:49] was he killed a man but his past didn't
[1:24:51] determine his future your past doesn't

[1:25:19] i will restore
[1:25:20] saith the lord oh glory to god and god
[1:25:23] is restoring god is about to restore
[1:25:26] the challenging thing or the amazing
[1:25:29] thing is that god is restoring
[1:25:31] right in the awe of judgment you see
[1:25:34] when moses when noah was written for the
[1:25:36] water
[1:25:37] to raise his ark the same water he was
[1:25:39] waiting for was going to judge the world
[1:25:42] the same spirit that we are looking for
[1:25:45] and asking for will produce a judgment
[1:25:48] to anas and sapphira reproduce judgment
[1:25:51] tax fight in the church will produce a
[1:25:53] judgment that begins in the house of god
[1:25:56] that same spirit that we are looking for
[1:25:59] that same spirit that we are expecting
[1:26:02] it coming in a time of judgment cause
[1:26:04] judgment is fire fire fire going to come
[1:26:07] the fire
[1:26:08] of judgment the day the great and
[1:26:10] terrible day of the lord
[1:26:12] it's coming
[1:26:13] there is where
[1:26:15] when jesus went to the temple
[1:26:17] and found where it was written in the
[1:26:19] book of isaiah he left the part out he
[1:26:22] said the spirit is upon me to bring good
[1:26:24] titans to heal the sick to raise the
[1:26:27] dead to do all of that but then the
[1:26:29] party left out was to declare the day of
[1:26:32] vengeance of our god
[1:26:34] and that day of vengeance is for the
[1:26:37] bride
[1:26:38] mrs jesus will come to the temple mrs
[1:26:41] jesus will pick up the scripture right
[1:26:44] in the day of judgment and revelation
[1:26:46] praise 17 will be the voice of grace and
[1:26:49] the spirit and the bread say come
[1:26:52] whosoever will come drink of the water
[1:26:55] of life freely god going to be failing a
[1:26:58] pride god gonna be unveiled
[1:27:05] listen to this
[1:27:06] god
[1:27:08] will be unveiled
[1:27:10] again
[1:27:12] and before he's unveiled he has to be
[1:27:14] healed
[1:27:16] hide himself
[1:27:18] literally
[1:27:19] hide himself in you
[1:27:24] you think daniel know he had all that
[1:27:25] power hidden in him
[1:27:27] that power was unveiled when there's so
[1:27:28] many lions then
[1:27:30] no wasn't wasn't the lion who had
[1:27:31] breakfast lunch and dinner
[1:27:33] it was hungry lions
[1:27:35] lions who had the appetite ripe
[1:27:38] for eaten
[1:27:40] they teach sharp
[1:27:43] razor sharp
[1:27:44] they waited for food and when the lions
[1:27:47] see that you'll come along they say food
[1:27:48] rich
[1:27:50] until god send fire
[1:27:53] and lion interfere with fire around food
[1:27:59] so you see there is power in sons
[1:28:03] power in daughters
[1:28:04] ready to be released
[1:28:06] in the hour
[1:28:08] amidst the challenge amidst the judgment
[1:28:11] amidst the fear
[1:28:13] because fear going to strike you know oh
[1:28:15] yes los angeles is about to sink because
[1:28:18] the prophet saw it a prophet spoke it a
[1:28:21] prophet said there's a vision america
[1:28:23] bummed up in smoke before the coming of
[1:28:25] the lord the prophet saw russia said in
[1:28:28] a mistletoe the vatican saw it
[1:28:30] the prophets prophesied and predicted
[1:28:33] they see it
[1:28:34] it's a vision and when they come back we
[1:28:36] say thus see it the lord god gave roma
[1:28:38] space to repent refuse to repent kill
[1:28:41] two million people through the dark ages
[1:28:43] as if god gonna forget that but in the
[1:28:45] revelation of the spirit and the mystery
[1:28:48] of god the seed went down in the ground
[1:28:50] and god finds martin luther a catholic
[1:28:53] break upon him that just shall live by
[1:28:54] fate and that's the bit of the
[1:28:56] protestant but god didn't stop there it
[1:28:58] was the restoration of the cankerworm
[1:29:00] the catawome the palmer woman the
[1:29:02] caterpillar he bought luther then he
[1:29:05] bought wesley luther in germany western
[1:29:08] england and god the pentecost in america
[1:29:10] and then god sent a prophet to bring the
[1:29:12] word
[1:29:13] with the restoration of the word
[1:29:15] brings the restoration of power
[1:29:17] no word no power because the word is god
[1:29:20] and the word was lost so before power
[1:29:23] could come back he had to restore the
[1:29:24] world towards the restoration of the
[1:29:26] word and the word brings the fate so
[1:29:29] before the faith could come the word had
[1:29:31] to be restored so god say i will restore
[1:29:34] all
[1:29:35] what they eat them oh what the trash all
[1:29:38] what the pack up shop i'm gonna bring it
[1:29:41] right back the church gonna get the
[1:29:42] correct template the church gonna get
[1:29:45] the correct vision he said write the
[1:29:47] vision and make it plain the vision had
[1:29:49] to be spoken the vision have to be
[1:29:51] written you're not coming here as how
[1:29:53] you feel you're coming to fit into god's
[1:29:56] program
[1:30:00] i'm not preaching my opinion
[1:30:03] i am preaching a message
[1:30:05] that prepares us
[1:30:07] for revival
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:12] understand this
[1:30:13] understand this jesus have to come among
[1:30:15] us

[1:30:25] to the tribulation
[1:30:27] before you go in the air
[1:30:30] jesus have to be amongst the people
[1:30:33] in spirit form
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:37] brother branham said it is with him
[1:30:39] moving in and out
[1:30:41] and then we are worshiping the living
[1:30:43] christ

[1:30:58] daughter's sick
[1:30:59] somebody come and say do you bother with
[1:31:01] him she's dead

[1:31:08] give him the authority
[1:31:09] to go past the shells of debt and
[1:31:11] condition and ref if it's not there
[1:31:14] jesus is doing this like he's not here
[1:31:16] but she's not cheating he's sleeping

[1:31:21] is like sleep
[1:31:22] i go

[1:31:30] let's create an atmosphere i only want
[1:31:33] james and john or whoever just the
[1:31:35] believers
[1:31:36] just the disciples just the people that
[1:31:39] create and support the atmosphere of
[1:31:41] faith and power
[1:31:43] he said little lady arise
[1:31:46] give her something to eat and then he
[1:31:47] walk out now to him that's no miracle
[1:31:50] now to the other that's a miracle to him
[1:31:53] is what sons do

[1:32:33] the lord people don't pray because
[1:32:35] they're not humbling themselves
[1:32:36] every day they go in the power of their
[1:32:38] might their strength their ability their
[1:32:40] job their salary their pay whatever
[1:32:42] but friends the time has come for us to
[1:32:44] humble ourselves
[1:32:45] god i am nothing without you i am
[1:32:48] dependent upon you
[1:32:50] oh hallelujah humble themselves and pray
[1:32:53] and then turn from their wicked ways
[1:32:56] it means challenge your default
[1:32:59] condition
[1:33:00] your default position there are some
[1:33:03] people hold on to the argument this is
[1:33:05] how i am but that that is how you're
[1:33:07] gonna will will be
[1:33:09] this is how you always know it and today
[1:33:10] something you know peter peter's wife
[1:33:13] didn't make breakfast on time it didn't
[1:33:15] have food or whatever it is and peter
[1:33:16] didn't abuse her and rough her and carry
[1:33:19] on peter went upstairs and pray
[1:33:25] hallelujah
[1:33:28] i didn't get in trouble saying no no i
[1:33:30] don't know what going on there i don't
[1:33:32] have peter or ruffin peter whatever i i
[1:33:34] don't know but in praying a vision broke
[1:33:38] so he broke into the spirit
[1:33:40] now what if he had choreography
[1:33:44] he nothing spirit no vision coming
[1:33:47] peter sitting with a hard face in the
[1:33:50] porch
[1:33:51] waiting for his wife to serve him
[1:33:52] breakfast
[1:33:54] then the scriptures
[1:33:56] now hope that sing deep
[1:33:58] i hope that is very good
[1:34:00] because what i'm saying there no food
[1:34:02] given opportunity
[1:34:05] to pray
[1:34:08] i had a milk i even on that one
[1:34:11] then brothers the pizza
[1:34:14] please let me any brother say amen
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:25] so peter get the opportunity to pray and
[1:34:28] in praying he break into the spirit
[1:34:30] and saw a vision
[1:34:32] to kill these animals that they don't
[1:34:34] eat god said go and kill and eat he said
[1:34:36] but damn thing unclean he's saying don't
[1:34:37] say what clean unclean
[1:34:40] what god got killed him to a communist
[1:34:42] issue of animals
[1:34:43] in a language that he understand
[1:34:46] because they don't eat certain things
[1:34:48] and god show them go and eat that
[1:34:50] so the language speaks to peter don't
[1:34:53] talk that talk your default is don't eat
[1:34:56] that that's your default i want you to
[1:34:59] break out of your default i want to
[1:35:01] challenge how you think what you see who
[1:35:04] you see and how you deal with people not
[1:35:07] like you
[1:35:10] come until somebody said bigger
[1:35:13] you see you can be comfortable with
[1:35:15] people at your level just like you think
[1:35:18] like you in your environment and peter
[1:35:20] was being challenged don't even talk
[1:35:22] that because i'm going to carry it to
[1:35:23] people you don't know
[1:35:25] so peter has led my vision to conor's
[1:35:27] house in the meantime cornelius not a
[1:35:29] mean man not a stingy man not a hard man
[1:35:32] but a man freely giving arms freely
[1:35:34] helping people he wasn't a selfish
[1:35:36] rascal no he was genuine in what he was
[1:35:38] about and he wasn't even a jew come on
[1:35:41] now see him as somebody he wasn't in the
[1:35:43] covenant of israel he was just an
[1:35:45] ordinary man and the bible hold a
[1:35:47] memorial for that man for his spirit for
[1:35:51] his attitude for his behavior come on
[1:35:54] shame and somebody
[1:35:57] and why he is praying god tell him go
[1:36:00] and send for peter
[1:36:03] now that is an example of what's going
[1:36:05] to happen in the future
[1:36:08] people will send for you
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] they don't believe it isaac you you're

[1:41:11] hallelujah
[1:41:13] good somebody give the lord a shout
[1:41:15] glory glory glory
[1:41:18] praise god
[1:41:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:22] listen to this
[1:41:24] i checked something out what is fire
[1:41:25] made out of
[1:41:26] you know that fire generates heat and
[1:41:27] light but have you ever wondered what
[1:41:29] it's made out of here's a look at the
[1:41:31] chemical composition of fire
[1:41:33] fire is the result of a chemical
[1:41:34] reaction called combustion
[1:41:36] at a certain point in the combustion
[1:41:39] reaction called the ignition point
[1:41:41] flames are produced
[1:41:43] oh hallelujah
[1:41:44] flames consist primarily of carbon
[1:41:46] dioxide
[1:41:47] vapor water oxygen and nitrogen fire
[1:41:50] emits heat and light
[1:41:52] in order for combustion and fire to
[1:41:55] occur three things must be present
[1:41:58] fuel
[1:41:59] oxygen and energy
[1:42:02] usually in the form of heat
[1:42:04] we need those three things
[1:42:06] oh hallelujah hallelujah we need the
[1:42:09] word
[1:42:10] we need sanctification and we need
[1:42:13] worship
[1:42:14] you put that together it creates an
[1:42:16] ignition point
[1:42:18] come on now come on now don't sleep for
[1:42:20] me no
[1:42:21] don't practice you have to go right with
[1:42:23] me now
[1:42:24] ride with me now
[1:42:25] because jesus opened the understanding
[1:42:28] so that they get the first component
[1:42:30] which is the word
[1:42:31] oh hallelujah then afterwards they went
[1:42:34] in the upper room and what they were
[1:42:35] doing they were creating an atmosphere
[1:42:38] by worshiping
[1:42:40] and praising god continually
[1:42:44] in a sanctified condition
[1:42:53] we need a tree
[1:42:55] sanctified condition
[1:42:57] the word open to you
[1:42:59] and praise and worship and when you come
[1:43:02] and decide praise and worship it gets so
[1:43:04] hot
[1:43:05] it takes ten days but i'm saying mary
[1:43:07] had was to lose her dignity marriott was
[1:43:10] a loser pride because she was pride
[1:43:12] proud of having jesus
[1:43:15] i am the mother of jesus
[1:43:18] oh my sister mary had a little chip on
[1:43:21] her shoulder because she was the mother
[1:43:24] of jesus she had to lose that
[1:43:28] she had to lose that so much that she
[1:43:29] have to begin to see she is just as the
[1:43:31] same mary magdalene
[1:43:36] she have to see herself at the same
[1:43:37] level like mary even you marry i marry i
[1:43:40] make jesus you make problems and trouble
[1:43:42] but um we are the same level we are
[1:43:44] daughters of god yes yes yes we are
[1:43:46] daughters of god so america say i am
[1:43:48] mary and you and you are mary no it's
[1:43:51] not like that it's both mary's and i'm
[1:43:53] saying we are all sons and daughters of
[1:43:55] the living god not no higher one and
[1:43:57] lower one and this one no no no we are
[1:43:59] sons and daughters of the living god so
[1:44:02] it take ten days for pride to come out
[1:44:04] ten days for jealousy remember the
[1:44:06] mother came with two sons and said
[1:44:08] master oh hallelujah could you put one
[1:44:10] on my left and one on my right
[1:44:13] one woman came and asked could you put
[1:44:15] one son on the left and one on the right
[1:44:17] isn't that right well all them was in
[1:44:18] the upper room too they had to lose all
[1:44:20] that pride all that kind of thing like
[1:44:21] that until what happened begin to
[1:44:23] worship the atmosphere had to be created
[1:44:25] and what happened they come to an
[1:44:26] existing point and then tongues of fire
[1:44:29] light upon them and they were all filled
[1:44:31] with the holy ghost they break out to
[1:44:34] that combustion they break out to that
[1:44:36] inspiration they break to that ignition
[1:44:38] point and that is what desperation does
[1:44:41] it breaks you to an ignition point where
[1:44:43] fire have to make an appearance
[1:44:45] fire to come down glory you have to come
[1:44:47] down the witness of the spirit have to
[1:44:49] come down healing enough to come long
[1:44:51] deliverance have to come down picture up
[1:44:53] to come down how many want that
[1:44:56] and what will you do
[1:44:59] to start a revival
[1:45:00] i'm bout to wrap up
[1:45:02] oh glory to god
[1:45:04] and the bible went and said oh my god
[1:45:05] there's a consuming fire
[1:45:07] isn't that right
[1:45:08] god want the word to be consumed that's
[1:45:11] why ibrahim put on the altar i see the
[1:45:13] wood but where is the fire i see the
[1:45:16] wood but where's the fire core will
[1:45:17] provide himself a sacrifice god like the
[1:45:20] sacrifice that is consumed by fire
[1:45:23] fire is a witness of god let the quran
[1:45:25] answer by fire let him be god because
[1:45:28] our god is a consuming fire i like the
[1:45:31] word consuming it burns everything out
[1:45:34] it burns until there is nothing more to
[1:45:36] burn when fire start to move nothing
[1:45:38] stops it it keeps burning until there is
[1:45:41] nothing else to consume that's a fire
[1:45:43] and when the fire of god begins to move
[1:45:46] the church is ready to be purified the
[1:45:48] church is ready to get the purifier
[1:45:51] filled
[1:45:52] in the sons and thought of the living
[1:45:54] god
[1:45:56] oh hallelujah
[1:46:00] i have an entire message here you know
[1:46:02] but i'm not going by that i'm going by
[1:46:04] what is pulsating upon me right now
[1:46:06] hallelujah because i know this here is a
[1:46:08] new year i know there's a different day
[1:46:10] i know that different emphasis and you
[1:46:12] have to create the atmosphere you have
[1:46:14] to be convinced that you have to bring a
[1:46:16] revival you have to be convinced that
[1:46:18] you have to break the ignition point
[1:46:24] understand this brother branham said
[1:46:26] when the people
[1:46:28] of god
[1:46:29] go to calling
[1:46:31] on god
[1:46:32] there'll be a national showdown
[1:46:35] so i have for years i have been looking
[1:46:37] for the sign of the burden of prayer to
[1:46:40] come upon the people and i have not seen
[1:46:43] that because i know god let's go just
[1:46:45] gonna come down it didn't happen in the
[1:46:47] upper room it didn't happen any days of
[1:46:49] all go there was a prayer prepared jesus
[1:46:52] couldn't just land in jerusalem and say
[1:46:54] i am here there was a way prepared
[1:46:57] for him to come
[1:46:58] and when the pillar of fire came down in
[1:47:00] this age the voice said as john the
[1:47:02] baptist was sent to forerun the first
[1:47:05] coming of christ you have a message that
[1:47:08] was sent for around his second coming
[1:47:10] so the message itself is a message of
[1:47:12] preparation
[1:47:14] for the holy ghost
[1:47:16] capstone manifestation to come among
[1:47:19] god's people the capstone cannot come
[1:47:21] out of knowledge it's too wide it's got
[1:47:23] to come out to a call out bunch fitted
[1:47:25] in the holy spirit slot
[1:47:27] that is what the whole ego is coming to
[1:47:29] connect with so we have got to get in
[1:47:31] the spirit
[1:47:32] of the coming of the lord
[1:47:35] the homosexual in the spirit to
[1:47:37] vindicate sodom and gomorrah america is
[1:47:40] finished
[1:47:43] america is finished
[1:47:45] as a world power
[1:47:47] they're about to be sentenced and judged
[1:47:49] russia is finding its place
[1:47:51] they already advanced in weapons and
[1:47:53] technology they are in position already
[1:47:56] what about the bride
[1:48:00] and the thing about it nothing can move
[1:48:02] externally until the bride get that
[1:48:04] movement
[1:48:06] let me challenge you to hear it baram
[1:48:08] says what you see manifested temporarily
[1:48:10] will be manifested in his fullness when
[1:48:12] the press come down the bride will be
[1:48:14] pressed somebody knows that
[1:48:16] the pride will be a haunted physical
[1:48:17] group how many knows that how many know
[1:48:19] that we're closing the churches
[1:48:21] how many knows they're going to say we
[1:48:22] have to shut down
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:26] because the prophet saw it
[1:48:28] and we're going to be in places
[1:48:31] in homes
[1:48:32] they're going to convert the streets in
[1:48:33] their houses he said
[1:48:35] in america he saw it
[1:48:36] oh hallelujah but then when the press
[1:48:39] come down
[1:48:40] judgments hit in the earth a bride
[1:48:42] anointed with power
[1:48:44] to preach to the doomed
[1:48:47] to preach the people who cannot be saved
[1:48:49] one message to preach
[1:48:52] listen to this i'm going to close
[1:48:54] ah
[1:48:55] noah preach 120 years
[1:48:58] bilin anak
[1:49:00] before he even put the first wood
[1:49:04] he was preaching because gore gave my
[1:49:05] message
[1:49:07] evidence of his belief and faith in the
[1:49:09] message was the building of the ark
[1:49:13] every year the act going higher
[1:49:16] taller
[1:49:17] getting more constructed
[1:49:19] it took a hundred and twenty years
[1:49:22] the people laughed because the wood was
[1:49:24] soft
[1:49:25] wood that would sink
[1:49:26] the people laughed because there was no
[1:49:28] water
[1:49:29] to float the boat in
[1:49:31] he built it on land building a mountain
[1:49:33] as it was
[1:49:34] and there's no way he could float or
[1:49:36] whatever it is
[1:49:37] they had their jokes
[1:49:39] they had a mockery
[1:49:40] isn't that right i know a preacher
[1:49:43] come into the ark
[1:49:45] come into the ark
[1:49:47] get into the after safety act is now
[1:49:49] complete
[1:49:50] people still laughing fit and partying
[1:49:52] and so on
[1:49:53] then god tell noah let the animals come
[1:49:57] in
[1:49:58] two by two
[1:49:59] the people seen animals going
[1:50:01] peers
[1:50:02] going in the ark
[1:50:04] no humans
[1:50:06] despairs
[1:50:07] no faith is about to save only his
[1:50:10] family
[1:50:11] they are going to be in the ark
[1:50:12] he is preaching
[1:50:14] then the bible said and god shut the
[1:50:17] door
[1:50:18] and the door
[1:50:20] that god shot
[1:50:22] no man could open
[1:50:24] the god the door that god opened no man
[1:50:27] could shut but god shut no in
[1:50:30] no tell his children it wouldn't rain
[1:50:32] they said daddy are you sure he said
[1:50:34] tomorrow it's gonna rain
[1:50:36] next day
[1:50:37] no rain
[1:50:38] people give a big laugh
[1:50:41] they say look at noah all them animals
[1:50:44] all those spears are animals
[1:50:46] family doors shut
[1:50:48] the axe stood there for seven days
[1:50:51] preaching
[1:50:53] noah was no longer the voice
[1:50:55] the ark has become the voice
[1:50:58] the act was speaking on behalf of noah
[1:51:00] the act was no a witness
[1:51:03] of truth and righteousness the act was
[1:51:05] shut if somebody wanted to come then
[1:51:07] there was no room
[1:51:08] the door was shut no i couldn't open the
[1:51:10] door for them the chance was missed
[1:51:13] it was over
[1:51:14] it was finished for the entire world
[1:51:16] and all of a sudden after seven days the
[1:51:18] sky turned black it was god's judgment
[1:51:22] about the four
[1:51:23] the rain began to fall
[1:51:26] 24 hours 48 hours
[1:51:28] 40 days 49 rain and more rain
[1:51:32] the people heading towards the ark let
[1:51:34] us say
[1:51:36] noah couldn't open it because he didn't
[1:51:38] shot it
[1:51:40] he was only instructed to build it
[1:51:41] according to specification
[1:51:44] and before the final closure god tell
[1:51:46] him to pitch and seal the ark
[1:51:49] you see the laugh at the soft wood and
[1:51:52] that's how we have to become soft and
[1:51:54] pliable that the spirit could seal all
[1:51:57] the holes in our lives
[1:51:59] what they didn't know the wood was soft
[1:52:00] and chosen by god
[1:52:02] because god was bringing a fresh
[1:52:03] revelation how to seal it and pitch was
[1:52:07] going to seal all the pores to make the
[1:52:09] ark waterproof
[1:52:11] he sealed it on the inside and sealed on
[1:52:13] the outside and when god finished
[1:52:14] sealing you you'll be sealed on the
[1:52:16] inside and sealed on the outside the
[1:52:19] devil will have no room no place to get
[1:52:23] to you you'll be sealed in and the devil
[1:52:25] sealed out
[1:52:27] could we give the lord some praises
[1:52:29] and the rain fell
[1:52:32] and the rain fell
[1:52:34] and as the people were drowning
[1:52:36] and being judged the ark was getting
[1:52:38] ready to float
[1:52:40] the same water
[1:52:42] that drone the people is what floated
[1:52:44] the ark
[1:52:46] the same spirit we preach about is what
[1:52:48] will judge this world
[1:52:50] be careful
[1:52:52] get him
[1:52:53] before the door is shut
[1:52:56] because one of these days the door going
[1:52:58] to be shut
[1:53:00] and the bride will be preaching to the
[1:53:02] eternal lost
[1:53:03] people that cannot be saved
[1:53:06] and they will have to hear the word
[1:53:08] they will have to see signs and wonders
[1:53:10] and miracles and they cannot touch it
[1:53:14] come
[1:53:14] you should come up please
[1:53:16] come while there is time
[1:53:19] come
[1:53:21] while god is calling
[1:53:23] come
[1:53:24] while the world could jolt you out of
[1:53:26] your default condition
[1:53:29] everybody that got a breakthrough was
[1:53:32] challenged out of their fault
[1:53:34] look at abraham abraham god called
[1:53:35] abraham he stepped out
[1:53:37] to a people he didn't know a place he
[1:53:39] country didn't know he stepped out by
[1:53:40] faith
[1:53:41] and god blessed him
[1:53:44] lord came with him his family
[1:53:46] not get blessed because he when the
[1:53:47] blessing poured on you it has fallen
[1:53:49] those around you
[1:53:50] it's the blessing of god
[1:53:52] bad problems a lot of people and
[1:53:54] ibraheem people ibrahim said let's not
