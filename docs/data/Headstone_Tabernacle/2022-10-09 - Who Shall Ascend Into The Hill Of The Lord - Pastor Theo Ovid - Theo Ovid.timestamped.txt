[31:00] God bless you and thanks for coming
[31:03] and such an atmosphere here this morning
[31:06] we want to go into the scriptures we
[31:08] want to read from Saint Mark chapter 7
[31:11] what are we from 1 to 23.
[31:14] we want to read Psalms 24 1-6
[31:19] and we also want to read psalms 43 Verse
[31:22] 3 and 4.
[31:31] reading said Mark
[31:35] chapter 7 reading verse 1. then came
[31:38] together unto him the Pharisees and the
[31:40] sitting of the scribes which came from
[31:42] Jerusalem and when they saw some of the
[31:45] disciples eat bread were defiled that is
[31:47] to say with unwashing hands they fall
[31:50] forward foreign
[31:52] for the Pharisees and all the Jews
[31:54] except they wash their hands off eat not
[31:56] holding the tradition of the elders
[31:59] and when they come from the market
[32:00] except they wash they eat not and many
[32:03] other things they be which they had
[32:04] received a whole as the washing of Cups
[32:07] and pots Brazen vessels of tables
[32:11] then the Pharisees and describe ask him
[32:14] why walk not thy disciples according to
[32:19] the tradition of the elders but eat
[32:21] bread with unwashing hands he answered
[32:24] and said unto them well
[32:26] prophesy of you hypocrites and it is
[32:29] written this people honored me with
[32:31] their lips but their heart is far from
[32:34] me
[32:35] albeit in vain do they worship me
[32:38] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[32:41] of men for laying aside the Commandments
[32:43] of God your whole the tradition of men
[32:46] as the washing of pots and cups and many
[32:48] other such like things you do
[32:51] and he said unto them full well ye
[32:53] reject the Commandments of God that he
[32:55] may keep your own tradition for Moses
[32:58] said honor thy father thy mother and
[32:59] who's ever Christian father and mother
[33:01] let him die to death but you see if a
[33:03] man shall see it his father or mother it
[33:05] is common that is to say a gift by
[33:08] whatsoever thou might just be profited
[33:09] by he shall be free and you suffer him
[33:12] no more to do or for his father or his
[33:14] mother making the word of God of
[33:16] non-effect through your tradition which
[33:19] you have delivered and many such like
[33:21] things do ye and when he had called all
[33:24] the people unto him he said unto them to
[33:26] me every one of you and understand
[33:28] there is nothing from without a man that
[33:31] entering into him can Define him but the
[33:34] things which come out of him those are
[33:36] they that defile the man if any man our
[33:39] Bears stay here let him hear and when he
[33:43] had entered the house from the people
[33:44] the disciples asked him concerning the
[33:47] parable he said unto them so without
[33:50] understanding also do you not perceive
[33:52] that whatsoever thing from without
[33:54] entering it into the man it cannot
[33:57] defile him because it entered not into
[33:59] his heart but into his belly and going
[34:03] out into the drought put in all meets he
[34:05] said that which cometh out of the man
[34:07] that defileth the man for within out of
[34:11] the heart of men perceive evil thoughts
[34:13] adulteries fornications murders thefts
[34:18] covetousness wickedness deceit
[34:20] lasciviousness an evil eye a blasphemy
[34:23] Pride foolishness all these evil things
[34:28] come from within and defile the man you
[34:32] go to Psalms 24.
[34:34] want to read verse one to six
[34:36] the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness
[34:39] thereof the world and they that dwell
[34:42] therein for yet founded it upon the Seas
[34:45] and establish it upon the floods who
[34:47] shall Ascend unto the hill of the Lord
[34:48] or who shall stand in his holy place he
[34:52] that had Clean Hands and a pure heart
[34:54] who had not lifted up his soul unto
[34:56] vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall
[35:00] receive the blessing from the Lord and
[35:02] righteousness from the god of his
[35:04] salvation this is the generation of them
[35:06] that seek him that seek thy face o Jacob

[41:26] Hypocrites had no room for compromises
[41:29] because I will take her to the stake

[55:27] them go to take John and don't call him
[55:30] zechariah's just call him John
[55:33] ceremony willingness

[56:28] Commandments of men that's what Jesus
[56:31] found
[56:32] foreign
[56:33] [Music]
[56:36] hands often until they have a question
[56:39] about why Jesus disciples are so radical
[56:42] and so opposite to what we know in this
[56:45] message of Moses for all these years and
[56:48] we find their behaviors a little
[56:50] different and Jesus had to hit them hard
[56:52] he said you think what Outside the Fire
[56:54] in a man coming inside you washing pots
[56:57] and pans and doing this and the elders
[56:59] doing that and everybody mentioned doing
[57:00] this but the disciple is doing something
[57:02] completely different he says what comes
[57:03] out of the heart what comes out of the
[57:06] man hat so you can be praising and
[57:08] shouting but praise God you're a devil
[57:10] inside a deer
[57:11] that's why he said no shout wait listen
[57:14] live as high as your show you want to

[1:20:20] and my word to you Abraham cannot return
[1:20:23] void
[1:20:24] [Applause]

[1:20:28] 's feelings he believed
[1:20:31] he believes he believed God not Sarah
[1:20:33] barrenness he believed God not zero age
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:41] whose report
[1:20:43] do you believe

[1:33:10] he ascended and his own blood pay the
[1:33:13] price of all of us we know that
[1:33:15] oh my
[1:33:20] God whether I'm saying Christian Life is
[1:33:22] a public life oh yes you can privatize
[1:33:25] your life
[1:33:28] I live in a private life right with my
[1:33:30] business yeah
[1:33:32] and there's your business
[1:33:38] my life is where I deserves set the
[1:33:40] center just come in
[1:33:42] that is where the Freelancers come in
[1:33:45] that is where I get the the rest of the
[1:33:47] cloth and the seamstress leave it's part
[1:33:50] of the material but it's not part of the
[1:33:52] patterned we're cut
[1:33:54] so the clothes she cut and fall along
[1:33:56] guys
[1:33:57] that is some lies
[1:33:59] scraps
[1:34:01] remnants come in the church
[1:34:04] falling off in the corner not part of
[1:34:06] the pattern the shape because you see
[1:34:09] people don't want to be cut and
[1:34:10] notice the premium is not a boxing it's
[1:34:12] not a box you know it's a certain cut I
[1:34:15] said no way
[1:34:16] broad at the bottom but at the ghost of
[1:34:18] the top
[1:34:19] that climb up that hill to go up that
[1:34:22] mountain this Spirit may be talking
[1:34:24] about here faith and virtual knowledge
[1:34:26] to climb up it gets narrower and
[1:34:28] narrower and people slide straight off
[1:34:33] but there are those who will be keeping
[1:34:34] on climbing
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:37] this is my life
[1:34:39] I'll make my own decision
[1:34:41] this is my business I could do what I
[1:34:43] want
[1:34:46] oh yeah I think I said something on on
[1:34:49] Wednesday if you don't know the purpose
[1:34:51] of a pastor here you'll get deceived
[1:34:54] because the pastor is placed in a
[1:34:56] position of being a watchtower
[1:35:00] because he was in a position as a high
[1:35:03] priest
[1:35:04] and they pass in a position because God
[1:35:05] put him here in a watch tower to look
[1:35:07] over your souls
[1:35:10] so when you think the pastor SC it's
[1:35:12] true but guess who's here
[1:35:15] is God seeing
[1:35:17] yes the past says he and he's not God he
[1:35:20] can't see everything I know time he has
[1:35:22] a good people looking for the sailors
[1:35:24] and say this I got better tell me about
[1:35:25] you I finally rebuking me
[1:35:28] wrong
[1:35:35] I said so you don't know what you're
[1:35:36] doing wrong so you're waiting for me to
[1:35:39] rebuke you for the wrong that you're
[1:35:40] doing all right I say can I work
[1:35:42] different here you know
[1:35:45] you know what I want they want a
[1:35:47] oh yeah they want a spirituality yes
[1:35:50] some people like elixir
[1:35:52] preacher come on box
[1:35:54] on the side of beats

[1:36:03] service
[1:36:06] back to normal
[1:36:09] but you see when you're getting the love
[1:36:12] and you get to love the Lord
[1:36:14] and you're getting these scriptures like
[1:36:16] David said I was glad when they said
[1:36:18] unto me let us go into the house when
[1:36:20] you be when you get into that

[1:36:38] come inside of here and get this and
[1:36:41] take this back to your house
[1:36:45] could you do it yes because Jesus said
[1:36:49] the spirit is upon me oh get the Lord I
[1:36:52] shout it means it's resting on him and
[1:36:56] wherever he goes
[1:37:00] come on outside

[1:57:43] the word to you by giving you Revelation
[1:57:45] and breaking upon your life he could do
[1:57:47] it here no he could do it here on your
[1:57:49] way home or you could do it when you get
[1:57:51] home you can do it when you're on the
[1:57:52] way to the job but there's the Holy
[1:57:54] Spirit upon your life
[1:57:57] all right
[1:57:59] this one is it has been the holy spirit
[1:58:02] that made the Ephesus Church
[1:58:04] it was the Holy Spirit
[1:58:06] the Smyrna Church is the Holy Spirit to
[1:58:09] do all of that do you believe that
[1:58:12] I'm gonna wrap up
[1:58:14] my time Hallelujah there's no watch when
[1:58:18] in the individuals these virtues and
[1:58:19] things and knowledge that is added to
[1:58:21] Faith then when the Capstone comes the
[1:58:24] Holy Spirit seems it together there is
[1:58:27] the Battle of the Holy Spirit that's why
[1:58:29] it's so short today from your faith up
[1:58:31] to the Holy Spirit seals you in Christ
[1:58:33] then you become one and then that day
[1:58:36] you shall no arm in the Father the
[1:58:38] father and me and you you and me then
[1:58:40] that's a sealed unit of the Lord God now
[1:58:42] and then they are Vindicated and pleased
[1:58:45] when that time comes takes place they
[1:58:48] become Vindicated sons and Vindicated
[1:58:50] daughters listen this watch the two
[1:58:53] spirits will be so close in the last
[1:58:55] days they'll be very seized very elected
[1:58:57] the people can so live people can live
[1:58:59] clean listen holy life not be sinful
[1:59:02] adulterers drinkers Liars gamblers they
[1:59:05] can live above that and still not with
[1:59:06] it this is the age of Life a personal
[1:59:10] life of Christ so I like how he's
[1:59:12] bringing it because it doesn't put no
[1:59:14] grounds for you to sit down and sit back
[1:59:15] and relax it doesn't have that it have a
[1:59:18] pushing and oppression into this
[1:59:20] glorious kingdom of God or do you
[1:59:22] believe that Hallelujah now the second
[1:59:25] work of Hope sanctification the word
[1:59:27] means the clean and set aside for
[1:59:29] service well notice when the unclean
[1:59:32] Spirit going from a man he walks in dry
[1:59:34] places and it's clean it's pure and
[1:59:37] everything else and then when that demon
[1:59:39] come back and see the house clean it go
[1:59:41] on and gets seven other Devils worse
[1:59:44] than the first one to badge into the
[1:59:47] house and the man condition is worse
[1:59:49] than the first
[1:59:51] at first he had one demon now we have
[1:59:53] seven plus one
[1:59:57] no words will never take the
[2:00:00] pit for our Salvation works we
[2:00:02] fade already placed in him good works
[2:00:06] won't save you but they will come forth
[2:00:08] out of the same life as a fruit unto God
[2:00:11] I believe in good works even Mr man is
[2:00:13] not saved he ought to do good works do
[2:00:15] the best he can what a horribleness
[2:00:17] sight of God for a man to do evil works
[2:00:19] and then see that they are doing the
[2:00:20] will of God that is what the bishop and
[2:00:22] popes and hierarchy of Rome were doing
[2:00:24] they were killing and maiming and doing
[2:00:26] all man of evil in the name of the Lord
[2:00:27] and that is why why Gamble

[2:00:33] second Resurrection are people that did
[2:00:35] it by bright nice and true divide with

[2:01:48] that his hand is going again you're
[2:01:50] doing this you're doing this you're
[2:01:51] doing this you're doing this for the
[2:01:52] church
[2:01:54] it's a business
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:57] yes hands going
[2:01:59] shooting this is treating you doing this
[2:02:01] you know why they ask me
[2:02:04] to ask somebody else to do it yes
[2:02:12] behind it
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:19] you have no you want to get you know

[2:02:30] it fall in a grown glass falling and
[2:02:32] whatnot and she's singing and singing
[2:02:34] and singing and thinking afterwards I
[2:02:36] see you see you see I tell you she's a
[2:02:38] Christian
[2:02:40] try that no no
[2:02:46] you break him
[2:02:49] and that's the last time you first come
[2:02:51] back in the house
[2:02:52] because they will know verbally
[2:02:54] and by manifestation
[2:02:56] not to come back in that house
[2:02:59] this is where we had to get away from
[2:03:00] all that behavior you just behave right
[2:03:06] but we say all I'm sisters one husband
[2:03:08] and one boyfriend everything else
[2:03:12] water
[2:03:14] Elise and make a prayer Lord anytime

[2:03:32] but he don't know the heart
[2:03:35] so the prayer addressing the heart
[2:03:38] [Music]
[2:03:40] because it takes a certain heart
[2:03:43] to have the kind of compassion and entry
[2:03:46] to treat that man right who is a servant
[2:03:50] of Isaac
[2:03:53] now here come with big bangers and bees
[2:03:55] and all kinds of things like that

[2:04:28] something and bless you and open a door
[2:04:30] for you so because of your bad attitude
[2:04:33] you don't want this person your blood
[2:04:34] Catholic this person and because your
[2:04:35] black can't take this person this person
[2:04:37] that no this person can get to you
