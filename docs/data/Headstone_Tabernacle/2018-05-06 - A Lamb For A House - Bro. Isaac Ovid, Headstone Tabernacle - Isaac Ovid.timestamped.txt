[1:06:44] a testimony from sister Tricia lumens
[1:06:48] good morning Saints I want to testify of
[1:06:52] the goodness of God and what he has done
[1:06:54] and continues to do for me
[1:06:56] I've been oppressed by depression for
[1:06:59] some years I've been to doctors over the
[1:07:02] years taking medication and still I
[1:07:05] suffered two weeks ago I had a terrible
[1:07:08] attack that was so bad I started feeling
[1:07:12] suicidal
[1:07:14] I went back to the clinic and was told
[1:07:16] that I will have to start medication
[1:07:18] antidepressants for a two-year period
[1:07:20] and I would also have to see a
[1:07:23] psychologist on a weekly basis and
[1:07:25] they'd give me an appointment for the
[1:07:27] very next day when I got home my mother
[1:07:30] asked me how I was feeling and I told
[1:07:33] her I was feeling terrible she told me
[1:07:36] to go inside and pray she will pray also
[1:07:39] I went inside and I spread a cloth and
[1:07:42] knelt down and started to cry and how I
[1:07:44] could hardly pray through the crying and
[1:07:47] suddenly I heard and sign me a voice
[1:07:49] speaking saying behold I give you power
[1:07:52] to trample over serpents dry your tears
[1:07:56] and go rejoicing Jesus Christ makes you
[1:07:59] whole
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:02] I got up and in two hours I was washing
[1:08:05] wares and feeling better that same
[1:08:08] afternoon brother Kang Lee came to my
[1:08:10] house and unexpectedly and I told him
[1:08:14] about my situation and he prayed the
[1:08:17] next day I was up at 5:30 a.m. singing
[1:08:20] drinking coffee and doing chores I could
[1:08:24] not do forties that same day I had an
[1:08:28] appointment for a psychological
[1:08:29] evaluation of my mental condition I
[1:08:33] declined since I believe without a doubt
[1:08:36] that this attack was sent by Seaton to
[1:08:38] destroy my mind to put doubts about Who
[1:08:41] I am and who God says I am
[1:08:46] and she puts something in here she said
[1:08:48] I have not been attending for a meetings
[1:08:50] and Tuesdays and when I finally attended
[1:08:53] all hell was against it and attacked my
[1:08:56] mind but greater is He that is in me and
[1:08:59] he that is in the world hallelujah glory
[1:09:02] to God - sir treasurer gomez what a
[1:09:05] testimony
[1:09:08] and she also has a note of praise God
[1:09:11] morning Saints last days the ad acts for
[1:09:14] prayer for my brother Vincent Gomez who
[1:09:17] had visited the doctor's after feeling
[1:09:19] unwell and was told that his white blood
[1:09:21] cells was eating the red blood cells
[1:09:24] however when prayer was offered in tizen
[1:09:27] night by Friday morning after visiting
[1:09:29] another doctor he was told at his blood
[1:09:32] was fine and to just drink a lot of
[1:09:33] water
[1:09:34] thank you Jesus and thanks to the Saints
[1:09:37] you loved the Lord this morning
[1:09:41] did he make away for you when your back
[1:09:44] was against the wall and it looked like
[1:09:47] it was over did he make a way for you
[1:09:51] when all hell was against you is that
[1:09:55] your testimony this morning that's my
[1:09:58] testimony
[1:10:00] oh let's it'd be the name of the Lord I
[1:10:03] wish I had a voice to sing glory
[1:10:09] hallelujah so you're ready for the word
[1:10:11] this morning
[1:10:13] amen amen so let's stand to our feet
[1:10:16] just wanna read from one portion of
[1:10:19] Scripture reading from Exodus chapter 12
[1:10:25] and reading from verse 1 certainly
[1:10:30] welcome you all to the house of the Lord
[1:10:32] this morning Exodus chapter 12 and today
[1:10:38] is May the sixth and I believe the
[1:10:43] season has change real exactly two
[1:10:46] months away from the convention so I
[1:10:49] really want to connect to the theme of
[1:10:51] the convention so that we are in the
[1:10:55] spirit of preparation and the theme of
[1:10:59] the convention is applying the token
[1:11:02] because the Prophet said the evening
[1:11:04] time message is to apply the token so
[1:11:10] Exodus chapter 12 and reading from verse
[1:11:12] 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and
[1:11:14] Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this
[1:11:20] month shall be unto you the beginning of
[1:11:23] months not as powerful in other words
[1:11:25] God push the reset button on their lives
[1:11:28] and say from this month shall be unto
[1:11:32] you the beginning of months so whatever
[1:11:34] happened before we are starting over
[1:11:36] from this very declaration this month
[1:11:39] shall be unto you the beginning of
[1:11:41] months however you used to count it
[1:11:43] before but this month shall be unto you
[1:11:46] the beginning of months it shall be the
[1:11:48] first month of the year to you speaki
[1:11:52] unto all the congregation of Israel
[1:11:55] saying in the tenth day of this month
[1:11:58] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[1:12:01] according to the house of their fathers
[1:12:03] a lamb for a house
[1:12:06] and if the household be too little for
[1:12:09] the lamb let him and his neighbor next
[1:12:13] unto his house take it according to the
[1:12:16] number of the souls every man according
[1:12:18] to his eating shall make your count for
[1:12:22] the lamb your lamb shall be without
[1:12:24] blemish a male of the first year he
[1:12:28] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[1:12:31] the goats and he shall keep it up until
[1:12:34] the fourteenth day of the same month and
[1:12:36] the whole Assembly of the congregation
[1:12:38] of Israel shall kill it in the evening
[1:12:41] and they shall take up the blood and
[1:12:44] strike it on the two side posts and on
[1:12:48] the upper doorpost of the houses wherein
[1:12:50] they shall eat it they shall eat the
[1:12:54] flesh in that night roast with fire and
[1:12:56] unleavened bread and with bitter herbs
[1:12:58] they shall eat it eat not oven roar nor
[1:13:02] sudden at all with water but roast with
[1:13:04] fire his head with his legs and with the
[1:13:07] pertinence thereof and he shall let
[1:13:09] nothing of it remain until the morning
[1:13:11] and that which remaining of it until in
[1:13:14] the morning he shall burn with fire and
[1:13:16] thus shall he eat it with your loins
[1:13:19] girded your shoes and your feet and your
[1:13:21] staff in your hand and you shall eat it
[1:13:24] in haste it is the Lord's Passover so I
[1:13:28] will pass through the land of Egypt this
[1:13:30] night and will smite all the firstborn
[1:13:32] in the land of Egypt both man and beast
[1:13:35] and against all the gods of Egypt I will
[1:13:39] execute judgment I am the Lord and the
[1:13:42] blood shall be to you for token upon the
[1:13:45] houses wherein a year and when I see the
[1:13:47] Blood I will pass over you and upon the
[1:13:50] plague and the plague shall not be upon
[1:13:53] you to destroy you when I smite the land
[1:13:56] of Egypt and this day shall be unto you
[1:13:59] for a memorial and he shall keep it a
[1:14:01] feast to the Lord throughout your
[1:14:03] generations you shall keep it a feast by
[1:14:05] an ordinance forever
[1:14:07] may the Lord and a blessing to the
[1:14:09] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:14:12] this morning
[1:14:14] amen can the church say men can the
[1:14:19] church say Amen Oh
[1:14:22] blessed be the name of the Lord so I
[1:14:25] have a title this morning a lamb for a
[1:14:30] house a lamb for a house within that
[1:14:42] statement there are a number of
[1:14:44] specifics it speaks about the lamb it
[1:14:48] speaks about being specific so it's not
[1:14:51] just a lamb it's for a house and it
[1:14:55] speaks about being in a house and if
[1:14:58] they aren't enough people in the house
[1:15:01] to eat the lamb you should come together
[1:15:04] because you have to consume the lamb
[1:15:09] when we speak of applying the token many
[1:15:13] times we speak of the blood being
[1:15:16] applied on the doorpost and that is very
[1:15:19] important but there were a number of
[1:15:21] conditions that had to be met for what
[1:15:25] God had envisioned take place it had to
[1:15:29] be a certain kind of lamb you couldn't
[1:15:32] just randomly go and pull a lamb from
[1:15:36] your flocking and offer it it had to be
[1:15:39] a lamb without blemish for the lamb to
[1:15:44] be without blemish you had to be able to
[1:15:46] verify that it was without blemish which
[1:15:50] meant you would have to take time to
[1:15:51] check the lamb in speculum to make sure
[1:15:57] that there was no blemish on the lamb to
[1:16:00] make sure that this lamb was qualified
[1:16:04] to be part of this process
[1:16:08] death was what was about to happen so
[1:16:11] I'm a hundred percent sure that the
[1:16:13] inspection of the lamb would have been a
[1:16:15] very serious thora
[1:16:17] affair
[1:16:18] because you couldn't take a chance and
[1:16:21] get a lamb that had a blemish you have
[1:16:24] to make sure that the lamb that you cut
[1:16:26] was one that have no blemish it means
[1:16:30] that if you want to be really sure it is
[1:16:32] not impossible to expect that somebody
[1:16:35] would have checked it and double checked
[1:16:38] it and triple checked it because you
[1:16:40] didn't want to take chance because the
[1:16:43] death angel was gonna pass by it was not
[1:16:47] just that the lamb was supposed to be
[1:16:50] without blemish but even when you got
[1:16:52] the lamb and or blemish you have to put
[1:16:56] fire on the lamb and you had to eat it
[1:17:00] eat all of it you can eat and say I just
[1:17:05] want a piece of it it had to be consumed
[1:17:08] and it had to be consumed in a in a
[1:17:11] certain way a certain approach it was
[1:17:16] not eat sweat comfort but it was eat
[1:17:18] with your loins get it eat with your
[1:17:23] staff in your hand because it was a
[1:17:26] consciousness that this is a meal before
[1:17:30] leaving it's a last meal as it were it
[1:17:36] is a meal of preparation so it's a lamb
[1:17:39] without blemish it's a it's a lamb that
[1:17:42] was taken the police for the house
[1:17:48] because the house was a house with
[1:17:51] problems understand this and we'll go to
[1:17:55] background in a few minutes but God was
[1:17:57] not given special treatment to the
[1:18:00] children of Israel sin is sin and sin
[1:18:06] has to be judged whether it was sin
[1:18:09] committed by the Egyptians or sin
[1:18:11] committed by the churun of Israel the
[1:18:14] consequence was the same there was no
[1:18:17] particular attention being placed under
[1:18:20] Turin of Israel because they were God's
[1:18:23] chosen people
[1:18:25] the provision that was being made for
[1:18:27] them was a way of escape the only
[1:18:31] difference between the children of
[1:18:34] Israel and the Egyptians once there was
[1:18:36] a provided way of escape aren't you glad
[1:18:40] this morning that there is a provided
[1:18:45] way of escape that there is no
[1:18:48] difference because of our natural birth
[1:18:52] there's no difference between us and
[1:18:53] anybody else but the real difference is
[1:18:56] not where we were born or how we were
[1:19:00] born but the real difference is he made
[1:19:02] always when it looked like your back was
[1:19:05] against the wall he made always he made
[1:19:09] aware of his skin and he sent a prophet
[1:19:13] with a word to point you through the way
[1:19:16] of escape no one the Prophet could
[1:19:20] preach that the evening time message is
[1:19:22] to apply the token because his whole
[1:19:25] gospel is about getting out of this
[1:19:28] place getting out of the world the
[1:19:31] things of the world the system of the
[1:19:33] world the mindset of the world the cares
[1:19:37] of this world
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:40] somebody say min I don't know what's
[1:19:44] gonna happen this morning but there's
[1:19:46] lots of BLM for a house I'm concerned
[1:19:51] about my house this morning are you
[1:19:54] concerned about your house and if how
[1:19:56] you're living is too small to consume
[1:19:59] that lamb
[1:20:00] you let a partner with somebody partner
[1:20:03] with the person next to you and say we
[1:20:05] have got to get a lamb we have got to
[1:20:08] get that blood we have gotta apply it on
[1:20:11] the door we have got to consume the
[1:20:14] sacrifice
[1:20:15] we've cluttered it at all
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:21] I don't want to eat it in a relaxed way
[1:20:24] we are getting out of here
[1:20:27] my loins are got to be good I wanna make
[1:20:30] sure my staff is in my hand because any
[1:20:33] minute we can get word it's time to move
[1:20:36] it's time to leave with
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:42] can attest a man he may be seen it just
[1:20:46] for background what was taking place
[1:20:48] three of those instructions was a real
[1:20:52] knockout punch
[1:20:56] this was the one Brown attack on the
[1:20:59] enemy this was a multi-pronged attack
[1:21:03] God was doing a number of things all at
[1:21:06] the same time it's one thing to hit the
[1:21:11] enemy in one spot but God found a way
[1:21:14] with one instruction to deal with a
[1:21:18] whole number of situations in that one
[1:21:21] instruction of a dying of token God was
[1:21:25] solving the issue of sin he was solving
[1:21:30] the issue of being in bondage he was
[1:21:33] solving the issue of you having a
[1:21:35] testimony he was solving the issue of
[1:21:38] your family being covered he was solving
[1:21:41] the issue of your brother that was upon
[1:21:44] their lives in one move he was feeding
[1:21:48] them at the same time in one move oh you
[1:21:51] don't hear me this morning
[1:21:54] in one night in one night God did a
[1:21:59] whole list of things and there's coming
[1:22:02] a stories after one night in one night
[1:22:05] gotta solve a whole list of the issues
[1:22:08] in your life overnight Aaron left his
[1:22:12] rod in the Holies of Holies and
[1:22:14] overnight life came back I don't care
[1:22:18] how you came this morning but in this
[1:22:20] service the chains the bondage the
[1:22:25] questions the doubt the depression you
[1:22:30] may be seated
[1:22:31] you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:37] somebody say man when I see the blood
[1:22:41] I'll pass over you he may be seen
[1:22:45] [Applause]
[1:22:54] laughs a house people are concerned
[1:22:59] about having our refrigerator for a
[1:23:01] house a pool for the house the
[1:23:06] television for the house a car for the
[1:23:10] house now we're going back to Scripture
[1:23:13] a lamb to the house you can have a
[1:23:16] fridge but if you don't have the lamb
[1:23:18] you don't have a house the issue is that
[1:23:25] if you're renting or if you're buying or
[1:23:27] if you own or you're borrowing or you
[1:23:29] stand by somebody it's still a lamb then
[1:23:34] you've got to have for the house going
[1:23:42] back all the way to Genesis I don't know
[1:23:44] how long I'm gonna be but today we have
[1:23:46] the Lord's Supper so we here for a while
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:52] when man fell the relationship with God
[1:23:55] was broken man could no longer accept
[1:23:58] access God the way he used to because
[1:24:01] God enjoyed coming in the cool of the
[1:24:04] evening and fellowshipping with men
[1:24:06] having a conversation with man but sin
[1:24:08] is a barrier it's a wall Herman man fell
[1:24:17] he found his own way but the man who
[1:24:18] said by using the fig leaves
[1:24:20] he's one interpretation to cover up his
[1:24:22] nakedness that he was now aware of and
[1:24:26] God found an animal skin and give it to
[1:24:28] them a table ready of the blood being
[1:24:32] shed because a payment was required
[1:24:35] because sin has a consequence and once
[1:24:40] there is sim it has to be paid for
[1:24:42] somehow and the wages of sin is still
[1:24:48] death you could be in the message and
[1:24:51] dead you could be a church in dead
[1:24:54] because being in church doesn't take
[1:24:57] away the sin issue from our lives it
[1:24:59] take the transformation of our soul at
[1:25:02] an acceptance of the perfect lamb and
[1:25:05] perfect sacrifice that could take our
[1:25:08] place because if you don't accept that
[1:25:10] you have to find a way to pay
[1:25:13] so before Jesus would come for years
[1:25:17] they would pay with a lamb a lamb
[1:25:24] without blemish and I said to them and
[1:25:26] they go marching that they would check
[1:25:28] the lamb they would lift up the hairs of
[1:25:31] the lamb
[1:25:32] lift up the check
[1:25:35] slowly because this was not an act of
[1:25:40] doing it out of tradition it was
[1:25:42] supposed to be you on that altar Danny
[1:25:46] but a lamb was taking your place on it
[1:25:49] could not be a lamb with sin because it
[1:25:52] would be back in the same problem so the
[1:25:54] lamb had to be won without blemish as a
[1:25:57] type of one without sin who in the
[1:26:02] priests was satisfied when you were
[1:26:03] satisfied of this that his lamb was a
[1:26:06] perfect lamb and have no blemish then
[1:26:09] the lamb was killed and the life would
[1:26:11] leave that lemon when that life left the
[1:26:14] lung your house your life it should have
[1:26:22] been looted it's gonna bury you there
[1:26:26] but that lamb was taken your place and I
[1:26:29] preached it before there should have
[1:26:31] been a transfer because an exchange was
[1:26:36] really supposed to be taking place when
[1:26:39] that life left the lamb it should have
[1:26:41] been a life that became your life and
[1:26:43] your sin went onto that lamb but that
[1:26:45] transfer could have never taken place
[1:26:47] because you were not compatible with the
[1:26:50] lamb
[1:26:51] there was a compatibility era but when
[1:26:55] Jesus died the perfect lamb for the
[1:26:58] first time there could have been a
[1:27:00] transfer of your sins to him and his
[1:27:04] life to you I'm no longer was it
[1:27:07] covering your sin but it was bleaching
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:13] it was acting it was eliminating no one
[1:27:18] he said who is one who he caller who he
[1:27:21] call it just a fighter who we justified
[1:27:24] he has already glorified as if you never
[1:27:29] did it in the first place
[1:27:34] friends you ABCs it what was going on
[1:27:38] that mates have never happened before
[1:27:41] [Applause]
[1:27:42] can we go back to that night can we go
[1:27:47] back to that night
[1:27:49] Moses and Aaron was speaking to the
[1:27:53] people do you have to find a way to get
[1:27:57] the word out to everybody this has
[1:28:00] nothing to do with what tribe you belong
[1:28:03] to the angel is passing it has nothing
[1:28:14] to do with if you believe or don't
[1:28:16] believe it has all to do with the death
[1:28:21] angel is coming and this is a new
[1:28:25] beginning the beginning of months
[1:28:27] because for 400 years we have been in
[1:28:30] bondage and I shared with them and they
[1:28:33] go Martin after 400 years there would
[1:28:38] have been people in Egypt children of
[1:28:41] Israel in Egypt who would have just
[1:28:44] heard about the promise from their
[1:28:46] grandfathers and from their fathers
[1:28:49] after a while there would have been
[1:28:51] people who would have wondered if didn't
[1:28:53] make it out because their grandfather
[1:28:56] would have said you know there's a
[1:28:57] deliverer supposed to be coming but I
[1:28:58] don't know and he would have died
[1:29:01] in bondage and it'd be somebody there
[1:29:06] who is grandfather would have died in
[1:29:07] bondage his father would have died in
[1:29:10] Bundy that is easy if you've seen this
[1:29:12] happening around you for you to wonder
[1:29:15] if there's a chance for you to make it
[1:29:16] out to the children of Israel out there
[1:29:22] and they are watching this man called
[1:29:24] Moses do miracle after miracle sign
[1:29:29] after sign because God told Moses go
[1:29:33] down to Egypt as he let my people go and
[1:29:37] just as sister Tricia said the moment
[1:29:40] she made an effort to make it to the
[1:29:42] prayer meeting all hell broke loose
[1:29:44] and the moment Moses said let my people
[1:29:47] go
[1:29:49] Pharaoh give them work and see how given
[1:29:52] your no straw still make bricks in other
[1:29:56] words the devil is not gonna make it
[1:29:58] easy for you to get out he's not gonna
[1:30:00] make it easy for you to get away he's
[1:30:02] not gonna make it easy for you to have a
[1:30:04] revival he's not gonna make it easy for
[1:30:06] you to have a prayer life he's not gonna
[1:30:08] make it easy for you to make things
[1:30:10] right he's not gonna let you just it's
[1:30:12] not gonna happen by accident it's gonna
[1:30:14] be a fight so Moses will come and and
[1:30:17] turn the rod into sneakin and the devil
[1:30:20] will do the same thing he turned the
[1:30:22] water to blood and the devil as a
[1:30:24] responsible frogs and flies and fleas
[1:30:27] and locusts and he and everything else
[1:30:30] and it's a war that's going on it's a
[1:30:34] war that's going on but God is smiling
[1:30:36] because he knows with every step of the
[1:30:39] way he's petting his people closer to
[1:30:42] getting out of bondage
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:45] getting somebody closer to being free
[1:30:49] from the taskmaster getting somebody
[1:30:51] closer to being free and we read the
[1:30:54] scripture bring my people out so they
[1:30:57] could worship me even Moses Paul Pharaoh
[1:31:00] let my people go
[1:31:02] so that they can worship me oh come on
[1:31:07] now come on now
[1:31:08] so then when I being set free don't not
[1:31:11] have to work anymore they were not being
[1:31:13] set free just to not be slaves they were
[1:31:15] being set free to worship they were
[1:31:18] being set free from inheritance they
[1:31:20] were being set free to have a testimony
[1:31:25] but God was not interested only in their
[1:31:30] physical freedom he was interested in
[1:31:33] the freedom from sin so that's why it
[1:31:35] was a type of the Passover so blood
[1:31:38] being shed for the redemption of their
[1:31:41] souls as well and God wanted it that
[1:31:44] when they eat the lamb they were eating
[1:31:46] the sacrifice
[1:31:47] that's our tie because when Christ died
[1:31:50] that word party became the sacrifice
[1:31:52] that we consume and we are consuming
[1:31:55] this morning and he told him eat at all
[1:31:58] and we want to eat every bit of it
[1:32:00] every special every word every promise
[1:32:04] every verse every line I don't leave
[1:32:08] anything for tomorrow I want to eat it
[1:32:10] today with my staff in my hand with my
[1:32:14] loins get it because anyway we are
[1:32:17] getting out of here
[1:32:18] anything we are leaving this place and
[1:32:21] the church say man somebody give God a
[1:32:24] shout of praise Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:29] it's freedom time it's freedom time for
[1:32:33] somebody this morning
[1:32:34] and I could imagine while they were in
[1:32:38] the house there would have been children
[1:32:39] in the house they don't understand all
[1:32:42] that's going on but momma and Poppa have
[1:32:44] to tell the children boy daughter all
[1:32:47] your stuff in your hand and eat it in
[1:32:49] his don't relax and eat it we want to
[1:32:52] eat it in haste because we are getting
[1:32:54] out of here
[1:32:55] go away mama I can't tell you all of
[1:32:57] these heels but it's a promise but we
[1:32:59] gotta get out of here you'll understand
[1:33:01] it better by and by all I can tell you
[1:33:03] right now is eat in his eating isn't
[1:33:06] plenty it's at all you don't have to ask
[1:33:10] permission for seconds because we have
[1:33:12] to eat everything until it's gone keep
[1:33:15] eatin you don't need permission to eat
[1:33:20] this word this morning give me
[1:33:22] permission to claim your inheritance is
[1:33:25] spawning we want to eat we want to eat a
[1:33:28] whole roll we want to eat every promise
[1:33:31] oh come on come on
[1:33:36] hallelujah glory to God and the church
[1:33:40] say Amen if you were confused
[1:33:43] you could have still made it if you were
[1:33:45] in a house that had fulfill the request
[1:33:49] that God made let me see it again
[1:33:55] if you are just obeyed it was just like
[1:33:58] in the Genesis wim-kian and email offer
[1:34:01] their sacrifices God - okay listen if
[1:34:05] you do what your brother do you'll be
[1:34:09] all right
[1:34:09] and qiyam couldn't even do that but in
[1:34:14] that day if you had put blood on your
[1:34:16] door and obey the same instruction
[1:34:18] because the Bible says in Exodus 13
[1:34:21] around 36 37 today
[1:34:23] so where around there that a mixed
[1:34:25] multitude went out so it was not just
[1:34:31] the children of Israel that went out
[1:34:33] there were some other people who heard
[1:34:36] the rumor and heard the wood and say I
[1:34:40] don't know if you know what they're
[1:34:41] doing but what they're doing is they're
[1:34:43] getting a lamb without blemish and they
[1:34:47] are cooking this one they are putting
[1:34:49] blood on the doorpost I don't know about
[1:34:51] you but dear God is on a deliverance
[1:34:54] path I don't know how they're doing it
[1:34:56] but they turn water to blood
[1:34:59] they send fleas they send frogs his then
[1:35:02] fries
[1:35:03] this is the low level fit didn't you fit
[1:35:06] we don't know what's gonna happen but at
[1:35:08] least if we do this we have a good shot
[1:35:11] of making it
[1:35:12] [Applause]
[1:35:18] and the Bible's in a mixed multitude
[1:35:21] left Egypt that's why but the problem
[1:35:24] said that's why they had people in that
[1:35:26] group who was making the legal and thing
[1:35:28] for the Golden Calf it's from that mixed
[1:35:32] multitude you take God at His Word God
[1:35:39] is obligated to honor his word he said
[1:35:41] if you apply if I see blood apply the
[1:35:44] correct way I'll pass over you you don't
[1:35:48] even have to understand the full details
[1:35:50] of it but if I see the blood that's what
[1:35:53] I'm passing over young brother young
[1:35:56] sister you understand it by a lie but
[1:35:59] make sure that there's blood on your
[1:36:02] house make sure you apply the token on
[1:36:05] your life make sure you inspect your
[1:36:08] life this morning can the church same
[1:36:19] the time had come for their deliverance
[1:36:22] because the Bible said God heard the
[1:36:26] cries of his people by reason of their
[1:36:30] taskmasters and I can't help but reflect
[1:36:32] the sister Trish's testimony she said at
[1:36:35] one point it couldn't she could even
[1:36:37] praise she gets for herself crying and
[1:36:42] God heard a cry some time it doesn't
[1:36:46] even take words but he hears the cry he
[1:36:50] has a cry when you cry for your children
[1:36:52] he hears a cry when you cry for your
[1:36:54] situation when you feel that pain in
[1:36:57] your body and there's a cry in your soul
[1:36:58] that's has a cry he said I've heard the
[1:37:01] cries of my people and because they're
[1:37:03] my people I've come down to deliver them
[1:37:05] Anna I've got to set them free because
[1:37:08] those taskmasters have them doing what
[1:37:12] you're not supposed to be doing
[1:37:16] and the church seaman and there was a
[1:37:28] process because those terminals went
[1:37:31] through a whole fleet of emotions and
[1:37:34] because you imagine when Moses first
[1:37:36] come down and and Moses that's what I
[1:37:39] love about God God doesn't tell you the
[1:37:40] whole script he tells you just what you
[1:37:43] need to know to go forward because he be
[1:37:46] told you the whole script there's no
[1:37:48] need for trust and God wants you to
[1:37:54] trust him
[1:37:55] so Moses goes down there and when he
[1:37:58] chose the rock down Moses thought that
[1:38:00] was it enough
[1:38:03] Moses taught when he dropped that write
[1:38:05] down there Pharaoh next eprints gonna be
[1:38:07] everybody go I'm furious Ponce's Janis
[1:38:13] Jam breeze give him a demonstration
[1:38:18] enough we can do it too and on top of
[1:38:23] that go tell your people the same Talley
[1:38:28] EE Talley
[1:38:29] nostro keep working I'm Cornish doing
[1:38:33] something and each other and say Moses
[1:38:34] why I come why you come we was a
[1:38:39] prisoner no but are you gonna make it
[1:38:40] worse they don't understand God is
[1:38:47] unfallen something but at that point in
[1:38:50] time in the middle of your deliverance
[1:38:52] sometimes things just get worse
[1:38:55] but just before you break you and pray
[1:38:58] that's when the mosquitoes come that's
[1:39:00] when the pressure come just before your
[1:39:02] break truth is he hardest the darkest
[1:39:04] before dawn and mostly the stallion
[1:39:08] Tigre criticism and still keep moving
[1:39:12] because he knows something has got to
[1:39:15] come he knows the corner he met he knows
[1:39:18] what happened when he met the pillar of
[1:39:20] fire
[1:39:21] he knows the experience that he had so
[1:39:24] it didn't matter to him what anybody
[1:39:26] else said he knew that God was gonna
[1:39:28] deliver oh come on now come on now
[1:39:32] church come on our church hallelujah
[1:39:39] wasn't easy for them after 400
[1:39:41] years the pressure and increased the
[1:39:45] trials had increased the challenge had
[1:39:48] increased but they were close to getting
[1:39:50] out of there they were close to their
[1:39:52] deliverance and miracle after miracle or
[1:39:56] plague after plague however you want to
[1:39:57] look at it it depends on what side of
[1:39:59] the equation you're on miracle after
[1:40:01] miracle or plague after plague or was
[1:40:03] stripping and breaking down the
[1:40:05] situation until the last plague striking
[1:40:12] all the firstborn bought man and beast
[1:40:26] but the random priestess message that
[1:40:29] talking with her bleedin with the burden
[1:40:35] of his heart because it was a serious
[1:40:39] message and there it was and that night
[1:40:43] I could imagine and throughout all the
[1:40:44] hoses their people they are getting
[1:40:47] ready because they don't know what's
[1:40:49] gonna happen what Moses is telling them
[1:40:52] had never happened before and Brandon my
[1:40:58] name is Krishna but no I said Noah's
[1:41:00] story one of Acts no.1 daddy are you
[1:41:02] sure and I can imagine as a dead angel
[1:41:08] interpreter Langley sitting here screams
[1:41:10] coming from higher of the street and I
[1:41:15] can imagine the people in the houses
[1:41:16] were are you sure he's sure we applied
[1:41:21] it right are you sure we did everything
[1:41:25] right
[1:41:26] I saw we put everything in please
[1:41:28] because I I hear screams which means
[1:41:32] somebody that I doff my head
[1:41:35] daddy was this the right lamb daddy was
[1:41:39] there any blemish on this little daddy
[1:41:42] did we cooked in fire daddy did we eat
[1:41:45] everything daddy did you put the blood
[1:41:47] on the doorpost but the Brennan said the
[1:41:52] blood on the doorpost was a public
[1:41:55] display that you are identified with the
[1:42:00] sacrifice and when I see that public
[1:42:08] display I'll pass over you when I see
[1:42:15] the Blood I will pass over you every
[1:42:24] feast that a turn of Israel celebrated
[1:42:28] had a certain importance but this feast
[1:42:32] of the Passover was a significant one
[1:42:36] because Jesus became the very Passover
[1:42:41] what was happening in Egypt was a type
[1:42:44] of what would come many years ahead when
[1:42:50] it'll be a lamb for every house back
[1:42:57] there it was individual lambs and or
[1:42:59] blemish but when Jesus came it was a
[1:43:02] lamb singular for every house a perfect
[1:43:07] sacrifice that to take care of your
[1:43:10] family to take you of your neighbor to
[1:43:13] take care of your situation can the
[1:43:15] church cement this power in the blood
[1:43:18] this morning can the church same and but
[1:43:27] the Branham said the blood speaks it
[1:43:31] speaks a better thing God isn't
[1:43:34] interested in you say in something
[1:43:37] friends because whatever you say will
[1:43:39] never be enough but when the blood is
[1:43:42] applied the blood takes over the
[1:43:44] speaking and the blood speaks better
[1:43:47] lots of things for you better things
[1:43:50] about you
[1:43:51] but the ground said in the token it
[1:43:53] speaks a better thing the Old Testament
[1:43:56] the blood spoke of guilt in the New
[1:43:58] Testament it speaks of redemption in the
[1:44:00] Old Testament it spoke of death and
[1:44:02] sorrow but in the New Testament it
[1:44:05] speaks of resurrection and life it's
[1:44:07] peace of healing it speaks of joy it
[1:44:10] speaks of power
[1:44:11] it speaks of life it it speaks of heaven
[1:44:13] and that seemed blood that was shed up
[1:44:16] underground that call out after his dead
[1:44:19] brother the blood of Jesus covers all of
[1:44:22] our sins and speaks peace and
[1:44:25] resurrection and power and light and
[1:44:27] healing and all the redemptive blessing
[1:44:29] that the blood was shed for it speaks
[1:44:31] for us certainly it speaks can the
[1:44:34] church say man
[1:44:35] [Applause]
[1:44:39] but it is the difference now because
[1:44:43] it's not a physical house so you can't
[1:44:47] just do what somebody else to and walk
[1:44:51] out of Egypt with the crowd because
[1:44:54] other people are doing it the house is
[1:44:58] now your house it's now your tabernacle
[1:45:02] it's now you as an individual have to
[1:45:07] get a lamb for your house oh come on now
[1:45:11] somebody somebody help me somebody help
[1:45:14] me and you as your house or call it a
[1:45:18] tabernacle have to consume the lamb have
[1:45:24] to apply the token on your house so that
[1:45:27] when you walk the devil knows these are
[1:45:30] token when you walk God knows there's a
[1:45:33] token when you walk your brother knows
[1:45:36] there's a token when you walk sickness
[1:45:39] knows it's a token when you walk all
[1:45:42] hell knows there's a token and when I
[1:45:46] see the blood I'll pass over you and you
[1:45:50] can sing that song let the death angel
[1:45:52] pass I shall not be moved

[1:46:23] it you could have been born and whatever
[1:46:25] job you were born into

[1:46:30] parent said you must display the token

[1:46:35] things of the world because you can't
[1:46:37] love the things of the world all your

[1:47:04] come on Pete and this how to apply it
[1:47:06] they applied it on the door with the
[1:47:09] common faith they had and brother
[1:47:11] branham said that come on feet is the
[1:47:13] same feet it takes to start your car
[1:47:15] that is the same thing it takes that
[1:47:17] when you pick up a cup of coffee you
[1:47:19] expect that coffee to move in the cup
[1:47:21] that's faith right there that seemed

[1:47:42] husband and when brother over in a
[1:47:44] couple weeks ago spoke about getting as
[1:47:47] a family and praying together she
[1:47:49] wondered how she could do it she said
[1:47:51] she knows he's not gonna come and pray
[1:47:53] with her but she decided to take off his
[1:47:55] coat that she put on her bed and she
[1:47:57] prayed on that and she said something
[1:48:01] change he's had to get different so I
[1:48:04] said to her sister pray for the cup pay

[1:48:18] yes power in the blood yes healing in
[1:48:21] the blood just deliver us in the blood
[1:48:24] I'm not talking about the blood of bulls
[1:48:26] and goats but yes power in the blood of
[1:48:29] Jesus to break every chain break every
[1:48:33] shackle
[1:48:34] oh come on now oh you don't hear me this
[1:48:38] morning and I got good news for you you
[1:48:41] may be seated on Saturday mantilla
[1:48:42] Martin I said even if you don't know who
[1:48:45] God is the devil knows who he is because
[1:48:47] when Jesus says let us go to the other
[1:48:49] side when Jesus came off the boat and he
[1:48:53] hit the ground
[1:48:54] the spirits upon Legion the devil upon
[1:48:57] Legion recognized who he was they are
[1:49:00] people in church who don't recognize the
[1:49:03] power of God but when the Devils that
[1:49:06] were upon Elisha saw Jesus they say why
[1:49:09] have you come because you never been on
[1:49:11] this side before why have you come to
[1:49:14] torment me I've got this body here for a
[1:49:17] long time but Jesus came with an agenda
[1:49:20] he came with an agenda it's okay to have
[1:49:24] an agenda it depends on what it is Jesus
[1:49:27] came to deliver all man
[1:49:33] Oh hallelujah oh come on now come on now
[1:49:38] somebody come on now somebody that man
[1:49:42] his name was not leaves on you may be
[1:49:44] seated
[1:49:44] but the spirits that will upon him they
[1:49:47] call themselves Legion and when Jesus
[1:49:51] came do you recognize him Jesus come on
[1:49:56] devil they see we gotta go somebody trot
[1:49:57] him in the pigs this same man he was out
[1:50:01] of his mind but he was crying the Bible
[1:50:03] said because he knew that deliverance
[1:50:05] just like the children of Israel he was
[1:50:07] crying
[1:50:08] it's gonna be a cry there's gonna be a
[1:50:11] crying your soul for something more than
[1:50:13] just coming to church it's gonna be a
[1:50:15] cry it's okay to have problems but if
[1:50:18] the problems come with a cry no
[1:50:20] something could happen about the problem
[1:50:22] because God responds to the cries of his
[1:50:25] people that man called Legion
[1:50:28] he had a cry there was a meaningless
[1:50:30] soul there was enough of him left inside
[1:50:34] a deer you know why because the devil
[1:50:37] can never destroy the seed that God
[1:50:40] place in your soul that they will try to
[1:50:42] dig his mind he tried to take his body
[1:50:44] he typed it oh you don't hear me this
[1:50:47] morning but the seat of the soul the
[1:50:49] devil couldn't take it out so that she'd
[1:50:52] when it recognized that Messiah was on
[1:50:55] the earth he was pulsing option Jesus
[1:50:59] had to respond
[1:51:02] oh you don't hear me this morning you
[1:51:06] may be seated
[1:51:07] Oh somebody please back to me somebody
[1:51:11] please back to me this morning I got
[1:51:15] some good news for you you may be seated
[1:51:16] in every plane there's something called
[1:51:20] a black box so that whenever the plane
[1:51:23] crashes the black box is like a homing
[1:51:26] device so that the rescue team could
[1:51:31] come and find wherever the crashes even
[1:51:34] gonna get to the homing device the black
[1:51:37] box he didn't find out what happened so
[1:51:43] God is what it was a world he knew what
[1:51:45] he was sending you out into so he put up
[1:51:48] box in your soul and put a seed and
[1:51:53] listen whenever something goes wrong
[1:52:00] catbots
[1:52:01] he gets a pulse ping ping ping ping it's
[1:52:06] a distress signal something's not right
[1:52:09] and whenever you in trouble that signal
[1:52:12] goes ping ping ping
[1:52:17] you may be seated so Jesus is preaching
[1:52:20] and while he's preaching he's hearing
[1:52:23] Bing Bing Bing the Bible said he was
[1:52:27] tired he told him let us go to the other
[1:52:30] side
[1:52:30] Bing Bing he is sleeping on the boat
[1:52:33] they don't know what's going on but a
[1:52:36] homing device has been activated and I
[1:52:40] believe this morning a device has been
[1:52:42] activated deep in the socket of your
[1:52:45] soul and God is obligated to respond to
[1:52:50] the cries of his people
[1:52:52] [Applause]
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:53:01] you maybe seen it for a minute
[1:53:05] [Applause]
[1:53:06] you know what I love about the black box
[1:53:08] you don't have to manually turn it on it
[1:53:14] comes on for itself so when you're in
[1:53:18] trouble the seed in your soul it speaks
[1:53:21] for itself it's like that kind of I will
[1:53:24] restore see the Lord see all the years

[1:54:05] [Applause]
[1:54:19] could be take something off
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:28] [Applause]
[1:54:38] from the schedule you add the word about
[1:54:42] the Passover took effect from the time
[1:54:46] of Moses and to this day it is still in
[1:54:50] effect because the ordinance was given
[1:54:54] forever however by the time Jesus came
[1:55:03] the people had lost the sincerity
[1:55:09] history tells us that the even started
[1:55:13] to commercialize the lamb chicken
[1:55:20] they became casual about the sacrifice
[1:55:25] of a lamb for me too there were men who
[1:55:31] would have projected away the sincerity
[1:55:38] of that process of because the checking
[1:55:41] of the lamb for blemish was your
[1:55:43] opportunity to also do your own
[1:55:45] reflection
[1:55:47] am i living right am I did I make things
[1:55:51] right did I did I offend this person I
[1:55:53] say Lord have theirs anyway than me that
[1:55:56] shouldn't be there Lord take it out is
[1:55:58] because I should be there but this lamb
[1:56:01] has taken my place it was supposed to be
[1:56:04] a solemn sacred event but men attended
[1:56:10] and it lost its importance its
[1:56:12] sacredness and Jesus would have none of
[1:56:17] it
[1:56:18] no I'm not you turn over the tabernacle
[1:56:22] and said you have turned my father's
[1:56:23] house into a den of thieves
[1:56:26] we have become too casual about this
[1:56:30] thing we take it for granted
[1:56:33] Feast of Tabernacles feast of passover
[1:56:36] feast of unleavened bread
[1:56:37] fees and everybody have a visa it's an
[1:56:40] event in fact when Jesus was left in the
[1:56:44] temple was a feast brought him there and
[1:56:47] he was so focused on the feast and the
[1:56:50] event that they forgot Jesus talked
[1:56:55] about coming to church and forget why I
[1:56:56] come to church it took them treat is to
[1:57:00] recognize a Mary where Jesus Joe I
[1:57:06] thought you had him treat is it's so
[1:57:15] caught up in the feast and the
[1:57:18] celebration that you forget Jesus and
[1:57:20] when they go back they find Jesus
[1:57:22] surrounded by Eliz high priests
[1:57:27] ministers taking notes as Jesus
[1:57:32] expounding the word to them and when
[1:57:34] they say well Jesus but but ya know he
[1:57:36] left on come he said don't you know I'm
[1:57:38] supposed to be about my father's
[1:57:39] business
[1:57:45] so people have become casual and the
[1:57:48] question is have we become casual
[1:57:56] meditate on the word day and night
[1:58:02] you see when something becomes necessary
[1:58:06] for your survival it tells a lot about
[1:58:12] what you deem important by what you
[1:58:14] prioritize there are people who are
[1:58:18] faithful about taking their medication
[1:58:21] because they understand that if you
[1:58:23] don't take it something could go wrong
[1:58:26] heart medication high blood pressure
[1:58:29] medication you don't mess with them when
[1:58:31] it come time to take that pill and this
[1:58:34] gospel which has power to heal the heart
[1:58:38] condition

[1:58:41] regularize the low blood pressure
[1:58:44] [Applause]

[1:58:50] the doctor told us take it every day
[1:58:54] take it in the morning take it in the
[1:58:57] nighttime and unlike other medications

[1:59:28] nobody can mess with you these men are
[1:59:30] not drunk as you suppose it's nine

[1:59:48] him you can get drunk anytime
[1:59:55] hallelujah I said it in the go Martin to
[2:00:04] see a doctor you need to make an
[2:00:05] appointment God hated that thing man but
[2:00:11] when he died he ran the veal from top to
[2:00:13] bottom
[2:00:14] he removed this please the role of the
[2:00:16] high priests he could walk in and there
[2:00:19] anytime you want their stories there's
[2:00:21] no secretary there's no permission it's

[2:00:35] lord have mercy on me
[2:00:38] Oh somebody please back to me a lamb for
[2:00:42] every house
[2:00:44] [Applause]
[2:00:54] you see the problem is and I'm seeing it
[2:00:58] so clearly our same with brother over a
[2:01:00] few years ago but the brand up is a
[2:01:02] message convinced and concerned before
[2:01:05] you can get concerned you must be
[2:01:08] convinced you cannot have a burden for
[2:01:11] anything unless you are convinced with
[2:01:14] [Applause]
[2:01:17] being convinced is the prerequisite to
[2:01:20] be in concerned if you don't see the
[2:01:24] possibility of something happening you
[2:01:27] will never make preparation for it but
[2:01:30] whenever you get convinced that
[2:01:32] something could happen a certain way
[2:01:34] listen nobody could change your mind
[2:01:37] when you are convinced
[2:01:40] no wonder the bugs aren't fully
[2:01:42] persuaded I don't know who it have to
[2:01:45] tell it but I am fully persuaded that
[2:01:47] not in present nothing to come nothing -
[2:01:53] fully persuaded guess not doubt in my
[2:01:57] soul that we can have a 7-ton revival
[2:01:59] I'm fully persuaded that the black
[2:02:02] spiders in this church could be fully
[2:02:04] delivered not bad deliverance not may be
[2:02:08] delivered but I'm fully persuaded that
[2:02:11] Molokai for some message has not fallen
[2:02:14] to the ground but there are people on
[2:02:17] the land who are not yet messenger but
[2:02:20] with the final voice to the final age
[2:02:23] I'm fully persuaded
[2:02:27] [Applause]
[2:02:34] that the blood could never lose its
[2:02:37] power I'm persuaded that he is still a
[2:02:42] deliverer
[2:02:43] I'm fully persuaded no doubt in my mind
[2:02:46] no question in my mind because he said
[2:02:50] he kind of changed he kind of make a
[2:02:52] mistake he didn't call you by accident
[2:02:54] he didn't call you by chance he didn't
[2:02:57] put your name in blood by accident he
[2:03:03] may be seated
[2:03:06] and to show how serious he is about this
[2:03:11] business
[2:03:12] he actually said the lamb was slain
[2:03:13] before the foundation of the world so
[2:03:18] the blood was shed was not shed in a
[2:03:20] response to what you did it was shed in
[2:03:22] Antibes in anticipation of the mistakes
[2:03:26] you would make and yet still God said
[2:03:28] you you with all your mistakes you know
[2:03:34] no not a person next to you I'm calling
[2:03:38] you and I'm gonna give you a new heart
[2:03:40] I'm gonna give you a new spirit I'm
[2:03:43] gonna put my spirit in there
[2:03:45] [Applause]
[2:03:55] you know what the Prophet said for the
[2:03:58] devil to get to you he has to come under
[2:04:01] the blood and he cannot come under the
[2:04:06] blood
[2:04:06] oh you don't hear me this morning or you
[2:04:10] don't hear me this morning because if
[2:04:12] the devil came under the blood you be
[2:04:14] your brother but the devil is not your
[2:04:15] brother I'm gonna need two blood the
[2:04:18] devil to you no harm
[2:04:19] oh you don't hear me this morning you
[2:04:23] don't hear me this morning you see the
[2:04:25] mistake we make is weeping this 16
[2:04:27] elements is who we are this is not who
[2:04:29] we are
[2:04:30] God cannot put you in anybody oh you
[2:04:33] don't hear me this morning the real you
[2:04:36] is the soul that's seen in the soul oh
[2:04:41] you don't hear me this table to watch
[2:04:44] you but he can't touch you
[2:04:46] [Applause]
[2:04:55] somebody get gonna shout of praise
[2:04:57] somebody give Him glory somebody say
[2:05:00] hallelujah isn't it good to know that
[2:05:03] your family is going to be delivered
[2:05:06] isn't it wonderful to know your wife is
[2:05:09] going to be set free after all these
[2:05:12] years your husband your children all
[2:05:18] these years you're holding on rolling on
[2:05:21] in Egypt holding on in Egypt and while
[2:05:25] you're holding on corners preparing a
[2:05:27] deliverer oh you know what's even better
[2:05:32] in the days of Moses God came down and
[2:05:37] he sent Moses he said I have come down
[2:05:40] but you were gonna go but this time the
[2:05:45] Lord Himself descended and when he sent
[2:05:50] the Prophet home the mighty angel - want
[2:05:54] me to step back wings - Lord Himself he
[2:05:59] stayed
[2:06:01] to lead the deliverance charge himself
[2:06:04] because this is the final Exodus oh you
[2:06:07] don't hear me this morning this was not
[2:06:09] the work of a prophet anymore
[2:06:11] this is not the work of a man anymore
[2:06:14] this is God himself
[2:06:17] the Lord Jesus himself the very angel of
[2:06:21] the covenant him down to lead the final
[2:06:25] Exodus hallelujah he may be seated
[2:06:35] [Applause]
[2:06:37] you could imagine when Moses said the
[2:06:40] Egyptians you see today you will see
[2:06:45] them no more forever the Lord Himself is
[2:06:52] waiting to make a declaration that is
[2:06:56] devil that you have seen for all these
[2:06:58] centuries you will see him no more
[2:07:00] because Satan will be bound round in a
[2:07:05] chain you have no room to move because
[2:07:09] all the love of God will be wrapped up
[2:07:11] in a bride and oh come on now there
[2:07:14] there'll be no room do you understand
[2:07:16] that if there's no room for the devil in
[2:07:18] your heart in your mind the devil is
[2:07:19] crippled here
[2:07:20] [Applause]
[2:07:22] just as God needs somebody to use the
[2:07:25] devil needs somebody to use but when you
[2:07:28] start to project so much love because
[2:07:30] the devil can't exist where is love
[2:07:32] perfect love casts out fear perfect love
[2:07:34] cast out thought perfect love casts on
[2:07:37] unbelief
[2:07:37] when love oh come on now Sovereign Grace
[2:07:41] takes over the devil have to look for
[2:07:45] another vessel so we want to have the
[2:07:48] kind of church where there's so much
[2:07:49] love that that there's no room for the
[2:07:51] devil to move never wrekonize not this
[2:07:53] church not this house not this family
[2:07:57] there's no room for him in this place we
[2:08:00] only have room for adoption we only have
[2:08:03] room for perfection we only have room
[2:08:05] for the promises of Cory only one of the
[2:08:08] only words in our tongue is revival and
[2:08:10] and deliverance and breakthrough and
[2:08:13] overcoming and trampling the necks of
[2:08:17] the enemy and that's what we love to
[2:08:19] talk about the politics such a fade it
[2:08:22] doesn't mean anything anymore because
[2:08:24] you're looking towards getting out of
[2:08:26] here because your loins are girded your
[2:08:28] stuff in your hand
[2:08:31] [Applause]
[2:08:37] can the church same Oh Lord Magus
[2:08:45] present tends to us the challenge for
[2:08:50] most of us is we could come to service
[2:08:54] on a Sunday and we get encouragement the
[2:08:57] problem is not that the problem is
[2:09:00] Monday
[2:09:03] the problem is Tuesday
[2:09:06] the problem is Wednesday the problem is
[2:09:10] what I've always called between Sunday's
[2:09:16] because once the word goes forth with
[2:09:18] power and clarity the devil someone who
[2:09:21] came here if you didn't have your reason
[2:09:22] to feel lighter because light and
[2:09:25] darkness kind of live in the same house
[2:09:27] when you put on a light any cockroach
[2:09:29] anything have to go because it cannot
[2:09:31] live when he light is on and the world
[2:09:33] itself is light so when you come into
[2:09:35] the presence of God you will
[2:09:37] automatically feel better even if you
[2:09:39] didn't want to feel better even if your
[2:09:41] somebody dragged your young or get
[2:09:42] drag that you just won you feel him at
[2:09:44] all ready because I think in fact that
[2:09:46] he has on you
[2:09:47] [Applause]
[2:09:50] that's why the progress that we ought to
[2:09:52] be the happiest people a new face of the
[2:09:54] earth because every Sunday you get what
[2:09:58] other people wish they could get you get
[2:10:01] a whole basket of joy and peace price
[2:10:05] man to have it Massey stores will have
[2:10:08] it you could come in and fill it up your
[2:10:11] how much you want with a problem some
[2:10:22] time ago I was in a meeting with a job
[2:10:24] interview and a young man said I'm a
[2:10:27] good worker and stuff in a way see thing
[2:10:29] is though if something happened to me it
[2:10:31] is a figment you see so if somebody my
[2:10:33] bad drive all day I upset somebody give
[2:10:39] you a bad drive and we must suffer you
[2:10:41] hold it because you is now you give me
[2:10:46] by driving somebody give you an that
[2:10:47] affect you for you holding and how many
[2:10:53] of us we rejoice with the world and then
[2:10:55] something happens and listen it's not
[2:10:58] like you supposed to be surprised the
[2:10:59] devil has a job
[2:11:03] some people pick it before like it's
[2:11:05] like oh she won't believe me trial every
[2:11:12] day you have a trial coming and for some
[2:11:20] special people is more than one and for
[2:11:24] some very special people is more than
[2:11:25] two and for some very very slight it's
[2:11:28] like more than three four that's why
[2:11:33] when you see one of the runs Sunday
[2:11:34] should give them a big smile and shake
[2:11:36] hands because there are some survivors
[2:11:38] who made it through a war zone
[2:11:43] landmines
[2:11:44] greenies rocket launchers the swamp
[2:11:48] truest see the parachute or the airplane
[2:11:52] bottle hot and heavy but you know what
[2:11:56] he made a wing he kept you
[2:12:00] [Applause]
[2:12:06] I listen to sister Trish's testimony but
[2:12:12] he said she felt so bad she felt
[2:12:13] suicidal the Prophet took a gun to his
[2:12:18] head
[2:12:21] God was already working with him and he
[2:12:26] felt like he couldn't go on anymore
[2:12:30] it was not a thought to him he pulled
[2:12:34] the trigger
[2:12:35] and God jammed it because God says you
[2:12:40] are ready to go yet yes to work for you
[2:12:43] to do so stop feeling sorry for yourself
[2:12:47] and cut up your loins what you have in
[2:12:50] your hands because I got a people that
[2:12:54] got to come out of Egypt
[2:12:59] for the Panama's our losses but he had
[2:13:02] his Valley he had his little moments but
[2:13:05] when it counted he said I see a bride
[2:13:08] coming into view I see your people I see
[2:13:12] a church marching in step I see the
[2:13:16] promise man coming into view so close I
[2:13:20] can almost feel it service is that time
[2:13:23] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:13:30] somebody give got us out appraised
[2:13:33] [Applause]
[2:13:50] something has to click on the inside
[2:13:53] that manifests on the outside it's not
[2:13:57] the outside in it has to be inside out
[2:14:02] that's why young brother young sister
[2:14:05] mama Papa prayed for God to give you a
[2:14:08] revelation of who you are of who he is
[2:14:12] of what the token is of how to live this
[2:14:16] gospel what works in Luther's day will
[2:14:23] not work in this thing what work in
[2:14:25] Wesley's day will not work in this day
[2:14:27] oh come on now in each day they have to
[2:14:31] display the message of VAD not in our
[2:14:39] day we have to display everything
[2:14:43] because all that was in all ages have
[2:14:46] been gathered up to this age when God
[2:14:51] was looking at people to put in ages
[2:14:54] imagine god looked at Wesley looked at
[2:14:57] better Ganguly and say you know one
[2:14:59] Wesley in this age and put real economy
[2:15:01] in this age good it is harder never put
[2:15:03] Wesley here he can't make it
[2:15:07] [Applause]
[2:15:12] there's a reason where a Joshua that
[2:15:14] Court put you in this age oh he could
[2:15:17] not have put anybody in this ditch in
[2:15:20] this age when the lid of hell is open
[2:15:23] and streams of demon powers
[2:15:28] [Applause]
[2:15:33] God looked at a brownie say Abraham
[2:15:35] father of missions I'll put you here
[2:15:37] Moses I'll put you here Jeff tyre put
[2:15:40] you here pizza perfect
[2:15:42] I'll put you when I come down I'll be
[2:15:44] there with you oh god help me
[2:15:46] but who do I put in 2018 with all the
[2:15:51] technology and all the music and all the
[2:15:54] styles and all the fashion and all the
[2:15:57] pornography and all the stuff on the
[2:15:59] phones and the tablets and the internet
[2:16:02] and 4G are my G who do I put who can I
[2:16:08] put who can I put
[2:16:12] [Applause]
[2:16:15] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:16:22] mama mama mind when the devil bring out
[2:16:26] his best but the panel said the devil
[2:16:29] came into God's Eden but now it's
[2:16:32] shaytans Eden he has built it up with
[2:16:38] the best of everything
[2:16:39] I'm going to seeing I've gotta save the
[2:16:42] best for last
[2:16:43] [Applause]
[2:16:47] you may be seated friends but the
[2:16:52] Branham takes it oh I feel comfortable
[2:16:56] but they're attached dude he said like
[2:16:58] it was the light being shown on the wood
[2:17:00] so he said in Luther's day when he's
[2:17:02] shown he only saw certain things and
[2:17:04] when Wesley came it was a brighter light
[2:17:07] so he saw more than what Wesley saw and
[2:17:13] when the Prophet came he shunned more
[2:17:16] light revealed everything but within
[2:17:23] what he revealed there was certain
[2:17:25] things that are hidden that he said
[2:17:28] there'll be men come to make more sense
[2:17:30] of it and to make sure nobody just gets
[2:17:35] it rapture and features laying there one
[2:17:39] day you'll recognize what it is but he
[2:17:41] had to say it for us to be able to
[2:17:43] connect with it so our young people know
[2:17:49] more than Wesley our young people know
[2:17:54] more than Luther so you understand why
[2:17:57] the devil is afraid of you
[2:18:01] but knowledge is not what it would take
[2:18:05] to defeat the enemy belief is not what
[2:18:09] it will take to defeat the enemy because
[2:18:11] the Bible tells us even the devil
[2:18:13] believes so if knowledge and belief was
[2:18:17] good enough then we make it but
[2:18:19] unfortunately that's not the case it
[2:18:21] takes something more than knowledge it
[2:18:23] takes something more than belief do I
[2:18:26] have all knowledge do I know mysteries
[2:18:29] do I give my body to be burned and have
[2:18:31] not charity there's got to be something
[2:18:35] more that we get that separates us from
[2:18:39] everybody else not by our choosing not
[2:18:43] by our merit not by our ability but by
[2:18:47] the grace of God because he's had a
[2:18:49] headstone will come with Shelton's of
[2:18:52] grace grace grace grace
[2:18:55] [Applause]
[2:18:58] so we are here by grace this morning
[2:19:01] [Applause]
[2:19:08] [Applause]
[2:19:12] somebody give God a shout of praise
[2:19:15] [Applause]
[2:19:25] so it's grace that has spoken our hearts
[2:19:29] but the grace that has spoken our hearts
[2:19:32] a message scheme wrapped in Greece
[2:19:37] because it was just Greece that you have
[2:19:41] nothing to do in the issue then the
[2:19:45] nature of man is to sit back so that's
[2:19:48] why in the script you read it in haste
[2:19:53] this has to be a consciousness of
[2:19:56] urgency in other words God is saying
[2:19:59] don't be relaxed about this thing what
[2:20:03] have you do to quickly do it with
[2:20:04] seriousness do it with the mindset of
[2:20:07] preparation because if we get relaxed
[2:20:10] that's where the enemy comes in and the
[2:20:14] problem with many of us we have taken
[2:20:16] off the pressure on the devil in our
[2:20:18] lives
[2:20:21] you know recall that would compromise
[2:20:28] compromise we find so many ways to
[2:20:31] compromise and after a while but the
[2:20:36] Branham said when that still small voice
[2:20:37] tells you don't do something don't do
[2:20:40] something don't do something he said
[2:20:42] every time you ignore it that voice gets
[2:20:46] softer and softer until you become
[2:20:48] insensitive to that still small voice
[2:20:52] and then you don't hear it anymore
[2:20:55] because you have silenced that voice
[2:20:57] that's why brother Branham taught us and
[2:20:59] it's a word to the young people world to
[2:21:02] the church if there's a question in your
[2:21:05] mind about something don't do it
[2:21:09] should I go to my school thing we have
[2:21:12] anything I wanna guess you go mommy get
[2:21:14] the one nervous ago leave it alone
[2:21:18] the co-workers and work they say as well
[2:21:21] every Friday a little is a little lime
[2:21:23] is nine serious the moment you have a
[2:21:27] question if it will compromise your
[2:21:29] testimony
[2:21:30] don't do it the browser says stay away
[2:21:39] from shady places every place look
[2:21:42] cheery you don't need to get
[2:21:46] confirmation if it is we have to be
[2:21:50] shady verification business the very
[2:21:53] same I wish on the very appearance it
[2:21:55] don't have to be real but even appear to
[2:21:58] be evil there are movies and shows and
[2:22:06] books and magazines and all kinds of
[2:22:09] stuff but people get into their lives
[2:22:12] but the problem see when you apply in
[2:22:15] the token you can apply the token and
[2:22:18] keep these things in the house
[2:22:20] [Applause]
[2:22:25] in other words in that day if you had
[2:22:28] got the lamb at 11:00 got a lamb without
[2:22:31] blemish and you didn't cook it right or
[2:22:32] you eat it raw and put your blood you
[2:22:34] actually broke the instruction and this
[2:22:37] is the point I want to get people say it
[2:22:39] has I've just put the blood but the
[2:22:41] blood was been applied with instructions
[2:22:46] so I kill a lamb you put the blood here
[2:22:49] cooking Lamia Eden Lamia how could God
[2:22:54] honor that because he was structuring in
[2:22:57] a certain way and full obedience to the
[2:23:05] entire word is what entitles you to the
[2:23:10] token so when we compromise on this and
[2:23:16] that and this is the greatest compromise
[2:23:18] didn't see brother so-and-so doing it
[2:23:22] yes his sister so and so yes see we
[2:23:25] passed the daughter pastor's son I
[2:23:27] trained myself under the bus don't use
[2:23:29] me as your reason oh come on now Oh
[2:23:32] somebody preach back to me
[2:23:34] [Applause]
[2:23:36] but if brother Isaac that has nothing to
[2:23:39] do with it make your calling and
[2:23:41] election sure when lord it was it was
[2:23:44] the pastor wife threw me off oh come on
[2:23:49] somebody preached back to me no excuses
[2:23:55] for house
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:23:59] Claude is no respecter of persons he may
[2:24:05] receive it I heard a preacher say one
[2:24:08] time coral fire you and not even tell
[2:24:10] you saw one was fired and still only
[2:24:14] truth and God already working with David
[2:24:17] because God is about his business and he
[2:24:20] about his world and anybody else he's
[2:24:22] promised your plans will be loaded
[2:24:24] there's only one person in Chile that
[2:24:26] make it Lord let that person be me you
[2:24:36] have to look to the world yourself
[2:24:39] that's why I love how Paul said it he
[2:24:41] said follow me as I follow Christ so he
[2:24:44] even put a restriction on following him
[2:24:46] because he said if I step out of line
[2:24:49] abandon me one time we look to flesh so
[2:24:54] much that we miss Jesus is the focus
[2:24:59] so the moment a man makes a mistake your
[2:25:02] whole boat or over you under the boat
[2:25:04] you don't know where the engine is but
[2:25:09] we love with respect there many people
[2:25:12] the brother who baptized your pastor
[2:25:14] he left Church it doesn't mean he wasn't
[2:25:18] baptized but God used him at that time
[2:25:21] and at that season so God will use
[2:25:26] people but don't piss your salvation or
[2:25:31] your testimony or your prayer life or
[2:25:34] your commitment on anybody it's a lamb
[2:25:37] for a house make sure your house is in
[2:25:42] order
[2:25:42] [Applause]
[2:25:46] but a Branham said there are three kinds
[2:25:49] of believers in every Church there's no
[2:25:52] church immune their church as I said
[2:25:54] this is the church where the angel is
[2:25:57] this is the church and with the Branham
[2:26:00] says in every Church there trait kinds
[2:26:03] of believers and these are believers
[2:26:09] this is not dealing with people in the
[2:26:11] church who are unbelievers alone he
[2:26:15] deliberately believers which are they
[2:26:16] also unbelievers I think a few people
[2:26:19] got that so they are unbelievers it is
[2:26:24] there it does do even believe and that's
[2:26:28] why you have to really can I talk of it
[2:26:31] really search God because it troubles me
[2:26:34] when I say I'm in that chair but I don't
[2:26:36] believe everything why are they because
[2:26:42] you're not a believer you're not even
[2:26:44] making it to the chickens but within the
[2:26:50] believer that chick and make believer
[2:26:53] unbelievable even any true believers so
[2:26:56] you can't judge a church by its
[2:26:58] individuals you have to judge a church
[2:27:02] by how it steers with the wood because
[2:27:06] the word is the absolute not the idea
[2:27:10] not a dream it's a vision of the
[2:27:12] supposition of the suggestion that's the
[2:27:14] argument that he beat that's what
[2:27:15] happening in news yesterday not what
[2:27:17] happened in North Korea that is not the
[2:27:19] word the word is God and God is
[2:27:22] consistent everywhere because yet I am
[2:27:26] God and I changed not
[2:27:28] and to settle the debate he sends
[2:27:31] prophets who are his MO peace whoo and
[2:27:35] this week they're not speaking for
[2:27:36] themselves they are speaking the very
[2:27:38] thoughts of God to establish a plumb
[2:27:42] line by which everything else is
[2:27:44] measured and it's upon that foundation
[2:27:53] that is set by the prophets and the
[2:27:55] apostles we can now stand and look up
[2:27:58] because our Redemption draweth nigh
[2:28:00] because we have clarity of purpose
[2:28:03] clarity of vision clarity of where we
[2:28:06] have come from and where we are going
[2:28:09] can the church shame the children of
[2:28:18] Israel did it in form and function by
[2:28:24] applying the blood on the door but those
[2:28:26] people who did that did not even make it
[2:28:28] to the promised land so this day is
[2:28:35] different because applying it now makes
[2:28:40] you a candidate for the promised land
[2:28:44] apply the token is you starting to step
[2:28:47] into the promise of this holy ghost land
[2:28:50] because what was expected of them is
[2:28:53] different than what is expected of us we
[2:28:56] have a promise of adoption we have a
[2:28:59] promise of power but the Branham said
[2:29:01] right now we lay hands on the sick but
[2:29:04] when that time comes we'll command The
[2:29:06] Devil's
[2:29:09] these stubborn Devils who want to give
[2:29:11] resistance when that time coming
[2:29:12] wouldn't be praying anymore
[2:29:14] it'll be devil get out he said you
[2:29:17] wouldn't even have to say in Jesus name
[2:29:19] because Christ himself will be
[2:29:21] tabernacle in individuals he said the
[2:29:23] pillar of fire will rest on the
[2:29:26] shoulders of a top dead sons of God God
[2:29:30] Himself it was the pillar of fire that
[2:29:33] was in pizza topping 16 elements is that
[2:29:44] your expectation is that your prayers at
[2:29:46] your desire let me try to find a place
[2:29:50] to close out this woman but friends I
[2:29:53] want you to take this to heart don't
[2:29:56] take it for granted friends my prayers
[2:30:01] that you get convinced and then
[2:30:03] concerned because God did only bless you
[2:30:07] if you make room for the blessing it's
[2:30:11] like taking the valley full of ditches
[2:30:13] you can take a small ditch and get a
[2:30:15] little bit of water or you can take a
[2:30:18] filled out of your life and make room
[2:30:21] for so much water
[2:30:27] it's your choice God is a gentleman she
[2:30:32] I stand at the door and knock
[2:30:35] he's not breaking on nobody door
[2:30:38] he said if any man here open the door
[2:30:42] welcoming I'll come in and sup with him
[2:30:44] I've come in and fellowship with him
[2:30:46] have you made time for him this week
[2:30:49] have you made time for him yesterday did
[2:30:52] you make time for him the day before did
[2:30:54] you make time for him in your life on
[2:30:57] your job I'm just going to talk a little
[2:31:00] bit then we call the musicians up
[2:31:02] because Jesus preached he also talked to
[2:31:05] the people can Jesus take control of
[2:31:08] your house and do what he wants with it
[2:31:12] I'm just talking to you a little bit
[2:31:17] personally it's hard to have a favorite
[2:31:20] character in Scripture but for me it's
[2:31:23] it's Peter
[2:31:23] I just love Peter Peter for me is it's a
[2:31:28] breathtaking refreshing up-and-down
[2:31:31] experience of Peter goes from completely
[2:31:35] one extreme to the next all the time but
[2:31:46] could Jesus take control of your life
[2:31:48] and use it and when you read the Bible
[2:31:50] and this applies to your school your
[2:31:52] life your marriage your house everything
[2:31:53] I'm just talking now I'm not preaching
[2:31:54] anymore and for those in the internet
[2:31:57] who will see this God richly bless you
[2:31:58] I'm at home talking here at home Peter
[2:32:05] had finished fishing caught nothing
[2:32:07] the Bible said he was washing his nests
[2:32:10] we talked about this before I just wanna
[2:32:11] slow down a little bit and the Bible
[2:32:15] said when Jesus came he stepped into
[2:32:20] Peters boat pull it away from the shore
[2:32:25] and started to talk to the people in
[2:32:29] other words Peters life the mechanism
[2:32:36] even used for business to provide for
[2:32:39] his family
[2:32:40] Jesus was able to take control of it and
[2:32:42] I want to bring it personally can Jesus
[2:32:46] take control of your house Jesus command
[2:32:52] here as a term his vehicle and used it
[2:32:56] to preach Peter didn't choose to come to
[2:33:00] service that day he was packing up to go
[2:33:02] home and well because it's his board
[2:33:04] here and he couldn't leave so Peter
[2:33:07] ended up stuck in a church service
[2:33:09] because Jesus commandeer his boat and
[2:33:12] was teaching the people can Jesus
[2:33:15] commandeer your car can take control of
[2:33:20] your business your house your life your
[2:33:22] marriage
[2:33:23] can you walk into is your boat in a
[2:33:26] condition that he could sit in because
[2:33:28] Jesus out of all the ports that were
[2:33:31] available he chose Peters boat to sit in
[2:33:34] and to use it as his pulpit talk about
[2:33:38] putting Peter on the spot and having a
[2:33:40] public display because now Peter they're
[2:33:43] associated with this creature and Peter
[2:33:45] is not yet converted this is before
[2:33:46] Pizza is told to follow me
[2:33:48] I wonder how Peter was thinking why
[2:33:51] Jesus is preaching because this is
[2:33:53] Peters boat his business his livelihood
[2:33:56] his testimony and he is there and Jesus
[2:33:59] is teaching Jesus is preaching and Peter
[2:34:04] is there any saber Whitner potentials no
[2:34:06] way I didn't know Peter was with Jesus
[2:34:12] but Jesus is teaching so much and when
[2:34:14] he's done is when he tells Peter Peter
[2:34:17] casseon nets back in the water and now
[2:34:23] Peter has a choice and the choice Peter
[2:34:26] has is and he makes a choice the Bible
[2:34:28] said he cast one net the instruction was
[2:34:31] can see a nets plural Peter made a
[2:34:34] choice to cast one net and when he put
[2:34:38] that one you have a choice you always
[2:34:40] have a choice
[2:34:40] what Peters choice said was I heard your
[2:34:45] message the chapter before Peters
[2:34:48] mother-in-law was healed I spoken this
[2:34:49] before so I saw my mother-in-law healed
[2:34:52] I heard you turn water into wine because
[2:34:55] this is the earliest part of Jesus
[2:34:56] ministry so I have enough believe that
[2:34:58] something had happened and it's a
[2:35:00] hundred percent convinced because if he
[2:35:02] was a hundred percent convinced he would
[2:35:03] have done what Jesus said and through
[2:35:05] all the myths but I heard enough to take
[2:35:10] some action so he put one net in the
[2:35:13] water and the Bible says there was so
[2:35:15] much fish that the net broke and he had
[2:35:19] to call for other boats to come
[2:35:27] what are the experiences that God must
[2:35:30] carry you through to bring you to the
[2:35:33] point of being convinced because when
[2:35:37] Peter saw that he was so convinced he
[2:35:40] didn't even speak about the catch he
[2:35:43] said Lord forgive me
[2:35:46] depart from me I'm a sinful man he went
[2:35:50] beyond the natural and saw his spiritual
[2:35:54] condition and then jesus said come
[2:35:58] follow me and pizza walks off the boat
[2:36:03] leave the biggest catch of his fishing
[2:36:06] career began he didn't worry who was
[2:36:10] gonna eat it was gonna sell it was gonna
[2:36:12] buy it
[2:36:12] Pizza where you going I don't know Peter
[2:36:16] how you're gonna eat if this man could
[2:36:18] get fish too and I don't know there's no
[2:36:19] fish I'm not worried about that I'm
[2:36:23] gonna follow he went from being
[2:36:25] partially convinced to being fully
[2:36:28] convinced
[2:36:30] to being fully persuaded pizza I call
[2:36:36] him a man of extremes Jesus walking on
[2:36:43] water Peter would say Lord if that is
[2:36:46] you with us
[2:36:48] Laura dies you wave Peter says Lord as
[2:36:53] you bid me come
[2:36:56] that's Peter because he is so convinced
[2:36:59] now that he walks out the boot and
[2:37:02] begins to walk the G until he recognized
[2:37:04] wait a minute this is a little much for
[2:37:07] me but he was willing to try Jesus but
[2:37:13] the problem said you could be fearless
[2:37:14] and reckless and feet some of us are too
[2:37:17] timid to afraid Peter a man if extreme
[2:37:22] that's a three and a half years I said
[2:37:23] it in dig imagine Jesus there a Garden
[2:37:26] of Gethsemane after three and a half
[2:37:28] years of good preaching
[2:37:29] there's no preacher like Jesus the best
[2:37:33] response that Peter could get is to pull
[2:37:35] out a blade and chop off a man yes
[2:37:37] [Music]
[2:37:42] and Jesus didn't punish him
[2:37:47] because jesus knew what he was going
[2:37:49] through Jesus picks up the air and puts
[2:37:52] it back
[2:37:53] science and he talked about alternative
[2:37:55] and surgery going on and this doctor did
[2:37:57] this surgery this doctor fix this in one
[2:38:00] move jesus reattaches money as if it
[2:38:02] never was cut off because he was on a
[2:38:07] mission and Peter had a purpose and his
[2:38:10] ups and downs did not just find his
[2:38:12] purpose his purpose was defined by what
[2:38:15] was written about him before there was
[2:38:18] the foundation of the world
[2:38:23] a painful experience with Peter Peter
[2:38:30] before the crows you'll deny me
[2:38:33] Peter couldn't even believe it Peter did
[2:38:37] not accept that he was capable of denial
[2:38:41] and you know with so many experiences we
[2:38:44] go through in our Christian walk
[2:38:46] the Italians we fewer on top of the
[2:38:47] mountain and the time we chest down in
[2:38:50] the valley and you know what brother
[2:38:52] branham said he says if there was no
[2:38:54] mountain and no valleys we would never
[2:38:57] be able to appreciate the mountain top
[2:38:59] if we didn't have a valley if there were
[2:39:02] no bad moments he would merely be able
[2:39:04] to appreciate took good moments so Peter
[2:39:08] found himself down in our Valley when
[2:39:11] Jesus has taken away Peter were you
[2:39:13] there he's like no it wasn't just a
[2:39:17] statement to him you know it was the
[2:39:19] reality settling in that I feel I messed
[2:39:23] up I actually did just what Jesus told
[2:39:27] me I was gonna do you imagine what it is
[2:39:29] to feel that way they asked him again he
[2:39:33] said no I was not there they asked him
[2:39:36] again and the Bible said after there's
[2:39:39] no time Peter wept
[2:39:42] bitterly what what is it do we bitterly
[2:39:47] I hope this help somebody this morning
[2:39:50] we have gone past preaching this is a
[2:39:52] talk to somebody today going through
[2:39:55] something I don't know what you're going
[2:39:57] through this morning but he knows
[2:40:00] there's some of us we are in the
[2:40:02] mountaintop and that's wonderful but
[2:40:07] there many of us in our own valley old
[2:40:11] crushes our own doubts like what our
[2:40:14] sister Trisha would have gone through
[2:40:15] but God pull her out of it and he's able
[2:40:18] as much to pull you out of whatever
[2:40:19] condition you are in and it's so blessed
[2:40:24] me when I think a two weeks ago I was
[2:40:27] speaking about when Jesus went when he
[2:40:29] angel met the people he said the woman
[2:40:32] who came to anoint the body and he told
[2:40:35] them go tell my disciples and Peter
[2:40:39] [Music]
[2:40:42] because Peter would have been down in a
[2:40:44] valley
[2:40:46] you know what it is to be having a test
[2:40:49] of money people know your testimony
[2:40:51] kudamon say I am tired at Christ's
[2:40:54] brother Peter Peters Underwood today's
[2:40:58] shop
[2:40:59] God talks to Peter Peter walked under
[2:41:02] water
[2:41:03] it is anointed and a new calf I am Peter
[2:41:07] Peter message
[2:41:10] because he deny Christ and friends
[2:41:14] there's so many ways we didn't I am we
[2:41:16] deny him in our homes we deny our jobs
[2:41:20] when because the token is the flipside
[2:41:24] of dynamically talking it's a public
[2:41:26] display we're going somewhere the token
[2:41:31] must be displayed which is a public
[2:41:33] declaration that I my I am identified
[2:41:36] with the sacrifice and what Peter was
[2:41:39] saying is I'm not identified could you
[2:41:43] imagine
[2:41:46] and God understood that and said quote
[2:41:49] tell my disciples and Peter because they
[2:41:54] still a work for him to do
[2:41:56] and many of us have denied him in simple
[2:42:00] ways on our jobs you know schools and
[2:42:04] our lines some of us simple things we
[2:42:09] are afraid to pray for our meals in
[2:42:10] front of people some of the young people
[2:42:12] to just dress like a Christian you feel
[2:42:16] you you you you you're trying to fit in
[2:42:19] so much you deny him by wearing clothes
[2:42:22] you should not wear or even thinking the
[2:42:25] thoughts of whether you fit in it's a
[2:42:27] way of denying you because if you trust
[2:42:30] him and you are convinced and no devil
[2:42:32] could make you change your mind about
[2:42:35] your testimony as a Christian the token
[2:42:40] must be public there's no secret token
[2:42:45] there's no hidden token there's no this
[2:42:49] is between me and God token it must be a
[2:42:52] life display that people could know that
[2:42:57] he put a mark upon you
[2:42:59] he put a seal upon you he has approved
[2:43:03] you you identified with him and he's
[2:43:07] identified with you the devil must know
[2:43:12] your name

[2:43:46] the teller must know when you pray you

[2:44:36] deliverance a place
[2:44:38] is there anybody will supply it today
[2:44:44] [Music]
[2:44:46] friends before Jesus came they lived
[2:44:52] under the law and the law was almost
[2:44:55] accursed as it was upon mankind because
[2:44:57] no one was pure enough no one could be
[2:45:01] good enough no one could have been held
[2:45:04] accountable to living up to the entire
[2:45:06] law the law and type kind of almost held
[2:45:11] people in bondage because it showed the
[2:45:13] very imperfection of man but the blood
[2:45:17] of Jesus freed us from the curse of sin
[2:45:20] the curse of death the law have no
[2:45:24] completion today was a lamb tomorrow it
[2:45:27] was a dove next week it was a goat there
[2:45:29] was it never stopped trying to make up
[2:45:32] for it because the blood of the goat and
[2:45:36] sheep was was a temporary solution
[2:45:40] it was covering but the problem was
[2:45:43] still underneath it was covering but
[2:45:47] there was no transformation under there
[2:45:49] to win Jesus died that blood we moved to
[2:45:54] him removed remove the problem it no
[2:45:58] longer needed to be covered up because
[2:46:00] it took it on the sauce remove the can
[2:46:03] sorry move the problem to make way for
[2:46:06] the Spirit of God the only loss itself
[2:46:12] to follow the word the Holy Ghost said
[2:46:16] saltan because the Holy Ghost attracted
[2:46:19] sanctified life and the blood sanctified
[2:46:23] purified the blood cleans up
[2:46:32] in the Old Testament the high priest
[2:46:34] would sprinkle blood on the judgment
[2:46:37] seat made to be a mercy seat and this
[2:46:42] would the seven tons of blood is this
[2:46:45] bloody messages message that came to us
[2:46:48] dripping with blood has been sprinkled
[2:46:51] in this day our judgments eaten it means
[2:46:55] this mercy for your house its mercy for
[2:46:59] your family it's mercy for your marriage
[2:47:01] mercy for your children mercy for your
[2:47:04] mind mercy for your party
[2:47:11] [Music]
[2:47:14] hilli-ho testament many lands now it
[2:47:19] says one lamb a lamb without blemish a
[2:47:24] lamb that was different because he could
[2:47:27] identify with you in the Old Testament
[2:47:30] that lamb he he didn't even understand
[2:47:32] what was going on but this ma'am
[2:47:34] understood when the stripes was upon his
[2:47:37] back that it was being done for a
[2:47:39] purpose it was being done for your
[2:47:42] Redemption and he was thinking about us
[2:47:46] with every step that brought him closer
[2:47:49] to Calvary
[2:47:50] oh we were identified with every step
[2:47:55] because we should have been taking those
[2:47:57] steps we identify with every lash
[2:48:00] because we should have been the ones
[2:48:02] being last I'm finished friends catch
[2:48:12] the picture catch a bullet
[2:48:15] John wept because he's found there was
[2:48:18] nobody worthy until the word said behold
[2:48:23] the Lion of the tribe of Judah and here
[2:48:26] comes that bleep bloody lamb the mighty
[2:48:29] Conqueror God himself he got him off he
[2:48:34] himself yet changed his mask from God
[2:48:38] above to God with we spoke about it is
[2:48:42] so weekend he had to find a way to
[2:48:45] restore back what was lost in Genesis
[2:48:48] [Music]
[2:48:53] you know what he did for us we spoke
[2:48:59] about it he couldn't solve the problem
[2:49:04] in heaven because that jurisdiction
[2:49:07] that's his jurisdiction on earth the
[2:49:11] jurisdiction is handed to
[2:49:12] flesh-and-blood so only somebody from
[2:49:15] this jurisdiction could take dominion
[2:49:18] over what happens here not even the
[2:49:21] angels after his diction yeah
[2:49:23] [Music]
[2:49:25] this is our territory so God put on 16
[2:49:29] elements so he would be qualified to be
[2:49:32] in dis Taurus diction
[2:49:38] to take away sickness to take aways and
[2:49:41] he had to be alone doctored could feel
[2:49:45] your pain and enjoy your suffering and
[2:49:48] feel tiredness and be tempted and the
[2:49:52] Bible said he resisted he was without
[2:49:56] sin temptation comes without sin this
[2:50:02] fear comes without sin tiredness comes
[2:50:07] without sin without blemish the perfect
[2:50:11] sacrifice and the devil didn't even
[2:50:14] recognize what was going on
[2:50:19] [Music]
[2:50:21] just like in Egypt that night open the
[2:50:26] doors to their freedom open the door to
[2:50:29] the Passover he fed them physically he
[2:50:31] came in one night he unlocked the keys
[2:50:35] for them and when Jesus died he had
[2:50:40] finished his first purpose but we spoke
[2:50:43] about the secret mission of God because
[2:50:46] he had to go down in the realm to take
[2:50:49] the keys from Sita he could not do it in
[2:50:51] 16 elements so he couldn't wait to die
[2:50:54] his death was not just your salvation
[2:50:57] his death was just not your Redemption
[2:51:00] but his death give him permission to
[2:51:03] drop even lower into the realm of the
[2:51:05] devlins shelf
[2:51:07] where you can walk up to Satan in his
[2:51:11] territory and that asked for mission but
[2:51:14] he took the keys of the devil's own
[2:51:17] Kingdom he took the keys of debts he
[2:51:20] took the keys of hell he took the keys
[2:51:23] of the grave
[2:51:25] what bondage are you in this morning
[2:51:28] there's no bondage because that land
[2:51:31] that perfect sacrifice he came to
[2:51:35] deliver your house he came to deliver
[2:51:37] your mind he became deliver your body
[2:51:40] he'll deliver your soul friends the
[2:51:52] redemption on Calvary there was a part
[2:51:55] of that that was a mystery that only we
[2:51:58] can identify with because Paul could
[2:52:01] have said death where is your sting
[2:52:02] grave where is your victory
[2:52:05] but Paul still went down to the ground
[2:52:09] because the curse of man required that
[2:52:12] man were to go into the ground but when
[2:52:14] Jesus took the keys of death and hell he
[2:52:17] made it possible for scriptures like we
[2:52:20] shall not all sleep because of men that
[2:52:24] because he no other keys at death hell
[2:52:26] and the grave he could now say listen
[2:52:29] you don't even need to go there but you
[2:52:32] can be changed this mortal to put on
[2:52:35] immortality this lamb that came oh oh
[2:52:41] [Applause]
[2:52:51] come finished column for a house
[2:53:00] the angel
[2:53:02] [Music]
[2:53:04] said I put a mark upon all those that
[2:53:06] sigh and cry for the abomination in the
[2:53:09] city
[2:53:12] because judgment is coming he said to
[2:53:15] begin at my sanctuary at the ancient man
[2:53:20] go through the camp and look for that
[2:53:23] mark go through Egypt and look for the
[2:53:28] token
[2:53:29] friends that investigation is happening
[2:53:33] right now
[2:53:33] he's moving from individual to
[2:53:36] individual house the house and he's not
[2:53:41] asking questions he's just looking for
[2:53:44] the talk
[2:53:46] he's not asking for an explanation he
[2:53:49] doesn't need it he just needs to see the
[2:53:50] token there's no time to ask what church
[2:53:53] you go to there's no time to ask how
[2:53:55] long you've been in a message there's no
[2:53:56] time to ask do you believe just a token
[2:54:01] just a token is it on display in your
[2:54:05] life is it on display in your house when
[2:54:09] your neighbor passes by your house can
[2:54:12] they see their lives or Christian can
[2:54:16] they see that church if your neighbors
[2:54:19] cannot see that there's something wrong
[2:54:22] [Music]
[2:54:30] a saint again friends
[2:54:33] if your neighbors cannot tell that you
[2:54:36] are Christian did something wrong
[2:54:39] because it's supposed to be on display
[2:54:41] if your coworkers
[2:54:44] do not know you are a Christian there is
[2:54:46] something wrong there must be a
[2:54:50] difference but the way you live it's not

[3:18:34] engagement represents a serious promise
[3:18:37] of marriage on this world betras means
[3:18:42] to be engaged it is the highest the
[3:18:47] contract of the highest feet between a
[3:18:48] man and a woman to get married in the
[3:18:52] near future engagement is just an
[3:18:54] agreement where two parties decide to
[3:18:57] get married at a later date
[3:18:59] God Almighty promised to engage himself
[3:19:02] to his people that is why we are called
[3:19:06] the bride of Jesus Christ and had been
[3:19:09] engaged you're preparing to be married

[3:19:42] in which the parents family the
[3:19:46] agreement between two parties engagement
[3:19:48] and then afterwards the actual marriage
[3:19:51] praise the name of the Lord
[3:19:53] so therefore God sees this as an
[3:19:57] important step in the stage right now
