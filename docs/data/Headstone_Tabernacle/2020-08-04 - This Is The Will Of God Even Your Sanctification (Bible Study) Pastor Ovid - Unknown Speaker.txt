this uh time of fellowship tonight on your word in jesus might ask it amen god bless you and thanks again for being here and tonight i would like you to turn the bibles the first thessalonians chapter four and um actually we want to go to john 17 first john chapter 17. we want to read verse 14 to 23 and we want to go to first thessalonians 4 from 1 to 9. so john chapter 17 and you want to read from verse 14 and this is jesus this is in red and this is jesus speaking he said i have given them thy word and the world had hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that those shoulders take them out of the world but that doubt should escape them from the evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for my sakes for and for dear six i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified to the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father out in me and indeed that they also may be one in us that the world men believe the thou has sent me and the glory which thou giveth me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that i was sent me and has loved them as that was lovely i want to go to first thessalonians chapter four i wanna read from verse one so if you have your bibles or whatever sent it first thessalonians chapter four on verse one furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus and as you have received of us how he ought to walk and to please god so you would have bond more and more for you know what commandments we give you by the lord jesus and for this is the will of god even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lusts of concussive sense even as the gentiles which know not god that no man go beyond and before his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you untestified for god had not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness he therefore that despise it he therefore that despise it despise it not man but god but also given us unto us his holy spirit and as touching bloody love you need know that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another may god bless this world so god bless you tonight and tonight i haven't thought i'd like to share with you tonight uh taking this from the scripture of first thessalonians 4 and um this particular verse we hear for this this is verse 3 for this is the will of god even your sanctification that's what i want to share with you this is the will of god even your certification is a bible study tonight what i'd like to do at this point is to read for you the amplified of that same scripture first thessalonians 4 verse 1 and he was talking about verse 3 for this is the will of god that you should be consecrated separated and set apart for pure and holy living and you should abstain and shrink from all sexual advice that each one of you should know how to possess control manage his own body in consecration purity separated from things profane and honor not to be used in the passion of lust like the hidden who are ignorant of the true god and have no knowledge of his will that no man transgress and overreach his brother and before him in this matter or default his brother in business for the lord is an avenger in all these things as we have already warned you solemnly until you blame me for god has not called us to impurity but the consecration to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity wherefore whosoever disregards or set aside and reject this disregards not man but god whose very spirit who he gives to you is holy chaste and pure and concerning verbally love for all other christians you have no need to have anyone right you for you yourselves have been personally taught by god to love one another okay so let's go tonight praise god to be sanctified to sanctify something is to set that personal thing apart for use sanctified is to be cleansed and separated for service and he said you know when we were born in the body of christ and christ died he said that really meant to bring our booth and that's the three elements that came out of the life of christ when he died there's water there is blood and there is spirit three elements that go through when we are born again justification sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit now hear what he says no that can all be in one act so in other words he is saying that a man could get that holy ghost justified sanctified several day goes in almost one act but you can be in a justified state which is as if inverted sin without being sanctified you can believe on the lord jesus christ and still carry your filth with you but you can absolutely live a justified and clean holy life and with all the holy ghost so they are treated at their record in heaven the father son of holy ghost trees are one and they're treated their record on earth water blood and spirit and they agree in one so if you have your bibles uh yokotan the second thessalonians chapter two and we want to look at the scripture the second thessalonians chapter two reading from verse thirteen to seventeen second thessalonians chapter two it's so good for you to be able to go to the scriptures and this is paul he said but we are born to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god had from the beginning choosing you to civilization through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth i'll read that one again god hurt from the beginning chosen you to salvation how through what means through sanification of the spirit and the belief of truth well i until he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which you have been taught whether by word or or or epistle now our lord jesus christ himself and god evil father which had loved us and had given us everlasting consolation and good hope to greece comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work so you could see that paul here is establishing the fact that you have to be in word and work growing maturing established steady you're making progress so i don't want to see this as certification wesley certification a past age certification we passed that long time i don't you see that i want you to see a new view a fresh view of signification tonight so we're not talking about past age and john wesley no i want you to see this as a necessary part of the journey of sons and daughters on their way to adoption now the justification part you cannot do that yourself it is god that justified and if you want to suit the bible's roman 8 28 we could look at that romans 8 28 23 we want to read that that part you can't justify yourself let's see what the bible says in romans 8 28. for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are they called according to his purpose for whom he did for know that is his full knowledge now he also did predestinate or predetermined to be conformed to the image of his son the destination is to get you to the image that he might be the firstborn among my new brethren so jesus will be like big brother to us okay so verse 30. moreover whom he did predestinate demi also called now comey called demi also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if god before us who can be against us he who speared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justified so i want you to know that this justification that picking up that dirty blast that's picking up duty you and i that picking up duty us it is god that did that and he did that based upon his full knowledge his foreknowledge is what constrained him to predestinate us to be changed to be transformed that is why god have no problem picking up prostitutes drunkards drug addicts all kind of cuckoo people and bringing them and cleaning them up and taking them and sanctifying them and fill them with power and spirit and presence and use them for his own glory now let's reflect back on something here whom he justified yet already glorified when we justified then he also glorified now in description text it says nothing about sanctification so sanctification is the labor and the struggle between justified and glorified it's the proven time it's tutoring it's behavior it is testing time or place of trial no signification could be viewed in two phases before you receive the holy ghost and after you receive the holy ghost because after receiving the holy ghost you still have to go through tutoring testing child child training behavior as we said that adoption is not based on a minister simon or minister's a teacher or the minister the office that he holds as a teacher or pastor that's not the basis of adoption the basis of adoption is behavior i want to say it again the basis of adoption is behavior and he says that is why the seven seals has been opened up revealed unfolded the mystery of god that we could see the plainness of god that we could know how to behave ourselves now you will get this now in galatians four if you turn your bibles to galatians four you would see what we're talking about tutors and governors and how is no game it's a program of god so if you go to galatians 4 and we go to verse 1 you would see how paul shared this this thing about inheritance and what your predestination on 2 and verse 1 of galatians chapter 4 we read now i see that the ear as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant will be lord of all so it means to say that at the child level inheritance is so distant so therefore the burden of god is to bring us to maturity and the law of these seeds still apply if you look in nature you look around life every plant you see human beings animal life the law of the seed still applies in which this seed doesn't look anything like the fruit but the seed has to go into the ground and through processes it comes back to the original life this is what this gospel is all about god put a seed in you you are the earth you like the shock of the earth are you like that dude that ground you are that ground that god put the treasure in you might not feel like a treasure you might not uh think you are treasure but god see you as a treasurer and because you see you that way he for knew you he called you and that treasure gotta work its way out something has to work it way out so god doesn't look at conditions so much you look at the predestination so let's read galatians four voice one now i see that the ear which is you as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant do he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children listen listen we're in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent for his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons so don't go down that road you're not worthy and you're not worthy and you're not worthy don't go there don't go there just listen to what god's saying tonight and because your sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father not abba pasta apostle prophet but our father okay because your son because you are seed you can be reborn because you are son you could get that breakthrough you could get that victory you could get that overcoming so because your son god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying out the father wherefore there was no more servant but a son and if a son than an ear of god through christ how be it when we knew not god you did service unto them which by nature are no gods but now after so then he's talking to believers now that come true but then they acting up a certain way but now after you have known god or rather unknown of god how to me again to weak and beggarly elements where upon you desire again to be bondage you observe these months times years i'm afraid of you at least are bestowed upon you labor in meme so paul was telling them oh gosh man god bring you out god call you god pull you so far you ain't pull yourself out you didn't justify yourself why are you going back why are you going back to begley elements why are you going back into that kind of bondage again of the law of legalism and so on you're observing days and months and times and years i'm afraid of you for less i have been stowed you leave her in vain now the scripture you read jesus said i sanctify myself for their sake so christ our example seed he choose to sanctify himself that means he give up certain things he pushed himself he kept himself for a higher order for for those disciples to get their break and he said lord sanctify them by thy truth thy word is true now listen our bibles now i want to show it in the old testament to joshua chapter 3 and you want to read from verse 1 to 5. joshua chapter 3 verse 1 to 5. familiar scripture and joshua rose in the morning they removed from him and came to jordan he and all the children of israel lodged there before the passover and it came to pass after three days that the officers went to the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priest and the levites bearing it then he shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near to it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way here before now watch so he's saying now there ought to be a distance between the act the word that the priest was bearing the ark of the covenant and the people and this is to let you know that this is the way you must go so all you have to do is to follow the ark because the priests are being directed if you follow the word it will take you to where you're supposed to go okay that is the first statement but look at verse 5 now and joshua said unto people sanctify yourself yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you so even though the ark is going forward the people of the distance behind they know the ark the word they're gonna take them where they're supposed to go god demanded of them a certain behavior a certain thing they have to do in order to be ready for the signs that was god was going to do among them on the morrow and brother branham he types out an adoption and i want you to notice so this will anchor and get the right picture of this sanctification we're talking about all right you're talking about israel was brought over egypt and there were three stages of the journey one stage was leaving egypt the next stage was the wilderness and the next stage was kena now this three steps or three phases or whatever they want to put it in trees is everywhere you could find this type water blood spirit justification signification button holy ghost everywhere you can find these three steps two stages let's continue now canaan does not represent the age of the millennium it represents the own age of the overcomer now another things it brings and he yeah he's bringing it along justification by faith after believing moses and left egypt here we go sanctification was to follow under the pillar of fire and the atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the wilderness and then entering into the land that have been promised so friends is just really three steps then your problem was three steps justifications justification certification and holy ghost fill them and adopt them they were they were sealed inside out in the upper room restoration is four steps because the word fell into the ground in nicaea god took four steps to bring us back which is justification signification the baptism of the holy ghost by the pentecostals and then the word that came to the prophet malachi 4 william brown so then it needed four steps and that ties into what was said in jewelry i restored to you the years of the cankerworm the catabol the counter the kangaroo the caterpillar the palm oil and the lucas i i'm going to restore to you the years that they have eaten myself so that that is what that is about the bible identify those four beetles those four are worms and therefore god put four steps the scriptures cannot be broken so therefore sanctification is to follow under the pillar of fire and then the last part is entering into the land this is what he broke in to know what is the land promised to the new testament believer the promise is the holy spirit for it shall come to pass in the last days joel 28 that i poured my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and upon my hand minions and my made servants will i poured my spirit they shall prophesy i show wonders in the heavens above in the earth pillars of fire and smoke and vapor and peter said in their pentecost repent every one of you right and and so on right now did you notice joshua before they crossed jordan joshua said go to the midst of the camp and clean your clothes sanctify every one of you let no man come at his wife for within three days you will see the glory of god here we go are you ready say amen you just believe you're ready it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise now i know church that if we see this tonight if we understand the person because the process is what people duck they don't want to go to the process of studying their exams two five years in school they end up with no papers because they fail that process their job opportunities become limited and if they do get a job it's not paying them as they would like all things in life have this part called process sometimes it takes 30 years you see they become an overnight success sometimes you take years in drilling and grinding to get that breakthrough it is the process the seed the plant in the ground to before the harvest you have to wait until the seed life unfold until it flowers until it be a fruit and delicious mature that you could have is that true it is the process of life we can't get around it you cannot expect a four-year-old to be mature before you have to go to five to go to ten fifteen eighteen you cannot adopt a four-year-old and tell them you're only business it doesn't even make sense the scripture doesn't have that it's their childish and the tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father so i want you to see even though the language promised even though joshua was in front of them and go tell them take the people over there was still a process and this is what the prophet said he's talking about our goal again go to the midst of the camp clean your clothes sanctify every one of you let the man come at his wife for within three days you will see the glory of god it's a process of getting ready to inherit the promise now the promise to israel was god gave the abraham the promised land of palestine and it was to be their possession forever and they was to remain in that land and they come through three stages coming to this promised land which is perfectly tight in the new testament now there are three stages of the journey and there are three stages of this journey so now we come up to earth we are justified by faith believing our lord jesus christ forsaken the land of egypt that is only coming out and then you are sanctified through the offering of his blood washed from our sins and become pilgrims and sojourners claiming that we are seeking a land a city that's coming over promise now i know a lot of people do like to think and come in and come in they say and comment like it postpones and leave it that is irrelevant this is the program of god they are only three stages not 55 stages three stages coming out wilderness land so they were sanctified to the orphan of his blood wash from sins and you become a pilgrim as a journal claiming that you are seeking a land a city that's coming or a promise so that israel in the wilderness sojourners no place to rest traveling night after night following the pillar fire but finally they come to the promised land where they settle down so that is where you settle down there's no settling down and if you reach promised land yet come on pack up and keep on journeying pack up and keep moving so there is where the believer comes he first comes to recognition the sinner he's separated by the waters washing of the water by the blood by the wood believing the lord jesus being justified by feet he become a partaker and peace with god through christ baptized in the name of jesus christ and on to the journey you get it into the journey then he becomes this agenda on the pilgrimage he's on his journey to what this is what a on journey to what a promise that god need israel here we go have not yet received the promise but they were on the journey have you received your promise if you have not read you received your promise you are on your way you are in the journey he said please do understand that's where the nazarene and peregrine willingness fell because israel when they come to the spot of kingish baniya when the spies aren't over understand the land is great but some of them come back and said we can't take it because the cities are walled up but joshua and caleb stood out and said we are more than able to take it because of their already signed up documented statement they believe in two works of grace justification and signification but could not go any further and listen the whole generation perished in the wilderness but two that went over to the promised land and brought back the evidence that was a goody line we are more than able to take it because it was god's promise then here we go instead of people going on receiving the holy spirit speaking with tongues receiving the power of god or baptizing the holy ghost and one of the miracles they felt would break down tradition what happened they perish in the land i wonder if this message works at a junction right now a jordan junction a junction where debt is required sanctification is required a preparation a preparation is required a process is required here it is the whole world under this corner virus anointed if it is that good everybody lock in shot in things are not normal things are not the same and after coming out of this it will not be everything but it changes the whole change but out of this there is a people in the land will see what is promised and they will go after it they will prepare their hearts for it they will press to watch it because that is the people that are going to have a vision you know without a vision the people perish because without a vision you have no focus away think about that if your vision is from islam you raise your staff you're moving on somebody say hello good morning good morning but you are so journal you're a pilgrim come here and come here i can't stop here you know why you're moving on so then he said hear this he said but the believers and caleb joshua outfit that was going on to the promise they moved over into the land they took the land settled down in the land as a possession so right now this message is a profession but it has to become a possession it's not a profession of what you believe i believe this doctrine i believe that doctrine i don't believe this doctrine they want people out and you never only laugh and because nothing is doctrine thing the doctrine has to be a vehicle or conduit to bring us into the channel of power or presence if the doctrine or teaching don't bring us dear something is wrong and that is why we talk about his sick seal ties up the loose ends which is all the doctrine so we can have a clean clear understanding of what took place and come face to face with our promises because from from malachi to matthew all those years where pharisees and scribes and strategies dominated the religious world at that time with olin scrolls and prophecy is only when john came it come to a focus point that there is somebody here talking about becoming messiah and john talking about there is one standing among so john shook up the place for hundreds of years they were in tradition that was left by the four fathers and the elders here it is a man no signs no wonders no miracles nothing special about him just a man commodity willingness i'm all repent repent and be activated to the trees a man talking that kind of talk and all of a sudden say there is one standing among you and you begin to identify the promise that was looked for in the old testament it is here it is present it is now that what john did so he said now the joshua and caleb outfit they went into the land and took it as a possession then he said we never stop at justification signification let us go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let us not stop at believing in lord jesus being baptized let us not stop because he cleaned us up from the life of sin but no no no i talk about tonight now we press on into opposition to a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost what peter said promises unto you and your children and then that are far off he must made the lord of god charcoal so sanctification of your human spirit this is is a good one and preparing this tonight i put on some stuff how can you be sanctified and you can't forgive think about it sanctification is the blood right and the blood for this age is what forgiveness so how bad how could people be sanctified and they can't forgive how could these people uh having odds and crutches and hate in this one and eating that one and talking this one and cutting down that one oh in the name of god could they really be satisfied in this message they can't forget because with sanctification and forgiveness you can have your healing once you're sick once you're looking for a healing you're in touch check your heart see if there's any unforgiveness there see if there's any oughts to you see if there are people that still bugging you and hit in your heart ask god to help you tonight to cleanse your heart and let it go don't hold it it will be a cancer tumor all kind of diseases will hit you when you have those things in your system bitterness it will put a boil in your system and put some chemical reaction or some demon jump in there and put some kind of friction in your body at you what do you expect so listen what the prophet said you can't repent for what adam done you never did it you just get forgiveness for what you have done but the old nature is still there so that's when somebody gets justified right you talking about in the human heart have a snake in it that is the sin that has a life okay and that sneak is what causing you to behave or you behave the other one have holy spirit and a different behavior with love and joy and long suffering the other one would sneak up malice and hatred and envy now when you ask or you are forgiven of your sins you only done this you're taking that away but the thing that made you do it is still dear that is the old root of evil so somebody coming to church doesn't make them a scene because they get baptized in jesus name and they are justified and god which we should you know justify them and save them and so like that he said the thing that causes you to disbelieve and bad behavior is still there it's the old root of evil he said no god forgive every sins and then secondly here we go secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness to think right so tonight i want to revive that i want to revive your thinking your mind in order for holiness you know i remember years ago people anytime you can't curse you and when people see you they change your language because there's no question coming up no people get insensitive to that people cussing you're not saying nothing that is not right you should see something you know i mean i i i'm not comfortable with this you know you have to reject certain things you want your spirit to be clean you want your spirit to be pure you want sanctification not for flesh just for flesh but the sanctification of your human spirit sanctification means uh sets our mind in order for holiness to think right and simplification is a compound greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service silly password tonight was clean so you can know where i go clean and set aside for service and the next comes the baptism of fire and holy ghost that god might dwell in us the fire of god cleanses our heart from sin and puts the holy ghost inside then we have we bring forth the same life that he did because he's in us so this is not you put another message quote and you put another message talk and you mentioned so many messages really message you god bless god bless you know what you may say performance you're not an actor you're not in hollywood what you want is fire fire from god to burn up the snake in your heart and your mind your spirit you want sanctification which is the will of god for your life okay so brother branham let's continue and i want to talk about the courts right you know the court it had the the the altar you had you walked off separation and you approached the courts and so on and the court was three parts outer court the holy place an emotional replace that's what i'm saying this three steps or three phases or whatever they want to call it it is everywhere so you have the outer court and under the outer court he says you live by justification and that's the sun out there the moon the light wherever moon last night under darkness and right now that's justification that altar some vacation now you were inside the holy place had seven golan kansas now this part is very important because i wanted to show where those seven golden campsites were they were in the holy place and of course in the most holy place was the sheikah in the glory and he said no at the altar that that that represented signification you didn't turn up on the sunday or the moon stars because they had seven candlesticks that gave them light but many a time they smoke up and they went out and that's the way people do okay so when they went into the holies of holies and those they dropped behind aaron once a year they didn't have living no moonlight starlight or gold and stuff a golden candlesticks under the interlock wind of the german the ship kind of glory was there they live in the light which never diminished a world they live on by the part of the manner they could eat anytime they wanted to it never got old what a life to live and that's the kind of life abraham was living a complete surrendered sold-out consecrated dedicated life to the lord and we call it sanctification they thought when they shouted they really had it the methodist nazarene boy as soon as i should shout the front road he didn't have it the pentecostal boy they spoke in tongues they already had it but if i know they didn't it doesn't lie upon shouting and speaking with tongues those things are all right but to have him is different that is attributes of him it means a sold out consecrated daily hourly life in the shekinah glory with him all the time that's right not as i am saying things against shouting and speaking with tongues that's fine that's the attributes of the holy ghost and so forth we need those things yet that's not it that's not it it's the hidden consecrated life remember those people out in the courts was eating the same kind of manner as was in here behind the golan uma because in the holiest of holies and there was lot walking right along with abraham was a believer too but he didn't have that constant abiding presence of god what not didn't have constant abiding presence of god one more time what not enough that constant abiding presence of god so when the husband got an argument abraham said we are brethren let's not have any arguments you take the east take the worst take the rest of the east wherever you want to go isn't that something though i find this is very uh noteworthy because you see the seven golden candlesticks represent the seven ages so therefore when you're talking about seven steps are you talking about the blood you're talking about this sanctification but the original comebacks to the end okay i'll say this way alpha omega and the processes in between i'm alpha ephesians church i'm omega in another ephesians church in between seven church ages so the seven church ages is the process well let's see it's a different way the seed go through processes which is the seven ages comes back again fruit come back to the original life at the end of that process so this is what this certification represent the blood theme future knowledge temperance patience codiness burly kindness it represents process what's the third step charity shekinah adoption glory and i could place it right here and you're familiar with this from the second coming of the lord the prophecy he's talking about the housewife that lost her coins and she swept all and she bought the cupboards until she found that she was lost and when she did she called her little sister churches to come now i don't care if your methodist baptist and because her presbyterian that was what he had said at that time of course but our time is sexy no seal half ceo left seal whatever condition is in this message when that time comes so this is the prophecy when the church finds watch is broadly love okay when the church finds its holy decency now this word here holy see you don't hear much about it and then you find the third part now when the church finds its place in christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us god wants you to love him so again we find these three steps even in prophecy for our time when the church comes when the church finds one it's broadly love now faith to connect with charities based upon forgiveness if you want to pull along the camp if you want to have love if you want to have god's blessing you have to forgive because you need that fear that is based upon forgiveness so god wants you to love him so i wanted to show you again these three steps very love and what we're emphasizing that sanctification is this slot called holy decency and then you're going to find your place in christ so i believe we have to go back to sanctification the message has become polluted that people can live any kind of life and be in the message and be in and call is a christian that kind of good friends that cannot work that is how it has been for years if going forward it can't work this is time to tie up your loose ends this is a exhortation uh in line with what was spoken on sunday even and i was even thinking i know what i was going to share this evening but this is what i put in my heart to share god wants us to have a life god want what god wants is not examiners of doctrine somebody sit down with like some long beard tall hats and then this falls that falls that falls that off that off and they know everybody off and they sit down there as office could be dogwood here don't do that god don't want us examiners of doctrines or disputed of texts but of course desire is really seven live voices a light that thunders hebrews 13 12. you can find it if you want to find it he boosted into everlasting this is a good one beautiful scripture hebrews 13 12 way for jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let's read it again wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and this is what it has in the amplified therefore jesus also suffered and died outside the city's gate in order that he might purify and consecrate the people through the shedding of his own blood and set them apart as holy for god that's why sometimes i like to read the amplified it gives a fuller a view of the scripture the text this is so beautiful that uh he shared his own blood he went and suffered and died outside the gate the purpose of him shedding his blood is that we can become holy unto god and um about the bible say we believe in justification by faith romans 5 1. we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the lord jesus but it's possible that the same person could have habits such as drinking smoking and doing things that they would do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of jesus christ sanctifies this person for the service of the lord we believe in sanctification and he read the scripture hebrews 13 12 where jesus also he might signify with the people with his own blood suffered throughout the gates and we believe that sanctification is taught in the new testament and meant for the believers through the new testament age which we are now living so this is not where it's reminded we pass an eviction we have seals is that right let's continue but we also believe that after the person has been satisfied the unclean habits has gone from the person he is a believer on the lord jesus christ his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the holy spirit which come as a filling of the believer so all the bad habits on clean habits filthy habits get fire bombed and your life gets sanctified you cry out to god to get cleaned up you get your illusions tied up your candidate to be filled with the holy ghost it's just as many times i've taught by picking up a glass out in the chicken yard justification is picking up ready to use it with a purpose in heart that's what god does to a sinner he's still filthy then he cleansed by the blood of jesus christ and the word sanctifies a compound word which means clean and set aside for service and in the old testament the altar sanctified the vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is not another step of grace but more of the same grace that fills the believer to the extent where signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken in first corinthians 12 manifest themselves truly believers when the holy spirit comes in to take up the gift so root servant is the sanctification part the labor part you're working out your own salvation and fear and trembling part the getting rid of the filth and the sanctification of the human spirit which is the legalistic part of the things that you can do you see we talk about who he called he called it justified you just fired or glorified already glorified and in between he said nothing about sanctification because with your appreciation of god justifying you shall give you a love and a praise and worship to god that you willing to do the necessary cleanup acts the necessary separation the necessary sacrifice and turning eyes on woman you know to keep yourself sanctified to pray every day and read your bible are you doing things that were going on please squad and brother branham said this right here that's what the church is in order it's got the mechanics ready it only need the dynamics tonight if we can get the mechanics ready and the first thing he said get our hearts right you know in one way we could talk about mechanics all the wooden the seeding and the seed and the wood in the bride and so on but this part is so important to get our hearts right it's about the things that we can do follow every word follow him in baptism follow him in every order that he told us to do every mechanic ready and stand here then we are ready for dynamics to be lit off and only god can do that that's to drop into your heart that feet that says i am now healed okay so let's take a slow walk right through this here now let's take a slow spin on the car and let's drive over this you know tonight if we get the mechanics ready get our hearts right the things that we can do are there things that you have to do are they things that still outstanding are these things that still need to be corrected other things still need to repent of editing still to work on or whatever stitch up you have things to do then your the mechanics are ready yet for you so so you are limited to have faith for dynamics because your condemnation or your heart doesn't allow you the full freedom of faith to believe god for all things so you wouldn't have the confidence to say lord i've served you all my years you know that man who god did notice that he was going to die god i saved you all these years you know god spend my life giving and god send back a word to the prophet i've heard it i've heard it i can't say that all pull some more time that man knew he had access at my new this is how you ought to be this is how we are ought to be to know that it is well with my soul i just a little more again um this one is a big one satisfication is when your name goes on the book as a believer your name is wrote in blood this is from question and answers signification does that you come up and say and when he trusted you up this far then come and say well you would he know it yes he know that he know you wouldn't do it from the beginning he know judas wouldn't do it but he know what you will do he says satisfication is when your name goes on the book as a believer so when you live a sanctified life oh glory hallelujah you're only proving the name of the book could i hear a show oh is there anybody shouting there tonight or give some god some glory how is this wonderful tonight glory signification is when your name goes on the book as a believer right the name is root in blood let's turn to hebrews 4 12 and let's read from this one it's a familiar scripture the scripture that i love uh let us therefore fear lisa promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it this is hebrews chapter four verse one verse two week off for unto us was the gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with feet in them that heard it let's pause your minute holy page molesk first right there so think about it now somebody messaged 40 years and they're mixing it with their feet somebody just come in last week and yeah their feet are mixing with up with it watching happen that 40 year old some good day 40 years and being left behind you know somebody backs in 20 years and somebody did in church for 40 years and he backs it in person 20 years walk into the church and begin to receive the word and mix it with faith you see you going on there right now that person without faith is left back here because all things of god is a faith it's not your feeling it's not the ears is that not getting old it's not that so let's go again those two for under us was the gospel preached as well unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that hood so if you want to profit with what you're hearing you have to mix it with faith faith have action with it faith is not just saying amen oh that was a good exaltation of the night i like it no that's not it if you recognize the word coming to you you have to act on it to sink it in the nail it in for verse 3 now for if we which have believed do enter into rest as he said i've sworn in my heart if he shall entered in my rest although the works has finished from the foundation of the world for he speak in a certain place of the seventh day and this wise for god that rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest not yours his rest seeing therefore it remained that some must enter therein and data who was first preached entered not in the cause of unbelief we sever again he limited a certain day same and david today after so long a time as it said today if you will hear his voice had not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest then would he not have after what i spoke with then the verse nine the bomb they remained therefore arrest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own work as god did from his and this is the verse i want to get to let us labor therefore to enter into that rest at least any man fall after the same example of unbelief and if you have your bible in front of you let's say together let us labor therefore to enter into that rest least any man fall after the same example of unbelief so that laboring part is the work part is the effort it is the pushing it is the legalistic part it is the sanctification part it is depression to what that is what that is about so faith is the start and charity is to rest and in between you're adding virtue your portion for knowledge you're pressing for temperance and patience and godliness and broadly kindness and as you head up at his narrows you're getting to be more like jesus not less like jesus not more arrogant and your bad behave and you want to explode and you're carrying on and the same way you behave and answer about 15 years ago he's taken the same as it was 15 15 years and you see him today that makes no sense you ain't grow just get old stop getting old grow grow so this message really the message of they are this seven thunder blood message supposed to bring on whole recency should bring on a sanctified bunch of people so hear what the prophet said almost done the holy spirit you are believing unto eternal life but when the holy spirit comes in it is eternal life you are begotten of the spirit at sanctification so that is why he said the pentecostal the mysteries couldn't be given to them because they were begotten so he was showing the pentecostals really was in the womb they didn't come true yet because they were in the womb so when you claim he's your claim is only a begotten son i claim this i claim virtue and i claim knowledge and i claim and have this revelation and you're making all your claims that is just the baby on the inside they're very big maybe bunching punching and maybe moving and so on word on top of word of a word begotten sign but born means it may become true okay and if i really come true the a woman don't just have a big belly and then the baby oh god the guy baby is okay oh it reached no that's something called labor pains that's a reach it have labor and you talk about when the church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world that the holy ghost is real and how they groan how they cry and the labor pains when they are born and positionally born then god says in the church okay people don't want to talk about the old old-time holy ghost now they like to talk about the holy ghost translation which is fine like to talk about we are the holy ghost all kind of different same baptist doctrine you don't have the holy ghost you don't need nobody that is doctrine and steroids but this what we're saying here now is that you are begotten of the spirit of signification but never born of the spirit until the holy ghost comes down he said that's correct a baby got life in the war of the mother little mother quivering it's a life but it's a different life when it breeds the bread of life into its nostrils so first corinthians 12 2 i'll read this one under the church of god which is a current to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints oh glory hallelujah who is sins them that are sanctified in christ jesus one more time who is saying again you know people talk about because it doesn't mess with it because it and if you're not satisfied you're interested saint is sanctified one okay so he says to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints but all that are in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both tears and ours i want you to find this one ii timothy 2 15. we're almost there i hope i hope you really enjoy this session tonight uh second timothy two you want to read from verse 15 and this is exaltation i trust it inspires you tonight it is study to show itself approved unto god a workman that near not been ashamed and this is what we share in the nineties to help you uh be that kind of workman rightly dividing the world of truth because the word of truth could be wrongly divided so the word of truth need to be right to divide sean profane and vain babbling but they were increased unto more uncoordinated then talk old talk long talk have no profit on it kill it walk away from watch they will increase the moon goddess and their wood will eat us as dr kanka of whom hymenias and philitus who considering the truth have heard these are virgins who went off track saying that the resurrection is passed already and overture overthrow the fate of some so these guys who have some cocoa revelation to some people paying off the foundation 19. nevertheless the foundation of god's standard show the consolation having the seal the lord knoweth them that i is and tonight that everyone can name it the name of christ depart from iniquity and inequity is you know better you know right and doing wrong that's inequity cut it out stop it this is the order from the word here now that everyone that name it the name of christ depart from inequity and here we go but in a great house they are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and of earth some to honor some to this honor if a man here we go therefore purge himself from these hallelujah so they have men they have everybody hearing what is being said tonight and what the prophet said on the books on the teams but this is the partner where the things that you can do at your heart right but the things that you can do if a man therefore pulls himself from these he shall be a vessel of the honor sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared unto every good work verse 22 free also youthful lust and follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart follow these things but foolish and unknown questions avoid knowing that they do gender strife there are some people like to say something make sure you see about something too and if you are sure what you're talking about is a whole big melee a whole big stuff kill it i can say frankly i don't know everything but what god show me i could speak what god revealed to me i have authority with and anointed with and that is what i could go by every man have their own measure of grace and faith i don't want somebody else's measure i want to work with the measure that god has given me so i if i don't know i would say that above my paid grade i don't know i don't know i don't know everything i'm not good see foolish i'll learn questions avoid knowing that it's gender strife but the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men up to teach and patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god power adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who has taken them captive by him at his will oh my you love him tonight and this we have the vote two or three more and we'll be finished hebrews 10 with nine to fourteen let's find that one hebrews 10 9 to 14. when your bible run tonight he was 10 million from bruce 9. then said he low i come to do i will oh god take away the first that he may establish a second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the bloody body of jesus christ one for all and every pre-standard daily ministering and offering of time the sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man loved that but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down at the right hand of god from henceforth expecting until his enemies they made his footstool here we go it's part of what he got do for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified let's say together that's in verse three four four by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified psalms 51 6 i'll read that one behold all these irish truths in the inward paths and in the hidden path thou shalt make me to know wisdom god one truth from your heart not from your head but from your heart this last scripture we're going to read i'm going to close with this scripture here which is first thessalonians chapter 5 and from 12 to 23. are we going to close with this scripture tonight first thessalonians 5 18 12. thank you lord and verse 12 says we beseech you brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be a peace among yourselves now we exhort your brethren warn them that are unruly what yes warn them gather unruly as i tell people they're not your father house or your mother can you come to church does he also go oh you behave in your mother and mother house don't bring it in church warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient towards all men see that non-render evil for evil now this is active behavior now this is not just some this is super mysteries being revealed here right now this is behavior mysteries see that non-render evil for evil under anyone whatever follow that which is good vote among yourselves and to all men rejoice it will move free without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus considering you so if you tango for the triumph you turn over the test you turn god the things they will call your tongue go for a big fat no you get everything give quench not this spirit despite not prophesying prove all things and hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance or evil here we go there's a final part of scripture and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ so sanctification means to be holy sanctified clean pure even the virgins were pure one just without oil but i don't even have any buttonhole legos here you are still
