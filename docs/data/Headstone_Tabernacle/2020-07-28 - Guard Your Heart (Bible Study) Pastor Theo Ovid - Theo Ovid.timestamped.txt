[8:43] second peter three
[8:44] reading from verse one this second
[8:47] epistle beloved
[8:48] i know right unto you in both which i
[8:51] still pure
[8:51] pure minds but we have remembered that
[8:54] you may be mindful of the words
[8:56] which were spoken before by the holy
[8:59] prophets
[9:00] and of the commandment and of the
[9:03] apostles of the lord and savior knowing
[9:05] this first
[9:06] that they shall come in the last days
[9:08] scoffers walking after their own lusts
[9:11] and seeing where is the promise of his
[9:14] coming
[9:15] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[9:18] things continue
[9:19] as they were from the beginning of the
[9:21] creation for this they willingly ident
[9:24] of
[9:25] that by the word of god the heavens were
[9:26] of old and the earth
[9:28] standing out of the water and in the
[9:30] water where i
[9:31] the world that then was being overflowed
[9:33] with water perish
[9:35] but the heavens and the earth which are
[9:37] now by the same word
[9:39] are kept in store and reserve unto fire
[9:43] against the day of judgment and
[9:44] perdition of godly men
[9:46] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[9:48] thing
[9:49] that one day is with the lord as a
[9:52] thousand years
[9:53] and a thousand years as one day the lord
[9:57] is not slack considering his promise as
[9:59] some men conquest
[10:01] but his long suffering to us word not
[10:04] willing that any should perish
[10:06] but that all should come to repentance
[10:08] but the day of the lord will come
[10:10] as a thief in the night in which the
[10:13] heavens shall pass away with a great
[10:14] noise
[10:15] and the elements shall melt with
[10:17] flavored heat the earth also
[10:20] and the works that are there and shall
[10:21] be burnt up this is the verse i want to
[10:24] get to
[10:25] seeing then that all these things shall
[10:29] be dissolved
[10:30] what manner of persons would you to be
[10:33] in all holy conversation and that is
[10:36] holy life that is living does not talk
[10:39] and all holy conversation and godliness
[10:42] looking for and he's still under the
[10:44] coming of the day of god
[10:46] wearing the heavens being on fire shall
[10:49] be resolved
[10:50] and the elements shall melt with the
[10:52] food and heat may god add
[10:54] a blessing to his word god bless you
[10:57] and um good night and
[11:00] as you fully aware as you hear the news
[11:02] of more cases
[11:05] spiking up and up here you know
[11:08] a couple of weeks back when the
[11:12] government
[11:13] give us the green light have that
[11:16] services under conditions the question
[11:20] was and i
[11:21] was asking myself about the discipline
[11:24] and the order of things
[11:26] and i cherish the fact that
[11:29] as a people we could get into some kind
[11:32] of discipline
[11:33] and i hope you see discipline in a
[11:37] as an asset not as a binance force to
[11:40] bind you
[11:42] but as an asset to protect
[11:45] and to keep you because
[11:48] discipline is what it will take now
[11:51] to wash hands to wear masks to do what
[11:54] is required
[11:55] to keep yourself preserved in this hour
[11:59] and i want to challenge you and advise
[12:02] you
[12:03] to take any anyone as a carrier so you
[12:07] have to
[12:07] know your own protocols and what you are
[12:10] safeguarding
[12:11] and how you are managing your own
[12:14] day-to-day life
[12:15] whether you go to the grocery whether
[12:17] you go to the store or whatever it is
[12:20] if you don't have to go someplace don't
[12:21] go just
[12:23] take it easy and i want to encourage you
[12:25] to do that
[12:26] especially the seniors among us who are
[12:28] at greater risk
[12:30] uh as you are well aware that some
[12:32] countries have it rules than others
[12:34] and america is like a debacle right now
[12:37] is a terrible
[12:38] thing they reach i think 150 something
[12:42] thousand people have died
[12:45] and uh i read a report today about a man
[12:48] who
[12:49] he said he thought he was a hoax he
[12:51] didn't call it a pandemic he called
[12:53] that's condemned he didn't believe
[12:55] it was true and it's amazing that people
[12:57] could be hearing
[12:59] seeing watching and don't believe
[13:03] and of course we know this is the age of
[13:05] social media
[13:06] in which it have people i don't know
[13:08] what is the kicks behind it what is the
[13:10] boost behind it love to share false
[13:13] stories
[13:14] all kind of stories just maybe to go
[13:17] viral
[13:17] just maybe to get the clicks i don't
[13:20] know
[13:21] but there are a lot of fake news
[13:24] fake information and we are
[13:28] grateful that god sent a prophet
[13:29] messenger in his last day
[13:31] that didn't bring fake information he
[13:34] bring the truth
[13:35] and this is the truth that we are
[13:37] holding on to
[13:39] because where would we be we be tonight
[13:43] if we were baptist or methodist or
[13:44] pentecostal or whatever
[13:46] where would we be to understand malachi
[13:49] 4 behold i send you
[13:50] elijah the prophet before that great and
[13:53] terrible day
[13:54] of the law you know
[13:58] all these so-called prophets because we
[14:00] have a lot of profits now
[14:02] um or everybody calls of a prophet and
[14:04] who's not a prophet is a person
[14:06] all these great mighty men you're not
[14:07] hearing them much
[14:09] with this corner virus thing you're not
[14:11] hearing them much about the power that
[14:12] they have
[14:13] what they claim to have what they think
[14:15] they have
[14:16] and the whole thing is this
[14:19] that god promised to shake everything
[14:24] the world the nations countries
[14:27] people everything that can be seeking
[14:31] will be shaken and i
[14:32] want to quote it from the scripture
[14:33] itself from hebrews 12
[14:35] uh verse 25 if you want to look at it if
[14:38] you want to look at it with me
[14:40] hebrews 12 25-29 says see that you
[14:43] refuse on him that speaketh
[14:45] for if they escape not or refuse him
[14:49] that speak on earth
[14:51] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[14:54] away
[14:55] from him the speaker from heaven whose
[14:58] voice
[14:59] then shook the earth but now he had
[15:02] promised saying
[15:03] yet once more i shake not the earth only
[15:07] but also heaven and this word yet once
[15:11] more
[15:12] signify the removing of those things
[15:14] that are
[15:15] because of things that are made that
[15:18] those things which
[15:19] cannot be shaken may remain there we go
[15:22] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[15:25] cannot be moved
[15:27] let us have grace whereby we serve we
[15:29] serve god acceptably
[15:31] with the reference and godly fear for
[15:33] our god is a consuming fire
[15:36] so i want you to be aware tonight that
[15:39] everything that can be shaken will be
[15:42] shaken
[15:43] that includes our countries
[15:47] nations marriages
[15:51] home life work life
[15:54] you name it government life positions
[15:57] powers whatever but everything that can
[16:00] be shaken
[16:02] will be shaken so we are not looking as
[16:05] if this is
[16:06] a surprise to us we are looking as
[16:10] this is what we have to be prepared for
[16:13] and we want to know
[16:15] what kind of people we ought to be
[16:19] in this kind of a scenario
[16:23] as but isaac said something powerful on
[16:25] sunday
[16:26] that people is not like a business as
[16:30] usual
[16:31] and i wanted to soak in a little bit
[16:32] tonight i want you to think about it
[16:35] tonight
[16:36] it is not business as usual
[16:40] for no country for no nation for no
[16:44] people
[16:45] for nobody it is not business as usual
[16:49] they call in things like new normal i
[16:51] see i think google
[16:53] uh is saying that the workers will work
[16:56] from home
[16:57] until next year july the whole
[17:00] thinking has changed the whole way
[17:03] people are communicating has changed and
[17:06] i was thinking
[17:07] about abraham this evening
[17:10] and how god gave him such a high written
[17:15] and i i was thinking and i'm actually
[17:17] worried high
[17:18] written for wheaton now what do you
[17:20] think about that
[17:21] abraham got a high written just for
[17:25] wheaton
[17:26] iran didn't build no city abram was
[17:28] looking for one
[17:30] abram didn't build no empire
[17:33] and so on like that all he did he
[17:35] believed god
[17:37] and it was imputed to him for
[17:40] righteousness
[17:41] and he waited for 25 years
[17:45] and i was thinking about the quotation
[17:48] that brown says perfection
[17:50] is patience waiting on god
[17:54] and waiting for god i know a lot of
[17:57] people don't like to wait
[17:59] waiting it takes faith to wait it takes
[18:02] courage to wait it takes in a strength
[18:06] waiting actually produces character
[18:10] god gave iran 25 years jesus had us to
[18:14] wait
[18:15] 18 years in silence before he stepped
[18:18] forward
[18:19] for ministry every test
[18:23] is connected to this thing called
[18:25] wheaton
[18:26] patience waiting on god waiting for god
[18:31] you said i wait till my change come
[18:34] if you are feet and you believe that
[18:37] your change will come
[18:39] then you are tested while waiting
[18:43] uh joseph joseph got vision joseph got
[18:48] revelation
[18:49] and i guess there might have been a
[18:52] great temptation
[18:53] for him to question whether the vision
[18:57] is
[18:57] true real or the vision will come to
[19:00] pass
[19:01] now if joseph knew by revelation
[19:04] and by experience and by dreams that god
[19:07] is dealing with him
[19:09] he's supposed to know that the vision
[19:11] can't lie
[19:13] and the vision is true but he has to
[19:16] wait
[19:17] he had to be imprisoned in egypt he had
[19:20] to
[19:21] be in jail and no power no
[19:24] talk no nobody to convince nobody to
[19:27] fellowship with to exhort them
[19:29] and yet the vision and the gift was
[19:32] there
[19:33] that he could see the butler being
[19:36] restored in the baker
[19:38] being hanged and so on like that and he
[19:40] could still wait
[19:42] even when he tell the butler when
[19:44] according to vision
[19:46] you are restored remember me and of
[19:49] course
[19:50] as human beings when we get up there
[19:54] we just forget who is down there and the
[19:57] butler
[19:58] forgot him and i guess if joseph
[20:01] was to be caught up in his own flesh he
[20:03] might be angry at that butler
[20:05] and he gave him a word and he will come
[20:08] to pass
[20:08] and i'll be next to pharaoh and he
[20:11] should have remembered me
[20:12] and like here care but that was not the
[20:15] point
[20:16] when you see but as i talk about above
[20:20] the business in the business and
[20:21] something like that
[20:22] when you see the higher picture
[20:25] the picture of god not not your picture
[20:28] not your friends or family picture but
[20:31] the picture of god
[20:33] then you could commit things into god's
[20:35] hand and say lord i know
[20:37] i don't understand this but i am
[20:40] trusting you
[20:41] when you work it out well god was still
[20:43] waiting because
[20:45] he had a time for fear to get the dream
[20:47] it's not a time for jesus
[20:48] to be ready and and you cannot
[20:52] uh get into that point or place
[20:56] before the time and the scripture even
[20:58] went on to say
[21:00] until his word came
[21:03] the word of the lord tried him now what
[21:06] do you think about that
[21:07] until his time came his word came
[21:11] the word of the lord tried him
[21:14] so god knows what we have to face
[21:17] god knows the challenges that lays ahead
[21:20] but we are challenged to stick
[21:24] close to the word stay close to oh god
[21:27] want us to behave and act
[21:30] and before i go further i want to just
[21:32] read this here
[21:33] for the brand i'm talking about love
[21:35] suffered long
[21:37] and is kind and then he said blessed are
[21:39] ye when men shall revile you
[21:41] and persecute you and shall seal man of
[21:44] evil against you falsely for my sake
[21:46] rejoice and be exceeding glad
[21:50] could you do that could you rejoice when
[21:54] people say no man of evil against you i
[21:56] think we have to begin to take this
[21:59] and begin to apply just what you see
[22:01] here for my sake rejoice
[22:03] and be exceeding glad for great is your
[22:05] reward in heaven
[22:06] for so persecuted the the prophets which
[22:09] will be for you
[22:10] here we go here's the part i want to get
[22:12] to the cloudy skies
[22:15] and storms of life
[22:18] are no signs of god's disapproval
[22:24] neither are bright skies
[22:27] and still waters signs of his love and
[22:30] approval
[22:32] his approval of any of us
[22:35] is only in the beloved i want you to
[22:38] think about that now i know it's things
[22:39] that you've heard before
[22:41] there's something new that we are
[22:42] sharing with you tonight the things you
[22:44] have heard before
[22:45] but i trust it become more and more real
[22:48] because there are some people
[22:49] because of what they go into presently
[22:52] and it may look dark
[22:54] it may be a shadow over your situation
[22:58] it may seem like doors are shutting in
[23:00] your face if
[23:01] it just seems like over your life now
[23:04] have dark clouds
[23:05] and it is just like gray skies you're
[23:08] not seeing no blue skies you're not
[23:10] seeing no sunshine
[23:11] and you're asking yourself what did i do
[23:14] wrong
[23:14] what did i say wrong what did i live
[23:17] wrong how would i have the wrong
[23:18] why is this happening to me here is the
[23:21] answer
[23:22] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[23:25] no signs of god's approval
[23:27] neither are the bright skies and this is
[23:29] where people
[23:30] because of blessings they behave
[23:34] arrogant they behave proud they believe
[23:37] what is with me god blessed me i have
[23:39] this i have baptists working out it's
[23:41] working out there's no um whatnot
[23:42] but we just read here neither are the
[23:45] bright skies and still waters
[23:48] signs of his love and approval
[23:52] his approval of any of us
[23:56] is only in the beloved jesus christ
[23:59] his love i want you to talk think about
[24:03] god's love is not feel your love is not
[24:05] grandparents love grandchild
[24:06] it's not husband love wife it's not that
[24:09] feel your thing
[24:10] god's love is
[24:14] elective which he had for us
[24:18] before the foundation of the world i
[24:21] want you to think about that word
[24:23] so his love is elective
[24:26] love that is why god could save a
[24:31] god could save a prostitute god could
[24:34] bring out a drunkard
[24:36] god could bring out a whole monger goku
[24:39] deliver
[24:39] murderer because his love is not what
[24:43] they do
[24:43] or didn't do his love is elective love
[24:47] and that love is what he had before the
[24:50] foundation of the world
[24:52] that is why jesus could tell his
[24:54] disciples you have not chosen me
[24:56] i have chosen you regardless of what you
[24:58] did
[24:59] have done will do i have chosen you
[25:04] example the elective love that expressed
[25:07] to peter
[25:08] peter was going to unfail he said he's
[25:09] never his ass just to feel like weak
[25:12] that was one thing
[25:13] i see what the devil wants to do you
[25:15] number two
[25:16] you will deny me three times fights two
[25:18] things but
[25:19] yet the love was dear was elective love
[25:24] so regardless of peter upsets dongset's
[25:27] problems and situation
[25:28] it didn't cancel god thoughts
[25:32] of his election to peter
[25:35] so you said now how
[25:38] does he love us ah yes but how shall we
[25:41] know
[25:42] we shall know because he said so
[25:45] that's all he said so and manifested
[25:49] that he did love us for he brought us to
[25:51] himself
[25:53] and gave us of his spirit creasing us
[25:56] as sons how shall i prove my love to him
[25:59] this is proven up
[26:00] how shall i prove my love to him
[26:04] by believing what he said
[26:07] and by conducting myself with joy
[26:11] i miss the trials that he in his wisdom
[26:15] allows to come to pass
[26:18] trials he in his wisdom
[26:23] to come to pass isn't that a beautiful
[26:25] thing tonight give the lord some praises
[26:27] for that
[26:28] hallelujah praise god so the scripture
[26:32] we read
[26:33] the bible said looking okay seeing that
[26:37] all these things shall be dissolved what
[26:39] manner of persons or he to be
[26:42] in all holy conversation and godliness
[26:45] in all
[26:46] holy living righteous living
[26:49] and applied word living i like to use
[26:52] that applying
[26:53] word living not church going membership
[26:58] that part is
[27:01] easy okay going to church you'll miss a
[27:04] service you go to church and say amen
[27:06] hallelujah praise god
[27:07] that is not what we're talking about now
[27:09] we're talking about
[27:11] you beginning to see the value
[27:14] of applying what you have heard
[27:18] what you read you begin to apply it just
[27:21] like we read something there
[27:22] how shall i prove my love to god by
[27:25] conducting myself with joy
[27:27] amidst the trials he and his wisdom
[27:31] sent our way now what if every one of us
[27:35] begin to accept
[27:36] and see every trial everything that
[27:40] comes our way
[27:40] god has arranged it and god knew before
[27:44] we had it
[27:44] it will come and that we have something
[27:46] in us to manage
[27:48] it but if you think you are not able the
[27:50] care manager can't take it
[27:52] then it reflects in your behavior
[27:54] because a man
[27:55] thinks in his heart so is he
[27:59] as you think so sometimes it take
[28:02] a change in how you think
[28:06] and how you process things yeah some
[28:09] people
[28:10] are positive beasts and there's some
[28:12] people a negative base
[28:14] so if you see the glass they say that
[28:16] glass is half empty
[28:18] they say that's the negative based
[28:19] person the other one will say
[28:21] the glass is half full that's the
[28:23] positive base person
[28:25] so sometimes our lives are leaning
[28:28] either negative or positive so when news
[28:31] comes
[28:32] or something happens the first thinking
[28:35] that comes in our minds and heart
[28:38] is something negative and that is when
[28:41] you are negative beast
[28:43] positive based person they will tend to
[28:45] see positivity in
[28:46] everything but the thing of it is god
[28:49] have a plan
[28:50] and a purpose for your life and you want
[28:54] to strive
[28:55] to enter into that plan and purpose of
[28:58] god
[28:59] so let's look at us again seeing them
[29:02] all these things shall be dissolved
[29:05] what manner of persons or he to be
[29:09] ordered to be so this scripture here
[29:13] is talking about not what you have to do
[29:18] but what you are to be
[29:22] and i remember i think the sunday before
[29:25] i read something that you are what you
[29:28] are
[29:29] by your soul your soul
[29:32] which is your subconscious which is your
[29:35] inner being
[29:36] which is like your heart so
[29:40] the issue and we said
[29:43] guard your heart for out of it are the
[29:46] issues
[29:47] of life so he did not ask
[29:50] about what we do seeing all these things
[29:54] happening what to do what to do what to
[29:55] do
[29:56] what is more question of what kind of
[29:59] persons we ought to be
[30:01] or come down of of of the kind of person
[30:04] we
[30:05] are because what you are in heart
[30:08] or mind or spirit that is what going to
[30:12] live out
[30:13] like you heard but isaac said it abraham
[30:16] says i rather a man
[30:19] wrong in doctrine right and spirit
[30:23] done to be right in doctrine and wrong
[30:25] in spirit
[30:27] because you see that spirit part
[30:30] the hard part is more important
[30:33] than the knowledge part because a person
[30:36] of the right spirit
[30:37] or right heart could be led into the
[30:40] right doctrine
[30:41] but the person of the wrong spirit or
[30:43] wrong heart
[30:44] they are not leadable i know that's not
[30:46] a word but they cannot be led
[30:49] there's a block that is there so
[30:51] therefore
[30:52] let me just continue further matthew 15
[30:55] if you want to have your bible matthew
[30:57] 15 i want to look at verse 11
[31:00] and jesus was talking to disciples
[31:03] this is verse 11 matthew 15 if you want
[31:05] to search it in the bible which is great
[31:07] if you look at the scriptures so you
[31:08] have your bible between the phone or
[31:10] whatever
[31:11] now that which not that which quote into
[31:13] the mouth defiled a man
[31:16] but that rich comet out of the mount dis
[31:18] de ferrata man
[31:19] so the scribe on pharisees was
[31:22] contending
[31:23] that the cyprus is eaten without washing
[31:25] hands
[31:26] and that is bad for these scribes and
[31:30] pharisees that is not
[31:31] it's not it doesn't look good and jesus
[31:34] say
[31:34] is not what go any man that defiled
[31:37] let's continue
[31:39] then came his disciples verse 12 of
[31:41] matthew 15
[31:43] and said unto him knows that the
[31:45] pharisees were offended
[31:48] after the hood is seen but he answered
[31:50] and said
[31:51] every plant which my heavenly father had
[31:54] not planted shall be rooted up
[31:56] let them alone they'd be blind leaders
[31:59] of the blind
[32:00] and the blind lead the blind boat shall
[32:02] fall
[32:03] into the ditch then answered peter and
[32:06] said unto him declare unto us this
[32:08] parable
[32:09] and jesus said he also yet without
[32:11] understanding
[32:13] do you do not understand that whatsoever
[32:16] entered into the mount gorge the belly
[32:19] and is castled into the drought
[32:21] but those things which proceed out of
[32:24] the mouth
[32:25] come from the heart and they
[32:29] defile the man
[32:32] so is not what go in is what comes out
[32:36] the issues are in the heart
[32:40] and then jesus went on to further to say
[32:42] for
[32:43] out of the heart proceed evil thoughts
[32:46] murders adulteries fornication
[32:51] tests false witness blaspheme
[32:55] and these are the things which defile
[32:58] a man but they eat with unwashing hands
[33:03] defileth not the man so in our truth
[33:07] everything comes from the heart
[33:10] and that's why and i heard somebody said
[33:13] this
[33:14] you cannot have the writing in your
[33:15] heart and live wrong
[33:18] and you cannot have the wrong thing in
[33:19] your heart and live
[33:21] right if you want to have a good life
[33:25] a blessed life start with a good heart
[33:29] a clean heart the bible exhort us don't
[33:33] overcome or try to overcome evil with
[33:36] evil
[33:37] overcome evil with good you
[33:40] have to see the power of good
[33:44] the power of light the power of truth
[33:47] the power of righteousness the power of
[33:50] god
[33:51] and if you stay with that it will work
[33:54] out right
[33:55] for you let's go to
[33:59] second corinthians chapter six and we
[34:02] want to read from
[34:03] verse 14 second corinthians chapter six
[34:06] foreign scripture
[34:07] are we gonna go through it and we're
[34:09] gonna go over to
[34:11] chapter seven and that's one verse there
[34:13] but we're gonna start second corinthians
[34:15] chapter six
[34:16] we want to read from verse 14.
[34:20] this is the lord speaking
[34:24] written to paul be not unequally yoked
[34:27] together with unbelievers
[34:30] for what fellowship about righteousness
[34:32] with unrighteousness
[34:34] so as a believer do you see yourself
[34:36] under righteousness
[34:38] because that is what you're supposed to
[34:40] be under righteousness
[34:42] so be not unequally yoked together with
[34:44] unbelievers
[34:45] for what fellowship had righteousness
[34:47] with unrighteousness
[34:49] what communion had light with darkness
[34:53] what concord had christ with bilia what
[34:56] part had he that believed
[34:57] with an infidel and what agreement
[35:00] at the temple of god with idols for ye
[35:03] are the temple of the living god so
[35:06] let's bring it coming at home now
[35:08] coming home to us coming home to you and
[35:10] i as god has said
[35:11] i will dwell in them
[35:16] and walk in them and i will be their god
[35:20] and they shall be my people this is god
[35:22] said that's what he said
[35:24] wherefore come out from among them
[35:28] and be separate saith the lord and
[35:31] touch not the unclean thing and i will
[35:33] receive you
[35:35] and will be a father unto you
[35:38] and he shall be my sons and daughters
[35:41] saith the lord almighty
[35:44] okay before we go further into seven
[35:46] chapter seven verse one
[35:48] let's go over this last line here in
[35:50] verse 17.
[35:51] let's look at 17 here first wherefore
[35:55] come on from among them and be separate
[35:57] so god calling for separation
[36:00] saith the lord touch not the unclean
[36:02] thing
[36:03] and i will receive you and i will be a
[36:06] father unto you
[36:07] and he shall be my sons and daughters
[36:10] see it
[36:11] the lord almighty okay
[36:15] so therefore you know it has this kind
[36:19] of
[36:19] superficial ambassador god and people
[36:22] boxing for years i have a seed
[36:24] and i'm just talking that kind of
[36:26] religious talk which
[36:28] what i'm going to do with this is the
[36:31] word here
[36:33] touch not the unclean thing be
[36:36] separate come on from among them
[36:40] and i will be a father unto you
[36:44] ye shall be my sons and daughters
[36:47] so god put certain conditions certain
[36:51] behaviors
[36:52] certain things he expect of us in
[36:55] in order for him to manifest the
[36:58] attribute of father
[36:59] and i you do this and i'll be a father
[37:02] to you
[37:03] what a father does look over his
[37:05] children
[37:06] protect his children help his children
[37:08] support his children and culturally
[37:10] children work with his children and what
[37:12] father does
[37:13] just as the natural father would be
[37:15] overlooking and so on that's what a
[37:17] father does
[37:18] what he says so if you're in the unclean
[37:21] thing
[37:22] that's a problem if you're not separate
[37:24] that's a problem
[37:25] if you're touching on painting that's a
[37:26] problem how could he receive you
[37:29] or he could be a father to you when
[37:30] you're messing up
[37:32] so you you
[37:36] have to do something about you because
[37:39] this thing about sanctification and um
[37:42] and all the hard preparation is things
[37:46] that that
[37:46] you have to do where your heart
[37:50] and mind is concerned now we could go
[37:53] across now to chapter seven
[37:55] and listen to what the bible says in
[37:57] verse one here of chapter seven
[37:59] having therefore these promises
[38:04] dearly beloved let us
[38:07] cleanse ourselves from
[38:10] all filthiness
[38:13] of the flesh and spirit perfecting
[38:16] holiness
[38:18] in the fear of god now i believe
[38:21] that there are some things god will do
[38:24] and there are some things we have to do
[38:28] and um especially
[38:32] in light even of the message that was
[38:35] spoken
[38:36] have i done enough sunday tremendous
[38:39] and we thank god for that and you know i
[38:42] came home here and
[38:43] yesterday i keep thinking i have not
[38:46] done enough
[38:47] what more can i do and i'm thinking
[38:51] like if you carry that thought through
[38:54] on your your daily work
[38:58] your daily performance whether you're
[38:59] home whether you're a housewife
[39:01] whether you're a gardener farmer
[39:03] whatever it is it doesn't matter
[39:06] on the job a new study
[39:09] i haven't done enough it's just
[39:11] something more i can do
[39:13] is there something extra i can do in
[39:15] other words
[39:16] you know it's the same don't leave off
[39:18] for tomorrow what you can do
[39:20] today because sometimes you put it off
[39:22] tomorrow
[39:23] and tomorrow just as crazy and messed up
[39:25] as today was
[39:26] but sometimes you have a slot that you
[39:28] could do stuff and you know what you're
[39:30] headed again
[39:31] because this is what you want to do
[39:32] tomorrow you do it today and the more
[39:34] you have other things to do and you find
[39:36] yourself
[39:36] getting more and more topically but if
[39:39] you keep pushing things off
[39:40] what you call procrastination tomorrow
[39:43] tomorrow
[39:43] tomorrow after a while things begin to
[39:46] build up pile up
[39:47] pile up over your head it keeps building
[39:49] up over you
[39:50] and there are so much under outstanding
[39:53] things to be done
[39:54] and all you have to do is to beginners
[39:56] make a start
[39:58] start you say the first miles of
[40:01] doctor a journey of a thousand i start
[40:04] with the full step
[40:06] it's far thousand miles but if you make
[40:08] that first step
[40:10] you're going to get there so then the
[40:11] bible challenges us
[40:13] having therefore these promises and we
[40:16] could
[40:16] tie it in repeater that say by these
[40:19] promises
[40:20] we become partakers of his divine nature
[40:23] but having
[40:24] therefore please promise dearly beloved
[40:28] let us cleanse ourselves
[40:32] that is on you tonight that isn't me
[40:34] tonight
[40:36] that is on an austenite you can't put it
[40:39] on nobody else
[40:40] you can't ask somebody to cleanse for
[40:43] you
[40:44] you can't tell the pastor clean up for
[40:47] me
[40:48] that is what is belong to the catholic
[40:52] church and whatnot the
[40:53] sprinkler holy water and the priest is
[40:56] here everything and you know once they
[40:57] preach
[40:58] cover you you're covered this is not
[41:00] that
[41:01] this is you here seeing the need
[41:06] of getting the word to apply to your own
[41:08] life
[41:10] all your temper your anger your
[41:13] misbehaving or your attitude
[41:15] you have to confront you with that
[41:19] and stop making excuses
[41:23] because the excuses is what is hidden in
[41:25] you you are saying
[41:26] my wife you are saying my husband you
[41:29] are saying my daughter my son my uncle
[41:31] my aunt my neighbor
[41:32] the boss the driver in front what the
[41:35] young man did
[41:36] what a young man did not do you are
[41:38] seeing all of that
[41:40] and you are not looking at you if you
[41:43] want the world
[41:44] around you to change start with
[41:48] you don't start blaming
[41:51] don't start who feeling yes this one
[41:54] feel this one sloppy this one this
[41:55] whatever it is
[41:56] all of us are wrong you but do you see
[41:59] you
[42:00] do you see if how you are acting
[42:04] and living if it is motivating and
[42:06] inspiring
[42:07] or is it bringing a depressing
[42:11] and uh uncomfortable atmosphere
[42:15] you know sometimes when people fall in
[42:17] depression there's like a dark cloud
[42:18] it's a spirit of heaviness
[42:20] you don't want to go off the bed they
[42:21] don't want to go to work it's just
[42:24] it's just like a bang it's like a shadow
[42:26] over them and god wants to exchange
[42:29] that heaviness for praises
[42:32] the garment of praise where instead of
[42:34] you
[42:35] just stayed here moping all by yourself
[42:38] and you're thinking that
[42:39] it's not going to work or it's not going
[42:40] to work that you can begin to praise god
[42:42] and shake off that darkness
[42:44] and shake off that heaviness i begin to
[42:46] bless god
[42:47] in advance for the breakthrough that
[42:49] god's going to bring to you
[42:50] so i want to say everything comes out of
[42:54] that heart
[42:55] god your heart and to guard your heart
[42:59] what obama says the mind listen
[43:02] carefully
[43:03] is the gateway to the soul the mind
[43:07] is an entrance a door that gets done to
[43:10] this heart
[43:11] that's why i feel good my hearing
[43:12] hearing word because you hear it
[43:15] mind intellectual feet and from here god
[43:18] could take an operation by the holy
[43:19] spirit and drop it down into your heart
[43:21] and then it becomes a revelation and
[43:23] that is the thing that is anchoring that
[43:26] is the thing that is holding him
[43:27] that is the thing to strengthen that's
[43:29] the thing that satan hates you to get
[43:31] divine revelation because jesus upon
[43:34] that rock you build his church
[43:36] now most of our faith as the prophet
[43:38] present to us is intellectual
[43:39] sorry reading we read in we believe here
[43:42] we believe but there's no test
[43:43] that that test has been if you really
[43:45] believe that
[43:46] you say you believe but when it has come
[43:50] it proven by your behavior you'd already
[43:52] believe that
[43:53] you say you believe god is with you all
[43:55] right when it has come
[43:56] do you acknowledge and recognize what is
[43:59] with you or do you misbehave and act
[44:01] like he's not there
[44:02] well when you act like he's not there
[44:04] you really do believe he is dear
[44:07] but he says but ram says when you pray
[44:09] and you ask god he's silent
[44:11] he's testing you he's watching to see
[44:14] your reaction you know
[44:18] uh we who have
[44:21] come down all this age in life we can
[44:23] look back
[44:24] and see where god brought us from we can
[44:27] look back and through
[44:28] challenges and different things and yet
[44:31] when new things come up sometimes we act
[44:34] the same old way
[44:36] that is not hard to understand or accept
[44:39] israel was like that they saw pharaoh
[44:42] plague with flies and frogs
[44:44] they saw they came up with a mighty hand
[44:46] and yet they complain
[44:48] they move they get vex they angry they
[44:50] complain water
[44:52] they want meat they want this and they
[44:54] carry on
[44:55] god work without him
[44:59] until they came to king ishmael all that
[45:02] behavior because you will realize the
[45:03] capital house your cabin knowledge in
[45:05] the wilderness is a journey
[45:07] and i am saying we are journeying to a
[45:10] promise
[45:12] that is what is about abraham whom he
[45:15] really studies in truth ibrahimovic
[45:18] airplane ibrahimovic no no big house and
[45:21] and have a a other super center and a
[45:24] big grocery and ibrahimovic a big
[45:26] grocery man abraham's grocery
[45:28] all abraham had was he believed god
[45:31] what god said and this is where
[45:34] when you believe this you believe the
[45:37] word i don't care what people say about
[45:39] you
[45:39] you believe that inside of here god
[45:42] counted that as
[45:43] righteousness what conquered that has a
[45:45] fate
[45:46] that you could believe him and all you
[45:48] do know you're waiting you're waiting on
[45:49] what
[45:50] you're waiting on the manifestation of
[45:52] your promise
[45:53] amen waited 25 years abraham
[45:56] i guess they were good school friends
[45:59] and
[46:00] sarah and everything else and whatnot he
[46:02] saw his wife getting older and older and
[46:04] older and older
[46:05] and every day it looked worse every day
[46:07] but god spoke
[46:09] and if god spoke it has to come to pass
[46:12] just like we read in the scripture
[46:14] we have received a kingdom
[46:17] that cannot be moved your confidence
[46:22] have to come into this world becoming
[46:24] spirit in your life
[46:26] and that's the kingdom or the word
[46:28] becoming
[46:29] flesh in your life that is the kingdom
[46:31] because once that word becomes flesh in
[46:33] you
[46:34] the invisible becomes visible whatever
[46:37] you say one day
[46:38] uh what is that what is invisible will
[46:41] become visible to you
[46:42] the holy they will become a reality to
[46:44] you so right now
[46:45] it's like you have any substance which
[46:47] is your fate or what you're hoping for
[46:49] you can't see it there's no evidence you
[46:51] can't show it but you have the evidence
[46:53] of faith
[46:54] what we are asking for
[46:58] is what you can do
[47:01] that expresses the fate that god put in
[47:04] you
[47:06] god is not trying to make us be like
[47:08] donkeys and just doing world bullwork
[47:10] and
[47:10] i just you know do no no god not trying
[47:14] to do that
[47:15] he wants that faith to become active
[47:18] because you see
[47:19] we have to work they're going to come
[47:22] or when we have to work because jesus
[47:24] there's a prophecy
[47:25] work while you have light because
[47:29] there's going to come an hour
[47:30] no man can work suppose
[47:34] this is a preview of what we come into
[47:37] what we're going on right now with this
[47:38] corner
[47:40] i suppose this is like a gallery this is
[47:42] not the actual thing but this is a
[47:44] preview
[47:45] what could we do at this point
[47:49] who's going on a plane to travel anyway
[47:51] i'm not going anywhere
[47:53] you can you can try to get me to go
[47:55] anywhere
[47:56] let's say for instance this is a preview
[47:59] of what is to come
[48:00] it means a way think about it now
[48:04] i have been traveling since 1981
[48:07] that's a very long time every single
[48:10] year
[48:11] there wasn't a year i didn't travel from
[48:14] 1981
[48:16] this year 2020 will be the first year
[48:20] that i will not be traveling at all i
[48:22] know many many thousands and
[48:24] most people will not be trapped okay
[48:27] what if traveling is over just making a
[48:30] point
[48:31] what if there is no more places to
[48:33] travel to and to go like before
[48:35] and we are in this box of time
[48:40] waiting on the coming of the law
[48:43] if that is so how shall we read
[48:47] what atmosphere we're going to be
[48:49] waiting in
[48:51] if there is no uh all this is preview
[48:54] now
[48:55] we're not saying this is so but what if
[48:58] it's
[48:58] something like this would you be angry
[49:02] would you be upset or would you rejoice
[49:06] and be grateful that we are getting
[49:09] closer
[49:10] and closer to the coming of the day of
[49:12] christ
[49:13] because that is what ought to be
[49:15] bringing a special
[49:16] encouragement to you this is what the
[49:19] gospel is about
[49:20] the gospel is not about killing time
[49:21] with the church and fellowshipping after
[49:23] service
[49:24] the whole purpose of the gospel is to
[49:27] introduce the fact that christ is coming
[49:30] and the scriptures tell us nations shall
[49:32] rise against nations yesterday
[49:33] wars rumors of wars earthquakes and and
[49:36] what not
[49:36] and this gospel of the kingdom
[49:41] shall be preached and then shall the end
[49:44] come
[49:46] who have to preach the gospel we have to
[49:49] preach the gospel
[49:50] be brought up to preach the gospel
[49:52] because that's the only way the end
[49:53] come every time any time we can't get to
[49:56] the place to preach the gospel
[49:57] the end is is far off the end pushing
[50:01] you pushing back me and so if you know
[50:03] so so so
[50:04] so so that's why i saying and my son
[50:06] funny i know it might sound ridiculous
[50:08] to some people
[50:09] i've been saying all these years i've
[50:11] been waiting to preach the gospel
[50:13] and they might find that as a really
[50:15] cuckoo statement because
[50:16] i'm a pastor and i'm preaching i'm not
[50:18] talking about that
[50:20] i'm talking about what jesus says
[50:23] to do go into all the world and not read
[50:26] quotes
[50:27] not explain things preach the gospel
[50:30] and the only way that could be
[50:31] effectively done is if that quote
[50:34] and that would be read become flesh in
[50:36] us
[50:38] and if that comes flesh in us then we
[50:40] becomes
[50:41] we become actual channels of god to
[50:44] express the gospel
[50:45] your life become a gospel you can't help
[50:47] it when you go you testify you can't let
[50:49] a day go without
[50:50] testifying and sharing your faith with
[50:52] somebody because you've seen the value
[50:54] of this gospel
[50:55] the value of reaching out to others and
[50:58] getting souls of christ because one of
[50:59] these days the last name on that book
[51:01] going to come in we're going to be close
[51:03] you're going to be shut it'll be all
[51:04] over
[51:06] so you can sit down here in this room
[51:08] and tell us that the raptor will come
[51:10] you know
[51:11] it's not working not like that
[51:14] for the coming of the lord he has to
[51:16] appear among us before he comes
[51:19] brahm says two different words come in
[51:20] and appearing he has to appear
[51:23] even says about the seven thunders he
[51:25] said and when it comes
[51:26] manifested then you're worshiping the
[51:28] living christ
[51:29] him moving in and out in other words
[51:33] there will be such an atmosphere in the
[51:34] church that you will know christ
[51:36] is among us he is here he's only about
[51:38] that time the dead raised
[51:39] it's not a matter of time you know what
[51:41] i mean the sleeping scenes come forward
[51:42] through the amount of time
[51:44] no to get to dear that's why we're here
[51:47] tonight
[51:48] that you must guard your heart and the
[51:51] guard your heart
[51:52] you have to guard the channel that have
[51:54] access to your heart
[51:56] which is your mind what you read
[52:00] what you look at what you listen to
[52:03] what you soak in in your spirit you have
[52:06] to protect yourself
[52:07] there are some people they are not good
[52:10] for you
[52:12] not only they have spirits on them that
[52:13] bring depression and
[52:15] darkness over your life but what they
[52:17] speak is like blue
[52:18] smoke what they speak they will break
[52:20] the anointing of your life
[52:22] you have to know those people are wrong
[52:25] and cut them off
[52:26] you are scripted for that be separate
[52:28] because you want god bless them
[52:30] it's not you don't like them they
[52:32] themselves don't know what upon them
[52:34] you have to know what upon you the
[52:36] spirit is upon you
[52:37] the anointing is upon you and the spirit
[52:39] upon them want to cancel the spirit upon
[52:41] you
[52:42] that is what you don't understand that's
[52:44] what you don't know
[52:46] and sometimes somebody being blessed and
[52:48] whatnot like that and they encourage you
[52:49] wrong person coming to their life the
[52:51] wrong person come around them
[52:53] and next meet everything with toxic tv
[52:54] because a whole different vibration is
[52:56] coming
[52:57] around your life you have to be careful
[53:00] and that come like coronavirus right now
[53:02] you go wearing mask
[53:04] people wear hard to wear mask wash your
[53:05] hands and whatnot because
[53:07] you are in danger that virus not stick
[53:09] sticking on one person
[53:11] that progress is so dread it making sure
[53:15] it multiply an effect that's what it is
[53:17] about that why it's so dangerous
[53:19] that way you can't take no chances with
[53:21] nobody they might be nice
[53:23] they might be family they might be a
[53:25] good loved one like i told you about the
[53:27] man who said he thought was a hoax
[53:28] and he brought it in and his whole
[53:30] family got affected
[53:32] no he confessing there's no hoax well we
[53:34] know this gospel is no hopes
[53:36] god is real he actually fulfilled
[53:38] malachi 4 as
[53:39] in our prophet there's no hoax he sent a
[53:41] message to turn our hearts back to the
[53:43] faith of the fathers that is no hopes
[53:45] they had a real faith the fathers had it
[53:47] they manifest christ they manifest god
[53:49] we have to have it
[53:51] it has to start somewhere you have to
[53:54] begin
[53:54] i got in your heart now
[53:58] as all of you here in this room and as
[54:01] you would know
[54:02] over the years as a church we have not
[54:06] tried to bring any baccanal or confusion
[54:08] or what other church is doing
[54:10] or what is pastor doing or what is other
[54:11] church doing or what they're preaching
[54:12] on teaching
[54:13] and there's a reason for that by choice
[54:17] i try to guard the church from nonsense
[54:19] foolishness
[54:20] and weight and burdens that don't belong
[54:23] to
[54:24] them that you should not have you
[54:26] shouldn't be burdened
[54:27] by some kind of crazy teachings or stuff
[54:30] that some other church is doing
[54:32] boy you can hear what they're doing yeah
[54:34] what is saying yeah what are they
[54:35] teaching
[54:36] i want to have close ears i a hearing
[54:39] i don't want to know i want to see
[54:43] what the lord want us to do
[54:47] okay so if you want to get it right
[54:51] ask god to help you
[54:54] clean up that heart clean up your life
[54:57] clean up your walk and talk and then you
[55:00] could see the blessings of god
[55:01] pouring out upon you if you have your
[55:03] bibles look until luke chapter six
[55:08] this is things to apply this thing to
[55:09] look at closely and we want to look at
[55:11] verse 40. everybody in the bibles luke
[55:13] chapter 6
[55:15] verse 40 to 49 you want to read
[55:22] verse 40 says the disciple is not above
[55:24] his master
[55:25] but everyone that is perfect love this
[55:28] shall be
[55:29] as his master jesus is going down now
[55:34] he's going down deep into behavior
[55:36] attitude
[55:37] things to apply let's hear what he said
[55:38] you know and why because though the mood
[55:41] that is in thy brother's eye
[55:44] but perceivers not the being that is in
[55:46] thy own eye
[55:49] you're looking at others you're finding
[55:51] fault with others
[55:52] you have issues with others but you
[55:54] haven't seen the issues with about
[55:55] you jesus is busting them he said
[55:59] either who is 42 how can saul say to thy
[56:02] brother brother
[56:03] let me pull out the mote that is in
[56:05] thine eye when doubt thyself behold is
[56:08] not the being
[56:09] that is in thy own eye and jesus
[56:12] nailed them he said dao hypocrite
[56:15] because that is hypocrisy
[56:17] thou hypocrite cast out first the beam
[56:20] out of thine own eye and then thou shall
[56:23] see clearly
[56:24] the pull out the moot that's in thy
[56:26] brother's eye
[56:29] so if we have to go forward we have to
[56:31] deal with some
[56:33] sincere soul searching
[56:37] and if we want to help others we have to
[56:40] know
[56:41] in what spirit that we helping others in
[56:44] you know the bible talk about
[56:45] there's no tests for temptation given to
[56:48] man
[56:49] but god with that temptation made a way
[56:52] of escape
[56:53] and the bible speaks about the spirit in
[56:56] which
[56:56] you try to get somebody to be reconciled
[56:58] to god be spirit the way you do it it's
[57:00] not just well
[57:01] god you're a sinner oh god how you could
[57:03] do that and you
[57:04] you know come back repent no no no no
[57:07] you have to understand
[57:08] that if it wasn't the grace of god you
[57:09] might have been the same condition
[57:11] you have to understand is god's love and
[57:13] mercy that has kept you
[57:15] and just as god listen extend grace to
[57:19] you
[57:20] you ought to extend grace to others
[57:24] let me listen again just as god
[57:28] release grace to you and put greece to
[57:31] your life
[57:32] you ought to release grace to others
[57:35] just as god
[57:37] released forgiveness to you you ought to
[57:39] release
[57:40] forgiveness to others just as god
[57:43] released hope
[57:44] and expectation to you that is what you
[57:46] have to be able to express
[57:48] to others because as he being your
[57:50] father
[57:51] he is being like the son that china is
[57:53] just unjust
[57:54] you also going to be a reflector of him
[57:58] that could shine on others not just
[58:00] dealing with people who
[58:01] you connect with not just dealing with
[58:03] people who you like or who you love
[58:06] who treats you favorably but you could
[58:09] treat
[58:09] all almost the same because it's in you
[58:13] to do good it is in you to help it is in
[58:17] you
[58:17] to bring a word of comfort it is in you
[58:20] and like i said this week there's some
[58:22] people
[58:24] they give respects to people who are
[58:25] higher up or who they
[58:27] they feel have a higher value that is
[58:29] the wrong kind of
[58:31] give them respects and you're not
[58:32] respecting this one and i can't respect
[58:33] that one
[58:34] no that is wrong you give respect
[58:37] because you have respect
[58:38] and if you have respect you could give
[58:40] it to the poor
[58:42] to be done trodden to the person who's
[58:45] the garbage collector
[58:46] it doesn't matter what position whether
[58:48] it's a policeman or the garbage
[58:49] collector
[58:50] you give it because you have it now many
[58:52] people don't have it
[58:54] therefore there are problems to give it
[58:56] so yeah how you expect
[58:58] so actually so that's not the point the
[59:00] behavior of the person is not the issue
[59:03] do you have respect and if you have
[59:05] respect it will show on your job
[59:07] it will show in your home it will show
[59:09] in the church it will show in your life
[59:12] you have to have it because you can give
[59:14] it
[59:15] let's continue first 43
[59:18] for a good tree bring it forth a far
[59:21] good tree bring it
[59:22] not for corrupt fruit neither not a
[59:25] corrupt tree
[59:26] bring forth good fruit but every tree is
[59:29] known by his own fruit
[59:31] for of torns men do not got a figs nor
[59:34] bramble bush gather their grapes
[59:36] a good man here we go out of the good
[59:39] treasure of his heart bringing forth
[59:43] that which is good so you'll find out
[59:47] many people come to church there is
[59:51] a head and there is a heart
[59:54] many times they're not so connected
[59:58] the head shouting and saying amen the
[1:00:00] heart
[1:00:02] thinking and behaving and doing
[1:00:05] a whole different kind of thing
[1:00:07] altogether now the ideal
[1:00:10] is to get the heart and mind line up
[1:00:13] if we could get your heart and your mind
[1:00:17] line up with the word correctly then
[1:00:21] that's powerful you are almost
[1:00:24] unstoppable
[1:00:25] with your heart your mind and heart
[1:00:29] lined up most of the times your mind is
[1:00:33] thinking one thing and your heart
[1:00:34] is a different ballgame altogether so
[1:00:37] jesus is
[1:00:38] kneeling down here a good man out of the
[1:00:41] good
[1:00:42] treasure of his heart bringing forth
[1:00:44] that which is good
[1:00:46] uh evil man where that treasure coming
[1:00:48] from out of the evil treasure of his
[1:00:50] heart
[1:00:51] bringing forth that which is evil for
[1:00:53] out here we go
[1:00:54] of the abundance of the heart his mouth
[1:00:57] speaking
[1:00:58] that's why you hear me talking about we
[1:01:01] want to hear what people are saying in
[1:01:03] terms of
[1:01:03] an angel come down somebody say angel a
[1:01:05] light and whatnot
[1:01:06] i don't want to say about the wings and
[1:01:08] the pictures and so on how bright he is
[1:01:10] i want to know what community is about
[1:01:12] and if there's a word or not
[1:01:13] you see so out of the abundance of the
[1:01:16] heart he might speak
[1:01:17] if in your heart of forgiveness it will
[1:01:19] show it will have love it will speak it
[1:01:21] will show
[1:01:22] it we have grace and kindness it will
[1:01:24] show it will show
[1:01:26] okay and then jesus said this here
[1:01:31] verse 46 why call me lord lord and do a
[1:01:34] lot of things which i say
[1:01:36] that's a big one you know your body lord
[1:01:39] my lord hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:41] but when i come to the doing part this
[1:01:44] is not
[1:01:45] mysteries this is not doctrine
[1:01:49] this is not um revelations and and
[1:01:52] the book of revelation in the book of
[1:01:53] genesis and people call it viticus this
[1:01:54] is not that
[1:01:56] this is after all them books after all
[1:01:58] the revelation and mysteries and stuff
[1:02:00] this is whether or not you
[1:02:03] sincerely going to up
[1:02:18] verse 47 and here at my scenes and doing
[1:02:21] them i will show you to whom he's like
[1:02:23] so this is following up true now to
[1:02:25] doing it them
[1:02:26] do it them so it's two things and your
[1:02:29] body is that brother sunday
[1:02:31] hearing is one thing i'm doing is
[1:02:33] another
[1:02:34] here we go whosoever come into me
[1:02:38] and hear it by seeing and do with them
[1:02:42] i will show you to whom he is like
[1:02:45] he is like a man which built a house
[1:02:49] dig deep laid the foundation on a rock
[1:02:52] and when the flood rose and the stream
[1:02:54] beat
[1:02:55] vehemently upon the house and could not
[1:02:58] shake it
[1:02:59] for it was founded upon a rock now watch
[1:03:02] this
[1:03:03] scripture we read okay uh uh
[1:03:06] the shaken everything that can be shaken
[1:03:10] will be shaken so that those things can
[1:03:12] remain cannot be shaped
[1:03:14] all right now for something to be
[1:03:17] unshakeable the key part of that
[1:03:21] is the foundation and notice what jesus
[1:03:24] first said
[1:03:25] either hear it and do it or not okay he
[1:03:27] that is that a man that build a house
[1:03:29] and dig deep what he's talking about
[1:03:32] here
[1:03:33] lead a foundation on a rock so if
[1:03:37] you want to be strong if
[1:03:40] you want to be protected if you want to
[1:03:42] be effectively covered
[1:03:45] you have to have a scriptural foundation
[1:03:49] you have to have a bible foundation
[1:03:52] you have to have something solid and
[1:03:54] deep that your feet could rest on
[1:03:56] this is what jesus saying here he's like
[1:03:59] a man who
[1:04:00] built his house dig deep
[1:04:03] laid a foundation on a rock and when the
[1:04:06] flood arose now this is the part
[1:04:09] that a lot of people not expecting
[1:04:13] every work must be tried
[1:04:16] everything we build will be tried
[1:04:19] your experiences what you go through
[1:04:22] what whatever
[1:04:23] you'll be trying now as long as there's
[1:04:26] no flood the flood might take 30 years
[1:04:29] to come it might take 40 years to come
[1:04:33] the flood could represent any issue
[1:04:37] be it sickness be tumor cancer
[1:04:41] be it a loss of life a loss of a loved
[1:04:45] one
[1:04:46] we don't know but all we know
[1:04:50] the flood comes you know it reminds me
[1:04:53] of the storm and about to talk about
[1:04:55] and the winds were contrary jesus wasn't
[1:04:58] both but he wins for contrary
[1:05:00] you cannot determine when the winds
[1:05:03] around your life blows contrary
[1:05:06] in all of life there comes a time when
[1:05:10] things doesn't work out as you expect
[1:05:12] but iran call it a night time
[1:05:15] and many times as a christian there's a
[1:05:17] night time
[1:05:19] it comes to individuals it comes to home
[1:05:21] it comes to churches
[1:05:23] it's a night time where you cannot seem
[1:05:26] to
[1:05:27] find your way through one and you want
[1:05:29] to see the
[1:05:30] night and it's just like a dark time but
[1:05:34] as the bible says weeping and you're for
[1:05:36] a night but joy comes in the morning
[1:05:39] you have to believe that after this
[1:05:42] valley of depression and frustration
[1:05:43] there's a mountain to climb
[1:05:45] and it's a victory to shout about let's
[1:05:47] go at verse 49
[1:05:48] but he didn't hear it and do it not so
[1:05:51] now you're seeing the two classes of
[1:05:52] people
[1:05:53] right here those that would hear and do
[1:05:56] and those that would hear and don't does
[1:05:58] not remind you of something else
[1:06:00] in hebrews 4 those are here
[1:06:03] the word wasn't mixed with fate so it
[1:06:06] did not profit them
[1:06:08] they were actually recent time
[1:06:11] the only hearing airing hearing
[1:06:14] the wise virgin is not heroes only
[1:06:18] the wise virgin comes into a revelation
[1:06:22] that being in possession of extra oil
[1:06:25] is what will be required to make the
[1:06:28] rapture
[1:06:29] and i always say the wise virgin
[1:06:33] appear to do extra
[1:06:36] that is where the wise virgin is
[1:06:38] different from the foolish virgins the
[1:06:40] foolish versions
[1:06:41] take for granted i'm fine
[1:06:44] always i have the books i have the tips
[1:06:47] i have some oil because i started with
[1:06:49] oil but the oil ran out
[1:06:52] so you see you cannot be arrogant you
[1:06:55] cannot be
[1:06:56] uh overconfident you cannot just
[1:07:00] know it all and and you're speaking and
[1:07:02] whatever you say
[1:07:03] no don't go there don't don't cody
[1:07:08] always have a humble attitude
[1:07:11] that you need more you
[1:07:14] want more you are crying for more
[1:07:17] you are desperate for more let's
[1:07:19] continue in verse 49
[1:07:21] he that hear it and do it not he's like
[1:07:23] a man
[1:07:24] that without a foundation
[1:07:28] build a house upon the earth
[1:07:31] no no that house could be a prettier
[1:07:34] house that the man with the foundation
[1:07:36] one
[1:07:37] had foundation that house could be
[1:07:39] better painted
[1:07:41] that host could have better decorations
[1:07:43] better furniture and everything else
[1:07:46] it looks good but the flood had come yet
[1:07:51] the test had come here
[1:07:55] so let me just warn you a little bit
[1:07:57] don't
[1:07:59] look down on somebody who's going
[1:08:01] through their tests
[1:08:02] don't do that try to help them
[1:08:06] try to support them try to encourage
[1:08:08] them people going through
[1:08:10] rough times and tough times don't just
[1:08:12] do like if i was me i wasn't going to do
[1:08:14] it so and
[1:08:14] you don't know when your flood comes
[1:08:16] let's continue
[1:08:18] it's like a man with a house okay either
[1:08:21] hear it and do it or not
[1:08:22] like a man that without a foundation
[1:08:24] build a house
[1:08:25] upon the earth against which the stream
[1:08:29] did beat vehemently i mean i didn't
[1:08:31] really
[1:08:32] checked out the dictionary meaning
[1:08:34] vehemently but that would alone tells
[1:08:36] you is
[1:08:37] it's plenty vehement whatever whatever
[1:08:40] happens
[1:08:41] it means there's plenty blows it's
[1:08:43] plenty horse
[1:08:44] it's plenty licks it's plenty it's like
[1:08:47] wave after wave you ever
[1:08:48] sometimes that's some strong wind
[1:08:50] blowing and you ever watched the record
[1:08:51] with this thing going
[1:08:53] you hearing galvanize blowing somewhere
[1:08:55] and walk anything like that you say what
[1:08:57] right beat vehemently nothing
[1:09:01] there's not transitional it's not that
[1:09:04] it's not telling his trial
[1:09:06] this is beating vehemently and
[1:09:08] immediately it fell
[1:09:10] and the ruin of that house was great
[1:09:14] i'm almost done about two more
[1:09:16] scriptures i want to read
[1:09:18] all right have this one twice so it'll
[1:09:20] be fine
[1:09:22] titus 2 let's voice from
[1:09:25] 11 to 15 titus 2
[1:09:29] wow and that's about it
[1:09:32] all right and just one more afternoon
[1:09:33] titus 2
[1:09:35] i trust that this is helping you tonight
[1:09:38] i trust that this is
[1:09:39] making you rethink tonight of your
[1:09:44] response to the word in terms of how you
[1:09:47] apply it
[1:09:48] all right titus 2 reading from verse 11
[1:09:52] for the grace of god that bringeth
[1:09:54] salvation
[1:09:56] and appear to all men teaching us
[1:10:00] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[1:10:03] lust
[1:10:05] we should live soberly righteously
[1:10:09] and godly in this present world
[1:10:14] looking for that blessed hope and the
[1:10:16] glorious appearing of
[1:10:18] the great god and our savior jesus
[1:10:21] christ
[1:10:22] who give himself for us what's the
[1:10:24] purpose
[1:10:25] who gives himself to us like the next
[1:10:27] slide that he might redeem us from
[1:10:30] all iniquity and purify
[1:10:34] unto himself a peculiar people
[1:10:38] zealous of good wills and
[1:10:42] this is what was exhorted to titus these
[1:10:44] things speak
[1:10:46] and exhort and rebuke with all authority
[1:10:50] let no man despise so let's look again
[1:10:54] at that verse 14. jesus
[1:10:58] who gave himself for us that he might
[1:11:00] redeem us
[1:11:02] from all iniquity and purify unto
[1:11:05] himself a peculiar people
[1:11:07] zealous of good works amen
[1:11:10] so there's something god will do for us
[1:11:14] and there are some things we have to do
[1:11:16] for ourselves
[1:11:18] one of them is to cleanse ourselves one
[1:11:21] of them
[1:11:22] is to clean up our land one of them inch
[1:11:24] by inch
[1:11:25] you can take that final script we're
[1:11:27] going to read
[1:11:28] the familiar one that you know
[1:11:29] revelation 19
[1:11:31] that's our last scripture if we find it
[1:11:33] verse 7 and 8
[1:11:35] or last scripture this is your scripture
[1:11:38] now this is
[1:11:39] putting your name inside the dna let us
[1:11:41] be glad
[1:11:42] and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:11:46] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:11:48] and his wife
[1:11:50] had made herself ready and to her was
[1:11:53] granted
[1:11:54] that she should be a read and find linen
[1:11:56] clean and white
[1:11:57] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:12:00] of saints i'm closing with that
[1:12:01] scripture
[1:12:02] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:12:04] honor to him
[1:12:06] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:12:08] and this is the emphasis
[1:12:09] there in that verse and his wife had
[1:12:12] made
[1:12:13] self-ready that doesn't apply to church
[1:12:17] members
[1:12:18] we're not talking about church members
[1:12:20] church members could do what they want
[1:12:22] but you see the wife of the lamb she is
[1:12:25] going to make herself ready
[1:12:27] by how the prophet said taking up the
[1:12:29] close
[1:12:30] of the promised word wrapping herself in
[1:12:33] the gong
[1:12:35] of the promised world taking the
[1:12:36] promises and wrapping yourself into it
[1:12:39] god you promised me the holy ghost thank
[1:12:40] you lord you promised me deliverance
[1:12:42] thank you lord you promised me a
[1:12:43] breakthrough
[1:12:44] you keep taking promise after promise
[1:12:45] you come give me freedom and knowledge
[1:12:47] and temperance and patience and you
[1:12:49] wrapping yourself in all these precious
[1:12:50] promises rapture
[1:12:52] the resurrection you're wrapping
[1:12:54] yourself up we're going to close
[1:12:57] this verse here verse 7 his wife had
[1:13:00] made itself ready
[1:13:02] it changes uh the perspective
[1:13:07] of putting everything on god
[1:13:10] you know god over gets out everything
[1:13:11] will gather for good and love god
[1:13:13] the more we call according to his
[1:13:14] purpose it changed that perspective
[1:13:18] and it bring into view something that
[1:13:20] isaac spoke about
[1:13:22] you have all the knowledge but you're
[1:13:24] not ready for the exams
[1:13:26] the syllabus i just love that reference
[1:13:29] and type
[1:13:30] the syllabus is the body of knowledge
[1:13:32] being taught
[1:13:33] to the students but the exam
[1:13:37] is honed to bring out the best out of
[1:13:40] the knowledge that you have sometimes i
[1:13:43] remember
[1:13:44] uh think maths exams and the teacher
[1:13:48] brought some much
[1:13:48] problems and they somebody shouldn't
[1:13:51] respond but still he never taught us
[1:13:53] that
[1:13:55] indirectly they were taught that
[1:13:58] but what was needed was to put together
[1:14:02] the different things that he taught
[1:14:03] to get the solution to it so the teacher
[1:14:06] is not stupid
[1:14:08] they're not going to say be a white boy
[1:14:09] or a spell boy and give you some kind of
[1:14:11] easy something
[1:14:13] there is no test if it is everybody will
[1:14:16] pass
[1:14:16] away think about that if the test is
[1:14:19] recited abc
[1:14:21] everybody going to pass as long as they
[1:14:23] reach from a to z
[1:14:26] but the test is to bring all the best
[1:14:30] that separates you from the rest that is
[1:14:33] what the test is about
[1:14:34] his wife had made herself ready
[1:14:38] that means his wife is conscious and
[1:14:40] aware that there are things
[1:14:43] that she has to do
[1:14:47] preparation is what it's all about just
[1:14:50] say but isaac said after five years
[1:14:51] somebody cannot come to you with a
[1:14:52] certificate or come to you with some
[1:14:54] kind of education five years in school
[1:14:55] i know fellas and some guys after five
[1:14:58] years
[1:14:58] they feel school was their whole life
[1:15:01] all of a sudden
[1:15:02] they're shaking to come to the office to
[1:15:04] find out what their results are
[1:15:06] they realize that their school life now
[1:15:09] is coming
[1:15:10] to a close the life ahead of them is
[1:15:12] uncertain
[1:15:14] they play the fool they make jokes the
[1:15:17] kicks they laugh
[1:15:18] and all of a sudden it's all over
[1:15:22] and i'm thinking to myself one day
[1:15:25] there'll be a last woman
[1:15:28] one day there'll be a last special
[1:15:32] one day there'll be a final gathering
[1:15:37] it'll be over it will be done let's bow
[1:15:40] heads
[1:15:40] for the prayer almighty god i thank you
[1:15:44] tonight for this time
[1:15:47] of fellowship with your children and
[1:15:50] they are so patient and they
[1:15:52] listening and i certainly appreciate the
[1:15:54] fact that they will take this time out
[1:15:57] to be with us tonight to hear
[1:16:01] what we have to share and it's
[1:16:03] concerning their own heart
[1:16:05] lord i believe in my heart that you saw
[1:16:07] something in them
[1:16:08] that's why you called them you said no
[1:16:09] man can come except the father draw
[1:16:12] lord you call us not because we were
[1:16:14] nice and clean and whole and well
[1:16:17] but we were undone we were naked we were
[1:16:19] wretched we were miserable we were in
[1:16:20] sin
[1:16:21] but you call us not to leave us in sin
[1:16:24] or leave us in iniquity or leave us in
[1:16:26] on penis or filthiness
[1:16:27] but you call us to clean us up and we
[1:16:30] thank you father that this word of
[1:16:32] sanctification
[1:16:33] of cleansing as a labor in part like
[1:16:35] root laboring in the field
[1:16:37] father god we thank you you said who you
[1:16:39] justified you had already glorified
[1:16:41] and the scripture has did not identify
[1:16:44] the working
[1:16:45] in between justification and
[1:16:47] glorification
[1:16:49] that scripture that part in between is
[1:16:51] the sanctification
[1:16:52] or the laboring part of the stretching
[1:16:54] part the striving part
[1:16:57] the pushing part we receive faith and
[1:17:00] revelation
[1:17:01] and we press and push and strain and
[1:17:03] labor to press towards charity which is
[1:17:05] the rest
[1:17:06] we press towards god's rest
[1:17:10] father tonight i pray that this broken
[1:17:13] up lesson tonight

[1:17:16] hearts would bring
[1:17:18] lord a real uh a vision to them
[1:17:23] that you call us to glory and virtue not
[1:17:26] the slapness
