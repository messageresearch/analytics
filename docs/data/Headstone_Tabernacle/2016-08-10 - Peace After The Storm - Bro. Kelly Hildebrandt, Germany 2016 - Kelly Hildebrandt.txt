amen God bless you you may have your seats just momentarily good morning it's good to be gathered together again with the saints of God and I'd like to publicly thank brother Conner burner for the invitation to come to the convention here and and also for meeting our every need that we would have and God bless you and your wife and your family I come from a little Country Church uh in Saskatchewan up in Canada and I guess I was about 5 years old when my dad and my mom started going there and that's where I cut my teeth was on a message Pew so to speak and uh I thank the Lord for what he's done in my life I look back and many of my peers unfortunately they're no longer serving the lord but we're trusting the Lord would get a hold of their lives as a teenager growing up I remember um brother bcll coming to minister in our church there and how that he always stirred our hearts and and when he would speak it would just give us an unction to do something for the Lord and when I heard him yesterday when he was ministering uh I can see that it's only intensified within his life the passion that he has for the Gospel of Jesus Christ brother Tim pro it yesterday when he was ministering I I was just overwhelmed by the words that he had to speak giving an account and I just purposed in my heart that I'm going to give it 100 10% every day that I have left in order to be sure that when I stand on that day that the Lord would be well pleased in in what I've done as a pastor of a church and to lead the flock of the Living God according to his Divine will and to according to his Divine Purpose I appreciated the message of Brother John and brother Isaac and for the passion that they have and for the labor of love that they have if you have your Bibles at this time we could stand together I'd like to turn to Philippians chapter 4 and I'd like to read from verse 8 to9 and then also St John chapter 6 verse 16- 21 Philippians chapter 4: 8-9 Paul is speaking here and I I love the words that he speaks here he says finally Brethren and I believe that each one of us could say that that this morning hour whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue or any strength and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you amen St John 6: 16- 21 very familiar scriptures this morning and when even was now come his disciples went down into the sea and entered into a ship and went over the sea towards capernium and it was now dark and Jesus was not come to them and the Sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew so when they had rode about 5 and 20 or 30 furlongs they see Jesus walking on the scen it must have been a great event and drawn nigh unto the ship and they were afraid but he saith unto them it is I Be not Afraid then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whether they went God bless you you may have your seats this morning this morning for just a moment of time I'd like to just share with the lord has laid upon my heart and I trust that will be a blessing to you there's peace After the Storm there's peace After the Storm the disciples they were moving right in the middle of Duty and and Jesus had talked to them and they'd seen great Miracles and Jesus had asked the disciples to get into the boat and and go to the other Shore and I think it's wonderful to be led by the spirit of the Lord amen and all of our lives that's what we would desire in the message and thy seat shall possess the gates of the enemies brother brandham says one writer said one time that when they got in in that place and wondered what Moses would do and he had one command and that was go forward amen if you're in the line of duty no matter what stays in the way the greatest experience I've ever had is to come up against something I can't get over it or under it and just stand there and watch God make a way through it that's the way to do it just move keep moving press your nose against it just keep moving just keep going on God Will Make A Way amen I believe those must have been the sweetest words that those disciples must have heard at that time in the midst of their turmoil it is I be not afraid I think many times of a turmoils of life that each one of us possibly have come through and that we're going through right now and to hear the words of the Lord to say it is I Be not Afraid amen we're we're told in the scripture that he said he would never leave us nor forsake us but he be with us even in us until the end of the world Amen sometimes you may not feel that he's with you but the scripture says and declares that he is with you amen therefore if he is with you no matter what you're going through in life you can be assured of one thing that Jesus Christ is with you amen it's as if I can hear those words as they went from the lips of Jesus and and I'm I was thinking about it and I was thinking how instantly the winds ceased in that moment of time and how that they were instantly transported to the other Shore it was such a supernatural event and and here they were in the midst of a trial in the midst of a storm but in the midst of that trial in the midst of the storm Jesus Christ came on the scene amen and they were something something Supernatural transpired amen every time I've ever come to something in my life God has always come on the scene amen and when I've come to the end of that trial within my life I've always become more rooted and more grounded in Jesus Christ Our Lord amen because he has promised in his word to be with us Amen to the end of the world Amen now we can look at this and we can see that it's our big brother it was Jesus the son of of God and and he spoke and there was another atmosphere that was created and the winds and the waves they obeyed his voice it was creative power that went forth at that time amen he spoke the words and everything came to a halt amen if we could be so resolved in our lives in this hour that we realize in the midst of our storm that Jesus Christ is on the scene amen and he's given us what we have need of in this hour we have a message in this hour and that message was not just for brother Bram in his day but that message is for each and every one of us in this hour that we're living in today that message that he gave us was not something that we're to debate over and and have all of our arguments over but it's something that we're to believe within our heart amen something to be lived a life to be lived in this hour the life of Jesus Christ emanating from each and every one of us amen he came on God came on has seen this hour to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers amen so that we can have the same faith that they had back then that we can have it today amen I remember the time when brother Brandon was on the Colorado mountain and he was hunting up in that time amen and he was way up there and he told the people in the camp he said if all of a sudden a storm comes in and there was a storm supposed to be coming he said if a storm comes in at that time he said just make sure you get off the mountain real quick amen but as he the storm was coming in and and brother Bram was starting to come off the mountain all sudden something started to speak to him and told him to go back into that storm amen and they gained something that would be against human nature he turned around and started to go back into that storm amen the Lord spoke to him we know the story The Lord spoke to him and said speak to the storm and whatever you say to the storm that's what's going to transpire amen what would happen if the Church of the Living God would start speaking to their storms that they have within their lives amen there would be an atmosphere created in the home there'd be an atmosphere created in the church amen because Jesus Christ would come on the scene amen do you believe that tonight this morning hour amen God's word has a way for believers to let off the let off the pressure we're living in a time period where where things are moving incredibly fast we live in a time period when situations around us are changing at an incredible speed there are times within our lives when our World Turns Upside Down amen it's as if our world seemingly comes to a complete halt no doubt you've had these experiences in your life I've had these experiences within my life and in those times is when we look to the Lord to help us to move through those times amen there's three things that happened in our scripture reading today number one Jesus was walking on the water and we know he's an everpresent help in the times of trouble we also realize it was the calming of the storm that transpired and also we realize it was a supernatural transporting of the disciples to their destination amen the children of Israel when they were in the line of duty just give me just a moment here just relax myself self and when they were in the line of duty and God had brought them out of Egypt and they saw many signs and wonders and the Bible tells us that he didn't take them by one way because unless they would see battle and War and they want to go back to Egypt what he did at that time is he brought him into a place where they couldn't go to the left or to the right or they couldn't go forward or backwards and it's in those times that God wants to show his Supernatural power amen it was that time when they stood at the at the banks of the Red Sea and Pharaoh's Army had coming in behind them amen and at that time the Lord spoke to Moses why are you crying why don't you speak to the situation that's before you amen and we know that Moses spoke to the situation and we know that the the wind came down and it started to divide the Red Sea I've often thought about it how wide a path the Lord must made for the children of Israel to come through there was 2 million of them or more and and they're coming through the Red Sea now and they're transporting their way through no doubt if I would have been walking along there I I think sometimes I wonder what it would have been like just to stick my hand through the side of the water just to see this big pile of water that's pushed up on the side of me saying Lord how did you do that but it was in those times that they came through and in the heart of Caleb and the Heart of Joshua there's something that was settled within their heart every that they had seen they had only seen the power of God they seen the miracle working power of almighty God we've heard many testimonies through the last few days and those testimonies are not just something that I hear but there's something that I settle within my heart amen because God is still alive today amen God is still in the in the business of helping you today amen he's still in the healing business he's still in the saving business amen he's here in order to help you through life's journey if we can only trust in his word amen God loves to show us power he likes to show us how he can take somebody that's deep in sin and and turn their life to be a Godly Saint that's right it was a few years ago and and brother Tom Ray was was at our convention in in sept setember and there was this young woman that came to our convention her name was armanda and she came there just a girl off of the street and she was full of piercings and she had tattoos and she was dressed very immorally but she came on a Saturday night and God started to speak to her heart and service after service she continued to come to church and service after service the Lord was dealing with her there's never one time I spoke on conduct or how you should dress or anything of that nature and her testimony was that every Sunday morning when the word went forth something convicted in her heart and she would go to the restroom and take a piercing out of her body it was about three or four months after she started she was coming to church she would you looked at her and you would think that she was there all her life her dress changed her hair changed everything about her changed her life was in a turmoil but God came on the scene and completely changed her life we were at a young people's meeting and and she spoke to me and she said brother Kelly if if you would have only known my life a few weeks ago and she wanted to tell me about her life I said sister Amanda I don't want to know about your life she told me with tears in her eyes she said brother Kelly I Can't not believe there's a God that can forgive me for what I've done I said the beautiful thing about it is my sister is that you've just only grown to know the saving power of Jesus Christ amen while you were a sinner he saved you amen today she's married to a Christian man and and she serves the Lord with all of her heart amen why because of the power of Jesus Christ her life was in a turmoil but God God came on the scene and gave put something within her heart amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen he knows how to take a young man or a young woman who has taken a wrong road and and bring them back to a place and and make Sons and Daughters of the living Gods about them of them amen amen I'm so grateful to the Lord that our names your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world amen he knows who you are he knows your address he knows all about you amen your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life amen and my Bible says he's not going to leave one of them here amen he's coming for every son and every daughter of the Living God Amen I believe as the brothers ministered already it's our duty as the Church of the Living God Amen to have such a passion within our heart for the lost souls that are there and for our loved ones amen that God would use someone use you or someone to minister to the needs of some person amen I believe it's going home time amen I'm ready to take a Rapture amen my whole desire is for Rapture amen my whole desire is that God would come on the scene and that we be moved from this place that we're living in amen I minister at home many times and I I mentioned this to the people I said wouldn't it be something if the presence of the Living God would come in such a strong way amongst us that a backslider or somebody that doesn't know the Lord would get their heart right even before the service started amen but it seems like people have grown accustomed that they wait for the song leader or they wait for somebody to get him in the spirit when we should already be in the spirit there should be a holy hush upon the congregation of the living God Amen that God would move amongst us in a mighty way meeting every need of every person do you believe that t this morning amen there's no situation that catches God by surprise there's nothing at all that catches him off guard amen he's not he's not surprised at what we go through he knew it before the foundation of the world Amen brother brandham told us that he did something very specific pafic he took your picture and he put it into the file of predestination amen and that picture was put there before the foundation of the world Amen not at your best 18 or 19 years old but what he saw you before the world began amen and we come up in a certain time frame and in this time frame that we come up in it is as it's God that has ordained it and God that has specifically placed you in this time frame amen so that we can live as Sons and Daughters of the Living God Amen we're coming through the dark room as it were where our lives are being developed and there's many things sometimes that the Lord wants to kind of just pull out of our Lives amen I read a article one time it was about a mosquito we have those in Canada unfortunately and lots of them and they say that a mosquito can lay an egg and that a can lay dormant for up to 8 to 10 years I don't believe there have been any mosquitoes in the Millennium in 8 to 10 years you say brother Kelly what's relevant of that if there's any besetting sins in your life amen be sure to allow the Lord to take him out of your life amen because something can lay dormant for a long time and all of a sudden there's something that triggers it and something starts to push it Forward also I read about an article I don't remember the name of the bug but it was a little bug that can actually lay its egg and that egg can be laying there for up to 18 to 19 years you can drown it you can crush it you can do whatever you want to do it but there's only one thing that can kill it and that is fire amen I believe we need the Holy Ghost and Fire amen that's moving amongst us amen I I believe in jumping I believe in shouting I believe in all that but I'll tell you what we need is something that goes way down on the inside that brings a resolve to our heart that we know who we are in this hour that we are the children of the Living God Amen GL Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen what do we have to fear church if God is for us who can be against us amen I believe that they were Witnesses the Supernatural and I believe that Supernatural impacts each of our lives in a specific way and individual way at that time when Jesus was here some people believed well others they just ridiculed it and they mentioned that he cast out Devils by the spirit of Beba when I started in the ministry there was a a man that I knew that I've known for many many years and he's an elderly man now in his 90s and and he he was in brother branham's meetings in Calgary and he told me and my brother he said you know that was just something that he was reading their minds I told him I said no he wasn't reading their minds it was a super natural God that was on the scene and we cautioned him not to say anything about it and and he spoke to me and he said he said Kelly he said if I would be you I would go to a Baptist Seminary and I would get some Theology and things like that and I I said I I thanked him for that I said but you know I said I really don't need any theology I said what I need is to get down on my knees and ask the Living God what should be ministered to the people amen I believe that's the way that we need to do it in this hour amen is to have God come on the scene amen some people they laugh at it and some people they think it's it's of the devil but we believe it's the power of God Amen disciples had witnessed the supernatural happenings within their life and I can only imagine how it must have shaped their thoughts towards Jesus in certain ways do you hear the words of Jesus in in St John chap 1: 42-49 when he said to Simeon he said Thou Art the son of Jonas and thou shalt be called cfas and Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and he saith to him he said behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no G Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest thou me and Jesus answered and said before Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee no doubt these disciples they testified amongst themselves and and they were talk about what the words were that Jesus had spoken amen he would say he must be the Messiah he must be the king of Israel they witnessed the ill- fame woman at the well are we here this morning they witnessed a Noble's man's son in Galilee and how he was made well and the impotent man at the pool of bethesa they just witnessed the 5,000 being fed with Five Loaves and a couple little fishes amen amen and the disciples had witnessed all these say and they were talking about it and it brought such a peace about them and a resolve and a calmness about them their testimonies of what they have heard brought a reassurance it brought something in their hearts that that brought a settl we would say it would bring a peace I can just imagine what it would have been like to sit there in the middle of the SCA many times we have witnessed the Supernatural and people have experienced it and brings a calmness in their lives and a subtleness within their hearts what God has done in the many great things as they gave testimony to the supernatural power of God and then out of nowhere as they were in the middle of the sea the the wind started to come down on them now remember they were in the line of duty and they were sitting there and Jesus had told them to go before them and it caught them off guard and it caught them under unaware and it completely turned their world upside down amen they had rode halfway across and by God's grace i' been on that sea right in the middle of it and it would be about three or four miles and there they sat in the right the middle of turmoil they couldn't go to the right and they couldn't go to the left amen they had no desire to go back because it was the same distance as going forward they had a real pressing desire within their hearts to continue to move on but it it looked like all hope was gone the mountains around that sea maybe would go up to about 3,000 ft or something of that nature and and Jesus was up on top of the mountain and he was watching over them that day and he saw exactly what was transpiring all the time sometimes we think we're alone but His Eye Is on the Sparrow today church amen he knows what you're going through in this life Amen brother bradam in testimony raising a dead M dead boy he said oh I tell you this is the most marvelous thing that I've ever seen in my life is the greatest hour of my life is when I get up against a wall that I can't get over it or under it or around it he said that's right then I trust God and he opened the way and I go through the thing God takes you through it amen God will always take you through it amen no matter what the trial is God will pull you through your trial amen blessed be the name of the Lord sometimes we look at the height of our problems and we see the waves that are crashing down upon us but he promised that he would take us through that trial amen they looked at the height of the the heights of the Waves they looked at everything that was around about them they saw everything and it looked exactly like the time that that nothing would help them in their condition not realizing that the promise was already on the way Jesus was already coming to them at that time amen we know the scripture how that Jesus started walking out on the sea what a great thing that must have been to see it but Jesus always does something very interesting he always made it look like he was going to go past cast him amen they had to compel him to come into their ship amen they had to say something to tell them to come into their ship amen are we together this morning church amen and they s they were in this turmoil they didn't know which way to go they were up against a wall in their life and God was on the scene their testimonies were soon forgotten maybe I'm just speaking to myself this morning or I don't know but their testimonies were soon forgotten at that time and the peace of God which seemed so real to them seemed to fade away to the fear of the unknown that's the time we need to be assurance that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by God Amen we need to know that he knows my name amen we need to realize that we're engraved in the palm of his hand we need to realize in our lives that he has never saved us to lose us but he promised in his word that he's going to take us through through right to the End Amen he's the one that begun the good work in you he's the one that begun the good work in me and he's the one that's going to complete that good work in each and every one of us amen it's the power of almighty God that comes on the scene in order to help us through our situations and our trials amen His Eye Is on the Sparrow I know that he's looking after me I know he's watching over you amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord to the physical eye they couldn't see him but the Mighty God the great creator of the heavens and the Earth the sustainer of the universe the one who created the Sea of Galilee amen had his eye on them at that very moment of time blessed be the name of the Lord they didn't know it but the answer was on the way to them amen he's always on time he's never late amen sometimes as we think of Lazarus but he was right on time amen he was never one day late amen he knows when to come on time amen he's looking to see if we have confidence in his word he's looking to see whether or not we'll stand upon his word with all that's within our heart amen it don't matter who falls to the left or who falls to the right amen your resolve must be in Jesus Christ amen because he's the one that made the promise he's the one that said he'll take you through amen we've got to believe his word in this hour his word is true I was listening yesterday to a message and brother Bram said that he said he said on this message he said if we would get the right Faith within our heart he said in the next five minutes there would not be one feeble person amongst us I say oh God if there's any unbelief in our hearts in this hour take that unbelief out of our Lives if there's anything hindering the moving of God then come on the scene and move it from our lives tear it out of our hearts that we can stand as Sons and Daughters of the Living God blessed be the name of the Lord amen he wants to move through our lives amen he wants to use our lives as a testimony of his power amen that we can have a witness to some person along life's way we can give them courage in their trial brother don't give up sister don't give up amen he's with you amen he's going to take you through your trial he's watching over you in this hour but we have to have confidence in his word trust in his word it's easy when we're sitting here amongst the Saints of the Living God Amen to say that we believe his word but when we leave this convention and we go home on Monday and we go home on Tuesday brother Bram said that the Satan will come at that time and test you to see if what's in your heart is settled within your heart amen I trust it settled in your heart amen I trust you've got a passion for this gospel amen that you're going to live it with all that's within your heart amen there's too much intellectual con intellectual faith in this hour what we need to have it do is drop down on the inside of the inside amen until we can stand upon the Rock of Ages knowing that God is going to bring healing to our bodies Deliverance to our families amen he promised in his word it's up to us to believe it amen it's easy to listen to testimony say may that stirred my heart but when your turmoil starts when your situation happens where you going to stand at that moment amen God loves to test his children amen we we read about job in the scripture and we find that job in the scripture the Bible says that there was a man in the Land of Oz and his name was job and the man was perfect I looked up that word perfect in the Hebrew and that word perfect in the Hebrew means that he was an ordinary man it also goes to the Book of Solomon where he said he was undefiled why would it say he's ordinary he's just like me and you what he did is he applied the token he applied the sacrifice that was necessary for his day and for his hour little did he know at that time that there was going to be a conference between Satan and almighty God Amen and he stood in the presence of God he said have you considered my servant job and Satan said to him yeah I've considered him but you've got him hedged in it doesn't matter what he does you bless him in all all that he does Satan says to him I can get him to curse you curse you God had so much confidence in job yes that he said okay you can go but don't you take his life amen and we read the scripture and the Bible is very detailed and all the different events that transpired at that time it talks about his children it talks about his wealth it talks about everything about him and then Satan comes on the scene and completely destroys everything in one day and have you ever noticed one thing in the scripture that there was always one person that was left in order to bring the report amen Satan likes to tell you that you can't stand in this hour but I'm here to declare unto you this morning hour that you're more than able to stand in this hour and live an overcoming life because Christ is here and if Christ is here and he settled within your heart it doesn't matter what the enemy brings on the scene you can stand in this hour and stand upon the word of God Amen the young people may think brother Kelly what I've got through all these trials I've got all these pressures in life I've got all all this peer pressure in life I can tell you this morning hour that I also sat in the same position I sat on a church pew I had a lot of young people around me but I made a decision within my heart amen if they went that way I was standing on the word of God I was not going to go out to the world and do the things of the world I made a decision to serve God you have to make a decision you say brother Kelly I want the Holy Ghost he wants to give you the Holy Ghost Amen brother brandham said that if you could take all the oceans of the world and put him into a big vat and and put it onto a 2-in pipe and the pressure on the bottom of is how bad he wants to give you the Holy Ghost amen you say brother Kelly well I don't have the holy ghost in my life I was reading a quote here just the other day and brother Brandon was talking to a man and this man was saying I've been looking for the Holy Ghost and and somebody told me to come talk to you I went to this church and they told me how to do this but there was still something in my heart and I went over here and they told me I how to do that but there was still something in my heart amen and brother Brandon says what do you think was leading you all along the way here amen it was the Holy Ghost he said you mean I have the Holy Ghost he said you have the Holy Ghost over here it was God that was moving in your life blessed be the name of the Lord what gives you strength in this hour is the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God Amen His Eye is on a spare Amen brother brandham says and their eyes were open and they knew he said in the these discouraging times comes to every believer to test you and to try you and to see if you really do believe every son that cometh to God must first be tested and child trained amen the one who took the Loaves and the fishes and they break it with each as he broke it and there was another piece they didn't know it at the time but Jesus was on the way to meet their need he climbed off that mountain and he came to the place where they were at and it's as the Lord does with each one of us we sing that song in Canada it reaches to the highest mountain and goes to the lowest Valley no matter where you are this morning the Lord knows your condition he takes depression away he takes sin sickness away he takes everything away if you're serious with him he'll be serious with you amen Jesus knows our every need he uttered the most beautiful words that I can think of at that time in all of their ter turmoil and he said it is I Be not Afraid the direct translation of it is I in the New Testament is is I am when I am that I am is on the scene as brother bcll said last yesterday morning or afternoon something Supernatural is going to happen hallelujah amen in the Book of John there's seven metaphors in there one of is I am the bread of life I am the light of the world I am the door of the Sheepfold I am the Good Shepherd I am the way the truth and the life I am the true life I am the resurrection and the life amen I am is a self-existing one amen and when he comes on the scene something Supernatural is going to happen amen he never allows a child or daughter of God Son of God to come into a situation without something coming out on the other side amen he may want to put your roots down a little deeper amen there's Winds of Doctrine Winds of a lot of things but sometimes he just wants to put your roots down a little bit deeper amen the winds blow and things transpire but we're going to stand in this hour as Sons and Daughters of God Amen we have a Rapture to take we have a body change us before the Church of the Living God brother brandom said I can't see no more more for the church except for the Rapture amen I'm looking towards the Rapture Church blessed be the name of the Lord I have a picture on my on our dresser at home it's when sister Myra and myself got married I was really young and she was really young we've been married 36 years you say how young were you brother Kelly I was 19 years old sister Mara was 16 and a half we kind of grew up together two lovely children that serve the Lord now I told her I said you know honey I said that picture that we have of our wedding I want that to stay on my on our dresser if we could because someday I I want to see when I see myself in the mirror church I don't want to have a shock I want to remember what I look like when I was younger I won't have any glasses you won't have any hearing age you won't have any false teeth you'll be changed when I was 18 19 years old I don't know what happened I had light kind of a medium brown hair I don't know what happened to turned black on me but when I go back to being that age again it's going to be medium brown hair amen I was a lot thinner than than what I am now amen I had a lot more energy back then what I have now amen but I know one thing church is there's going to come a time amen where we're going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye are you preparing for that event amen when you have trials in your life it's to bring you to that time of rapture amen Jesus in the scripture was identifying himself that he was Jehovah of the old and he's Jesus of the new he is Alpha and Omega he's a present he's a future he's the Everlasting he's deliverer deliverer of his people he who is and was and is to come he's a savior of all men from their sin death hell Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he's my all and he's my all I trust he's your all and he's your all Amen brother Bram in this message here to whom shall I go he's praying he said I am was not yesterday nor tomorrow it's ever present the same I am in every age and every generation all through eternity it's still I am now you are still the great I am not the I was or will be yet you was and you will be but yet you're ever present I am amen Jesus has a way of making himself known to us do you believe that church amen you may not be on the water you may not be on the sea but in every and all situation he comes across in life they deepen our love to him amen it deepens our love to Jesus Christ amen I have a few testimonies that I wanted to share brother coner burner asked if I would share a few testimonies and I just want to share a few if I may at this moment of time our grandson Isaac he was about 3 months old his potassium was down to about 9 or up to 9.7 his sodium level was down to 149 and his creatin was at 140 he was only three or four months old Sister Laura had called me and she said dad I don't know what's wrong with Isaac he's not responding he's getting limp and he's just losing all strength I say this for the glory of God sometimes there's your life goes into a turmoil and so I prayed with her on the phone and she took Isaac into the hospital when they took him into the hospital the doctor looked at him and immediately put him into a into a uh Intensive Care Unit and they said that they didn't hardly couldn't even believe that he was still living at that moment so Jonas called me and I went into the hospital there and it was actually a do freezen that was the the caraker at that time in that room of the hospital and I remember when we just put set a little prayer never forget that moment we said a little prayer and we said Lord you gave this little one to Jonas and Laura and the enem is here to try to rob it of the life of This Little Child the doctor was going to give him some more medication to make some corrections in his potassium and especially his sodium because they were at such extreme levels they were exactly opposite to what they should be and he said he said you know let's take one more blood sample and let's see where his levels are right now they took another blood sample and they waited and the blood sample came up and the doctor read it and the first words out of his mouth were there must be a lot of people praying for this little child then he stopped cuz he realized what he had said [Applause] he said well maybe we had something to do with it as well but I'm here to tell you this morning hour that God came on the scene and touched that little person's life he was only he's born with one kidney right in the middle of his of his abdomen here and the umbilical court on the inside was actually coming across it and was cutting his kidney off and the doctor said that his kidney was actually was dying and so they did an operation on them at a four four months old and they corrected that problem and from that day forward church I'm here to testify for the glory of God he's got stronger and stronger and stronger while I was here in the meeting sister marra just sent me a text they just took Isaac to the doctor he's six years old now and the doctor looked at his blood work and looked at his kidney and everything and he said he's in such good health you don't have to come see him for three more years amen their life was in a turmoil at the time that Isaac was in the in the Intensive Care Unit I was actually called to go to Venezuela to a convention and brother George Smith who is here he was with me there and there was a man in the convention his name is Brother David he only speaks Spanish and Brother David seen me walking around in the compound there brother marcos's Church there in barento and and he said to me he said said brother Kelly you look like you're really heavy on your heart and I said I am and I explained the situation to him of my grand our grandson that was back in Canada and it was one week after the doctor gave the Diagnostics and David told me he says brother Kelly he says I'm going to go home and I'm going to pray all night until I get a word from the Lord for you I thank God for men who stand behind each otherall he went home and he prayed that night unbeknownst to me we actually went to a uh some brother and sisters home for dinner and when we were there for dinner just in my heart just in my heart I said my I wish I had dessert I love I love pie I love cake and sister Mara makes the best pie that you can imagine and I just to my heart I felt that I wish I had a piece of cake right now and so I went back to the compound and here came Brother David walking to me with a package in his hand and he gave me the piece of cake I said to him I said Brother David I said how did you know that I like cake he said to me he said God told me to bring it to you and he said about your grandson he said don't worry about your grandson the Lord show me that everything's going to be okay with him and I'm here to testify this morning everything's okay with him amen because of a supernatural God blessed be the name of the Lord in that meeting there was a woman who was backslid for 17 years and at the end of the service she came screaming to the front and gave her heart to the Lord she said for all these years her life was in a turmoil she said in all these years I've been looking at how can I come back to the Lord and she said this morning I found my way back to to Christ I was back in the country a year after that and she sent word to me she said tell brother Kelly that I'm still serving the Lord with all my heart and with all my mind and with all my soul amen we serve a living God church amen he is alive in this hour amen I was in the country of Venezuela another time and I was at another brother's Church brother gaban it was my first time that I was there and there was at the end of the service there was a sister that that came who was backslid and I didn't know it at the time but she told me in her testimony she said said I have degenerate back problem and she said God told me to come to the service tonight I'm only saying this for the glory of the Lord church and so she took extra painkillers to come to the service that night and as she came to the service that night at the end of the service she came to the front for prayer brother Tony was translating for me and and I just asked her I said sister can I just put my hand on your back and I put my hand on her back and the Lord healed her supernaturally but what was in her life she was backslid and in her life and unbeknownst to me when the prayer went forth the Lord told her everything about her life and what was wrong in her life and to get her right heart right with God and and the Lord would heal her she went back to the doctor the week after and they took another x-ray of her back and all of the compression places that were that were completely squashed God had refilled every compression plate in its position amen and she's serving the lord to this day amen God came on the scene in her turmoil and did something to her heart into her life amen we serve a living God church amen he's alive he's alive forever more I could give many many testimonies today about what God has done but I want to share one more testimony with you and I know if that's brother Ron here I don't know if he's here or not I thought I saw him over there brother Ron has been very instrumental in the life of my my mother especially when we got married 1980 June 7th my mom and dad that year backslid I was only 19 years old instead of my parents supporting me I was supporting my parents my dad actually turned to alcohol and our home became a turmoil my mom cut her hair she wore slack she painted she wore earrings she smoked you would never ever thinking that she was anything but a just a rank sinner bitterness had GRT in caught her heart completely stole her Victory stole their Joy three of my four of my younger brothers were still living at home at that time and for years and years and years my dad and I I I don't say this to embarrass my dad if he would be here he'd tell you it he drank a gon a wine a day and hard liquor beside that's what sin will do when you turn from God the Lord got a hold of my dad in the late 1990s started changing his life but my mom was as hard as rock I asked her one time when I was at a certain place they lived in Cologne I asked her I said Mom I said why don't you come to the service with me and she had never heard me Minister before well she got upset with me she actually was I I I never saw anything like it in my life she said don't try to pressure me in very very loud voice I said sorry Mama I said I didn't know I was doing that I said I I apologize forgive me for I would never want to to pressure you few years back they moved to Saskatoon and they started coming dad came to the church and Mom started to come to the church and periodically then one year brother Ron was there I'll never forget that time my mom he he preached this sermon was an incredible sermon and after we had some fellowship and my mom looked at him and he saidon you must have a button under your tongue instead of a candy You Preach way too long and brother Ron did something hope this okay brother Ron I just say this for the glory of the Lord Brother Ron did something and he just grabbed my mom and hugged her that started to change something in my mom's life her heart started to soften I told my mom I said you know Mom I said you have to forget those things which are behind and press forward to the m Mark of the High Calling of God her life was in a turmoil but she didn't know it yet but Jesus Christ was coming on the scene all of a sudden the Lord would be dealing with her with her slacks and she would just say I'm never giving up my pants couple months later she was wearing skirts amen then she told me she was never giving up makeup all of a sudden she wasn't wearing makeup anymore she told me she said I'm never going to stop cutting my hair next thing you know her hair was growing out last year at our convention brother Ron was speaking and she came up for prayer and she brought a token to me I'm wearing it here this this morning hour it's actually an earring that's converted it into a tie pin she brought it to me and she says I won't be needing this anymore Jesus Christ has just delivered me from this if you had seen my mom today you would never know that she was in the depths of sin I did my part to love her to God and to pray for her and no matter how rough the going was going God came on the scene and did something in her life and changed her life the results of that is is my brother now in Australia he gave his heart to the Lord a few years ago now my sister-in-law who's a Greek Orthodox I just talked to her not long ago with tears in her eyes she said if I would only known what the Bible said I would never have raised my children the way I raised my children we take this message for granted sometimes church but there's sometimes there's people's lives that are in complete turmoil they need Jesus Christ in their life lives sometimes it could be a loved one that's in your life that needs Christ in your life or needs Christ in their life excuse me my sister-in-law is supposed to be coming and for her to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is a very difficult step for her and I'm asking you to pray for her because for her to do that is to completely walk away from the Greek Orthodox and her family is very strong being Greeks themselves and that would actually make them disown her as a as a daughter but God is dealing on her life she's reading the message now she's reading the scripture the Bible every day she's got such a hunger and thirst for the things of God I've seen God do Supernatural things not just in healing but also in the healing of people's hearts and souls and when God comes on the scene and he within the inside of the heart there's something that happens at that time amen I look at when we're sick and we need healing in our bodies he's a great healer and he comes on this scene and he heals us I suffered with asthma for 17 years I was about 23 years old I was in and out of the hospital every week they knew me by my first name in the hospital 17 years later Christ came and he took it from my life amen I can stand here this morning hour be able to breathe and be able to thank God for his grace that he's given me in my life amen we serve a living God church I say this only for the glory of God sometimes our lives turn upside down amen it was just a couple of years ago I hope this is all right couple of years ago our sonin-law just woke up and he fell over and died with a heart attack at 36 years old our daughter's life turned into a turmoil our life became a turmoil I'm going to tell you brother bam says they asked him one time they said did you keep Christ in your life at those time he said no he said but my religion kept me he kept me in those dark hours he kept me in those trying times that I was in amen sometimes our lives go completely out of control we don't know which way to turn what to do we don't know where to go but it's in those times that Christ comes on the scene and does Supernatural things amen and our our our whole life becomes more resolved to serve him in order to be able to take a Rapture someday Amen in the time of trouble I had here not long ago brother BR here lost my wife children everything somebody said to me did your religion keep did you keep your religion I said no it kept me see I had an absolute abolute to know that someday I'll see them again I couldn't have made it if I if I wouldn't have had that absolute it made the difference in me where I was tied because I know that I am I'll see them again now by Grace I'm tied to him that's said I am not I was I am everpresent omniscient omnipotent infinite that he is not I was I am he's still the resurrection he's still the North Star he's still everything to me amen and be it is I Be not Afraid as soon as he entered the ship the Bible said and immediately they were at the shore oh God it wouldn't take but just a little

people here will realize we'll see you walking among the people today as we pray for them may they realize and believe with all their heart and may you come into their heart and may you they make room for you and welcome you into their little boat of sickness and their little boat of sin amen I don't know what you came to this meeting for but I trust that God will bless you in this meeting if you

very good weather today which is very nice especially for the children program we have scheduled a little train for the children and families and also should some young people and adults still fit in you're welcome to join but definitely priority is given to the children and to the families that train will be departing at 300 p.m. and we would like to ask uh those families and parents that would like to send their children on the train to meet in the in the lobby in the reception area at 230 meeting point is 2:30 and the children will get a little ice cream and then they will just take a short walk to the bus station and the bus um will then be so they will be leaving here at 2:45 2:45 is the is the departure for the children and 2:30 will be the meeting point at the reception that is the train number one and the train number two is leaving 1 hour after so meeting point will be 3:45 um for the departure and if you can be there at uh 3:30 so just bear in mind 2:30 meeting point at the reception and 3:30 at the meeting point uh for the Train the little train is taking the children 20 minutes um from here to a place called plow toop in blow boin so whenever you hear Blau that means actually the English translation is blue and it comes from a from a cave that is in Blau boin it's a it's a very large U cave and it it's it basically ends with a a stream where the rivers flow Out and because it's so deep it's all blue and they can walk around and I think it's a beautiful country or beautiful site that the children can see they can spend 20 minutes there and they will be brought back again so the whole tour is about roughly one hour again meeting point 2:30 and 3:30 for the for the children and for their for the for the families and the last announcement is uh for all
