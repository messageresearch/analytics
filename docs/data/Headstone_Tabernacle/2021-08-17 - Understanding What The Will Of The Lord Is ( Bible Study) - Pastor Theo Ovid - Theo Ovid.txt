and amen god bless you saints and welcome to be here tonight please certainly welcome you and no many appreciative service on sunday behold i make all things new and i believe that god is about to do a new thing a new thing in your life a new thing in your heart and what you know what you had in your soul as a seed will become a reality you will have the harvest of joy the harvest of your blessings the harvest what you deliver for what you're praying for god will on your feet in this due season and due time amen so tonight we want to look at some scriptures uh it's my portion to be here tonight matthew chapter 21 we wrote from read from verse 28 to 31 matthew chapter 7 when we read from 18 to 21 and ephesians 5 we want to read from verse 14 to 17. so we want to go to matthew chapter 21 verse 28 and this is jesus a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work today in my vineyard the answer that said i will not but afterward he repented and went he came to the second said likewise and he answered i said i go sir and when not whether of them tween did the will of his father they say unto him the first and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you the republicans and harlots go into the kingdom of god before you matthew chapter 7 you want to read from verse 18. a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree been fought good fruit every tree that bringeth not for good fruit is hewned on and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them not everyone that said unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that do it the will of my father which is in heaven our last scripture tonight is from ephesians 5 14 to 17 wherefore he saith a week though that sleepers arise from the dead and christ shall give the light see then that he walks circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and for a title tonight of this bible study understanding what the will of the lord is so may god bless you and i trust that you're doing fine under that you're holding up under the stress of the test the stress of the test that you could pull up because that is what it is it's being tested being tried you know i was thinking about brother branham's life today and a portion of it when he did not obey god and he lost his wife he lost his baby his child he lost the anointing for five years and i guess in going through that experience it would have been so hard for him as a young minister a young man serving the lord the best are you know how and make a wrong turn if i could use that word in term of obeying god and later on in the years when i guess he could look back at the experience he could speak in adoption he could turn your wife against you he could turn the church against you you can do this he could cast a better sickness and he said he was just testing me so you know sometimes when you are going through what you're going through you feel like nobody understands nobody knows what really is happening and uh maybe you alone go into what you're going through you're not the others are going to identical what you're going to challenged and so on like that and it takes the hand of god and the mercy of god to minister and to help them they all of me you know we speak the word we share the word we share the gospel but god is who really know what is operating in the heart and but isaac gave a powerful teaching on jonah and it's really inspiring to see a note that jonah even though he did god's will eventually by the fish delivering him to preach the new his heart couldn't handle his the expectation of how god will behave which is to forgive and pardon and make amends to those who willing to repent so tonight we want to get down in this thing and see what lord will do see how it will unfold i trust it would help you try now especially even with the bible studies to see and have a heart to what you could apply in your own life what you are hearing because too many are caught up in knowledge and understanding in revelation explanation information and very little of application and um life have to do with application not just information but how you apply how you apply things when challenges come when situation comes how you deal with it how you manage it and only experience could bring you from stage to stage to stage david had beer lion anya golan nobody said me test people saying after beers lying after no life unfolded situation came and he met the challenge our challenge should not be in church let me say that again our challenge shouldn't even be with the word our challenge truly should be with ourselves and we are our greatest enemy and i was sharing something with i think my son um and you know about the destructions of the external where you could blame this one that one the boss you know everything is external and outside and when the external fades and you realize it's not about the external it's but it's what's happening on the inside so tonight understanding what the word of the lord is and not to be a fool not to be unwise but really settling down to ask a question of god's will for your own life god's will god's plan god's purpose god intent not anybody else the will of god for your life so let me share some words with you from brother braham and we will see how we take it from there um i don't know how much of a teaching will be i'll be sharing some quotes and some scriptures and something like that i just would have you but around i think that unless we know the word of god we don't know what to do we can't have faith until we know what is the will of god and then if we know it is the will of god the word of god says something we can gladly follow that now if jesus walk on the earth tonight human flesh here tomorrow it will be raining all day long it would be very easy for me to take an umbrella and leave in the morning because he said it but if he didn't see it i don't know then what to look for so that's the way it is in anything we do we want to know the hour and to know the hour and the age we are living now to the newcomers this week we tried to show that god from the beginning and you heard it sunday was infinite or if he wasn't infinity isn't god so he's got to be omnipotent omnipresent omniscient to be god that is all power knows all things in all places knows the end from the beginning therefore he knows all about what you're going through and what gonna happen so let's continue now the one principle of us being here and then trying to help you and the only way that i know christian friend to help you is to get your feet the best i can by the word of god centered on the will of god for you i want you to think about that he said the best way he could help is to get your feet centered on the will of god for you i remember and gave a story of a young man who had according to africa on the fields and he had a board of elders and a board of whoever is a church board and they interviewed him and they said he'd have malaria there he'd have dystere he's up that they're trying to discourage him and he said he just felt that this is the calling that god put up on his life and eventually he broke out and said if god is leading me to be dear he will take care of me there and that is the fate in the call of god and this is where you have to find yourself plugged in you know not reacting to what others do and to what others see but coming to the spot where you do what god wants you to do now i know many of you will remember that a saying that i give many times that maturity is when you accept responsibility for your actions and your attitude no blaming and in life this is something that i go by you choose your actions if you don't choose your actions you'll find yourself reacting to things sometimes you get hot you get tempered you get anger you know and you're reacting you choose to love you choose to forgive you choose to pray for others you choose to be helpful you choose to be kind this is your choice and you choose that way regardless of the person's response this is not well i will scratch your back because i want you to scratch minds this is not that this is truly your choice in other words because though has chosen it becomes powerful when you know that you are in god's will it becomes absolutely powerful because when you know you are engaged with no demon no devil no weapon nothing could come against you and stop you when you know you are the will of god that is why it is so important to get a hold of getting this will of god as the center point of your life because if god shut a door in your face that is god's will you can rejoice you could shout because it's not you shut the door it's gorgeous if things doesn't work out to the left he doesn't want you to go left he wants to go right and you would see as the will of god unfolding your life more and more you'll be get sensitive to your spirit directing and leading your life so let's continue by god's grace okay so let he said again the best that i can by the word of god is centered on the will of god for you if you can only see that it is god's will to do these things for you it is god's will to save you all it is god's will to heal you all and he will certainly lead you into deeper depths and higher heights if you trust him don't be satisfied with your fire built here from last night this is last night let's build it to a little further tonight never build it in the same place you can't stand still you are either backsliding or going forward let me see it again he said can't stand still you're either back sliding or going forward where you are tonight let's continue jesus we know the scriptures in john 4 before he say my need is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work and he said all the father give it me shall come to me in john 6 37 and him that committed me i will no wise caster for i came down from him not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which had sent me that all which he had given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day this and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which see at the sun and believe it on him we have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day and i was thinking of the illness of the don payment of the baptism of the holy ghost which is a down payment of our inheritance a deposit that guarantees resurrection that guarantees your inheritance a down payment a title evidence of purchase all these things is guaranteed it said grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption you know we hear gospel and hear word and sometimes you don't know what level of consciousness is rich in us the subconscious the conscious how deep is it to understand that we have been purchased you know and the devil can't do anything about it satan lost his estate in him kicked out on the earth and there is no way for him to regain that estate it is incredible that he could see mere mortars humans born in sin shaved iniquity coming to sonship into godship into inheritance is almost like a nightmare for the enemy to see that fallen man could come and be redeemed and to be restored on earth as if they never did sin it's a powerful thing he has no chance whatsoever of getting into this position of sonship godship inheritance adoption dominion he has no chance whatsoever he is dependent on bodies that he can use he's a spirit that has no real authority and right on the street man who was placed here spirit plus dust and unliving soul man who was given the place on it has that right to be here on earth not not satan so that is why he have to find temples bodies people that he could anoint and inspire and use he needs them and just as he needs them the spirit of god need bodies temples you you you here tonight his spirit needs you let me go a little deeper jesus when he says you are the branch he means that he means that true you i would be able to produce fruit now he needs you to produce fruit or we could see it this way he needs you to be a channel by which divine life could flow through and by extension produce fruit jesus is a master builder he is truly god by calling these 12 disciples you know some men they like to have the preeminences whether they are ceo or whatever it is they like the name on the board the name on the building the name everywhere right i know somebody who you know love his name everywhere the more his name show up the better he feels and they could disappear and the reason that they could disappear is because what they have seeded on and reproduced what they have led others to do is to produce more of themselves or replicas of what they can do that is what you call effective leadership so when that leader dies or come off the scene everything doesn't fold up because you have extended the vision and the purpose of the plan to others this is what jesus did he took these brothers from fishing from castle from tax collector all kinds of people and he prayed father that they might believe through these guys that i and you are one he actually removed himself and lose these sons to write another book about and peter step out in such a glorious fashion silver gold i will have such as i have i've given speeches step out and it was amazing because this is the same peter that deny christ showing that peter was a god man he was a man just like elijah just like all these other brothers like passion had their failures had their challenges have their ups and downs but when the holy ghost took the right place on the heart of these brothers it was something completely different altogether and i'm seeing tonight that god the holy ghost would take his right place in the throne of your heart that is what you are called for you are not called into a church pew you are not called to each bench you're not called to join church you are called to be a living representative of the kingdom of god now we read some scriptures and we'll show a time together jesus gave a parable of a man two sons and one said he said one work he said i will not then he repented and he went and woke the other son said i will sir never did it never did it in other words his words and his actions was not in harmony his confession and his behavior was not in harmony what god wants is our confession and our behavior not in harmony no the first brother his words was ultra harmony also he said i will not do it but he repented what that would repent now he repented and went and do it and the question was asked who did the will of the father first one and jesus ripped through them and said my god he said hearts and whatnot will enter to the kingdom of god before them other people i want to bring a point that there is a will of god for your life i am not talking about a confession confession or a profession or what you believe i'm not talking about your belief i am talking about the will and the will is to do let me say it again to will is not to talk the will is to do you know my brother sometimes you know we go through stuff sometimes you know you don't know if it's depression or whatever it is your mind have things and your body don't want to cooperate and you just always seem to pull it together to get things done you have things you would like to do when you're just not getting dear it's just struggle it's a battle you know but there are things to be done and jesus said it i come to do thy will of god as is written on me in the volume of the book so jesus oh let me just read this here god's people came to a place where they wanted to change the program they look upon the philistines the american lights the hittites and they wanted to be like them they wanted a king okay so he says here though that it has never been in any age god's intention for his people to act like the people of the world or to be governed or controlled like the people of the world gorge people has always has been a peculiar people a different people are called out separated altogether different in their action in their ways in their manner of living and the peoples of the world has their appetites for things all their makeup has been always contrary to the things that the people of the world desire now the people of israel came to samuel and said no you are getting old and your sons do not walk in your way because they wasn't true like samuel they were bribers speakers of money and they said samuel your voice is not like you so we want you to go out and find us a king and anoint him and make us a people like the rest of the people of the world so samuel tried to tell them that that would not work he said if you do that the first thing you know you'll find out you call you your sons from your home and make soldiers out to them to run before his chariots and their hours and spears not only that you will call your daughters to make because of bread and take them away from you to feed the army besides all of that he will take taxes over you of your grain of income he will tax all that up to make certain government debts and so forth i think you are all together making a mistake but the people said we still want to be like the rest of the people now there is something about men and women that they long to be like one another and there has only been one man ever lived that was our example as the lord jesus christ he was the perfect example of what we should be about always about the father's business and doing what is right but no matter how much samuel tried to persuade the people continually they went after him day and night we want a king we want a man we want a man that we can say this is our guide here we go are you ready church listen and that has never been the will of god can i repeat it that has never been the will of god it never was the will of god or never will be the will of god for man to rule over one another god rules over man god is our ruler our king i hope this solidifies why i blast the spirit of man so much and blast in nicoletan spirit so much and blast the manipulative control that ministers have over god's people it is wrong it is wrong it is dead wrong it's supposed to be the spirit governing the spirit directed the spirit leading and i'm call it prophetic utterance coming out of it inspiration coming out from the earth he says the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already be said in the word i want you to think now i am not a prophet i am not a messenger i am under a prophetic message so i don't have my own message i cannot label it as if i produce and have a message we speak what god speak and god speaks to his servants the prophets man shall live by bread alone but by every word which proceed out of the mouth of god and the mouth of god is not it's prophets they are the top layer that speaks for god so when we get the words from the prophets and speak it back those are words from god do you get that tonight so it's not we are trying something and you know my ministry and and what i've seen in this i'm seeing it so i think it's honestly so i have not seen it so it's a vision of god going the bible ezekiel i was in the spirit and i saw and god took me here and i saw speak son of man speak what those seers i looked and i saw and i saw this i saw that when god caught up moses into the heavenlies he says see and go downstairs and back on earth and make after the tabernacle make things based upon what you saw this is what vision is about that's why they're so important to understand why god speaks the prophets by vision you could have to see it now it's hard to translate vision into words that's why they rather talk about write the vision make it plain so it's as if you have to see the same vision under the same anointing to speak it back least we run and have our own interpretation amen so let's continue so brother branham says very much the same peril today they choose a man named sword which was the son of kish reputable man handsome man brilliant man but that's the kind of man people like to choose today the people does not seem satisfied with the way that god placed his church to be governed and controlled by the holy spirit they want somebody some man some denomination some certain people stick up in the church they are not able to throw themselves completely into god's hands to be spiritual to be led by the holy spirit they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody that will tell them just how to do it all about it now i'm almost finishing this part here it's a whole lot like today we like to choose such people to to control our churches to control the church of god nothing that i have to say against it but just to make a point it is not here we go it is not one it was not true and it will never be the will of god for such to be god is to rule his people to govern each individual did you hear that god is to rule over his people to govern who each individual say individual that's what you are tonight an individual okay so watch so brother branham was talking about um the senior position in christ and the missions of israel is something that we know remember how we hung on that how many here this morning let's see the mystery of israel is not just a little thing it's a mystery god's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of god for his whole life god's mystery how much time i've preached this how much time i've shared this and i want to ask a question have you ever prayed and asked god for the will of god for your life and who will open it up to you that you will know that you are in god's will you are in god's plan you're in god's program you're conscious of it and as you get more and more conscious of it you could challenge the enemy when he comes in your grounds understands your wrongdoing because you remember in the will of god when when when when peter challenged jesus and said lord when did jesus walk on your water and and jesus peter said lord if that is you beat me to come that was clean a clean challenge is that you let me come jesus said come that was a direct just said the lord the word come peter come peter have faith peter step up right and when peter's had to step on he's had a walk now all these cyprus they could say what they want peter walk on wood okay walking towards jesus devil kick up a stone and when he looked at the waves he got his side off of jesus he began to sing jesus was obligated to help him when he said lord i'm thinking healthy obligated you know why he was responding to the call to the call of god did you respond to the call of god did you call yourself isn't it god i'd call you you didn't set up application said god i waited for you to call me you know you was in bar he was smoking drinking god himself called you you hear what i said was not pastor wasn't a preacher does the spirit of god call you and he have a responsibility to take care of you and to pull you through do you see that tonight if you are willing to repent of your behavior of your attitude if there is to repent repent and god will help you amen praise the lord so i trust tonight that this will be helpful for you all right jesus last words mark 16 15 to 20 jesus is about to depart he said unto them go in go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature it is believable and is baptized shall be saved either believe it or not shall be done and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name we shall cast our devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink and be deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he would receive up into heaven sat at the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere here we go the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following that sounds good i'm confirming the word with signs following let me say it again and confirming what the word in other words the word had to be confirmed if the lord has shocked tonight oh hallelujah confirming the word oh good word oh me that word you hear that it's a good word what does it come from he has his way and this was jesus last words that the word is to be confirmed with science with oneness with miracles no man supposed to take that out don't tell me it's more mysteries hidden mysteries mysteries on top of mysteries and deeper mystery don't tell me that this is jesus own words they went forth and preached everywhere that was in obedience to the instructions the lord confirming the word not with more word but with thanks wonders and miracles church this is what you have to expect this is what you have to believe this is what you have to receive this is what you have to look forward for what jesus said so we're going to continue oh praise the name of the lord but abram here's what jesus said to the church to do and they deny it jesus hears his last words his will and testament to the church into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptizer shall be saved he doesn't believe it not shall be done maybe that's as far as your pastor read but he has the rest of it this is the round these signs shall follow them that believe in my needs shall cast our devils they shall speak with your tongues if they take observance or drink their meetings it shall not harm them and if they lay hands on the sickness are recovered no that is what jesus said for them to do in his name they deny that exist but they go and do just contrary to what he said teach that it is past there is nothing to it teach theology instead no wonder which condition we are in look here my brother when the church oh glory okay are you ready church when the church gets to the place till each member in deer is so charged with the holy ghost and power until sign until them signs will follow oh hallelujah you see all these signs following is charged charged with what holy ghost and power not talk not messages not lectures not information from time magazine and newsweek magazine and this magazine and somebody say it and from facebook and from whatsapp and somebody sends them forward and no no no not that somebody looking for followers they're looking for more views and they're making comments and and saying okay not that no no the holy ghost so charged until signs so then it comes to our next terminology and we find it in the bible peter full of the holy ghost stephen follow that it's a terminology being used full of the holy ghost not for the talk full of explanation full of information full of understand full of the holy ghost with what where we're getting that full of your holy ghost now watch you see when the ship wrecked on the shores paul was picking up some sticks he went and laid them on the fire india was a big super grabbing by the hand or the serpent injected poison in the hand that would have killed him within a minute the native said watch the fellow fall dead he will die just in a minute he's in chains for preaching the gospel watch slip him to the hand now watch paul didn't fear he said jesus christ said if they take up siblings it shall not harm them so he walks over shakes off in the fire turns around walk away get some sticks put on the fire turn himself around warm his back turn around this way later said but why doesn't he die but poor rabbana was so full of the holy ghost what i mean so full of the holy ghost until the poison couldn't poison him now right after that is when he brought a prophecy right after this statement here that is after that statement is when he said this oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god now watch he didn't say full with books he didn't stay full with preachers he didn't say fulbright mysteries he said full with apostles because we have plenty of apostles all around know many prophets meaning son of man half son of man on all kind of thing people claiming son of man ministry and whatnot extra extra with seven injured plus he didn't say that he said give me a church full of the holy ghost what god will do in one year what all the theologians fail to do in 2000 years prophecy coming up you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful little remnant after the doors of the gentiles is closed prophecy god will anoint a church then he who is filthy let him be felt he still he is righteous let him be righteous still he is holy let him be holy still and god will anoint the church with the power of god and things will be taken place not only that then but he is doing this now so he is saying god is doing this right now in my ministry but he will be doing it when the bride come into her position he betrayed them so he's doing it then he's doing know and he'll be doing it then things will be taking place you see right now we're still under time of lingering right now we're under coronal virus right now growth darkness covered in covenant people right now the taliban is back in power right now all kind of the taliban is back don't can you hear taliban italian man there's pressure you know not ordinary banyan or italian one all right they back in position a record with 20 years and millions of dollars trying to prop up the image but the international police day is over the international all what they're doing god is flattening them just as greek and greece and egypt and all these great kingdoms of the earth have rise to power and then come down america is flat it's almost embarrassing but this is the position of america and while their power is being flattened and russia is being the position to take action on god's behalf and bring judgment hallelujah the bride hallelujah the bride is coming into power oh she's not getting less strength and less no no no no no no that's not the prophecy he says as she nears the headstone she will be super race super church oh super bright as she nears the headstone she will have a super sign what is super saiyan god and man together very cold full of the holy ghost i feel inspired tonight hallelujah we are relaxing in this church and i share this with you but i feel inspired tonight a bride is about to come forward is across darkness on no corona virus no lockdown no no vaccine people want to make them vaccinate marketing beasts they know what abandonment says rejecting the seed of god is to take the marketplace he said the people are being marked right now like before that corona virus before it had vaccine before they always strip it off and british talk the people are being marked now for future judgment you are being marked to be sealed with the holy ghost or marked to take the basis so nobody's going to come and tell me i'm piping my head if that's nothing in it i will give me rome pray over the vaccine i'd have nothing to do with me i'd have nothing with no brain to grieve not the holy spirit glory whereby you are sealed until their redemption the seal of god is the holy ghost that is what we're supposed to be focusing on is seal of god not on vaccine and what in it and what it meant and what not in it i don't care what it could be punctuated juice and mango syrup it doesn't matter all the vaccinating all these years and never answer question of what's inside the vaccine because i am not a scientist oh glory to god when i go to africa i'll take malaria tablets i'd take this let me take it man if i don't take it and work i'll come back sick like a dog then you might have sick i can't preach afterwards so you see i had to take it because that's just a requirement when i go to different countries i have to show them a yellow fever card why i have to do that i can see your favorite guys yellow fever you have to have your yellow fever card or they will not allow you into the country so if saints don't be unwise don't be foolish don't be this is serious as i said before satan if he could cut you off before time he will do so he will cut you off because he let the cut of potential yes i might try to cut them off in a ribbon in egypt and a cut of jesus that that's that's their job cut you off before you fulfill your purpose hang in there i don't care if you're here agree hang in there i look if you're sick hang in there i don't care if your car walk properly hang in there you are a life our purpose god raises our purpose you're sick for a purpose the condition around you is for purpose what is the will of god for your life when paul under pressure he actually lord pray take this on me take this of me and then when paul said my grace is sufficient when god dropped that and paul said we'll say i'll rejoice in other words the devil get messed up after that i will rejoice if this grace god has given me to stand and to survive and to live i'm going to rejoice in my condition oh break bless give the lord some praise the saints of god oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god so what hear this so he said uh so you get it give me a church full of the holy ghost follow the holy ghost not full of ministers but full of mysteries not full of long services no not full of the holy ghost okay cooper doing one year what all the children's feelings are in two thousand years he said what we need in our churches is a man that got some absolute what we need in the methodist church the baptist church pentecostal church the presbyterian church is an is an absolute a man of god that will stand tied to the word unto christ hear that word unto christ here we go and bring that congregation under the condition to where each member walks in the condition of this word seeing that word manifested follow them these signs shall follow them i believe and this is my burden tonight that each individual will come listen carefully in the condition of the word super ibrahim is presenting something that is outside the realm of church this is you having a desire to come into a world condition not church listen millions of people go to church they are not examining their lives they're not looking in the mirror of the world that is not the burden right now there are people who rejoice and do not take any vaccine they are deceived not by not taking a vaccine but by their thinking by not taking the vaccine they are the bride or by thinking by not taking the vaccine they're not taking any macritis they are received they come like somebody wearing a long dress long to their ankle and judging somebody who have a dress covering their knees and they think their long dress is a ticket to glory because their dress is longer than that one who cover their knees because their standard is the dresser to be by your ankle they judging things in their own mind i call it the god of their own imagination you can't go there you can't do that you have to see what god requires of us so brother i'm saying hear me you display the token all you believe in is in vain this is not us this is the world he's not talking about the token he talked about the token displayed it's not the same we can preach talking explain talking draw talking have marks about talking but accept this coming to the reality that it could be displayed if that's different you know you could watch somebody do something and say you're going to do it too and feel so miserable you know i see what a sabu um using a power soul and i watch and i feel like i'll do it too and i couldn't pull this i couldn't get string pull i couldn't get started i said but you know this is this is really something you can just watch and because you you you watch david you said looking for glad well that would beat you if you do have a revelation of the will of god for you to be on that battlefield then you can't do that you have to take behind a lion first so you can't jump over behind lion and say you're looking for golem you're looking to get damaged it doesn't work like that david knew he was in gorgeous they even knew that he knew he understood that on the back side there's it no pastor elder deaton usher um song leader no encouragement no teeth no recorder no no no no no nothing like that just him she god bear him sheep god lion and he knew and now i can sing song don't whip me i rather like stuff they comfort me yeah do i walk to man he knew god is with him he knew he's in god's will so when he came and relied i read his beef for almost 40 days and 40 nights or whatever and when david about to leave because his brother is trying to humiliate him you know what people just do already then he say message you know what he's trying to make him feel small because he's not supposed to be wrong right so david said all right i'm going back to daddy i'm going back home when he heard glad he said who is the uncircumcised philistine he tagged him one time put a label on him he's uncircumcised he doesn't belong here because why the land belongs to the circumcised in other words even saying the land belongs to those who are the baptism of the holy ghost circumcision you get that the land belongs to the circumcised he is not supposed to be here so david know that's enemy one day okay so when they're looking for a man david sierra you know and give a testimony of what god did and saul was so desperate anybody except for he said he said go go go go do something yeah have a you have a somewhere david didn't just go in iran miguel he was in god's will and he borrowed if we only get started go do the rest so david god started with the sling began to swim he's saying god the spirit took a hold of his arm and directly stolen his spirit directed that stream but guess what if david didn't step over there that stone can go anywhere it still need a hand for god to use it still needs somebody that's surrendered to gods and this is where you have to see are you going to be that one not the pastor and the pastor of it or could pull you rather than the pastor over tonight you don't know i just seen this suppose this is my last service last exhortation to you and i'm challenging you to get to know the will of god what the will of god is for your life oh what time we are here now let's let's push on all right what about did not jesus say john 6 49 your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead those parents that died were necessary as the forefathers of the people told jesus was speaking did you get that so so let's let's let's take a view from god called god's eyes 400 years generation after generation crying out for deliverance in egypt jacob moses they come to response 2 million people coming out let's say tonight you get up and go stinking and you could see down the road now you could see these two million people not gonna make it you could see joshua and kayla but they don't know that yet you know coming out they're happy hallelujah but you could see 40 years ago 40 years down the road they're dying one by one because of unbelief you could see those parents having children in the wilderness under journey and god looking at the next generation to give glory and honor to him so these parents are necessary so all these two million people came up for one per person to make babies to produce the next generation that might sound blunt but that is the truth so when they say our father is my illness jesus your parent responsible for you here and you are the ones that caught a revelation of this malakai for perfect message now you have to go further than that to get into true preparation because of this very message what's the use if you know the exact date or what time jesus is coming here and everything else and you're not prepared and you could run and give people the information i know the date how many times i know the hour i know the year but you're not ready he explained who in the rapture he said this being not you this being when it's complete is the servant of god in the church of god going to rapture you can't miss the rapture if the magnet is inside of you you can't miss it because the magnet the big magnet command to pick up all those who are magnetizing it it's not you going the magnet going the power inside of you enoch mechanics became dynamics and god took him so the rapture going to be until nothing wow i trust you are 85 tonight all right so whatever do these elect okay let's back up a little bit so your father is a man in the wilderness and they're dead those parents that died was necessary as the forefathers of the people of jesus speaking they perished yet they were in the election of god naturally as joshua and killed the spiritual these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of god which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name romans 4 16 therefore it is a fate that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that which is of the law but to that also which is of the fate of abraham who is the father of us all romans 9 7 the tree says neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promised love that are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and see ration of a son and not only this but when rebecca had also conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children may not yet born neither haven't done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the elder shall seal the younger that is written jacob have i love he so have i hated galatians 3 16 now the abraham and his seed would have promised me he said not and seeds but of many but as one and to thy seed which is christ galatians 3 29 and if he be in christ then i abraham seed and ears according to the promise so watch according to romans 4 16 we find that god has given a short promise to all of abraham's seed and paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because he says abraham who is the father of us all then he goes on not only narrow down this definition but rather to finalize it for in galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise as having to do with election the chosen of god and that is exactly what we have been seeing these here we go who are of the royal seed are the elect of god are the predestinated fore known of god and when the mind of god and his toads in very plain language the true right of christ was in the mind of god eternally do not expressed until each came forth in its designated decree season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride literal spoken word seed bride not man interpreted bride not explain away bride but spook what he says original seed spoken word in other words a word that came out of that prophet the spirit of god knew exactly every quote that he spoke to that prophet that is why we try to share the quotes the way we do because we knew it's original seed it's not i have a dream last night and explained something to you no it is dossier the law that's why i am not in could it be whatever it is the star last night another moon a comet come in this instant venus and mars answer i am no stargazer i'm not here to talk about venus and mars and you see i'm doing so trilateral and illuminati they might do anything you know that is their stuff but we have our stuff to do we doing our stuff tonight we want to know what is the will of god what the will of god is amen so let's continue here okay thus this bride is the literal spoken word she bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god manifesting god in a many-membered body there was christ was god was manifested in one member in the lord jesus christ okay here we go coming to the conclusion as eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of the goddess bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in the flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we he took him in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken with seed manifested in the flesh and those eternal torts now manifest in the flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were born for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed and there is a reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken so let's say the home structure now the ten commandments the ten commandments the first four is our attitude towards god the next six is our attitude towards your neighbor first commandment i'm the lord thy god thou shall have no strange god before me thou shalt not keep the lord even the lord i call in vain remember to keep the sabbath holy honor thy father my mother said those shall not kill those shall not commit adultery don't try not to steal those times witness against thy neighbor don't shall recover their neighbor's wife those shall not cover their neighbors so on this home stretch now i really want to get to ephesians to view it a little different tonight though we always said an ephesians division is the book that i love it's a team that i love and um the adventure we had last was all about ephesians but tonight i want to look at divisions in two parts the first part is revelation doctrine teaching teaching part and the second part is doing applying the actin part all right so i believe that i will say it like this ephesians one to three chapters is revelation doctrine teaching chapter four is like a transitional and to be doing application and then you get five and six six chapters in the book of ephesians so quickly if you have your bibles or you can just listen i just want to run through touch highlights are we gonna close off with the whole thing like tonight ephesians 1 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ would bless us with all spiritual blessings in heaven and places in christ according as he has chosen him before the foundation of the world so this is revelation this is teaching this is unfolding mysteries that we should be holy with all blame with all reforming love having predestinated us unto the abduction of children by jesus christ to himself according to good pleasure of his will this is revelation this is mysteries this is the word unfolded that the praise of the glory of his of his grace wherein he has made us accepted beloved in whom we have redemption to his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has made known unto us having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which had put us in himself in whom he also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the butcher's possession and the degrees of his glory so hearing this is like revelation unfolding of the mystery of god right chapter two just in snippets of it and you are the equipment who was dead in trespassing sins wherein time passed you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now wicked to the chair of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation or life in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh of the mind and what by nature the children of even as others but god was rich and mercy for his great love where he loved us for by grace are you saved to feed and that not ourselves is a gift of god not of works he's mentioned books so it's clarifying our position clarifying where we come from clarifying that god rich and mercy come and his love towards us and so on and verse 10 we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them and through him we have both accessed by one spirit under the father now therefore here we go we are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone chapter three so we don't switch all of that already and like snip it from chapter three for this course i paul a prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles and paul begin to speak whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which is other ages was not made known to the sons of men and there is no reveal onto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit you bring in a revelation here now that the gentiles should be followers of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel that he will grant you his prayer in verse 16 according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that he being written and grumbling in love may be able to comprehend with all sins what is the bread length depth height praise god and to know the love of christ which passive knowledge the love of christ passes what knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god now we go to chapter four and i call this a transition chapter from revelation into action it starts off with one idea for the prisoner of the lord beseech you thank you that you walk worthy of glorification versus your call so you begin to bring in not just revelation or the following of the word he's beginning to address behavior are you getting me saints just like in ten commandments the first part dog shall have another course before me and then don't commit to me by wife comment before good in other words getting into the behavior the action the doing part so i just want to reflect on that here now so paul begins to talk about being worthy of the vocation where we are called these are called people here now i'm talking about all loneliness and weakness listen to description so all the mysteries unfold you bring in revelation that we are partakers of the same body the gentiles the jews we bring in all the mysteries we are predestined to abortion breathe out the holy spirit we are sealed and then four he begins with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love and care endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one calling one spirit this is mystery one and even you're calling one hope of your calling one lord one feet one baptism one god and father of all who's above or two and only every one of us is giving grace according to the measure of the gift of christ and he gives some apostles not one man of all can i say they give not one man of all i mean the man claimed that having all these gifts liars he gives some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers what for for the refine of the saints or the work of the ministry for the eddy fine of the body of christ do we all come in the unit of the fate love of the son of god onto a perfect man unto the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children that's the object torched to and through and carried a boat with never been abducted by the slay of men and contractedness and where they are they're very lying wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love they grow up into him and all things which is ahead in christ among the whole body fit the joint together and compact it like that which every joint is applied according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body onto the infinitive servant love then paul vernon said verse 22 that you put off considering the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the sea for lust so paul now is addressing issues with addressing behavior is addressing the conduct of people in the church what to address in their lives is no longer talking about predestination and the mystery and then you see us in the battery book no no paul give back and unfold all of that and now he's addressing things in people's lives so who's 22 and the amplified says strip yourself of your former nature and put off and discard your old unrenewed self which characterize your previous manner of life and because becomes corrupt to lust and desires that spring from delusion verse 22 says and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and the amplified it says here and be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude so let's go back now that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away a lion speak every man truth with his neighbor that we are members one of another so it says here okay be not be angry and sinner let not the son go down on your right neither give praise to the devil or that is given no room or foothold or opportunity to do talking about believers now that him that stole steal no more we're talking about church folks okay substitute let his teeth steal no more but rather let him be industrious make him honest he said let it i'd rather let him labor working with his hands that thing which is good that he may give to him that needed let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of defined that it may minister grace to the hearers and the amplifier i said let no fall or polluted language nor evil would no unwholesome or worthless talk come out of your mouth but only such speech as is good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others as it is fit into the need until the occasion that it may be a blessing and give grace and god's fever to those who hear it and grieve not the holy spirit but you are sealed until their redemption and let all bitterness and wrath and anger and claim and evil speak and be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake and forgiving you so after all the mystery talk on the mystery of evaluation and inspiration these things is what paul addressing he says let all business be amplified indignation and wrath passion rage bad temper resentment anger animosity quarreling brawling clamour contention slander evil speaking abusive and blasphemous language be banished from you we all malice which is fight illegal pieces of any kind and become useful helpful kind to one another tenderhearted compassionate understanding loving hearted forgiving one another readily freely as god for christ given you all right so we go to ephesians 5. you're muslim then paul said be therefore followers of god their children and walk in love as christ has given himself as an offering a sweet smell and server but fornication and all uncleanness of consciousness let it not be named among you has become its sin amplified but immorality sexual advice and all impurity of lustful rich wasteful living or greediness must not even be named among you as it is fitting and proper among saints courts consecrated people neither filthiness nor foolish talking no justin which are not convenient but rather give enough time for this you know that no more manga nor unclean person nor conscious man who is an idolater she had an inheritance in the kingdom of god let no man deceive you with these vain words for because of these things commit the right of god upon the church of disobedience the amplified said let there be no filthiness obscenity indecency no foolish and sinful city corrupt talk no course chest which are not fitting or becoming but instead voice your confidence to god but be sure of this that no person practicing sexual advice or impurity in thought or in life or one who is covetous who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain for he is in effect is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ let no one delete to delude and receive you with empty excuses groundless arguments but these sins for true these things come to wrath of god upon those sons of rebellion disobedience do not associate or be sharers with them for once you are away in darkness but now you are the light of the lord walk us through the light all right so then come down to the scripture help me put the text on ephesians 5 it says see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and the amplified he said look carefully then how you walk live purposefully and worthily and accurately not as unwise and witness but as wise sensible intelligent people making the very most of the time and i like this buying of each opportunity because the days are evil therefore do not be vague and thoughtless foolish but understanding and fully grasping what the will of the lord is oh my and it says speaking to yourselves in psalms hymns spiritual songs giving thanks for the lord submitting yourselves one to another and a few of god wives submit yourselves your own husbands chapter six children will be your parents so all of this is application right and the law for it is right honor thy father my mother which is the first commandment would promise that it may be well with thee that all long on the earth and the father has provoked not your children to right but bring them in the nurture and the admission of the lord finally my brethren this is the final be strong in the lord and the power is might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wise of the devil for harassment against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers against the ruler of darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having an all to stand stand therefore having your law is good about the truth having known the breast spirit of righteousness your feet shared with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith where it shall be able to quench all the fiery deaths of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and i'm closing with this this scripture the last scripture you will read is some genes and james 1 from verse 19 says wherefore my beloved let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the right of man we could not be righteousness of god wherefore lay apart all filthiness superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness being drafted word which is able to save your souls but be doers of the word not hearers only deceive in your own selves but if any be a hearer of the word or not a doer he's like our man be holding his natural face in the glass for he behold himself great is we and strictly forgetted what manner of man he was but who so looked into the perfect law of liberty and continued therein and he being not a forgetful hero but the doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed if any man among you seem to be religious and bright or not his tongue but deceiving his own heart this man religion is in vain pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in the affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world i'm going to read his name amplified are we going to close understand this my beloved brethren every man be quick to hear a ready listener so to speak slowly take offense and they get angry for man's anger does not promote the righteousness god wishes and requires so get rid of all uncleanness and the rampant outgrowth of wickedness now listen this is too much folks he's talking about here they're not sinners and people outside this is true folks so get rid of all uncleanness and the rampant or growth of wickedness and in a humble gentle modest spirit receive and welcome the word which implanted and rooted in your hearts contain the power to save your souls but be doers of the word will be the message not merely listens to it betraying yourself into a deception by reasoning contrary to the truth but if anyone who only listens to the word without obeying it and being a do of it he is like a man who looks carefully at his own natural face in the mirror for he thoughtfully observes himself and then goes off and promptly forget what he was like oh my so jesus even compare it to a man who hear my words do with them is a man who bill is house upon a rock and then the rains came the other person built this house upon the sand am i standing for 20 years because it rains i come when the rains come it will show what we are standing on so i want to encourage you tonight to seek the lord seek the will of god for your life when you recognize you're walking in the will of god then you know everything's going to be fine let's borrow it almighty god i thank you tonight for your word and your truth and the scriptures lord make it real to us make it real to your children make it real to your people tonight that they could walk circumspect but i was shared with them hold their book of ephesians we could divide it into two parts lord the part of revelation the unfolding of the word they're full of the mysteries and the part where we have instructions what to do husband love your wives wives reference your husband children will be a parent and how to walk in all loneliness and meekness and so on and further it has so much debate and argument over text quotes scriptures and so on and there are things to apply help us that we will not be short in applying the word our hearts to our lives to our families to our loved ones to apply may we have a personal spirit in our heart to listen closely and listen carefully for the instructions that we need to guide us in this life we need to hear direct from you and the way we hear from you is by your word we heard from you tonight lord because your word was spoken tonight and we thank you bless the service tomorrow and we played lord bless uh life services coming sunday father meu so inspire all things i mean the people be inspired lord baby strengthening inner man and may they be truly be blessed bless the sick among us those who struggle in those who may be fighting depression and frustration whatever it is throw their spirits up and revive them and jesus amen god bless you saints we love you and we thank you for being here tonight looking forward to see what you all will do this wednesday and i trust that this session would have been edifying i would help you on long life's journey god bless you good night
