you welcome you to the house of the Lord God bless you on the internet amen all those are hooked up to us this morning we say God bless you in a special way let's turn to our Bibles we want to turn to the book of Hebrews chapter 11 and we also want to read from Revelation chapter 4 amen praise God amen amen hallelujah okay Hebrews 11 I want to read the first uh three verses there more or less um amen and then we'll go over to Revelation so Hebrews chap 11 and reading from verse one and it says now Faith is the substance of hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen now turning over to Revelation chap 4 and we want to read from verse one amen Revelation chapter 4 and verse one praise God hallelujah Revelation 4:1 says after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne may God a blessing to the Ring of his word let's bow head one more time Heavenly Father we've read your word this morning Lord and I pray Lord father that you come and break Lord father these simple scriptures Lord this morning in a powerful way Lord that would edify build up and strengthen your people this morning Lord this little faith message I have here to deliver this morning Lord I offer it to you this morning Lord father I prayer bless it multiply this morning before your people oh God and may your presence just blow out Lord father and sweep over the people Lord and touch each one Lord father and meet their needs Lord grant it oh God in Jesus name I pray and ask it amen and amen you may be seated amen can you give the Lord a little praise offering hallu amen amen praise God amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God let there always be a rumble in the camp this morning praise God Amen where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen praise God and we are in the spirit this morning hallelujah hallelujah and we believe that anything could happen in the spirit not in the natural but in the spirit praise God things can begin to take place amen so I have a title this morning three words Faith expectation transformation amen amen faith expectation transformation and my subject is the things which are unseen amen and amen do you love him this morning so this morning we want to focus on the things which are unseen amen because those are the things that really mean something isn't that right the things that we see around us this is what we call reality isn't that right we call this reality because our five senses are declaring this building or this world or these things that we interact with we call this reality because our five senses are interpreting that to us as reality isn't that right these pews we are sitting on it these four walls they are real amen they keep us in isn't that right Hallelujah we can feel the sun we could feel the rain we are affected by the environment around us because of the things that we see because of the things that we smell because of the things that we touch because of the things that we are experiencing through these five senses these five Avenues of the human body isn't that right but we want to dig a Little Deeper this morning and to dig down into another sense it's just as real as seeing it's just as real as touching it's just as real as smelling it's just as real as tasting but it's just another sense and this sense is known as faith am amen isn't that right and this Faith sense is another sense is what we use to contact the supernatural hallah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and the prophet describe it as as as TV Rays isn't that right Hallelujah they're TV Rays passing through this room there's Wi-Fi signals passing through this room cell phone signals passing through this room you can't see it you can't touch it but if you rest a TV down in front here and turn it on it'll start picking it up amen once you have the little antennas and everything set up just right you begin to pick up signals cell phones are built to pick up signals isn't that right laptops are built to pick up Wi-Fi signals and there's something built inside of you this morning to pick up a certain sound to pick up signals to pick up communicative vibrations from another place from another reality from another world that is more real than this one oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh so we're going to take our time this morning but what is real what do we call real hallelujah what do we say is real something that we could grab or hold of the Bible says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God hallelujah in other words he spoke and it happened yes he spoke and it materialized he spoke and it took place amen amen amen amen it was actually created by the spoken word what you see in front of you all the earth and the trees and the mountains and the valleys and even the things that man has taken with the Earth and made technology and building material and cars and houses and and and and and computer programs all these things were created by a God that spoke it in the beginning Hallelujah that's where it all started when he spoke then it happened when he spoke then it was created yes so this world actually came into being what you see was actually born into existence by something you cannot see isn't that right so today we are not focus on the things that we could see with our natural eyes but today we want to focus on the things that we cannot see because those things are Eternal what you see in front of you one day will fade away yes your bank account will fade away your house will fade away your car will fade away the clothes you're wearing will fade away everything that can be shaken will be shaken but the things which cannot be shaken will remain and those are the things that you cannot see with your natural eyes what what we believe to be here this morning by Fai we have the ability to contact the things that we cannot see oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah isn't that right isn't that right and so many people walk around in the natural walk around in a humanistic realm hey Hal isn't that right oh Hal hoping someday hoping that they could get delivered hoping that they could be set free but I want you to switch over this morning come up higher this morning that voice spoke to John and said come up hither that voice spoke to him and said come out of your humanistic realm come out of your mind come out of your imagination come out of your affection come out of your reasoning there's something I want to tell you I want to show you some things that which that shall be Hereafter but I cannot show it to you in your natural condition you have to come up a little higher you have to come up on another level then I could talk to you so this morning God wants to speak something to you but you got to be willing to come up you got to want to come up come up a little higher begin to do something different begin to worship begin to praise God begin to get into the atmosphere and you watch God drop down and speak to you this [Applause] morning hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God we are no longer creatures of time our promis is to be creatures of Eternity we have representation in our souls amen amen that is speaking of another life that is speaking of another world another world that does exist it's just as real as this one matter of fact it's more real than this one what you see here is just a foreshadow what you see here is just a taste of what that world is this world is nothing compared to what that world is oh Hallelujah Hallelujah come on now we call this world beautiful but you haven't seen Heaven yet you haven't seen that Kingdom yet John say I saw a holy city come down from God out of heaven like a bride adorned for her husband glory to God hallelujah there's a real Jerusalem there's a New Jerusalem to come down from God oh Hal it's better than it ever was it was made by God himself you haven't seen Beauty you haven't seen Treasures oh come on now I reckon this morning that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared oh say ammen [Applause] somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God I know there's somebody in here this morning who come from another place Who Come From Another World you are seeking a city whose build and maker is C we are not from here tell that to the devil let him take back to the bank we are not from here Satan oh sooner or later he's going to find out who you are sooner or later

Hallelujah I feel Faith Rising faith is rising this morning faith is rising this morning I see God Rising let God arise and let his enemies be scattered hallelujah hallelujah I'm not going to tell you

said Hallelujah this morning is a morning to say hallelujah and if you never got the Holy Ghost this morning is the morning that the angel can pass by Pillar of Fire slid through you praise God so ET etal [Applause] life who is the devil this morning who is Satan what are thoughts what are imaginations they only figments in my mind that is not real but what is real in this world what is real is this word that God has spoken because one day it will materialize and it will become flesh that is what is real not your job not your house not these four walls not this Pew this Pew is not real but the holy ghost is real God is real that's atmosphere you feel right now is more real than anything in this room glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah there atmosphere is going across the internet and it's touching people right now I believe it to be so our faith declares the reality say Amen [Applause] somebody oh I feel the Holy Spirit now he is in the camp praise God I'm relying totally on him this morning [Applause] glory to call Brother brandham fought labored lost his wife hallu lost his child went through hard trials 5 years without the anointing what was he doing back in a burden for the Bride of this day because there was a seventh under message to be burst out of him to be spoken out of him there had to be a prophet on the earth to speak it and he was being shaped he was being molded to step into that anointing oh but when it came down when that angel come down from eternity with the word of God stepped into him he was able to speak by direct inspiration and a 700 message went out to call a bride to Perfection to call a bride to adoption to call a bride to her place in Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah it has already been spoken it has already been least the devil tried to fight it all these years the devil tried to keep it from the people and tell them it's not a promise but this morning we know it's a promise laying in the scripture oh laying in the word of God laying in the spoken word hallelujah that those same seven Thunders one day one of these days they're going to utter their voices to a certain group of people who have the caliber who have what it takes to take that word and hand it there [Applause] oh Hallelujah there is a people this morning there is a people this morning just I'm sure as I'm standing on this pulpit and just as sure as you're sitting in those pews there is a people on the Earth this morning who are predestinated to hear from God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that is more real than anything in this room I challenge you to believe it [Applause] Hallelujah hall seven tunders give faith for what to call for the power to be transformed Hallelujah from what you are now into what you will become we are not in our perfect state yet but we will be we're believing unto it and our faith is what has kept us all these years not your thoughts not your ideas not your emotions sometimes you didn't feel like doing it sometimes you didn't feel like coming to church but your faith something inside of you spoke louder than your thoughts it spoke louder than your words could ever speak here on Earth something inside your heart that's what God saw when he spoke you in here in the beginning he saw the faith that was in your soul and he is going to honor that Faith with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy [Applause] Ghost hallu yeah yeah that that world is real we feel it you know when we feel it when our feet begins to reach out amen and touch it touch it begin to grab it and pull it closer the more you begin to praise God the more you begin to worship get into the atmosphere you begin to touch something you begin to hold something with your faith your faith begins to grab a hold of angels and begins to grab a hold of promises your faith could go where you can't go oh so don't worry about your backsliding daughter don't worry about your blacks sliden son if you have faith this morning you could actually touch them you could tap them on their shoulder wherever they are this morning with your fate and say come come your time is almost Clos closer oh Hallelujah pulling them closer with your [Applause] prayers Hallelujah Hall where am I this morning animals don't have souls no trees plants flowers they don't have souls but men have souls amen creating the image and likeness of God there's a being a part of them a representation in them the God has put there amen hallelujah man didn't put it there so there'll always be a thirst there'll always be a question in your mind doesn't matter how far you Ro doesn't matter where you go there'll always be a question in the mind of man H if there's a God if there's a supernatural if there's something more to life than this you go to work and you come back home but there got to be something more you go to church and you come back home but there's got to be something more you go to work and you come back home but there's got to be something more to life than this praise God hallelujah yes yes yes yes oh Hallelujah Hal I know it is hallelujah thanes Paul said a Reon thank you Jesus that the sufferings of this present time and that word reckon is actually I think it's a accounting word I think it means to balance isn't that right so if you'll put it on the scale and take the present conditions the present sufferings of this present time and you put what God has in store for you on the other side Paul is saying it is not even worthy to be compared when you take what you're going through right now and you put it on the same scale with the word of the Living God the one totally outweighs the other what this world has does not have any weight it doesn't hold anything of interest when you drop the things of God on the scale it tips over it's not even worth putting on the scale because what God has in store for you what God has put in his word for you no man could do anything about it nothing in the world can satisfy the desire that God put in your heart to be a Christian to be a son of God that's the greatest gift the seed that is in your soul that is what come from God that is what goes back to God and it doesn't matter what the devil does he cannot stop God's purpose God's purpose is already inside of you and it's bursting it is fighting it is prepping its way out oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah just imagine that and people put so much emphasis on material things they put so much emphasis you go to the bank and driving a little small car and you're feeling a how because some guy's driving a Range Rover and somebody driving Alexus and they feeling bad and they want to sell your car and buy a better car you a mind busing the bank but you're feeling a h because somebody have a better car than you and somebody have a better house than you and to think that all these men in the Bible were sojourners they were strangers they were raggedy hallelujah how they wandered and sheep skins and goat skins they were destitute they were Afflicted they were tormented seeking a city whose Bild and maker was God yet they didn't not obtain the promise God having provided some better thing for us that day without us will never be made perfect we have received this morning a message of perfection what is inside of you has the ability to wake up to dead oh you didn't get that you didn't get that if you got that we'd have to fix the church tomorrow what is inside of you what is moving inside your soul has the ability to wake up to Dead who can stop the voice of God when it speaks praise [Applause] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's the authority that God wants to place in his sons but you must have faith to believe his promised word for your life if if you don't have faith you can't access the promise you can't even begin to believe it oh H but Faith goes without without understanding it goes without seeing it's not about what you could see but it's about What God Says in his word concerning your own life praise God that is what is real not this world not what this world has to offer young people oh how this world has the Fashions they have the Styles they have the music but we've got something that is more real than that it's more Vivid than that it's more Hallelujah tangible than that I'm not talking about what you can see with your eyes but what you see with your [Applause] [Music] heart isn't that right Samson they couch his eyes out he couldn't see nothing he was playing isn't that right yet in that condition Samson saw a possibility he's blind he can't see he can't see his hands in front of him he can't see how terrible he's looking he can't see the negative situation yet in that condition he saw something it wasn't his natural eyes he didn't have any but what he saw went beyond his natural eyes what he saw was deep down in his heart and he believed that there was a possibility they took out his eyes but it couldn't stop a Son of God from seeing something I don't care if you can't see this morning oh you're naturalized that's okay but God oh Hallelujah is bringing a possibility to you this morning that right now in another world your healing is already taken place if you could see that this morning you can have it hallelujah praise God amen amen [Applause] Hall oh say Amen somebody listen that natural world Amen in this natural world we are subject to time isn't that right amen amen but in the Supernatural world there's they are not subject to time amen it is eternity after eternity after eternity in other words God dwells in a dimension by himself the seventh Dimension isn't that right he alone exists up there in that realm that is God and God Alone in other words he is always there he was always there and he will always be there he will always be God and no matter what time you are in no matter what condition you are in no matter where you are this morning God is always is there God is always around he's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you he's not going to disappear he is always there that Supernatural world that we are talking about this morning is always there it's always been there maybe you might not have always felt it maybe you might not always experienced it one day you're up one day you're down but that Supernatural world is always there and anytime you need something from Lord and you a child of God then don't you be afraid to see the thing that is not seen and to contact the thing that is always there there's a father this morning who lives beyond time who lives beyond the Realms of this life if you want anything from God he is always there this morning call upon God this morning oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] amen what a faith amen what an encouragement amen God is always around we we move with feelings and emotions Hallelujah and yet God is always there always in that atmosphere isn't that right he doesn't live in doubt he doesn't live in fear he doesn't live in the atmosphere of confusion no no no it's eternity upon eternity and his word is settle forever whatever he has spoken is settled forever he is I am the I am H he is whatever you need him to be oh Hall when you attach that need to the I am then watch God become whatever you have need of if you need healing I am your healer if you need Deliverance I am your deliverance then that eternity drops down in time and becomes whatever you have need of I am your deliverer I am your provider I am a way maker I am praise God hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh isn't that right hallelujah thank you Lord Glory Glory yes yes hujjah seeing that atmosphere oh something could break in on you hallelujah it's right there it's like a curtain you go through it Faith pushes your hand through the curtain pulls down the promise of God whatever you

he talked about it many times in these visions and things and when he come back down he wasn't sure if it was the natural world or the supernatural World there was a thin line between it one moment he's here and the next moment he's in another place yeah it's just like Beyond a curtain he steps into another Realm and then steps back isn't that right amen hallelujah H sees it and speaks from that Vision realm speaks from that Eternal realm what is about to happen so when he speaks anything it is not coming from a time element but it's coming from an eternal Source that's why we preach a prophet's message that's why we speak the prophet's words because they are not his words they are words that were given to him by God himself called speaking lifted air to his servants Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah one time he was on a platform praying I think for a young girl and she was blind and I think she had a guardian with her and they were on the platform and

he says brother do you see what just happened there he did his hand like this and the young girl's eyes followed his hand going all the way up what happened she began to see but brandham said her guardian her mother whoever was with her was actually standing in a gap for her her faith was standing in the gap for that young girl that was standing on the platform who couldn't see who was all in

Centurion was a soldier isn't that right a soldier in the Army and he's accustom giving orders he's accustom doing his thing he's accustom packing the orders of high Caesar whatever Caesar says that is what he's got to do that's it if he's got to go out and collect taxes then he's got to do it he's empowered by the state to go out there and to carry out the law of the land isn't that right this Roman Centurion was a high ranking officer in the military and in the Army isn't that right amen and in the Army you're trained a certain way you're trained as a soldier H isn't that right to follow orders to do what needs to be done and to get it done the way it's supposed to be done isn't that right that's how the army trains you first three months they spend bashing you in they they strip you down they humiliate you they tell you all kinds of things isn't that right to break down your mentor and what you're accustomed with and what you're accustom doing and how you're accustom getting in in the morning they wake you up at 0500 hours and they make you go for a run and you're running running and you're tired and you're sweaty and you feel like your lung's going to burst and you feel like you're going to die and the soul is moving forward and if he leaves you behind you get lost so you got to keep up with the leader you got to keep up with the pack and that's how God trains his officers you got to keep up with the pack oh Hallelujah this Christian Life is no Cakewalk this Christian life is not a Rose Garden Welcome to the army yes sir no sir line up and follow orders stand up sit down shut up praise God listen to what I've got to say oh it's not an uncertain sound it's a certain sound you hear it and something inside of you responds something inside of you hears when God speaks oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah and God trains his soldiers 50 push-ups 1 2 3 4 what is he doing he's getting you ready for the final battle he's getting you ready for the final showdown he's

stand [Applause] apart hallelujah hallelujah God trains the soldier God trains his when he equips them with the word of God and gives them Faith to go out there oh it takes a strong hand of Faith to cut out the promises of God for the hour you can't have no weak hand and handle the the the sword oh H isn't that right you've got to have a strong hand of Faith that's what the push-ups are for that's what the trials are for that's what the testings are four it might be hot it might be heavy but God is training you because the devil is not taking any prisoners he wants to kill you but not before we kill him first hallelujah hallelujah glory to God that's the attitude don't take no prisoners if he puts one of ours in the hospital put one of his in the mor praise God but we mean business with God and we mean business with the Enemy we're not backing down for anybody and for nothing say Amen somebody [Applause] Hallelujah when David met Goliath but Brandon said he had something that was proven to work it was proven with the bear it was proven with a lion it was a sling and a stone that's why he couldn't handle with no sword and no Shield business that wasn't his Revelation he had a slingshot Revelation and that was God what God revealed to him it might look Meek it might look humble it might look ordinary but David had confidence in the that God had revealed to him because it was proven to work oh and we have the thing this morning that is proven to work seven Thunders that defeated the enemy in every age prior we have the thing this morning that is proven to work oh

Bible said immediately I was in the spirit immediately something come over him immediately something begin to happen to him you can't help when that voice speaks to you something comes over you it's a word atmosphere it's an anointing and that anointing is an expectation that God has put inside of your soul oh hallelujah hallelujah holding on all these years on expectation waiting for something to happen and we always get what we expect if your expectation is little Hallelujah you could only get so much but if your expectation is great Hallelujah and you know that your God is great and that he can do anything anything anything because the things that we see were not made by things which do appear they were not made by things we could see but what we see around us are made by something we cannot see then we know we have confidence in a god that is able to do anything this morning yes yes he can create a spleen he can create a liver he can create blood God could do anything this morning the same God that spoke man into existence is able to do [Applause] anything you've got to believe that you've got to receive that oh Hallelujah it is more real than this [Applause] world praise God let me go back to the Roman Centurion Hallelujah so here's this Roman Centurion he's accustomed going to the grocery and people salute him sir he might be in uniform but they know he's a centurion they know he's a soldier he represents the army he swore his allegiance to Caesar isn't that right if there's a call to war he must respond amen if there's a call to battle he must respond he can't uh give an excuse he doesn't he can't write a written excuse and let his mommy sign it no no no no no he already swore his life to the Army Hallelujah death in life he is in service to H Caesar isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah that's how God soldiers are we are sworn to battle and when the call for war goes out something inside of us has to respond something inside of us has to respond to the word of God when it calls us isn't that right if the lion has R who can but fear and if the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy you cannot deny the voice of almighty God oh Hallelujah Peter said how can we help but speak of the things which we have seen and heard oh Hallelujah it is what is influencing us it is what is driving us it is what is giving us Fai it is what is making us wake up every morning oh Hallelujah with a smile in our face because we know today is the day that I'm overcoming oh how the devil could only get so much Victory but we going to win the war he might get a victory here on a victory there but when the battle is over we shall wear a crown we are promised a crown there has laid up for you Treasures in Heaven when this life is over hallelujah hallelujah oh Hall just like Paul said I've run the race I've finished my course and they laid up Treasures for me in heaven there are Treasures in Heaven that this world could never amount to nothing you have in this present time could ever compare to the treasures to the promises to the valuables that God has in store for you this morning no natural thing could satisfy you it could never satisfy a Son of God not when there's a thirst in your soul not when God put something Eternal inside of you no natural thing could satisfy an eternal thirst oh Hallelujah isn't that right no natural thing I don't care what it is hallelujah nothing could hold you don't let nothing hold you in this temporal carnal life oh is only subject to time but those things that are eternal they will never fade away those things that are Eternal is what will keep you oh not only in this world but the world that come it will keep you praise God it will take you to your destination Hallelujah trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding acknowledge Him in all thy ways and he will direct your paths if you are willing this morning to acknowledge Christ in all your ways he will lead you to the Holy Ghost he will lead you to your promise he will lead you to your deliverance he will lead you to your breakthrough but lean not unto your own understanding don't look to your own mind your mind can't help you now isn't that right when but brandom was being tested isn't that right but Jo spoke about it in the prayer meeting Thursday night said he was overcome devil begin to talk talk to him and tell him look you're a servant of God you preach the word and you stood for him Hallelujah isn't that right and you've done all you can if you accepted him you declared him in your life Hallelujah and still he took your wife from you he took your child from you brother branham's Mentor had already broken down to such a level where whatever everything that Satan was telling him was true everything that Satan was telling was absolutely the truth he couldn't dispute it he couldn't disagree with it there was no argument he could make with it it was 100% the truth look God not speaking to you every time he pray a black curtain dropped down and you can't hear from God and all of that was the truth but something inside of brother Bram awoken oh Hall out of Slumber something inside of his soul oh Hallelujah said the Lord give and the Lord take away blessed be the name of the Lord that wasn't brother Brandon that was something Supernatural it would take something Supernatural to keep you in this hour isn't that right hallelujah what was a prophet Hallelujah he spoke and it happened tumors roll off people neck it happened right there on the pulpit yet he almost failed that test as as it was because his mind was already overcome that's why you can't lean on your own understanding you cannot lean on your mind not in this hour not in this season we are not from here we are from another world oh we are from another place that must be our influence that must be our reality that must be our praise for our world that we live in every day day in day [Music] out hallelujah hallelujah amen hallu Roman Centurion Hallelujah custom taking orders giving orders rather he was a high an high ranking official amen he say to one go and he go say to one come and he come he was accustomed doing his thing but all of a sudden there came a situation in which he had no control isn't that right his servant was sick grievously uhhh ill and there was nothing that he could do about it here was a situation in which he couldn't give orders here was a situation in which he had no control here was a situation in which he couldn't do anything about it he couldn't dictate the situation I'm sure he went to the doctors I'm sure you went to the Physicians and there was nothing that they could do to help this man there was nothing they could do to help this servant the doctors say we have no control we don't know what to do we don't have the Cure we don't have the antidote but the Roman Centurion understood one simple thing he knew that there had to be somebody who is in control of the situation there had to be a man in Authority there had to be a man in control a man who could do something about the matter and when he heard about this Jesus of Nazareth he pick up his helmet he pick up his shield and he said I got to go talk to this man because this man spoke and it happened this man speaks and it is created this man speaks and the blind see the deaf hear the crippled walk this man is in control of something that I am no longer in control of hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah what a humbling thing he accustom being in charge but now he has to Humble himself again to an authority above and he understands the concept and he knows that there's a man in here who could turn on the light so he goes to Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right Jesus is accompanied with a crowd everybody's around him you know he's popular and so on and here comes a Roman Centurion approaching Jesus and I just love this part because here is a Roman Centurion and I don't know maybe he was dressed in his armor and so forth maybe he had his his helmet under his arm and his shield at his side he had his sword in his sheath and he had his knife in his side pocket he's dressed in his Battalion gar he has his praise God all of his headdress and his chest plate praise God he looks Mighty he looks powerful he has his red cape flowing behind him he's a Roman Centurion oh Hallelujah and in society society would say that he is powerful but let's look at Jesus Jesus is Meek Jesus is mild Jesus is lonely the son of man with no place to rest his head oh Hallelujah humble shoes upon his feet The Humble Master Son of God with a scraggly beard walking and teaching and preaching the ways of the Lord God hallelujah isn't that right in the natural he looked normal in the natural Jesus looked like the one with no power in the natural it looked like the Centurion was the one with all the power but if you could see into the supernatural realm the Centurion doesn't have any power it is Jesus is the one with all the power he has the ability to say the one go and he go he can say the one come and he come praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are you seeing the picture this morning here's a Roman Centurion he's broken he's humble look at the approach he said my servant at home is sick oh hallelujah hallelujah and Jesus responded and said I will come and heal him and the Roman Centurion said no I am not worthy that you could come under my roof oh what a statement I'm sure the Centurion had a nice home I'm sure he had a nice paycheck he had a servant for crying out loud not many people have servants but he had a good paycheck he could have entertained Jesus well but that wasn't the issue the power that was Upon Jesus the glory that was Upon Jesus was so much that the Roman Centurion said no no no I'm not worthy for you to come in my house I am not worthy for you to come in my roof because I recognize that you are a man under Authority you say the one go and he go you say to one come and he come you say to one do and he doeth it you just speak the word and I know my servant shall be [Applause] healed oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah time was against the situation his servant needed something now and he didn't come on his own accord he came on his servants behalf such a love that Jesus said I've never seen fate like this in all of Israel and Jesus made a statement he said said people of the Kingdom will be cast into outer darkness and he said people children who may not be even part of that uh not of the Kingdom children not of the Kingdom will actually sit at the feet of men Hallelujah and great prophets and sages what does that mean it means that people come to church for years but they never exercise their faith people come to church for years but they never do what God Said to do they never act on their promises they sitting on goal they sitting on Treasure and you don't even know it you are sitting on your own healing and you don't even know it you are sitting on your own deliverance and you don't even know it people coming to church for years oh but Jesus said there are people who are not even here there are people you can't see right now but they're going to be sitting with Jacob and Isaac and Joseph and Abraham oh and feasting at the table and surrounded by the glory of God when you go to heaven you're not going to see strong looking people no it's going to be a bunch of weak people a bunch of people you didn't think could make it a bunch of people you think couldn't overcome they will be sitting at the table and he will wipe every tear from their eye because they know that they didn't make it in themselves but it was a God that was greater than them [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] are you hearing me this morning Hallelujah so Faith brings expectation and expectation is an atmosphere that's created by the Holy Spirit isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right and anytime we talk about atmosphere and expectation we can't help but talk about Simeon Simeon and all praise God priests in the house isn't that right knows the word knows the scripture knows just as much as they know Hallelujah isn't that right he's old and gray-headed Hallelujah H he's nearing the ending chapters of his life and then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit speaks to him and says Simeon you are not going to see death until you see the Lord's Christ and here is Simeon hearing a word from the Lord all the other priests and sages never heard what he heard they didn't experience what he experience they didn't hear what he heard they didn't see what he saw he alone saw something and when every body was just coming to church Simeon was under a promise when everybody was just coming and sitting in the Pew he was under a promise when everybody was just coming to pay tithes he was under a promise he was under expectation he was looking for the Lord Christ every day Hallelujah every dedication day he was looking for it he makes sure and find himself in church because that's where the promise was amen oh say Amen somebody amen he couldn't be home waiting for the promise he couldn't be on the street hanging out somewhere waiting for the promise he find himself in the temple every day looking God didn't tell him when but he's staggered not through unbelief oh with faith holding on believing believing oh Hallelujah that something is about to happen that today could be his day that this service could be his service and he's holding on he's praying he's waiting oh isn't that right he goes to the doctor the doctor tell him you have two months to live he ignores what the doctor says because he knows what God has spoken to him and when God speaks to you doesn't matter what the devil says doesn't matter what the doctors say science can say what they want once God has spoken it it's got to come to [Applause] pass hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah here Simeon all of a sudden Holy Spirit speak to him rise up this is the day this is the hour Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the Son of God is in the temple go out to meet him praise God Amen and here comes Simon he's old this is his season now this is his time if he ever walked before he knew that this was his moment he begin to walk a little faster his steps become brighter oh how this old man is going to see the Christ this old man is going to see his promise and when your promise begins to become more real to you becomes more positive to you you something begins to happen to you inside your spirit a Revival begin to take place a quickening begins to take place oh Hallelujah Hal you're no longer oh Hallelujah influenced by the natural but something Supernatural is over you oh Hal and it won't let you go it won't let you go until the promise is revealed and made visible in your [Music] [Applause] life Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah let thy servant depart in peace for my eyes have seen the glory of the Lord amen amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen do you love him this morning Faith that's why it's important to create an atmosphere that's what we come to church to do to create an atmosphere and even when you leave here the devil's mission the devil's job and sole purpose is to get you out of that atmosphere he bring trials he bring things your way circumstances you bring situations the devil bombarding your mind bombarding your spirit young people trying to tell you you can't make it trying to tell you that you can't overcome but if you look beyond that to the voice that is calling you higher there's a voice in the word of God that is calling you to another place where you belong isn't that right you do not not belong here hallelujah we are not from here hallelujah Hollywood thinks they know what aliens is but you are alien sitting right here in this temple in this Tabernacle this morning you are not from this natural world they think they know about UFOs but they haven't seen nothing yet you wait till power strikes your soul wait till power comes into you brother this Earth will begin to shake the devil hasn't seen power yet you wait till it strikes The Pride you wait till it strikes home there's something begin to take place everything that can be shaken will be shaken Hall isn't that right oh hallelujah praise God can you take a little more amen amen I'm just about getting ready to close up now in any case so praise God hallelujah praise God Amen where am I all right in the right atmosphere Miracles could take place in the right atmosphere your healing could break up isn't that right an egg could hatch under a dog under a mammal under a common animal because the atmosphere created is right for it to happen praise God isn't that right in the upper room they all praying and worshiping getting in the spirit they were praising continually they were praising unceasingly Hallelujah isn't that right God had already Jesus had already broken the scripture to them their understanding is now open they beginning to see something in the scripture and in the word that they had never seen before and all of a sudden they begin to see something that there's a possibility that this Same Spirit that was upon Christ will one day come upon them that be become a reality to them that was a Vindication to them when Jesus left them they weren't sad no more they weren't depressed no more they weren't ated no more the Bible said they went back to Jerusalem continually praising continually worshiping with exceeding and great joy waiting for the promise to be made known upon them because they knew praise God that something was about to happen Hallelujah when your understanding is open to what this word is and to what these scriptures are and to who you are unto what you are called to do you can't help but come to church in the right Atmos osphere you come to create an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost you come to take charge of your atmosphere oh Hallelujah Hal you can come to declare whatever reality it is that you want to live in Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the devil brings symptoms the devil brings sickness I said you're feeling this way and you're feeling this way Hallelujah and this is happening and that is happening but if you could look to the Unseen this morning you'll see something oh how the devil can't see that the devil could never take away a faith inside your soul declaring what is real from what is not as though it were oh Hallelujah I challenge you to believe it this morning to rise up in faith and declare what is real this morning our God is able to deliver all God is able to restore all God is able to heal Hallelujah Hallelujah isn't that right Caleb walked different Caleb talk different Caleb said of the Lord be with me then I shall be able to drive out the enemy as the Lord had said how could Caleb talk like that how could Caleb speak like that but BR said he had another spirit that was with him he wasn't walking around in a natural he wasn't walking around in a humanistic but there was another spirit that was with him that was influencing him that was driving him to do the things that he was doing to fight the way he fights to believe the way he believe and no other Spirit no other life can work in this Pride than the life that is in Jesus Christ and when that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in your mortal body you can't help but heal a sick you can't help but claim your inheritance you can't help but add the Life of Christ [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's something else in control of the situation you have to catch the mind of Christ for every situation that you encounter that's when you start asking the question why does it happen that's when you start to dig a Little Deeper people look at things and say look what happened this happened there and that happened there but when you begin to dig a little deeper and just ask yourself the question why did it happen what took place what went wrong what happened here praise God amen amen then begin to dig a little deeper then you begin to realize that there's something else that is in control there's only two forces the power of God and the power of Satan Hallelujah that's right only two forces that is in control of this world hallelujah hallelujah and you are being influenced this morning by one of those two forces one force wants to drag you to hell and the other Force wants to pull you up to heaven you are in between struggling in your human Spirit but I challenge you this morning to believe in a god that is able to pull you up this morning hallelujah hallelujah I challenge you this morning to go wake Jesus I challenge you this morning to believe in something that you cannot even see but yet you know in your heart that it is real praise God hallelujah hallelujah the disciples in the boat the wind is being tossed about the wind is contrary the wind is blowing left it's blowing right and they are so confused and Jesus is tired in the boat he is sleeping isn't that right the disciples are looking at the wind they are looking at the waves they are looking at the lightning they looking at the stor they are looking at the things that they can see and they are frightened they are terrified but all of a sudden one of them says let's go and wake the master let us go and wake Jesus because he is the only one who could see about this problem he is the only one that can see about this situation he is the only one that can take control of this problem and I don't care what wind is blowing contrary in your life this morning there is a man under Authority in this building this morning he's standing right next to you he's standing right in front of you if you have faith this morning you could reach out un touch the Lord this morning the man that is under Authority he could say to one go and he go he could say the one come and he come am isn't that right they went and woke him and soon as he woke up he rubbed his eyes and he looked at the storm and he turned to the disciples and he says a simple words he says oh ye of little faith when he looked at the wind and the storm he said peace be still and what seemed like was out of control what seemed like was blowing out of confusion what seemed like a disaster roll away like a baby and went back to sleep talk about a God that can take control this morning he is in control I challenge you to believe it he is in control right now I don't care what the situation is I don't care what the circumstance is he is in control right now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right God brother BR never went in his own might he never went in his own power he never went in his own ability he always declared Jesus Christ he said you know who I'm waiting on I'm waiting on no angel I'm waiting on the Holy Spirit I'm waiting on the captain of The Host I'm waiting of the thing that you cannot see you can't see him but I'm that's who I'm waiting on because nothing can move until he say so I went that drop into the building Brother P Rock back I said take every Spirit under my control for the glory and the honor of God who is speaking that's the angel of the Lord oh now he could take control now he can take authority over every sickness over every disease is now under his feet and when the sons of God come back into Authority everything will be under our feet every sickness every disease everything that the enemy tried to throw in your direction it is already on our feet this morning oh for we are more than conquerors through him that loved us praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh come on now I'm getting ready to close God didn't raise up no jellyfish in this hour God looking for strong men of Faith to cut out the promises of God hallelujah to cut out a word for the hour Hallelujah and pull down the promise of God for the hour oh the need is great and the hour is very very late oh Hallelujah s is this the time for the bride of Christ to begin to raise up and to claim the promises for her hour oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen amen thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus is this the hour amen is this the time say Amen never was there a time like this time that's right Book of Daniel talks about this time amen a great and Dreadful time such as never was since there was a nation Hallelujah since there was a people even to that same time there's never been so much War so much blood lust so much murder so much confusion so much contamination brother pram says a future home that the whole skies are contaminated with Devils everywhere you go Devils everywhere you go in the houses in the homes in the schools in the neighborhoods demons all over the place praise God hallelujah it'll take a fate like we've never known before to press through praise God this negative atmosphere and to interact with the things that we cannot see oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's enough in this world to make question there's enough to make in this world to make you doubt there's enough in this world to make you shake but Jesus prayed for Peter he said I prayed for you he said what did I pray for that your faith fail not and though Peter stumble though Peter fall Peter's faith never fail because when Jesus said cast your net to the right side all of a sudden something inside a Peter begin to awaken and he couldn't help but do what Jesus said to do because there was a faith inside his soul hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh faith for the Holy Ghost faith for the Rapture faith for your daughter faith for your son faith for your situation faith for your trial faith for your testing yes yes yes yes it takes Faith to reach up and grab a hold of that angel oh hallelujah hallelujah said I not let you go until you bless me I'll not let you go until I get what I come for until I get what I expect and if you in that atmosphere this morning I challenge you to believe that right now something can begin to happen something can begin to take place in your life in your walk in your talk in your atmosphere isn't that right the prophet said one one it just takes one person one is a majority in God Amen and there's a saying that goes like this if one man could do it another man could do it Hallelujah isn't that right one person could cause a chain reaction in the Supernatural one person could change the course of events Hallelujah in the Supernatural that woman oh had the blood isue she told herself something she didn't have a promise she didn't have a Bible she didn't have a priest she didn't have a teacher she just told herself if I could just Touch the Hem of His comments I know that I could be made hole and Jesus is on his way to go heal somebody and there's a crowd all around but that woman changed the program that morning that woman change the course of events praise God H it just takes one person this morning to do something this morning to cause a ripple in the Supernatural it just takes one person to grab a hole of that angel this morning oh you could be that one person yes yes you could be that one brother you could be that one sister I challenge you to believe it don't you leave here the same way you come you could be that one person this morning that makes the difference between life and death Hallelujah she pressed through the crowd she pressed through the crowd she said I've got to be healed I've got to be delivered I've got to be touched I don't know how much time left the doctor gave her so much days to live but she was taking her own faith and taking control control of her own situation she was declaring her own reality she knew if she could just Touch the Hem of His Garment she could be made whole and her faith begin to declare it and the more her faith declare it is the more Hallelujah she get closer to her promise she get closer to her goal she get closer to her objective she get closer to her reality until all of a sudden she touched the Hem of His com what happened Jesus stopped where he was going all of a sudden Jesus is walking Jesus is not aware of what is going on Jesus is not aware of the woman's condition he doesn't know her situation he doesn't know what's going through he doesn't know her story but something she did caused him to stop where he was going something she believed something she told herself it started off as just words what are you telling yourself this morning maybe it's just words oh but I challenge you to believe oh Hallelujah in a reality ity this morning and something that is more real than you something that's more real than me something that's more real than this world oh Hallelujah the unfailing promise of [Applause] God oh Hallelujah I'm getting ready to close m m she could come amen hallelujah she touched him he stopped he felt something am he turned around and told the disciples he said somebody touch me disciples say everybody's touching you Lord everybody's interacting with you everybody's trying to know you everybody's trying to be seen with you everybody's trying to be heard from you and everybody's trying to get your attention he said but no no no no no no somebody came through a different avenue somebody came not through the natural way but somebody come through a spiritual Avenue somebody come down a spiritual Road somebody is in a spiritual atmosphere somebody's in a spiritual realm somebody was able to do something in the Supernatural and it's affecting me I felt virtue left me I felt something just took place that what took place was more important than where he had to go at that moment what just took place just interrupted everything what just took place changed the course of events Jesus turned around I said who touched me isn't that right you going to play something the woman owned up she he said it's me Lord hallelujah isn't that right praise God isn't that right he said your faith had made you whole hallelujah hallelujah she touched the H of His Garment and something came out of virtue left him strength left him and went to her need and went to her situation and went to her circumstance praise God hallelujah and took control of that situation Faith expect ation transformation Hallelujah when that Supernatural atmosphere comes around you something takes place one of the devil's greatest lies to tell you that you can't change that you can't be what God wants you to be isn't that right that you can't overcome that you can't live the kind of life that you really want to live that you can't receive the Holy Ghost maybe you've gone too far maybe it's too late for you that's a lie from the pit of Hell because every day is an opportunity for change hallah the word of God comes to call you out of your natural not for you to stay where you are but for you to come out of that into another place that God has for you into another world that God has for you into another realm that where God wants to manifest EST his power to you his glory to you his omnipotence to you his his his purpose and program and life that he has
