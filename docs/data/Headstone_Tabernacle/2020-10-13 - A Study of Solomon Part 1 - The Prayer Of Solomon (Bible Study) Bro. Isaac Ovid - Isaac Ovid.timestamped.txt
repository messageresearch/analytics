[6:32] jerusalem
[6:36] oh blessed be the name of the lord god
[6:39] bless you
[6:40] once again and um
[6:43] it was my lot to share some of you
[6:46] tonight
[6:47] uh i but isaac was ready and it so
[6:50] happened that
[6:50] they had an unusual blackout so uh
[6:53] it's not normal but god knows best
[6:56] so at this time we just want to borrow
[6:58] us with a prayer
[7:01] heavenly father we thank you for your
[7:02] presence and we thank you for this time
[7:04] that you could
[7:05] guide us together and lord i pray to

[7:10] by your truth and father may
[7:12] the people get strength tonight be
[7:14] encouraged tonight in this
[7:16] special time that you're taking us
[7:18] through granted lord in jesus might ask
[7:20] it
[7:21] email an email if your bibles i'd like
[7:23] you to turn
[7:24] to second timothy
[7:28] chapter four reading from verse seven to
[7:31] eight
[7:33] it's very interesting because he called
[7:35] me around
[7:37] 20 minutes to eat to tell me that
[7:40] there's a black hole there so he can't
[7:43] uh connect
[7:44] tonight so that is why it is what it is
[7:47] tonight
[7:47] but god is good and we are still looking
[7:50] to see how god will bless us by his
[7:51] spirit tonight amen
[7:53] so second timothy chapter 4 verse 7 8
[7:55] says i afford a good fight
[7:58] and this is paul when he has talked
[8:00] about his departure i have finished my
[8:02] course
[8:03] i have kept defeat henceforth there is
[8:06] leader for me
[8:07] a clung of righteousness which the lord
[8:10] the righteous judge shall give me at
[8:11] that day
[8:13] not to me only but unto all them
[8:17] also that love is appearing
[8:21] may god bless his word and tonight
[8:24] i want to share something to you about
[8:26] keeping the feet
[8:28] about keeping the faith and i
[8:31] don't know if everybody is nearby you
[8:33] but paul in second timothy
[8:35] in um in acts 20
[8:38] 27 27-30 he says for i have not shown to
[8:41] declare unto you
[8:43] all the counsel of god take heed
[8:45] therefore unto yourselves
[8:47] and all the flock over which the holy
[8:49] ghost had made you overseers
[8:51] to feed the church of god which he had
[8:54] purchased with his own blood
[8:55] for i know this that after my departing
[8:59] shall grievous wolves enter in among you
[9:02] not sparing the flock also
[9:05] of your own self shall men arise
[9:08] speaking perverse things
[9:10] to draw away disciples after them
[9:14] so we see here that paul
[9:17] who was the angel to the church of
[9:19] ephesus
[9:20] who was the pastor the apostle the
[9:22] prophet that age
[9:24] he was warning them of what was to
[9:26] happen
[9:27] after he left because we're dealing with
[9:30] uh the humanistic realm and we're
[9:33] dealing with
[9:35] uh the spiritual name and in that realm
[9:38] and like you talk about like say
[9:40] supernatural
[9:42] people like to talk about supernatural
[9:43] but remember
[9:45] supernatural is two sides i was sharing
[9:48] some ministers overseas
[9:50] last night that when people want a
[9:53] shortcut
[9:54] the enemy could give them supernatural
[9:57] experiences
[9:58] that is satanic that is of the enticing
[10:00] spirits that is impersonation of
[10:02] christianity
[10:03] so you don't want the counterfeit you
[10:05] don't want something that is just
[10:07] supernatural you want something that is
[10:09] off of the word and that is why we have
[10:11] the word here because faith come by
[10:13] hearing
[10:14] and hearing the word and as long as you
[10:17] stay faithful to the word
[10:19] god going to bless you god going to keep
[10:22] you
[10:23] god going to make a way for you if you
[10:25] stay with his word
[10:27] now remember when the prophecy was
[10:31] hanging over israel
[10:32] the children of israel in egypt they
[10:34] only know god by prophecy
[10:37] that god said this a deliverer will come
[10:40] generation after generation
[10:41] is given prophecy of this deliverer to
[10:44] come
[10:45] they don't know when they don't know
[10:46] what time all they know
[10:48] he is coming at the god of abraham he
[10:50] said he's going to
[10:51] search in a strange land and he will
[10:53] send a messenger this is the word
[10:55] they were holding on to this was their
[10:57] comfort and in times of distress
[11:00] in time of pressure like what we're
[11:02] going to know in in
[11:03] all our different ways there is always a
[11:06] word to bring comfort
[11:08] a word from the lord god always have a
[11:11] way
[11:11] of bringing a consolation that he's deal
[11:13] with you
[11:14] amidst your trials i missed your
[11:16] situation and this is where
[11:18] you have to hold fast to the word like
[11:21] all the prophet says when you can't hear
[11:22] from god
[11:23] devil must be able to move you you could
[11:25] stay whole
[11:26] steadfast so it is very powerful
[11:30] how paul said i have fought a good fight
[11:34] i have finished my course he kept defeat
[11:38] that is a person who have a great sense
[11:41] of fulfillment
[11:42] sense of destiny sense of accomplishment
[11:45] but two parts i want to get here to you
[11:48] is fought a good fight
[11:52] and there are some people give up easily
[11:55] they do they want things to work out
[11:58] uh you know smoothly there must be no
[12:01] fight
[12:02] to be god it have to work out this way
[12:04] that way that is not so
[12:06] that is not true sometimes you really
[12:09] have to fight and most times you have to
[12:11] fight because fight
[12:12] is what gives and show the kind of faith
[12:15] inside of you know last week
[12:17] when isaac spoke about gideon and he
[12:19] showed
[12:20] quite clearly how gideon moved from
[12:24] a shy and bashful person to the mighty
[12:27] man of valor
[12:29] and it was interesting to note that the
[12:31] beginning of his encounter
[12:33] by hitting the lamp and saying he saw
[12:35] the lord i'm gideon
[12:36] that wasn't him doing anything that was
[12:39] just following god instructions
[12:41] and got on in his word and given victory
[12:43] over the enemy
[12:44] at the end in the year when gideon began
[12:46] to possess and take and conquer
[12:48] and so on you see the mighty man of
[12:51] allah
[12:51] coming into his own well
[12:54] where you are now it may not be
[12:58] where god ordained you to be in terms of
[13:00] your spirit in terms of what you have to
[13:02] possess
[13:02] and to what you have to take but god
[13:04] have processes and experiences to take
[13:06] you there
[13:08] so you don't have to be worried and say
[13:10] i am shy
[13:11] i can't make it or oh i can't do this i
[13:14] can't do that no
[13:15] what your heart should be i want to
[13:17] follow god's way
[13:19] because he's the same yesterday and
[13:21] forever and i know
[13:23] we live in a modern time it doesn't look
[13:25] sometimes as if god is operational
[13:28] in our own environment but he is he is
[13:31] in the affairs of men and i want to
[13:33] encourage you tonight to fight
[13:35] this good fight and this fight now is a
[13:37] fight of feat
[13:38] not fighting with your neighbor or your
[13:40] brother is a fight of faith there's
[13:42] faith to live because the christian
[13:43] armor
[13:43] is not flesh and blood the christian
[13:45] armor is an hour of faith
[13:47] isn't that right so paul warned them
[13:51] of wolves enter in lies outside but he
[13:54] warned them
[13:55] of words on the inside speaking perverse
[13:57] things and the objective
[13:59] is to draw disciples after themselves
[14:02] so he warned us that things will come to
[14:06] affect this
[14:07] feat jude and the scripture we're
[14:10] familiar with jude tree
[14:11] he said beloved when i give all
[14:13] divisions i write unto you
[14:15] of the common salvation it was needful
[14:17] for me to write unto you
[14:19] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[14:22] contend
[14:23] for the faith which was once delivered
[14:25] unto the saints
[14:26] for there are certain men cryptin
[14:28] unawares
[14:29] who of all ordained to this condemnation
[14:33] on godly men turning the grace of god
[14:35] into lazifacious
[14:37] and denying the only lord jesus christ i
[14:39] will therefore put you in remembrance
[14:41] though you once knew this how that the
[14:44] lord
[14:44] having saved the people out of the land
[14:47] of egypt
[14:48] afterward destroyed them i believe not
[14:51] and the angels which kept not their
[14:53] first estate
[14:54] but left their own habitation yet
[14:57] reserve an everlasting change on the
[14:59] darkness
[15:00] and the judgment of the great deed now
[15:02] you notice
[15:04] what jude said here in terms of putting
[15:06] them in remembrance the same god that
[15:08] saved them judged them
[15:10] and as you may know most of you i
[15:14] keep saying over and over this this
[15:15] message
[15:17] don't know the judgments of god they
[15:19] have never
[15:20] encountered god's judgment it's almost
[15:22] as if god leave everything
[15:23] to run let everything's unfold at time
[15:26] unfold and i don't know when it's going
[15:29] to begin
[15:30] but some point in time it will begin and
[15:33] judgment begins in the house of god
[15:36] and sometime we were reading for about
[15:38] ezekiel 9
[15:39] and notice what god said after the angel
[15:41] came back and said it is done
[15:43] he said begin at my sanctuary. so before
[15:46] drama starts on the outside
[15:49] it have to have drama on the inside we
[15:51] claim to believe god receive his word
[15:53] receive
[15:54] his message make sure there is a sincere
[15:57] heart and an honest heart and a
[15:59] an a and a heart to watch squad because
[16:01] make sure that that all the references
[16:03] of the examples
[16:05] in times past that we don't fall trap to
[16:07] them because the same people that
[16:08] rejoice and shout
[16:10] when the heart wants to go through their
[16:12] wilderness
[16:13] and their dry times and their hard times
[16:17] these same people fell
[16:21] let me say it again
[16:24] the same people that got brought out of
[16:26] bondage deliver me deliver me deliver me
[16:29] you want deliverance
[16:30] okay go send a message question a
[16:32] prophet he said a word
[16:33] he pulls you out now and pulling you out
[16:37] it takes you to a journey the journey
[16:41] is what defines what is in people
[16:44] right now the world is going through a
[16:46] journey there's not a bright trial
[16:49] this is a trial hitting the entire world
[16:51] at judgment on the entire world right
[16:53] now
[16:54] and the fate that we claim to have or
[16:56] claim to believe
[16:58] is what we are challenged with to go to
[17:00] this particular period
[17:02] through the wilderness what they do they
[17:04] murmured they complain
[17:06] they carry on god tolerated all of that
[17:08] you know until
[17:10] it came to kamish baniya until it came
[17:13] to the
[17:14] point where you're almost there it's
[17:17] just over the hill
[17:18] you're almost there yes you're getting
[17:22] hit here you're getting stressed here
[17:24] you're getting fed up and frustrated and
[17:26] all kind of things attack him
[17:28] but you still have a word of promise god
[17:30] said certain things that he has to keep
[17:32] and that is what you're resting on are
[17:33] you fighting for that
[17:35] are you present for that you know i
[17:37] heard preachers preaching and they're
[17:38] preaching
[17:39] this happened already and that passed
[17:41] already and like everything happened
[17:42] already
[17:43] revival how am i ready this happened
[17:45] already that happened already and they
[17:46] waited for the comment of the lord
[17:48] that is a sad place to be in very very
[17:51] sad
[17:52] because if charity is our rest listen
[17:55] carefully
[17:56] if charity is our rest then we are
[17:59] reached there yet
[18:00] we have more to press i want to say it
[18:03] again if
[18:04] charity is duress then the labor
[18:07] has to be between fate and brotherly
[18:10] kindness
[18:11] you're fighting for every inch add to
[18:14] your faith virtue
[18:15] and knowledge and temperance and
[18:17] patience and verdict and so on you're
[18:19] adding you're pressing you're fighting
[18:21] each one is a battle
[18:22] each one is the fight he said it this
[18:24] way looter fought
[18:26] wesley your pentecostal fort
[18:29] what about you and i are we gonna just
[18:31] have a beautiful message with books on
[18:33] tapes and sit down
[18:34] waiting for the comment of the lord as
[18:36] if nothing happened is it working so
[18:37] brethren
[18:38] it's a war it's already started
[18:42] and right now we're going through like
[18:44] sample material
[18:46] sample experiences of what it would be
[18:48] like
[18:49] when the press come down let me say that
[18:51] again we're going to
[18:53] sample experiences of what it would be
[18:56] like
[18:56] when the press com come down the prophet
[18:58] said they will close down the churches
[19:01] and the churches will be used to store
[19:03] whatever
[19:04] extra houses they will do it
[19:08] when i read these things in the early
[19:10] years
[19:11] it was almost like an impossibility all
[19:13] 1975
[19:15] 76 and so on praise the lord
[19:19] but praise god
[19:25] oh blessed being the lord but i'm
[19:27] telling you friends
[19:28] um that that that god is good
[19:31] and he and his most enjoyed forever
[19:34] praise the name of the lord let me see
[19:37] could you hold one second please blessed
[19:38] be the name of the lord
[19:41] thank you lord jesus
[19:55] this here
[20:04] okay
[20:09] okay praise the lord but isaac you on
[20:17] blessed be the name of the lord all
[20:20] right
[20:24] god is good if you want to come and let
[20:27] me know praise the lord
[20:28] okay so let me read this from first
[20:30] corinthians
[20:31] chapter 13 verse 5 second corinthians
[20:33] chapter 13 verse 5
[20:35] examine yourselves whether you be in the
[20:39] fate
[20:40] prove your own selves know you not your
[20:44] own selves how that jesus christ is in
[20:46] you
[20:47] except you be reprobate
[20:50] except you be reprobates this in the
[20:52] amplified reads this way
[20:54] examine and test and evaluate your own
[20:58] cells
[20:59] to see whether you are holding to your
[21:02] feet
[21:03] and showing the proper fruits of it test
[21:07] and prove yourself do you not
[21:10] yourselves realize and no thoroughly by
[21:13] an ever
[21:14] increasing experience that jesus christ
[21:16] is in you
[21:17] unless you are counterfeits disapproved
[21:20] on trial and rejected jesus is a
[21:23] powerful scripture
[21:24] to examine and test to seize your feet
[21:28] not see if you believe by the brown
[21:31] not not that not see if they believe the
[21:34] message
[21:35] not that see if you'll be in the fate
[21:40] because this fate we're talking about
[21:43] i'm calling about defeat this defeat
[21:46] jesus himself introduced it this thing
[21:49] called
[21:49] defeat and gaussian a prophet
[21:53] to tone our hearts back to same this
[21:56] fate of the fathers
[21:57] not uh we have the seals and we have the
[22:01] thunders
[22:02] and we have the mysteries and this is
[22:05] our thing
[22:06] now no this what we have
[22:09] now is to get us to a place that he will
[22:12] be to his hand
[22:13] because that what they had was original
[22:16] this what they had was to take them to
[22:19] the rapture but the raptor was not yet
[22:22] so that seed that was formed on
[22:24] pentecost
[22:26] had to fall down into the ground so now
[22:29] god has to do a work to bring back that
[22:31] original seed
[22:32] by four stages by luther wesley
[22:35] pentecost and by the prophet bringing
[22:38] the full word
[22:39] and when the prophet body full word it
[22:41] was back now to the original seed
[22:43] sonoma besoa now after son of man
[22:47] in the old testament in the bible came
[22:50] son of god which was spirit
[22:51] activated in peter and paul and all
[22:55] disciples
[22:56] so after son of man come again this time
[22:58] we have to see
[23:00] a manifestation of sons of god which is
[23:02] the holy spirit
[23:03] christ himself veiled in the sons of god
[23:07] this is what we are contending for we're
[23:10] not contending to be a nice
[23:11] message church we are contending for the
[23:14] faith
[23:15] that was once delivered and there is
[23:17] going to be
[23:18] a unity of that faith are you with me
[23:22] there is going to be not a unity of
[23:24] doctrine
[23:25] or unity of teachings it going to be a
[23:27] unity of the fate
[23:29] because the doctrines and teachings the
[23:31] equal signs supposedly christ
[23:34] whatever we preach whatever we teach if
[23:36] it cannot
[23:37] reproduce the original grain which is
[23:40] jesus christ it is some other gospel
[23:42] because all what is to be reproduced
[23:46] has to produce christ himself
[23:49] amen who praise the lord so i trust this
[23:52] help you tonight
[23:53] and you realize that this god that we
[23:56] serve is alive
[23:58] the message but isaac shared with us
[24:00] concerning jehu
[24:02] and the study about jehu and about god's
[24:05] judgment it was a very important message
[24:07] very interesting
[24:09] a bible study and it goes to show that
[24:13] when god says something he's done
[24:14] playing he's at playing games
[24:16] he means what he says and he says what
[24:20] he means and i'm hoping
[24:21] that tonight and through all the bible
[24:24] studies and what we are sharing it
[24:27] brings
[24:28] a fear of god and that is the beginning
[24:31] of wisdom
[24:32] and give an understanding of how much
[24:35] he keeps his word and how much he's in
[24:38] your fears of men
[24:40] you know it's this very stirring story
[24:43] about neighborhood
[24:43] and about i mean i said it before about
[24:45] about how you know
[24:47] he had this feel and ahab wanted his
[24:49] feel and he blank him and said no this
[24:51] is my family property and a man got
[24:52] upset
[24:53] and you know what happened he died and
[24:54] god said you see that no that's not
[24:56] going
[24:57] unpunished that's not going unpunished
[25:00] what is a strong name though is when you
[25:01] have went and sucked on ashes go to your
[25:03] sea
[25:03] or humble himself i go i gotta shift the
[25:06] judgment to a next level so god
[25:10] responds to repentance god responses i'm
[25:14] sorry
[25:15] forgive me i i i didn't mean to act that
[25:19] way i shouldn't have acted that way
[25:21] god responds to that it's his law
[25:25] it's his order it's not a matter we
[25:27] could just do our own thing
[25:29] the people were happy to come out
[25:31] they're happy to come from under pharaoh
[25:32] but they were judged and killed and
[25:34] separated from god
[25:36] it's not as if it's it's it's like we
[25:39] could continue
[25:40] doing our own thing and acting our own
[25:42] way so
[25:43] i'll say this way to you not because you
[25:46] are blessed
[25:48] in what you're doing god is agreeing
[25:51] with what you're doing
[25:55] oh praise the lord
[25:58] yeah so so so what so if you are blessed
[26:01] if you are blessed
[26:02] um and you feel a blessing and you're
[26:04] doing foolishness and you're breaking
[26:05] your word but you're still best
[26:07] be careful let's go as a warning tonight
[26:11] because samson
[26:12] when he didn't tell his secret he was
[26:14] lying he was making fun
[26:16] and everything else but the anointing
[26:18] was still there the power was still
[26:19] there
[26:20] you see so don't take your blessing as a
[26:24] tick to do whatever you want and
[26:27] continue being blessed there came a time
[26:29] when samson looked for power and he was
[26:31] totally upset
[26:32] it was not here because he broke the
[26:34] covenant
[26:35] god is a covenant keeping god
[26:39] so let's continue who praise the god
[26:41] from romans chapter four
[26:43] one four we want to read a scripture
[26:44] from the if you have a bible they
[26:45] content in romans chapter four
[26:47] and let's read it here romans chapter
[26:49] four we read from verse one
[26:51] what shall we then say that abraham or
[26:53] father speculated the flesh had found
[26:55] and if abraham was justified by works
[26:57] yahweh of the glory
[26:58] but not before god but what saith the
[27:01] scripture
[27:02] abraham believed god and it was counted
[27:05] unto him for righteousness
[27:07] now to him that worketh is a reward not
[27:09] reckon of grace
[27:11] but of death but to him that look at not
[27:14] but believe it on him that justified him
[27:16] god be
[27:17] his fate is counted for righteousness
[27:21] so imagine your faith in god
[27:24] could be conquered for righteousness at
[27:26] this time i think i want to invite but
[27:28] isaac is on the phone and uh i believe
[27:31] he could share something and
[27:33] speak to us if you want to continue but
[27:35] isaac
[27:36] god bless you can you can you hear me
[27:39] yes we can no bless you god bless you
[27:42] church
[27:43] this is a little different but um trying
[27:46] to report in for duty
[27:47] so god bless you all um i can't
[27:51] hold my phone and hold your bible at the
[27:53] same time so
[27:54] we're gonna have to try to do it with
[27:56] you but it's certainly a great privilege
[27:58] uh to be here this evening on this bible
[28:01] study and to see what god is doing and
[28:03] and um to see that true the different
[28:06] challenges
[28:07] and struggles of life um something we
[28:10] have to push past the barriers
[28:12] you know to be able to to to get what
[28:15] what we need to get
[28:16] so we'll see what god will do certainly
[28:20] appreciate
[28:20] umbrella we're just standing in the in
[28:23] the gap i kind of shocked him
[28:25] when he's when i told him that the
[28:27] current the current just went
[28:29] you know so but by the grace of god i
[28:32] have a little thought
[28:33] that i want to share with you uh by the
[28:35] grace of god tonight
[28:36] so uh when we look at the
[28:39] the earthly genealogy of the lord jesus
[28:42] christ
[28:43] there are two major names
[28:46] uh that uh
[28:49] stand out you know and matthew picks it
[28:52] up in matthew 1
[28:53] 1 and i would have preached on this the
[28:55] book of the generations of jesus christ
[28:58] the son of david the son of abraham
[29:01] and abraham we know as the
[29:05] father of nations we know him as as the
[29:08] prophet we know him as the foundation of
[29:10] the covenants that
[29:11] we access and david we know him as the
[29:14] king you know him as royalty we know as
[29:16] rulership you know the root and
[29:18] offstring of david
[29:19] and when we understand context and we
[29:23] have been kind of going back and forth
[29:24] in different bible studies touching
[29:25] different scriptures touching different
[29:27] uh points in the journey so to speak
[29:29] last week we were in
[29:31] judges and we were picking up gideon um
[29:34] the mighty warrior
[29:35] and that period we established uh
[29:38] in judges was between you know joshua
[29:42] coming into the land
[29:44] and the dispensation of the kings so in
[29:47] that time
[29:48] over the period of judges the whole
[29:50] concept of a king did not exist
[29:52] you know and it was after the judges
[29:55] that that that saw the as the prophet
[29:58] would have stepped in
[29:59] and the people looking around would have
[30:01] seen
[30:02] other kingdoms and say but we don't have
[30:05] a king you know why don't we have a king
[30:06] like the other
[30:07] nations do and and and and samuel was so
[30:10] hurt by it that
[30:11] god looked at the despair of his
[30:13] prophets and said don't worry samuel
[30:15] it's not you they have rejected that
[30:17] really rejected me
[30:18] you know and out of that we know came
[30:21] king saul who was the popular king he
[30:23] was the
[30:24] the i guess the natural selection he was
[30:26] the one that
[30:27] that would have automatically been
[30:29] considered the king
[30:30] by virtue of his height and his stature
[30:32] and his presence and
[30:34] the fact that he was somebody that
[30:35] people gravitate to and all these things
[30:37] and
[30:37] he would have served for uh 40 years
[30:42] and we know that after king saul
[30:45] king kim king came king david
[30:48] for another 40 years and there's a lot
[30:50] to say about king david
[30:52] um and he's one of one of the most
[30:55] wonderful characters in scripture to
[30:56] look at
[30:58] because we see king david as a boy we
[31:01] see him
[31:02] as a shepherd we see him as a musician
[31:04] there any king's palace we see him
[31:06] you know before that as a we see him as
[31:08] a hero with with goliath we see him
[31:10] in his role as a king we see him as a
[31:12] warrior and we even get to see a
[31:14] snapshot of him as an old man
[31:16] so in building where i'm going tonight
[31:18] i'm just kind of little background for
[31:19] where i really want to end up tonight
[31:21] um i want us to go to the book of first
[31:23] kings
[31:25] and first kings is really you know what
[31:27] what starts this whole
[31:29] you know kings and the lines of the
[31:31] kings and
[31:32] and and and and the ministry of elijah
[31:35] is all all found in there
[31:36] and i want to kind of pick up a little
[31:38] bit i'm going to kind of
[31:39] i mean it's just that time just kind of
[31:41] overview some aspects of it
[31:43] um and uh you have to bear with me a bit
[31:45] i'm actually
[31:46] trying to hold a light in one hand over
[31:49] over the bible here to to get this one
[31:51] um we're gonna kind of go over view of
[31:54] first kings and build into where i want
[31:55] to go
[31:56] uh tonight now i'm gonna kind of skip
[31:59] over the first part but we know king
[32:00] david is old
[32:02] and uh he's stricken in years and
[32:05] they they they are now trying to deal
[32:08] with this
[32:08] king david who who is struggling with
[32:11] with
[32:12] with about to go down and this kind of
[32:14] stuff and and i want to go from verse
[32:16] five
[32:17] then adonijah the
[32:20] son of haget exalted himself so this is
[32:24] david's son out of niger exhorted
[32:26] himself saying
[32:28] i will be king and he prepared him
[32:31] chariots and horsemen and 50 men to run
[32:33] before him
[32:34] so he take it upon himself after seeing
[32:36] that his father king david
[32:38] is is starting to slip away he decided
[32:41] to appoint himself king
[32:43] and his father had not displeased him at
[32:46] any time
[32:47] in saying why has dow done so
[32:50] in other words the bible is saying here
[32:52] that this is happening and david
[32:54] made no remark about it he didn't
[32:55] comment about it he didn't see anything
[32:57] about it all right
[32:59] and he also was a very goodly man
[33:02] and his mother bear him after absalom
[33:04] and absalom if you recall
[33:06] would have been the one of david's son
[33:09] who had rebelled and there was a whole
[33:10] rebellion
[33:11] and and and if you don't know the story
[33:13] we'll try to get it
[33:15] at some point but we're building here
[33:17] and adonijah
[33:19] uh sorry uh and he conferred with joab
[33:22] the son of zeruah and joab would have
[33:24] been the command of the army
[33:26] and with abithia the priest and they
[33:29] followed adonijah
[33:30] and and the following adonis who helped
[33:32] him and they fallen
[33:34] but zadok the priest and ben nye the
[33:38] son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet
[33:40] and shema and ray and the mighty men
[33:42] which belonged to david were not with
[33:44] adonijah
[33:45] so i want you to see the picture david
[33:47] is on his bed he is
[33:49] tired he is wary he's sick he is not
[33:52] much he could do
[33:54] and while he is there he's sick his son
[33:57] decides it's my turn to be king it's
[34:00] it's my turn to
[34:01] to rule and he gets some support but
[34:04] some of the critical support he doesn't
[34:06] get at all
[34:07] and so we at verse nine now and i don't
[34:10] know an adviser slew
[34:12] sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the
[34:14] stone
[34:15] of zehullah which is by n rogel
[34:18] and call all his brethren the king's
[34:20] sons and all the men of judah the king's
[34:22] servants
[34:24] but natan the prophet and benaya
[34:27] and the mighty men and solomon his
[34:30] brother
[34:31] he called not wherefore natan speak unto
[34:35] bathsheba and you will remember
[34:37] who bathsheba is she would have been the
[34:39] wife of uriah who was who was killed
[34:41] uh wherefore nation nathan spake unto
[34:45] bathsheba the mother of solomon saying
[34:47] hast thou not heard
[34:48] that ado niger the son of haget dot
[34:51] reign
[34:52] and david our lord know it it not
[34:55] now therefore come let me i pray thee
[34:58] give thee
[34:59] counsel that thou may have saved their
[35:02] own life
[35:03] and the life of thy son solomon we are
[35:06] we're going to verse 30 now i'm kind of
[35:07] laying a background to where i want to
[35:09] get to
[35:09] tonight go and get thee in
[35:12] unto king david and say
[35:17] not thou o lord i had me
[35:22] solomon thy son shall reign after me and
[35:25] he shall sit upon my throne
[35:26] widen that adonai jeremiah so nathan the
[35:29] prophet
[35:30] is seeing what is happening realize as
[35:33] it were
[35:33] that david doesn't know what is going on
[35:36] and that
[35:36] bathsheba who is solomon's mother
[35:38] doesn't know what's going on as well
[35:40] and they are and he is trying to now
[35:43] intervene in the situation right
[35:45] so verse 14 behold while thou
[35:50] yet talk is there with the king i also
[35:53] will come in
[35:54] after thee and confirm thy words so
[35:56] nathan is actually now planning
[35:58] it's not like it's not an accidental
[35:59] thing he's actually putting a plan
[36:01] in place and verse 15 and bathsheba went
[36:05] in unto the king
[36:06] into the chamber and the king was very
[36:09] old so it placed in context i wanted to
[36:11] see
[36:12] this mighty man david this great king
[36:15] david
[36:16] this king david it would seem that aaron
[36:18] niger expects him to
[36:20] not take any action he is tired he is
[36:22] wary he's not aware of what is going on
[36:24] these are
[36:24] these are all the things that are
[36:25] happening there right so bashiba went in
[36:28] and to the king into the chamber and the
[36:30] king was very old and
[36:31] abhishek the sunnah might ministered
[36:34] unto the king and bathsheba bowed and
[36:37] did
[36:38] obeisance unto the king in other words
[36:40] did reverence
[36:41] and the king said what wouldest thou and
[36:44] she said unto him my lord
[36:46] thou swarest by the lord thy god unto
[36:48] thine handmaid's saying
[36:49] assortedly solomon thy son shall reign
[36:52] after me
[36:53] and he shall sit upon my throne
[36:56] and now behold arunai during it and now
[37:00] my lord
[37:01] the king don't know us it not in other
[37:04] words
[37:04] i don't think you realize you're hearing
[37:06] this bread but adonijah
[37:08] your other son actually claiming
[37:10] leadership
[37:12] not only that verse 19 and he had slain
[37:14] oxen
[37:15] and fat cattle and sheep in abundance
[37:19] and i call all these sons of the king
[37:21] and abeetha the priest
[37:23] and joab the captain of the host so so
[37:26] she spreads in a picture of how much is
[37:28] happening
[37:29] but son of man thy servant had he not
[37:31] called
[37:33] and thou my lord o king the eyes of
[37:36] all israel are upon thee you you're
[37:38] you're seeing it
[37:40] the eyes of all israel upon thee that
[37:43] thou should just tell them who shall sit
[37:45] on the throne of my lord
[37:46] the king after him this is all about me
[37:48] i really want to get to a point
[37:50] to lay a foundation for this right and
[37:52] i'll give you the title in a bit
[37:55] otherwise it shall come to pass when my
[37:57] lord the king shall sleep with his
[37:58] fathers in other words
[37:59] when he passed away that i and my
[38:02] solomon
[38:03] shall be counted offenders
[38:06] in other words and and in the amplified
[38:08] this offenders is like political enemies
[38:11] all right and law while she had talked
[38:14] with the king
[38:15] nathan the prophet also came in
[38:18] everybody with me
[38:23] and they told the king saying behold
[38:25] nathan the prophet
[38:26] and when he was coming before the king
[38:28] he bowed himself before the king with
[38:30] his face to the ground
[38:32] and nathan said my lord o king hast thou
[38:34] said
[38:35] i don't know i just shall reign after me
[38:37] and he shall sit upon my throne
[38:39] for he has gone down this day and had
[38:41] slain oxen and fat cattle
[38:43] and sheep in abundance and had called
[38:45] all the king's sons
[38:46] and the captains of the host and fear
[38:49] the priests and behold they eat and
[38:51] drink before him
[38:52] and say god save king adonijah
[38:56] just give me one minute i just
[38:59] the lord seems so hold on
[40:11] okay
[40:18] all right back back to normal
[40:22] okay can everybody hear me
[40:26] wonderful wonderful let me get position
[40:29] i have this light here and another light
[40:30] here and uh
[40:31] all right great well god bless you
[40:41] okay so we were let's so we had first
[40:44] kings one verse 25 for he has for he has
[40:46] gone down this day and
[40:48] had slain oxen and fat catalan so so
[40:50] nathan is building the scenario of
[40:52] exactly
[40:53] what the background is here right but me
[40:56] even me
[40:57] verse 26 thy servant so nathan is saying
[41:00] listen they're doing all this and me
[41:01] even me like seven and zadok the priests
[41:04] and benaya banaya is like the captain of
[41:07] the king's
[41:08] personal bodyguard these are these are
[41:10] important soldiers here right
[41:12] so banaya uh the son of johanna and thy
[41:15] seven solomon had he not called
[41:17] is this thing done by my lord the king
[41:20] and thou has not shown it unto thy
[41:22] servant
[41:23] who would sit on the throne of my lord
[41:25] the king after him
[41:26] then king david answered and said call
[41:28] me bathsheba
[41:30] and she came into the king's presence
[41:32] and stood before the king
[41:34] and i'm building this for a reason right
[41:36] and the king sway and said as the lord
[41:38] liveth
[41:39] that had redeemed my soul out of all
[41:42] distress
[41:43] and i love how david always says things
[41:45] it's never it's never a light statement
[41:46] but he told me the lord who had redeemed
[41:49] his soul from all distress right i love
[41:52] that
[41:52] is that how you feel this evening that
[41:54] the lord has delivered you from all
[41:56] distress
[41:58] is there anybody who feels that way had
[42:00] a rough week had a rough day had a rough
[42:02] month but when you look back
[42:04] david is there he this is the end of his
[42:06] junior i'm trying to
[42:07] many times we see david in his moments
[42:09] of strength we see we talk about goliath
[42:11] and we talk about
[42:12] the battle and mighty warrior david this
[42:14] is david on his bed
[42:17] winding down and he say oh god this lord
[42:19] who delivered me from all distress
[42:22] all right even as i sway unto thee by
[42:24] the lord god of israel saying assuredly
[42:27] solomon thy son shall reign after me and
[42:29] he shall sit upon my throne in my said
[42:31] even so will i certainly do this thee
[42:34] then bathsheba bowed
[42:36] with her head to the ut and did
[42:38] reverence to the king
[42:39] and said let my lord king david live
[42:42] forever
[42:43] and king david said call me zadok the
[42:45] priest so you say call the priest
[42:47] and nathan the prophet and the naya the
[42:50] son of jehoiada
[42:51] banaya is the captain of his personal
[42:53] god and they came before the king
[42:56] so i want you to see now the king this
[42:58] is king david he is old
[43:00] he is tired he is sick he is wary but he
[43:03] is
[43:03] sharp he is precise he understands that
[43:06] there is treachery in the camp
[43:08] he understands that adonijah has gone
[43:10] with the head of the army with joab
[43:12] he has gone with with one of the priests
[43:14] he has gone with
[43:15] a whole group of people and crowned
[43:17] himself but that is not deterring
[43:19] david's position because the plan of god
[43:22] and the purpose of god
[43:23] has to come to pass can the church say
[43:24] amen and the king also said unto them
[43:27] take with you the servants of your lord
[43:30] and
[43:30] cause solomon my son to ride upon my
[43:34] own mule and bring him down to gihon
[43:36] that is like
[43:37] a little water area there and let zadok
[43:40] the priest
[43:40] and nathan the prophet anoint him there
[43:43] king over israel
[43:45] and blow ye with the trumpet and say god
[43:47] save king solomon
[43:50] then shall he come up after him that he
[43:52] may come and sit
[43:54] upon my throne and he shall be king in
[43:56] my stead
[43:57] and i will have and i have appointed him
[44:00] to be ruler over
[44:01] israel and over judah i wanted to see
[44:04] this now friends
[44:05] that up until this point and and coming
[44:08] into under the 40 years on the soul
[44:11] this is the end of the 40 years under
[44:13] king david so this is now
[44:14] about 80 years of rulership under the
[44:17] two kings
[44:18] at this point in time it's about a
[44:21] transition to solomon being king
[44:23] and it was only over these three fours
[44:26] at 120 years
[44:28] the kingdom of israel was united it is
[44:30] only when king solomon died
[44:32] that there was this split between israel
[44:34] and judah
[44:35] so it's a mighty period this year's is
[44:38] what is called the
[44:38] over the golden age of the kings of
[44:41] israel because he had saul then he had
[44:43] king david the mighty king
[44:44] and then king solomon all right
[44:49] and ben and banaya the son of jehoiada
[44:51] like the head of the personal god
[44:53] answered the king
[44:54] and said amen the lord god of my lord
[44:57] the king say so too all right
[45:00] as the lord had been with my lord the
[45:02] king even so
[45:04] be here with solomon and make his throne
[45:06] greater
[45:07] than the throne of my lord king david
[45:10] so zadok the priest and natan the
[45:13] prophet
[45:14] and benaya the son of johanna and the
[45:16] cherokites
[45:17] and the pelatites now the chariotites
[45:20] and the pelatites
[45:21] that's the personal secret god of king
[45:23] you know what
[45:24] winning a king david any mighty men and
[45:26] his strong men
[45:28] david himself armed around him a
[45:31] special god maybe it was after the
[45:33] mutiny or the
[45:34] or the or the attempted coup by absalom
[45:37] but david had a personal strong god so
[45:39] when you see those men you know they
[45:41] were coming under david's orders right
[45:43] so xanax the priest and nathan the
[45:44] prophet and denied his son of johada
[45:47] and the cherokites and the pelaptites
[45:49] went down and caused solomon to ride
[45:52] upon king david's mule
[45:53] and brought him to gihon and zadok the
[45:56] priests
[45:57] took an horn of oil out of the
[45:59] tabernacle
[46:00] and anointed solomon and they blew the
[46:03] trumpet
[46:03] and all the people said god saved king
[46:06] solomon
[46:07] and all the people came up after him and
[46:09] the people piped with pipes
[46:10] and rejoiced with great joy so that the
[46:13] earth rent with the sound of them in
[46:15] other words
[46:16] they make so much noise out of it that
[46:17] the earth begin to move
[46:19] now i love how goddess on four things
[46:20] right verse 41
[46:22] and adonijah and all the guests that
[46:24] were with him heard it as they
[46:26] had made an end of eating so i want you
[46:28] to picture it
[46:30] i don't i join them now they're not
[46:31] collect any plates
[46:34] they're not wrapping up the meal this is
[46:36] at a niger celebratory dinner
[46:38] and as they're packing up the plates and
[46:40] whining along the food
[46:42] and men taking napkins and wiping their
[46:44] mouth and saying the food was good
[46:45] everything food was real good out of
[46:47] niger
[46:48] and at the night and all the guests that
[46:50] were heard it as
[46:51] they were had made an end of eaten so
[46:54] they know wrapped up and they're hearing
[46:56] this noise
[46:57] and when joab he's commander of the
[46:59] whole army of israel
[47:00] and when job heard the sound of the
[47:02] trumpet he said
[47:03] wherefore is this noise of the city
[47:06] being in an opera
[47:07] in other words where is this noise
[47:08] coming from because as far as they
[47:10] concerned the only noise the only
[47:12] celebration
[47:13] the only thing that's happening is
[47:15] around adonijah
[47:17] who they appoint as their king all right
[47:19] this is
[47:20] man's action again this is man's choice
[47:22] man selection of the king
[47:24] and i love how god says it in scripture
[47:26] and while he yet speak
[47:28] so while joab trying to figure things
[47:30] out while he yet speak
[47:32] behold jonathan the son of a beater the
[47:35] priest came
[47:36] and adonai just said unto him come come
[47:39] in for now out of valiant man and bring
[47:41] his good tidings he said come and talk
[47:42] to me come on
[47:43] bring me any loop and why there's all
[47:45] this noise
[47:46] that's going on and jonathan answered
[47:49] and said to adonai
[47:50] verily our lord king david had made
[47:53] solomon
[47:54] king and the king had sent
[47:57] with him zadok the priest and nathan the
[48:00] prophet
[48:00] and benaya the son of johanna and the
[48:03] cherokees and the pelagites
[48:05] and they have caused him to ride upon
[48:06] the king's mule
[48:08] and zalock the priest so if all of that
[48:11] is not enough and zara the priests
[48:12] and nato and the prophet have anointed
[48:15] him king and giulian
[48:16] and they are come up from thence
[48:18] rejoicing so that the city rang again
[48:21] this is the noise that he had heard
[48:24] on top of that verse 46 and also solomon
[48:27] sitted
[48:28] on the throne of the kingdom and
[48:30] moreover
[48:31] the king's servants came to bless our
[48:33] lord king david
[48:34] saying
[48:38] him and make his throne better make his
[48:41] throne greater than thy throne
[48:43] and the king bowed himself upon the bed
[48:46] and also does say the king blessed be
[48:48] the lord god of israel
[48:50] which had given one to sit on my throne
[48:52] this day mine
[48:53] eyes even seeing it listen to verse 49
[48:56] and
[48:56] all the guests that were with adonijah
[48:58] were afraid and rose up and went every
[49:00] man is weak
[49:01] party finish party crush
[49:04] everybody who came to celebrate with our
[49:06] niger they just had a sniff
[49:08] every man his own way everybody decided
[49:10] to go back to their own house they say
[49:12] we don't want the minions party in
[49:13] celebration anymore
[49:15] and adoniger verse 50 feared
[49:18] because of solomon and arose and went
[49:20] and caught hold
[49:21] on the horns of the altar what did i do
[49:25] and it was told solomon saying behold
[49:28] adonijah
[49:29] feared king solomon for lo he had caught
[49:31] hold on the horns of the altar
[49:33] saying let king solomon swear unto me
[49:36] today that he will not slay his servant
[49:39] with the sword and solomon said if he
[49:41] will show himself a worthy man
[49:43] that shall not and hear of him fall to
[49:45] the good
[49:46] but if wickedness shall be found in him
[49:48] he shall die
[49:50] so king solomon sent and they brought
[49:52] him down from the altar
[49:53] and he came and bowed himself to king
[49:55] solomon and solomon said unto him go to
[49:58] thine house
[49:58] i'm still in that background trying to
[50:00] get to my text and this will be part one
[50:02] by the grace of god
[50:04] chapter two so i know many young people
[50:07] in particular haven't really studied
[50:08] this transition of power
[50:09] between david and solomon more than that
[50:12] this is declined so to speak of david's
[50:14] ministry here
[50:16] chapter two now the days of david drew
[50:18] nigh that he should die
[50:20] and he charged solomon his son saying
[50:23] you know i'm really big on last words
[50:24] but over reference paul
[50:26] in his letter to timothy which we know
[50:28] chronologically would have been one of
[50:30] the last if not the very last letter he
[50:32] wrote
[50:32] in where he said i fought a good fight
[50:34] we spoke about
[50:36] the last words of joshua so now we're
[50:38] coming to the last words of king david
[50:41] this great king david so when we read
[50:43] about jesus
[50:44] who was of the generation of the book of
[50:46] jesus son of
[50:47] abraham son of david these are hearing
[50:49] last words of king david
[50:51] chapter two verse one now the days of
[50:53] david drew nigh that he should die
[50:55] and he charged solomon his son saying in
[50:57] other words he is he's putting a battery
[50:59] pack in
[51:00] solomon he's giving solomon his part in
[51:02] words because he wants solomon to act a
[51:05] certain way never certainly conduct
[51:07] himself a certain way
[51:08] and this will lead into where i really
[51:09] want to go
[51:11] saying i go the way of all the earth
[51:14] be thou strong therefore and show
[51:16] thyself a man
[51:17] powerful statements be thou strong
[51:20] therefore
[51:21] and showed myself a man and that is
[51:23] really profound
[51:24] because the challenge of being strong is
[51:27] still a
[51:28] challenge to us today to be strong in
[51:30] our situations
[51:31] to be strong in our circumstances the
[51:33] instruction or the charge to be strong
[51:36] is similar to what god
[51:37] told joshua be strong and very
[51:39] courageous
[51:41] it is not physical strength he's talking
[51:43] about here
[51:45] it is not he's trying to lift up
[51:47] something and move it
[51:49] this is the strength of character the
[51:50] strength of purpose the strength of
[51:52] focus
[51:53] you strengthen not give up and showing
[51:56] yourself a man
[51:57] means there will come times when you
[51:59] could wimp out and you can throw your
[52:01] head up but that is when you have to
[52:02] show
[52:02] yourself a man and i find it to be very
[52:05] encouraging because we are
[52:06] in dangerous times we are in treacherous
[52:08] times where in times when
[52:10] men have feeling for fear and people
[52:12] losing their anchor
[52:13] willing to throw their heads up and give
[52:14] up but hear how
[52:16] david begins to instruct solomon and he
[52:18] and the order of the charge the order of
[52:21] the
[52:21] a charge like a commission so this is
[52:23] david's commission
[52:24] he's giving solomon a commission he's
[52:27] saying we have been also given a
[52:28] commission
[52:29] anybody with me tonight
[52:33] i go the way of all the earth in other
[52:35] words i'm about to go
[52:36] peed out strong therefore and show
[52:39] myself a man
[52:40] all right i'm going but don't be weak
[52:42] i'm going but don't give up
[52:44] all right and keep the charge of the
[52:47] lord thy god
[52:48] i love this to walk in his ways this is
[52:51] one of the most profound conversations
[52:54] a father can have with a son this is a
[52:56] father speaking to a son he's not just
[52:58] a king speaking to a king this is a
[53:01] father speaking to her son all right
[53:03] and keep the charge of the lord thy god
[53:05] to walk in his ways
[53:07] one to keep his statutes two
[53:10] and his commandments three and his
[53:13] judgments
[53:14] for and his testimonies five as it is
[53:18] written
[53:18] in the law of moses that thomas prosper
[53:22] in all that thou doest and whether so
[53:24] ever doubting is thyself
[53:26] i want to read that one more time
[53:28] because this principle
[53:30] still applies to us today that if you
[53:33] walk in his ways
[53:34] anybody with me if you keep his statutes
[53:37] and his commandments
[53:39] and his judgment and his testimony
[53:43] oh hallelujah as it is written in the
[53:46] law of moses
[53:46] which was only a shadow of what was to
[53:49] come
[53:50] but we understand what is being said
[53:52] here huh that dom may is prosper
[53:54] in all not some in all in other words do
[53:57] these five things
[53:58] and watch you prosper in all that thou
[54:02] doest this is not some
[54:03] this is not just business this is school
[54:06] this is family this is relationship this
[54:08] is in your community this is in your
[54:10] place of work in all it's a unbreakable
[54:13] principle and this is the charge that
[54:15] david is giving to solomon is this
[54:17] cutting through the noise here with
[54:19] whatsoever and when or so
[54:21] so not just prosper in what you're doing
[54:23] you know but with us whoever you're
[54:25] telling yourself wherever you go
[54:27] because you're following a principle
[54:50] hmm
[54:53] oh this give worship a little bit saints
[54:55] while we reach a little bit just give
[54:57] them some praise
[54:58] give us some praise and thanks
[54:59] hallelujah lord be thank you lord we
[55:01] praise you
[55:02] lord we worship you we honor you
[55:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:06] blessed be the name of the lord blessed
[55:08] be the name of the lord thank you jesus
[55:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[55:16] amen everybody with me amen
[55:19] okay great so we're going to start
[55:22] without timing yourself that the lord
[55:24] may
[55:24] continue his word so david is speaking
[55:27] to solomon i'm talking about the
[55:29] continuation of your word you know
[55:30] hallelujah
[55:31] that the lord may continue his word
[55:35] which he spake concerning me that's
[55:38] that's powerful
[55:39] i wanted to see the connections through
[55:40] scripture because
[55:42] we talk about the ministry of jehu how
[55:44] god spoken to elijah
[55:46] but we didn't see the connection between
[55:48] god speaking to elijah
[55:50] and elisha picking up the continuation
[55:52] of the word and that word continuing
[55:54] through
[55:55] a son or somebody from the school of the
[55:56] prophets that was able to fulfill it but
[55:59] it was a continuation of the word
[56:00] so here it is david and we know it king
[56:03] solomon was he wanted to build the
[56:04] temple because david hand was too bloody
[56:06] but this was a continuation of the word
[56:08] that the lord may continue his word
[56:11] which he speak concerning me saying if
[56:13] thy children take heed to their way
[56:15] to walk before me in truth with all
[56:18] their heart
[56:19] and with all their soul they shall not
[56:22] fear thee
[56:23] said he a man on the throne of israel
[56:26] all right so last words all right so i
[56:28] want to quickly wrap up this i'm going
[56:29] to kind of speed through this part here
[56:31] so david what do you admire about david
[56:35] david is wrapping up his ministry now he
[56:38] charged solomon he gave
[56:39] solomon a powerful commission apart and
[56:42] then
[56:42] he he he leaves his his last secret
[56:45] orders
[56:46] to his son and jesse you understand how
[56:48] god operates and and you can see why god
[56:50] operates the way that he does and he
[56:51] could see
[56:52] how god could say david a man after my
[56:54] own heart moreover
[56:56] so after that whole powerful
[56:58] introduction he said moreover
[57:00] don't know us also what joab the captain
[57:02] of the army
[57:03] the son of zero zero is his sister
[57:07] so this is david's nephew joab is
[57:09] david's nephew
[57:10] zero is david's sister moreover i don't
[57:13] know it's also what joab
[57:15] my nephew the son of z of zer
[57:18] did to me in other words how he hurt me
[57:22] and what he did to the two captains of
[57:24] the host of israel
[57:25] unto abner the son of nir abner was
[57:28] saul's commander of the army so when
[57:30] saul was king
[57:32] abner was commander of the army and if
[57:34] you go back in
[57:35] in samuel you will read that david did
[57:38] not want
[57:39] abner to be killed but joab went against
[57:42] david orders
[57:43] and killed abner because abner had
[57:46] killed his brother
[57:49] and david said don't take no revenge on
[57:51] him but joab
[57:53] took it upon himself to kill abner so
[57:55] david is going he's leaving the earth
[57:57] he's he's leaving this plane he charges
[58:00] solomon and say
[58:01] solomon i have some unfinished business
[58:03] that you have to continue
[58:04] all right moreover don't know it's also
[58:07] what joab the son of zero
[58:09] he's come he's still commander of the
[58:10] army right now did to me and what he did
[58:13] to the two captain of the host of israel
[58:15] unto abner
[58:16] the son of nu who was commander on the
[58:18] soul and unto amasa
[58:20] amasa is actually joab's cousin
[58:24] so this is also solomon's cousin he
[58:26] became
[58:27] he was the commander on the absalom in
[58:30] the rebellion
[58:31] and when absalom was defeated and david
[58:34] came back in power
[58:36] david put amazon to head the army which
[58:38] joa was furious about
[58:41] and again outside of david's instruction
[58:44] drew up also killed amazon
[58:45] so david is going but he wants to tie up
[58:47] these these loose ends these are loose
[58:50] ends
[58:50] being tied up in david's ministry here
[58:52] all right
[58:54] whom he slew and shed the blood of war
[58:56] in peace meaning it was in a time of
[58:58] peace
[58:59] that joab did this and put the blood of
[59:02] war upon his girdle
[59:03] that was about his loins and in his
[59:05] shoes that were on his sweet
[59:06] do therefore
[59:14] it's like we lose you there uh the audio
[59:17] or something with the audio
[59:18] then just do the f4 just repeat that you
[59:21] hear me now
[59:21] yeah yes back again yes dude therefore
[59:25] according to my wisdom
[59:26] and let not his horror head this world
[59:29] is like grey head
[59:31] don't let his gray head go down to the
[59:33] grave in peace in other words punish him
[59:35] for what he did
[59:35] right but show kindness unto the sons
[59:39] of basilia the gilead right and let
[59:42] them be of those that eat at that table
[59:45] why
[59:46] for so they came to me when i fled
[59:47] because of absalom thy brother
[59:50] and behold thou has with thee and he
[59:52] goes on and verse 10
[59:54] just to kind of close this part up so
[59:55] david slept with his fathers
[59:57] and was buried in the city of david and
[1:00:00] the days that david reigned over israel
[1:00:02] were 40 years all right so
[1:00:06] i want to know can i just introduce my
[1:00:07] thought for tonight and it is a study of
[1:00:10] solomon part 1
[1:00:11] and i want to call it the prayer of
[1:00:14] solomon
[1:00:15] and i want to build from there so i want
[1:00:17] us to now skip over
[1:00:19] to first kings 3 and we're going to read
[1:00:22] from
[1:00:23] verse 3. so david has gone on
[1:00:27] and i want to play some context here so
[1:00:29] we could kind of go forward here
[1:00:31] all right everybody with me first kings
[1:00:33] three verse three
[1:00:35] and solomon loved the lord is that a
[1:00:38] beautiful statement
[1:00:40] and how how does he prove it
[1:00:43] walking in the statutes of david his
[1:00:46] father
[1:00:47] so it's not just love the lord and he
[1:00:49] and he love you lord and you're living
[1:00:50] your own
[1:00:51] your own way he's he's trying his best
[1:00:53] with what he knows all right
[1:00:54] so and solomon loved the lord walking in
[1:00:57] the statute of david his father and he
[1:00:59] amplified it will say at first
[1:01:01] and we'll get to that in another
[1:01:02] teaching only he sacrificed and burned
[1:01:04] incense in high places
[1:01:06] meaning that was somewhat of a negative
[1:01:09] and this is contextual because we know
[1:01:11] salomon would build
[1:01:12] the temple um and
[1:01:16] going up to a mountain to do a sacrifice
[1:01:18] with some level was considered a heathen
[1:01:20] thing at the time
[1:01:21] and the king verse 4 went to gibeon to
[1:01:24] sacrifice there
[1:01:25] for that was the great high place
[1:01:28] a thousand burnt offerings that solomon
[1:01:31] offer upon that altar
[1:01:33] now verse five in gibeon the lord
[1:01:36] appeared to solomon in a dream
[1:01:38] my night and god asked and god said ask
[1:01:42] what i
[1:01:42] shall give thee a powerful question
[1:01:46] what shall i give thee and i remember
[1:01:49] many times preaching and i say if the
[1:01:50] lord were to come tonight
[1:01:52] and grant the desires of your heart
[1:01:54] church
[1:01:55] what would that desire be that's a deep
[1:01:58] question
[1:02:00] the lord could daughter come to you
[1:02:01] right now you remember sister hattie
[1:02:03] right
[1:02:04] she said you're writing so the prophet
[1:02:06] said what can i do for you what do you
[1:02:08] want your lord to do for you
[1:02:09] whatever your will be granted
[1:02:11] it's a really powerful deep question
[1:02:12] that really
[1:02:14] assesses your character your nature all
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:18] so this is why i call it the prayer of
[1:02:19] solomon because i found it to be such a
[1:02:21] a moving call it a a prayer
[1:02:24] it's part of a dream but it's jesus it
[1:02:26] comes across as a petition right
[1:02:29] verse 5 and giving the lord appeared to
[1:02:31] sullivan in a dream by night and
[1:02:33] god said ask what i shall give thee
[1:02:36] and the reason i call it a prayer as
[1:02:37] well and i don't know if you remember
[1:02:39] uh brother billy paul one time said he
[1:02:41] walked into
[1:02:42] his father's study and he saw it was as
[1:02:45] if brother branham was just having
[1:02:47] a conversation so he wasn't sure who his
[1:02:49] father was
[1:02:50] was speaking to because he didn't like
[1:02:51] know if anybody was there so and then
[1:02:53] when he looked closer he saw his father
[1:02:55] by himself and he realized that his
[1:02:56] father was praying
[1:02:58] and many times we tell we try to
[1:02:59] encourage you prayers and about thee
[1:03:01] thou thine prayer is a conversation
[1:03:04] prayer is is fellowship with god
[1:03:07] prayer is you having a a relationship
[1:03:09] and a conversation with god
[1:03:11] so when god asks the question what can i
[1:03:13] do for thee
[1:03:15] what he's really activating is your
[1:03:17] request once you're making a request
[1:03:18] that falls
[1:03:19] on the prayer and you should be in a
[1:03:21] position at all times
[1:03:23] to be able to express to god what you
[1:03:25] want him to do for you
[1:03:30] but ibrahim said it like this he said we
[1:03:32] don't act for big things he says what's
[1:03:33] the actual big things
[1:03:35] some of us we want god help us with some
[1:03:37] little thing and there are big things we
[1:03:38] could ask for but i wanted to look into
[1:03:40] solomon
[1:03:41] because i'm still all this is background
[1:03:42] to where i want to end up
[1:03:45] and solomon said thou has showed thy
[1:03:48] unto thy servant david my father great
[1:03:51] mercy
[1:03:52] according as he had walked before thee
[1:03:54] in truth and in righteousness
[1:03:57] and in uprightness of heart with thee
[1:04:00] and thou has kept for him
[1:04:02] this great kindness that thou has given
[1:04:06] him a son to sit on his throne
[1:04:08] as it as it is this day
[1:04:12] and now oh lord my god
[1:04:15] thou has made thy servant king instead
[1:04:18] of david my father
[1:04:20] and and this is what sort of blow my
[1:04:22] mind in the approach
[1:04:24] and i am but a little child
[1:04:27] i know not how to go out or come in
[1:04:32] and i'm reading this and i'm looking at
[1:04:34] my life looking at
[1:04:36] different lives looking at different
[1:04:37] scriptures looking at different
[1:04:38] situations
[1:04:39] and i'm watching this is not humility on
[1:04:42] this play
[1:04:43] this is a transparent
[1:04:46] honest conversation without a fear of
[1:04:50] coming across as being weak
[1:04:53] solomon is pouring out his heart and
[1:04:56] he's
[1:04:57] reaching that point saying listen i know
[1:04:59] not how to go out or how to come in
[1:05:03] and i find so many times we approach
[1:05:05] life as if we know
[1:05:06] the key to the next door in our
[1:05:08] situation
[1:05:11] we operate with this call it a false
[1:05:13] sense of security
[1:05:14] in our experience because i want us to
[1:05:17] put this in further context
[1:05:19] this is solomon who would have grown up
[1:05:21] in the house of a king
[1:05:23] he would have been afforded the best
[1:05:25] education
[1:05:27] he would have been trained to be in the
[1:05:29] royal family
[1:05:31] his mother knew along with the prophet
[1:05:33] nathan
[1:05:34] that he was earmarked for king so he
[1:05:36] would have had the best training
[1:05:38] the best tutors the best governors the
[1:05:41] best
[1:05:42] overseers he was preparing to be a
[1:05:45] leader
[1:05:46] and he is not leaning on that this
[1:05:48] reminds us of moses
[1:05:51] moses after the best training in egypt
[1:05:54] when he met the burning bush anybody
[1:05:56] with me when he came into contact with
[1:05:59] god
[1:06:00] none of his education his experiences
[1:06:03] his his ups and downs and his struggles
[1:06:05] and what he achieved
[1:06:07] all of it seemed to disappear you see
[1:06:09] the parallel
[1:06:11] david solomon
[1:06:14] moses go through scripture when you come
[1:06:17] into contact with god
[1:06:18] you cannot produce a resume hallelujah
[1:06:23] you cannot bring your gifts your
[1:06:26] experience your knowledge to the table
[1:06:29] and solomon
[1:06:30] in his own simple way because many times
[1:06:33] we go through life
[1:06:34] and we make decisions and the
[1:06:36] consequences that we face
[1:06:38] is because of our decision and because
[1:06:39] we didn't have enough trust in god
[1:06:42] and i want to connect this to where
[1:06:44] we're going to end up because all this
[1:06:45] is
[1:06:46] it's background to get where i want to
[1:06:47] end up and i will explain when we get
[1:06:48] there why i wanted to do it this week
[1:06:51] i want to say it one time i know oh lord
[1:06:53] my god thou has made thy servant king
[1:06:56] may thy servant king could be applied to
[1:07:00] any area
[1:07:00] you have made me a father you've made me
[1:07:03] a mother
[1:07:04] you have given me this job you have
[1:07:06] given me this responsibility
[1:07:08] you have given me whatever god has given
[1:07:10] you but i know
[1:07:12] not how to go out or come in
[1:07:15] so i don't want to venture in my own
[1:07:17] strength i don't want to venture
[1:07:19] with my own ability i don't want to try
[1:07:21] to do this thing my own way
[1:07:23] i have ideas i have suggestions i i hear
[1:07:26] from a father
[1:07:27] we did it but i want to do it your way
[1:07:31] i don't know when last time you go along
[1:07:34] on your knees and say to the lord lord i
[1:07:36] don't know
[1:07:37] how to go out i don't know how to come
[1:07:38] in i don't know how to resolve this
[1:07:40] situation i don't know how to turn this
[1:07:42] thing around
[1:07:43] i've been entrusted because solomon is
[1:07:45] saying i've been pushed into a place
[1:07:47] that i didn't plan
[1:07:48] i didn't put myself here come on now
[1:07:50] i've been pushed into this walk as a
[1:07:52] christian
[1:07:53] and i didn't choose this walk this walk
[1:07:55] chose me
[1:07:56] solomon didn't go up for election to be
[1:07:58] king
[1:07:59] he was given a charge he was given a
[1:08:02] commission
[1:08:03] he was called out of all of the sons of
[1:08:05] david because david had
[1:08:07] many sons and there were sons who wanted
[1:08:09] the position this one didn't
[1:08:11] try to get the position he didn't try to
[1:08:13] become king
[1:08:14] he didn't rally around him and say i
[1:08:16] want to do this
[1:08:17] this was not his desire to be in that
[1:08:19] position and now it's entrusted upon him
[1:08:22] he is doing one of the most powerful
[1:08:23] things and god is pleased he is pleased
[1:08:26] the way god could say david a man after
[1:08:29] my own heart we could see solomon
[1:08:31] was connected to that same same behavior
[1:08:34] that god was attracted to
[1:08:37] and thy servant verse 8 is in the midst
[1:08:41] of thy people which dao has chosen you
[1:08:44] see the context
[1:08:47] this is a challenge to us as leaders
[1:08:50] as ministers as elders as deacons
[1:08:53] as fathers whatever role we're in and
[1:08:56] thy servant is in the midst of thy
[1:08:58] people which thou has chosen
[1:09:01] are great people so so in his approach
[1:09:05] and his prayer
[1:09:06] he is placing himself as the one who
[1:09:08] doesn't know who needs guidance
[1:09:10] and he's magnifying the people he said
[1:09:12] thy servant is in the myth of thy people
[1:09:15] which dao has chosen a great people that
[1:09:18] cannot be numbered nor counted for
[1:09:20] multitude
[1:09:21] anybody with me tonight give therefore
[1:09:24] thy servant
[1:09:25] an understanding heart oh my
[1:09:29] now we're getting into the area that i
[1:09:31] want to get in give
[1:09:32] therefore thy servant an understanding
[1:09:35] heart
[1:09:36] to judge thy people that i may discern
[1:09:40] between good and bad you know how much
[1:09:43] trouble you would have avoided if you
[1:09:44] could discern
[1:09:46] your good decisions from the bad
[1:09:48] decisions
[1:09:49] you know how much trouble you would
[1:09:51] avoid if you discern
[1:09:52] the good people around you from the bad
[1:09:55] people around you
[1:09:57] you know how much trouble you would
[1:09:58] overcome if you had an understanding
[1:10:01] heart to judge situations
[1:10:03] and people that and understand how we
[1:10:06] place it that
[1:10:07] i may discern because things can come to
[1:10:10] you and you're not understanding but you
[1:10:12] need discernment
[1:10:13] if there ever was a time church to need
[1:10:15] discernment
[1:10:16] spiritual discernment there are many
[1:10:19] things happening around
[1:10:20] us but we need deserve it we need we
[1:10:22] need the eye
[1:10:23] south to come off of our eyes this is
[1:10:25] what solomon is praying for huh
[1:10:27] that i may deserve between good and bad
[1:10:29] for who is able to
[1:10:31] judge this thigh so great of people
[1:10:34] he's saying lord is your people what if
[1:10:37] fathers do that about their children
[1:10:39] come on now
[1:10:42] you didn't make each item what if
[1:10:44] mothers do it for their children
[1:10:47] it's it's a gift it is a gift entrusted
[1:10:50] to us
[1:10:51] as parents it's a gift and you have to
[1:10:54] say lord i don't know how to go out i
[1:10:56] don't know how to come in i don't know
[1:10:57] how to do this
[1:10:59] because it's your gift you know what
[1:11:01] this child needs come on now
[1:11:03] the lord bless you with a business it is
[1:11:05] not your achievement
[1:11:06] we are under different law what the
[1:11:08] world does is separate from what we do
[1:11:11] come on now what the world does is
[1:11:12] they're under a different principle but
[1:11:15] you your business your career your
[1:11:18] job your degree
[1:11:21] it has been the grace of god and god
[1:11:23] allowing it to come to you
[1:11:25] now for you to have a responsibility
[1:11:27] with it i want you to see that
[1:11:30] because if you claim it as your
[1:11:32] achievement we talk about gideon god say
[1:11:33] i don't want to make no mistake about it
[1:11:35] that no credit could be taken by man
[1:11:38] when it comes to god's kingdom he
[1:11:40] doesn't want man taking credit
[1:11:43] he wants to get all the honor all the
[1:11:45] glory anybody with me
[1:11:47] tonight and listen to verse 10
[1:11:51] and this speech please the lord oh my
[1:11:54] you know your prayer could please you
[1:11:56] lord it's like sister hati right
[1:11:58] it's the same thing please the lord in
[1:12:00] other words she said the right thing in
[1:12:02] other words
[1:12:02] solomon said the right thing and i've
[1:12:05] said it before
[1:12:06] you could say the right thing the
[1:12:09] consequences
[1:12:10] your tomorrow your next week your next
[1:12:13] month
[1:12:13] is a product of you saying the right
[1:12:16] thing
[1:12:17] you have to speak positive you have to
[1:12:19] speak right
[1:12:20] you have to if you don't know what to
[1:12:22] say don't say nothing but abraham said
[1:12:24] you see if you have nothing good to say
[1:12:25] don't say nothing at all
[1:12:26] anybody with me because your words have
[1:12:29] power
[1:12:31] and this these words that solomon said
[1:12:33] was so powerful
[1:12:35] that it pleased the lord
[1:12:38] verse 10 and his speech please the lord
[1:12:40] that solomon had accessed thing
[1:12:42] and god said to him because thou has
[1:12:45] asked this thing
[1:12:46] listen to how god look at it because god
[1:12:48] has asked this thing
[1:12:50] and has not asked for thyself long life
[1:12:54] neither has acts riches for thyself
[1:12:57] now has asked the life of thine enemies
[1:13:01] but has acts for thyself understanding
[1:13:04] the discern judgment how many parents
[1:13:07] are asking for
[1:13:08] understanding to discern judgment how
[1:13:11] many christian business people are
[1:13:13] asking for
[1:13:14] understanding to discern judgment how
[1:13:16] many people on their job saying lord
[1:13:19] i have a promotion coming give me
[1:13:21] understanding the design judgment
[1:13:23] i do not want to walk into this board
[1:13:24] meeting alone i do not want to walk into
[1:13:27] this presentation alone
[1:13:29] anybody with me tonight i want to bring
[1:13:31] it home
[1:13:32] because people disconnect scripture and
[1:13:35] and what has happened with their daily
[1:13:37] lives
[1:13:39] there's nothing wrong with praying
[1:13:40] before you go to work there's nothing
[1:13:42] wrong with praying in your work there's
[1:13:44] nothing wrong with praying before your
[1:13:45] static computer
[1:13:46] there's nothing wrong with praying
[1:13:47] before you're working a presentation
[1:13:49] come on now i want you to understand
[1:13:51] that if you take this approach
[1:13:53] lord i'm gonna attempt this thing but i
[1:13:55] don't want to tell me without you
[1:13:56] guide my hands guide my thoughts help me
[1:13:58] stay focused helping out the prizes
[1:14:00] thing how to cook this food
[1:14:02] come on now that's the relationship that
[1:14:05] you want to have with us
[1:14:09] why wouldn't you use the best resource
[1:14:12] that you could ever have the best friend
[1:14:15] who
[1:14:15] you don't have to reach too far to reach
[1:14:17] him because he's always there
[1:14:19] once you call him he responds because
[1:14:20] that's how he wants to be
[1:14:22] anybody with me tonight let's make it
[1:14:24] personal let's make it personal
[1:14:28] because thou has asked this thing
[1:14:30] because of what you asked for because of
[1:14:32] how your aspect because of how you're
[1:14:34] presented to me
[1:14:36] and has not asked for myself long life
[1:14:38] in other words
[1:14:39] he wasn't looking at his own self you
[1:14:41] know his asking for understanding for
[1:14:43] judgment was a body people
[1:14:45] you have to understand church that our
[1:14:47] lives are not just for us
[1:14:49] our lives is for our families our lives
[1:14:52] is for the kingdom
[1:14:53] when have you ever asked for something
[1:14:55] for the kingdom
[1:14:57] whenever have you asked for something
[1:14:59] for somebody else outside of yourself
[1:15:02] and you want to get blessed but you're
[1:15:04] going to god lord be
[1:15:05] me my my me me my mind solomon's prayer
[1:15:09] had no me and my in it it was i am not
[1:15:12] equipped
[1:15:13] to deal with this challenge there are
[1:15:15] people around me who need leadership i'm
[1:15:17] entrusted with leadership
[1:15:19] but i want your guidance with how to
[1:15:21] lead i want your guidance without to
[1:15:22] leave my family i want you guys to leave
[1:15:25] the church i want you guys to leave my
[1:15:26] business
[1:15:27] whatever is your domain you want
[1:15:29] guidance because we are all kings we
[1:15:31] went through this teaching
[1:15:32] kings and priests royal priesthood so
[1:15:35] i'm speaking to kings tonight
[1:15:37] i want to charge you tonight like david
[1:15:39] chad solomon
[1:15:40] because there was that charge that david
[1:15:42] gave to solomon that now has solomon
[1:15:44] approaching things a certain way because
[1:15:46] he's walking in his statutes of his
[1:15:48] father
[1:15:49] forgive me for being excited but i wanna
[1:15:51] i wanna push this
[1:15:53] so you could break past the strong
[1:15:55] barrier of your life
[1:15:57] break past whatever's holding you back
[1:16:00] break past whatever limit you place upon
[1:16:02] yourself or you allow the enemy to place
[1:16:04] on you or your family to place on you
[1:16:06] and i'm saying you could ask the right
[1:16:08] thing
[1:16:08] you could say the right thing and god
[1:16:10] could give you spiritual understanding
[1:16:12] understanding to know how to move what
[1:16:14] to do every day of your life
[1:16:16] somebody say amen
[1:16:20] we go on and go outside
[1:16:23] i can't even pass this i even this is
[1:16:25] still in background
[1:16:26] that's why i got going on the ladder
[1:16:29] this is steady i have reached the
[1:16:30] subject of what i want to get to yet
[1:16:32] right
[1:16:33] because thou has existing and has not
[1:16:35] asked for thyself
[1:16:37] long life neither has acts riches for
[1:16:39] thyself
[1:16:40] now has asked the life of the enemies
[1:16:42] which is also for yourself
[1:16:44] but has asked for thy self understanding
[1:16:46] to own judgment behold
[1:16:48] i have done according to thy words lo
[1:16:52] listen carefully i have given thee a
[1:16:54] wise
[1:16:55] and an understanding heart
[1:16:59] so that there was none like thee before
[1:17:01] thee
[1:17:02] neither after thee shall any rise like
[1:17:05] unto thee you see that scripture
[1:17:07] so i want to place solomon in his
[1:17:09] position tonight
[1:17:11] so you understand the context for when
[1:17:13] we read in scripture of jesus himself
[1:17:15] was
[1:17:16] rep was worse was mentioned in solomon
[1:17:18] this is the context
[1:17:19] in which it was done right and i have
[1:17:22] also given thee
[1:17:23] that which thou has not asked so you
[1:17:25] mean to tell me brother is like that
[1:17:27] i could ask god and he could give me
[1:17:28] things i even asked for oh my
[1:17:30] my my my my my my mind
[1:17:34] listen to the lord verse 13 and i have
[1:17:36] also given thee
[1:17:38] that which doubt has not asked brought
[1:17:41] riches and honor so that there shall not
[1:17:44] be
[1:17:45] any among the kings like under the old
[1:17:48] ideas
[1:17:49] and if god will walk in my ways to keep
[1:17:52] my statutes
[1:17:53] and my commandments as thy father david
[1:17:57] walked then i will
[1:17:58] lengthen your days so in other words
[1:18:00] everything that god taught you is going
[1:18:02] to ask for or say you could i ask for
[1:18:03] this go give him all of that too because
[1:18:05] he asks
[1:18:06] for the right thing anybody with me
[1:18:09] tonight a few more minutes because this
[1:18:12] teaching by the grace of god will have
[1:18:13] to continue
[1:18:14] all right so solomon we know would reign
[1:18:17] as king for 40 years this was the
[1:18:19] beginning of his ministry all right so
[1:18:22] saul was there for 10 years
[1:18:24] david was there for 10 years solomon was
[1:18:27] there for 10 years
[1:18:28] and we know that under solomon the king
[1:18:31] of israel became
[1:18:32] stronger wealthier it was 40 years of
[1:18:35] peace
[1:18:36] in fact the name solomon is a derivative
[1:18:38] from the word shalom which
[1:18:40] means peace so it actually means peace
[1:18:41] as well men from all over the world
[1:18:43] would come to listen to solomon
[1:18:45] solomon was the author of the book of
[1:18:48] proverbs
[1:18:49] he wrote a lot of songs the queen of
[1:18:52] sheba but iran and preacher
[1:18:54] message on the queen of sheba and he
[1:18:56] dramatized it
[1:18:57] how the queen of sheba heard about it
[1:19:02] and and and let me see if i just have it
[1:19:03] here
[1:19:05] in solomon's time brother branham said
[1:19:07] and i wouldn't get him to read all of it
[1:19:09] but he was dramatizing
[1:19:10] how it was a long journey maybe about
[1:19:13] three months
[1:19:14] for the queen of sheba because she had
[1:19:15] heard by the reputation of his wisdom
[1:19:18] and she wanted to be convinced and she
[1:19:20] came to ask these hard questions and by
[1:19:22] time she
[1:19:23] left she came with doubts about his
[1:19:26] wisdom
[1:19:26] and left saying in other words he wiser
[1:19:28] than i even thought he was
[1:19:30] king solomon will go on to build the
[1:19:32] temple and
[1:19:34] we we know all of this but i wanted to
[1:19:36] really now strike on to what i really
[1:19:37] want to get on this whole time to place
[1:19:39] the context
[1:19:41] i really wanted to touch the book of
[1:19:43] proverbs
[1:19:44] because it is i wanted to make sure and
[1:19:46] pass through the journey
[1:19:48] to get to the book of proverbs
[1:19:51] because the book of words proverbs 1 1
[1:19:53] says the proverbs of solomon
[1:19:55] the son of david king of israel
[1:19:58] and for the next few minutes until we
[1:20:00] lock off this is this is we're going to
[1:20:02] spend our time in proverbs
[1:20:03] because i want to bring out some things
[1:20:05] here to encourage you a little bit
[1:20:08] and to lay a perspective here to
[1:20:10] encourage us
[1:20:12] how we should go just want to give my
[1:20:16] other transition here
[1:20:17] so proverbs 1 1 so
[1:20:20] as a result i want to put this as a
[1:20:22] result of
[1:20:23] solomon's prayer as a result of how he
[1:20:26] walked
[1:20:27] as a result of the commission that was
[1:20:29] given to him from his father david
[1:20:31] as a result of the word that was
[1:20:33] covering him
[1:20:35] solomon was the wisest man until christ
[1:20:39] and we know it from the scripture in
[1:20:42] matthew 12
[1:20:43] verse 38 then certain of the scribes one
[1:20:46] of the pharisees answered saying master
[1:20:48] we would see a sign from thee
[1:20:50] in other words show us something jesus
[1:20:52] but he answered and sent it to them an
[1:20:54] evil
[1:20:55] and adulterous generation seek it after
[1:20:57] a sign
[1:20:58] and there shall be no sign given to it
[1:21:01] for the sign of the prophet jonas for as
[1:21:04] jonas was three days and three nights in
[1:21:06] the whale's belly
[1:21:07] so shall the son of man be three days
[1:21:09] and three nights in the heart of the ut
[1:21:11] the men of nineveh shall rise in
[1:21:13] judgment with this generation
[1:21:15] and shall condemn it because they
[1:21:16] repented at the preaching of jonas
[1:21:18] and behold are greater than jonas is
[1:21:21] here
[1:21:22] and the queen of the south shall rise up
[1:21:24] in the judgment
[1:21:26] with this generation and shall condemn
[1:21:28] it for she came from the uttermost part
[1:21:30] of the earth
[1:21:31] to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold
[1:21:34] a greater than solomon is here
[1:21:38] powerful powerful scripture so i want to
[1:21:40] encourage the church
[1:21:41] and the young people and as a young man
[1:21:43] growing up i was saying
[1:21:44] my dad didn't remember i was sharing
[1:21:47] with my dad i think i was around 12
[1:21:49] or 13 years old and there's some novel
[1:21:52] some book i wanted to read
[1:21:54] and my dad told me you're not gonna get
[1:21:56] that book
[1:21:57] until you read the seven church ages
[1:22:00] so i went and read these seven church
[1:22:02] ages
[1:22:03] in its entirety at age 12 so i could get
[1:22:07] to the novel
[1:22:08] that i wanted to read and
[1:22:11] as a young man growing up the book of
[1:22:13] proverbs
[1:22:15] was a go-to book it is a book of such
[1:22:19] wisdom inspiration advice
[1:22:23] counsel whether it's your life whether
[1:22:26] it's school
[1:22:27] whether it's relationship whether it's
[1:22:29] marriage business
[1:22:30] productivity everything there you can
[1:22:32] find it in the book of proverbs
[1:22:34] and proverbs has 31 chapters so i
[1:22:38] remember saying to the young people
[1:22:39] years ago
[1:22:40] this is a book that you could take a
[1:22:42] month and study
[1:22:44] every single chapter of proverbs
[1:22:48] take proverbs one on the first every
[1:22:50] month all the way down day
[1:22:52] by day and study it and if you begin to
[1:22:55] apply the principles here because
[1:22:57] having studied business and having gone
[1:22:59] to school and i haven't been through all
[1:23:01] kinds of experiences when i look through
[1:23:02] this i said with them
[1:23:03] everything they're trying to explain and
[1:23:05] everything is in in
[1:23:07] in this book in them so let's read a few
[1:23:09] verses
[1:23:10] and we'll wrap this up tonight the
[1:23:13] proverbs of solomon
[1:23:14] the son of david king of israel
[1:23:17] and i want you to understand why this
[1:23:19] book exists because
[1:23:21] i find it very troubling that a lot of
[1:23:23] christians
[1:23:24] and in particular message believers seem
[1:23:27] to
[1:23:27] want to accept a lack of training a lack
[1:23:30] of warning your skills a lack of mastery
[1:23:33] i want to use that word mastery all
[1:23:35] right because the bible talk about
[1:23:36] striving for the mastery
[1:23:38] in other words you have to want
[1:23:41] to be able to master circumstances
[1:23:44] by the holy ghost it must be a desire
[1:23:47] that you have that you're not always out
[1:23:48] of control
[1:23:49] you're not always you don't know what's
[1:23:51] going on and you're
[1:23:52] you're being dashed all around but when
[1:23:54] you read proverbs you see context
[1:23:56] here to know wisdom verse 2 and
[1:23:59] instruction
[1:24:00] so the proverbs has a purpose the
[1:24:02] purpose is
[1:24:04] to know wisdom and instruction what
[1:24:07] we're doing in bible study is about
[1:24:09] instruction
[1:24:11] we're taking time to go through
[1:24:13] scripture to pull
[1:24:14] keys instructions wisdom to know wisdom
[1:24:18] and instruction
[1:24:19] to perceive the words of understanding
[1:24:22] all right in the amplified that verse 2
[1:24:25] says
[1:24:26] to know skillful and godly wisdom and
[1:24:28] instruction
[1:24:30] to discern and comprehend the words of
[1:24:33] understanding and insight
[1:24:34] we cannot in 2020 go around
[1:24:38] not interested in knowing how to raise
[1:24:40] our children
[1:24:42] we cannot in 2020 going around and
[1:24:45] saying well that's how it's always been
[1:24:46] and not know how to save money
[1:24:48] manage your finances because in this in
[1:24:51] this same proverbs talk about how you
[1:24:52] manage
[1:24:53] your investments in this same book of
[1:24:56] proverbs talk about every encounter how
[1:24:58] you can get in trouble
[1:24:59] if the book of proverbs gives you and
[1:25:02] the bible in general
[1:25:04] in its entirety gives you the keys to
[1:25:06] know how to navigate life
[1:25:08] you have no excuse it's one
[1:25:12] thing to say whether you don't know but
[1:25:14] now in this age when we are reading from
[1:25:17] not just the scripture but the open book
[1:25:20] because we are the prophet who come to
[1:25:22] to tie up the loose ends and to break
[1:25:24] this thing open so we can read any
[1:25:26] scripture
[1:25:26] and see the full magnitude of what it
[1:25:28] means for our day
[1:25:30] luther couldn't do what we do and now
[1:25:31] wesley can do what we do and now the
[1:25:33] pentecostals could not do what we're
[1:25:34] doing now
[1:25:35] but now we have the fullness to receive
[1:25:38] verse 3 the instruction of wisdom so it
[1:25:41] means that wisdom
[1:25:42] can be instructed in the amplified to
[1:25:46] receive
[1:25:46] instruction and wise behavior
[1:25:50] so i want to now push all these message
[1:25:52] believers
[1:25:53] who can't behave this is foundational
[1:25:56] principles we're talking about to know
[1:25:57] wise behavior and the discipline
[1:26:01] of wise thoughtfulness that's what the
[1:26:04] bible says be
[1:26:05] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:26:09] so your mind have to change until your
[1:26:12] thinking changes your behaviors will not
[1:26:15] change
[1:26:15] so before we even go into proverbs 2 3
[1:26:19] 31 solomon is laying a context listen
[1:26:23] what will be said in new testament about
[1:26:25] be transformed by the renewal of your
[1:26:27] mind in other words the rebooting of
[1:26:29] your mind
[1:26:30] changing the lessons you may have
[1:26:32] learned in school or from your natural
[1:26:34] house
[1:26:34] to getting spiritual understanding
[1:26:36] spiritual wisdom
[1:26:37] spiritual knowledge not just in
[1:26:39] spiritual things
[1:26:40] but as peter would say all things
[1:26:42] between the life
[1:26:44] life and godliness marriage and
[1:26:46] godliness
[1:26:47] business and godliness how to pay your
[1:26:49] taxes and godliness
[1:26:50] how to save and god it is how to run a
[1:26:52] good business and godliness how to get
[1:26:54] promoted and good and godliness
[1:26:57] life and godliness anybody with me
[1:27:00] i hope this doesn't encourage you new
[1:27:01] tonight i'm pushing you
[1:27:03] to strive more there is no excuse
[1:27:06] i challenge you church you have to
[1:27:09] develop a discipline
[1:27:10] because this is bringing us back to
[1:27:12] being students of scripture
[1:27:14] god told joshua meditate on the word day
[1:27:18] and night it is not a suggestion
[1:27:22] can i say that one more time it's not a
[1:27:23] is that a recommendation
[1:27:26] it is a requirement your whole life will
[1:27:30] change
[1:27:31] when you see the power of how this world
[1:27:34] affects impacts influences changes your
[1:27:37] life
[1:27:41] i wrote down and i try and i just say my
[1:27:43] own personal testimony i know we're
[1:27:45] running all the time
[1:27:47] i think on sunday evening also i wrote
[1:27:50] on a piece of paper
[1:27:51] how much time per day i want to read the
[1:27:54] scripture
[1:27:55] how much time per day i want to read the
[1:27:57] prophet's message
[1:27:58] how much time per day i want to read and
[1:28:00] study things put into my job
[1:28:04] how much time per day is my personal
[1:28:06] time
[1:28:07] i wrote down how much time i want to
[1:28:08] sleep i remember how much time is family
[1:28:11] time
[1:28:11] because if you don't take control of
[1:28:13] your time other things will take control
[1:28:15] of your time
[1:28:16] you cannot meditate on the word day and
[1:28:18] night if you are not planning
[1:28:20] how you spend your time your time is not
[1:28:24] open
[1:28:24] to be optionally yo you're tossed to and
[1:28:27] fro you you
[1:28:28] don't know where you're gonna be this
[1:28:29] evening you're not sure how tomorrow
[1:28:30] look
[1:28:31] you have to take a level of control over
[1:28:34] the ship of your life
[1:28:38] am i challenging you am i pushing you
[1:28:41] the same diligence you want to cram for
[1:28:43] an exam
[1:28:44] slow that down and be diligent to learn
[1:28:47] it become a master of your work
[1:28:48] become a master of scripture have a
[1:28:50] discipline i wrote
[1:28:51] how much time i want to spend praying to
[1:28:54] because if you don't plan for prayer it
[1:28:55] will
[1:28:56] it time will not create itself
[1:28:59] anybody with me
[1:29:04] could you take some more verse 3 to
[1:29:07] receive the instruction of wisdom
[1:29:10] justice and judgment and equity
[1:29:13] listen to the amplified of that to
[1:29:15] receive instruction and wise behavior
[1:29:17] and the discipline of wise
[1:29:20] thoughtfulness
[1:29:21] righteousness justice and integrity
[1:29:28] verse 4 to give certainty to the simple
[1:29:33] listen to the amplified that prudence
[1:29:35] good judgment
[1:29:36] asked you common sense so you see
[1:29:38] solomon interested in common sense
[1:29:41] you know what he's saying in this
[1:29:42] engineering commercial not so common
[1:29:45] so the reason the answer to common sense
[1:29:48] being not so common is
[1:29:49] scripture you he said these proverbs
[1:29:53] are to help solve that issue
[1:29:57] listen to verse five after trying to
[1:29:59] speak i want to bring so close
[1:30:00] already gracious we continue along this
[1:30:02] being
[1:30:04] a study of solomon part two listen to
[1:30:07] verse five a wise man will hear and will
[1:30:09] increase learning
[1:30:11] and a man of understanding shall attain
[1:30:14] unto wise counsels
[1:30:19] to understand a proverb and the
[1:30:21] interpretation the words of the wise and
[1:30:24] their dark sings
[1:30:27] verse seven the fear of the law is the
[1:30:30] beginning of knowledge
[1:30:31] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[1:30:35] so i in a call and people fooling them
[1:30:38] solomon the wisest man who ever lived
[1:30:41] describing the attributes of a fool and
[1:30:43] a fool is someone who despised wisdom
[1:30:46] and instruction
[1:30:47] so i take a position friends i say you
[1:30:49] could ask brother of it
[1:30:51] every time i do a bible study i still
[1:30:53] believe it but i feel
[1:30:54] every time i do more i feel i know less
[1:30:58] the more i read is the less i realize i
[1:31:01] know
[1:31:03] and it's a perspective because you
[1:31:05] realize how vast god is
[1:31:07] how big god is how powerful god is
[1:31:10] and it takes something for you to
[1:31:12] realize as well that you have to
[1:31:14] always be learning i have met too many
[1:31:16] people in the message who feel they
[1:31:18] reach somewhere
[1:31:22] but when you read this that there's no
[1:31:24] place for reaching nowhere
[1:31:27] solomon is king and say i arrange
[1:31:28] nowhere i don't know where i do i don't
[1:31:30] know how to go and go to come out
[1:31:32] moses reaching funny but i said i don't
[1:31:34] know i don't know
[1:31:38] and outside of the environment of the
[1:31:40] pillar of fire he would not have spoken
[1:31:42] that way but once he came into presence
[1:31:46] presence highlighted how much he did not
[1:31:48] know
[1:31:50] isaiah we talked about this isaiah
[1:31:53] warned to them war until you warned to
[1:31:56] you
[1:31:56] and when he come into presence he said
[1:31:58] why is me
[1:32:00] i want to challenge us tonight because
[1:32:02] we're in presence tonight once we're
[1:32:03] around the world of god we in presence
[1:32:06] and i said highlight a little look at my
[1:32:08] life again i can do better
[1:32:10] that's what i want to encourage us with
[1:32:11] tonight i can raise above my depression
[1:32:14] i can raise above my frustration i can
[1:32:16] raise above my despair
[1:32:18] i can raise above my opposition and the
[1:32:20] obstacles any challenges
[1:32:24] because challenges will come there must
[1:32:26] come that's life
[1:32:28] there's no life without challenges that
[1:32:30] is what makes life life
[1:32:31] but how you rise above it it's what
[1:32:33] distinguishes you
[1:32:35] can the church say amen hallelujah
[1:32:38] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[1:32:40] knowledge but
[1:32:41] fool despised wisdom and instruction
[1:32:44] friends i have a lot more because i
[1:32:45] really want to get
[1:32:46] some principles out of the book of
[1:32:48] proverbs tonight
[1:32:49] uh well well in general but i don't need
[1:32:52] time tonight i just want to touch
[1:32:53] quickly from proverbs 3
[1:32:58] and familiar scripture
[1:33:01] but i think now more than ever we should
[1:33:04] be resting on this so
[1:33:06] problem stream we'll close out with this
[1:33:10] verse 5 trust in the lord with all thine
[1:33:13] hearts
[1:33:14] with all nine hearts i've said it before
[1:33:17] many people come and they bring stuff to
[1:33:19] the lord
[1:33:20] and they rest say you bring it at your
[1:33:22] altar and they say well lord

[1:33:49] and lean
[1:33:50] not unto their own understanding now i
[1:33:53] want you to
[1:33:54] pick to parallel this with solomon's
[1:33:56] prayer because someone
[1:33:58] in his prayer was saying i don't want to
[1:33:59] use my understanding which he had
[1:34:01] i don't want to use my wisdom which i
[1:34:03] have i don't i want to trust in you
[1:34:05] i like a child i don't know how to go
[1:34:07] out to come trust in the lord with all
[1:34:09] thine heart
[1:34:10] and lean not unto thine own
[1:34:12] understanding
[1:34:13] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[1:34:17] shall direct ipads and i'm challenging
[1:34:20] you church
[1:34:21] acknowledge him in all your ways
[1:34:24] give god credit i'll close with this i
[1:34:27] have some friends
[1:34:29] christian business friends and one of
[1:34:32] them blows my mind completely
[1:34:34] and he was sharing with me that in the
[1:34:36] midst of this pandemic
[1:34:38] it has been his best year of doing
[1:34:41] business
[1:34:41] and he said to me isaac the reason that
[1:34:44] is is because
[1:34:45] i pray for every employee
[1:34:48] i pray for managers i pray for these
[1:34:51] stores i pray
[1:34:52] i bring it to god i have got to have
[1:34:54] been choose the product i have got
[1:34:55] and i say how many of us try to involve
[1:34:59] god in our decisions
[1:35:01] and he is bold enough he doesn't know
[1:35:04] the message
[1:35:05] but he's bold enough to tell anybody he
[1:35:07] meets everything i have you see
[1:35:09] what you've seen around me i do it or
[1:35:10] not it was a lord
[1:35:13] and i say look how he has tapped into a
[1:35:15] principle
[1:35:16] and we who are in a message who are
[1:35:18] supposed to have access to the
[1:35:20] fullness of the world and he fools every
[1:35:22] truth we want to hide in his shadow
[1:35:24] and and we are afraid to have a
[1:35:25] testimony you see that word testimony
[1:35:28] remember david's charge to solomon keep
[1:35:30] his testimonies
[1:35:32] are you keeping your testimony in this
[1:35:34] pandemic
[1:35:36] i want to challenge you to keep your
[1:35:38] testimony your testimony as the sun
[1:35:40] your testimony as a daughter your
[1:35:42] testimony as a father your testimony as
[1:35:44] a mother
[1:35:45] most importantly your testimony as a
[1:35:47] christian
[1:35:48] and a christian is not church going i'm
[1:35:50] talking about christ like
[1:35:52] that when people see you they see jesus
[1:35:54] when they see you they are inspired
[1:35:56] when they see you they are drawn to him
[1:35:58] not drawn to you not drawn to the church
[1:36:00] drawn to him there's something about you
[1:36:02] because you are keeping your testimony
[1:36:05] so may the lord bless you tonight can we
