as we read it in Jesus name we ask it in amen and amen God bless you and welcome praise God tonight if I have your Bibles like get aun to Genesis Chapter 18 and Ezekiel chapter 9 Genesis 18 we want to read from verse 14 to 21 and Ezekiel 9 we want to read 1 to1 praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus Genesis 18:14 says is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son and Sarah denied saying I laugh not but she was afraid he said said NE but thou did laugh and the men Rose from den and looked towards Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him and he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he had spoken of him and the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and gomorah is great and because their sin is Grievious I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and if not I they will know Ezekiel chapter 9 reading verse one he cried also in my ear with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with a destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lie towards the North and every man has Slaughter weapon in his hand and one among them was clothed with linen with a rightous incor by side and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen Altar and the glory of the god of Israel was gone up from the Cherub where upon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers incor by his sight and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young with Maids little children women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went and fought and slew in the city came to pass while they were slaying them I was left and I fell upon my face and cried and say ah Lord God will thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy point out of thy Fury upon Jerusalem then said he unto me the iniquity of the House of Israel and Judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the City full of perverseness for they say the Lord had forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not as for me also mine eyes shall not spear neither will I have pity but I will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkor by his side reported the matter saying I have done as thou Hast commanded me let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord and I pray that your presence would come upon it and speak to us as we wait on you in Jesus name we ask it amen amen and amen God bless you may have a seat now Ezekiel to come to Ezekiel 9 we have Ezekiel 8 I wouldn't read all of it but Ezekiel was talking about as I sat in my house and the Elders of Judah sat before me the hand of the Lord fell upon me and then he said that the spirit Lifted Me Up Between Heaven and Earth and brought me to the visions of God to Jerusalem to D the inner gate that look at to was the north where there was a seat the Bible call it of the image of jealousy which provoketh a jealousy and behold the glory of God of Israel was dear according to the vision I saw it in plain so this is Ezekiel being transported to see something that God wanted to see and this is verse five here then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now towards the north so I lifted up my eyes towards the North and behold northward at the Gate of the alter this image of jealousy in the entry he said furthermore son of man seest thou what they do even the great Abominations that the house of there God people here now that the house of Israel committed here and I I should go far off from My Sanctuary but turn the yet again thou shall see greater Abominations he brought me to the door of the Court when I looked Behold a hole in the wall he says son of me son of man dig now in the wall when I had dig in a wall Behold a door he said go in Behold The Wicked Abominations that they do dear I went in Saw behold every form of creeping things abominable beasts all the idols of the House of Israel portrayed upon on the wall round about and there stood 70 men of the Ancients that is where that the let's start at the ancient in the church 70 men of the ancient of the House of Israel in the midst of them stood and he identify a name here jazia the son of shapan which every man with sensor in his hand thck cloud of incels went up then he said unto me son of man hast thou seen what the Ancients of the House of Israel do in in the dark every man in the chamber of his imagery for they say the Lord seeth us not the Lord had forsaken the Earth he said unto me turn yet again and thou shal see greater Abominations so God showing him room after room after room then he brought me to the door of the Gate of the Lord's House which was towards the North and there sat woman weeping for tamuz not a god another man another Pastor another Minister weeping for tamuz and then said he unto meast thou seen this oh son of man turn the yet again and thou shalt see greater Abomination than these and he brought me into the inner Court of the Lord's House and behold at the door of the Temple of the Lord between the porch and the altar with 5 and 20 men with their backs towards the Temple of the Lord and their faces towards the east and they worshiped the son towards the east then he said unto me hast thou seen this oh son of man is it a lighting to the house of Judah that they commit the Abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and returned to provoke me to anger and they put the branch to their nose therefore will I deal in Fury my eyes shall not spear neither will I have pity and thou they and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice yet will I not hear them them this is the backdrop of Ezekiel chapter 9 cause them that have charge over the city to draw near every man with his joint destroy weapon in his hand and then God called for that one with the among them with the rightous incor by his side that Stood Beside the brisen altar there's an altar in heaven that's why there's an altar in Earth Stood Beside the brisen alter isn't that something tonight oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I have a title tonight the time of invest investigative judgment and have an inspiration those who sigh and cry but brand he said we are living in the time of this investigating Judgment of God I believe we are right in the day of it we don't want to be radical we don't want to be fanatical we just want to approach it as SE as the Bible would speak it here praise the Lord now in doing this we hear so much people talk about the mark of the beast it is a long time what is it who does it who going to have it what is going to do to them could it harm you is there any harm to it we want to find out from the word of God if there's a mark of the be spoke of the Bible and the next thing what age will it pertain to who will be the people that will have it what would you do could you have it and not know it and so forth those questions like that and to the best of my knowledge this would be one of the most vital two subjects I could think of in the Bible the mark of the beast and the Seal of God now Revelation 149 says and the third Angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worshiped the Beast and His Image and receive his Mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation he shall he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of the torment ascended forever and ever they shall have no rest day nor night who worship the Beast and His Image whosoever receive the Mark or his name here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the Commandments of God and the faith of Jesus I Heard a Voice of Heaven s unto me right blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from hence forth y say the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their Works to follow them and I looked and behold a white cloud and behold upon the cloud Sat one like the son of man having his head a Golden Crown and his hand a sharp sickle and another angel came from the temple crying with a lord voice to him that sat in the cloud said trust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap for the Harvest of the earth is ripe and he had sat in the cloud trusting his sickle on the Earth and the Earth was reaped so understand this Sunday was a reminder and a warning that we are actually in the end times and sometime we could get little dull cold ordinary flat without an awareness and a consciousness of how far down the road we are the prophet came at the end of Lisa age not at the beginning at the end so in other words there are no more ages left there's only one age that God placed there bright age which is something Supernatural that the devil know nothing about that so you have been called out of laia into this bright age isn't that right so here the prophet now this is the third Angel's message to the world Hallelujah and you know what the third Angel's message is going forth now in this day this is the flying of the third Angel's message if you are a Bible reader there are three words that follow it World War One second one World War II and we know what next World War I the Earth is groaning crying for the day of sweet release when Jesus shall come back to earth again sin and sorrow pain and death of this Dark World shall cease and the Glorious reign with Jesus A Thousand Years of Peace the Bible said they ruled and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years a millennium this third Angel's message just before the coming of the Lord when the seal and Mack was put on so he is saying the third Angel's message brings on this sealing Mark and there's going to be a great Roundup now we in the Caribbean here don't know that round up that's Western terminology so he's describing what it is around up out in the west when we go out I I used to I have since was a boy go up for the spring round up for the fall round up go in the mountains and run the cattle down and after we get all the cattle we can find out from every place then we cut out the ones that doesn't belong to us because ours packs are brand and they are branded did anybody ever see a cattle branded did anybody ever see them brand a cattle it's quite a thing to watch them brand cattle I used to feel sorry for the cow it's a awful sickening mess when you start branding heating The Branding Iron used to be my job pack the iron lay it on the young ster laying there his feet tied and that the brand on him and the hair and the meat frying and throw tow over him to turn him loose you talk about going he really goes you know but he's M hear this one yeah and that's the way God does us you have to get down to the Altar and get hog tied once in a while does the message know about this brother George HW tied once in a while but brother when the Holy Spirit ever put a brand on you you may do some running and screaming but you are marked oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God they message need you know a branding a marking has to have it that's right you are dear and when the boss comes by he knows where you belong but that stray ying that fellow that's condemned to be turned back among the rustics now is The Branding time now it's going there's only going to be two riders in this that's going to be God and Satan Satan will take his and God will take his tonight we are seeing who's going to wear Satan's brand and tomorrow night he talking about the next night we're going to see who's wearing God's brand according to the word hallelujah Revelation 15 1-2 and I saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them was filled up the wrath of God and I saw as it were the sea of glass mingle with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast over his image over his Mark over the number of his name stand on a sea of glass having HS of God rians 161 and2 I heard a great voice out the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of wrath of God upon the Earth regard how much people pray fast they could have 40-day fast this is what God say he's going to do nothing is stopping what going to happen right now we are in the end times we are in the realm where prophecies hanging up judgment over the entire world hallelujah what brother brandham came to do is brought a way of Escape before judgment this prophecy hitting the entire world this prophecy hitting families churches Nations the entire world this prophecy going to hit praise the name of the Lord hallelujah the first watch I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth and the first went and poured his V upon the Earth and there fell a noisome and Grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worship His Image upon them that had the mark of the beast swords coming judgment coming Revelation 20 before and I saw Thrones and they sat they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that will beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years oh give the Lord some Praises so there are those who would bow to the Beast and the Beast system and there are those who will not praise God brother Bram you can't receive the mark of the beast and then worship Christ or be with him Hallelujah but whosoever shall worship the Beast or the image of the Beast will be tormented in the presence of God and in the presence of the only angels that is what the Lord says about it oh praise God watch there is to be a great shaking and Revival just before the closing of the Gentile dispensation do you understand that the Gentile have a time they call the times of the Gentiles or the end of the Gentiles pensation do you know the Gentiles don't have it on and on and on and on because before God could go back to the Jews you have to close off the Gentiles Hallelujah I saw the angel arise from the East having the Seal of the Living God and to see seal those Hallelujah out of this tribe and that tribe and that tribe they are going to be sealed how come they are going to be sealed and there's no sealing for the bride there's got to be a sealing for the Bride of Jesus Christ therefore the Holy Ghost praise God is to be poured out upon you you are going to be sealed this seal is guarantee from God oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah and right now we in the time of the investigating judgment where God want to know what you want what is your heart desire if you're signing and crying because he said put a mark upon those oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah you just want to be in church or you want to become the word you just want to be identified with the message or you want to become the message oh glory to God do with church now this bust churchianity way this bust groups Fellowship this bus who think the the most right and higher right and best right this bus all of that foolishness this boss man of the hour and who is the message Pope and who are more Revelation who more revelated this boss all of that because the riders coming oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah when that Elohim came down and take up some dust and appear to Abraham he said coming time of life is there anything for the Lord I come to bless you I come to reward you but I come to check out Sodom too because hearing some cries going on down there I come to see what going on down there people in the message they want a breakthrough they want Deliverance how much you want Deliverance how much you really want to breakthrough you say about your mouth you say about your head and your mind you really want it you're getting desperate you're hunger and S after righteousness you want to get out your stinking self or you just playing games oh praise the I come I come I want to check it out I come to investigate okay give the Lord we know the story Abraham stood his ground and said there's 50 would you destroy Sodom if there is 40 will you destroy Sodom Abraham pumping Hallelujah talking he interceded because he said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to do I'm about to send judgment and judgment begins at the house of God oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah I'm about to do it and I given a word before it is done Oh Glory to God and if you notice when that incor rer when he was finished he said he reported and said it is done as thou Hast commanded me oh give the Lord some Praises that mean every one of us crying and sighing they got marked they got branded you got to be branded not by some church brand but by the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord I shout you have no time to waste you have no time to gossip you have no time to gossip and talk about this one and that one praise God you have time to seek the Lord to get this Mark upon you oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah there is to be a great shaking and a re Revival just before the closing of the Gentile dispensation and that Revival let me see what that Revival is that is a 7 tunder Revival that is the bright Revival we're not talking about what the Revival the the Seven Seas what the prophet had we talking about what the bride will have because the bride will be the final voice to the final age she will be the voice of God in the last days oh give the Lord a shout of God give the Lord some Praises Elijah and now Elisha oh the spirit of Elijah do rest upon Elisha that bride will be Anointed with that Spirit of Elijah oh give the Lord some shout Ms Jesus Christ with a double portion of the spirit with Dynamics to the mechanics there's to be a great shaking and a Revival just before the closing of the Gentile dispensation before the Jews pick it up again remember the Gentiles are only limited amount of time of Grace Lord the Bible said they would trut Down the Walls of Jerusalem Jesus said until the Gentile dispensation be finished it's got a definite set time to finish what if is the end this year what is next year we don't know I don't know I have no date R 138 says and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him all professors scientists businessmen billionair poor people Wicked people everybody will worship except whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slam from the function of the world so this message come to get those names this message come to get that Pride oh praise the name of the Lord Revelation 13:13 says and he do great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and brother Ram referred to that he does great wonders to make fire come from Heaven the atomic bomb hydrogen smart intelligent nation and so forth deceiving the nation by these things he deceived them that dwell on the Earth by means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying unto them dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by sword and that live and he give power to give and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as should not worship the Beast of should be killed remember what I said before that Satan have never given up of wanting to be worshiped he's never given on that that was that is sealed in his heart he told Jesus Bow Down and Worship me and all these I will give you so he that objective he had in heaven is still in his heart that is why he have to have a Superman you have to have the Antichrist man you have have some man that he could step into and have the whole world connected to worship oh praise the name of the Lord Brother Bram this United States will come to a time that church and state will unite together Protestant and Catholic would thr their things to fight communism and it's exactly playing it the hands of what God Said right here and you Protestants Lan y sng asleep reading love magazine story instead of your Bible out gathering around somewhere to some kind of party instead of a prayer meeting somewhere fussing at one another with little old Petty things that don't matter much examine what you're fussing about you know what does it matter how much does it matter somebody boun on your plant and you you can't find your book no food in the house because the wife cook on time you ought to be on your knees somewhere this what about to read to you blow my mind because seen the type the type is in Daniel Daniel had become a great man and before King Nebuchadnezzar and Baza and so forth when he become a great man what much King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold and set it up in the field and said everybody would have to B that image that's the type did you ever notice the innocence of it who that image was made of it was Daniel so he made an image of Daniel for Daniel and the boys to worship if Daniel was some of these message he feel good and proud know look at mean the king the king coming in the message look you have a picture of me it was Daniel the image of a man didn't he say the spirit of the Gods and as they today got three or four them the spirit of the god lived in him and they made an image to Daniel and said all that won bow to that image will be thrown in the fiery furnace same thing that's when the Press come that's when the boycott come that's when the pressure coming on the church because a image will be presented a system will be presented that will have to be rejected so right now our only job is to get oil get marked get sealed get placed get ready words get ready and stay ready oh give the Lord some Praises do you understand that but the Bible said his wife had made said ready it doesn't matter when he coming you know is as long as you get ready for when he comes it doesn't matter when he comes he could come tomorrow he could come next week next month next day doesn't matter when he comes you know but if he comes you're not ready you're messed up you waste time you waste time coming to the church 40 years wasting time you notice Daniel off the scene at that time get what I mean and ever who would not bow to that image would be cut to Pieces thrown into the lion's den burnt into the firment fiery furnace a punishment that is the way the Gentile dispensation begin with a pagan form of religious worship with a persecution to make them about it and the Bible predicts it will end that same way a holy man Jesus Christ an image to him to worship and so forth right now look I want you to notice something how did the Babylonian Kingdom breakup one night they were got the holy vessels of God begin to drink and have a big time bunch of woman concubines dancing reing and handwriting coming the world many many teing upass and they went and got their Chans their smart men the luk church members none of them could read it but there was a man there who could read unknown tongues could interpret it and it was your F ways in the balance and F wanting we know that right he said that is the way here we go she is going out now so in other words she was showing that the interpretation of the writing of the wall was closing off the Babylonian system and that holy ghost power that interpret the writing on the wall will be back in the church he said that's the way she's going out now with the power of the Holy Ghost on the people who is filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost who has power and signs and wonders there goes the Gentile Church there's the remnant The Remnant they walk around the books and tapes oh give the Lord some praises the remnant is walking out with the power of God hallelujah National Force put the world councel in the world C churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride oh praise the name of the Lord National Force to put the churches in the work of the churches isn't that right all right watch that's how it come in that's how it goes out a bowing a forcing to a half hiden religion and God is stepping in The crucial hour and writing an unknown tongues and the man interpreted he could interpret he didn't know that language nobody has know it but he had the holy ghost that let interpret and that same Holy Ghost is in the church today you're going to find in a few minutes what the mark of the devil is and what the Seal of the devil is the mark of the beast whosoever speak against the Holy Ghost will never be forgiven him in this world or the world to come so you see God God have been letting things hang oh praise God because the Holy Ghost is coming to manifest itself all the warnings is there in the word so first God unveiled the word to call us out you couldn't stay in your Baptist Church your Catholic Church the word unveiled to you you a reached nowhere yet you know the unveiling of the word was to get you out when you come out then he has more to unveil to get you in just as Redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into so people come into the message but they haven't got into what they're supposed to get into Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God as I was standing some Bren divine revelation mixure you humble because it is God revealing himself to you it is not your study it's not your learning it's the grace of God so then if you want more you keep humble and God gave more Revelation Revelation is God's sovereignity go Revelation is God's thoughts coming to you so even though I'm speaking the word that I know I'm not revealing the word to you the word could come out but the Holy Spirit have to reveal it to you and when it drop into your system that's a revelation that's the rock Jesus talk about Upon This Rock I'll build my church Oh Glory to God so we can speak a thousand words and one word becomes a rock Revelation that's that that what the church built on the built the church not built upon all the other 99 in your head it builts upon the rock inside your heart that is what the devil can't touch that is what the devil cannot overthrow that is what the devil can't defeat what is inside of you so you already put the gene which is the potential inside of you and you are the thought Gene coming to connect with your word oh give the Lord a shout you understand there's a connection with what's inside of you to what's coming to you the gene thought is inside of you and the word coming hit in that Jean thought Oh Glory to God because you your thought going to be expressed by the word that's why your name is in the book that's why when we preaching you could hear your name you could catch a revelation of the word and you hear your own name and that cause you to react a certain way oh give the Lord I shout you get freed up oh God grace coming to you praise God to unfold your name to you hallelujah hallelujah watch the first church what they done watch out about the second Church you should seal yourself what you could seal yourself out of the kingdom of God and into the devil where there is no forgiveness in this world nor the world to come be careful he says so be TR he say so be careful walk reverently be careful what you do for you do not know what will take place you are only saved when you are truly baptized with God's spirit by the Holy Ghost United with him in the power of Resurrection going forth with signs and wonders following that Spirit wherever it goes he said this bride will write another book of Acts if that original tree puts forth another original Branch because All Through the Ages was branches that was grafted in so that's why you get no true pretention of Christ Baptist grafting Methodist everybody grafted in Pentecostal grafting but that tree is pushing up amen and when that tree put forth an original Branch it must have the original Fruit it must have a people with signs one of the Miracles it must have another day of Pentecost it must another Acts 2 acts 5 praise God got to write another book of Acts before the coming of the lord we can't leave here dry we can't leave here dead we can't leave our people not delivered we can't leave here in blind St blind death death it can't be that that's why he said there will be a church Glory with Jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God a church that he could be proud of Amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so therefore in Genesis God came down to Abraham praise God he he was he come like God come down now and investigating you want and you know I remember I was hungering for God 19 was 19 um 74 hunging for God ending there December hungry for God hungry for God I want to know and I remember praying Lord I don't know who you are could you reveal yourself to me this year at 1975 is when I get baptized so there was a cry inside of me calling for something that's when I get to meet the message I was calling for a reality and God check that out and say yes this brother serious so when I got my mother told me I cannot go to that that church that was obliquely opposite me you know where house where my house is you she said no no no he Catholic can't I hear noise and people shouting and in message and I say I have to get back to this and God arranged it that I apply and I get to permission to go pter Spain to go John joh Johnson Technical Institute to do electrical engineering technician and and that pulled me away from South that pulled me into the north away from parents everybody and that is how I end up with the gospel so God know what he's doing when he separate you to get you aside to deal with you God have to do that sometime you know separat you because you're tied up you Tangled Up nothing in Jesus you're Tangled Up In organizing and God have to cut this off and cut that off to get you a sight to deal with you glory to God hallelujah praise God so God want to know if you want him do you want me who is me the word oh give the Lord I shout could you imagine investigating judgment in this message pastors the own Revelation the own inspiration by the kangi and God is still asking do you want me the word you're reading the spok word books you're not seeing what in the spoke word books in the church and you're still accepting that if you believe a lie accept a lie you are you are part of that whole thing you know you can't see a lie and keep staying with it you know you are supporting something that is false that is wrong he said be separated amen and come out from among them my people you can't see things off the word and stay you have to run for your life oh give the Lord a shout God can't bless lot and his family and Sodom he had to get them out because judgment is about set to get Sodom out get get toward s we we don't know if God leave a space of half an hour to see all people W the word giving God grace all the 70s the 880s just the word because he have his time we can accelerate God's clock because over the years so much of people get exposed and hypocrites and all kind of characters and God just take them off the scene so because God come and filtering notice the pyramid white at the bottom you know look at it it broad you know plenty people at the bottom there you know but as it go up it narrows it Narrows that's what happened right now it have to be home owned shaped to be fitted into God's program you have to be willing go in forceing you you want to stay as you are God will leave you as you are if you want to be shaped will dou be made perfect Hallelujah you have to want that you have to hunger for that be therefore for perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect so therefore the investigating judgment is to investigate to see what you want and sometime God give people what their heart is a brother say all the time in his heart he want to hear about the Trump so when his brother start about the Trump he leave the church because he he want to follow Trump next brother ahead voice shout voice Trump he ahead I said brother I trying to catch up trying to catch up as fast as I can they ahead God has give people to what they heart to the people watch outside and they say everybody have a kingu in front of them who come they have pillar Fire by Night cloud cloud by day and they want a man God with them but they want a man and and Samuel God what money from you God say Samuel they reject you it's me they want a man give them a man and that's what all day give them somebody just like them Soul a compromising man a man are will start off okay and then things will go off key because my God Isaac Shar a quote I tell he must for a quote to me but brandham shared something was so powerful and Isaac Shar the C on ministers that Satan have I do not have the exact wording of it but it comes like this the effect of it is like this Satan have level of access to the councils of God so he knew that God wanted a king he knew that a king was coming so Satan set it up for they to desire to get one in advance of the one that was supposed to be which was David so when you look at it closer he was second in command in heaven he wasn't called Satan he was Luc Lucifer so he had a lot of PR a lot of sealed stuff and and and and mystery information so when he drop down on the earth he have things I tell brother George know when them them guys who off the word hit the mother Lord of of interpretation and Revelation Satan have lots of stuff to give them you know when you think they give up on this is a more coming you know from the pit and bubbling up bubbling up is it coming from up you know com from up that way they could come with I am the holy ghost that way come with all kind of cuckoo Revelation just pop on the pit of Hell just bubbling up bubbling up they have to do that you know because Satan have Insight a Lon Spirit come and say permission please let me drop on them 400 prophets one Spirit hitting 400 of them to cause them to to to break the word a line spirit I like how sometime you say all have stand up out one time you said they cast them in groups all who have had trouble stand yeah because you sometime you see Devils on this side calling for help and support from the other side and if they get support they going you know so he said all you have this stand up and then bam send them all them one time but we want to come back to that call them spirit and slam them out no negotiation what a church what a church I am living for this thing I am fighting for this thing I am expecting this thing there will be a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle Oh Glory to God Amen the six seal but BR we find those beasts how they rote each other one sent out with this ministry in political power United religious power political power together we find out another Age come along enemy sent out the Antichrist under the name of religion under the name of Christ watch watch that's the Antichrist is not Russia the Antichrist is so close like Christianity until the Bible said will fool everything that wasn't predestinated the Bible said in the last days everything that wasn't predestinated the elect watch now anybody take that word and run it back to imagine and see what it means it says the elected the predestinated it will fool every one of them whose names were not written in the L Book of Life from the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain here we go the names were put on the book he is standing in the Holy place tonight in glory as an intercessor making intercessions for every one of those Souls whose name is on that book nobody knows that name but him he's the one that got the book in his hand he knows when that last one comes in then the incess days and over prop talk about when the last name is redeemed not saved redeemed the book is closed not one more person to be saved okay he is the kinsman redeemer comes forth now to receive his own oh my that ought to set every Christian to search in himself listen holding his hand before God and say cleanse me oh god look into my life let me see where my bad parts is let me get it out of the way right quick if the righteous be scarcely saved where will the Sinner and the ungodly appear it is checking up time he said and you would place this if you want it in the word he said this is the time from six years of Investigation judgment that is right we will get on the trumpets when we come to that wherever the Lord provides or vials we will find out that is an investigated judgment just before the Wes went fought to see if that is true oh praise the name of the Lord the one God that is true how sincere people are the one God they love the church my and one scripture you say my people like it so they know things of of of key you know but they like it so oh praise God because they oh my they caught up they caught up they caught up watch Abraham and his signs some man come to me one time Minister but the Fred brother brandham do you mean to tell me you think that that one that eat that man that stood there eating Cal and cornbread and milk that was God I said certainly he ought to know he said he was Elohim you see he come down to make an investigation as he is now in investigation judgment to see who is believers hallelujah hallelujah so now a hypocrite can't make the cut because somebody had and us is doing the investigation remember it's not B investigating I do have that qualification sorry I do have that calling he come down to look in the people's heart to investigate just like the inor writer come to investigate those who and cry so somebody can't be in Abomination andry for Abomination you got to be out of that so you have to be in a position to cry out because you see the need you want to get a breakthrough don't even think about you alone you have a family you have loved ones you're dying for them you're pressing for them you're paining for them you're groaning for them because this comeing to slay utterly young and old male and feem little children the only thing that they can't respecting is the mark no question who's your pastor and not the question what church you go to and how long you was going there are you a deacon are you an elder are you a minister they not the question me asking put a mark upon those upon those who know Mysteries that's a lie if anybody preach that Liars upon those who under this pastor here next liar again upon those who press play only put a mark upon them who press and play they're preaching at all just press just press play deceiving the people this hear is the word put a mark upon them that something had to hit you [Applause] to I have been blasting and fighting against entitlement laziness the sluggishness and I mean that because people are feel they really entitled don't even think about how old you and how long he is the men who was doing all kind of incense burning and in the secret society was the ancient ones you was the old heads in know when it say start he say start at my sanctuary and start at the old heads start at the ancient Men start at them who their long time and kill them does that song like the gospel God is a good God all the time yeah God is the word all the time that's why I keep saying people have a god of their imagination they make their own Gods they worship and Idols you know in this message they make up a God you know they take what butter B experiences and they have their own experiences and fit in it look read and they making their own mix shake it drink it and they go to go there a piece of cool in truth or a piece of marijuana they smoking and that's where they get head getting high all we have to be to do is to it's it's to it's to keep God's requirement you know and what the prophecies you know the Scribe and Pharisees interpreted word a certain way that the Messiah that come to them they any message they any scriptures and it take three wise men from from the East to to to to shake them up where is he King of the Jews people going where the market gos normal normal people just taking the Uber and the taxi and come with the bank and thing like that normal normal normal and these men come excited thinking everybody jumping up and worshiping and carrying Steven and everybody quiet well they shocked but because of their testimony and because of their not knowing normal to the society to say but long time where you supposed to be born again it's true boy supposed to have a 700 Revival yes it's supposed to have Holy Ghost and Dynamics oh yes Dynamic to the mechanics supposed to have a super Church a super race yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah don't we worship in the living Christ him move It In and Out Among Us oh he's supposed to have worship bring me word when you find him because right now um big glasses break I can't see so well so bring me word when you find them the angel had to tell them fellas bust it one time get out and as soon as they get out of that church environment in the message in the message that lack of an anointing Atmos and inspiration soon as they get out of that then they saw the star and they start to Rejoice with great joy back to the atmosphere again Most Holy Place most holy people all the books all the tapes de is a daal no vision no Revelation no worship sh no inspiration and they day 40 years dying oh praise God Lord help us hallelujah hallelujah he come to make investigation he's now investigation judgment to see who is Believers we have been hollering so much about it just investigate see who really is Believers and he will make himself manifest oh my oh my oh my what happened before Sadam God came down with some angels and they had an investigation judgment I heard the cry and it is so sinful so great I've come to find out whether is all together the truth or not watch the main man that St with Abraham could he earn his towards you look around a little bit notice what he's doing the same thing today it is investigating judgment why after a while the church when it can stay in that place and every seed has been brought to its spot they'll be gone they won't know what happened to them one will be going one way one will be going over to the pastor's house and one will be going there and the first thing you know they are not there for Enoch which was in tight God took him and he was found not come into front P House burn your horn not home he gone hallu he take off not we go on you can take the house then you can move in Hallelujah all right let me the here now all right there's only going to be two classes of people in the last days two classes everything come down to two classes both of them is going to wear a mark the mark of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit no Minister could break that no Pastor they could talk about Holy Ghost 24 hours to be lost they I break that that's still there and it changeing anytime soon the mark of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit without a Shadow of Doubt I preached that not long ago right here by the Holy Spirit help and the word of God and proved it that the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost put a mark put a seal put the Holy Ghost into the lives of the people no man could do that only God could do that Peter spoke the word but while Peter was speaking the word the Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard the word and they were filled with the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God give the Lord a shout tonight Hallelujah Peter wasn't in charge of the filling he was in charge of speaking the word of God oh hallelujah praise God grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption without the Holy Spirit you are not sealed but the Holy Spirit is God seal then all listen all that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit took the mark of the beast my God that's a big one you know that no SM no no SK milk at all you know all that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit what took on the mark of the beast that's why the foolish versions when they do catch yourself they go say give us ready short are ready to go ready for some oil Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory you should be glorying glory GL a long time to show God faith in your soul because the seed of circumcision come as a confirmation of the faith that Abraham had while yet uncircumcised the circumcision come as a confirmation of the faith that that man have oh give the Lord some Praises you have to do something to honor God you have to do something to show God you believe him you trust him you have confidence in him and he come and confirm by filling you with his Spirit a confirmation of the righteousness of the faith that was displayed inside of you oh give the Lord I shout in the house all I'll read it again that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit took on the mark of the beast and the mark of the beast is the mark of apostasy which is rejecting the Holy Ghost here we go then when the Year of Jubilee or the blast comes prophecy you mean they going to be a jubilee Year may it start tonight but some year if it's not 2024 but 225 some year when the Year of Jubilee or the blast comes the people of God are receiving Holy Spirit when Jubilee year 50 Pentecost release what's the Jubilee God's grace to the people you're slaven you're under subjection to demon powers but God provide a window of Grace by providing in a jubilee year for you to hear the trumpet of the gospel and to go free with a spirit release oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God not word release not my message but Spirit release release on the inside Oh Glory to God release some condemnation Hallelujah release from your past release from your fears release from your inhibitions when the Year of Jubilee or the blast comes the people people are receiving the Holy Spirit and you deliberately willfully turn it down God has no more he is not under any obligation to ever speak to you no more then you'll be marked off all the old types of the Old Testament only tight and shadowed of the new to reject Christ to turn him down he's knock at your door you are the danger line of being bored through the air Faith come by hearing hearing the word of God and and God will put a blind over your ears that you will never be able to understand no more you will do no more than criticize the gospel as long as you live and die be lost forever while it is Jubilee time while the doors are open did you realize that this same is B of spirit Oh Praise godo I'm trying to hit this home stretch here in the last days there going to be two kind of people one of them going to have the seal one mark of the beast then he said the Seal of God is the Holy Ghost then without the Holy Ghost is the mark of the beast and the Bible said the two spirits will be so close together it will deceive the very elected if it were possible so no matter who you are woman man boy girl whoever you are Christian not Christian if you just believe with your whole heart and do this much tonight just to let God know that you are sincere look you say I'm a Pentecostal you say I'm this whatever you are I profess the dance in the spirit but brother Bram I as long as we had that we had it you haven't if you believe me to be God's Prophet you listen to my words that's a deception in this day didn't the Bible said it'll be so close we see the very elected possible the elected down to the soul but if you dance in the spirit still with the things of the world there's something wrong if you speak with tongues I can speak with tongues I'm an angel and still not be saved I can do all the emotions I can have faith I can preach the gospel I can give all my G ofy the poor I can carry the word in missions Fields I am nothing listen to this inside of the inside your spirit breaks up when you die and we always talk about that so you're doctor lawyer businessman whatever it is you have a fancy car fancy house I used in pool and whatnot right when somebody dies all that qualifications and titles and reputation that breaks up you know so your spirit begin to break up and your soul come up after that which is the real you so if that soul is sinful that were hitting God you know that's why I'm to the person in the hospital you know she didn't want to reject the pastor trying to tell she about repentance I'm saved and saved and when her spirit had to break up and her soul start to come for she said I'm lost because the soul coming up now the human Spirit had to break up the soul coming forward I'm lost I'm lost then they give injection her she lost your spirit breaks up and you die it takes its flight but your soul lives look at yourself really are you a genuine Bible Christian full of the love of God remember the Bible said in the last days when this time take place a marking Angel went through the churches I want wonder if the mark angels went to Trinidad what that Mar angel will see I'm not trying to neg any church you know I talk about including this church every church is no Markel I with my brother to you but you need him to come here how you get Mark but the commission is to Mark those not mark them Mark those that sigh and cry is a hard condition a mark and Angel went to the churches went to the cities seal only those who s and cried for the Abomination that was done C is that right Ezekiel 9 we know that's truth the marking Angel went forward and put a mark on the head for it seal them then s cry after that come the slaughtering angels of the four corners of the Earth so I am seeing that God has allocated if I could see this with his permission and guidance a season that people will sigh and cry you must see that before the Judgment Angels begin to ride the slaughtering angels on their way in out of that Bunch had a man with incor writer that God commission put a mark because the question that Abram was asking God will you destroy the righteous or the wicked that was the that was the issue with Abraham you know because he know judgment coming to son he know investigation is going on he know that God Wrath and fury is towards that kind of filthy light living shall you destroy the righteous with the wicked and when he plead God dispat angel to get Lo out and inside of it there's an expression by itself Lot's wife lot's environment and lot's history of pitching his towards Sodom he may have be able to handle it not his family so sometime we make decisions and it cost the family because you might be able to handle it but we're not sure about the family so some decisions we make have secondary consequences be careful make wise decisions make guided decisions because your family could be at risk after that come the S angels on for of the earth which come right away we see come in Wars move right in that will kill the old o there was nothing they couldn't touch them that had that Mark is your heart so concerned about the Sinners and the way that the church and the people are doing till you can sigh and cry about it day or night if not I'm wondering did you notice something church member and you who claim to have the Holy Spirit he said don't seal listen he phrase it different now don't seal any of them but them that sigh and cry for the Abomination why is anybody so burdened about the world now and his conditions and this year exposes the selfishness of so-called message Believers the selfishness that they would even testify they would even witness they wouldn't give not spoken with book they would even tell anybody is like they and God Alone they they in a channel how did the gospel come to you is because somebody witnessed to you somebody witnessed to me that give me an opportunity who do you witness to who do you share the word with who do you get testimony to the easiest thing you could do is tell them get connected look the website go and listen for yourself that the least you could do some people can't even do that brother Bram I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist so what difference does it make not that constant burden for the loss that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul no matter how bad anyone ever treats you or anything don't never don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it will grieve the holy spirit away from you it certainly will praise the name of the Lord he says watch he says the conference we need tonight in America see here in Phoenix across the world everywhere is a conference music please of the oldfashioned pron of a place where we can get back to the place where Brotherly Love exist amen right now it doesn't right now that brother is a text some EX on brother love but Jesus bust he say if you love your own not doesn't the phy do that too come on now you big shirs you're following me you telling them that you to do better than the Pharisees they love their own too sadu like sadu Pharisee like Pharisee herodians like herodians and the disciples behav like the one you know thinging you said no you do better than that you talking about a place where love exists where the spirit of God can come into our hearts and make us so miserable for the things out there that's going on in the world do you know the SE angel said put a mark upon those who sigh cry for the Abomination while the investigation judgment is going on to see who is worthy to escape the rat the angel was to seal only those who cried and sighed for the Abomination my God hallelujah hallelujah praise God almost done if Einstein only had the spiritual application that he had the physical application he studied laws of light and so forth he could have told us something when I heard his message on the great Center somewhere into the skies ever contacted with that Center you could create Earth and do anything he said he's seen that you see the little pockets going to the air called sorer so forth he he said I better leave that alone hear them people go missing you don't hear from them they're standing there and they're not there that's the way the Rapture is going to be one of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a Celestial body and the hair and Bones left will be transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space taking home that and the Pentagon wondering about these lights and Mystic likes and everything else he said they don't worry children they going to pick you up on of these days don't worry what happened just before Sodom God came down with some angels and they had an investigating judgment he said I've heard a cry so sinful so great I've come down to find out where is all together truth you say why the church it can get to a spot I I'll skip that praise the name of the Lord all right all that was not sealed took the mark of the beast all that had not the spirit of God had the mark of the beast the Seal of God is the Holy Spirit the Bible says so every place in the scripture speaks of it is the mark of God it's the Seal of God begin to play something what BR the first thing you know the time will come when God will give a message and you'll be sealed in or out of the Kingdom my Lord jesusall he prophesied about this stone that Daniel saw the cap Stone they never put a Capstone on that pyramid it wasn't cut by man's hand it's God's hand that cut the stone you see it what did it do it hit the image right smacking his feet broke it to Pieces ground it to powder what happened at that time the coming of that stone up when the church the glory of the Rapture because it ended the Gentile dispensation God ended it up with the coming of that stone that Capstone ends the Gentile dispensation the prophet asks a question
