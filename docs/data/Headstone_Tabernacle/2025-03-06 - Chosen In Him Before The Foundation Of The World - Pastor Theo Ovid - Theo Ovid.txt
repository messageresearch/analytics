confirm it with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord God bless you and uh if you have your Bibles let see what's going on here like to turn to three portion of scriptures in John 1 we want to read verse 12-3 St John 15 1 verse verse 16 Ephesians 1 verse4 to 5 St John 1 reading 12 13 as many as receed him to them give he power to become the sons of God even to them which believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh know of the will of man but of God St John chapter 15 I want to read verse 16 ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordain you that you should go and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that whatsoever he shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you our last script is from Ephesians chapter 1 reading verse 4 and five according as the has chosen us chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will may God bless his word you may be seated praise God good to see all of you out here tonight it's always a blessing to be in the house of God and In God's Presence okay so tonight I have a title chosen in him before the foundation of the world chosen in him before the foundation of the world so God is not just randomly doing things God is deliberate in what he's doing he's deliberate in his objective and motive in what he wants to achieve his word as he declared it my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish what he sent forth to accomplish so this elect was chosen in him and predestinated to be conformed to the word image that's what you're PR Destin unto in other words this is more than coming to the church this is coming to church having knowing that there's an intelligence and a mind of God considering your own life and there's a purpose and objective behind your own life here on this Earth you're not just a random mishap or just happen and so on there's a purpose behind you being here amen praise the Lord amen let turn on all right let's see we go now but BR when Israel left Egypt they all believe in one's Prophet message they seen signs of God by Moses every one of them saw it that each saw come out of Egypt to the Red Sea baptizing into Moses each one saw the power of God strike him when he sang in the spirit when Miriam bit the Tambour each one of them every night eat fresh Heavenly Man Out of the Skies each of those drank of that spiritual Rock and there were two million people left Egypt how many made it to the promised land two two out of two ion and Jesus said they perish your fathers eat Mana in the wilderness for the space of 30 years and they are dead but oh Christians okay if Jesus come he said now there about 500 million Christians in the world tonight counting Catholic Protestant if Jesus would come in that Rapture according to what I've just said there' be 500 missing in the world tonight oh Christians let us buckle on the armor of God let us do all all we know how to serve him love him and wait for that great time there's not going to be great millions and multitudes come out a generation like somebody asked m a question but M the children of Believers are they going to going to heaven what he said no he said God have no grandchildren they have to get the Holy Ghost they have to get the same experience so you can say well because my mother is a preacher or my mother my mother is a saint or my father is a preacher or my father is a elder or Deacon I'm going in no you have to get your own experience so it's serious it's not man you are serving it's God it's not the Prime Minister trying to interview you it's God you have to meet are you with me here we go each day ends a 40-year period for somebody and each day so many is sealed away into the kingdom one day the last day will arrive that mean the sealing is going on tonight God is seeding people into the kingdom of God that's why he said grieve not the Holy Spirit until you by by which you are sealed into the kingdom of God God put in a seal upon you is that right then the prophet said this don't stop don't you stop don't rest day or night until that quickening power has brought you from the things of the world into the kingdom of God and you are truly are brought into the kingdom of God and quickened by the spirit of God how happy with tears of joy we should be on our knees day and night thanking God for what he has done oh praise the name of the Lord thanking God for what he has done oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God and then he begin to describe a story about bam and balac the King ask and and he talking about bam and Bam was not a Suiter he was a prophet of the Lord and that's the man who was asked to curse Israel and he said I can't only I could only speak what God put him my M and we end up blessing Israel isn't that right but bam was not a suit say was a prophet isn't that right and what we get we what and he said and the Lord was with them and every enemy that raised up before Israel was moved out of the way for God said he would send Hornets before them and would drive out the enemy as long as they walk in obedience to his command the job was never too big the amalekites the Giants of the day meant nothing to Israel though they were small man in stature but they were walking in dust say the Lord so when you're walking in dust say the Lord you could be Fearless no weapon form against a could Prosper God I'll be with you even in you no necromancy no funny business no witchcraft nothing could affect you because you're walking in dust sayth the Lord isn't that right praise God in Israel watch Moab is a type of the church they had slew some Kings and WR to the enemy Moab was a nation that served the same God that Israel serve so Moab in the message tro all under the prophet Moses isn't that right and the land of Moab was originally started with lot's Son by his own daughter now Israel was the the Seed of Abraham not of lot Israel come out of Isaac Jacob and Israel sprung out from the 12 tribes of Jacob later called Israel because he wrestled with the Lord isn't that right now every time that man made an organization the spirit of God left it never did return ask any historian he said when they organized God laid it on a shelf because they grow in members but never Awakening of the spirit never no more the numbers looking good but the spirit is poor is absent why because they cap God they cap God to their thing to their Doctrine to their interpretation to their Church they cap God right there and God will not be capped anytime they cap God he move on out oh give the Lord a shout isn't that right I want to get something Moab here was a type of such because they had organized Nation they had their own land and they had they had their own religion and they were moabites believe in Jehovah God they were organized group of people now they represent here we go Church natural Israel represent the spiritual church in his journey so now we know in this message have church natural and church spiritual Hallelujah Church natural and church spiritual in the churches in the groups in the fellowship I don't care how much you say this is God and this is the bride and speaking the bride he say Church natural Church spiritual Hallelujah are you ready and now we find always shout out always when these natural and spiritual spirits of churches and organizations meet there's always a clash yes so don't look for no Clash no Clash I a CL with nobody you know you're not you're not you're not in the real world he said always there is a clash anytime the spiritual natural meat has to have a clash it never failed to be so it always always clashes because we find there is a jealousy in this jealousy it causes caral comparison and impersonation when God does something for an individual everybody tries to copy what God did for that person it causes a competition and it makes canaly and once there's competition there's no cooporation amen people don't cooperate when they competing because they want to beat you they want to win you they want to fight you they want to press you and put you in a corner to say I am top you below I'm the head you are the tail amen there's no cooperation but the prophet said we have to get the unity of the spirit until we come to Unity of the faith and unity of the spirit have nothing to do with Doctrine and teaching it have to do with the quality of spirit in a human being to love God and to serve God and to demonstrate God and Jesus told his own disciples by this shall all men know that you're my disciples not by what you talk by how you love one another how you treat one another and you have to treat each other because you them in front of your eye and if you cannot treat your brother in front your eye right how you going to treat God who you still can't see is not right so you see it caus it comp competition it makes canal and then they cannot the other side get the spiritual results and they take it by political power or substitute something to upset the people's mind what for to draw disciples after themselves so the natural and spiritual C and Abel worship the same God they both built the same kind of altar they both worship the same God at the same church same altar but Cain by caral reasoning brought in the fruits of the land and thinking surely God will answer that but we know what Abel by faith which is by Revelation he just kill a lamb and God approved that oh praise the name of the Lord and that that fate of Abraham is what give him I call it Anthony say a hack that faith is what brought favor with God God make an approval and I approve that son that's revelation Oh Glory to God maybe Abel came was a better behaved person but Abel by Faith by Revelation Oh Glory to God and that's what the church is built upon not feelings not emotions not works the Faith Church is built upon Revelation somebody be backing 40 years walking here tonight and by Revelation something break upon them and they're free and you cannot explain what happened the last 40 years 40 years doesn't count your past doesn't count is what is revealed to you tonight oh give the Lord some praises Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it oh praise God you believe that that's the power of the word that's the power Revelation Jesus can't lie Jesus himself said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell can Prevail against it so if we see somebody fall down and flatten what Revelation did they have they had none whatsoever because he said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it and you have man who standing year in year out trial in trial out up the mountain down the valley they're still standing because they have a rock of Revelation and the devil can't take that out joob prove it oh give the Lord I shout though he slay me then I will trust him oh butam proved it when he lost his wife he lost his child Hallelujah he said the Lord Give the Lord take it away because a rock was inside his soul Oh Glory to God you lost this you lost that it doesn't change the faith that God put inside your soul hallelujah praise God but a man didn't come to make weak he come to make us strong he come to turn our us back to the faith of the fathers for you to overcome for you to speak positive Glory Hallelujah great to speak the things they need to speak man notice Abel by faith offer the more excellent sacrifice and the canal believer thought it was the works of his own hands and his fruits his beautiful offering he brought that God would recognize and made it and made a clash we find Abraham and lot had a clash Moses dayon and Kora had a clash is not right Kora was caral I want to raise up organization and and he said you take too much upon yourself the whole conation is Holy you you you are the only holy man we find out that b a lot of problems and when the caral and the spiritual meets there was always a clash when Judas and Jesus meet there was a clash and favor always brings a clash and that's why when Joseph was favored by the father and give that that coat of many colors and had all these dreams that had a CL with his brothers these the older brothers you know these the Big Brothers you know who supposed to be protecting that young man you know they tried to sell him and kill him because they had a problem with what was spiritual upon him and Joseph didn't couldn't help it Oh Glory there was a something inside of him he couldn't help it he couldn't help dreaming he couldn't help finding favor Oh Glory to God that's is how he was that favor they couldn't stop it he found favor in potifa house he found favor in the prison he found favor with Pharaoh he found pharoh right through Oh Glory to God a man that finds favor with god oh don't you want to be that kind of man a man that find favor with God that's the kind of way you want to live not you're not hallelujah praise the name of the Lord do you love him tonight all right just one more this's a backd drop I'm dropping here now now watch the natural always tried to have the spiritual but as in Jacob and Esau now when it comes to doing good works I believe Esau actually was a better man than Jacob in the sight of man so if you're judging with your eyes you say Jacob is my man no Esau is my man because he's a very nice guy you what I'm saying now he had take care of his daddy he was blind a prophet all the tried to do but yet Esau didn't think about that just being Canal work he thought he could get in by what he's done do something good for somebody which is all right but Jacob let we go his whole soul was to get that birth right that is what God recognized in him a spiritual where's the the Holy Ghost his whole soul is got a spiritual breakthrough his whole soul whether you have money or not car or not house or not land or not it doesn't matter what natural come his way he's hungering and thirsting glory to God even David said as the heart pant after the water broke so my soul thirst after the Living God he wasn't letting nothing quench his thirst you kick out whatever trying to tie you up mess you up cover it up you you rip that out your system and let it flow let it grow amen Jacob his whole soul was to get that birth right and that's what God recognized in him as spiritual notice it is always cause the natural to hate the spiritual never the other way around you will never get a spiritual man hating a natural man is always the natural man have the spirit of hate upon him so if somebody hat you let them continue hating you don't hate them back love your enemies do good to them praise God hallelujah don't hate them back Hallelujah love them back because they don't have love to love but you have love to love ask God to give you the love to love them back with you going beat them with love you Hallelujah would bust them with kindness Hallelujah and overow them with humility oh give the Lord some Praises let's go they even try to destroy the influence they try to destroy everything because it's nothing but jealousy it started from Cain prove it was jealousy is still the same today it proves it Satan because jealousy comes from Satan he's the author of that jealousy comes from Satan and when and and pray to you know that way devil had I I will sit in the con in nor I will be like the most high and I and I and I and I and I when you finish the ey and I the ey and I man Pride take him overthrow him and he cause other angels to stumble and fumble and follow him oh praise God you see oh God woo God tell bam don't curse them don't do that don't do that he come and pray again because he get a bigger offer get some more money say pray on that but when you see that money thing I go and pray again you know go say go and people want to know if God changed his mind God Chang his mind B I'm gone so God said no no no no no then God said go go yes go and when he open mouth blessings that to come out God flip him over and instead of curse come out because he getting paid to curse blessings that to come out of his mouth oh praise and the question was does God change his mind about his word I want to I want to rephrase that to you does God change his mind about you that is where I want to go to tonight that God doesn't change his mind about you you went through hell you went through this you went through that but God have a purpose behind you and God tonight is not going to change his mind about what he purpose he said my my word is not going to come back empty I have a mission with my word I have a purpose behind sending my word I want to send for you I sent for you you didn't chose me oh let's preach tonight I have chosen you oh it wasn't your choice Hallelujah you wasn't in this business when I was doing this choosing thing okay the Lord I shout you said I am weak I am poor I am back I am this I am that I fell I fail I am not talking about you I am talking about him it's not your choice it's his choice oh give the Lord go out here shout in the house tonight I'm not talking about what you feel or what you think and what you believe I'm talking about his choosing he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you I chosen you as you are I chose you with your weakness I chose you with your struggles I choose you with your battles I chose it with your failures I chose you for what Oh Glory to God what you have done what you are doing and what you will do and I still chose you and I want to tell you when I chose you I chose it before the foundation of the world do I hear I shout in the house tonight I am not now choosing you I am not picking you because you d a long dress oh give the Lord some Praises I'm not choosing because you have on attire [Music] [Applause] [Music] h no one could take Moses place no matter how much K I raise up how many daans it was Moses God had called regardless and if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he would let you walk in notice he permits it he will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will just like in the beginning it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on the A on the earth true set because Adam was a spoken word son go said let us make man he form man from the dust of the earth and put the spirit man in that dust man and that man became a living Soul Adam was supposed to speak for his sons his son was supposed to be spoken with sons his sons was supposed to be just like him that's why when Jesus came he said he must be born again of the word and the spirit he bringing it back to the spoken word the word coming out the mouth of God oh give the Lord a shout in the house give the Lord a shout this born again is to bring you right back to the sons that Anam was supposed to have you not born by your mother and your father you have to be born again by the word and the spirit and the word has to be preached and the word is being preached tonight hallelujah praise God give the Lord a shout in the house this word have power in it the power of the word the the power of the spoken word as B Anthony preached God didn't talk to Darkness he just said let there be light take that Darkness okay the Lord has shout he spoke to the darkness he spoke light and darkness had to flee let there be light oh God speak into your condition speak into your situation open your mouth and speak into your situation stop moaning and groaning stop weeping and crying why speak amen like cry speak and move forward don't just speak you move forward when you're speaking don't stand up still move forward when you're speaking speak and move forward walk towards your Red Sea walk towards your Mountain walk towards your trial you're not running from it you're running to it because God Will Make A Way oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it was not God's perfect will for children to be bornn on the earth through sex god created Man Out of the Dust of the earth and breath the bread of life into him and he became a living Soul he took from that man a helpmate and made a wife to him that was God's first an original will but when sin come in and did what it did then he permitted man to marry a wife legally and have turned by her multiply and replenish the Earth then if that's the way you're going to do it but you see it never was his perfect will oh my could we go a little deeper tonight so we are only here and we are only in this condition because of Adam and Eve Adam was a spoken word son he was supposed to speak for other Sons to come forth because the of the Fall it fell into sex and through this fall we had to bypass our Tony so we move from thought to flesh and we bypass the word but he chose us he thought of us he predestinated us Romans 8:29 says for whom he did for know or who whom he knew before he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he Jesus might be the firstborn among many Breen oh come on now right with me now moreover whom he did predestinate Hallelujah he also called Hal no man can come except my father draw him you can't come except God draw you so whom he did predestinate them he also call and whom he call here we go them he also shout out and say it Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified Oh Glory to God why could he justify us how could he justify us because if Adam didn't do what he did we never be where we are oh Give the Lord a shout we only here because of Adam and Eve oh give the Lord a shout praise God is only because what Adam and Eve did we have this condition now oh give the Lord some Praises do you see it what more shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us it is clear it is only because of Adam and Eve we are here and that is why he could justify us oh this is enough to make you shout tonight if those don't make you shout I don't know what will oh my my I don't care what you're in what sin you're in what you tied up with is only because of Adam and Eve you tied up if you were born the correct way you never be in what you're in right now you never be in that mind battle you never in that Horror Story you're never in that condition you're in right now oh glory to God only because of Adam and Eve and listen to what the prophet said the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it will have to be the word manifested to be the Bride of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God I message I know brother of Jesus Christ that's lying lying to the people I message I in this church I this Fellowship I this Tabernacle lies you had to be the word manifested

birth let's drill down tonight the first life your first Union you would join in at Birth by nature natural act man and woman together in a sexual Affair which brought you here the first life is associated with sin and death that's right that why the Bible said man born of a woman is full of Sorrows because this birth associated with sin and death so your nature your first husband that had

this week some ncy story book you're reading he a choosing it so he said what according as he has chosen Us in him in him when he do that before when you fell when you get back up when you repent when you wear long dress when they come to church when they stop smoking when they stop wearing minis scirt no before the foundation of the world Hallelujah he was deliberate it was his choice oh give the Lord a shout did you get that he was deliberate about you he chose you out of everybody else he chose me out of all that he could have [Applause] [Music] [Applause] choose what's the purpose what's the purpose of choosing you that we should be holy and without blame other words you shut the M of the critics no accusers could point the finger to a Justified man that's why Paul concluded if God before us who can be against us go Paul put a seal on top of that if God before us you see I did that and did that that you say that you remember and remember some of the things I've done but Jesus with his special love forgive me of everyone woo hallelujah hallelujah he dropped the charges Jesus dropped the charges although I was wrong Hallelujah Jesus dro the charges [Applause] yeah BR having predestinated us unto adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will let me point out here that according to these verses Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride just as men choose their Brides today the bride today doesn't simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband it is the groom who decides and chooses the certain woman then he quot quote the scriptures in joh 156 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this chosing of the bride was purpose in himself that the purpose of God according to the election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that was purpose in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully before there was evered status before God was God he was known as the eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind so when it was eloh him the self-existing one alone with his thoughts you were in his thinking you was part of his mind and the Loos was not expressed yet before the logos before the Elohim Fountain of spirit the rainbow the thoughts the gene the attribute that is what was dear and in the beginning the expression from thought to word was the Loos Oh Glory to God so you are a germ and when God spoke you were in that word oh and because the byass offy you have to come back to the word hallelujah Give the Lord a shout in the house because a word is a thought expressed and for you to be expressed you have to be expressed through the word oh give the Lord some Praises let's go watch he was known as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind she was existing in his thoughts now what about the thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven God is infinite in his abilities therefore he has God must be omniscient if he's omniscient then he's not now learning now is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometimes he will be but that is not scripture he is omnicient he has never had a new thought about anything that is nothing to make a shout and run he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts has always had always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God th the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply my God my God my God my god listen this but I say they are they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real already Eternal and part of God so God TS not like a drawing I had to build this house you know I I blueprint no God taught before it's expressed it's already real it's tangible that's why he slay the lamb in his mind before the foundation of the world that you cannot be deceived oh the Lord I shout oh Hallelujah help me Jesus tonight praise God God always had his thoughts for Adam hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah watch this now Adam was form of the Dust of the earth his spiritual being was created by God and when Adam became God's thought expressed those Eternal thoughts are now Express watch he said he has chosen Us in him before the found of the world I'm right a close that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you cannot get away from that oh praise God hallelujah hallelujah these elect I'm F finishing now these elect were not only the Eternal thought of God which to be expressed in flesh in their due season but this same elect are called by another name Romans 4:16 he said therefore it's of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed neither because they were Seed of Abraham are they called children but in Isaac shall Li be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the chain of Promise accounted for the seed Galatians 3:16 after Abram to re seed with the promise given not as seeds as many but as one and if ye are in Christ ye are Abraham's seed and our ears according to the promise Paul puts himself and all believers under that designation because say Abraham who is the father of us all he goes on not only to narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it in Galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with Jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promise have to do with election the choosing of God oh give the Lord a shout election and the chosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying those who are of the royal seed are the elect of God are the predestinated the forn of God when the mind of God in his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreet season and each member came forth it become Express and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she's also called the body of Christ it is very apparent she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manif esting God in a many membered body here we come to the conclusion as the Eternal Loos God was manifest in the son and Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the god Bly that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh therefore gain the title of son son even so we here we go Eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many member spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God sons of God is not trity the Eternal thoughts of God manifest In the Flesh hear the B now even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirt we were seed and therefore we reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non seed there is nothing to Quicken Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to God redeem means to buy back my sheep hear my voice and hear the bom the final one you always were a sheep you never was a pig or a dog turned into sheep that is impossible for every kind of life which is the same kind there is no change of species as we were in the thoughts of God and expressing flesh there had to come a day when you we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize we are sons of God a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes he's a son but when a son always a son give the Lord a praise let's all stand and give
