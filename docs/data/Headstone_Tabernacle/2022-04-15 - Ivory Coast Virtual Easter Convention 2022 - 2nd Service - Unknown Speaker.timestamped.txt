[26:28] lord our god we call me this moment into
[26:30] your hands we ask you
[26:32] lord to pour out your spirit upon this
[26:34] convention
[26:35] so that the
[26:36] bride makes
[26:38] it to the purpose you chose us
[26:41] for
[26:43] so be it in the name of the lord jesus
[26:46] christ amen
[26:51] let's quickly turn into the bible in
[26:53] revelation chapter 10
[26:55] verse one and i saw another mighty angel
[26:59] come down from heaven clove with a cloud
[27:02] and a rainbow was up on his head and his
[27:06] face was as hit
[27:08] when the sun
[27:09] and his feet as
[27:11] pillars of fire
[27:13] and he had in his hand a little book
[27:16] open
[27:17] and he set his right foot up on the sea
[27:20] and his left foot
[27:22] on the earth and he cried with a loud
[27:24] voice
[27:26] as when lion roared and when he had
[27:28] christ some of the founders uttered
[27:30] their voices
[27:32] amen
[27:47] old and the ram of three years old and a
[27:49] turtle dove and a young pigeon and he
[27:52] took him unto him for these and divided
[27:54] them in the midst and let each peace one
[27:57] against another by the birds divided he
[27:59] not
[28:00] and when the flowers came down upon the
[28:02] carcasses
[28:03] abram drove them away
[28:06] and when the sun was going down a deep
[28:08] sleep fell upon abram low
[28:11] an aura of great darkness fell upon him
[28:15] and he said unto abraham
[28:18] no other charity that i see shall be a
[28:21] stranger in the land that is not theirs
[28:23] and shall
[28:24] serve them and they shall afflict them
[28:26] for
[28:30] and also that nation whom they shall say
[28:32] will i judge and after all they shall
[28:34] come out with great substance
[28:37] amen
[28:39] my brothers and sister
[28:42] there shall be a jubilee
[28:45] there shall be a bribe
[28:47] after 2000 years now god is molding
[28:52] this uncoming
[28:54] masterpiece
[28:56] yes hallelujah
[28:58] because god himself took the oath amen
[29:03] no government can be eradicated out of
[29:07] off
[29:07] god never does anything without trust
[29:10] giving a sign to the people
[29:13] he is now about to vindicate a cabinet
[29:15] made to abraham who is the believer so
[29:18] the title for my exaltation my greeting
[29:20] will be the vindication of the covenant
[29:25] following the theme of pastor paul for
[29:27] the convention
[29:28] the manifested life
[29:31] of christ
[29:32] in the bride is a sign that the rapture
[29:35] is a pain
[29:37] and for an inspiration
[29:42] the life of the revelation of jesus
[29:44] christ in you
[29:46] amen
[29:49] the light of the revelation of jesus
[29:51] christ in you when the tree of life
[29:53] isn't you
[29:55] when the spirit falls on the word of
[29:57] jesus christ in you
[29:59] oh my my brother
[30:02] it will not produce two tables of living
[30:04] stone of stone but it will bring the
[30:06] prisons of the living god the image of
[30:08] jesus christ the exact expression of
[30:11] jesus christ
[30:12] the individual
[30:14] god becoming visible tangible working
[30:17] in the church the chief ruler the
[30:20] supreme god had the deities
[30:23] the sheikah glory
[30:25] the same jesus
[30:27] then the plan is fulfilled
[30:29] the plan is fulfill the cup the covenant
[30:32] is vindicated
[30:34] the god that came down in the edges
[30:37] he that came down on the mountains
[30:39] brothers and sister let me tell you this
[30:42] it is none of the time to go playing in
[30:44] the woods
[30:45] to go climbing a mountain or to look for
[30:47] a mount of fountain somewhere
[30:50] because god has always wanted to live in
[30:54] human beings
[30:55] an anointed people a man
[30:58] god in your church
[31:00] god in the individual god has finally
[31:03] found his plate his position
[31:05] his main position in the church
[31:08] god's pyramid is standing the tree of
[31:11] life is leaving the church that is the
[31:14] dedication of the cabinet it is a fail
[31:16] to the teachers of this world it is
[31:19] vague to the man-made group
[31:22] this one group of the hero the other
[31:24] group here but it is only on there to
[31:26] those which
[31:28] that name are written in the book of
[31:29] life it is unveiled to the church
[31:32] putting nothing in the last days a
[31:34] church having no grain no dogma but just
[31:36] strictly holding the living word from
[31:39] the scriptures amen brothers and sisters
[31:44] this is the secret and this secret is
[31:45] vindicated in the world of god living in
[31:47] the pride
[31:49] hallelujah
[31:51] amen amen hallelujah it is a revelation
[31:54] of jesus
[31:56] upon this rock i will build my church no
[32:00] other rock can be accepted nothing else
[32:02] can be accepted not made for this iraq
[32:05] is accepted
[32:07] no protestant iraq is accepted no random
[32:10] worshipers iraq is accepted no
[32:12] government worship iraq is accepted no
[32:14] other rock no other rock is ascenting
[32:17] save the life of jesus christ
[32:20] his life and his life alone is life it
[32:23] rejects you and your whole life fades
[32:27] the life of jesus shows up it takes over
[32:30] and god must see that life the people
[32:33] must see
[32:34] the world must see
[32:36] the true life of jesus with works
[32:39] signs and wonders amen
[32:43] not just gifts
[32:45] not just prophecies
[32:47] not just miracles maybe with that life
[32:49] is demonic
[32:51] we are speaking of the true life of
[32:53] jesus we've
[32:55] signs and wonders
[32:58] the restored best person of the holy
[33:01] spirit the angel that kendall has
[33:03] finally found a body
[33:05] he has finally found a bride to dwell in
[33:10] hallelujah
[33:12] the angel has finally found the body to
[33:15] dwell in
[33:16] the angel has finally found a resting
[33:19] place the life of jesus in the church
[33:22] a tangible jesus
[33:24] walking with luffy fasting now demon
[33:27] healing the sea for getting seen doing
[33:30] great work
[33:31] then brothers and sister when you see
[33:34] the seven virtues the very seven virtues
[33:36] of jesus the seven spirit becoming flesh
[33:40] then you have the vindication for the
[33:43] rapture
[33:46] the world
[33:48] the world is focused on something else
[33:50] that we are focused on this
[33:53] which is the sign abraham was expecting
[33:56] aaron wasn't waiting for something else
[33:59] he was waiting for that
[34:01] light to pass bang because
[34:04] in the evening time it shall be like
[34:06] hallelujah christ in you the hope of
[34:08] glory
[34:10] christ is expressing himself through you
[34:13] he wants to bring you back to him
[34:15] a glorious bride
[34:18] he is addressing you being the same
[34:19] yesterday today and forever
[34:22] then the seven seals
[34:24] have fulfilled the purpose in your life
[34:26] the covenant is vindicated
[34:28] god has revealed to you this great
[34:30] mystery hidden
[34:32] sins the beginning of time amen
[34:36] the mystery is being revealed to you
[34:39] how will you know it
[34:41] because is leaving you his life is in
[34:44] you it's nature is in you
[34:46] is
[34:57] you have the vast sea of the lord
[34:59] that is the position of the church on
[35:02] the top of the pyramid in you
[35:04] was sons and daughters of god ready for
[35:08] the rapture
[35:12] that is why
[35:14] what's former the sunset mountain
[35:18] remission of light when the seven angel
[35:20] came down in the people at the meaning
[35:22] of it then the people that declared it
[35:25] said this is the resurrection power that
[35:28] came down to prepare you
[35:30] to take you to the condition for the
[35:32] rapture
[35:34] brothers and sisters will not do it by
[35:37] yourself but god promised an apostolic
[35:39] church
[35:40] you will make it to perfection
[35:43] you will reproduce jesus christ on this
[35:45] earth no demon no denomination
[35:48] no easy is able to him the heat
[35:52] because the seven angels are right here
[35:57] building this pyramid oh man
[36:00] oh man
[36:02] glory be to god
[36:04] it will be the going away
[36:07] then the mystery of god is revealed unto
[36:09] you
[36:12] you know what it is
[36:15] the life of the seals because christ is
[36:19] the seal that we're up
[36:21] and this line
[36:22] can be seen in you
[36:24] god sees it the unbeliever sees it
[36:27] the word sees it the church sees it and
[36:30] you see it too
[36:31] then brothers it is the vindication of
[36:34] the governing the covenant is vindicated
[36:38] what abraham has to do is to keep up to
[36:42] keep the blood out of the priest of the
[36:43] world keep the bad down give the demon
[36:46] up deep past the false and mighty god
[36:48] keep up the false word give up the
[36:50] not doing bad stay with the man say stay

[47:25] with us
[47:26] this weekend as we put our shoulders to

[47:34] of this convention is to produce the
[47:35] life
[47:37] is to see the life of god in you
[47:39] praise god not just coming to church not
[47:42] just belonging to message but we must
[47:44] see the life because creation is waiting
[47:47] hallelujah nature is groaning
[47:50] the bombs are flying everywhere not
[47:52] because they want to come they are
[47:54] coming because you must come back to
[47:56] your manifestation
[47:58] oh glory be to the living god hallelujah
[48:01] you maybe see that so jesus said i am
[48:04] the vine and ye are the branches and if
[48:06] the brunch bring forth a vine but
[48:08] abraham said that vine bears grapes the
[48:11] next brain that brings forth will also
[48:13] bear the same thing
[48:15] hallelujah so we must produce the very
[48:18] life of jesus christ the very power of
[48:21] jesus christ the thing that jesus did we
[48:23] must do praise god in him was power in
[48:27] him was quickening power praise god
[48:30] hallelujah and the bride must be word of
[48:32] his word spirit of his spirit power of
[48:35] his power life of his life pray when the
[48:39] storms come jesus didn't tremble he
[48:41] stood there said peace be still
[48:44] why there was resident power in him he
[48:47] has control and authority over every
[48:50] principality in his life
[48:52] glory to god so must the bride today
[48:56] produce the very life produce the very
[48:58] power produce the very evidence that
[49:01] christ is in you today oh you believe
[49:05] that
[49:06] hallelujah oh problem say you say
[49:09] brother abraham but look we have all
[49:11] these churches brevard say that is
[49:13] grafted vines i'm not looking for
[49:15] grafted vines we are looking for the
[49:18] original vine
[49:20] you maybe see that the original not a
[49:22] czech branch not a czech vine we are
[49:25] looking for the original seed to produce
[49:28] after its kind as it was on the day of
[49:31] pentecost silver and gold i don't have
[49:34] but such as i have i give unto you in
[49:37] the name of jesus christ that is what
[49:40] the bride must produce today the same
[49:43] life same evidence same power
[49:46] oh
[49:47] glory be to the name of the living god
[49:51] hallelujah so the churches brown said
[49:54] look brother abraham look at all these
[49:56] churches but once that is grafted vines
[49:59] now you can graft citrus fruit you can
[50:02] grab citrus fruit
[50:03] you can take an orange tree and put a
[50:05] lemon onto it it will grow
[50:08] i get in it now my mom said that is man
[50:11] grafted in
[50:12] and these organizations is what man
[50:15] grafted in
[50:16] praise god that's why i tell the people
[50:19] everywhere i go time for belonging to
[50:21] the message is over
[50:23] praise god nature is not looking for
[50:26] those that belong to message we are
[50:28] looking nature is groaning creation is
[50:31] groaning for the
[50:33] manifestation oh glory to god of the
[50:37] sons of god
[50:40] praise god that's what nature is waiting
[50:42] for
[50:43] you get it now
[50:44] hallelujah and this organization is what
[50:47] minecrafted in is lemon all the time it
[50:51] will grow because it's stuck out in the
[50:53] church name

[50:57] you if that tree ever put forth another
[51:00] branch itself
[51:02] glory to god if the holy ghost drops
[51:05] down in the church on a bunch of
[51:09] individuals that are called our
[51:11] sanctified set aside for service
[51:15] what will he do
[51:17] praise god

[51:25] branch itself it will be an orange
[51:28] it will not bear
[51:30] any other thing that is grafted
[51:32] praise god so if you connect back to him
[51:36] the word or you will produce the life of
[51:38] the world you produce the character of
[51:41] the word you produce the spirit of the
[51:43] word you produce the power of the word
[51:46] but if you are connected to church oh
[51:49] glory to god
[51:50] you will just be mocking time but it is
[51:53] time to rise up and produce the life of
[51:56] the world
[52:00] praise him
[52:02] and if the power of god ever put forth
[52:04] another church listen now and if the
[52:07] power of god not the power of the
[52:09] minister not the part of your group
[52:11] revelation if the power of god ever puts
[52:15] forth another church it will be another
[52:18] pentecost another book of us will be
[52:21] wrote behind it because it is the church
[52:23] of god oh come on church that is what
[52:26] the word wants to produce that is what
[52:28] brother abraham came for to call out a
[52:30] bride as it was at pentecost to bring
[52:34] for the power to be written epistles
[52:37] already known by all men

[52:49] my life to produce another experience of
[52:53] pentecost where the blind will see the
[52:56] lame will walk the devil here the pound
[52:59] will be set free why because another
[53:02] book of us will be wrote behind the
[53:04] bride

[1:03:46] and here are the branches the brother
[1:03:47] said he is the main vine
[1:03:51] praise god that wheat comes out of the
[1:03:53] original root from the original seed
[1:03:56] that has the life in it
[1:03:58] now the vine does not bear fruit
[1:04:03] the vine produces the life to the branch
[1:04:07] it doesn't bear fruit
[1:04:08] you want fruit you don't go digging down
[1:04:10] the root to get fruit no you look on the
[1:04:13] tree and if that tree has no leaves
[1:04:16] you'll not even have expectation for
[1:04:17] fruit
[1:04:18] so there must be leaves green fresh
[1:04:21] leaves praise god to attract you
[1:04:24] hallelujah he said this tree looks
[1:04:26] healthy let me go see if i can get some
[1:04:29] mango fruit from there but if that tree
[1:04:32] is all dried up you will not even be
[1:04:34] attracted to have the expectation to
[1:04:37] even turn aside and look
[1:04:39] are you following me now glory to god
[1:04:43] oh glory
[1:04:45] amen now the vine does not bear fruit it
[1:04:48] is the branches that do that
[1:04:53] oh come on seven thunder branches let us
[1:04:56] see the seven thunders praise god
[1:04:59] producing the power oh that is in divine
[1:05:03] come on now it is time to rise up and
[1:05:06] begin to speak and walk like a son like
[1:05:09] a daughter because these signs
[1:05:12] must follow them that belief
[1:05:18] glory
[1:05:20] hallelujah
[1:05:23] man
[1:05:24] now the vine does not bear fruit it is
[1:05:26] the branches that do that now what this
[1:05:29] you can take a sister's
[1:05:31] tree such as an orange and graft it into
[1:05:34] a grapefruit limb or a lemon limb
[1:05:37] tangerine limb and other kinds of that
[1:05:40] variety and all those will grow
[1:05:42] all those limbs will grow but those
[1:05:44] grafted limbs will not be oranges no
[1:05:47] sound
[1:05:50] ah
[1:05:51] you hear me
[1:05:52] no they can't
[1:05:54] christ is the vine
[1:05:56] huh methodist can come and graft to that
[1:05:59] name baptist can graft to that name now
[1:06:02] thunders can graft to that name every
[1:06:03] other inspiration can grab into that
[1:06:06] name
[1:06:07] praise god but we are not looking to be
[1:06:09] grafted
[1:06:11] no we want to be part of the original
[1:06:13] vine that is why is back to the world
[1:06:16] back to the original that is why we
[1:06:18] cannot take any other life except the
[1:06:21] life that comes from the vine the
[1:06:23] original word the spoken word is the
[1:06:26] original seed we cannot take any other
[1:06:29] revelation than the revelation of jesus
[1:06:32] christ upon that rock i will build my
[1:06:35] church oh and the gates of hell will
[1:06:37] come other interpretations will try to
[1:06:39] be grafted in but the true vine the true
[1:06:42] vine will produce original branches that
[1:06:46] will produce the original fruit the
[1:06:48] original life and they will stay
[1:06:50] true to who they are
[1:06:52] glory
[1:06:54] hallelujah
[1:06:56] that is why
[1:06:57] you can't fight any other branch
[1:07:01] i guarantee now
[1:07:02] that is why we try to preach it
[1:07:05] from the original vine
[1:07:07] to warn you that though you are on the
[1:07:09] same tree pray from drawing from the
[1:07:11] same vine but there are other grafted
[1:07:14] branches
[1:07:15] don't try to produce their fruit because
[1:07:18] you are not of those other branches you
[1:07:20] come from the original vine the holy
[1:07:23] ghost itself
[1:07:27] you get it now
[1:07:29] seven thunders give fate that is where
[1:07:32] you stand
[1:07:36] original fight
[1:07:37] producing
[1:07:38] branches of the original vine
[1:07:41] hallelujah so all other interpretations
[1:07:44] can be grafted to that tree
[1:07:46] you get it now i am the holy ghost no
[1:07:49] doubt grafted
[1:07:51] you get it now but the true branch comes
[1:07:54] up there and said no sir have you
[1:07:56] received the holy ghost since you
[1:07:58] believe that is the original branch from
[1:08:01] the original vine
[1:08:04] the doctrine of the apostles have you
[1:08:07] received the holy ghost
[1:08:12] you follow it now
[1:08:14] getting a revelation today
[1:08:16] why those interpretations must exist
[1:08:19] because there are grafted branches
[1:08:22] taking the outsourced from the vine
[1:08:24] but when that tree puts forth an
[1:08:26] original branch it will produce the life
[1:08:29] of the original vine
[1:08:32] oh come on now
[1:08:34] praise god
[1:08:37] hallelujah
[1:08:38] you get it now you may be seated praise
[1:08:42] god amen remember yet those limbs will
[1:08:45] be driving off the life in the tree but
[1:08:48] if that tree ever puts forth another
[1:08:50] branch of itself it will be an orange
[1:08:53] brand that bear oranges why because the
[1:08:57] life in the limb and the life in the
[1:08:59] trunk are identical
[1:09:05] identical
[1:09:08] whereas it wasn't so with the grafted
[1:09:10] limbs
[1:09:11] those grafted branches had their source
[1:09:14] in other kind of life from other trees
[1:09:17] from the other roots from the other
[1:09:19] seeds oh they will bear their fruits all
[1:09:21] right but they wouldn't bear oranges
[1:09:24] they cannot because they are not the
[1:09:26] original
[1:09:29] cannot
[1:09:30] no matter how plain you put it cannot
[1:09:32] bear it because it is not of the
[1:09:34] original
[1:09:36] eye with me now so we must get off those
[1:09:38] grafted branches
[1:09:40] don't even fellowship praise god
[1:09:42] hallelujah oh have no fellowship with
[1:09:45] darkness you get it now
[1:09:48] you can't be in and out all the time no
[1:09:50] you've got to be the original branch
[1:09:53] because your life comes from the
[1:09:54] original vine
[1:09:57] glory
[1:09:58] oh you love him today
[1:10:08] glory
[1:10:09] so the prophet said denominations which
[1:10:11] are man directed cannot be born of god
[1:10:15] for it is the spirit not man that gives
[1:10:18] life
[1:10:21] it is what the spirit
[1:10:24] not mine
[1:10:25] so when man become the holy ghost what
[1:10:27] kind of spirit is that that's man's
[1:10:29] spirit
[1:10:30] that denominational spirit and cannot be
[1:10:34] born of god
[1:10:38] do you hear it now
[1:10:39] you see that
[1:10:41] hallelujah so what does it take to
[1:10:44] produce this life nicodemus knew at a
[1:10:47] point that come on now where i belong i
[1:10:49] can't produce the life that jesus has i
[1:10:51] can't produce his life so he went to
[1:10:53] jesus what shall a man do in order to
[1:10:56] have eternal life jesus said except a
[1:10:58] man be born
[1:11:00] again
[1:11:02] how can i be born again
[1:11:04] oh revelation needed to be there
[1:11:07] nicodemus needed a revelation but he
[1:11:09] came carnally as a denominational
[1:11:11] pharisee praise god jesus said except
[1:11:14] you'll be born of water and of spirit
[1:11:16] you cannot even see the kingdom you get
[1:11:19] it now so there's got to be a born-again
[1:11:21] experience in order to see the original
[1:11:25] lie
[1:11:26] oh glory and the prophet the people that
[1:11:29] believe the message for their day they
[1:11:31] are the seas of the kingdom at that time
[1:11:35] glory
[1:11:36] you've got to believe the message for
[1:11:38] your day to produce the life of the vine
[1:11:41] at that time at this time so love must
[1:11:45] be there
[1:11:46] charity comes upon brotherly kindness
[1:11:53] right we are doing good praise god
[1:11:56] hallelujah
[1:11:58] now be seated praise the lord so this
[1:12:00] power that is in divine remember now
[1:12:03] man cannot be born man directed
[1:12:06] denominations which are man directed
[1:12:08] cannot be born of god
[1:12:10] i get in it now when we talk about
[1:12:11] denomination don't just look at the
[1:12:13] pentecostal baptist and that no talk
[1:12:15] spoken word church
[1:12:18] a lot have been denominated i belong to
[1:12:21] spoken word i am a no come on now you've
[1:12:23] got to be born again
[1:12:26] to produce a life
[1:12:29] you get it now that is why young people
[1:12:32] you've got to have a personal experience
[1:12:35] you've got to confess you've got to
[1:12:37] accept jesus christ as your personal
[1:12:40] savior
[1:12:42] not born into church not born into
[1:12:44] message but have you received the holy
[1:12:46] ghost since you were born into the
[1:12:48] message
[1:12:53] mama is in the message papa is in the
[1:12:55] message but you must accept jesus christ
[1:12:58] as your personal lord and savior
[1:13:01] then you begin the walk with christ then
[1:13:04] you are you are not grafted but as long
[1:13:07] as you follow mama and papa to church
[1:13:10] you become a grafted branch
[1:13:13] that's why people are in the message and
[1:13:15] living like the world
[1:13:17] because they take their souls from the
[1:13:19] world but grafted their praise god but
[1:13:23] when they bear their fruit they must
[1:13:25] produce the fruits of what that original
[1:13:28] seed is
[1:13:30] you get it now but you are to be
[1:13:32] transformed today
[1:13:34] praise god you are always a son
[1:13:37] but get out of them vineyards praise god
[1:13:40] that don't belong to original vine and
[1:13:43] be transformed
[1:13:44] today oh
[1:13:46] into the life of the world
[1:13:49] you get it now
[1:13:50] you may be seated
[1:13:52] alleluia
[1:13:54] so it takes a power bronzer for the
[1:13:56] spirit for it is the spirit not man that
[1:13:59] gives life so it takes the power to give
[1:14:02] this life
[1:14:03] praise call and the brother said let the
[1:14:06] fundamentalist
[1:14:07] let the people who deny the power of god
[1:14:10] say it is wrong
[1:14:13] huh but the same power does speak the
[1:14:16] world into existence is in those people
[1:14:20] that is god the holy ghost
[1:14:22] same power that's the let there be is in
[1:14:25] the bride that has got the holy ghost
[1:14:28] from the original vine
[1:14:31] same power
[1:14:32] oh come on church
[1:14:34] that's why i said man is so minipotent
[1:14:37] huh you mean to tell you you born of
[1:14:39] flesh yes when you produce the very life
[1:14:42] of the original vine you become a
[1:14:45] minipotent
[1:14:47] same power that spoke the world into
[1:14:49] existence let there be light that same
[1:14:51] power is in the bride
[1:14:53] same power is he knew it was an official
[1:14:56] man who could not sign his name but when
[1:14:59] peter stepped out of the upper room
[1:15:01] praise god same power
[1:15:04] creative power hallelujah the same power
[1:15:08] was in peter
[1:15:09] ignorant and on leonid
[1:15:12] but the same power was there
[1:15:14] glory
[1:15:16] hallelujah
[1:15:18] oh by the same power that spoke the
[1:15:20] world into existence is in those people
[1:15:23] that is god the holy ghost that's right
[1:15:25] men and women but abram said it is time
[1:15:28] we found out who you are
[1:15:33] are you getting me now
[1:15:34] ah you just didn't come here to work and
[1:15:37] get some little pay and get excited and
[1:15:40] it cannot take you to the end of the
[1:15:42] month no you are miniature creators
[1:15:46] ah you can create praise god that is the
[1:15:49] power that is resident in you that is
[1:15:51] the life you must produce today the same
[1:15:54] life
[1:15:59] ah
[1:16:00] jesus had power
[1:16:02] when it was time to pay the time say go
[1:16:04] catch that fish cut the stomach open
[1:16:06] there's a coin there good pay
[1:16:10] nothing to worry about brother we've got
[1:16:13] to know who we are
[1:16:15] we just didn't come to church believing
[1:16:16] god said the prophet
[1:16:18] and say the prophet didn't know you must
[1:16:20] do the same greater works because the
[1:16:23] same lie does in the prophet must be in
[1:16:25] you to produce the same results
[1:16:28] you get it now
[1:16:30] hallelujah that's right men and women it
[1:16:33] is time that we found out who you are
[1:16:36] the devil is trying to hide you back
[1:16:39] satan is trying to hide you back with
[1:16:41] reasoning power satan can go into the
[1:16:44] realm of revelation praise god that's
[1:16:46] why jesus came and died if satan had a
[1:16:49] revelation he would have known that the
[1:16:51] lamb was slain before the foundations of
[1:16:52] the world pray it was already done
[1:16:54] finished but satan lacks revelation so
[1:16:57] jesus brought the evidence went to the
[1:17:00] cross and said it is finished hallelujah
[1:17:02] it is feeling now you have seen because
[1:17:04] satan can only walk by sight praise god
[1:17:06] but the bride will walk by revelation
[1:17:10] yeah so don't let the devil hide you
[1:17:12] back there to tell you that these
[1:17:14] promises are for some other people
[1:17:16] no it's for you
[1:17:17] the promise is unto you and to your
[1:17:20] children and to your children's children
[1:17:22] and to them that are far off even as
[1:17:24] many as the lord our god shall call that
[1:17:26] is you now pray the promises unto you

[1:17:48] uh i'm a son of god a daughter of god
[1:17:52] satan you can't stand my way why
[1:17:55] deity resides in me
[1:17:58] oh come on now the prophet said the
[1:18:02] deity is not in heaven
[1:18:04] it is in you

[1:18:09] but let me tell you something brother
[1:18:11] when you realize that the almighty god
[1:18:14] lives in you
[1:18:18] the world can understand why jesus came
[1:18:20] down on the head and said he is god
[1:18:23] ah how much more when you can declare
[1:18:27] that you are having the almighty god
[1:18:30] living in you but when you realize that
[1:18:34] almighty god lives in you immortal life

[1:19:07] christ it lives above those things you

[1:19:17] you love your enemy it makes you bless
[1:19:19] them that kills you it makes you rejoice

[1:20:02] see the catholics who carried jesus on
[1:20:04] the cross
[1:20:07] walking about every street and drumming
[1:20:09] and making noise
[1:20:10] but we have deity
[1:20:13] christ in us the hope of glory

[1:20:21] revealed to you
[1:20:23] upon this rock i will build my church
[1:20:26] you get it now

[1:20:36] what life
[1:20:37] so you can't have any life outside the
[1:20:40] holy spirit
[1:20:46] your good moral self cannot do it
[1:20:49] that's a grafted branch
[1:20:57] but christ he knew the holy ghost the
[1:20:59] hope of life
[1:21:01] hallelujah the creator god himself
[1:21:04] dwelling in the human being it does not
[1:21:06] appear what we shall be
[1:21:08] but we shall see him as he is for we
[1:21:11] will be made like him
[1:21:14] we will be made like what like him
[1:21:18] that's why the keys were given unto
[1:21:20] peter
[1:21:22] second peter one if these things be
[1:21:24] there
[1:21:28] you see that

[1:21:35] is what is the matter with the church
[1:21:37] the hope of glory the baptism of the
[1:21:40] holy ghost has come into the people's
[1:21:42] hearts
[1:21:44] and they don't recognize what it is
[1:21:48] they think is a little church joining or
[1:21:50] something like that
[1:21:51] no but we're not here to join church
[1:21:54] we're not here to we're not here to draw
[1:21:56] congregation because remember three
[1:21:58] seeds have been planted
[1:22:00] denominational seeds pentecostal seeds
[1:22:03] and the wet cedar and these two
[1:22:06] pentecostal denomination is looking for
[1:22:08] numbers

[1:22:12] but brother we escape the loss of the
[1:22:14] flesh we escape the pride of life we
[1:22:17] scrape the praise god the loss for money
[1:22:19] women and popularity we escape them
[1:22:23] so the word seed must be planted in you

[1:22:51] hallelujah
[1:22:52] so the prophet said amen you made me see
[1:22:54] that he said but that is the god the
[1:22:57] creator living in you and giving you all

[1:27:12] these waters of separation must be kept
[1:27:15] in a clean place
[1:27:18] you can't keep this word of life the
[1:27:20] life of god in a dirty place no it's got

[1:33:23] because it's not so relaxed that tv has
[1:33:26] become part of the church homes
[1:33:29] the prophet said kick that thing out of
[1:33:31] your home
[1:33:35] how many books do you read in a week

[1:33:44] commentary of tv programs you can run
[1:33:48] ah
[1:33:49] you can wake and wake and watch tv till
[1:33:51] 1am but you cannot read the book of the
[1:33:54] world for one hour you can't read a
[1:33:56] message book for one hour if these
[1:33:59] things be in you
[1:34:05] glory
[1:34:07] hallelujah
[1:34:08] god building his church
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:11] is one person into an individual it's
[1:34:15] like one person into an individual into
[1:34:18] himself the glory the power of god
[1:34:21] coming down through this i get in it the
[1:34:24] power of god coming down through this
[1:34:26] welding it together therefore the
[1:34:29] pentacles are people that let out the
[1:34:31] lutherans let out the westlands and
[1:34:33] things doesn't know what they are
[1:34:35] talking about you see
[1:34:37] hallelujah they lived in this part of
[1:34:39] the temple that is the way some people
[1:34:41] can come up that high and drop
[1:34:44] off
[1:34:46] can come up all the way maybe looter
[1:34:49] drop off
[1:34:51] god cannot perfect that god cannot
[1:34:53] cement that god cannot put his power
[1:34:56] upon that the capstone cannot come upon
[1:34:58] that
[1:34:59] you get it now
[1:35:00] there's but there's a genuine part of
[1:35:03] that keeps making that building come on
[1:35:06] there's a genuine part so in every
[1:35:08] eighth god has got a genuine people that
[1:35:11] will hold on to the faith when the son
[1:35:13] of man cometh shall he find the faith
[1:35:15] that means that shall he find a people
[1:35:17] called up by his name making up the
[1:35:20] building the body of christ
[1:35:23] paul was there with his people praise
[1:35:25] god they held out iranians was there
[1:35:27] they held out martin columba luther
[1:35:30] wesley malachi for and his people they
[1:35:32] are holy now
[1:35:35] you get it now
[1:35:36] hallelujah
[1:35:38] oh that's the way some people can come
[1:35:40] up that high and drop up but there's a
[1:35:42] genuine part of that
[1:35:44] keeps making that building come on i
[1:35:47] will restore save the lord
[1:35:49] my brother said they eat it down
[1:35:50] remember the variety they eat it down
[1:35:52] but he pruned it huh they got
[1:35:54] denominational branches he pruned them
[1:35:57] off
[1:35:58] you get it now
[1:35:59] so if you don't produce this you'll be
[1:36:01] cut off
[1:36:03] god keep pruning that bright tree
[1:36:06] because it is a bright tree and he is
[1:36:08] the vine of that tree so every other
[1:36:11] grafted brown god will cut it off
[1:36:18] why because there are some genuine parts
[1:36:21] that keep making that building go up you
[1:36:24] get it now
[1:36:25] oh you may be seated hallelujah he
[1:36:28] pruned them off they raised up another
[1:36:30] check denominational branches he pruned
[1:36:32] it off
[1:36:33] but the heart of that tree kept growing
[1:36:36] the life is there you can kill god you
[1:36:38] can't kill the move of god the promise
[1:36:41] of god is sure and true nothing can stop
[1:36:44] it
[1:36:49] hallelujah
[1:36:51] oh
[1:36:52] the heart of the tree kept growing and
[1:36:54] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:36:57] that is when christ come the holy spirit
[1:37:00] jesus comes down and sets himself at the
[1:37:03] head of the church then and he will be
[1:37:05] he said and he will resurrect this
[1:37:07] church being his own body in there is
[1:37:10] the body and the way god is expecting us
[1:37:14] as individual to grow the way he brought
[1:37:17] the church in to grow
[1:37:19] every church age it becomes one big
[1:37:21] church
[1:37:23] the way god expects you to grow is the
[1:37:26] way he brought this
[1:37:28] the church ages
[1:37:30] so we are not we are not pentecostal
[1:37:34] come and
[1:37:35] succeed and you have you have done your
[1:37:37] religion no we're not here to do
[1:37:39] religion we are here to produce the life
[1:37:41] the power the world
[1:37:46] so the prophet goes on
[1:37:48] when a man possesses these kinds of
[1:37:50] things
[1:37:52] huh we want power right we want to
[1:37:54] produce the life right when a man
[1:37:56] produces these kinds of things
[1:37:59] then the holy ghost comes upon him
[1:38:03] so the holy ghost will never come
[1:38:05] when these things are not there
[1:38:08] when a man possesses these kind of
[1:38:11] things then the holy ghost comes upon
[1:38:13] him no matter you might speak with
[1:38:15] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[1:38:17] that god had you might do that but until
[1:38:20] these virtues go into you
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:26] these virtues brother abraham said
[1:38:29] so see why they fight the virtues in the
[1:38:32] message
[1:38:34] um but these virtues must go into you
[1:38:39] they say we shouldn't call them virtues
[1:38:41] because brother abraham it is touch of a
[1:38:43] perfect man
[1:38:45] but the prophet said until these virtues
[1:38:47] go into you
[1:38:49] you are still of the real true
[1:38:52] foundation of faith
[1:38:54] so until these things are in you you are
[1:38:56] not even a believer
[1:38:59] oh come on church
[1:39:02] ah these things must be there
[1:39:05] you get it now until these things are in
[1:39:08] you you are you are still of the real
[1:39:11] true foundation of faith but when these
[1:39:14] virtues grow in
[1:39:17] it must grow in
[1:39:20] ah
[1:39:21] so you have a little faith keep watering
[1:39:23] it oh keep holding on keep believing
[1:39:26] keep pushing it is gonna grow gonna grow
[1:39:28] gonna grow grow grow grow why these
[1:39:31] things must grow in
[1:39:33] and you added to that then you are a
[1:39:36] living monument
[1:39:38] you become a living temple a living top
[1:39:40] knuckle a living moving praise god
[1:39:44] temple of the living god
[1:39:46] living monument oh you believe that
[1:39:49] hallelujah you are a living moving idol
[1:39:54] see
[1:39:55] oh
[1:39:56] you get it now
[1:39:57] praise god my brother said but when we
[1:40:00] not in an imaginary way so you don't get
[1:40:03] these things in an imaginary way the
[1:40:05] bible says when you add to your faith
[1:40:08] we can't we can we can't define it in
[1:40:10] any other way the bible says when we add
[1:40:13] that's what we have to say
[1:40:15] but we know we are not adding by our
[1:40:17] human effort
[1:40:19] our revelation
[1:40:21] but we've got to say what the word says
[1:40:22] at your faith virtue
[1:40:27] so i can't come and explain it in any uh
[1:40:30] over the sky mystery and under the sea
[1:40:32] mystery no he said when you act your
[1:40:34] favorite to you
[1:40:36] but it's not you adding now is him by
[1:40:38] his spirit that's when the things
[1:40:40] together
[1:40:42] oh come on church
[1:40:44] not in an imaginary way but prostrate
[1:40:47] yourself before a living god a living
[1:40:50] virtue a living knowledge a living

[1:40:54] power coming from a living god making a
[1:40:58] living a living image in the stature of
[1:41:01] god what is he doing the same thing that
[1:41:04] jesus did walking the same way he walked
[1:41:07] doing the same things he did because it
[1:41:09] is not imaginary thing there is a
[1:41:13] reality that proves
[1:41:15] you get it now
[1:41:17] these things are not just imaginary
[1:41:19] that's power

[1:41:53] take each of those words and step in
[1:41:55] their mouth you see
[1:41:56] and show that it proves it goes together
[1:42:00] the virtues and the messengers go
[1:42:02] together

[1:42:53] house that god dwells in

[1:43:00] malice and jealousy and unforgiveness no
[1:43:03] no i can't be
[1:43:05] you see that that is the how that god
[1:43:08] dwells in not a building not this four
[1:43:10] square building

[1:43:22] so you enter the church you see that
[1:43:24] that's the virtue check no forget it the
[1:43:26] virtues must be in you
[1:43:28] if these things be in you and abound

[1:43:49] will not be unfruitful
[1:43:50] in the knowledge of jesus christ the
[1:43:52] word
[1:43:59] you get it now
[1:44:00] no you can't be ignorant of the
[1:44:02] scriptures
[1:44:03] because romans 5 romans 15 4 say for
[1:44:05] whatsoever things were written a fourth
[1:44:08] time
[1:44:09] we were written before our time
[1:44:11] whatsoever things were written before
[1:44:14] our time
[1:44:15] they were written for our landing
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:23] why you code this scripture and link it
[1:44:25] to that scripture and link it that's
[1:44:26] pentecostalism come on now come on wake

[1:44:36] become the word
[1:44:38] oh come on church
[1:44:40] oh
[1:44:41] they were written whatever things were
[1:44:43] written up all time we were written for
[1:44:44] our learning that we through patience
[1:44:47] and comfort of the scriptures we might
[1:44:49] have hope
[1:44:51] so how can you be there lacking the
[1:44:53] knowledge of jesus christ and want to
[1:44:55] have hope
[1:44:56] no you can't you must know by the
[1:44:59] learning of the scriptures
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:05] you get it now
[1:45:08] yeah
[1:45:09] praise god
[1:45:11] john 6 63 is that it is the spirit that
[1:45:14] quickness
[1:45:16] so if the spirit is in you it will
[1:45:18] quicken you
[1:45:20] back to the world
[1:45:21] huh the flesh prophet said nothing
[1:45:25] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:45:28] spirit so these things my our spirit and
[1:45:33] if you don't have the spirit you can
[1:45:35] design spiritual things
[1:45:38] so the life is spirit
[1:45:40] coming into you
[1:45:42] to break in that mortal body bring it
[1:45:44] under subjection of the word then you
[1:45:47] can live the life for the way that i
[1:45:49] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[1:45:52] are life
[1:45:57] you get it now
[1:45:59] so we must go by the scriptures
[1:46:02] that is the house god dwells in not a
[1:46:04] building with big bell on top of it no
[1:46:07] but a body has now prepared me a body
[1:46:11] that god can dwell in god can walk in
[1:46:14] god can see in god can talk in god can
[1:46:18] work in amen living his true mentality
[1:46:22] of god
[1:46:23] you become the living instrumentality
[1:46:28] listen the material that is going in the
[1:46:31] rupture is not
[1:46:33] it's not it's not trying error
[1:46:35] god ain't going to take in trial and
[1:46:37] error i will try if it works no god is
[1:46:40] looking for men of faith
[1:46:42] rugged men of faith that can take him at
[1:46:45] his word
[1:46:47] these words are spirit and they are
[1:46:49] alive
[1:46:53] you get it now
[1:46:54] a body has not prepared me amen living
[1:46:57] is the mentality of god god walking on
[1:46:59] two feet
[1:47:01] where is god
[1:47:02] walking on two feet
[1:47:04] amen in you glory the footsteps of the
[1:47:08] righteous is ordered of god god walking
[1:47:10] in you for ye are written epistles read
[1:47:13] of all men and if the life that is in
[1:47:16] christ be in you you will bear the life
[1:47:18] that christ born
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:23] christ manifested these things
[1:47:26] he hurt them
[1:47:28] you get it now
[1:47:30] praise god
[1:47:32] and the prophet's good amen
[1:47:34] we are good um as we wind down praise
[1:47:37] the lord he may be seated then
[1:47:39] said in the study of a perfect man
[1:47:41] paragraph 352 then god representing his
[1:47:45] church as a bride a woman represents his
[1:47:49] church as a bride
[1:47:50] and the way he brings each individual to
[1:47:53] being his son
[1:47:55] here now the way god brings each
[1:47:58] individual to be a son or a daughter
[1:48:03] listen
[1:48:04] and the way he brings each individual to
[1:48:08] being his son to go into to go in that
[1:48:11] bride he also brought the bride through
[1:48:14] these ages
[1:48:16] so you can't be in the bride without
[1:48:19] coming through these things
[1:48:23] so the bride impulse time are those that
[1:48:26] are here
[1:48:27] the church of ephesus

[1:48:39] outside of the bride they've been pruned
[1:48:41] out
[1:48:42] cut off praise god
[1:48:48] so you better make sure you bear the
[1:48:51] fruits
[1:48:53] of the vine in order not to be pruned
[1:48:56] off
[1:48:57] because if you say you believe without
[1:48:59] the life
[1:49:03] pray it's hard to say but it's the truth
[1:49:06] oh we cannot do nothing against the
[1:49:08] truth but for the truth
[1:49:10] we gotta preach it regardless
[1:49:13] we've got to say it regardless because
[1:49:16] pop peter said you've got to make your
[1:49:18] calling an election sure
[1:49:22] because these things has been have been
[1:49:24] revealed to you for you to know how to

[1:49:40] unnecessary things that don't profit
[1:49:42] your soul
[1:49:44] these things must be there
[1:49:48] you get it now
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:52] praise god

[1:49:58] you see that he brings each individual
[1:50:00] to being his son to go in that bride he
[1:50:03] has brought
[1:50:05] the bride to these ages
[1:50:08] till he bring this one to the complete
[1:50:10] church into this
[1:50:12] so we must be brought completely into
[1:50:15] charity

[1:50:21] my brother my feet will become my head
[1:50:23] says so it can't move like my hand is
[1:50:26] because it's my feet luther can't do the
[1:50:28] things that we do nada can the method is

[1:50:55] god has placed
[1:50:57] these things into his church
[1:51:00] and planted it and pardon it by showing
[1:51:05] that each individual has this
[1:51:09] possesses these qualities
[1:51:12] and this
[1:51:13] being when it is completed
[1:51:17] is the church of god going to the
[1:51:18] rapture
[1:51:21] this being this being this being when it
[1:51:23] is completed is the church of god going

[1:52:04] mean there you are that is the full
[1:52:07] thing

[1:52:31] praise god oh
[1:52:34] as we get ready to close out you maybe
[1:52:35] see that
[1:52:37] when you surrender
[1:52:39] your complete being you have to
[1:52:41] surrender
[1:52:43] listen salvation is a choice
[1:52:52] you choose to believe or choose not to
[1:52:54] believe
[1:52:56] god gave you that right that free moral
[1:52:59] agency
[1:53:01] you choose to live the life or choose
[1:53:02] not to
[1:53:05] you choose to get the holy ghost or
[1:53:07] choose not to
[1:53:13] because if you to give you the you give
[1:53:15] you the prescription repent every one of
[1:53:17] you and be baptized then you will
[1:53:19] receive the gift
[1:53:21] god is not a trial error man no he knows
[1:53:23] what he's talking about
[1:53:26] when paul saw when ananias went and laid
[1:53:30] house on him and prayed over what did
[1:53:31] the holy ghost what did the bible say
[1:53:32] the holy ghost he received the holy
[1:53:34] ghost
[1:53:36] what did he do how many years did he
[1:53:38] wait in the message right there
[1:53:42] had the experience
[1:53:44] hands led on him he received the holy
[1:53:46] ghost
[1:53:48] so if you truly repent
[1:53:51] you're not going to come
[1:53:53] you know in your own self-conceited way
[1:53:55] lord fill me with the holy ghost he will
[1:53:57] do it
[1:53:58] because you have to come by his way
[1:54:03] repent
[1:54:04] repent mean that change your ways
[1:54:08] because your ways are not my ways

[2:02:21] you and all these things your godly
[2:02:23] virtues are sealed onto the day of
[2:02:27] redemption
[2:02:30] god's life is also then in you jesus
[2:02:32] said amen i am the vine and you are the
[2:02:35] branches
[2:02:36] now look what was the first with jesus
[2:02:39] they are first with jesus because he was
[2:02:41] a man making himself god
[2:02:46] and you
[2:02:47] deity is not in heaven it's in you
[2:02:50] the world will not understand a bunch of
[2:02:52] new bodies
[2:02:54] huh but deity in you of course
[2:02:57] see
[2:02:58] he was a man making himself god he was
[2:03:00] god he was god in christ
[2:03:03] he told them he said and look don't look
[2:03:05] at me it is not me it is my father and
[2:03:08] he dwells in me see now they was looking
[2:03:11] at that little body that was born of
[2:03:13] mary see that was in god that was the
[2:03:15] son of god but god was in that body it
[2:03:19] was god he said if i do not the works of
[2:03:22] my father then condemn me but which of
[2:03:24] you can condemn me of sin and believe of
[2:03:27] the word which word has god spoken that
[2:03:31] hasn't been fulfilled in me sin is
[2:03:33] unbelief
[2:03:35] so we must believe
[2:03:37] if we don't believe then we are in sin
[2:03:41] sin is unbelievable
[2:03:43] you get it now
[2:03:45] which of you can accuse me of sin sin is
[2:03:47] unbelievable show me if i do know the
[2:03:48] ways of my father then don't believe me
[2:03:51] because if i do the works though you
[2:03:53] can't believe me believe the works that
[2:03:55] i do for they testify otherwise the
[2:03:58] father is in me testifying of himself
[2:04:00] cause god was in christ reconciling the
[2:04:04] world to himself you get it now
[2:04:06] oh brother said well the same life that
[2:04:09] is in the vine is also in the branch how
[2:04:12] are you going to join in you can't join
[2:04:16] into the church you've got to be born
[2:04:19] into the church
[2:04:27] so
[2:04:28] in closing
[2:04:30] are you enjoying it
[2:04:32] are you blessed so far
[2:04:34] praise god
[2:04:35] in closing
[2:04:37] now this messenger of malachi 4 and
[2:04:39] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[2:04:41] things one according to malachi 4 he
[2:04:44] will tend the hearts of the children to
[2:04:46] the fathers two he will reveal the
[2:04:48] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[2:04:50] revelation 10 which are the revelations
[2:04:53] contained in the seven seals it will be
[2:04:55] this divinely divinely revealed missing
[2:04:58] truth that literally turned the heart of
[2:05:00] the children to the pentecostal fathers
[2:05:02] exactly so
[2:05:04] revealed mystery truths
[2:05:09] our heart can only be ten when these
[2:05:12] things divine revealed mystery truths
[2:05:16] are literally in us then they would turn
[2:05:19] our hearts back
[2:05:22] to the fate of the fathers
[2:05:25] you get it now
[2:05:26] so the brother said might be closer than
[2:05:28] you think it is
[2:05:30] it got me scared oh i haven't done
[2:05:33] enough
[2:05:36] my calling and election i haven't done
[2:05:38] enough
[2:05:39] these things must be there
[2:05:41] to prepare me for the rapture
[2:05:44] this being when it is complete is that
[2:05:46] being that is going into the rapture
[2:05:50] i haven't done enough where are we at
[2:05:52] time shall be no more he announces that
[2:05:54] time is over what happens what happens
[2:05:57] could that be so now brethren
[2:06:00] seriously think if it is then the
[2:06:02] pyramid is capped by the seven thunders
[2:06:06] the capstone is the seventh thunders the
[2:06:09] headstone christ is the seventh thunders
[2:06:13] seriously think if that be so then the
[2:06:16] pyramid is cupped by the seven thunders
[2:06:23] i'm a seventh under believer has the
[2:06:25] cops don't capture a pyramid of your
[2:06:27] life
[2:06:29] it's not seven thunder just saying it
[2:06:31] but he must confirm it
[2:06:34] by capping you
[2:06:36] when these things
[2:06:38] are there
[2:06:39] and abound
[2:06:42] i gotta me now but it is the capstone
[2:06:45] what did he do the holy spirit capped
[2:06:47] off the individual and sealed it when we
[2:06:50] added to our faith righteousness
[2:06:52] goodness and faith and so forth and kept
[2:06:54] adding till we get seven things and the
[2:06:56] seventh one was love which is god that
[2:06:59] is how he makes the individual
[2:07:02] and cups him and seals him with the holy
[2:07:05] spirit
[2:07:06] then if that be so he has got seven
[2:07:08] church ages that he has seven mysteries
[2:07:11] that have been sounded away and they
[2:07:14] fought for to bring back
[2:07:16] we've got to fight to bring back
[2:07:18] the faith that was restored by malachi
[2:07:21] 4.
[2:07:22] they fought to bring back
[2:07:24] praise god
[2:07:27] oh hallelujah and now the headstone
[2:07:30] comes to cap off the church does the
[2:07:33] thunders mean that my brethren says is
[2:07:36] that what we are here at is that where
[2:07:38] we we are at
[2:07:41] you get it now
[2:07:44] praise him
[2:07:46] hallelujah
[2:07:48] oh you get it now

[2:08:03] is his victory we comfort in this last
[2:08:06] days with this glorious gospel showing
[2:08:09] his victory he died for these purpose
[2:08:12] christ died for you and i to have these
[2:08:15] things in us
[2:08:18] he died for these peoples we are proof
[2:08:22] of his victory amen when we see him
[2:08:24] coming down the headstock and living
[2:08:27] among the church that is his victory
[2:08:32] when we see the capstone come down
[2:08:36] cement these virtues in us that is
[2:08:38] christ victory
[2:08:41] you get it now
[2:08:43] oh
[2:08:45] the word and then the word moves on down
[2:08:48] into the body from the head what is it
[2:08:50] the same word
[2:08:52] nothing can be added or taken from it
[2:08:57] nothing can be added or taken these
[2:08:59] things must be there
[2:09:03] it's not sunday cook rice and beans and
[2:09:05] everybody eat and they are happy and you
[2:09:06] have rarely kindness forget that one
[2:09:11] the muslims do ya rayara every time
[2:09:14] kill bullocks and share free meat that's
[2:09:16] not what we're talking about charity
[2:09:20] though you know all mystery
[2:09:22] knowledge to understand every mystery
[2:09:26] without charity the cup stood useless
[2:09:33] praise god
[2:09:35] oh
[2:09:36] there is the body of christ living
[2:09:38] standing redeemed
[2:09:39] praise god we are his victory when we
[2:09:42] see him coming down and living among the
[2:09:44] church that is his victory shows that he
[2:09:47] couldn't keep him in the grave neither
[2:09:49] can they keep us
[2:09:51] nothing can keep us
[2:09:52] we are already potentially a reason
[2:09:55] because we raised from the dead and
[2:09:57] believe in his word from denominational
[2:10:00] creed to eternal word of the eternal god
[2:10:03] which is him himself working through us
[2:10:06] manifesting himself that he's the same
[2:10:08] yesterday today
