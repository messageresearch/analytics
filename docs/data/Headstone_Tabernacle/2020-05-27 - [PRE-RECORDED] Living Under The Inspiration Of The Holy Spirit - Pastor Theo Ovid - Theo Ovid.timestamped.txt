[27:50] 33 on revelation 5:8 the 14 so they
[27:56] wanna read said John chapter 20 21 to 22
[28:08] and when he had so said he
[28:15] he showed unto him his hands and his
[28:18] side and then would recite was glad when
[28:21] this sword and Lord o 21 and then said
[28:25] Jesus unto them again peace be unto you
[28:27] as my father had sent me so send I you
[28:29] and when he had said this he breathed on
[28:33] them and said unto them receive II the
[28:36] Holy Ghost they want to Luke chapter 24
[28:42] from verse 44 and he said unto them
[28:44] these are the words which I speak unto
[28:47] you while I was yet with you that all
[28:50] things must be fulfilled which were
[28:53] written in the law of Moses and in the
[28:56] and in the son and the prophets and in
[29:00] the Psalms considered me then open he
[29:03] the understanding that they might
[29:04] understand the scriptures and he said
[29:07] unto them thus it is written and does it
[29:10] behoove Christ to suffer and to rise
[29:12] from the dead the third day and that
[29:14] repentance and remission of sins should
[29:17] be preached in his name among all
[29:19] nations beginning at Jerusalem and he
[29:21] are witnesses of these things and behold
[29:24] I send the promise of my father upon you
[29:26] but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until
[29:29] you be endued with power from on high
[29:31] and he led them out as far as the
[29:34] Bethany and they lifted up his hands and
[29:36] blessed them and it came to pass while
[29:38] he blessed them he was parted from them
[29:41] and carried up in heaven and they
[29:43] worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem
[29:45] with great joy and they were continually
[29:48] in the temple praising and blessing and
[29:50] go on revelation chapter five you want
[29:53] to read from verse eight and when he had
[29:57] taken the book the four beasts on the
[29:59] phone twenty elders fell down before the
[30:01] lamb having every one of them harps and
[30:04] golden vials full of odours which are
[30:06] the prayers of the Saints and the summer
[30:07] new song saying thou art worthy to take
[30:09] the book and to open the seals thereof

[30:13] God by thy blood out of every kindred
[30:16] and tongue and people and nation and has
[30:19] made us unto our God kings and priests
[30:21] and we shall reign on the earth and I
[30:23] beheld
[30:23] I heard the voice of many angels round
[30:25] about the throne and the beasts and the
[30:28] elders and the number of them was ten
[30:29] thousand times ten thousand and
[30:31] thousands of told you saying with a loud
[30:33] voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain
[30:36] to receive power and riches and wisdom

[30:42] heaven and on the earth and under the
[30:45] earth and such as in the sea and all
[30:47] that are in them who did I see and
[30:49] blessing and honor and glory and power
[30:52] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[30:54] and unto the lamb for ever and ever and
[30:56] the four beasts said amen and the four

[31:42] Sunday not by might nor by power but by
[31:47] my spirit god bless you but Aiza that
[31:50] was some message that was some sermon I
[31:54] tell you my god my mind was totally
[31:57] blown oh my and I so enjoyed it only was
[32:02] it taken across day in France so we are
[32:05] not creating a new standard this time
[32:07] that already exists oh praise what a
[32:10] standard of holiness standard of
[32:13] righteousness standard of purity a
[32:15] standard of forgiveness a standard of
[32:18] seven living voices the standard of
[32:20] always was and always will be this
[32:23] that is Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah had
[32:28] his only holy Lord to put this thing
[32:30] together like that oh my the people have
[32:33] been taught that Church as a standard
[32:35] but brother Branham left this time they
[32:37] went but her mama left the earth he
[32:39] didn't the standard didn't leave it's
[32:41] not right the standard was in the hand
[32:43] of the spirit and the spirit reveal it
[32:46] to whomsoever he will so so nobody had a
[32:49] license under or what the spirit can
[32:51] reveal isn't that wonderful
[32:53] so the spirit could reveal the ton s of
[32:55] whomsoever he will isn't that right
[32:57] blessed be the name of the law
[32:59] understand that was always here isn't
[33:01] that right and it was handed the spirit
[33:03] and the Holy Ghost is the standard
[33:05] bearer that will stand with any man who
[33:07] stands with the word I love that the
[33:10] Holy Spirit is the standard there was
[33:13] time with any man who stays with the
[33:14] word and this is the balm for me the
[33:17] spirit has no loyalty to man he only has
[33:21] lawyer t - though his word

[33:58] title you to the Holy Ghost and title is
[34:01] it a token follow meters in the entire
[34:03] world and title you to be accompanied by
[34:05] the standard error it's the spirit that

[34:11] morning to be what God made you to be
[34:14] isn't that right oh is the spirit that
[34:17] follows the woods I so enjoy that

[40:00] you don't want to live under demon
[40:02] powers you don't want to live under the
[40:03] world you don't want to live under your
[40:05] whims and fancies your feeling and
[40:06] emotions you don't want to live under
[40:07] that you want to be living under the
[40:09] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and I
[40:12] have an inspiration these are the words
[40:14] that's the first thing Jesus told them
[40:16] these are the words he didn't give them
[40:18] more words a new words he getting the
[40:21] same words how little that he had before
[40:24] Halloween bring it back and make it more
[40:26] positive or give the Lord a shout in the
[40:29] house oh praise God praise God praise
[40:31] God hallelujah praise be
[40:35] oh my I want to tell you don't be
[40:38] discouraged this morning the Holy Spirit
[40:41] is with you looking over you isn't that
[40:43] right
[40:44] thank you Jesus all right let's go but a
[40:47] Balaam says and I want to tie into what
[40:48] Isaac preached but Isaac reached but
[40:51] Satan mixed appealing his shows and so
[40:53] on it's appealing citizens appealing but
[40:55] the enemy keeps finding a better bait
[40:57] so Satan another kid improving his
[40:59] tactics but but he had a strip off a
[41:02] little more don't worry
[41:03] and so forth right okay but what God
[41:06] doesn't have to do anymore to his God
[41:09] does not sir make it was more prettier
[41:11] he had to go out to make it dim with
[41:13] tinsel and so on no there what happen
[41:16] here he doesn't have to make do anything
[41:18] more to his to make it more appealing
[41:20] the only thing he has to do is the
[41:23] reason a standard of his own word
[41:27] against the enemy and the Bible says
[41:30] when the enemy come like a flood the
[41:32] Spirit of God or I call it raises the
[41:36] standard what does he do he makes the
[41:39] word that he already said more positive
[41:44] [Applause]
[41:48] so that's why Jesus come and tell them
[41:51] these are the words come to make it more
[41:53] positive to you because I want to give
[41:56] you an absolute sake I guarantee that
[41:59] this promise of the Father it is
[42:01] guaranteed behold I send the promise of
[42:04] my father upon you it is guaranteed
[42:07] somewhere the reason standard in your
[42:09] spirit in your life then he breathed
[42:12] upon receiving the Holy Ghost the breath
[42:16] of God was upon them they were living
[42:18] under the Norrington anointing of
[42:20] promise I'm nineteen of dynamics I'm
[42:23] going to receive Oh blessed be the name
[42:26] of the Lord praise God praise this
[42:30] wonderful name hallelujah do believe
[42:34] that so what Quran says he takes the
[42:37] word that he already said and make it
[42:40] more positive hallelujah not not not not
[42:45] new words not not new mysteries same
[42:48] ones he was telling them all along you
[42:50] come to make it more real to them the
[42:53] Bible Senate last days people have
[42:54] itching ears to hear new stuff
[42:56] the tickle in the ears that they wanna
[42:58] live nothing I know just out of here
[42:59] they like that here and right and here
[43:02] and here the more I hear the more they
[43:03] feel good about what it you see but this
[43:06] is not that Jesus was talking to them
[43:09] there wasn't catching a lot of stuff he
[43:10] was telling them that because it didn't
[43:12] have revelation
[43:13] you see revelation gives you a certain
[43:15] behavior I don't care what country
[43:18] you're from what language you speak
[43:19] revelation comes from God
[43:22] not on what you read and study that's
[43:24] your study but when it's revealed Oh
[43:26] spring stimulation it brings excitement
[43:29] it brings real expectation isn't that
[43:31] right so brother Branham says and you
[43:34] know the Bible says when the enemy come
[43:36] on like a flood the Spirit of God will
[43:38] raise up a standard and when God here we
[43:40] go
[43:41] when God gives his church a blessing and
[43:43] they move along with that blessing Sulu
[43:46] until it become common to the world then
[43:49] they begin to run it down then the
[43:52] Spirit of God comes in and raise up a
[43:55] standard again and there's a brick and
[43:57] fort or revival or something the message
[43:59] going slow slow coach look who's
[44:01] everybody forget it right and the
[44:03] righteous and into everything and
[44:04] whether when I'm see I'm what about I'm
[44:06] see but it's not revival be comfortable
[44:10] in the comfort zone and so on but
[44:12] afterwards God want a reason standard a
[44:14] revival freaks out isn't that right and
[44:17] we have a promise he said what we see
[44:19] happen should put every soul in action
[44:21] it should make a church that would make
[44:23] a revival that people be flying in from
[44:25] Europe to see what's taking place not
[44:29] here to see they will see it as a place
[44:32] in Arizona called Maricopa Valley a city
[44:35] called Phoenix there is something broke
[44:37] out here that the seven thunders of
[44:38] Revelation 10 that's not even Lord is
[44:41] being manifested in other words that got
[44:43] to come an hour when we could say this
[44:45] is that that the Prophet Balaam Branum
[44:48] speaker praise God not the bunch of
[44:51] churches all around no not that no dis
[44:53] prophesy here these are the words Oh
[44:56] hallelujah
[44:57] these are the words you have to connect
[45:00] with these are the words Oh hallelujah
[45:03] praise God praise God so he continued
[45:06] know the Angels has gathered up the
[45:08] loose ends and we are here he was about
[45:11] to write those tenders he said I don't
[45:12] like them seal him up and at the day of
[45:14] song in of his last seven angels to
[45:16] change what the mystery of God all about
[45:19] God how God is but one God all these
[45:23] things will be finished at that time the
[45:25] great battles back before had got these
[45:27] loose ends hanging out it ought to be
[45:29] wrapped up together in this age so
[45:31] before the thunders could
[45:33] all the loose ends have to be tied up
[45:35] before you could get your portion the
[45:37] loose ends in your life have to be tied
[45:39] up
[45:39] isn't that right so brother sister we
[45:42] are the endtime let the Holy Spirit
[45:45] influence us to the Word of God let God
[45:50] do the influencing in our hearts and not
[45:54] be influenced by others but Isaac said a
[45:56] powerful thing that people could get
[45:58] desensitized to the Holy Spirit or the
[46:00] Holy Spirit what bring conviction Holy
[46:02] Spirit will bring you're wrong you
[46:04] should change the attitudinal wings and
[46:05] I told him in Paris
[46:06] what about and say I rather somebody
[46:08] wrong and their doctrine and right in
[46:11] their spirit that's somebody right in
[46:13] the doctrine unroll in your spirit when
[46:15] somebody right in their spirit they
[46:17] could be corrected when somebody wrong
[46:19] in your spirit that's terrible
[46:21] you can tell them my power because
[46:22] they're right in the doctrine they may
[46:24] be right
[46:24] go please say this or this but you're
[46:26] wrong in your spirit oh ha that's a
[46:28] religious spirit that's a demon actually
[46:30] Oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[46:33] Lord
[46:33] so watch let the Holy Spirit influence
[46:36] us to the Word of God and let God do the
[46:39] influence in your hearts and not be
[46:41] influenced by others this ought to put
[46:44] us in action with reverence and humility

[51:18] [Applause]
[51:20] hallelujah glory glory glory this
[51:29] morning when a Stephen sent me this this
[51:31] morning scripture and the blood of Jesus
[51:33] Christ His Son cleanses from all sin and
[51:35] there's a good woman in the wings of
[51:37] over snow I dove did you know a real
[51:40] Christian doesn't have any sin imputed
[51:41] to him David said blessed is the man
[51:47] whom God will not impute sin to when you
[51:52] are washed in the blood of the Lamb not
[51:55] by make-believe but really the blood of
[51:58] the Lamb God does not impute to you
[52:01] anything that's done because you are
[52:03] under the blood and he doesn't see it
[52:06] there is a blood sacrifice the only
[52:09] thing he can see you in is the way he
[52:11] saw you before the foundation of the
[52:14] world when he put your name in the
[52:17] Lamb's Book of Life that is all he can
[52:19] look at because you are redeemed from
[52:22] everything that was ever done you are
[52:25] washed in the blood of the Lamb
[52:27] therefore there is no girl in you there
[52:30] is no unclean habit in you because that
[52:33] the blood of the Lamb have did this and
[52:35] God tell it impute sin to you after you
[52:38] got sin offering laying waiting for you
[52:42] Oh hallelujah
[52:43] well you say brother branham I can do
[52:46] what I want - I always do always but
[52:48] when a man can't really see what Jesus
[52:50] done for him and tunnel and be from the
[52:53] contrary to him it shows he never
[52:55] received Christ or give the Lord a shout
[52:59] do you love him this morning Oh bless
[53:01] attacker better Steven hallelujah praise
[53:04] the Living God hallelujah praise God
[53:08] praise Jesus
[53:10] so that is why brother Branham says
[53:11] watch watch this John was weeping
[53:15] because no man was found worthy to take
[53:18] the book John and tears he wasn't happy
[53:21] he was among hallelujah glory glory I
[53:23] know the book and I was in that book
[53:28] hallelujah his name is in that book yo
[53:32] your name is the word hallelujah you are
[53:35] part of that book so he won that book to
[53:38] be released so that he could go back on
[53:40] the earth praise God the caught up in
[53:42] that dimension but did not come back on
[53:45] the earth until that book is unfolded so
[53:48] John is correctly weeping he is crying a
[53:51] man filled with the Holy Ghost
[53:53] he is weeping because no man was found
[53:56] worthy to take the book but notice
[53:58] discovery read when the lamb took the
[54:00] book Oh John behavior change all in
[54:03] heaven all under the earth so therefore
[54:06] your worship will express to me express
[54:10] to us whether you have any revelation so
[54:14] when this is a very quiet the cow
[54:15] worship they're looking to look in the
[54:17] look and they know something is wrong
[54:19] because once you get a revelation that
[54:22] your name is on the book you have to
[54:25] behave the same way John behaved because
[54:29] there was only one Lord there's only one
[54:31] spirit there's only one baptism and
[54:34] there was only one behavior when you're
[54:36] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[54:40] Spirit there is only one behavior just
[54:44] like Mary near perumal just like pina
[54:47] Peru
[54:47] [Applause]
[54:55] this is a very important service this
[55:00] will separate seed from shock because
[55:02] seed gets in Revelation the Warnie Upper
[55:04] Room and if you can't worship you have
[55:06] no revelation because God is not coming
[55:09] down on dry one's not coming on top your
[55:11] head on top your memory end up in
[55:13] intellect God is coming on hats praise
[55:16] God that's why training up Aroon gotta
[55:19] understand them the Lord is God and He
[55:24] is calling me worship everything worship
[55:28] worship just worship the four beasts
[55:32] worship all under any upper room and
[55:35] they were praising God continually
[55:37] before the dynamic sale that was gonna
[55:41] be an old pawn of the spirit but before
[55:44] that come you have to break into
[55:46] Revelation fine
[55:47] [Applause]
[55:55] [Applause]
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:13] [Music]
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:21] hallelujah the devil does nothing to do
[56:36] the woman cell worship jesus said it is
[56:40] not fit the deterrence bread and classes
[56:43] of dogs sister worship
[56:45] you can't stop a believer oh my god I
[56:50] feel like pants and this more you cannot
[56:52] stop a believer
[56:58] :
[56:59] [Applause]
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:22] you know what this is yes is the Jubilee
[57:26] of the Seventh Seal or chlorine of God
[57:34] yeah breakin into the Jubilee put a
[57:37] Brenham said the church will leave you a
[57:40] shout him not morning
[57:43] [Applause]
[57:45] look nearer my God to thee not no solemn
[57:49] no believing a shout
[57:53] [Applause]
[58:05] [Music]
[58:06] my god it looked like somebody sitting
[58:08] in they look like some Gladys he is them

[58:14] name
[58:14] [Applause]
[58:23] you'll never see that praise God praise
[58:25] God
[58:26] [Applause]
[59:09] we're balanced said luminously capping a
[59:12] revival I love what God did
[59:15] so then when people run after some man
[59:17] the man however as a man they love the
[59:19] chose and whatnot they figure he is in
[59:21] Manatee or whatever that's the business
[59:23] he said that be revival has to come from
[59:26] the people so somehow this vision of God
[59:31] has to be transferred to you the people
[59:35] know no reason that God the church fell
[59:39] in the beginning the reason it fell is
[59:43] because the people takes the spirit and
[59:46] put it on a man and God say I did it
[59:54] [Applause]
[59:57] God said that the Prophet said God has a
[1:00:03] core of the audience
[1:00:05] you shall be my people and I shall be
[1:00:09] your God
[1:00:09] [Applause]

[1:00:28] lot I got hello you have no other gods

[1:09:50] person the mystery of God will be
[1:09:53] revealed and when that was completely
[1:09:56] revealed then the seven mysteries which
[1:10:00] is sometimes talked about will be open

[1:24:22] son but you're still a son might be a

[1:24:51] you got the engineer watching Ellen ball
[1:24:53] I'm a greenback God you know what I here
[1:24:57] for because that book is so important
[1:25:01] classic book that Adam had lost that's
[1:25:05] the book what the names are called all
[1:25:06] sons God would only call by his word so
[1:25:12] the word was in the book the book I'm
[1:25:16] lost the book the book went back in the
[1:25:18] hands of original owner and Jesus Christ
[1:25:20] came back down as the book version 10
[1:25:23] the book was there open though the book
[1:25:25] is being placed in sons to call the
[1:25:29] reception's sons calling sons
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:33] so he said as my father sent me so said
[1:25:40] not you the father that was sent him was
[1:25:43] in him or give the Lord a shout PC what
[1:25:46] what about to do to you he's about the
[1:25:48] tabernacle himself inside of you you are
[1:25:51] bought to become a house for God you
[1:25:53] become about to come at embers of God
[1:25:55] you become the Church of God you
[1:25:58] yourself
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:05] let me see that Christianity versus
[1:26:10] idolatry but a burnable
[1:26:13] no idolatry is a strange thing don't do
[1:26:18] the ages we've had it ever since the
[1:26:20] beginning of time now the order for this
[1:26:22] idol worship is the man sets up the idol
[1:26:25] fixes the idol then it goes in and
[1:26:28] prepares himself for this great worship
[1:26:30] now he believes this idol is made in the
[1:26:33] image of some God that he doesn't never
[1:26:35] seen he's without form so he believes
[1:26:38] he's in an image of this idol that he
[1:26:41] mixed it as God no don't let that leave
[1:26:43] you support a banana is bringing a point
[1:26:46] he said now the image is in the image
[1:26:50] image of the mythical God that he
[1:26:51] believes that is then it goes before the
[1:26:53] either prostrates himself and believes
[1:26:56] that the god that's unseen person comes
[1:26:59] down into this Idol and we believe that
[1:27:01] he talks to God to decide on that God
[1:27:04] brings himself into the idol and answers
[1:27:07] him back now many of you teachers here
[1:27:09] that took the mythology even those gods
[1:27:11] they had battles with one another they
[1:27:12] claim now in other words the God
[1:27:15] hypnotizes himself from this
[1:27:17] supernatural standing and then his idol
[1:27:19] speaks back to the worship but surely
[1:27:21] either and the worshiper in some kind of
[1:27:23] built up emotional sense believes that
[1:27:26] the idol speaks to him to his heart and
[1:27:29] he's forgiven of his sins whatever more
[1:27:31] which surely shows is the devil is the
[1:27:33] devil that does it
[1:27:34] listen is noted or just haphazardly do
[1:27:38] things these worshippers of idols
[1:27:40] some of them does but there's real true
[1:27:43] worshipers of those things for instance
[1:27:45] listen I could tell you stories of how
[1:27:48] those Devils in those ideas perform all
[1:27:51] kind of things make blood come out of
[1:27:55] things and everything else they were
[1:27:58] Sadie stone weeping virgin mary repin on
[1:28:00] these demons devils that they worship in
[1:28:03] making these things happen
[1:28:04] watch they are Devils were on Sonya now
[1:28:08] if you don't believe there's a real
[1:28:10] devil then you don't believe there's a
[1:28:12] god sure you've got to believe the
[1:28:14] contrary that there's a real devil
[1:28:16] and he's a person not a thought not a
[1:28:19] thought he is a person Nadia the
[1:28:23] teaching goes on that the devil just are
[1:28:24] either torture yet no it isn't the devil
[1:28:26] is a person the same people believes
[1:28:28] that the Holy Ghost is got a good
[1:28:30] torture get but to believe that the Holy
[1:28:33] Ghost is a missile it is the person of
[1:28:36] Christ and spirit for all the people
[1:28:40] saying that the Holy Ghost they off that
[1:28:43] is just that is just contrary teachings
[1:28:44] the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ
[1:28:48] in spirit form now let's go ahead and
[1:28:52] further now
[1:28:52] now these idolaters prostrating
[1:28:54] themselves for the idol believe that the
[1:28:57] God they are worshiping is represented
[1:29:00] in this Idol
[1:29:00] no you have no you got that the
[1:29:03] worshiper is not a hypocrite sis deep he
[1:29:08] is actually getting a hole or something
[1:29:11] that is in that Idol because it come
[1:29:16] back on him he does something and gets
[1:29:20] it from that Idol which is a myth God
[1:29:22] not a real one so they will have
[1:29:25] testimonies of what that Idol does to
[1:29:27] them and what they worship and does to
[1:29:28] them
[1:29:28] I want to church just for them they have
[1:29:30] answers they have witness they have
[1:29:32] confirmation they have all of that but
[1:29:34] it's Devils and many times have you are
[1:29:41] you ready the devil gets into those
[1:29:43] things and the devil get intermittence
[1:29:46] some time and impersonates himself as
[1:29:49] God I have seen this in my ministry now
[1:29:56] this is very deeper this is not skin
[1:29:59] look he said stay where the teaching has
[1:30:02] been taught here stay with this word
[1:30:04] don't you leave it you stay right with
[1:30:06] the word no matter what comes what goes
[1:30:08] stay with the world people say come to
[1:30:11] the altar with nine teachers blind
[1:30:13] teachers say just oh forget everything
[1:30:16] make a mind blank you'll become an
[1:30:17] Elijah you become this that the other
[1:30:19] what a lie that's open up your soul to
[1:30:22] all kind of devil spirits that get in
[1:30:24] don't do that
[1:30:25] you must remember there is a devil
[1:30:27] impersonate Christ to the letter almost
[1:30:30] so just because we can be emotional
[1:30:32] don't mean we are saved because we go to
[1:30:35] church don't mean we are saved
[1:30:37] aha that's a big one that's a big one
[1:30:41] when the church doesn't mean people said
[1:30:42] I see people in this message Christians
[1:30:45] support so-called Christians being so
[1:30:47] badly it's really disappointment really
[1:30:50] disappointed they want to know if these
[1:30:51] people are saved
[1:30:52] some of them don't even know that were
[1:30:54] sinners you know they they drop down
[1:30:56] Pino from heaven
[1:30:58] I'm satellite was it bring them down
[1:31:01] until the fall they in the pride and
[1:31:03] arrogance one is self-righteousness okay
[1:31:07] let's go on now because we got a church
[1:31:09] on me we are saved don't believe those
[1:31:11] enticing spirits a real Spirit of God a
[1:31:15] real Word of God is the truth of God
[1:31:19] which is the seed of God we will produce
[1:31:22] God in your life you'll be godly simply
[1:31:26] holy it's continued among a lot of
[1:31:30] people we find my emotions and so forth
[1:31:32] they become catalysts backbiting all
[1:31:36] kind of ungodly things but that is
[1:31:38] sulfuric acid in the church it is demon
[1:31:41] powers spirit of men and women who get
[1:31:45] among one another
[1:31:45] and try to push off and say this one is
[1:31:47] not right this one is not right that is
[1:31:50] not right and if you chase it down nine
[1:31:53] times out of ten is the very person
[1:31:55] making that still that's not right
[1:32:00] God hates discord among brethren
[1:32:06] be reverent be holy love God stand by
[1:32:11] him and as long as you know your life is
[1:32:13] giving up with the Bible with the purity
[1:32:15] of heart beauty of thought love towards
[1:32:17] your brother trying to have Bester up
[1:32:19] till the kingdom of God doing those
[1:32:20] things dressing right living right
[1:32:22] talking right who in the right places
[1:32:23] then you can have all the emotions you
[1:32:25] want and everybody will believe it
[1:32:27] anti seeing spirits going forth demons
[1:32:31] under disguises look we in the last days
[1:32:33] is the end time false spirits come in
[1:32:37] and begin to tell people this and the
[1:32:40] other we are broke up in the 900
[1:32:44] different nominations every one with
[1:32:46] different view we say they say we
[1:32:49] believe this period that's what we
[1:32:51] believe they can't let the Holy Spirit
[1:32:55] come in they can't have the right of way
[1:32:58] Gore got a bunch of people that can
[1:33:00] shout then everybody had to shout they
[1:33:03] got some to speak in tongues then
[1:33:05] everybody had to speak in tongues they
[1:33:07] got all like this till they become what
[1:33:09] absolutely listen contaminated with
[1:33:12] enticing spirits in Tyson's people to do
[1:33:18] these emotions when there is a know
[1:33:20] coordinate and all then they go and live
[1:33:23] any kind of life that is either live and
[1:33:25] call it Christian oh praise the name of
[1:33:28] the Lord so I say this because the
[1:33:31] correctly worship God you have to get
[1:33:35] rid of the religious spirits and the
[1:33:37] enticing spirits is that bushin going a
[1:33:39] bunch of noise and hallelujah glory

[1:37:10] on saving somebody a little or a shock
[1:37:12] see where you want to go I'm ducks when
[1:37:25] the church here we go
[1:37:26] it's grown in my under the persecution
[1:37:33] of the outside world believe in our Lord
[1:37:34] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:36] is just as real it was the past
[1:37:38] Pentecost so the only spirit that will
[1:37:42] try to make me holy was not as real is
[1:37:44] Sita
[1:37:46] if you could avoid and doctor Holy Ghost
[1:37:49] that is the devil what you have to
[1:37:53] believe is that the Holy Ghost is just
[1:37:54] as real just as they have it the same
[1:37:56] one pizza half that's the one you want
[1:37:58] the same one Mary got the one you want
[1:38:01] you don't want the new Holy Ghost you
[1:38:04] only seem Holy Ghost
[1:38:05] but Adam didn't come to know her but a
[1:38:07] new ting he came to terrorize back to
[1:38:08] the face of the father's because they
[1:38:10] had the real thing I will say in local
[1:38:13] balance the real McCoy they have the
[1:38:15] real thing so we have to go and pick up
[1:38:18] what they had here then we could go
[1:38:20] forward we can't go forward as long as
[1:38:22] we have pick up what they had because
[1:38:24] they had defeat Oh chlorine of course
[1:38:26] you have to go and pick up the hate to
[1:38:28] come and kind of connect the dynamics
[1:38:29] there we could call them to the
[1:38:31] resurrection when the brick down to the
[1:38:32] resurrection sitting alone
[1:38:35] because a brick in a time barrier not
[1:38:38] even get that stop you from sin and even
[1:38:40] death will stop this pride you pushing
[1:38:42] that aside you pushing that aside
[1:38:44] because you have resurrection power yeah
[1:38:46] rapture and faith inside of you you have
[1:38:49] translation fit inside of you or
[1:38:51] chlorine oh god this motor will put on
[1:38:53] immortality this corruption will put on
[1:38:55] incorruption we shall be changed or do
[1:38:59] you believe that I know you have that
[1:39:02] power you know Jim must have power it
[1:39:05] must have divine healing but I said how
[1:39:07] could we have feared for the rapture and
[1:39:08] we do our faithful sick to be healed
[1:39:12] the pink kidneys could be restored may I
[1:39:21] shake your faith a little bit but Ron
[1:39:23] said missing limbs would be restored
[1:39:25] missing limbs could you mind somebody
[1:39:31] missing a foot and what we saw that for
[1:39:33] he makes a channel he makes Hannah you

[1:41:12] so but like I said if I home and she is
[1:41:16] this no we sure potentially but he said
[1:41:19] when they are born and positionally born

[1:47:58] anywhere we can't whipped the
[1:48:02] Philistines why because people trying to
[1:48:05] take one on a position to tell somebody
[1:48:08] do this do this do this and do this
[1:48:09] if frame don't want to stay one em go
[1:48:12] over here we find - over there say oh my
[1:48:14] the Lord gives me a good cornfield and

[1:49:07] president America he wanted the position
[1:49:11] I wonder how we feel in them tough cold
[1:49:14] you fight you press you push and then
[1:49:17] again then oh they know so happen jesus
[1:49:26] said it nicely he said when you invite
[1:49:28] it they know what let's take the lowest
[1:49:29] seat because if it'll be higher seat
[1:49:34] when somebody more worthy than you comes
[1:49:36] in they have to tell you he had a good a
[1:49:38] back darling so he take the lower seat
[1:49:41] and then they can bring you up if you
[1:49:42] have to be positionally pleased you know
[1:49:45] oh this will help everything in this you

[1:50:04] oats is your patter is you ain't
[1:50:07] supposed to herd sheep when you're
[1:50:09] supposed to hit cattle God wants to
[1:50:12] place the church but every one of them
[1:50:14] warns to do the same thing so when you
[1:50:19] understand that you begin to feel
[1:50:21] comfortable and the castle of your skin
[1:50:24] in the calling that God has called you
[1:50:26] on to and nobody give you a fight with

[1:50:51] bless you tremendously
[1:50:58] so then Boris I can tell and not know
[1:51:01] nothing about it when I tell them devil
[1:51:02] goo teenager but but but but but but but
[1:51:04] Jake are behave not that but but you
[1:51:06] know one excuse the church here we go
[1:51:09] we're home - the church is supposed to
[1:51:11] be predestinated unto adoption of
[1:51:13] children where God can take a man here
[1:51:15] we go and adopt him in the family and
[1:51:18] give him something okay you understand
[1:51:22] that a doctor man give him something
[1:51:24] what are we supposed to do try first try
[1:51:28] that and see if it is right so it can be
[1:51:33] do ask no question you're questioning me
[1:51:36] gotta believe it believe what it in this
[1:51:40] time yeah I want to know what you have
[1:51:43] no hide it
[1:51:45] bring it we had to test it and try it
[1:51:49] because here what mom says the Bible
[1:51:52] said tried the spirits anybody come in
[1:51:56] this church I could try the spirit
[1:51:57] that's my right
[1:51:59] the try people's spirits to see what's
[1:52:01] inside of them
[1:52:03] that's the authority we have in the
[1:52:05] world the authorities try the spirits
[1:52:08] because many false praise come out
[1:52:10] really just first are you at me so this
[1:52:15] is somebody who claims to be adopted no
[1:52:16] one say don't take that just like that
[1:52:18] try it see if it is right watch this man
[1:52:22] claims a certain thing try it see if it
[1:52:27] is right if it is right move right with
[1:52:30] it and then say Lord send us something
[1:52:33] else
[1:52:34] keep moving then every fellow takes this
[1:52:37] place then you want to see the Church of
[1:52:39] God begin to get in this place then is
[1:52:41] when the Philistines will go to backing
[1:52:43] up the shorts will go off yeah will go
[1:52:45] down face it will be washed Singapore
[1:52:47] missing that's the church weakens and
[1:52:49] when the church begins they get in his
[1:52:50] mighty power and then we have announces
[1:52:52] the fire a few of them you will see that
[1:52:54] Holy Church stand together in its power
[1:52:56] positionally please the sons of God
[1:52:58] adopted in the family of God Church
[1:53:01] standing in his glory that's what he's
[1:53:03] coming forth
[1:53:05] hallelujah do you love him just a few
[1:53:08] more and we'd wrap up here now after
[1:53:11] you're in this land it doesn't mean
[1:53:14] you're free from war you still have to
[1:53:16] fight for every inch of grown Canaan
[1:53:19] didn't represent the great heaven
[1:53:20] because it's Wars and troubles and kills
[1:53:23] and fighters but it did represent this
[1:53:24] it must be a perfect walk oh I'm gonna
[1:53:27] skip down Oh blessed be the name of the
[1:53:30] Lord hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:53:33] thank you Jesus then he talked about a
[1:53:36] Econ who hide it and men died innocent

[1:53:44] behavior and then afterwards he says
[1:53:47] something is wrong they call a prayer
