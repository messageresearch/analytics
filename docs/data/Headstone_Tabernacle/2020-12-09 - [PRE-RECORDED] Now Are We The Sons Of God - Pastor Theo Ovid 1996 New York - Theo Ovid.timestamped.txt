[25:09] however the devil kept telling me to
[25:11] wait
[25:12] and i kept giving in to him while

[25:17] i wouldn't
[25:18] receive anything from god until i made
[25:20] everything right
[25:23] but i was still battling my pride
[25:26] then brother obado said that the lord
[25:28] had just spoken to him
[25:31] and that we shouldn't leave the building
[25:35] until we had made everything right
[25:38] i knew that god had spoken directly to
[25:41] me
[25:44] i overcame my pride and walked over to
[25:46] the brother
[25:48] and i asked him to forgive me and as he
[25:52] was hugging me the lord took over and
[25:54] totally delivered me
[25:56] there is nothing too hard for the lord
[25:59] [Applause]

[32:28] i truly believe that divine love
[32:30] filtered down inside of here last night
[32:40] amen
[32:43] and you know i guess many of you may
[32:45] think about
[32:46] what it was like when brother brown was
[32:48] here i think about it many times you
[32:50] know and
[32:51] sometimes i like to hear stories of what
[32:53] it was back there live
[32:54] and you know the testimonies and so on
[32:57] but last night was
[32:58] special i felt that that angel was
[33:01] was in the camp moving back and forth
[33:05] and it tells me that something
[33:06] tremendous is fixing to happen
[33:09] and oblato said it the tremendous
[33:11] victory
[33:12] in the love divine so
[33:15] today and from here on out i'm looking
[33:18] for that tremendous victory
[33:21] in love divine you know we are going to
[33:24] have it
[33:25] because god promised him hallelujah
[33:29] an unbelief doesn't stop god
[33:40] hallelujah glory no we are going to have
[33:43] divine love
[33:45] we are going to be a possessor of divine
[33:47] love hallelujah you believe that
[33:50] oh praise god so while you're standing
[33:53] if you have your bibles i'd like you to
[33:55] turn to
[33:57] luke 24 romans 8
[34:02] and 1st john 3.
[34:17] praise god reading from luke 24
[34:21] verse 49 and behold i send the promise
[34:24] of my father upon you
[34:26] by tarrying the city of jerusalem until
[34:28] he be endured powerful and high
[34:30] and as he let them out as far as the
[34:32] bettany and he lifted up his hands and
[34:34] blessed them
[34:35] and it came to pass while he blessed
[34:37] them he was parted from them
[34:38] and carried up into heaven and they
[34:41] worshiped him
[34:42] and returned to jerusalem with great joy
[34:44] and were continually in the temple
[34:46] praising and blessing god amen romans 8
[34:51] i want to read from verse 14 for as many
[34:54] as are led by the spirit of god
[34:56] they are the sons of god for you have
[34:59] not received the spirit of bondage again
[35:01] to fear
[35:02] but you have received the spirit of
[35:03] adoption whereby we cry our father
[35:06] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[35:08] our spirit that we are the children of
[35:10] god
[35:11] and if children then heirs ears of god
[35:13] and joint is with christ
[35:15] it shall be that we suffer with him that
[35:17] we may also be glorified together
[35:20] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[35:21] present time is not worthy to be
[35:23] compared
[35:24] with the glory which shall be revealed
[35:26] in us for the earnest
[35:28] expectation of the creature waited for
[35:31] the manifestation
[35:32] of the sons of god and from first john
[35:35] 3 reading from verse 1
[35:42] behold what manner of love
[35:50] the father hath bestowed upon us
[35:54] that we should be called the sons of god
[35:57] therefore the world knowed us not
[35:59] because it knew him not
[36:02] beloved now are we the sons of god
[36:05] but it does not appear what we shall be
[36:08] but we know
[36:09] that when we shall appear we shall be
[36:12] like him
[36:13] for we shall see him as he is and every
[36:16] man
[36:16] that had this hope in him purified
[36:18] himself
[36:20] even as he is pure may god a blessing to
[36:22] read him his word you may be seated
[36:26] be the name of the lord for title this
[36:28] morning
[36:29] now are we the sons of god inspiration
[36:32] the promise of the father
[36:35] blessed be the name of the lord praise
[36:37] be to jesus
[36:39] amen when the son of man commit shall he
[36:42] find
[36:43] the faith on the earth because the the
[36:46] faith has been restored back
[36:48] by malachi 4 that's what he was sent for
[36:50] he said it will take these divinely
[36:52] revealed mystery truths
[36:54] to turn the hearts of the turret
[36:55] literally back to the fate of the
[36:57] fathers
[36:58] and that fate was identified last night
[37:00] not just any kind of faith but the fate
[37:02] itself
[37:03] defeat that works by love so love have
[37:06] to come to the faith praise god
[37:08] amen hallelujah isn't that right
[37:11] of our message hearing recognizing uh
[37:13] he's talking about jacob
[37:15] and he said no a spiritual man any
[37:18] spiritual man today and spiritual woman
[37:19] that's elected
[37:21] predestinated of god to come to eternal
[37:23] life if they have to sell everything
[37:24] they got
[37:25] if they have to take their name off of
[37:27] every church book in the nation
[37:28] they still want that birthright it's the
[37:31] only thing that matters to them
[37:33] just get that birthright no matter at
[37:36] what
[37:37] level they have to come on if they have
[37:39] to get down at the altar and cry and
[37:41] boohoo
[37:42] if they have to run to the places and go
[37:44] back and make things right
[37:45] and give away everything they have and
[37:48] become a pilgrim and a stranger
[37:50] it doesn't matter they want the
[37:52] birthright that's all they're interested
[37:54] in
[37:55] the birthright don't blame them people
[37:58] they can't help it praise god we can't
[38:01] help it

[39:22] we know that you are begotten of the
[39:24] spirit i'll admit that
[39:26] but until you are born there's a baby is
[39:28] begotten in the mother's womb
[39:30] that's one kind of a life that's little
[39:32] cells twisting and kicking and jumping
[39:35] but when it is born he squeals out and

[40:12] it never screamed before
[40:14] to a new creature hallelujah born of the

[41:35] it's being born again oh man if you have
[41:39] been called from
[41:40] from darkness to light from death unto
[41:42] life
[41:43] from a formal intellectual conception of
[41:45] christ to a born-again experience
[41:47] and watching your life that it lays
[41:49] inside of things as a world aside
[41:51] and you stand for christ regardless then
[41:54] something has happened
[41:56] there is something in you hungering and
[41:57] moving like it wasn't jacob

[42:01] differently after that something a
[42:02] different you are change
[42:04] oh my hallelujah praise god
[42:08] now from the smirnion churches book he
[42:10] said now
[42:11] we are coming to the conclusion as the
[42:13] eternal logos god
[42:15] was manifest in the sun and then jesus
[42:18] dwelt the fullness of the goddess bodily
[42:20] and that eternal one was the father
[42:22] manifest in flesh
[42:24] and thereby gain the title of son even
[42:26] so
[42:27] we eternaliness thoughts in our turn
[42:30] become the many members spoken word seed
[42:33] manifesting flesh and those eternal
[42:36] thoughts
[42:37] no manifest in flesh are the sons of god
[42:40] even as we are so called we did not
[42:43] become
[42:44] seed by the rebirth we were seed
[42:47] and therefore reborn for only the elect
[42:51] can be reborn
[42:52] because we were seed we could be
[42:56] quickened
[42:59] hallelujah oh
[43:03] hallelujah my
[43:06] my mind oh hallelujah
[43:10] you are not now becoming seed because
[43:13] you are
[43:14] seed you could be reborn
[43:17] oh hallelujah glory
[43:21] thank you jesus he said we will also
[43:25] show you
[43:26] that there's a group of people whose
[43:28] names haven't been placed on that record
[43:32] before the foundation of the world
[43:34] cannot
[43:35] under any circumstances have those names
[43:39] removed
[43:45] the names under the blood section of
[43:48] that book
[43:49] under no circumstances
[43:53] no circumstances no trial
[43:57] no testing no tribulation no opposition
[44:02] hallelujah under no circumstances
[44:06] could those names be removed
[44:12] hallelujah
[44:19] hallelujah sealed those names
[44:32] oh hallelujah you may be seated
[44:35] praise god hallelujah how do you feel
[44:38] about you this morning
[44:39] i said now are we the sons of god oh
[44:43] hallelujah brother hallelujah
[44:46] we have got to see it present tense now
[44:49] say it
[44:50] is
[45:01] you may be seen it from souls in prison
[45:04] he came forth and took the book out to
[45:06] the right hand
[45:07] of him that sat upon the throne time was
[45:10] no more
[45:11] and immediately the angel appeared and
[45:14] swore
[45:15] that time was no longer but you see
[45:19] in this book was what was redeemed
[45:23] it was the book of redemption and
[45:26] everything that he had redeemed was
[45:29] written
[45:30] in that book
[45:35] so when the angel came down he brought
[45:39] your name
[45:47] hallelujah and no redemption present
[45:51] tense by power
[45:53] to break the dominion of sin
[45:56] that you can be redeemed by power
[45:59] and he said behold i send the promise of
[46:02] the father
[46:03] and you shall receive power
[46:10] present tense power
[46:17] carry in jerusalem until you be endured
[46:20] with power from on high
[46:22] you may be seated
[46:38] you may be
[46:43] that he died for was written in the book
[46:48] and he could not leave his militarily
[46:51] seat
[46:52] until he had thoroughly redeemed
[46:59] and he couldn't redeem it at the cross
[47:01] because they were predestinated in the
[47:03] lamb's book of life
[47:04] and he had to stay to make intercession
[47:07] until that last
[47:09] person was finished
[47:14] now he didn't say he's gonna halfway
[47:18] redeem you
[47:23] he's going to redeem you three quarter
[47:25] way
[47:26] you're going to have 50 deliverance
[47:30] 60 80 percent
[47:34] a hundred percent there's gonna be a
[47:37] total deliverance
[47:38] [Applause]
[47:44] oh hallelujah
[47:47] may you maybe see them
[47:51] oh man you maybe see them
[47:54] memorial letters the level he said now
[47:57] when the word
[47:59] see each group had separated over the
[48:01] interpretation of the word
[48:04] so when the word has no effect it's the
[48:07] traditional man being preached
[48:09] because the words supposed to be
[48:11] effective
[48:13] whatever words are preached is supposed
[48:15] to bring faith
[48:16] it's supposed to have effect upon the
[48:18] people and bring the holy ghost and
[48:19] bring the anointing
[48:20] and refillings and ceilings and so forth
[48:24] so if ministers is preaching what they
[48:26] claim to be the word
[48:28] and is of no effect it's tradition of
[48:29] man
[48:31] that's the same thing jesus found when
[48:33] he came here they had left the word
[48:34] and made a word of no effect by the
[48:36] traditions and that's what the groups
[48:38] have done today
[48:39] making the real full promise of god the
[48:42] real promise of
[48:43] no effect by their traditions just like
[48:46] my wife she has claims on me as a
[48:48] husband
[48:49] my daughter another woman female has no
[48:50] claims and me as husband i'm a father to
[48:52] her
[48:53] and then my grandson has no claims on me
[48:54] as father or husband
[48:56] he has claims on me as a grandfather i'm
[48:57] the same person so he come
[49:00] reveal himself as son of man that would
[49:02] be god the word
[49:04] that comes to the prophet and he was
[49:07] revealing the word to the age by son of
[49:09] man
[49:10] and in the church age he revealed
[49:11] himself a son of god the holy spirit
[49:14] through revelation has to reveal now in
[49:17] the last day
[49:18] it has to come back again to the word
[49:21] promise
[49:25] what is promised to the brag
[49:29] like brother jesse said last night
[49:30] exclusive bright promise
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:36] what is exclusively belongs to the bride
[49:39] the seven thunders wasn't set together
[49:41] church members critics skeptics make
[49:42] believers
[49:43] it wasn't said for that it's come to
[49:45] separate them from the bride
[49:51] hallelujah it came to bring a separation
[49:59] hallelujah that's why you are called out
[50:03] by the shouts amen you may be seen there
[50:08] oh my hallelujah praise
[50:12] god from god's covenant with abraham he
[50:14] said no we are sons of god daughters of
[50:15] god
[50:16] we are sitting together in heavenly
[50:17] places he said now present tense every
[50:20] man a woman or boy a girl
[50:21] has been born again of god and received
[50:23] the holy spirit is settled in heavenly
[50:24] places
[50:25] or where as many as two or three a guard
[50:27] amen promise to be in the midst
[50:29] now some people goes by feeling i am not
[50:32] saved because i
[50:34] feel like i'm saved the devil can beat
[50:37] you around that stump
[50:38] every day on that i'm not saved because
[50:42] i
[50:42] feel like i'm saved i'm saved because i
[50:46] met god's requirements
[50:47] god called me and i accepted it and by
[50:50] faith i believe it
[50:51] whether i feel good whether i feel like
[50:54] it or not
[50:55] i am anyhow because god said
[51:06] so
[51:10] hallelujah
[51:14] you may be seated jesus never said did
[51:17] you feel it
[51:18] he said did you believe it so it is
[51:20] based solemnly
[51:22] upon the finished works of christ at
[51:23] calvary so
[51:25] every redemptive blessing belongs to the
[51:28] believer
[51:29] so when you become a christian god gives
[51:32] you a checkbook
[51:33] with jesus name sign at the bottom of it
[51:36] and anything you have need of
[51:38] i am that i am hallelujah
[51:42] sign his name
[51:52] you may be seated you say are you afraid
[51:54] to cash it fill it out
[51:56] send it to the headquarters and see what
[51:58] god will do about it
[52:00] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[52:02] praise be
[52:04] to jesus so you say you might go to the
[52:06] hospital in the morning
[52:07] they say well your arm is still stiff
[52:09] your cancer is still there that wouldn't
[52:11] have one speck that wouldn't faze you a
[52:12] bit
[52:13] fate does anything no in you is god you
[52:16] have the holy ghost god is in you
[52:17] do you believe that no jesus said i give
[52:19] you power let me show you the weakness
[52:21] of the church by god's grace

[52:27] in my name they will cast out devils
[52:29] they shall speak with new towns i'll
[52:32] take they'll take up serpents
[52:33] they oh my think about jesus right here
[52:36] present tense
[52:37] speaking to his disciples and said
[52:39] nobody about me you are going to do it
[52:41] you are going to be there
[52:42] you are going to cast those devils out
[52:44] you're going to run them out the tongue
[52:45] you're gonna run them out your home
[52:47] you're gonna run them off your family
[52:48] you wanna speak a new tongue
[52:50] praise god if you take up any deadly
[52:51] thing it wouldn't harm you praise god
[52:55] oh man

[53:01] see you've got the holy ghost it's
[53:02] operating in your body
[53:03] well when that old snake grabbed a hole
[53:05] a poor hand there was not a bit of scare

[53:10] off in the fire and went on
[53:12] he got some more stick it didn't scare
[53:13] him you see if you're scared
[53:15] jesus said why did you fear and peter
[53:17] come walking in the water
[53:18] doing fine until he steamed the waves of
[53:20] contrary and then he got scared and
[53:22] began to sink
[53:23] and jesus come and pick him up and said
[53:25] why did you fear oh yeah a little faith
[53:27] fair you are scared it won't happen
[53:29] don't have one bit of fear

[53:33] do that
[53:34] until you have love and perfect love
[53:36] cast out all
[53:37] fear and when we love god with all our
[53:39] hearts souls and minds
[53:41] and we love one another as ourselves our
[53:43] neighbors as
[53:44] ourselves the people can actually
[53:47] feel that

[55:59] those seven voices come into one voice
[56:02] who am i oh hallelujah the voice of the
[56:06] archangel
[56:08] then the one with the weak white wig is
[56:10] here
[56:12] oh hallelujah praise god is another part
[56:15] of
[56:16] scripture that must be fulfilled to
[56:18] declare the day of vengeance of our god

[56:25] and that is promise friends it is
[56:27] promise
[56:29] an unbelief wouldn't in the head no one
[56:32] will stop it it will be
[56:34] oh hallelujah the same god that promised
[56:37] behold i sent you elijah there's the
[56:39] same god that said ephesians 4
[56:41] for god i'm set in the church through
[56:44] their labor pains
[56:47] prophet teaches evangelists
[56:54] hallelujah and the same god that brought
[56:57] forth elijah

[57:00] father promised that there will be a
[57:01] fightful ministry
[57:02] to pour the virtues into the church
[57:06] for it going to flow out
[57:09] then something must come in in order to
[57:12] flow out

[59:43] you may be seated so if you're married
[59:46] to christ
[59:48] christ is the word of god it's in john 1
[59:51] chapter 7 the beginning was the word the
[59:52] word was with god and the word was god
[59:54] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[59:56] among us
[59:58] now christ was the living word he always
[1:00:00] wants the word
[1:00:02] he still is the word he's always will be
[1:00:03] the word he
[1:00:05] he was only the manifestation of the
[1:00:09] attributes of god
[1:00:11] for he was the son of god and any son
[1:00:15] is the attribute of his father and just
[1:00:17] as you
[1:00:18] were in the genius of your father in the
[1:00:20] body of your father when he was a young
[1:00:22] boy you were in him
[1:00:23] yet he could not have fellowship with
[1:00:25] you because he didn't know you
[1:00:28] but then through the bedding grounds of
[1:00:29] a mother you were brought forth into the
[1:00:32] earth
[1:00:33] and become in the image of your father
[1:00:35] then he could fellowship with you
[1:00:37] and so were you sons and daughters of
[1:00:39] god
[1:00:40] before there was even a moon stars
[1:00:44] molecule you were sons
[1:00:47] and daughters of god for you are
[1:00:50] present tense you are only the physical
[1:00:54] manifestation of the attributes that was
[1:00:57] in god
[1:00:59] at the beginning
[1:01:08] you may be seated for there is only one
[1:01:11] form of eternal life and that was you
[1:01:12] before
[1:01:13] you don't know nothing about it neither
[1:01:15] did you know anything
[1:01:17] when you were on the earth earthly
[1:01:18] father but you were manifested in his
[1:01:20] image
[1:01:21] in the image of god you are made and you
[1:01:23] were manifested
[1:01:24] for the glory and the fellowship of god
[1:01:27] and therefore as sure as your genes had
[1:01:29] to be in your father
[1:01:30] before your natural birth your spiritual
[1:01:33] genes
[1:01:34] had to be in god because you are an
[1:01:36] expression of the attributes of his
[1:01:38] thoughts
[1:01:39] before the foundation of the world he
[1:01:41] said that's right that there's no way
[1:01:43] around it
[1:01:44] [Applause]
[1:01:47] hallelujah so elohim
[1:01:51] with all his thoughts could not
[1:01:53] fellowship with them
[1:01:55] unless they become expressed hallelujah
[1:02:04] mine so then he had to become jehovah
[1:02:09] god with his family
[1:02:14] you know how long you want that
[1:02:15] fellowship with you
[1:02:20] for the fullness of time to come to the
[1:02:23] fullness of the world
[1:02:24] to manifest the fullness of the body
[1:02:27] that he could come down in divine love
[1:02:28] in the cool of the evening
[1:02:31] speak amongst his people like he wasn't
[1:02:34] the kind of eden adam adam we're down
[1:02:41] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:02:46] hallelujah
[1:02:48] oh my you maybe see that praise be to
[1:02:51] jesus
[1:02:53] saw the father god and the father the
[1:02:55] pillar of fire hanging over israel
[1:02:58] my god they could see the pillar fire
[1:02:59] hanging over them they knew that was god
[1:03:01] you can imagine how they walked under
[1:03:03] that pill of fire
[1:03:04] pillar fire by night the cloud by day
[1:03:06] they knew that was god
[1:03:08] that was god in the fatherhood promised
[1:03:10] to one day become flesh amongst them
[1:03:13] so the pillar of fire had to be
[1:03:14] expressed in five senses
[1:03:16] so the pillar of fire take on a robe of
[1:03:18] flesh called jesus
[1:03:20] walk among them i was a comforter them
[1:03:23] the word
[1:03:24] made flesh
[1:03:27] [Applause]
[1:03:29] and that word brought comfort to them
[1:03:32] praise god could imagine the confidence
[1:03:34] they had once the master was
[1:03:35] wrong praise god when they had to pay
[1:03:38] their taxes he said go and get a fish
[1:03:40] and no other fish no other fish could be
[1:03:43] picked up but the one with the coin in
[1:03:44] it
[1:03:47] all the fish is swimming trying to get
[1:03:49] to that bit but that one fish
[1:03:51] because jesus knew where that fish was
[1:03:56] and he here still jehovah jairus to take
[1:04:00] you may be seated they saw him raise the
[1:04:02] dead
[1:04:03] they saw him fed the multitudes praise
[1:04:06] god five lords and two fishes
[1:04:08] he was a comforter to them you could
[1:04:10] among those brothers their face full of
[1:04:12] joy and
[1:04:13] faith because messiah spoken with them
[1:04:16] praise god so one day jesus stood back
[1:04:19] he said now listen
[1:04:20] hallelujah i will not leave you
[1:04:22] comfortless i would send you another
[1:04:25] comforter
[1:04:26] praise god i know i'm a comforter but i
[1:04:27] will send you another comforter
[1:04:29] but this time the world cannot receive
[1:04:31] him oh hallelujah hallelujah boy dwell
[1:04:34] it with you and shall be in you
[1:04:36] so he was prophesying to them and given
[1:04:38] them seed of that promise
[1:04:39] that was going to be failed inside of
[1:04:41] them because the full purpose of god was
[1:04:43] to bring back deity again in flesh
[1:04:46] not to organize a bunch of church and
[1:04:47] church confusion and church argument and
[1:04:49] minister's association that wasn't the
[1:04:51] purpose of god the purpose of god was to
[1:04:54] come down and flesh
[1:04:56] hallelujah that was the purpose of god
[1:04:59] amen
[1:05:00] oh hallelujah you may be seated praise
[1:05:03] god and
[1:05:03] i missed the comforter he said it here
[1:05:05] you would have comforted those galileans
[1:05:07] how they believed them how they loved
[1:05:08] them
[1:05:09] and one day they seen him go to calvary
[1:05:10] to hear them say little while the world
[1:05:12] seek me no more
[1:05:13] the son of man must go to jerusalem and
[1:05:15] be put into the hands of sinful men
[1:05:16] crucified and dying
[1:05:18] how could they stand there their hearts
[1:05:19] were broken they were depressed they
[1:05:21] were all in gloom
[1:05:22] how could they ever give him up because
[1:05:24] the word that the prophet that spoke in
[1:05:25] the words that the sages and
[1:05:27] all the great holy men back there but
[1:05:29] when they look what the promise he made
[1:05:31] i will not leave you comfortless
[1:05:33] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:05:36] pray the father and he will send you
[1:05:38] another comforter which is the holy
[1:05:39] ghost
[1:05:40] and he will abide with you forever even
[1:05:42] the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:05:44] cannot receive
[1:05:45] because it knowing them not it see them
[1:05:47] not now neither does it know him
[1:05:49] but you know him you know him because
[1:05:50] he's with you and he shall be in you
[1:05:52] and there it is now as long as how long
[1:05:55] he's going to abide
[1:05:56] forever and then what is the word of god
[1:05:59] what
[1:06:00] is our comfort today it is when we
[1:06:02] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:04] and the power of god living living god
[1:06:06] in us that's with the word of the living
[1:06:08] god we stand
[1:06:09] the word is made fresh now the same word
[1:06:12] that was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:06:15] has become
[1:06:16] our flesh he is with you now
[1:06:19] but he shall be in you
[1:06:26] therefore if we don't
[1:06:29] compromise that word and we stay right
[1:06:31] with it
[1:06:32] if we don't compromise it that same
[1:06:35] word living in you will produce the same
[1:06:38] thing
[1:06:39] that it did when it was made fresh
[1:06:41] because your flesh holds it
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:48] oh man hallelujah
[1:06:52] you mean your flesh hole in the living
[1:06:54] word itself that's right you maybe see
[1:06:56] that praise
[1:06:57] god oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:07:01] my my the greek said sir we would see
[1:07:05] jesus praise god that's what the world
[1:07:07] want to see amen they want to see jesus
[1:07:09] isn't that right
[1:07:10] and jesus told them from unveiling of
[1:07:11] god but abraham said yeah he said the
[1:07:13] greeks couldn't see him
[1:07:14] because he was hit from them in a human
[1:07:16] being
[1:07:22] he said except a corner with falls on
[1:07:24] the ground god
[1:07:25] revealed in the form of a man hid
[1:07:28] himself from their view
[1:07:29] they could only see a man but those
[1:07:31] predestinated seen god
[1:07:33] one saw a man the other one saw god
[1:07:36] it was god veiled in a human being
[1:07:40] making both of them right but your faith
[1:07:44] in what you don't see you believe anyhow
[1:07:47] god failed in a human being
[1:07:48] now the old testament praise god god was
[1:07:52] hit by a veil
[1:07:53] in his mercy seat isn't that right the
[1:07:56] people would come in and worship
[1:07:57] they know god was there they couldn't
[1:07:59] see him that pillar fire didn't appear
[1:08:01] anymore
[1:08:02] that pillar fire went behind that veil
[1:08:03] isn't that right no he was veiled behind
[1:08:05] what behind skin
[1:08:08] a badger skin behind the veil or when
[1:08:10] that veil was rent
[1:08:12] on the day at the crucifixion the veil
[1:08:14] that it was wrapped up in was rent
[1:08:16] on the same day of the crucifixion the
[1:08:18] whole mercy seat came into view
[1:08:21] now the jews cannot understand how that
[1:08:24] god could have mercy upon us sinful for
[1:08:27] people like we are they couldn't see
[1:08:29] this one who was given mercy
[1:08:31] because he was hid he was behind the
[1:08:34] mercy seat
[1:08:35] on the inside the skins hanging down
[1:08:37] covering him
[1:08:38] he must always be veiled he must be
[1:08:40] veiled this morning
[1:08:41] oh hallelujah he must always be fail
[1:08:44] oh my listen to this before if any man
[1:08:48] walked in behind the veil it was sudden
[1:08:50] death
[1:08:51] oh hallelujah why because sin was
[1:08:55] covered
[1:08:55] and not remitted oh hallelujah praise
[1:08:58] god one time
[1:09:00] if a man walked through that veil it was
[1:09:02] sudden that now is no
[1:09:03] is dead not to go through it if
[1:09:07] you can't break the veil of tradition
[1:09:10] break through that wall of the
[1:09:12] denomination
[1:09:13] to see god in his power it is dead
[1:09:17] in other words you've got to break past
[1:09:19] every church member spirit
[1:09:21] every lukewarm every call every formal
[1:09:23] you gotta break past the minister's
[1:09:25] association
[1:09:26] break past the critics break pastor amen
[1:09:30] hallelujah to see god in his glory isn't
[1:09:33] that right
[1:09:35] oh praise god you may be seated thank
[1:09:37] you jesus
[1:09:39] oh hallelujah now on the day of
[1:09:42] pentecost the word came
[1:09:44] i was in the form of the son of god and
[1:09:46] they began to organize in a nicer room
[1:09:48] and the first thing it went to methodist
[1:09:49] baptist presbyterian
[1:09:51] it organized traditions a man don't know
[1:09:53] where he stands but glory to god he
[1:09:55] promised
[1:09:55] in the last days what he would do he
[1:09:58] would show his word in plain view
[1:10:00] open to us again now as
[1:10:03] revelation 10 is revealed the mysteries
[1:10:06] of god is made manifest known
[1:10:08] as a seven seal book promise
[1:10:12] now let your faith in him who is the
[1:10:14] word
[1:10:15] cause revelation 19 he comes he is
[1:10:17] called the word of god
[1:10:19] he said break the denominational veil of
[1:10:21] education break the
[1:10:22] national vein of tradition break those
[1:10:24] veils that is handling from you
[1:10:26] break those veils of pride hallelujah
[1:10:29] praise god
[1:10:30] no matter phd if it's contrary to the
[1:10:33] bible break through that veil
[1:10:34] for we have crossed the riven veil we
[1:10:36] are on the other side now
[1:10:38] on the other side praise god and you
[1:10:40] will see if you will just do that
[1:10:42] break those old traditions and things
[1:10:44] and come to him
[1:10:45] you will see him standing the mighty
[1:10:48] conqueror
[1:10:48] the word promised for this age
[1:10:54] oh hallelujah
[1:10:57] praise god as you heard last night he
[1:10:59] conquered everything praise
[1:11:01] god hallelujah the hebrew hebrews 11
[1:11:03] those heroes of faith they were powerful
[1:11:05] they had great testimonies but we were
[1:11:08] waiting for that royal seed
[1:11:09] to have a showdown with death himself
[1:11:12] and when they hit that road and they hit
[1:11:13] that bell and they said get into the
[1:11:15] ring
[1:11:15] jesus was ready hallelujah praise god
[1:11:18] isn't that right
[1:11:19] hallelujah and when death stung jesus
[1:11:22] and he was going for that tongue
[1:11:24] hallelujah
[1:11:24] and satan was looking with all smiles to
[1:11:27] become champion
[1:11:28] after three days jesus punks back up he
[1:11:30] said i am the true conqueror
[1:11:31] and he punks him right out oh and he
[1:11:35] stands the mighty conqueror this morning
[1:11:38] oh hallelujah praise god amen
[1:11:43] oh my hallelujah glory you may be seated
[1:11:47] hallelujah
[1:11:48] so he told abraham unto his seed and i
[1:11:50] see that my given
[1:11:52] god forced the people to agree
[1:11:55] on what was already given past tense
[1:11:59] they were not even born here but he told
[1:12:01] him unto thee and thy seed have i given
[1:12:05] oh he told joshua from the river
[1:12:06] euphrates and so forth have i given
[1:12:09] he kept putting to them to what was
[1:12:11] already passed
[1:12:13] and jesus said when you pray believe you
[1:12:14] have received and you shall be sealed
[1:12:17] he said by his tribe you were healed he
[1:12:19] puts it on your
[1:12:21] to see if you would believe what he has
[1:12:24] already done
[1:12:29] hallelujah glory hallelujah
[1:12:33] you may be seated that's why you gotta
[1:12:35] ask job job i know you're going through
[1:12:36] a pressure but answer me
[1:12:38] tell me where i was down when i laid on
[1:12:40] foundation of the earth
[1:12:41] and the morning sat sang together and
[1:12:43] the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:12:45] he won the showed up he wanted to
[1:12:47] bring him onto that depression
[1:12:48] bring him under that frustration bring
[1:12:50] him out of that atmosphere and let him
[1:12:51] know he was up there rejoicing
[1:12:53] he was up there shouting and praising
[1:12:55] god
[1:13:00] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:13:04] glory so the word of god is already
[1:13:08] settled in the heavens
[1:13:09] the world is already stretched out so in
[1:13:12] every age you could go up and bring down
[1:13:14] the word a promise
[1:13:16] therefore john the baptist went up in
[1:13:18] his age and pulled on the voice of one
[1:13:20] crown of wilderness
[1:13:23] because isaiah spoke it isn't that right
[1:13:27] and that world was floating for a long
[1:13:28] time
[1:13:30] floating floating waiting for season and
[1:13:33] time
[1:13:34] to pick up with the right time body

[1:13:41] one crying a wilderness
[1:13:42] that word began to float oh hallelujah
[1:13:46] and one day john was walking in the wood
[1:13:48] pick up at him and everywhere he went
[1:13:51] that word was going through hallelujah
[1:13:54] because he was to be the voice of one
[1:13:56] crown in the wilderness
[1:14:12] oh you maybe see that oh my when he said
[1:14:15] a version shall conceive
[1:14:16] praise god that word was fruit and also
[1:14:19] hallelujah and that word was floated and
[1:14:21] mary
[1:14:21] coming from that will was that time body
[1:14:24] to connect with that floating word
[1:14:26] that prophecy that must be fulfilled in

[1:14:43] revival
[1:14:44] dynamics and mechanics praise god there
[1:14:46] will be
[1:14:47] manifestation of the sons of god

[1:15:13] floating
[1:15:14] the word was hanging over her isn't that
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:18] because she had to carry the prophecy of
[1:15:22] messiah
[1:15:26] praise god and there's a prophecy of a
[1:15:28] super church
[1:15:30] oh floating word there's a prophecy of a
[1:15:33] super race
[1:15:35] floating world there's a prophecy of a
[1:15:37] superbride
[1:15:38] floating world there's the prophecy of
[1:15:40] the sons of god
[1:15:42] floating world and that word must
[1:15:44] connect
[1:15:45] hallelujah you are going to be filled
[1:15:48] with the holy ghost floating word
[1:15:51] that prophecy going to connect you are

[1:22:14] oh man you may be seated
[1:22:18] oh praise god my god
[1:22:21] so this is the mind age and the battle
[1:22:24] is the mind
[1:22:25] praise god and to me god wanted to prove
[1:22:29] that he could find a people that could
[1:22:32] stay with
[1:22:33] floating word until it comes to pass
[1:22:37] and we could target them with the
[1:22:38] reproach of the word
[1:22:40] the reproach of baroness praise god
[1:22:43] because you're on the promise
[1:22:45] of the holy ghost you're on the promise
[1:22:47] of charity the bride's absolute
[1:22:48] you're on the promise of the divine love
[1:22:51] where the brahmana himself had to wait
[1:22:52] for his message
[1:22:56] and when he was approaching if he cried
[1:22:58] out where is that right then malachi
[1:23:00] foreseed where's that seed
[1:23:01] to bring the message he was looking for
[1:23:04] all them seven seals
[1:23:05] and when it broke he had a revival
[1:23:07] praise god the people come there and
[1:23:10] mine didn't know what he was talking
[1:23:11] about but he knew what he was talking
[1:23:12] about because the angel spoke to him
[1:23:20] oh man so god was
[1:23:24] testing you may be seated to see if the
[1:23:27] people would stay with every
[1:23:28] floating promise
[1:23:32] seven the thunderstorms seven demons
[1:23:35] give the bride fate
[1:23:36] seventeen assured about how to be pair
[1:23:39] wait till them seven thunders after the
[1:23:40] voice of that group can handle the world
[1:23:43] praise god every bridal promise
[1:23:46] to see if we would stay with it oh my
[1:23:50] praise god and got an angel take the
[1:23:53] book and eat it
[1:23:55] and then you could prophesy and speak
[1:23:58] back the very
[1:23:59] promises of god but listen to this from
[1:24:02] the mystical supernatural orange
[1:24:04] orange boro he say it's the attitude of
[1:24:07] the people
[1:24:08] that brings the results and that's the
[1:24:10] reason at pentecost
[1:24:12] they had to go to an upper room and pray
[1:24:16] until the holy ghost came because they
[1:24:18] got in one place
[1:24:19] and one accord it's the atmosphere that
[1:24:21] brings the results
[1:24:23] you believe that let every man and woman
[1:24:26] in this building this morning boy a girl
[1:24:27] get everything from their minds but the
[1:24:29] lord jesus
[1:24:30] and believe that he's standing present
[1:24:31] right now and you will see something
[1:24:33] happening that will cause headlines in
[1:24:34] the newspaper in the morning
[1:24:42] it's the atmosphere he said now
[1:24:45] so somebody said but abraham to prove
[1:24:47] it's the atmosphere you could take an
[1:24:49] egg and put it under a puppy and tie him
[1:24:52] down
[1:24:52] and it would hurt a chicken
[1:24:56] he said it's the warmth of the puppy's
[1:24:57] body that would hatch the egg
[1:24:59] it don't have to be under the hand it
[1:25:01] could be under the puppy it could be an
[1:25:03] incubator it's the atmosphere
[1:25:05] and it is the atmosphere that brings the
[1:25:06] miraculous and powers
[1:25:08] and powers of god among the people is
[1:25:11] the atmosphere of the people
[1:25:13] and when people get to a place they're
[1:25:15] reasoning wandering
[1:25:16] stewing thinking talk don't even know
[1:25:19] where to stand
[1:25:20] half of them are not even scripturally
[1:25:21] taught how can you expect the atmosphere
[1:25:24] to be right
[1:25:32] oh we're going to say something you may
[1:25:34] be seated
[1:25:36] you say now you go over to the dance one
[1:25:38] one man standing there and saying well
[1:25:39] no we don't know
[1:25:40] whether he wants to dance or not and
[1:25:41] this girl over and the music is playing
[1:25:44] near
[1:25:44] my god today what are atmosphere for
[1:25:46] that
[1:25:47] well that's not any different than a lot
[1:25:49] of atmosphere you go into church for
[1:25:50] service
[1:25:51] and the only thing to bring the right
[1:25:53] atmosphere then for dance is to put on
[1:25:55] your old music that makes dances and
[1:25:57] everybody thinking
[1:25:58] about a good time and whooping and so
[1:26:00] forth put the right kind of music on the
[1:26:02] piano the organ and everybody in the
[1:26:03] atmosphere
[1:26:04] the jesus there are going to meet
[1:26:06] everything that they have need of
[1:26:08] something will go to taking place
[1:26:11] atmosphere
[1:26:12] listen to this and that's the hardest
[1:26:15] thing there is to do
[1:26:19] to get the people in that atmosphere
[1:26:22] the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere
[1:26:26] of believing
[1:26:26] and the curses for that and that was the
[1:26:29] hardest thing to do
[1:26:31] to bring an atmosphere of expectation on
[1:26:34] a promise
[1:26:37] so it's fine to come and preach a nice
[1:26:40] sermon
[1:26:41] i may god bless his word amen that's
[1:26:45] fine
[1:26:46] but it's different to be striving
[1:26:49] to create an atmosphere of worship
[1:26:53] of praises of thanksgiving and this is
[1:26:56] what the brothers have been doing all
[1:26:58] these years
[1:26:59] because it is the atmosphere oh blessed
[1:27:02] be the name of the lord
[1:27:04] hallelujah glory
[1:27:10] you may be seated but if we could ever
[1:27:13] get a group of people together
[1:27:15] where there was genuine holy spirit
[1:27:17] atmosphere a sacredness a sincerity and
[1:27:20] worship
[1:27:20] and men and women sitting in there are
[1:27:22] god conscious
[1:27:24] and know that the great omnipotence of
[1:27:26] god is present
[1:27:28] ready to do all things without a shadow
[1:27:30] of a doubt it will even have an effect
[1:27:32] upon the unbelievers
[1:27:33] that is certain in this meeting evening
[1:27:35] you can never come into the atmosphere
[1:27:37] without something happening
[1:27:39] oh blessed be the name of the lord now
[1:27:42] from divine love phoenix he said now you
[1:27:44] have got to create an atmosphere
[1:27:47] and your faith will do it
[1:27:54] and you know what gives faith right
[1:27:57] seven thousand feet to do what to create
[1:28:00] an atmosphere
[1:28:07] so wherever the true revelation of
[1:28:09] seventh house is preached
[1:28:11] it will bring faith to create an
[1:28:13] atmosphere
[1:28:25] you may be seated my
[1:28:29] hallelujah thank you for message of
[1:28:32] grace it takes a humble heart
[1:28:33] dedicated to god to bring jesus christ
[1:28:36] into present tense
[1:28:37] oh my not by might not my power but by
[1:28:40] my spirit
[1:28:41] he said now in my travels i found two
[1:28:44] classes of people
[1:28:45] fundamentalists and pentecostal the
[1:28:47] fundamentalists positionally knows where
[1:28:49] they stand
[1:28:50] but they haven't got much faith in it
[1:28:52] the pentecostal has got a lot of faith
[1:28:53] but they don't know
[1:28:54] who they are and where they stand it's
[1:28:57] like a man got money in the bank and he
[1:28:58] don't want to write a check
[1:29:00] the other man can write a check but even
[1:29:01] got no money man now if you could get
[1:29:03] them together
[1:29:05] you'd rarely have it so if you could get
[1:29:08] real good fundamental fate amongst
[1:29:10] pentecostal people or fundamental
[1:29:12] doctrine among pentecostal people
[1:29:14] i'd like to see a meeting what a meeting
[1:29:16] would be when the
[1:29:17] people realize listen are you ready
[1:29:22] when the people realize that you are
[1:29:26] not you will be you are present tense
[1:29:31] right now sons and daughters of god
[1:29:46] you are pushing it way off to the
[1:29:47] millennium somewhere all the blessing
[1:29:50] it's right now we won't need divine
[1:29:53] healing in the millennium
[1:29:59] no is when we have it we won't be sons
[1:30:02] of god
[1:30:03] but now you are sons of god and joint
[1:30:06] heirs with jesus christ
[1:30:08] and everything that jesus died for at
[1:30:10] calvary
[1:30:11] is your possession brother satan don't
[1:30:14] like that
[1:30:14] and if the people would only realize and
[1:30:17] just be willing to take god at his word
[1:30:19] my god it's unlimited
[1:30:30] you may be seated oh god you can never
[1:30:33] exhaust god's love and mercy to you
[1:30:35] you say well i hate to bother you so
[1:30:37] much father
[1:30:39] he wants to be bothered
[1:30:44] don't never think that you could ever
[1:30:46] ask too much of god
[1:30:47] i believe the scripture said you have
[1:30:49] not because you ask not and you ask not
[1:30:51] because you believe not
[1:30:52] he wants us to ask and believe that our
[1:30:54] joy will be full
[1:30:55] he wants you to act abundantly ask for
[1:30:57] big things don't limit your faith to a
[1:30:59] little mustard seed fate
[1:31:00] get out there to some other kind of
[1:31:02] faith
[1:31:03] move out in big things big things is
[1:31:05] just as easy to receive as little things
[1:31:08] you just have to believe that's all
[1:31:14] so we can have a big revival brother oh
[1:31:17] hallelujah my god you may be seated
[1:31:22] my so when a man once catches that
[1:31:26] vision of the invisible god
[1:31:29] and knows that he is always present
[1:31:32] there is something that stabilizes that
[1:31:33] man's thinking
[1:31:36] it stabilizes his actions and in time of
[1:31:39] distress and trouble
[1:31:40] it will still make him look upward and
[1:31:43] above the things that are happening
[1:31:44] around him
[1:31:45] because he's looking to the unseen
[1:31:53] now abraham did not only see the unseen
[1:31:56] and the reason he believed it was
[1:31:57] because
[1:31:58] god said it and if we being dead in
[1:32:00] christ by abraham's seed and if the
[1:32:02] spirit
[1:32:02] was in christ dwell in us it does the
[1:32:04] same thing it takes every divine promise
[1:32:06] of god that's in the bible and call it
[1:32:08] present tense
[1:32:11] and rest itself there no
[1:32:15] from will become flesh he said no you
[1:32:18] can express it by mental conception
[1:32:20] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:32:24] god
[1:32:25] that you see it before it happen
[1:32:28] and express it in word form that word
[1:32:31] takes a whole and becomes material
[1:32:34] it becomes a taught express if your
[1:32:38] heart
[1:32:39] and your mind is so in filled with god's
[1:32:41] spirit
[1:32:42] until your thoughts become his thoughts
[1:32:45] then when your mind and your leader and
[1:32:47] your guiding becomes a direct place
[1:32:49] direct inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:32:51] that is moving your mortal being
[1:32:54] what kind of people should we be if the
[1:32:56] very
[1:32:57] holy spirit has you so embodied or
[1:33:00] empowered
[1:33:00] that you don't use your own thoughts you
[1:33:02] don't use your own mind
[1:33:04] you don't use your own opinion but the
[1:33:06] holy spirit has you so built
[1:33:08] until your thoughts and your being this
[1:33:10] god's spirit
[1:33:11] expressing itself to you what kind of
[1:33:14] church should we be
[1:33:15] what kind of people should it be this
[1:33:17] morning if this branham tabernacle this
[1:33:19] morning
[1:33:20] was so filled with the presence of god
[1:33:23] why you didn't even use your own mind
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:30] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:33:35] until the sons of god are led by the
[1:33:38] spirit of god
[1:33:39] and then when the human element goes out
[1:33:42] and the spirit of god fills that vacancy
[1:33:51] we are talking about god-powered
[1:33:54] god anointed spirit-filled
[1:33:57] world-living spirit-led
[1:34:00] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:34:04] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:34:06] god they are the sons of god
[1:34:11] oh hallelujah in the beginning was the
[1:34:14] word
[1:34:15] the word was with god the word was god
[1:34:18] and as many as receive him the word to
[1:34:21] them
[1:34:23] to them give he power
[1:34:27] to become the sons of god
[1:34:30] and the sons of god is attribute sons of
[1:34:33] his spirit
[1:34:34] that his sons like unto god the same
[1:34:37] life he had
[1:34:38] will be in the sons of god
[1:34:51] oh my you may be seated
[1:34:54] let's get on the home stretch here he
[1:34:56] said no you see what i mean
[1:34:58] then your thoughts will become words and
[1:35:00] words will become material
[1:35:02] and that's when the church is in its
[1:35:04] power he said i believe it's on a road
[1:35:06] when the church will be so wrapped in
[1:35:08] christ
[1:35:10] my god the whole is that why the holy
[1:35:12] spirit sweep down like that last night
[1:35:15] praise god to give a taste to give a
[1:35:18] witness to give evidence of that new
[1:35:19] land
[1:35:23] praise god that's why god to take off
[1:35:25] the prophet 1965
[1:35:27] because he knew we will make it
[1:35:32] we don't need bishop so-and-so
[1:35:37] hallelujah we don't need this man who
[1:35:39] walk with the prophet or talk with the
[1:35:41] people we don't need that we just need a
[1:35:42] promise
[1:35:44] and we have received the promise
[1:35:48] my i say unto you those voices are going
[1:35:50] to live
[1:35:54] hallelujah those seven voices will live
[1:35:58] there will come a living fate live in
[1:36:01] faith
[1:36:03] the courts that you'll be hearing second

[1:36:22] out
[1:36:24] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:29] thank you jesus you may be seated
[1:36:32] i believe it's on this road that when
[1:36:34] the church will be so wrapped in christ
[1:36:37] the holy spirit mankind saw away from
[1:36:40] themselves
[1:36:41] that they don't see themselves they
[1:36:42] taught is to serve god
[1:36:44] their thoughts move on they refuse the
[1:36:46] things of the world
[1:36:47] they move in the spirit live in the
[1:36:50] spirit
[1:36:50] move in the spirit walk in the spirit so
[1:36:54] fulfill the law of christ
[1:36:55] then the love of christ in the human
[1:36:58] heart
[1:36:59] moving in the holy ghost that great
[1:37:01] wonderful church
[1:37:02] will go forth with power and deity
[1:37:06] because deity will be revealed in human
[1:37:08] beings
[1:37:09] by the holy spirit bringing to past the
[1:37:10] thought of their mind
[1:37:12] oh my god hallelujah praise

[1:37:32] silvan go i don't have such as i have i
[1:37:34] give southern war
[1:37:40] the thought was in peter's mind for him
[1:37:41] to be healed
[1:37:44] hallelujah and he could say stand up and
[1:37:46] walk and the power was in the word
[1:37:56] in other words peter had the check
[1:37:57] already signed he just healed

[1:38:19] biggest

[1:38:34] devil has pulled over you
[1:38:36] no we are the sons of god not we will be
[1:38:39] we are now every redemptive blessing
[1:38:43] that the lord jesus died for is our
[1:38:45] personal
[1:38:46] property right now
[1:38:49] oh hallelujah every redemptive blessing

[1:39:23] and they shook heaven's door and god
