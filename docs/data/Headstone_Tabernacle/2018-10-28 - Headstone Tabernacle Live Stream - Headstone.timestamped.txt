[58:21] sign to us all that the bride is getting

[1:03:47] Thanksgiving amen and that's the reason
[1:03:50] we are here we're so happy to be back
[1:03:52] this morning and I'm so anxious for a
[1:03:57] part - Amen hallelujah how many were
[1:04:01] blessed last night praise this wonderful
[1:04:04] name
[1:04:05] you know I the Bible says in Proverbs
[1:04:10] you see a word in due season how good it
[1:04:15] is anyone can speak a word you know and
[1:04:18] is though but in due season how good it
[1:04:22] is and this is why I feel good because
[1:04:25] the word was spoken in season last night
[1:04:28] amen so therefore if you have any word
[1:04:31] in you you've got to feel good how good
[1:04:34] it is Amen I appreciate my good friend
[1:04:38] brother Theo but we all do
[1:04:42] amen
[1:04:45] hallelujah as I said last night he has
[1:04:50] taken time to from his very busy
[1:04:52] schedule to drop in and be a blessing to
[1:04:56] us from which we are so thankful for him
[1:05:01] too you know he leaves his family he
[1:05:03] leaves his church and just trying to be
[1:05:06] a blessing to God's people everywhere no
[1:05:12] one really knows really what a minister
[1:05:14] goes through there's a lot of mountains
[1:05:18] is a lot valleys but when a man of God
[1:05:22] is called
[1:05:23] God call men
[1:05:28] very different than just men but God
[1:05:32] called Abraham said he cannot even send
[1:05:37] a revival unless he has men ready to
[1:05:42] carry out that revival so therefore as
[1:05:45] sure as he has promised a revival he's
[1:05:49] preparing men to carried out a man and
[1:05:52] we all know there's so much has been
[1:05:55] spoken about the FIFO ministry and who
[1:05:58] is this and who was that brother Graham
[1:06:02] said if you love me call me brother man
[1:06:05] you see the fivefold ministry is the
[1:06:08] business of God amen
[1:06:10] God has put in a church some apostles
[1:06:13] teachers evangelists and so forth and
[1:06:17] you know he will anoint his men with a
[1:06:22] certain anointing that it will speak for
[1:06:24] itself I remember I had a very
[1:06:27] interesting conversation with a with a
[1:06:30] another brother one time and I we were
[1:06:35] debating whether this person should be
[1:06:39] called this and that the title was over
[1:06:41] they said you know if I said he is or
[1:06:45] he's not it doesn't make him any less I
[1:06:48] said my word doesn't make him bad God
[1:06:52] has put in a church amen
[1:06:55] and it'll speak for itself say Amen so
[1:06:58] we see the revival and the move of the
[1:07:01] Holy Spirit around the world is because
[1:07:03] God has trained his men amen through the
[1:07:07] fire through the struggle through the
[1:07:11] battles and that is all to mold
[1:07:15] character because he wants one day to
[1:07:19] put his men in position
[1:07:23] and we realize without you no power
[1:07:27] without character what would we do look
[1:07:31] like Joseph Amen he come out finally out
[1:07:35] of the prison and he was even we see him
[1:07:38] in the next scene on the right hand of
[1:07:41] Pharaoh he had power but he had to meet
[1:07:46] his brethren he could have now if he
[1:07:50] acted any other way the history of the
[1:07:55] Bible certainly would have been very
[1:07:58] different today but I believe with all
[1:08:03] my heart he went through all that he had
[1:08:05] to go through for a purpose to mould
[1:08:08] character amen amen
[1:08:11] before because he could have done great
[1:08:13] damage to his family but when he
[1:08:16] recognized his family you know what did
[1:08:18] he do he he sob and he cried and he saw
[1:08:22] how can I have anything against you I
[1:08:24] mean I mean the whole thing was a plan
[1:08:27] anyway you didn't know it was a plan I
[1:08:28] didn't even know it was a plan but God's
[1:08:30] purpose will be fulfilled Amen even if
[1:08:34] there are many things that we don't even
[1:08:36] know I'm going to tell you something God
[1:08:39] is leading us somewhere but before we
[1:08:42] arrived we've got to go through certain
[1:08:44] things we've got to go through certain
[1:08:47] problems we've got to go to certain
[1:08:49] fiery trials and we wonder why why why
[1:08:53] is because amen well Joseph remain in
[1:08:57] jail not one day longer a one day
[1:09:02] earlier until God knew that he was ready
[1:09:06] so don't try to rush God out of your
[1:09:10] trial
[1:09:11] he knows when to take one and when to
[1:09:14] call you out Amen praise God so I
[1:09:17] appreciate these God called men and I
[1:09:19] want to on behalf of the church here
[1:09:23] apologize for I think we had some
[1:09:26] technical difficulties with the
[1:09:28] streaming online I think the sound went
[1:09:34] off about 3/4 into the message or so but
[1:09:38] we got the entirety but we copied the
[1:09:42] DVD so it's I'm going to send it to
[1:09:45] brother Isaac to have them put about to
[1:09:47] put it up on the on YouTube and we are
[1:09:49] committed now to really upgrade our
[1:09:53] system to make sure that these things
[1:09:55] don't don't happen again because the
[1:09:58] world is dying the world is longing for
[1:10:02] reality for so long we have heard so
[1:10:05] many is it so many wonderful messages
[1:10:08] you know it's blessed us but at the end
[1:10:10] of the day the life has got to end up in
[1:10:16] you
[1:10:20] and I I was so blessed when brother Theo
[1:10:23] was sharing with me about a message that
[1:10:30] was preached by a minister about power
[1:10:32] power and for the very beginning in
[1:10:38] Genesis as long as God was in the human
[1:10:45] heart and that man was given power over
[1:10:49] the elements over whatever
[1:10:55] you see but today everybody wants power
[1:11:00] but what is lacking is that man on the
[1:11:03] throne that's the only way anything
[1:11:07] outside of that is his control its
[1:11:09] control control control you control that
[1:11:11] control this church control that jerk
[1:11:13] you can't go you know people become
[1:11:16] members of church and they they check in
[1:11:19] and they can't get out
[1:11:20] that's not God's church amen the Church
[1:11:24] of the Living God is free with one body
[1:11:26] praise the Lord and love one another
[1:11:29] so with that revelation you see the
[1:11:32] power will be there I believe in the
[1:11:37] church and in the manifest manifests his
[1:11:40] sons of God but we must remember the key
[1:11:43] thing you'll have Authority and you'll
[1:11:46] have power and you'll have control as
[1:11:49] long as he is in your throne that's the
[1:11:53] way it was in the beginning anything
[1:11:55] else outside of that was not so from the
[1:11:59] beginning praise this wonderful name god
[1:12:02] bless you richly so I want to welcome
[1:12:04] you off to the original faith Gospel
[1:12:07] Tabernacle we are a small Church here in
[1:12:09] New York where we love the Lord Jesus
[1:12:12] and doing our best to hold the banner up
[1:12:16] high of his endtime message this is a
[1:12:21] big city and we all know that people
[1:12:26] often say here we live to work and work
[1:12:30] to live
[1:12:32] very
[1:12:35] few moments to really take a breath and
[1:12:38] pull aside and to just think about the
[1:12:44] things of God and things like that but
[1:12:46] we in New York is we're tough we have to
[1:12:50] be tough if not then the devil really
[1:12:53] will take advantage and I think the
[1:12:56] bride today we have got to have an
[1:12:59] attitude Devlin I'm sick of you I mean
[1:13:04] the devil bombard you with thoughts mind
[1:13:07] battles all kinds and we don't say

[1:27:17] amen god bless you you may be seated
[1:27:20] or praise the name of the Lord well I
[1:27:24] will say I'm strange groans I'm going to
[1:27:27] strike something I never did before and
[1:27:29] then we preach it in my church I got
[1:27:31] something since I've only 18th of July
[1:27:33] and I knew I felt that this is to be
[1:27:37] spoken here so I kept it like a little
[1:27:39] treasure chest and I'm open that chest
[1:27:42] and this morning I'm gonna speak in it
[1:27:45] and the title is the tilde well strange
[1:27:50] typer
[1:27:51] the to it well the subject disputed
[1:27:55] rights they come an inspiration crossing
[1:27:57] Jordan by the spirit of forgiveness into
[1:28:00] the land of Ephesians oh praise the name
[1:28:04] of the Lord crossing Jordan by the
[1:28:06] spirit of forgiveness in the land of
[1:28:08] Ephesians and and Paul prayed the prayer
[1:28:11] in Ephesians for this cause I bow my
[1:28:13] knees in to the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:28:15] Christ from the whole family in heaven
[1:28:17] and his name that he would grant you
[1:28:19] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:28:21] be strengthened with might in his spirit
[1:28:24] in the inner man saying as the inner man
[1:28:26] is a autumn an but he want you to be
[1:28:28] strengthened in the inner man that
[1:28:30] Christ may dwell in your hearts by feet
[1:28:32] and that he be rooted and grounded in
[1:28:34] love may be able to comprehend with All
[1:28:37] Saints what is the breadth the length
[1:28:39] the depth the height at the little love
[1:28:41] of Christ which passeth knowledge that
[1:28:42] he will be filled with the fullness of
[1:28:45] God filled with the fullness of God
[1:28:47] praise God and to know the love of
[1:28:51] Christ which passeth knowledge and all
[1:28:54] my my knowledge shall increase but we
[1:28:57] have to get into the love of Christ
[1:28:58] which passeth knowledge is not right
[1:29:01] because we could know all things we
[1:29:03] could know all mysteries but if we don't
[1:29:04] have this charity we are nothing and
[1:29:07] this is what I referred to last night
[1:29:09] dear Jesus but I'm praying from a man
[1:29:11] running from the President the Lord you
[1:29:12] said help us tonight in these few words
[1:29:14] as we wait upon thee and we pray that
[1:29:17] your grease and moosie will be with us
[1:29:19] and tender hearts move back the shocks
[1:29:21] the thorns the t-cells let the Blessed
[1:29:23] sunshine of God falling upon the word
[1:29:26] Lord and may be of such a meet until
[1:29:28] there will not be an unsaved person
[1:29:29] among us all the children will be in the
[1:29:32] kingdom of God
[1:29:33] unlike seen that word kingdom it just
[1:29:36] raises you above this church thing
[1:29:38] well glory to God he's not right the
[1:29:41] kingdom of God
[1:29:42] doors without a baptism of the Spirit
[1:29:44] may they receive it father here we go
[1:29:46] may all the great mysteries that we are
[1:29:49] supposed to know at this age Lord be
[1:29:52] unveiled to us that we that we will see
[1:29:55] the plainness of God so that we know how
[1:29:58] to behave ourselves and act correcting
[1:30:03] ourselves and bring in the members of
[1:30:05] our body into the discipline of the word
[1:30:07] that we might know how to live in this
[1:30:10] present day at the apportion of the Lord
[1:30:12] Jesus so the purpose of the ravine of
[1:30:14] the mysteries wasn't the education
[1:30:16] wasn't the information was for us to
[1:30:19] seek this is God to see the cleanness of
[1:30:21] God to bring you into our God
[1:30:23] consciousness because remember we lost
[1:30:25] our block consciousness because we were
[1:30:27] born in sin shape mean akuti like we
[1:30:30] said there's children born into monarchy
[1:30:32] in England they are born into a certain
[1:30:34] environment they have to take the child
[1:30:36] and place the child and groom the child
[1:30:38] in that environment then the chance
[1:30:40] consciousnesses I'm royalty so when they
[1:30:42] only come on a truck chariots the
[1:30:46] chariot on day I don't know what I call
[1:30:48] the carriage and so on and people we
[1:30:50] even they expect that if nobody waved
[1:30:54] the horn will miss my royalty can always
[1:30:58] this is a princess and a princess that
[1:31:00] nobody really know even anybody want to
[1:31:02] weave and flat so that is what is
[1:31:04] supposed to do because that's royalty
[1:31:06] but you are royalty that is what you
[1:31:10] come here to get into a consciousness
[1:31:11] and awareness and that's a restless
[1:31:14] night the Bible said you shall know as
[1:31:15] you unknown think about that now you
[1:31:19] shall know as you unknown you don't know
[1:31:21] yet what God know about
[1:31:23] but one day you're gonna know as you are
[1:31:26] known or glory to girl
[1:31:29] beseech you exactly but then since the
[1:31:32] face be knowing that we prophesy that
[1:31:35] but when that which is causing has come
[1:31:38] a perfect realization Oh mayor come from
[1:31:42] where you're going who you are and who
[1:31:45] you are take the Lord a shout so the
[1:32:00] message is to come out of and going into
[1:32:01] that's what it's all about
[1:32:03] many people come up and add you come
[1:32:06] with him and first with quotes come home
[1:32:09] and first of all another like was
[1:32:11] preaching some time I'm stalking about
[1:32:13] David and his brothers and David now
[1:32:15] come he father selling some food for his
[1:32:18] brothers and so on
[1:32:19] so David get there and they trying to
[1:32:20] embarrass leave it they tried to tell
[1:32:22] him dissing in perhaps even the most
[1:32:25] certain gula had his order now empty we
[1:32:27] could talk mr. Porter with me
[1:32:32] Bill Haas they send me a man deal but
[1:32:36] good luck
[1:32:36] I am not shoot but they heard they're
[1:32:41] trying to discredit David belittle David
[1:32:44] he's a qualified for the army and David
[1:32:46] is the man to defeat Goliath because
[1:32:48] they even have a backside of the desert
[1:32:50] experience that is unknown to the
[1:32:52] minister Association
[1:32:54] hallelujah they were on a backside of
[1:32:57] the desert experience that's the main
[1:32:59] room to everybody else all the offers a
[1:33:01] simple testimony when I was seen about
[1:33:03] the Sheep a beer King and I dealt with
[1:33:06] him and the lion came and I dealt with
[1:33:08] him and that kid out there that giant
[1:33:11] order he lost in his head another Imam
[1:33:14] ashore you have the testimony of Jesus I
[1:33:17] have the spirit of prophecy I'm anointed
[1:33:20] the bossy side because God is with me Oh
[1:33:23] hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[1:33:26] and as well as you know God is with you
[1:33:27] you saw it speak on this soil let your
[1:33:32] stats be off a lorry so that is what
[1:33:40] retention is coming out up and going
[1:33:42] into no watch oh my moreover that's okay
[1:33:46] I'm in the spirit hey men the fivefold
[1:33:49] ministry is not just fine for ministry
[1:33:51] these are not men on carts on chair
[1:33:53] force is here the fight won't unify for
[1:33:55] that's not God people read what is for
[1:33:57] the faithful ministry is for the
[1:34:00] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:34:03] the ministry till we all come that's the
[1:34:07] final one I get to till we all come all
[1:34:11] of us coming into the unity of the faith
[1:34:13] into the notice of God unto a perfect
[1:34:16] man unto the stature of your measure you
[1:34:20] are going to measure of the entire
[1:34:21] structure or glory of God so all these
[1:34:24] positions and God just like government
[1:34:27] it have a prime minister would have a
[1:34:28] president without members of

[1:34:42] collecting garbage he feeling let not
[1:34:44] the kind of garbage New Yorker be home
[1:34:46] extinct so we need everyone to be in

[1:45:14] doesn't make sense don't use it by
[1:45:15] oculus and same way look at real good
[1:45:18] let's check the map okay let's check
[1:45:19] these books and these tips and Sonia

[1:45:43] across Jordan there's a spirit swept
[1:45:45] across Jordan there's something that
[1:45:47] will kill you got Jordan represents dead
[1:45:53] so the ought against a husband your wife
[1:45:55] your cheering a family anybody Krista
[1:45:57] the deacon the elder Minister D past or
[1:46:00] whatever you have a drop that is not a
[1:46:02] verbal thing we're talking about
[1:46:03] dropping and you know you know you know
[1:46:05] how to drop that off to all of these
[1:46:06] woods it's dropped when the spirit of

[1:46:13] free then you could see the person will
[1:46:15] get enough right at one time I wanna
[1:46:22] know if I thought negative I want to

[1:46:29] sorry doc it means it
[1:46:34] see because you see you don't want that
[1:46:36] you want clarity in your spirit and you
[1:46:38] will see why to be a channel of charity
[1:46:41] and that's why brotherly kindness you
[1:46:43] could feel with that but but the
[1:46:45] kindness is the platform for charge it
[1:46:48] come upon because faith is based upon
[1:46:51] forgiveness
[1:46:52] so all this tuna heart back to the faith
[1:46:54] of the fathers and your grumpy mean and
[1:46:56] nasty how long that could be defeat that
[1:46:58] was given under disease that can't be

[1:47:14] spirit that's brotherly kindness
[1:47:15] proposal upon the bride before the
[1:47:18] charge is splitted into a manifestation
[1:47:20] because the strength of God has to be
[1:47:22] borne listen into manifestation did you
[1:47:26] hear that Jesus born grow up and he came
[1:47:29] to maturity and he came into
[1:47:31] manifestation by coming to identify the
[1:47:33] book and say the spirit upon me and he
[1:47:35] become do the words of God when strength
[1:47:37] of God have to be born with the
[1:47:38] manifestation oh so we are promised
[1:47:42] another Ephesians it's pretty clear in
[1:47:45] the scripture and if I believe we are
[1:47:47] living in Ephesians
[1:47:48] [Music]
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:48:12] word we are going to understand it
[1:48:15] because it will come and efficiency it
[1:48:17] so you would not in others
[1:48:19] you're not supposed to be confused by
[1:48:21] any promise to live for that is there
[1:48:26] were 40 plus years william branham have
[1:48:28] coming in earth there should be no
[1:48:29] confusion there's a big charity of mine
[1:48:31] and purpose and vision after what we're
[1:48:34] looking for we are looking for dynamics
[1:48:36] to our mechanics not as dynamic scrutiny
[1:48:39] air to your mechanics you become caught
[1:48:42] mechanics you become classic what
[1:48:44] machinery you become palpable body and
[1:48:47] the dynamics coming down to pick you up
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:51] [Applause]
[1:48:56] [Music]

[1:49:11] off you see the separation caught brick
[1:49:15] to us and see use in the back of the
[1:49:16] book
[1:49:16] let us enter into this great place now
[1:49:18] for Joshua divided to the people the
[1:49:21] inheritance that God has left them
[1:49:23] Joshua had to take three things to do
[1:49:25] cross over Jordan fight conquer the land
[1:49:29] and divine you cannot be valid if driver
[1:49:32] conquered it is already apportion come a
[1:49:36] ticket up you can't do that you have to
[1:49:39] literally conquer the land and then as
[1:49:42] that people just cautious cautious and
[1:49:44] then King kept coming in front they said
[1:49:46] listen I come to talk on everybody
[1:49:47] behalf I come to talk about my mountain
[1:49:51] and the tribe I don't my anybody else I
[1:49:54] just want what God promised me and Caleb
[1:49:57] step forward and afterwards because I
[1:49:58] don't make the claims hallelujah give me
[1:50:01] the book the one said take the book I
[1:50:03] love that I love that
[1:50:04] but once again need a book get the book
[1:50:07] and eat the book Oh hallelujah God
[1:50:10] requires a Jordan in every life or you
[1:50:13] believe that and there's approach across
[1:50:15] Jordan I believe that is really the
[1:50:17] spirit of forgiveness
[1:50:19] and got a lo a lot of things to happen
[1:50:21] to test our attitudes to see how we will
[1:50:24] make out and so on like that oh my oh my
[1:50:27] oh my

[2:12:35] believe that is what the work of the
[2:12:38] Holy Spirit II among the church is
[2:12:40] trying trying to place in the church
[2:12:42] positionally apostles and and teachers
[2:12:45] and prophet so forth and we have seen
[2:12:47] here we go
[2:12:48] many false alarms go forth among the
[2:12:51] people which only vindicated indicated
[2:12:54] real genuine adoption whether had not
[2:13:00] before salon for adoption
[2:13:03] listen listen remember which last night
[2:13:05] about royalty and so listen the program

[2:13:29] church correctly God will do not a man
[2:13:33] picking man man choosing man God sets in
[2:13:38] the church not some man set in the
[2:13:41] church
[2:13:41] okay so God replaced in his church
[2:13:43] correctly apostles prophets teachers
[2:13:45] evangelists not man-made cemetery button
[2:13:48] is important but calmly please into the
[2:13:51] church not tlz run overs and overnights
[2:13:53] but call police in the truth as God has
[2:13:55] chosen as the holy ghost has treated oh
[2:13:58] my hallelujah please Peter Jesus Oh
[2:14:02] hallelujah love him oh my my mind there
[2:14:07] are three stage of the journey we went
[2:14:08] good pitch 30 not the 30 just as
[2:14:12] something more Peter sorry all right
[2:14:14] there are three stages of the journey
[2:14:15] and there are treaty that is Jenny but
[2:14:17] we are justified by faith believing on
[2:14:19] the Lord Jesus
[2:14:20] and so that Israel in the wilderness
[2:14:22] Joonas no place of rest traveling night
[2:14:24] and day fallen a pillar of fire but
[2:14:26] finally they come to the promised land
[2:14:28] with this settle down Israel had not
[2:14:31] received their promise but they were on
[2:14:33] their journey
[2:14:33] so what can't give inheritance on your
[2:14:36] journey the journey is like a wilderness
[2:14:41] walk talk and life you could only get
[2:14:44] your inheritance in the land that is why
[2:14:46] jewelry we could tell them when your
[2:14:48] point in the land take my bones with you
[2:14:50] don't leave it here put it in that land
[2:14:54] oh praise God amen hallelujah
[2:14:57] you love it praise God Saban says but
[2:15:00] the believers and the killin was just
[2:15:01] outfit that was going on to the promise
[2:15:03] they move over into the land and took
[2:15:05] the land as a possession let's not go on
[2:15:08] to the back to the Holy Spirit let's not
[2:15:10] stop it even Lord Jesus being baptized
[2:15:12] but we wanted up
[2:15:17] [Music]
[2:15:33] world believed in our Lord Jesus yet if
[2:15:36] we have to go that the promise of the
[2:15:38] Holy Ghost is just as real as it was
[2:15:40] stood with Pentecost hold a groan and
[2:15:42] cry under labor pains but when they are
[2:15:44] born and positionally born into the
[2:15:47] kingdom then God has set in the church
[2:15:49] apostles and prophets and son like that
[2:15:50] oh praise the name of the Lord glory dog
[2:15:54] or demon God is trying to please his
[2:15:58] church and position to manifest himself
[2:16:01] manifest himself
[2:16:02] so all these sermons and teaching like
[2:16:05] you know people like to talk about
[2:16:06] teachers and teachers and their
[2:16:07] preachers you know the speechless sinner
[2:16:09] and an evangelist to talk to his sinner
[2:16:12] and teachers does positionally please
[2:16:13] the believer and I ask myself what are
[2:16:15] the believers being pleased for you have
[2:16:19] to be pleased for power so it comes
[2:16:21] right back to the spirit it's not just
[2:16:23] teaching to be taught and preached and
[2:16:26] evangelism this endtime is not irregular
[2:16:28] evangelism he save angel' itll is
[2:16:30] shipping stones so evangelists endtime
[2:16:34] evangelism is not regular evangelism
[2:16:35] endtime evangelism is cotton and
[2:16:38] shipping you to fit into God's program
[2:16:40] that is what that is about
[2:16:42] so God is trying to place his church a
[2:16:45] position to manifest himself getting one
[2:16:48] you can work through like this and say
[2:16:49] dance my spirit flowing freely adopt him
[2:16:53] please and manifest and take him out
[2:16:55] there and visit him with an angel tell
[2:16:57] him

[2:54:29] we can't help but worship we can't help
[2:54:33] but shout give the word I have no praise
[2:54:36] what can we say this morning we
[2:54:39] appreciate the service and now we have
[2:54:42] some technical challenges but the devil
[2:54:44] is a liar at that word that was spoken
[2:54:47] can never return for it that would now
[2:54:50] listen when Jesus was here there was a
[2:54:54] Centurion that came to Jesus you know
[2:54:56] the story he said my servant is sick but
[2:55:00] I recognize that when I say to one go he
[2:55:03] goes and if you see the wood you just
[2:55:06] need to speak the word you don't even
[2:55:07] need to come to my room now where the
[2:55:10] servant was located
[2:55:11] he couldn't physically hear what was
[2:55:13] spoken but because the word was spoken 1
[2:55:16] the word leaves the Mount of God it must
[2:55:18] produce the purpose for which it was
[2:55:20] intended so even though we lost the
[2:55:23] connection from time to time the word
[2:55:25] that was spoken is still on target every
[2:55:28] single time every one of prophecy we
[2:55:31] were not here when the Prophet was here
[2:55:33] but every one he spoke is till dead on
[2:55:36] target that's why we could say in the
[2:55:38] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:55:41] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[2:55:44] of God should be finished hallelujah
[2:55:47] - why I'm not worried about your
[2:55:50] children I'm not worried about your
[2:55:52] loved one because this word cannot
[2:55:54] return for it it must accomplish the
[2:55:58] purpose that court intended hallelujah
[2:56:02] even before we close out we do have some
[2:56:06] notes of praises and a prayer requests
[2:56:09] know the praise from sister Lamar I
[2:56:12] wanna thank God for keeping our children
[2:56:13] safe and she's thanking God that Glenda

[2:56:47] year doctors told me that I had a kidney
[2:56:50] stone and was sent for further testing
[2:56:52] at Mount Hope during that time I prayed
[2:56:54] and left it in God's hand my faith never
[2:56:57] wavered that God was with me and was in
[2:57:00] control of the situation in October I
[2:57:03] received the reports and there was no
[2:57:05] kidney stone the doctors is still
