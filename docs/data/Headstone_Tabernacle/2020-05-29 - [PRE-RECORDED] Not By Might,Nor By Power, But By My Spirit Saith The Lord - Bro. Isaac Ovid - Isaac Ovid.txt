these two scriptures this morning Zechariah 4 and reading from verse 6 and Isaiah 59 reading from verse 19 starting in Zechariah 4 and verse 6 then he answered and speak unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel seeing not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who are Thou O great mountain before the Rubel thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it and reading Isaiah 59 and verse 19 source shall be affair the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him me the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word can we give the Lord a hand or praise you may be seated so I have a title this morning and my title is not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord come the church say mend and I have a subject Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and an inspiration the spirit raising a standard to meet the challenge of the hour amen and a message just for a background revelation for Revelation chapter 4 3 where the Branham said all right here was voices oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of live voice 'as the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how much you holla the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God see anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on all my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil now I want to say something this morning Church it's not what the devil does it's a response to what did ever does it's not what takes place in our lives that God is looking at he's looking at our response so that's sanctified holy life say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be done goodness not looking at how much you shout and jumped but if not sanctified holy life and I wanna see this morning the devil has a response to the scriptures that's why when Jesus was in the wilderness the devil was probing and probing the devil has a response to the quotes because the devil he could read but that is not what the issue is the devil has a response to all of that but he has no response to the life because the moment you vibrate that life the devil has to back up to let you call when you present the life of Christ the devil has no answer to the life of Christ you don't have to say a word of but the life speaks something and the fact that you are here this morning is speaking something you are supposed to be backslidden but you are here this morning and that's a problem for the devil the fact that you are in the house of God this morning because come to the house of God opens a road up to the blessings of God it's up to you to walk on that road but when you are in his presence and you are under the canopy of life something could happen to you your word to come to you because we have heard a message before we have heard a word before it's not a new message of but when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit will raise a standard but the Branham said my making the seem were more positive so the reasoning of the standard is not a new inspiration it's not a new dog trainer it's not a new idea it's not a new move but if the seem word more positive you heard it before but all of a sudden this morning it's a reality to you you have heard it before but this morning it's alive to you you've heard it before but this morning you feel a little different about it you have heard it before but this morning you're a little more fed up of what the devil has been doing so the world is more positive to you this morning you just woke up up on the right side of the bed so the word is more positive for you this morning you woke up knowing that no weapon formed against you nothing to devil can see to you nothing your husband your wife your brother your sister your neighbor your friend couldn't move you and the same word up is more positive to you and because the word is more positive to you you are more positive you are positive Christian destroying we have too many negative Christians we have too many sad Christians we have too many depressed Christians up depressed and Christians those words should not come together frustrated Christians those words should never come together higher Christian those words should never come together but now are we the sons of God no are we the sons of God Oh hallelujah oh my I want to encourage your fear this morning encourage your walk this morning it is an effort to get up it takes an effort to fight it takes an effort to make it and brother Branham said in the message the world is falling apart up he said friends of we are not promised a system we are not in church our system if Jesus would have nothing to do with a system we wasn't promised a system we will promise a kingdom and how do you get into it by one spirit we are all baptized into this kingdom it's the kingdom of God eternal life with an eternal king is eternal world with an eternal people retesting eternal life so I'm not speaking to your flashes morning I'm not speaking to your mistakes of it I'm not speaking to your failures I'm not speaking to the sickness in your party I'm speaking to the words see them in your soul because of that seed in your soul your body will have to subject itself to your confession because of the seed in your soul oh can I get a witness in the house is sworn and did we come to have church today are we here headstone Tabernacle are we in the house of God glory my mind let me say that again it's the kingdom of God it's a kingdom of eternal life there's no death in that Kingdom there's no sickness in that kingdom there's no depression in that Kingdom there's no sadness in that Kingdom there's no frustration in that Kingdom yes no mortgage in that Kingdom there are no pills in that Kingdom there's nothing negative in that Kingdom and that Kingdom has an eternal king the pastor is not the king there's no president there's no Prime Minister there's no emperor there's just the king of kings and the Lord of lords of Lewes mighty in battle who is sovereign and if he elected you because of his serenity he needs no permission to bless you and if we elected you because of his serenity he needs no permission to fill you with the Holy Ghost and if he called you because of his election grace up he needs no permission to heal you he doesn't need permission to come into your house he doesn't need permission to clean up your life up he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] hallelujah you maybe see data so get excited about him we are in the spirit this morning church you can never get bless of unless you in the spirit hub I want to be in the spirit hop on a Sunday I want to be in the spirit up on a Monday I want to be in the spirit in the morning I want to be a spirit in the night time I want to be in the spirit all the time because one of these days there's not trouble no longer exist this physical will no longer exist I want to be magnetized to the headstone because the hester will come as we read in the scripture with shoutings of grace grace grace grace it's the grace of God you are here this morning it's the grace of God you woke up this morning you may be seated oh my oh my you may be seated I've said it before it's not your alarm clock that woke you up this morning I've said it before it's not your alarm clock that woke you up this morning if you take an alarm clock and put it in the morgue nobody's gonna get up but it's the grace of God that woke you up this morning I don't care how much bills you have I don't care how much pain you're in I don't care how much trouble you're facing the God we serve all he wants is your worship this morning he wants your obedience he wants your praise he wants your adoration he wants your love this morning can we do that for him can we give Him worship can we give Him praise can we give Him glory God is the giver some real Christians not some Christians of convenience of only when things go bad only when things go wrong only when things didn't work out but you are Christian 24/7 it's the hunger that shakes the devil the devil cannot move you that ever can upset you give God a shout out praise [Applause] my you may be seated this is just the background I'm trying to take my time this morning I just want to take my time and bask in the presence we came to the house of God to spend time in the world to spend time in the past so put your seatbelts on we're going on a journey this morning hallelujah you could might as well get comfortable we have all day today it's a Lord's day I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord we have come into his house gathered in his name to worship Him the builds will take care of itself all that you worrying about hallelujah when the disciples had no money he said goldfish they got food and when they talked of food there was money in there he took out their physical he took care of their financial what are you worried about he is till jehovah jireh up he has children who were shallow that has not changed he said I am God and I changed not he is still the same yesterday he is telling God of War he is telling God of judgment he is still a good a blessing he is still a God of mercy to those that repent and come back to him let us return unto the Lord this morning not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord [Applause] oh my you may be seated from the same message the world is falling apart we are dead our lives I hit him God through Christ so through Christ our lives I hit him God so there's certain aspects of our life that are secret but I hit record that's why you are a mystery to the devil that's why when he encountered Jesus he had to act the question if thou be because his life was hidden there's a covering over you there's a mask over you there's a covenant over you and when the devil looks he's not too sure he's probing he's probing he's probing hallelujah and it seems he scepter to him because you fall and you feel and you make mistakes and for the devil the mathematics and not adding up how Almighty God will pick you you know you better than I know you the fact that Almighty God would protect you and put you under under the blood the devil cannot figure it out because the devil has a fire he has everything that you did but when God sees the file and look sure the blood he says there's nothing on the first page there's nothing on the second page what are you talking about the devil is the accuser of the Brethren he has a file on your wife a file on your children but when car pulls a file and he looks to the blood he said there's nothing against my pride what what are you talking about that's my lady I chose that lady I've engaged that lady I'm gonna be married to that lady don't you talk about my lady you are predestinated for the marriage supper of the lamb put a wedding supper [Applause] hallelujah somebody give God a shout of praise you may be seated my you are going to the wedding supper not as I guessed in the wedding supper but there are two seats and the wedding supper for the king and for the lady for the groom and for the bride you have reserved seating don't worry about your seat because you are the bride of Jesus Christ of angels I have to step aside prophet shall have to step aside apostles up after step aside behold the bride of Jesus Christ that's who we are Abraham wish he could have been a part of this up but this is bride time this is she time [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] we are dead our lives are hidden God through Christ and not only that but we are raised with him raised up what in a system a denomination organization as the Prophet we are resurrected in the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God is within you that's a prophet why all these man-made systems must fall not once more I'll shake the world but I'll shake heavens and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shut or moved that's the kingdom of God not a system not a political wheel not a denomination but a kingdom and it's subjects are dead to the systems of this world to the system on your job dead to the systems of the culture dead to the systems of the fashion dead to the systems of what the other young people are doing dead to the systems of what other men do and it's normal and everybody else is doing it you're dead to all of that I don't care what the other wives do dead to that I don't care what your cousins and your sisters I don't care what it you can't do it because your life is hidden Christ everything you do is measured by Christ not measured by the church but measured by Christ and the church team and that's not everybody can the church see man oh my we're gonna have a clean Church we're gonna have a pure Church we're gonna have a holy church um we're gonna have a church where Jesus feels welcome to walk in through the aisles and sit next to you and say God bless you the cyma he sat in the temple before they call him jesus was just the air he was in the church it was his custom to be in the church but he didn't even realize who he was up and there's some sons and daughters here that we don't even realize who you are but you are attribute sons of God I don't care how your living doesn't change the fact that you call you for such a time as this [Applause] with the brand I'm sending a message perfect strength by perfect weakness you have your seat belts on right we're going for a ride God strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them that's what God wants to do take empty human vessels and shake the world with them like a Pentecost at Pentecost what did he do it taking them 10 days to get all emptied up but it was all standing there where their vessels turned up and God took himself and fill them up that's all that's the need of today that's what we need today is empty vessels so God can fill them up listen carefully friends God cannot use them as long as they already filled up so it is in Lord fill me if you're not empty there's nothing he can do because the poor in they has to be room for him to pull is anybody willing this morning to mg empty themselves to empty your thoughts to empty your qualifications to empty the chip you have on your shoulder - empty who your family is to empty this is what makes me what I am to empty this is how I feel about this brother this is how I feel about this services this is the problem that I have many people are filled up with their problems fill up with their issues fill up with their situations can we empty yourselves this morning so God can fill the vessels because if he fills the vessels everything will begin to change because when he steps into the picture nothing could stay the same way one time Aaron left his rod by mistake into the Holy of Holies and overnight it started to grow because it was in the presence imagine if that presence gets placed inside of you what will it do to cancer what will it do to diabetes what will it do [Applause] light and darkness cannot stay in the same house if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you the Bible says it will quicken your mortal body it will quicken your mortal body you may be seated it doesn't mean if you die it just raised you up again but it means you could be walking and feel quickened because that life has an effect that spirit has an effector there's a result of whenever that spirit comes into contact with something there has got to be a result can the church demon Oh for the challenge today is that people don't want to give up people don't want to empty up people don't want to let go because people have their own biases their own feelings and because God is so good he gives you free will he's not forcing himself in anybody he's a gentleman he says behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice I'm not coming and breaking down your door I'm not doing that but I'm gonna knock and I'm gonna know I don't know gonna knock until like a tired of knocking because the Bible says seeking a lot while he might be found call upon him while he is near so there's a time limit when God is no longer knock what would you excuse me for not opening the door it was my mother it was my father it was the pastor it was the church it was my job I had no money I wasn't feeling well I was vexed I had a body had about week I had a bad month I had a body err idle about a kid I had about my whole life what will you excuse me some months ago I preached a message no more excuses because when Moses stood in from the burning bush and he said I can't talk I can't walk I don't know tears I don't attack after he was finished God say you're still going you have any more excuses because after all of your excuses it's still up to the individual you cannot blame anybody and if God says you are going you have got to go you may be seated [Music] Jonah thought he was okay when God told him good this way he said you know what let me slip out let me slip on the other way and while Jordan is slipping out the other way thinking he's flying under the radar he takes a ship he said there's no way God will get me over this ship on this ship and while the port is heading in the wrong direction the Bible said a storm came and as he poured she can chew on is that they'll feel convicted that's when you know you're calling on when there's a few convicted when you know don't even soul this in right this road are going on here right everybody else on this boat but I am Oh - please this Plataea minute here right what I'm wearing - did alright how I left home this morning in here right this music are listening to it all right this conversation I mean it all right this job a minute here right Jonah silly son is not all is your problem I am the problem Lord give us some Christians who can say I am the problem you may be seen it listen you see whenever you hear from God your vocabulary changes from you them to I when Isaiah metal or this annoys me I am a man of unclean lips whenever you meet God is never about anybody else you look at your own life and say Lord I'm a sinner I'm a sinful man I need help a little touch so Jonah confronted the reality of his existence and say I am the problem is it threw me overboard he had to have hit sinner is it throw me overboard I didn't wanna catch him but he just said get me off of this boat yet enough confidence that if he get off here behind and when Jonah caught off of the boat there was a prepared fish for Jonah Jonah didn't even know this fish had GPS because fish was programmed to take Jonah direct his destiny I want to see Church you will get to your destiny the easy way or the hard way Jonah had the option to go straight to Nineveh he took the hard way but he end up right at Nineveh and you young people in the church you can take the easy way or you can take the hard way but you are gonna get to Holy Ghost you are gonna dress right you are gonna live right you are gonna act right you will respect your parents you will honor God the easy way or the hard way but it's gonna happen [Applause] can the church say Amen not by power not by might but by the spirits here the law can the church say man everybody feeling fine everybody feeling good everybody feeling in the spirit why you may be seated [Applause] so God's God got to have empty vessels so he can fill them up and that's what all the situations in your life that you cannot explain it's all about it's God's desire for you to empty out because when you are fill you depend on what you are filled with so when you have too much money your money is what you depend on when you fill with wealth you go by the doctor no one that a woman with the issue of blood it was when her money ran out and she was empty that she's had to look for an alternative solution to the problem she had had she had money she would have found every single doctor but the Bible said she exhausted her resources she was empty and her emptiness brought a desperation to look for alternative medication there's anybody in the house looking for alternative medication this morning you tried money you tried fornication you try drinking your try false doctrine your try being a good judge member but that's not the same thing as the medication of the baptism of the Holy Ghost when the Spirit comes upon you it's a whole different walk it's a different talk it's as if my life can the church say man my from the message speak to this mountain I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's gonna shake the whole world [Applause] the shaking of this world is not because of natural powers right on this political shaking is there's this government shaking hands wars and rumors of wars there's oil and every session and all of this this is this is scripture being fulfilled we shouldn't be surprised in fact me happy heads up we know what's gonna happen before what happens people are told of school and study kind of mix and thing I say well it's boom and bust cycle we know that's already I don't need a degree to tell you this whole world going on in the financial ruin the Bible says so people can study for seven years kind of doctrine in in economics already currency this and that and the Bible already tells you that already war than rumors of wars you already already have your script but the end is not yet but this gospel will be preached and then the end will come that's our gospel that's our message that's our word so nothing Russia could do could affect the planet garage has to wait on us president Trump after wait on us after we force a sign of an ziyan floor we ready we are preach the gospel in Poland demonstration we are ready for the rapture dan the end will come that's the gospel when Jesus stood in front of Pilate in these guys you see power power means my father give a little mission to you have a little piece a garden and is my father give any garden you have what you talking about if I want back up I call him back up didn't realize who he was but Jesus knew who he was and his knowledge of who he was and the position of who he was gave him a certain authority of faith and confidence to live a certain way and that's what we ought to be he was not in the best position when he was in prison but he didn't change the fact of who he was Joseph imprisoned in the fact of who he was Jesus sleeping on the poor didn't change the fact of who he was so whether you are tired weary sick of ashrita doesn't change the fact of who you are and the power locked up inside of you somebody say man who but Abraham said I believe that the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's gonna happen pretty soon I'm looking for to happen in this meeting but the Browns face was so much is 1959 huh I'm waiting I'm wanting it to happen now that the anointing will strike the whole Church of the Living God and you rise to her feet like my team marching army the sick will be healed by a wood the blind will see the Deaf will hear the Dead will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we are in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's gonna strike the Church of God soon and listen listen to the promise and it's going to suck a revival that will shake the world I believe it so in every age we know there was a thunder and this age and this time all the thunders from every age come together because the last age and in a message expectation but the banham said now if God has promised a revival we're going to have it so let's make ready for it if God promised to heal now listen this is so powerful because but the Branham is just bringing the promises to the people he's not speaking to their situation he is speaking about the promise she said if God promised to heal let's make ready for it so he is speaking to people looking for healing and he said well if you are about to be healed get ready for it I wanted to sink a little bit if you if you're on a destination for the Holy Ghost then get ready for it because it's coming if your children are gonna be restored get ready for it if your daughter is coming back to the house of God get ready that make preparation sweet begin to buy some extra food but when it comes to you can happy food ready to cook for them because they're coming make ready for it where the parent said move out everything gets ready we're right in time he says no it'll seem foolish no you see well how it's gonna happen in a deal like this and I don't care what anything contrary is - that is wrong we can see it I see know what we look like but if God said so let's do it anyhow because God said so I'm expecting it somebody say man my so anybody expecting a revival [Applause] I'm under great expectation for real revival in about 40 days we'd have our convention here the tabernacle and I'm a great expectation if you are not explicitly for your own life and your old walk that's you but I'm my next petition but the Branham said and I want to bring it back to the church so we know what we are expecting but the Browns another revival causes five things he said a revival bring souls to Christ well Brown said it will bring the church back to the spiritual condition it should be in the revival brings close communion with God a revival brings fellowship among the churches and in the revival you pray for the sick I'm gonna Brown them in a message making the valley full of ditches if that's what we need tonight is a good old-fashioned backwards sing killin sky-blue religion bleach under the power of the Holy Ghost that's what we need and in the third series a familiar code that's a reason that the Reve hours that we're supposed to have we have the nomination revivals we havin a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we have got revivals we haven't oracle millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere but the pastor the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of quarter stood a bride yet we are looking for it it'll take those seven unknowns another back there to wake her up again he was senator he promised it so what are you looking for preacher I'm looking for a manifestation of God the stood the bride for a reality that'll make you walk different talked different live like a Christian can't you see me oh my vii under revival is the pride revival if there's no seventh in the revival there will be no rapture if there's no seventh in revival there'll be no resurrection the seventh ton this is what gathers the pride is seven thunders will give the pride see the seven thunders what sort of bride how to code but I'm said this is still my background I'm getting to my text shortly and the only way you're ever gonna see your way out of whatever you're going through is an old fashioned spiritual revival when the hallelujahs of court is ringing from the bottom of your heart and an old-fashioned Holy Ghost and really hits the place then you begin to see things then core will begin to reveal things then you'll wonder why these real questions are hanging on why they are praying for you can the church say men Oh hallelujah let me wrap up my initial thoughts here but the Branham said the church is a pond again bunch of believers that's in Christ by the Holy Ghost led by the Spirit of God that's what he describes the church as we're not of the world they are out of the world they are different from the world that's what makes them what they are so what makes them what they are is their difference from the world that's what's made out their life is dead and they're hidden Christ dead in Christ on the head and sealed by the Holy Ghost they are away from the things of the world sons of God are led by the Spirit of God that led by some other fanatics or some organization or somebody one another they are led by the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit listen was given to the church to be the overseer the tutor that was to raise that sharing of God not our bishops and Cardinals and so forth but the Holy Ghost and listen to what Mary Ellen said I'm expecting this is my expectation also I'm expecting the Holy Ghost not denomination not a not a Catholic priest not a Baptist preacher or a pen I'm expecting the Holy Ghost to come down and set in order a church that will go to meet him fill with the power and a resurrection of Christ I'm expecting that I believe that God promised it that'd be a church without spot or wrinkle on it I'm expecting it because God said so can the church say man so let me strike my text a little bit the spirit raising a standard to meet the challenge of the hour now every hour has its challenges in the days of Noah they had their challenges and the day of Moses they had their challenges in the day of Moses they were in slavery they were working for the Egyptians they were under the oppression of hero that was the challenge that they were facing and they had to have something to meet the challenge of that hour so when God sent Moses down to Egypt they finally got a hope to meet the challenge of the hour in every age in the Dark Ages the Christians were being killed in Lions Den and this that was the challenge of the hour and they had to have a great fit to live in that hour how many people wish they could be in a rage where in that AG was easy enough who is just one question are you a Christian and there were only two possible answers good there was no maybe is he that yes or no it was yes was Lyons then it was yes it was hanging across every was no you go and he live your life and I'm not with those people that it was easy this day is harder the Baxter there'll be a day where it's neither day or night is in the middle everything is great you're not too sure you have a lot of maybes now there's no yes and there's no days are you a Christian kinda I'm in the message gray area in the message but the master had enough walking in the middle but it's a challenge in every age and there's a challenge of this hour and something has to come for us to meet and match the challenge of the hour now I share this with a change before but everybody was down here it was a communion service a long time ago thing about a year or two ago and I was speaking about when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit will raise our standard against it we all familiar with the scripture right so I was many tasted on this scripture when the enemy comes in like a flood that I always wondered why did the Bible use the word flood to describe it when the 20 enemy comes in like an earthquake or the enemy comes in like a tornado or the enemy coming like a hurricane but if somebody enemy comes in like a flood and a flood is defined as an overflow of water that submerges land which is usually too dry a flood is where water ends up where it's not supposed to be it usually takes time for a flood to develop rain must fall for a prolonged period of time for a flood to develop a quick lasts a few seconds but a flood is different destroys lives property change the landscape and it can last for a long time in nature you can't fight a flood if there's a fire you could pull a fire extinguisher but what do you do when there's a flood a flood is coming it takes time and if it happens in it and you just have to deal with it you could build a house to handle earthquakes tornadoes fire but a flood is different the average tornado can last 10 minutes maybe an hour but a flood can last for months in Noah's day the flood lasted 40 days and 40 nights the three worst disasters in the last thousand years have all been floods in 1931 it was estimated that up to 4 million people were killed in the hankie River flood you could try to prevent it but you couldn't stop it comes to destroy it comes to break down and it comes to break up but the Bible says when the enemy comes like a flood the Spirit would raise us [Applause] and many of us in our lives you know war it has been like rain upon rain upon rain when you thought something else couldn't more wrong it was running and no you look around your life and it seems as you're standing in this flood but when the enemy comes like a flood that's when the spirit put raised a standard and in the spiritual the enemy has attacked there's been flood after flood flood of evil throne of sickness through lot of interpretation but every time there's a flood the Spirit will always come and raise the standard come the church say man the three Hebrew boys they were here and they had their testimony and they told him listen you can't breathe you can't worship you have to pony and they said we will not bow down and they had to deal with their own flood they have to deal with their own challenge and they say we will not bow down but when they enter the fiery furnace of the spirit raised a standard to defend them and they overcame the flood the situation that they have to deal with there's no flood there's no situation there's no temptation there's no trial that the spirit kind of raised the standard against it can the church a man not by might nor by power but by my spirit share the Lord so maybe you're dealing with the flood of high blood pressure when the enemy comes in like a Florida the Spirit will raise the standard [Applause] in every age they had their flood we have all floods also God doesn't have shortcuts and the God is nothing the business of making it easy for some people all that come to God have to be tried have to be tested and you have your personal flood that you have to deal with in your life you will have the hard keys and you have your storms too but the flood is serious but we all know floods but when the enemy comes in like a flood the Bible says the Spirit will raise a standard and I shared before because I know many people don't know what a standard is and in ancient times a standard identified who you were so the tribe of Judah would have it standard it would have been a stick with a symbol or something on it I would represent the tribe so when the Philistines and the Jebusites and Hittites come they will all have their standards their banner that represented who they are the standard would see whose side you're on the standard would represent your history because you would take time to have a standard so Judah might have been a lion and whatever it was was a standard of the child the tribe repeated the style represents what you believe this time when you see the standard it's a reminder of what you're fighting for the standard supposed to keep you together because we're the standard is that's where you're the rest of your people because the army moves with the standard so in the child and Israel come together for war you would see the standard for Judah the standard for God the standard even Italian all the men of war would stand with your standard I mean the standard Paris had charge you would move with the standard in the heat of the battle the standard would mean hope because you can be under pressure but once a standard is being lifted you know there's somebody else on your side who is holding the standard up [Music] if the enemy has you under option you gotta look for winners Tannen is because a standard mean they're more men around the standard well you don't hear me this morning [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I'm normally this cannot but be wherever the king or the general is the general was stand here because you represent the last bastion so even when men are caught to fight the general will be here with the standard to let you know we are here and if I need us any more reinforcements the real world will come from the standard okay men over there over there over to that side when the standard Falls it means you're finished if the standard Falls it means the army is finished because whatever happens the men will fight the defender standard even if there's one man left with the standard they will take a standard back to whoever's remaining I'm from another army wrong the standard that's how powerful a standard world when you see the stander it means rally when you see the standard it means this is where we make our stand if we must die here we will die here but we were standing with the standard you may be seated depending on how you use it the standard can mean charge this Tanika mean go to the left this time if amigos at all right this time I can meet up all black you may be seated in those days they have no walkie-talkies they had no radios they have nobody seen I'm on channel 2 move to the left movie now no the standard is where the instructions came from chewiness standard circle him it meant something it means everybody gets into war when the standard go up and down it means something that's an important standard was the standard para had to know when was the right time to move the standard the right time to raise the standard because you know what to give away the move before it's time the standard era was one of the most important rules outside of the general but the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit would raise the standard it wouldn't be man raising the stand up it wouldn't mean oh you know you hear me it'll be the spirit itself given the cry to charge when it's time for your children to come back the spirit what she time is up bring them in raise the standard prepare for war [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] so I want you to understand what the scripture means and in context God is not just in this time' to anybody else he said for this flood I'll raise our standard myself I will give the orders myself I will give the instructions myself now in modern times we don't have standards like those anymore in modern times we call it a flag that's the modern version of what they had a standard years ago so when so let's go to war I know there's some brothers here who would smile when they say when man went to the moon they put the flag on the moon there's somebody who say well man didn't go to the moon as a different message but wherever you go and you claim the territory your standard marks possession so when she would have entered into the promised land every place you put your foot is yours they will make sure when they took an area they put the standard up this is ours Trudeau dad whatever it is the standard represented ownership can the Jets eman the standard the part of the flag means is our territory this is my family this is my house as for me and my house we will serve the Lord there's a standard in my house he's a standard in my life can the church see me oh and I shared this i shared his story back then and when I preached on this there's a story of a war that was going on and by the nights he was losing the war understand that be era he was running ahead of the other men and as he's running the men around him are being killed left and right but he knows that they have to get to the other side and the general of the army screamed out to the flagbearer he said bring back the flag we got a retreat and that flag bearer scream back I'm not bringing it back bring up the men bring up the blacker I've got to keep going I've come too far to turn back now bring up the men I've already reach this far I'm not gonna retreat now I've been a Christian for this long I might have lost brothers I might have lost sisters but I'm heading to the promised land bring up the men bring up the soldiers nor retreat no given up I'm gonna be tired but I'm not giving up I might be wearing but I'm not giving up I might be standing alone but I'm not giving up bring up two men and this morning I say bring up the men the land is a good land it's a fluent ladder show a milk and honey [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah so any enemy comes in like a flood the spirit would give the final judge and all through history we have had standard bearers Gideon was a standard bearer he said the sword of the Lord and of Gideon what a declaration what a feat the sword of the Lord and of Gideon Joshua was a standard bearer the enemy had come like a flood and he needed more light he couldn't do it himself and he spoke and said son stand still and the spirit raised the standard and the church came and oh my and I said it before you may be seated Joshua was just so focused on winning the war Joshua was estelle about physics or geometry or geology because as anybody knows the Sun doesn't move around here it is the earth moves around the Sun so when Josh was his son stand still he actually activate some mathematical equations for the earth to stop moving Josh I wasn't bright enough to know it was the earth had to stop moving this is Suns standstill and God said you know what to do stop it because a son need some backup so you might even see the right way but when he said lord help me god knows what to t it's his son Antigua oh you don't hear me this morning [Applause] mine that's why some time when you pray the words might even come out I might be outgrown I get a cry my people you might be able to see the words what the situation is but you're you're deep down in the holes here Lord you know I need you know I need you know I need a quarter fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it the cries of my people and I've come down to deliver sometimes the words can even come on it it's too painful but he hears every cry he hears every scream he hears every morning he knows every situation Oh help us Jesus help us Jesus the things that you can't even see he knows what's coming down in your soul but if there's a cry in there he knows what it means you may be seated for church give God right now put the come to answer to desire of your heart what would that desire be what would that desire be this morning because he is here this morning he's here to heal the brokenhearted that's that's what he does that's his that's what he does he's here to heal the sick he's here to comfort them that mourn he's here to to touch you he's here that's what he does that he can't help himself that that's his nature that his being as his attributes to call himself Oh backslider come back home this morning sinner come to God this morning father mother young brother young sister come back to court this morning not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord friends we are not creating a standard we are lifting a standard the standard already exists it's not a new standard it's a standard of holiness it's a standard of purity it's a standard of righteousness it's a standard of humility it's a standard of holy decency it's a standard of Rutley lava it's a standard of forgiveness it's a standard of charity it's a standard of perfect love it's a standard of seven living voices it's a standard of adoption it's a standard of perfection it's not a new standard this trend that always was always is and always will be the standard is Jesus Christ the same yes to tell forever is there anybody in the house who will help me lift that standard up [Applause] Oh hallelujah this talent is the king of kings this time it is the Lord of lords this time that is LSAT higher this standard is arrested one of the standard is healing I love him this term that is a Rose of Sharon this time that is a lily of the valley this time that is my Sheila this time it is my buckler this time that is my sword Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah he may be seated this tender is one Lord is one feet it's one baptism they are not two standards there's just one standard but the Branham came to point us to the standard he came to 4-under standard because the standard is a greatest weapon that the world has ever seen this standard is a word the standard is spirit and when the word and spirit comes together the standard is called dynamic Sun this planet is called mechanics and enemies together for my lap arena that's the standard the standard was laid out on the day of Pentecost when the panel's header before the doctors hands touches my wife this channel was being lifted the show that the standard is still here oh you don't hear me this morning this has never left can the church say ma'am and when the enemy comes like a flood the Spirit will raise the standard to give you hope to keep on fighting tick if you hope to keep on pressing to give you hope that your son is coming to give you a hope you and I get the holy OSA he is that a whole pot that's under this Christ in you the hope of glory [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated and I love it I wanted to really sing down because people want to claim that they are holding the standard that the standard is in this church and the angel is in a church and the organizing is in this church and the Bible says when the enemy comes in because the enemy came in and that church that was established earlier Pentecost fell into the ground and that flood took the church out and in every age a flood came but the Branham said the floods camera but luta that's Tanner was raising his name it was a looter raised in a standard it was a spirit raising the standard of I remember the Branham left the standard did not leave the standard in hand to any man the Tanner was always in the hands of the spirit this fella has never left the hands of the Spirit but the Holy Ghost as a standard bearer would stand with any man who stays with the word you don't hear me this morning the standard era who is the holding us up will identify himself up with any son who stays with the word would any top ha who sees with the word with any group who stays it [Applause] oh my you may be seated the standard-bearer the spirit is a standard para you may be seated the spirit has no loyalty to manner the standard bearer only has a loyalty to his word oh my and once you see the world that's why the Prophet said obedience the entire world entitles you to being accompanied by the standard error because it's a spirit that follows the world it's a spirit that brings life to the world it's just spirit the word you may be seated hallelujah so the flood in your marriage you know Nina marriage comes love the flood in your marriage you get the word and watch the Spirit come and with the word because when you apply the word to your marriage husband love your eyes wide reference your husband once the word is present the spirit the standard pair up is obligated to raise the standard and dispel all enemies this fellow eyes somebody help me this morning on your job to take the word to your life and be sweet up be humble be a Christian and what's the standard error make himself known Nick himself present raise the standard whatever the flower is [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] you may be seated with the Brandon he prayed for that man who was mind and that man went away and he came back he said I'm still blind and put the brown said he's because he didn't our feet and feet come by here in the wood so he hadn't had enough wood that was mixed with the feet activate the bread I was already spoken so but I said I can pray for you again you already prayed for you once I pray I already actively to resource from heaven no it's on you to have enough feet to receive it so we told the man go around seen by stripes I'm healed because that's also the word so when that man suddenly see my stripes I'm healed my stripes I'm healed what he didn't realize is every time he said it it became more read to him the standard-bearer was walking closer walking closer walking closer walking closer because a standard-bearer always follows the world the standard-bearer wants his feet mixed with the world the standard era he's attracted to it [Applause] somebody say man oh my what flood is bugging you down this morning what situation has you overwhelmed this morning I don't care what it is there's no flood that this sand appear can't deal with you may be seated hallelujah somebody give God which somebody give God praise somebody enter in this morning oh my but then I think you you haven't touched my flood you don't know my flood what I'm going through you don't have to my flood is different this one it's not like anybody else's flood that's how many of us feel sometimes come to church and you do your best to put on the best message Christian face you could put on but you're in a flood you have on rubber boots lifejacket because you don't know if you're gonna fall down and fruit in this flood I want to challenge you this morning I don't care what the flood is there's a word for every flood there's a word for every situation but you have to find the word for your situation you have to find a word as David did to encourage himself the word that encourages you will be different on the word and encourages somebody else because we all have our different floods we all have our different challenges we all have our different struggles that comes with this Christian walk and this Christian journey I challenge you to at the living quarters stop looking at other people's floods and trust God to bring healing in your soul and healing in your life that you could live the kind of testimony that Gorka see there's my son dears my daughter you imagine a flood that Joel was in he lost his property he lost his children he lost his money and his wife is the end with him in the flood and you say why don't you Chris board and die but job kept standing because there was something in him to stand friends backsliding is not an option giving up is not an option even though sometimes you feel like giving up some egg or cats you giving up you know what the Bible says I believe in Luke chapter 5 Jesus comes and he sees some brothers Simon and different ones I believe it was the Bible said they were washing their nets anybody familiar with it I heard let me read it in Luke 5 verse 1 and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God Sugiyama Jesus he stood by the leak of knesset and saw two ships standing by the leak but the fishermen were gone out of them and we're washing their nets and normally when you have to access a person if your net was in the water why I need to wash it but his men were washing their nets because they were done they were finished they are caught nothing we see literally they are caught nothing but they will finish they are given up they had resigned themselves saying we are going home without food but this day was different because Jesus comes by them and the Bible says he entered into one of the ships which was Simons and prayed him or asked him and he would trust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship and when he left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught and Simon answering him said master we have 12 all night long that's why I was washing my head it's not that I didn't try to be a fisherman I didn't try to catch you so didn't try to come to church I tried but I didn't catch anything so I found myself washing - I have taken nothing nevertheless and I would I will let down the net and the Bible says and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckoned under their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink and when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man Oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drop of the fishes which he had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said understand fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men fishers of men but I want to touch on something here friends you know many times as Christians people have this bravado they will do glory hallelujah and the stuff going on it's okay for stuff to be going on in your life it's okay to be tired Jesus himself was not that's why he was sleeping on the boat when the storm came Christians get tired Christians feel weary sometimes and these men as I heard somebody say one time he said as a businessman you would never employ people who want to give up but Jesus came to these men who were quitting the job with old results and he was still willing to work with these men friends many times in our Christian journey we found ourselves washing on it we are willing to give up because things didn't work out for us do we weep and it's not easy to toilet all night and catch nothing it's not easy to work hard and see no fruit of your labor but Peter said something powerful is he act I would I'm willing to try one more time and if it's anything that church gets this morning is to be willing to try one more time willing to give God y'all one more time willing to live the right way one more time willing to forget the toil of the night the toil of the last year the toilet the last ten years willing to forget the pain and of not catching anything you sit in church you see other people get blessed and you wonder Lord where's my blessing I want that kind of blessing I feel I'm gonna wash my nads I see people in church and they are happy and they're rejoicing but I don't know what they're having but my walk is different and I'm washing my nets I'm ready to just give up friends there's a word this morning cast your net one more time give quality all one more time I said the beginning of this service I want to encourage your feet this morning to not give up the don't give up the don't quit I don't care what the challenges do not quit do not give up keep on fight it it'll be all what the Bible says that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in this friends the standard is still there the standard is still standing the standard is not moving the standard is not coming down all these years God have been waiting for the right people to rally around a standard for the last grid kill for the last showdown for the last outpouring of the holy ghost pepper the brands that would be so powerful this will will not be able to contain it so powerful it'll be a short quick message it'll shake the whole nation so powerful that your family will have no choice but to come back and if you have doubts about it if God could take a Lazarus from being dead and Lazarus had no choice to come back what about your son or daughter who is living wherever they are doing whatever they are doing God is able to bring somebody who's alive if you can bring somebody was get back up don't you worry about the standard is still standing high not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord when will the Branham left the standard did not leave this standard has been here all the time and the Spirit is holding the standard and every flood that comes he lives to stand up the say keep your head up up Square your shoulders back lift your head up and keep moving forward the promised land is just ahead of the holy ghost is just ahead your promise is just ahead your revival is just ahead Kanda Chertsey man oh my you know what the man said Satan will be powerless before this bride no power before this bride sickness will not stop this bride was anointed will not stop this Prime Oh could you imagine your people oh my oh hey Loreena god the missus things get ready I'm getting ready to finish out Oh hallelujah the angel of the Lord is only good now Messiah is here he was here with the Prophet and when the Prophet left he stayed here and the Holy Spirit came upon you to reproduce the green the word seed in your soul and he has never left you he will never forsake you he will be with you in your child he will take you through every one of your trial there's no trial that is too great no trial that could overcome you is impossible there is a way of escape this morning and if you have a lot of trials this morning count yourself blessed because the more trials you have it's just the enemy tried to stop the seed in your soul it's a sign from God that you are elected of God because the devil will not try to stop his owner he will only stop those that are going against the greener and you are an art wall this morning you are going against the green every time you lift your hands with a venom self you are defying the law of gravity you are defying the law of nature every time you come to the house of God you are making your identification with the banner with the standard you see Lord I'm on your side who is on the Lord's side this morning oh my Oh hallelujah oh I'm trying to find a place to close out your preach me out already my my my glory glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah so the spirit friends is here to take us all the way to the rapture don't lose sight that we are heading to a rapture don't lose sight of the fact that we are heading to the end of all things don't lose sight of the fact that there'll be two in a bed and one will be taken and one will be left it's so easy to get caught up with this and pattern I would realize that no matter what goes on you have to display the token because only the token will be accepted only the token is what guardo recognized and when abraham said in the talk and apply a church now don't feel and what the banham says it over and over don't don't don't let the sunset don't don't don't don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token all that God has done to his world over all these years were to bring it to a spot that token could be in your heart could be identify that you could be identified with a token and more than that the truth can be egg that I'd be identified with you but the Branham said you say I believe I believe the message you say that's all right that's good but you must have to took him do you hear Branham Tabernacle and I see this morning do you hear his tone Tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all you're believing is in vain see you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ you say well I believe every word said brother branham that's good but that's just being able to read to eat the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ being you when I see that I'll pass over you but they ran I said now look at yourself we're coming to your house now we come into your life now look at yourself don't look at anybody look at the really are you a genuine Bible Christian full of the love of God remember the Bible said in the last days when this time takes place he said a mocking angel went through the churches went through the cities and sealed only those who cried inside for the abominations was done in the city is that right Ezekiel 9 we know that's a truth that Mark in angel went forth and put a mark on their head forehead seal them then that side and cried after that come the slaughtering angels from the four corners of the earth which is coming right away we see her coming Wars moving right another kill the whole hood off there was nothing that couldn't touch but damn that have that mark I wonder this morning church if the marketing's or the sealing angel moves through this church this morning I wonder how many people would be marked how many people are saying and crying for the abomination in the city God does not recognize your attendance in church because that's not what he's looking for whether you come or don't come he's he already gave his word he said forsake not the assembling I've said that's already spoken but this is going beyond you coming to church this is going beyond you being in the message this is boils down to what's in your heart that nobody else could see because coming to church for some is just a formality being in a message for some is just a formality but it's going deeper to those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city those that recognize that judgment is hanging over not just the world but over the church because the Bible says begin in my sanctuary begin in the house of God judgment begins in the house of God because we ought to know better we have to learn but what are we doing with the word church we have the encouragement every week but always sighing and crying are we praying always seeking are we opening our hearts to God and say Lord I am willing like Samson to die with the Philistines I am willing to give up everything in the world I'm willing to give up the worldly life I'm willing to give up my worldly commitments I'm willing to give it all up for the sake of this token oh my god friends we have to be in rapture in condition that's what the Spirit is here for not to make us jump and shout and just be in the spirit but it's a get us into a condition a condition to go into the rapture a condition like Peter when Peter walk people can be healed in a shadow he was in a condition what's your condition this morning this rapture is not for a group is not for the church it's not for the past it's it's for the individual they are pastors who will miss the rapture they are preachers who will miss their elders deacons so leaders are musicians in the message that will miss the rapture because I wrapped in has respect your position it respects the token friends one taken one left you can have knowledge and mr. rapture you can speak in tongues and mr. rapture you can see the poor and mr. rapture you can get the body to be burned and mr. rapture but you must have charity dynamics to token the life vii under invoices Christ in you the hope of glory to make it to the rapture conventions will not place you in the rapture believe in the right doctrine will not bring you to the rapture it's that life its humility it's that Tunde that sheiks the devil friends don't let us lose the focus of why we are in the house of God this morning we in the pull the purpose of why we are here to get our lives right but god it's no good to just come to church and and feel good and be encouraged and we did the encouraging part you couldn't make it you know that but it's something you must do you must live a certain way we have become too relaxed will become too complacent we have taken things lightly we have lost our sincerity we have lost the plannin to be holy the standard has never been dropped it still the same standard be holy because I am holy it still the standard [Applause] the standard is still thou shall have no other gods before me that still the standard the standard does not change I'm good when the Lord is tended we have to come up to his standard I don't care how bad they look I don't care what your boss says or what everybody is doing in university does not matter the standard is still the standard because everything that can be shaken will be shaken and all in a standard will remain I know this is a positive message everybody loves the Scholten part everybody loves to see this time to take you all to the flood now I'm going beyond the flood you all to the flood now but you have a destination and for that destination is a requirement and quarter not change the requirement if you have to travel you need a passport if you need to go to the US you need a visa go to the world changer requirement because you are who you say you are you have to have your passport you have to have your visa stamp it I am in the bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible says by one spirit you are baptized into the party has nothing to do it who your pastor is what church you go to that's foolishness have you received the Holy Ghost since Yubel era it's been the theme of every apostle since the day of Pentecost and it's still the message today we need a spirit we need a Holy Ghost we need the practice of a fire to tater evil out [Applause] you may be seated that's the only way your money will feel you your body will feel you your mind will feel you but this Holy Ghost will never fail will never fail Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh I don't know why I'm here this morning but we are here this morning we are in the world this morning we are in somewhere this morning I know young people it pains me it pains me with how much we have now that those who went before us didn't have there was a time when the spook with books would come and it would be a rush to not only get it but a waiting list to read it because it was food for the Soul that was before technology now the message is on the Internet the messages on apps on your phone and people don't even want to read it there was the time Bibles weren't allowed to be in your houses that's why Martin Luther found the Bible chained up in the Catholic Church and he found a scripted adjuster let my feet he didn't find it in his house because I had taken the Bible's off the street no your Bibles and all's we have babbling are phones we are barreling our iPads and people don't want to read it I'm caught or just four marriages in the world day and night so you have good success what's wrong with us water rapture are you going to if you don't read your Bible what kind of Christian are you if you are not even serious about making your calling and election sure god help us when the enemy comes in like a flood this morning I'm dealing with the flood of formality the flood of being lukewarm the flood of being complacent the father being lazy the father being ungrateful second Timothy three spirit heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God we make time to do what you want to do but call a prayer meeting and you can't find the church that's the flood that we are dealing with this morning but when the enemy comes in like a flood I want to see some of you sure your job to the angel when he acts to see the token look my job look up as always I have him I work so much over time this is what will take me to the rapture are you foolish are you crazy your job is a means to an end it's not the end there's an end this attack your job is not the destination when the ceiling angel moved through Egypt I went from house to house all he was looking for was blood he didn't want to hear talk explanation reason and justification when let me send you an email about why I should pass by this house so pastor each of this night can smile all the firstborn but if I see blood I'll pass over if I see blood I'll pass over have you applied the blood on your house have you apply the blood in your life or are you so lazy about applying blood you now have so much time to do foolishness you find yourself living in sin because if you are busy to win courts business you don't have time oh you don't hear me this morning make yourself busy about the business of God and see God bless you see God make you prosper see God opened doors for you [Applause] yes there is a flood there's a flood in our marriages there's something very wrong in the message very wrong in the message when people when we have just as much separation in marriage as in the world it may not be visible separation but there's no love in the house there's something very wrong in the message remember the Branham labored and poor labored and Irina's labor and Martin labor and Columba labored to bring a message for us for us not to be different from the world we read the quote we ought to be different we also do better because we have been given much and so much is given much is expected if we spend more time praying and see you seeking the will of God we'd have less problems with our children less problems with our marriages less problems with the person next to us behind us in front of us but when the enemy comes back of Florida this spirit would raise a standard [Applause] no revival no breakthrough could come without sacrifice look through history every revival came because of prayer came because of sacrifice the Bible told him in that did dig a valley full of ditches you haven't had rain but take a valley but if you take the value could a rain is coming the more you take the more blessings that you're gonna get up and we are counting down 40 days up to our convention and I'm saying the time has come for us to dig if you have never talked before if you have never prayed before if you have never had before we are calling for a time of consecration in this church a time of God if you are in this church we are calling for 48 time of consecration what do you mean Verizon everyday in the morning you will make time to read you'll make time to pray you will cut movies out you will cut the television out you will tell another part if you have to there's one day we have a prayer faster week you make another T or D but you consecrate yourself up for God to do something in your family for cost to do something in your home you who have woolly music and okay how positive encouraging it is get it out draw it out of draw it out separate yourself from the unclean things up you ain't got to do something for you leave whatever you love leave it behind forget sports up forget it all the news can't even help you what we need is Jesus up we don't need more news we don't need more politics I don't need to know what Trump is doing we need more Jesus a time of consecration sanctify yourselves sanctify our Howsam sanctify our lives up you set time out for your own walk if Jesus had to pray how much won't we have to breathe what are you doing we're makeup what are you doing when the clothes you're wearing are you crazy and you want to come to the house of God and expect God to do something for you when the least that you can do he said present your bodies a living sacrifice of holy what is your reasonable service is that a hard thing to do it's reasonable for you to present your body as a living sacrifice [Applause] [Music] it's give me liberty or give me death there's no middle ground we could have no revival on middle ground we can only have revival if we are giving over all to God to many of us we give a lot we give 90% we give 92% we use 75% we have 99% but God is a jealous God and he wants all of you he wants everything he wants all your worship he was all your praise he was all your love he was all your adoration he was all your worship he wants to be your all and all he wants to be or everything up he wants to be the reason you woke up in the morning he wants to be your is there anybody in the house [Applause] the Holy Spirit is raising a standard here this morning it's not a new standard it's the same standard is the same standard that said sisters don't cut you here is the same standard that says you should cover your knees it's the same standard that says don't listen the world in music it's the same standard that says pray every day it's the same standard that says read every day is the same standard that says to forgive it's the same standard that says be holy is the same standard that says drop your hearts it's the same standard it's on the news 10 is the same standard God will have a perfect Church it could be three people it'd give me five people they could be ten people but all God I want to be one of them I want to be one of them sums with a flat sum to the flood but all through the blood you could be gonna play something softly [Applause] the worst place to ever be as a Christian is when you lose your sensitivity to the spirit because when the word goes forth there's conviction that lets you know Lord I'm not living right or Lord I need to do more Lord I've been trying but I could try more something should be happening friends if you stifle that voice after a while but the Branham said you will no longer hear it and you lose your sensitivity and when you lose your sensitivity you almost as good as fetish friends so I challenge you this morning if you hear that voice talking about your soul see him come back home make things right you have given so much time effort focus energy to so many other things and God is saying what about me what about my time what about your soul you spend so much time when the natural what about the things that I eat that will last I'm gonna every head bowed every eye closed wrote a sanctuary this morning maybe there's somebody here this morning maybe you have been in church for a while maybe you have not it doesn't matter this is not between you and the church is between you and God there's a call going out a cry going out to return unto the Lord yes there are floods yes there are trials yes they are testing but you are called to a higher purpose and God will never give you more than you could be here maybe you found yourself washing your net giving up on life giving up on everything but it's a word this morning and maybe like Simon Peter you say Lord at thy word I'm willing I'm willing to be a real Christian I'm willing to read the Word of God every day I'm willing to pray every day I'm willing to fast and seek your face and Lord if I have to die with the Philistines let me die with a Philistine but once more knowledge is there anybody in the house this morning is there anybody that feels I where this morning I want to open the altar right now to anybody you want to come and make your confession to God you wanna come I see that one is anybody else I'm not going to force you but you can come and you can kneel you can come and stand but you want to make your confession to God and say Lord I'm coming to try one more time I'll fish all night I've sat in church for a long time I've been through many trials and testing but I would or God I'm willing to try one more time Lord would you have me would you have me is anybody else I see that one is anybody else is there one more [Music] is there one
