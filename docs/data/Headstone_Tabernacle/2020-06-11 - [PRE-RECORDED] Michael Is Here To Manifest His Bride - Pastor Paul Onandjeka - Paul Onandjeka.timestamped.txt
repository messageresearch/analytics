[45:03] with him and the devil went unblocked
[45:06] that he changed should not come by
[45:10] refusing him a little pass on his in his
[45:13] place of job and you know but a poor
[45:17] return is his minister so how can the
[45:22] message flow true and this is an English
[45:25] country from nowhere where we are
[45:31] battling on what is also happening to
[45:34] other ministers are yet to come

[46:49] determined let me tell you the devil is
[46:52] fighting how to stop you don't give up
[46:56] don't give up I don't take no for an

[47:14] of I cannot make it how many of you were
[47:18] blessed at the moment that the choirs
[47:21] were singing where you blessed
[47:26] I appreciate a young yuria making a very
[47:33] wonderful difference in that sound I
[47:36] thought I thought maybe the original
[47:37] singer of the great player of that bass
[47:40] was already with us and had to come out
[47:42] to check who is playing this bass that's
[47:46] a great gift in our midst

[50:50] [Music]
[50:58] Priska domain yeah I'm going to have
[51:02] brother pour in a reading of the Bible
[51:05] viruses because our brother misplaced
[51:09] his eyeglasses so I will learn my eyes
[51:15] to the reading of the world I can never
[51:18] be the translator or the interpreter
[51:22] praise God I mean so okay the reading of
[51:31] the word and what a bore has for us to
[51:33] read if you have your scriptures turn to
[51:38] the scriptures open up to Hebrews
[51:41] chapter 10 from verse 5 to 7 and Daniel
[51:47] chapter 12 verse 1 and turning to
[51:58] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 5 to 7 he raised
[52:04] his wife so also Christ glorified not
[52:08] himself to be made an high priest but he
