off to eat not hole in the tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they had received a hole as the washing of cups

unto them well si had desires prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me albeit in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandments of God you hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things II do and he said unto them full well you reject the commandment of God that he may keep your own tradition for Moses said honor thy father and thy mother and who have acoustic father and mother let him die the dead but you see if a man shall see it is bad mother it is common that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by he shall be free and you suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother making the Word of God of none effect through your tradition which you have delivered and many such like things do ye and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can define him but the things which come out of him those are they that we fire the man if any man have ears to hear let him hear and when he had entered the house on the people he disciples asked him concerned a parable he said unto them ye saw without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever

if that's your works you have to accept Christ then something has to work in you to bring you out of what you in is not just you stop this and you stop this it's the operation of God Oh hallelujah Ephesians 4 something says this I say therefore brethren testify in the Lord that he answered walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God to the ignorance that is in them because of the planets of the heart who being past feeling have given themselves over the last offences to work all uncleanness with greediness but he have not so learned Christ so if be you have heard him and I've been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and that word conversation I want to get it in the amplifier you just ship yourselves of your form Anita put off and discard your all unrenewed self which characterized your previous manner of life and becomes corrupt to lust and desires that spring from delusion but be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude you have to do it Oh glory to God not just come to church but have an attitude or glory to God hallelujah therefore rejecting all falsity and being done with it let everyone express truth with his neighbor be zombiefied so we are part of one another members one of another when angry do not sin they will ever let a rat your fury lasts until the Sun Goes Down leave no room or foothold for the devil no opportunity for him let them that steal steal no more Marilla rather let him be industrious making an honest living with his own hands so that he may be able to give to those in need

order to give not getting order to hold for sighs you know get in order to give and the more you give us the more God give you Oh glory to God hallelujah the more you give the more God gives you you become a channel a pipe of flow of God's blessing hallelujah the worst thing is that give somebody you don't give the very best stuff right there the block the blessing but when you see the channels open up and they keep giving under giving and a given that's why you have to go the extra mile you have to make sacrifice this sacrifice is what makes it difference really Prince called hallelu if I make a sacrifice to ppl message to preach you hear the sacrifice then you make a sacrifice to pray to create the atmosphere for the service you make a sacrifice then you make a sacrifice to worship

want the Holy Spirit to be affected some people some people the holy speck I've affect them because they haven't their didn't know when early Holy Spirit but I'll make a powerful statement he said

become useful and helpful and kind to one another tender-hearted compassionate understanding loving hearted forgiving one another readily and freely as caught in Christ forgive you oh praise God Matthew 5:8 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God oh my hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah look at the carnival choose like a stick on these feathers it has to come from inside out by the power of the Holy Spirit so what has to work on you is a work of God not a work of man so I am preaching to you but the Holy Spirit of the operate the word to you by giving you revelation and breaking upon your life you could do it you know or you could do it there on your way home or you could do it when you get home you can do when your only way to the job but is the Holy Spirit upon your life business it has been the Holy Spirit at mini Ephesus church it was the Holy sprit uplifted the Smyrna church is the Holy to do all of that believe that there are no watch when in the individuals these virtues and things and knowledge that is added to faith then when the capstone comes the Holy Spirit cement step together there is the baton Holy Spirit that's why it's so short today from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seeing you in Christ then you become one and then that day you shall know I'm and the father the father me iron you you and me then that's a sealed unit of the Lord God no and then they are vindicated I'm pleased when that time comes takes place they become vindicated sons and vindicated taught us listen this watch the two spirits will be so close in the last days they'll be very see very elected the people can so live people can live clean listen holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers liars gamblers they can live above that and still not with it this is the age of life personal life of Christ so I like how he's bringing it because it doesn't put no groans with a sit down and sit back and relax it doesn't have that it have a push in and oppression into this glorious kingdom of or believe that hallelujah no the second work of sanctification the word means the clean and set aside for service well notice when the unclean spirit gone from a man he walks in dry places and it's clean it's pure and everything else and then when that demon come back on City Hall scream it gonna get seven other devils worse than before this one to barge into the house and the man condition is worse than offense at first yet one demon no we have seven no works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of the sieve life as a fruit unto God I believe in good works even if the man is not saved he ought to do good works do the best he can what a harbor in the sight of God for man to do evil works and then see that they are doing the will of God nothing what the bishop and Pope's and high rocky of Rome were doing they were killing and maiming and doing all manner of evil in the name of the Lord that is why why gamble the people are coming to life at the white throne judgment in the second resurrection of people
