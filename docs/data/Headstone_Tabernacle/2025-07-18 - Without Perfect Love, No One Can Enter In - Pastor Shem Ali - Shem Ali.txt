That'll be our scripture reading to open up this meetings. [Music] Psalm 84 reads on this wise. How amiable are thy tabernacles, oh Lord of hosts. My soul longeth, yay, even fainted for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh cried out for the living God. Yay, the sparrow had found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young, even dine altars. Oh Lord of hosts, my king and my God. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house. They will be still praising thee, Zilla. Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of Baka make it a well. The rain also filth the pools. They grew from strength to strength. Every one of them in Zion appeared before God. Oh Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer. Give ear, oh God of Jacob, sill. Behold, oh God, our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. For the Lord God is a son and shield. The Lord will give grace and glory. No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. Oh Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusted in thee. Amen. Do you believe that this afternoon? Amen. Let us pray together.

And sister Joy is going to sing a song about the mercy of God. God bless you. [Music] I'm living proof of what the mercy of God can do. If you knew me, then you believe me now. He turned my whole life upside down. Took the old and made it new. That's what the mercies of God can do. Now I'm alive to tell the story how I overcome. It's your goodness and mercy and the power of your blood. I'm so glad that my freedom wasn't based on what I've done. It's your goodness and mercy and the power of your blood. I thought I deserve to be six feet beneath the earth. [Music] For all the things I've done, the things I've said, choices made that I regret, I will still be lost. [Music] but for the mercies of God.

It's nothing but the amazing grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; I always ask myself that question. Out of 7 billion people in the world, why me? &gt;&gt; Just think of it. Why me? Why? Why would God choose you and I? 7 billion people. There are tall people out there, handsome, muscular. God chose me. &gt;&gt; We should be We should be thankful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord this morning or this afternoon? &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Oie gets ready to come forward, let's do the song. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. Well, the love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love is so wonderful. Oh, wonderful. Love, it is so high. You can't get over it. So, oh, you can't get under it. So why you can't get around it. Oh, let's go up. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. Oh, wonderful love. And it is, [Applause] it is so low. You can't get under it. So why you can't get around it? Oh, wonderful love. Oh, and the love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful, Lord. Oh, it is. You can't get over it. So, can't get over so well. Oh, love of Jesus. The love of Jesus. The love of Jesus. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. So high. So high. You can't get over it. So you can't get under it. So we can't get around it. One more time. Blood of Jesus. Love of Jesus. [Music] Love of Jesus. Love of Jesus. Oh, wonderful God. Father, we thank you and praise you for your presence here tonight. We invite you to have the preeminences in Jesus name. Amen and amen. God bless you. Have your seat. Amen. God bless you and welcome to our international 2025 convention. &gt;&gt; We certainly happy to have you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have some ministers here among us. Like to welcome brother uh Tux Singh, brother Green, brother Norris, brother Andrew Fong, praise God, brother Alexis from uh from uh Kivoir, brother Etian man, brother Paulica, uh brother Stephanus from Germany and brother Raymond Thompson from South Africa. We welcome all of you. If there's any other minister here, we want to say God bless you and welcome. We appreciate uh what the Lord is doing. I just want to just say a few words. Uh before the speaker come, we have blessed this evening. We have brother Shem Ali going to be speaking for us this morning to to open up this convention. Praise God. We certainly appreciate him. And also brother Josh Gujarat will bring greetings and we're going to sing on special and bring greetings before he comes on. Amen. But this is brother Brandham. He said, "Always in the days gone by, the dispensation has always come to an end. There are junctions in the highway. There are junctions in the road. And it the junction on the highway that we travel to glory. And he said it always it takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence. &gt;&gt; It takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence. Teaching of the word is very fine and we and faith come by hearing and hearing the word. But it always take the miraculous to vindicate that omnipotence still lives and reign. &gt;&gt; Then he said this and I believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known. Oh praise God. The greatest vindication of omnipotence. Praise. And the most powerful thing in the world is love. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The most powerful thing, praise God, is the love of God. I'm so glad to hear that song. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. It's so high, you can't get over it. It's so low, you can't get around it. It could bring your mother, could bring your father, it could bring your brother, it could bring your minister, daughter, whoever, whosoever will, it could bring them. Don't give up on anyone because the love of Jesus is so wonderful. Amen. Watch God always always where he starts something new. &gt;&gt; He always show forth his power. &gt;&gt; Just before the junctions enter new dispensation, he appears on the scene with great miraculous signs and wonders. He has always done it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. He has always done it. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. At this time, I want to invite brother Joash, praise the name of the Lord, to come forward and he going to have a special for you. Praise God. Amen. Praise God. You're going to hear from God's servant going to speak to us today. Amen. God bless your virtual. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love him, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be with you this evening that you're in the presence of the most high God. Amen. I believe it was David who said one time, "I once was young, now I'm old, but I've never seen the righteous forsaken." &gt;&gt; No, his seed begging bread. Amen. This &gt;&gt; this little song is uh testament of that truth [Music] as I kneel in the darkness in the middle of Tonight I'm praying for assurance that everything's going to be all right. Lord, I see another valley and it's out in front of me. I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat. But he said, "Do you remember just where I brought you from? Just take a look behind you and see how far you've come." And every time you asked me, "Didn't I deliver you?" Then why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? Didn't I walk on the water and I calmed the raging sea? I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I roam to your rescue? Didn't I hear you when you call? I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of heaven just to die for your sins? I searched until I found you. And I do it all again. Now she's talking to her father in a house that was once a home. She said, "My bills are getting due, Lord. And six days is not that long." Then she hears a voice both still and low. He said, "I move like that before and I'll do this little thing, child, but I'll give you so much more. Didn't I walk on the water and I calmed the region sea? I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I come to your rescue? Didn't I hear you when you called? I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of heaven just to die for your sins? I searched until I found you and I'd do it all again. I put food on your table when the bills were due. When the pains were racking your body, I sent healing down to you. When you were lost in sin and sorrow, I died to set you free so that you would know just how much I love you. Let's sing that again. Oh, put food on your table. Showed up when the bills were due. And when the pains were rocking your body, I sent healing down to you. Then you were lost in sin and sorrow. I died to set you free so that you would know just how much I love you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] When you are lost in sin and sorrow, I had to set you free so that you would know just how much I [Music] Glory to God. [Applause] Amen. Amen. Ain't God good for giving us so many blessings? &gt;&gt; Be seated my dear friends. Don't want to be very long. I want to bring the minister on. So good to be in the house of God today &gt;&gt; and to be among brethren of like precious faith. &gt;&gt; You know friends in seeking the Lord's guidance with respect to these few opening remarks and what I should say as a precursor to all that is soon to follow. Impressed very strongly upon me was the story of King David and his little band of faithful warriors as told in 2 Samuel chapter 23. beginning about uh verse 14. And friends, I have to admit, the more I meditated upon the scene which might have unfolded that day as the king and his men stood on the outskirts of the city, looking on in dismay as Bethlehem, the house of God's bread, was garrisoned about by the invading Philistine armies. The more I meditated upon that scene, the more convinced I was that in this particular convention meeting where there is assembled this afternoon from different parts of the world another little band of mighty gentile warriors. Perhaps the greatest thing that we could accomplish over the course of the next three days, the one thing that would make all the planning and all the preparation worth its weight in gold is if we like those brothers back there could supernaturally pick up the mind of our king, &gt;&gt; the great lion king, &gt;&gt; the one who has descended and is now calling for his queen to come and stand at his side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If we like those brethren back there, friends, we could supernaturally discern the desires of our king's heart &gt;&gt; and be just as determined as they were to do all that it takes to bring him a fresh drink, &gt;&gt; not just from any old broken sister now, &gt;&gt; but from the living waters of that well in Bethlehem, &gt;&gt; from the fountain that is even right now open in the house of David. If only we could accomplish these things. And I'm saying to you, maybe our coming would not be in vain. &gt;&gt; In December of 1963, God and prophet is in Phoenix, Arizona. He's preaching a message entitled Why Little Bethlehem? &gt;&gt; And somewhere around paragraph 138, the same spirit that anointed David back there, it begins speaking through the prophet in a very peculiar way. And it begins throwing out the very same challenge. Here what he says. Oh, come stand with me &gt;&gt; by my side. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm standing in a terrible place. I challenge you today." &gt;&gt; These tapes go all over the world. I challenge some man, some warrior who loves Jesus Christ that knows that these things got to be fulfilled today. Brethren, come stand by my side &gt;&gt; and pull the word of God. &gt;&gt; Forget those dried sisters and stagnated denominations that you're living in. Pull the fresh word of God. He says, "Let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh Pentecostal water." &gt;&gt; He says that's his desire today. Back to the original Pentecost. Back to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He continues in paragraph 143 saying, "Oh men of God, where is that sword?" &gt;&gt; Our Lord desires a fresh drink. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's life or death. Let's cut through this thing. It's so hard standing by yourself. I'm calling for men to stand by me. Stand with the word. &gt;&gt; What that word says, do it just the way the word said. &gt;&gt; I don't care what anything else says. Stay with it that way. But that's the only thing that will cut. &gt;&gt; Let us get to Bethlehem for the true water of God. He says &gt;&gt; then in paragraph 145, the prophet says here what he says. Bashm, God is going to have a people &gt;&gt; that will drink from that well. &gt;&gt; Prophet screams out, hallelujah. [Applause] Now friends, what we need to understand is this. At the time when this challenge was being made, no one present quite understood why bringing the Christ the king a fresh drink would prove to be such a daunting task. &gt;&gt; Nobody understood it. &gt;&gt; But almost exactly two years later in November of 1965, the prophet of God is approaching the climax of his ministry now. And just about a month before he's called off of the scene, he's in Shreveport, Louisiana. &gt;&gt; And he's preaching a message now, brother Norris, God's only provided place of worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is only when you consider the many things which he proceeds to lay out in his delivery of this sermon do you begin to really understand why it is virtually impossible but for anybody but the true anointed of God to bring the king a fresh drink today. &gt;&gt; Hear why it's such a challenge. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 49. And you hear the prophet saying there is the possibility of a person worshiping God in vain with sincere worship. &gt;&gt; And you ask yourself where is this coming from? Just about a month before the messenger fades off the scene. And this is the message going forward. Being sincere is not even enough anymore. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 50. You hear the prophet saying God just has one key now. &gt;&gt; There's just one key to every door. He has no skeleton key. He has got one key. You've got to have that key. He says or the door won't open no matter how sincere you are. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 52, you hear the prophet saying David was an anointed king. He was he was genuine in his desire to do God a service. He said, but when he commissioned the construction of a new cart to carry the word, the prophet says God dishonored the whole move. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he did not use the right key. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 79, you hear the prophet saying, "If there is one place that God meets with man today, then we had better be very careful." &gt;&gt; He says, "Let us lay aside our traditions now and be very sure that we find that one place." &gt;&gt; Paragraph 82, Brother Abraham showing us how finding that one provided place goes beyond sincerity. He picks up the story of Cain and Abel. He says Cain's sacrifice was not vindicated but Abel's sacrifice was vindicated. Why? Because Abel struck the true channel of God. &gt;&gt; And I dare say friends, this is what we are here to do in this convention this evening. This is what every worshipper is supposed to be striving for. This is what every God call ministry has been commissioned to do to strike the true channel of God today. Break into an inspiration that will elevate the people into the realms of rapturing faith. Paragraph 86. The prophet picks up Balam and Moses. I'm just showing you why it's a challenge. &gt;&gt; He picks up Balon and Moses. He says, "Fundamentally, Balam and Moses, you couldn't tell them apart. &gt;&gt; Both of them erected seven altars. In numerology, they were exactly the same." But Brandham says, "As fundamental as one was, the other one was also." He said, "But who did God vindicate?" The one that was in his word. &gt;&gt; Fundamental doesn't mean too much. He says, "It is the revelation of God." &gt;&gt; Paragraph 89, we hear the prophet saying, "You could take a good live egg, put it under a dead, and it will not hatch." &gt;&gt; He says, "The conditions have to be right, brother." &gt;&gt; And you ask me something, friends, listen. When it comes to this meeting and what we are able to accomplish for the kingdom, this is the bottom line. The overall conditions have to be right. The word inspiration has to be right. Our individual lives must be in the right condition. Our attitude to the Lord's service must be right. Our attitude towards each other has to be right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come to paragraph 90. And the prophet really begins to put the icing on the cake. He says, "Well, that's the way it is in this age that we're living in." You've got to find what is God's way of doing it for this age. &gt;&gt; Not everybody has access to that. Well, &gt;&gt; amen. The prophet says you got to find what is God's way of doing it for this age. That is what Martin Luther found. That is what John Wesley found. That is what the Pentecostals found in their age. God's age and time to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying to you friends, this thing does not come automatically. Every individual believer has to find that place where the anointing oil has been poured out again. &gt;&gt; Our spiritual Bethlehem, where our king has been anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so what we're going to do as I conclude my few remarks, we're going to pray the same prayer &gt;&gt; that the prophet prayed when he came to the end of that sermon, Why Bethlehem? Hear the prayer. Paragraph 176. Oh God, &gt;&gt; anoint us with thy word &gt;&gt; and bring thy word promised to for this day to pass. &gt;&gt; May we leave this building this morning as shining instruments of God. May we go with the sword, it glittering in the air &gt;&gt; to cut away every weight and everything else &gt;&gt; till we can get the people back to Christ &gt;&gt; and bring a cool, fresh drink to our Lord instead of all these old stagnated creeds. Let the people drink from the fountain. a real cool refreshing Pentecostal blessing &gt;&gt; that it might bless his heart and bring him back among us again. &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord in Jesus name I pray. &gt;&gt; Let the bride say amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you church say amen. &gt;&gt; You appreciate brother Josh. Wonderful. Hallelujah. Amen. It's an honor and privilege to invite brother Shem Ali to the pulpit. And as he comes, let's do the song. I am redeemed. I've been bought with a price. Oh Jesus, he has changed my whole life. Oh, if anybody asks you just who I am. Oh, tell them. Oh, that I am redeemed. Oh, sing it again. Oh, I am redeemed. I've been above the weight of cross. Oh Jesus, he has changed my whole life. If anybody ask you, if anybody asks you just who I am, who tell them that I am redeemed. [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Kindly take your seats tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; I would like to first greet the elect lady, the lovely bride of the Lord Jesus Christ, without whom these meetings would not have been possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. is also with great joy and respect.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I am deeply honored and humbled to be with you at this convention &gt;&gt; and I thank God for this opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of course, these three days We will worship together. &gt;&gt; We will pray together. &gt;&gt; We'll open the scriptures together. &gt;&gt; But more than anything, I pray we encounter Jesus in a most outstanding way. Not just as a concept of doctrine, &gt;&gt; but as a living Christ &gt;&gt; who walks among us &gt;&gt; and speaks to us &gt;&gt; with an everlasting love. So thank you again for the invitation &gt;&gt; and for the trust and for the grace to be among you. &gt;&gt; Let us approach this convention not just as an event but as a sacred appointment. &gt;&gt; May our hearts be open. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; May our minds be attentive. Amen. &gt;&gt; And may the Holy Spirit have his way. I am quoting from the message faith once delivered to the saints 1953 57 paragraph three where the prophet of God was saying I am trusting that this convention &gt;&gt; will be one of the most outstanding conventions that this group &gt;&gt; has at any time. &gt;&gt; Not because I am with you again this time, but because I think it's time that the great church of the living God stand to her feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And shook &gt;&gt; herself and get ready. Amen. In a message what here is thou Elijah 1959 paragraph five the prophet is praying. He says I pray Lord that you will bless this convention. Just let this be a different convention. Amen. &gt;&gt; Different convention than what we have had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make it in the same manner but greater Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; May there be may there just be something that will sit down by the side of the burning bush and listen to what he has to say during this time. &gt;&gt; May we wait upon him for we know that he is our strength &gt;&gt; and our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us, Father, &gt;&gt; in the time of these meetings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we sat under the shade tree &gt;&gt; as it was in the school, help us to know more of thee &gt;&gt; so that we can go from this convention &gt;&gt; better equipped &gt;&gt; than we were &gt;&gt; when we came in. But we ask it in the name amen of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just invite you to stand, saints of God. Amen. As we bow heads, we like to pray. Gracious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; we are very thankful tonight that &gt;&gt; this convention was in your mind before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You thought of it, Lord.

You thought of Lord what they would minister on. You thought of the subject Lord. You thought of everything. Father, you thought of the members of the lady that would be here.

It reads, "Beloved, let us love one another, &gt;&gt; for love is of God." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And everyone that loveth is born of God, &gt;&gt; and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. &gt;&gt; And this was manifested the love of God towards us &gt;&gt; because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. &gt;&gt; Amen. hearing his love. Not that we love God, but that he loved us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. &gt;&gt; Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man has seen God at any time. &gt;&gt; If we have love one to another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us. &gt;&gt; Like to read one more scripture. First Corinthian 13. It says, "And now abided faith, charity, faith, hope and charity, oh love, these three, but the greatest is charity." &gt;&gt; Kindly take your seat, saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When our prophet, when our vindicated prophet was quartered beyond the curtain of time and had returned, he faithfully shared his experience with the universal bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which the true bride believes without question. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And in the message rejected, King reed of his wonderful and most encouraging and most enlightening experience as he related it in 1960 paragraph 146 of rejected king. He went on to say, "I heard a voice that spoke to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which means, saints of God, it had to be a supernatural voice. &gt;&gt; That was in the room. And it said this is what you preached &gt;&gt; was your Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This is perfect love. &gt;&gt; And nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And since he was speaking to bride to persons, Amen. He said no person sorry and nothing &gt;&gt; or no person or not a single person no exception can enter here &gt;&gt; without it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can enter here without it. &gt;&gt; Amen. that perfect love. &gt;&gt; I am more determined &gt;&gt; than ever in my life &gt;&gt; that it takes perfect love &gt;&gt; to enter there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that includes me. lose this philosophy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no jealousy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, there was no envious feeling &gt;&gt; of resentment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no tiredness. &gt;&gt; There was no death. &gt;&gt; There was no sickness. can never enter there. &gt;&gt; Mortality can never make you old. They couldn't cry. Paragraph 164. Oh my precious friends, my precious darlings of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. My begotten children unto God, listen to me, your pastor. I wish there was some way I could tell it to you. There's no words. I couldn't find it. It's not found anywhere. &gt;&gt; But just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing. Amen. You ever &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Most glorious which means very beautiful &gt;&gt; and very impressive. &gt;&gt; There's no way to explain it. &gt;&gt; I just can't do it. &gt;&gt; Whatever Whatever you do, friends, &gt;&gt; lay aside everything. In other words, lay aside the glitter and the glamour of the womb &gt;&gt; till you get perfect love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is tremendously important to each one of us. Get to a spot that you can love everybody, &gt;&gt; every enemy. &gt;&gt; That one visit there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To me has made me a different man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can never never be &gt;&gt; the same brother Bernie. that I was. &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverb 172. &gt;&gt; I am sure Lord &gt;&gt; if this little church this morning can look just look past the curtain. &gt;&gt; Not an affliction among them. No, never could be &gt;&gt; not a sickness, &gt;&gt; nothing but perfection. &gt;&gt; And it's just one breath &gt;&gt; between here and there. &gt;&gt; From old age to youth, &gt;&gt; from time to eternity. &gt;&gt; And truly, Father, nothing can enter &gt;&gt; that holy place. with that type of love, &gt;&gt; the new birth &gt;&gt; to be born again. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; God is love. &gt;&gt; And we know that that is true. &gt;&gt; No matter if we move mountains by faith, Amen. &gt;&gt; If we did great things still without still without that day or that perfect love, we can never climb that great ladder &gt;&gt; yonder. In other words, without perfect love. But that with but without love it will take us beyond this earthly cares. Paragraph 176 in his prayer. Amen. four and with the people that he was ministering to, he asked them to repeat, "Say, Lord, place within my heart &gt;&gt; and in my soul &gt;&gt; that I may love and honor and have that divine love &gt;&gt; in my heart today that would take me to the land when my final breath leads me. Amen. Leaves me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So without perfect love, friends, we cannot enter into the six &gt;&gt; or the seven dimension which is the dimension of love. It's the dimension of eternal love. And I'd like to read to you first John 4 and 8. For it says that God is love. &gt;&gt; It's what is it's what he is. &gt;&gt; He is love. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; For love is not just an attribute of God &gt;&gt; or divine quality of God &gt;&gt; or divine virtue of God. &gt;&gt; Love is the very nature &gt;&gt; of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Love is what he is. [Applause] He is the very source and fountain of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love or gapy love or divine love had its origin in God. &gt;&gt; Amen.

It will continue on from time &gt;&gt; into eternity. &gt;&gt; It will continue on &gt;&gt; from earth to heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm quoting from the message love &gt;&gt; 57 paragraph nine.

It's the most powerful force &gt;&gt; that the world has &gt;&gt; because God is love &gt;&gt; and there is no more powerful force &gt;&gt; than God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And love is one of the greatest things I can speak on. Amen.

I think if one thing, not two things, not three, amen, if one thing is needed in the universal church of God tonight is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. quote continues. &gt;&gt; We do not need our gifts &gt;&gt; and our emotions as much as we think we do, &gt;&gt; though they are wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. To God and to God we give praise &gt;&gt; that we have them. &gt;&gt; But if these gifts &gt;&gt; are not governed by love, Amen. &gt;&gt; They must be governed and controlled by love. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If these gifts are not governed by love, they are not effective. [Applause] Instead of resting our faith on some kind, some emotion &gt;&gt; which is all right like shouting or speaking in tongues, we should rest our faith upon the love of God. &gt;&gt; We should rest our faith upon the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go continues. &gt;&gt; Love is the main thing. &gt;&gt; Love is the main thing. This the main thing may tren us tonight. That love is the main thing.

Quote continues, "Whether it be prophecy, &gt;&gt; they shall fail." &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Where there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now abideth, &gt;&gt; fake, hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the greatest of these &gt;&gt; is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest of these is love. Love is the greatest. Nothing will ever be greater for God is love.

That's why we have been transformed into his likeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said in John 13:34, "A new commandment I give unto you, &gt;&gt; Amen, that you love one another as I have loved you, as I have loved you." Amen. Let us love one another as he loved us. Amen. In the same way. And with the same uh quality and type of love, amen, that he loved us with, let us love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, love suffered long. Love uh is kind. Love envth not. Love vaunted not itself. Love is not a braggot. Love is not proud. Love is not boastful. Love Amen. Seek not own. It is not easily provoked. Amen. Love thinkketh no evil. Love rejoicth not. Amen. In iniquity. Love rejoices in truth. It tells us what love does. And first Corinthian tells us what love does and what love doesn't do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh s. &gt;&gt; It tells us what love does and what love doesn't do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to know saints of God we use this word out there. Amen. But love, true love, divine love has become the hallmark &gt;&gt; of the true believers. &gt;&gt; The hallmark saints &gt;&gt; of the true believers. &gt;&gt; How we thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How we bless his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. Amen. All right, let's run it through quickly. Saints of God, I'm quoting from desperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. 63 paragraph. Amen. 62 68 rather. Now the word plainly states, &gt;&gt; if you want to put down Galatians 5 and 6, this is very very important things. Faith workketh by love &gt;&gt; and the only way &gt;&gt; that you can have faith &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; is to have love &gt;&gt; is to have love &gt;&gt; because God is &gt;&gt; here with the prophet says Amen. You can have faith is to have you you have love first. Love is faith's incentive. &gt;&gt; If you don't have love, you can't have faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Divine love is faith incentive. &gt;&gt; You know what incentive means? Amen. Love influences or encourages faith to act. &gt;&gt; Love encourages faith to act. It gives faith the support and the confidence to help. Amen. Oh saints of God. Amen. To develop it faith life tonight. &gt;&gt; It's faith sensitive. &gt;&gt; You can't have love cannot have faith without love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saints of God. You must have loved us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want you to see saints, you see, then it means you could only have faith in proportion to your love. &gt;&gt; You could claim with much faith to move mountains. Amen. But if you don't have love, brother, &gt;&gt; it must be in proportion &gt;&gt; to your love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, saints. &gt;&gt; So if a person boasts of having great faith, Amen. and have not love. &gt;&gt; He's only saying he have faith. &gt;&gt; He don't really have faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All sins, his boasting is in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he says, "I'm a person of great love." Amen. Then you'll see the manifestation of great faith, saints of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul gave us an inspired description, amen, of love &gt;&gt; and being anointed by the Holy Spirit. He began to show the difference between the gifts. Amen. Tongues of men and of angels. Amen. He began to show the difference between Amen. and man's eloquence and the tongs of angels. Then he continued to show the difference between the gift of prophecy and understanding all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. And having faith to move mountains. &gt;&gt; And these are the things that man in that day. Amen. Even highly pride themselves with. Amen. &gt;&gt; Men bo post boast about their eloquence. &gt;&gt; They boast about their charisma, &gt;&gt; their photographic memory, their personal magnetism, and how deep they are in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But Paul says, "Amen." You can boast of all of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you have if you have not love &gt;&gt; Amen. You are nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are nothing. Say, &gt;&gt; "Boy, am I real deep? Amen. &gt;&gt; He have a way of drawing people to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They praise themselves in Paul's day and even today saints of God. &gt;&gt; We're the same things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let me close. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There were another service this evening. Amen. And saints of God, Paul concluded his remarks. He said, "Love never failth. &gt;&gt; Not ever, &gt;&gt; not at all. &gt;&gt; Surely not. &gt;&gt; Love will never fail. [Applause] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether prophecies, they shall fail. &gt;&gt; Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. &gt;&gt; Shall come to an end. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. &gt;&gt; Completely cease to exist. &gt;&gt; Now abideth. faith, hope, love, deep free. &gt;&gt; But the greatest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints of God, I want you to see this cause there's something called giving love the preeminence. It's called the preeminence of love. &gt;&gt; Giving love the first place. &gt;&gt; Place love beyond and above and superior to every other thing. &gt;&gt; That is giving love &gt;&gt; the preeminence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's first in my life. It's beyond. It's beyond and it's be above and it's superior to every other thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it s amen. I'm quoting from blind Bus.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet say God is Lord. &gt;&gt; He is a guppy. &gt;&gt; Love is the greatest of all. &gt;&gt; Humble yourself. &gt;&gt; 63 and 12. Just think if so great. &gt;&gt; What we call power. Paul said, "Though I have faith to move mountains and have not love, &gt;&gt; I am nothing." &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; The main thing is love &gt;&gt; is the foremost &gt;&gt; in importance is a principle of the chief thing. &gt;&gt; I'm quoting from unit 19 sign and time 63.
