way to speak your word Jesus name I ask it amen amen so tonight I have two portion of scriptures to read Hebrews 11 verse1 and Romans 1:16 and 17 Hebrews 11 verse1 now Faith is the substance of things who fall the evidence of Things Not Seen and Romans 1 verse 16 Paul speaks and I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power under the Salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for daring is the righteousness of God R from Faith to Faith and it is written the just shall live by faith amen you may be seated praise the Lord I appreciate the messages that have gone forth Sal andern brother Peter Chandler Rapture in F material and also as it was in heaven we were tremendously blessed so tonight have a title now Faith is not tomorrow not next week but tonight now now is praise God is I appreciate the inspiration perfect Fai for perfect Rapture so this Rapture is not for any and anybody this Rapture people that believe that he going to come to perfection I have some good news tonight God has ordained a fful Ministry to bring that bride to that Perfection so you are going to come to Perfection this is not about the minister this is about you Jesus died to get you Jesus died to call you Jesus died to redeem you it has always been about you oh Blessed Be of the Lord praise God so PA and the amplifi of Romans 1:7 he said the righteousness of God is revealed and springing from faith and leading to Faith which arouses more Faith so faith is not stagnant faith can grow fa can be aroused Fai can ripen can mature so faith can grow and the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith so you can leave that tonight with a greater faith you can leave that tonight with a ripen fa now oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God brother the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it will bring every person into its character because it's a spirit that leads you it makes you subject to its nature so whatever is leading you brings you into subjection the Holy Spirit by seven perfect Spirits want to overshadow you because that is the perfection seven perfect Spirit back to Elohim in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God but before the beginning before beginning you were there Lucifer Lucifer the devil the he came in the beginning but you were there before the beginning Oh Glory to God oh GL Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the Holy Spirit the spirit makes you give up the things of the world he said and the Holy Spirit make you live and love to do it how love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in something coming in it will come in tonight the word is spirit the spirit is word word that I speak unto you said Jesus it spirit and in life the word itself is God and as a re rece the word you become the word as you receive the word you become the word as many as receive him the word to them he gave power to become the Son of God you are going to receive power not just words but to be the sons of God this Rapture these Rapture power to leave here you have to have wapt your power to get rapture in power you have to have wapt your faith down glory to God hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated do do you know brother Bram he spoke about Rapture power called it Rapture power that not message talk that is not message interpretation en walked with God but before he leave him he had a testimony and before you leave him you have testimony oh GL you will haveon and without F without faith you can't please God tonight now Faith is be seated he G Men a true road map to his power there is a map and there's a path to get to this [Music] power you say a road map is something that tells you which way you are headed and when you cross the country back and forth back and forth you know where the p is at you know where the bad road is at you know this way and [Music] pass because you have traveled that road the road so listen to this and that's the way God want us to know his word we have traveled it we have tested it we have tried it and you know where it leads to let's go his road map is the Bible the Bible is the road map that leads to the power of God the Bible then he said Faith leads you to the power why did God send a prophet to turn our hearts back to the faith of the father and that Faith going to lead us in the power not argument so Malachi 4 was sent to turn on her back to the Fai of the Father by seven tunders revealing the hidden Myster sealed under Revelation 10 3 and four that angel voice and when like when a lion Ro and when he C and when the seven I was about to write God told him seal it seal it the devil know nothing about it nothing about but you are will be sealed with it because you Mysteries the mystery you you you are a mystery the Myst that Myster who you are will be sealed you shall be sealed you shall oh blessed be the name of Lord glory to God these promis seven tunders is to give the bright Faith it's to show how to prepar it's to the Bri together it's to it voices it's a gift by power and authority promise seven tunders would be the price Revival in mechanics and Dynamics in word and spirit these seven Thunders held the book of redemption your name your name was in that book and the lamb forward took the to lose your name no devil could stop you connect your name your name the to God hallelujah hallelujah you be seated may be seated in a minute when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that could be anybody any sister anybody but when Mary was walking one day and the angel said he Mary fa Mary was in service that [Applause] prophecy for years Mary didn't know that prophecy was about her Mary thought it was for everybody but when the angel came the angel came and the angel is here tonight the holy spirit is here hallelujah hallelujah so when Mary heard the voice of the Angel it was all about her and you know what she told the angel she said be it done unto me me me according to Thy word when you get a revelation your name on the book he's not talking to the brother behind you he's not talking to the brother in front of you he talking to you he speaking to you and falling your name now Faith is Mary didn't have a general Fai when the angel spoke to Mary it was a personed f it was about her she only had one question how shall this be and the angel said the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the holy GH Dynamic l o e o love charity dnamic Power Glory how shall it be get a [Applause] Revival Dynamics Holy Spirit the power will come upon you do you believe it now Faith is do you believe it let me get closer now you believe the Holy Ghost will come upon you let's bring it closer let's bring it closer because now Faith is do you believe it can come upon you tonight tonight tonight Oh Glory to God oh GL may be seated hallelujah praise God so this book this book held the Redemption plan of how to get back to Eden book was sealed until the last days the revelation of this book reveals your inheritance what you must ask for in other words God want to hear from your [Music] mouth and you cannot claim anything until you know by Revelation it is your own when you know this land is my land you can fight for it you can fight for it if you know heal is yours God you can fight for the revelation of this book reveals your Redemptive rights so watch this last night Friday night that day on Calvary when Jesus died he didn't die just to save your soul let's go deeper he died to get the book this book is what Adam [Music] lost Adam was to call your name but Adam lost the book and the book went back to God so Jesus Took the book The Mighty Angel brought down the book the Willam this book is here toight this book is here tonight Revelation 10y verse 8 I Heard a Voice John represent the bride I Heard a Voice called to the angel I said give me give me the book and I took the book I eat the book prophesy wees tonight we have the testimony of Jesus Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory this inspiration is the testimony of Jesus this inspiration is the spirit of Prophecy Spirit of Prophecy there going to be a [Applause] rapture Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah when I see all these message churches dead churches with no worship with no praise I know something is wrong when joh like brother Peter said when John saw John you can't see somebody else you have to see [Applause] you when John saw John when John saw his name he said all in heaven all under the Earth heard I praise God John's worship past dimensions wor was so powerful his Praises break into the superatural [Applause] realm your Worship ising in heaven as it is in heaven in heav it is in heav hallelujah hallelujah all be seated all that Jesus died for was written in the book he could not leave his medor seat he had thoroughly redeemed now that word redeem is not saved to redeem is to bring you back to where you come from you are not from Ivory coat you are from Eden you are going back to Eden you are going back to all that Adam lost all that lost coming back it's coming back it's coming back Hallelujah Adam Adam Adam had the higher Ministry to speak the word he me listen had the higher [Music] Ministry speak the word because he was a [Music] God [Applause] God and for anything to happen God must speak that's the only way for anything to happen he must speak God reveal his will to Moses mes go along there and call for flyes if Moses keep his mouth shut no flies was coming the only wayes could come the word had to come on mes mou and you have got to speak the word for your husband for your wife speak the word for children your grandchildren word has to come out your mouth my wife shall be [Applause] delivered my husband shall be delivered my children shall be delivered I shall be healed I shall be delivered I shall be free the word comes out your mouth it will not be out of the mouth it will come back with something praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so Jesus had to stay intercessory last one was redeemed to be redeemed is to be brought from Faith straight up the charity that's Redemption so first he redeem your soul by the Holy Ghost then he redeem your spirit give you seven perfect Spirit and the final part is the body the Redemption of the body there are three parts your soul your spirit and your body and when the anointing stri this body this world can't hold you have to leave here you're walking like Enoch oh praise God but I want you to listen to this brother the title lead of [Applause] redemption [Applause] tit bless my brother bless my brother hallelujah hallelujah Glory the title deed of creation is in his hand and he come to claim it back for the human race which it was given to make sons and daughters again so this book had the power to make sons and daughters again when Jesus died when he stepped forward he said said he comes forth to claim his Redemptive rights claim it for who who was Jesus came it for not for himself but for us for us he is one of us he is our King FK he is my brother he my friend he is my savior he my S he is my God he is my kman redeemer Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so watch this God promised to send a true Prophet with a message to return to the original word of God and the faith of the fathers listen to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost [Music] what has the message come to many arguing about [Music] Mysteries but no power but this Fai have a purpose faith is Talk Works is Faith [Music] expressed faith is not words now Faith is Faith is something inside your soul God put it there that's why you are here tonight brought you you saying ameni make you worship you are here by faith we are preaching by faith now Faith is you can be healed tonight you can be sealight you can be glory to God so listen to this I say it again the message to return to the original word and the faith of the father to bring down the power of the Holy Ghost among the people the power Among [Music] Us Solomon return and it's perfect because the message full of Rascals you have to Des I know this is of the word that is off the word that is off the word mess is a onean message we don't have two prophets we don't have three prophets we don't have four prophets only have one Prophet behold I send you El prophet and he shall turn your hearts back we have one message glory to God let's go all the Mysteries both hidden and written have one purpose that purpose is to get us ready for the Rapture all the messages M all the sermons all the teachings is for one purpose to get us ready for the Rapture a perfect for a perfect Rapture this is a true call Perfection said all these brothers obtain a good report through faith God having provided some better things for us that they without us they need us they can't raise without us we are the magnet bride we going to pull them out waited you and they can't come up on their own we have to pull them up Christ in the bride would pull them up Christ would step into your shoes Jesus put on your clothes Jesus step to you and there will be a resurrection there will be a Rapture God this church has got perfection not I am in the message that is not Perfection I believe this I believe that even the devil believe and tremble is not what you believe have got to come to Perfection a perfect walk a perfect talk perfect a perfect life perfect listen God cannot ask of us what we cannot produce if God told Abraham walk before me and be perfect you can have a perfect heart towards God God called David a man after my own a heart for God oh glory to God so watch this now justification made for Sanic for Holy GH come down in Perfection and back to the word to manifest itself God will not vindicate some Minister idea God will not vindicate some Minister thoughts God knows what he spoke out that prophet's mouth he knows exactly he said to that prophet and when we say what the tap say to vindicate it because God can't lie lie there will be a Revival in every Co no devil stop it can stop it your failures cannot stop it for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it when God speaks it's got to come to pass Oh Glory to God glory to God so three elements came out of Christ body CH truck it water three elements water justification blood Sanic Spirit Holy Ghost now this last great step coming into Perfection there a prophecy hanging over you hanging over us step this baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] step must come into Perfection and he going to describe it now so we don't have to imagine what is like to describe what he's talking about must come into perfection that the Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it will make the head and body unite together do you get a church you get it this Perfection has to do not with the sermons this have to do with the holy spirit because the seron the word conductor of the spirit and if the man have the word in him God is not using the man he's using the word in the and the word is a conductor of the spirit so tonight God want to flow freely so God looking for dead man God looking for man of God Jesus are dead men seated note when Moses with his intellectual conception of being a deliverer because his mother told him so child you are special you were born for a purpose you are supposed to be deliverer hallelujah hallelujah H hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah reation yet it's not real yet all he got is a jump and Hallelujah when Moses killed that one man he ran straight out of Egypt out of Egypt but when God chose you for a purpose he can't change his mind he has to find you he has to get you he has to come to you for 40 yearses settled down he have business you have a wife you have children and one day when God look at his time he said time up time up up up I heard a cry of my people and I come down note God couldn't come and pull them out of Egypt no no he come down get a man to go to [Applause] Egypt watch this we know the story Fire come down to attract Moses attention Moses went up there him I can't talk I could hardly walk God said come on you have any more excuses my wife leave me I lost my job you have any excuses when God finished with Moses his wife she say honey where you going he said to Egypt what for to take over what is Moses saying now Faith is if Moses was in the humanistic realm he said no I'm a wanted man in Egypt I'm not going there but Moses now fa is he walked to Egypt Pharaoh's Court this one brought gold this country by brought linen this other country what Diamond ask where are you from what kingdom are you from he said the kingdom of the most high what what do you bring for pharaoh I bring a word Let My People Go Let My People Go night a word is coming to you let my people go Satan take your hands off to God GL hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God GL you may be seated what is Faith here we go faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God so tonight we are in God's Will T we are in faith preaching to you the gospel of the Kingdom so faith is something that's revealed to you but it's not yet but you believe it will be so watch this now before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created God thoughts become creation spoke by a word listen listen he presented to you as a thought that's when he presented to you as a thought his thought is revealed to you but it's still a thought until you speak it if you speak it remains thought God want you to speak so revelation God thoughts coming to you like we said before God told Moses for FES that was God taught coming to mes if he keep quiet Monday if on [Music] Tuesday mes to get courage was gods mes tonight we are backing the thoughts of God hallelujah so therefore true Fai Faith seven of faith is connected connect to the intelligence of God the mind of Christ God intent and purp purp what he wants done with the word here is a secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word So for 50 years 50 plus years the word have been preaching to you put to you to you but now the mind of Christ went to drop down to reveal what God wants done with his word Glory Give an example when Joshua Cross Jordan the first place God tell him to take was Jer Joshua never said the wall is so high the city is so protected as far as he's concerned Jero is given over to you so josua Shar sword when he is resting he Shar his sword all of a sudden he heard a rustle his sword are you for us are you against us the man said I am the captain I am the Unseen don't tell anyone that you have seen me just given me instructions walk around Jero around Jero glory god told the people when I to shout what they do they follow instructions so listen to this God would anoint the man of God a man of God to give instructions you have to question it if it comes from God obey will be blessed God glory to God don't fight the word fight the ministry obey what God [Applause] [Music] Said that Roman Centurion he came to Jesus reation he watched Jesus in operation and said Jesus I am a man who is under Authority and I say to one go and he goes just speak just speak the word and myv shall be to show you how convinced man was he reached the house what time was he he knew that that man was healed faith is it's a revelation it's a revelation Mary received the word from the angel she never go for pregnancy test she never go to see is she pregnant Mary she had no feelings she C Elizabeth elizabethe John 6 months Mary Elizabeth some good news angel angel me I have a son and his name is Jesus and when she said [Applause] Jesus in the womb was shouting Oh Glory to God oh glory to God be it done unto me according to Thy word so watch Malachi 4 message is God hidden thoughts [Music] the books and the tapes are Spirit spoken [Music] words are God thoughts that were sealed and now revealed but still have a supernatural [Music] element promises have to be made present tense to the Bride of Jesus Christ no faith is the promise of a super Church the promise of a super race the promise of adopted Sons the promise of the higher Ministry speaking the word the promise of a servant on the bride all these promises what does your fa here tonight we say amen amen and amen Amen brother when God told him to speak for the squirel there no vision he didn't see a vision the prophet keep seeing visions and operating with the realm of vision but this time no vision just speak no feeling no no none of that none of that none of that no vision just speak SC there and the scel appear his eyes this real you mean God Tau come upon my lips I speak it created a and the prophet prophesy that in this last Church men will speak the word and it will create [Applause] [Music] [Applause] itself says if that spirit is here the same spirit that say let there be light let there be no cancer let the blind eyes be open first is your thoughts first is God's thoughts when he reveal it to you it become yours watch this when Peter was at the gate called [Applause] beautiful and he recognized he had no money said silver and gold I don't have what I have I can give I cannot give you what I don't have I have the book I have your name I hold the power of your healing in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the man rose up and walk because Peter was part of the body the body that God could use was an agent of the Kingdom Peter was a man sent from God oh glory to God prise God you can express it the word by a mental conception but if it becomes a real Revelation you see it before it happens so this Faith this real revelation see it before it happen you not hoping so you know so did you get that you are not hoping so you know so watch this God spoke to Abraham real Revelation you have a son his name is Isaac Sarah didn't hear the voice Sarah didn't have a revelation you know what it is to be Abraham to come back to Sarah and say lady you going to have a baby Sarah will scratch her head I maybe she didn't cook for two days she has no Revelation but Abraham abrah see Isaac is Abraham see the baby AB Abraham buing a crib Abraham because he believed God now Faith is God did not tell Abraham it will take 25 years God did not tell the bride we'll be here 2024 we are here St not at the promise of God true unbel Abraham had to believe for himself his wife before it happens you see it and then you express it in word form and the word takes a hold and becomes material in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word here we go was invisible until it became flesh then the word become visible so all these message popes and message Bishop [Music] and who is the man of the hour all that foolishness cannot line up the word was invisible until the word became flesh then the invisible become visible watch this now Ober you have got to get the Living Word in you to have the Living God in you because the word here is God and it's made flesh in you made spirit and life in you listen when it goes into your flesh and your faith and becomes life then you are living example so this word have to come inside your flesh and your faith then it becomes life oh let's go almost done prophecy when God's people begin to gather back together there is Unity there is power and whenever God's people get together completely I believe the resurrection will take place them here we go there will be a rapturing time when the Holy Spirit begins to gather it up not the Raptor yet a raptor in time time the Holy Spirit begin to gather it up brother Bram and the church has come to justification stif Holy Spirit and now right into the Rapture in time to get the church ready what if this convention part of this time the a Rapture in time what our time is for to get the church ready some of these days in that rapturing time that lays ahead the bride will be proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ message of in this age of Brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness you have to display that you have to display that forgiveness you Cann [Applause] get you cannot get love without passing your brotherly kindness Jesus said it this way when you stand praying for if you have against let us say it this way when you are praying for love charity Dynamic there must be no here that to go out that goes out tonight that goes out now no no grudges it doesn't matter who do you it doesn't matter what he did to you forgive them drop it you're on your way to Glory all right let's go it's going to take more faith than ever that was in any age for this has to be rapturing the normal Pentecostal fa speaking in Tong that can't work the message to sit down and hear and Revelation and history take more is a wake up call this convention is a wake up call to the Bride of Jesus Christ if you don't come up to this step you will be heading for the tribulation you will be known as a tribulation saint but I didn't come in this message for 50 plus years no [Applause] tribulation if there is one going to be taken it will be me if you want to be left that's you but I'm going up in the first resurrection glory to God hallelujah hallelujah do you get it all the messages is is to prepare us to leave here not to stay here the Beast is coming a new Financial system is coming coming put another miss the name of that missile Satan one he have another one they call it Satan 2 he have it ready just waiting for the anointing to press the button oh glory to God hallelujah hallelu but the bride will be leaving [Applause] here brother Bram he say father your children will see you quickly Lord May great faith be built listen to this prayer talking about the building of [Music] Faith fa great Fai that will make the people ready for the great translation Grant tonight that they will break out into the realm of Faith beyond the senses and walk from this building and be made well I'm almost finish he said the disciples didn't have this perfect Faith because they had Christ walking with them so as long as Christ walking with them they could not for any problem Jesus Jesus the hungry Jesus somebody sick Jesus somebody blind Jesus but when the Holy Ghost came inside of them it wasn't Jesus outside was Jesus inside perfect perf perfect fa so when a man walk by faith by faith he's a new Creator in Christ you are now getting into bright material prach listen after all these years in the message you are sharing what the prophet said when a man lives by faith walks by Fai you are now getting material rapturing condition Oh Glory to God all right last page hallelujah hallelujah praying Hallelujah I pray father that they will realize it isn't trying to condemn what they had it's only trying to give them more Rapture in Grace for the hour will come when we will have to have Rapture power did you hear that we have rapturing Faith rapturing time and now have to have Rapture power listen to this the all will come when we going to have Rapture power when we will have to have Rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in a Twi of an eye listen to this Christ will be so real into their bodies that he can [Music] change God I close with this I believe the age has come now that the miraculous the phenomen the bapm of the spirit wonders this great of the spirit in the last days a prophecy in the last days there will be a great of spirit are you ready pray are you ready he said that's the thing that will bring Faith into the people that will
