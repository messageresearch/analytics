========================================
then that was sealed no that was the Jews 144,000 but before they are sealed there's a Gentile bride to be sealed you can't go in without being seal Oh hallelujah hallelujah we can't make it without bein sealed the Jews were blind that we can see they were blinded that we could be covered with the robe of God's grace [Applause] so before God go back to the Jews you have to fill it with the Gentiles and the fill is the Gentiles it has to be the finishing of the seventh seal [Applause] [Music]
