[26:22] them he was parted from them and carried
[26:24] up into heaven and they worshiped him

[26:35] bless his word you may be seated
[26:37] oh praise the name of the Lord thank you
[26:40] Lord Jesus
[26:41] tonight our title is the attitude that
[26:45] brings the results
[26:47] is the attitude that brings results and
[26:51] I have an inspiration in the atmosphere
[26:53] of juda perfection I want to encourage
[26:57] you tonight to stay in the word stay in
[27:04] the atmosphere of the word if in the
[27:08] wrong atmosphere you cannot get the
[27:10] results that you're looking for
[27:13] so we want to share some things we
[27:15] tonight that we feel upon our hearts
[27:16] that would help you and strengthen you
[27:18] and edify you and the Prophet was spoken
[27:21] about a message a personal experience
[27:23] with God 1954 and he was chained about
[27:26] Moses how Moses has been a bit had been
[27:29] a bit of failure for yet knowing that
[27:32] God is going to deliver the child of
[27:33] Israel by him yet trying to do it within
[27:36] himself 40 years before that become a
[27:40] failure had lost all the vision of
[27:43] victory and of the freedom of the people
[27:46] enslaved see when you lost a vision you
[27:49] just doesn't have the burden anymore to
[27:53] do what needs to be done because it got
[27:56] collie qualified job he called you to
[27:58] enlist you into his program his plan of
[28:01] redemption isn't that right and the
[28:03] promise I wonder sometimes if we the
[28:05] church knowing that God is promised to
[28:07] deliver the tears from its sin from its
[28:09] sickness and the makers of people are
[28:12] salty people that the earth will hunger
[28:14] and thirst after I wonder in our human
[28:17] efforts in our t ologies and so forth
[28:19] our great fine buildings and so forth as
[28:21] we try to present the people many years
[28:24] ago he found it has failed because we
[28:26] took it in ourselves to do so we took it
[28:29] upon ourselves to have new schools
[28:30] educate ministers we left off the real
[28:33] principle the real thing that God told
[28:35] us to receive was to let the Holy Spirit
[28:38] lead the church we have left that off
[28:41] you have lost our divine joy and the
[28:44] vision is done now so when that joy is
[28:47] there you can't wait to come to church
[28:48] you can't wait to be in service you
[28:50] can't wait to be in the presence of God
[28:52] because this is your source this is your
[28:54] inspiration this is where you're getting
[28:56] your drawing from isn't it right
[28:59] people are not looking for the coming
[29:00] the Lord yet atomic bombs hanging
[29:02] everywhere people have lost their vision
[29:04] of the Lord because I've said times that
[29:06] the Lord will come a certain time and
[29:08] I've done all these things how can we do
[29:10] those things without Holy Spirit Moses
[29:13] have been a bit of failure but out here
[29:15] we see the tension attracted to a
[29:17] burning bush
[29:18] isn't that right fire attracts the
[29:20] people now watch
[29:21] feet took a whole right quick when Moses
[29:24] turn aside to consider this building
[29:26] tree God spoke to him a fresh vision by
[29:30] an angel so when the division get dull
[29:33] something brought her to give you a
[29:34] fresh world a fresh anointing a fresh
[29:38] inspiration a fresh fire Amen that still
[29:42] you up again
[29:43] did the vision of God that God has put
[29:46] inside your soul that's what the church
[29:48] needs a night watch watch watch no watch
[29:51] fate take a whole right quick the old
[29:52] things pass away Moses no has a new
[29:55] vision he has a revelation he has an
[29:58] experience vision revelation and
[30:03] experience he had met God he had talked
[30:06] to God before that he had not met God he
[30:10] only read and known what his mother had
[30:12] told him by hearing what his mother told
[30:15] him by what the pastor said but now
[30:18] Moses had a personal experience so you
[30:22] read this record books and oh gosh and a
[30:23] prophet be all I send you Elijah
[30:25] they were you read it that's what you
[30:27] receive that's what you understand but
[30:29] no you have to get your personal
[30:31] experience with God not reading a book
[30:34] not listen to a tape but with the same
[30:37] pillar of fire or glory to God the Koran
[30:40] pillar fire come to activate the sons of
[30:43] God Oh glory to God could somebody say
[30:48] Amen that pillar of fire come to
[30:50] activate the sons of God so you should
[30:53] want to be caught activated
[30:55] oh not intellectually activated thought
[30:59] out that every Scripture is God breathed
[31:01] the breath of God is upon this world Oh
[31:04] hallelujah that's what the church needs
[31:08] tonight is stop studying so much
[31:10] theology and get down to the altar and
[31:13] pray until a pleasant experience billion
[31:17] down in a human hat and builds out all
[31:19] the dullness and gives a new vision or
[31:23] glory the global either fresh or to call
[31:26] every man adult every man repentant
[31:30] every man crying out why I said enjoy
[31:33] let the priests hold on to the horns of
[31:35] the altar let him cry for the wine and -
[31:38] oil and then court said enjoy - and I
[31:41] will restore to you the years that the
[31:44] locusts are deeton the Pamela man-eatin
[31:47] when after they cry out Oh glory to God
[31:51] he said what will ease the pre-meeting
[31:53] they say Lord send on the adoption Oh
[31:56] glory to God we are teaching for 40 plus
[31:59] years it's time for fire it's time for
[32:02] power or glory to God we have to create
[32:06] the atmosphere because the atmosphere is
[32:09] what you're gonna get the results
[32:12] [Applause]
[32:14] hallelujah glory the government may be
[32:18] seated
[32:19] praise God praise God amen fit in God
[32:24] it's a staggering to many people and we
[32:28] ought to be a more selves to confess we
[32:30] don't have faith in God first there's
[32:32] cowards who die ten thousand deaths
[32:34] while they're here on earth and here
[32:36] never dies his memory lingers on for
[32:39] heroic deeds and usually young people
[32:42] who are feet are people who have
[32:45] experienced experience brings faith or
[32:49] glory to God you hear what intellect
[32:52] experience brings fit so when Moses met
[32:55] that pella fire nobody could stop Moses
[32:58] to tell him I'm talking out of going
[33:01] back to Egypt and if you asked voters
[33:03] where you're going you said to take over
[33:06] or chlorine of God what he couldn't do
[33:09] in 40 years he was doing instantly
[33:12] because he met the pillar fire I'm gonna
[33:15] when I'm stood and prophesy he said God
[33:19] will do in one year what all theologians
[33:23] fail to do in 2,000 years
[33:26] you wait till that little remnant that
[33:30] clogs on the gift Appalachia wait till
[33:33] Dakota : god damn national shodam
[33:36] there'll be a power strike attached like
[33:39] I've never seen before

[33:43] coming
[33:44] Oh God these are not plain words every
[33:51] wooden succeed
[33:52] these are wait till m-72 miss are the
[33:55] devices that people could pick the one
[33:57] on hand the dear oh boy it will slice
[34:00] and cut it shut the heavens he'll do
[34:03] whatever they want to do we don't have
[34:10] to ask permission for God to deliver
[34:12] your family we left in your family go we
[34:15] send you our free tonight loose them and
[34:20] let them go
[34:21] Oh glory to God hallelujah but the
[34:32] preacher experience is your experience
[34:34] you have to get your own experience and
[34:36] in experience benefit when then go see
[34:39] enough profits is on us back to the
[34:41] faith of the fathers that we have go
[34:42] back to an experience that the father
[34:44] has had because they had an experience
[34:47] hallelujah and Jesus send them in the
[34:50] upper room the killing the promise of
[34:52] the Father and the Bible said they were
[34:54] in the upper room they were praising and
[34:57] blessing God continually what were they
[34:59] doing they were creating an atmosphere
[35:01] and it was staying in the atmosphere it
[35:05] all depends upon your attitude
[35:07] da cunha bring the results but we have
[35:09] to create an atmosphere the atmosphere
[35:11] is what makes a difference or the song

[35:16] know what to do you're 19 and building
[35:18] it's an atmosphere it takes over the
[35:21] Blues it remove your frustration it
[35:24] effects the bad day I had today it
[35:27] corrects all of that what this does it
[35:29] is the atmosphere the Aquajet the holy
