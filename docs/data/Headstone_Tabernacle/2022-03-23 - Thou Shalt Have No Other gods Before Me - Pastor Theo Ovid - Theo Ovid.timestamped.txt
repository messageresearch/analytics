[13:40] reading mark 7 1
[13:44] then came together unto him the pharisee
[13:47] and satan of the scribes which came from
[13:50] jerusalem and when they saw some of his
[13:51] disciples eat bread
[13:53] with defile that is the same with
[13:55] unwashing hands they found forth
[13:58] for the pharisees and all the jews
[14:00] except they wash their hands oft eat not
[14:03] holding the tradition
[14:05] of the elders
[14:06] and when they come from the market
[14:08] except they wash they eat not and many
[14:09] other things there be which they have
[14:11] received to hold as the washing of cups
[14:13] and pots and braising vessels and of
[14:15] tables
[14:16] then the pharisees and scribe ask him
[14:19] why walk not thy disciples according to
[14:22] the tradition of the elders but eat
[14:24] bread but unwashing hands
[14:26] he answered and said unto them well are
[14:28] they
[14:29] prophesied of you hypocrites
[14:31] how this is written these people honor
[14:33] it me
[14:35] with their lips
[14:37] but their heart
[14:38] is far from me
[14:40] how be it in vain do they worship me
[14:43] teaching for doctrines
[14:45] the commandments
[14:47] of men
[14:48] for laying aside the commandment of god
[14:51] he hold the tradition of men
[14:54] as the washing of pots and cups and many
[14:57] other such things that you do and he
[14:58] said unto them full well ye reject
[15:02] the commandment of god
[15:04] hear why that he may keep
[15:06] your own
[15:08] tradition
[15:09] exodus 20
[15:11] reading from verse 2
[15:16] i am the lord thy god
[15:19] which brought thee out of the land of
[15:21] egypt
[15:23] and out of the house of
[15:24] bondage thou shalt have no other gods
[15:27] before me
[15:29] thou shalt not make unto thee any
[15:31] grieving image or any likeness of
[15:34] anything that is in heaven above
[15:36] or that isn't it beneath or that is in
[15:38] the water under the earth
[15:41] thou shalt not bow down thyself to them
[15:44] nor serve them
[15:46] for i the lord thy god i'm a jealous god
[15:52] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[15:54] upon the children
[15:55] unto the third and fourth generation of
[15:58] them that hate me
[16:00] and showing mercy
[16:02] unto thousands of them that love me
[16:05] and keep my commandments
[16:07] thou shalt not take the name of the lord
[16:09] thy god in vain
[16:10] for the lord will not hold him guiltless
[16:12] that taketh his name
[16:14] in vain
[16:15] first kings chapter 11
[16:18] we want to read from verse 31
[16:20] to 37.
[16:22] then he said to jeroboam
[16:24] take the ten pieces of thus
[16:27] ten pieces for thus saith the lord
[16:30] the god of israel behold
[16:32] i will rend the kingdom out of the hand
[16:34] of solomon
[16:36] and will give ten tribes to thee
[16:39] but he shall have one tribe for my
[16:41] servants david seek
[16:44] and for jerusalem's sake
[16:46] the city which i have chosen out of all
[16:48] the tribes of israel because
[16:51] that they have forseeked me
[16:54] and have worshipped astareth the goddess
[16:56] of the siddhurians kemosh
[16:59] the god of the moabites milkon the god
[17:01] of the chain of ammon and have not
[17:04] walked in my weeds
[17:07] to do that which is right in my eyes and
[17:09] to keep my statutes
[17:11] and my judgments at the as the david his
[17:14] father
[17:15] how be it i will not take the whole
[17:17] kingdom out of his hand
[17:19] but i will make him prince all the days
[17:21] of his life for david my seven sake
[17:25] whom i choose
[17:26] because he kept my commandments and my
[17:29] statutes
[17:30] but i will take the kingdom out of his
[17:32] son's hand
[17:34] and will give it unto thee even ten
[17:36] tribes
[17:37] unto his son will i give one tribe that
[17:40] david my servant may have a light always
[17:43] before me in jerusalem the city which i
[17:45] have chosen me to put my name there
[17:48] and i will take thee and thou shall
[17:50] reign according to all that i so desired
[17:53] and shall be king over israel may god
[17:55] bless this word you may be seated
[17:57] o blessed be the name of the lord
[18:00] so tonight
[18:02] i i suspect it's going to be like a part
[18:04] bible study but we will see what the law
[18:06] will do in it
[18:09] the title i have tonight is
[18:11] from the scripture we read in exodus uh
[18:15] 20
[18:16] the title is thou shalt have no other
[18:18] gods before me
[18:20] that's the title though shall have no
[18:21] other gods before me
[18:23] okay let's go saint john four
[18:27] the woman of the world was renting our
[18:30] fathers worship in the mountain and he
[18:32] say that jerusalem is the place where
[18:34] men ought to worship
[18:36] jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[18:38] hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[18:40] this mountain nor yet at jerusalem
[18:43] worship the father
[18:44] ye worship you know not what but we know
[18:47] what we worship for salvation is of the
[18:49] jews
[18:50] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[18:53] true worshipers shall worship the father
[18:56] in spirit and in truth for the father
[18:59] secret such to worship him
[19:01] god is a spirit
[19:03] and they that worship him must worship
[19:05] him in spirit and in truth
[19:08] this is the god that said i am the lord
[19:11] beside him there is none else
[19:13] have no other gods before me
[19:15] all glory to god and lucifer wanted that
[19:19] worship that god deserves
[19:22] he wanted it now
[19:25] revelation 18 13 8 says and all that
[19:27] dwell upon the earth shall worship him
[19:29] whose names are not written in the book
[19:30] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[19:32] foundation of the world so this whole
[19:35] beast system is connected with worship
[19:37] that's the objective in all all the
[19:40] powers and all the weapons and what that
[19:42] is connected to worship
[19:45] oh hallelujah it went on further he had
[19:47] power to give life unto the image of the
[19:49] beast that the image of the beast should
[19:51] both speak and cause that as many as
[19:54] would not worship the image of the beast
[19:56] should be killed
[19:57] and he calls it all
[19:59] both small and great rich and poor free
[20:01] and bond to receive the mark in their
[20:03] right hand or in their foreheads that no
[20:06] man might buy or sell see if he'd have
[20:08] the mark or the name of the beast or the
[20:11] number of his name
[20:13] so the b system itself is connected to
[20:16] worship
[20:17] that is why they're going to have the
[20:18] mark that is why they're going to kill
[20:20] and the prophet said in the dark ages
[20:22] there or forget the pope what was who
[20:25] legalized murder that is okay to kill
[20:27] people that don't believe what you
[20:29] believe
[20:30] hallelujah and they was getting
[20:32] authorization from the church and that
[20:34] same thing going to happen again
[20:36] slaughter them
[20:37] kill them in the name of god oh blessed
[20:40] be the name of the lord do you believe
[20:41] that tonight
[20:43] under the angel of the church of tight i
[20:45] write these things said the son of god
[20:47] who had his eyes like flame of fire his
[20:49] feet as a fine brass this is the same
[20:51] jesus coming forth in judgment eyes of
[20:54] fire flames like a brass isn't that
[20:57] right listen to this
[20:59] i have been he said i have been bringing
[21:02] to your attention all along
[21:04] that i will kill a children with death
[21:06] and all the churches shall know i am he
[21:10] which searched the rings and the hearts
[21:13] i have been saying right along there are
[21:15] actually two churches
[21:18] though the spirit speaks to both of them
[21:20] in each age
[21:22] as though they are a one
[21:24] here it is plainly stated that they are
[21:27] churches
[21:28] and it states just plainly that some of
[21:31] those churches most evidently do not
[21:33] know that he is the one
[21:35] that suited the reigns and the hearts
[21:39] he is going to prove to them that it is
[21:41] so
[21:42] now then what churches will be those
[21:45] that do not know this truth of course it
[21:47] is the fourth vine group because the
[21:49] true believers certainly know that
[21:52] judgment begins at the house of god
[21:54] and there being god-fearing judge
[21:56] themselves that they may not be judged
[22:00] so when you are true believer you can
[22:01] look into the mirror of the word and
[22:03] judge yourself
[22:04] oh glory to god because judgment begins
[22:06] where in the house of god now why does
[22:09] god call these churches his churches
[22:11] even though they are the false vine
[22:14] the truth of the matter is that they are
[22:16] christians
[22:17] and they are not christians of the
[22:19] spirit
[22:20] they are christians of the flesh
[22:23] they bear the name in vain and he quotes
[22:26] mark 7.
[22:28] how be it in vain do they worship me
[22:31] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[22:33] of men so now we find out tonight they
[22:35] are christians of the flesh
[22:37] and they are christians of the spirit
[22:39] and god recognizes both
[22:41] he addresses both the word goes out
[22:43] about and both of them will respond to
[22:45] the word a certain way
[22:47] oh glory to god do you believe that
[22:50] now he said watch in the same way
[22:52] a christian is a christian as long as he
[22:54] subscribes to the fact that jesus is the
[22:56] son of god born of the virgin crucified
[22:59] and died and rose again etc and that is
[23:01] how god sees them now why do we say this
[23:04] because as we pointed out in the study
[23:06] of the fourth age that was jezebel was a
[23:09] sidonian the daughter of ethbal
[23:12] who was the king priest astati he was a
[23:15] murderer this woman married ahab king of
[23:17] israel for political expediency she then
[23:20] took over the religion of the people
[23:22] murdered the levites erected temples
[23:25] wherein he she caused the people to
[23:27] worship astati venus bial sun god she
[23:31] formulated the teaching
[23:33] made a priest teach it and then in turn
[23:36] made the people accept it
[23:38] there you can see exactly what the
[23:40] nominal church was in the dark ages they
[23:43] left the word of god entirely except for
[23:46] names and titles of godhead a few
[23:48] scriptural principles they twisted what
[23:51] they did take out the bible by changing
[23:53] its meaning
[23:55] the college of bishops wrote vast
[23:57] treaties their popes declared themselves
[23:59] to be infallible and they received
[24:01] revelation from god and spoke as god to
[24:05] the people all this was taught to the
[24:07] priests who true fear made the people
[24:09] believe it
[24:11] the dissent was debt or excommunication
[24:14] which might be worse than that it was
[24:16] now the church with the assured voice
[24:18] that took over
[24:20] and while with power
[24:22] they drank the blood of the matters
[24:25] until the true christians were all but
[24:27] exterminated but there was hardly any
[24:30] word left
[24:31] and little manifestation of the holy
[24:33] ghost but the true vine struggled and
[24:36] survived
[24:38] the divine watch struggled
[24:40] and survived
[24:42] god was faithful to little flock in
[24:45] spite of what rome might do to their
[24:47] bodies rome could not kill the spirit
[24:49] within them and the light of the truth
[24:52] shone on backed by the holy ghost and
[24:54] power
[24:55] this is a good place to make an
[24:57] illuminating observation look
[24:59] the deeds and doctrines of the
[25:01] nicolaitans the doctrine of balaam and
[25:03] the teaching of the false prophetess
[25:05] jezebel do not constitute three spirits
[25:09] or make three spiritual principles
[25:11] these three are about the various
[25:14] manifestation of the same spirit as it
[25:17] go from depth to depth
[25:19] what it is all is the antichrist spirit
[25:22] of organization in three stages
[25:25] once here we go the clergy is separated
[25:28] themselves
[25:30] which is the ministers
[25:32] and organized themselves
[25:34] they oppressed the people
[25:37] by leading them into
[25:39] and binding them to organization also
[25:42] this organization was based upon creeds
[25:46] and dogmas which they taught instead of
[25:49] the pure word of god
[25:51] oh so you have pure word yes what is
[25:55] pure word thus saith the lord what is
[25:57] pure word what comes out the prophet's
[25:59] mouth because man shall never bread
[26:01] alone but by every word that proceed out
[26:04] of the mouth of god so every word that
[26:06] comes at the mouth of the prophets are
[26:07] pure with
[26:09] it's thus saith the lord there is no
[26:11] variable
[26:12] necessary with it there is no change in
[26:15] it it's god speaking to the mouth of
[26:16] these men isn't that right
[26:19] so watch this ritual and ceremony was
[26:22] given an increase in pattern worship and
[26:24] so this whole system was a militant and
[26:27] diabolical power that did its best to
[26:30] control all to the persuasion of
[26:32] discourse or literal force
[26:36] it received its energy from its own
[26:38] false prophecies
[26:42] the false prophecies anointed them
[26:45] so they could believe a lie
[26:47] oh hallelujah not the word of god it was
[26:50] up it was no absolutely antichrist
[26:53] though it came
[26:54] in christ's name
[26:56] what is it
[26:57] idolatry
[27:00] idolatry what is idolatry
[27:02] and the definition of having a
[27:04] dictionary the worship of a physical
[27:07] object as a god
[27:10] that's one
[27:11] to
[27:12] a moderate attachment or devotion to
[27:15] something
[27:17] extreme admiration love or reverence for
[27:20] something or someone
[27:23] so when we first hear about idols
[27:26] the impression we get is some physical
[27:27] statute that's external things
[27:30] a statue or some created image that god
[27:33] said or make is something external that
[27:35] could be identified as an idol but what
[27:38] about the internal ones
[27:40] the internal images
[27:42] the internal statutes
[27:44] because this bees have an image
[27:46] that will get a life because idols and
[27:49] whatnot is all that is forms of worship
[27:52] because they call it a god
[27:53] and all the god won't worship
[27:56] all the gods need worship oh blessed be
[27:58] the name of the lord so watch this
[28:01] brother brown
[28:02] as you can see by reading of the
[28:03] scripture where i am placing my thought
[28:05] this morning upon idolatry
[28:08] first to begin with there's little wrote
[28:10] about idolatry there's not many books to
[28:12] explain idolatry what is idolatry and
[28:15] yet the world is full of it
[28:17] i think the reason of it is because it
[28:20] has never really been explained to
[28:22] people
[28:24] not knowing what it would be
[28:25] and it's been my privilege and my great
[28:27] privilege in my life in traveling to see
[28:29] some idolatry to know what it is
[28:32] then in studying idolatry the last few
[28:34] weeks mythology greek mythology roman
[28:36] mythology it brings me back to see
[28:39] whether they still keep the same thing
[28:41] alive
[28:42] to see whether if idolatry remains as it
[28:45] was in the beginning today in travel
[28:47] seeing idolatry and then seeing the way
[28:49] it began
[28:50] reading how it began back in the early
[28:52] days i see that it hasn't changed
[28:55] oh hallelujah
[28:57] because anything that please come
[28:59] between you and your god is an eye dog
[29:05] anything
[29:06] be it wife husband money house family
[29:11] job whatever it is
[29:13] once it come because see what it does it
[29:16] it competes with attention from your
[29:18] heart
[29:20] that's supposed to be going towards god
[29:22] oh glory to god because he that what
[29:25] and the father secret who to worship him
[29:28] worshiping and what in spirit and in
[29:29] truth and the only way you can worship
[29:32] and truth you have to get the idols out
[29:33] of your heart
[29:34] oh give the lord some praises people
[29:37] let's continue here notice air married
[29:40] jezebel junior time of the great dark
[29:41] age of israel
[29:43] he brought idolatry into israel a very
[29:45] type of today just in the dark age when
[29:47] we come out to the early apostles he
[29:49] says fifteen hundred years as he had
[29:52] married jezebel and brought idolatry
[29:53] into israel so did the holy ghost church
[29:56] marry into isms
[29:58] and brought idolatry back
[30:00] and today
[30:02] it's a form well when i read this this
[30:04] blew my mind it's a form of christianity
[30:07] just very dark
[30:09] so this idolatry is a dark form of
[30:14] christianity
[30:15] hallelujah but i hope god help us this
[30:17] evening i don't know how things will
[30:19] unfold the way i'm seeing it and it's
[30:21] it's scary
[30:23] let's continue
[30:24] to the great climax to the lukewarm
[30:26] church comes like lukewarm laurisia what
[30:29] a horrible age we are living in
[30:30] just as israel come in its beauty back
[30:33] in the beginning of abraham come down to
[30:35] the patriarchs and in the day of ahab it
[30:37] went into the dark ages the darkest age
[30:40] of church scene went out there and at a
[30:42] time of year married jezebel brought
[30:44] idolatry into the orthodox church the
[30:46] same thing protestantism married
[30:49] romanism in the fifteen hundred years of
[30:51] the actions in the pergamos church and
[30:53] they come up with idolatry under the
[30:55] form of christianity going out into the
[30:58] lukewarm age coming before us
[31:00] so idolatry bring on that lukewarm
[31:02] because idolatry take away your love and
[31:05] worship to the true unliving god and
[31:08] give it to other gods
[31:09] small god
[31:11] oh praise the name of the lord
[31:13] hallelujah praise god you you yourself
[31:16] could be an idol you could actually be a
[31:18] lover of your own self oh glory to god
[31:20] you yourself become an idol you become a
[31:23] god in your own eyes a god in your own
[31:25] thinking according your own approach oh
[31:28] blessed be the name of the lord knowing
[31:30] that church is they became coming they
[31:32] went into idolatry and watched and he
[31:34] said we are fading away until we get
[31:36] down to the last age now the modern
[31:38] church which we call denomination
[31:41] holiness people we call them the modern
[31:43] he said they're not getting anywhere now
[31:45] wait a minute what have we got we got
[31:47] nothing no more than they got that's
[31:49] exactly right as long as we fuss and
[31:52] skew and carry on among one another we
[31:54] still work as men
[31:56] until a man
[31:58] can get down at the altar and get right
[32:01] with god till he can overlook little
[32:03] things
[32:04] and move on like a christian or two
[32:06] until he can overlook what little things
[32:09] little things binding you and turn you
[32:10] up you have to overlook that overlook
[32:12] your better fault overlook your
[32:13] brother's failure overlook this one
[32:15] mistake and what happened forget it the
[32:17] grace of god is for all of us the blood
[32:19] is for all of us
[32:20] and all of us have to deal with the b
[32:22] system that is already on its way
[32:25] oh give the lord some praises glory to
[32:27] god until a man can get right down at
[32:29] the altar and get right with god till he
[32:32] can overlook little things and move on
[32:34] like a christian author but can't get
[32:36] called kettle black don't holla at them
[32:38] let's clean our own step first and i say
[32:41] the same thing don't bother but nobody
[32:43] else mind your own business let's clean
[32:45] our own step first oh give the lord some
[32:48] praises
[32:49] glory to god hallelujah praise god so
[32:52] this whole idolatry thing started off
[32:54] with nimrod the son of ham to idolatry
[32:57] to bring idols to worship idols now

[33:27] idolatry spirit he said i am the lord

[38:03] he searched the reins of the heart
[38:05] what is your intent

[39:47] glory to god he said when we go get the
[39:49] descriptions when he gets in that land

[39:52] daughter's married and people you know
[39:54] because he will lead them astray from

[39:59] from god
[40:00] oh glory to god i call it to be a
[40:02] peculiar people his object is to bring
[40:05] you to him
[40:06] and the devil object is to take you away
[40:08] from him

[40:11] him is the next idol
[40:12] oh glory to god i am the lord thy god
[40:16] have no other gods before me
[40:20] mine
[40:24] here was a borderline believer
[40:27] just a fellow that believed enough to
[40:28] make him miserable did you ever see
[40:30] people like that
[40:32] they have a conception that they should
[40:33] like to go to church and do right they
[40:36] feel like it will make them better
[40:37] social persons who share lives and maybe
[40:39] for the sake of their children they
[40:41] think they ought to maybe belong to a
[40:43] church
[40:44] if that isn't the most miserable person
[40:47] i know of
[40:48] i tell you it's better cut loose all the
[40:50] lines and launch into the deep or don't
[40:53] at all go just simply stay home either
[40:55] you go all over christ god wants
[40:57] somebody who is really want to go all
[40:59] the way give your soul your body your
[41:03] spirit to the service of the lord and
[41:06] this borderline believer as i call him a
[41:08] few moments ago he kindly had a mental
[41:10] conception of his theology he thought
[41:12] well there's god but maybe big lamb is
[41:14] god too like people are saying you know
[41:16] jesus is the way but he's not the only
[41:18] we here i mean he must have other ways
[41:20] that's only logical
[41:22] donkey logic is very logical but god do
[41:24] you say i am the way not a way he didn't
[41:27] say a wee
[41:28] so any any any any smoothie style some
[41:31] style balling he's one of the ways they
[41:33] are liars a satan talking through them
[41:35] he said i am the way and he means that
[41:37] hallelujah i am the way i am the truth i
[41:41] am the door i am the life and we have to
[41:44] believe it that way and when you believe
[41:46] that way you get the power of the
[41:47] revelation of what he said that he is oh
[41:49] glory to god i am that i am whatever you
[41:52] need me tonight to be that is what i am
[41:54] i could be your deliverer tonight your
[41:56] baptizer tonight your healer tonight
[41:58] whatever you need me that is what i am
[42:00] to you tonight how do you want me to be
[42:02] tonight oh give the lord some praises oh
[42:05] glory to god
[42:06] hallelujah praise god you say you know
[42:09] boys i'm telling you tonight you young
[42:10] ladies be careful who you marry you'll
[42:13] have a broken home the first thing you
[42:14] know is it's not good for sinners and
[42:16] christians to marry together don't be
[42:18] unequally yoked cause that's what ahab
[42:20] she was pretty little paint over her
[42:22] face i like a lizard
[42:24] but he marries shay
[42:26] no watch the most wicked person there is
[42:29] a man or woman that professes
[42:30] christianity just got enough to make
[42:32] them sick to make them say i'd like to
[42:34] do that but my religion won't let me do
[42:36] it
[42:37] the most miserables i think of
[42:40] he said but ahab had knuckled down to
[42:42] this idolater wife brought all israel
[42:44] into idolatry you say then brother
[42:46] branham you compared it today to our
[42:48] nation yes
[42:49] our nation is greatly covered over with
[42:52] either the tree we might not lose
[42:54] dealing with it and get known
[42:56] he said we might not worship wooden
[42:57] animals and so forth
[42:59] as we want to think of idolatry but
[43:01] that's not all idolatry consists of
[43:04] we sometimes make our automobiles
[43:08] so long he's drilling down now our
[43:10] clothes
[43:11] and the things that we do we put as
[43:13] idols
[43:14] then he said this anything between you
[43:17] and god is an idol
[43:20] if you put the church between you and
[43:21] god that's an idol
[43:23] if you put a pass in it that's an idol
[43:32] if you worship the cherubim i don't do
[43:36] this there are films
[43:41] if you say gonna worship you 24 elders
[43:43] like the idol too
[43:45] it's worship but who are worshiping
[43:46] they're not god
[43:51] anything between human god is an idol
[43:54] sometimes we make our churches idols
[43:59] so i i didn't say that the prophet said
[44:01] that
[44:02] sometimes they make the churches the
[44:03] idol they may start in the living god
[44:04] you know they started in the church so
[44:06] that's why the pharisees and sadducees
[44:08] had the people in a bang and jesus was
[44:10] rocking the whole system because he was
[44:12] not dealing with the tradition of the
[44:14] elders because for them to get the
[44:15] traditions they have to leave the word
[44:17] that they forsake the commandment to get
[44:19] to do their own thing you cannot believe
[44:21] the devil's lie unless you reject god's
[44:23] truth
[44:25] oh give the lord some praises people let
[44:26] me say that again you cannot receive the
[44:29] devil's lie until you reject god's truth
[44:33] oh glory to god when you reject god to
[44:35] then they could take the devil's life
[44:36] but tonight give him back
[44:38] glory lord god says satan you are liar
[44:41] every time you open your mouth
[44:42] i believe what god said
[44:44] i will have no other gods before
[44:47] between him and me
[44:48] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[44:51] hallelujah
[44:52] deuteronomy 7
[44:54] verse 1
[44:56] when this is god speaking when the lord
[44:57] thy god
[44:59] shall bring thee into the land whether
[45:00] thou goes to possess it
[45:02] and has cast out many nations before
[45:04] thee the hittites the glitchites the
[45:07] amorites the canaanites the parasites
[45:09] the hivites the jebusites seven nations
[45:11] greater and mighty than thou
[45:13] and when the lord thy god shall deliver
[45:15] them before thee thou shalt smite them
[45:19] utterly destroy them
[45:21] thou shalt make no covenant with them
[45:24] nor show mercy unto them neither shall
[45:27] thou make marriages with them
[45:29] thy daughter thou shalt not give unto
[45:31] his son nor his daughter shalt thou take
[45:34] unto thy son for they will turn away thy
[45:36] son from following me
[45:39] you know who he is
[45:40] he said i am a jealous god he said don't
[45:43] do that
[45:48] from following me
[45:50] that they may serve other gods
[45:52] so will the anger of the lord be killed
[45:54] against you and destroy this suddenly
[45:56] but thus shall you deal with them you

[49:07] you cannot serve god and maman
[49:10] the amplified says no one can save two
[49:12] masters for either he will hate the one
[49:14] and love the other he will stand by and
[49:16] be devoted to one and despise and be
[49:18] against the other you cannot save god
[49:20] and mama deceitful
[49:23] riches
[49:24] money
[49:25] possessions or whatever is trusted in
[49:28] oh my gosh
[49:30] the bible talked about a married woman
[49:32] can't get remarried until she was
[49:34] husband died
[49:36] isn't that right and he was talking
[49:37] about this the bible really said here
[49:39] her first husband must be dead
[49:41] not just put away not just divorced
[49:45] but dead
[49:47] and he was bringing a point here
[49:48] he said now to be married to the second
[49:50] adam christ the word
[49:52] you must
[49:53] separate yourself by death
[49:55] from your first denominational husband
[49:58] because there isn't one of them that can
[50:00] take all the word just show me where
[50:01] that is
[50:02] so he's making a point you can't be
[50:04] married to christ and had the old
[50:05] husband
[50:07] you might have two men you know your
[50:08] loved one
[50:09] that can't want her to die the old man
[50:14] are not hearing you
[50:16] the old man after die

[50:20] sentenced to death to be married to
[50:22] christ the word all glory to god is that
[50:25] right hallelujah
[50:27] praise be to jesus
[50:30] he said now watch as long as you hold
[50:32] the tradition of denominations you are
[50:34] called in the godswood and adulteress

[50:40] seeker
[50:40] belonging to a national church that
[50:42] denies the word you're an adulteress

[50:46] save two gods at the same time you ever
[50:49] serve mama in the world he that loves
[50:51] the world or things of the world the
[50:52] love of god not even him
[50:54] so this is what the devil gave offer and
[50:56] the offer is attractive

[51:00] offer that make distasteful he give him

[51:04] wheel you in and pull it in that's what
[51:05] he does that is what make it attractive

[55:07] oh my
[55:08] praise god judges 10
[55:10] reading from verse 6. tell your partner
[55:12] bible study so we just read
[55:14] churches 10 university and the children
[55:16] of israel did evil again
[55:18] in the sight of the lord saved balaam
[55:21] ashta's watch the gods of syria the gods
[55:23] of zidon the gods of moab the gods of
[55:25] the children of ammon the gods of the
[55:27] philistines and forsook the lord
[55:29] and save not him
[55:31] so they're going off key and off track
[55:34] that was a you know backside right away
[55:35] in church another for a long boom
[55:37] and they and they caught from collecting
[55:39] outside you know just die slowly
[55:42] when somebody dropped the church they
[55:44] died in a long time
[55:46] when you miss them if they call the
[55:47] funeral box take them off stone dead
[55:50] and the question is how many more must
[55:52] die
[55:53] why are people dying
[55:56] see
[55:56] he said because iniquity will bond
[55:59] the love of many
[56:01] with back school
[56:03] iniquity is knowing to do right and not
[56:05] doing it
[56:06] so god gave us a chance to get cleansed
[56:08] and cleaned up
[56:09] that we could have a
[56:11] heart to god that we could correctly
[56:13] worship god
[56:14] he said the father seeketh such it have
[56:16] a search to worship him not just worship
[56:18] because of those who in vain do they
[56:20] worship me
[56:21] so it's not vain worship you don't want
[56:23] the ways to worship you want the father
[56:25] the worship that what the father seeking
[56:27] he seeketh such to worship him in spirit
[56:29] and in truth not in spirit and in error
[56:31] in spirit and in truth and to get the
[56:33] truth now it has to be revealed has to
[56:35] be unfolding so gosh and our messenger
[56:36] in his last day william marion branham
[56:38] to bring the truth
[56:39] with the promise that the spirit will
[56:40] come
[56:41] oh glory to god that he could
[56:43] effectively worship
[56:44] because this will be our worship back
[56:46] later that's why the beast system being
[56:48] going to be a force because they want
[56:50] worship they can still want that and he
[56:52] even belong here he can be boots and get
[56:54] kicked out of heaven and land on the
[56:55] earth this is our earth here that's what
[56:57] we have to reign on the earth this is
[56:59] not it and hostile he got kicked out and
[57:02] fell on the earth oh glory to god and
[57:04] interfere in the garden of eden but we
[57:06] can get back to eden and he get more
[57:07] boots to get he have like a fire they go
[57:09] to or give the lord a praise offering
[57:11] glory to god either he ever know no
[57:14] man's land hell will he have no fixed
[57:16] place of abode that's why he asked that
[57:18] wherever he's at to and fro all over the
[57:20] earth he have no fixed place of abode
[57:22] looking to do mischief but god say
[57:25] heaven is my throne that is my footstool
[57:28] what hoax will you build me but a body
[57:30] has thought prepared and god is
[57:32] repairing a bright body that he can step
[57:35] into it
[57:36] oh glory to god then you will see true
[57:38] worship king lamb worship
[57:40] or give the lord a shout to the house
[57:42] before we leave here we're gonna have
[57:45] genuine kingdom worship or glory not
[57:47] with your mouth only but with your heart
[57:49] also
[57:51] oh glory to god amen
[57:53] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[57:56] hallelujah praise god and but isaac

[58:00] of the bible they serve the lord and the
[58:02] backs and then they go on anything in
[58:03] bondage they repent and they come back
[58:05] and that's recycled over and over
[58:07] their cycle hour cycle
[58:09] and the anger of the lord was hot
[58:11] against israel
[58:12] and he sold them into the hands of the
[58:14] philistines
[58:16] into the hands of the children of ammon
[58:18] and that year
[58:20] they vexed and oppressed the children of
[58:22] israel 18 years
[58:26] no there's not
[58:28] did you ever people you know
[58:29] these gosh people you know do you hear
[58:31] how long there was an oppression 18
[58:33] years
[58:38] can i continue
[58:40] all the children of the other of israel
[58:42] that were on the other side of jordan in
[58:43] the land of the amorites which is gilead
[58:45] moreover the church of amman passover
[58:47] jordan to fight also against judah and
[58:50] against benjamin and against the house
[58:51] of ephraim so israel was so distressed
[58:54] and the children of israel cried unto
[58:57] the lord saying we have sinned against
[59:00] thee
[59:01] both because we are forsaken our god
[59:04] and also balaam and the lord senator of
[59:07] israel did not i deliver you from the
[59:09] egyptians
[59:10] and from the amorites from the children
[59:12] of ammon and from the philistines the
[59:14] zodians also the amalekites the meonites
[59:18] did oppress you and you cried to me and
[59:20] i delivered you out of the hand
[59:22] ye yet you have forsaken me
[59:24] and save other gods
[59:26] wherefore i will deliver you no more
[59:33] you know what the next line says
[59:35] god say go
[59:36] and cry unto the gods which you have
[59:38] chosen
[59:40] let them deliver you
[59:41] in the time of your tribulation
[59:45] you know what you want to save that let
[59:47] them deliver you
[59:48] don't come to me
[59:50] i wonder if this time coming around now
[59:52] because i will not deliver you i'll
[59:54] leave you up with your god you want you
[59:55] want yourself the god of your
[59:57] imagination the god in your own heart
[59:59] what you think he is what you feel he is
[1:00:02] what you feel he is not
[1:00:05] go and cry unto the gods which you have
[1:00:07] chosen let them deliver you in a time of
[1:00:09] tribulation
[1:00:10] and the church of israel i said unto the
[1:00:11] lord we have sinned
[1:00:13] do don't want us whatever seem good unto
[1:00:15] thee but deliver us only we pray thee
[1:00:17] this day
[1:00:19] and they put away the strange gosham
[1:00:20] among them and save the lord and his
[1:00:22] soul was on
[1:00:26] give the lord some praises people
[1:00:28] this is the word of the lord
[1:00:31] psalm 16 4
[1:00:32] their sorrows shall be multiplied
[1:00:35] that he stood after other another god
[1:00:39] sorrows
[1:00:40] this looks nice that you start
[1:00:43] but you get a multiplication of sorrow
[1:00:45] by seeking after other gods
[1:00:47] you put money as your goal or business
[1:00:49] as you go to put anything in front of
[1:00:50] god god may let the business crash get
[1:00:52] the supplement that happened that
[1:00:53] happened to make sure you get it right
[1:00:56] don't
[1:00:57] forget
[1:00:58] the god that brought you out of egypt he
[1:01:01] told them didn't i bring you out i
[1:01:03] deliver you from this i bring you from
[1:01:05] this i break i look what you're treating
[1:01:06] me
[1:01:08] you already said he's a jealous god
[1:01:10] oh glory to god so we have to if we have
[1:01:12] to get it back right we have to come
[1:01:14] back to be becoming faithful
[1:01:18] because idolatry is really being
[1:01:20] unfaithful to god
[1:01:25] so it has to come back to our kind of
[1:01:27] faithfulness
[1:01:28] i want to be faithful in love faithful
[1:01:32] in obedience faithful to his word
[1:01:35] faithful to do what his word said to do
[1:01:39] put aside your feelings because your
[1:01:41] feelings could become a god and you're
[1:01:43] saving your feelings instead of the word
[1:01:45] you go in by your flesh instead of the
[1:01:47] spirit word
[1:01:48] oh glory to god you have to leave your
[1:01:50] feelings sometime you know you're
[1:01:52] feeling will lead you astray you know
[1:01:53] you have to bind that feeling and bring
[1:01:55] your flesh and subjection to the word
[1:01:57] you know
[1:01:58] oh glory to god you can't go by how you
[1:02:00] feel or what you think you have to go by
[1:02:02] what god said
[1:02:08] just before the coming of the lord jesus
[1:02:10] he sent the holy ghost to the church in
[1:02:13] this last day and the holy ghost has
[1:02:15] been a witness of his resurrection and
[1:02:17] prove that he lives and he's coming and
[1:02:19] the church gets himself ready and as we
[1:02:21] see the church making himself ready
[1:02:22] abstaining from fornications listen
[1:02:26] his wife had based already right listen
[1:02:28] to her i'm drilling on it now abstaining
[1:02:31] from fornication abstaining from
[1:02:33] idolatry abstaining from lust
[1:02:35] deficiencies and all the works of the
[1:02:36] flesh we the church and the people see
[1:02:39] the little congregation getting together
[1:02:42] stopping their drinking stopping their
[1:02:44] lying stopping their tackling stop
[1:02:46] everything that's of the flesh making
[1:02:48] themselves ready
[1:02:49] so you expect god to pull up with a
[1:02:51] pants and you'll put socks and shoes and
[1:02:53] jess here and then your ball you'll make
[1:02:55] yourself ready he said but his wife had
[1:02:56] made us already oh glory to god there's
[1:02:58] must be something for you to do
[1:03:00] this unchanging god-giver unchanging
[1:03:02] word and leave it here to see what we
[1:03:04] will do with his very word or give the
[1:03:06] lord our praise that's why he took the
[1:03:08] prophet off he have confidence that
[1:03:10] we're gonna make it you have confidence
[1:03:12] we will come to our senses like that
[1:03:14] prodigal son did he came to his senses
[1:03:16] he had enough big food
[1:03:21] ketchup and the pepper wasn't making it
[1:03:23] better it was still pig food
[1:03:30] making themselves ready
[1:03:32] screaming to the top of their voices and
[1:03:35] clapping their hands and shouting the
[1:03:36] victory
[1:03:37] that's the bride you know
[1:03:39] so if you're not screaming and shouting
[1:03:41] and praising god you have some works to
[1:03:42] do there's some ideas to get rid of
[1:03:44] there are some behaviors and some
[1:03:46] attitudes and some stuff that have to
[1:03:48] get burned out break down the altars
[1:03:50] praise be to jesus
[1:03:52] hallelujah hallelujah but the indians
[1:03:55] out in southwest they used to worship
[1:03:56] idols they had what they called the rain
[1:03:58] god it was a matata
[1:04:00] the node he lived down in the rain and
[1:04:02] tung in the earth and they believed that
[1:04:03] god of the rain comes down into the mud
[1:04:05] turtle
[1:04:06] in old pagan rome they used to have
[1:04:08] jupiter and many of other gods they
[1:04:10] would come they will say that those gods
[1:04:12] live
[1:04:13] and when you study mythology and so
[1:04:15] forth he said now how did they did it
[1:04:17] they had a big altar this statue stood
[1:04:19] upon it the worshipper coming he paid
[1:04:21] the priest for a candle
[1:04:23] and they went down to the temple
[1:04:25] sometimes there were several gods he sat
[1:04:27] in the altar and the god would find his
[1:04:29] way to his right image
[1:04:32] and they set it down and lit this candle
[1:04:34] then the worshiper the priest got some
[1:04:36] fruit ready made a sacrifice brought
[1:04:38] wine and he actually had communion with
[1:04:41] the idol
[1:04:44] and then he prostrated himself before
[1:04:45] the idol he laid there in such a stupor
[1:04:48] until the imaginary god that looked like
[1:04:50] the image that he had built come got
[1:04:52] into the idol and talked back to him
[1:04:54] through the idol
[1:04:56] so this image
[1:04:58] this idol
[1:04:59] speaks back to the worshipper
[1:05:02] but there's another image
[1:05:07] oh glory to god faith virtue knowledge
[1:05:10] temperance patience godliness probably
[1:05:13] kindness oh glory to god the image of
[1:05:16] jesus christ and you prostrate and
[1:05:18] borrow me for that and that that could
[1:05:19] speak to
[1:05:20] glory they've got the beast maker image
[1:05:23] and life had to come into that image
[1:05:24] that that image could speak but god of
[1:05:26] an image are going to be in the bride
[1:05:28] and that image will speak
[1:05:30] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:05:32] the imaginary god the thought through an
[1:05:35] idol that he was able to hypnotize this
[1:05:37] god with his offering his burning candle
[1:05:39] into this god and then his soul got
[1:05:41] entangled with that you see it's the
[1:05:43] devil
[1:05:45] and he would think that god spoke back
[1:05:47] to his conscience through there and it
[1:05:49] was actually a god to him now
[1:05:52] how the prophet brought that type and he
[1:05:53] switched it over and out to the positive
[1:05:55] now god was going to show
[1:05:58] what a real god was
[1:06:00] and on the day of pentecost they
[1:06:02] prostrated themselves for 10 days
[1:06:04] another imaginary became a song from
[1:06:07] heaven like a russian mighty wind and it
[1:06:10] filled all the house with a living and
[1:06:12] god never took an idol he took a living
[1:06:14] man
[1:06:15] and placed himself by the baptism of the
[1:06:17] holy ghost into this man not imaginary
[1:06:21] god not imaginary thing but a reality of
[1:06:25] the real god in a real man and when this
[1:06:28] man rose up he worked the works of god
[1:06:31] oh glory to god oh glory to god give the
[1:06:34] lord a shout tonight strange that he did
[1:06:37] that strange that he didn't take some
[1:06:39] smart men that knowed something about
[1:06:41] that they tried to figure it out but he
[1:06:43] took a bunch of ignorant fishermen and
[1:06:45] put them up there and they prostrated
[1:06:47] themselves on the promise of god for 10
[1:06:49] days and nights and then the god of
[1:06:51] heaven came and dwelt in those men and
[1:06:54] jesus said a little while and the world
[1:06:56] see me no more yet he shall see me i'll
[1:06:59] be with you even in you oh glory to god
[1:07:01] that's the reason he said in mark 16
[1:07:03] these signs shall follow them to believe
[1:07:05] it was a living god in a man that could
[1:07:08] lay himself before god according to the
[1:07:10] word and the word of god may manifest in
[1:07:12] them it's a paradox and every time you
[1:07:15] see a man receive the baptism of the
[1:07:17] holy ghost it's a paradox how the god of
[1:07:20] heaven makes himself known in this man
[1:07:22] talking through him working through him
[1:07:25] living through him it's a paradox and we
[1:07:28] are in the image of god and god took his
[1:07:30] own image and brought himself into the
[1:07:33] image of his own image that he made he
[1:07:36] stepped into his own image okay the lord
[1:07:38] i shout what is it a paradox and course
[1:07:42] in a word message to put the image
[1:07:44] inside of you that that image is the
[1:07:46] body that he gonna step into air to a
[1:07:48] glory to god what a paradox
[1:07:51] glory to god the true worshipers gonna
[1:07:54] worship in spirit untruth
[1:07:57] oh my
[1:07:58] we are about to close
[1:08:00] first john 5 21 says little children
[1:08:03] keep yourselves from idols
[1:08:05] and the amplified it says little

[1:08:47] is idolatry when i'm saying you know
[1:08:49] you're not really praying you're not
[1:08:50] communicating with god you're just
[1:08:51] reading reading reading and reading
[1:08:54] you have to meet the god that what
[1:08:55] you're reading
[1:08:57] oh glory to god hallelujah describing
[1:08:59] pharisees had the books in them they
[1:09:01] were reading or when the living would
[1:09:02] come they rejected it
[1:09:04] hallelujah you can put anything as a god
[1:09:08] colossians 3 verse 1 says if ye then be
[1:09:11] risen with christ seek those things
[1:09:13] which are above where christ sitted on
[1:09:16] the right hand of god set your
[1:09:17] affectionate things above not on things
[1:09:19] of the earth for you are dead and your
[1:09:22] life is healed with christ in god

[1:09:40] evil conspiracies and consciousnesses
[1:09:43] which is idolatry
[1:09:46] he actually say conversation senses
[1:09:48] which is idolatry and consciousness is a
[1:09:50] strong desire to possess or have
[1:09:53] something especially something that
[1:09:55] belongs to someone else
[1:09:58] that's confidential you're not
[1:10:01] it's confident because
[1:10:02] that person have it
[1:10:03] and your eyes long it's got a long eye
[1:10:07] you want it
[1:10:09] after it and that passion that i was
[1:10:11] driving you that's what happened yeah

[1:10:17] they don't take the silver don't take
[1:10:19] the gold ache and eyes see it
[1:10:22] and he tells he said boy there's a good
[1:10:23] investment you know
[1:10:26] it was in his heart
[1:10:27] just like locked wife heart wants to
[1:10:29] look back
[1:10:30] in aiken's heart he coveted that that
[1:10:33] babylonian garment a garment

[1:11:19] wrath of god comment on the churn of
[1:11:21] disobedience in the which he also walked
[1:11:24] some time when you lived in them but now
[1:11:26] you also have to put off these things
[1:11:28] now he's not talking to non-christians
[1:11:30] here he's talking to christian believers
[1:11:32] who have stuff to deal with so you say
[1:11:34] you've got to put away watch he said he
[1:11:36] said no you put off anger
[1:11:39] rat malice blasphemy filthy
[1:11:42] communication out of your mouth lying at
[1:11:44] one to another seeing that you have put
[1:11:46] off the old man with his deeds and have
[1:11:48] put on the new man which is renewed in
[1:11:50] knowledge after the image of him that
[1:11:52] created him wherefore there is neither
[1:11:54] greek nor jews circumcision or
[1:11:55] uncircumcision barbarian skintion born
[1:11:58] or free but christ is all in and all
[1:12:00] right
[1:12:00] oh my so when you talk about uh uh um
[1:12:04] what what scripture is that here five
[1:12:06] mortify and the amplified it says so
[1:12:09] kill deaden deprive of power the evil
[1:12:12] desire looking in your members those
[1:12:14] animal impulses and all that is earthly
[1:12:17] in you that is employed in sin
[1:12:20] look at that employees
[1:12:22] sexual advice impurity sensual appetites
[1:12:26] unholy desires and all greed and
[1:12:28] confidences for that is idolatry the
[1:12:31] define of self and other created things
[1:12:34] instead of god
[1:12:36] the defining of self
[1:12:39] and other things
[1:12:40] praise and be to jesus hallelujah
[1:12:42] galatians 5. you're almost done
[1:12:45] galatians 5 13 says for brethren you
[1:12:47] have been called unto liberty only use
[1:12:50] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh
[1:12:53] but by love save one another for all the
[1:12:56] law is fulfilled
[1:12:58] in one word even this thou shall love
[1:12:59] thy neighbor
[1:13:01] as thyself
[1:13:02] and if you bite and evolve one another
[1:13:04] take heed as he be not consume one
[1:13:06] another then i say then walk in the
[1:13:07] spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:13:09] the flesh for the flesh lusted against
[1:13:11] the spirit and the spirit against the
[1:13:13] flesh and these are contrary one to
[1:13:15] another so then you cannot do the things
[1:13:17] that you would but if you be led by the
[1:13:19] spirit you are not under the law now the
[1:13:21] works of the flesh are manifest and he's
[1:13:23] going to identify what it is which are
[1:13:25] these adultery
[1:13:27] fornication
[1:13:28] uncleanness lazy viciousness idolatry so
[1:13:32] isolator is a work of the flesh
[1:13:34] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[1:13:36] rats strife seditions heresies envyings
[1:13:39] murders drunkenness revelants and such
[1:13:41] like of which i tell you
[1:13:43] as such i've told you in times past that
[1:13:45] they which do such things shall not
[1:13:47] inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit
[1:13:50] of the spirit is love joy peace
[1:13:53] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[1:13:56] meekness temperance against such there
[1:13:57] is no law and they are christ have
[1:14:00] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:14:02] and lust and if we live in the spirit
[1:14:04] let us also
[1:14:05] walk in the spirit let us not be
[1:14:07] desirous of vain glory provoking one
[1:14:10] another and envying one another oh
