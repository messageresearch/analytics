[7:09] 10 read verse 12 to
[7:13] 14 in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 1-
[7:18] 2 Joshua 10
[7:21] ver2 then speak Joshua to the Lord in
[7:24] the day when the Lord delivered up the
[7:26] amorites before the children of Israel
[7:29] and he said in and he said in the sight
[7:32] of the of Israel son stand thou still
[7:35] upon gibon and thou moon in the valley
[7:38] of aelon and the sun Stood Still and the
[7:41] moon stayed until the people had Avenged
[7:44] themselves upon their enemies is not
[7:47] this written in the book of josha so the
[7:49] son stood still in the midst of heaven
[7:52] and hasted not to go down about a whole
[7:55] day and there was no day like that day
[7:58] before it or after it
[8:00] that the Lord hacken unto the voice of a
[8:02] man for the Lord fought for Israel
[8:34] en
[9:01] is amen amen Hebrews
[9:06] 4:1 let us therefore
[9:08] fear lest a promise being left us of
[9:11] entering into his rest any of you should
[9:14] seem to come short of it for unto us was
[9:17] the Gospel preached as well as unto them
[9:20] but the word preached did not profit
[9:22] them not being mixed with faith in them
[9:25] that had it
[9:53] may the Lord have a blessing
[9:57] to please be seated
[10:00] hallelujah hallelujah you love him
[10:03] praise the Lord so we are in for a good
[10:06] time this
[10:08] weekend because the word is
[10:10] written and the word is
[10:13] spoken and that word is
[10:16] eternal it came from God and it must
[10:20] fulfill the purpose for which God has
[10:23] sent so this weekend the lord has laid
[10:27] on the heart of our pastor
[10:30] to call us on the
[10:33] inspiration stepping into a higher
[10:38] Ministry of speaking the
[10:41] word and this word is not the word of
[10:44] man is the word of
[10:47] God Eternal Word full of
[10:50] [Music]
[10:51] promises in
[10:53] Jesus the ways that I
[10:55] speak they are
[11:00] so we are turning a
[11:02] corner the bride has left
[11:06] Pentecost bride has left the
[11:09] humanistic the bride is walking by
[11:13] faith led by the
[11:15] spirit the clouds may be
[11:19] dark but the is
[11:23] shining so we are stepping to a higher
[11:25] Ministry
[11:29] of the
[11:31] preach is the ministry of
[11:33] the the ministry of Sons and Daughters
[11:36] of
[11:37] God so for the title this
[11:40] morning I want to speak on the title
[11:44] return
[11:49] and now when God brought when God
[11:52] brought his first son on
[11:54] Earth gave them the word and they were
[11:57] to live by the word
[12:00] speak by the word manifest the word it
[12:03] was a spoken word that was handed over
[12:06] to
[12:07] Adam and Adam had the book it was the
[12:11] book of life that was Christ himself
[12:15] that was in the pages of that
[12:17] book Adam could speak and it will be
[12:21] because that book was God
[12:23] himself come on church and the prophet
[12:26] said the word is in the
[12:29] and that book is back
[12:31] onday when the enemy came in the
[12:35] garden came in the garden sin came
[12:39] in Adam lost that
[12:42] book but there was Prophecy in the
[12:45] word
[12:47] will say of the
[12:49] Lord sin came
[12:51] in fell short of the glory of
[12:55] God kicked out of the garden
[13:00] and God sent the
[13:02] cherubin to protect that book of
[13:05] life protect that of
[13:08] life because if he didn't do that we
[13:11] will eat that book of
[13:16] life we will live forever with
[13:20] sin so he drove Adam out of the
[13:23] gard and protected that of
[13:26] life that no sin could come near
[13:32] and at the time
[13:34] appointed he paid the price to get rid
[13:37] of sin and to restore us
[13:40] back so I am calling you back today that
[13:44] sin is over that's the essence of
[13:48] Calvary Jesus died that he would take
[13:51] away our sins and bring us back to the
[13:55] tree of life but this time
[13:59] we are coming back with
[14:02] discernment are coming back as born Sons
[14:06] we are coming back as true
[14:09] Sons coming back as fil Sons by the
[14:14] word the spirit we are not like Adam we
[14:18] are not like Eve we have a
[14:21] revelation that the word is our comfort
[14:25] the word is our Fortress the word is our
[14:27] overcoming power
[14:30] and that word is Jesus Christ it cannot
[14:33] be
[14:34] defeated the word must come to
[14:36] pass whatever that word has
[14:39] spoken conning you it shall come to pass
[14:44] so this day God is inviting you
[14:48] back because the sin person has been
[14:51] setled don't care where you are being I
[14:54] don't care what the devil has laid on
[14:56] you Jesus went to Calvary
[15:01] of Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[15:04] Hallelujah in Revelations 5 in
[15:07] Revelations that book no man was worthy
[15:12] to look on that book no man was worthy
[15:15] take that book and lose the seals
[15:19] thereof but there was one that was wor
[15:22] that was the lamb the Lamb of God was
[15:25] worthy there is not your righteous
[15:29] not returning by Your
[15:30] Righteous Jesus made a
[15:34] way this
[15:36] morning there was no
[15:38] way in
[15:40] sin in iniquity we couldn't help
[15:44] ourselves your name was there you are
[15:48] always a part of
[15:50] God saw your name shed the blood and the
[15:55] voice spoke
[15:56] out is not about man

[16:02] predestination

[16:17] tribe God and that

[16:23] morning and when John turned to
[16:25] look it was a bleedy blooded lamb
[16:29] so what happened 2024 years
[16:34] ago was just a physical
[16:38] Pro because when the lamb was
[16:41] slain before the foundation of

[30:41] said don't write them at

[31:00] when the seventh Thunder
[31:01] [Music]
[31:02] mystery is

[31:16] revealed praise God it will give
[31:20] Faith the seven tunders seven Mysteries
[31:25] when they are
