you for this great opportunity you have given unto us in time in time that we can be redeemed that we can be rescued that we can be saved that we can be delivered Lord your word declare Thousand Years is as one day 70 years is just like a flash God help us tonight and Minister To Us by Your Word truth God your word declar the time will come when people will not endure some Doctrine but with Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears things that would consume upon their own lust what they desire to hear what they desire to know what they desire to understand but Lord he has a will for every age there's a word for every age there's a mind of God for every age every time every season there's a reason why you put seasons in time and how everything have a a a season and a time to every purpose under Heaven God there's a purpose and reason why we're in this virtual room tonight technology has afforded us this opportunity that we couldn't have had years ago we want to take take advantage of it we want to take best use of it God and may it be no hyp hypocrisy but we tonight in our own closet in our own rooms in our own homes can talk it over with you as we approach your word tonight minister to us I pray in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and we would want to go straight into what we like to share with you tonight before we get down in prayer I a thought I want to share with you when you pray and it's from Luke chapter 11 and I just want to read it and then we going share I believe we read this sometime back it came to pass as he talk about Jesus was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of the disciples said to him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and he said unto them when you pray say our father we are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in in heaven so in Earth give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive everyone that is in debted to us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil I stop right there but he went on to give a parable just after that I I want to just share this here now you say then brother brandham why is it that we do not do the things that we should do how is it our gifts and things in the church does not come to its color to where it should be how is it our church does not lift up into the spot where it should be the people in the testing time drops away like Israel did they think that God has left them but remember the rock never left Israel Israel left the rock it forgot about the rock being with them all the time it was right there it went right with them to the end of the road it followed them it wasn't out of speaking distance it was wasn't out of hearing distance or it wasn't out of seeing distance and neither is Christ with the church today he is not out of speaking distance some of you have backslid done that which is wrong you have lost your joy your water is dried up he is still and speaking distance of you he follows you he knows every move you make and everything you do he is longing to hear you call him on the scene this is so Sublime this last statement here he is Longing To Hear You Calling on the scene and this great Pentecostal move today God is waiting for you to call him on the scene you're not out of speaking distance with him do though we have done wrong and sinned turn our backs on him done things we ought not to do but he is with us Christ said he would be with us now all God's system is put up by Lords and you talk about the Earth spinning and and how the watch timing and everything else is governed by Lords so even though you could ask for General it cannot go contrary to the laws of God now listen to list if we could only realize that he is here with us the same yesterday today and forever L I'm with you always I'll never leave you never forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world let me say this we were all born in sin shape iniquity let's put it this way humans a man could be born educated grow up get married get a job have house Car Land get old and die without God live a fairly good life not crooked straight upright without God God is not forcing anyone to serve him he said no man could come except the father draw him so the fact that you in this Virg room tonight it means not a human draw you but God himself is what draw you even if you're backd even if you fail your fell your sin your whatever that may be going on with you right now it doesn't cancel the call of God upon your life because each one of us couldn't pull ourselves up something greater than us and more powerful than us had to influence us to have a desire to Ser him remember he describe our heart a Stony and he asks for exchange if you give me a Stony your Stony heart which is which is a rebellious heart which is a heart that is out of tune with the principles and the things of God I will give you a heart of Flesh he is so gracious that he promises a new spirit and that new spirit is to help us to get along with the holy spirit because with anger temper bad attitude hereditary DNA genetic whatever from the generations P we fighting God because the flesh man fights God so it has to be more than flesh that drives us to even call upon him because we are not serving a god of wood or stone it's an invisible God we can't see with our eyes we can't touch with our hands but we believe and we have seen results of us TR trusting him and having confidence in him are you with me tonight praise the Lord so now he says now I will never leave you nor forsake you how can we be sure by his proven word there we go he is now waiting for you to call him on the scene to be proved so let us go and awake Christ in our lives how do you awake Christ by believing his word and Faith brings him on the scene that is what brings on the scene Fai then call on him to confer his word let that be engrave in your heart tonight call on him to confirm his word his word of being a deliverer his word of being a baptizer his word of being a Healer his word of being a provider his word of being a way maker his word of being a shield a rock whatever his word declares him to be you could call on him tonight to confirm his own word in your life so then call on him here we go to confirm his word and don't doubt in fear don't do that just believe him as it is written let it be done and God will prove to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now the scripture we read and Jesus and we talk about the laws of God how God have his laws that's why we have the sun doesn't feel led to rise in the North or the sun set it in the in the east no it rise in the east it sets in the west it's God's laws that have the moon a certain place Tides everything is is the law of God so watch this after Jesus taught them to pray Our Father Who was in heaven and so like that this key part thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth and all of this acknowledging where he is his name is Holy his kingdom is coming and the will of God to be done is before a request is made to give us day by day our daily bread not after Daily Bread forgiveness of sins conditional as we also forgive those who trespass against us or indebted to us so our forgiveness or your forgiveness is connected to your ability to forgive those that have trespass or owe you or treat them badly and and the prayer goes on deeper to say lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from all evil so what that tells you is that the Temptation Arrow will be set up Temptation roads going to be dear but you don't want to be drawn there you want to pray for a breakthrough that you don't go down there because when people go down there it's tough to come out but then he said this and there one that we familiar with I wouldn't go through inail of it which one of you have a friend shall go to him at midnight and say unto him friend let me Tre loaves now remember Parables and Mysteries and stories Jesus Is Telling with hidden hidden stuff inside of it and he says now is a friend you know you're familiar with it you're custom going by that friend and the friend come and said which of you have a friend and shall go onto him at midnight look at the time say friend let me Tre L for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me I have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and see trouble be not the door is now shut my children are me in bed I cannot rise and give it me I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity or persistence he'll rise and give him as many as he needed so here where I want to go tonight when Jesus taught them to pray that wasn't the end of it that was like a template a template is something you could use to express things so what Jesus G was a template but this part here this par is connected to prayer because what he's trying to share with them is that you wouldn't get from that friend because it's a friend what a friend we have in Jesus not friend but you will get because of your persistence or perseverance so right after that as he give this Parable he say I say unto you ask it shall be given you it template again seek and you shall find this is template him knock it shall be open unto you so you could say you have prayed this and God didn't answer you have prayed this and it didn't work out you have prayed this but what you are taking is the template you're not looking at the fine print that enforces this template that God give you that is verse 9 here what verse 10 for everyone that ask receive it or this is not something in addition he's talking about the way you're asking not once but ask it he that seeketh find it keep on seeking until to him that knock it shall be open and brother Isaac last Friday exalted us on Hannah who was being tormented by the next wife and terrorized in church because she couldn't have a child and she was praying in bitterness she was praying maybe with Revenge she was praying that God maybe vindicate and shut him out of the critics and whatever whatever whatever and when her prayer changed and she adjusted her prayer to say God you know what I'm not praying based upon my enemies I'm not praying based upon who's against me who wronged me I'm praying because I love you I want to serve you and I want to bring glory to you so if you would bless me with a son I will give him to you and God blessed her with Samuel a prophet as soon as a pray and she knew she knew when things change because the Bible said she was no more sad year in year out it affected her countenance it affecting her stress level it affecting her all over but as soon as she changed a prayer there was a joy something happened something click and I'm hoping tonight that something click with you tonight forget what you pray in the past ask God to inspire by Revelation and inspiration keys that can unlock the doors because he's not far from you in speaking terms with him he's listening you know it have um the Apple have something called Siri and they have a something called everybody a product where you could talk Amazon have some called Alexa and you could speak and it's listening always listening you could say play a song play this everybody want this automatic and spoken words stuff and like that and sometimes I'm in the car and I say something and Google saying something as if I Ain talk to you but the technology now they're listening they're listening and I want you to see how God is listening he's listening to hear and if we could only see the power of our prayer and how the devil want to bind him out want to make sure you don't get through them because he don't have access like this he have no such access this is for sons and daughters even if we are Fallen Sons and Daughters we still have access rights because we could be restored he's our father he give us a place that we could have an inheritance he give us a place in his kingdom but he wants to communicate with us and relate to us are you get me tonight let me just see if I could finish up here I don't want to stay too long with you okay all right so and then he went on to say if a son ask for a bread would you give him a stone if he being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him so this tells us two things here the holy spirit is given one and you have to ask for and he already give you the template for asking seeking and knocking you're not asking once and saying but okay that's it I ask and I it we see going to work out no no no you're asking until they got to have a response okay when you pray Jesus in Luke 24:46 says and when said unto them why sleep he rise and pray least you enter into temptation so prayer would influence or affect what level of Temptation come your way because he said what Jesus says why sleep you rise and pray Le see enter into temptation so a prayerless life is a life looking for trouble looking for Temptation Temptation will come to a prayerless life Matthew 26:41 watch and pray that you enter not into temptation and here he gives a reason the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak that is what he give here Spirit willing flesh weak what do you do pray and you pray you're praying for yourself alone for your family alone this is James 5:116 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man a at much not prayer effectual fervent prayer you do want to be sa saying words you don't want to saying like you're saying our father and H Mary and you're repeating stuff okay the effect your fervent prayer of a righteous man are at much Mark 13:33 take a heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is this is Jesus words now take heed watch and pray for you know not what when the time is when the time is for your healing when your time is for deliverance when your time for the angel come knocking on your door you don't know so you want to say stay ready and be ready and this one here now familiar one Mark 11 not 23 but 24 therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them or believe it is granted to you and you will get it believe you receive it and you you shall have it and here the condition under that when you stand praying forgive so it's almost as if you want God to answer your prayer but then God sends down his thermometer to see if there's any ought or Grudge or anything in the heart so if there's anything even though he wants to answer he can't answer because his law doesn't allow him to answer a prayer from a unforgiving heart how many get that tonight he is hearing you as his child he was hearing you as a son or a daughter but he cannot answer because his law doesn't permit him to receive a prayer somebody somebody say every okay so think about it now prayer requests going up to God a lot of pray everybody praying all over the world prayer and whatnot what do you think will catches attention people praying with bad behavior people praying and they hate this one people praying and they have all kind of issues in their heart those prayers going to a certain side because that can't really connect in the principles and the laws of God but here it is a saint you here you may not be conscious of it but there's something need to be made right there something to get out your system and he's waiting for that that the prayer can reach the level where Heaven's Heaven respond so you don't want to say prayer as you're going through a motion you want to pray that heaven respond like when Daniel begin to pray and and and and Gabriel was fighting and fighting Devils to get a message to Daniel um and he says now if Daniel has stopped praying the angels have coming so he us to pray and his persistence and perseverance is pulling Angelic invisible forces into being on his behalf oh praise God so let's see if we can wrap this up up here now all right when you stand praying so pray that is granted to you you have it all right that's the top level but then now here comes this part but when you pray forgive if you have ought against any that your father which is heaven May forgive your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses so come like a pray shut up Heaven is brass to you your blessings is be denied is reserved it is held up until you do your do and adjust your stuff Matthew 6 he was telling them okay not just about when you pray but how not to pray you say not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corner of the streets the reason the reason that they may be seen of men y they have their reward but when thou prayest like tonight enter into thy closet when thou are shut thy door pray to thy father which SE in secret and the Father which see in secret shall wor you openly that he went down further when you pray use not vain repetitions so he's telling you what to do and what not to do don't be like the Hypocrites looking to be seen don't use V repetitions as the Heen do for they think they shall be heard for their much speak be not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him and he said after this manner therefore you pray Our Father which are in heaven and he said the same thing give us this day our daily bread and so like that right then I'll close with this part here moreover when you fast this is fasting not if but when not if you pray but when you pray when you fast be not as the Hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their face that they may appear unto men to fast they have their reward when those fasting anoint thy head wash your face when th appear unto men not fast but unto thy father that thou appear not unto men fast but unto thy father which is in secret thy father which is in secret shall wor openly okay I have more stuff here but I no time would I'll read one of it deuteron Deuteronomy chapter 6 now these are the Commandments the statutes the judgments your lord your God commanded to teach you that he might do them in the land whether you go to possess it now remember this bunch of people that was Generations Generations 400 years of people grandchildren and and so on coming up they don't know God they just know God was with Abraham and Isaac and so on but they have never met him they never see you so they had to be taught and that's what we in this room here tonight to be taught to pray to be taught how to use the keys to be taught how to please God what pleases God we had to learn because we we wasn't born with the word of God in our mouths and our hearts so he is saying here that God command to teach you that he might do them in the land whether you go to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all his statutes and his Commandments which I command thee thou and thy son and thy son son all the days of thy life and that that days thy days May prolong hear therefore o Israel and observe to do it that it may dwell with thee and that he may increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers had promised thee in the land that thren milk milk and honey here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might and and these words which I command the this day shall be in thy heart here we go verse seven Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thy house when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down when thou risest up Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand they shall be as frontlets between Thine Eyes thou sh write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates so could you imagine God trying to drive this at the parental level at Mom and Dad father and mothers and saying Teach this to your children now you cannot teach what you don't know so you have to learn in order to teach verse 11 of okay write it upon the post of thy house on the gates verse 10 it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land where you swear unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not and houses full of all good thing which thou fillest not and Wells digs which thou digest not Vineyards and olive trees which thou plest not and thou shall have eaten and be full then beware least thou forg yet the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage Thou shalt fear the lord thy God and serve him and shall sway by his name you shall not go after other gods or the gods of the people that are around about you for the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you Le the anger of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee and destroy the from off the face of the Earth he shall not tempt the Lord your God as he tempted him in Massa he shall diligently keep the Commandments of the Lord your God and His testimonies and the statutes which he commanded the and thou shalt do which is right and good in the sight of the Lord that it may be well with thee that thou may go in and possess the good land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to cast out all thy enemies from before thee as the Lord had spoken and when thy son ask thee here we go in time to come so all this is prophecy hanging over them they hit the land yet but this is what they're going into and when the time that I son ask thee in time to come saying what mean it what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord of God have commanded you then shalt thou say unto thy son we were in Pharaoh's bondsman Egypt and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty man and the Lord show signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt upon pharaoh and all his household before our eyes and he brought us out from Den that he might bring us to give us the land which he swe onto our fathers and the Lord has commanded us to do all these statutes to fear God our God fear the lord our God for our good always that he might preserve Us Alive as it in this day and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all the Commandments before the Lord Our God as they commanded us let's bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight for your word Lord When you pray God may we take this God of the Bible to be real Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new and you are the same yeserday today today and forever oh God in this evil time look over our children look over our sons and daughters look over our grandchildren look over husbands and wives look over fathers and mothers look over families and households preserve the seed of the
