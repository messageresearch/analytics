you today tonight lord in in this moment lord we thank you for life strength for lord being able to breathe and being able to lord to cut off everything else every distraction every situation everything that we cannot control the things that you don't even want us to try to control lord and focus on you lord the one who put us here called us by name predestinated us before we even had a consciousness or a realization of who we are and whose we are and we thank you tonight lord for preserving our lives lord and for giving us through your grace lord the opportunity to see your plan your purpose your intent lord and how you have expressed your love to us that we with the very best of our efforts we could never repay lord we don't thank you enough we don't express our gratitude enough lord we sometimes make attempts we use different words but if we really were to search our hearts and consider lord how much of a blessing you have been to us lord even when we did wrong even when we lord would have messed up and when we didn't do our part of this contract this relationship this covenant law that you have established lord with us lord that if we love you lord we should keep your commandments lord you have time and time again without hesitation without reservation express your love for us lord you don't hold back anything you don't hold anything back from us lord because your love sees past lord our failures and our faults and you look to the blood and lord and you continue to see the best in us lord you continue to see the potential in us you look lord pass our present situation and see the seed in us that has the genetic code to lord reproduce itself and to produce that hidden life in jesus christ so lord we want to pause lord and put the brakes on our lives and lord reboot lord as the bible said be transformed by the renewing of our minds lord to reframe our thinking to law to come back to the to the north star to to get our lives back in line with your word and lord we are so grateful for how you have been with us you have kept us you have lord lord looked over us lord even when we didn't understand so now as we come to another study a time or conversation around your word lord may you speak to hearts tonight lord take complete control of the service may you take me out of the way lord bless those that are in this room tonight lord who are so dedicated so devoted lord so disciplined lord that discipline of the word to report for duty as it were lord to answer the call the call for communion the call for fellowship the call for sacrifice the call to do extra to be extraordinary the call to do something different lord may you motivate us inspire us encourage us chastise us correct us lead us lord we surrender our will to you we surrender our thoughts to you lord we repent of lord the things that we have done that we should not do we repent of the things that lord we should do and have not done lord we lay our lives at your feet and we come to the sacred scriptures the word to see how we reflect to this word to see how our behaviors and different situations different lord opportunities that may come to us lord and if we lord could take this book as an example of how we should live because this book is you so father if there's anyone sick in our midst tonight may your healing virtue your reign of the presence of the lord fall upon them in their homes where they are may we lord establish our altars in our homes and on our lives and lord you said we could preach too much we could sing too much but we can never pray too much father i just feel led right now to lord to take this this time to lord to call upon your name and to put you first lord lord there are so many needs lord and lord we are needy people lord yes we are gonna get into the word but father you said we also have not because we ask not lord and lord our hearts lord there are so many needs in the church that lord may be expressed and there are those needs that are not even expressed lord lord may you minister to every situation tonight lord you know the situations that i don't know you know the situations that lord we can never understand that your people go through and by your grace and your wisdom and by your decision and your sovereignty lord you pass each of us through our own journeys to come to you lord some through the water some through the fire some to the flood lord but lord all through that blood father so father lord may you lord meet each of us lord at the point of our needs lord we commit the service tonight into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen it's certainly a great privilege to be here one more time in the presence of the lord the bible said where there are two or three gathered in his name there he is in the midst and we thank god for his love for preserving life for bringing us back one more time and it's not something that we could ever take for granted um we are not promised tomorrow so we are so grateful uh to be here right now and to take full use and to redeem the time and take full advantage of the opportunities that are given to us uh to be better christians to be better sons to be better daughters to be better men women better servants better examples and to raise above the mediocrity that has become so pervasive and so normal in this world that we live in and we realize that as we look through scripture and we look through the word of god god is not about average and mediocre and halfway and by chance and by accident he's a god of perfection you know when he was finished after each day in genesis he said it is good it is good it is good it's not it was poke or poke it's not it was okay it's not it it could pass it was good he was satisfied he was pleased and through scripture you see this type and this parallel this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased that god wants to be pleased with our behavior with our conduct with our attitude with how we deal with different situations and through the word we realize that situations will come to us to try us to test us not because god feeling tries or testifies but over would say but it is to ensure that the metal and the quality of our character is being honed for leadership you know and last week by the grace of god we started to look at joseph and it is it is a simple story many know it many have studied it but through that simple story as it unfolds we see the character of a man being molded and many of us in the same situation may be inclined to respond differently you know and sometimes you only know what's in you when a situation arises and that understanding is what gives rise to how god has to operate because if everything your daily life your daily situations are to your expectation then there is nothing to bring out the parts of you that you don't know exist and you would surprise yourself what's locked up in you that situations have to come to raise up you know there are people who who never thought that they would backslide they were people who never thought they would make certain mistakes there are people who never thought they would succeed they didn't even realize that success was in them and it was crisis it was desperation it was some situation that that that sparked a response in them an attitude in them that led to them being where they're at and uh for for for those who have been along this journey with us i i i am one who looks for the practical side of this because for a very long time i've seen a disconnect a misalignment between the word and daily living and it troubles me uh how the word could be so clear and there's this challenge to reconcile our behaviors our attitudes our lives with this word because the moment our lives and this world gets connected it is not a performance it's not a show it is it is not something that you could put on it's authentic you know and and and that authenticity is what we are fighting for you know when you live a life a life of lies you know you you begin to forget which lie you tell to who you know but when you are truthful and you're honest and there's this connection between this word that we teach and we preach and your daily living the effort of it the transparency of it that is really what the thunder is that shakes the devil because you close the windows the doors in your life that that you give no room for the devil to begin to move in your life and that is what we are want to encourage each of us for to deal with the challenges of life that will come to us in ways that we don't expect sometimes it's just exhaustion he's just tired you know sometimes you're just overwhelmed and and and that's okay because when you look at jesus own experience and we have preached it before that when jesus had to go and and and deal with that man on the other side the man who who who had legion upon him you know all those devils upon him the bible said they had to to carry jesus to the boat and we have taught that that would carry was to physically lift because jesus was so tired from his ministering that he was exhausted so there are times in our lives when we will have to deal with exhaustion and deal with with the burdens and and their situation that will confront us that we did not expect and the to the very best of our planning we cannot plan for everything because it is the nature of this call it human experience you know and and we're trying to reconcile this human experience in in this dimension and this realm that god has put us here to prove that despite all that comes to us the seed in us is resilient enough to withstand anything he that is greater in you is that greater than what's in the world you know so so we are thankful tonight that we are still standing that itself is a reason to be appreciative that after all is said and done we are still standing we still believe you are you might be a wounded eagle you might you might have some feathers that is not in the right place but you're still an eagle you're identified with eagles you know it's like i think brother branham said the man who came to church with without eternity he just had gums and they said listen maybe they're looking my i use my gum but i'm using whatever i have because that is my testimony you know so we come tonight once again um i i i wouldn't jump over the ceiling and say i have all my strength i told my wife just before this i feel exhausted you know but i am reporting for duty with my physical exhaustion um because i believe that the purpose that god called us for is bigger than sometimes our individual situations and true christianity is is living for each other you know and it follows my lot tonight to try to encourage us and i'm using me with us i'm placing myself in there as well to encourage us to to press encourage us to fight encourage us to act encourage us to do encourage us to persevere encourage us to overlook certain things that that that we allow to affect us too much and to shake it off like like like paul shook off this little point or shook up the snake you know you can't let everything get to you you know you know and um you know sometimes when you look back and you see your response on how you respond to certain situations and you start to see maturity when you realize you don't have to respond that way anymore because you get a deeper understanding of what you can control and what you cannot control you know so i truly believe that the word of god comes to make us complete it comes to make us whole you know and the bible gives us these references you know entire wanting nothing complete finish a lot of the word speaks to this finishing putting the finishing touches on our lives many of the things that we speak in bible study and we speak in church we know we heard we read you know we have been around for a while so so there's there's not much that we could say tonight that you me we may have never heard before but the reality is the finishing touches take time the hardest part of building a house is putting the finishing touches especially if you're particular there are some people who are not too particular about things you know anything goes the pain to run on the side of the wall they really care somebody paint the wall and paint the light switch there whatever that they are all paint then you hold light richly wall but there's some people who don't tolerate that they want to make sure that the light switch i get paint they want to make sure they put it tape first to make sure only parts that's supposed to get pain supposed to get paint that is when you have a level of consciousness on how things are finished you know and and many of us we struggle with attention to details you know we we tolerate things because we don't want to take the time to pay attention to the to the finer details and and anybody who is in the business of finishing you know it's easy to is it it's easy to mix concrete and put it in a wheelbarrow and try it in a foundation you know you're not you have to be a con a construction expert to take a wheelbarrow and through it and you're casting out flow and casting our flow but you see when you're finished cut the floor and you're putting moulding and these finer things you can't just pick up anybody and tell them putty molding in place the art of finishing anything you need to slow down a little bit because you want it on a certain way you want it done just right and i believe that we are in the phase of our journey here in this age of the finishing nobody finishing of these seven seals nobody the finishing of the body the finishing touches that bring it brings it to perfection and our promise is perfection and because god is perfect and his desire is for us to be perfect he will take time and he will spend as much time as he needs to make sure these finer things in us that we should have are being displayed and the things that would not make it to the other side will be eliminated from our existence i don't know if this is helping anybody i know this is bible study but sometimes in these settings we get inspired to just have a conversation that will motivate all of us to to be patient about the process you know you cannot rush perfection you can't be perfect overnight it takes time it takes introspection it takes reflection it takes analysis but anthony was preaching a few weeks ago about that masterpiece i know sometimes you just sit for a while and you look at it to make sure that the vision is being maintained and that that that that there is an alignment with what was in your heart originally and to make sure that that the next spot you touch is the right spot to touch so i pray tonight that through this word for however long we are here tonight that god would put some finishing touches in our lives some finishing touches as husbands finishing touches as fathers finishing touches as sons finishing touches as wives and and and i have to believe that you know you have some finishing to do you know i know i have some finishing to do i want god to begin to operate on me so that i have the right words the right expression the right life so that the words and the life are in line and the word the life and the word is in line and that should be our desire tonight so i pray that you are encouraged and motivated and um last week i was i i we were looking at joseph and it's such a powerful story and um you know sometimes when you slow down and you think about it not many of us could handle the experience that joseph went through not many of us could deal with the deep deep rejection of family you know it is not expressed in that way but that is what it was the deep rejection of siblings and being thrown out of your house thrown out of your family being almost forgotten completely and when you understand deeply and you spend time contemplating the experience that joseph would have had at a young age barely able to have a deep understanding of the emotional impact and the psychological impact because these things are real we'd be foolish to to live in this in this in this spiritual construct where things don't go wrong and and and we cover it up with with we fight in the fight to not deal with the fact that joseph would have been broken he would have been disappointed he would have been hurt he would have felt rejected you know we'd read in scripture how he he cried and he screamed you know which shock at the fact that the people he grew up with his skin his blood would give him a way of not knowing the outcome not knowing the consequence not knowing where he would end up not knowing if he would live or die and for those brief moments of his last look at his brothers the thoughts flashing through his mind would i ever see them again would i ever come back to my home again would i ever see my father again would i ever see my family again would i ever see my people again and being snatched into a new experience and having to reconcile dealing with the unknown dealing with uncertainty dealing with having to confront decisions he would have never had to make before we would have read last week how he was not even familiar with the terrain of where they would have the sheep and the farming because when he got to where he expected them he found himself lost and somebody had to tell him where his brothers might be he didn't even have a understanding of the of the places they might even carry them because he was unfamiliar with what his older brothers would have done he was protected he was his father's favorite child so there are certain things he would not have had to do and experience because that's how favorites typically are they are protected they are served and all these things and how god would would have to shake that experience and bring him into a spot that he went from being a favorite to being a slave and yet still in the condition of being a slave how the blessing of the lord and not just the blessing of the lord but you could be blessed and be lazy with a blessing you know you could be blessed and do nothing with your blessing you could be blessed and and sit there with a blessing you know and we read the scriptures and many people don't don't study it enough but the bible says gifts and callings are without repentance and that means that when god gives something he doesn't take it back he gives it without hesitation he gives it and there are many people who are gifted and they do nothing with their gifts so you'll see paul exhorting timothy study to show yourself approved the gift is there we're not questioning if the gift is there but if you don't study you can't show yourself approved so there is a responsibility placed on us to do more to do extra to towards mastery they call jesus good master for a reason because he demonstrated a level of mastery so there's nothing that is there that is said in in a way that that makes it confusing or distracting it is just we have to realize what is possible we have to realize that god put us here and and what we need to do for the journey that god gave us it's already in us you know the challenge for us is to break out of the limitations imposed by others or even what we put on ourselves to break out higher so we would have ended last week uh at around the end of genesis 41 where after joseph was 17 years old and he would have been snatched at that time we find him the bible says 30 years old in front of pharaoh 13 years from being kidnapped snatch abandoned whatever adjective you want to use 13 years of drying out 13 years of coming into his own as it were 13 years of maturing 13 years of deeper life experiences 13 years of coming to a realization that he could have done and achieve what he didn't know was possible and had he stayed at home this would have never taken place so as we read you know he named one of one of his sons from for the lord has made me forgot forget my my sufferings and and and he has reached this spot where life is fine in so much that he almost went almost overboard you know i i know you may have never heard that before but the reality is he didn't express interest in let me send food to my father i wonder how they are doing so it's almost like he he and maybe it was a protective measure we're having a conversation because maybe he protected himself emotionally from his family so he's sitting there in power in egypt and we see joseph hasn't reached out to his family maybe he didn't want to know the truth of their well-being maybe he still was dealing with his own issues and and all these things but but we find now in genesis 42 this is where we at from verse one we would have switched from joseph coming into power and being responsible for the distribution of the stored up food agreeing to genesis 42 verse one now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do we look one upon another i love that in the amplified that last statement is why are you staring at one another in bewilderment and not taking action so here it is this is seven years of plenty of past famine is in the land obviously this is not a day into the famine because they would still have food some time would have passed and the food they would have had would have been dwindling going down going down going down and jacob and his old age saying ollie here watching one another and all you're not taking no action all i could just let get back into worse and not do anything about it you know and many times we may think that way as parents about children or we may be the ones seeing stuff happening around us and refusing to take action and we're looking around at one another and this looking out one round of one another is about responsibility here it's about who is going to do it so you're looking around one another nobody taking action but everybody looking around seeing i wonder who i wonder if i wonder how so it took jacob's rebuke for his sons to even get off the seat as it were to get into action why is it for some of us to get into action and have to take a rebuke we could spend time in this verse one we can spend the whole evening right here you know jacob saw that there was corn in egypt he is not the young one on the block he is the father he is the head of the home and he has multiple children he has 10 sons all i'm sure with their own ambitions all with their families coming up on all these things going on and none of them making a decision to say we can do something about it none of them come to daddy and say daddy i want to go and take this action he has to now drive and inspire and motivate and looking at them seeing that none of them speaking of leadership taking leadership i know many of you haven't spent time in this one verse like this if jacob took no action there would be no verse two of this story let me nail that down a little bit if jacob didn't light a fire light a fire under his sons to say why do you look one upon another you're not doing anything with your life you're sitting down here watching your food going down you're watching every day saying guys there's less rice and oh goose is less rice yes oh let's see the rice going on hey the flower lower this dude followed uh you know so so and nobody taken action to solve the problem it speaks volumes about the young people of that day and it speaks volumes about the young people of this day and we see now there's a parallel between that day and this day because there are many young people who without putting fire under them or speaking to them or motivating them or chastising them or telling them to get up and do something they will sit there looking at one another that looking at one another is akin to looking for leadership if somebody move we we go we're going to move but if nobody moving i said you know here it is that fear of being willing to stand out to be different to recognize that there's a need and decide that listen somebody has to do it why not me somebody has to get up why not me why not no why not find a way it also speaks to the fact that jacob was bringing information to his sons that they should have been aware of i want to read it one more time i hope i go into slowly but i want us to be conscious because right now the world is in its famine in many ways the world is in a hard time in many ways economically emotionally psychologically morally spiritually there's famine everywhere do you know where there's corn do you know where there's grain do you know where there's opportunity in your spiritual dimension do you know where there's opportunity financially are you gonna sit down and not update your resume are you going to sit down and say it's it's going down it's going down and not do anything about it genesis 42 is as relevant today as it is the story of then now when jacob saw so even though jacob was old or older even though jacob was in a position where maybe he wasn't the one expected to work he still kept his pulse on where the economic activity was he still kept his pulse on on on where opportunity lay he still kept his fault are you on the pulse of what's happening around you by the grace of god last sunday we were speaking about knowing and how it is important to know to be aware not of foolishness but to be aware of what's important hunger famine despair was in the land and those sons sat there looking at one another people sit in churches looking at one another sit in their homes looking at one another sit in their jobs looking at one another nobody willing to make a decision to take action famine death and no action this can be brought all the way into kings even the lepers who are the gate took action they looked at one another for a while and they decided to take action themselves nobody had to put a light under them to say get up and do but here it was jacob had to prod his sons get up do something wake up make up your bed brush your teeth go to work send out a resume go to interview go knock on the door and see there's an opportunity why why do we have to in the midst of crisis not have a personal desire to say i want to get up and pray i'm going to read a book this has to be real to you i told you there's one verse we can spend the whole time you know so when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt food in egypt opportunity in egypt the solution in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do you look one upon another verse two and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down there in order go down there and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die so jacob was saying your lack of action your lack of vision your lack of having a plan your failure to analyze the risk that we are in and the fact that this road that we are in will lead to death unless something is done now i have to instruct you to do it verse 3 and joseph's 10 [Music] went down to buy corn in egypt verse four but benjamin joseph's brother jacob sent not with his bridge in for he said les paul adventure mischief befall him so jacob is being he's managing his risk he is sending the ten sons he said not benjamin because i've already in his heart we know the pain as a father he said i've already lost joseph i'm not willing i'm not willing to take this risk do you know what risks you are not willing to take do you know the risks that you are willing to take and not willing to take the bible said which man when building a house don't consider don't consider the inputs the cost the value what he's building we need to spend more time analyzing our risks analyzing our moves analyzing our strategies we need to spend time meditating because the world has the answers but we need to spend the quality time to see what god wants us to see in scripture how he wants us to move in scripture verse five i hope this is helping somebody this evening and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that soul to all the people of the land and joseph's brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces 38. you know i was sharing with brother ovid about a week or so ago i was in a program a training program and we as going through scripture about how much god wants us to be detailed and i was in a study of how god instructed moses to write down the details of his journeys and how god instructed moses to write down the names of the men who are going into war so he could give a clear account a lot of people don't understand that these things are in scripture and i'm reading joseph was governor over the land and it was he that sold to all the people of the land which meant that joseph took his a direct hand into the affairs of this he didn't he didn't even delegate the management of this thing this one this thing was too important for him to delegate there's a balance between being a leader and delegating and knowing what you have to take responsibility for some of us believe that leadership and management is about handing out responsibilities to people but many times some people they are not able to manage the gravity of the depth of the responsibility that sometimes you have to confront within the context of your experience but here it was joseph was governor and it was he specifically he we're not trying to re it was he it was that soul he is there managing this thing for himself mind-blowing he is directly responsible because he don't want to take it for granted or take a chance that anybody mess this thing up there are some things you could delegate there are other things you have to know how important it is and the things that are most important for which your success is being measured because the reason joseph is governor is for the success of this initiative to store up food for seven years and to ensure that is budgeted for the next seven years of uncertainty that they're dealing with anybody with me tonight so i don't know how many of you seeing life business decisions budgeting planning everything is wrapped up in this you know the longer your spending is a little bitter i didn't realize there's so much so much meat and so much meat on this on this thing we eat in here number 7. at least let me read verse 6 one more time and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that soul to all the people of the land and joseph's brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth and in so doing they effectively fulfilled the dream that the 17-year-old joseph had now bear in mind the subtle message being expressed here they came with everybody else joseph is managing his affairs so so the unfolding of it is unique it is not as if joseph saw his brothers walking to him the scripture is very clear they came with all the people joseph's version came bound themselves before him with their faces city earth so the first picture that joseph has of his brothers is men with their faces to the earth he doesn't know who they are yet because they have not lifted their heads off the ground yet he doesn't know who he's ministering to yet he doesn't know who he's about to sell to yet he just sees ten men with their heads in the ground he doesn't even realize that vision scripture dream is being fulfilled by this time joseph is in egypt so long the spiritual anchor of being with his father these are things that he himself may not have even been remembering because we would see it later he only remembered it afterwards he wasn't thinking about it at that point at that point his mind is occupied with the effective administration of what was stored and the effective distribution of what was stored anybody with me tonight so let me read it again carefully so joseph's brethren came and bowed themselves before him with their faces in earth next verse verse 7 and joseph saw his brethren so i want you to picture this scene joseph is there next and the scene clears ten men head on the ground and they lift their faces and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them he recognized them he discerned them but made himself strange unto them make himself strange is not just about appearance now because let me let me read it in the amplified he he hid his identity in other words he withheld the expression of who he was obviously if you do the mathematics he was 17 years old when he left at this point this is about 20 plus years later 17 and 13 is 30 30 plus seven years of plenty that'll be 37. so 20 years plus have passed he's no longer the 17 year old boy who is running wrong telling dreams 37 plus years have passed so in other words the last time they had seen him the last time he had seen them was over 20 years old but he reserved himself from the expression of who he was by not identifying himself to them calling them my name he restrained himself it takes great discipline to do that not just hiding himself but restraining his emotions his feelings few people would be in that position and not feel something few people i am i have to and when i have to look at myself i wonder how i would have felt you wouldn't really know unless you walked the shoes that you put your foot in in his shoes you know if you were thrown into the well and soul into slavery and and all these things to confront the reality of yourself so let's go i don't want to take up too much time tonight i don't know if this is helping anybody and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and speak roughly unto them and he's telling them whence comey of course you know where they're coming from when you say once in other words where you're coming from and they sent from the land of canaan to buy food and the bible says again and joseph knew his virgin didn't he say in verse 7 so you know when the bible when his scripture repeats itself it it it it it enforces the so it's almost like he's been overwhelmed by the recognition with disabled brothers it's not like he forget them between verse seven and and and and and and and verse eighteen it is it what it means is the all the memories coming back and joseph knew his bridging but they knew him not and look at verse 9 for the first time and joseph remembered the dreams the memories coming back his story coming back humans as it is our nature to block from our memory unpleasant experiences it is a protective mechanism of the mind of the spirit we talk about reasoning and memory and conscience these are the the senses of the spirit it is it is natural for you to want to distance yourself from pain from suffering from situations that you you didn't feel good about you it was not pleasant so certain things about joseph experience he would have repressed and here it was as a rush as a as a as a flood it comes back to him and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them yeah spies to see the nakedness of the land here come so he accused his brothers you are spies you have come and he amplified with a malicious purpose to observe the undefended parts of our land no joseph knew them he knew who they were so what is joseph doing now joseph is trying he's testing he is going through his own emotions a lot is happening there at that point in time and they said unto him name my lord but to buy food are thy servants come we are all one man's sons we are true men or honest men thy servants are no spies in the amplified it actually says we are honest men your sins are not spies you can imagine the the trial to reconcile that statement we are honest man and joseph's saying i know i know i know what you did and he said unto them but to see the nakedness of the land you have come in other words to see the undefended part of the land and they said thy servants are 12 brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not so that one who is not they're talking about joseph you know what it is to be there being described being mentioned and let me tell you one is not you don't exist them ten i'm in front of joseph and tell him you existed on it they even realized and joseph said to them that is it that i speak unto you saying he has spies all they just can film it let's just confirm it hereby shall he be proved by the life of pharaoh you shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come here send one of you and let him fetch your brother and you shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies so if you say you're if all let's say all you're honest and only true bring your youngest brother to me and he put them all together into ward for three days which is in what is prison there you lock them up you get them out three days you know what see who that tree is ah yeah yeah yeah and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god if you be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison goyi carry corn for the famine of your houses so of course joseph know his father need food you know his family need food so you say let's leave one man here you wrestle all you go verse 20 but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and you shall not die and they did so verse 21 and they said to one another so no i don't know when last they had a family meeting you know finally things could be a delicate delicate thing i don't know when lies at a family meeting but this thing forced a family meeting and they said one to another earlier in this verse they were just looking at one another no at least they talking to one another they said one to another we are verily guilty they do an analysis they presented the evidence they sentence themselves and say we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that listen and this is where it gets painful in that we saw the anguish of his soul reading this is painful because they now are admitting that they saw the anguish of his soul so they saw the pain that joseph was going through and they still made a decision to let him go you see why god has to deal with them also in a certain kind of way i want us to wait because it's not just joseph being dealt with here these are the sons of jacob these are the tribes of israel we dealing with you know uh-huh so for the tribes of israel to be lined up effectively we have we read them in gideon oh this tribe is on a mountain this tribe is a water tribe these are all the tribes represented here and the issues in their lives have to come to before what was in darkness have to come to light the issues that need to be fixed need to be confronted and addressed because it can't move on the whole reason they're coming into egypt is because god do this to preserve life to preserve the life of judah and the lion of judah but also to preserve his people the children of israel these are the children of israel now admitting because of the situation we messed up we didn't deal with it right we saw the anguish we saw the pain we saw the situation and we still let it go this is god dealing with the tribes of israel i wanted to see it here because if the foundation is not right the building can never hold so god has to deal with these men who would be the patriarchs as it were of all the descendants that would come from the line of israel and they said to one another verse 21 we are verily guilty truly we are guilty in the amplified regarding our brother joseph i'm reading from the afterlife because we saw the distress and anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us believe it is not ask plead it is not oh god oh carry me pleaded is is a level of desperation plea were to let him go yet we would not listen and you have to fight to his cry so his distress and anguish has come on us what a reconciliation that he has to deal with what a what a personal experience all of these men have to come to terms with it would not be surprising if they themselves had repressed the pain they caused he says we're going real g piano it is not unlikely that over the course of the last 20 years they wouldn't have had moments not just of regret of their actions but of the pain across their father jacob jacob was never the same when joseph was taken it was not something that jacob took lightly and he himself had said he would go to his grave with this situation so it is not as if they could have just left it so they would have had to put up protective measures around their mind and heart and situation because of this thing but here it was with the way they are being treated in egypt it all come 34 it all surfaces verse 22 and reuben answered them do you remember her reuben we studied it last week reuben has said i'm saying speak i not unto you wasn't it i say do not sin against this child out of all that i wonder how reuben would have felt after year one year two year three because he was going to say let us not kill this boy they wanted to kill him you know and reuben answered them saying speak i not unto you saying do not sin against a child and you were not here therefore behold also his blood also his blood is required now listen to the paradox of the situation here now this is unfolding yeah bear in mind they had the encounter with joseph in the throne room joseph pass judgment give them our three days get them out of the weekend in jail clear their heads over think about it whether spies or whatever and now he releasing them and they are talking and and check this verse 23 and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter so it is now coming out to us that joseph's interaction with them all along was through his interpreter and they didn't realize that joseph who zafnat paneer would be his name to them was actually understanding what they were saying and in hearing their conversation this almost king second only to pharaoh driver of the second chariot wife husband of asana father of manasseh and ephraim the man who says who go go who come come look at verse 24 and he turned himself about from them and wept hearing the conversation hearing the remorse hearing the regret hearing the honesty hearing the words of these brothers who he up until this point he didn't know where they stood but hearing them without them knowing he was hearing they were not speaking to catch his attention they didn't know who he was nor expect them to understand their language but he recognized something changed he turned himself about from them so in the amplified he turned away from his brothers and left the room and wept that's a kind of weeping it's a hard to describe weapon i can't even describe it i can't put words into this i try to wrap my mind around what emotions joseph was going through started in egypt as a slave now he there's nothing else he could possibly want again and seeing this brings back the rush of memories the rush of pain the agony the despair the sadness maybe he felt a tinge of regret there's a love for his brothers that it's impossible sometimes no matter what your brother do you you know you still love them all of that weeping is an emotion when words no longer could be used to express what you feel sometimes you try to put things into words and and only sounds come out because words can't capture what you feel they can't that's why when a baby cries it's because they can't express what they feel they don't know how to put it into words sometimes they go to praying sometimes they go to tiring before the lord and and you find yourself crying about a situation because you don't even know how to tell the lord what you need him and the situation we don't know what jesus was going through but it was overwhelming enough for him that he had to walk away turn his back leave the room close the door and cry unlike great men great leaders decision makers those who are expected to rise above the situation the bible says and return to them again obviously he would have dried his tears composed himself lifted himself out of that refrain this mind to deal with him again because as a leader you can't show that kind of weakness sometimes you can't show the time when you're you'll move away from the crowd to deal with your personal issues your personal feelings anybody with me tonight this is real now we still in this one chapter here you know dealing with the expectation of those around you and we'll see later on i don't know if you'll get it today or not because this was not the only time he would cry with emotion later on the bible said he cried so much the whole house of pharaoh him clearly it meant the issues he locked up and he protected and he hid all his time it was a lot for him to deal with verse 24 and he turned himself about for them and wept and returned to them again and the bible now switched the word a little bit the subtle subtle switch here and communed with them commune is different from talk communed means that there's a change a switch just took place in joseph's perception of his brothers that private moment when he cried something clicked on the inside and he adjusted his position with them communing we talk about communion communities are talking computing is is it brings a level of relationship into the conversation and commute with them and still and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes i want us to see the two sides of this he bound simeon we know why he's doing it because he wants benjamin to come but now think of simeon simeon is experienced being bound simeon can now give a testimony of what it was like to be bound in egypt he could identify a bit more he could have more empathy more understanding of what joseph would have gone through his other brothers who were not bound go through a second period of dealing with now with uncertainty the first they caused this one they didn't cause the first they were part of now they are witnesses too anybody with me so i want us to understand how this whole thing unfolds here right bound them before their eyes that that is struck in a certain way for us to understand that joseph didn't take semen away from them and they didn't see it they are witnessing this so for them it's a second brother being tied up like i said the first one they were part of here they have no control and there's many in this story of situation we could control and those that we cannot control joseph was taken against his control in the first situation those brothers felt they were in control now they understand what they should not be in control they were powerless they were in another man's land they were in another man's castle they know after what it feels like when decisions are made about your destiny or the destiny of your family and you have no say no influence no power to make a difference is this helping anybody i hope this give you some insight here tonight right verse 25 then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn in other words he's selling food with them making sure he wants to make sure they get food here he ain't playing that after all he said and done daddy home nothing could separate his love for his father or his father's love for him is a type of god's love for us and our love for the father commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every man's money into his sock in other words you say their money not good here their money not good you know you have people you have people they are going to eat i think i said your money you're good you're away listen no you're not good do you say i can't take the money and to restore every man money in his sack and to give them provision for the way so he give them the food they came for put back the money they came to pay for the goods put it back in the sack he had to let me there he just put it in the sack and he gave them food for them to eat on the road so they'd have to cook they could just eat on the way home and thus did he unto them and they laid the asses with the corn and the parted vents and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provinda in the inn in other words to feed it he aspired his money you see the money in there and he behold it was in his sacks moat and he said until his bedroom my money is restored and lo it is even in my suck and their heart feel them well this is one of the only this is one of the unique scriptures where money is restored and manhattan feeling normally when money restored is that is that jubilant exciting time isn't that say even if i sack the money so and his heart failed he said this is the first time where more money is a bigger problem and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god had done unto us because as far as they see this is judgment upon judgment upon this is all they're not reaping they see they sowed 20 plus years ago coming back to them in a wave after wave after wave verse 29 and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that we fell at them saying the man who is the lord of the land speak roughly to us these big hard black men come home and say the man who is the lord of the land speak roughly to us and took us for spies of the country and we said unto them we are true men we are honest men we are no spies we be 12 brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this deal with our father in the land of canaan and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby said i know that you are true men leave one of your bridging here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone and bring your youngest brother unto me well you can imagine jacob at this point somebody say hold up hold up hold up where what what what hold up hold up hold up i was going dong with you over the road with here but not my benjamin not no no no no and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that he are no spies but that he are true men so will i deliver you your brother and you shall traffic in the land and it came to pass as they empty their sacks that behold every man's bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid they plural even jacob and jacob their father said unto them me have he be read of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and he will take benjamin away all these things are against me now you see how as a father he is processing this thing here and reuben speak unto his father saying slay my two sons so this is like parts of scripture where i try to figure out you know that you know something there are people who try to bring solutions and you look at them and be like get just go order room you know they say when they brainstorm in all ideas play it on a table there some people will be like we brainstorm and leave him audio room and reuben speaking if i'm saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to be how'd that solve any problem how exactly is that solving the problem at hand kill my two sons if i bring him up today deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again reuben's saying if i go down with benjamin i do i don't bring mark benjamin kill my two sons that making sense but i have to give rubella at least a for effort he's trying none of the other ones at least offer any kind of solution ruben didn't make no sense but at least he tried he had an idea it's better to have a idea that is a bad idea and no idea at all so reuben at least had an idea he said if i go with benjamin and benjamin do not come back kill my two sons and that will solve the problem jacob made up his mind he said verse 38 and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mister befall him by the way in which you go then shall he bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to be grieved all right so in the amplified it says but jacob said my son shall not go down to egypt with you for his brother's dead meaning joseph and he alone is left of rachel's children remember jacob and rachel so this is only two children rachel had so i don't lose one i'm not losing this one if any harm or accident should happen to him on the journey you are taken then you will bring my gray hair down to sure you're placing that in sorrow right so could we take a little more could we just go into in the verse 43 so again verse 43 verse 42 ends with jacob making up his mind that he's not going we're not going we're not going benjamin not going we're not going we're not going but then verse 43 starts with the famine was sore in the land in other words crisis intensifies in other words the situation gets worse so you can't just you have to re-evaluate your position you know you have people who who who make a decision i ain't changing my mind i change my mind in my mind well sometimes it will come in life you have to change your mind and the famine was so in the land you have to re-evaluate the situation and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn corn is done which they had brought out of egypt their father said to them go again buy us a little food this is now jacob realizing that again if this is like the beginning of 42 if we take no action all are we including benjamin everybody did and judah speaking i'm saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying you shall not see my face except your brother be with you so judah is saying the man tell us if we coming back we better bring our brother so this idea you have unless you're willing to change your mind this is not going to happen judah is saying now if god will send our brother with us we will go down and buy the food verse 5 but if god will not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us you shall not see my face except your brother be with you look at verse six so it's a lot at play here now this is we don't know how much time passed but you know when you're going back to situations and i say why why are your moves so here here here here jacob now israel and isn't it wherefore dead he's so ill with me as a telling man whether you had yet a brother so jacob now go on back in time and rewind and let me read any amplified so he seeker he said and israel jacob said why you treat me so badly by telling the man that you had another brother and they have another in italics as in to emphasize is another brother so in other words why would they open on their mouth and talk if they just go down there and buy the food and come back home and i'll talk all this talk we wouldn't be going through this all i go back and forth back and forth bringing food i don't have the stress why are they open all about verse seven and they said the man asked us straightly of our state and of our kindred so now we are getting pieces in verse 43 of the conversation from from chapter from we're getting pieces in chapter 43 of the conversation that took place in chapter 42 that moses knows how to give some clarity to the nature of the conversation the man asked us strictly of our state and our kindred saying is your father yet alive it's not the kind of question that someone would ask have he another brother because he knows ten he knew benjamin benjamin was a little younger than him there so it is natural interest and the question would have been genuine question so so these brothers would not think any malicious thing about it you know have you another brother and we told him according to the tenor tenor of those words is is to speak to the tone the quality the nature of the questions it was it was genuine question of genuine interest so it came to us he was asking genuine questions about us so we answered there was no reason to think he wanted anything malicious look what he said could we could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down so this is jacob's still dealing it's an argument in the aussie you know if what i did shut up i'll not have to deal with this but daddy the man was asking us nice questions if we found our life if you have an ex-brother i mean the way he asks the question i don't think he's going to ask me to bring you down don't get vex with us and judah said unto israel's father send the lad with me verse 8 and we will arise and go that we may live so judah for the first time now bring in a level of context now you remember that when we were speaking about joseph the story of judah and timah was slid in there and i was saying that because of the importance of judah out of all the sons of jacob he is a unique son because out of judah is the lion of the tribe of judah so judah himself has a special role a special transition judah was also the one who said send him down to egypt so he has to know get recalibrated he has to now speak differently he has to have a change in nature to be worthy to be out of the alignment of judah right so here judah now begins to reposition out of all the brothers reuben had a brilliant idea kill my two boys but now judah coming now with a whole different positioning and judas is telling the israelites father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and dao and also our little ones i will be surety for him of my hand shall do require him if i bring him not unto me and set him before thee then let me bear the blame forever so judah is saying i am willing to take full responsibility full responsibility is a manager's situation here it is judah is now actually beginning to to to show signs of undoing what he did earlier he has now taken responsibility for restoration not even understanding the role he is playing in restoration right verse 10 for except we had lingered with the skeptics here for if we are not in the amplified support if we had not delayed like this surely by now we would have returned the second time so judaism we don't have time to waste let us stop this argument because the more time we spend talking about talking about this it just makes it worse for us so a decision has to be made very practical very pointed except we had lingered solely now we would have returned the second time in other words if we had acted when we should have acted and carried benjamin back we would already have food eating right now all right and their father israel said unto them if it must be so so he took judah's advice and it's it's powerful this is a father the same father who had to light fire on them in the beginning of 42 is not being presented with arguments to make him change his position so i tell people all the time listen if you want to present something to me that's a different direction explain it justify it make it make sense but you can't just say we want to do it because i want to do it so judah's argument was sound it was on point it came across with sincerity it came across with honesty we we're going to close soon so the father changed his position all right so the father is saying to them if it must be so now do this take up the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the manner present [Laughter] go along with a gift a little balm and a little honey spices and milk nuts and almonds now this here is wisdom in demonstration this is what judah and they might think about jacob in his in his maturity is thinking about how can we appease this how can i guarantee this thing how can i what else can i do that this thing could be as smooth as possible and verse 12 and take double money in your hand so judah is wearing everything and the money that was brought again in the amount of your sacks so that's double money plus the money that came back to you so that is three times the money you there is three portions of money you're going down to each of it carry it again in your hand per adventure it was an oversight take also your brother and her eyes go again unto the man and god almighty give you mercy before the man now it's so interesting that i keep calling him the man the man the man the man the man and they're talking about their brother and the son you know how sometimes people say they have a problem with the man they call the government the man they call this money man demanding man we're going for the man they call he boss the man and and here it is you don't understand that the man they dealing with here is the brother and the son so now you see how things may not appear as radia right and god almighty verse 14 give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon you imagine the the mental drew these brothers they don't understand what's going on they can't figure that one minute they have been accused of spies next minute they end prepared for a feast and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into joseph's house and the men were afraid naturally because they were brought into joseph's house and they said because of the money that was retaining our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us in other words he may seek an opportunity against us and fall upon us and take us for bond men and our asses so in other words you're going to take everything now i want us to catch what guilt makes you do because of their guilt because of their fear they are seeing in this situation what is not real we we're going to close it in a bit you see when you have a distorted perception of your of of of your reality you see things only from your own lenses joseph not trying to kill them jews are not trying to put them in prison those are not trying to make them slaves but they're dealing with their own issues and their own issues is creating a false reality i want us to see this there in this is all in their minds they are they have built a false story of what is happening a narrative that is not accurate because of their own personal issues you you you see this you see if you don't have the truth and the reality of the truth how you can make your own world a crazy messed up world by your own devices and your own imagination that's imagination run wild right there verse 19 and they came near to the steward of joseph's house and they communaled him at the dorby house commune here don't just mean to okay it's like they tried to pull him in the confidence listen listen also we came indeed the first time to buy food we did this i don't know we don't tell nobody they say but here it is we about to go to the house but before we go in the house and we get killed because we believe we don't get killed or two in prison so but you know we look like we could talk i just let you know we came the first time and we brought money and it came to pass when we came to the end that we opened our sacks and behold every man's money was an emotive sack our money and full weight and we have brought it again in our hand and the other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our socks and the man of the gate say he said peace be unto you fear not your god and the god of your father had given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them you imagine the emotions therefore i said no what going on and the man brought the men into joseph's house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses proven in other words he feed the animals and they made already the present and and they the men the brothers they made ready the present against joseph at noon for they heard they would eat bread there and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowled themselves to him to the earth again prophecy dream ministry being unfair and unveiling so josephine will watch and process all of this and he asks them of their welfare how are you doing how was he trip you see how you could be going to your own issues on somebody genuinely interested but in your mind you're like you want to kill me you know look how did you try to kill my this i don't know what to say so now you're measuring your words and said is your father well the old man of whom you speak is yet alive and the answer thy servant or father is in good health he's yet alive and they're bowed down their heads and made obesions so now fellas going through now every time they get to bow they're born these same brothers back in the beginning see we will never bow we never go bowl now we bought every two minutes they're boring we finally good brother good the family good the call is good everything good everything that is it but in obesity and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mother's son i wonder what emotion is going through him at this point in time because if that takes a supreme level of control and said is this your younger brother of whom you speak unto me and he said god be gracious and to be my son hallelujah i'm almost done could he take some more almost we almost trying to wrap up here i just wanna and joseph made his for his bowers they'd earn upon his brother in the amplified that's it and joseph hurried out of the room because his heart was deeply touched over his brother so this is the second encounter and this is even even more emotional than his experience when he heard him speaking about him and joseph made haste for his brother that you and a bunch brother and he sought where to weep lord help us so joseph is looking for a place to cry this is this is a lot you know this is this is human this is this is there's nothing against joseph we preached about joseph but this is the man going through the experience he now sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber this is like you're you're in a situation and you're you want to get away you don't want nobody to see this level you don't want to wait to see your vulnerability you don't want anybody to see how this has an effect on you and your and you're trying to find a place where you could get a loan away from everybody else and he entered his chamber and wept there i'm about to close and he washed his face why would he wash his face he doesn't want nobody to know he doesn't want but you know it still hurts it still hurts there's still pain there not just the pain of the past but the pain of the missed opportunities the pain of the relationship that should have been there that wasn't this was his brother the pain of the years that he and his brother could have spent together and they didn't the pain of eating christmas dinner together that didn't happen the pain of new year's greetings for 20 years that didn't happen all of this is there captured in that moment he washed his face and went out and refrained himself you hear me keep saying it takes a lot of control a lot of control verse 31 then he washed his face and came out and restraining himself that's the amplified said let the meal be served we all have moments when we restrain ourselves we all have moments when we don't want nobody to see the vulnerability of our lives whatever situation it is here it is nothing against joseph i'm getting ready to close out here and they set on for him by himself verse 32 in the amplified so the servant served joseph by himself in honor of his rank in other words joseph didn't at that point he can even eat with him he eat by himself maybe he didn't have the strength to sit with them to eat maybe he didn't want to break down again but just he thought that they were fine and they were there his father was fine the family was there and they were in the same room was enough sometimes that's just enough to know that they're okay and they set on him set on for him by himself and for them by themselves in the amplified i'm getting ready to close so the servant served joseph by himself in honor of his rank and his brothers by themselves and the egyptians who ate by with them by themselves because according to customs the egyptians could not eat food with the hebrews for that is load some to the egyptians so it still gives you the context of all that is happening there and they sat before him the first born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his ute and the men marveled at one another marveled at one another because they couldn't understand they couldn't figure out what is going on so understand this as well so understand what is happening so now joseph brother was seated by the stuart in the amplified because it's it's something easy to miss this so joseph stewart basically placed the sons of jacob in order of age around the table so they were marveling at how the stuart would know who is first born to who is youngest in exact order i want us to understand what that's saying there in scripture so them them fellas going through a real real real experience and they sat before him the first born of contest but right and the youngest according to is youth and the men marvel at one another in the amber fight in the order of their birth all right and he took and sent messes unto them messes mess hallel senior army toward so he told the portion of food and joseph selected and sent portions to them from his own table but benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of this five times only seen that and he took a certain on them from before him but benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of this and they drank and will marry with him so that brother come and it's five times his grace grace grace says you know so that's it for tonight let's just bow here with our prayer our heavenly father lord we thank you tonight lord for the magnitude lord of this simple bible story as it were lord and how we can see so much in our own lives lord and how you put it all here in the word in scripture these subtle messages that we could look now in 2021 and see how much order how much of the story the emotions the the elements of it that you you have kept here that we can look at it and see what each person is going through and how you were working your way out and how you were dealing with each one and dealing with their lives and lord how you are so interested in how everything lord took place and how you are so interested in us and our lives in our family situations and our situations and and what we go through and and how we can be so sensitive and to see two expressions of joseph restraining himself lord some of us given the opportunity where we were down and we now in power we would take the opportunity to just retaliate and respond but we see joseph who he didn't retaliate he didn't have a negative response he is working towards reconciliation he is able to to deal with it and and and still be vulnerable and manage his vulnerability help us lord in our situation with our homes our families our loved ones our businesses our co-workers employees whatever it might be that we could exemplify these traits these qualities these characteristics lord of your nature your prophet taught us that it was jesus living through noah living through moses living through joseph all of these are signs of your attributes that you allowed to be displayed lord because you were so awesome you were so great that no prophet could have even exemplified all of who you were until jesus came unto it father so we thank you lord for these examples in the word that we could see how you were placing yourself for us as the prophet said if we read the bible and don't see jesus in every verse we need to read it again so we thank you for your wisdom and your understanding and your love for us lord that we can be better
