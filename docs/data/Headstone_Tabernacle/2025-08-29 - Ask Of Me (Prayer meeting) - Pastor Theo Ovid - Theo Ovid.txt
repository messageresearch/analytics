Lord, unlock this door of blessings and deliverance and breakthrough in prayer. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you and welcome tonight. And we are grateful to be here tonight by God's grace. I'm looking forward to see what the Lord will do tonight. Amen. Praise the Lord. Just one second. So tonight I want to go in a scripture of Psalms 2. There's three words I want to pull out from there of Psalms 2. We want to get a context and this scripture is speaking about Jesus but it's something I want to pull out from there. Psalms 2 if you have your Bibles to Psalms 2. Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take council together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, "Let us break their advance asunder and cast away their cause from us. He that sitth in the heaven shall laugh. The Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak into them in his wrath, and vex them in his sword displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill on Zion. I will declare the decree the Lord had said unto me, thou art my son, speaking about Jesus, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, speaking to his son, asks of me and I will give thee the heen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of an iron. Thou shalt dash them in pieces with a potter's vessel. So the three words I want to pull out there from verse 8, ask of me. And that's the title of the exaltation tonight. Ask of me. We'll see what the Lord will do. Praise God. Now God has placed prayer as a channel to receive what he has already given as yours. And even though it is given to you, it must be requested or you must ask. Even though the inheritance is promised, you have to ask for it. This is Paul's blessings and commendation to the church in Acts 20:32. And now, brethren, this is Paul, I commend you to God to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified. So, inheritance is something that is God-given. You don't earn it. You don't make it up. It's an unconditional covenant that God has made with his people. And this came from Genesis 12 when God tell Abraham to come out of his country and I will bless them that bless thee. I'll make thee great. I'll just skip quickly. So Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken and unto him and Lot went with him and Abraham was 75 years old. And then this is the part verse 7. And the Lord appeared unto Abraham, and said, unto thy seed will I give this land, and dear buildeth he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him. So we know, and Baram will explain it with Adam, if you will, if you do, I will do and so on like that. But this covenant was an unconditional covenant that we could have an effective applied faith and trust in God that he can't lie and he can't make a promise that he can't keep and every promise that he make made has to be fulfilled. Isn't that right? So God must come and honor his promises. Bam said this here. Now there are two covenants. One of them is the Adam covenant. God made a covenant with the man. If you will, I will. and he broke it. Then God made a covenant with Noah and it was the Noah covenant and it was broke. Now he's making the Abrahamic covenant. And the Abrahamic covenant according to the Genesis 12th chapter is given me unconditionally. It's eternal. It's unconditional. Not if you will, I will. He said I have. I already done it. Not I will do it. I have done it. That bases fate. God is determined to save man. He made a covenant. If you will, I will. He break it. Another one. You will, I will. He broke it. Man can't keep his covenant. So God saves man by his grace under a covenant that is unconditional, never ending. That's all there is to it. Three, perfect. Noah, um, Adam, Noah, Abraham. And that's the reason, Here we go. We are Abraham's children. That covenant cannot end never end because it's unconditional. Not because you choose God is God choose you. Not because you do something is because of God did something. So therefore God here we go. I'm saying this God is showing himself as the source of the blessings and inheritance. We cannot conquer in our own strength. So therefore in asking him and ask of him like you say ask of me we are showing our dependence on him and listen he wants that asking is also a reflection of the relationship we have with him. I want you to think about you can't just go up to a stranger and just ask them stuff and you know there has to be a connection a relations and then you feel comfortable to ask that person something like that James 4 2 and 3 said you lust and have not he and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and war yet he have not because he acts not so you don't have because you're not asking maybe you think God tired Maybe you think that you know you ask so much already. But James is saying you have not because you ask not. And you ask and receive not because you ask amidst that he may consume it upon your lust. Leviticus 20:24 says, "But I've said unto you," God speaks it, "Ye shall inherit their land, their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that flowth with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God, which have separate you from other people." So prayer is a mean or a key or a tool by which we could ask for our inheritance. God gives what he wants us to ask. I hope this resonate with you tonight. So you cannot sit there like dumb dumb and don't ask. God gives but he want us to ask. He put into place that certain things can only be accessed through prayer. That is how he set it up. Ask of me means that the inheritance is not automatic. It's a promise. Yes. That must be how to say it that you put on the switch. In fact, you flick a switch in your acts in prayer. Ask of me and I will give thee the heen for thy inheritance and the uttermost part of the earth. All right. Now see I want to talk about Caleb. Joshua 14 is a familiar scripture. Then the children of Judah came to Joshua and ga Caleb the son of Jeffa Kzanite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me in Keshbania. So Caleb is going back 40 plus years to remind Joshua of what was spoken to him what was belonging to him what was what was given to him. 40 years old when I was with Moses servant of the Lord sent me from Kenishes Bani to estar the land. I brought him word as was in my heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt like holy for the Lord. And he went on to say, and Moses swear on that day, saying, Surely the land thereof there on thy feet have trodden shall be the inheritance, and thy children forever because thou was holy followed the Lord thou God. Now therefore, behold, the Lord have kept me alive as he had said. Verse 11, as I'm just as strong as I was. Verse 12. Now therefore, there's a part give me this mountain. Note that uh Caleb stepped out as an individual and asks for his. Therefore, the Lord spake in that day, for thou heardest um that the Anakim were there. And so, if the Lord be with me, I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord had said. And Joshua blessed him and give unto Caleb the son of Jeffina Hebron for an inheritance. So it was his inheritance. It was given to him. But he can't just mime it and and think it in the head or think it in the head. He had to ask it. God Caleb remembered what was promised to him all those years before. Caleb did not say quiet. He didn't say silent. And church I believe and I'll get a message on it that each one of us have to come into that position to say give me my mountain. You cannot say that if your life messed up. You cannot say that if you don't have faith. You cannot say that if you don't have a right standing with God. God want you to be in a certain standing that you could be strong enough to step forward. They say what I want. What is mine? What Jesus died for. I want that. So I want to take the next one. I share this with my wife and this one just love this one. This is the daughter of Zillopath. Don't I don't know if I get that pronunciation right. This is from numbers chapter 27 verse 1-8. I love these sisters here. They then came the daughters of Zilofad. Numbers 27:E1 the son of Hea the son of Gilead the son of Mashe the son of and and all and and these are the names of his daughters Mala Noah Hogla Mila and Tisha. And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the princes of all the congregation by the drove the tabernacle of the congregation saying our father died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered them to get themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora. But he died in his own sin and had no sons. Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he had no son? Give us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. So these sisters were making a claim and they were presenting it to Moses and asking for inheritance from their father who died who didn't uh line up with Kora and data and all characters. And Moses, here we go. Verse 5, brought their cause before the Lord. And the Lord said unto Moses, Oh, this is beautiful. The daughters of Zilofad, speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren. Thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to be passed onto them. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die and have no son, then he shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. What if those daughters just said, "Well, my father dead, you know, and take it like that." No, they said inheritance. That is how I want you to speak. That is what I want you to see. Sometime in the messages to come, we'll get on into it. Another one we have is Elisha. 2 Kings 2:510. Want to finish quickly. We know the story. I want to get just the end part. And the sons of the prophets were at Jericho came to Elisha and said, "No, you not. Your your master will be taken from your head today." He said, "Yeah, I know it. Hold your peace." So Elisha is coming down to that fine line of where he has to know what he wants. And Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray here, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. He said, "As the Lord liveth, as I saw liveth, I will not leave thee." And they too went on. 50 men of the son of the prophets went stood a view to a far off, and they two stood by Jordan. And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together, smoked the waters, and they were divided hidden and thither, and they two went on over dry ground. And it came to pass when they were gone over. Note that Elijah never asked this question before. He passed through Bethl, Jericho, Jordan. Now he asked this. And Elijah said to him to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for you." You're following me. What you want me to do for you before I be taken away from thee? Elijah said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. note he had was to define and ask what he wanted and he said thou has had a had a had to have a a heart thing nevertheless if thou see me when I'm taken it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so so we see the program of God is even though you are destined for the mantle even though you are destined for whatever it is you still have to ask and the final I want to bring to you is from Mark 10 verse 46-52 and this is blind Athemus and I love this one 46 says and they came to Jericho and he went out of Jericho his disciples and a great number of people blind Batimus the son of Tamius sat by the highway side begging and when he heard it was Jesus of Nazareth he begin to cry out and say Jesus now oh son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that is and hold his peace. But he cried more a great deal, thou son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort. Rise, he calleth thee. And he casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, "This is the bomb." What Jesus ask everybody know he's blind. He could see he is blind. Jesus know the man is blind. So blindness is not the issue. What is the issue then? Hear what Jesus said. What will thou that I should do for thee? In other words, even though the Lord knew his condition, the Lord still wanted him to be clear. Define what is your need and what you want and ask for it. And the Bible continues, the blind man said unto him, Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, "Go thy way. Thy feet had made thee whole." And immediately he received his sight and follow Jesus in the way. I'll close. So Jesus knew his need yet required him to ask. His asking brought the restoration of his sight. What if the man stood there and say, "I don't know what to say now. I don't know what to say." Well, Jesus couldn't do anything for him because he's asking the question. And if Jesus is to come in here tonight and ask you that question, what is it that you want me to do for you tonight? What would you ask? So John 16 23 says, "And that day, at that day, in that day, you shall ask me nothing. Verily I say unto you, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you. Hitherto have you asked nothing in my name. Ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full. Ephesians 3:20 and we close. Now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. Just think about it. God is able to do above and beyond what you could even ask. And we are not asking as we should. The prophet said ask for big things. to great things. The devil job is not only to depress you and frustrate you, but to put a weight on your top lip that your top lip meet your bottom lip and you ask nothing. You grind through. You grumble through. You complain through. You open your lips and instead of praise is a complain. Instead of a worship, it's a negative something coming up. God doesn't want who do you imagine tonight in your house God coming to you and said what is it you want me to do for you? I brought a word for you tonight. Ask of me. You're not asking your uncle. You're not asking your wife, your husband, your children. Ask of me. He is the source of your strength. He is the one that brought you through all the years. You had successes. You had failures, but the source of your life has been him. He's the one that make you stagger out of this and stagger into that. You didn't bring yourself out. He brought you out. You didn't give yourself ability, he gave you ability. You didn't give yourself gifts. He gave you gifts. What are you doing with it? He said, "Ask of me." You have not because you're asking. Won't you ask tonight? Ask hard things. Don't pray the regular prayer. Do as if Jesus himself is asking that question to you personally tonight. What is it that you want me to do for you? Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight for these three words. Ask of me. We're not asking of a man. We asking of you. We asking of you for revival. We asking of you for deliverance. We asking of you for healing. We asking you for financial breakthrough, for spiritual breakthrough, for family breakthrough, for marital breakthrough. We are asking of you for revival to strike the church. Lord, we asking of you to stir up the people's spirit and to bring them out of lethargy and sluggness and slackness. Oh God, help us tonight. Lord, you said we don't ask enough. We don't ask for hard things. Oh God, won't you send down the capstone, the headstone? Would you send down that anointing that's that that you said the the the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost? You promise to pull dynamics in the mechanics. You promise a super church, a super race. Oh God, strengthen your people tonight. Heal the sick in our midst. Touch the heart cases. Father, we ask for your miracle working power to begin to work tonight. May we get testimony after testimony of testimony of deliverance, of breakthrough, of healing, of restoration, of forgiveness, of cleansing, of revival. Oh, Father, stir your people up tonight. May set their souls on fire that they'll have to share it with somebody. They'll have to testify to somebody. They'll have to let the steam out. Oh God, grant it tonight as they get on in prayer. May your presence be with them in a special way. Look over the homes, Lord of the family. Look over the elders, Father. All the senior ones, the grain ones with gray hair, Father, long in the vineyard. Give them a touch. Touch these Calebs, Father, tonight. Touch the young people tonight. Touch the believers tonight. Touch your church from the Oh, God, from the purple to the backbench. May your revival spirit begin to work tonight as they ask of you. May they not be lazy in asking. One thing they should not be lazy in asking. And they could knock on your door, Lord, and say, "Lord, I'm here again. I'm here again." You don't not even give us just inheritance, but you give us our families as an inheritance. Oh, God. Adam lost his life. He lost his inheritance in life. And here we are, Lord, looking for a full restoration. What they had in the beginning. You said alpha and omega. What the church had in the beginning is what they're going to have in the ending. You and your house shall be saved. That is what they had in the beginning. That is what they had in the book of Acts. Not you and not your house. You and your house. Regardless of what condition they in, we are believing you to make a work upon their hearts and lives to change and transform them. Father God, may as they get on in prayer, the angel of God pass by and give them a special touch tonight. In Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. So saints, I trust the Lord that this little session here will be a blessing to you, will help you and encourage you to know that God is still on the throne and he wants to bless you tonight. So God bless you as we get on in prayer. Praise the Lord. Amen. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat.

It says, "Hast thou not known?" Verse 28. "Hast thou not heard that the everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, faintth not? Neither is weary. There is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might. He increaseth strength. Even the youth shall be faint, and shall be faint and be weary, but the young man shall utterly fail. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount on the wings as eagles. They shall run not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. So I want to remind you that door God don't get weary. He actually give power to the faint. You're feeling distress. You're feeling faintish power is promised to you. He come to give strength to the weak. May God bless you. looking forward to see you on Sunday that you would, you know, be alive and to go on and to think that God called you to a high order in this hour to start revival right in your home, right in your heart, right in your life. And for three words, ask of me. Nobody could stop you asking of him. No man, no preacher, no bishop, no church. Ask of him and he will give you. Ask and you shall receive. May God bless you. Have a great weekend. God be with you.
