wanna remember those believers in Florida father God and all those ministers minister pastor Westco but a Jacke delft must mastered often but on the word Lord and loosen some name that we know and

the Bible prophesy now we're gonna see the beginning of Sorrows father god help us in this hour that we can be so prepared father and so being the spirit Lord and so being revival father that we can keep the fire burning where your places positionally here on this island far the best believers everywhere and as we got out on your word me a president be with us in a special way in GSM we ask it amen and amen you may be seated and as I said don't just give God some prizes [Applause] solely solely the presence of God is in this place when greetin's a man from Africa from Uganda and what a tremendous time we had meetings day in Uganda some of you may know some a minute no but but John Shakuni pastor who's pushed pastor he lost his wife with about a month and a half ago and he was testifying and saying that many people thought he would have canceled meetings but man he had real feet and God blessed him and God bless the meeting is in a powerful powerful way and sometime you you you have no idea what some of these believers and people who are true saving the Lord in their countries and so on and and because of the opportunity to travel that we see it in or now we see how God bless feet and sacrifice God just can't bless laziness and sloppiness and you know the best he bless feast and sacrifice and over 1500 believers and over 100 passes was there we have ministers from both Uganda and Kenya other parts of Africa that came to this meeting it was glorious mighty old point of the spirit there's one time where a John Condy was preaching and then that was preaching actually was talking a little bit before service all of a sudden I just got silent just silent I'm never see anything like that he had all said he never saw anything like that silent like you can hear a pin fold he said but it is silent and all of a sudden the holy speaking in the poro it's not it's not the work of man his God's work of a study and that's before scripture before it was ready so it's really powerful to see how the unity and the seedings coming together come into place and you have to have a heart for this it has to be in your heart whatever succumb to true to you it has to be in your heart you can't be hoping you have to have our divine revelation and I trust this morning that this word that we're gonna be speaking to you would touch your heart and speak to her you're appreciated by the Stephen last Sunday compressible diva but a Stephen get deliver I appreciate not service Amen praise the Lord him and his words but eyes that come behind him about hope they die about denying yourself that's what people find it so hard to do they want God to meet them at their level they don't want a competent was level you want to be as it are live as they are natural and everything must work out just as you wanted just as you desired I remember course wouldn't find no fight no problem no challenges and and that must be your life and what's a big fat no he said every Sun that cometh to God must be tested must be tried he said that you have no spoiled children we spoiled our my god don't have any spoiled children demon so this morning we want to stand and we want to change your of service and going to the word I want to turn our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11 wanna read from verse 1 to 6 Genesis chapter 22 verse 15 the 18 Matthew chapter 7 verse 24 to 29 when I greet all those who connected to us any Internet would far and wide or bless you we're happy to hear be here to serve amen reading Genesis Hebrews chapter 11 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by the elders obtained a good report to faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which will appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by a TBM dead yet speak at my feet Enoch was translated that he should not see death I was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Genesis chapter 22 verse 15 to 18 and the angel of the Lord called unto Abram out of him in the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and hast not withheld thy son and only son but in blessing I will bless thee and a multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven as a Sun which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and I seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou was obeyed my voice last scripture Matthew chapter 7 reading from verse 24 therefore whosoever here at these scenes of mine undo it now I would liken him unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be like likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it and I came to pass when Jesus had ended these scenes the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one of an authority another describes this ba has what's once more father we thank you for your word and any man could reach scriptures but it will take the Holy Spirit to breathe in it and reveal it father we pray your commandant reveal an anointing and spirit and reveal a word to your people that deliver with a rock and their soul a rock in their heart a rock of Revelation father come and confirm it with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name or pour your spirit upon your people this morning amen and amen you may be seated this morning 1/2 of a title because da was done this thing as a title because da has done this thing another an inspiration the angel is here to drive you back to the Tree of Life the engine is here to drive you back to the Tree of Life other context scripture I like to read now which is from Revelation chapter 4 and a trees after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as well trumpet talking with me which said come up hither I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the troll and he that sat was to look upon like Jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow rule about a troll in the cyclic on an emerald and wrong about it phone were fallen 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold out of the throne proceeded lightnings thunders thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto a Christian and a miss of the trone round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind first beast was like a lion second beast like a calf the two-piece had a face as a man the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four piece had each of them six wings about him they were full of eyes within and the rest not day and night saying holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and is to come and we find out that this book of Revelation we know is a book of symbols all the beasts and all the things that you're hearing is represent something it means something is not just idly placed here there's a purpose in every scripture every word that God speaks in that Bible okay here we go but a piranha from this is from Melchizedek Great Prince and King there are three elements that a man follows first is humanistic second is divine revelation and third is vision that is thus saith the Lord so the majority of humans walk in the earth follow the humanistic realm that's the realm of your five senses as a realm of your emotions and your feelings and this one hurts you and your trouble and everything else that just humanistic above that level is the realm of divine revelation so from a humanistic standpoint Sarah couldn't have a child from a natural standpoint Iran is too old but from a revelation standpoint Isaac is coming if he lives at the humanistic around he will doubt God he can't come to the spot to believe he will have that child but the Bible said abraham believed God to do that he had to jump over his humanistic [Applause] to believe in the divine revelation of what God said to him that he a mrs. shrine types could say God said so whatever piece you have God said so sorry I can't show you this but God said so unconcerned a man that would lie if God said it it's gonna come to pass then God said it it would materialize and God said he don't need no help to bring it to pass which realm are you following this morning hallelujah is only tree now your mother say or your father say or your uncle say your brother say or your grandmother say that's them saying what did God say well my feelings tell me and I feel so and I dream this last night I have nothing to do with that I want to know what God said I don't want to hear about your dream I don't want to hear what your feelings I don't want to hear what human spirit I don't worry about your emotions I want to hear what God said red sea in front mountains on both side zero coming behind I'm the people demanding what is going on Moses and mostly began to whimper and cry I'm going said why cry on to me speak and move our Moses back slipped and fell from faith into the human realm that walks it speaks it Leslie the Josh I lived I think look at the Lord a shout in the hood [Music] [Applause] uija somebody shouted now the human Instagram can't help you much Victor to live here I think this is a nice nice it is a feeling it's a feeling emotions affection and so on that's nice but to take beyond that they take a higher order you take a higher poll and that's the pull of divine revelation you see it again the third element is vision or IMAP Rinnegan the three elements that we put well in the first one is humanistic you like this ties the fashion in the world and think that I'm taking this one have that and it's all great and I'm a friend doing this and I want to do that too this one pulling you down one pulley I'll be a humanistic right and then the next one is revelation that's listen that's when something down in your heart anchors it and says it's going to happen then something good happen I remember and doing the government exams pastor get employment and you know they give you up the symptom to do the exams and so on and I know this girl know she study and study instead of my acting I did a few sun-filled but I didn't do it each time that she did it and something tell me I'm gonna pass this time and what I study is what come what she study did not come but I had faith in my heart that I was going to succeed and and I did that was something else it was almost like a phrase like a revelation that I'm gonna get true so I'm not coward at what I study I had to believe that what I am studying right now this coming in the people so it's not that I was I'm not gonna study and with the study a little thing before the exam and what that little thing that come don't do bond you know my study with go take a test and that totally matches vision which is the word of the Lord mid manifests when you see it and it's thus saith the Lord that's like what a bird but a primary matter when he was India thinking was India and some blind man or something like that only brought him forth and honey Lord showed nothing to be healed and he said if this man how much will give this life to Jesus Christ if this is what openness I said the blind man worship in his son and go opening Isaac Langman that was the said the Lord get a vision it couldn't feel and so on so that's the three elements it's not right the tail is vision that is the seer the Lord that is perfect that is positive and a frequent of vision isn't that right now back in Genesis everything started in the beginning there were two boys keen and evil not ten - two boys and God invite them to worship she may get is quickly the other fine I'll read it and in the process of time this is Genesis chapter 4 it came to pass that Cain brought forth the fruit of the ground as an offering unto the Lord and Abel also brought for the first of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering under the Cain and his offering he had not respect and kin was very wrong his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why I thought why I had thy countenance for if thou doest well shalt thou be accepted and if thou doest not well sin line at the door and under deed shall be his desire thou shall rule over him and yeah we know the story can come and kill evil but God actually challenged him to come to the altar to make the offering one bring fruits of his interpretation on the other wonders take a lamb and kill it and that blood come out and God says send fire upon that offering and vindicated Abel's offering and that's why I read the script by faith Abel offered a sacrifice which God confirmed that he was righteous because he break into a realm where it wasn't his ability or worked or laboring in the field and planting and reaping it was a lamb he took a blood something that struck him isn't that right it was revealed him so but a Branham says those boys after seeing that been made mortal and was going to die here we go they tried to find favor with God the poor come making a sacrifice and if God only required religion then Cain was justified Kilmer's just as believing as evil believe king came with a sacrifice just as he became a sacrifice but Cain's sacrifice was by works he raised his garden he brought his fruit the best he could find but Abel was justified by faith because he come with a loud Oh could we give God praises for that hallelujah praise the name of the Lord watch now when Kane came and knelt down and built an altar our imagined they come to the east side of the gate and there is where the angel stood with his flaming sword remember what happened when they got run over God neither the angels were stayed with flaming sword to God The Tree of Life that man in that tradition wouldn't my take of the Tree of Life and I've eaten alive in that terrible condition so the angel was sent to guard it the block man from beating about it isn't that right so watch the angel stood with his flaming sword garden the Tree of Life by the way he was guarding the people away from the tree of life but now he is trying to drive the people back to the Tree of Life I do know the sea of life is right that's Jesus Christ isn't that right now Jesus was our tree of life the woman was the tree of debt we are the fruit of our mother she was the fruit tree my woman come dead and my woman come life which is true marry virgin born is not right but I please not to die but the man born of the Spirit of God never dies going to church making a sacrifice worshiping God if that's all that God requires he will be cruel to condemn a man that met that requirement but you see there's a way that seems right unto a man but the end thereof is that there's a way that God comes and that's the only way you are ever going to get there are you listening to me praise God that's the only way you're gonna get there no there is a way that go-go-go and will you and there's a way Lacroix provide for you and the whole Bible is built upon Revelation the entire Bible so when you come to church you already come to get in the spirit I'm not just getting information if it's human read information but when you come to church you get an opportunity for the Spirit to come upon you this information and transform it into revelation then it's not information to you it's reveal to you then you can worship then they could shout then you could bring your offering to the altar then fire to fall upon you listen is already the substance of what you're hoping for it's not yet but you believe it will be that's revelation it's not yet but you believe it will be you believe God bless you it's not yet what you believe it will be didn't come and hear you it's not yet but you believe it baby [Applause] so Jesus oxys cuspid fishermen these men natural men we call following a man's who do men say I am you see some men say you're this immense fear that his who do you say I am and they got caught they didn't know who he was over sudden Peter Brook or Dumbledore Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus said flesh and blood didn't reveal that unto you but my father and he has not revealed unto you on upon this rock I will build my church not some church building my church I'm the cases I will never prevail against said it means once that rock that's why you get back up [Applause] [Music] halleluyah halleluyah that's why you're

can't build a church upon sensation you can't bill it nothing else but Christ which is the revelation of Jesus Christ question do you have a revelation of Jesus Christ that's what you need to have if you don't have Jesus Christ you will see there's a man standing up there any tiny pulpit and you see in things that we are taking what I want like if it's a buffet-style and you don't want that giving

words like a wise man who blows up on a rock because why the rains are coming the storms are coming he says long as there is no storms houses with lines the one his son and one a rough-looking very nice some time he wanted his son being better and have a better roof the roof is more expensive but it is built on sand and it's not tested yet so have parties they have investment pool dia but it's built on my son and he storm I come yet well as long as there's no stone is the best hopes and it's a treat like a snowstorm but storm coming it always does 50% say Amen that's all right the rest will have to say Amen I'm begging you it's just the truth and I can't live here because it wouldn't set you free if the truth will set you free say if you're strong rich yet it's coming 25% say you think Florida acts for the storm you think for let's say Brit storm come on bring it on no it's just coming I mean if a storm is coming you make preparation he'll stay and hang out or get out some people say they're staying in the boat some people staying in the house some people are l believe I need celebrate that foolish because the warning is for purpose you could lose your house made you want to lose your life say they said get out get out more than a million people most people will get a note knock about the Holy Trinity empty node could you imagine that this is storm coming everybody get out - wait so butter brown you read this scripture and let's go further Jesus was speaking here and the messages you'll be coming strong about the coming storm here we go are you ready which has got to strike every man every woman that's born in the world there is no way out of it the storm will strike you sometime another and depends on what kind of foundation you have whether your house will wear it or not many lives have been saved because of preparation for storms the many of life's lost because of failing to take heed to the warning of storms that's coming along ago a story had my believers in Florida they had great storm sweep to Florida typhoons off the sea big blocks into the city she's out everything I could stop down preach for our surges today all we know is that we have got an uncommon storm and the only woman I know can turn that storm have to be a Russian women that fell in their Pentacles he's a stockman acacho beach news in florida and there was a neighbor man who kept in contact with radio because of these storms he was a very non-christian he heard great typhoon was coming that way twisted on trees and everyone was warned to get to safety he thought of his neighbor who had a chicken farm has some like buildings with your chickens in there through the houses so for hens and they had in and his life was tied up with them chickens for a living he was quickly frantically up to the gate and stopped his car jump or said to the fellow take all the chickens put them in your storm shelter you rushed over to mine because there's coming a typhoon our storm they're gonna twist everything down like what he shared with his neighbor the man stood looking at her face and laugh at him he's in nonsense I have heard them predict such a thing before and they never have and the Christian neighbor was so excited he said but what if it does happen we here we must like along the line I've heard of this great happen and I was gonna happen and as gonna happen in these days but it behooves us to listen to every warning but this man said I will time for those foolishness I raise chickens I have no time for some cried out the neighbor said in the name of God Lido's chicken alone John come quickly you and your family if you don't want to believe it let your family come he said I will not have my children to be excited over a few reader warnings Mike you and I have decided we will live as I live my wife will listen to me because I am the breadwinner of this whole and she must listen to me I am the boss here and I will not have my children all excited to talk about some nonsense and the neighbor Tim he went to his home into his shelter all of a sudden the cloud was upon him before he knew it that's the way judgement strikes it comes so sudden you wonder how we can get there so quickly how I have seen cruel men who once Chris God fallen scream and say how could you treat me this way the holes Foundation swept out from under him in a moment it pays to take warning you might laugh at the messenger you might be able even be able to kill him but you cannot kill the message it will go on just the same why the storm struck the country it caught the chicken house the farmer they never found his body his wife frantically frightened they left close to the great Okeechobee leak and the waters began to rise is a typhoon lifted waters all the way from the bottom of the lake and that's what makes it so dangerous the boats rock how the waves come up and turn the boats beneath them the storm come up swirl picks them up for miles the water is sweeping until the mother lode it was no hope better get a chair into the top of the building she got to the top of the building with the children poor longer the chimney of the house and the wildlife the cottonmouth moccasin I believe I'm what deadly snake than your Diamondback rattler they were calling for safety and they caught up on the roof also with her and by listening to her husband listen carefully by listening to a husband not taking heed to the warning so this is not a family warning this is an individual warning that's not a wee thing removing show missus to the individual [Music] hallelujah and by listening to her husband not take heed to the warning she stumped she beat she had to stand on what was officious snakebites her children until they died on the roof and the mother herself was bitten so much until she died and that's the only way we got the story after the storm acquired and search parties hundred four buddies the fungal lien on the top of the roof with a cheering limb by a sigh it peers to take warning the first thing to do before they can be a warning they had to be a preparation made for safety so what did tell em in Florida there is a safety please leave your house and get the deal it's a food there enough that day you know whatever it is the structure could withstand the storm go dear so before port could give a warning they have to be a safe place isn't that right and the warning is only a voice of one Avenue to prepare for the danger there has to be a preparation made first and if the preparation is made then the warning can go forward to cause you to make a decision because that was done this thing the warning challenge review to make a decision life is about decisions about actions about what people do isn't that right Court has the same method whether you listen to it or not if you don't want to listen to it up that's up to you if you risk it there is safety Jesus see if you don't listen and do what he says you're fool the foolish man if you listen to do what he said you're wise person that's the problem today about young people don't want to listen you want to do the only thing you got a field a fruit on the side of energy in their side of time on the side you don't have that you have that boat on your side so God has the same method we work on God's method in that way Gordon the early days when the people got so wicked God could not look upon it he has laws when those laws are broken has no penalty there is no law the reason that there is a law in hostile penalty phase to be a law if there is no penalty there is no law just do it on your Brickley right like there's no charge it's not ticket to go over speed there's no ticket there's no no law then everybody do the own thing but the reason is how a penalty it has a law however the law was a penalty there surprise isn't alright watch so any Lord has broken hospitality is in the law you cannot break the laws of go around without having to pay for it somewhere you must do it be sure your sins don't find you out the only to watch so therefore many people think smoking cigar is a sin it isn't many birthing that lying is a sin isn't committed adultery isn't a sin these are attributes of unbelief there are only two things either you believe or your unbeliever if you believe you don't do this thing so when you are born you are born from above and you have the Holy Spirit coming down from God listen that changes your nature no matter your sister your mother your best friend could be dressed that way but the Christian has born of the Spirit God is born from above their spirit is of another Kingdom you are ruled or governed from above your influences even your hairstyle is from above it interest is not what Hollywood have your clothing is that interests my Hollywood its influence from above isn't that right I'm so glad the simpleness of the Holy Spirit to follow it watch it how it behaves and makes you believe now here we go the Holy Spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself another so that's why it's so flimsy when people say I don't believe it like how you see it I see it so I see it so when you look at the life and a behavior no behavior so their their behavior come to our doctrine or teaching but that's not right that's like what a Branham said I prefer somebody right in spirit and long and doctrine that to be wrong and spirit and right in doctrine if you're right in spirit you could be helped you could be spoken to you can be corrected you can be rebuked you could be instructed you could be guided godwyn around because your hood or beard my voice because you have obeyed my voice you see God told Abraham to offer Isaac His only Son this was his testimony all over 25 years he was asking Abram to give up the only thing he had what he stood for for 25 years and Abraham told the men I am the lad we grow up and we calm him down and he knew that he was off enough Isaac Isaac didn't know but if Abraham knew that so when they were growing up the boy in a foolish device it dad I see the wood I see fire but where is he how we doing this thing and God and Abraham said God will provide [Applause] mm is climbing up put up the mountain because God Himself telling the mountain in advance he say keep on travelin until I show you the mountain the Mitchell above a passing alternative the mountain then he comes up spot way grab his son tie and his son if I turn up it up Donna - yes Father watch man what if that was the kind of sunny bring her scripture to be corrected in Scripture they got next up see that son who been the father following instructions that son on the altar and even coming with a knife they know came in wanted to make sure you

evening and he come and miss Adam and the preacher said miss there's no song service Norma's fair nobody no believers then God come to talk to his son judge Cole and there's nobody there get it go inside I don't well every day I come in and talk with you because this was my intent and desire to have sons that I could communicate with and relate to on top to announce feeling good talking to my son every evening I'm looking for that fellowship God mrs. fellowship when they find Adam not in his position and I'm where you where you you see I heard a voice son and he got in Hyden way I reckon as a naked while you were naked did you eat of the tree yes woman give me no no he has no other brothers they him he's had nada people took talking Adam head in this is first man don't pass something early she's in community and she said he said from Big Al me so she passing on to God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle but every beast and upon thy belly shalt thou go it wasn't a snake like before he's not going into that form he was upright what's it now he went down on the ground upon thy belly shalt thou go already inject seed gonna be evil king but curse discipline isn't that right then God went to the woman under the woman because I was done this I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow shalt thou bring forth children and the desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee then for Adam because I was done this because I was hacked on to the voice of thy wife and eaten up that tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shall of eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee don't eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread till thou return unto the ground from out of it was no taking for dust thou art and the dust dog shall return because I want Adam that his sentence Adam right back to the dust welcome hallelujah so there are decisions that we have to make and their consequences of those decisions if we do the right thing we get the right results when Rebecca was called if she will go to meet Isaac a man she never saw I'm the asker will you go to this man she said I will go she said the right thing and when she said that they told me you be the mother of millions and may your seed possess the gates of them Oh give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] bringing for the seed of the righteous I hope you see who you are I hope you see what

going through God feel your pain he knows your struggle keep on struggling keep on fighting [Applause] so the Holy Spirit will not misbehave itself in one person I'm behaving on ourself another it'll make each person coming to its character because it's the spirit that lead you you're subject to its nature it don't bring it something to your nature it makes you subject its nature and the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it how you'll love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him on a thirst and a hunger just beating yourself he brings realities don't want your organization watch the way the spirit is leading and if the Spirit is leading it will never lead you contrary to the word it will never misbehave itself it will stay with the word Oh glory to God could we go a little further be in fifties this morning from possessing the enemy gates baramos reading and the angel called

come when the Holy Ghost begins to work that is what we waiting on that's what beyond expectation for for the Spirit of God to begin to flow freely because qua gonna find a bunch gonna find a people we're gonna find people somewhere on this earth that he could work through the Spirit of God yeah is my spirit flowing freely from the teachings to the manifestation of God because when Jesus began his ministry there was there was challenging they wondered about his authority his doctrine was so different he was teaching with the authority of God so but around says and after watch so Abraham I promise that too is see the whole will be blessed and we find out when he was 35 years old and series white was 65 years old and Abram stuck under the promise of god rom believe it was strong given

forgiveness if people ball cheese again stick with it [Applause] just sticking with love [Applause] so the Prophet prophesied let us rejoice together then he prophesied when that time comes when the church finds it's probably love when the church famous for decency when the church finds its place in Christ it will call the other members of the body camera Joyce with us God want the church to love him Oh blurring of God God wants the church to love him what's the objective citizen Tungus clash husband a wife and everything else what's the objective of oats grudges and all these different things

draw their hats into it so that Baptists Lunia shall over them it's not the real thing Methodists this group interpretation una shall they look at normal and they believe and they here and this group and in that Trish and whatnot but there are seeds of God waiting for something to join their hearts right there the only ending in the head and have the choice and it thinks so on the fields so humanistic but one of these days when that Holy Spirit began to move my god understand this that come like a magnet magnet don't pick up cloth and people if makeup pick up think that I'm magnet I see

John one day John wasn't simple for John Shelton it was a reality yet but we are living in a reality of what John was seen enough vision is only a vision he had and he shouted and he jumped and he praised have you worship for a vision but we living in the reality let me see them I'm not done yet when I'm done I'll be done I have the unction and anointed an inspiration to preach what I'm preaching is lonely and you know it and I know it blowing up God we get into something Oh hallelujah so not some organization but behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tyranny city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high not poor for a bishop not poorer books and tapes power from on high when I talk upon you is his power coming upon your life what glorious God you are sons and daughters of God what have no hierarchy you have no Pope - Bishop and Bishop over the bishop and then you have that that's all a structure here they get brought into the church instead of this church Jesus Christ no bishop no Cooperman no poop no man-made powers but Jesus Christ is his kingdom was coming into power and you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you you shall receive power after you're made of Bishop after you made a preacher after the Pope as we made a priest no after the Holy Ghost comes upon you pull in the head of the church Jesus Christ what kingdom is it the Messiah Kingdom the church is not an organization it's a mystical body the rich Christ is the head Christ is here this morning to connect with you you are members of his body you are members of this machine Oh glory to God what is the church is just a mystical body of Jesus Christ who set it up the Lord Jesus himself and you will never be able to understand the kingdom of God until you are born again it's an unraveled mystery but when you are when you are born again the plans of the kingdom and the Kingdom itself becomes real to you you have got to understand the blueprint or you won't know the blueprint until your Zbornak car just has somebody going until one bill is on business there's a blueprint you have to understand how to billets then I could wander the building isn't that right so therefore the four-piece praise God we said take care of the seven spirits lion poor Lavinia smarten ox Columba for th the man Newton Wesley and the eagle is William Branham isn't that butter Ramsay this creature or living creature was not beast this little creature is a word called zoom and beast wild beasts Asterion but as soon as living creatures Tyrion is the word piece as identified as room as United and United States they are beasts Tyrion but these four piece is not that these four pieces zoom they are living creatures isn't that right revelation 4 is living creatures not beasts okay and in Ezekiel Ezekiel saw it Ezekiel one and he read the scripture praise God hallelujah and watch living creatures they are not angels he said the voice of many either wrong above the throne there are three different categories there here on the throne is four living creatures outside of that 24 elders on salad act a host of angels so there are three categories wrong the throne four beasts living creatures is an array low hallelujah they are not angels they are not redeemed men what a day would you like to know here is my interpretation they are court guards of a strong these are his guards they are course angels to clad the throne so this throne of God is gathered that means any and anybody can access the glory the power the presence you're going to drum on that troll let me give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God the first piece lion okay I skip that whoo glory to God and in Ezekiel chapter 1 there was on wheels and one

Okolona go forward and their eyes were in and behind and in front to see what was what is I want is to come are you with me the eyes on the inside the eyes behind and the eyes in front have a purpose behind it to represent what was what is and what is to come what glory that wanted it could never go back what is it what this way is the man is it what that means the babies are is it what this means the eagle and say what that means the lion so on earth Ezekiel swirl of wood wheels because a church was on the move I met but the devil was stationary he's on the throne was set in heaven under peace

cherubim are flaming sword at the gate in the gadna eating cause if man ever got hold of the Tree of Life he could live forever oh my so these cherubim first mentioned whether the east gate of the garden going for means there's a Garden of Eden and this is the gate that opens swings out and at the gate or the cherubims it doesn't the cherubim it said Terrapins was placed there to guard what the Tree of Life that is what there was the guard the way of the Tree of Life the way boys away Jesus where is it reflected from the holy place where there was terrible's the holiest of Holies they are garden and reflecting the fire of God the way of the Tree of Life it can't come from Presbyterian seminary or Pentecostal seminary is a reflected light that might come from the throne of God these

there has to be an atonement a mercy seat and this altar of judgment becomes a mercy seat by the blood and when the blood is lifted it cannot the judgment again isn't that right and the only way to enter into the gate of Eden is to the blood of Jesus so King went out from the presence of the Lord from the kid of the garden therefore the presence of the Lord must have been at the altar so the dragon angels was guarding the presence of the Lord that was at the altar that all the reflected the throne of God oh then the proverb in little deeper he said Moses was told to make things as thought

which true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that them was of necessity be a return of dynamic power the believers sense this in their spirits began crying to God for a new or poem in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gives in the spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain here we go can only come after the former rain which is teaching REME the latter rain is harvest rain how could this be the real thing talking about the Pentecostal revival how could it be the real thing when the teaching rain has come the Prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people until the heart of return back to the pedicle forefathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and final quittin on the rapture had not come in it was a mixture here we go the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing that's already to mend the unrighteous partaken of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you it was also was daily power as men was under the control of Devils yet no one seemed to realize it and to prove it was not real these people even before the second generation I appeared organized and wrote it on Scripture doctrines and build their own fences as every other group of head of them did musicians come up please First Samuel 1314 God speak in 2 Samuel begins explore but not I Kingdom shall not continue the Lord had sought him a man after his heart and the LORD commanded him to be captain over his people because those not kept what the Lord had commanded thee there was always a word given to you for you to listen to for you to O be was here 6 1 my

presence of the Lord we don't spend enough time practicing the presence of the Lord a lot of people soon after service is over they can't wait to get back to quote/unquote life they can't wait to get back to paying the bills they can't wait to get back to reporting for work but when you hear you're in the presence of the Lord and there's coming a time you know but of it was preaching and he said you know you don't know this is the last service you don't know if a new tweak is gonna come and I saw the pictures of Barbara and some of these islands or whatever stated and I said you know Alberta speak and said they were been up there might have been a preacher preaching the Sunday before and they didn't know that was their last service because they say over 90% of the island is uninhabitable and they would have gone to church thinking it's just another service mother suddenly not knowing that the church building would no longer be there but the Branham said in a court he said one day Bible will be shut one day the last song will be sung when did the last service will take place so we ought to be so grateful for the grace of God that is extended to us that we could not only have life but have life in the right place like that's covered under the canopy of life where we can hear the word of God and it can we can be so encouraged to keep pressing organa choice amen so service continues on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and this coming Saturday at 5:00 p.m. for the entire church its youth oriented but it's open to anyone who wants to come we want have a special service focused on the young people and I don't want you to take it lightly at all and I spoke last week about really catching a burden for God to help our young people but the entire church is welcomed this coming Saturday at 5 p.m. maintenance group 3 please metered by the kiddo after the service and the pastor has given us homework for this week a message that you must read this week and is the message things
