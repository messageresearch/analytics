[14:54] and caleb still the people before moses
[14:56] and said let us go up at
[14:58] once and possess it for we are well able
[15:01] to overcome it
[15:02] but the men that went up with him said
[15:05] we
[15:05] be not able to go up against the people
[15:09] for they are strong on our way and they
[15:12] brought up an
[15:13] evil report of the land which they had
[15:16] searched
[15:17] unto the children of israel saying the
[15:19] land
[15:20] through which we have gone to search it
[15:23] is a land that eases up the inhabitants
[15:25] thereof
[15:26] and all the people that saw it in it are
[15:29] men
[15:29] of great stature let's switch to numbers
[15:32] chapter 14
[15:33] verse one and
[15:36] all the congregation lifted up their
[15:39] voice and
[15:40] cried the people wept that night
[15:43] verse five then moses and aaron
[15:47] fell on their face
[15:52] before all the children of israel of the
[15:54] congregation of israel
[15:57] verse 11 and the lord said unto moses
[16:02] how long will this people provoke me
[16:06] how long will it be air they believe me
[16:09] for all the signs which i have showed
[16:12] among them
[16:13] verse 23 surely
[16:17] they shall not see the land which i
[16:20] swear unto their fathers
[16:22] neither shall any of them that provoke
[16:24] me see it
[16:25] but my servant caleb because
[16:29] he had another spirit with him and had
[16:32] followed me fully him will i bring into
[16:35] the land
[16:36] where unto he went and his seed
[16:40] shall possess it verse 27
[16:44] how long shall i bear with this evil
[16:46] congregation
[16:48] which murmur against me i have heard the
[16:50] murmurings of the churn of israel
[16:53] and their murmur against me say unto
[16:56] them
[16:57] as truly as i live saith the lord
[17:00] as ye have spoken in my ears so will i
[17:04] do to you your carcass
[17:07] shall fall in this wilderness and all
[17:10] that were
[17:10] numbered of you according to your whole
[17:13] number from
[17:14] 20 years old and upwards which have
[17:16] murmured against me
[17:18] doubtless he shall not come into the
[17:20] land concerning which i
[17:22] swear to make you dwell therein see if
[17:25] caleb the son of jeffery
[17:27] and joshua the son of none but
[17:30] your little ones which you said should
[17:33] be a pray
[17:34] them will i bring in and they shall know
[17:37] the land
[17:38] which ye have despised let's go down to
[17:41] verse 36
[17:42] and the men in which moses sent to
[17:44] search the land
[17:46] who returned and made all the
[17:47] congregation to murmur against him
[17:50] by bringing up a slander upon the land
[17:53] even those men that did bring up the
[17:56] evil report upon the land
[17:58] died by the plague before the lord
[18:01] and joshua the son of nun and caleb the
[18:04] son of jeffers
[18:05] which were of the men that went to
[18:07] sisterland live
[18:08] still and moses told these saiyans unto
[18:12] all the children of israel
[18:13] and the people mourn greatly and they
[18:16] rose up early in the morning and got
[18:18] them up into the top of the mountain
[18:19] saying lo
[18:20] we be here and we'll go up unto the
[18:23] place which the lord had promised
[18:25] for we have sinned and moses said
[18:29] wherefore now do you transgress the
[18:31] commandments of the lord
[18:33] but it is not but it shall not prosper
[18:37] go not up for the lord is not among you
[18:41] that ye be not smitten before your
[18:42] enemies
[18:44] for the americanites and the canaanites
[18:46] are dear before you
[18:47] and you shall fall by the sword because
[18:50] you are turn away from the lord
[18:52] therefore the lord will not be with you
[18:55] but they presumed
[18:57] to go up onto the hilltop
[19:00] nevertheless the act of the covenant of
[19:02] the lord and moses departed not out of
[19:04] the camp
[19:05] then the amalekites came down
[19:08] and the canaanites which dwell on the
[19:10] hill and smote them
[19:12] and discomforted them even unto horrible
[19:15] let's pray father we thank you
[19:17] for your word that's already anointed we
[19:20] thank you for
[19:21] your people gathered here oh god give
[19:24] them water this morning

[20:49] that i love is if

[20:54] and placed in front of a jury would
[20:57] there be enough
[20:58] evidence to convict you

[21:05] accused
[21:06] of being a christian
[21:10] and placed in front of a jury would

[21:39] reading their bibles every single day
[21:41] they read in the bible
[21:42] that had to be a christian holiday
[21:45] humbling heart humbling spirit
[21:47] couldn't bring a conviction to say that
[21:49] truly is a christian
[21:50] arrest them and tie them up in chains of
[21:52] love send them home for eternity
[21:55] hallelujah force them down to the
[21:57] resurrection
[21:59] hallelujah i sentence you to the rapture
[22:02] for being a genuine christian get the
[22:04] lord
[22:06] come praise his people hallelujah so you
[22:09] go to that facebook page and get
[22:11] inspired
[22:12] hallelujah amen so this morning
[22:17] uh our title
[22:22] the bride's reproach for believing this
[22:26] revealed promise of dynamics
[22:30] the bride's reproach for believing
[22:34] this revealed promise of dynamics
[22:39] and i have an inspiration don't
[22:42] presume anything
[22:45] get thus saith the lord
[22:49] don't presume anything get dusty hello
[22:53] reproach to find fault
[22:56] to blame a disgrace
[23:00] all of this the bride must suffer
[23:04] like abraham 25 years believing on the
[23:07] promise of isaac
[23:09] like noah 120 years
[23:12] believe in the promise of reign
[23:15] now let's go along into the word but the
[23:18] brahmana wrote a message called reproach
[23:20] for the cause of the word god has a time
[23:24] and a reason for that time to fulfill
[23:26] all his work
[23:28] god knows just exactly what he's going
[23:30] to do we don't
[23:32] we just have to receive it as they give
[23:34] it to us
[23:36] but he knows and there is nothing going
[23:39] to go
[23:40] wrong with what he's planned to do
[23:42] [Applause]
[23:45] so stop trying to assist god nothing
[23:50] is going to go wrong remember what we
[23:54] said on tuesday night
[23:56] because balaam had something in his
[23:58] heart that was
[23:59] corrupt when god tell him don't go
[24:02] he still went back to seek the lord to
[24:04] see if god will change his mind
[24:07] and when he went back got to go
[24:11] but it came from perfect will
[24:14] to permissive will and we will
[24:17] emphasizing
[24:18] the reveal word will of god
[24:21] when the word reveal it it is the will
[24:23] of god
[24:25] it's not your dream it's not somebody
[24:27] text you
[24:28] it's the word being revealed
[24:32] and you've fallen in line to obey the
[24:34] word
[24:35] because if you watch what god say and
[24:37] how god bless people
[24:38] and you do that god have to bless you
[24:41] god
[24:42] must bless you because he's the same
[24:44] yesterday the today and wherever
[24:46] and if you see how god cursed people and
[24:48] you do that god will have to touch you
[24:50] because he is just and he is god he got
[24:53] to keep his word
[24:54] there is no respecter of persons he is
[24:57] god and god alone
[25:00] oh give them glory now the rescriptory
[25:04] red
[25:04] wasn't about unbelievers or make
[25:07] believers
[25:08] or they wasn't god's people these were
[25:10] the people that god brought out
[25:12] these were the people that saw miracles
[25:15] and these are the people that god was
[25:17] about to judge
[25:19] [Applause]
[25:20] oh glory to god hallelujah
[25:24] know this message this morning it's not
[25:26] an easy one
[25:28] but this is what i got from the lord to
[25:31] bring to you
[25:33] he knows and there's nothing going to go
[25:35] wrong with what he plans to do it all
[25:37] has to come about
[25:38] and they have to sometimes have to have
[25:40] rugged and hard things to bring out the
[25:42] true nature of the object
[25:44] rain is born in rugged ragged thundering
[25:46] skies
[25:48] god sets a time and has a purpose for
[25:50] everything he does
[25:51] there's nothing happen accidentally i
[25:53] love that
[25:54] to them that love the lord and called
[25:57] according
[25:58] to his purpose even the bad things and
[26:01] the uncomfortable things working out for
[26:03] good
[26:05] so so get comfortable with being
[26:07] uncomfortable
[26:08] come on now see him and somebody stop
[26:11] trying to get everything
[26:12] comfortable as you wanted get
[26:15] comfortable
[26:16] with being uncomfortable get comfortable
[26:19] being under pressure get comfortable
[26:22] being under tension
[26:23] get comfortable having mind profit get
[26:26] comfortable
[26:27] [Applause]
[26:30] hallelujah glory conquered not strange
[26:34] you're feeling uncomfortable cocky not
[26:36] strange you got a battle to come in this
[26:38] morning
[26:39] coconuts trained the devil didn't want
[26:41] you to be here this morning
[26:43] but you had to be here this morning
[26:44] because there's a word from the lord
[26:48] for you hallelujah
[26:53] no watch he said no
[26:57] but the brand i'm talking about came to
[26:59] church the two people carrying on making
[27:01] love in church
[27:02] volga and he's begging them to be quiet
[27:05] and the holy spirit
[27:06] said they're in your hands what will you
[27:08] do with them
[27:09] there was a holy hush everybody was
[27:12] deadly quiet i thought oh god
[27:14] what must i do then i remembered if it
[27:16] happened in the warning of the holy
[27:18] spirit two days before
[27:19] i said i forgive you amen
[27:23] and that is what he wanted me to say
[27:26] because after all i've been guilty
[27:30] maybe not of that but i'm guilty
[27:33] and guilty of the lease is of the whole
[27:36] so i
[27:37] said i forgive you and there are
[27:38] witnesses sitting here the holy spirit
[27:40] fell through
[27:42] now you see i believe that all these
[27:45] things had a meaning
[27:47] what would you do with the power why
[27:50] would god give a man power
[27:52] when the man don't have character that
[27:56] doesn't make sense he's going to
[27:59] abuse that power and god hates
[28:02] abuse god don't want no husband abusing
[28:05] no wife
[28:07] god even said if you don't treat your
[28:08] wife right he wouldn't even
[28:10] answer your prayer that's the word
[28:15] and this is how we go back to the bible
[28:18] this is how we get
[28:19] guidance and how we live not just to sit
[28:22] in church
[28:23] and say amen you got to live right
[28:26] you got to have right you got to do
[28:30] right
[28:30] [Applause]
[28:34] [Music]
[28:37] i want to say it again because saying
[28:40] again
[28:41] if you don't treat your wife
[28:45] right god will not answer your prayer
[28:49] so you better go back to the negotiating
[28:51] table and sort all the issues out
[28:58] why did you go there because i'm a
[29:00] pastor i'm supposed to go there
[29:05] don't go there this morning but all of
[29:07] it stop me
[29:09] oh give the lord some praises people i
[29:12] will go wherever the lord
[29:14] tell me to talk there is going to be a
[29:17] revival

[31:56] understand
[31:57] the test is given for you to overcome
[32:01] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[32:05] can you remember the disciples returning
[32:06] back rejoicing because they figured that
[32:08] they were
[32:08] conquered woody the standard reports for
[32:10] his name all that
[32:12] live godly in christ shall bear
[32:13] persecution the reproach
[32:15] of the word you always have to stand
[32:18] this reproach
[32:19] in order hear the purpose are you ready
[32:22] in order
[32:23] to give your destin
[32:27] the reproach is always to give you a
[32:29] taxi see so when god tell ibraham go can
[32:31] i make it right there you know
[32:32] see i got son next week look out next
[32:35] nice monday night
[32:37] then ibrahimovic hall like you know you

[32:40] call it fast food fast food
[32:42] nice fast fulfilled promise but you see
[32:45] you see patience is waiting on god and
[32:46] for god
[32:47] and and they can't get patients quick
[32:49] you have no fast food patience how fast
[32:50] god
[32:51] doesn't work patients like me patients
[32:53] must have this perfect work
[32:55] that could be entire lack of nothing so
[32:56] when god gave up promise he just put
[32:58] time on it
[33:01] he gave time for people to laugh at you
[33:05] hallelujah time for people to mock you
[33:07] look god tell buddha bran and he will
[33:09] kill the calibur
[33:10] big big bear how long it is and think of
[33:13] a big big caribou
[33:14] when they were hunting the grass was so
[33:17] low
[33:18] people tell about the random it has no
[33:21] caribou here
[33:22] but brother branham said i have nothing
[33:24] to do with that
[33:26] if god say 42 inch if god said
[33:29] caribou if god said grizzly tip or
[33:32] whatever it is
[33:33] if god said that he is able to make it
[33:35] come wherever you want to come
[33:38] so why they're talking and they're
[33:39] talking and the grass that's there when
[33:41] they look back so curry boobie
[33:43] [Applause]
[33:45] grisley tip or whatever it's right there
[33:47] who did that
[33:49] our business man to figure out how god
[33:51] doing it our business find out what god
[33:53] promised
[33:55] and let the devil know we believe that
[34:01] i i don't know when god gonna fulfill it
[34:04] my my my faith is to believe dynamics is
[34:07] promised
[34:08] power is promise not not a one power no
[34:12] it's promise
[34:13] in other words power is minds it is
[34:16] promise
[34:17] god said so i want to be like caleb
[34:20] have another spirit with me because them
[34:23] christ brought an evil report and god
[34:26] said as i live
[34:28] they're going to fall in the wilderness
[34:30] they're going to perish
[34:32] because i brought them out to give them
[34:34] all these precious promises
[34:36] that by these promises that can be a
[34:39] divine particle
[34:40] of the divine nature having escaped the
[34:43] corruption that is in the world you lost
[34:49] in other words you said that's it let me
[34:52] see that
[34:53] you take it today you are saying that
[34:56] you can't live that
[34:58] this is the promised land whenever you
[35:01] say that
[35:02] i don't know about that no that's insane
[35:04] just like what i'm
[35:05] evil report the land is a good land
[35:09] these people were so backslidden in
[35:11] spirit they say god
[35:13] would to god be tied in egypt
[35:17] you bring us out here to perish no
[35:20] you come out here to possess
[35:23] [Applause]
[35:25] [Music]
[35:26] mine so you always have to have this
[35:29] reproach to get a testing every man that
[35:31] comes to christ
[35:32] must first be child trained for the
[35:34] purpose that god has ordained you for
[35:37] remember if you could just keep quiet
[35:39] amen
[35:40] that would be bold we carry on we not
[35:43] keeping quiet
[35:44] watch remember if we call you for this
[35:46] there is nothing that can
[35:48] keep it from happening are you ready
[35:52] there is not enough devils in torment
[35:55] but what god would will be mean manifest
[35:58] i'm still reading you are born for a
[36:00] purpose and nobody can take your place
[36:03] [Applause]
[36:06] oh give the lord a big hallelujah he
[36:09] said
[36:10] you were born for a purpose tell the
[36:13] devil he's a liar you
[36:14] were born for a purpose that purpose
[36:17] must be fulfilled
[36:21] do you know god raise up pharaoh to
[36:23] bring long pharaoh
[36:31] so friends you could only understand god
[36:34] by faith
[36:36] and which is by revelation not by
[36:39] intellect intellect cannot comprehend
[36:43] god because intellect is limited
[36:46] there are no sense in intellect of man
[36:49] to contact god outside of the sense of
[36:51] faith
[36:52] and faith is a revelation so the prophet
[36:55] said that there is no school
[36:57] the christian mission of god revealed no
[36:58] theologians no teachings of the bible
[37:00] among any school they cannot know
[37:03] nothing about it it is impossible for
[37:05] them to know anything about it
[37:06] god here we go has hid the senses of
[37:10] knowing it
[37:11] from the very elected teachers
[37:14] talking about gifted man gifted teachers
[37:16] and their senses are comprehended
[37:18] so what they're pumping you with with
[37:19] his intellect the front loop back loop
[37:22] square loop whatever loop the gray
[37:24] matter
[37:25] that is what they're peddling intellect
[37:28] because god is not known by
[37:30] intellect are you with me that is why
[37:32] they were ignorant and unlearned
[37:34] peter was ignorant and unlearner peter
[37:37] couldn't sign his name
[37:39] peter couldn't sign a check peter may
[37:41] not even count all the bills
[37:43] but he had to take note he had been with
[37:45] jesus
[37:46] that man knew god not about god
[37:50] he can read about it he carried so he
[37:52] didn't knew
[37:53] about god he knew god because god
[37:56] was veiled in him middle eyes
[38:00] as was in moses god
[38:03] veiled in peter it wasn't reading about
[38:06] god it was saying silver and gold have i
[38:10] none
[38:11] what do you have i have god in me
[38:18] what is it what is it god above us
[38:22] purify a cloud god with us jesus christ
[38:25] and then god in you the holy ghost
[38:27] itself
[38:28] that's what's always god's purpose to
[38:31] hide himself in man
[38:33] to wrap himself in earthen vessels oh my
[38:36] you're getting me excited
[38:38] treasure in earth and vessels you are
[38:41] the earthen vessels you want to wrap
[38:43] himself

[38:50] first sign

[39:00] wrap your wrap you up
[39:01] wrap up your spirit into your life some
[39:04] tall some shorts some
[39:05] fat whatever it is it doesn't matter god
[39:07] failed god hiding himself god choose to
[39:10] hide himself
[39:11] oh what a wretch i am but god choose to
[39:13] hide himself
[39:14] you talk about praises and honor and
[39:16] glory when you understand what manner of
[39:18] love is this that god could choose
[39:20] to wrap himself inside of you that you
[39:23] got god rap gift you got a christmas
[39:25] skill

[49:47] and they say no whatever he's a liar he
[49:50] might be all twisted up he's a worm
[49:52] but he's a butterfly you have that worm
[49:54] behavior calling
[49:55] wrong but i prophesy that them butterfly
[49:58] wings gonna come
[50:00] god gonna take him out of the cuckoon of
[50:01] his love god gonna take him and cover
[50:04] him

[50:06] canopy of life
[50:08] and under that canopy of silence but

[50:22] genetic disposition dna stuff in you

[50:26] that god allowed to your family lineage
[50:29] to be a certain way
[50:31] some are strong some aggressive somehow
[50:34] quiet some of this that i or
[50:36] some worry a lot some have faith some
[50:38] have doubt
[50:40] and you have no control over that but
[50:43] that what god has in you
[50:45] is beyond that that's why the bible said
[50:48] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[50:51] and intents of the heart

[51:29] land is a good land
[51:32] don't confess your doubts don't talk

[51:36] fears let the week say

[52:05] he has been revealed to me and then the
[52:07] life that christ reduced here in the
[52:09] bible that seemed like that's in him

[54:47] christ
[54:48] in the most illiterate person amen
[54:52] hallelujah watch and the life of christ
[54:56] projecting his life through you
[54:57] with preeminences to the people that
[54:59] they see the very life
[55:01] works i keep seeing it over and over he
[55:03] never talked about teaching
[55:05] doctrine message you talking about the
[55:07] life
[55:09] the life have to be projected and i
[55:12] don't think people get in that
[55:14] people are safe in their churches for so
[55:16] long they have been taught to believe
[55:18] the pastor
[55:19] and the minister and the group that they
[55:21] trusted men instead of trusting the word
[55:23] understanding by no man people
[55:25] supporting this one and that one i'm
[55:26] standing by the word
[55:28] if anybody's standing on the word i'm
[55:30] standing with him
[55:32] i don't even have to meet him paul was
[55:34] in an arabian desert and when he get to
[55:36] peter
[55:36] they're speaking the same things and
[55:38] when paul at the boss and straighten out
[55:40] peter paul
[55:41] bust and straighten out peter because
[55:43] peter was going contrary to the
[55:45] principles
[55:46] of the word so you have to straighten on
[55:48] peter when peter said a right he said
[55:50] you have to be watch how paul writes
[55:51] because paul is a you know
[55:52] paul says i'm strong things i can't talk
[55:56] like paul because paul a different
[55:57] capacity and so forth everybody has
[55:59] different capacity and position
[56:00] and calling on sean i'm going to begin
[56:02] to reveal to the brethren
[56:04] what they're calling is no mankind tell
[56:05] me whether i would stay there you know
[56:07] that is your calling
[56:08] they are not my holy ghost they might
[56:10] want to be
[56:12] i mean my denominational pope guide or
[56:14] something like that but i'm not allowing
[56:16] them that
[56:17] privilege because god already take that
[56:19] position up there hello they can see for
[56:21] that
[56:21] they don't know if they can see to lead
[56:23] me they don't they can see the direct me
[56:25] you have no position for that holy ghost
[56:27] already take up that place to
[56:29] direct me where he wants me to go what
[56:32] he wants me to say
[56:33] and i will only say what he wants me to
[56:35] say praise god friend oh no friend
[56:38] family oh no family hallelujah
[56:42] and that's my son's that i tell him like
[56:44] it is
[56:45] yes
[56:49] ask any one of them tell them i love
[56:51] them very much
[56:52] but i don't love them stupid
[56:56] i love them with all these senses
[57:00] hallelujah i love them to rebuke them to
[57:03] correct them to
[57:04] amen to challenge them and that's how i
[57:06] love them they have no pastors and
[57:08] privileges
[57:09] ask them what make a person sunday for
[57:13] any other son
[57:15] or pastor daughter from any other
[57:16] daughter is the same some of them is big
[57:19] rascals
[57:20] some are getting most trouble in the
[57:21] church and they're protected by pastor
[57:25] that's my sons i'm not playing with
[57:27] words i'm not playing with games this is
[57:28] just
[57:29] oh i am hallelujah
[57:32] oh praise god you see you have to get
[57:36] disconnected from the senses part
[57:39] to really connect to god because your
[57:41] children will mess you up i tell people
[57:43] live for the lord only for your children
[57:45] put god firstly turn around and get all
[57:47] and leave you forget about you live for
[57:49] god
[57:50] put god first god does
[57:53] god first
[57:55] [Applause]
[57:58] if i take on all the issues and put some
[57:59] issues i will not even preach
[58:03] oh god man pray for me saints
[58:07] since you know what it is i stress out
[58:12] if i come here with that what kind of
[58:13] thing is that i can't afford to do that
[58:16] no no no no it's the word righteous
[58:19] right and wrong is wrong
[58:20] god has no respect to a person isn't
[58:23] that right do you love him
[58:26] oh praise the lord so watch by lack of
[58:29] revelation
[58:30] is why there are so many different
[58:31] divisions today
[58:33] and so much mockery so much visions
[58:36] among us is because the people like that
[58:38] revelation
[58:39] they lack that revelation the teachers
[58:41] could imagine the teachers
[58:42] lack revelation they have knowledge but
[58:46] not
[58:47] revelation oh my so here is lucifer
[58:50] again
[58:52] limiting the word of god to his
[58:54] reasonings
[58:55] that is lucifer now from simulator
[58:58] here we go when the church gets away
[59:02] from the word
[59:02] it will believe anything
[59:08] now do you realize
[59:12] like eve when cain was born she said
[59:15] i've gotten a man from the lord
[59:17] now listen to this revelation but the
[59:18] branham is breaking here do you realize
[59:20] that she really meant that
[59:22] she taught that she had a man from the
[59:24] lord you see
[59:26] once she had been deceived by taking the
[59:29] word of
[59:30] satan instead of the word of god she
[59:32] then taught
[59:33] that whatever she said was right
[59:39] and if she said she had a man from god
[59:42] then she had a man from god but god has
[59:46] set his laws universe
[59:47] a good seed can only bring forth good
[59:49] fruit even seed can only bring for evil
[59:51] food
[59:52] now eat seed true different will utilize
[59:54] the same earth
[59:55] nourishment moisture sunshine but it
[59:57] will bring forth of its own kind
[1:00:00] now if you look at the statement of eve
[1:00:02] real close
[1:00:03] you will notice that she had more of an
[1:00:05] understanding than most realized
[1:00:08] she did not attribute the son to satan
[1:00:11] for that would have made him equal with
[1:00:13] god
[1:00:15] so eve had deeper thoughts than you
[1:00:16] might might appear
[1:00:18] only god could create the egg in the
[1:00:20] womb of mary
[1:00:22] satan couldn't do that eve knew that
[1:00:24] satan can only pervert
[1:00:26] so he beguiled her with the wrong seed
[1:00:28] it was the serpent sea that brought fort
[1:00:30] came
[1:00:31] it was adam's sea that brought fort abel
[1:00:33] and set those seeds
[1:00:34] went through the same process but the
[1:00:36] children were different for they were
[1:00:38] different seeds
[1:00:39] she believed that cain was from god
[1:00:43] she accepted the devil's lie as the
[1:00:45] truth of god
[1:00:46] that is exactly what we have now
[1:00:49] churches
[1:00:50] set themselves up as fountains of the
[1:00:53] truth
[1:00:53] but the truth is not in them they have
[1:00:55] begotten children
[1:00:57] swear by them and would even kill to
[1:00:59] uphold the
[1:01:00] error if you think that's an
[1:01:03] exaggeration
[1:01:04] read second timothy chapter three i
[1:01:07] charge ddf4 before god
[1:01:10] and the lord jesus who shall judge the
[1:01:12] quick and the dead at his apparently his
[1:01:14] kingdom
[1:01:14] preach the word be instant in season out
[1:01:17] of season
[1:01:17] reprove rebuke exhort with all long
[1:01:20] suffering and doctrine
[1:01:21] for the time will come when they will
[1:01:24] not endure
[1:01:25] song doctrine but after their own lust
[1:01:28] shall heap to themselves teachers
[1:01:30] having itching ears and they shall turn
[1:01:32] away their ears from the truth
[1:01:34] and shall turn to fables but watch
[1:01:37] though
[1:01:37] in all things and your afflictions do
[1:01:40] the work of an evangelist
[1:01:41] make full proof of thy ministry when the
[1:01:45] church allow herself
[1:01:46] to move away from the original like adam
[1:01:48] and eve debt
[1:01:49] set in there is no strength in her
[1:01:53] she has become a monstrosity
[1:01:57] the minute the church moved towards form
[1:02:00] and ceremony
[1:02:01] and towards priesthood by organizing the
[1:02:03] ministers
[1:02:04] into a group that decided leadership
[1:02:08] apart from the holy spirit and his word
[1:02:10] that very moment
[1:02:12] death entered when she started to get
[1:02:14] sick and she got sick
[1:02:16] she charged she changed to a powerless
[1:02:18] group of people
[1:02:19] whose only weapon was argument
[1:02:25] when i was studying this and i read this
[1:02:28] i said my mind was totally blown
[1:02:30] only weapon argument
[1:02:34] she could produce nothing in the spirit
[1:02:36] for her hopes were built and programmed
[1:02:39] and not on faith in his word they sold
[1:02:42] program
[1:02:42] they reprogram they sold pervision they
[1:02:45] read perverted children
[1:02:49] you tamper with god and you'll reap
[1:02:50] exactly what you injected
[1:02:52] what will happen if you change your
[1:02:53] truth into a lie the answer is you will
[1:02:56] breed an antichrist godless system of
[1:02:58] religion
[1:02:58] that is so perverted it will not look
[1:03:01] like or produce that original what the
[1:03:03] original did
[1:03:04] the only answer that god has for
[1:03:06] situation like that is the lake of fire
[1:03:08] there are those who say that god's
[1:03:10] people are going to come together
[1:03:11] through
[1:03:12] a collective revelation i want to get to
[1:03:14] this
[1:03:15] this is but at his time
[1:03:18] there was a scene in that time
[1:03:22] that elijah ministry of malachi 4 is a
[1:03:24] collective ministry
[1:03:25] it's a body ministry and he had to
[1:03:27] refute that listen to this there are
[1:03:30] those who say that god's people are
[1:03:31] going to come together through a
[1:03:32] collective revelation
[1:03:33] i challenge that statement it is
[1:03:37] uh it's a ball invalid assumption
[1:03:40] in the face of revelation 10 7. now i do
[1:03:43] not deny that people will prophesy in
[1:03:45] this last age and their ministry scanner
[1:03:46] will be correct
[1:03:47] i do not deny that there will be
[1:03:49] prophets even in the days of paul
[1:03:51] there was one akavas a prophet who
[1:03:52] prophesied a famine i agree that is so
[1:03:55] but i deny upon the infallible evidence
[1:03:59] of the word
[1:04:00] that there is more than one major
[1:04:02] prophet messenger who would reveal the
[1:04:04] mysteries
[1:04:05] as contained in the word and who has the
[1:04:08] ministry to turn the hearts of return to
[1:04:10] the fathers
[1:04:11] thus saith the lord his unfailing word
[1:04:14] stands and shall stand and be vindicated
[1:04:17] there is one prophet messenger to this
[1:04:19] age on the basis of human behavior alone
[1:04:23] anyone that where there are many people
[1:04:27] there is even divided opinion on lesser
[1:04:29] points of major doctrines
[1:04:31] that they hold together who then
[1:04:35] will have the power of infallibility
[1:04:38] to be restored in the last age for this
[1:04:41] last
[1:04:41] age is going to go back to manifesting
[1:04:44] a pure world bride
[1:04:46] [Applause]
[1:04:47] so in other words once there are men
[1:04:49] there'll be differences that's obvious
[1:04:51] when they are people
[1:04:51] in family their differences and church
[1:04:53] is their differences he said who is
[1:04:55] going to bring back that infallible word
[1:04:57] because they're going to have a pure
[1:04:58] bride are you with me
[1:05:01] now watch the second tour that must be
[1:05:03] impressed
[1:05:04] okay sorry that means here we go
[1:05:08] we will have the word once again
[1:05:11] as it was perfectly given perfectly
[1:05:14] understood
[1:05:15] in the days of paul i will tell you who
[1:05:18] will have it
[1:05:19] it will be a prophet vindicated
[1:05:23] even more thoroughly vindicated than any
[1:05:27] other prophet in all ages
[1:05:28] from enoch to this day
[1:05:33] that is the magnitude of vindication are
[1:05:36] you with me
[1:05:37] because this man will of necessity
[1:05:40] have the capstone prophetic ministry
[1:05:44] [Applause]
[1:05:46] hallelujah so do you caught what peter
[1:05:49] branham had
[1:05:50] he had the capstone prophetic ministry
[1:05:54] so his ministry revealed the mysteries
[1:05:57] to bring down the capsule itself
[1:05:59] therefore this prophet has revealed
[1:06:01] every mystery
[1:06:03] no man can come back to reveal no
[1:06:05] mystery
[1:06:06] it has already been revealed we have to
[1:06:09] find where it is written
[1:06:11] where it is hidden but it's already in
[1:06:13] the word
[1:06:15] because monarch i thought at the
[1:06:16] capstone ministry
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:20] oh hallelujah
[1:06:24] god will show him forth he won't need to
[1:06:27] speak for himself
[1:06:28] god will speak for him by the voice of
[1:06:31] the sign
[1:06:33] the second thought that must be
[1:06:34] impressed on our hearts is that the
[1:06:36] seven church ages started out with the
[1:06:37] antichrist spirit
[1:06:39] as well as the holy spirit listen to the
[1:06:42] approach
[1:06:43] of him going into scriptures first john
[1:06:46] 4
[1:06:46] 1 beloved believe not every spirit
[1:06:50] but try the spirit
[1:06:53] you have a dream
[1:06:56] who said that is god people take every
[1:06:59] dream for god
[1:07:01] they see alligator they see a tiger
[1:07:04] and they see a flock every dream
[1:07:08] sometimes you eat corn too late in the
[1:07:10] night
[1:07:12] somebody overeat and everything get
[1:07:14] crossed up
[1:07:16] and then they get some pictures in your
[1:07:17] head and they come out of your bed with
[1:07:18] that
[1:07:22] even with something good you could write
[1:07:24] it shelf it you know watch it
[1:07:26] but don't come out with islam you're
[1:07:28] looking for it
[1:07:30] unless god gives you a direct vision
[1:07:32] fear not joseph to take unto thee mary
[1:07:35] thy wife
[1:07:37] joseph gathered in a dream a dream
[1:07:41] i know she went to her reproach i know
[1:07:43] she's going through her thing
[1:07:44] everybody mocking and laughing her but
[1:07:46] that is what the bride has to go through
[1:07:49] but you're pregnant with messiah
[1:07:54] you're going to produce the life of
[1:07:56] christ do you believe that
[1:07:58] all right believe not every spirit but
[1:08:00] try the spirits whether they of god
[1:08:03] watch watch because many false prophets
[1:08:07] are going out into the world not literal
[1:08:10] many did you notice it the antichrist
[1:08:13] spirit is identified with false prophets
[1:08:15] the ages came into force prophets and
[1:08:16] they go out with false prophets now of
[1:08:18] course there's going to be a real false
[1:08:20] prophet
[1:08:21] in the grandson of that man mentioned in
[1:08:23] revelation
[1:08:24] but as now before this revelation they
[1:08:26] had to pay many
[1:08:27] false prophets matthew 24 36 and they
[1:08:31] and if any man shall say unto you lord
[1:08:32] he has christ believe it not
[1:08:33] they shall arise false christ false
[1:08:35] prophets shall show great signs and
[1:08:37] wonders in so much
[1:08:38] if they were possible they shall receive
[1:08:40] the very elect behold i have told you
[1:08:41] before
[1:08:42] wherefore if they say unto you behold
[1:08:44] he's in the desert go not forth
[1:08:46] behold he's in the secret chamber
[1:08:47] believe it not these
[1:08:49] false prophets are a emacked for us in
[1:08:52] various other scriptures
[1:08:53] such as second peter two one to two
[1:08:57] and there were false prophets among the
[1:08:59] people even as there shall be false
[1:09:01] teachers
[1:09:02] among you who privily shall bring in
[1:09:04] damnable heresies
[1:09:06] even denying the law that brought them
[1:09:07] and bring them from themselves with
[1:09:09] destruction
[1:09:10] for many shall follow their pernicious
[1:09:13] ways by
[1:09:14] reason of whom the way of truth shall be
[1:09:15] evil spoken of
[1:09:17] ii timothy 4 3 and 4 for the time will
[1:09:20] come
[1:09:20] when they shall not end your song
[1:09:22] doctrine but after their own lust shall
[1:09:24] he
[1:09:24] to themselves teachers have been itching
[1:09:25] ears and they shall turn away their
[1:09:27] heirs from the truth
[1:09:28] and shall be turned to fables second
[1:09:30] timothy 4 1
[1:09:32] the spirit speaketh expressly that in
[1:09:34] the latter time shall come
[1:09:35] many shall depart from defeat given he
[1:09:38] to seducing spirits and
[1:09:40] doctrines of devils now in every case
[1:09:43] you will notice
[1:09:44] that a false prophet is one who is
[1:09:46] outside the world
[1:09:47] just as we showed you that antichrist
[1:09:49] means untoward
[1:09:50] saw these false prophets come perverting
[1:09:52] the word giving it a meaning
[1:09:54] that fits their own devilish ends have
[1:09:57] you ever noticed how the people
[1:09:59] who leads others astray bind them
[1:10:02] closely to themselves by fear
[1:10:05] i want to repeat that have you ever
[1:10:07] noticed how the
[1:10:09] people who lead others astray
[1:10:13] bind the people to themselves by fear
[1:10:17] they say if the people don't do what
[1:10:19] they see or they leave
[1:10:21] then destruction will follow they are
[1:10:23] false prophets
[1:10:25] for a true prophet will always lead one
[1:10:28] to the word
[1:10:29] and bind the people to jesus christ and
[1:10:32] he won't tell the people to hear him
[1:10:34] or what he says but to fear what the
[1:10:36] words say amen
[1:10:37] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:10:42] i'm exhausted this morning on the word
[1:10:45] butterburner give me a church here we go
[1:10:48] full of the holy ghost
[1:10:50] god will do in one year what all the
[1:10:53] theology failed to do in 2000 years
[1:10:56] you wait till the anointing of the
[1:10:57] church really strike home
[1:11:00] that's what we're looking for that's the
[1:11:02] dynamics we're talking about
[1:11:03] we are looking for a church full of
[1:11:05] earth full of the holy ghost
[1:11:07] full of what the holy ghost
[1:11:12] after the dawn's gentleness closed go
[1:11:14] and learn to change them
[1:11:15] he does fill to be filthy still oh
[1:11:17] praise god notice
[1:11:19] here we go moses he was the anointed
[1:11:22] word for that i promised with for that
[1:11:24] day isn't that right
[1:11:25] noah was anointed with that day abraham
[1:11:27] and so forth
[1:11:28] now watch and moses stood there
[1:11:31] that anointed word of that day that's
[1:11:33] why he could put his hand on his wisdom
[1:11:35] why
[1:11:35] he was standing in the presence of god
[1:11:39] you see when samson is under the
[1:11:41] anointing
[1:11:42] he could do anything when moses is on
[1:11:44] the anointing
[1:11:45] these guys could do anything it wasn't
[1:11:48] moses it was the presence
[1:11:49] it wasn't moses what the kind of glory
[1:11:52] it wasn't brother bryan and one time god
[1:11:53] taught barack do you think is you
[1:11:54] healing the people
[1:11:57] you have to remain by the brand you see
[1:11:58] what's so automatic it was so flowing he
[1:12:00] said you think is you healing the people
[1:12:02] this god was healing the people is that
[1:12:04] man healing the people
[1:12:06] is the virtue in freely oh hallelujah
[1:12:09] hallelujah
[1:12:11] isn't that right so moses the glory
[1:12:14] around him
[1:12:14] every move he made represented god
[1:12:18] are you ready that is where the church
[1:12:21] ought to be standing now
[1:12:24] hallelujah he said but we are off on
[1:12:26] something nomination or something
[1:12:27] so the church now should be representing
[1:12:30] god
[1:12:31] every move we make supposed to be under
[1:12:33] the glory and direction of the spirit
[1:12:36] direction of the spirit not
[1:12:39] intellect if you are scriptures men are
[1:12:42] led by the spirit of god
[1:12:44] they're the sons of god now watch god
[1:12:47] spoke i must deliver
[1:12:48] but to moses whether he like it or not
[1:12:52] he said not to be different but to be
[1:12:53] obedient obedience is better than
[1:12:55] sacrifice
[1:12:56] god had so much complete control of them
[1:12:59] till he was their voice and their
[1:13:02] actions i like that god had these men so
[1:13:05] much under their his control
[1:13:07] his control that those men became his
[1:13:10] voice
[1:13:11] and action it was not mata man studying
[1:13:15] to bring forth a message
[1:13:16] no it was a matter of the man so much in
[1:13:19] the presence of god
[1:13:20] that he spoke for god they were one with
[1:13:22] their message
[1:13:23] they were one with god isn't that right
[1:13:26] hallelujah
[1:13:27] god had so much complete control of them
[1:13:29] till he was their voice and
[1:13:32] give me a church that's so completely
[1:13:34] anointed with god
[1:13:36] till their very action and move is
[1:13:39] thus saith the lord walk in that kind of
[1:13:42] glory i will
[1:13:43] show you a messiah anointed one standing
[1:13:46] upon the face of the earth
[1:13:48] oh hallelujah so he is predicting he is
[1:13:51] prophesying give me a church full of the
[1:13:53] holy ghost he is predicting
[1:13:55] he is prophesying a church anointed with
[1:13:57] god
[1:13:58] hallelujah a church anointed with god
[1:14:01] what is that the promise of the father
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:06] jesus told a woman in the world we know
[1:14:09] what we worship
[1:14:10] the father secret such to worship him in
[1:14:12] spirit and in
[1:14:13] we didn't have the full truth to the
[1:14:15] ages because only now
[1:14:17] god could get proper worship because
[1:14:20] william branham brought the fullness of
[1:14:22] the word
[1:14:23] back to the people with the fullness of
[1:14:25] the word comes the fullness of the
[1:14:27] spirit
[1:14:28] so it's only no god to release the
[1:14:29] fullness of his spirit so we can act
[1:14:31] ignorant
[1:14:32] we can't act like we don't know we have
[1:14:34] 40 years of this message
[1:14:36] right in the earth 40 plus years god
[1:14:39] filtering
[1:14:40] taking out the make believer the
[1:14:41] unbeliever a halfway believer whatever
[1:14:43] because you have to work two believers
[1:14:45] oh praise god
[1:14:46] that woman of the world was a true
[1:14:48] believer you know she just didn't know
[1:14:50] it yet
[1:14:51] she was trapped in the pharisees and she
[1:14:53] was trapped under our kind of life
[1:14:55] but that didn't hinder that seed inside
[1:14:56] of her and some of you might be trapped
[1:14:58] inside of here but that's not going to
[1:15:00] hinder the seed of god
[1:15:01] inside your life that's why god will
[1:15:03] open his eyes big
[1:15:04] when this one in this condition and that
[1:15:06] condition in that condition is religious
[1:15:08] people open their eyes big and find
[1:15:09] fault with us and find fault for that
[1:15:11] but we have all sin and come
[1:15:12] short of the glory of god are you with
[1:15:15] me we'll praise the name of the lord
[1:15:18] hallelujah let's get down a little
[1:15:20] deeper now
[1:15:22] abraham father of nations
[1:15:25] how many children you do you have at
[1:15:27] this time
[1:15:28] that old critical spirit would criticize
[1:15:30] what did abraham said stagger not to the
[1:15:32] promise of god
[1:15:33] why you are praying here so and so that
[1:15:35] doesn't matter if i prayed for ten
[1:15:37] thousand tonight this is brother brown
[1:15:39] and ten thousand died in the morning
[1:15:42] tomorrow night i was still annoying and
[1:15:43] sick and pray for them
[1:15:45] god said so doesn't stop it one bit
[1:15:50] but that's the reproach for the word
[1:15:53] hallelujah
[1:15:54] so whenever you believe a promise and
[1:15:56] god put time on that promise
[1:15:59] hallelujah that's you bearing a reproach
[1:16:00] for the world
[1:16:02] your wife said where is the promise your
[1:16:04] husband said where is the promise
[1:16:06] your neighbor said where is the promise
[1:16:08] church member said where is the promise
[1:16:10] but you are believing a promise
[1:16:12] and you are believing it and being a
[1:16:13] reproach for the very word itself
[1:16:16] watch the scuffness of baroness i like
[1:16:18] that combination
[1:16:19] the scuffness of baroness being scuffed
[1:16:23] do you approach a baroness first she had
[1:16:25] to stand the report of being barren for
[1:16:27] all those years
[1:16:28] no life he's talking about life that's
[1:16:29] the thunder that shake the devil
[1:16:31] the life behind the name that make the
[1:16:32] demons tremble oh what the trainer needs
[1:16:35] thousands of
[1:16:35] voices only talking about virtues for
[1:16:37] years since these seventies was my first
[1:16:39] jews virtues virtues
[1:16:41] so watch barbara says you could have the
[1:16:43] batman goes 24 hours and still be lost
[1:16:45] but what they didn't go down deeper is
[1:16:47] that there is body
[1:16:48] there is soul and there is spirit now if
[1:16:52] you don't need the holy ghost peter can
[1:16:53] i bypass the upper room
[1:16:54] peter could have said i my name is in
[1:16:57] the book
[1:16:59] i have a seat in my soul but every time
[1:17:01] the ball look him he go run
[1:17:04] because he have no power he's sealing
[1:17:06] his soul but but no power
[1:17:08] but when he got the holy ghost he got
[1:17:11] the holy ghost
[1:17:12] upon the season and soul not running
[1:17:16] anywhere
[1:17:17] peter said this is that that the prophet
[1:17:20] joel
[1:17:20] speaker
[1:17:23] [Music]

[1:17:27] you may be seated
[1:17:28] and after a while you say you come today
[1:17:30] then and the lord show me
[1:17:32] that's true we come to a dead end but we
[1:17:34] die at the end
[1:17:36] and god show me joshua moses came to
[1:17:38] deaden and joshua take over
[1:17:40] jesus came to the dead and the holy
[1:17:41] ghost take over the thunders bring you
[1:17:43] to a dead end it has to bring you to a
[1:17:44] dead end
[1:17:45] hallelujah if you bypass the tree of
[1:17:47] life you'll jump onto the cheek of
[1:17:49] knowledge
[1:17:50] and you'll get plenty mysteries off that
[1:17:51] knowledge tree oh glory to god we have
[1:17:54] them been
[1:17:54] there before brother george hallelujah
[1:17:57] we have been there before
[1:17:59] we know there's a revolution of life the
[1:18:02] seed and you have to come to life
[1:18:04] some point in time you have to get alive
[1:18:08] i come that you might have life
[1:18:13] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:18:16] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:20] so people can make the word say whatever
[1:18:21] they wanted to say but there's a
[1:18:23] middle of the road it's not right oh

[1:18:30] manifestation

[1:21:08] they want to do it like moses all the
[1:21:10] time moses saying don't say lord that's
[1:21:12] the lord that's certain people when god
[1:21:14] says speak to the rock moses get vicks
[1:21:16] and with this mighty reconciliation like
[1:21:18] you and i and iran
[1:21:20] bring water for you rebels that was
[1:21:21] dusty at moses
[1:21:23] and god didn't like that because all the
[1:21:25] time all mother was supposed to do is
[1:21:27] dusty the lord
[1:21:28] god god it was god's people it wasn't
[1:21:31] moses because god brought them out
[1:21:33] god says speak to the rock for water
[1:21:35] moses didn't feed him and speak his
[1:21:36] anointed
[1:21:37] mighty rock drinky rebels
[1:21:41] it looked good it looked bad it looked
[1:21:43] impressive
[1:21:44] anybody said you see that you should be
[1:21:46] smited
[1:21:50] god say hello come in the back room i
[1:21:52] want to talk to you
[1:21:55] take mosuli back office and say moses
[1:21:56] you glorify yourself
[1:21:59] and for doing that i'm going to
[1:22:00] discipline you you see god don't spoil
[1:22:02] children we just make a mess of a job as
[1:22:08] parents
[1:22:10] mess god don't you
[1:22:13] straighten out his sons straight not his
[1:22:16] daughters
[1:22:17] street not his people i'm not talking
[1:22:19] about the enemy no
[1:22:20] i'm talking about his people hallelujah
[1:22:23] notice when the backslide he let some
[1:22:25] king come and take them captive
[1:22:26] until they repent and then he punish
[1:22:29] that king and bring them out
[1:22:30] that's what we're talking about my my
[1:22:33] mind
[1:22:34] so abraham now he went to his his
[1:22:37] reproach isn't that right
[1:22:39] and they came true now just want to
[1:22:41] bring back something new
[1:22:42] that wine and oil is connected together
[1:22:45] and wine is the power of stimulation by
[1:22:47] revelation
[1:22:48] and when something is revealed it gives
[1:22:51] stimulation
[1:22:52] to the believer so when people shake in
[1:22:54] their head about iman amen amen there's
[1:22:56] no revelation yet you know that's just a
[1:22:57] man in the wood
[1:22:58] but when things are revealed it brings a
[1:23:00] stimulation
[1:23:01] that just make it jump on your seat that
[1:23:03] doesn't make you want to run on the
[1:23:04] building
[1:23:05] that has been the excitement of your
[1:23:06] life when you get to revelation
[1:23:08] and to get revelation the holy spirit
[1:23:10] are revealed to you
[1:23:12] and they get revelation you have to be
[1:23:13] in the spirit so the devil's job now is
[1:23:15] to
[1:23:15] rub you up the spirit he's like a
[1:23:17] highway robber he puts your gun on say
[1:23:19] get off the spirit say something to
[1:23:21] throw you off the spirit
[1:23:23] so you come all natural you get upset
[1:23:25] your mind
[1:23:26] bothering you and you're not in the
[1:23:27] spirit and you're just going to the
[1:23:28] motion
[1:23:29] until you're watching the clock and say
[1:23:30] when we're over going undone when you're
[1:23:31] going undone when you're going you're
[1:23:33] but when you're in the spirit yeah study
[1:23:35] when you're going to finish because you
[1:23:37] want to get more
[1:23:38] you want to be empowered you want god to
[1:23:40] reveal it to you

[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:33] you cannot defeat a man who has an
[1:33:36] experience
[1:33:38] as opposed to a man who read it in a
[1:33:40] book
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:44] you cannot defeat a man who has
[1:33:48] experienced
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:55] a man studying his degree to be a doctor
[1:33:57] fine professional
[1:33:58] phd and so on right now he's reading the
[1:34:00] book how to operate
[1:34:02] got it so kaddish so take the tread onto
[1:34:04] it
[1:34:06] you are sick you go to the hospital and

[1:34:24] that comes a cutting he had trembling so
[1:34:28] he never cut before cutting you
[1:34:29] not me you need somebody who have
[1:34:32] experience
[1:34:35] so you want the great hair doctor who
[1:34:38] cut
[1:34:39] a thousand cases who know
[1:34:42] what he is doing because he had the
[1:34:45] experience
[1:34:49] dr jesus is on the scene
[1:35:03] now watch some people rely on the gifts
[1:35:06] and talent
[1:35:08] and almost like they want to assist god
[1:35:09] with their gifts and talent
[1:35:11] god don't need our gift and talent and
[1:35:14] that's what i love about david
[1:35:16] david didn't comfort in an overconfident
[1:35:19] manner if god was with me
[1:35:21] what killed him come with him no no
[1:35:23] david togola you come to me with spear
[1:35:25] and shield
[1:35:26] but i come to you in the name of the
[1:35:30] lord
[1:35:30] god of israel david knew he was
[1:35:33] represented god
[1:35:35] he was representing heaven he was
[1:35:38] representing the court of isaac jacob
[1:35:40] and of israel he knew he was anointed
[1:35:46] he knew he had the authority he wasn't
[1:35:49] presuming
[1:35:50] he told the lad i will cut your head off
[1:35:57] that's not earth that's not bad
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:02] that is what i'm going to do
[1:36:05] god god shake a black intellect
[1:36:09] because all the time god looking for a
[1:36:10] big man like himself very biggest one to
[1:36:12] fight
[1:36:13] he won quote for quote tax for text
[1:36:17] scripture for scripture david didn't
[1:36:19] come like that
[1:36:20] so when goliath saw david come and he
[1:36:21] said am i a dog is that your son to
[1:36:24] fight me
[1:36:25] you know who i am i am z gold hyatt
[1:36:30] with a capital g and david come like
[1:36:34] with the commandee
[1:36:37] i was gonna take your head off and david
[1:36:40] did just that
[1:36:41] by the spirit of prophecy and david
[1:36:43] gonna rise on the scene again
[1:36:45] oh yes a bride anointed with charity
[1:36:49] but to challenge the intellectual giants
[1:36:51] on the field
[1:36:52] but that's where they are on the field
[1:36:54] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:57] shaken up kingdom with the intellect oh
[1:36:59] yes no praising of the lord
[1:37:02] so therefore when something is revealed
[1:37:04] it brings
[1:37:05] stimulation because it is brought by
[1:37:08] revelation
[1:37:09] now what something every revival use a
[1:37:11] twin is none right
[1:37:12] jacob and esau isn't that right esau
[1:37:15] didn't care about the birthright but
[1:37:17] jacob
[1:37:17] he just wanted the birthright he didn't
[1:37:19] care isn't that right
[1:37:21] so every viable is a natural man and a
[1:37:22] spiritual man natural man just come to
[1:37:24] church he doesn't want to come to church
[1:37:26] you know where to go this morning go to
[1:37:27] church but spiritual man he wants his
[1:37:29] birthright
[1:37:30] want his portion i don't want you come
[1:37:32] here natural
[1:37:33] come here spiritual come here with a
[1:37:35] desire for the holy ghost
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:39] don't let nothing cut your expectation
[1:37:42] for the holy ghost
[1:37:44] anything cutting your expectation behold
[1:37:45] is the devil
[1:37:47] any doctrine cutting your expectation
[1:37:49] for god to fill you with the spirit
[1:37:51] is a doctrine of devils
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:56] a lot of people don't want to get the
[1:37:57] birthright because the thing is a little
[1:37:58] bit unpopular
[1:37:59] okay they don't want to get on the altar
[1:38:02] and cry a little bit
[1:38:03] or go to a few meals they don't want the
[1:38:04] new bird because they knew but it's kind
[1:38:06] of messy
[1:38:07] like any bird i don't care if it's a pig
[1:38:09] pen a band a pink hospital
[1:38:11] it's a mess oh praise the name of the
[1:38:14] lord
[1:38:15] you don't realize you've got a soul
[1:38:17] that's going to leave here and go
[1:38:18] somewhere
[1:38:20] oh my god you see what you're talking
[1:38:22] about
[1:38:23] people are acting and so on you see your
[1:38:25] destination right here the way you live
[1:38:27] and the way you do it is scary you are
[1:38:30] here what you are somewhere else
[1:38:32] people that want to take a ticket to
[1:38:34] have them friends i don't have enough
[1:38:36] breath and words to tell you
[1:38:38] it can't work that way but a brand i'm
[1:38:40] pleased with the brown time i haven't
[1:38:41] said bahamut it won't work
[1:38:43] you've got to have the token it was its
[1:38:45] own tabernacle you were telling the
[1:38:46] truth to them
[1:38:47] he said believe in me believe it you've
[1:38:49] got to apply the token
[1:38:51] that was applied now we say i got to
[1:38:52] display the token what was the token
[1:38:55] was the blood in the door post was the
[1:38:56] blood on the inside
[1:38:58] no the blood was on the outside isn't
[1:39:00] that right
[1:39:01] praise the name of the lord so all what
[1:39:03] these virtues that we have here
[1:39:05] it cannot be hidden it have to come only
[1:39:08] out
[1:39:08] how many stand that all this virtual
[1:39:11] knowledge and temperance
[1:39:13] it can't stay on the blackboard there
[1:39:15] and say we have a nice pretty picture
[1:39:17] that have to come on the outside of your
[1:39:19] life
[1:39:20] that your wife could see it your husband
[1:39:22] could see it your children could see it
[1:39:24] you're christian on every day praise god
[1:39:26] you do what
[1:39:27] you know there are some people when
[1:39:28] people are wrong then they do a lot of
[1:39:30] stuff because nobody is seeing
[1:39:31] this makes it alive and nobody is a
[1:39:34] you're a christian
[1:39:35] when nobody's looking are some people
[1:39:40] that's why that dictator said oh
[1:39:42] there's some people can't control their
[1:39:43] own life and they need dictators and god
[1:39:46] i'm not
[1:39:46] saying god it has spiritual dictators
[1:39:48] they're natural dictators these
[1:39:49] activists say let's sit down shut up
[1:39:50] move this
[1:39:51] wear this don't wear this they like that
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:54] because they don't have that internal
[1:39:56] discipline
[1:39:58] that's not in training here every
[1:39:59] problem is a law pass a law pass a law
[1:40:02] they often already they ain't getting
[1:40:03] the skull
[1:40:04] laws don't work in that way
[1:40:07] because laws external laws can't con
[1:40:10] can't manage internal issues
[1:40:14] the problem is within the heart of man i
[1:40:16] know external law would just stop that
[1:40:18] thou shalt not steal god give that long
[1:40:20] time and since when man stopped stealing
[1:40:24] you know wrong god said thou shall not
[1:40:26] steal it's not now
[1:40:28] and you think god mansell's stealing
[1:40:31] you know what a klepto is just like to
[1:40:33] pick up things
[1:40:35] they don't even need it once they're
[1:40:37] there they pick it up
[1:40:39] they don't know what it's for
[1:40:46] let's pick it up could i have that
[1:40:48] anybody else have that they take it up

[1:43:48] it's all about you but consider jesus
[1:43:53] consider how god left glory consider how
[1:43:56] he was patient with the disciples
[1:43:58] consider how he went through with them
[1:44:01] consider the good he did and how he
[1:44:03] hated him consider he went all the way
[1:44:05] and said father forgive them
[1:44:06] consider he pricey paid to love you and
[1:44:08] to reach you and
[1:44:10] can't we do that for each other
[1:44:13] can't you go the extra mile can't you
[1:44:16] reach out a little deeper
[1:44:21] can't you extend yourself to somebody
[1:44:22] who would even care for you
[1:44:24] have somebody who you know wouldn't help
[1:44:26] you and can't you do that
[1:44:28] without looking for a reward you're just
[1:44:31] doing what is right you're doing what is
[1:44:32] kind
[1:44:33] you're doing what is true you're doing
[1:44:34] what is loyal you're doing is faithful
[1:44:36] god remembers those things god sees
[1:44:39] those things
[1:44:39] that's why god said not 100 people will
[1:44:42] cross over except joshua and caleb
[1:44:45] what did joshua caleb said he said this
[1:44:47] city land is a good land
[1:44:48] go back and read the script in 14 damn
[1:44:50] fellas cry they rent the garment
[1:44:52] they say oh god the land is a good land
[1:44:54] they're telling the people that
[1:44:57] it will change your attitude change your
[1:44:59] pictures
[1:45:00] god didn't tell them listen kill and
[1:45:02] talk that talk no they was in their
[1:45:03] heart
[1:45:05] it was in their heart they loved god
[1:45:09] amen ten other ministers brought to
[1:45:11] every report
[1:45:14] if you take that today people will
[1:45:17] support the 10 ministers
[1:45:19] because that's a big number it's telling
[1:45:22] them saying the same thing
[1:45:25] they're all saying the same thing who
[1:45:28] knows those two things they are
[1:45:30] this is different it's easy
[1:45:34] to believe teachings and doctrines than
[1:45:37] to believe the promise of dynamics
[1:45:40] because the bible says people have
[1:45:41] itchiness silly women leading with lust
[1:45:45] keeping on themselves teachers having
[1:45:47] itchiness there's itching to get more
[1:45:49] mysteries
[1:45:50] more revelation more interpretation
[1:45:52] itchiness
[1:45:54] because the promise looking long they're
[1:45:56] looking hard because you ought to
[1:45:57] prepare yourself for it
[1:45:59] amen the promise of the father it's the
[1:46:01] promise of the holy ghost
[1:46:03] the promise of dynamics and i am
[1:46:05] preaching until it come to pass
[1:46:07] [Applause]
[1:46:08] if you're tired here in dynamics i'm
[1:46:10] sorry for you because i will be
[1:46:12] preaching it and preaching it and
[1:46:13] preaching it
[1:46:14] because one day the rain is going to
[1:46:15] fall you didn't know i was entirely 120
[1:46:18] years
[1:46:19] was the message it will rain but you
[1:46:22] know what the evidence of he believed in
[1:46:24] that the accused villain
[1:46:26] if no one say it will rain are we doing
[1:46:28] about it there we go
[1:46:31] who knows but noah's building
[1:46:34] white prophesying building pressing
[1:46:37] building it's gonna rain
[1:46:39] power gonna come dynamic's gonna come
[1:46:41] it's gonna rain
[1:46:43] what about already the same message you
[1:46:44] preached that's the president tell me
[1:46:45] you leave here
[1:46:46] i'm preaching the same message you're
[1:46:47] preaching to light of course i preaching
[1:46:49] light
[1:46:51] i'm not a heavy preacher i don't have a
[1:46:52] message on my own i preach in another
[1:46:54] man's message
[1:46:55] william branham is the prophet i am a
[1:46:58] prophet
[1:46:59] god didn't say to you the prophet i am
[1:47:02] not a prophet
[1:47:03] in case you thought i was no i don't
[1:47:06] amen i am not presuming amen
[1:47:10] i am hold on to dusty at the lord
[1:47:14] because this is what the prophet brought
[1:47:16] god
[1:47:17] said the lord oh hallelujah okay let me
[1:47:20] just skip down now
[1:47:22] so but i'm safer man watch
[1:47:25] get this the church is supposed to be
[1:47:28] predestined to adoption of children
[1:47:30] where a man a man can god can take a man
[1:47:32] adopt him to the family and give him
[1:47:34] something
[1:47:35] first try that
[1:47:39] a man came last night pilfer pay over my
[1:47:42] home
[1:47:43] angel on one side angela and one inside
[1:47:46] and whatnot
[1:47:46] and the fun thing said you're here not
[1:47:48] text money just your insulin
[1:47:50] the first thing to do what try that
[1:47:56] not take that and run with it oh you
[1:47:58] have one person say
[1:48:02] did you try it he said try it
[1:48:07] all i don't want to say oh i want to try
[1:48:08] it oh i want to hear nice things
[1:48:12] then you'll be deceived this is the word
[1:48:15] here
[1:48:16] the man claims a certain thing try it
[1:48:20] try it and see if it is right if it is
[1:48:23] right
[1:48:24] move right with it and say lord send us
[1:48:27] something
[1:48:27] else isn't that right so i want you to
[1:48:31] understand
[1:48:32] you have to suffer a reproach for the
[1:48:34] revealed word
[1:48:35] mary edwards suffer a reproach for
[1:48:37] testifying she's gonna have a christ
[1:48:40] she's gonna have a son she's gonna have
[1:48:41] a baby and she'll know no man isn't that
[1:48:43] right
[1:48:44] no presuming that what presumably mean
[1:48:46] taking things for granted
[1:48:47] venture with authority isn't that right
[1:48:49] don't go quickly
[1:48:51] but abraham they were presuming they
[1:48:53] were right because they had priests
[1:48:55] and their synagogues if
[1:48:59] it doesn't matter whether truth or error
[1:49:03] whether what we do how we live what we
[1:49:05] preach it doesn't matter
[1:49:06] listen to this why did god let six
[1:49:09] thousand years of suffering
[1:49:10] and perils and death strike the human
[1:49:13] race
[1:49:15] if he just didn't let eve get by with
[1:49:18] one little misconcept word
[1:49:22] he is a god of anger he's a god of
[1:49:25] justice
[1:49:26] he's a god of holiness he said what if i
[1:49:29] was on the street he said no watch talk
[1:49:31] about love could you imagine having a
[1:49:32] little boy
[1:49:33] i say honey just go ahead if you want to
[1:49:35] drink that liquor

[1:49:41] shells on it and hammerlock i love you

[1:49:50] where cars are going 60 miles an hour
[1:49:52] down the street

[1:50:05] he said no watch a real daddy will
[1:50:08] shut the height over him that's the
[1:50:11] matter today
[1:50:12] you're trying to preach the gospel with
[1:50:14] soft gloves on
[1:50:15] priesthood is all right here we go i'm
[1:50:18] gonna finish
[1:50:20] israel here presumed that they were all
[1:50:23] right

[1:50:27] people of god
[1:50:28] god come again egypt sent this prophet

[1:50:52] i'll drunk behind you not only that he
[1:50:54] sent us angel food

[1:50:58] and that prophet said and the will of
[1:51:00] the lord said don't you go up there
[1:51:02] if you do god won't be with you but they
[1:51:05] presumed

[1:51:28] the boundaries of god's word
[1:51:31] listen stay with the word look didn't
[1:51:34] jude
[1:51:35] said earnestly content for the fate 1896
[1:51:38] they already got away from it
[1:51:40] i'm skipping on quickly oh praise the
[1:51:42] name of the lord are you with me
[1:51:44] now watch that tree started growing what
[1:51:46] happened the church was cut down
[1:51:48] and the tree started growing what did it
[1:51:49] do they organized it got cut down the
[1:51:51] branch off it withered died
[1:51:52] like jesus said he pruned it upcoming
[1:51:54] wesley another branch coming on it what
[1:51:56] did he do organized god put
[1:51:57] listen there's god's tree but as they
[1:52:00] organized he cut it off
[1:52:02] who did it not the devil got cut at all
[1:52:04] that's not what he wants
[1:52:06] and the chief is pushing up you keep
[1:52:07] cutting it off
[1:52:09] guanine will cut people in this message
[1:52:11] he will
[1:52:12] once they're gone they would cut him off
[1:52:13] because of the blessing of duty fountain
[1:52:15] same god
[1:52:17] same god people claim to be serving same
[1:52:19] god with testimonies
[1:52:20] you have to continue to save god but
[1:52:22] imam said this way he said a lot of
[1:52:24] ministers and i'm saying this
[1:52:26] think that they no longer have to save
[1:52:27] god they get so secure with the
[1:52:29] congregation they feel they could do
[1:52:31] anything and get away with
[1:52:33] it
[1:52:36] afterwards they feel secure there's so
[1:52:38] much people that have beaten elder they
[1:52:39] feel secure
[1:52:40] and everything else that they started
[1:52:42] little making small sin
[1:52:43] little small thing here and afterwards
[1:52:45] god leave them they don't even know the
[1:52:47] church is void of god
[1:52:49] yes it have sermons yes it's not
[1:52:52] scriptures
[1:52:53] yes they have thoughts but where is the
[1:52:54] living god among the people
[1:52:56] amen hallelujah it does not solve it it
[1:53:00] doesn't put us on a throne
[1:53:04] each one have to serve god daily
[1:53:08] the elders in here the deacons in here
[1:53:11] the ushers is here
[1:53:14] god hates abuse abuse of authority
[1:53:18] abuse of position that is why god have
[1:53:21] to give people character and test first
[1:53:24] before putting them in a power
[1:53:29] humbles people to see what's in their
[1:53:32] heart
[1:53:35] so god keep cutting it off
[1:53:39] i don't want to read something here look
[1:53:41] how buddha brown bring it who came face
[1:53:43] johnny baptist preaching what repentance
[1:53:45] who come next
[1:53:45] jesus christ and he put jesus on a
[1:53:47] signification second move
[1:53:50] amazing father satisfied them to the
[1:53:52] truth what come next the baptism of the
[1:53:54] holy ghost
[1:53:55] john kepler bought what repentance jesus
[1:53:57] brought signification
[1:53:59] and then the holy ghost that he said if
[1:54:00] i don't go holy ghost will not come
[1:54:02] i have to go for the holy ghost to come
[1:54:05] isn't that right
[1:54:06] so therefore after the word is the
[1:54:08] spirit elohim came down with flesh on
[1:54:10] him and gave abraham a fresh promise
[1:54:12] i will return to the according time of
[1:54:14] life no more flesh coming back again a
[1:54:16] spirit to come
[1:54:17] so the spirit is what is promised you
[1:54:19] have to wait for it
[1:54:20] do you believe that so watch along the
[1:54:23] church ages here 14 minutes come
[1:54:25] the first one what it took the fruit of
[1:54:28] broadly love
[1:54:29] took it off next thing conquer worm the
[1:54:32] leaves of fellowship
[1:54:33] suck the very life out of it we have too
[1:54:36] much of god as a good god
[1:54:37] he loved me too much to punish me he
[1:54:39] promised he loved adam he loved eve he
[1:54:41] is love
[1:54:42] but he has to keep his word
[1:54:45] oh praise god god never does deal with a
[1:54:47] group he does with an individual
[1:54:50] israel presumed he was just so good they
[1:54:52] seen so many things that they could
[1:54:54] do they wanted to do isn't like a
[1:54:56] teenage boy that's the way the church is
[1:54:57] today they feel well god give me the
[1:54:59] holy ghost
[1:54:59] if i want to do this i can do this that
[1:55:02] goes to show it's not there if you was
[1:55:03] in christ you'll hold to his word
[1:55:05] regardless amen do you believe that
[1:55:08] don't presume don't venture without
[1:55:12] authority
[1:55:13] samson presume i ain't got lux anymore i
[1:55:16] presume i'm the same old guy i went
[1:55:17] something shake himself no power was
[1:55:19] there
[1:55:21] hallelujah watch
[1:55:25] what did we do the revival started 14
[1:55:26] years ago penny castle found out she
[1:55:28] couldn't stretch herself no more
[1:55:30] because she organized the little groups
[1:55:32] and hated one another
[1:55:34] they chose people sold discord among
[1:55:38] brethren
[1:55:39] and the revival struck it the evening
[1:55:40] like come in what did she do she
[1:55:42] couldn't do nothing because she
[1:55:43] organized
[1:55:43] she lost her strength her brother love
[1:55:46] the fruit of the spirit
[1:55:47] i'm almost done listen closely samson
[1:55:50] thought
[1:55:51] he is still here you better be feeling
[1:55:54] he's still here
[1:55:55] a contort when he took the wedge it
[1:55:57] won't be noticed
[1:56:00] a preacher said to me brother branham
[1:56:01] doesn't make a difference whether it's
[1:56:02] this way or that way
[1:56:04] sure it makes a difference that's the
[1:56:05] very lie that satan told eve
[1:56:07] it does make a difference well as long
[1:56:10] as the rest of them does it i don't care
[1:56:11] who does it
[1:56:12] or who doesn't do it i don't want to do
[1:56:14] it anyhow i
[1:56:15] am not presuming that's all right
[1:56:18] because the rest of them does it
[1:56:20] god requires this and this is what i've
[1:56:23] got to have
[1:56:24] amen i am not presuming about
[1:56:28] nothing adam said
[1:56:32] i won't be noticed it don't make a
[1:56:34] difference but it did make a difference
[1:56:36] it can aikon said it won't be noticed it
[1:56:38] will make a difference but it did make a
[1:56:39] difference
[1:56:40] that one little wedge upset the whole
[1:56:42] program of god
[1:56:43] oh hallelujah you see what brown went on
[1:56:46] to say now a confession is a stone you
[1:56:48] should i confess jesus christ i confess
[1:56:49] to believe the message
[1:56:50] but you need us to miss him to shape you
[1:56:52] you need to be shaped
[1:56:54] your confession of believing but abraham
[1:56:56] is not good enough your confession of
[1:56:57] believing jesus christ is not good
[1:56:59] enough
[1:57:00] now you come to church to get as pastors
[1:57:02] told mason
[1:57:03] to blossom crack on your stone to shape
[1:57:06] you he said
[1:57:07] into the image of the son of god oh
[1:57:11] hallelujah you said watch noah okay
[1:57:14] almost done hallelujah wow
[1:57:19] whoa noah take my time my brother
[1:57:22] take my time oh hallelujah noah's time
[1:57:26] they presumed
[1:57:27] if it come like a flood ignore well the
[1:57:29] only thing they will do is jump in their
[1:57:30] own boat
[1:57:33] them say they have their own boat they
[1:57:35] could jump in it but there was only one
[1:57:37] boat that was
[1:57:38] god constructed i believe i belong to
[1:57:41] the church i do this i do that but
[1:57:42] there's only one group that god
[1:57:44] constructed
[1:57:45] and that is not a denominational
[1:57:47] construction
[1:57:49] it's the word construction revelation of
[1:57:52] his power constructed the boat
[1:57:54] you see god give a revelation to noah
[1:57:57] was build a boat of in wood now
[1:58:00] wood is a
[1:58:01] soft wood an absorbent wood any
[1:58:04] intellectual phd person here that
[1:58:07] revelation
[1:58:07] will say it's false because that would
[1:58:10] go to sync
[1:58:11] but god tell him that word because god
[1:58:13] has a further revelation
[1:58:15] to attack that revelation god go in and
[1:58:18] put pitch on the outside
[1:58:19] and pitch on the inside to seal the boat
[1:58:22] and that is the wood
[1:58:23] to absorb the ceiling
[1:58:29] that is the wood to absorb the ceiling
[1:58:33] and the seven thunders is the wood to
[1:58:36] absorb
[1:58:37] the spirit the seven thunders is the
[1:58:40] mechanics
[1:58:41] and charity is the dynamics
[1:58:48] oh hallelujah hallelujah so you may be
[1:58:51] seated so the seven thunders
[1:58:53] is supposed to strip us of self
[1:58:56] strip us to nothing strip us like
[1:58:59] in wood
[1:59:01] that god descend the spirit and seal it
[1:59:04] on the inside
[1:59:05] and steal it on the outside and the
[1:59:08] devil has no
[1:59:09] path with me oh
[1:59:12] i feel good though oh
[1:59:16] hallelujah that was the footage of
[1:59:18] revelation
[1:59:19] that quote was on the brick toneur
[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:25] oh man watch
[1:59:28] god constructed watch so many prophets
[1:59:32] today
[1:59:33] telling so many different things get the
[1:59:35] people confused
[1:59:37] don't presume just watch
[1:59:40] for the vindicated promise let's go
[1:59:43] there you are pentecostal missed about a
[1:59:45] million miles you went after sensation
[1:59:47] instead of waiting for the world to be
[1:59:49] fulfilled
[1:59:51] it is always the leaders that get the
[1:59:53] people out of the will of god
[1:59:56] what it was korra it was an uninspired
[1:59:59] leader
[2:00:00] him all this thing is the only man
[2:00:01] didn't god put the spirit of prophecy
[2:00:03] upon all these people
[2:00:04] took it over moses and put it here so we
[2:00:06] just listened to this group
[2:00:08] moses think he is something god told
[2:00:10] moses separate yourself
[2:00:12] watch moses was god leader moses was
[2:00:15] vindicated to be that leader
[2:00:17] all that didn't listen to him perish
[2:00:20] jesus was god's leader
[2:00:21] the holy ghost is the leader and all
[2:00:24] that don't obey the holy ghost who wrote
[2:00:26] this bible will perish
[2:00:28] so you know who the leader is right now
[2:00:29] the holy ghost
[2:00:31] not some man from anywhere else it's the
[2:00:33] holy ghost
[2:00:34] he was sent to lead the church isn't
[2:00:36] that right now jesus said wait
[2:00:39] he said isaiah 26 11 said precept must
[2:00:42] be upon precept
[2:00:43] isn't that right watch then no listen
[2:00:46] peter jumped in
[2:00:47] and said wait a few minutes watch
[2:00:50] skipping fast
[2:00:51] hallelujah he said peter's had to preach
[2:00:55] the very next day he preached on joel in
[2:00:57] the upper room
[2:00:58] when he recognized people struggling to
[2:01:00] hold on peter come next time preach on
[2:01:03] joel
[2:01:03] he said it shall come to pass in the
[2:01:05] last days i'll report my spirit and so
[2:01:07] forth they were waiting
[2:01:09] they wasn't presuming they had anything
[2:01:11] they were waiting until the scripture
[2:01:14] was made manifest oh brother i wish it
[2:01:17] wasn't this late
[2:01:18] we would like to stay a little bit they
[2:01:20] waited for scriptural authority
[2:01:22] because the scripture said how it will
[2:01:23] come you can't imagine how we're gonna
[2:01:26] come
[2:01:26] the scripture talk about the power the
[2:01:28] scripture talk about how it's gonna
[2:01:30] come let's talk about tears my spirit
[2:01:32] flowing freely
[2:01:33] come on see him and somebody the
[2:01:35] scripture speaks about it do you believe
[2:01:37] that
[2:01:38] now watch moses one time
[2:01:41] presumed without a witness without an
[2:01:45] experience
[2:01:45] he heard words that he was to be a liver
[2:01:49] but he didn't have the call he didn't
[2:01:50] have the experience
[2:01:52] so he presumed that he could go and take
[2:01:54] over oh hallelujah
[2:01:56] and you know i'm the moses he killed one
[2:01:57] man and run because he presumed
[2:02:00] that because he is supposed to be
[2:02:01] deliverer because his mother told him
[2:02:03] what god told her he had a second hand
[2:02:05] hearing god never talked to him
[2:02:07] he didn't hear direct from god so moses
[2:02:10] went in the power of his intellect
[2:02:12] to try to deliver the people and he
[2:02:14] failed big time
[2:02:15] he failed big time but when that pill on
[2:02:18] fire
[2:02:19] when that fire in the burning bush when
[2:02:21] that struck moses
[2:02:22] there was no feeling now more than just
[2:02:25] say ain't no stopping me now
[2:02:27] i'm going straight down to phil i'm
[2:02:29] going to tell him
[2:02:30] let my people go i'm anointed
[2:02:33] i'm commissioned i heard from god met
[2:02:36] the pillar of fire
[2:02:37] had an experience with god who could
[2:02:40] stop a man
[2:02:41] that has met that pillar of fire oh
[2:02:45] glory people oh hallelujah hallelujah
