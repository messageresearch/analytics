want to read Psalms 24 1 to 6 and we also want to read Psalms 43 first tree and for reiden said mark chapter 7 read in verse 1 then came together unto him the Pharisees and the sitting of the scribes which had came from Jerusalem and when they saw some of these ciphers eat bread but defiled that is the seed with unwashen hands they formed for it for the Pharisees and all the Jews except they wash their hands off to eat not all in the tradition of the elders and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they had received a whole as the washing of cups and pots brazen vessels of tables then the Pharisees and described asked him why walk not by disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands he answered and said unto them well see had Jesus prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me albeit in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandments of God you hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things II do and he said unto them full well you reject the commandment of God that he may keep your own tradition for Moses said honor thy father and thy mother and whose of Acoustic father and mother let him die the debt but you see if a man shall see it is father mother it is : that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by he shall be free and you suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother making the Word of God of none effect through your tradition which you have delivered and many such like things do ye and when he had called all the people unto hear me senator them hearken unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defy him but the things which come out of him those are they that be fired the man if any man have ears to hear let him hear and when he had entered the house on the people his disciples asked him concerned a parable he said unto them ie so without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entering it into the man it cannot defile him because it entered not into his heart but into his belly and going out into the draught personal meats he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man forward in out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness all these evil things come from within and defile the man we go to Sam's 24 wanna read verse 1 to 6 the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that

heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek Him that seek thy face o Jacob Scylla and last scripture from Sam's 43 verse 3 and 4 Oh send all delight and I truth let them leave me let them bring me unto thy Holy Hill unto thy Tabernacles

crowd you might wear a better suit of clothes but brother God wants a clean heart and a clean hands he wants a clean up Church that he can show himself you see the early church was a pure Church because the surprise here was to have to go and get a lion's den the brilliant a snake so to be to be a Christian at that time you have to be killed you knew you was going to be killed so the church

you can be there with a different beat in your soul in your spirit in your heart in your mind he shall ascend into the hill of the world Oh glory to God this is a kind of difficult message whatever and our preacher that I I had no context geta wrong it but we gonna be here but this is what put us on my heart this is the first time I learned by heart I kind of repeat this step on first one Street down the whole sound this is the Lord the fullness that robbed the world and all the daring do you know any Psalm I told by her I don't mind my early Christian experience this was the first sound I kind of speak the whole entire song by heart and now I'm preaching on it he shall ascend into the hill of the Lord this scripture can be applied to all ages but has a special place in this of adoption and manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah God there is no holy hill it's a holy God on the hill there is the holy mountain it's a holy God on the mountain makes the mountain holy whenever god

hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord a shock this morning there has always been a holy hill or mountain with God met on that with man the a crescent moon art when Noah act landed and saw the rainbow Abram was to sacrifice his son on mount moriah mont sinaï is where it Moses received the Ten Commandments disguise when Moses saw the Promised Land no camel israelites are called on fire mon transliteration it's let the voice said there is always a hill onto the hill of the Lord of the Lord I shall move on the stand in his holy place or glory of God hallelujah may be seated the object of this endtime message is to get the people ready for the coming of the Lord the endtime message is not established churches that's why the prophets that I did not come to build another denomination I came to bring individuals interests touch of a perfect man that there can become Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] maybe season when you become a pause Europe plug into nobody you
