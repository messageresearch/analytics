praise [Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah God bless you Saints It's a grand privilege to be here today and like to greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ whom to know is life and life eternal just a quick background bring greetings from the assembly back in Australia Perth Western Australia originally from South Africa now/ Australia Australia but um where I come from is not important where I'm going that's important um I just like to put out a disclaimer before I start this testimony this testimony is never about me it's about God and how he changed my life and healed my life and changed it completely so that I can go around and talk about the goodness of God that nothing can stand in the way of our almighty God 20 2021 got diagnosed with kidney disease by the time I got to the doctors kidney disease was now sitting at 19% 19% I'm in danger there's nothing more I just need to follow the process and then see how it goes because the end results would be then dialysis went to a convention in Tasmania and I went to declare to Satan that I'm here to show the devil on whose side I am hallu came back from that convention all hell broke loose in my life but that's okay because I have a god that is not a he's not a liar he's a man that sticks to his word my kidney failure my kidney function just went right down I was now sitting on 9% um any medical doctor will tell you that that is not good news I was disappointed as a Son of God but not for long because then I realize that God can take you out of any situation if you only believe if you only take God at his word you start praying w the prophet says your prayer is like an atomic bomb it will rattle anything anywhere and any time and it will just be debris and God will just come down and take care of you I then go through a lot of bad things in my life my kidneys are not playing well I become toxic my whole body becomes toxic because there's no filtration system the devil fights me I get nauseous I've got no iron levels I have chronic fatigue I am twice my sius what you see now is a new version of Steven he took me out of that bad situation and he placed my foot on a rock to stay and all the while this is happening when God gives you a wife outside of Salvation God gives you a good wife that wife stood and every morning when I wake up and I'm down I can't even lift my head I'd hear a prayer and say thank you Lord for Steven's healing thank you Lord for Steven's healing thank you Lord that's all she prayed and we're going through through through our motions then I'm sick I I broke out into eczema because when the body is not in Balance everything goes wrong my skin started I look like an alligator or a crocodile because the skin would just break out I would scratch until blood comes out it was not good but this was my test and my cross to bear and I would pray and I would ask God to come closer and I would pray and all in the background it says just hold on my child hold on my CH Joy comes in the morning and part of my testimony in part of me being in Trinidad is when I was so sick and with the time change I would switch on 2: a.m. in the morning and I would listen to all these ministers preach and they preach so much of faith into me that I said to my almighty God when I'm back on my feet again and I know you're going to pull me out of the darkness I will come to Trinidad and this is my first stop since my healing is Trinidad because I keep my promise to my almighty God that if you can do it for me you can do it for anybody that is in this place because is anything to heart for God no sir Hallelujah God is not a man that he should lie he pulled me out and I asked him to come down and I pull down the strongholds and I told Satan to get the behind me it is written it is also [Applause] written things got worse but in the background things was getting better I knew things was getting better not long 2022 I get a a a call and there's this a special prayer for me that was done and the brother that came to pray for me the anointing was so great that day in the service and he came to me and he says to me brother what would you like me to pray for and I had nothing to say and it was just the Holy Ghost speaking through me and I said these kidneys aren't working anymore I want you to ask God on my behalf to give me a new kidney and guess what the order I asked it in I received a new kidney 3 months from the date of my prayer to the date I got a call Mr ESO can you come in at 7: in the morning we have a perfect [Music] match but when that call came I knew another call was going a call a royal telephone to Glory this is my beloved son I will take care of him he's been through a lot but I'll give him rest I went to hospital the doctors put in a kidney and from the time they connected the new kidney until now one year 6 months the Lord has only been good to me I walk with him I talk with him I give him all the honor and all the glory because Satan thought he's going to defeat me this is another Son of God I'm going to declare that he is here and anything you ask in his name receive it in the name of [Music] Jesus God took care of everything the doctors came back and says this is impossible when we put in a kidney it takes a few months even sometimes this one kicked in from the time we put it in it's almost like your brother gave you a kidney I said yes my heavenly father gave me this one and he's going to take care of it I'm here to say don't let the devil preach to you don't let the devil tell you it's impossible with God nothing is is [Applause] impossible guess what 4 months later Easter weekend Hallelujah now everyone that knows me especially the Saints from all over knows that I've been wearing spectacles for as long as I have been on this face of this Earth I had what's called bleeding behind the eyes I've had intense pressure behind the eyes I had macular generation I had so much wrong and that Easter I said Lord I am ready to unpack because I need to get lighter for the Rapture and the brother made a call not even a prayer line he just made a call he says if there's anything you don't want bring it to the altar my God we all ran to the altar I threw my glasses in Tasmania it's still there went back I've got 2020 Vision by God's grace he's restored my vision I can look up now like an eagle and I can rise up like an eagle my God is amazing there's no other words for Grace but amazing I go back to work everyone sees my condition and says Stephen did you get laser surgery I said no not laser spiritual God operated on these eyes a colleague then takes it into to her confidence and she goes and a month later she calls me she says I'm going through a real bad time I had chronic um pain in my shoulders but last night I prayed and I said God my colleague Steven told me that you healed his eyes can you please heal my shoulder the Tuesday she came back she said God

Spirit upon you to call in this meeting and the guidance of the choices made and the selections of the preachers and their messages heard so far we played back the message of brother daily in our morning service today and and as many could not stay through the midnight on the hooker uh sometime something very special happened among the entire congregation this morning at the closing of the message with prayer and in the solemn quietness there came a mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost anointing upon the worshippers there was great crying for God and suddenly the Holy Ghost filled the entire church with such anointing ref fillings and healings we never had this experience Among Us in in recent times till today the testimonies are rolling out with special refilling and God Mighty touch we worship with great joy and happiness and I thank God for all his benefits though we are not there physically but it feels like we are there both physically and spiritually with you all in the convention thanks to the technical crew for such wonderful quality pictures video and audios but you for a truth I must say this from my bottom of my heart that it is still thundering our expectation this afternoon your morning is higher thanks for the giv uh for giv to the Lord Lord we bless you brother Char aobi praise God and also sends his greetings so I want to read a scripture uh we have something to present to you before our speaker come this morning from 2 Kings chapter 2 reading from verse one and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gigal and Elijah said unto Elisha T here pray thee for the Lord that sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord live it as I so live it I will not leave so they went down to beel and the sons of the prophets that were at Beal came forth to Elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today he said yeah I know it hold your peace Elijah said unto him Elisha St here I pray thee this is verse four and the Lord sent me to Jericho and verse 5 and the sons of the prophets that were Jericho came to Elijah and said unto him knowest thou not that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to thee and and he answered yeah I know it holy your peace Elijah said unto him tar I pray thee here for the Lord God had sent me to Jordan he said as the Lord liveth as I so liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on so this Elisha Ministry is a type of Def fful Ministry that will cross Jordan but says and we tonight we want to think that remember in the midst of all this cry God cannot send a Revival till he got men in shape to take it so men are the physical vessels and and and and and and body that God want to use we need man of God we need men that God could use and we are seeing that men that God is using he says we cannot send a Revival till he got men in ship to take it we cannot have a Revival until we get men God called men God trained men that's not train in School of Theology and education but rugged men of faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training men who are not afraid to face the fire men who has come in the presence of God and knows his power and knows his omnipotence and knows his healing power some men that strain to know the Living God it's all right to train them by the word but the letter kill it or the spirit give it life and before we can have this revival God has to call out and train man God trained man to carry this message and they don't care what the opposition is as brother Dilly said last night we meet the devil anywhere anytime any place on any cation we say licks like fire and licks like peas praise God it's licks praise God because God called us to do the same thing Jesus did destroy the works of the enemy hallelujah praise God so watch they are willing to go to the fiery furnace and defeat or to the Lion's Den wherever they may be they're ready to go because they have been in the presence of God and know that he is whether it's a victory defeat they still stand the same that's the same kind of training God does to men is very strange to think that God would do that but God trains his men like that but he does sometime God take a man for 30 years to give him a six months Ministry praise God a long long time for a certain purpose and I believe that all these men of God that stood here and spoke they were sent here here because there are seeds here and shs there that need to be ministered to and you be ministered to this morning so before Pastor ULU comes to minister to us we have a greeting from our precious Brother raymon Thompson uh he will greet Us by video and and we will be blessed by his ministry and I want to say that this whole meeting that you see here is from a conversation I had with him a couple of months ago and that is how this inspiration came uh not to have a team per se but the for the brothers to speak from their heart and I was so grateful to it I said man when he be speak it I said I will do just that I would want to have a meeting and is the first time we having it to see and if you notice even though we didn't have a specific team there is a team you could see between the line what is happening there you could see it for yourself and you know it's God when you see that because nobody tell them what to preach they are feeling led by the spirit that's how we know is God thank you my brother Esau for the testimony God bless to you and your wife praise God thanks for the special so at this time praise God we want to go straight into brother rmons uh greetings to you God bless you praise the Lord so I'd like to take this opportunity to greet the convention in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ on behalf of myself and family and the enti message Believers Church we want to salute T day uh I mean headstone Tabernacle for the faith to have this convention salute our brother Theo brother Isaac their wives and family and The Headstone Tabernacle family God richly bless you for setting up these meetings want to greet all the ministers that's there with the members and also salute all the ministering Brethren that will be preaching may your message be a blessing to the bride across the world God richly bless you I'd like to take scripture from John 1 verse1 17 if you have it these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so uh I'd like to take a little thought here for the convention father the hour is come and Jesus was knew that his ministry was coming to a climax and he realized that his ministry on Earth was finished so he says father now right at this end time when my Ministry is finishing may you glorify me with the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world he he needed something that hour to show the world that he comes from the father and he's going back to the father so I'd like to take a quote here out of the hour has come he says now Jesus was here speaking he said father the hour has come now there's seasons for everything do you believe that you sew in a certain season and you reap in a certain season and there Seasons when the times come that that's right for things to happen do you believe that Hallelujah so you see there's seasons for things to come so you can't sew in the time when you reap so there's a time and a season for everything so I'm just going to run through quickly because of time the hour came for Noah to enter the ark and God shut the door it was too late for anyone to be saved why the hour came for Noah to enter the ark and his family the hour came for Moses to be met at the burning bush and said he heard the cries of my people and I have come down to deliver them Moses LED them out of Egypt with a mighty hand and was and there was a great Deliverance the hour came when Abram had to offer up Isaac as a sacrifice and God was only testing him but Abram came down Hallelujah to his last second Hallelujah and the the Bible says when he came to his last second the angel say stop Abram now I know that you believe me so God is going to test you till the last second brother so we're not here on a picnic we're going to be tested until the last second the hour came for Joshua to meet the captain of the host of the Lord and Joshua drew his sword and he said are you for us or are you against us hallelujah and he said put away your sword I am the captain of the house of the Lord [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he says we got a five star general spelled Jus s placing five stars of Faith he never lost the battle Hallelujah he conquered death he conquered hell get the Devils out of the way he's the great Chief Captain so the devil isn't even in the picture Hallelujah who is this great captain oh I don't I he says I don't look back and see if if doctor so and so I see what the captain said he's the captain of our Salvation hallelujah what is salvation Deliverance Glory he's

have your Bibles I'd like to invite your attention quickly to St Matthew 16 and also 1 Corinthians chapter 2 St Matthew 16 um I read verses 13 to verse 20 vers 13 to 20 and then 1 Corinthians 2: 1-6 Matthew 16: 30- 20 read on these wise when Jesus came into the course of ceria Philippi he asked his disciples whom do man say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou Simon B Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed these unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I see unto thee and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen and whatsoever thou shallal lose on Earth shall be loed in heaven then CH he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ amen and that's scripture um first time the word church is mentioned in the Bible and but this is the Lord himself speaking the one who owns the church The Shepherd of the sheep like Brother D spoke about last night and so he's given us in this scripture here is a little deeper from what brother Benham T us than maybe what regularly people look at but here is giving us a a a a foreshadow of what's going to be in the church ages right here because you'll see we'll get it later but you'll see the three things that must be in every church every Church the New Testament Church of the Lord Jesus Christ and the promise is the gates of a will come against it but we can rest assured it will not Prevail amen 1 Corinthians 2: 1- 16 and I Brethren when I came to you came know with Excellency of speech of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power yes sir that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men Hallelujah but in the power of God yes how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect that would perfect there is people who are mature in understanding in character in Behavior even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God ha prepared for them that love him but God ha revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit such all things yeah the Deep things of godu so that's why we thank God for brother Bram who came and brought some depth to the word of God more than regular Christianity we ordinarily have verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man seeth the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world intellect but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak n in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned you and I were natural men not in the sense that we are Canal there's a difference because we are flesh and blood and in our natur Natural State we can never understand spiritual things to understand spiritual things you need to come up a little higher and that's what he saying here because they're spiritually discerned amen verse 15 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man so we are not natural men here now because Malachi first message is Gospel has revealed unto us had his t step up into that spiritual realm for who had known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the man of Christ amen amen may the Lord add his Blessing the reading of his holy words let's just bow our heads want to prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you once again for Grace to be here this morning Lord what can we say about the services that we have heard Lord has been over way above and beyond Lord this has been the greatest by fire and we just thank you for your goodness for your grace thank you for brother stepan the first day telling us to just ch aside and let you come so that we will can see and testify I wasn't one that did anything but I was only one that was around when he came on the scene I pray you'll come on the scene for us again this morning father bless your people Lord you know we all such a needy people we need you now more than ever before and I pray Lord that you will bypass my mind bypass your people's mind I mean the man of Christ his person his Spirit his theophany of the seven Church ages Minister your word to your people this morning so that at the end of this service we'll crowd like those two on the road to emails did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way speak to us one more time lord and we'll be careful at the end of this service and all the Days of Our Lives as long as you learn us breath to give you alone all the praise honor and worship for we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you may be seated well good morning I think it's still morning good morning just morning is just trying to uh end up so um God bless you TR that it's good to be here again and um um um firstly I full disclosure I'm trying to use these technical things for the first time so I think same brother Theo beside me here oh my sheets fell out so um so but the I'm trying so like brother aan says I'm trying so I I'll try to see how this works but if it doesn't behave I get my not I get my sheets back well God bless you what can we say about these meetings here it's um absolutely over way above and beyond I mean I have no words I have no words at all but firstly I want to appreciate our precious brother Theo over it sister an Mar an an Mar and the family and the Tomato's wonderful heads and Tabernacle for the invitation to be here one more time and to brother Isaac sister Karen we thank you so much for the support that you give and um we appreciate you also very much and the example that you are to so many people around the world we thank you so much to the attending pastors Min and churches I mean this has been the best ever and I just want to say to the pastors ministers whether they here whe they've been through the convention I want to say thank you because those of us that are from out trainer it's a blessing to just see such a free flow of Christian Fellowship from the Brethren the truth is that in our message circles we don't have that everywhere and so we thank you so much for the example trainer that you have been to all of us thank you so very much and to my fellow ministering Brethren they I mean um future speakers and the brothers who give testimonies I want to thank you also for your Ministries and um and really I I feel sorry for myself seriously um I think tonight would even have been a better time to speak really but you come after last night so but I actually had a deal with brother Jesse he was too because he he he didn't he still had some more so he was to take over this morning so uh brother JC is the deal on brother JZ don't deny me now brother what a set of meetings we have had from the first service I Mo fail I mean all the testimonies have been tremendous but I mustn't fail to acknowledge brother Shem the first the first day the Holy Spirit actually used him to set the platform and brother Stefanos came to tell us about the platform what can you say about brother [Applause] Stefanos M and then brother JC spoke one for the ages one for the [Applause] ages and brother Dana brother Dana thank you for coming and um I mean I've known brother Daner for for for a while now um because I met him through brother Alfred Davidson and um but we were together in at brother Peter Chandler's funeral and he we had a great time we had a great time together fellowship and just sweet Fellowship there's nothing like when Believers are together there's no no walls just Fellowship together and just enjoy one another's presence in their father's presence thank you brother Dan for your ministry for what you do and what you do all over the world thank you so much and thank you for your ministry yesterday morning it was tremendous extending out standing thank you brother Paula I call him the lion of Civ brother JC actually told him before we came here that brother Paul please don't bring the house down brother Paul thank you so much I mean you're always a blessing you can stay still when brother Paul is preaching and it was such a blessing yesterday amen and Brother D told you that that when we're in the room and he he was saying that um everything has been preached the ministers and all that so I said if you are seing that and I am coming after you so you can understand how I feel sorry for myself was it I was stand last night brother B thank you for the Del that was really really tremendous really tremendous what amazes me more than anything is how he does it without notes first time I mean we were together train here 2018 I asked him how do you do it and he tried to tell me how how I it still doesn't I still can't process it and brother Jason and I were talking yesterday he was here about almost one hour no notes if I have to do that you'll fall asleep because after 5 minutes I'm asking you so where was I so where was I brother da just goes on and on and on what a blessing Lord thank you brother D thank you so much so this morning I will um I mean I will try not to hold you on to long I mean I I will try don't don't um no I'm fine really so this morning I'll try not to hold you up too long um but I got a chle God in simplicity and um what have what I found very outstanding about the services because brother the brother the had said it a few years ago that he wants to get to the spot where for his conventions the ministers are free to preach what's on their hearts so this year I asked what was the theme he said no no theme just pre what's in your heart but you will see the Holy Spirit had a theme and all the messages DED to one another and Frankly Speaking because we all preach from the same Source the message of Malachi for so it's not unusual to have you know notes and messages you know run to one another like that and that's just been the tremendous thing about this convention here so I'll try to put my Shir at the wheel and speak a little bit on God and simplicity um and brother banham on the on the seals um the first thing he did March 177 Sunday morning 1963 was a pray the message God in Simplicity and God is so simple that human beings tumble over the Simplicity if it's so high up there it can be that simple but God created us and he knows we don't even have the capacity to to to to process his being so he knows the only way he can give us a chance to understand him at all is to come down and be the simple God that we understand him to be from brother Ben message because things of the spirit and the spiritual are a little complex for us human beings to understand and appreciate we can't appreciate them we can understand them like you said the natural man these things are are spiritually designed so he can never understand them we're natural Paul said I'm natural no good thing in me and we are wired mostly to see things before we understand them like they'll tell you that even when you hear things it's better if it's audiovisual when you can hear and see we we we do better when we see things don't be so hard on Thomas I mean Thomas disciple because Thomas said until I see the nail prince in his hands and I touch his sight I will not believe it if you and I were there we might even do worse because we are wired to believe only when we see but God is a spirit so how do you see God hallelujah should you help [Applause] us God knows I cannot meet these people for them to understand me in that realm they will never understand me because the things of the spirit are not easy for man to understand they are mysterious to man like we read in 1 Corinthians 2 and let me read verse 14 16 again but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually designed but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who had known the man of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the man of Christ so he's telling us that even though we're in this body of Flesh we are not natural beings like that because we are God's children so we have the man of Christ so we can design and understand these spiritual things amen so God because he a Creator amen he knows that the things of the spirit and the natural things are not easy for us to understand knowing KN that God's whole being and purpose is to make the spirit and spiritual things easy for us to understand easy for us to appreciate Jesus with his disciples many when he will speak to them they can't get him so he will call them aside and break it down for them some more till when he was going away and he spoke to them about his going away they said now we understand you amen that's right so God that's why his nature is to simplify and break things down so we humans can understand somebody says now I don't understand God God has broken it down so much that anyone can understand he's not a complex God he's a simple God Amen and so all of the seemingly complex things about him about nature about all of his creation it simplifies and breaks them down so that we can understand and it's a principle in life the most impressive companies in the business World The Secret the TR secret is that they simplify things that's right when when when I not when I was growing up like maybe like 20 years ago you couldn't get your 10 year-old to work on your computer it was too complex you know this and all it was too complex but right now your one yearold will take an iPad and enter himself he would even password you don't know what's going on because it's so simple why did they together from from the scriptures from God even though they don't know it but that's where it's coming from because you look in all nature that's why God said to make us understand he said nature itself is your teacher and when you look in nature you can on brother bham said if you look in nature and you don't see God look again because God wants to make it so impossible for you not to see him not to understand so he makes even nature to scream at you about the person and the nature of God Amen so it's God's nature to break things down so that man can understand and there's so many things that we human beings cannot properly appreciate and comprehend when they're in whole for example I just want to show you examples here so God breaks them down for us and those things are wired into nature number number one a whole year is 365 days and it's 366 days in a liia every four years when we come at the entrance of a new year as far as God is concerned all that he is like doesn't even come to a minute that's right it sees it all he sees it sees all the way into eternity forever oh Lord th word is settled is sees into endless eternity but we can even see one day so God to help us appreciate the year he broke the year down for us into days and weeks and months to help us further he breaks the day down into hours and minutes and seconds that's how much our capacity can take we can't take anything more than that God God wants us to [Music] understand amen can you say amen amen I'm only talking to you and I really mean that because um there's nothing more to preach really no I'm fine I'm I'm I'm fine the minister has always encourage you so they they I'm fine so they so I'm I'm I'm encouraged I mean God also goes further in everything in nature I just want to show you a few examples he breaks down complex things in nature for example the whole human body he breaks it down can you imagine you and I came from a simple seed imagine if we were born this way it could not be but but it's God's wisdom he hid our members into that single cell from Mom and Dad and he hid all our members in there like Solomon said in Ecclesiastes who hit my bones in the womb can you imagine the way you are called up in the womb the bones like that that's the wisdom of God God in simplicity making it so simple that your mom and dad can have you and bring you into this wall here God's great wisdom amen amen amen and you could go on and on but you get the drift you get the you get the picture and no wonder Deuteronomy 29 and verse 29 says the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever but the secret things belong unto God the things that we know now would have remained secret if God did not make them simple for us to understand Hallelujah yes sir so that background Jesus said St John 4:23 and vers 24 God is the spirit Hallelujah and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth in other words the only way you worship God is in by spirit and by truth the spirit and the word because Thy word is truth what's he saying here God like you those of us in the message know God is a spirit everybody says that but brother Bram taught us hallelujah about these stages of Christian growth and experience let us understand and appreciate God at a deep richer level that we can apply to our lives amen John said in first John I have written unto you little children because you have known the father I written unto you young men because the word of God abides in you I WR to you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning and you repeated it and added a bit more I know to you young men I mean little children because you have known the father I know to you little children because the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the wicked one I WR on to you fathers because you know him that is from the beginning knowing the father and knowing him that's from the beginning there are two different things the little children just know God maybe they give their hearts to the Lord and that's it but the young men go into the study of the world they are getting the word they reading the word and they are becoming stronger and stronger and stronger so they can fight the devil and keep the devil at B but where the real maturity is is Fathers and I don't have to be a father naturally to get to that spot it's just talking about Christian growth and maturity fathers who have known him that is from the beginning that's different from knowing the father and William bram's message presented to us God Hallelujah in the beginning before the beginning before the world ever was that's who the fathers are so this message was structured sent from God Almighty to bring you to maturity to bring you to Christian maturity so you can understand spiritual things Hallelujah can you shout hallelujah hallelujah amen amen God the great eternal spirit just let me take your mind back because we Are Spiritual now we are fathers in the gospel because Malachi for mage brought us to that level not because of anything that we've done there's nothing of ourselves but because he here his grace showed his grace CH us before the foundation of the world and nothing is going to PLU us out of his hands and so we can understand these things we can appreciate these things we know that God sent that Prophet Amen to take us into the Realms of the unknown Realms of the Unseen to where we can see God Amen in his glory hallelujah amen Elohim the great eternal spirit amen that's who who God is God is a spirit before the foundation of the world but we could not see him we could not appreciate spiritual spiritual things we can't do that so when you say God can descended to a flesh and became the word we think that's just what no it's God want to help us to understand him right amen so God with desires on his mind to have sons and daughters who will be like him who will be in his very image and knowing that we will never understand him if he was to reveal himself to us in his Spirit form so he condescended great eternal spirit he contracted himself that's what con means he just mean like he came down he contracted himself contracted himself into a body call the word when you are getting to the word now then is where you can because God made us he knows our medium of communication is by words so even though this be a spiritual body word but it's the word and the Bible tells us is at this part that God could make an image how do you capture the image of a spirit you could never do it so God condescended contracted himself into into the word form so that man can begin to get an idea of who he is that's whatam said but because God in Simplicity coming down to you and coming down to our level so that we might hon understand him I appreciate him and be able to have a relationship with him God knows he could never have a relationship with us if he stays in his Spirit form he comes right down amen so what he did he condescended and formed himself into a body of Flesh and that he did that in two steps first Elohim the spirit disguised himself as the lust word if you don't know that is God you'll say who is talking that's what they did to Jesus because Jesus disg God Elohim disguised himself Hallelujah and came on the earth and they did not know who he was because the natural man thinks if God want to come he will have this good train around him but God condescending to Men of low estate so that they can appreciate and know that's God that's God that's God oh hallelujah hallelujah so firstly Elohim the spirit disguised himself as the as the lust word the seven P Holy Spirit Elohim disguised himself as the word of theophany he poured himself all of himself his seven spirits into a spirit body called the theophany the logos the word of God the spirit what body it's still Spirit but it's a body we against somewhere and when he got that body there then a body has a certain form not like this body here but it has a certain form Hallelujah when Moses said Lord show me thy Glory hallelujah hallelujah but B said the glory of God the theophany of God signs wonders Miracles he said Mo I hide you in the Rock and then you'll see my back patch when I go back past and Moses saw him he saw he said it was like the back parts of a man he has a certain form and brother said that's a theophany Hallelujah MC yes sir Hallelujah who made Abraham returning from his of the Kings it was M it was a theophany before he became Jesus Christ so he had a form so a theop had a form that we could capture and get an image of it let us make man in our image after our likeness he could never make an image of a spirit so he had to condescend to become the body the word body and then you can make an image of that Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you may be seated and then number two this theophany word the lus the spirit word was be flesh and dwelt Among Us God going through a process for man to meet him to see him to talk with him to touch him have fellowship with him imagine God coming as a spirit people even you can't even stand it it dwells in in in in unapproachable light that's why Jesus said no man had seen God at any time only the the Barden of the father has shown you has expressed him has declared him God Amen in Simplicity Hallelujah coming down to our level that's why the Bible says though the Lord be high yet have he respect unto the lowly that's God's spirit that's his nature and that's what said you want to see how far you can get with God see how much humbler you can get oh that's why I C oh Lord make me the Revival the Revival in me make me more more humbler more dedicated more consecrated servant more positive more looking to the things that in the positive amen I'm forgetting the negative in the pastall so Jesus when he was here that was the spirit of God that was God the spirit became the lest word put on flesh and when he finish his job Jesus said I the word hallelujah I come from God to God and I go back to God again let's examine that I am the word I come from God the spirit I come from Spirit became the word and I'm going back to the word again I to the spirit again so he's telling you and I I come from Spirit to the word and I go back to the spirit form he not saying I'm going to go and sit on a chair next door to my father no I go back to the fatherhood the pill of fire that was through the Old Testament I go back in that form but no you haven't heard me yet the good part is that it's because of you he said because if I go another way the spirit will not come so because of you and I that's why he went away back into the spirit form so the spirit can come and on that understanding he told them go into Jerusalem hallelujah amen hallelujah because I'm going to come again yet a little while and the W shall not see me but you shall see me for I will be in you I will be with you even in you until the end of the world because it was going to come back as a spirit on the day of pentec because oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah what he was doing here what he was doing here he was sh as a pattern because Jesus is only the firstborn among many Brethren many Brethren he's a first he a god he's a father he's a big brother is our bridegroom is our [Applause] everything so he had shown us that everyone that comes from God goes through that you come from Spirit to the word and back to Spirit again that's what this journey is all about that's why you could never be a Christian of the flesh it just is not going to work it's not going to work amen you may be seated Oh Glory so Jesus showed us our journey from Spirit to word back to Spirit again and the reason he had to go back was so that he could make a way possible for all of us to be there remember when he rose from the dead and Mary the the sister saw him like brother dang say they I never saw that before they they went with ounding fluidall to keep him there and they they I mean they they they loved him it was love that did it but that love was full of unbelief so when they saw him they wanted to touch him don't touch don't touch me don't touch me yes sir don't touch me before you can touch me before you can handle me and see I've got to go to my father Hallelujah and your father my God and your [Applause] God so I'm doing this for you Hallelujah because if I don't go away the spirit of the word that have taught you for three and a half years the spirit cannot come to turn you back into Spirit again if I don't go away the spirit will not come it's expedient it's obligatory it's necessary it's important that are go away or you remain in the same shape Jesus is telling us you need the spirit Hallelujah of God oh hallelujah amen that's the pattern so let's sumarize and summarize and recap here in Jesus Christ God the spirit became the word amen and became flesh amen and back to speed again I come from God I go back to God Amen why so that he can make sons of God like unto himself that's the purpose that's the purpose until he does that the purpose he died for to become the Good Shepherd of the sheep will not be complete so that he will make you and I Sons like unto himself because it was God's original son God's example s son and that's how the first Adam was made the first Adam how was he made just the same way because Jesus was formed in elohim's mind before the fish of the world because the Lamb of God was slain before Adam ever came so this process had gone on in God's mind he had figured out and plan it all out so Adam was displayed on the earth before Jesus but Adam came here a patent son like after [Music] Jesus where some of our brothers get it wrong and say that Adam you know I mean people you know people said you know Jesus bypass his theophany no he did not Adam bypass his theophany Hallelujah that's so Jesus came from Spirit to word back to Spirit again in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the world was made flesh and dwelt among us when you come from there he said we beheld his glory the glor as of the only begotten of the father but Adam the image of God that word form God could form an image of the world so Adam was not the worth the offering Adam was an image of the word Adam was a word image the image of the world but Jesus was the expression of God himself there's a difference there amen well let's move along amen [Applause] but Adam went the same way from the [Applause] word elohim's spirit and Adam as a seting there plugged out and quited in the image of the world and then that image of the word was dropped into Eden dropped on the earth Genesis 1 the image of a seven Spirit word was placed in Adam's soul and in his soul was the spirit of Elohim but was a little seed of perfection in there the spirit contracted and condescended into Adam's soul and then then then because when you understand that God is only expressing himself to where we can understand him then you'll know you are not supposed to be a Christian of the flesh but a Christian of the spirit and when that is understood from Adam's example God expanded the word in Adam into Spirit Hallelujah when he put him in a body of Flesh the word image in Adam's Soul was expanded and anointed into his flesh to make him the word mid flesh and I'm a God on the face of the Earth because that was the original plan and Remains the plan even right [Applause] now and as it got on the earth Adam had come from Spirit to word the the word expounded into Spirit again and was placed in a body of fath the spirit of God was anointed into the Flesh of man amen that Spirit was in his soul as the word but it exploded expanded Beyond his soul into his Spirit into his flesh So Adam could walk around and this was God an amate God on the face of the Earth the spirit of God anointed into the Flesh of man that is the pattern oh Hallelujah as they got on the face of the Earth Adam had the Earth for an in inheritance he was a spirit man living a body of Flesh amen not a natural man not a canal man but a spiritual man who could design all things Hallelujah yet himself is Judge of no man the prince of this world cometh and he can find no place in me to do his evil work to do his evil thinking amen am thank you Jesus So Adam as a God on the earth he had the Earth for an inheritance and Adam was only the first one display play on the face of the Earth here sir and to prove his ownership he the ttle deed to the Earth The Book of Life In His Hands Hallelujah and spiritual men compare spiritual things with spiritual it runs through the whole Bible you don't get a Doctrine based upon one thing that's why I mean personally I don't do no quote words with anybody because you can make the quot say anything you want to say and these days of AI too you better know where you're standing a I will generate brother bram's voice for you and make him say things he did not say oh he never thought of that dark side of Technology but it doesn't matter to you when you know that it's not just based upon one thing you're running through the scriptures like brother J said last night he was F himself just said okay he passed this test pass this test but that crown on the head he doesn't line up from Genesis to Revelation So Adam had the Book of Life the tled it in his hands because brother bam said and I think you know I mean some read the quote yesterday and which you know those things I mean we're only trying to remind you of these things brother bham said Adam was absolutely a God on the face of the Earth you believe that and he said Adam lost the he said he had the title deed show me in Genesis where Adam had the title deed look at show me where it is show me where it says like that okay so Adam had the T he's going around Eden I have the T lead come to my house I'll bring out the drawer and show you like this is my titled it but he that is spiritual judges all things comparing spiritual things with spiritual can somebody say [Applause] amen amen when was that title dided Adam was told you have access to all every tree in the garden but one you don't have access to you should not touch I'm not going to force you is a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but every other tree you can do anything he was veiling in there how access to the tree of life that was his ttle that was where the the contents the terms of the agreement was written have that in his hand didn't mean like he went to the tree and grabbed him because you know the tree was Jesus Christ you didn't grab him like that no he had access he was open to him when he say I have access it's open to you it's not closed he had access to that tree to the content to the terms of the mortgage Hallelujah so to prove his ownership Adam had the title to the Earth The Book of Life In His Hands meaning he had complete access to all the entitlements and brother Pam said on the seals Adam before the fall he was absolutely totally a God on the face of the Earth am how was this possible he came from Spirit in Elohim toward image back to Spirit again absolute Authority on the face of the Earth but Adam could speak Adam could name Adam could do whatever he he he wanted to do because he had the tle in his hand but then Adam Lost It All by sin his wife gave to the devil's reasoning and all access to the tree book of life T did was denied him access denied have you ever gone to the bank and you go there and they say there's a leon on your account access denied no withdrawal no withdrawal you can't get a thing so so you'll understand that this Bible this book of symbols am the benefit that we have that God sent us a prophet that can make the Bible come alive for us brother Bram made the word of God present tense to where you can relate to it it's not a story book it's a living word hallelujah Glory Glory oh hallelujah amen So Adam lost all access to the book to the title date to the tree of life he just lost his way he just lost he just didn't he just lost it but how did he lose access maybe see that he lost the access because God protected the title deed the tree of life and all its contents so that Adam will not be able to touch it in the state that he was in in the state he was before perfect perfection amen you know I've had it said like that you know how could Adam fall when he was perfect God's program because Lucifer was perfect he said you were perfect until in his ways until iniquity was found in thine heart so coming to Perfection doesn't give you an inability not to sin but gives you a power not to sin and that's the tattoo the will Lucifer gave his will away because he had sin creep into his heart oh Hallelujah So Adam how Adam lost access God protected the Tree of Life the title dead and all his contents by placing kobams on the back of the book The Eastern path now the Bible said God drove Adam out and said L the man the man has become as one of us knowing good and evil didn't mean like he's become like God like like like in that realm because God said let's make my an image so it was like God but he say it's become like one of all because Adam had no awareness of sin and wrong before that time but he had added this filthy Thing by going his own way that's what God means become like one of us so he not he's not something to desire [Music] So Adam the man is like one of us L he put forth his hands and touch of the Tree of Life God said no we got to keep that from happening and then he put kobams on the Eastern path of Eden kobams with a flaming sword to protect the way of the Tree of Life hallelujah hallelujah and that's the spot right there when the book went back to the hands of the original owner he closed access and you'll go right down and see the book in Revelation 5 in the hands of Orin closed book it happened in Genesis and there the book remained until I day hallelujah hallelujah but God showed in different types and shadows through the Old Testament years what all of these represented like last night brother Dy was speaking so I mean mindblowing stuff about the Covenant and the cross going with them all the time do you realize that was God showing in type those kobams that's right at the back of the book it said the Eastern Eastern path Eastern G this is The Book of Life as we are sitting here now as we sitting here now from from my uh context here that's the north this is the South this is the West this is the East and the eastern part is the backside hallelujah hallelujah that's where those angels are so when you get into revation fact and you see I saw I mean saw either son there was a book in his hand written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals you know where is talking about that's why like brother de explained to us last night you couldn't touch Israel you couldn't crush them you couldn't put any enchantment on them hallelujah hallelujah so God showed this carobs on the backside in different types and shadows of the Bible amen the Old Testament like Brother D said representing the Redemption amen amen for Israel amen represented by the tree of life and those kobs angels representing the spirit of God Amen he was the spirit of God that stood there those angels Kims it didn't tell us how many they were but if you compare spiritual to spiritual you go to Revelation 5 and see the book in his hand and run about The Throne are those four beasts those four anointings in the North in the south in the West in the East Hallelujah are you with me and all through the Old Testament years the spirit of God will come down upon different ones for specific purposes showing the grace and the power veiled in the Redemption that Adam lost the grace and the power that he lost but not one of them came close to what Adam had in the Garden of Eden that was left for this day for this day Hallelujah that was left until the second Adam came Hallelujah Oh Glory so you notice I just want to emphasize this there was a tree of life and there were kobams on the back of the Tree of Life seven SE within inside the tree of life and seven sails on the back side amen making 14 Sals no the prophet Malachi fores showed us said six seals the seven seal silence my Brother Dan masterfully Brother yesterday but underneath that silence who had the authority but the prophet to take those seeds on the backside and put them inside the seventh written seal where it said silence he put He said he said it was silence in heaven but you know I know is the seven thunders in the book that's put in there Hallelujah am amen hallelujah hallelujah so we have the Tree of Life in Eden we have the tree of life back in amen Revelation again all through the Bible in the hands of original owner waiting for Redemption claims who is worthy to take the book and to lose the seven SE thereof who's worthy to do it can you do it hallelujah hallelujah no wonder they no wonder John weped knew this was how we got kicked out of Eden and John knew and John that's you know that the only way back to Eden the P Glory of Eden is somebody can take this book here and and get those angels in the back away from there and get us back into the tree of life again that's why John wept and the Elder cried don't weep John the lion of the tribe of Judah he had prevailed to take the book and to lose the seven SE thereof they went his teral did you hear what they said we are going back to Eden now they said we shall rain on the earth once he took the book that's it we shall rain on the earth we shall rain on the earth hallelujah oh brother amen excuse me can I remove my jacket you may be seated no man could pay the price until the second Adam came hallu so this is redemption problem with many of us in the message is we don't understand what we're talking about is not salvation is Redemption full total [Applause] [Music] [Applause] complete we can talk great stuff until we get a challenge like brother Esau told you about this morning when we get a challenge we running heal Skelter our faith flies away but if you watch brother brandham he lived in the realm to where Faith was just as normal as breathing for him he praised and no matter what happens he knows he's going to go if there's anything God will tell him maybe you need to get this sin out this out or whatever God in is that a complex God so when the second Adam came I don't want to go over all the things massively bother like I could never do when second Adam came he qualified to pay the price he was a king's man he was worthy and all the requirements NE for a kinsman redeemer amen he qualified to pay the to pay the price and to get back full and unfed access back to the tree of life again Amen to the ttle de to give us back full to Redemption so we can go back to where Adam was what a what a what a privileged people we are we are the ones that it has come down to that we can go back to Eden oh Hallelujah they without us cannot be made perfect oh Hallelujah Glory I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to wind down amen I'm not I'm not finished I'm trying to wind outall in closing in closing but that's how we used to do when you he enclosing that's 2 hours more and it used to be a time like when you know we had our churches heart when you hear enclosing that's me I swe from here till here said enclosing is down to my knees we now en closing is down to my feet then we can close that takes like 6 hours 6 hours 6 hours of a short message but we we we we're growing we we're learning so when the second Adam came God but Man Came Death Hallelujah and by man came also the resurrection from the dead one man sinned like in the Old Testament they'll say like that why should one man did something wrong and then the whole whole place is judged that's the story of redemption one man sinned Israel was judged one man paid the price we are all free we don't have to go and die on the cross again the wisdom of God just receive it Glory Glory [Applause] Glory so when the second Adam came he qualified to pay the prize to get back full and unfettered access to the book for us Lord and what is it those angels are there Hallelujah at the back of the book it will take somebody who had the price like brother Del said lift up your head all he gets ACC say was the night here it was closed it would take somebody who had paid the price who was qualified to go there and remove those shes on the back of the book William bham couldn't do it no man could do it only one could do it that's why the lamb has prevailed to take the book and tear open those seals on the back and those angels will open up for him and he will go right in into the terms and the contents amen the terms of agreement of of your of your mortgage your title date to the earth oh Hallelujah he will take those angels on the back of the book representing the fullness of the spirit of God to provide that access and take somebody who the gates will open to and so when Christ second Adam died and paid the price to get the book to get the title back back for us he got the book back and that's why you see the book amen open in Revelation 10 Hallelujah but he still stayed even though he had paid the price and access to the book is now open he did not give it back to us right away like he did to Adam because Adam he said of every tree in the garden including the Tree of Life the tell you can go there anytime Adam he was ready made for God I mean for Adam but he didn't do you this time Hallelujah He restored those angels on the back represent the fullness of the spirit what are those angels brother bam showed us there they are in Revelation 5 there they were brother Del show you yesterday showed you the the tribal arrangements and in there it showed you the anointings Through the Ages showed you Luke and Martin and and all that and things like that and brother bham show those angels that beasts the powers amen through seven Church ages God's spirit so God's going to let it drip through seven Church AG upon this work I will build my church so this is the building here he doing the building he didn't give the access right away but restor the fullness of the spirit into the church through seven dispensational Church ages how the same way the spirit of God disguised as the word of God every messenger of the age Hallelujah was representing a portion of a spirit of God to their age the mystery of Christ they represented it and they came in the ages amen and came as a word message and they received the word message the seeds of God the seeds of God in that Age receive that word what were they receiving like Adam it was the spirit of God condescending cont to word and just like you saw the pattern like Jesus showed us they receive the word you can receive the word he said if the word be received it has got to be manifested and the manifestation is the holy spirit that's where brother benam is coming from where he said every age have the mechanics the word and the Dynamics for their age Adam had it for his age [Applause] Adam Genesis 126 was his mechanics Genesis 27 was his Dynamics to anoint the spirit of God into his [Music] flesh so in every age the spirit was there it was this Spirit to drive you back to the Tree of Life hallah Hallelujah he didn't drive them back and they got everything they know little by little he was driving them back to the Tree of Life Hallelujah and send messenger with a portion of that Spirit go out to the people with the mystery of God God said the mystery of God should be finished it was all through seven Church ages oh Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory so what you be seated I'm I'm I'm trying to wind on here seriously if you tickle me I'll go on brother Jesse if you tickle me I'll add one more hour all right but you f show your Redemption so here was the king man Redeemer he had won it back the book went to his hand but Redemption claims need to be made that's right somebody who could access that book and take that book that's I paid the price for this and our Kingsman Redeemer did it he gave his life share his blood PID the price so that we could he had W it back for us they R back to that tree of life he had W it back for us but he wasn't going to do it the way he did it before just was D there because the problem for Adam was he didn't need to grow Adam was just made in a Hallelujah perfect state it need to grow Hallelujah the spirit of God was just there seven spirits of God on the inside of him Perfection was on the inside of him that's why even though he was in a perfect State he didn't really appreciate so much what he had definitely not Eve so Jesus God himself said this time around we're going to take them through a process of growth we're going to grow them from church age to church age to church age to church age and the same way we are going to grow the individuals in every Church age same way because the way he grows his IND idual is the way he grows his church ages that's why you're not going to grow overnight it's going to take time it takes discipline consecration dedication you're not going to put it like AI let me grow and become a stature of a perfect man it's not going to work that way some things in life just take time relationships take time no AI is not going to make it a woman deliver in two months no it's not going to happen some things take time Hallelujah growth takes time that's why he did not give you to us all at once going to be like little here a little there a little so that the church WIll mature will become seasoned seasoned season in character character growing in them growing in Grace into the stature of Jesus Christ Hallelujah GL but what was it it was the spirit of God disgu as the word message in Paul's age in arenus age in Martin all down through the Old Testament I mean through the New Testament Church ages Jesus building his church Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I don't have to go over that but show he Dem marketed that devil last night Dem marketed him sh I will tell you no more it's easy for me to say this after last night the devil is not even in the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] picture so what was it God was rest showing back the fullness of the spirit in the church ages through seven dispensations of the seven churches God sending the fullness of the spirit down in seven steps through the church ages not in one hole as he did with Adam where did Brother bham get this from show me in the Bible where he got this from Hallelujah yeah Glory because people say I want a quote I won't make brother B my absolute the Bible is my absolute good good Bible scholar very good like brother J was yesterday just Jonah in I never saw that Jonah in the belly of a of a fish oh go and tell them in your in your exam that a whale is a fish and tell them that whale is a mammal is a mammal is in our class of category it's not it's not not so so let's we are talking spiritual things now among spiritual people this brother Bram got that here hallelujah in Paul's age he's releasing s of the spirit the spirit of God Came Upon Paul as the messenger to that age to show him the message for the hour like brother de said the pill of fire speaking to Paul running through the whole Bible and brought a message out Hallelujah he wrote almost the entire New Testament the spirit of God condescending into a word message disg as a word message in Ephesians Church age and it went on into arenus amen Colombia Wesley and all the way down God adding one more one more one more adding more and more and more but they all left Loose Ends [Music] hallu so God Through the Ages the Fulfillment of the words of Jesus Upon This Rock of the reation of who Jesus is your Redeemer your lord I will build my church and it's going to be a building you don't build it one day it was building this through seven Church ages hallah and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it they boil them in hot oil they cut off their heads amen like brother Jesse was saying the other night all kinds of things but the church kept marching on hallelujah hallelujah the devil is no match not because of us but greater is he that is in us than the devil in the world that's trying to stop us he cannot stop you he cannot stop the bride all right so Jesus did it the way so we can grow and not have it dropped on our laps like it was dropped on Adam's laps so we want Freer either way because easy come easy go amen amen so the church ages so we can mature the church can mature the IND can mature and grow growing up into Christ and develop character how be will speak wisdom among them that are perfect among them that are maturing in christall oh hallelujah amen amen so since before God built in this growth and so every age had the word every church had the word but in not in full but a portion of the word and the spirit of God to anoint that word for a manifestation because they had to go from Spirit the spirit of God in the age like Paul's Faith the spirit of Faith the mystery of Faith Hallelujah and Paul went and let the found all the way right back down to the man of God and laid it down all the way down to the new city that's right but Paul died I think 8060 or 865 or somewhere around there but the church was still moving on so each age had the Spirit come upon the messenger and it the spirit dis guys as the word message to the age but it means nothing until that word goes back to Spirit for a manifestation that's why he said every age had the mechanics the word and the Dynamics the word back into Spirit again every age had it Luther had the mechanics and Dynamics for his day Wesley had them the Pentecostals had them how about day he said the BR should be fully grown up Hallelujah ready to go meet Christ with the manifestation of every divine blessing that he promised in the world Hallelujah shout hallelujah oh Hallelujah Glory so each age had his mechanics and Dynamics may be seated amen as Jesus actually foreshadowed in that great discussion in s Matthew 13 who do Man say that I the son of man I am the son of man representing the word in every age who do men say that I this a man some say you are Jeremiah some say you are this and some say you are that but who do ye the spiritual ones sh that I am thank you Lord and Peter said thou the son of man Thou Art the Christ Christ the son of the Living God is a revelation in there put together with the me from Malachi 4ah what is it that conversation was not just for them it was a conversion that covered all seven Church ages hallelujah what is it each age like I'm trying to explain had the word very the son of man to the age the word to the age which you know the word is the spirit to that age disguise as the Worden as the message of that age so each it had the the word the son of man each it had the Christ the anointing the spirit to the word and each age the mechanics and Dynamics together produced the son of God in the church ages that's how you come about the son Jesus he was son of man when he came he was Son of God through the church ages that's how it [Applause] come so each age had son of man who do Man say that I the son of man am thou are the Christ each had son of man Christ the anointing son of man the mechanics the word Christ the anointing the Dynamics to the mechanics and together produced the son of God the seed of God in that age every age had that every age had that son of man the Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah hallelujah oh every age has the mechanics and Dynamics for their day oh Hallelujah glory glory on the St of a prophet man brother bam said add to your faith because is build is the way he builds his church is the way he builds individuals at to your faith virtue out to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge Temperance to your Temperance patience to your patience godliness to your godliness brotherly love to your Brotherly Love listen Hallelujah the holy spirit amen and Christ will come hallelu Hallelujah in Paul's age the mystery of Faith was there but he say add to that the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit running through the church what was it friends the baptism of the Holy Ghost the spir the spirit of Christ was in every Church age as the baptism of the Holy Ghost because Jesus said amen behold I give you h go to Jerusalem and and T there a while until you be indeed from with power from an ey and when the power comes you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you and you shall be my Witnesses in every one of those ages to your body love add the Holy Spirit and Christ will come because just beneath him here it is just beneath him is the Spirit of Jesus Christ amen into the church to manifest those virtues Hallelujah in every age the spirit of God comes there to manifest the virtues to manifest Faith to manifest knowledge to manifest Temperance the spirit of Christ was in every age as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I say the spirit of Christ is here today as the baptism of the Holy Ghost to baptize your soul to baptize you with fire to bur every demon out of you is here right now [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah you may be seated the spirit of christall thank you Jesus thou are the Christ hallah who do Man say that I the son of man I am Hallelujah the word thou are the Christ the spirit of Christ into the church to manifest these virtues manifest Faith manifest knowledge virtue all the way down and produce a Son of God in the age the mechanics and Dynamics for every age and they without us could not be made perfect oh brother [Applause] so every you send messenger after messenger after messenger up until Le sent a messenger after messenger after messenger and they went the spirit of God upon those Messengers went to the age with a message the spirit disguised as the word message to the age the Mist of what it's all been brother bam said on Christ The Mystery of God revealed he never shows his mystery in full but when he ended he goes and shows you the mystery of all you know the mystery of Faith the mystery of virtue the mystery of knowledge the mystery of temperance the mystery of godness and brotherly kindness the mystery when I'm talking like this are you trying to let me leave that on so it came to a day William brandham was the messenger to Le this year and same way he said this men had no certain mystery Paul had the mystery of Faith to go and go all the way down to the bibleall and reveal the entire book write the new t arenus Martin all the way down when he came to Malachi for the brotherly can's age Leia he said this messenger has no certain mystery but what he has is to go all the way back and tap all the Loose Ends the things that they left like brother de said last night Luther said the Jews are Antichrist Luther will smoke a cigar and yet he was Messenger to the age but this is were not open to them so all those loose ends this Messenger to Le this here had no certain certain but just like John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ to make the high places low to make the low Valleys High Malachi for was sent to make the high places low make the low Valleys High to go all the way down and dig up all the Los ends and tie them up so there'll be no leakage anywhere in the building make the place ready for the coming of the Lord hallelujah as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ so you have been sent to forun the second coming you have to tie up those losen to make the high places Low Low Places high so the Lord can come down himself and that's why he said to you that's why I said to you this angel had no set mystery all he needed to do was to reveal the six seal mystery Hallelujah not seven seal mystery seven seal is Christ to reveal the six seal Myster let let me read it to you let see hallu Hallelujah I'm sorry I'm almost done actually all right all right talking about this age here because don't get Mali for mix mix up brother Braham in place was representing Elijah and he also was representing son of man Jesus Christ your Redeemer to take you back to Eden because we are the ones upon whom the ends of the world has come and Jesus it is coming but is not going to really appear in flesh until I mean in in physical form until the Trump of God so he have to find a body to use but we'll get to that in a minute hallu but this is malach for as the messenger to Le this here hallelujah on the message influence where where is okay on the message influence 0803 96 3 and God is sending gifts to try to create in us a faith that will move us out of here someday into a Rapture yes now Eden going back to Eden is not on this side of the Rapture Eden is on the other side of the Rapture and William brandham cannot take you in the Rapture only Jesus can take you in the Rapture get me real good so we got to have a faith that will move us out of here to go in the Rapture Healing The Sick opening the eyes of the blind raising up the dead Great Signs in the heaven above Angels coming in constellation and scientists looking off at it predicted months before it happened there it was there is in the magazine 12 months before it happened seven angels come down and said the complete revelation of the six seal mystery of God will be unfolded were you six or seven seals that's what the brothers Miss and say only sixes were revealed [Music] and there it was just exactly like he said predicted before it happened so when he came down January 17 to 20 to 23 1963 I mean 17 to 24 1963 he stepped out there and open upj the six heals let me give you another one proving his word 8664 paragraph 271 you believe we are living in the last days when the son of man was to be manifested yes like I told you the son of man was through the church ages but in our age he veiled in the messenger the son of man is the word th will be listen listen that will be all all the world that's gathered up through Luther Wesley Baptist and all that and the Pentecostals all gathered upall to the revelation of all is all been I was only the one standing there when he came you're not feeding on a man you are feeding on the unfailing body word body the word that has been in the body the word that was in Paul's age Faith the word that was in arenus age the word that in all through the body you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man through seven Church ages because malach for tired of the losing there's no losing anywhere the devil can't play no games with us because the mystery has been revealed the mystery of God has been finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets Hallelujah say hallelujah somebody shout hallelujah [Music] that will be all the word that's gathered up in the body word of a son of man through Luther Wesley Baptist and all that and the Pentecostals all gathered up to the revelation of what it has all all been all been Mal forame hallah son of man veil in him to go around and just check it out what did Paul leave out what did Martin leave out what did arenus leave out just sock it all up into the son of man because the son of man is going to do something right here in this end time here what is it the seventh angel here it is again was to open the six seal mystery it's all to be gathered up in the son of man the unfailing body word of a son of man unfailing body word hallelujah it's ought to be gathered up in the unfailing I mean it's got to be gathered up in the son of man hallelujah what is it his fullness of time manifestation time cuz Christ are the fullness of time was expressed was declared that's the time for the manifestation his fullness of time has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body they without us cannot be made perfect oh Hallelujah I feel like roolling around Glory oh thank God for the prophet of Malachi for what oh Hallelujah GL Glory GL Hallelujah hallelujah amen so Malachi 4 it t up the Los ends and brought it right down to the revelation of all it has been the church ages the body word of the son of man it was done and over but at that spot we are no better than Paul's age because they couldn't go in the Rapture you know the reason why those Angels on the back of the book how to give because the Rapture I mean going back to Eden where Adam was is on the other side of the Rapture and they didn't leave long enough to take the Rapture that's right and Malachi for when he finished his job as a seventh angel SEL the Bible say 10 yesterday silence in heaven that was symbols Hallelujah but the activity was in Revelation 10 when he had finished Hallelujah TI of the losing the Lord can say it now he's ready to come down in the coming of the Lord he ready to come down now he who won the rights back to the Book of Life for Us is ready to come down now to begin the match Back to Eden Revelation 101 I saw another the Angel God come down from heaven CL with a cloud rainbow upon his head Hallelujah Cloud upon his um around him and the feet is stood on the earth one foot on land one foot on sea and cry with a loud voice and when he cry with a loud voice seven spirits Hallelujah alter their voices know what those Spirits are the back of the book brother said no public show you know in the message we have F so much about what are the Thunders I believe is I believe that it's not necessary hallu because the seven Thunders on the back of the book is what's going to provide access Back to Eden go get all the seven Thunder quotes on the sales and see what it's all about the seven Thunders may he show the bride how to prepare for great transition Faith seven Thunders gathers the Bri together for great transition Faith seven Thunders BR Revival seven Thunders will teach the bride how to slice and cut amen that great ministry before we go out of here the seven is all about going out of here so whatever you call the Thunders just believe Malachi for reveal the Thunders there are those who say You must say what they are no I've moved from there Malachi 4 reveal the seven Thunders and he put it under the seven seal I know what I believe them to they and I can prove it to if you sit and talk together but that's not my point here Malachi for revealed the Thunders because the Thunder is always going to take you up in the Rapture Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory so he said on S what time is it he said at this time Revelation 10:7 at this time when this messenger from Heaven is going to come down he said the mystery of God should already be finished all the losing are tied up the the unfailing body word of the son of man through is tied up the mystery of God who God is his being his nature how he lives how he moves how he behaves himself that's already he cleared up Malachi for cleared all that upall and then he said now that I have done this here it's time for this great pres to come I must decrease and he must increase he's been here all the time but I must get out of the way and it is not any man is the Lord Jesus himself I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clo with a cloud rainbow upon his head cry with a loud voice come on children we are ready to go back to Eden seven Thunders utter their voice to open up the way for you to go into the tree of life oh Hallelujah for you to have your Revival Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah on the bridge you may be seated on the bridge Hallelujah let me leave that I I didn't to read it am let me just qu to you Hallelujah but Mom said at the end of the Pentecostal age when all all the losers have been tied up and the seventh angel has brought all down to the revelation of a son of man the unfailing body word of a son of man when the Lord himself comes down from heaven the Lord himself he has to use somebody and he only found one man he could use the prophet William bham who just finished his job as the messenger to Le this year so he veiled in him and you'll find that in Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound this other message Hallelujah the mystery of God through seven Church ages should already be finished by that time you know the quotes I don't have to read them to you before the sounding of the Mysteries on the bag TS the mystery of God should already be [Applause] [Music] finished so Jesus your lord The Covenant Angel veiled in Willam brandham to do this other Ministry the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ rising from the dead dead come for his bride to take them back to Eden in the third pool Ministry not in the open not a Shore in [Music] secret on the seals but B put to about the 10 vision and I said when I went in there he said the angel what he told me I'll keep it in my bosom until I go to meet him and he also talked in there about the seven Thunders under the seventh seal Hallelujah and all the place said the seventh seal amen Mysteries revealed opening of the word like is so beautifully explained when he rose from the dead he did something that he always did in the opening of the word the hidden mysteries of how to go in this rapture hallelujah hallelujah so if you don't get that clear you'll mix brother bham up he was mentioned to Le this here and then Jesus veiling him to Usher You Back to Eden there are two separate Ministries one was the ministry of Jesus Christ one was Ministry of the seventh angel are you with me oh Hallelujah so here we are Malachi 4 I mean you s this time I I don't have time to read all the quotes he said is this so close can I touch it amen if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven [Music] Thunders are we ready to go to go out into Rapture and all all of those quotes there because this this the totally different this is the mystery Christ himself Hallelujah opening the word to you and you recognize him in the opening of the word and here we are what is it the spirit of Christ in the church Ages was there as the baptism of the Holy Ghost in every age but in this age here is not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the fullness I read it to you of the spirit coming to the fullness of the world to manifest the fullness of the body to cause the dead in Christ to rise up they without us cannot be made perfect because they didn't live long enough to bring on the resurrection and the Rapture oh Hallelujah so friends hallelujah what is it H the spirit of Christ is here not just as the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a baptism of the fullness of the spirit of Christ that's what call the Holy Ghost itself you may be seated as I'm pish oration can come I'm done I'm done pish can come hallu so here we are in this age here Malachi 4 has decreased and Jesus has increased that's why he said I was not the one that did these things I was only representing one is not no Minister pring some great things is God's spirit to bring it down to the fullness of the spirit upon the fullness of the world to manifest the fullness of his body so right here today justification made a way for sanctification Luther age made a way for Wesley Wesley added some more sanctification Wesley said made a way for B of the Holy Ghost the Pentecostals added some more but now the baptis of the Holy Ghost in This that's not the spirit of Christ here is not just B of the ghost the spirit of Christ here is said now the holy the B of the Holy Ghost is making way for the Holy Ghost [Applause] itself to come right down with perfection with a manifestation of the spirit of Christ through seven Church ages Hallelujah and it begins for you at your baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the earnest of your Redemption as I'm closing out here today Hallelujah I don't want to take more time if you are here today your entrance Back to Eden TS with the Bing of the Holy Ghost without that you are grounded you

hanging in your flesh the spirit of God anointed into your [Music] flesh hallu the Holy Ghost itself what is it on the St on Blasphemous names he said add to your faith Hallelujah and he said be sure to add to this and this or some fall off because they didn't add and he said he said I've added to my faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience I still ain't got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah he's not talking about the baptism he's talking about the fullness of the spirit to the fullness of the word to manifest the fullness of his body to bring on the resurrection hallah amen hallelujah hallelujah don't you thank God for this Prophet is a work in secret the Pentecost doesn't have a clue your brothers who say only sixes are revealed don't have a clue because this is under the secret walk under the seven seal the opening of the world the fullness of his word coming to the fullness of the world I mean fullness of the spirit coming to the fullness of the world to manifest the fullness of the body well I think our close are here amen so as I'm closing keep play something softly if you're here today brother bam said you have been baptized in water the basom of the Holy Ghost as a promise
