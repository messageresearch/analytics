God may you or God put a hedge around them Lord Jesus we go to this dark time and this our Lord we love you we adore you we appreciate you Father and we we have the believers and all the scenes around the world that will be lured in and sucked at this time just trust in you lord as everybody stay in their little corner and cry out unto you Lord Jesus and what are we living in father knowing that you D were the Jews as a nation but you D with the Gentiles as individuals and it's amazing that it stripped from church and come down to lies at home just like it was in the book of Acts in homes and houses house a house stripped of all this tabernacle and church and everything else and and people after shelter as it was from the dead angel that is talking hurt that great demon that devil roaring like lion seeking to destroy lives homes families or your profits all these 4-dimensional diseases and father golden vision lord of demons of devils and demons invadin nations and Vidan churches invading lives and homeland family but lord I promise when they only become like a flood destroyed every the standard and we pray tonight at you common reason standard around the world father by releasing your spirits even dynamics to the mechanics raises time that father and be glory fire and mixture people that you have seated on around the world father God for surely there's a bride or gotten out of every nation tolerant people you have polar people for your name's sake remember your mind servants everywhere your sons and daughters everywhere father God as they strive in this petrified of life or God to come to that perfection of the coming of the Son of God help us Lord knowing that this servant this virtues when it's completed is a servant of God and the Church of God has gone in the rapture we are common freshly inspires anoint us tonight and Jesus name we ask it amen amen so tonight before we have this time of Prayer I want to read two portions of Scripture one from Luke chapter 11 and we want to read from verse 5 and also from Jeremiah chapter 29 when we some places here we didn't from Luke chapter 11 verse 5 he said unto them which of you have a friend and shall go under him at midnight and see him friend let me tree loose for a friend of mine and in his journey has come to me and I've nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give thee I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he's his friend yet because of his importunity which is his persistence he will rise and give him as many as he needed and I say unto you ask it shall be given you seek you shall find knock it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh see it he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father and will you give him a stone or if he ask a fish will you will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg really offer my scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him and we didn't Jeremiah chapter 29 when we verse 1 demigod of his for now these are the words of the letter the Jeremiah the Prophet sent from Jerusalem under the residue of the elders which were carried away captures unto the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon this for thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel unto all that a carrot or a captive whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem and to Babylon Billy houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them taking wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters the husbands that they may be as sons and daughters that he may be increased there and not diminished and seek the peace of the city whether I have caused you to be carried away captive and pray unto the Lord for it for in the Peace thereof shall ye have peace for d'Or saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you need a Hearton to your dreams which he caused to be dreamed for the prophesy falsely unto you in my name I have not sent them seer the Lord for thus saith the Lord that after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place for I know the torch that I think to what you see at the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and he shall go on three unto me and I will happen unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be fond of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity may God bless his word you may be seated tonight just a little thought search for me but all your heart are we no Romans 8:28 for we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and not love God is not like church like church but at love God is scripturally loving God and and in sin John 14:23 jesus answered and said unto them if a man love me he will keep my words and my father would love him some people like the anointing they like the singing the light is special they like their music but we're talking about loving God if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come on to him and make our board with him he that loveth me not keep it up my sins the word which you hear is not mine but the father which sent me so praise the Lord so what a time we are in now in this season and it's very interesting that we could speak and there's not a congregation here just about what five six brothers here and so I can see faces so I could speak but I want to just bring something to you and the Prophet saying here he was saying for messages second comment he said then another thing I believe that when Satan which was prophesied would go about like a roaring lion in the last days to destroy mortal life and spiritual eyes and everything that he could and I believe then if all the dumpings of all the evil is being dumped out on the human race in beasty I believe that all the blessings will be dumped out or poor old rasa or heavenly father upon the church in the last days so Satan can have a one upon us when the enemy come in like a flood the Spirit will raise a standard and then he said this is praying a prayer from God talked to Moses he said our dear precious Lord we are so unworthy to come to you and yet there has been so loving to us to promise us that if we would ask anything you would do it and that's the confidence that we come in tonight confessing of our sins and the sins of this nation the sins of the city that we are speaking of God be merciful and think of those poor little children fallen with that horrible demon of polio that was in that time and now we know that dokkan and move dis ting and I pray God that there'll be an old-fashioned meetin started here are permitting all along the city made the church's fall on their faces I believe you would stop the plague Lord we know I made a many angel of God stand over the city and we know that the demons will scatter when he stands and see him granted father we pray you will do this and we do it for the kingdom of the powerful prayer and when Jeremiah send this letter this wood from the Lord God have to tell them get married have children because God knew there was so much time that was left and God said forget all them diviners and prophets the dreamers design for sleep and he told them that after 70 years in Babylon I will visit you he expressed them about his thoughts I know my thoughts I think towards you my thoughts thoughts of peace and not evil to give an expected end but then this is the path we want to get through then shall you call upon me and he shall go and pray unto me and I will and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me was after God is now and Jesus give this parable about a man who wanted bread who had guests and he was coming to a friend and the friend would not give because of friendship but he will get up because of his importunity and give him as much as he needed so he was expressing the persistence I've got the strength the power I've got to have what your promise in this hour that persistence that aggression that is the attitude that he wanted and then Jesus went on and says something further he said Aska shall be given them and seek and you shall find and not open so even though somebody could say I'm not I thought I asked then he went on further and said for every one that asketh receiveth he that seeketh findeth to him that knocketh it shall be opened so it's not a one knock another one cheek another one else is escaped as he kept is not kept more glory to God then he went on to say if you being evil nor they give good gifts on children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him Oh glory don't go to the Holy Spirit you have two acts Fiat is cemented acts for and that's the seal of God and that's the mass of the Holy Ghost just two just two mats in the last days the mark of the beast and the seed of the Living God Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus do you love him tonight Oh blessed be the name of the Lord nineteen I believe it was 56 the Prophet gave a vision and he saw the vision and he saw the holy spirit moving a light move away from me and went down into a little building and there was something different between the light and the angel cause he was still with me and the light went into the building and the angel which was a big man said I will meet you in dear and then I said I don't understand why India he said watch and this woman when she come on on the humble on stretcher she was pushing the stretcher on the other side and the lady asked her what happened she said I don't know I've been in this stretcher for in bed for years and here come the man out packing his crutches they asked him he didn't know and he come out to the platform to testify and I said I don't understand what's in there so when they pass through this tent they was sick on this side and a heel on this side crippled on this side and they walkin on this side whatever the condition they coming right through is not right and I said I don't understand that India that meet you India and what he is always scriptural he said did not our Lord see when the prayers be not like the hypocrites for they like to make a show he said enter into the secret closet and when you have done so closed the door then pray to your father which seeth in secret and he that sees in secret shall reward you openly under the Seventh Seal is the last coat on the seventh seal you will see in a voice that you can't teach Pentecostal baby supernatural things leave them alone then he picked me up he took me up set me up way high - we're meeting was going on look like a tent or a cathedral or some sort and a little box a little place over to the side and I see the light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see on the picture it whirled away from me like that and went over that tent and said I will meet you in there and said this is the temple and you won't tell it to nobody now now that you're home what are you going to do with your time know that you're home you sit in you're watching over time a prayer there's no deacon there is no pasta there is no elder there's nobody watching and coming to church in other words there is no accountability to come to anyone you're on your own what are you gonna do with the time this is tea at home stay inside there is debt on the outside stay inside treat like everyone is a potential carrier treat like everyone is a trend so your watch where you go you watch what you do you watch what you touch could you imagine this world come to a place waste like the entire planet is it's a freeze all who must go to sports all who must go to affect or to advance or to a club or must go and fellowship with some friends you can't do that now because something else is moving now here's the challenge what are you going to do with your time when you know by the word no Minister could bring a revival and this is what the Prophet said and expectation nor Minister cannot bring a revival there is no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is just be loyal to God his word and the revival here we go has to come by the people in your home in your life no revival isn't adding new members to the church its reviving what you already got it's to revive is to bring back listen to this part here he says the revival has to come by the people then the first thing he said after that in your home your people love church all kind of all kind of drama in the house and a new home but they're like church but the revival have to start in your home I am saying to you tonight start it in the home I mean it start tonight in your life wherever you are as you are here in this me it's that know as we get hung in prayer me it's that know in Jesus name but I give you Oh hallelujah know that your home your home don't waste time no goal or I call it a movie Bingen go go we send time on whatsapp we send time setting all kind of cuckoo messages on very fighting just a sin for sin and sake and occupying space on people's phone cut it out spend some time in prayer pray about things make up today or what your luck this is time to ask this is time to press let us bow heads as we want to get in this time a prayer a call at a time of prayer is not a permission is a time of Prayer now weakening a hope it's a weakness Spirit or Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Heavenly Father we become to you Lord the people because of sin and generation after generation you they got pushed and you pushed them into Babylon Lord and you knew how long they'll be here you knew what condition will be in and you told them what to do you told them what will happen at the end of it because there is an expected end everything of a time and a season this promise for the bride of its time and its season for their time and seasons for everything under the Sun oh god I pray that your Holy Spirit would come among us in a special way and visitor people in their homes made this court about the revival come by the people in their homes made come alive tonight we have preached it for years we have mentioned it for years and no there's no Minister to look to but to look to Jesus to look to Calvary they looked at the cross to look and to see where we are filled and where we are fall short to look and see where we have become arrogant and indifferent to look and see where we have been hard and disrespectful and not forgiving and not dropping odds to look and see where we need to make things right the look and see the fine out and take introspection where the blood is truly applied to our lives and the spirit abide Oh God I mean wouldn't take things for granted and hang around a court of all who you love and all who love you will be with you and take things easy Laurie see this virus is not respectin post position Lord status culture color race creed denomination it doesn't matter it doesn't matter oh god help us tonight Oh God is a plague it is something of the fourth dimension is not what man has set up Lourdes is what you are law

that you're gonna cut the day short because if you don't cut the day short no flesh shall be saved and Lord you're told that profit when they're people when that little flock that you're gonna give that elijah when they go to calling upon God there'd be a national showdown Oh God miss something happened tonight that we're still the people from the natural life going after natural things or God all the hosts editions hold paintin and the furniture and all the foolish arguments with husband and wife and all the devil in a rampage with the children or godly you break them out Lord and recognize there's something more than man Lord is nothing wrong with the word nothing wrong with the seed is if we have grass and and fangs that is choking it or God by that cedar fell and grip good
