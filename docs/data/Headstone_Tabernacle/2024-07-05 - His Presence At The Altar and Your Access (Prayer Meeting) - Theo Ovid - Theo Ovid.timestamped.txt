[14:15] 17 to 24 Exodus 20 this is after this is
[14:23] Moses Gets In The Ten Commandments and
[14:25] we just want to take up just to the end
[14:27] of it there and go forward and this is
[14:29] verse 17 of Exodus 20 it says God
[14:32] speaking Thou shalt not cover thy
[14:34] neighbor's house Thou shalt not cover
[14:37] thy neighbor's wife nor his manservant
[14:40] nor his maid servant nor his Ox nor his
[14:43] ass nor anything that is thy
[14:46] neighbors Verse 18 and all the people
[14:50] saw the
[14:51] thunderings the Lightnings and the noise
[14:54] of the trumpet and the M Mountain
[14:57] smoking or when the people saw it they
[15:00] removed and stood a far
[15:02] off and they said unto Moses speak thou
[15:06] with us and we will hear but let not God
[15:10] speak with us least we
[15:13] die and Moses said unto the people fear
[15:17] not for God is come to prove you and
[15:22] that his fear may be before your faces
[15:27] that he sner note those words that Moses
[15:29] told them that his fear may be before
[15:33] you your faces that you sin not and the
[15:36] people stood a far off and Moses Drew
[15:40] near unto the thick Darkness where God
[15:44] was and the Lord said unto
[15:47] Moses thus Thou shalt say unto the
[15:51] children of Israel ye have seen that I
[15:55] have talked with you from
[15:56] Heaven he shall not make with me gods of
[16:00] silver neither shall he make unto you
[16:03] gods of
[16:04] gold an altar of Earth thou shal make
[16:09] unto me and shall sacrifice thereon thy
[16:13] burnt offerings and thy peace offerings
[16:16] thy sheep and thine oxen in all places
[16:21] where I record my name I will come unto
[16:24] thee and I will bless thee may God bless
[16:28] his word praise the lord we just so glad
[16:31] tonight for the
[16:32] scriptures other title of this
[16:34] exaltation
[16:36] tonight his presence at the altar and
[16:40] your access that's the title have
[16:43] tonight his presence at the altar and
[16:45] your access what a Time on Wednesday
[16:49] night and to think that our bodies are
[16:54] the Temple of the Holy Ghost and God
[16:56] wants us to see it that way he want us
[16:59] to see this house that we are in is a
[17:02] tabernacle and he want to dwell there in
[17:05] so let's go
[17:09] now
[17:11] sin broke man access the presence the
[17:17] presence of
[17:19] God now remember what God told them eat
[17:23] of all the trees by the tree in the
[17:25] midst don't touch it because the day
[17:27] that day you shall surely die
[17:29] but more than just that they will
[17:32] actually run out not just of the Garden
[17:35] of Eden but out of
[17:37] presence access to God's presence so you
[17:40] know God is not like a man if you have
[17:43] to see somebody important we have to go
[17:46] through much of hurdles and securities
[17:47] and everything else be it a mayor a CEO
[17:50] a Prime Minister President whatever but
[17:53] God wanted man to have access to him
[17:57] without complications
[17:59] man was driven out of the garden
[18:03] of out of his presence and I am seeing
[18:07] that the Altar and I wrote this down
[18:09] here was the
[18:11] intersection point of man and God
[18:15] through sacrifice and offering so even
[18:19] at the ending of The Ten Commandments
[18:21] God told them make me an altar of Earth
[18:25] and of that altar You' offer peace
[18:27] offering you offer sheep and everything
[18:30] else because we know why uh the
[18:34] connection back to God is a sacrifice
[18:37] and at that time what was accepted was
[18:39] the blood of birs and coats and so like
[18:41] that so the altar was the place where
[18:47] presence was
[18:48] restored where the blood price was
[18:52] offered because instead of man dying the
[18:56] sheep or the lamb or the goat or
[18:58] whatever
[18:59] they died in the place of us man now
[19:04] Mark 15 37-38 and Jesus cried with a low
[19:08] voice and give up The Ghost and the veil
[19:10] of the temple was rent in between from
[19:13] the top to the bottom so here it is at
[19:16] Calvary when Jesus died Jesus by getting
[19:21] that Veil rent from the top to the
[19:23] bottom it show that you no longer need a
[19:26] high priest to go in one once a year but
[19:30] now you had Direct access to his
[19:35] presence and we find out that that we
[19:41] find out that that is what God
[19:44] wanted the people to see direct access
[19:49] now I want to share something with you I
[19:50] think last year around June June 2 or so
[19:54] I preach a message exalting a message
[19:56] about building an altar is a building of
[19:59] your prayer life a place where you could
[20:02] contact God a place where you have a
[20:04] communion with God and a fellowship with
[20:06] God now listen to this from the prophet
[20:09] and he says here now when God run them
[20:12] out and says now that man know good and
[20:13] evil L he put forth his hand and take of
[20:16] the tree of life and eat and live
[20:17] forever and the Lord sent him forth out
[20:20] the Garden of Eden to tell the ground
[20:22] for when he was taken so he drove man
[20:24] and he placed at the East of Eden
[20:27] cherubin with swords flaming swords to
[20:30] keep them from the tree of life because
[20:33] if man take a hold of the tree of life
[20:35] he can live forever notice these
[20:38] terrains they they kept the tree of life
[20:40] and gaed it and we know that Jesus said
[20:43] I am the way I'm the bread and so like
[20:46] that I'm the life so therefore now I
[20:48] want to show this to
[20:51] you this is important I read this at
[20:53] that time I want to show you now and
[20:56] make this show it's an altar now this
[20:59] must have been an altar at the Garden of
[21:02] Eden I'll tell you why do you remember
[21:05] both Cain and Abel come here to worship
[21:09] so that shows that God's altar was moved
[21:12] and set here at the Garden of Eden and
[21:16] the only way back to Eden is by the
[21:19] altar here you again here you are again
[21:23] back to Eden through the Altar and they
[21:26] were they were to keep the way there and
[21:28] guard it and they couldn't get back
[21:30] there until this altar was covered with
[21:33] blood so of course this is an Old
[21:36] Testament requirement but then all this
[21:38] was prophecy that the lamb perfect lamb
[21:41] was coming with Jesus Christ and with
[21:43] his blood now we have a perfect
[21:46] sacrifice because the presence now come
[21:48] at the altar and here what he said now
[21:50] he say oh God can people see it nothing
[21:52] but the blood there has to be an
[21:55] atonement a mercy seat this altar of
[21:58] judg M must become a mercy seat and when
[22:01] this alar if the blood is
[22:03] lifted there will stand on that Judgment
[22:05] Day the fire of God the r to G that tree
[22:08] again Garden at the gate another thing I
[22:11] want you to notice Cain Bible said Cain
[22:15] went out from the presence of the Lord
[22:18] at the gate at the Garden so here we go
[22:22] listen carefully so the presence of the
[22:25] Lord must have been at the altar
[22:29] and the altar was at the gate so this
[22:33] altar that we speak about because
[22:37] remember the word that we've been
[22:38] preaching for the past few days or so uh
[22:41] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice a
[22:43] Living Sacrifice to be placed upon God's
[22:45] altar so the presence of the Lord must
[22:48] have been at the altar and the altar was
[22:52] at the gate he said Glory it is God's
[22:55] dwelling place at his altar
[22:59] so I will say this tonight sin's
[23:03] purpose is to cut off access from your
[23:08] father to keep you powerless and in a
[23:11] defeated state so the object of the
[23:15] devil working over time to get you into
[23:18] slackness into looseness into sin into
[23:20] sexual deviations or whatever the object
[23:23] of that is to cut you off from presence
[23:28] because in presence you have access to
[23:31] all that you have need of
[23:34] now the prophet preer message in another
[23:37] and he was describing the seraps and the
[23:39] seraphim and burners and actually the
[23:41] seraphim is the one who receed the
[23:43] sacrifice that cleanses the worshipper
[23:46] and then presents him to God so I want
[23:48] you to think from a natural standpoint
[23:51] you may see people come up to Natural
[23:53] altar or people about there in prayer or
[23:55] get into crying or or seeking the Lord
[23:57] and so on like but what is actually
[23:59] happening there is that Sarahs are the
[24:02] ones that cleanses the worshipper and
[24:05] then presents him to God this seraphim
[24:08] was Angelic beings and they are the very
[24:10] one that stands right at the altar and
[24:14] they receive the sacrifice it shows the
[24:16] justice of God and that sin here we go
[24:19] cannot come in his presence unless it
[24:22] has been atoned for now the reason that
[24:25] I could say that is present at the altar
[24:28] and your access is because not everyone
[24:31] have access to presence because the
[24:33] prophet said the altar itself is guarded
[24:36] that no scalian could access that
[24:39] presence so you could see by for
[24:42] knowledge God called you and he called
[24:45] you not to stay as you are human natural
[24:48] ordinary caral but he called you that
[24:51] you could come up higher into the spirit
[24:53] and recognize that your predestination
[24:56] is what you are predestined onto or what
[24:59] God ordained for you to go onto and that
[25:01] is to come back to Eden by The Altar and
[25:04] through the altar so the Sarah a being
[25:07] that stands next to God and they guard
[25:09] this altar now brother in here let's go
[25:13] we go talking about at the altar right
[25:16] talk about you must be born again he
[25:18] says when you go to church and accept
[25:20] their Creed and their forms of baptism
[25:22] that you supposed to yourself to lay up
[25:24] there you might have get up and
[25:25] shivering speaking in Tong R over the FL
[25:28] FL you might get up beeping but if that
[25:30] offering here we go has been received by
[25:33] God it consumed the world the world is
[25:36] dead to you you are gone for we reckon
[25:38] ourselves dead and buried we are dead we
[25:42] are HID in Christ and hid in Christ when
[25:45] our souls here we go is placed upon the
[25:49] altar of divine judgment so note we are
[25:54] going away from church away from
[25:56] building away from organization away
[25:59] from I am in the message and I believe
[26:02] the message we're not going there we're
[26:05] going to you being a tabernacle being a
[26:08] temple being a house being a true
[26:11] worshipper being a priest being one who
[26:15] have access not through the pastor not
[26:18] through an elder not through a man but
[26:21] having direct access to God by his
[26:25] Spirit okay so watch when our souls is
[26:29] placed upon the altar of divine judgment
[26:32] what was the penalty death and when you
[26:34] lay yourself upon the altar of God death
[26:37] upon the sinner how can you raise from
[26:40] there alive in sin if God accepted the
[26:45] sacrifice here we go now you die see the
[26:49] message say you are the bride and you
[26:51] are the this you that and watch the you
[26:53] speak the word but this is the process
[26:55] to get to that you die you actually are
[26:59] consumed you are petrified there is no
[27:03] more left to you but just this form you
[27:06] are standing in like the brass serpent
[27:08] like Christ was when he took him dead
[27:10] and Co off the cross you are
[27:13] dead until his judgment has actually
[27:16] killed your senses Oh you mean these
[27:20] senses have to be killed yes the senses
[27:23] that trip you into anger trip you into
[27:25] temper trip you into misbehaving trip
[27:27] you into going to the wrong places trip
[27:29] you in wrong reactions because you're in
[27:32] your flesh and you're getting upset and
[27:35] this one offend you and you get upset
[27:36] and you're getting mad and all of that
[27:39] this judgment actually kill your senses
[27:43] you might say well I'm going to turn a
[27:45] new page that isn't it you know I used
[27:47] to smoke I'm going to quit smoking that
[27:49] still isn't it until God receives that
[27:54] sacrifice on his past altar what is his
[27:57] J judgement death that's the
[28:00] penalty I want to go into something here
[28:02] right
[28:03] now that kind of blow my mind when I see
[28:07] it
[28:09] sin is
[28:11] actually the absence of
[28:14] presence the presence of God you cannot
[28:19] sin in the presence of God and that is
[28:22] why the devil's JW is to upset and shake
[28:26] and try to overthrow and Rock Believers
[28:29] and the church come out of the presence
[28:31] of God and here where this draw from
[28:37] but Psalm 168 David said I have set the
[28:40] Lord before me that's a good thing to
[28:45] do I have set the lord always before my
[28:48] Fe now David have set the Lord before my
[28:51] Fe and here what he said here now always
[28:56] be conscience of God's presence presence
[28:59] wouldn't that be a good lesson for all
[29:00] of us tonight set the Lord before our
[29:03] face so be conscious of his presence put
[29:06] him first put him first
[29:09] why
[29:11] then you won't sin when you are
[29:15] realizing that constantly you are in the
[29:19] presence of God so the presence of God
[29:22] is a sin killer the presence of God is a
[29:26] sin a protection against sin so in other
[29:29] words in God's presence you can't be
[29:31] sitting at the bar you can't be smoking
[29:34] a cigarette you can't be car a bunch of
[29:36] foolish be curing and in the Pres of God
[29:39] that just going to happen listen to what
[29:41] the prophet says when you realize God is
[29:45] around you will watch what you see a man
[29:50] when he think God is gone he will cuss
[29:53] he would lust after woman he will steal
[29:56] cheat lie he will do anything when he
[30:00] thinks that God don't see him but bring
[30:03] him into the presence of God he will
[30:06] stop it right now God help me God help
[30:10] us God help our church then people need
[30:14] to really come up into God's presence
[30:16] because they think and brother U has
[30:18] emphasized it so many times they
[30:20] separate work from God they separate
[30:24] Church from God from and their daily Liv
[30:27] of God so you go to church is a ritual
[30:30] you come home you do you do you go when
[30:32] you go act when to act but when you
[30:35] blend it all together is not really so
[30:37] it's supposed to be all God it's
[30:39] supposed to be his presence that we in
[30:41] so brother said again I read it again
[30:43] when a man think God is gone he will
[30:46] cuss he would lust after woman he will
[30:49] steal he will cheat he would lie will do
[30:52] anything that when he thinks that God
[30:53] don't see him but bring him into the
[30:56] presence of God he will stop it right
[30:59] then David said I have put the Lord
[31:02] before me that's a good thing no wonder
[31:04] God has said he was a man of his own
[31:06] heart man will do everything when he
[31:09] thinks that God isn't near but when he
[31:11] realizes that God is near did you ever
[31:14] notice a sinner let a Godly person walk
[31:16] up he's quit his cussing if he have got
[31:19] any respects at all he wouldn't tell any
[31:21] dirty jokes why because that Christian
[31:24] standing there represents the altar now
[31:27] this altar
[31:28] as I close I want to present you tonight
[31:31] is not a church altar it's not a
[31:33] headstone Tabernacle altar it's a
[31:36] personal altar is Right Where You Are
[31:38] Tonight right in your homes tonight you
[31:42] building a personal altar a place to
[31:46] have access and to be brought into
[31:50] Fellowship of God and I have written
[31:53] here this relationship is to go beyond
[31:57] petitioning
[31:58] is to go be Beyond asking asking God for
[32:01] a raise asking for car asking for this
[32:04] asking asking asking God is a a big
[32:06] Giver like a Santa Claus man this
[32:09] relationship is to go beyond petitioning
[32:12] or Beyond asking God for things into the
[32:15] realm where you just want to be in the
[32:19] company of his presence Lord I want to
[32:21] be in your presence I just want to
[32:24] worship you I just want to be in your
[32:27] presence
[32:29] I close and this is scripture we read I
[32:32] Bes you Brethren by the mercies of God
[32:35] that you present your bodies a Living
[32:38] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[32:43] is your reasonable
[32:45] service what house will you build
[32:48] me what altar will you build
[32:51] me we need to build a personal
[32:53] Altar and you hear about Isa speak about
[32:56] it a king Kingdom of priests offering
[33:00] sacrifices to God and this one blow my
[33:03] mind Genesis 8 this is last
[33:07] scripture Genesis 8: 20-22 says and
[33:11] Noah building an altar unto the
[33:14] Lord and took of every clean beast and
[33:18] of every clean fowl and offered burnt
[33:21] offerings on the
[33:23] altar now he this part verse 21 and the
[33:27] Lord
[33:28] smelled a sweet
[33:30] sa and the Lord said in his
[33:34] heart you know this here describing God
[33:38] it describ him as a person here I find
[33:41] this was so amazing the Lord smelled the
[33:45] sweet
[33:46] SAA and the Lord said in his heart I
[33:49] will not again curse the gr anymore for
[33:52] man's sake for the imagination of man
[33:55] heart is evil from his youth
[33:58] neither will I again Smite anymore
[34:01] everything living as I have done while
[34:03] the Earth remain it sea time Harvest and
[34:07] cold and heat summer and winter and day
[34:09] and night shall not
[34:12] cease why what made God say that in his
[34:17] heart a offering that Noah made at the
[34:22] altar we about to close off here tonight
[34:25] to let you go and pray I want you to see
[34:29] you have a personal alar and I want to
[34:34] see you to see that your prayer tonight
[34:38] going up to God and he could smell
[34:41] it he could have a heart for what your
[34:44] desire really is to love him and to
[34:48] serve him and he could intervene tonight
[34:51] on your
[34:52] behalf regardless of your condition
[34:56] regardless of your situation
[34:58] you have an opportunity not to go
[35:00] through guards and go to appointment
[35:02] books and go through all kind of
[35:03] Investigation before you see this big
[35:05] person that's how man have it to see the
[35:08] prime minister to see a mayor to see
[35:10] somebody you have to go to a set of
[35:11] drama and secretary and whatnot God kill
[35:14] all of that and through the blood of
[35:16] Jesus Christ we have
[35:21] access if the devil apply for this
[35:23] tonight he will get a word access denied
[35:28] not
[35:29] you God given you the
[35:31] key God giv you the
[35:34] password that you could have direct
[35:36] access to his presence in his presence
[35:39] there's no frustration in his presence
[35:41] there's no depression in his presence
[35:43] there is no I don't know and I going to
[35:46] no it don't have that it have peace it
[35:49] have joy it have Assurance it have long
[35:52] suffering I am delighted by this what
[35:56] I'm seeing because I realize that as we
[35:59] grow in God as we get more mature we
[36:02] realize God have a heart God have a mind
[36:06] God have desires God have expectation
[36:09] and God cannot change his word so even
[36:12] though he wants to bless if the person
[36:15] have to repent they have to repent in
[36:17] order to activate His blessings he
[36:19] cannot go around his own word God cannot
[36:23] go around his own word he want to bless
[36:25] you tonight or he have to bless you
[36:27] according to his will let's bow our
[36:29] heads heavenly father I ask for Anthony

[36:48] time hear Brother brand talk about God
[36:50] know when every fly bats his eye and
[36:54] that was just like a statement but for
[36:56] me now is not just a statement it's an
[37:00] understanding that God knows every
[37:03] thought every heart every desire every
[37:07] sin every failure every shortcoming he
[37:11] knows God when that t and lightning came
[37:13] down on the mountain the people didn't
[37:16] stay where they were they went backwards
[37:19] they went AAR they stood a far off and
[37:22] the people cried out let Moses speak
[37:26] don't let God speak it's a Dreadful
[37:30] thing to fall into the hands of almighty
[37:33] God lord I know that
[37:36] someday this that we speak about will
[37:40] become a living reality in the homes and
[37:44] lives of your children they will
[37:47] understand that the god of Moses the god
[37:50] of Isaac the god of Jacob the god of the
[37:52] Old Testament is still alive confirming
