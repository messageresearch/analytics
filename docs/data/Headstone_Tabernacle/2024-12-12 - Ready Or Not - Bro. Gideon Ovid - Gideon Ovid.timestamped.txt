[38:47] us instructions he give us guidelines he
[38:50] set out things that he would like from
[38:52] us things that he want us to do things
[38:55] that he require of us and the question
[38:57] is will you be ready tonight will you be
[39:00] ready if he comes to mark your papers
[39:02] right now would you get the A+ would you
[39:05] be able to progress would you be able to
[39:08] pass the test
[39:10] amen so in that scripture we read it
[39:12] says watch therefore so at the beginning
[39:15] there was an instruction so there's no
[39:17] room for laziness when we say ready or
[39:20] not even in the context of the game
[39:22] sometimes you run and you hide you have
[39:23] to do something so in this scripture it
[39:26] says watch therefore so you don't just
[39:28] lie down and sit down and and hope for
[39:31] the best and and hope the cameras pick
[39:33] up what's going on no no no there's
[39:34] something required of you there's
[39:36] something you have to do because you
[39:39] don't know the day or the hour you don't
[39:41] know when the thief is coming you don't
[39:43] know when the opposition is going to
[39:45] attack you so you have to always be
[39:47] prepared like the cop Scout Moto always
[39:50] be ready because it doesn't matter when
[39:52] the opposition strikes what you're sure
[39:55] of the opposition is going to strike yes
[39:57] so as we say in times of peace prepare
[40:00] for war in times of calm you prepare for
[40:03] danger and difficulty because it's
[40:06] certainly going to come
[40:08] amen I have you the Journey of Life as
[40:12] we travel through life life is a journey
[40:15] it's lightened unto a journey so you
[40:17] have a start a middle part and an end in
[40:19] True Life some of the journeys are
[40:23] days some are
[40:25] months you know you don't don't even
[40:27] know where life will lead you you start
[40:30] at one point and sometimes you end your
[40:32] trajectory is so so diverse so different
[40:35] to your neighbor so different to those
[40:37] around you you may start in one part in
[40:40] this context you may start in one part
[40:42] of the island and you end is at a
[40:44] different part or you start in one
[40:46] country and you end is a different part
[40:48] or we all start at Birth but we don't
[40:51] know when the end is that's
[40:53] right you didn't choose your family
[40:56] that's right you didn't Cho chose your
[40:58] environment you certainly didn't choose
[41:00] your trials and your tests and your ups
[41:01] and downs but God chose you he chose you
[41:06] he chose to love you he chose to raise
[41:09] you he chose to keep you you're here
[41:12] because of his love you're here because
[41:14] of his grace and his mercy and and and
[41:18] his provision for you and his will in
[41:20] your life your destiny is assigned by
[41:23] him your purpose is assigned by him as
[41:26] they say he is the manufacturer so he
[41:29] knows why you're here sometimes you
[41:32] might be
[41:33] misguided sometimes you might be
[41:35] distracted but along the journey you
[41:38] have to realize and acknowledge without
[41:40] him you're
[41:41] nothing without him there's nothing you
[41:44] can do in your own accord there's
[41:46] nothing you could do by yourself there's
[41:49] a song that says without him I'll be
[41:51] nothing without him I'll surely fail
[41:54] amen he chose to call you he he chose to
[41:57] love you he train you he raised you up
[42:00] and he purchased You by his
[42:03] blood now listen God was willing to pay
[42:05] a price for you because you were
[42:09] invaluable he couldn't run the risk of
[42:11] losing you he couldn't run the risk of
[42:14] somebody else getting control of you so
[42:17] he was willing to pay the ultimate price
[42:19] to get
[42:20] you in this life if if you see value in
[42:24] something you're willing to go through
[42:26] great sacrifice you're willing to work
[42:28] to get it you're willing to wait you
[42:31] you're willing to be patient and and
[42:33] store up whether it's money whether it's
[42:35] time whatever the medium of exchange
[42:38] you're willing to do it because it's
[42:39] valuable to you so he was willing to
[42:42] take his only son and shed his blood to
[42:46] redeem
[42:47] you to raise you up to bring you
[42:51] back he give you life he give you
[42:53] purpose hope and Destiny he showed you
[42:56] Grace and Merc Mercy day after day after
[42:59] day without you requesting it without
[43:02] you earning it to some like I said he
[43:05] give days to some that Journey was just
[43:09] weeks to some it was years some persons
[43:13] we enjoy just just a little while and
[43:15] and they called off the
[43:17] scene some person they they they live a
[43:20] little while and they do a thing or two
[43:22] and and we remember them a little bit
[43:23] and the number is called but you're
[43:25] still here you you still here tonight to
[43:28] praise and worship and to beat the devil
[43:32] anytime anywhere under any condition God
[43:36] must have a a special plan for you we
[43:39] could call you Special Forces because
[43:41] there are those who dropped off in the
[43:43] 80s and 90s there are those who white
[43:45] Tok wipe them out but you still here
[43:49] despite the ups and downs despite the
[43:52] rocking of the boat despite how you may
[43:54] be tossed and turned you're still here
[43:56] is something that keep holding on to you
[43:59] that have you here in 2024 now we're on
[44:02] the cusp of
[44:03] 2025 and you're still holding on to
[44:06] faith you're still believing you're
[44:08] still waiting for your children you're
[44:11] still holding on for your loved
[44:15] ones it doesn't matter what time of the
[44:19] year it is you know for many they
[44:21] celebrate Christmas and they decorate
[44:23] and and they they clean up and they they
[44:25] they do some nice things they they
[44:27] prepare food and stuff but you know at
[44:30] the end of the
[44:32] day doing all you do in the
[44:36] natural has no real effect or impact on
[44:39] the spiritual requirement of
[44:42] God no matter what you do don't get me
[44:44] wrong I'm not saying don't clean I'm not
[44:46] saying don't cook I'm not saying don't
[44:48] decorate or do whatever you want for
[44:50] Christmas but I'm saying at the end of
[44:52] the thing we have to make the main thing
[44:53] the main thing at the end of the day it
[44:56] doesn't matter if if it's Christmas or
[44:58] if it's New Year's or whatever holiday
[45:00] it might be at the end of the day you
[45:03] still have to ensure that if Jesus were
[45:06] to come and Mark your papers tonight
[45:08] that you get a passing
[45:11] grade that you get a passing grade you
[45:14] can never be too busy for his
[45:17] requirements there is no excuse good
[45:19] enough for not making his Mark he has a
[45:23] pass Mark and I want you to know that
[45:26] your pass mark Mark is different than
[45:27] mine that's
[45:28] right it's different than your neighbor
[45:31] so something we have to do is stop
[45:33] comparing to the people around you and
[45:37] I'll show you true scripture why you
[45:38] should stop doing that it will get you
[45:40] in a lot of problems because you look at
[45:42] your brother and your sister and you see
[45:44] them doing something and you believe you
[45:45] know what I could do that better you
[45:47] know I should do that too but God said
[45:51] listen here what I have chose you chosen
[45:54] you because you different than your
[45:56] brother you're different than your
[45:58] sister your mother and your father
[46:00] couldn't see what I have ordained for
[46:02] you because I call you and selected you
[46:05] before the foundation of the earth I
[46:07] didn't call the ones around you I call
[46:08] you don't look around it's you it's you
[46:11] are speaking to so I know you might be
[46:14] listening to this right now but it's you
[46:16] he is speaking to tonight because he
[46:18] called you for a special
[46:21] operation in the military there are
[46:23] special ops and that's why he called you
[46:26] in the last day because you have special
[46:29] training Abraham may not have passed the
[46:32] test that he has ordained for you your
[46:35] brother may not have passed the test
[46:37] that he's ordained for you amen now in a
[46:41] message of seal of God I'm not trying to
[46:43] scare you but in reality this might be a
[46:46] last service you know this might be a
[46:49] last
[46:50] message I know it was the blood might be
[46:52] the last song you ever sung and that's
[46:55] reality that's the reality in which we
[46:58] liveing in a message the Seal of God
[47:01] paragraph 293 the prophet said one of
[47:04] these days the last Holy Ghost anointed
[47:06] gospel sermon will be preached he didn't
[47:09] say it might be preached he said it will
[47:12] be preached it will be the last one he
[47:15] say one of these days the last gun will
[47:17] fire one of these days the last song
[47:19] will sung one of these days the last
[47:22] prayer would be
[47:23] prayed one of these days the doors of
[47:25] the Tabernacle would be closed Clos for
[47:27] the last time the Bible will be closed
[47:30] on the pulpit and you'll stand in the
[47:32] presence of God to give an account for
[47:35] what you've heard
[47:37] tonight not just Last Week Tonight the
[47:40] words you're hearing tonight you have to
[47:42] give an account for because you're
[47:43] hearing it now wherever you are under
[47:45] the sound of my voice you're hearing it
[47:47] now that the last word will be spoken at
[47:51] some point and you'll stand in the
[47:52] presence of God to give an account for
[47:55] what you heard tonight what then what
[47:58] then would it matter how much money you
[48:01] earned this year come on would it matter
[48:03] if you bought a new car come on would it
[48:05] matter what you plan to do for Christmas
[48:09] what
[48:10] then when the Great book is opened what
[48:13] then when tonight comes on record what
[48:17] then when the Great book is
[48:20] opened when the ones that rejected the
[48:23] Savior today will be asked to give a
[48:26] reason to give an excuse to give an
[48:28] answer for what's going on what then
[48:32] your job stood any
[48:34] way because you had things to do because
[48:36] you was
[48:37] busy what what excuse you think will be
[48:40] good enough your girlfriend stood anyway
[48:44] the church stood anyway the Deacon or
[48:46] the
[48:47] Usher when the Great book is open what
[48:50] then when the ones that reject the
[48:52] message tonight you're going to be asked
[48:55] to give a reason what then what are you
[48:59] going to do about it you know what the
[49:01] mark of the beast is you know what the
[49:03] Seal of God is it's up to you and that's
[49:07] the beauty of God he he he's not forcing
[49:10] you tonight you know let's call it
[49:12] information he's presenting the
[49:14] information to you he's presenting it to
[49:17] you he's saying listen this is what I
[49:20] want of
[49:21] you I'm coming with a test I'm coming
[49:24] with an exam so in class class and I
[49:28] just going to shift a little bit in the
[49:30] classroom they often do do do this all
[49:32] the time and teachers in the house could
[49:34] confirm they will say 1+ 1 is
[49:36] two 2+ 2 is four 3 plus three is six and
[49:42] then for the exam they come 1 plus
[49:46] two that's how it comes
[49:49] usually so it might be a little little
[49:52] different it might look a little
[49:54] different to what you did in class but
[49:56] the teacher hopes that you would have
[49:58] grasped the
[49:59] concept that you understood that the
[50:02] seed was planted so when you walk out
[50:04] you're not just
[50:05] regurgitating you're not just just just
[50:08] rattling it out no but you have a proper
[50:11] understanding that that it could live in
[50:13] you so you could walk and say silver and
[50:15] gold I don't have but such as I have I
[50:18] give Thee I could release to you because
[50:20] I understand the power that is within me
[50:24] amen so that's the way test usually
[50:27] would operate so you learn the
[50:29] principles and then you're you're
[50:31] required to apply
[50:33] it so in most exams as well you have a
[50:37] start
[50:38] time and a pred a predetermined time to
[50:42] finish many times there are students who
[50:45] find themselves writing or the as we say
[50:47] they working down to the wire they going
[50:50] they're going they're going until they
[50:52] hear 's up but you know what's
[50:55] interesting about that not nothing is
[50:57] wrong with writing down to the
[50:59] wire the teeth on the cross was down to
[51:02] the
[51:03] wire Jesus on the cross was right there
[51:07] about to give up The Ghost and he said
[51:09] Lord remember me remember me I right
[51:14] here with you I didn't walk with you or
[51:16] talk with you I might have stolen from
[51:18] you but remember me down to the wire but
[51:22] here's the thing about exams though it
[51:25] doesn't matter too much if you was a a
[51:27] student if you was the teacher's pet if
[51:30] the teacher liked you if you were the
[51:32] class clown or you just love the subject
[51:35] you know some folks they love math or
[51:37] they love chemistry or they love physics
[51:39] they just love that but when the exam
[51:42] come it may not like
[51:43] them that's just reality of exams but
[51:47] they love it they're passionate about
[51:48] that they could talk about it but under
[51:50] exam
[51:51] conditions they fail remember the exam
[51:54] have a start time and a time to finish
[51:58] so while you doing all your tests and
[52:01] exams and you believe you ass simulate
[52:03] all the information and you're coming
[52:04] and you're writing and you're finding
[52:05] new Solutions at some point they will
[52:08] tell you time's
[52:10] up and at that point it didn't matter
[52:13] how your term went or how your year went
[52:15] or how your five year or how the period
[52:17] it didn't matter and we'll come to it in
[52:19] a little while if you was coming to
[52:21] church consistently on time time will be
[52:25] up and at that
[52:28] point even if you would have read the
[52:30] books so you take the exam book and you
[52:33] do all nighters you drink coffee cover
[52:37] to cover you know everything you could
[52:38] walk and just start to recite you could
[52:41] recite the book from the front to the
[52:43] back at that point it doesn't matter
[52:45] what you could recite because time's up
[52:48] and the only thing that matters is what
[52:50] you wrote on the paper I remember my
[52:53] wife recently she was invigilating an
[52:55] exam and she say you know there was a
[52:56] young man came into the exam he came
[52:59] late looking flustered came in when he
[53:02] got the paper he started
[53:04] man and after about 10 minutes his head
[53:08] went down and when his head came back up
[53:10] the exam was finished he was totally
[53:13] stumped worn out studied out whatever
[53:17] you call it he slept through the entire
[53:19] thing the only thing that they could
[53:21] judge at that point is what he wrote on
[53:24] the paper it didn't matter if he was the
[53:26] top student if he was a a student what
[53:29] they're marking is what's on the paper
[53:31] because that's the requirement the
[53:33] requirement is you have to write what is
[53:36] required and that's the result of your
[53:38] exam so given that context if you read
[53:42] book cover to cover when the invigilator
[53:44] says time's up nothing you learn matter
[53:48] you know some folks that say what I
[53:49] learned did not come it doesn't matter
[53:53] what matters is what you write on the
[53:55] paper
[53:57] just like that Jesus he healed the sick
[54:00] he raised the dead he caused the blind
[54:03] to see and stuff he opened the word and
[54:05] the understanding and he walked with
[54:07] disciples and he showed them mer very
[54:09] very many miracles he gave them Parables
[54:12] he taught them he walked with them for
[54:14] three and a half years
[54:16] amen but all of that culminated at the
[54:21] Garden of
[54:23] Gethsemane at the Garden on his knees he
[54:26] faced the ultimate test he said Lord
[54:29] listen if it's possible let this cup
[54:32] pass let me not participate in this
[54:35] partner I I I I get I mean people talk
[54:39] bad about me they say all kind of thing
[54:42] they they they accuse me wrongfully but
[54:46] let me not do this part now but you know
[54:48] at the end of the time when is time to
[54:51] Mark the exam you know what he said not
[54:54] my will but thy will so like man he
[54:57] stand up and he say listen I going
[54:59] through I passing the test I taking it
[55:02] for what it's worth I taking your word
[55:04] and are going to execute not my will but
[55:07] your will God's will so it is with us
[55:10] you know God dropped us in time or like
[55:13] I say God dropped time on
[55:16] us he dropped time on us and and say
[55:19] listen there's a time to born a time to
[55:22] die a time for this and time for that a
[55:26] time to marry a time to eat a I mean he
[55:29] really allocate time for everything
[55:33] amen and there Comes A Time in your life
[55:37] in this journey called life when it
[55:39] doesn't matter what you
[55:40] heard it doesn't matter what you read
[55:43] you know it doesn't matter too much what
[55:46] you
[55:46] say at some point he'll declare time no
[55:50] longer and when he does what matters is
[55:53] if you're
[55:54] ready you're ready to meet him that's
[55:57] the question at that point will you be
[56:00] ready at that point will you be ready
[56:04] when he call your number will you be be
[56:07] ready for him to mark your papers have
[56:10] you done what is needed to pass his test
[56:13] do we have the faith that he coming to
[56:15] look for do we believe the things he
[56:18] tell us he want us believe he tell us
[56:20] trust him love him serve him
[56:26] he tell us he coming to look for Faith
[56:30] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[56:33] broadly kindness he want charity to be
[56:36] able to drop down you you have
[56:39] that that is his requirement that is
[56:42] what he looking for that's his test that
[56:46] is what he testing so when he look could
[56:49] could he find Faith could he find virtue
[56:53] if you don't have that if you can't live
[56:55] that if your carh show that you're
[56:57] falling short it don't matter how much
[57:00] hands you're shaking it don't matter if
[57:02] the pastor love you if you just come
[57:04] early and everybody love you you know
[57:07] you is a man of the people as they say
[57:10] it don't matter how charismatic you are
[57:12] what requ what what what matters is that
[57:14] you fulfill his
[57:16] requirements at some point you will be
[57:19] called to
[57:21] account called to give an account and
[57:24] it's so interesting
[57:26] that I often say the Bible gives the
[57:29] examples for
[57:31] everything everything we need is in the
[57:33] Bible and you say at some point you will
[57:36] be called to give an account he say
[57:39] you'll be called to give an answer too
[57:41] but I want to delve a little deeper into
[57:43] that given an account and use a
[57:45] scripture that's familiar to us you
[57:46] don't have to find it but in Matthew
[57:49] 25:14 this is the scripture with the
[57:51] parable of the talents it's something
[57:53] we're familiar with something we've read
[57:55] many many times s we know it 5 10 to
[57:57] five two two one bury it but I want to
[58:03] read it because I think there are some
[58:05] things in it that we need to explore and
[58:09] consider in verse 14 of Matthew 25 it
[58:12] says for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a
[58:15] man traveling into a far country and I
[58:18] want you to take a note there you see if
[58:20] somebody is traveling to a far country
[58:23] you as his servant don't know when he
[58:25] coming back
[58:27] he not traveling by the neighbor he not
[58:28] going next door he traveling far he
[58:31] going far so you don't know how long he
[58:33] will take to return amen so he called
[58:37] his own servants not servants from down
[58:39] the street you know his own servants the
[58:41] people he know love and trust and he
[58:44] entrust unto them and the Bible says he
[58:46] delivered unto them his goods and unto
[58:49] one he gave five talents and to another
[58:51] two and to another one to every man
[58:54] according to his several abilities so
[58:56] earlier on when I said don't compare to
[58:58] your neighbor because you have a
[59:00] different ability than your neighbor if
[59:03] everybody had the same ability you know
[59:05] what he would have done he would have
[59:06] given everybody five or everybody two or
[59:09] everybody one but he knew knew everybody
[59:13] had a different skill set different
[59:16] ability different listen everybody was
[59:20] not the same that's right because he
[59:24] knew that he customized your test for
[59:26] you you
[59:27] know you not qualified for my test you
[59:30] know and I'm not qualified for yours you
[59:33] know so it's easy to look and say but
[59:35] you I see how God blessing him you see
[59:38] how God prosper in his way and you don't
[59:40] know listen this job you looking at you
[59:43] job was blessed job was prosperous but
[59:46] you don't know in a little while the
[59:48] devil going to go to and
[59:50] through and God go and say have you
[59:53] considered my servant job all the time
[59:55] you watch it you want to exchange roles
[59:57] with job you want to do that listen I I
[1:00:01] think if job had the opportunity to swap
[1:00:03] he might have swap you know because his
[1:00:05] test wasn't right here you know I could
[1:00:07] tell you I don't want his test you know
[1:00:10] job lost everything you know right the
[1:00:13] Rich Young Ruler was told to sell all he
[1:00:16] had job didn't have to sell all he hav
[1:00:20] job lost it you know don't his children
[1:00:23] the cattle the flocks the I mean
[1:00:25] everything
[1:00:27] so I come back to the the the thing that
[1:00:30] everybody had a different ability so
[1:00:32] because they had a different ability he
[1:00:34] give them different talents and I will
[1:00:36] use the scripture again to show you and
[1:00:38] reemphasize that fact that is more about
[1:00:41] you being ready than the amount it's
[1:00:44] more about you being prepared than
[1:00:46] watching your neighbor it's more about
[1:00:48] you being faithful to God's word than
[1:00:51] seeing what other people doing so it
[1:00:53] went on and we say
[1:00:57] to he that receiv received five talents
[1:00:58] he went and traded the same in verse 16
[1:01:00] and he made them other five talents and
[1:01:03] likewise he that received two he also
[1:01:05] gained other two but he that had
[1:01:08] received one went and died the Earth and
[1:01:09] hid his Lord's money and listen in verse
[1:01:12] 19 and I think verse 19 just like 14 is
[1:01:15] so significant he said after a long time
[1:01:19] it sound like it wasn't a day it wasn't
[1:01:21] a month it was a time that they didn't
[1:01:24] identify here in the scripture he said
[1:01:26] after a long time the lord of the
[1:01:28] servants the same Lord cometh and reckon
[1:01:31] with them and and Converse with them and
[1:01:33] dialogue with them and so he that had
[1:01:37] five talents came and brought other five
[1:01:39] talents saying Lord thou deliver unto me
[1:01:41] five Talons behold I gained beside them
[1:01:44] five talents more amen his lord said
[1:01:47] unto him listen to the words well done
[1:01:50] thou good and faithful servant thou Hast
[1:01:53] been Faithful over a few things now he
[1:01:55] had most to know and God said thou has
[1:01:58] been Faithful over a few things and I
[1:02:00] will make the ruler over many things
[1:02:03] enter thou into the joy of thy
[1:02:06] Lord and listen he also that had
[1:02:09] received two
[1:02:10] talents came and said Lord thou deliver
[1:02:13] unto me two talents behold I have gained
[1:02:16] two other talents beside them so same
[1:02:19] thing he multiply
[1:02:21] it his Lord in verse 23 said unto him
[1:02:24] listen well done good and faithful
[1:02:28] servant thou has been Faithful over a
[1:02:30] few things I will make the ruler over
[1:02:33] many things enter thou into the joy of
[1:02:36] thy Lord what what we observe it didn't
[1:02:39] matter that one had five and one had two
[1:02:43] the Master's comments the master
[1:02:46] dialogue the conversation they had the
[1:02:49] conclusion was the same they had been
[1:02:52] faithful according to their measure
[1:02:57] listen he saw them as
[1:03:01] equal if they looked at each other you
[1:03:04] might just say but that's the great one
[1:03:06] he give he give him five God find favor
[1:03:09] with him the Lord bless him more the
[1:03:12] Lord give him more but no the Lord said
[1:03:16] listen you and you although you had five
[1:03:20] and you had two you have been faithful
[1:03:22] in a few things so I want to make you
[1:03:25] ruler over many things so it doesn't
[1:03:28] matter your ability is different to your
[1:03:31] neighbor and your brother and your
[1:03:32] cousin and your uncle so you still have
[1:03:34] to focus on you being ready is an
[1:03:37] individual
[1:03:39] Affair it went on and he said and we
[1:03:42] know it he that had received the one
[1:03:45] Talent came and said Lord I knew thee
[1:03:47] that thou art a hard man well he starred
[1:03:49] bad because he knew he was a hard man
[1:03:52] now if you know is a hard man
[1:03:56] how you will behave the way this one
[1:03:58] behave but I think it's a good example
[1:04:01] we know the God we serve is not is not a
[1:04:03] normal being you know the God I serve is
[1:04:06] a terrible God you know he's a jealous
[1:04:08] God you know he's a god of mercy and
[1:04:10] love and he's kind and gracious and you
[1:04:13] know he really likes to take care of his
[1:04:15] children but listen when he declare war
[1:04:18] and destruction and
[1:04:19] judgment nothing will stand in his way
[1:04:22] you know he's no respect to persons you
[1:04:25] he don't care how long you're in the
[1:04:27] message and who your father is and the
[1:04:29] fact that you used to come on a
[1:04:30] Wednesday night he not concerned about
[1:04:33] that you know his word is his word his
[1:04:35] requirement his requirement in Egypt
[1:04:37] when he say put the blood on the door
[1:04:39] post what then what excuse you have for
[1:04:43] not doing it you and Moses you grew up
[1:04:46] together Moses your partner your uncle
[1:04:49] knew Moses and all you listen you all
[1:04:52] used to travel together and you say Maxi
[1:04:55] no it didn't matter what then all he
[1:04:58] want to see is the
[1:05:01] blood that was it will you be ready
[1:05:05] that's it ready or not that angel was
[1:05:07] coming he wasn't going and pause and say
[1:05:10] listen oh you went down listen you had
[1:05:12] some business to to to do you just
[1:05:13] wanted to wrap up some things before no
[1:05:17] the time had come ready or not that
[1:05:19] angel was about to strike you had to be
[1:05:21] inside with your doors locked with blood
[1:05:23] on your door poost if you didn't have
[1:05:26] that you didn't have on your paper the
[1:05:27] answer that was required to your failure
[1:05:30] exam that was your portion that was
[1:05:37] it in verse 25 of the same scripture he
[1:05:40] said I was afraid and went and hid thy
[1:05:43] talent in the earth Lo where thou Hast
[1:05:46] thine is thine so I have exactly what
[1:05:49] you give me time pass with time value of
[1:05:53] money and inflation listen that was even
[1:05:55] worth less than the the master give him
[1:05:57] that's time pass with inflation what the
[1:06:01] master could do with that that was a
[1:06:03] loss listen God not in the Lost business
[1:06:05] you know God said listen not one shall
[1:06:07] be lost you know he want everything you
[1:06:10] know he don't want to give up a hoof you
[1:06:12] know when the children of Israel was
[1:06:14] about to leave he said listen take
[1:06:16] everything you know don't leave anything
[1:06:18] behind you know he don't want to leave a
[1:06:20] back know he want everything there's a
[1:06:23] scripture I want to read in a little bit
[1:06:25] but in the end of this one if I went
[1:06:28] down you know just paraphrasing cuz time
[1:06:30] is fast spent and running he said
[1:06:33] listen he cast in verse 30 cast ye the
[1:06:37] unprofitable servant into outer
[1:06:41] Darkness there shall be weeping and
[1:06:43] nashing of
[1:06:45] teeth and he took took the one and G
[1:06:47] give it to the one that had
[1:06:48] 10 at the end of the day when God give
[1:06:52] you a purpose when God give you a
[1:06:55] challenge when God give you a test when
[1:06:58] God give you a
[1:06:59] responsibility you have to be able to
[1:07:01] account to him what you did with that
[1:07:03] you know you have to be able to give a
[1:07:06] proper account of what you did as man of
[1:07:08] the house and guiding your household you
[1:07:10] know you have to be able to give an
[1:07:12] account as the kind of leader you were
[1:07:15] with your children you know the kind of
[1:07:17] example you were you know you as an
[1:07:20] individual have to give an an account of
[1:07:23] that and it's interesting in Hebrews I
[1:07:27] don't want to read the whole thing but
[1:07:29] we often refer to them as The Heroes of
[1:07:30] Faith you know we know Abraham waited
[1:07:33] for 25 years
[1:07:41] right and as we went through in Hebrews
[1:07:44] 11 from verse 17 to 23 I'm not going to
[1:07:47] read the whole thing you know he talk
[1:07:49] about by faith
[1:07:50] Abraham it went on it say by faith Isaac
[1:07:55] by faith Jacob Joseph Moses and it goes
[1:07:58] on you ever take note that he didn't
[1:08:01] say by big Faith
[1:08:04] Abraham by average Faith Joseph by
[1:08:08] Alessa faith we look at Moses kind of
[1:08:12] had Faith but you know he had a little
[1:08:14] anger challenge he smoked the rock no
[1:08:18] when they made account of these guys
[1:08:22] they say listen in verse 17 by faith
[1:08:24] Abraham
[1:08:28] in verse 20 by faith
[1:08:30] Isaac 21 by faith Jacob 22 by faith
[1:08:34] Joseph 23 by faith Moses it made no
[1:08:38] distinction of the level of faith and
[1:08:41] the quality of faith and the the time it
[1:08:43] took to really test that faith and
[1:08:45] Joseph kind of waited kind of long not
[1:08:48] as long as but kind of so we will give
[1:08:50] him a a B+ and Abraham will get a
[1:08:54] because he no
[1:08:56] they all had their own trials their own
[1:08:59] challenges they operated in their own
[1:09:02] context their own
[1:09:04] circumstances and they had to be ready
[1:09:06] and give an account of their faith given
[1:09:09] their circumstances amen you see many
[1:09:12] times when called to account we find
[1:09:14] ourselves comparing to others right we
[1:09:17] didn't get the same test but we
[1:09:19] concerned about
[1:09:21] others we don't have the same ability
[1:09:23] but we're looking at other people
[1:09:25] we don't have the same weaknesses or
[1:09:27] strengths the same skills Etc God call
[1:09:31] you as an individual just like he called
[1:09:34] Abraham and said Abraham listen I want
[1:09:36] you
[1:09:36] come Gideon you
[1:09:39] come the littlest that's okay I want you
[1:09:43] I don't want your brother listen when he
[1:09:45] called David he say you you mining sheep
[1:09:48] I want you when Jesus wanted to choose
[1:09:51] disciples he didn't say listen let me go
[1:09:53] to this church you see the whole front
[1:09:55] through follow me everybody everybody
[1:09:57] come no he say listen
[1:09:59] Peter Matthew James John
[1:10:04] Andrew he called
[1:10:10] individuals you are so
[1:10:13] unique they say with the billions in the
[1:10:15] world you alone have that
[1:10:18] fingerprint imagine
[1:10:21] that because God chose you as an
[1:10:24] individual which as specialist Mission
[1:10:27] because he knew in the end time he
[1:10:28] needed
[1:10:30] Specialists it it's not it's not the
[1:10:32] masses he looking for he looking for
[1:10:34] people who could surrender to him that
[1:10:37] could throw away their
[1:10:39] will and adopt his
[1:10:42] own and be led by him so he could lead
[1:10:45] their path he could guide them because
[1:10:48] those are people he could
[1:10:50] use he he he you don't want he halfway
[1:10:53] thing he want you fully he surrendered
[1:10:55] to him the same the prophet say listen a
[1:10:58] preacher could be
[1:10:59] halfway but God go on
[1:11:04] that I know time is far
[1:11:07] spent but
[1:11:10] listen when God ready for you you could
[1:11:13] run you know he could allow you to run
[1:11:15] but you can't
[1:11:17] hide you see Jonah thought at some point
[1:11:21] he could run he thought he was real
[1:11:23] bright he was you say bolt boat Edition
[1:11:27] he could move real fast so in Jonah in
[1:11:31] the Book of Jonah he said in verse one
[1:11:33] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[1:11:35] the son of amatti saying arise go to
[1:11:37] Nineveh that great City and I wouldn't
[1:11:39] read the whole thing and cry against it
[1:11:41] for their wickedness has come up before
[1:11:43] me so guess
[1:11:46] what he didn't call
[1:11:49] Moses he didn't call David he called
[1:11:53] Jonah Jonah hear what
[1:11:55] that place is so wicked the wickedness
[1:11:58] come up to me I want you to go and deal
[1:12:01] with
[1:12:01] that you are the man for the job in
[1:12:05] verse three but Jonah rose up to flee
[1:12:07] unto tashes from the presence of the
[1:12:09] Lord and went down to joper and he found
[1:12:11] a ship going to tashes so he paid the
[1:12:14] fear thereof and he went down into it to
[1:12:16] go with them unto tashes from the
[1:12:18] presence of the Lord Joseph was running
[1:12:21] he was on the Run he was on the Move
[1:12:24] listen Joseph wasn't a sorry Jonah sorry
[1:12:27] he wasn't a prisoner no he didn't have a
[1:12:29] ankle bracelet that that GPS could
[1:12:32] monitor him as he go you know know he
[1:12:34] thought he
[1:12:36] gone God wants him go east he going west
[1:12:38] God wants him go up he going down he
[1:12:40] going far far far far far because in his
[1:12:44] mind he running he running he running
[1:12:48] not knowing that God always a few steps
[1:12:51] ahead that's right because listen when
[1:12:54] God call you he know all the mistakes
[1:12:57] you're going to make that's he know all
[1:12:59] your failures are in advance that's why
[1:13:01] he he put the test the way he structured
[1:13:04] the test that's right you don't take a
[1:13:06] six-year-old and give them University
[1:13:08] test that's right you give them test at
[1:13:10] their level because you know you might
[1:13:13] get a B+ here know but you will learn
[1:13:15] from that and you'll be matured enough
[1:13:17] to understand so by the time you reach
[1:13:19] your big test you're qualified for that
[1:13:22] amen so Jonah and we know this story he
[1:13:25] tried to run and he jump off he jump out
[1:13:28] into the water he say listen it's me is
[1:13:31] me is me right in verse 15 they took up
[1:13:34] Jonah and cast him forth into the sea
[1:13:37] and the Sea ceased from her raging
[1:13:39] because God said listen time up ready
[1:13:42] for you you run long enough you play
[1:13:45] yourself you had a good time you ly you
[1:13:50] believe you're in secret you believe you
[1:13:53] doing you do but I ready for now so I
[1:13:55] will shake up things around you I will
[1:13:57] turn your wife against you I will turn
[1:14:00] the church against you because it's you
[1:14:01] I want I call you and I have a job for
[1:14:05] you so you could only run so much you
[1:14:08] can't hide from me I seeing you still so
[1:14:12] he said listen the man feared the Lord
[1:14:15] exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto
[1:14:17] the Lord and made vows now the Lord had
[1:14:20] prepared because at this point
[1:14:23] overboard gone
[1:14:26] give up the ghost you know he believe
[1:14:29] that is the only answer throw me
[1:14:32] out now the Lord had prepared a great
[1:14:34] fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was
[1:14:37] in the belly of the fish three days and
[1:14:39] three
[1:14:41] nights can you imagine that three days
[1:14:44] and three
[1:14:45] nights and remember brother BR give a St
[1:14:48] Story one time about a man and he said
[1:14:51] the man took a ball I believe and he
[1:14:53] stuck it in the mouth of of a fish and
[1:14:56] the fish almost choked you say you see
[1:14:59] look the fish almost died how Jonah
[1:15:02] could fit in a fish if a fish can even
[1:15:05] swallow a ball a hand could barely go in
[1:15:08] a fish
[1:15:09] mouth brother brand he heard that he
[1:15:12] said
[1:15:12] listen you didn't read you didn't read
[1:15:15] the Bible he said if you read the Bible
[1:15:18] and they went back and for he said if
[1:15:19] you read it correctly you would see that
[1:15:22] it was a prepared fish amen it wasn't
[1:15:26] the fish you you fish in the pond next
[1:15:28] door it wasn't the little bait you throw
[1:15:30] out and you find well I catch a a big
[1:15:33] bass or
[1:15:34] something real big super wasn't that no
[1:15:38] this was a special remember I told you
[1:15:40] God always a few steps ahead you God
[1:15:44] knew that when all was against the rops
[1:15:49] and his back was against the wall he
[1:15:51] knew Jonah was ending in the water you
[1:15:53] know
[1:15:55] so all he run Jonah ran and he thought
[1:15:58] he was real bright and he was fast God
[1:16:01] had a prepared fish for
[1:16:04] him and in a message scriptural sign of
[1:16:07] of the times verse uh paragraph 86 sorry
[1:16:11] he says now I've heard people say I was
[1:16:13] prayed for last night and my hand is no
[1:16:16] better I'm still crippled I still have a
[1:16:19] stomach ache my eyes I don't see good
[1:16:22] yet oh my then holl Jonah
[1:16:26] if anybody had a case of symptoms he
[1:16:29] ought to have it if he looked this way
[1:16:32] was whale belly that way was whale belly
[1:16:35] everywhere he looked was whale's belly
[1:16:37] his hands was tied behind him remember
[1:16:40] he was thrown overboard he was in a
[1:16:42] whales belly at the bottom of the sea
[1:16:44] probably 40 fathoms deep in the bottom
[1:16:46] of the sea now talk about symptoms then
[1:16:49] you call him backslid but you know what
[1:16:51] he said they are lying vanities I won't
[1:16:54] even look at them but once more I would
[1:16:56] look to the Holy Temple Lord paragraph
[1:16:59] 89 now Jonah knew when Solomon dedicated
[1:17:02] the temple he prayed and said Lord If
[1:17:05] thy people be in trouble anywhere and
[1:17:08] look unto this holy place they hear from
[1:17:11] heaven and he had that much confidence
[1:17:14] in the prayer of a man that backslid so
[1:17:16] imagine God listening to Jonah that made
[1:17:19] a prayer how much more there is none of
[1:17:23] us in that condition tonight
[1:17:25] there is none of of us with that kind of
[1:17:28] symptoms and then we look at our
[1:17:30] symptoms why why if he could have that
[1:17:33] much confidence in the prayer of a man
[1:17:35] that backslid when we asked to look to
[1:17:38] heaven where Jesus sits at the right
[1:17:40] hand of the Majesty on high in a temple
[1:17:43] not made with hands he is expected in
[1:17:46] there to intercede upon your
[1:17:49] confession how much more should we
[1:17:51] ignore our symptoms so you mean it don't
[1:17:53] matter how it look tonight
[1:17:55] it don't matter how you feel tonight you
[1:17:57] already healed you're already delivered
[1:18:00] you're already set free by your
[1:18:04] confession once more I look to thy holy
[1:18:07] promise Lord oh my when we see God on
[1:18:10] the scene now we find out that Jonah
[1:18:13] they said this whale carried him in
[1:18:15] there for three days and nights and took
[1:18:18] him all the way back down backtrack the
[1:18:21] course so he thought he was going well
[1:18:23] you going back amen wherever he thought
[1:18:26] he was going he was going back they said
[1:18:28] backtrack the course went over and now
[1:18:31] the people of Nineveh had become like
[1:18:33] they are in the rest of the world now
[1:18:36] their great commercial World their
[1:18:38] industry was fishing and all the man
[1:18:41] fished all the men fished and they
[1:18:44] worshiped idols and the whale was the
[1:18:47] sea god and one day about
[1:18:49] 11:00 while they were all out there
[1:18:52] fishing here come their sea in and
[1:18:54] licked out his tongue and the prophet
[1:18:57] walked off the Gangplank no wonder they
[1:19:01] repented uh-huh see there was a sign
[1:19:04] that was a sign so you tell me you think
[1:19:07] God didn't know they they worship idols
[1:19:10] you think God didn't know they had a sea
[1:19:11] god so God didn't prepare this F this
[1:19:14] probably was the biggest fish they had
[1:19:16] seen in their mind this is the greatest
[1:19:18] Idol they had ever seen this might have
[1:19:20] been the greatest life manifestation in
[1:19:22] front their eyes that they had witnessed
[1:19:24] and a prophet walking out and tell them
[1:19:26] repent they had no choice their time was
[1:19:30] up listen they had to be ready at this
[1:19:33] point and Jonah had to be ready after
[1:19:36] the running three days three nights in
[1:19:38] whale belly if you're not ready
[1:19:41] something
[1:19:43] wrong three days and three nights and
[1:19:46] you're not ready
[1:19:47] yet oh
[1:19:51] my blessed be his name I'm almost
[1:19:55] finished but endure a little bit more a
[1:19:58] little longer a little longer we often
[1:20:01] read the scripture of Elijah and we look
[1:20:03] at Elijah when they're calling for rain
[1:20:06] and the prophets of Baal would come and
[1:20:09] they would do their their thing they do
[1:20:12] their thing and they fail and we would
[1:20:14] look at the fact that he said rebuild
[1:20:17] the Altar and and pour water pour water
[1:20:21] again and fire would come down
[1:20:25] now in First Kings
[1:20:27] 18 after that scenario there is
[1:20:31] something I believe significant that
[1:20:32] takes place first Kings
[1:20:36] 18:36 and it says it came to pass at the
[1:20:39] time of the offering of the evening
[1:20:40] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came
[1:20:42] near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac
[1:20:44] and of Israel let it be known this day
[1:20:47] that thou art God in Israel and I am thy
[1:20:50] servant that I have done all these
[1:20:51] things at Thy word this is when he set
[1:20:53] everything in motion
[1:20:55] he said hear me oh Lord hear me that
[1:20:57] this people may know that thou art the
[1:20:59] Lord God and thou has turned their heart
[1:21:02] back again and then the fire of the Lord
[1:21:04] fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice
[1:21:07] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:21:09] and licked up the water that was in the
[1:21:11] trench and when all the people saw it
[1:21:13] they fell on their faces and they said
[1:21:14] the Lord he is the god the Lord he is
[1:21:18] the god and listen to this part this is
[1:21:21] an instruction in verse 40
[1:21:24] and Elijah said unto them listen take
[1:21:27] the prophets of Baal yes let not one of
[1:21:30] them Escape so you see these false
[1:21:32] prophets that was parading the self he
[1:21:35] said take all of them don't let any
[1:21:39] of recant and repent and turn back now
[1:21:43] because they had their time to shine
[1:21:46] they had their time to be on display he
[1:21:48] said let not one of them escape and took
[1:21:50] them and Elijah brought them down to the
[1:21:52] brook of Kishon and and slew them there
[1:21:56] all of them and Elijah said unto Ahab
[1:22:00] get thee up eat and drink for there's
[1:22:02] the sound of the abundance of rain so
[1:22:06] Ahab went up to eat and drink and Elijah
[1:22:09] went up to the top of caramel and he
[1:22:11] cast himself down upon the Earth and put
[1:22:13] his face between his knees and he said
[1:22:15] to his servant go up now look towards
[1:22:18] the sea and he went up and looked and of
[1:22:21] course the servant said there is nothing
[1:22:23] he said go against seven times and in
[1:22:26] verse 44 it came to pass at the seventh
[1:22:29] time that he said behold there ariseth a
[1:22:32] little Cloud out of the sea like a man's
[1:22:35] hand and he said go up say unto Ahab
[1:22:38] same Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get
[1:22:42] thee down that the rain stop thee not
[1:22:45] and it came to pass remember there was
[1:22:47] no
[1:22:48] rain and in verse 45 it came to pass in
[1:22:51] the meanwhile that the heaven was black
[1:22:53] with clouds and wind and there was great
[1:22:55] rain and Ahab rot and went to jezel and
[1:22:59] the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and
[1:23:01] he GED up his loins and ran before Ahab
[1:23:04] to the entrance of jezrael so in this
[1:23:07] scripture here it showed listen when it
[1:23:10] was time when it came time for rain to
[1:23:14] come after the slaughter of the false
[1:23:18] prophets nothing could stop this raining
[1:23:21] this rain was coming in abundance
[1:23:24] nothing could stop it the prophet had
[1:23:27] spoken already and the fire had fallen
[1:23:30] and the rain was coming he said go and
[1:23:33] warn them go in front because the rain
[1:23:35] will stop it's so much rain will stop
[1:23:37] you if you don't move now now it reminds
[1:23:40] me there's a scripture in Kings in
[1:23:42] Second Kings now this one was in first
[1:23:44] Kings Hallelujah in Second Kings and
[1:23:47] I'll paraphrase because I I say time is
[1:23:49] far spent there was three kings going
[1:23:51] into battle in Second Kings
[1:23:55] three from verse 9 and I will just just
[1:23:58] kind of skim down a little bit the king
[1:24:01] of Israel went and the king of Judah and
[1:24:03] the king of of e Edom three of them and
[1:24:06] they fetch a compass of seven days
[1:24:08] journey so they planned their Trail and
[1:24:11] there was no water for the host for the
[1:24:13] cattle that followed them and I skipped
[1:24:15] down a little bit and they said
[1:24:18] listen find a
[1:24:20] prophet find a prophet in the land it's
[1:24:26] say in verse 11 is there not a prophet
[1:24:29] of the Lord that we may inquire of the
[1:24:31] Lord by him and one of the king of
[1:24:33] Israel's servants answered and said here
[1:24:35] is Elisha the son of shaffat which
[1:24:38] poured water on the hands of Elijah so
[1:24:40] this is the linkage now so Elijah we saw
[1:24:43] is the one after the slaughter had the
[1:24:46] cloud like a man's hand and rain fell
[1:24:49] sorry and the water came down yes and
[1:24:52] Elisha being we could we could call call
[1:24:56] call this one he is the um he is the
[1:25:02] almost like the mentee he follow after
[1:25:05] he come as the young back on scene right
[1:25:08] and after this scenario he said call
[1:25:12] elishah because he we know he have a
[1:25:14] connection to Elijah and Elijah was a
[1:25:17] powerful man of God and when they call
[1:25:20] Elisha to their
[1:25:23] disappointment he said says what have I
[1:25:25] to do with
[1:25:26] thee you all want to wage war do have
[1:25:29] water how is that my problem how is that
[1:25:32] my
[1:25:33] isue what that have to do with me he
[1:25:36] tell them go to the prophets of thy
[1:25:39] father and to the prophets of thy mother
[1:25:42] the king of Israel said unto him nay for
[1:25:45] the Lord had called these three kings
[1:25:47] together to deliver them into the hand
[1:25:48] of Moab and elishah said as the Lord of
[1:25:52] hosts liveth before whom I stand surely
[1:25:56] were it not that I regard the presence
[1:25:58] of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I would
[1:26:01] not even look toward you I wouldn't even
[1:26:04] see you we wouldn't even be having the
[1:26:06] conversation now he said but you know
[1:26:08] what bring a ministrel play some music
[1:26:12] and they say and it came to pass when
[1:26:14] the Minal played the hand of the Lord
[1:26:16] came upon him and he said thus said the
[1:26:19] Lord make this Valley full of ditches
[1:26:22] for thus said the Lord ye shall not see
[1:26:25] wind neither shall you see rain yet that
[1:26:28] Valley shall be filled with water that
[1:26:30] you may drink both ye and your cattle
[1:26:32] and your beast and this is but a light
[1:26:35] thing he said listen there's not a great
[1:26:37] or grand thing you know he said this is
[1:26:39] but a light thing in the sight of the
[1:26:40] Lord he will also deliver the moabites
[1:26:43] into your hand and you shall Smite every
[1:26:46] fence City every choice City and shall
[1:26:49] fell every good tree and stop all Wells
[1:26:52] of water and Mark every every good piece
[1:26:54] of land with stones and in verse 20 and
[1:26:57] it came to pass in the morning when the
[1:26:59] meat offering was offered that behold
[1:27:02] there came Water by the way of Edom and
[1:27:04] the country was filled with water so
[1:27:06] once again we see listen when the
[1:27:10] prophet
[1:27:11] speaks when thus said the Lord go forth
[1:27:14] when the Lord hand come upon him it
[1:27:18] doesn't matter what going on around here
[1:27:19] it doesn't matter if it's war time if
[1:27:21] it's battle listen just ask what your
[1:27:24] will you know because it going to happen
[1:27:27] ready or not it happening will you be
[1:27:30] ready for the outpouring that he's about
[1:27:32] to pour out would you be ready when he
[1:27:36] come to mark your papers would you be
[1:27:38] ready the musicians could get ready at
[1:27:41] this time just one more quote and and
[1:27:44] we're out in a message the flashing red
[1:27:47] light of the sign of his
[1:27:51] coming paragraph 177 he says are you
[1:27:54] still a church member have you done
[1:27:57] wrong look and search your life over
[1:27:59] tonight men women look at yourself look

[1:28:07] preaching this you say if he would have
[1:28:11] if I had heard him preach that I would
[1:28:13] have repented it's easy to say that if
[1:28:17] you
[1:28:18] would this is his own word
[1:28:21] tonight we not making this up you know
[1:28:23] this this is the word of

[1:28:35] spoke in tongues I had an experience
[1:28:37] with the Lord lay that
[1:28:40] aside look at yourself you remember it

[1:28:45] you know it doesn't matter what happened
[1:28:47] 10 years ago you know it doesn't matter
[1:28:49] what happened yesterday when he come and

[1:28:57] comes will you be
[1:28:59] ready he say it ain't me that's wrong

[1:29:05] is wrong but you say no if there's
[1:29:08] anything wrong about
[1:29:10] it he say you don't know God yet you're
[1:29:13] not sure that if Jesus should come at
[1:29:15] this hour that you'd be ready to go why
