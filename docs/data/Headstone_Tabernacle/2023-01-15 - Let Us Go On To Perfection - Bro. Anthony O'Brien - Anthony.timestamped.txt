[48:57] you're called out to be in that age
[48:59] call out of laodicea to fit into that
[49:03] Holy Spirit slot let us go on to
[49:06] Perfection oh hallelujah praise God so I
[49:11] feel this morning that since last Sunday
[49:13] a declaration is being made
[49:16] in the spirit that's what I picked up in
[49:19] my spirit
[49:20] and all week I was kind of thinking
[49:22] about it thinking about it and I wasn't
[49:24] able to kind of put anything down
[49:26] but uh and I got a real battle
[49:29] because the devil came in my body and
[49:31] started fighting me I didn't have a
[49:33] voice up till Friday Saturday
[49:35] so I'm here this morning by the grace of
[49:37] almighty God
[49:39] amen
[49:40] praise God and so uh just fighting like
[49:44] that amen and just wondering and asking
[49:46] Lord what should I do what should I do
[49:47] here see and all of a sudden 11 o'clock
[49:50] one night bam the water come back
[49:54] and it was gosh after gosh amen
[49:57] so I have this inspiration here now
[49:59] based on that and so this is what God
[50:01] gave me
[50:02] to preach you this morning amen so I
[50:04] pray that it'd be a blessing to you amen
[50:07] amen so I have a thought here when God
[50:10] calls
[50:12] call to Perfection right
[50:14] God is calling us
[50:17] I heard someone say one time a ringing
[50:19] phone
[50:20] must be answered
[50:22] when your phone ringing somebody calling
[50:25] in
[50:26] sometimes you might be able to answer it
[50:29] but you know it's ringing
[50:31] and it's on your mind
[50:33] and it's on your heart
[50:35] you might be in a meeting or it might be
[50:37] in a bank or you might be unable to take
[50:39] the call but if the call is coming
[50:41] through
[50:42] if you realize that a call is coming
[50:44] through it's on your mind
[50:46] it's on your heart and God is calling us
[50:49] this morning
[50:50] because there's a call that he put in
[50:52] your heart
[50:54] and you've got to answer that call this
[50:56] morning only you can answer that call
[50:59] because he's not called and he may not
[51:01] be calling the person next to you but
[51:03] you know he's calling you
[51:05] he may not be calling many people but
[51:07] he's calling you this morning out of
[51:10] billions on the earth going about doing
[51:13] their own thing about their own program
[51:16] but you know in your heart that God is
[51:20] calling you
[51:21] no matter where you go no matter what
[51:24] you do when God calls you've got to
[51:28] answer no matter how long it takes God's
[51:32] phone line is always ringing until you
[51:35] pick up that phone he said behold I
[51:39] stand at the door
[51:40] and knock and if any man answer the door
[51:44] if any man opened the door oh Hallelujah
[51:48] he'll come in there he'll speak with you
[51:51] sometimes you just gotta give God a
[51:53] little time to let him talk to you let
[51:57] him Hallelujah talk to you on the other
[51:59] line cause he wants to tell you
[52:00] something he wants to tell you how
[52:02] wonderful you are he wants to tell you
[52:04] how Glory what glory is inside of you he
[52:07] wants to tell you what promises that he
[52:09] has made for you he wants to tell you
[52:11] that he wants to heal you he wants to
[52:13] deliver you he wants to restore you he
[52:16] wants to do something for you oh but you
[52:19] gotta answer that call this morning
[52:23] do you leave it
[52:24] I believe with all my heart
[52:27] that God is calling us today
[52:30] we have received the call
[52:32] just like John received a call
[52:34] hello is there a journalism
[52:38] waiting around is that right in the
[52:41] spirit when all of a sudden he heard a
[52:44] call come up hither I've got something
[52:47] to show you I've got something to reveal
[52:50] to you but I can't show it to you down
[52:53] there you've got to come up here and
[52:56] very seldom does the call of God allow
[53:00] you to stay where you are you gotta come
[53:04] up where God is God's not gonna stay
[53:07] down there in your atmosphere you got to
[53:11] rise up you've got to stand up you've
[53:14] got to acknowledge God you've got to
[53:17] respond quickly to the spirit when he
[53:21] calls you because if you don't respond
[53:23] you could miss it don't miss it this
[53:27] morning get out of litachy get out of
[53:31] laziness get out of thoughtfulness get
[53:34] out of slackness in your mind God is Not
[53:38] slack concerning his promise like some
[53:42] men count slackness get up and stand up
[53:45] this morning and say Amen to the word of
[53:47] God get up and praise God get up and do
[53:51] something about your salvation before
[53:54] you miss your day of visitation get up
[53:57] and praise God
[53:59] get up in your spirit wake up in your
[54:03] soul get on fire for God oh Hallelujah

[54:10] fire for God or get out now because

[54:18] [Applause]
[54:19] [Music]
[54:22] [Applause]
[54:24] [Music]
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:29] God is called a church
[54:31] out of Jacob's Grace
[54:34] into Joseph perfection
[54:36] Perfection is what is required
[54:40] and when Perfection is required
[54:43] you can't get away with flaws
[54:46] it's no longer admissible
[54:51] error is no longer admissible because
[54:53] that was just perfect has come
[54:55] when that is being presented before you
[54:57] you are now responsible for what is
[54:59] being presented
[55:01] you have to now answer a high Accord
[55:05] and that's where we're at now
[55:07] we're approaching that hour now
[55:09] a glorious Church
[55:12] without spot
[55:13] without wrinkle
[55:16] that is seamless
[55:18] well ironed comment
[55:21] clothed in white
[55:23] praising the name of our God out of
[55:26] every Kindred a nation and tongue John
[55:29] saw them well is that right oh waving
[55:32] palm branches Hosanna Hosanna this song
[55:36] a new song
[55:38] oh hello is that right
[55:41] Hallelujah
[55:43] out of every Church change God's calling
[55:45] a bride he's calling one today just as
[55:48] sure as he did back then but this one
[55:50] will not see death
[55:52] this one will come to Perfection and
[55:55] bring up the dead in Christ
[55:57] amen then upper come Luther upper come
[56:00] Wesley up welcome brother Branham
[56:03] hallelujah oh he said I'll meet you in
[56:06] the morning
[56:06] pray what's he talking about a
[56:09] resurrection call
[56:11] he's waiting on you
[56:13] to come to perfection
[56:14] to bring up the sleeping Saints isn't
[56:16] that right
[56:17] so there's no room for error
[56:20] no room the spirit of error there's no
[56:22] room for that
[56:23] just like there was no room for the
[56:25] dragon when he was kicked out of heaven
[56:27] the Bible said there was no room found
[56:31] for him
[56:32] amen there was no room for slackness no
[56:36] room for lies no room for lust no room
[56:39] for any error appraisal isn't that right
[56:41] no room for human interpretations no
[56:44] room for other stories or other versions
[56:47] of God's word there's no room for that
[56:50] color that was kicked out of heaven and
[56:53] just as that was kicked out of heaven we
[56:55] are kicking it out down here too because
[56:57] we are agents hallelujah hallelujah of
[57:01] God's kingdom and we represent God here
[57:04] on Earth Hallelujah and as it is in
[57:06] heaven so shall it be on the edge
[57:08] Hallelujah and whatever you find under
[57:10] Heaven is whatever you lose in heaven is
[57:14] loose on Earth God's gonna give you
[57:16] power and authority to lock up the devil
[57:20] and to lose hallelujah
[57:22] oh Hallelujah the spirit of God glory to
[57:27] God hallelujah
[57:29] but you've got to come to perfection
[57:32] in order to see that kind of Power
[57:34] released
[57:36] email it's not right First Corinthians
[57:38] 13 says do I speak with the tongues of
[57:41] men and angels
[57:44] and have not charity
[57:46] I am because a sounding brass and a
[57:49] tingling simple just a noise
[57:52] just uh just a a a attack flapper that's
[57:56] what you are isn't that right make a lot
[57:59] of a lot of people making a lot of noise

[58:05] platforms to do it on too they do it on
[58:07] Facebook on YouTube they have access to
[58:10] all kinds of stuff to make sounding
[58:12] brass and to make plenty tingling
[58:14] symbols oh but no charity anyway isn't
[58:17] that right we've got to come to that
[58:18] praise God that is the mark for the
[58:21] price of the high calling that we have
[58:23] to press towards otherwise we just
[58:25] wasting time otherwise we're just making
[58:28] circles in the deserts but this morning

[58:37] land that God sworn to your fathers

[59:17] is a condition for that

[1:05:01] guys or through the platform of
[1:05:04] whatever it is isn't that right
[1:05:06] people have their own agendas
[1:05:08] they start off real good like so
[1:05:12] but they have their own agendas
[1:05:14] and if they don't have the character and
[1:05:16] the nature it takes for leadership or
[1:05:19] for power they usually fall off the
[1:05:21] wagon at some point in time but God
[1:05:24] needs you to be strong and to be of a
[1:05:27] good courage he needs you to follow to
[1:05:30] be totally surrendered in him
[1:05:32] that's how you get strong it's when you
[1:05:35] surrender oh it's when you give up your
[1:05:38] rights share all of your rights away it
[1:05:42] means shave it off it means tear it off

[1:06:11] yourself and take God to perfect you and
[1:06:14] take Christ to perfect you so what you
[1:06:17] need to do is surrender oh Hallelujah
[1:06:20] there is non-righteous no not one

[1:09:32] gate of the enemy and when Jesus died he
[1:09:36] died to connect you to Abraham's Royal
[1:09:39] seed that means a promise upon the seed
[1:09:42] is upon you this morning you have been
[1:09:46] connected by the Royal bloodline of
[1:09:49] Jesus Christ himself to possess the
[1:09:52] enemy's Gates

[1:09:55] foreign
[1:09:55] [Music]

[1:10:07] Darkly but then face to face

[1:10:30] Ghost that's how God knows you one day
[1:10:32] you're gonna come into that stage right
[1:10:34] now you might be in a temporary way but
[1:10:36] tell the devil this morning he is still
[1:10:39] working on me God is not finished with
[1:10:42] me yet all other arms is still being
[1:10:44] worked on oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:10:48] the master builder is still working on

[1:10:54] yet he might be silent he might not be
[1:10:57] doing anything right now he might look
[1:10:59] like he just standing still but he's
[1:11:01] watching your attitude he's watching you
[1:11:04] to see if you're gonna be consistent oh
[1:11:08] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:10] hallelujah
[1:11:13] foreign
[1:11:15] I learned recently there's a difference
[1:11:16] between consistency
[1:11:18] and intensity
[1:11:21] there are times in life when we have our
[1:11:22] intensity
[1:11:23] so that's like Crisis
[1:11:27] when things go wrong we get intense
[1:11:28] about it
[1:11:30] let's gather a team together let's sort
[1:11:32] this out let's fix this problem that's
[1:11:34] intensity
[1:11:35] but as soon as the problem is fixed you
[1:11:37] usually go back to the default setting
[1:11:40] to your regular scheduled program
[1:11:43] that's intensity there are times in life
[1:11:46] when you have intensity when there's
[1:11:47] need for an adrenaline rush
[1:11:49] but what I realized what more and more
[1:11:51] God wants is not just not intensity but
[1:11:54] a consistency
[1:11:56] of every day
[1:11:58] doing the will of God every day pressing
[1:12:02] every day striving every day praying a
[1:12:06] little bit lying upon line precept upon
[1:12:09] precept hear a little Fair little he
[1:12:13] told the children of Israel little by
[1:12:16] little you're gonna conquer the land oh
[1:12:19] it's unfolding this morning or little by
[1:12:22] little you're gonna conquer little by
[1:12:25] little as you claim a border maintain
[1:12:28] your ground keep the enemy off of it

[1:12:34] keep the grass green oh and when you're
[1:12:36] ready claim some more land then maintain
[1:12:40] it keep on moving just keep moving the
[1:12:43] prophet said until every fella
[1:12:47] take his place then you'll see the
[1:12:51] Church of God come into its Mighty power
[1:12:53] then you'll see another anania Center

[1:13:42] is of Jesus is so imminent
[1:13:44] the coming of judgment we know this
[1:13:45] quote
[1:13:46] and I feel it fits in here he said
[1:13:48] calling calling is elect together
[1:13:50] in Oneness with himself with the same
[1:13:53] kind of a Ministry he had
[1:13:56] he said you know how I shape the church
[1:13:57] ages here not too long ago about the big
[1:14:01] tower that was built called the pyramid
[1:14:04] but the headstone was never put on him
[1:14:05] he said and remember now the lutherans
[1:14:08] came and then the Wesley is in the
[1:14:10] minority then they come down to
[1:14:12] Pentecost and he said now what is he
[1:14:14] doing he said calling from that
[1:14:18] he said what did he do he called out the
[1:14:20] elect to make the Lutheran and then he
[1:14:23] called out the elect out of the
[1:14:24] lutherans isn't that right to make the
[1:14:26] Wesleyan then he called out the elect
[1:14:28] out of that to make the Pentecostal and
[1:14:32] now he's calling today the elect
[1:14:34] Pentecostals out to make the headstone

[1:15:16] this morning the very reason you are in
[1:15:18] this church the very reason you could
[1:15:21] hear the voice of God is because God put
[1:15:24] a receptor inside of your heart before
[1:15:27] the foundation of the world so that you
[1:15:30] can hear this call or you would never
[1:15:33] hear it but God predestinated you before
[1:15:36] the foundation of the world
[1:15:39] to hear the call of God
[1:15:43] in your life
[1:15:44] oh Hallelujah and what has he done he's

[1:16:03] the word it's the same voice it's the
[1:16:06] same thing see anything contrary to that

[1:20:25] others
[1:20:30] yeah yeah amen
[1:20:32] expecting others to be as our
[1:20:33] expectation
[1:20:34] when the reality is there's none perfect
[1:20:36] there's none without sin
[1:20:39] God died for us and set us free
[1:20:43] Hallelujah he paid for all or or
[1:20:45] salvation or Redemption he died for all
[1:20:49] perfecting praise God so that we can be
[1:20:51] perfected he made a way for Perfection
[1:20:54] when he died on that Cross isn't that
[1:20:57] right and when he died I was lost in sin
[1:21:01] I I didn't have a leg to stand on I
[1:21:04] couldn't defend myself I couldn't help
[1:21:07] myself but when he died he set me free
[1:21:11] he was beaten he was stripped he was cut
[1:21:16] he was bruised he screamed ouch he cried
[1:21:21] out he said my father forgive me but I
[1:21:25] forgive them but they don't know what
[1:21:27] they're doing he said father father oh
[1:21:30] why has Thou forsaken me he felt
[1:21:32] forsaken all he was paying for the
[1:21:35] Judgment of all your sin of all your
[1:21:38] filth of all your or unbelief he paid
[1:21:41] for all of that and he set you free and
[1:21:45] he let you go and he took it away from
[1:21:49] you and he didn't hold it against you he
[1:21:52] said not guilty
[1:21:55] oh
[1:21:56] oh we ought to praise God this morning
[1:21:59] because he set you free
[1:22:02] and now listen

[1:22:31] saying this morning when Jesus died for
[1:22:34] me to set me free he didn't hold it
[1:22:37] against me so why should I hold it
[1:22:41] against you I don't have the right to
[1:22:44] even hold it
[1:22:45] [Applause]
[1:22:46] vengeance's mindset God

[1:22:59] perfection
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:03] share all your rights away
[1:23:06] in this world of sin

[1:23:16] angry forever
[1:23:18] to be animosity and to be jealous or
[1:23:21] whatever forever isn't that right
[1:23:22] hallelujah it's not right God bless him

[1:23:26] I forgiven a robot
[1:23:28] you see that but
[1:23:30] God that's what is in trouble God have
[1:23:32] to remove that but
[1:23:34] and God will keep selling hot Tire
[1:23:36] trials hot tests hot persecution he'll
[1:23:40] do what he have to do to get you to
[1:23:42] learn of him
[1:23:45] whatever it takes
[1:23:48] if he tried Moses he's gonna try you too
[1:23:50] if he tried Joseph he's gonna try you to
[1:23:54] if he tried David isn't that right but
[1:23:57] that's Stephen Oliver you know he talked
[1:23:59] about David on Friday oh I had David to
[1:24:02] pass through a long hard way the throne
[1:24:04] was always his the crown was always his
[1:24:07] but he had to go through some hard stuff
[1:24:10] he had to go through some hatred he had
[1:24:12] to go through some jealousy he had to go
[1:24:15] through some Envy he had to fight for
[1:24:17] his life he had to learn to take care of
[1:24:20] the man that he had under him because he
[1:24:22] had a kingdom to take care of later on
[1:24:24] oh Our God was training him on the back
[1:24:28] side of the deserts he trained him with
[1:24:30] a lion treat him with a bear getting him
[1:24:33] ready to meet his Goliath and even after
[1:24:35] Goliath he still had one more River to
[1:24:38] Cross
[1:24:39] Hallelujah it took a long time
[1:24:43] [Applause]
[1:24:44] Oh Glory Glory Glory God took the
[1:24:49] children of Israel to 40 Years of no
[1:24:51] illness some of them backslid some of
[1:24:54] them lost their lives but God was trying
[1:24:56] to get him to the promised land and if
[1:24:59] the elders didn't want church then God
[1:25:00] raised up a bunch of young people why
[1:25:03] because there's one more River to Cross
[1:25:06] oh it took a long time but God is
[1:25:10] finally getting a church ready to meet
[1:25:12] him in a Rapture to meet him in a great
[1:25:15] going home now I'm going up yonder let

[1:26:58] God is faithful
[1:27:00] he will perform it
[1:27:02] isn't that right the other day I had a
[1:27:04] little experience I was pulling a pen
[1:27:07] apart and there's a little ring inside
[1:27:08] of the pen that used to mount Depend and
[1:27:10] fell on the ground in the night and I
[1:27:12] couldn't see it I said Lord
[1:27:14] looking for the ring can't find it said
[1:27:16] Lord help me to find a ring
[1:27:18] after a while I got kind of tired and I
[1:27:20] said you know what it's getting late
[1:27:21] I'll go inside forget about the ring
[1:27:24] tiny little mechanism
[1:27:26] and one no one's in the road yeah cars
[1:27:29] passing all the time
[1:27:30] foreign
[1:27:31] so I come back the next day
[1:27:34] come out of the car open the door
[1:27:36] and as I look down there's the ring
[1:27:40] intact
[1:27:42] in the same
[1:27:43] condition it was when it when it left me
[1:27:47] I said look how in a simple thing look
[1:27:49] how fateful God is with them
[1:27:52] I asked him just to just to restore it
[1:27:54] to me I can't see
[1:27:55] I don't have the eyes to see I said Lord
[1:27:58] you helped me see and he was faithful
[1:28:00] enough to bring it right in front of my
[1:28:01] foot
[1:28:03] God is faithful
[1:28:05] if he is faithful in those little things
[1:28:07] just think about how much God will be
[1:28:10] faithful in your circumstance
[1:28:14] think about how much God is faithful in
[1:28:16] your situation
[1:28:18] oh Hallelujah he's faithful he's just
[1:28:21] waiting for you to have the right
[1:28:23] attitude
[1:28:24] sometimes because you say the right
[1:28:26] thing oh Hallelujah sometimes it's when
[1:28:29] you pray for your enemy instead of
[1:28:31] rejoicing for his fall that's when God's
[1:28:34] getting ready to bless you but he lets
[1:28:37] thing happen to see what you're going to
[1:28:39] do
[1:28:39] pray what are you gonna do about it oh
[1:28:43] Hallelujah
[1:28:45] sometimes I feel like we we you know we
[1:28:47] in a we're in a room
[1:28:49] and and God is looking at us through a
[1:28:51] two-way glass
[1:28:53] he's seeing you you can't see him
[1:28:55] amen amen but he sent this one to talk
[1:28:58] to you you send that one to talk to you
[1:28:59] ask some questions find out what
[1:29:01] happened on the night of this on the 9th
[1:29:03] of 16th amen
[1:29:06] and God is looking at you praise God to
[1:29:08] see what your answer is going to be
[1:29:10] because in that atmosphere he knows all
[1:29:12] things praise God he knows when he's
[1:29:14] going to bless you how he's going to
[1:29:16] bless you how it's going to unfold you
[1:29:19] don't have to worry about it you just
[1:29:21] keep on your eyes on the cross praise
[1:29:24] God cut your eyes off everybody else
[1:29:26] keep your eyes on Jesus Oh I pray for
[1:29:29] your brother pray for your sister they
[1:29:32] need help you need help we all need
[1:29:34] Jesus pray
[1:29:37] s God if your brother's struggling pray
[1:29:39] for him he needs Jesus you need Jesus I
[1:29:42] need Jesus we all need Jesus this
[1:29:45] morning it take Jesus to perfect us and
[1:29:48] take Jesus Hallelujah to bring us
[1:29:50] through this long way oh how about don't
[1:29:53] you worry you are going to cross that
[1:29:55] River this morning oh Hallelujah don't
[1:29:58] you worry about it
[1:30:00] God's got it figured out this morning
[1:30:03] amen oh Hallelujah praise God so we
[1:30:07] can't perfect ourselves right
[1:30:09] if God called somebody that was already
[1:30:11] perfect think about this then it would
[1:30:13] be by their mind
[1:30:15] and by their power
[1:30:17] that you would say that they would have
[1:30:18] done it
[1:30:19] but it's not by Almighty neither is it
[1:30:22] by your power but it's by his Spirit say
[1:30:25] the Lord of hosts it's not right when I
[1:30:29] think about that I think about Moses
[1:30:31] because Moses was a man of great
[1:30:33] educations but God had to beat that out
[1:30:36] of him
[1:30:37] Prophet said very seldom does God call
[1:30:39] men of great educations to do a great
[1:30:42] work anytime God's getting ready to do
[1:30:44] something great he needs somebody who
[1:30:47] don't know the ABCs who struggle who who
[1:30:50] can't talk who who don't feel confident
[1:30:52] in themselves because if you confident
[1:30:55] in yourself you will think it's you who
[1:30:57] made it you will think it's you who
[1:30:59] overcome you will think you will be by
[1:31:01] your Works lest some man should boast
[1:31:04] but it's not by your Works lest any man
[1:31:06] should post but in spite of Grace of
[1:31:08] almighty God he put a call in your heart
[1:31:11] this morning oh have patience with your
[1:31:15] brother have patience with your sister
[1:31:18] it's a grace of God for all of us oh
[1:31:21] it's a mercy of God for all of us
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:24] but for the grace of almighty God
[1:31:28] oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:31:33] it's God that's perfecting you
[1:31:36] God that's doing the work of perfection
[1:31:38] God's gonna set things up in your life
[1:31:41] that when he bless you you are going to
[1:31:44] know that it's him
[1:31:46] God is setting things up in your life
[1:31:48] right now I don't know what situation
[1:31:50] you're facing or what circumstance you
[1:31:53] are in but when God is finished with you
[1:31:56] you will know that it was only god oh
[1:32:00] friends it wasn't your strength it
[1:32:03] wasn't your power it wasn't your
[1:32:05] connections it wasn't your education but
[1:32:08] it was called that raised you up oh and
[1:32:12] you didn't have a leg to stand on God
[1:32:15] put your feet on Solid Ground it was
[1:32:17] caught and washed you up it was caught
[1:32:20] that cleaned you out it was God that put
[1:32:23] a desire in your heart it was caught
[1:32:25] inside of you all the time and though he
[1:32:29] slay me yet will I trust him in the
[1:32:32] valley trust him in the desert trust him
[1:32:36] when you don't see no light oh but God
[1:32:39] is my life he is my lamp oh Hallelujah
[1:32:43] onto my feet he is the light unto my
[1:32:46] path yet will I trust in him don't put
[1:32:50] your trust in princes or in Horseman
[1:32:52] where there is no help David said I look
[1:32:56] unto the hills from whence cometh my
[1:32:59] help my help coming from God order the
[1:33:02] god that made the world he could take

[1:33:47] oh Hallelujah
[1:33:50] [Applause]
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:57] Moses knew there was a call of God on
[1:33:58] his life
[1:34:00] but he couldn't do anything about it
[1:34:02] until the time appointed
[1:34:04] until God was get ready to

[1:35:49] James 1 18 James had a servant of God in
[1:35:52] The Lord of Jesus Christ
[1:35:54] to the 12 tribes which are scattered
[1:35:56] about greeting my brethren count it all
[1:35:59] joy

[1:36:04] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:36:07] fate
[1:36:08] worketh patience but let patients watch
[1:36:11] have her perfect work
[1:36:14] that she may be perfect an entire
[1:36:17] wanting nothing amen isn't that right oh
[1:36:21] my hallelujah hallelujah it's not right
[1:36:25] so Perfection has always been a theme
[1:36:26] throughout the Bible
[1:36:28] even Abraham he's spoken to Abraham he
[1:36:29] said come on walk before me
[1:36:31] be thou perfect
[1:36:33] he said that as the tone
[1:36:35] ever since he called a nation out
[1:36:37] is that right for his name's sake he's
[1:36:40] been setting that tone of affection over
[1:36:42] them and even though he knew they
[1:36:44] couldn't achieve it at that time
[1:36:46] God is always thousands of years ahead
[1:36:48] of us
[1:36:49] because he knew that he was going to
[1:36:52] send his son
[1:36:53] as the one perfect sacrifice for us all
[1:36:57] to break away for us to enter truly into
[1:37:01] that Perfection that where Abraham
[1:37:03] failed you are going to achieve where
[1:37:05] Joseph might have failed you're gonna
[1:37:07] achieve where Joshua were different ones
[1:37:09] praise God mine have gone all the way
[1:37:11] they without us are not made perfect God
[1:37:15] having something greater for us oh
[1:37:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:21] foreign
[1:37:25] they did the best they could for their
[1:37:26] day but Perfection this is our mantle to
[1:37:30] to handle
[1:37:32] our responsibility to perform and we've
[1:37:35] got to run our leg of the race the race
[1:37:38] that is set before us we got to run it
[1:37:41] well we've got to run to endure it's not
[1:37:44] a short Dash it's not a hundred meters
[1:37:48] no no no no come on now Amen brother
[1:37:50] Brown a long distance you gotta soak it
[1:37:53] in you've got to get it in stride it
[1:37:55] doesn't happen right away it doesn't
[1:37:57] happen at the start off but after a
[1:37:59] while your lungs get into condition your
[1:38:01] chests get to breathe in Holly you know
[1:38:03] you got a few miles ahead of you oh but
[1:38:06] they've caught me with you you're gonna
[1:38:08] make it oh hallelujah hallelujah don't
[1:38:11] you worry God is with you keep on moving
[1:38:14] on keep on striding keep on running with
[1:38:18] every step you take you're coming closer
[1:38:20] you're coming closer you might get a
[1:38:23] little thirsty but that's all right the
[1:38:26] race is not forever oh no is it for the
[1:38:29] Swift but it is for them who can endure
[1:38:32] on to the end I'm gonna endure for my
[1:38:35] God because he endured for me when the
[1:38:39] cross was on his back he endured for me
[1:38:42] now I'm gonna endure for him and your
[1:38:46] hardness as a good soldier in your
[1:38:50] struggles in your battles in your
[1:38:53] present and your persecution enjoy
[1:38:57] rebuke and your correction enjoy
[1:39:01] instructions

[1:39:44] word you know you can do it I am not God
[1:39:48] you are not God we didn't make the
[1:39:51] promise so God made a promise we just
[1:39:54] conditioning ourselves getting ourselves
[1:39:56] in the right frame of mind the right
[1:39:59] conditions the right attitude for him to
[1:40:02] come and do what he promised he say he

[1:40:25] life it's time for you to move all that
[1:40:28] old stuff out move out everything the

[1:41:14] that give it to all men liberally or
[1:41:16] pray that not it shall be given unto him
[1:41:17] but let him ask in fate not wavering for

[1:45:48] spirit of God you are lost he said
[1:45:51] that's true all the profession Peter had
[1:45:54] all the big shot Peter had Peter Walk On

[1:48:00] and you don't have one thing
[1:48:02] he said there's no priest there's no
[1:48:05] Bishop
[1:48:06] no Pope no nothing else can save you
[1:48:11] because he is just in the same boats as
[1:48:14] you are in
[1:48:15] and you're both drowning he said well
[1:48:17] we're getting into it a few minutes just
[1:48:20] in the same shape he said he was he said
[1:48:22] the pope of Rome was born in sin shaped
[1:48:25] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[1:48:28] lies born by sexual desire of a man and
[1:48:32] woman he said where are you gonna get
[1:48:34] righteousness out of that he said well
[1:48:36] his mama and papa was born the same way
[1:48:38] Prophet said it was sin to begin with
[1:48:41] he said so who can say that this is Holy
[1:48:43] and that is Holy he said there is only
[1:48:46] one thing holy that's Jesus Christ the
[1:48:50] son of the Living God
[1:48:52] oh there is none righteous
[1:48:55] no one was worried to take the book and
[1:48:58] to lose the seals thereof and John wept
[1:49:00] because there was no man worthy to open
[1:49:03] the seals but someone tapped on the
[1:49:05] shoulder and said don't weep one of the
[1:49:07] other said look hello because there is a
[1:49:10] lamb slain before the foundation in the
[1:49:12] world you died in Austin he come out

[1:49:30] one who's holy that's the one who's
[1:49:32] righteous amen not you
[1:49:35] not a
[1:49:36] man but him he said who's made perfect
[1:49:38] sin and our requirement is to be perfect
[1:49:43] he said that now we're going to be see
[1:49:44] try it yourself he said well I hate to
[1:49:46] get to heaven on the on the merits of I
[1:49:48] was born five minutes ago and going out
[1:49:50] of the world now I'd be lost if I never
[1:49:52] thought evil in my life if I never spoke
[1:49:54] about it in my life I never looked at
[1:49:56] anything evil never looked at thought of
[1:49:57] anything evil nothing he said brother
[1:49:59] I'm just as Rank and black and as smarty

[1:50:09] sinner that's correct I have nothing
[1:50:13] there's no way at all I could find any
[1:50:16] price to be paid he said God required
[1:50:18] death
[1:50:20] he said and if I give my own life if I
[1:50:22] give my life then how can I repent he
[1:50:24] said because because the death has got
[1:50:26] to be paid first and God was the only
[1:50:28] one who could lay his life down and take
[1:50:31] it up again so he could become sin and
[1:50:35] lay his life down and pick it up and
[1:50:38] then called it justice and now the debt

[2:00:51] kindness and childish charity to seal
[2:00:55] you up oh and to present a blind a bride
[2:00:58] blameless before him in love isn't that
[2:01:00] right
[2:01:01] it's not right
[2:01:03] that's right
[2:01:05] Hallelujah now he says leaving all the
[2:01:06] doctrine of Christ all the theologians
[2:01:08] all the theology he said no and we know
[2:01:10] all about the deity of uh uh of Jesus
[2:01:13] Christ how he made flesh and all these
[2:01:14] things Paul goes on to explain it here
[2:01:16] he said laying again the foundations of
[2:01:17] repentance from dead Works he said we
[2:01:19] believe that and Faith towards God we
[2:01:21] believe that an adoption of baptism see
[2:01:24] Prophet The Prophet is nailing it down
[2:01:25] now
[2:01:26] because he said let us go on to
[2:01:28] Perfection he's driving a stake so I
[2:01:30] believe this morning we ought to drive a
[2:01:32] stake this morning just as a prophet did
[2:01:34] by inspiration Hallelujah to go on to
[2:01:37] perfection
[2:01:38] amen do you believe it today laying on
[2:01:41] the pants we believe lean our hands
[2:01:42] don't we amen said see all that sure and
[2:01:45] the resurrection of the Dead We believe
[2:01:46] all that he said but now watch see here
[2:01:48] judgment say he said uh judgment and
[2:01:51] spoke of Eternal right okay let me skip
[2:01:53] on down
[2:01:54] amen
[2:01:56] so Perfection come true Jesus Christ he
[2:02:00] died for our perfection
[2:02:01] and Perfection is not an overnight
[2:02:02] process
[2:02:04] can take a little more I don't mean to
[2:02:06] wear you but a few more things here and
[2:02:08] then we close up
[2:02:09] Perfection is not an overnight process
[2:02:14] it's not a one-and-done thing
[2:02:16] it's not a crack shot
[2:02:19] operation
[2:02:20] it's not a silver bullet trick no it's a
[2:02:24] it's a process
[2:02:25] Perfection is a journey
[2:02:28] Perfection is a long road
[2:02:31] and Perfection takes time
[2:02:33] it takes time to get it right
[2:02:35] takes time to stretch it way out
[2:02:39] it takes time to test it
[2:02:41] time to shape it time to mold it time to
[2:02:44] prove all things time to make sure that
[2:02:47] it's right if they get in a house ready

[2:06:16] a time to test the Sheep to mold
[2:06:18] everything a time under the sun
[2:06:21] there's no five easy steps
[2:06:24] people try to bypass the process because
[2:06:26] it's a long and hard
[2:06:29] process
[2:06:30] but that's God's provided way
[2:06:33] that's the way God trains his man
[2:06:36] in Jeremiah 12 5 says if thou has run
[2:06:39] with the footmen
[2:06:41] and they have varied thee then how can
[2:06:44] thou contend with horses
[2:06:46] and if in the land of Peace wherein thou
[2:06:49] trust it they weary thee then how will
[2:06:53] you do at the swelling of the Jordan oh
[2:06:56] Hallelujah you got to be able to run the
[2:06:58] race brother oh you can't paint oh they
[2:07:01] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[2:07:04] their strength they shall walk and not
[2:07:07] paint they shall run and not be weary oh
[2:07:12] some of you get weary sometimes but you
[2:07:14] need to trust in the Lord the prophet
[2:07:18] said you need to lay in the presence of
[2:07:21] the sun until the right and until the
[2:07:24] greenness get baked out of you until all
[2:07:27] your fleshiness until all your
[2:07:29] purposeness gets burned out of you you
[2:07:32] need to lay in a hot July Sun until God
[2:07:35] burn out all of the desire in your
[2:07:37] hearts everything that you can overcome
[2:07:40] lay in the presence of the sun until
[2:07:44] your intellect get dried up until you
[2:07:46] have no more mind until it's yet not I
[2:07:49] but Christ are living in me here some of
[2:07:52] you not baked out yet God's Gonna Bake
[2:07:55] you out some of you not burnt out yet

[2:08:04] are not gonna make it until God save
[2:08:08] your soul
[2:08:12] until you cross that River
[2:08:14] [Applause]
[2:08:19] who am I and God called man the prophet
[2:08:22] said before we can have a Revival God's
[2:08:23] got to call out and train men
[2:08:26] caught train man to carry this message
[2:08:29] they don't care what the opposition is
[2:08:31] they are willing to go to the fiery
[2:08:35] furnace in defeat or to the Lions then
[2:08:38] or wherever it may be they're ready to
[2:08:40] go because they've been in the presence
[2:08:42] of God and they know that he is whether
[2:08:46] it's a victory or to defeat they still
[2:08:49] stand the same oh my God I want that
[2:08:53] kind of resolution in my heart
[2:08:54] that when the evening Shadows Fall now
[2:08:57] when the devil cover the Earth cover the
[2:09:00] principalities of powers and everything
[2:09:02] there's something inside your soul that
[2:09:05] is still standing the devil may get them
[2:09:08] but he cannot get all he hasn't got you
[2:09:12] this morning or rise and shine thy light

[2:09:39] you're gonna make it you're gonna
[2:09:41] overcome he love you he making a way for
[2:09:45] you this morning
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:49] that's the kind of training God does a
[2:09:51] man
[2:09:52] it's very strange saying God to do that
[2:09:54] that God trains this man like that but
[2:09:56] he does and you know we have an old song
[2:09:59] he should be saying he said something to
[2:10:00] the waters some sort of flood
[2:10:02] some true deep trials but off with the
[2:10:05] blood
[2:10:06] God leads his people through great
[2:10:08] trials
[2:10:10] to purge them oh say hey man somebody
[2:10:13] to purge you why so that you could bring
[2:10:16] forth much food
[2:10:18] to put you why said you could bring
[2:10:20] forth more food oh and here it is my
[2:10:23] father glorified
[2:10:24] that you bring forth much fruit it isn't
[2:10:28] that right
[2:10:29] he said sometimes it take years to do it
[2:10:31] that's for myself tonight I believe that
[2:10:33] right now God is training such men
[2:10:35] Prophet said to meet the front line men
[2:10:38] who are going through
[2:10:39] amen and time shook from their feet
[2:10:42] sometimes look like the whole thing is
[2:10:44] falling but yet in the midst of it all
[2:10:46] they know that Living God
[2:10:49] and they keep their face forward moving
[2:10:52] on it's not right
[2:10:53] Perfection is a journey it's not right
[2:10:55] it's a journey
[2:10:56] a journey of redemption Redemption is in
[2:10:59] two parts isn't that right coming out of
[2:11:00] going into and it's good for us to come
[2:11:04] out we praise the Lord
[2:11:06] they shouted when they came out of Egypt
[2:11:08] oh it was a time of rejoicing nothing
[2:11:11] wrong with that but that's not the whole
[2:11:13] story
[2:11:15] after you come out you still have
[2:11:17] something to go into Amen brother Brown
[2:11:20] Hallelujah God wants us to go into
[2:11:23] something
[2:11:25] God took Israel out of Egypt through the
[2:11:28] long way
[2:11:29] through the heart away why so that he
[2:11:31] could get Egypt out of Israel
[2:11:34] isn't that right
[2:11:36] he said the prophet said you joined the
[2:11:37] Nazarene Church will never make you
[2:11:40] perfect
[2:11:41] you join in the Baptist Church will
[2:11:43] never or whatever Pentecostal Church

[2:11:47] perfect you being a good loyal man will
[2:11:51] never make you perfect you can't Merit
[2:11:54] one thing there's nothing about you to
[2:11:57] Merit Prophet said you are lost you say
[2:12:00] well I keep the law I keep the Sabbath I
[2:12:04] keep this and and I keep that on all
[2:12:06] these things Paul said lay aside all
[2:12:08] those things now he said that's right
[2:12:10] but we do this we baptize the people we
[2:12:12] lay hands on them he said we can take it
[2:12:14] verse by verse he said but there's one
[2:12:16] hope one Lord One Faith one baptism we
[2:12:19] believe that baptism we believe in our
[2:12:20] accidental dead and so forth these signs
[2:12:23] shall fall on the sick follow follow
[2:12:25] them that lay hands and sick and
[2:12:26] everything he said that's something we
[2:12:27] do he said but let's go on to perfection
[2:12:31] Oh my he said we are coming watch into
[2:12:34] the Tabernacle
[2:12:36] not the foundation not the floor part
[2:12:39] but the Tabernacle itself
[2:12:41] he said we're coming into that
[2:12:44] he said that's the foundation the law
[2:12:46] and righteousness and joining church and
[2:12:48] being baptized and laying on hands and
[2:12:49] that's all orders of the church he said
[2:12:51] but now let's go on into Perfection he
[2:12:55] said there's only one that is perfected
[2:12:57] and that is Jesus amen do you see a
[2:13:01] church amen Glory hallelujah amen so how
