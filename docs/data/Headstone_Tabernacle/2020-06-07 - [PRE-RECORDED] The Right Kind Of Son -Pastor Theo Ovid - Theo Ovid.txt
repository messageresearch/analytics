message this morning I just want to finish off some things that we should last Sunday and really finish the message so I want to kind of finish off some of that then we go into the service for today it's good to be here it's good to feel the church lit under that that fire of Prayer hallelujah praise God I know you get in somewhere when you're praying and there's a burden to pray and you want to press your way I know you're getting somewhere isn't that right and listen to what the Prophet said influence you put one or two good members in a church that is really on fire for God it will do something for that church more than 40 revivals could have we just need two good members that's on fire four board people on fire for what kind of thing but for God go when your father forgot it never had he had a pass you by he's not interested in coming near you because he you are on fire for God or give the Lord some braces hallelujah a good cleanse member with the face shining with the glory of God with sweetness and humility the skanda in the power god watch when somebody gets sick they will call that person to come and pray you might make fun of them and unsay the tire deflated you might al all these things but let that strike you one time when them struggles begin to come then you see who is your real sincere person in the church oh praise the name here my lord send me let my influence be upon others let me live for Christ to live is Christ and to die is gain so this prophet Isaiah that come into the presence of God it had an effect upon him and it's one kind of effect when you get into that kind of presence you recognize you are nothing you recognize you are unworthy you can't go in that presence uncovered any other story when your coin that presence is one in fact hallelujah and I will not hit Isaiah he said woe is me I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among people of unclean lips Oh glory to God hallelujah then he got that calls come upon his lips then he could say hear my sand me Oh glory to God his treesey's confession then cleansing then commission oh praise the name of the Lord they believe that he confess isn't that right he said his cleansing never come by a creed I love this it come by fire all the teaching all the mysteries all the quotes all the word word word cleansing it coming by that it come in my fire fire coming on into your heart fire coming onto your life fire coming onto your spirit that's nothing with how you used to be and how you are and how you grow up I will burn all of that Prince College have nothing to what country I come from what language you speak if you're tall if you're short it has nothing to do with a fire will burn all of that holy fire from God that's what the church needs that's what the people needs that what the preacher means that's what the ministers need fire Holy Ghost fire real fire isn't that right hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord I think now here is the truth of God I don't care what dream you had what kind of prophecy you give if it isn't God's Word it is wrong if it don't compare with the world that's the trouble today one has a dream one has a vision one has a tongue one of the revelation it got the whole thing's all messed up on everything else you got the nominations and broke everything up you ought to bring it to our final foundation that's God's Word churches will build upon one say Jesus is coming on a white horse daddy White Horse church and I've seen him in a vision they will make a choice of that kind then he's coming on a cloud they will make it that kind break them up separate it and call one another buzzer ruse loss hung out and everything like that white brother it goes to show in the first place your heart is not right with God when you do that we are brothers we must stick by one another we need one another oh praise the name of the Lord please God we skip down here quickly he's on the cat is true here now then but I was speaking he's talking about the blind man and these guys had a terrorizing I'm saying God Helia God Helia and I'm say Cordelia and Jesus healing man and the man is a sinner and the Chinese label Jesus a sinner the man said what it is my listener i I don't know but one thing I do know I once was blind but now I see when I the sinner or not I don't know but I have a result of a testimony of proof of the effect of what this man is ministering and preaching he did something to me I was blind but now I see so if they want to talk your sinner talk and you're off talk but you could keep on talking but one thing I know this is my personal testimony I once was blind but now I see this man got in the action would you believe him also will you come and worship also would you accept the testimony also Oh hallelujah praise God because in the action praise God it's tree wings those pterosaur flying with oh praise God one the flying with one - Pierre Pierre wins covering the face and covering the feet and when I'm talk about humility is not reverence and in action he said what we seen what we have seen his promises in his last days what we have seen ourselves or to put each one of us in action not comatose mayor freeze not in a coma it's supposed to put in action not rusting out action hallelujah pray when I get in the Lord's I'm Nutella take some walks amen yeah using a body enough that again in action and the church get tired say no praise God praise somebody calls the exercise in church people only catching up and sing back down getting up and sitting back down getting our custom just sitting down and listen to the preacher buddy the church that have you getting exercise inside of here time to get into action sit down long enough they sit down too long dead in the sea what we've seen promises in the last days what we have seen ourselves or to put each one into action you know why we don't cover our faces on our feet right our wings won't work we got these wings spread out and these being spread out try this fellow we are just fine in here cover yourself humble yourself and then get in action don't get an accent not humble yourself you have no action to get in your pride and your arrogance and nobody can speak to you and you can be corrected and you have to defend and block anything coming if you like as missiles coming Prince God don't want to wreck your world God want to change your life if you're good as you are stay as you are but if you want to be transformed say Lord cut me hit me beat me strip me shake me know me correct me what la attacks but I don't

of your aim and yourself on your world you know what we see happens upon every soul in action it should make a church that will make a revival here in Phoenix that people would fly from Europe to see what was taking place they will say this is a testimony this is a testimony that we see not in a plenty nice pastors and preachers and apostles and prophets no no they will say there's a place in Arizona called the Maricopa Valley our city called Phoenix there is something broke out there until the seven thunders of Revelation 10 that's not even wrote in the Bible is being manifested so he's not talking about talk he's talking about the manifestation what happened a church catch something I met something with what they get you take what you get and do something with it [Applause] gloria like sangha you talk about anything intermittent all every time he planned his cropping and about the harvest the Philistines come every year every year like you're living in vain Philistines will be coming and taking your harvest and one day I'm gonna say enough is enough you get her all out cold that's the thing the guy the oxygen it's a light thing I said listen this all I have ain't no soldier

altogether the Philistines have to go to backing up I'm packing up okay few more minutes what until the seventh under the Russian ten is that even though she has been manifested oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the Lord my when I did the light struck Rebecca she knew something but in her hallelujah and that brought her to Isaac she failed her face she didn't want no more to do with her own thinking Isaac was I thinking then on Oh hallelujah never saw Isaac before alia is the only institution her as my sister by would only hallelujah hallelujah is like looking for a wife I have a muscle in my sock would you go she said I will go when I family says I go in hallelu it her man she never saw she only got the word of his servant she only got the world of a prophet hallelujah never saw Jesus before but she got a winner from an endtime messenger prays God about this lovely Jesus I could give your fate and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and public iris and virtue and power hallelujah praise God and you could rub the enemy [Applause] she had no more to do with her own thinkin she wasn't thinking about herself her weaknesses the complexes when she come from she don't know if you go cook she do if I go like how she cook any food and she's always think already and I don't know again I Cassie buddy clothes that was not her thinkin I think enchants her from her thoughts though what this Isaac is all about only thing about I can't wait to see him I tell me to meet him I want and come to him that's nothing to do it up it has nothing to do with you Isaac was a thing in a non prophecy and the church here we go well it shakes the power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen out of denominational churches so he's not on tentacles Baptists and charismatic Pentecostal Catholics he's not talking about that outside of that that means how to be among us the bride the people in this message when the church tried the power of God not taught in books and tapes not that we had a for 4050 years when it strikes the power that we spoke about what mold is this the world prism of power and when it strike that [Music] [Applause] Oh of the Catholic Church wherever it is here we go when the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's made real to people oh yeah oh yeah feeling good hallelujah hallelujah maybe seated by the way I get some homework last week how many rebirth means paulista by friendship I raise of hands raised and stick them up i okay week and next week again another week again for the rest of you to read it and listen dead Oh hallelujah but when the baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to people damn that's predestinated like you people here I'm still reading to eternalize sees it and what in it it's a super sang doctor see it and walk in it oh my when God give it to you nobody could take it out nobody can rob you isn't that right hallelujah and then he says when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world believing in the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost it's just as real to us as on Pentecost how they groan and cry in their labor pains but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost are set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists and then he put in their gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues wisdom knowledge gifts of healing all kind of miracles what around say every gift only back in the church before Jesus Christ come again the different discernment the depth of wisdom the different knowledge that you follow miracles because of faith every just different poems interpretation of to every gift [Applause] he said the holy was falling within 5 minutes every gift coming back in the church we're gonna need every guest to fight this devil every difficulty we needed hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God Jesus says say to this mountain you see what taking place that's the ministry we are enter into well we have the road now soon the coming of the Lord Jesus we have got to have rapture and faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in swig of an eye to go out or we will not go why don't the ministers tell the people that that if they do a raptor fit they will not go you're on your way to the tribulation with your book sandwiches hips and have to have wrapped in fit to kind of be sitting there hoping wondering gambling is it will make it it's not that it's to actually make a revival I chose such as effectively empowered by God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you talk about food to be changed in a moment to arise and you do not fear for your own self right now forgot to change your walk and talk and action and attitude so before you got too wrapped in fit either gonna fit to believe you gonna be transformed and all the excuse won't be burnt up because all of us are humans God knows that Moosa was a human too and Moses was given a commission he kill a man around the Egypt is not right and after 40 years when God did confront him and corner him he was still making excuses after 40 years Ethan get rid of his excuses he's a lotta cat talk as I make more continue you

there it will be their prophecy are you ready is everybody ready for the prophecy when the power of this church Rises it will bring its brethren not if not I'm wondering he said when when that's mean ready or not it's common [Applause] let me season when the power of this church rises it will bring expression the power of that just Rises its whipping his brethren the power of that church Rises it will bring me other version then there'll be a general resurrection so it's not resurrection by convention is resurrection by the power of God risin in the churches Oh hallelujah hallelujah but her mom said want to choke it at that but did you know that men that are sons of God are mature God's then he skips out he lost his God ship he lost his sonship he lost his booming seat and took it over watch but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the permit gets up to the top when the full sons of God wouldn't manifest it when when the pyramid gets to its top is that is where the full sons of God will manifested when the power of global walk out and will take every power that sit and got from him that it belongs to him oh my god so he talked much sons of God coming into patooty coming into position coming at a place of power that take back from the devil all what he had to do isn't that right praise the name of the Lord please God praise God praise God hallelujah glory to God but urbana I'll skip something here now but Samson it would be awful helpless big frame all I want something can happen you say once more Lord every fiber in his being began to be filled with the power of God if the church could only get to that again all the way from the preacher to the deacon to the lady every fiber every member of the body would be filled with the power of God those big brawny muscle streets not money crush it together let me die with them Lord let me die with them you raise me up to destroy it no I lift myself up all wrong it let me destroy myself with it my reputation whatever it is let me destroy it I to see the power of God again and always when the power of what comes in the walls that you have built around you fall denominational walls will crush and God will be known again China deluded with Wars a section eyes at high high high but when the power goes over was falling down people scream and run out you know why they were born to connect with God's presence and power so revival how can we have a record revival give up when the regular right revival giver is bombed by the world God won't come in where the will is you can depend upon that while Samson was born a new shock of hair grew doubt God this is it send us another Church prophecy prophecy just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstration of the Spirit mark six ink and follow the church acts 2:4 aksha touch excited it all of it will follow the church great signs and wonders accompany the Apostles and the last coat but a man said in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride oh please she is peeled she believes the Word of God obediently written in love not within in frustration not written set up with Ibaka take it no more she is waiting in love with him in love and love this produces seed hallelujah risen in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed CFL epic Gordon you're frustrated on your car here and saying yet and you're carrying over sort of nonsense you're not in that you're waiting in love she's watching for it she is part of the world and she is watching for her life to manifest that word bredrin can't you see it I hope that didn't go over you the body is weight and for which is the word it's written for the light which is a spirit the conformant or make it alive that is what she's written for no other life will work in her Nora life nor that teaching or doctrine it has to be his spirit because she is mrs. Jesus Christ oh praise the Lord let's all stand and worship Him I want him to be a signal of course again I'm no longer a seamstress tonight we'll just wash it before we change a service [Music] no longer slaves of God of God you unravel me [Music] you surround delivering from my enemies [Music] tell all my facebook Oh No cool my child of God to feel who [Music] amen we want to turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter tree Galicians up the tree and we go over to colleges up to four and also Romans chapter eight we wanna read mature trees with 16 and 17 Galatians tree from verse 26 to 29 and we read Galatians 4:1 2:7 and Romans 8:14 to nineteen we go to matthew chapter three 16 and 17 and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice of heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased we go across to Galatians chapter 3 verse 26 for you're all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise chapter 4 now I say that the heir as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when will the children will bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he has sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying crying our Father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and then and if a son then an heir of God through Christ we go to Romans 8 for in the nineteenth Force many as I led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God let's have a word of Prayer father we thank you for your word we thank you for the gifts and a revelation to call you our Father and when your disciples asks you to teach them how to pray the first thing you said is our Father God may you reveal yourself today to your sons and daughters may they get a revelation of their own sonship who they are where they come from where they're going granted Lord in Jesus in my ask it email just greet want somebody before it occurs either shake somebody hands [Music] Brizzy Lord when you take a seat give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] the father seeketh such to worship Him to worship Him in spirit and in truth so this morning of a title and this has been a sort of bulletin no inspiration upon my heart on my mind upon my spirit for some time now and the title is the right kind of Sun that's the title the right kind of Sun have a subject the adoption of sons I'll have an inspiration the father's business customized mission the father's business it's your choice if you want to work in it but it's the father's business and that is Luke 2:49 and he said unto them how is it that you sought me was it not that I must be about my father's business age 12 and he's talking about the father's business this is a prayer from adoption but a brand bless us now as we approach the word and father don't know it's the reason that I'm approaching the word from this very scripture here it's because that I feel you want me to do it this way it's your Divine Will it is your order is the order of the day to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of battle as our brother said in his prayer to you not long ago you have trained us so long Lord father give us our ranks put us out here so that week's supposed to do what we supposed to do so we can be about our father's business for we ask it in Jesus name thy son amen no Galatians 4 it says that the air as long as a child different nothing from a servant he's a son because he's born in the house he didn't join a house he was born in the house and there's an appointed time for the father to positionally please that son or that child but the child has to be trained trained tutored given special tests to see if he could handle the father's business because if he doesn't prove himself he will make a mess on the job the father don't want mess on the job the father want a son trained because before he put him in the position of authority and power are you with me hallelujah today forgive me I'm just blessed in my in my groove right now today I am NOT talking about a man's office position elder Deacon trustee pastor Bishop Pope I am talking about the man not the position so that covers all of us at the same level I'm not all my principal teacher taxi driver whatever work not not what you do not a job not a career I'm talking about who you are it is not the office that will be adopted [Music] it is the man that's going to be adopted it's not the office that God said I am pleased it is the man that corset this is my son in whom I am well pleased it is the posture or teacher or parcel being adopted it is the son the right kind of a son or could we get a lot some praises [Applause] God has all kind of sons disobedient sons rebellious sons backslidin sons he's not looking for pastor bishop elders he's looking for sons that he could professionally please as pastors bishops elders whatever whatever position he's like of a son but he could place in a position of influence with power so this thing about son has to do with relationship with father so newer comes in relationship the way in which two or more people what things are connected a state of being connected state of being connected by blood or marriage and we have to be connected by both by Jesus blood and by Meritor of him blood our marriage so it was a trial for me to see how much Jesus was connected to the Father in every turn and I go back to the Bible you began as if Jesus was really into this relationship with his father the son can do nothing except the father show him [Music] the father has given me all things in them by power it's not me to do it the works is the father in me that do it the words when you see me you see the father the father is greater than I oh hallelujah praise God the son can do nothing except to see the fur so Jesus was in debt this real no not notice there was no church inside Elena there's no office in Saturday I had a pastor marry another partially secretary and yet no this is just father and son whatever I was prayin is our Heavenly Father i tongue me tonight because we are living in the hour of preparation you are preparing the people to believe all things missing limbs will be restored I have never seen that before but it's gonna be [Applause] let me just shake your faith a little think about it now missing limbs will be restored by this power we are talking about by this manifestation of the sons of God this will be talking about when men speak and the work is created just like that jesus said bread and multiply it he takes fish and multiply it but sons of God don't have to have anything this is going back to let there be you're not hearing me this is going back to Genesis this is bring back with the book but I am lost this is bringing the manifestation people would fly from everywhere to see that oh you don't hear me you're not hearing me you're not hearing me [Applause] you make you not hearing what I'm saying then you have to get the police force to help block people from coming to see that they will come to see that all of a sudden what Adam had has been restored and the power is no:1 the it the treasure is our written vessels and Sons the right way my son Oh hallelujah hallelujah oh let's continue praise God praise God are you having a time that is morning this was a message building upon me and the other never forgive me it's writing me right now I hope it riding me like it right in you of a son all right what am i on you were preparing the people to believe all things we believe that's the message of the day the preparation time Jesus Christ the same yesterday the never ever and your corner people and have given them the Holy Ghost and now you are trying to call out that group of sons to adopt them we realize this he said for him that the old law was a son was born into the home he was a son but the tutor raised him and when he comes of age if he's been the right kind of a son he was taken out with a purple robe on in a ceremony and adopted and that is what you are trying to do to these Full Gospel people now to get them out to themselves somewhere alone with you in it to adopt them into the kingdom and give them the right to go forward and do the things you did [Applause] so I wanted to shake off your cute self and put on your son self you're hearing me your hand oh I'm gonna listen I'm gonna shout for you I'm gonna say hallelujah I'm going to enjoy this service I'm gonna preach myself happy I'm gonna be in the world [Applause] she'd love

know what I'm saying [Applause] hallelujah so check off that chat since put on your son's health I'm no longer same affair corners that give us the spirit of punish affair he has given us we know sonship whereby we cry Abba Father Oh glory couldn't we give the Lord a show in the house [Music] not apprecia not ever pasta he didn't say that he say Abba Father [Applause] that's mean you might be Caesar that's that's this Troodon these church walls and bring you into your place the church the revelation of the church is to bring you into the position of a relation of the sonship those movies doesn't want to kill me for PC I'm messing with the church world i messing with a church kingdom but that's church kingdom that's not the kingdom of god because jesus said behold the kingdom is within you somebody he never put the King under some bill them Oh get the Lord a show in the house - is so can the house he never put it in a place he said behold kingdom is within you [Applause] you may be seasoned so we know before we have we can be adopted we have to be we have to enter into our place of Tran where we be tested and proven for sanctification and behavior and obedience to the father's word father's word Jesus Hebrews 5:8 though he was a son though he was a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered that soaked and you complainers who sit here and you know who you are I want you to think about that door he was a son he learned obedience by the pressure and the tests and whatever he had the courtroom he lent it or beers not automatic it's manual drive cattle in it gotta push it is not Christian come on get the Lord I soaked in the herbs notice there's no church here now there's no distance between the pulpit and you we are all sons I'm in a son in a position to speak these things but you are son in a position to hear these things God is that adopting the pulpit what is an adopted the position he's adopted sons and daughters [Applause] do I ask cream in the house to a a Shelton the whole week on our revival a revival of our rebalance of holiness a revival of power I may be seated when a father finds a child obedient how he likes the comment says sir there's a whole spate report in the tutor your boy is a perfect child how obedient your child how they love to worship you could you say that about you [Applause] Cornell also how they love to worship you [Applause] and some of you still do how do I just smile at you what you smelling good go to one that's mine from you he is smiling but it's worship that's what makes him God when you all put your molten ball hallelujah when you open your time sir praise the Lord when you raise your hands [Applause] the word God itself mean object of worship Satan and worshipping you know you dream that can feel like he's God you must be your own God you don't need him okay let's continue or they love to worship you they got it together there is their hands tears run on their cheeks they are full of joy how the Holy Spirit must love to do that for God I'm reading them I notice on the Prophet for God is an object of worship and God warns to be worship in spirit and truth jesus said so but we get so statue we just can't make a grunt hee hee whether he was that keep that for yourself keep upping him for yourself all the for Brees 24 hours they say Amen this one cast on the chrome this one side of worship on Towson Santa risen hallelujah glory lesson honor power might belong with alum forever ever [Applause] you NBC said nobody knew that trouble I've seen so I wish it right now nobody know about Jesus yeah your self continue with your own trouble you better start a worship because you have your troubles you can have your old troubles don't have to help you and he said to pusher oh give the law some praises let me see that worship expresses a level of faith because it's not about you it's not even about your feelings because you are actually making a sacrifice yeah belly pain yeah I've had pea stress pain of children pain your family pain your kind of pain but just decide to say hallelujah thank you Jesus God knows there's a sacrifice you have defined gravity because pressure supposed to have your shoulder you know so oh god nobody knows the trouble I've seen nobody knows at the truth but when you shake yourself up shake back his shoulders he's paralyzed a man you take your pressure as a man so I reckon that the pressure and the child of this present world is not worthy to be compared with the glory that God is about to unveil on fall reveal manifest [Applause] let me see that we can say a manager how the horsemen must dread to say that to the father hold on II grunting go Hawks are reporting who is fritzy next humming let me talk about gee no matter what he let me talk about the right kind of a son because that one only grunting now only begin there and watch in zoo but that same person I can't even put them an effect they're watching Sahara know that happen the dancing the tap in the foot hunting like that but just if I get the guy inoculation or something so I'm not sure again operation hand stiff the hand stiff right they get some kind of injection or some diesel yes the devil in Jack you check your unbelief because we recognize that the devil deceive all or I worship the Beast all I worship Lucifer except those whose names on the book and a few see on him on the book you'll have to believe you have to behave like John when John saw is there John was filled with the Holy Ghost John could have behaved himself as I am John Phil but holy was let me take a seat and watch you misbehave in a cyber just like a mess man he was the first one he said all in heaven all under the earth the right John he wanted to give his own testimony about the power of worship the power of praise when you see your name let us nothing be with your sins that has nothing to with your sins that has nothing to do with your sins it has to do with you seeing ya [Applause] what you may be seated but when we are obedient and love him and praise Him and give him glory how the Holy Spirit must love to bring this him how is it father you know what your son is just thank you he said in a chip off the old block he loves you he's obedient now if that boy is no good yet he's a son he's never nothing but a son because he's born a son but if he's not obedient and the right kind of a son he just continues a son without any reward [Music] so today choose your choice [Applause] once a Sun over the Sun but if you want to be a place son you have to be the right kind of us [Applause] so we are not questioning your sonship we left confession in your salvation you're not personally diag1 me the Lord and so on we're not questioning that you may be seated because this endtime rapture promise is a pheromone who died went on to be Lord we who are alive and remain we are the ones that have forgotten that channel to bring the rest up [Applause] so every believer every brother dadang going on is more burden on the bride is more pressure for perfection because it has to come to perfection to bring a resurrection nobody'd ever know one has to be perfect she wanted to be good a court here but perfections was promised not good good is the enemy of proofing Oh glory to God and I was perfection is his life in you it's not what you can do what you can do is very good but when his men come inside of you it's perfect so that obedience son he had a place in of that son when he gets in an age as an inch he's taken on into a public place and they're a great ceremony is made out before the public no it's not his son parading himself is that he son of a flag say I am a son and you know who I am no no it's not that it's the father bringing the son in public is his father is identifying his son he I want to hide him on the note bushel he bring on said this is my son I am pleased I am behind him I am backing him up don't fool with him I am with him this is my son I want to let you know I my tent design myself with him that has nothing to with a minister association that has nothing do with the church the elder didn't deliver that that's what father and son I know he said watch he said no one and then the father that's his own son into the family then after that the son name is good on the cheque as his dad's it's a public ceremony it have no private adoption where I can tell you I can tell you I can tell you you don't know it's a public ceremony hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I can speak I speak no speaker those be good because not it's not you doing anything but he will let it be made known among men if you want to keep her dumb he will take a look look at me looking in my son yeah Bronson opossum Fernanda prefer sent people Frieda pretty for some cases straight to you send them because you are his son even this is the happy right and he was testifying about his curls he spoke let there be squirrel and she started speak and she said that's nothing but the truth brother branham and she said the right thing and the holy spirit dropped down upon him who is him the right kind of a son and say whatever she wants give it to her not-not-not ask me for it for her you know you give it to her do you see that do you understand what we're talking about now all that the father had wallaby pawning the price all I wasn't going upon in the Christ Christ porters into the church now watch the Sun signature is just as good his father so what go to cinema room you sang the cheque son sign the check whatever she won't sign it whatever monks you want sign it [Applause] you a shout in the house release it to her you cut the power and authority to do that [Applause] now watch you say if you want your sisters sick could be healed sits in a wheelchair she was poor very poor if you want how much money you get that and she thinking and she gets an office tick-tick-tick she could take anyone but in her soul she had two sons that is more than money that is more than a sister being well she said one day salvation of my two boys listen this verse I give it unto you could you give a shout in the house that's a son speaking but the word of power and authority authorized by the father [Applause] nothing church in a home upon home listen she was so poor she's the pay her tights in coins sit down a minute she was so poor some people didn't want to pay tax but I sure hope work a mockery water one time but I wanted to give her back the money and go tell him don't do that she was blessed peanut ice and coins and God come right around to that poor woman and Rani first power you think God don't see what you're doing you're fooling me no oh you can fool me but you can't fool God so the end of it is not about your position you have the work you have your career position it's about who you are that's what I matter the church today the reason we don't have many mighty great manifestations the great Church of the Living God and these last days should be fired on the road with every divine gift set in order a great beautiful church but we are broke up in denomination isms little forces and everything else till the court can no more with us until we come together and get our hearts right with God that's why our blessings are both run out that's why in the churches is getting cold cooling off is because we have become indifferent towards God his Spirit and his word I'm just true we never welcome the Holy Spirit no more so when you come to church it's a great responsibility you see I want to get off at church I'm getting to your position of sons when you come to church as a son forget Church when you come to church as a son you come to worship you come to welcome the Holy Spirit you you you you I'm talking to that's under what nobody else you know within the group first time idol worship the whip you up everybody praying but you're not praying you mind man you open the prayer on you man you're the pretty one self let us take your wouldn't for God isn't that right that's when God's gonna see and welcome to mom bless second Timothy three all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works and the amplifier is every Scripture is god-breathed given by inspiration profitable for instruction reproof and conviction of sin correction of error and discipline in obedience and for training in righteousness which is in holy living in conformity to God's Word and with will and in thought purpose and action so the Scriptures itself that we bring is to print correction it's a big reproof is to rebuke you is to instruct you in to bring guidance to you and if you don't want it that's that's your kindness son but if you want to be the right kind of a son you'll respond to this because all Scripture is god-breathed all Scripture is inspired and there's a purpose behind the Scriptures the scriptures by the Holy Spirit bring the tutorship upon your life Sheila fights in a pulpit you're not fighting a man of God you're fighting your own blessing your own inheritance by wrestling with what God is beating through the word Oh hallelujah so Abraham he had was to come into full obedience God said separate yourself of my brethren and that's what you have to do a lot of times separate yourself from a lot of unbelief and remember here we go are you ready until Abraham fully obeyed God the blessing never come until he fully obey God think about your blessing being locked up and stored up nobody got take it is yours it mocking Niemann it it's it's there but because of your actions because you're not separated you can only get your instrument gotta open it folding he could cope Moloch creaks and something fallen here is yours nobody can take it is yours it's resolved but for that full window to open up you have to calm enter for obedience [Music] how do i running out know you somebody recognizes done no don't watch pc amen if i preach in he would see under watching me nobody's in a design you know what until abraham fully obeyed God the blessings never come until he fully obeyed God he took his daddy along and he caused trouble then a lot finally caused trouble who its Mun Gordon tell him bring the people in he system for yourself he's a dirty cop blood come but I'm the bring along to the long drag along always be on a toot along and his job let me same people he thought trouble he still having a separate from them 20% say even on that you don't wanna separate yet your choice that's your choice I want my blessing brother if are several myself of you I go on I want my blessing do you want your pleasure you have to have a burden for your father's business hallelujah fathers business and as soon as he got separated from everything when he fully obeyed then God brought the blessing then is when we see when full obedience come when he was about to take the life of his own son the image of the Lord call from the skies and held his hand there's I ran behind him he took them round and said where that ram come from Oh praising him of always skip that but if I'm said the only way you're gonna pay the price the top body token is accepted for obedience to the whole Word of God entitle you to the token full of pity is not part of it as far as information goes but all of it fold into the world which is Christ brings you to Christ oh follow billions complete obedience isn't that right so when God expect you to do a certain thing he demands a complete separation from any doubt you have got to come to follow billions to obey what he says God demands it you can't do it not away no we set an example and this was the example complete separation from all of his own family skin tread and walk a new life so if you're the right kind of son you will stay with the word Gorgona chastise you are going to bring down the whip you're gonna bring down the blues but you wanna stay with the word whatever arm says God was doing here we call a prison of a son and before he fell heir to the kingdom of his father possession the first that son had to be raised and tried he had to find out whether the son was a true son or just a roustabout this son will never be heir if he wasn't qualified to take the father's place so the God's objective is for the son to take his place so the test and the trial is to qualify you for position listen if you've been tested you have been considered worthy for the interview for this job if you are not being tested I think it should be worried I think you should be concerned because the tests and the try is because you have the potential you don't waste time and people who don't want the linen you leave them alone they under own but because the child is willing to give it a crack to give it a chance but as Isaac's Pitt spoke something he said as a head of the home or the house or you get a position or promotion he had a new doodlings step up or step out the position is always higher than you if you get a promotion it is always higher than you it is always more responsibilities it will be always more pressure and stress whether love you more peer to say one more pair but not more pressure well you don't master no pressure at all just go for no pee before Lupe and I get a load job and you have no pressure you have nobody under your you have no responsibilities you don't open the office close the office is nothing but this father's business it's a huge responsibility it's a tremendous responsibility and he can't give his business over the rascals most of all and people that just don't care so he has to have some kind of way to measure and to qualify and to ship my interview and buy tests the kind of want for the business the kind of wrong person to ruin your business your business will boss God business is not going to bus come on same as somebody Jesus as my father sent me so send I you hallelujah hallelujah I'm not sending you just to do your own thing it's a certain way I'm sending you as my father sent me to see me my father sent me I am sending you I thought that you wanna know I'm and the father you and me I am you or give the Lord some praises churches out of it Oh give the Lord some show-cell I could see you asking God and God answering your prayer for glory of God hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God okay so you want to know if he's qualified it took them to take the father's place okay and then all the father had was given to the son and there is where I think that many of us Pentecostal people has made a mistake we think as surely as we become sons and daughters of God that settle it we just come into a place of trying and I don't think people appreciate that too much because I hear complaints I hear moomer ins yet people attitude and whatnot they don't see God they see this one affect me that one effect met this one knew me they did not see it God permit this one God allowed that one God permit this to happen and that to happen he's not destined am SoDo pointer finger them she and I and she cost me the ax show and I didn't want to do it you know but because II I was a little detail about when you said that that's about hittin no no you wanted to hit him you choose to hit him it have no excuses you have to make a choice because Dom has chosen you have to choose the right action because you no longer pleasing man come on now the peas are not the pasta forget about that your present God then every believer sat a match in step with the word March and step with the spirit margin and separate God when you open it just as an army walk inside when you praying you're not praying Lila and somebody prayer somebody praying desperate in you only true Lord Amen God that's right Lord thank you Jesus yes ha are you supporting up with some prayer when you when you use a dipper I mean free to open more betrayed or not the whole debris so how you in contact with your father without any communication well let's talk to a father where were two months ago wheels well after your Bible well since last year no no no no that's not fellowship that's not relationship if it was all Jesus was it I always do that with pieces of father father times our day and reveal yourself to them always talking about the we gonna get into it the Methodist said as soon as a shouted desolate somehow new name some say no deity who leave us someone paid three or four some is it some is the only bride and all kind of fun doctors my white horse cloud all you go wrong or indifferent doctrines that the pin on dogmatic that is it now I don't mind I say what I say you know but I covered a comma and let more unfold 100 Trump he blowing a trumpet one on this one on mysteries some people saying we do pushing of mysteries we shorten the mysteries same regulating Holy Ghost dynamics I don't know what the preacher give because Noah preached 120 years he same thing when you come for service Sunday morning to Noah Lois I take my Bibles it will ring subject it will rain inspiration it will read [Applause] because says will not tired yet up it's still gonna read when you're tired on a cell phone under it but if both are leaving here so how do you broadly then must reign for that to leave how we live in here howdy Seiko be healed how did I ever see how the Crippler gonna walk how did that will be raised up it hasta in [Applause] [Music] some of them ago talk to their friends they could talk to their co-workers they could not lead ever themselves we wouldn't talk to you no fellowship I'm going to heaven whichever portably Tyrion which one but when we are what a day of rejoicing that will be the Bible said every cell we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness then when we do that we cannot fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us o us who born in similar predicament us who common the world speaking lies the blood of Jesus cleanses us and we can have fellowship one with another or could we get a shout in the house if we say we have fellowship and we have blood and we cannot fellowship with our brother we lie and speak not the truth maybe Caesar so no matter what kind of position God put you in you are still growing towards perfection I will never reach that there Jesus comes now notice if God acted any one thing on a certain circumstance and that single circumstance arise again he's got to act the second time like he did the first time oh he's unjust so no matter how bad you are in sin how stupid we become he is got up to you like he did that fallen woman or he acted wrong then now hear about God's behavior is this person what he is in his behavior it is its person and that's the way you are in your behavior tell you what you are it doesn't tell you about your office somebody could be a prime minister be adulterer somebody could be a CEO and be a hater somebody could be a manager be a murderer it's not the office is the man so God is not interested in in this position in that position you want to know you who you are tell me about yourself some how many ago to interview they asked the question tell me what yourself you mean you mean you do know about you and when you can't talk about yourself is dice with DC next contestant consider you you can fake it you're well I'm fine and you're fumbling tell me about you tell me some places where I want to tell you why I am fit for this job why I will do the company great I am qualified in this I have this of this experience that was not good you sound like you're put put on a list I can tell me about you [Music] I know that bad alone I just pray sometimes I just press sometimes not you know nothing anybody else you know you know anybody else I know tell me I want to know about you but this is what the horse we want to know about you lord I love you I I want more of you I want to worship I won't have the right atmosphere wrongly I want you to be in my life I want the spirit infiltrate my ice world [Applause] do your the story your life speak so loud I can't hear your words so whatever you are the life that you live shows what kind of spirit is in you know it says no you are not converted until you see the Holy Ghost I'll skip down now the Holy Spirit love this one will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another that night Jesus was betrayed and they come to catch Jesus people come to cut Jesus Jesus was so humble Jesus was so nondescript that they would but almost as if no sort of special attention to him Judas a the one walk kiss ties him nothing if Judas said kiss him you make note of each one of Jesus all them have they gone and a bear and everything else he said the one a kiss I see him he's that kind of person man come Peter draw sword and cut ovals Peter defendant Christ Peter fighting for the Lord he thrown out short Jesus had to pick up the money hands and give an instant surgery put it back on healed be van healing on a sinner he explained I won divine healing on a soldier who just gets cut off by a believer he's a believer there's a believer you know taken of a man air and his Lord had to take up the air from the ground and put it back up and says Peter if I bet he saw didn't no no this not a fight now watch that saw drawing in his human spirit what how brave he was what so gallant here care who see and Rashad but in night when they want crucify Jesus and they said Peter you look like one of them he said no no no notice notice me notice me I that's a man fear no fate no human spirit is literal fear because it's licks its cross this crowd is a terrible atmosphere is the mob mentality around they catching anybody because Eve wait is this silica on holic take him to so he don't want that testimony hold him you know power he has not sanity he has no backups this is the Jesus following all the time he in trouble what if Jesus were only for me so as far as Peter concerned the 1999 and it'll be safe but he didn't 1999 any crying can when Christ rose from the dead no he appeared upon them appear amongst them peace be unto you then he come to explain some things to them share some word with them unfailing the word to them or the fear gone no he said Peter I come to bring Church to you I come to bring a let you know your sons your son's that is supposed to be born at the manifestation and what it release to you the promise of my father you shall see power or what they run from or what you couldn't overcome you're gonna get power after the Holy Ghost is gonna come upon you Dynamis gonna strike the mechanics so no these guys had a higher port a higher inspiration know these guys they still frightened but it's not a frightened that frightened widow promised never promised a power now these are wait on it and they win the Upper Room Wheaton and they were in the temple worshiping God continually you see worship praise express feet because feet is like a check that you haven't taught technical bankers yet to go somebody gets checked Saturday we went on cash that the bank is closed the other way till Monday so you should be shouting on Saturday Saturday night the car sweep Sunday morning you're happy happy happy you watch any longest on the night because in on Monday morning that but on that paper is yours right noise piece of paper you look at my child a technical role it they might spit on it they might put a limo that's a jack so because you have it it materialized to the content of the revelation of what it is but you could rejoice that's what it is that's why when you know your heel you'll begin to praise God and rejoice the noble get a picture you to rejoice in advance attack him in advance is that a worship they were in the upper room worshipping a promise worshiping a revelation didn't know when it was gonna come which Sunday which Thursday which day is what's gonna come what if it come today are you ready why don't I come now your promise come right now to you what if it come now I didn't promise a clock promise head and clock that lie oh my my my my my my mind you let me see that so the Holy Spirit will not miss me here itself in one person I'll behave yourself in another it will make each person coming to its character oh my so then this has nothing to do with doctrine no it has nothing to do with doctrine that is why barber and said I rather somebody write in their spirit and wrong in their doctrine than somebody right in their doctrine and wrong in their spirit that's performed that's very deep you see when somebody wrong in your spirit you cut correct when somebody writes me spirit you can correct me wrong doctrine that's the truth so God is not concerned with your spirit then you're teaching your spirit and your doctrine God is not concerned about that when when the bible says jesus meets pastor samaria because he want to find someone at a well needs pass through Samaria he got to reach her she's messed up she had for how much men she had and one little one zone she's totally messed up society recognizes a messed up woman but she had a right spirit she was honest she was truthful here's the proof to get in the side of her when he kept in this I was a go call your husband he was given our tests she was men talking about why ask me a question she cannot go in defensive mode why I asked my dad for not only a business I know you she gonna get on his head but she didn't do that she spoke the truth I have none he said spoke the truth woman now what she is doing it he going down now he's going beyond her condition he he come to show us something he's going to show her when she come from he come to shore she's the daughter of God come ashore forget about em scribes and Pharisees accusers and all them people who say this and your dad today that's forget all of that I come to release you show you your name on the book I took this at you three who discover myself free free indeed now when Jesus finished me that woman he ran chicken more home chicken not normal it was just too much of her I want to say but now I see you can't keep me ball [Applause] you are walking at things tiny up and got come into service and set you free from it think that banging you yes see if there is an Assessor Ivan what break that that whip oh for you you will rejoice you wouldn't shout you saw - oh no don't you wait for the break over yourself now [Applause] you may be seated whoo now this whole thing about tutorship was that the father is so busy in his business he have no time to teach his son so you have tutors to teach his son he used to get the best and the best is the Holy Spirit that he released to bring training and discipline to his sons and the Holy Spirit was sent to govern and guide the church God give the Holy Spirit to do that the father would seek not seek a man to try to get a fairness gap we call it now the father is a renegade and and and if the son of the renegade and he might not say it suddenly locate or he's he's fine he's fine inside the father the one that he wants the truth about you is he wouldn't do that he got a man and will tell him the truth for he wanted to know exactly the wealth of the boy at all times he sent the Holy Ghost upon the church to be the teacher and the razor of the church that is why a lot of men replace the Holy Ghost so the people don't even look for the Holy Ghost they don't expect the Holy Ghost they expect the man have the man dead Church in trouble because it's not the Holy Ghost you see if you take face a Holy Ghost oh you're trusting man the man is who is everything so therefore you are church member and as pasta but that is not what we bring in this morning what we bring in is more in the shake of this church thing and understand that you are son and your daughter and you become a temple of the Holy Ghost to reveal the mystery that must heat from generation to generation which is Christ in you he wanted Tabernacle himself in you look Oh God look how God uses pizza to bring spirit power to Cornelius house a Gentile all the time living with Jews God bring vision to Peter be that to go God's the cornea sent messenger to get Peter that is when things are active in the church descent for you so Peter get the call go tell Peter forego never born away before and he comes the Cornelius house my feet and he began to speak by his feet and while words come out his mouth Holy Ghost power fall upon Cornelius what kind of man was Cornelius just devout a worshipper arms giver a free man in not selfish he not miserable is there a terrorist just devote that's the kind of man there's an atmosphere a quality man watch God philometor Holy Ghost and he ain't get baptized yet is that the baptism give you is the hot condition [Applause] alright caneva son just devote dedicated aim and sincere not halfway not fleshly too much of fleshly people inside are here you're just natural you're not consumer the spiritual if you miss a service you should go back and listen to this if not you miss there's no excuse for not knowing what going on a church it's on the internet it's on YouTube it's on Facebook no excuse none you could put it on the phone we have an app for Android you could put on it an app also on your phone and listen the message on Android on your phone no excuse to find out and listen because you want to know what's going on because when they come to church you get the opportunity for this spirit to speak expressly this is not playing back a tip of the profit from way back then and you just don't know where at because it says the prophets words this is present truth this is a profit world coming alive this is the prophets prophesy we come to tender more than gross on a profit we come depend the prophecy of the prophet to bring that to life the purpose of me these men bring these seeds to life that is what we are trying to do that is what we are pressured to do he says seven thunders gathered right together we press to bring that see to life seventh honest good-faith he repressible not see the life [Applause] no if the child was misbehaving itself the boy was nothing tristant into the father's farm or kingdom how the horseplay must feel today when it cooled before Corbett the ball she in fees and after take a report of our differences in the churches today how we have laid aside all the baptism of the spirit or decisions that having a form of godliness 9 the power thereof how he blushed and said your daughter's addressing him orally how he must blush you say or cheering can't you marry one another long enough to have a meetin how they make fun of people that's called out and filled with the Holy Spirit all the holy words must feel to go before God which those are messages that coming back and saying they're having a form of godliness they don't believe in the supernatural no more they won't even go to church on Wednesday night they want to steal what their favorite television program questioned the father will say listen it's a big one for me did you try did did did did you knock at the heart door the father asking the holy s--t did you knock at the heart door I'm not night after night and they won't listen God Olivia so you know oh no he knocks he press is the one my dog he knocks on the window he sent somebody send some kind of thing give your word to see if you would change your ways change take heed how you must feel watch he trusted us like he did Adam and Eve to obey his word they fell and as soon as man gets things in his hand he will fall every time he cannot hold it himself it is God who knows but we notice what if the boy was a good boy how the teacher would show what is just woke up did the father say I'm so glad sir to bring you the message of how your son is progressing he's just as smart as he can be he's just like you is a chip off the old block he does exactly like you he loves the thing you love he does the work exactly like you done it when you was out there that's a report that's the kind of church that the Holy Ghost likes to put it before God and if that child did not obey oh my I was an obedient child he was never was no more than a son it remain a son had no inheritance no we don't want to stay in that place you don't want to stay where you have no inheritance you want this inheritance I want to see a Church of God in deep sincerity don't lie to impress me impress God the impression sister your brother no no I want you to understand you have to get a relationship with your father if everybody do know certain things you don't have to do everybody with what you doing you want to do what God want you to do your sufen your father okay I want to see a Church of God in deep sincerity I want to see all fashion prayer meetings where the beginning on that one I want to see the times when they can't leave church you just see all night and pray and fast and call out until God answers instead of that it seemed like lovers Pindell away the love of God when this boy if he come up that way and did not become obedient didn't have that I like this one he did not have the action of his father did not try to courage his father's business on the way his father did then that child missed all his inheritance and another brother had to take his place well that's a big one that's a big one you could miss the inheritance and then somebody pick up just where you left off a lot of statement there's no missed opportunities you know somebody let's take up the ones you miss miss the opportunity you miss it they push you pick it up big one and run with it all right let's go so Jesus was always about the father's business doing that which was right in his sight not just about doing this and that and the church becomes to do that about the father's business I always do that which pleases my father no say and if the Pentecostals also if that child fails Gauri's run on a child son that's what we doing right he not we sometime if the pentecostal fail God raised up the stones on the Abraham what call God can call it from the Lutheran from the Baptist for the probably Presbyterian God is able of these stones or I said the Abraham somebody is going to see the vision and take it on God I hope to live to see that church when she rise in the power and the beauty of the Resurrection with the powers of God working through her signs and wonders following the believers like it did in the New Testament not sign that wonders following the pasta signs an wonders follow say it out again believers these signs shall follow them that believe and the Lord Himself went everywhere with them confirming the word so now watch when the church know then if they just didn't be how does she come and tell the father who is wonderful he is carrying out your work instructions letter by letter that's the kind of church that's the one the father says sure proud of that son you know what happens he's getting trained yet what here we go this tied into last week message yet he might not be able to exercise all authority he hasn't got it yet he is still a son but he hasn't been placed so he's working like all the other sons until God is ready at the appointed time if he's the right kind of son then God could take him aside and place him in a position of full authority Oh glory to God no God longing for that Oh hallelujah here we go are you ready if that son proven to be a right kind of a son love the father's business steered right with his instructions the father dn't on a certain day took the son out before the public stepping up on a high place clued him in a beautiful garment or what they call an adoption and positionally what he was Oh hallelujah you see Jesus had proven to God that he had been the right kind of son and God took him up on the mountain and what witnesses that's the thing that God will be to his sons here and good someday he will call you a side Church if you only obey Him and stay on the word he will please into the church before the coming of Jesus all the powers that Christ had bought in the church all and so on he poured on the church God wanted his work done he sent it to his son the son wanted the work done he sent into the church at that day you shall know I love that I love that He pours it into the church the church as a group doesn't hold it it comes in individuals do you get that but is that channel the church become a channel by window the Spirit of God command flow but it could only hold an individual it can fill the whole place here but only individual going to receive it those Tabernacles gonna receive it fill the whole place here but individual get there look a fire up on their head you have to get your individual liquefier Oh glory to God you don't want to say that's the pillar of fire you want your fire you want your lick yourself do you believe that and the same power that was in Jehovah God rest in Jesus Christ same power that rests in Jesus Christ rest in place sons in the body of Christ we haven't seen that yet that's why I say another

preached the mysteries unfolded the knowledge revealed he didn't say that when God can see these virtues he's not even talking about the revelation of the virtues we correlation are manifestations two different things do I have with this is in a house I feel empowered I feel a special anointing upon me to bring this message we're gonna finish it revelation and manifestation is not the same thing Abraham had a revision of Isaac he take 25 years in manifestation [Music] so claim in our revelation you had any tests Abram test was 25 years then he could produce Isaac and say here is what a higher

barometer go to the woman as a woman I was a condemning you and the horse became I do this another right there in the bath that woman eldona means look at that what if he did another testimony you see the woman is easy but she short dress or short pants right there she was restored she was a bastard and Christian she was restored right there on the floor what a mighty God we serve God is real ready to all those couple of carrying on the church I forgive you he said he recognized he was a sinner too he the things wrong - hallelujah why call just men when you could call mercy oh yeah why he wiped somebody out when they could restore him when it can restore them and bring them back when it could revive them why do that - so much power you have behind a pulpit just overpower having an elder or did know whatever why do that by Jesus to learn with his Gentiles have power over this one and for the one is I come and when he come to wash the feet on what happens don't wash my feet because they know who's to do that job that was the lowest job defeat washes to come into a hole wash your feet first where you come inside it join room Jesus bring a basin of water and say come and watch Fe know what Peter I'll get a Guinness company that was kinda Guyana not my feet when you're part with me you see what watch watch watch watch watch watch everything made me ready water competed to 1 del F del at all but my point is this Jesus shoot him 7 what a serpent is what the ministry supposed to be ok he that great among you let him sue put on a robe put on a plate come on she'll sir know these kings what a madam says it's up to me to walk on my own salvation with God until these things are proved of God then sealed into the king of God bears the Holy Spirit then you looks of God but then these things are operating in you by God then you are sealed you see by revelation you can operate it you can operate certain things somebody come in and it could be just me fussing with your wife and or not doc doc doc doc a widow bless you bless you but yes : anyways it wasn't so much blessing inside but because on who come to the door you give a different face so you work anything real nice but then when it begin to operate and you by God it's not you no more it thunders it lives itself right out because it's that you is him in you or praise the name of the Lord yet his bum until these things from ordination 1962 a scripturally prove and sealing to you as an individual then your son and daughter of God is the thing the fruits of the spirit that proves that you in God or here this one almost done he said now watch Pentecostals was born like a son but that seems someone born the family had to be adopted also that's right and there's no you missed your calling friend when the adoption time comes aha you mean is that time fact option yes when that time comes if the truth it'll raise a child from the chocolate worthy they remain a son but miss the adoption Oh hallelujah so Jesus was God example seed musicians coming please he was that example seed the works will be manifested in him the same way that seed would of God he was example seen aware the Holy Ghost came upon him it was manifested I just wanted to share with you a few thoughts scriptures to show you how much Jesus was connected to the father Booton Communion and fellowship and in release into the father this is from Saint John 5 so I wouldn't call all the scriptures a generally read on jesus answered and them said my father work here the two and I work therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only broken the Sabbath but said that God was his father making them equal with God ha I love that my father work and I work also my claim in God was his father they say you makers have echo with God and then I'm said jesus said unto them verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what do you see the father do for whatsoever things if I do it these also duet the sunlight here we go for the father loveth the son and shoot him all things that himself do it and he will show him greater works than these that you may Marvel for as the father raises up the dead and quickeneth them so the son quickeneth whom he will so he was constantly plugging in to how the father operate I am operating is right for the father judge had no man but I committed all judgment unto the son that all measured under the son even as they honor the father inherit not the son on another father which I sent him for as the father hath life in himself so what he given it to his son to have life in himself then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses give you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven and for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven which giveth life unto the world all the fire that given me shall come to me and him that coming to me I will no wise cast out he sent me he that sent me is with me and the father had not left me alone if I do those things which please him not that day you shall know I'm in the father yield me and I on you he that hath my commandment and keeping them he does not love at me and he that love me shall be loved of my father and I will love him I will manifest myself to him and Judah said unto Him not ask our Lord how is it that dog with manifest I said unto us are nothing to the world jesus answered and said to him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keep it at my scenes and the word which he hear is not mine but the father which sent me these things have I spoken unto you that being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remember and oh my do you love him this morning is even God's take pleasure or delight in his son Matthew tree identify that this is my son I am delighted at him I am pleased with him Matthew 17 this is my son I'm pleased hear him is not right this is not right God was pleased to have the fullness dwell in him Colossians 1:19 it pleased the father that in him should befall fullness 12 isn't that right isaiah 53:10 God was pleased to bruise him yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief a window was made my soul an offering for sin he shall see a seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand and the final one first Corinthians 1:21 God is pleased in the foolishness of preaching to save them that please for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe are you gonna be that right kind of son hallelujah not everything easy not everything smooth he learnt obedience by what he suffered he was bruised God was pleased to bruise him because true has been bruised he brought blood to bring salvation to all of us let's all stand and worship the Lord Oh hallelujah father God I thank you for your presence I thank you for this message this was burning in my heart in my spirit Lord to tell them and share with the people about the right kind of a son I reckon a heart set in looking for so much of emphasize about office and role and position without
