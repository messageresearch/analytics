[0:17] but when God spoke it back here every
[0:20] word of God is steadfast it's immutable
[0:23] it's imparable it cannot fail and when
[0:27] God slay the sun before the foundation
[0:30] of the world he was just as much slaying
[0:32] that as it was a Calvary it's a finished
[0:35] product When God says so and remember
[0:39] when the lamb was slaying your salvation
[0:42] was included in the sacrifice because
[0:44] the Bible said that your name was
[0:46] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[0:48] before the foundation of the world Amen
[0:52] what about that and what we going to do
[0:55] it's God that showeth Mercy it's God
[0:58] that called you it's God that chose you
[1:01] in Christ before the foundation of the
[1:03] world Jesus said you never you never
[1:05] chose me I chose you and I knew you
[1:08] before the foundation of the world
