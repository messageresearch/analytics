[16:50] name of jesus christ amen
[16:51] and amen amen well it's certainly a
[16:54] great privilege
[16:55] to be back in bible study and to be
[16:59] behind
[17:00] this sacred desk albeit virtually
[17:04] recognizing that uh during this whole
[17:07] time that we're living in
[17:08] god has food for us and encouragement
[17:11] for us
[17:11] and um i have not had the opportunity to
[17:14] speak in
[17:15] in some time and it's good to be
[17:18] uh here in fellowship with everyone
[17:20] tonight
[17:21] those that i can see i appreciate that
[17:24] those that i cannot see
[17:25] i appreciate you as well and i pray that
[17:28] god will bless you
[17:29] in your homes in your families in your
[17:32] walk
[17:32] on this battlefield this great battle
[17:35] that beloved was speaking about
[17:37] and permitting last friday night this
[17:39] this good fight
[17:41] this good fight it's a good fight and um
[17:44] and i want to encourage you all to keep
[17:47] fighting
[17:47] the good fight of fate and that we are
[17:50] born to fight
[17:51] i'm not going to be too long with you
[17:53] tonight we are now starting back
[17:55] school and you know there i remember
[17:58] when school used to start back that
[17:59] first day of school
[18:01] you know things used to be kind of a
[18:03] kind of easy class now you know so
[18:04] tonight
[18:05] we have an easy class to start the term
[18:08] off
[18:09] as we coming post convention and i'd
[18:11] like to take this time to really thank
[18:13] god for
[18:14] the wonderful convention and for the
[18:16] efforts and the sacrifice
[18:18] um both near and far for all who
[18:21] certainly were part of this great work
[18:24] of god in such a time as this
[18:25] when there's darkness and a creeping
[18:28] darkness everywhere but in the midst of
[18:30] that we are challenged and encouraged to
[18:31] arise and shine
[18:33] for our lights has come so i want to
[18:35] encourage that as well
[18:37] and certainly it will be remiss of me
[18:39] there are so many
[18:41] greetings and salutations that are
[18:44] deserving
[18:45] um so many birthdays and anniversaries
[18:47] and different celebrations but it would
[18:48] be remiss of me
[18:50] to not acknowledge that yesterday was
[18:53] the birthday of the first lady of
[18:55] headstone tabernacle sister anne-marie
[18:57] ovid
[18:58] who is the wife of our pastor
[19:01] um but if i'm saying when god call a man
[19:04] he call his wife
[19:05] and i could i could i could speak from a
[19:08] position of authority
[19:09] when i say that beloved will not be the
[19:12] man he is today
[19:13] if it wasn't for the sister of it so i
[19:15] certainly want to thank god
[19:17] for her and for her birthday and for
[19:20] another year of her life
[19:21] and i am also a direct beneficiary of
[19:24] her ministry
[19:25] you know so we really love and
[19:26] appreciate it and we wish her so many
[19:28] more years
[19:29] of labor as god has really blessed her
[19:33] to be able to raise a god-fearing family
[19:36] in this dark and terrible day that we're
[19:38] living in
[19:39] to know that it takes more than just
[19:41] words but it has to be a life that
[19:43] inspires us into
[19:44] action so we really appreciate that and
[19:46] we love and appreciate everyone here
[19:49] tonight
[19:50] and those that may not have been able to
[19:52] connect but will hear the tape
[19:54] that despite whatever challenge or trial
[19:57] or situation
[19:58] that you are faced with you are born for
[20:00] a greater purpose
[20:01] and if you see everything else as a
[20:04] distraction
[20:05] and you keep single-eyed and focused on
[20:07] what god has planned for us
[20:08] then good things are in store for us so
[20:11] tonight
[20:12] without any further hesitation i have a
[20:15] thought
[20:15] tonight the mystery of the mercy of god
[20:20] the mystery of the mercy of god a bible
[20:22] study i
[20:23] i don't want to identify the character
[20:27] we will study just yet
[20:28] um because i want to start and i'm going
[20:30] to read a scripture to kind of give the
[20:32] background
[20:33] to where this is going to go tonight but
[20:35] the mystery of the mercy of god
[20:37] a study of and we're gonna get to the
[20:39] character in a second but i want to
[20:40] start
[20:41] and we're gonna move to a few scriptures
[20:44] before we get to our substantive text
[20:45] tonight
[20:46] but i want to start in matthew uh 12
[20:50] um if you have your bibles you should
[20:51] have it because it's a bible study
[20:53] and matthew 12 and we're going to read
[20:55] from verse 38 tonight just to kind of
[20:57] lay
[20:58] a background to what we will study
[21:00] tonight and to kind of see
[21:02] what god wants us to learn from this um
[21:05] we know bible study for us is a very
[21:07] practical
[21:08] very hands-on it's a practical class
[21:10] it's not just theory
[21:11] and we are looking to see what changes
[21:13] god wants in our behavior in our hearts
[21:16] and our lives
[21:17] our last study was job we did a part one
[21:19] and a part two
[21:20] and we were able to you know kind of see
[21:23] what god wanted to achieve through job
[21:25] and tonight we want to see what god will
[21:27] achieve but i want to kind of build a
[21:29] background before i get into who we will
[21:30] study tonight so
[21:31] matthew 12 and verse 38
[21:35] then certain of the scribes and of the
[21:37] pharisees
[21:38] answered saying master we would see a
[21:41] sign
[21:42] from thee but he answered and said unto
[21:45] them
[21:46] an evil and adulterous generation seek
[21:49] it after a sign
[21:50] and there shall be no sign there shall
[21:54] no sign be given to it
[21:55] but the sign of the prophet jonas now
[21:59] i want to read it in the amplified now
[22:01] these are not
[22:02] regular people speaking to jesus these
[22:05] are scribes and pharisees so these are
[22:07] learned the scribes were those who would
[22:09] be diligent at taking notes and
[22:11] records and history in the historical
[22:14] context and
[22:15] they would have a very clear expectation
[22:17] and an understanding of what should be
[22:18] taking place and of course
[22:20] the pharisees were on order unto
[22:21] themselves but in the amplified it says
[22:23] then some
[22:24] of the scribes and pharisees said to him
[22:26] teacher we want to see a sign
[22:29] and the amplified said a testing miracle
[22:31] so by a sign they wanted to see a
[22:33] display
[22:34] of something that they could see they
[22:36] were they were not satisfied with just
[22:38] the words that they were hearing they
[22:40] want to see a sign
[22:41] from you proving that you are what you
[22:44] claim to be
[22:45] so it was not just a sign that they
[22:47] wanted it was a sign
[22:49] as a challenge you know to say if you
[22:52] saw this saying then we will believe you
[22:54] so it was a sign of a childhood
[22:55] and it really disturbed jesus and he
[22:57] responded a certain way
[22:58] but he replied and said to them an evil
[23:01] and adulterous generation
[23:02] that is morally unfaithful to god craves
[23:06] and demands
[23:07] a miraculous sign but no sign will be
[23:10] given to it except the sign
[23:11] of the prophet jonah verse 40 for as
[23:14] jonas was
[23:15] three days and three nights in the
[23:17] whale's belly
[23:18] so shall the son of man be three days
[23:21] and three nights
[23:22] in the heart of the earth the men of
[23:24] nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
[23:27] generation
[23:28] and shall condemn it because they
[23:30] repented
[23:31] at the preaching of jonas and behold are
[23:34] greater than jonas is here
[23:36] the queen of the salt shall rise up in
[23:39] the judgment with this generation
[23:41] and shall condemn it for she came from
[23:44] the uttermost parts of the earth
[23:46] to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold
[23:50] are greater than solomon is here
[23:55] in jesus's earthly ministry
[23:58] he will reference only four
[24:02] writing prophets he would reference
[24:06] isaiah he would reference daniel
[24:10] he will reference zechariah and he would
[24:13] reference
[24:14] jonah jonah
[24:18] is unique because he receives more than
[24:21] just a mention
[24:23] the passage we read
[24:27] allows us to see that jesus identified
[24:30] himself
[24:32] with this prophet's three-day journey
[24:36] in the belly of the great whale noting
[24:39] it as a
[24:40] foreshadow of his own death that jesus
[24:43] would spend
[24:44] three days in the heart of the earth
[24:47] before his resurrection
[24:50] it is interesting to note that jesus was
[24:52] also identifying himself
[24:54] with the lowest or one of the lowest
[24:58] points
[24:58] of jonah's own life and ministry
[25:02] he was identifying himself not with a
[25:05] high point in jonah's life
[25:08] or moment of celebration for jonah
[25:11] but a moment of all the almost crushing
[25:14] defeat
[25:15] a moment of highlighting a man who was
[25:19] not where he was supposed to be
[25:21] we could argue the lowest point of his
[25:24] life
[25:25] teaches us something about god
[25:28] and the way he operates by now
[25:32] we should kind of know where i'm going
[25:33] so i'll complete my title
[25:35] the mystery of the mercy of god
[25:38] a study of jonah the book
[25:42] of jonah stands as an important link
[25:46] in the call of the prophetic chain
[25:48] giving us
[25:49] a glimpse into the death and
[25:51] resurrection of christ
[25:54] and a type that existed hundreds of
[25:56] years
[25:57] before jesus was actually on the earth
[26:02] our substantive text will be in jonah
[26:04] but before we get there
[26:06] the introduction to jonah is not found
[26:08] in jonah
[26:10] the introduction to jonah is found in
[26:12] the book of second kings
[26:14] so we can go to second kings 14.
[26:18] second kings 14 to verse 23 lay another
[26:21] foundation to
[26:22] what we want to speak about jonah here
[26:24] tonight second kings 14 verse 23
[26:28] and it says in second kings 14 23
[26:31] in the 15th year of amaziah
[26:35] the son of joash king of judah
[26:39] jeroboam the son of joash king of israel
[26:42] began to reign in samaria and reigned
[26:45] forty
[26:45] and one years and he did that which was
[26:49] evil in the sight of the lord he
[26:52] departed
[26:54] not from all the sins of jeroboam the
[26:57] son of nebuch
[26:58] who made israel to sin we would have
[26:59] read this when we were studying kings
[27:01] many bible studies ago he restored the
[27:04] coast of israel
[27:06] from the entering of muhammad unto the
[27:08] sea of the plain
[27:10] according to the word of the lord god of
[27:12] israel listen
[27:13] which he speak by the hand of his
[27:16] servant
[27:16] jonah the son of amitai the prophet
[27:20] which was of gather
[27:23] so we see jonah's ministry is not just
[27:26] captured
[27:27] in the book of jonah but his ministry
[27:29] also had a duration
[27:32] his ministry had a timing there were
[27:34] words that were spoken from jonah that
[27:36] is captured outside of the book
[27:38] of jonah rebuilding a little bit this
[27:40] location of gath peter near
[27:43] nazareth in the area that would
[27:46] later be known as galilee makes jonah
[27:50] one of the few prophets who healed from
[27:52] the northern kingdom
[27:54] of israel so we know a few things
[27:57] in building into and i'm building a
[28:00] background
[28:01] of what led to jonah 1 1 you know
[28:03] jeroboam
[28:04] ii is king he sits on the throne
[28:08] as one of if not the greatest king
[28:11] outside of solomon by pure domine of
[28:14] israel
[28:16] although he did evil in the sight of the
[28:18] lord the boundaries of israel
[28:20] had spread to the most expansive since
[28:23] king solomon
[28:24] was on the throne the blessings that
[28:27] would have flowed from abraham all down
[28:29] to that generation
[28:31] about sea possessing the gates of his
[28:33] enemy and
[28:34] where you put your foot is yours and
[28:36] these things were still in force
[28:38] although they were out of order
[28:39] the kingdom of israel was still
[28:42] spreading
[28:44] with jeroboam ii on the throne and with
[28:47] jonah
[28:47] as the prophet this would have been
[28:49] after the time of elijah
[28:51] assyria 500 miles to the east
[28:56] was a constant threat to the kingdom of
[28:59] israel
[29:02] israel constant ups and downs
[29:06] had created an issue with assyria
[29:09] that even the prophet hosea would have
[29:13] spoken of
[29:14] the interaction between israel and
[29:16] assyria
[29:17] even before the time of jonah and had
[29:20] declared
[29:21] that god would use assyria as an
[29:25] instrument of discipline or punishment
[29:27] against
[29:28] israel we can go to hosea 11
[29:32] we're still trying to get to jonah but i
[29:34] want us to see the background so in
[29:36] hosea 11
[29:37] and verse 1 we see hosea speaking
[29:42] describing a journey
[29:44] hosea 11 verse 1 when israel was a child
[29:48] then i loved him and called my son out
[29:52] of egypt so jose is speaking
[29:55] on behalf of god here when israel was a
[29:56] child so when israel was young
[29:58] in the early stages of israel then i
[30:01] loved him and i called my son out of
[30:03] egypt
[30:04] as they called them so they went from
[30:06] them
[30:08] he's describing the sacrifice on the
[30:10] balaam and burned incense to graven
[30:12] images
[30:13] i taught ephraim also to go taking them
[30:17] by their arms
[30:18] but they knew not that i healed them so
[30:22] here we see
[30:22] god taking issue with the fact that
[30:24] although he was doing things for them
[30:26] they weren't even acknowledging what he
[30:28] was doing for them
[30:30] you see how god takes note of it this is
[30:32] now after the fact he is still taking
[30:34] note
[30:35] of the behavior along the journey
[30:38] verse 4 i drew them with calls of a man
[30:42] with bands of love and i was to them
[30:46] as they that take off the yoke on their
[30:48] jaws and i laid
[30:49] meat unto them so this is this is not
[30:52] the narrative
[30:53] of reading joshua and reading the
[30:56] people's perspective of what god was
[30:58] doing
[30:58] this is like god's side of the story
[31:00] describing how god is seeing
[31:02] how he was handling them i drew them
[31:05] with chords of a man
[31:06] with bands of love in other words they
[31:09] were out of their bondage i give them
[31:11] love
[31:12] and i was to them as they that take off
[31:14] the yolk on their jaws in other words
[31:16] i was the one who was freeing them
[31:18] liberating them
[31:19] and i laid meat unto them i give them
[31:22] food
[31:24] he shall not return into the land of
[31:26] egypt so god is saying i'm not going to
[31:28] send israel
[31:28] back into bondage but the assyrian shall
[31:32] be his king
[31:34] so hosea is speaking that there will
[31:36] come a time when it will not be
[31:38] the captivity or the punishment of egypt
[31:41] but it will be the punishment of the
[31:43] assyrians upon them why
[31:45] because they refused to return and his
[31:48] return is to return to the lord
[31:51] so anybody who was aware of the
[31:54] scriptures
[31:56] of what would have transpired and as you
[31:58] read through the bible
[31:59] there's this repetition of reinforcing
[32:02] the journey
[32:03] the journey out of egypt the journey
[32:06] through different places
[32:07] and the pathway to reach the way they
[32:08] were so any patriotic
[32:11] loyal israelite would have longed
[32:14] for the destruction of the assyrians
[32:18] because the assyrians would have been
[32:20] mortal enemies to israel
[32:22] and would have been viewed as them who
[32:23] would have been given a mandate to
[32:25] punish israel can we go on
[32:30] so now i'm building into jonah prophets
[32:34] of israel
[32:35] are known to serve god and the people of
[32:38] god
[32:41] this was the job description
[32:44] they would intercede for the people
[32:47] they would cry out for the people
[32:50] they would lead the people in repentance
[32:54] this was expected this was understood
[32:59] this was normal after all you were
[33:02] born into israel your birth would give
[33:05] you access to certain benefits
[33:08] and the prophets who were appointed and
[33:10] placed by god
[33:11] were the mouthpiece of god prophets
[33:14] would bring messages of warning
[33:16] and then judgment with a purpose it
[33:19] wasn't just warning and judgment
[33:21] there was a purpose behind it and the
[33:23] purpose
[33:24] was always about turning the heart of
[33:26] the children to their fathers
[33:28] the purpose was always about
[33:30] reconciliation
[33:31] this was a great responsibility
[33:34] it was a great honor not to be taken
[33:37] lightly
[33:38] right with me we're building a little
[33:39] bit as you study the relationship
[33:42] between
[33:42] god and his prophets it is clear to see
[33:46] that god chooses
[33:47] how and when
[33:50] and what he communicates to his prophets
[33:53] i'll say it one more time it is clear
[33:55] that god chooses how
[33:57] he communicates when he communicates
[34:00] and what he communicates to his prophets
[34:02] but abraham said one time that the angel
[34:04] came to him he hadn't seen him in six
[34:07] months
[34:08] and the angel just looked at him and
[34:10] didn't say a word
[34:12] so i want us to pause and consider for a
[34:15] moment
[34:17] this solemnness the sacredness
[34:20] that comes with that point in time that
[34:23] interruption
[34:24] that breaking routine when the word of
[34:27] the lord comes to a prophet
[34:29] we have spoken about the sacredness the
[34:32] awesome presence
[34:33] the responsibility that will come to a
[34:35] prophet that typically would be a word
[34:38] to bring healing to their people
[34:40] everybody with me
[34:42] and i can imagine the day the hourly
[34:44] minute when jonah was interrupted
[34:48] the pause the alertness the attention
[34:50] the waiting on what god
[34:52] wanted jonah to do and as the lord spoke
[34:55] to jonah
[34:57] i don't know if jonah was taking notes i
[34:59] believe he was just taken into his heart
[35:01] but i want to see the picture i don't
[35:03] know how long jonah was waiting to hear
[35:05] a word from the lord
[35:06] but here it is finally god comes to
[35:09] speak to jonah
[35:10] the hesitation the growing sickening
[35:14] feeling in his stomach the nervousness
[35:16] as
[35:17] jonah processed what god wanted him to
[35:19] do
[35:21] many describe jonah as the unwilling
[35:23] prophet
[35:26] but most don't understand why jonah
[35:29] wasn't willing
[35:30] or what he was unwilling about
[35:33] let's go to jonah 1 1.
[35:38] now the word of the lord came unto jonah
[35:42] the son of ametai saying so we know he's
[35:45] same son of amata we know you say him
[35:46] jonah who is
[35:47] who is prophet under king jeroboam the
[35:50] second
[35:51] arise go to nineveh that great city
[35:54] and cry against it for their wickedness
[35:57] is come up before me
[36:01] nineveh is effectively the capital of
[36:03] assyria
[36:06] so the job assignment that was given to
[36:08] jonah
[36:10] was to bring mercy bring
[36:13] judgment bring an opportunity
[36:16] to a people that was not his own
[36:19] this effectively was outside of jonah's
[36:23] job description
[36:25] i want us to process this for a minute
[36:27] this was not jonah
[36:29] being told to go to the tribe of judah
[36:32] or the tribe of benjamin or go
[36:35] this was to go to the people of nineveh
[36:38] and cry against it
[36:40] for the wickedness has come up unto me
[36:44] we will find out later on that this was
[36:47] not a monologue
[36:49] it was not a one-sided conversation but
[36:52] jonah
[36:52] actually was given a response to god
[36:55] when he was speaking this to him
[36:58] jonah had some issues he had some real
[37:01] issues with this
[37:02] jonah wasn't running because he just
[37:05] didn't want to do it
[37:06] there was a reason why he just did not
[37:09] want
[37:10] to be responsible for dealing with these
[37:13] assyrians
[37:14] i want to still process this for a
[37:15] minute when the call of god came to
[37:18] jonah
[37:19] he could not see beyond his issues that
[37:22] he had
[37:23] with the assyrians
[37:27] jonah couldn't understand why god
[37:30] would come to him and ask him to do
[37:32] something that was against everything he
[37:34] jonah
[37:35] believed i want us to process this for a
[37:37] minute
[37:38] almighty god comes to jonah and jonah
[37:41] knows it's god
[37:43] the question is not if is god talking to
[37:45] me the question is not a word of the
[37:47] lord
[37:48] because it's clear and the word of the
[37:50] lord came to jonah
[37:52] the debate is not who was talking
[37:55] the debate is not what god wanted him to
[37:58] do
[37:59] the issue was jonah had a question and
[38:02] an issue
[38:04] and jonah allowed his personal issue
[38:09] to affect what god was telling him now
[38:11] this is massive
[38:13] i want us to process this the question
[38:16] wasn't if is god talking
[38:18] the question was not what the
[38:19] instruction was that was very clear
[38:21] the issue jonah had now this is not a
[38:24] member of a church
[38:25] this is not an elder this is not a
[38:27] deacon this is not a fifo minister
[38:29] this is not a pastor this is a prophet
[38:34] a placed position prophet who and i'll
[38:38] get it later in my notes
[38:40] who hears the word of the lord and has
[38:42] issue with what god once done
[38:45] that's that's that's profound
[38:50] how could god want him to take a message
[38:52] of mercy
[38:53] to the assyrians
[38:57] jonah is there trying to understand how
[38:59] could god have mercy on miami
[39:03] oh my oh my now we cannot how could god
[39:07] send me to bring a word to people who
[39:10] have been out for us
[39:13] how could god send me to bring a word
[39:16] to people who have hunted us who have
[39:19] abused us
[39:20] who have oppressed us our mortal enemies
[39:24] jonah could not deal with it anybody
[39:27] with me
[39:30] so jonah was of the view
[39:34] that mercy and i comment now into the
[39:37] message in a little bit
[39:38] that mercy was reserved for certain
[39:41] people
[39:43] jonah could not process the fact that
[39:46] god
[39:47] and he knew and we read it jonah knew
[39:51] the moment god spoke to him that god was
[39:53] sending mercy to them
[39:55] and jonah listen to me carefully didn't
[39:57] want them to get mercy
[40:02] my lord we we're going to see this
[40:04] scripture
[40:05] this prophet this bearer of the gospel
[40:08] this bearer of the good
[40:10] news because of maybe how he grew up
[40:13] hearing about the assyrians
[40:16] when the confrontation came with his
[40:19] test because this was a test
[40:21] for jonah when the test came for jonah
[40:25] he would have given words to jeroboam he
[40:28] would have did but when the test came
[40:29] for
[40:30] jonah and said jonah now your tests come
[40:33] i need you to display what we would say
[40:36] the virtue of our age
[40:38] and carry mercy and forgiveness
[40:41] to people who are not your own they are
[40:44] not of abraham
[40:45] they are not of israel but i want to
[40:47] give them mercy jonah say i am not
[40:49] with that program
[40:52] you know god loves to interrupt our
[40:55] expectations of how he is supposed to
[40:57] operate
[40:58] oh you don't hear me tonight i'm
[40:59] building it to something
[41:01] god is sovereign he is so sovereign he
[41:04] forces the issue to make you love your
[41:06] enemies he
[41:08] forces the issue to bring mercy and to
[41:10] bring love to the unlovable
[41:12] and at that point in jonah's life he
[41:15] could not
[41:16] reconcile is god that he served to do
[41:20] that act so
[41:21] jonah wasn't running because he didn't
[41:23] want to go he was running
[41:25] because he didn't want to bring mercy to
[41:27] them
[41:28] anybody with me all right let's build a
[41:30] little bit
[41:32] so now the word of the lord came to
[41:34] jonah the son
[41:35] of amitai saying go to nineveh
[41:39] that great city and proclaim judgment
[41:42] against it
[41:44] all right crying against it for their
[41:47] wickedness has come up before me
[41:49] but jonah rose up so he makes a decision
[41:53] now
[41:53] to flee onto taxes which is like
[41:56] literally tarshish is like the
[41:57] furthest if you study map then this
[41:59] stash is like spain
[42:01] so he leaves the almost the
[42:04] extreme the extremity of their domain
[42:08] he's gonna go as far as he possibly
[42:10] could go
[42:10] to tashish from the presence of the lord
[42:14] but iran i preach a man running from the
[42:16] presence of the lord
[42:18] and went down to dropper and he found a
[42:21] ship going to tashi so he paid the fear
[42:23] thereof
[42:24] and went down into it to go with them
[42:27] onto taxes
[42:28] from the presence of the lord
[42:32] you know how much stuff this word so let
[42:35] me bring another person now
[42:36] the only thing the word wants us to do
[42:38] the word requires us to do
[42:40] that goes against certain things that we
[42:43] hold dear to us
[42:44] so in in jonah's case is what his belief
[42:47] of
[42:47] what should happen i want to see is what
[42:49] should happen of to the assyrians
[42:51] what they deserve the
[42:54] the judgment that they're supposed to
[42:56] get what they're supposed to pay for
[42:58] what should happen to them and what he
[43:00] thought should happen to them
[43:01] all jonah wanted to ascend judgment
[43:03] judgment judgment judgment
[43:05] and god is saying no no it's not so i
[43:08] want you to go and deliver the people
[43:10] and i say listen this deliverance
[43:13] ministry right now is that my ministry
[43:17] i want us to see it now so and the word
[43:19] of god comes to us
[43:20] coming tonight coming every service to
[43:23] challenge us
[43:24] and our closely held beliefs not just
[43:27] about the message and scripture but what
[43:29] god
[43:29] demands from us anybody with me
[43:32] god's expectations of us that may be
[43:35] beyond our comprehension our
[43:37] understanding
[43:37] and our limited perspective of what god
[43:40] wants to achieve anybody with me tonight
[43:44] so let's go verse 4 but the lord sent
[43:47] out a great wind into the sea
[43:49] and there was a mighty tempest in the
[43:51] sea so that the ship
[43:53] was like to be broken then the mariners
[43:57] were afraid
[43:59] and cried every man unto his god
[44:01] lowercase g
[44:03] all right so everybody call into their
[44:05] deity
[44:06] and cast for the wares or the goods
[44:10] or the luggage that were in this ship in
[44:12] the sea
[44:13] to lighten it of them but listen to this
[44:16] jonah was going down into the side of
[44:18] the ship and he lay and was fast asleep
[44:22] now you see this kind of sleep this is
[44:26] the kind of sleep when you want to lock
[44:27] up the world
[44:29] it have a kind of sleep that you sleep
[44:32] when when you want to avoid things
[44:36] people go too different you see when
[44:38] you're under a certain kind of stress
[44:41] somebody pressure you and you see you
[44:42] know what let's go and
[44:44] you don't want to so jonah so shut off
[44:47] the external world that are storm
[44:49] shaking
[44:51] all right so that he sleeping
[44:54] so verse six so the shipmaster came to
[44:57] him
[44:58] and said to him what meanest thou o
[45:00] sleeper
[45:02] in other words in the amplified it says
[45:04] so the captain came up to him and said
[45:05] how can you stay asleep in other words
[45:08] the captain is shocked
[45:09] that his ship is about to break and this
[45:12] man so want to ignore
[45:14] his responsibility ignore his calling
[45:17] ignore the the the challenge he has to
[45:20] face that he has
[45:21] wheeled himself into a deep summer so
[45:24] sound
[45:25] so seemingly safe that the captain is
[45:28] perplexed
[45:29] that this man could be asleep and all
[45:30] this russian going on outside
[45:33] arise call upon thy god if so be that
[45:36] god will think upon us that we perish
[45:38] not
[45:39] so these sea men were trying to stack
[45:42] the odds in their favor
[45:43] they did not know which god would answer
[45:46] so they say let us all call on
[45:47] whichever version of god we believe so
[45:49] right now we're missing whoever you
[45:51] believe in
[45:51] because so far we have had no
[45:53] deliverance from this thing
[45:55] so perhaps the god yusuf might be the
[45:58] one who could stop what's going on
[45:59] anybody with me
[46:00] anybody here and they said everyone to
[46:04] his fellow
[46:06] come and let us cast a lot that we may
[46:08] know for whose cause
[46:10] this evil is upon us so they cast lots
[46:13] and a lot fell upon jonah so whatever
[46:16] they choose to throw around they
[46:17] recognize this thing
[46:18] this thing fall upon jonah then they
[46:21] said unto him tell us
[46:22] we pray thee for whose cause this evil
[46:26] is upon
[46:26] us and listen i love the questions
[46:30] what is that occupation when's come as
[46:33] thou
[46:35] what is thy country and of what people
[46:38] are dull
[46:38] i love it you see your car get away
[46:42] i almost losing my voice i'm getting
[46:43] excited here they asked jonah listen
[46:45] where's your occupation what is your
[46:48] occupation
[46:50] who are you because you have to be
[46:53] somebody
[46:54] for this thing to be affecting us this
[46:56] way
[46:57] where you're coming from what is your
[47:00] country
[47:00] and what people you're from and he's
[47:04] saying to them i
[47:05] am an hebrew
[47:09] and i feared the lord the god of heaven
[47:12] which had made the sea and the dry land
[47:15] then were the men
[47:16] exceedingly afraid and said unto him why
[47:19] has doubt done this for the
[47:22] knew that he fled from the presence of
[47:30] the from whence coming down where you're
[47:32] going whether he let them know
[47:35] anybody with me he
[47:38] let them know that he was running from
[47:41] the presence of god
[48:03] everybody with me
[48:14] i think i just got disconnected there
[48:16] for a brief moment
[48:21] so this so he had let them know that he
[48:23] was running from the presence of god
[48:30] are you hearing me again yeah okay
[48:36] then said they unto him what shall we do
[48:38] unto thee
[48:39] that the sea may be common to us
[48:42] for the sea wrought and was tempestuous
[48:45] so in other words what shall we do
[48:47] because the sea was becoming more and
[48:49] more violent it says in
[48:51] the amplified so there's an increasing
[48:53] intensity of what is going on so
[48:54] as jonah talking the ps not slowing down
[48:57] it actually getting more and more
[48:58] intense
[48:59] all right and he said unto them take me
[49:02] up
[49:02] and cast me forth into the sea so shall
[49:05] they see me come unto you
[49:06] for i know that for my sake this great
[49:09] tempest is upon us
[49:12] this great tempest is upon you
[49:14] nevertheless listen
[49:16] so i wanted to note that after jonah
[49:19] told them to throw me overboard
[49:21] verse 13 nevertheless the main road had
[49:24] to bring it to the land
[49:25] in other words they actually did not
[49:27] want
[49:31] jonah said trust overboard and then
[49:33] decide let me roll harder to get out of
[49:35] this thing
[49:36] but they could not for the sea wrote and
[49:40] was tempestuous
[49:41] against them so in other words in the
[49:43] amplified it says nevertheless
[49:45] the men rode hard breaking through the
[49:47] waves to return to land but they could
[49:49] not
[49:49] because the sea became even more violent
[49:52] surging higher against them
[49:54] so their effort to save jonah start to
[49:57] work against them
[49:59] anybody with me all right wherefore they
[50:02] cried unto the lord
[50:03] and said we beseech the o lord we be cg
[50:06] let us not perish
[50:07] for this man's life and lay not upon us
[50:11] innocent blood for doubt all lord has
[50:14] done as it please thee in other words
[50:17] listen we don't want to show this man
[50:18] overboard but it look as if
[50:21] you want to move on board so whatever
[50:23] please you don't hold it against us
[50:25] and verse 15 so they took up jonah
[50:28] and cast him forth into the sea and the
[50:31] sea
[50:31] ceased from her raging then the men
[50:34] feared
[50:35] the lord exceedingly and offered a
[50:37] sacrifice unto the lord
[50:39] so this for them was immediate
[50:41] conversion
[50:43] immediate conversion those men got
[50:45] delivered right there and then at that
[50:47] point was the deliverance
[50:48] the men fear the lord they see as lord
[50:51] the beginning of wisdom
[50:52] fear the lord exceedingly so it wasn't
[50:54] just fear it was exceedingly fear
[50:56] exceeding fear and offered a sacrifice
[50:58] unto the lord
[50:59] and made vows they pledged what they're
[51:02] going to do from that day on as evolved
[51:05] verse 17 on the lord had prepared a
[51:07] great fish
[51:08] to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the
[51:12] belly
[51:13] of the fish three days and three nights
[51:16] now let's build jonah chapter two
[51:22] then jonah prayed unto the lord his god
[51:24] out of the fish's belly now
[51:26] we reach the fish's belly brother
[51:27] branham said jonah was backslidden
[51:33] powerful statement he said jonah there's
[51:36] a direct quote but everybody said
[51:37] in the belly of the wave jonah was
[51:39] backside
[51:41] that blow me away completely
[51:45] because
[51:48] people seem to think that the higher you
[51:51] go
[51:52] in ministry the more immune to backside
[51:54] than you become
[51:59] so i want to bring a thought here
[52:02] that but everybody said jonah baxter
[52:05] this is not an
[52:05] apostle a past study by the teacher this
[52:08] is a prophet
[52:09] still in his office but backslidden
[52:12] but iban said this multiple times still
[52:15] in his office of a prophet
[52:17] god didn't remove the officer from him
[52:19] but he was making bad decisions
[52:23] still in his office and allowing
[52:26] personal issues
[52:27] to affect his judgment what he was going
[52:31] through was the product of
[52:32] personal issues affecting his judgment
[52:35] still in his office
[52:37] check this ignoring a direct word of the
[52:40] lord
[52:45] jonah 2 1 then jonah prayed unto the
[52:48] lord his god out of the fish's belly and
[52:51] said
[52:51] i cried by reason of mine affliction
[52:54] unto the lord and he heard me
[52:56] so now jonah now starting to get some
[52:58] level of reconciliation
[53:00] no all right
[53:03] and he heard me out of the belly of hell
[53:06] cried i
[53:07] and thou heard us my voice
[53:10] for thou has cast me into the deep in
[53:13] the midst of the seas
[53:14] and the floods come pass me about
[53:18] all thy billows and thy waves passed
[53:20] over me
[53:21] then i said i am cast out of thy sight
[53:24] anybody with me yet i will look again
[53:28] toward thy holy temple
[53:31] so jonah is in the middle of his
[53:34] whale belly experience but jonah is
[53:36] getting in the spirit
[53:38] he is not where he needs to be just yet
[53:40] but he is warming up anybody with me
[53:42] he he now kind of starts in the he in
[53:45] some trouble
[53:46] but he not moping in self pity in his
[53:48] trouble
[53:49] he is starting to realize that he have
[53:51] to do something about
[53:53] his situation he may have messed up but
[53:55] he's not going to let that just get to
[53:56] him
[53:57] he said i cried by reason of mine
[54:00] affliction of the lord and and he heard
[54:01] me
[54:02] out of the belly of hell cried i and i
[54:04] heard is my voice so
[54:06] he knows he is in communication now he
[54:08] is he is he is beginning to reattach
[54:10] some wires
[54:11] that have been disconnected anybody with
[54:13] me
[54:14] for dow has cast me he's acknowledging
[54:17] that though has cast me to the deep in
[54:19] the midst of the seas
[54:20] and the floods can pass me about all thy
[54:23] billows and thy ways pass over me
[54:25] then i said i am cast out and i said yet
[54:27] yet
[54:28] although i know you're taking me through
[54:30] a process yet i will look again toward
[54:33] thy holy temple
[54:34] thy waters can pass me about even to the
[54:37] soul
[54:38] and the depth closed me around about the
[54:41] weeds were wrapped above my head
[54:43] i went down to the bottoms of the
[54:45] mountains the earth with her bars was
[54:47] above
[54:48] me forever yet has thou brought up my
[54:51] life from corruption
[54:52] oh lord my god when my soul fainted
[54:56] within me i remember the lord is there
[54:58] anybody tonight
[55:00] who could give that kind of testimony
[55:02] when my soul fainted
[55:03] within me i remember the lord and my
[55:07] prayer
[55:07] came in unto thee into that holy temple
[55:10] they that observed lion vanities forsake
[55:13] their own mercy
[55:15] but i will sacrifice unto thee with the
[55:17] voice of thanksgiving
[55:19] i will pay that i have vowed salvation
[55:22] is of the lord
[55:24] and the lord spake unto the fish i want
[55:26] us to notice
[55:27] it is it is in context when job reached
[55:31] that point where he said i will pay that
[55:33] i have vote
[55:34] i will keep what my promise supposed to
[55:36] be salvation is of the lord
[55:38] and the lord spake under the fish and it
[55:41] vomited our jonah
[55:42] upon the dry land anybody with me i told
[55:45] there's an easy class tonight right
[55:50] and the word of the lord
[55:54] came unto jonah the second time
[55:57] now we're building saying arise
[56:01] go on to nineveh that great city
[56:04] so this second time is is now a
[56:06] different journal listen
[56:08] god not finished with him yet but it's a
[56:09] different jonah from college jonah one
[56:12] jonah
[56:12] right this is a different journal the
[56:14] word of the lord came with the jonah the
[56:15] second
[56:16] time saying arise go on to nineveh that
[56:19] great city and preach unto it the
[56:21] preaching that i bit thee
[56:23] so jonah didn't have his own message the
[56:26] sermon was given to him
[56:28] you see it the preaching that i bid thee
[56:30] so so the message the title
[56:32] the subject the inspiration the
[56:34] scriptures god give him the message
[56:36] and say all i need to do is go and
[56:38] deliver this
[56:40] so jonah arose and went on to nineveh
[56:42] according to the word of the lord
[56:46] now nineveh was an exceeding great city
[56:48] of three days journey
[56:50] and jonah began to enter into the city a
[56:52] day's journey and he cried
[56:54] and said yet forty days and none never
[56:57] shall be overthrown
[57:01] verse five so the people of nineveh
[57:04] believed god
[57:06] and proclaimed a fast and put on
[57:10] sackcloth from the greatest of them
[57:13] even to the least of them this is
[57:16] powerful now right
[57:17] forward came unto the king of nineveh
[57:21] and he arose from his throne and he laid
[57:23] his robe
[57:24] with him and covered him with sackcloth
[57:29] and sat in ashes and he caused it
[57:32] to be proclaimed and published through
[57:34] nineveh
[57:35] by the decree of the king and his noble
[57:37] saying let neither man nor
[57:40] beast heard nor flock taste
[57:43] anything let them not feed nor drink
[57:46] water but let man and beast be covered
[57:49] with sackcloth
[57:50] and cry mightily unto god this is not
[57:54] tribe of israel people
[57:57] this is gentile people let them tune
[58:00] everyone from this evil way
[58:02] and from the violence that is in their
[58:04] hands
[58:05] who can tell listen to the king would
[58:08] who can tell if god will turn and repent
[58:11] and turn away from his fierce anger
[58:14] that we perish not and listen to verse
[58:18] 10
[58:19] and god saw their works that they turned
[58:22] from their evil way
[58:24] and god repented of the evil that
[58:27] he had said that he will do unto them
[58:30] and he did it not
[58:32] you you hear that now you can see why
[58:34] jesus could say
[58:36] the people of nineveh would rise up
[58:40] in judgment against the generation
[58:43] because they repented all right so
[58:47] most people have a understanding of
[58:49] jonah to a point
[58:50] but i want to now go to the last chapter
[58:53] of jonah
[58:54] i told you that is an easy class and it
[58:57] is the first time
[58:58] somebody has a job a responsibility
[59:01] a target and when they hit the target
[59:04] they get frustrated
[59:06] they get upset jonah
[59:09] chapter 4 verse 1 but it displeased
[59:12] jonah exceedingly and he was very angry
[59:17] oh my
[59:21] whoo this is the first person who hit a
[59:25] goal
[59:26] and get vexed because they achieved
[59:27] success usually when somebody hits
[59:30] what it's supposed to achieve they're
[59:32] really happy that they achieve the goal
[59:34] so this first verse here shows that
[59:38] jonah was preaching and hoping people do
[59:40] repent
[59:45] that's why i call this the mystery of
[59:47] god's mercy
[59:49] because although jonah went through his
[59:51] experience
[59:52] and come out a little better he still
[59:55] had an issue with who god should help
[59:57] oh lord help us he still had a problem
[1:00:00] with who god should give mercy to so
[1:00:04] jonah chapter 3 was jonah preaching
[1:00:08] a message from the lord but in his heart
[1:00:10] he was hoping oh god i don't wanna
[1:00:12] repent a preaching repentance
[1:00:14] a preaching judgment but i don't want
[1:00:16] him i don't want him to do it along the
[1:00:18] way isn't it
[1:00:19] so listen carefully now but it is please
[1:00:22] jonah exceedingly this is not just
[1:00:23] displeased jonah a little bit you know
[1:00:25] he is furious he was very angry
[1:00:29] and he prayed unto the lord and said i
[1:00:33] pray thee oh lord
[1:00:34] this is where i say that the
[1:00:36] conversation in jonah 1
[1:00:37] 1 was not a one-sided conversation
[1:00:40] listen to jonah's words
[1:00:41] and he prayed unto the lord and said i
[1:00:43] pray thee oh lord
[1:00:44] was not this my saying in other words at
[1:00:47] 12 years old
[1:00:48] when i was yet in my country therefore
[1:00:52] i fled before unto so we see
[1:00:55] now jonah is admitting why he fled
[1:00:59] he said i told you so and what did he
[1:01:03] tell god for i knew that thou art a
[1:01:06] gracious god
[1:01:07] and merciful slaughter anger
[1:01:10] and of great kindness and repentance be
[1:01:13] of the evil
[1:01:15] so when jonah was given the commission
[1:01:18] to go to nineveh
[1:01:20] jonah knew the god himself he said our
[1:01:23] god is too forgiving
[1:01:25] he slaughter anger the moment you repent
[1:01:28] he ready to pull back judgment from you
[1:01:30] anybody in the house tonight
[1:01:31] so jonah understood the mercies of god
[1:01:34] to israel
[1:01:35] and say if god sent me to the assyrians
[1:01:38] they too will get mercy
[1:01:40] because this god i served or changed it
[1:01:42] doesn't matter who he's dealing with
[1:01:44] he is slow to anger you you reading this
[1:01:46] thing
[1:01:48] you want to tell me god can help
[1:01:49] everybody listen
[1:01:51] for i knew so imagine so
[1:01:54] i want us to rewindly take back to jonah
[1:01:57] one
[1:01:57] when the word of the lord came to jonah
[1:01:59] and jonah getting the word
[1:02:01] and jonah started to actually answer
[1:02:03] gordon
[1:02:05] because he's saying i pray thee was not
[1:02:07] this my saying
[1:02:08] did i not tell you lord i told you when
[1:02:11] i was yet in my country
[1:02:12] and this is why listen to jonah this is
[1:02:15] prophet jonah
[1:02:16] this is why i fled on to tashas for i
[1:02:19] knew
[1:02:20] that though out of gracious god anybody
[1:02:23] know he's a gracious god
[1:02:25] and he jonah had a revelation that the
[1:02:28] graciousness of god
[1:02:30] was not limited to those who were born
[1:02:31] of abraham by
[1:02:33] blood jonah had a revelation that the
[1:02:36] graciousness of god
[1:02:37] was bigger than what god could do for
[1:02:39] him and his own people
[1:02:40] kind of church amen and merciful
[1:02:43] slaughter
[1:02:44] anger and of great kindness and
[1:02:46] repentancy of the evil
[1:02:49] now listen to how bad it get to jonah
[1:02:51] jonah's issue with the assyrians was so
[1:02:54] bad listen to this
[1:02:55] most people never read this before verse
[1:02:57] 3 therefore now oh lord take i
[1:03:00] beseech thee my life from me only thing
[1:03:03] is joke jonah had an issue
[1:03:06] jonah said this mercy and graciousness
[1:03:08] is too much for me to handle
[1:03:10] kill me take my life from me
[1:03:15] i can't process this your graciousness
[1:03:18] is too much
[1:03:18] these people don't deserve this kind of
[1:03:20] mercy
[1:03:23] isn't this profound look how you can
[1:03:26] have stuff
[1:03:27] locked up in your heart
[1:03:30] look how god can deliver somebody and
[1:03:32] they're in church and you're still
[1:03:33] looking at them funny oh my oh my oh my
[1:03:35] and it eaten you up because you don't
[1:03:37] know how god could turn that person's
[1:03:39] life around and
[1:03:40] but they messed up so much and and now
[1:03:42] they're in church worshiping and and you
[1:03:44] get a fight with them you cannot
[1:03:45] you can't even worship you whole service
[1:03:48] you've ex
[1:03:50] because they are worshiping god because
[1:03:51] god wasn't for them and you can't
[1:03:53] rejoice with them at all because as far
[1:03:55] as you concerned is
[1:03:56] judgment they're supposed to get this
[1:04:00] is not before jonah went into the wheel
[1:04:02] no
[1:04:03] jonah went through his own trial still
[1:04:05] come out of his child
[1:04:07] and still saying lord i can't deal with
[1:04:09] your mercy and your grace
[1:04:10] to them i could accept your grace to me
[1:04:14] but i can accept it to them oh come on
[1:04:16] now anybody hearing me tonight
[1:04:19] jonah was comfortable with acknowledging
[1:04:22] what god did for him
[1:04:23] and god's mercy to him but jonah could
[1:04:26] not
[1:04:26] deal with god's mercy to somebody else
[1:04:30] this rips the rug under judging how god
[1:04:34] could use somebody
[1:04:37] it doesn't matter what they did or what
[1:04:39] god used them to do
[1:04:41] god was pulling the rug in scripture
[1:04:44] in precedent and in jonah's world of how
[1:04:47] he could reach out to anybody
[1:04:49] despite what the assyrians had done to
[1:04:51] israel
[1:04:52] god went to the capital of assyria and
[1:04:54] turned around the heart of the king
[1:04:56] and all the people there now prophet
[1:05:00] jonah
[1:05:00] have his issues imagine heaven rejoicing
[1:05:03] because people repenting and jonah the
[1:05:06] prophet
[1:05:06] go and having a mind battle and having
[1:05:09] now suicidal thoughts
[1:05:10] verse 3 therefore now oh lord take ibcg
[1:05:14] besieged means beg it's not just a
[1:05:16] request he begging the lord
[1:05:18] take i mean it's easy my life from me
[1:05:22] for it is better for me to die than to
[1:05:24] live
[1:05:26] then the lord then said the lord do as
[1:05:29] thou
[1:05:30] well to be angry you know in in other
[1:05:33] words
[1:05:34] do you have a reason to be angry
[1:05:37] in other words what are you upset about
[1:05:40] i am sovereign i choose to redeem them i
[1:05:43] choose to restore brother so and so i
[1:05:45] choose to restore
[1:05:46] sister so-and-so i put their name
[1:05:50] on the book you don't know
[1:05:53] what name they have on the book you hear
[1:05:56] angry because i blessed them
[1:05:57] i want i want this to go deep enough
[1:06:01] because jonah was not allowed into the
[1:06:04] mind of god considering the assyrians
[1:06:06] so his limited perspective of the plan
[1:06:08] of god
[1:06:09] was limited to his understanding of what
[1:06:11] amos said
[1:06:12] and hosea said and the history and what
[1:06:14] happened in the message
[1:06:16] and what happened 20 years ago and that
[1:06:18] he was in that church and he didn't
[1:06:19] believe
[1:06:20] and he have a fourth doctrine and all
[1:06:21] this stuff kind of jonah had
[1:06:23] jonah ready to die
[1:06:29] verse four we almost done short class
[1:06:32] easy class
[1:06:34] abc class then said the lord do as thou
[1:06:37] well to be angry so jonah
[1:06:41] went out of the city
[1:06:45] jonah so disturbed he cannot stand to
[1:06:47] see these people rejoicing
[1:06:49] and free and liberated that the word
[1:06:51] listen
[1:06:52] the message and what does the paradox
[1:06:55] say you preach a message
[1:06:57] see people at the altar delivered see
[1:06:59] people set free
[1:07:00] and you walk out the building because
[1:07:02] you can't believe
[1:07:04] they repented the message you preach
[1:07:06] bring deliverance and you outside the
[1:07:08] building of vex
[1:07:09] that people are crying out into the lord
[1:07:12] so jonah went out
[1:07:13] of the city and sat on the east side of
[1:07:16] the city
[1:07:16] and there made him a boot and sat
[1:07:20] under it in the shadow till he might see
[1:07:22] what would become of the city
[1:07:24] so jonah there waiting for them to undo
[1:07:29] undo their repentance oh i done i done
[1:07:31] tonight
[1:07:33] you see why god has to walk with all of
[1:07:34] us what would become of the city
[1:07:38] in other words jonah is there trying to
[1:07:41] figure
[1:07:42] out what would happen would they repent
[1:07:45] what god said judge them he's still
[1:07:46] looking for some measure of judgment
[1:07:49] and the lord prepared a god which is a
[1:07:52] plant
[1:07:53] and made it to come up over jonah that
[1:07:56] it might be a
[1:07:56] shadow over his head to deliver him from
[1:07:59] his grief
[1:08:02] so jonah was exceedingly glad of the god
[1:08:04] he planned
[1:08:07] but god prepared a worm when the morning
[1:08:10] rose the next day
[1:08:12] and it smote the god that it withered
[1:08:17] and it came to pass when the sun did
[1:08:19] arise
[1:08:20] that god prepared a vehement east wind
[1:08:24] that the sun beat upon the head of jonah
[1:08:27] that he fainted
[1:08:29] and wished himself to die and said it is
[1:08:31] better for me to die than to live
[1:08:36] so you will recognize that the story of
[1:08:39] jonah
[1:08:40] nineveh and what happened is really the
[1:08:42] second plotter
[1:08:43] is ready jonah is the issue here
[1:08:47] jonah is this is the book of jonah for a
[1:08:50] real reason
[1:08:51] because it's jonah just like job where
[1:08:54] the
[1:08:54] the job one man and the man at the end
[1:08:57] of job
[1:08:57] is two different men god already dealing
[1:09:00] with a prophet
[1:09:02] and the fact that prophets have to come
[1:09:04] to maturity
[1:09:05] just as god can tell by the random you
[1:09:06] need to be more sincere
[1:09:09] that is why your faith cannot rest on
[1:09:10] man
[1:09:14] you have to trust god you have to pray
[1:09:17] that god bring all of us into maturity
[1:09:24] verse nine we're almost done and god
[1:09:26] said to jonah
[1:09:28] do his though well to be angry for the
[1:09:30] god
[1:09:33] and he said i do well to be angry even
[1:09:35] unto death
[1:09:36] so in other words jonah is now vexed
[1:09:40] that the plan gone so israeli jonah
[1:09:43] already have some issues that god trying
[1:09:44] to help him out through it
[1:09:48] then the lord said though has had pity
[1:09:50] under god
[1:09:51] for the witch dog has not labored in
[1:09:53] other words you didn't plant it
[1:09:56] neither made us it grew which came up in
[1:09:59] a night and perish in the night
[1:10:02] and should not i spare nineveh
[1:10:05] that great city wearing a more than
[1:10:09] six core thousand persons that cannot
[1:10:12] discern
[1:10:13] between their right hand and their left
[1:10:15] hand and all so much cattle
[1:10:20] and that's how the book of jonah ends so
[1:10:22] god was showing
[1:10:23] jonah one you can't question me two
[1:10:27] how you could be angry now you're angry
[1:10:28] about a plan that you didn't put in
[1:10:30] place so god was saying to him
[1:10:31] is i raise this city up you know if i
[1:10:34] want to deliver them i could deliver
[1:10:36] them
[1:10:37] so i want to kind of close this session
[1:10:39] out to encourage
[1:10:40] and kind of just bring out some
[1:10:41] highlight points out of this in closing
[1:10:45] on the surface on a surface level
[1:10:49] we see jonah a man running from the
[1:10:52] presence of god
[1:10:54] we call him the unwilling prophet almost
[1:10:57] grudgingly or being good and
[1:11:00] in a very surprising twist
[1:11:03] in the story as it were becoming
[1:11:07] actually visibly angry when he is
[1:11:09] successful at his task his mission his
[1:11:11] mandate his job
[1:11:13] of turning the people of nineveh around
[1:11:19] the people of assyria the ninevites were
[1:11:22] enemies to israel
[1:11:25] so god's command to jonah was against as
[1:11:28] we said
[1:11:28] everything he believed in it was nothing
[1:11:31] that he expected he would be ever called
[1:11:33] to do
[1:11:34] so he was being challenged to do what he
[1:11:36] never thought he had to do
[1:11:39] and jonah even as a prophet had
[1:11:42] trouble reconciling the word of god
[1:11:44] concerning his
[1:11:45] mission because of his personal issues
[1:11:49] this challenges us all to look at what
[1:11:52] personal
[1:11:53] issues decision thoughts feelings we
[1:11:55] have that actually hinder
[1:11:56] us achieving the mission and the mandate
[1:11:59] that the world gives us our
[1:12:00] accomplishment this day
[1:12:07] apart from the fear that jonah would
[1:12:10] have
[1:12:11] at what the assyrians could be or should
[1:12:13] do
[1:12:15] jonah by the time you read jonah iv
[1:12:18] his deepest fear which is which is
[1:12:22] really a paradox his deepest fear was
[1:12:24] actually the fear of
[1:12:26] success because jonah
[1:12:29] understood that if the people repented
[1:12:32] they would be shown mercy
[1:12:36] so jonah was preaching with our almost
[1:12:38] self-sabotaging agenda
[1:12:42] you know you struggle sometimes with
[1:12:44] wondering if people are really happy for
[1:12:46] you
[1:12:48] and here it is jonah until
[1:12:52] god was finished with him was operating
[1:12:54] and really hoping that these people
[1:12:56] don't make it through
[1:12:59] really really powerful to really think
[1:13:02] about
[1:13:04] jonah understood that the god he served
[1:13:06] as we read it before
[1:13:08] is a gracious god merciful slaughter
[1:13:11] anger
[1:13:11] of great kindness and will repent of
[1:13:13] evil once people repent
[1:13:19] i challenge us tonight in
[1:13:22] so many different ways one many of us
[1:13:26] running from the presence of god
[1:13:28] running from the accountability of god
[1:13:31] running from the word of god
[1:13:33] and deeper than that are the issues in
[1:13:36] our lives that hold us back from
[1:13:38] achieving
[1:13:38] the purpose of god i'm finished tonight
[1:13:42] like i said is a short introductory
[1:13:44] class back to bible study tonight
[1:13:46] let us bow our heads forward of praying
[1:13:49] our gracious heavenly father lord we
[1:13:51] thank you tonight for this
[1:13:53] short teaching tonight on the mystery
[1:13:56] the divine
[1:13:58] mystery lord of your mercy
[1:14:01] this mystery of the mercy of god that is
[1:14:04] tied to sovereignty the fact that you
[1:14:06] are sovereign god
[1:14:08] you could deliver who you want to
[1:14:09] deliver you could set free who you want
[1:14:12] to set free
[1:14:12] you can show mercy to whom you want to
[1:14:14] show mercy and lord we have to check
[1:14:17] ourselves because it's so easy
[1:14:19] for us to put our perspective and
[1:14:21] thoughts on
[1:14:22] how people should be judged and who
[1:14:24] should be judged and what god should do
[1:14:26] or shouldn't do
[1:14:27] how he should act and lord we see jonah
[1:14:30] struggling
[1:14:31] with how you wanted to show mercy to who
[1:14:34] would have been as it were the enemies
[1:14:36] of israel
[1:14:37] lord even as a man on a mission
[1:14:40] he secretly was wishing for failure as
[1:14:43] it were
[1:14:44] being upset when people actually turned
[1:14:46] around and was shown mercy
[1:14:48] and lord how lord you would redeem jonah
[1:14:51] as it were
[1:14:52] and tie yourself to him and tie yourself
[1:14:56] to that moment when jonah was in the
[1:14:58] will
[1:14:59] as a type of lord of of of your
[1:15:02] lord death burial and resurrection that
[1:15:05] in the divine plan of god
[1:15:07] you was using jonah lord just as you use
[1:15:10] so many characters through scripture
[1:15:13] lord we looked at how
[1:15:14] true matthew 1 lord you use so many
[1:15:18] lord lord you use rahab lord you use
[1:15:21] tamar you you use all these different
[1:15:24] broken people as it were to help bring
[1:15:27] life and hope and redemption to other
[1:15:29] broken people
[1:15:31] lord we can't even judge jonah tonight
[1:15:34] lord because he was part of a divine
[1:15:36] plan but we want to take a
[1:15:39] lesson tonight to look in our hearts
[1:15:42] lord to check what makes us hold back
[1:15:45] what makes us do certain things
[1:15:47] lord against your word and your will you
[1:15:50] sent a prophet to us
[1:15:51] to tell us how to go how to prepare and
[1:15:54] lord help us to
[1:15:55] have bigger hearts as it were to be more
[1:15:58] inclusive
[1:15:59] lord to not have our perspective on how
[1:16:02] you should move and how you should
[1:16:03] operate lord and to trust you
[1:16:06] lord to know that you could deliver
[1:16:08] anyone from any situation
[1:16:10] lord because you showed it here you even
[1:16:12] delivered the enemies
[1:16:14] of israel lord you brought freedom
[1:16:17] and deliverance to mortal enemies as it
[1:16:20] will
[1:16:21] help us lord as you challenge us when
[1:16:23] you are on the earth that our
[1:16:24] mind it is to love our enemies to do
[1:16:27] good to them that despise us to
[1:16:29] turn the other cheek as it will it's a
[1:16:31] powerful message of
[1:16:33] forgiveness and redemption and
[1:16:35] restoration
[1:16:36] and of your goodness and your gracious
[1:16:38] god a merciful god help us to have
[1:16:40] that kind of mercy help us to be slow to
[1:16:43] anger
[1:16:44] help us to be of great kindness and lord
[1:16:47] help us to
[1:16:48] be quick to lord repent of evil and to
[1:16:51] let things go may you
[1:16:52] be with it one tonight may you touch
[1:16:54] your people lord in this little bible
[1:16:56] study tonight
[1:16:57] lord may you minister to families to
[1:16:59] homes to situations lord

[1:17:04] may that forgiveness take place if peace

[1:17:08] take place may you bless the service
