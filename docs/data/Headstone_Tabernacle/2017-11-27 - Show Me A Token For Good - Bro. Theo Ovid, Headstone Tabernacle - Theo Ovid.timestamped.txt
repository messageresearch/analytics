[2:10:25] time you know then you know bawling oh
[2:10:28] god oh god oh god
[2:10:29] hospital bed some kinda thing having
[2:10:31] some sickness some kind of crash some
[2:10:33] kind of thing like that then they want

[2:10:38] but yours wait till that strike you he
[2:10:42] have no eyes but yours we tell that
[2:10:44] shake you that just as demons need
[2:10:47] bodies activate their power and they

[2:10:53] activate the operation of the Holy
[2:10:55] Spirit God need men caught coal men
[2:10:59] separated men that he could anoint and
[2:11:02] use for his glory and honor sanctified
[2:11:04] men men filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:11:07] Oh glory that's what God want you still
[2:11:10] full of God not natural people that's
[2:11:13] ordinary you don't want to be a natural
[2:11:15] Jewish member you want to be a spiritual
[2:11:18] inspired son and daughter of God
[2:11:20] [Applause]
[2:11:24] that's the way the messages you can
[2:11:27] sympathize with it okay here's a woman
[2:11:29] standing here I'm a young man waiting to
[2:11:31] get married she meets my specifications
[2:11:32] every week she's a lovely Christian she
[2:11:34] looks like one she's just like one she
[2:11:36] acts like one she lives like one admit
[2:11:37] she's making a good wife but she isn't
[2:11:39] mine until I take off for mine that's
[2:11:41] the way the message is you can
[2:11:43] sympathize with it you can see it's
[2:11:44] right but you've got to take it in
[2:11:46] yourself and become part of it
[2:11:48] then you and the message becomes one and
[2:11:51] here the bomb then the anointing is with
[2:11:55] you as it is with others that's when you
[2:12:00] take the word and it becomes yours so
[2:12:03] it's no longer the prophet message or
[2:12:05] the message not as your message now you
[2:12:07] become one with it this is what you want
[2:12:09] to see live when you read this you come
[2:12:11] to the church to see this oh you want to
[2:12:13] see this in your life Oh glory to God in

[2:23:35] living it also walk after the spirit but
[2:23:40] after the flesh because they are in the
[2:23:43] flesh cannot please God
[2:23:45] [Applause]
[2:23:53] probably the cardamom my so Branham this
[2:23:59] was desperation he was seeing a message
[2:24:01] this morning was they highlight message
[2:24:03] of my entire ministry I highlight
[2:24:05] message of my entire ministry that one
[2:24:07] message moving after that place that was
[2:24:09] the capping off of it you see the token
[2:24:12] I sure you know what to talk meant the
[2:24:15] plans being applied the price had been
[2:24:17] asked required of God Jesus pay that
[2:24:19] price my shed his own blood and from his
[2:24:21] life Kim from his life Kim the Holy
[2:24:22] Spirit and when here we go when the
[2:24:25] blood is applied to you which is the
[2:24:27] full word the Holy Spirit is that taught
[2:24:29] me that your price is paid God has
[2:24:31] receive you and that's the token blood
[2:24:34] apply to you how they talk we have
[2:24:36] talked about all along but now is
[2:24:40] the manifestation of the token now we
[2:24:42] have sometimes a loaded glutens are
[2:24:44] loaded except in the world
[2:24:45] I said in Christ a personal Savior made
[2:24:47] they said when you happy get happy
[2:24:48] enough to show that's it Pentecostal say
[2:24:50] speak in tongues then you got it but the
[2:24:52] token is the token it is you and crisis
[2:24:55] person together it's the Holy Spirit his
[2:24:57] life and you work in his life through
[2:25:00] you it's for a rich is for the poor is
[2:25:03] for whosoever will receive it
[2:25:05] oh my so the life and out which was God
[2:25:08] and the word comes are given to them
[2:25:11] eternal life
[2:25:12] isn't that right and that is Zoe meaning
[2:25:14] God's own life
[2:25:15] that is not your life that has his own
[2:25:18] life then the light that was in Christ
[2:25:20] as the Holy Ghost
[2:25:20] another third person by the same person
[2:25:23] in the form the Holy Spirit coming upon
[2:25:25] you as a talking that your life and your
[2:25:28] fear speed you have been accepted until
[2:25:31] that token comes you are not permitted
[2:25:33] to be on the highway look what you will
[2:25:36] what you are that is how you know you
[2:25:39] see what is the evidence brother Branham
[2:25:42] I feel it in your minds why will I know
[2:25:44] how I know he said look what you are
[2:25:46] what you will look what you are there's
[2:25:49] how you know what was you before his
[2:25:51] took one supply what was you after was
[2:25:53] applied what was your desires before
[2:25:55] what is your desires after then you know
[2:25:59] whether you have the token applied or
[2:26:00] not
[2:26:02] these are the things automatic google it
[2:26:03] the devic and impersonal any of those
[2:26:05] gives some things but it cannot be the
[2:26:07] holy ghost he can implicitly these gifts
[2:26:10] but he can't be the Holy Ghost and the
[2:26:12] Holy Ghost is a token that the blood has
[2:26:15] been applied here we go because it
[2:26:18] follows the blood all the way from the
[2:26:22] book of redemption you see that the Holy
[2:26:27] Ghost the token follows the blood all
[2:26:30] the way from the book of redemption that
[2:26:34] was the province of his common that what
[2:26:37] he followed every age in every age he
[2:26:40] followed up the seasons brought forth so
[2:26:44] in every age the world of that age the
[2:26:47] spirit follow that to bring it far to
[2:26:50] bring it forth brood over it and this
[2:26:52] would have to be booted that would upon
[2:26:55] you and the rightness of that wood is
[2:26:57] brotherly kindness spirit of forgiveness
[2:26:59] which fear is based upon forgiveness
[2:27:01] that faith give you access right to the
[2:27:04] spirit
[2:27:05] there must be faith to access the spirit
[2:27:08] there must be sanctification to access
[2:27:10] the spirit and there must be worship to
[2:27:12] affect the spirit oh my oh hallelujah no
[2:27:16] worship no spirit no worship no
[2:27:18] atmosphere any church without worship
[2:27:20] they have no spirit I get because the
[2:27:22] Holy Spirit not coming down on dry you
[2:27:25] had to be atmosphere created for the
[2:27:28] whole way to meet that atmosphere so
[2:27:30] there were in the upper room praising
[2:27:32] and blessing God continually and in
[2:27:34] prison undressing God continually they
[2:27:36] were creating an atmosphere happy self
[2:27:39] worship then all of a sudden Buncombe
[2:27:42] the Holy Ghost to connect with an
[2:27:44] atmosphere and then each one del liquor
[2:27:47] fire or glory to God you just don't want
[2:27:50] to be in a fire
[2:27:51] you want your liquor you want to lick
[2:27:53] your lip music we're going with it
[2:27:55] that is your lick or give the Lord
[2:27:57] praises people
[2:27:59] you don't want to be in the church fire
[2:28:01] you want your look
[2:28:03] hallelujah your individual liqueur fire
[2:28:06] get your power over whatever you have to
[2:28:09] leave the power with all or either God
[2:28:11] so now D without let's not be perfect no
[2:28:15] the entire Holy Spirit visit the church
[2:28:17] making Gordon human flesh so that is
[2:28:20] what what I Branham came to represent
[2:28:22] the son of man revealing is son a man
[2:28:24] reveal and dishonor man it was the
[2:28:26] entire Holy Ghost embodied in this on a
[2:28:28] man that feel himself in the brother

[2:35:28] something is changing something is
[2:35:31] transforming or glory that God and you
[2:35:33] are being changed day by day you have
[2:35:36] been redeemed T by T or chlorine of God

[2:35:40] don't let the devil tell you nothing has
[2:35:42] that in you he has already stopped to
[2:35:43] work in you and he that start to work in
[2:35:46] you is able to complete it let the devil
[2:35:49] know even finish yet
[2:35:50] so tell him take a vacation and make a
[2:35:52] return at six months Oh glory to God
[2:35:55] dealing my time out o God have finished
[2:35:57] with you yet give the Lord a show
[2:36:00] oh my my mind hallelujah the token Jesus
[2:36:07] Christ the Holy Spirit is among us we
[2:36:09] should reverence that we should we can't
[2:36:11] humble ourselves enough taking off his
[2:36:12] shoes getting on your knees
[2:36:14] wouldn't expel it it wouldn't satisfy it
[2:36:16] wouldn't suffice us but the life that
[2:36:18] brings for the fruit of the Spirit and
[2:36:19] the fruit of the Spirit is joy love
[2:36:21] peace and so on he said know the law and
[2:36:23] the prophets were until John the
[2:36:24] scripture used on every man I saw on
[2:36:26] this in that time the kingdom of God is
[2:36:27] preached and every man presses into it a
[2:36:30] man presses into it listen not just
[2:36:33] simply walk into it so it means that
[2:36:35] just your attitude you need to adjust
[2:36:38] your attitude even your praying at home
[2:36:42] even a pray in your closet you need to
[2:36:44] adjust your attitude you see them kind
[2:36:46] of repeated prayer that you see in
[2:36:48] regular that's not good enough you have
[2:36:51] to begin to cry out and call upon God
[2:36:53] amen watch he said no he's not simply
[2:36:56] walking to it easily but it's got to be
[2:36:59] pressed in to see when you seek me with
[2:37:02] your heart all your heart cannot be
[2:37:04] found now desperations usually it takes
[2:37:07] a state of emergency to throw us into
[2:37:09] desperation it's too bad it has to do
[2:37:11] that but human beings are so slothful in
[2:37:14] their mind that it takes an emergency
[2:37:16] something arises and when they do it
[2:37:18] shows them into desperation and really
[2:37:21] in doing in desperation it brings out
[2:37:24] the real thing that you are it shows
[2:37:26] what you are made up of in a time of
[2:37:27] desperation it usually pulls out all the
[2:37:30] good things data in you in times of
[2:37:32] death are good people you know they were
[2:37:34] dying the things that are kept secret
[2:37:36] all their life and desperation they're
[2:37:37] trying to confess it trying to say take
[2:37:39] this and make it right and go please and
[2:37:41] desperation the author have done that
[2:37:42] beforehand not wait till a time of
[2:37:44] emergency will you do this for me
[2:37:46] so-and-so emergency causes desperation
[2:37:48] when we ought to do it without emergency
[2:37:50] isn't that right and they had to eat
[2:37:52] this Passover the shoes and the feet
[2:37:54] joins grid up staff near hand eating it
[2:37:56] in desperation they had seen the hand of
[2:37:58] God they seen all the miracles and then
[2:38:00] they come down under the sign of the
[2:38:01] token and while they were under the sign
[2:38:03] of the token they had to take the
[2:38:05] communion in desperation they all knew
[2:38:07] at that time God was fixing a strike in
[2:38:09] judgment it was a shaken time it was a
[2:38:11] time where every man was examining
[2:38:14] self because it happened just exactly
[2:38:16] the way he said it the tiller fire was
[2:38:18] still there the profit that our
[2:38:19] knowledge that God will only pass over
[2:38:21] when he saw the token at the door
[2:38:23] it was desperation oh my desperation
[2:38:26] something arise and it shows you that
[2:38:29] desperation isn't that right
[2:38:31] lest had been another Lord I could
[2:38:32] imagine the children when they saw those
[2:38:34] big black wings dropped down from the
[2:38:36] sky the screams come from every house
[2:38:38] the Chairman I went to the Dahlia said
[2:38:39] daddy are you sure we are under the
[2:38:42] token and he could do he could go to the
[2:38:44] door and look up on the post and lintels
[2:38:46] his son that's according to his word
[2:38:48] remember I'm your oldest child Addie are
[2:38:51] you positive
[2:38:52] I am positive I am doing a corner where
[2:38:55] the Prophet told us to do when I see the
[2:38:57] blood I'm gonna pass it well daddy why
[2:38:59] are you got your shoes on why you have
[2:39:01] your stuff on your hand
[2:39:02] why you got the piece of bread in one
[2:39:03] hand and lamb in the other hand why then
[2:39:06] Peter heard some things what are you
[2:39:07] eating it he's a dead son debt is fixin
[2:39:10] to strike with the Swift why the sweat
[2:39:13] runnin on your face
[2:39:14] debt is fixing the strike it was a time
[2:39:16] of desperation and since the message
[2:39:18] this morning from God not me I believe
[2:39:20] it ought to show the entire congregation
[2:39:22] at the desperation we have played long
[2:39:24] enough when it's just long enough we
[2:39:26] have got to do something
[2:39:27] desperation signs of his coming should
[2:39:30] throw every member of Christ in the
[2:39:32] desperation now what about our souls
[2:39:33] well what are we going to among two if
[2:39:36] we gain the whole world what are we
[2:39:37] living for what do you work for what are
[2:39:39] you eating for what are you struggling
[2:39:41] for to live what are you living for to
[2:39:43] die you're not fit to live unless you're
[2:39:45] fit to die and I believe the reason we
[2:39:48] don't have the desperation is because
[2:39:50] the lack of love God the love of God I
[2:39:52] think the love of God causes desperation
[2:39:55] if God is in you the total inside of you
[2:39:57] you see the condition of times people
[2:39:59] within and sin the way they are it shows
[2:40:01] you in the desperation oh my hallelujah
[2:40:05] God can't change time changes but he's
[2:40:08] the unchangeable God with an
[2:40:10] unchangeable message it can be sucked
[2:40:11] for creats it can't be struck for the
[2:40:13] national standards the even time message
[2:40:15] is to apply the token oh my do you love
[2:40:18] him
[2:40:19] let's continue but a random here's a
[2:40:21] question that been puzzling to several
[2:40:23] of us pardon me on some tips please xt8
[2:40:25] explain fully about the Gentiles that
[2:40:27] don't go in the rapture I thought you
[2:40:29] said the Gentiles our left went to the
[2:40:32] tribulation and give their lives for a
[2:40:34] testimony of Jesus when it returns on
[2:40:36] the Gentiles to the Jews he turns it
[2:40:38] from the Gentiles to the Jews then there
[2:40:39] isn't any more chance for the Gentiles
[2:40:41] being safe just the Gentiles who are
[2:40:43] being saved but not receive this last
[2:40:46] the truth will go in tribulation period
[2:40:47] and then receive an EM is that right
[2:40:50] please explain because you said there
[2:40:53] would be a small number go in the
[2:40:54] rapture what about the people that
[2:40:56] believe in the Lord now and don't
[2:40:59] believe the way you preach for this em
[2:41:01] time message will they receive and the
[2:41:04] person sign your name whatever our minds
[2:41:06] a very good question the first place the
[2:41:08] confusion is what I've said about the
[2:41:09] Gentiles being done with you in the
[2:41:11] tribulation no I do not see the Gentile
[2:41:14] bride the Gentile church now the dented
[2:41:18] church here we go
[2:41:19] we'll go to the tribulation but the
[2:41:22] bride is the elected they go true
[2:41:25] nothing but the rapture they are just
[2:41:27] changed and taken out of the world oh
[2:41:30] praise God this is my own thoughts nor
[2:41:33] minister bridge in my own way I feel the
[2:41:35] spirit revealed to me the next thing has
[2:41:37] to happen the Gentile elected bride is
[2:41:40] to be caught up with the rest of the
[2:41:42] Gentile elected by dumb to the ages
[2:41:43] caught up in the presence of Christ
[2:41:46] so the sleepin bride caught up with the
[2:41:48] Living bride and then the dead raises
[2:41:52] the ones that are alive and remain has
[2:41:54] changed they are caught up together to
[2:41:56] meet the Lord in the air and after the
[2:41:58] wedding ceremony in glory Jesus that was
[2:42:01] caught up in the skies return to the
[2:42:02] earth and makes himself known to his
[2:42:04] people
[2:42:05] a type of Joseph make himself known to
[2:42:08] his brothers his wife no Gentile was
[2:42:11] present nobody was Joseph alone Meagan's
[2:42:13] have known to the Brethren
[2:42:15] his wife was in the palace type of the
[2:42:17] bride would be in a palace in glory at
[2:42:19] that time oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:42:22] do you love him oh no the Gentile bride
[2:42:24] is in heaven the sleepin virgin the
[2:42:27] Gentile religion is not to be saved
[2:42:28] during that time she is already saved
[2:42:32] but has been rejected in the bribe she
[2:42:35] only goes to the tribulation period for
[2:42:38] the time of purification because she has
[2:42:41] rejected Christ the word for her
[2:42:44] purification then she has to suffer for
[2:42:47] her deeds but the bride who has become
[2:42:50] the world
[2:42:51] oh my so the church reject Christ the
[2:42:56] word but the bride becomes the word
[2:42:58] accomplished the autonomous myth of
[2:43:00] Christ because he is the word oh praise
[2:43:03] God so my my mind so when the soldier
[2:43:07] pushed a spear up his side the blood
[2:43:09] came forth he was already dead she was
[2:43:12] already redeemed in his body by his debt
[2:43:14] there is no more suffering tribulation
[2:43:17] for the bride oh praise the name of the
[2:43:20] Lord do you love him next question if
[2:43:23] the church is saved even though she does
[2:43:26] not go in the rapture as I believe you
[2:43:28] taught she must go to the tribulation
[2:43:30] for purifying but what about these other
[2:43:32] dead how will they purified the bride
[2:43:35] don't need no purification
[2:43:36] she already purify those that are dead
[2:43:38] back there they never receive the light
[2:43:40] like the church had received they lived
[2:43:42] true justification sonication the living
[2:43:44] like that they had but no are you ready
[2:43:46] in this rapture in time like this they
[2:43:51] will have to come a time that this bride
[2:43:54] that rejects the head part of the bride
[2:43:57] what do you mean to say that the church
[2:43:59] that reject the head part of the bride
[2:44:02] will have to suffer a rejection because
[2:44:05] the gospel was made plain to them back
[2:44:09] there like his made plain to you today
[2:44:11] you have examples the sieves are open
[2:44:14] the church age later everything like
[2:44:16] that you can't miss it
[2:44:17] so everything will be finished for the
[2:44:22] Gentile church when the bride is taken
[2:44:24] from the earth the Spirit of God leaves
[2:44:27] the earth he was filthy filthy still he
[2:44:30] was righteous and righteous still his
[2:44:33] whole is holy still in other words the
[2:44:37] sanctuary becomes smoky and the attorney
[2:44:40] stands to Peter case Christ leave the
[2:44:43] sanctuary his days
[2:44:44] of material workers over the rapture
[2:44:47] comes leaves on the sanctuary he goes
[2:44:50] forth
[2:44:51] takes the book of Redemption claims
[2:44:53] everything that he's the Redeem here we
[2:44:56] go
[2:44:56] no she wanted Church now she will have
[2:45:00] to go to the church and period and the
[2:45:03] reason of it is because she has rejected
[2:45:07] the atonement in his fullness so no but
[2:45:10] a Branham is bringing a different
[2:45:12] category to identify this potent as the
[2:45:15] blood it's rich over now to the fullness
[2:45:18] of the atonement that means you can
[2:45:20] accept the atonement but not the
[2:45:22] fullness of it the fullness gonna be all
[2:45:24] the world and through adoption
[2:45:25] perfection seven thunders seven seas the
[2:45:28] whole whole scroll so God want you to
[2:45:31] accept the fullness of the world which
[2:45:33] is the fullness of the appointment
[2:45:35] isn't that right praise be to Jesus
[2:45:39] oh my skip down a little bit where Bram
[2:45:42] says okay that doesn't change do nothing
[2:45:45] down man but change is well in place
[2:45:47] doesn't change your nature doesn't
[2:45:49] change your fate doesn't change nothing
[2:45:52] but you're done in place if your doctor
[2:45:53] this morning on God's Word you get out
[2:45:55] over there
[2:45:56] I'd like your whole-- you are how you
[2:45:58] live how you could you live wouldn't
[2:45:59] change you one bit to die just as well
[2:46:01] in please if you can't accept the whole
[2:46:03] Word of God the way it's written you
[2:46:05] won't do it there so don't worry it
[2:46:06] won't be there here we go you have got
[2:46:08] to accept it in its fullness in the
[2:46:12] power of his vindication and the
[2:46:14] revelation of what it is then you become
[2:46:17] part of it you can't know the words say
[2:46:20] to dress modestly and you're not just in
[2:46:21] the monastic you can't know the word
[2:46:23] saying don't cut to here and you're
[2:46:24] cutting here you can't know the word
[2:46:26] save the treat your wife right and
[2:46:28] you're not she's my wife right
[2:46:31] Oh hallelujah you've got to accept it in
[2:46:36] his fullness of his revelation and his
[2:46:40] vindication and then you become part of
[2:46:42] it it becomes part of you
[2:46:44] you become one with it it becomes your
[2:46:46] message it becomes your anointing it
[2:46:49] becomes your word Oh glory the car do
[2:46:51] you love him tonight
[2:46:52] Oh glory to God so don't turn down the
[2:46:56] blood that's the better were speaking on
[2:46:58] this morning no praise but hallelujah so
[2:47:01] but a Brandon brought the fullness of
[2:47:03] the atonement which is the blood and
[2:47:05] that fullness of the torment is what she
[2:47:08] looses the Holy Spirit which is the
[2:47:10] seven pattern eater of God seven perfect
[2:47:13] spirits seven manifestation of one Holy
[2:47:15] Spirit even elohim himself he has seeded
[2:47:19] you don't with Lewis would I know the
[2:47:20] spirit he have cereal with locust wood
[2:47:23] and no seven perfect spirits seven
[2:47:26] manifestations of the Holy Spirit coming
[2:47:28] on to pick up that glucose wood inside
[2:47:30] your soul now he could be changed and
[2:47:32] transformed into the wood image oh
[2:47:34] praise God he said the Holy Ghost was
[2:47:37] born at a river Euphrates but the end
[2:47:39] time message is to loose the Holy Ghost
[2:47:41] so first God loosed the Holy Ghost in
[2:47:43] the form of promises that by these
[2:47:46] promises you can become practical of the
[2:47:48] divine nature because God and you man
[2:47:50] with power you have to get him character
[2:47:52] so he lose promises to see how you
[2:47:53] interact with your promises how did
[2:47:57] Abraham reactors promise he staggered
[2:48:00] not at the promise of God but was fully
[2:48:04] persuaded that what God promised he was
[2:48:06] able to perform so he had faith for
[2:48:09] himself and yet fear forever for for 0ho
[2:48:12] give the law some praises people Abraham
[2:48:15] had a fear for himself and for his wife

[3:00:41] media was coming in to Jordan looked
[3:00:42] like I was done in a map of Palestine
[3:00:44] seemed I could hear this song I'm going

[3:01:01] and the promised land then as I set
[3:01:04] there a little bit and share all of a
[3:01:06] sudden here comes back again I knew I
[3:01:08] was in a vision when I come into the
[3:01:10] vision again it seemed that I was lifted
[3:01:13] up set it on a highway
[3:01:15] now our highway with some brother I
[3:01:17] never knew who the better was I look
[3:01:20] around I said I'm sure unnoticed as a
[3:01:23] vision the Lord God is here it seemed
[3:01:26] like everybody was afraid what is
[3:01:28] everybody so afraid of and a voice came
[3:01:31] and said there's such danger in these
[3:01:33] days there's a great hideous thing that
[3:01:36] is dead when it strikes you I heard a
[3:01:40] wheat smashing down and I looked and
[3:01:41] there come a huge monster slink crawl
[3:01:45] into the weeds I thought no no this is a
[3:01:48] vision then I see the animal of this
[3:01:51] beast is he call up the highway and as
[3:01:53] soon as I got sight of him I knew it was
[3:01:55] a member now a Mamba is an African snake
[3:01:59] which is the most deadly bite of all
[3:02:02] things there is there is nothing as
[3:02:05] poison as a Mamba the snake of course
[3:02:08] represent death and sin

[3:02:13] other kind of snakes if you embattled I
[3:02:15] won't bite you it will kill you but if

[3:02:20] were in Africa and India I'm flying the
[3:02:21] Cobra is a black Cobra he's a bad snake
[3:02:23] he's a dead bite too
[3:02:25] there's a yellow called Cobra far beyond
[3:02:27] him and yellow Cobra the patient dies at
[3:02:29] a horrible death died from suffocation
[3:02:30] it paralyzed the breathing system they
[3:02:33] can't read then comes the Mamba he is
[3:02:37] dead he is so fast you can't see him he
[3:02:40] goes over the top of the weeds and
[3:02:41] propels himself with a black of a steel
[3:02:43] and just like that he's gone hits you in
[3:02:46] the face usually stands up high and
[3:02:48] strikes hard when he hits you you got a
[3:02:50] few breaths to your finish it don't only
[3:02:52] paralyze and get in your bloodstream it
[3:02:54] get nerves everything your dying seconds
[3:02:56] then native boys and track boys you can
[3:02:58] say Mamba and they will put their heads
[3:03:00] together screaming cause I know he's
[3:03:02] dead in a few seconds when one hits you
[3:03:04] and here he was on the highway and I
[3:03:07] thought well this is it so I looked at
[3:03:09] him he looked angry at me he licked his
[3:03:11] stone and here he come the man becoming
[3:03:13] too much the Prophet now and when he got
[3:03:16] close to me he run up fast when he got
[3:03:19] he would get slower and slower and then
[3:03:21] quiver and stop and then something would
[3:03:24] hold him off
[3:03:26] he couldn't bite me what was the thing
[3:03:30] that he had the token he had the
[3:03:33] presence of God around him Mamba
[3:03:35] comments speeding and slowing down
[3:03:37] thrown on and I saw this stuff
[3:03:39] watch this he turned on the other side
[3:03:43] tried to approach from the other side so
[3:03:45] the man was given up he thought was this
[3:03:47] side ha d-block
[3:03:48] see trying to make say he would get back
[3:03:52] starts wish towards me gets flowing slow
[3:03:54] and then stop the shake unguent shake

[3:04:16] tracking him like that I taught my hand
[3:04:17] say Oh God have mercy on my brother it
