[44:28] chapter 7 Thank You musicians
[44:48] easycap chapter 9 reading from verse 1
[44:50] to 6 revelation 7 read verse 1 to 4 we
[44:55] didn't Ezekiel chapter 9 verse 1 he
[45:00] cried also in mine ears with a loud
[45:02] voice saying caused him to have charged
[45:05] over the city to john near even every
[45:09] man with his destroying weapon in his
[45:11] hand and behold six men came from the
[45:14] way of the higher gate which led towards
[45:16] the north and every man a slaughter
[45:19] weapon in his hand and one man among
[45:22] them was clothed with linen with a
[45:25] writer's inkhorn by his side and they
[45:28] went in and stood beside the brazen
[45:31] altar and the glory of the God of Israel
[45:35] was gone up from the cherub whereupon he
[45:37] was to the threshold of the house and he
[45:41] called to the man clothed with linen
[45:43] which had the writers ink one by his
[45:46] side and the Lord said unto him go to
[45:50] the midst of the city through the midst
[45:53] of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[45:57] foreheads of the men that sigh and cry
[46:01] for all the abominations that be done in
[46:04] the midst thereof and the others he said
[46:08] in my hearing go ye after him through
[46:11] the city and smite let not your eyes
[46:13] spear neither heavy pity slay utterly
[46:18] all and young both maids little children
[46:22] and woman but come not near any man upon
[46:27] whom is the mark and begin at my
[46:30] sanctuary then they began at the ancient
[46:33] men which were before the house
[46:37] Revelation chapter 7 when I read from
[46:40] verse 1 and after these things I saw
[46:43] four angels standing on the four corners
[46:45] of the earth holding the four winds of
[46:48] the earth that the wind should not blow
[46:50] on the earth nor on the scene on any
[46:53] tree I saw another angel ascending
[46:58] from the east having the seal of the
[47:01] Living God and he cried with a loud
[47:04] voice to the four angels to whom it was
[47:07] given to hurt the earth and the sea
[47:09] saying hurt not the earth needless sea
[47:13] nor the trees till we have sealed the
[47:17] servants of our God in their foreheads
[47:19] and I heard the number of them which
[47:22] were sealed and they were sealed
[47:24] a hundred and forty-four thousand of all
[47:27] the tribes of the Chilam Balam
[47:29] may God bless his word you may be seated
[47:33] oh praise the name of the Lord oh thank
[47:42] you lord well have a title this morning
[47:46] and the title is the angel having the
[47:50] seal of the Living God that's a title of
[47:55] a subject the seal of God and an
[47:59] inspiration crying and sighin
[48:03] that's my inspiration crying and sigh
[48:06] now we know 1933 God give the Prophet
[48:09] seven visions which he says must come to
[48:13] pass before the coming of the Lord and
[48:17] the fifth vision he said science will
[48:21] progress in such a way until they will
[48:24] make a car that will not have to be
[48:26] guided by a steering wheel and the cars
[48:30] will continue to be shaped like an egg
[48:32] until the consummation the end time I
[48:36] seen American family going on the road
[48:39] in a broad way rising in a car with
[48:43] their backs turn towards where a wheel
[48:46] should be look like they were playing
[48:48] checkers or cards and so on like that
[48:51] and then the six he said I saw a woman
[48:54] stand up beautiful looking just in a
[48:57] high royal purple
[48:59] I got a parenthesis here she was a great
[49:02] ruler in United States and he has
[49:04] perhaps the Catholic Church a woman some
[49:06] woman
[49:07] I know this is a woman's nation this
[49:09] nation is number thirteen and prophecy
[49:12] she's got thirteen stripes thirteen
[49:13] stars she started thirteen colonies
[49:15] thirteen everything is thirteen and it
[49:17] and it appears in the thirteenth chapter
[49:19] of Revelation she's 13 she's a woman's
[49:21] nation and now for the last vision he
[49:27] says now then I turn and I looked and I
[49:30] saw this United States burning like a
[49:34] smaller rocks had been blown up it was
[49:38] burning like a heap of fire in logs or
[49:41] something just set it afire and look as
[49:44] far as I could see she has been blown up
[49:48] and then the vision left me five out of
[49:52] tree has happened or 707 has happened
[49:56] and so on so this was the vision that
[49:59] the prophet have and we hadn't long
[50:02] known to that vision we know what man
[50:06] has built will produce that vision with
[50:08] Atomics and everything else so her
[50:11] message lunacy contempt for defeat he
[50:14] said notice let's get back to kena again
[50:16] let's get back to some faith in the
[50:17] beginning watch those spirits how do you
[50:20] begin to move it's the spirit of
[50:23] anything that does the work of it anyhow
[50:26] so it's not just the thing is the spirit
[50:30] behind this thing there's a spirit in
[50:32] your home there's a spirit in this
[50:34] church there's a spirit of motivate in
[50:36] your life this is a spirit behind the
[50:38] same and that's why you have to get into
[50:40] the right spirit that it could work
[50:42] correctly for you not just teens but the
[50:46] spirit behind it and you have to know
[50:48] what spirit is behind operating behind
[50:50] you could we say Amen
[50:52] the people here we go have got to be in
[50:56] this kind of a spirit to bring the
[51:00] latter days so the latter days is a
[51:02] spirit that's why Jesus said as it was
[51:06] in the days of nor as it was in the days
[51:09] of Sodom so will it be
[51:12] because a spirit atmosphere was there
[51:14] and he is saying to them that spirit
[51:16] must make one to come back
[51:18] hallelujah to bring that prophecy to
[51:21] pass or glory to God listen this bride
[51:24] will not feel this bride will not fall
[51:28] display understand because this bride
[51:31] will have a spirit which is the spirit
[51:35] which is the Holy Spirit this is what
[51:38] what promise
[51:38] I feel confident of these promises that
[51:42] the Prophet spoke we are resting on it
[51:45] Oh glory that God do believe that so the
[51:50] people have to be in this kind of a
[51:53] spirit to bring the latter days the
[51:55] people in the spirit of the latter days
[51:58] the nations are in the spirit of the end
[52:01] time the God atomic weapons hydrogen
[52:03] weapons all kind of things because it's
[52:05] the spirit of the day and the people are
[52:07] in the spirit of the end time and the
[52:09] church is moving together under the
[52:12] power and impact of the holy spirit so
[52:14] what are you saying if outside is moving
[52:16] in their spirit you have to move under
[52:19] the impact of the Holy Ghost you have to
[52:22] move under your anointing or glory lagar
[52:27] some a stop in a minute I believe the
[52:31] people are in the preparation for the
[52:34] last great destruction this world will
[52:37] ever know
[52:38] I believe we are the endtime you can
[52:41] speak to people you could put a Billy
[52:43] Graham in every city in the United
[52:45] States they will drink whiskey they
[52:46] smoke cigarettes laugh at you and
[52:48] everything else they are in the spirit
[52:50] of the last days no hear this God cannot
[52:55] send destruction before the people are
[52:58] in the spirit for destruction God will
[53:01] never destroy anything man destroys
[53:03] himself so the world has got to get in
[53:06] the spirit of the last days before the
[53:08] last days can come and we in the spirit
[53:11] of the last days so the bride before
[53:13] anything could happen the pride of the
[53:15] get in the spirit or do you believe that
[53:17] for glory let God
[53:20] because revelation 7 says stop the winds
[53:23] stop the wars stop everything because

[53:59] the Jews until you get your promise
[54:04] the customer can go back to the Jews
[54:06] until the Gentiles is over so you cut
[54:10] the B's yield and the fact that the

[2:04:05] moment the solemnity that you would now
[2:04:07] send the holy spirit that made them
[2:04:09] raise their hands and see them for my
[2:04:11] life of sin so here you bring a
[2:04:13] description in prayer about the Holy
[2:04:16] Spirit about the almost burnt out and

[2:05:00] was a cry made behold abram cometh go

[2:05:04] arose trim their lamps the foolish said
[2:05:06] to the wise give us of your oil for our
[2:05:08] lamps are going out but the wise
[2:05:11] answered saying not so least there'd be
[2:05:13] not enough for us and you but go ye
[2:05:16] rather to them that sell and buy for
[2:05:18] yourselves
[2:05:20] viola went to buy the bridegroom came
[2:05:22] and d-double ready went in with him to
[2:05:25] the marriage and the door was shut

[2:06:58] let things rise up and put business in
[2:07:00] your soul no matter how bad anyone ever
[2:07:03] treats you don't never don't be guilty

[2:07:21] will remain a human's purchase the
[2:07:22] business making a bitterness baby
[2:07:32] so watch he's talking about watch know
[2:07:36] there's 144,000 Israel that's waiting
[2:07:38] for the coming of the Lord and kind of
[2:07:40] go in until the Gentiles are finished
[2:07:43] it's got to be finished so we're I'm
[2:07:47] said I taught to be wonderful he wanted
[2:07:49] to go to Israel himself he said I my
[2:07:51] ticket in my hand about 30 minutes
[2:07:53] before call in the Arabian plane line I
[2:07:55] was standing out here in Cairo Egypt
[2:07:57] I taught priests got in tomorrow as the
[2:07:59] Jews will receive the same thing that
[2:08:01] there are Pentecost just as sure as
[2:08:03] anything I thought if I stand here and
[2:08:05] tell them go pick us out a bunch of men
[2:08:07] out among you and bring them here then
[2:08:09] see we still Messiah then they were
[2:08:11] saying no upon the same grounds of your
[2:08:13] forefathers rejected the Messiah you
[2:08:15] receive him you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:08:16] and then we will evangelize the world
[2:08:18] something struck me and said do not go
[2:08:21] now for the hour is not yet the Gentiles
[2:08:27] isn't fulfilled yet daddy isn't finished
[2:08:32] oh I thought that was just me so I
[2:08:35] started again it got so bad and I just
[2:08:37] couldn't stand it I went out behind a
[2:08:39] hanger ball my head I said father is
[2:08:41] that you speaking to me he said do not
[2:08:44] go to Israel now the hour is not yet I
[2:08:47] went in and changed my ticket rotated
[2:08:50] again the other way see cause the always
[2:08:52] not yet but one of these days the
[2:08:55] message will go to Israel and God will
[2:08:58] send them Moses and Elijah in revelation
[2:09:01] 11 and they will do signs and wonders
[2:09:04] and over sign why the Gentile is
[2:09:06] finished the day of grace will leave the
[2:09:08] Gentile church the Pentecostal age would
[2:09:11] leave no these wise virgins oil in the
[2:09:15] Bible similar Holy Spirit we all know
[2:09:17] that and we are known the sacred oil or
[2:09:19] symbolize Holy Spirit so they were ready
[2:09:21] to go in at the wedding supper and we
[2:09:23] could go back in Ezekiel 9 and so forth
[2:09:26] now this version is a
[2:09:29] this was a foolish version this was a
[2:09:30] wise version and virgin means sanctified
[2:09:33] and clean if there was some way I could
[2:09:36] just make the people see it just burns
[2:09:39] in my soul these churches are clean and
[2:09:42] holy as this one if all a virgin's
[2:09:45] they're all virgins just clean the only
[2:09:48] difference was oil in the lamp the Holy
[2:09:50] Ghost and the Holy Ghost if it's in
[2:09:53] there it produced a very same kind of
[2:09:56] fire it did on Pentecost but they don't
[2:09:59] have no fire no oil in the lamp
[2:10:01] they have chose rituals just just a
[2:10:04] ritual fine ceremonies not against it
[2:10:07] Cree's that shake a conscience and songs
[2:10:09] like angel singing but you could put and
[2:10:12] you can't put your finger on your life
[2:10:13] you couldn't do it but that's still
[2:10:16] wrong it is part of it but not all of it
[2:10:19] that's the kind of misses the rapture
[2:10:22] clean people nice people but there's no
[2:10:26] hunger and there's no science there's no
[2:10:29] crime there's no holy spirit we read the
[2:10:32] other night these people will not be an
[2:10:34] organization there will be Wanderers
[2:10:36] along the land dwelling in tents poor
[2:10:38] and humble don't you try to curse them
[2:10:40] because I'm with them these people
[2:10:42] believe the same ritual they believe in
[2:10:43] what did the same God see but they
[2:10:46] didn't have someone who's following them
[2:10:47] Israel had a brass serpent smitten rock
[2:10:50] the chore of the King divine healing
[2:10:52] prophets they were dear with a blessing
[2:10:53] the same thing with the sleep and
[2:10:55] religion and the wise version you were
[2:10:57] both sanctified people this one had oil
[2:10:59] this one did not have oil they said we
[2:11:02] are just as good as you were there's
[2:11:04] none of us good as far as I'm concerned
[2:11:05] you're a bunch of holy rollers they had
[2:11:07] wakened but when they did this one could
[2:11:10] go in because they had oil in their
[2:11:12] lamps that was the difference this one
[2:11:15] could go in there was no ordinary lamp
[2:11:17] they went back to pray up to receive the
[2:11:19] Holy Ghost
[2:11:19] there were matter what pray up to
[2:11:22] receive the Holy Ghost but while they
[2:11:24] were gone it was all over yes the
[2:11:27] sleeping virgin this sleepin virgin now
[2:11:29] you want to know what would become of
[2:11:31] her watch they create tribulation they
[2:11:34] will have to go true no let me get the
[2:11:37] rest of that they were casting out of
[2:11:38] darkness where there was weeping
[2:11:40] and we'll in the national teeth or
[2:11:42] praise the name of the Lord
[2:11:44] so watch these two spirits working
[2:11:47] almost alike right down here now
[2:11:50] one is the denomination the other one is
[2:11:52] the Holy Ghost and Jesus said they will
[2:11:54] be so close that they would receive the
[2:11:57] very elected as possible these here we
[2:12:00] go are you ready are you listening these
[2:12:03] two spirits are marking their people for
[2:12:07] future judgments so you are being marked

[2:12:25] when put that match up on you nobody

[2:12:49] prophecy of this book and then he said

[2:13:28] a knock don't you compromise with

[2:13:33] Holy Ghost like they caught at Pentecost
[2:13:35] Oh glory that God with the same type of
[2:13:38] what about this and everything else oh
[2:13:39] brother

[2:14:09] blessings that they might receive a
[2:14:11] ministry of testimony like lot hat like
[2:14:13] Noah had like Jesus had on to the
[2:14:16] eternal laws if it be here that they
[2:14:19] themselves are sealed into the kingdom
[2:14:21] of God but given witness to Jesus Christ
