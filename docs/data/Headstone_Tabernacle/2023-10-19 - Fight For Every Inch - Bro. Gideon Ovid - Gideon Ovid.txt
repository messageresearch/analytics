we serve as we just switch over now thank you brother Steven amen hallelujah Glory just want to share a brief thought with you tonight and before I begin I just want to thank God for this opportunity to be able to to speak to this portion of the bride of Christ amen my my my my the devil is defeated tonight something good is about to happen I'm under expectation I'm excited I know that we didn't gather in vain and I know nothing happens by chance Hallelujah glory glory amen Glory Hallelujah so I I just want to start and and and we see what the Lord will do amen hallelujah Glory I think I want to start from a title you know the title tonight is fight for every inch so we in a battling mode right think we are called to fight for every in ground and as an inspiration the battle is the Lord's sir wonder it doesn't give an excuse for us not to fight but we have to be conscious and aware that the battle is the Lord's it's not by your might and your strength and your thoughts and ideas but he has prescribed certain things for us to do he has certain Rules by which we must operate but we have to do the fighting we need to fight for every inch of ground we need to fight to claim every promise that he has set forth in front of us everything that he has promised us in this end time we have to fight it's not going to fall in our laps and and and happen by chance but we have to fight amen if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn with me to the Book of Joshua I'm reading just two verses there Joshua 1: 3 and 4 very familiar scripture and it says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses and in verse four it says from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be a coast amen amen let's just bow heads oh heavenly father as we read your scripture we pray that you would breath life into it Lord Lord any man could read the words and we could read it in English and Spanish and French and what whatever language we choose to translate Lord Lord but it really takes a divine revelation to come and Inspire to our hearts Lord Lord I pray that you Quicken your words tonight I pray that you you would take me out of the way Lord and you'll use me as a vessel to speak to your people I pray that lives will be changed and transformed that there's not just a a a formality that we come to church and we go back home but we come and experience a a reality in your presence tonight Lord Lord I pray that you would unravel our minds un loose our hearts Lord Lord that we will walk out here Lord so burdened knowing that we're so much closer to where you want us to be Lord Lord I pray that you'll Quicken our hearts Quicken our our minds Lord that we be open to receive and and you would speak lip to air to your people tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats GL amen you know I always say I could never get accustomed to this and I have no message of my own but by God's grace I'm going to deliver the message I have here amen and just to bring a context I know the title I said was fight for every inch and it sounds almost cliche it's something that we familiar hearing familiar with and and something that we say from time to time that we got to fight and and it sounds sometimes even normal that we need to fight because we've called we've been called to battle we've been called to fight and sometimes I think God takes the simple and he opens it a little more once you dig a Little Deeper so four simple words fight for every inch what does it mean what are we really called to do who are we fighting how are we fighting what's the ammunition what's the opposition what's the territory what's the terrain why we fighting what we fighting towards how do we know when when when when when the the fight is concluded and we win and we B and the battle has ended amen so we just want to delve into this a little bit and I pray that that bless your amen so I'm a kind of guy I like facts I like things declared I like things very very plain right I don't like to have to worry about it too much I like when God could speak and you see it clearly you don't have to try to figure it out too much and sometime he speaks like that and when I looked at this fighting for every inch it it almost troubled me a little bit fight fight What does fight mean who is to fight how do we fight how do we really manage this and by definition I had to go research it I'm hearing almost like an echo to the front and it says to fight according to the dictionary it says to take part in a violent struggle involving the exchange of physical blows or the use of weapons that's one definition a next definition said struggle to overcome eliminate or prevent that's what it means to fight amen the third definition I found it says a violent confrontation or struggle amen then it occurred to me as I read them over and over trying to make sure I have a sound understanding of this fight I noticed there was one consistent word in each definition and that was struggle so it's very clear that there's no fight by chance you do have easy fight and you just wake up and you win it don't work like that it requires something it means you have a part to play you have a role to play you have something to do you have some opposition to face you will get resistance and because of that you will face some pressure but guess what before the foundation of the world God has prepared you for the battle amen the battle is the Lord's but you have to fight amen so as I studied and I looked and I I I tried to figure this out and I said you know what I must see parallels elsewhere we have lots of parallels in the scripture and I was speaking to a friend recently and he's a tailor and he makes suits and he makes clothes and he designs and he went to the UK and he learned how to do it and the term they use in that industry is bespoke and what that means is that it's customized it's made for you so you don't go on the rack and pick it up you don't go to the store and buy it they make it just for you so I went and I found the definition of bspoke and bspoke said a product made specially according to the needs of an individual customer so tonight I want to tell you that your trials your battles your fights your struggles are bespoke they're customized to youall if I take your your battle I might fail it but God in his wisdom he has customized trials for you to bring out of you what he want to get out of you he knows exactly what to do and how to do it he knows exactly what you need to pass through that's why the songwriter said some through the water some through the some through great trials all through the blood because he knows exactly what you have to pass through to build the character that he wants to see at the end at the end of the pipe when you go through and you come out the other side he knows what he wants to come out of that side and I thought about it and I say you know how wonderful how marvelous how marvelous it is that of the 8 billion or so persons on the earth everybody has an individual fingerprint no two persons have the same you could be identical twins but no two persons have the same fingerprint just like that he has your trial specifically designed for you now I'm not here to frighten you I'm not here to to kill your joy and make you feel we just talking about trials and bad things and and and things that you have to face but this is reality this is the word now yes sir I'm not making it up amen so because he customized the trial for you he had to give you the resources to overcome them amen amen amen yes sir GL he's never lost a battle he select individuals to accomplish particular things because he know they can yes throughout scripture when you study the scripture sometime we call them Heroes of Faith right but when you look at individual activity you will see these trials were customized there a reason Samson was who he was where he was at that time amen there's a reason Joseph was who he was at that time when David went it wasn't by chance he went to drop food for his brothers there was something specific that he had to do at that time but as a context before doing that he was given the tools the resources in order to face that adversity to face that challenge so often times I say you know where we are now is the sum total of all the experiences we've been through but think about God that's in my finite mind God predestinated you he knew you would be here tonight he knew the challenges we will have outside and he selected you to be in this service whether live whether online whether you see it right now or tomorrow he knew you would see he knew you would hear the words that I'm speaking right now and he still chose you he still went past your family background and the challenges you had to come to come to S service to transport issues whatever challenges you had in your life however you feel you arrived here tonight he already saw this happening and as a result he would have passed you through things and given you tools but often times when the challenge comes we tend to be apprehensive we want to back away and we want to pray at that point that God send this challenge to somebody else when your challenges be spoke when your challenges customized to you listen when I read that scripture earlier he talk about from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites it was very very specific he said the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun amen shall be a coast so what God was doing there now he spoke to Moses he was telling Joshua at this point that these are the boundaries yes this is the inheritance I set out for you Hallelujah and we'll tie it all together but it's very important when you're going and fight that that that you know what you're fighting for that you know where your boundaries are think about a land dispute when you come with the deed and you look at it you look at the deed and it doesn't say one pastel a land in Grande it do say that it will say bounded by Mr John L on the West Side bounded by Frankland Sheila land Laura land on north south east west so this part bounded by that is yours now when God defines things he don't redefine it he tell you the river here the coast here this is where it is when you think of Abraham he said listen look this way you see that to this side across here so he by definition was very very specific very clear why he don't want you fight in the wrong battle righten amen if you don't know where your land is if you don't know where your boundaries are then you may find you're fighting your neighbor unjustly true and when you lose the battle now you say but oh God I was fighting I was defending but you was fighting the wrong fight you know often time they say a by fight that's not your your your fight don't get involved in that but God was very specific he said listen I told Moses this already so I want to tell you again so I reiterating the boundary is not going to change it's from here to here here today so guess what he's done this before and he do it again so what he said he said listen in times pass I said this but here what I want to tell you I'm the same yesterday today and forever the boundary is not going on change healing is still yours Deliverance is still yours the Holy Ghost is still yours I mean adoption Perfection Deliverance you name it is still yours the definition of going and change it's up to you to fight for it because this is your inheritance this is your promise this is promise to you it's not going to be given to you not handed to you on your lap but you have to fight for it but I have defined this is for you this is yours from here to here from here to there and once you can understand that you know you're battlegr you're defending every inch once the enemy even look like he looking over your fence you're fighting because that's yours all right so healing is yours tonight you don't need to wait till tomorrow your marriage is yours your relationship is yours your finan is yours whatever he promised you is yours so you have to be able to claim that recognize it identify it and fight for it because he promised that but you know what the battle is the Lord's so he not going to send you to fight just by yourself and say well go ahead now fix up no most times you know what he does he wins the battle ahead of time and he go through through the motions he tell you look in David's case he know golad coming you know he say let me send a bear manage that pass that test Mr alion pass that test because golad coming because he know golad coming he have to train so he have to train you he have to carry you through things that may be uncomfortable he have to have people give you resist and opposition he have to have you wondering how I going to make it through boy but an he brought you through last time so what you think going un Change this time Hallelujah the same God but he want to reach a level of maturity where you could trust him where you can have faith in him where you could depend on him this is where these guys reach when they listen they had such a confidence he say listen you just go you fight you'll get the victory all you have to do is fight you couldn't sit down and drink coffee and say listen we are the chosen generation God told us we have an inheritance you know no inheritance for them know he say every place the soul of your foot shall tread upon that is what is yours so I have identified what it is but you still have a responsibility you still have something to do very very specifically amen so the territory and the her inheritance had to be clearly defined back then and today clearly defined so there should be no ambiguity and well I'm not sure if I could really reach my loved ones or My Wayward Daughter and my son or I need healing I wonder if I pray now if you'll answer boy no at the end of the day if healing is yours you have to have faith to claim it he's is not going to say you know what you just come to church on a Wednesday night so that that is yours a bonus a lineup no if David had to fight and Samson had to fight and Abraham had had to fight how special are you now you're real special but guess what he special enough you still have to fight to develop into the character that he [Applause] wants now it's interesting we talk about fighting and there are certain things I would have mentioned before that in any fight we need to understand the parameters of the fight the parameters of the fight could be as follows you need to understand the rules in a traditional sense it may have a boxing match so they will have rules of boxing they will say well you could punch a particular way you're not allowed to put punch in a particular area also and in another type of fight they may say well you know what no holds bad you could do anything that that's the that's the rules of the fight so you must understand the rules of this fight as we talk about rules one of the things I want to say is that the opposition we fight don't don't fight fair at all amen he don't fight fair right so as a result I have a secret the secret in this case is that the person supporting you don't fight fair either because the battle is the Lords he win the fight already so no matter what device the enemy come with it may seemed very creative and hey I wasn't looking for him there know but guess what he believe and tremble know because the kind of power we working with he know he's defeated and know all he could do is Bluff all he could do is distract all he could do is attempt to show you something else but he lost already it's up to us to have faith and confidence and trust in God and know that the promises he left for us he is well able to fulfill manifest and accomplish so all we have to do is take the resources he give and fight knowing that he already have the victory amen amen but I want to say that when God gives an assignment it must be completed so if God say fight you have to fight you can't sit down and say well that probably applied to somebody else not me I'm not the fighting type I prefer we could discuss it I prefer you know let's find an amicable agreement let's find another way around it now no no no here's what going on and I want to show you in the scripture you don't have to find it but in numbers 33 verse 52- 56 we're going to read it and it says then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you amen and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all the high places verse 53 it says and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it verse 54 says and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more you shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance Every Man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers he shall inherit amen so once again very very specific Nothing by chance it's not because as you it's my partner long time so you'll get more no to the more you get more to the fewer you get less all right in verse 55 it says but and this is the important part so it's all well and good to fight eradicate them evict them destroy everything that sound nice as the battle right but here's what if you choose not to fight here's what happens but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before for you then it shall come to pass that those which let remain of them shall be Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall Vex you in the land wherein you dwell moreover it shall come to pass that I the same supporter you had before he said that I shall do unto you as I thought to do unto them what does that mean yes the opposite reverse right so when he tell you destroy when he tell you fight when he tell you conquer when he tell you disposes when he tell you listen inhabit stay right there separate when he tell you divide the inheritance and give lots to this one and that one you choose not to no you know what going on he say listen the same people that you feel sorry for the same sin that you feel you know what let let me leave that one alone because it affecting me much that same thing that same person that same challenge that same trial is what what will come as a torn in your side that will terrorize you that will ensure that the same God who give you the promise come and do unto you what he wanted you do unto them amen there's the word now this is the scripture amen now as we go on I keep saying the battle is the Lords but we have a responsibility to fight yes in this fight we talking about there are no rules except what God allows cuz as you can remember in the Book of Job the devil wanted to devour him kill him do every imaginable thing to him and you know what God said go ahead try just spare his life do all you could do throw him down kill his children ensure his Finance go down to the bottom of the barrel don't give him no contracts ensure that he can't pay his bills the debt collectors ringing on his phone as a matter of fact he can't get the calls because the phone cut right so do whatever you believe is the worst but you know what he would not move from the promise of God because he understand that the battle is the Lords you can't come against a child of God that is so convinced that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the promises he made back then is just as real to you right now how they will move you with the Revelation in your heart how they will shift you how they will distract or discourage you you have to stand and fight knowing that he is your supporter he is mighty in battle he is mighty to deliver and Conquer [Applause] amen additionally we said earlier that's not a fair fight it's not fair right but you know what is bepoke it customized to you so you have to fight your battle right you have to fight for yourself for your family for your loved ones brother always say listen you could pray how much you want the broom not going and get up and clean the room you know so you have a responsibility you alone could pray for you somebody could pray on your behalf but you have to develop your prayer life I want to say that the opposition the opponent the adversary whatever you want to describe them as they're well trained they know about fighting they know about battle they know about strategy they know about distraction they know about doing things that that seem ordinary but behind that they have some some some missiles that are targeted and trained on you they know where your weak points are they know how to tempt you they know how to throw you off but you know what the battle is the Lord's amen at the end of the day we have some serious resources amen we have a whole armor to stand against the Wilds of the wicked you know Wes of the enemy you know because we're not battling against flesh and blood you know it's not I stand up in front of my neighbor house so you can't move no it's against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places and things that you could conquer right on your knees right that attack you and try to throw you down and try to ensure that you can't accomplish what God set out for you to accomplish amen amen I also want to say we fight not because we like fighting we fight because we don't have a choice we fight because we must we have to it is not a a a a optional thing that I could sit down and rock back and say you know what I have feeling to fight today you know I have feeling to die today you know a feeling to take it easy today I take I taking a relax no it's no relaxation because the enemy we fight he busy his agenda is like a Thief he want to kill he want to steal he want to destroy if he could destroy you tonight if he could take your life tonight he do it but God the battle is the Lords so every promise your loved ones your prayer life your family your marriage your your health faith I mean it's your responsibility to fight for these things and he will ensure that you could have the victory because he selected you for that battle he knew what you will be going through he know what you're already going through so I know sometimes it feel like you're back against the wall and you're at death's door but you know what he knows that too am he knows how much pressure you could take because he knows where he wants you to be yes sir you know in the book of Samuel speaking about D David Sam Samuel 17:46 to 49 he said this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hands speaking about David and Goliath right he said this day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hands and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee and I will give the carus of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there's a God in Israel in verse 47 he said and all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands verse 48 says and it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and Drew nigh to meet David that David hastened he didn't move slow he had an assignment he knew what he had to do he say he hastened and ran towards the Army to meet the Philistine verse 49 say and David put his hand in his bag and took then a stone and slang it and smed the Philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk in it into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the Earth so clearly he had the resources you know he had the sling he had the stones he he had confidence in God so he was going with haste to the battle you know but you heard what he said he knew the battle was the Lords so although the battle was the Lords he had something to fight he had something something to do he had a responsibility so it's not for the preacher or the musician or the elder or the Deacon you have a responsibility the battle is his but you still have a role to play David couldn't go and stand up a spare or something and say you know what my God could defeat you or no he will defeat you let's say defeat you no at the end of the day he had had trained he was trained in operating the sling so when he put the stone and brother brandom dramatized he had five Stones why he knew he could kill Goliath with one you know F AI t h he went with those stones he put the first one and he ran to Goliath knowing it was a finished work this golad that stone couldn't miss him if he tried you know he couldn't lie down on the ground if he lied down on the ground the stone was going on the ground because the battle was the Lords so we must fight for every inch but the battle is the Lord's now when we talk about Joshua and we allude to it just now in Joshua's case in in in a message God keeps his word brother said way down in Egypt God said I've given you that land and all that's in it now he never just said I'm going to pick you up take you up there and sit you down they had to fight they had to fight let me read it again they had to fight for every inch of ground they had God when he commanded Joshua there he said be of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest brother brandham knocks on the pulpit two times the Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest no matter what it is how hard it is how great the obstacle is that does not matter it's down through the valley of the shadow of death the Lord Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest oh Joshua could call Israel together and said stand here and watch the glory of God God is with his word God made the promise God said to Joshua every place that The Souls of your foot sets that's yours I'll give it to you oh my my my in paragraph 141 it says it's a Salvation it's a Divine Healing it's a more blessing it's a anything that God promised make Footprints because every place you put your foot is yours why would you stand still if he said every place you put your foot is yours make Footprints tonight make Footprints tomorrow because every place you put your foot is yours amen he said that I have promised every place The Souls of your foot sets I've given you for a possession God promised it God keeps his word God's word is Everlasting true I believe it you believe it Brothers it's time for us to make Footprints we can't stay right here in the same camp the fire is moving on let's move on from glory to glory from Bible experience to Bible experience let's unfold and open our hearts raise up our hands to God keep same stay in the Bible don't get outside of that stay right there amen that's a prophet what a mighty God we serve in God's provided way for this day yes sir he said come with determination he said come with a determination amen come that you're going to stay there till it's over you know I I was at a conference recently and was a business event and and one of the things the guy said is that a lot of people fail because they're not willing to do whatever it takes this is a in a business context now he say listen and we heard it many many times we all have the same 24 hours but who is willing to do whatever ever it takes and it applies across the board so you could be a skillful me me mechanic and somebody brought a vehicle to you and said you know I think is the I don't know much about cars but I think is the wheel and you look at it and you check it and you realize you know what is the wheel is the axle I just call it names the spindle the whatever it is the rack the mons the whatever you know is this and they complain to you about the song or the way driving if you do whatever it takes it means you go above and beyond to ensure that when they come back to collect that it don't have a squeak it don't have a a tilt it don't have a turn they could go on it's smooth now in Trinidad they might get to having problems doing that but at the end of the day when you do that when you have the attitude that I am doing whatever it takes what do you think going to happen to you next time everybody is going to come by you because they know the quality that you offer you go above and beyond to ensure that that the service you offer whatever you deliver is in their opinion Perfection so here the prophet is saying come with determination come that you're going to stay till it's over stay there till God answers and vindicates are you willing to do whatever it takes are you willing to stick with it are you willing to stay there and do whatever it takes to get the result because the result isn't necessarily instantaneous you know I remember a story where the guy the bar and he was going and he say by his stripes I am healed by his stripes I am healed that was today he wasn't healed today or he didn't see the manifestation of the healing today the healing took place when he went through the line but the manifestation of that wasn't instantaneous it took some time to catch up to him so likewise it may not be one night you might have to stay two or five but are you willing to do whatever it takes amen y y you you may not have to pray for 10 minutes you might have to pray for 10 hours but are you willing to do whatever it takes remember what it takes for you might be different to your brother might be different to your sister right but are you willing to do whatever it takes that's the fight we talk we we talk we talking about this fight is not a a one-size fits all it's not a broad brush fight this fight is a custom bespoke fight that is customized to you that you have to overcome that you have to do whatever it takes for you to get the Victory and knowing that he will support you that he's got your back that he's got it covered so in that same paragraph there paragraph 55 he said come with a determination come that you're going to stay there till it's over stay there till God answers and vindicates a man that believes in God can see the presence of God feel the presence of God sense the presence of God and know that he's here he is here to answer everything that he made promise for in this day then cry till you get it hold on to him don't leave if you have to stay day and night God don't want his children to listen to intellectual speeches he want them to cry out to it till the promise is Vindicated Abraham here had a need of a sacrifice what happened God provided for him a lamb and that was God's provided way he needed a sacrifice so God provided it later on he called the place Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide for himself for sacrifice now job one time the old Prophet job he was a prophet he had got in trouble Satan has desire desired to tempt him and he broke him out in boils and he taken his children he taken his struck he taken all he had and he broke him out in boils and his comforters come what did they do they provided nothing but a scorn tease him telling him why you have sinned secretly and job just held right on he cried out he was sure he was following God's Commandments he had done exactly what God promised to do what God pro promised him that he would stand by him under the burn sacrifice and he stayed there so God provided him a vision he was a prophet what did he see he saw the word Jesus Christ he said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand upon the Earth through the though the skin worms destroyed his body yet in my flesh I shall see God that is what we we referring to doing whatever it takes no matter what the circumstance how gloomy dark and black it may seem you do whatever it takes because the battle is the Lords he already assured you the victory and you fight and you struggle and you fight until you get the Breakthrough until you see the manifestation of that promise for your life amen oh my my my my Lord he saw the word and he know that his bones and his body was rise again in the last day he was questioned if he know where God was just skipping through here quickly you know he said a flower dies it rises up again a tree goes down it rises up again but a man lay it down and give it up the ghost He Wast away where is he oh that thou would hide me in the grave and keep me in the secret place till I wrath be passed then the Thunders began to Roar the lightning began to flash the spirit of the Lord came upon the prophet and he stood up and he saw the coming of the Lord and he screamed I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the Earth though the skin worms destroy this body in my flesh I shall see God God provided the word Jesus Christ and he saw him and called him his Redeemer amen my my my just winding down here musician stepen you know we talk a lot about fighting about the Battle about achieving and accomplishing and God supporting but I just want to touch briefly on the opposition and I think it's serious and it says Satan will make you all kind of promises but he has nothing to give you because he don't have anything he doesn't have salvation what is Satan anything contrary to the word anything anything I'm not going to identify and Define anything contrary to the word is Satan he doesn't have salvation he doesn't have light his kingdom is Darkness this is from Oneness right 5 55 he said the end thereof is death darkness and death is Satan's kingdom brother Brandon repeat it again what is Satan's kingdom anything contrary to the word of God that is Satan's kingdom now that's cutting but it's time for cutting too yes see the branch the tree it's going to Bear if it's going to Bear it must be pruned it must be cut it must be shaved it's time anything contrary to the precepts of God the word of God is not God amen amen what is it what is sin righteousness perverted what is death life perverted what is the kingdom anything any teaching one word just one word you might believe every bit Eve believed every bit Eve believed every bit of it to that one word amen that one word is all she needed to disbelieve that one word is all you need to disbelieve and that's all I going to say about the opposition remember when I say he's masterful he's skillful so sometimes it's just one word you want to change one word you want to shift one word you want to use to try to confuse the whole thing and we know the story we know how how it went in the beginning Garden of Eden when he said listen shall not one word is all it took and that led into a ripple effect and we see the impacts of of it even today the the impact of one word so I would say we take that as a lesson to be cautious and careful we don't want to play games we don't want to do intellectual gymnastics and say well you know it's it sound good or know it it sound 99% correct I'm not sure about that part but it song He said listen if it's not 100% leave leave it alone leave it alone just one word we want to be wary of we want to be careful of we want to have discernment and no listen if it's not the word of God we staying away from from it if it's anything contrary to the word I Satan it doesn't matter how pretty it songs how how nice and and and oh my goodness it was so smooth it was silky boy it sounds so fantastic they were so articulate if it's anything contrary to the word of God Satan it might look good it might sound good it might smell good same Satan amen so as we conclude I say God has called us and he has commissioned us you can play something softly he's commission us to fight yes for every inch he is clearly defined the boundaries he's clearly defined what is ours he's identified Pro promises over and over and over it's up to us to catch a hold of faith and be able to cut it out for ourselves so healing is ours the Holy Ghost is ours an is ours salvation is ours I mean every promise every Redemptive promise of God we should be able to catch a hold of faith and claim it for ourselves and fight and do whatever it takes to ensure we fight for every in of ground knowing that the battle is the Lord's amen let's stand on this time Hallelujah God is so good God is so good God is so good he's so good to me I love him so I love him so oh I I love him so I love him so he's so
