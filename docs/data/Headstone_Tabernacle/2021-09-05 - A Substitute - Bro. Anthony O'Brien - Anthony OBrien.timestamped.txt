[39:27] amen and this is adam
[39:29] uh in the garden of eden and this is
[39:31] after the sin had taken place
[39:34] genesis 3 7 says and the eyes of them
[39:37] both were opened
[39:40] and they knew
[39:41] that they were naked
[39:43] and they sowed fig leaves together
[39:46] and made themselves aprons
[39:49] and they heard the voice of the lord
[39:51] walking in the garden
[39:53] in the cool of the day
[39:55] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[39:58] from the presence of the lord
[40:00] amongst the trees of the garden
[40:03] and the lord called unto abraham
[40:06] and said unto him where art thou
[40:09] and he said
[40:10] i heard thy voice in the garden
[40:13] and i was afraid
[40:15] because i was naked
[40:17] and i hid
[40:19] myself
[40:20] my
[40:21] now turning over to hebrews chapter 9.
[40:24] i want to read from verse 11
[40:27] to 15.
[40:29] amen and amen
[40:31] hallelujah hebrews chapter 9
[40:34] and verse 11
[40:37] says but grace being come
[40:39] and hype uh but christ sorry being
[40:41] common high priest of good things to
[40:44] come
[40:45] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[40:48] not made with hands
[40:50] this is to say not of this building
[40:54] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[40:57] but by his own blood
[40:59] he entered in once
[41:02] into the holy place
[41:04] having obtained eternal redemption for
[41:07] us
[41:08] for if the blood of bulls and goats
[41:11] and the ashes of an heifer
[41:14] sprinkling the unclean
[41:16] sanctified to the purifying
[41:19] of the flesh
[41:21] how much more
[41:23] shall the blood of christ
[41:25] who through the eternal spirit offered
[41:28] himself
[41:30] without spot to god
[41:32] purge your conscience
[41:35] from dead works to serve the living god
[41:39] and for this cause
[41:41] he is the mediator
[41:43] of the new testament
[41:45] that by means of death for the
[41:48] redemption of the transgressions
[41:51] that were under the first testament
[41:54] they which are called might receive the
[41:56] promise
[41:57] of eternal inheritance amen and amen
[42:01] hallelujah we got our blessing to the

[43:24] your seats if you were standing you
[43:26] praise god you could just have a seat
[43:28] now
[43:33] amen praise the name of the lord so
[43:36] hope you're feeling fine this morning
[43:38] praise god and let the truth say amen
[43:40] praise the name of the lord amen
[43:43] and amen god is good
[43:45] amen praise all the time amen
[43:48] please god despite your ups and downs
[43:50] praise god he is there
[43:52] he many men hallelujah to lead you
[43:54] through amen i have a thought this
[43:56] morning
[43:57] praise god very
[43:59] uh on to what for me
[44:02] because it is my usual uh route as i
[44:05] should see
[44:06] but god is in charge amen i'm just
[44:08] healing myself now to be a tool for the
[44:11] harvest
[44:12] and i just praise god know that god this
[44:15] is what god wants this morning i feel
[44:18] amen this is uh
[44:19] leaning of the lord
[44:21] so a title this morning
[44:23] a substitute
[44:25] amen that's my title this morning
[44:28] a substitute
[44:29] praise the name of the lord
[44:31] now what does it mean i like to i like
[44:33] definitions
[44:35] praise god so i'm going to give you the
[44:36] meaning of it
[44:37] to kind of clearly define what we're
[44:39] talking about
[44:40] today
[44:41] a substitute means to take the place of
[44:45] or to put in or or to put or to use
[44:49] in the place of another
[44:51] amen isn't that right
[44:53] substitute means to take the place of
[44:57] isn't that right and usually
[45:00] usually we use we take this meaning of
[45:03] substitute usually take it to replace
[45:06] something that was original
[45:09] or something that was
[45:10] originally was there something that is
[45:12] authentic
[45:14] we may replace it with a substitute
[45:16] isn't that right and in some cases or
[45:19] maybe most cases you might find that the
[45:21] substitute
[45:22] is not as good as the original
[45:25] isn't that right
[45:26] but sometimes it's just a placeholder
[45:29] praise god it just takes up a place
[45:32] until the original could come
[45:34] and do the original work
[45:36] that the original thing was meant to do
[45:39] amen amen hallelujah but until that time
[45:42] you're given a substitute to kind of
[45:44] just hold in place of
[45:46] to carry you until that time
[45:48] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[45:51] praise god and as this thought dropped
[45:53] down to me i began to see god unfold it
[45:57] unfold it praise god it was like a it
[46:00] was like a firework okay man just kept
[46:01] exploding exploding
[46:03] and um amen i began to see substitutes
[46:06] and it was just all through the bible
[46:08] praise god and we'll take a run through
[46:10] this morning praise god and see what god
[46:12] will reveal to us amen
[46:14] glory to god but a substitute so usually
[46:17] you use it to mean
[46:19] replacing something that may be original
[46:22] so a class maybe
[46:24] about 30 children or so maybe they've
[46:26] been teaching matthew man but it's team
[46:28] oliver know about that
[46:29] and they have a teacher they started off
[46:31] with this teacher and they're accustomed
[46:32] to the teacher they go used to the
[46:34] teacher but then maybe they end up with
[46:36] a substitute teacher for some reason
[46:38] that teacher couldn't be with them at
[46:41] that time then they'd have to get a
[46:43] substitute to hold in place of
[46:46] until they could come back to the
[46:48] original teacher that was there isn't
[46:50] that right praise god amen and amen
[46:52] hallelujah isn't that right
[46:54] praise god
[46:56] we can also take the meaning of
[46:57] substitute as a requirement
[46:59] when we look at it in spiritual context
[47:02] god requiring a substitute for us
[47:06] for our sins for our faults for all
[47:09] failures isn't that right
[47:11] amen we
[47:12] at one time required a substitute isn't
[47:16] that right glory to god amen amen oh
[47:19] hallelujah so i have a quote here
[47:22] let me just read this here a uh
[47:26] so original context and what we read in
[47:28] the bible here or scripture genesis
[47:31] chapter three
[47:32] amen and this is the context this is how
[47:34] god showed it to me amen it was through
[47:36] this adam and eve story in the garden of
[47:38] eden isn't that right
[47:40] and god we know god gave adam the word
[47:43] amen he said eat of every tree in the
[47:46] garden but
[47:48] of the tree of knowledge and of good and
[47:50] evil do not eat amen he told them don't
[47:53] touch that tree amen that was the word
[47:56] of the lord amen he also put a
[47:59] commandment over him to multiply and
[48:01] replenish isn't that right but the
[48:04] revelation of how that was to be wasn't
[48:07] unfolded yet praise god he just spoke it
[48:11] praise god that's how god does it he's
[48:13] always done it that way praise god he
[48:15] proclaims it praise god and then he
[48:18] comes down and shows what it all is
[48:20] afterwards isn't that right hallelujah
[48:22] and so god gave adam the word isn't that
[48:25] right and when he took woman out of man
[48:28] and we know the soaring
[48:30] adam told the woman what god had said
[48:33] isn't that right so they were all aware
[48:36] they all knew what god required of them
[48:40] isn't that right they all had the word
[48:44] they all had a word for that day
[48:47] amen amen but when man sinned in the
[48:49] garden
[48:52] isn't that right
[48:53] we know the serpent came into the
[48:55] picture
[48:56] subtle
[48:57] how little beast of the field come
[49:00] and there was something the devil could
[49:01] use
[49:03] to deceive that woman isn't that right
[49:06] isn't that right and he told her you
[49:08] shall not surely die
[49:10] praise god but you shall be as gods and
[49:12] different things isn't that right
[49:14] my
[49:15] and he threw in a little word in there
[49:17] he twists the word praise god amen and
[49:20] perverted the original
[49:22] because the devil cannot create he can
[49:25] only pervert the original oh he's a
[49:28] perverter of the original truth oh
[49:31] hallelujah that's what he does that's
[49:33] his power his power is really only to
[49:35] twist what was the original truth or
[49:38] what was the original story oh
[49:40] hallelujah right glory to god amen amen
[49:43] hallelujah the original narrative
[49:46] that god gave to adam praise god that
[49:50] even the serpent didn't even know it
[49:52] isn't that right he had to ask eve what
[49:55] did god say
[49:57] and then
[49:59] she divulged amen what she heard from
[50:02] adam and what got him heard from god
[50:04] isn't that right praise god hallelujah
[50:07] hallelujah isn't that right i went that
[50:09] was spoken then he had something he
[50:11] could twist now
[50:12] hallelujah isn't that right now he had
[50:14] something he could misconstrue amen and
[50:17] misrepresent praise god hallelujah to
[50:20] her praise god and amen the bible said
[50:22] that she saw
[50:24] when i saw that it was desired to make
[50:27] one wise and different things
[50:29] amen isn't that right and she fell into
[50:31] sin
[50:32] watch
[50:34] and the woman and she gave of her
[50:36] husband also the fruit to eat thereof
[50:37] isn't that right and they both fell now
[50:40] watch adam had the word
[50:42] isn't that right
[50:43] but in order to pick up this this uh
[50:46] this this untruth
[50:48] he had to first give up the word praise
[50:51] god in order to receive something else
[50:54] praise god isn't that right
[50:56] he had the word all the time
[50:58] but when that lie was presented to him
[51:00] he had a choice at that time he could
[51:03] either stay with the word
[51:05] or receive this lie
[51:07] but in order for him to receive this lie
[51:10] he had to first give up the truth
[51:12] praise god and he took a substitute
[51:15] instead of the truth oh hallelujah isn't
[51:18] that right they took the devil's line
[51:21] in place of the word that he had
[51:23] originally gave to them
[51:25] do not eat thereof
[51:27] isn't that right
[51:28] praise god hallelujah hallelujah
[51:31] and then let adam let go of the word of
[51:33] god
[51:34] and a substitute took its place
[51:36] harlan isn't that right
[51:38] my see it there
[51:40] human reasoning
[51:43] isn't that right took its place
[51:45] human intellect
[51:47] loss of the eyes lust of the flesh
[51:51] took its place
[51:53] and anytime we give up the word
[51:55] we end up with a substitute
[51:58] instead
[51:59] amen isn't that right
[52:02] uh prophet said here 1953 israel and the
[52:04] church
[52:06] paragraph 22 he said he made a covenant
[52:08] with man
[52:10] and man always breaks his covenant
[52:14] but man has always tried to find some
[52:17] way to save himself
[52:20] trying to make himself
[52:22] uh uh it can't see trying to make
[52:25] himself isn't that right trying to make
[52:27] himself a salvation
[52:28] it comes from a strain
[52:30] in the garden of eden
[52:33] and when man had realized that he had
[52:35] sinned
[52:36] he tried to make himself a religion
[52:40] oh hallelujah are covering amen and we
[52:43] just read in the scripture they sew
[52:45] together fig leaves isn't that right
[52:47] because all the time they were in our
[52:49] garden and praise god when they had done
[52:51] the sin they had not recognized it yet
[52:55] but then when god come down walking in
[52:57] the garden of eden just like he would in
[52:59] the cool of the day as he usually would
[53:02] all of a sudden it was a different thing
[53:04] altogether
[53:05] oh hallelujah they realized that they
[53:07] were naked
[53:09] and they hid themselves from the
[53:11] presence of the lord isn't that right
[53:14] oh my
[53:16] it comes from a strain in the garden of
[53:18] eden a stream of prophecy
[53:21] and when man realized he had sinned
[53:23] he tried to make himself a religion a
[53:26] covering
[53:27] and the word religion means covering
[53:30] and adam and eve sowed fig leaves
[53:32] together
[53:34] and made themselves a religion
[53:36] and since then
[53:38] it's been a strain of man coming down
[53:41] through the age
[53:43] trying to
[53:44] uh to do something
[53:46] to save himself
[53:47] oh
[53:48] mercy isn't that right that's the
[53:50] condition that man has come into
[53:53] trying to save themselves praise god
[53:56] trying to put on a covering oh
[53:58] hallelujah who told you that you were
[54:00] naked hallelujah but when the presence
[54:03] of god comes you'll recognize your own
[54:06] faults you'll recognize your own
[54:08] failures you'll recognize your own
[54:11] shortcomings and you stand naked in the
[54:14] presence of god without that covering
[54:17] isn't that right
[54:19] so if man felt naked
[54:22] then it means he had a covering before
[54:24] isn't that right
[54:26] he had a covering before because when
[54:28] god came into the garden of eden
[54:30] man didn't feel that insecurity
[54:33] no he ran boldly out to meet the lord to
[54:36] tell god about how his day was
[54:39] to have a conversation with the father
[54:42] but here it was that when god come down
[54:44] as his custom
[54:47] in the cool of the day
[54:49] adam was in a different place
[54:51] because god had to ask the question
[54:53] where art thou
[54:55] you're not in your place
[54:57] you're not where i left you where is
[54:59] your covering why are you hiding who
[55:02] told you
[55:03] that you were naked oh hallelujah
[55:06] hallelujah
[55:08] hallelujah my
[55:10] the prophet said here on prodigal 1950
[55:13] he said look
[55:14] how the little how little the the first
[55:16] sin was
[55:18] but look what it did to the human race
[55:20] when the first sin was committed look at
[55:22] the difference
[55:24] when the message came to heaven
[55:26] is he dramatizing here now god is in
[55:28] heaven
[55:29] and the message came that your son has
[55:31] fallen
[55:32] well it looked like adam ought to have
[55:35] been running around the garden hollering
[55:36] oh father oh father
[55:38] where are you
[55:40] but adam went and hid himself
[55:43] oh my
[55:44] oh
[55:46] you see that there it was just vice
[55:48] versa
[55:50] it was a father calling
[55:52] son son
[55:53] where up
[55:56] you see how man will just
[55:57] try to to to justify him themself
[56:01] he'll try to stand behind something
[56:04] instead of coming right out
[56:06] and saying what he is
[56:09] and confessing his sins before god he'll
[56:12] try to hide behind something oh
[56:15] hallelujah hallelujah glory isn't that
[56:17] right how many times we tried to hide
[56:20] behind something
[56:22] oh isn't that right people hide behind
[56:25] church
[56:26] people hide behind a group
[56:28] people hide behind an interpretation
[56:31] people hide behind their idea
[56:34] of what god is people hide behind their
[56:36] family people hide behind a job people
[56:39] hide behind their home people hide
[56:42] behind their fortresses they build
[56:44] people hide behind education people hide
[56:47] behind stuff oh holly but god is
[56:50] exposing it today
[56:52] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[56:55] hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah
[56:58] hallelujah don't hide behind something
[57:02] there's nothing you could do to hide
[57:04] not when god comes down
[57:06] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[57:09] amen and there he was
[57:11] the searchings of god
[57:13] walking
[57:15] running up and down
[57:17] through the garden screaming
[57:20] for his lost boy
[57:22] the father hunting oh i love this
[57:25] prophet
[57:26] describing the sitting scenario here
[57:29] here is god
[57:30] looking for adam
[57:32] he's sinned
[57:34] he's gone into a dark place
[57:37] and here is god looking for his lost
[57:39] little boy
[57:40] searching for the sun
[57:43] oh it should have been the sun searching
[57:44] for the father
[57:46] and today it's just the same
[57:49] just as soon as man sins
[57:51] instead of coming out and confessing his
[57:53] sins before god he'll try to get back
[57:56] he'll try to hide behind something he'll
[57:58] try to get a self-made religion
[58:01] oh my hallelujah glory to god hallelujah
[58:05] but look at adam my
[58:07] he said they made
[58:08] aprons of fig leaves
[58:11] and they put that around there the fig
[58:13] leaves
[58:14] but when they came to the place
[58:17] where god called adam and eve to stand
[58:20] before him
[58:21] they realized that they had a man-made
[58:24] religion
[58:25] isn't that right and the word religion
[58:27] means a covering
[58:30] and they were covered by a self-made
[58:32] apron you see it
[58:34] now that strain is in man yet today the
[58:37] prophet said
[58:38] and instead of trying to come god's way
[58:40] of repentance and believing on his son
[58:42] and letting the blood of his son cleanse
[58:44] us from our sins we slip around
[58:47] and try to find some other way isn't
[58:50] that right
[58:51] some way of escape
[58:53] from coming god's way
[58:56] we'll say well this religion or i'll
[58:58] join this church
[59:00] or we'll do this
[59:02] where it's not quite so strict
[59:04] and then make fig leaves
[59:06] and when they had to face
[59:09] god it was no good the prophet said
[59:11] their fig leaves was no good
[59:14] and you come to find out my dear friend
[59:17] that man-made theories
[59:20] will not stand when you're coming down
[59:23] to the last breath of this body and this
[59:25] life oh he said it's good to live by
[59:28] those things
[59:29] but you can't die by them
[59:31] oh

[59:35] original thing

[1:01:38] oh
[1:01:40] man
[1:01:41] isn't that right
[1:01:44] and god
[1:01:47] covered them with skins
[1:01:49] isn't that right
[1:01:50] the prophet said if he covered them with
[1:01:52] skins then it meant something died
[1:01:54] isn't that right
[1:01:55] he covered them with skins he gave them
[1:01:57] a covering himself
[1:02:00] it wasn't the perfect covering
[1:02:02] it wasn't the one they had
[1:02:04] originally but our sacrifice was not
[1:02:07] required because
[1:02:09] because death was now in the picture
[1:02:13] isn't that right
[1:02:14] a god had to kill something prophet said
[1:02:17] he covered them with with skins
[1:02:21] to cover them
[1:02:23] to cover the shame of their nakedness
[1:02:25] hallelujah isn't that right
[1:02:27] oh glory to god
[1:02:30] see god provided a substitute now
[1:02:33] oh hallelujah the fake leaves wasn't
[1:02:35] good enough so what'd he do he could
[1:02:37] provide a substitute
[1:02:38] praise god hallelujah something died and
[1:02:41] he took those skins and he covered his
[1:02:43] son and his daughter
[1:02:45] oh mercy what a picture
[1:02:47] my god
[1:02:49] and so when adam and his wife were
[1:02:50] driven out of the garden of eden
[1:02:52] we know the story that they bought sons
[1:02:55] one named cain
[1:02:57] and another name abel
[1:02:59] isn't that right
[1:03:01] one
[1:03:02] totally different spirit from the other
[1:03:06] and if works did show and testify of
[1:03:08] this amen
[1:03:09] the fruits that they bore isn't that
[1:03:11] right
[1:03:12] and god had come a time when god
[1:03:14] required worship
[1:03:16] from cain and abel he said come on
[1:03:19] offer
[1:03:20] something come and show me
[1:03:22] what your revelation is he didn't tell
[1:03:24] him
[1:03:25] what to do you just tell him
[1:03:26] come and show me
[1:03:28] what what what your what your idea of
[1:03:30] this is what what what you have in your
[1:03:32] heart
[1:03:33] come and present something to me
[1:03:36] that i may approve it that i may receive
[1:03:38] it that i may accept it isn't that right
[1:03:41] and here come cain
[1:03:44] bring in the fruits of the land
[1:03:46] flowers
[1:03:48] beautiful things
[1:03:50] cain took his time
[1:03:52] oh isn't that right
[1:03:54] he had wonderful things he had figs and
[1:03:56] leaves and this and that and all the
[1:03:58] things he all the beautiful things
[1:04:00] colors
[1:04:01] he arrayed it in a special way he wanted
[1:04:02] to create a certain pattern
[1:04:04] took his time
[1:04:06] placed each one
[1:04:07] set up his altar as it was
[1:04:11] and they got to prove it
[1:04:13] no
[1:04:14] didn't approve it
[1:04:16] isn't that right
[1:04:17] because this
[1:04:19] what god was asking for
[1:04:21] required a substitute
[1:04:24] a proper substitute isn't that right
[1:04:27] hallelujah because
[1:04:29] what cain didn't realize
[1:04:31] was that a sacrifice was required
[1:04:34] isn't that right
[1:04:35] cain and abel sat down
[1:04:38] in their father's church for years
[1:04:41] and heard their father
[1:04:43] adam
[1:04:44] talk about the garden of eden
[1:04:46] and where they were
[1:04:47] and how beautiful it was
[1:04:49] talk about how they were driven out
[1:04:52] talk about the sin talk about the change
[1:04:56] talk about everything else that took
[1:04:57] place
[1:04:58] they know everything that happened
[1:05:00] but here was god now asking them what is
[1:05:03] your revelation
[1:05:04] praise god show it to me
[1:05:06] show me a worship and cain brought
[1:05:09] fruits
[1:05:10] fruits of himself
[1:05:12] so cain really
[1:05:14] uh
[1:05:15] he brought he barely brought himself
[1:05:18] isn't that right what he could do
[1:05:21] what he could produce
[1:05:23] what he could create what he could what
[1:05:25] he could design
[1:05:26] he brought he represented himself
[1:05:28] basically before gone
[1:05:30] and it was rejected
[1:05:32] but when abel saw the opportunity
[1:05:35] to worship before god
[1:05:37] abel understood by revelation
[1:05:40] oh hello knows no one told him that
[1:05:43] praise god because
[1:05:44] god didn't tell him what to do
[1:05:46] so it's up to them do whatever you feel
[1:05:48] led in your heart but there was
[1:05:49] something in abel's heart
[1:05:51] when abel understood
[1:05:53] where they were
[1:05:55] and where they were now and when abel
[1:05:57] understood his father's stories his
[1:06:00] testimony he realized that a sacrifice
[1:06:03] was required oh hallelujah
[1:06:06] caught an animal oh honey is that right
[1:06:10] laid it there praise god took a rock and
[1:06:12] cut it hallelujah and the blood splashed
[1:06:14] hallelujah right upon the altar isn't
[1:06:16] that right oh that he had made and god
[1:06:19] received that sacrifice oh god accepted
[1:06:23] this worship hallelujah why because he
[1:06:25] realized
[1:06:27] that a substitute was required
[1:06:29] a life for our life
[1:06:31] amen is that right
[1:06:33] hallelujah
[1:06:35] isn't that right
[1:06:36] a substitute was required
[1:06:38] amen
[1:06:40] adam caught uh able caught it
[1:06:42] the revelation of it
[1:06:44] what was required for this day
[1:06:46] amen since back then it was always
[1:06:49] required
[1:06:50] isn't that right something has to die
[1:06:53] in order for something to live
[1:06:55] amen and amen
[1:06:58] that's the way it is and so now watch
[1:07:02] now why a substitute
[1:07:05] why a substitute let's ask ourselves
[1:07:07] this question
[1:07:09] now why would someone choose a
[1:07:10] substitute
[1:07:12] over the original so we could take
[1:07:14] substitutes in different contexts
[1:07:16] there's a positive end of it
[1:07:18] where god uh we're a subject required
[1:07:20] for us for sin and so forth and god
[1:07:22] gives our substitute is narang
[1:07:24] but then sometimes a substitute can
[1:07:26] substitute the original
[1:07:28] something i wasn't there before
[1:07:30] praise god and sometimes people take a
[1:07:32] negative substitute isn't that right
[1:07:34] almost
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:36] praise the name of the lord and
[1:07:37] sometimes it just doesn't do no good
[1:07:39] like the fig leaves was man's idea of a
[1:07:41] substitute isn't that right amen but the
[1:07:44] killing of the animals
[1:07:45] this was god's requirement for a
[1:07:47] substitute amen isn't that right this
[1:07:49] was god's idea of a substitute until the
[1:07:51] original could come which we know was
[1:07:53] christ who was the original substitute
[1:07:56] amen isn't that right praise god he was
[1:07:59] the original he come from glory
[1:08:02] hallelujah to take your place
[1:08:04] holla because you needed a substitute oh
[1:08:07] but he wasn't no substitute he was the
[1:08:09] original praise god amen and he took
[1:08:11] your place amen amen amen and because he
[1:08:14] took your place praise god you can now
[1:08:16] stand blameless before god because he
[1:08:19] took your place you could say amen
[1:08:22] because he took your place you could say
[1:08:24] hallelujah because he took your place
[1:08:27] you could pray with confidence come
[1:08:30] boldly before the throne of god with the
[1:08:32] blood of jesus christ splash upon you
[1:08:35] forgiving you remitting you of every sin
[1:08:38] oh hallelujah because the original
[1:08:40] substitute oh glory come and take your
[1:08:43] place
[1:08:44] oh hallelujah
[1:08:47] it
[1:08:47] took your place
[1:08:49] glory to god
[1:08:52] took your place yes your place
[1:08:55] because you were supposed to die
[1:08:57] you were supposed to pay that price
[1:09:00] hallelujah but god come and paid it for
[1:09:03] you
[1:09:03] amen men hallelujah holy glory that god
[1:09:06] is not right
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:09] a little more in the monitors brother
[1:09:10] timmy man if you could preschool
[1:09:13] now why a substitute why why would
[1:09:15] someone choose now
[1:09:17] a man-made substitute
[1:09:19] rather over the original
[1:09:21] the reason i believe is because man
[1:09:24] loves a shortcut isn't that right
[1:09:27] they love shortcuts they like the easier
[1:09:29] way
[1:09:31] you see it all the time
[1:09:32] sometimes they have a nice park paved
[1:09:34] out
[1:09:35] and they they make an entrance on a
[1:09:37] little gate and stuff like sometimes i
[1:09:38] look at those things
[1:09:39] sometimes you know they might make a
[1:09:41] nice little area or whatnot and because
[1:09:44] people find it so hard to walk all the
[1:09:46] way around there to get to that place
[1:09:48] i'm trying to get to
[1:09:49] they cut a hole in the side
[1:09:51] pass this way
[1:09:53] because it's easier
[1:09:55] good fence they cut a hole
[1:09:58] because they're looking for a
[1:10:00] shortcut
[1:10:03] my
[1:10:04] see they they want shortcuts that's just
[1:10:07] man's nature
[1:10:08] the prophet said and you must be born
[1:10:10] again 1961 he said shortcuts tonight
[1:10:13] they're out there today
[1:10:16] they're going on he said oh my
[1:10:18] and tomorrow they want to preach
[1:10:20] pentecostal people let them do that too
[1:10:22] yeah
[1:10:23] they want a shortcut to heaven
[1:10:24] hallelujah all i have to do is get down
[1:10:26] there and just not think of nothing at
[1:10:27] all and say hallelujah hallelujah i've
[1:10:29] got on elijah's garment some things like

[1:10:38] praise god here i go he said they want
[1:10:40] the shortcut to heaven
[1:10:43] taken as much of the world as they can
[1:10:45] take
[1:10:46] amen
[1:10:47] they can't take any of it the prophet
[1:10:49] said there's no
[1:10:51] shortcuts
[1:10:53] you come the way of calvary
[1:10:56] you come the way of the brass altar oh
[1:11:00] hallelujah isn't that right glory to god
[1:11:03] hallelujah oh where the others where the
[1:11:05] sacrifices offered up in your stead the
[1:11:08] brass altar isn't that right but over
[1:11:11] here man my inspiration so beautifully

[1:11:14] remember for the presentation zone the
[1:11:16] brass altar and what that means for us

[1:11:30] serpent oh hallelujah when they cast
[1:11:33] their eyes upon it they were healed
[1:11:35] god provided a substitute for them isn't
[1:11:38] that right he said you actually you die
[1:11:41] the prophet said you
[1:11:42] actually die oh god
[1:11:45] why can't i say it right
[1:11:47] he said you actually die you literally
[1:11:50] tied to yourself

[1:11:55] the world
[1:11:56] and you are born anew

[1:12:11] and they don't want to grow

[1:16:37] you believe
[1:16:38] first they started off by saying you got
[1:16:40] it when you believe it
[1:16:42] the prophet said that baptist doctrine
[1:16:45] now they're saying i am the holy ghost
[1:16:47] well i don't even know

[1:17:29] holiday sweetness and humility oh
[1:17:31] hallelujah lived voices
[1:17:34] that's what we need today
[1:17:36] is thousands and thousands of more live
[1:17:39] voices
[1:17:40] that is the thunder that shakes the
[1:17:42] devil that is a thunder that'll shake
[1:17:45] this world oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:48] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:49] hallelujah
[1:17:52] my
[1:17:55] they don't want to do they don't want to
[1:17:57] do the work that's involved
[1:17:59] in getting to this perfection so they
[1:18:01] take a shortcut you get it now
[1:18:04] they take a shortcut
[1:18:07] they take their own substitute their own
[1:18:09] way
[1:18:10] of doing it
[1:18:12] in order to try to get to this
[1:18:14] but you can't get to this perfection
[1:18:16] praise god in your own human spirit in
[1:18:18] your own human strength they're people
[1:18:20] at natural virtues
[1:18:22] naturally patient they're naturally kind
[1:18:25] naturally loving
[1:18:26] sweet people nice people really great
[1:18:29] really sweet people
[1:18:32] but that is not this
[1:18:34] that is just
[1:18:36] man me
[1:18:38] that has its limits
[1:18:41] but when that comes to its end
[1:18:43] that is when this takes or to take over
[1:18:46] isn't that right
[1:18:48] those rainbows ought to be flashing
[1:18:50] praise god hallelujah glory to god that
[1:18:52] you could see the fullness of god
[1:18:54] veil in our brine
[1:18:56] that'll be the difference
[1:18:58] between what's man-made
[1:19:00] and what's the original original amen
[1:19:02] oh my god so it's like the ten ten
[1:19:06] versions isn't that right five or why is
[1:19:07] five are foolish
[1:19:08] but overall it always says he said they
[1:19:10] didn't want to pay the extra cost
[1:19:13] that's what they separated the foolish
[1:19:15] from the wise
[1:19:17] amen that's what separated the foolish
[1:19:20] from the wise they didn't want to pay
[1:19:22] the extra course for the extra oil they
[1:19:26] didn't want to do the extra
[1:19:28] amen what it took to press a little
[1:19:30] further praise god a little longer
[1:19:33] praise god hallelujah amen to get in
[1:19:35] there
[1:19:37] but the great contest is on this morning
[1:19:39] are you going to press your way into
[1:19:42] what god has required for us
[1:19:44] are you going to press your way into
[1:19:45] perfection because perfection is
[1:19:48] required and because perfection was
[1:19:50] required god presented his own
[1:19:53] substitute in the form of his own son
[1:19:55] christ jesus
[1:19:57] took our place the prophet said he took
[1:19:59] our place
[1:20:00] so that we could take his because that's
[1:20:03] the purpose he died for oh hallelujah
[1:20:06] isn't that right praise god amen
[1:20:09] hallelujah
[1:20:10] so that he can make a way for perfection
[1:20:12] so that you could come to it
[1:20:15] oh my
[1:20:17] if he didn't make our way
[1:20:19] we couldn't get in there
[1:20:20] and now that he has made our way what
[1:20:22] have we got to do die out ourselves
[1:20:25] isn't that right
[1:20:26] our sacrifice is required now watch but
[1:20:29] god requires a sacrifice somebody has to
[1:20:30] die in order for somebody to live am i
[1:20:32] right that's the reader adam uh the
[1:20:34] reason adam and his wife sewed those fig
[1:20:36] leaves together
[1:20:38] is because they found
[1:20:40] that they were naked isn't that right
[1:20:43] hallelujah isn't that right okay
[1:20:45] now uh
[1:20:46] where are we at here
[1:20:49] okay prophet said on prodigal one more
[1:20:51] time he said believe uh before we leave
[1:20:52] this here about the fake leaves he said
[1:20:54] i wish you say one more word he said
[1:20:55] notice what god did when he met with
[1:20:57] adam and them he said they had their own
[1:21:00] uh their own made religion
[1:21:02] it hasn't been 24 hours ago till someone
[1:21:04] said brother branham you know what my
[1:21:06] religion is he said my religion is the
[1:21:08] golden rule prophet said do unto others
[1:21:11] as you have others do to you isn't that
[1:21:13] right
[1:21:14] and i said well that's that's good
[1:21:18] but that hasn't got any salvation in it
[1:21:20] prophet said that's right except a man
[1:21:22] be born again he will in no wise enter
[1:21:25] the kingdom
[1:21:26] born of the spirit of god
[1:21:29] renewed regenerated
[1:21:31] become a new person in christ jesus all
[1:21:33] things passed away and all things become
[1:21:36] new converted changed over
[1:21:39] going your road this way and turn come
[1:21:42] this way and vice versa isn't that right
[1:21:44] but now when they they
[1:21:46] when they stood before god adam he was
[1:21:48] afraid to come out he said i'm naked he
[1:21:51] said now notice god went out and got
[1:21:53] some skins got in made aprons tied them
[1:21:55] around
[1:21:56] notice if god got skins he had to kill
[1:21:58] something this was it here this is where
[1:21:59] i got it from
[1:22:01] somebody had to die in order to make a
[1:22:03] covering he killed something
[1:22:05] he got the skins off them
[1:22:08] and something died in their place
[1:22:09] because their penalty was death
[1:22:12] and so an innocent victim had to die
[1:22:16] for the guilty to cover them up
[1:22:19] isn't that right
[1:22:20] i said so it is today friends
[1:22:27] not the golden rule which is all right
[1:22:30] not the ten commandments which is holy
[1:22:33] but god killed something to cover you up
[1:22:36] oh his son jesus christ
[1:22:38] died on calvary the innocent for the
[1:22:41] guilty
[1:22:42] to make a way
[1:22:43] that you and i might be innocent in him
[1:22:47] before god oh you stand blameless in him
[1:22:51] before god oh hallelujah hallelujah when
[1:22:54] he died you die and when he rose again
[1:22:57] you rose oh we are in him oh isn't that
[1:23:00] right and that's the thing
[1:23:02] that the holy spirit is searching
[1:23:04] through the land today says
[1:23:06] trying to find someone to believe on him
[1:23:10] to believe on jesus christ
[1:23:12] amen and amen oh mercy
[1:23:15] so the beginning of jesus fame 1953 he
[1:23:17] said brother sister the church ought to
[1:23:18] get in god's program
[1:23:20] he said then the church will move all
[1:23:22] right
[1:23:23] just like suppers and dinners and so
[1:23:25] forth to appropriate money he said
[1:23:26] that's not good way of doing it pay a
[1:23:28] tithe see that's what god wants you to
[1:23:29] do see just keep in god's program
[1:23:32] he'll bless the giver and so forth okay
[1:23:34] he promised it he said no so if we
[1:23:37] substitute something else
[1:23:39] just like we've substituted theology
[1:23:41] today to take the place of the baptism
[1:23:44] of the holy spirit he said it'll never
[1:23:46] work
[1:23:47] oh hallelujah it can't he said we've
[1:23:50] substituted multitudes instead of power
[1:23:53] he said but it will never take the place
[1:23:56] of power oh i want to say that again
[1:23:59] my my my maybe didn't get that
[1:24:01] hallelujah
[1:24:02] he said
[1:24:04] so if we substitute something else just
[1:24:05] like we've substituted theology today
[1:24:08] to take the place of the baptism of the
[1:24:11] holy ghost and fire the devil keeps
[1:24:13] fighting that you know
[1:24:15] he's fighting the holy spirit praise god
[1:24:17] because he knows the holy spirit the
[1:24:19] holy spirit is not something man could
[1:24:20] control
[1:24:21] oh isn't that right man can control his
[1:24:24] own thoughts his own ideas his own
[1:24:26] information his own thing and his own
[1:24:28] agenda and his own modus are parana and
[1:24:30] his own amen isn't that right he could
[1:24:32] control that but he can't control the
[1:24:33] holy spirit
[1:24:35] isn't that right no church can hold the
[1:24:37] holy spirit isn't that right glory to
[1:24:40] god hallelujah
[1:24:42] hallelujah holy spirit ain't stationed
[1:24:44] here somewhere praise god hallelujah
[1:24:46] like some kind of god booth or something
[1:24:48] no holy god moves where he wants to he
[1:24:51] moves in and out of his church
[1:24:52] manifesting himself moving in and out
[1:24:55] among us that will be the when we're
[1:24:56] worshiping the living christ oh
[1:24:58] hallelujah we just create a space we
[1:25:01] just create an atmosphere we just create
[1:25:03] an anointing we release our faith into
[1:25:06] the atmosphere and god fixing to move
[1:25:09] god who knows the end from the beginning
[1:25:11] who knows the condition of your heart
[1:25:13] can move in any time he wants to and
[1:25:16] heal the sick and raise the dead and
[1:25:18] cast out devils and help somebody and
[1:25:21] lift up somebody and rebuke and correct
[1:25:23] and chasten
[1:25:25] that's what the holy ghost was given for
[1:25:27] amen and amen isn't that right
[1:25:30] oh my
[1:25:33] it'll never work you can't substitute
[1:25:35] anything for it see
[1:25:37] the prophet said no other life will work
[1:25:38] in this bride oh glory to god that's
[1:25:41] that's it alone he said we've
[1:25:43] substituted multitudes instead of power
[1:25:45] it'll never take the place of power
[1:25:48] god is power
[1:25:50] he is the almighty god the power of all
[1:25:53] powers is god hey
[1:25:55] give him a shout of praise hallelujah
[1:25:58] glory to god he's a powerful powers oh
[1:26:01] he's anointing of all anointings oh he's
[1:26:03] a blessing of all blessings oh
[1:26:04] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[1:26:06] hallelujah he is god almighty
[1:26:09] amen he can't substitute it
[1:26:12] so we don't want to substitute this
[1:26:13] morning amen not a man made one we want
[1:26:16] the original we want what god has for us
[1:26:19] amen amen and nothing less isn't that
[1:26:21] right okay
[1:26:23] let me skip over to
[1:26:24] abraham and isaac
[1:26:27] let's look at this here
[1:26:28] after waiting 25 years for our son god
[1:26:30] said offer him up
[1:26:32] what was it a test on obedience isn't
[1:26:35] that right after waiting 25 years for
[1:26:38] this promised son
[1:26:40] isaac now god want to see if he would
[1:26:42] stay faithful to god's word amen
[1:26:45] regardless of the cause
[1:26:47] amen regardless of what it cost him
[1:26:49] isn't that right
[1:26:51] and
[1:26:51] you know we know that the story when
[1:26:53] they went up
[1:26:54] on the mountain
[1:26:55] as i spoke unto his father abraham said
[1:26:57] father i see the word
[1:26:59] i see everything set up the altar i see
[1:27:02] but i don't see a sacrifice
[1:27:05] isn't that right
[1:27:06] and abraham took his
[1:27:08] amen all right but god uh
[1:27:10] abraham talked to his
[1:27:12] son he said
[1:27:13] amen how did god provide for himself see
[1:27:16] a sacrifice oh hallelujah isn't that
[1:27:19] right and abraham took his own son bound
[1:27:21] him
[1:27:23] laid his son on the altar
[1:27:25] here was his only son
[1:27:27] abraham waited 25 years for this son
[1:27:31] and now he has to obey a commandment
[1:27:33] from god to offer him up this was a
[1:27:36] commandment offer up your son isaac that
[1:27:38] was what god spoke to him
[1:27:42] this was a word
[1:27:43] he might have wrestled with it
[1:27:45] he might have thought about it a long
[1:27:47] time
[1:27:48] but he knew it was the word of god and
[1:27:50] he received it as the word of god
[1:27:53] hallelujah and abraham in obedience
[1:27:56] went up that mountain
[1:27:58] with his son to offer him up praise god
[1:28:01] as the commandment of the lord oh is
[1:28:04] that right and he took his son
[1:28:07] his only son oh doesn't it sound
[1:28:09] familiar he took his son his only son
[1:28:14] and bound him quickly and laid him upon
[1:28:17] an altar and he took a knife
[1:28:19] oh abraham holding a knife in his hand
[1:28:22] oh just imagine it friends or just catch
[1:28:24] a vision of it abraham
[1:28:27] with the knife in his hand coming down
[1:28:28] you know what coming next

[1:28:32] next our sacrifice was coming next oh
[1:28:35] he's getting ready to offer him up oh i
[1:28:38] could imagine abraham holding his hand
[1:28:40] up there with the knife coming down
[1:28:42] praise god isaac with his eyes closed
[1:28:45] he'll know what's going to take place
[1:28:46] praise god hallelujah oh holy shut
[1:28:48] everything out abraham coming down
[1:28:50] hallelujah with the knights oh this hide
[1:28:53] too holy in the name of god hallelujah
[1:28:55] and he's coming down praise god and god
[1:28:57] come and break through the silence and
[1:28:59] say abraham abraham oh hold your hand
[1:29:03] praise god oh hallelujah what did god do
[1:29:07] he pushed abraham beyond the point of
[1:29:10] human limits abraham would made up his
[1:29:12] mind at that point in time that he was
[1:29:14] going to offer up his son and when god
[1:29:17] looked at abraham's heart he saw the
[1:29:20] obedience in that man and god had to do
[1:29:23] something
[1:29:24] oh
[1:29:25] hallelujah he said abraham because i
[1:29:28] know now
[1:29:29] that you love me
[1:29:31] oh and blessing i will bless thee and
[1:29:34] multiply and i multiply that seed oh
[1:29:36] hallelujah glory and thy seed shall
[1:29:39] possess the gate of his enemy oh because
[1:29:43] you are willing to go beyond human
[1:29:45] limits oh and offer up thy son thine
[1:29:48] only son or when abraham threw away the
[1:29:51] knife and he grabbed his son isaac oh
[1:29:53] and they hugged each other and cried
[1:29:55] they looked over into the corner and
[1:29:58] what did they see

[1:32:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:24] oh my my my my my
[1:32:28] hallelujah
[1:32:33] god provided a substitute
[1:32:36] and abraham called that place jehovah
[1:32:38] jairo the lord provided
[1:32:42] hallelujah glory to god
[1:32:44] isn't that right
[1:32:45] it was named
[1:32:47] jehovah jairo
[1:32:48] after the god i provided
[1:32:51] he provided all that you have needed of
[1:32:52] this morning
[1:32:54] whatever y'all need of he's already
[1:32:55] provided it oh he owns a cattle on a
[1:32:59] thousand hills
[1:33:00] oh my
[1:33:02] isn't that right
[1:33:04] hallelujah
[1:33:05] it's not right burnt offering isn't that
[1:33:08] right
[1:33:09] this was a substitute
[1:33:11] said now i've watched now the blood of
[1:33:13] bulls and goats and ashes and a heifer
[1:33:14] sprinkling
[1:33:16] unclean
[1:33:17] sprinkling to the unclean sandify to the
[1:33:19] praying of the flesh this is the
[1:33:20] scripture we read
[1:33:23] in hebrews
[1:33:26] uh sanctified to the purifying of the
[1:33:28] flesh
[1:33:29] well how much more shall the blood of
[1:33:30] christ
[1:33:31] who through the eternal spirit of
[1:33:33] offered himself
[1:33:35] without support to god
[1:33:36] purge your conscience from death
[1:33:39] from dead works
[1:33:40] to serve the living god
[1:33:42] isn't that right
[1:33:44] when israel is joining true wilderness
[1:33:45] we know the story that they were
[1:33:46] sacrificial lambs bulls
[1:33:49] goats etc that acted as a substitute
[1:33:53] for the sins of the people at that time
[1:33:56] and god accepted that until the perfect
[1:33:59] one could come forth isn't that right
[1:34:02] it's not right
[1:34:03] christ's death at calvary what was it it
[1:34:05] was our substitute
[1:34:06] it's not right yet he was the original
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:11] so that was god's original substitute
[1:34:13] that he sent from glory to take our
[1:34:15] place
[1:34:16] isn't that right prophet said on god's
[1:34:18] provided way
[1:34:20] 1953
[1:34:22] and paragraph 6 he says how that on
[1:34:25] one man the iniquity of all the world
[1:34:27] was laid
[1:34:29] all the sins all the sickness of all the
[1:34:31] everything that was wrong was laid upon
[1:34:34] that one sheep
[1:34:35] god's provided lamb
[1:34:37] and he took him up to calvary and
[1:34:38] crucified him to be the
[1:34:40] substitute for all wickedness
[1:34:43] oh mercy
[1:34:44] for our sins and our transgressions and
[1:34:47] all that we've done against god
[1:34:50] and all that we've done against
[1:34:51] ourselves and ever
[1:34:53] he was god's provided sacrifice for us
[1:34:56] god's provided away and now god has
[1:34:59] always had a way
[1:35:01] he's got to wait tonight
[1:35:02] and god always before he sends judgment
[1:35:06] he always makes a way of escape
[1:35:09] out of every trial amen
[1:35:11] god makes a way of escape isn't that
[1:35:14] right
[1:35:15] and god makes a way
[1:35:16] before he sends his judgment
[1:35:19] he said i might say first before he
[1:35:21] sends his judgment he always sends
[1:35:24] mercy
[1:35:25] hey
[1:35:26] isn't that right mercy said no
[1:35:29] oh
[1:35:30] i'm not gonna let you go
[1:35:32] not gonna let you slip away praise god
[1:35:34] hallelujah
[1:35:36] amen and sovereign grace hallelujah when
[1:35:39] love projected itself
[1:35:41] sovereign grace took over amen my
[1:35:44] stature of perfect man 1962
[1:35:46] here's the prophet speaking he said i
[1:35:48] pledged this morning praying at the end
[1:35:50] of the message day
[1:35:51] just read this out i just love what he
[1:35:52] said said i pledge this morning to him
[1:35:54] with all my heart watch that by his help
[1:35:57] and by his grace i pray
[1:35:59] that i'll seek daily without ceasing
[1:36:02] until i feel every one of those
[1:36:04] requirements flowing in this little old
[1:36:07] stature of mine
[1:36:08] till it can be a manifestation of the
[1:36:10] living christ
[1:36:12] for he became sin like me
[1:36:15] that i might become righteousness of god
[1:36:18] like him oh hallelujah isn't that right
[1:36:21] isn't that right he became sin like me
[1:36:23] that i may become righteousness of god
[1:36:24] like him watch prophet said he took my
[1:36:26] place lord
[1:36:28] let me take his now because that's the
[1:36:30] purpose he died for
[1:36:33] oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[1:36:37] man amen hallelujah glory to god isn't
[1:36:41] that right
[1:36:42] amen
[1:36:44] who is man or dog mindful of him amen
[1:36:47] hallelujah glory to god i remember the
[1:36:48] stephen he read that scripture this
[1:36:50] morning amen holly took our place who
[1:36:52] are we that he would take our place the
[1:36:55] sons and daughters of god amen amen he
[1:36:57] died for you he loved you before and
[1:37:00] because he first loved you he purchased
[1:37:02] your salvation on calvary's tree oh
[1:37:05] hallelujah oh that's enough that's
[1:37:07] enough is that not enough to love him i
[1:37:09] don't know what is praise god amen oh
[1:37:12] hallelujah amen and amen praise god
[1:37:16] amen just a few moments now i know time
[1:37:18] is running a few moments here now saul
[1:37:21] was anointed king now watch
[1:37:24] look at this substitute here now
[1:37:26] now here's the negative side of it
[1:37:28] so when the prophet samuel heard the
[1:37:30] moments of the people isn't that right
[1:37:33] even
[1:37:34] uh and then all the elders of israel got
[1:37:36] it themselves together came to samuel
[1:37:38] unto rama
[1:37:39] and said unto him behold our old thy
[1:37:42] sons walk not in thy ways isn't that
[1:37:44] right and now make us a king to judge us
[1:37:46] like all the nations isn't that right
[1:37:49] and this thing plea this please samuel
[1:37:51] and when they said give us a king to
[1:37:53] judge us
[1:37:54] and samuel prayed unto the lord
[1:37:58] and the lord said unto samuel
[1:38:00] hearken unto the voice of the people in
[1:38:03] all that they say unto thee oh my
[1:38:05] for they have not rejected thee
[1:38:08] but they have rejected me
[1:38:11] that i should reign over them
[1:38:13] oh
[1:38:14] my god hallelujah isn't that right so he
[1:38:16] says according to all the works which
[1:38:18] they have done since the day that i have
[1:38:20] brought them out of egypt so god is
[1:38:21] recall we're calling now
[1:38:23] yeah it's not right all that he has done
[1:38:25] for the people even unto this day i call
[1:38:28] him out of egypt wherewith they have
[1:38:30] forsaken me
[1:38:32] and served other gods so do they also
[1:38:36] unto thee it was rejection
[1:38:39] amen isn't that right
[1:38:41] the people rejected the leadership of
[1:38:44] god at that time and god felt that
[1:38:46] rejection
[1:38:47] amen amen because he no longer wanted
[1:38:50] the word of the prophet unto them or the
[1:38:53] word of the lord unto them but they
[1:38:55] wanted their own thing
[1:38:57] amen they wanted fig leaves let's call
[1:39:00] it that amen my
[1:39:02] he said now therefore hearken unto their
[1:39:04] voice how be thee protest solemnly unto
[1:39:07] them and show them the man of the king
[1:39:10] that shall reign over them and samuel
[1:39:12] told all the words of the lord unto the
[1:39:14] people that asked of him a king
[1:39:17] oh isn't that right
[1:39:19] my god hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[1:39:21] right
[1:39:22] glory to god
[1:39:24] and
[1:39:25] look at this here now the same spirit
[1:39:27] here now upon the people rejection
[1:39:29] is that right
[1:39:31] is a human is a human trait now
[1:39:33] is our human
[1:39:35] behavior that just keeps coming out it's
[1:39:36] all over the bible here
[1:39:38] see watch we can see that same spirit
[1:39:40] now here the people can also be seen in
[1:39:42] the wilderness when the people was
[1:39:43] brought to the mountain isn't that right
[1:39:45] and god went up there to hear from the
[1:39:47] lord people began to murmur
[1:39:49] isn't that right when the people saw
[1:39:51] that moses delayed to come down from the
[1:39:53] mount
[1:39:54] amen written exodus here the the people
[1:39:57] gathered themselves exodus 32
[1:39:59] uh the people guiding themselves out
[1:40:00] onto aaron and said unto him
[1:40:03] up
[1:40:04] said azan rise get up make us gods isn't
[1:40:07] that right we shall go before us as for
[1:40:10] uh for as this
[1:40:12] for us for this moses the man that
[1:40:14] brought us about the land of egypt we
[1:40:16] what not what has become of him you know
[1:40:18] those we don't know where he is or
[1:40:19] what's going on so we need a god we want
[1:40:22] to worship a god make us something yo
[1:40:25] you call yourself a priest do something
[1:40:26] make something isn't that right
[1:40:29] and everyone said unto them break off
[1:40:31] the golden earrings which are in the
[1:40:33] ears of your wives of your sons and your
[1:40:34] daughters
[1:40:37] bringing them unto me isn't that right
[1:40:39] and all the people break off their
[1:40:40] golden earrings which were in their ears
[1:40:42] and brought them onto aaron and he
[1:40:44] received them under their hand and
[1:40:46] fashioned it with a graving tool after
[1:40:48] he had made it in a molten calf and they
[1:40:51] said peas be thy gods oh israel
[1:40:54] see the spirit
[1:40:55] same spirit here now
[1:40:57] rejecting the leadership of the holy
[1:40:59] spirit and taking a substitute taking
[1:41:02] something else that brought the other
[1:41:03] land of egypt is that right and when
[1:41:05] aaron saw it he built an altar
[1:41:07] and aaron made proclamation and said
[1:41:09] tomorrow shall be a feast of the lord
[1:41:11] and so forth isn't that right
[1:41:14] now here hear this kicker now
[1:41:16] and the lord said unto moses he said go
[1:41:19] get thee down watch for thy people which
[1:41:21] thou brought out of the land of egypt
[1:41:23] have corrupted themselves
[1:41:25] they have turned aside quickly out of
[1:41:27] the way which i commanded them they have
[1:41:30] made them a molten calf i worship him so
[1:41:32] god see everything
[1:41:33] just because
[1:41:35] you not seeing
[1:41:37] doesn't mean that god doesn't see
[1:41:39] he is not right he sees in the secret
[1:41:41] place
[1:41:42] amen isn't that right the god that seeth
[1:41:45] in secret
[1:41:46] oh he knows what you're doing isn't that
[1:41:48] right my they've turned aside quickly
[1:41:50] watch they made a molten calf they
[1:41:52] worship it and sacrificed there unto and
[1:41:54] said these be thy gods oh israel which
[1:41:56] have brought thee up out of the land of
[1:41:57] egypt and the lord said unto moses i
[1:42:00] have seen this people and behold it is a
[1:42:03] stiff-necked people
[1:42:05] oh my god hallelujah are stiff-necked
[1:42:08] people or what

[1:42:11] it sounds familiar right now let's get
[1:42:14] over to accent number seven and 51.

[1:42:18] rebuking the people is now right
[1:42:21] uh in that day stephen rose up isn't
[1:42:23] that right just before he was killed
[1:42:25] huh and he said recalling the spirit of
[1:42:28] god is upon him he's preaching to the
[1:42:30] people rebuking the people and god is
[1:42:32] recalling this very incident here praise
[1:42:34] god hallelujah in the wilderness he said
[1:42:36] watch he said ye stiff neck and
[1:42:38] uncircumcised in heart and heirs
[1:42:41] ye do always resist the holy ghost as so
[1:42:45] your father's dead so do you
[1:42:47] hey

[1:42:50] today
[1:42:51] stiffness praise god i don't want to
[1:42:54] listen praise god they're abstinent
[1:42:56] praise god they want their own way
[1:42:59] they prefer fake leaves and become god's
[1:43:02] provided way
[1:43:03] but they prefer to take a substitute
[1:43:06] praise god hallelujah isn't that right
[1:43:08] my
[1:43:11] amen and amen
[1:43:14] my my my glory to god honestly is that
[1:43:17] something isn't that right
[1:43:19] huh
[1:43:19] it's a human behavior see human nature
[1:43:24] prophet said i am my biggest enemy me
[1:43:27] william branham not anybody else
[1:43:30] i've got to get
[1:43:32] myself out of the way if i get william
[1:43:34] branham out of the way
[1:43:35] amen then god could move then the sick
[1:43:38] would be healed then the blind could see
[1:43:39] it in a crippled walk then the gospel
[1:43:41] could be preaching his power when i get
[1:43:44] out of the way
[1:43:45] or what an example for amen for us to
[1:43:47] look at hallelujah and if he had to get
[1:43:49] out of the way how much more you and i
[1:43:52] have to get out of the way
[1:43:53] oh hallelujah allah overt brings it out
[1:43:56] he says you don't want anything to
[1:43:58] hinder the flow of god in your life
[1:44:01] there should be no obstacles amen in the
[1:44:03] pipeline to hinder the flow of god so
[1:44:06] that you could become a direct channel
[1:44:09] for inspiration and communications of
[1:44:12] god that god could speak through you
[1:44:15] amen to the people and be a reflection
[1:44:19] of his perfection of his holiness
[1:44:21] in this hour and this time that we're
[1:44:23] living in oh my isn't that right
[1:44:26] it's not right
[1:44:28] stiff neck
[1:44:30] they say that that saying comes from
[1:44:33] dealing with cattle
[1:44:34] you know oxen and different things no
[1:44:36] right just like elisha
[1:44:38] used to drive the oxen before elijah
[1:44:40] come and drop the mantle upon him he
[1:44:42] used to drive oxen that was elijah
[1:44:44] elisha's
[1:44:46] occupation
[1:44:47] isn't that right till the soil till the
[1:44:49] land and when you're prime when you're
[1:44:51] prodding the cattle
[1:44:52] say sometimes you're probably cattle or
[1:44:54] the ox goal isn't that right prodding
[1:44:55] the cattle keeping it going
[1:44:57] and he said sometimes they call it stiff
[1:44:58] neck because the ox sometimes just
[1:45:00] doesn't want to do the work somebody
[1:45:02] just doesn't want to go in the direction
[1:45:04] that you're going they're trying to tell
[1:45:05] it to sometimes the goal is there to
[1:45:07] prob them keep them going keep them in
[1:45:10] line keep them straight on the word
[1:45:13] isn't that right you've got to stay on
[1:45:16] the word
[1:45:17] anything else is just a substitute oh
[1:45:20] it's not the real thing yet but you've
[1:45:22] got to stay on the course
[1:45:24] two degrees off and you'll find yourself
[1:45:26] way out back somewhere praise god plumb
[1:45:30] off holiday believing on something else
[1:45:32] instead of the lord jesus christ stay
[1:45:34] with that word oh keep your eye on the
[1:45:38] prize oh no wonder elisha was so focused
[1:45:42] he spent all his life training for this
[1:45:44] moment to keep his eye on the oxen now
[1:45:47] he was keeping his eye on the prophet oh
[1:45:49] everywhere the prophet go he was
[1:45:51] following everywhere elijah go he was
[1:45:53] following you stay here at gilgal stay
[1:45:54] here in battle hallelujah pray but he
[1:45:56] had a revelation something told him his
[1:45:59] experience told him i got to stay
[1:46:02] with this man he's got the thing i need
[1:46:05] he's got what i need praise god i don't
[1:46:08] care how far i don't care how long i
[1:46:10] have to walk i don't care how long i
[1:46:12] have to go i'll not be stiff neck praise

[1:46:18] i'm turning left if you turn right i'm
[1:46:19] turning right but i got my eye on him oh

[1:46:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:26] glory to god hey many many man
[1:46:30] hallelujah
[1:46:32] see
[1:46:34] stephen wasn't there
[1:46:36] when god spoke to moses but that same
[1:46:37] spirit was upon him rebuking the people
[1:46:41] stiff night
[1:46:42] uncircumcised of ears and heart
[1:46:45] resisting the holy spirit
[1:46:47] isn't that right and so they do today
[1:46:50] resisting the true holy spirit when it
[1:46:52] comes the spirit of truth
[1:46:55] guiding us into all truth
[1:46:57] god promised that he would send another
[1:46:58] comforter amen amen isn't that right
[1:47:02] what better praise god comforted on the
[1:47:04] holy spirit himself
[1:47:06] amen
[1:47:08] he couldn't be here in that literal way
[1:47:10] christ was to come again but he sent his
[1:47:12] holy spirit here
[1:47:14] in your hearts
[1:47:15] as an earnest of the expectation of his
[1:47:17] second coming oh hallelujah before he
[1:47:20] that while he comes while he's on his
[1:47:21] way we have the holy spirit our comfort
[1:47:24] oh how to keep us
[1:47:25] to show us what to do isn't that right
[1:47:28] hallelujah in our hearts
[1:47:30] in our lives as paul said seal with that
[1:47:32] holy spirit of promise o hallelujah
[1:47:35] glory to god isn't that right
[1:47:37] my
[1:47:38] they had that same covering
[1:47:40] the people at that time pharisees

[1:47:52] sons and daughters
[1:47:53] oh my man-made teachings dogmas
[1:47:56] doctrines
[1:47:57] rejecting the holy spirit

[1:48:39] new comment oh hallelujah so do you have

[1:49:45] let's behold him
[1:49:46] oh hallelujah shed all our rights away
[1:49:50] in this world of sin
[1:49:52] oh hallelujah are you needy of him this
[1:49:54] morning hey man amen
[1:49:56] these are the things that make us feel
[1:49:58] safe
[1:49:59] make us feel secure and that's a
[1:50:01] dangerous feeling
[1:50:02] because king yuzaya once felt that
[1:50:04] feeling this feeling of self-secure this
[1:50:06] feeling of of nobody could tell me what
[1:50:08] to do because he was so obstinate when
[1:50:10] he went into the temple going to offer
[1:50:12] up going off up incense and stuff isn't
[1:50:14] that right and the priest picked him
[1:50:15] don't do it don't do it don't do it you
[1:50:17] went in there anyway and what happened
[1:50:19] got struck
[1:50:20] down isn't that right oh my
[1:50:23] hallelujah
[1:50:24] and when he died hallelujah it shook
[1:50:27] isaiah the prophet at that time is that
[1:50:29] right
[1:50:30] hallelujah because he was leaning on
[1:50:32] king uzziah oh such a blessed and
[1:50:34] wonderful man but even the greatest of
[1:50:36] them fall sometimes or you better be
[1:50:39] leaning on christ
[1:50:40] put not your trust in the legs of a man
[1:50:43] or in a prince where there is no help
[1:50:45] but our eyes look towards the hills from
[1:50:47] where comet or help david said my help
[1:50:50] cometh from the lord not even the hills
[1:50:52] could help me but there's a god out
[1:50:54] there somewhere who's greater than them
[1:50:56] hills greater than the mountains oh
[1:50:59] isn't that right
[1:51:02] david when he looked towards the hills
[1:51:04] from whence commented help it had
[1:51:06] enemies behind them hills
[1:51:08] it had enemies behind their mountains
[1:51:11] waiting to take the kingdom any time
[1:51:13] israel slipped them fellows running down
[1:51:14] take over
[1:51:16] david said look to the hills won't come
[1:51:18] with my help praise god my enemies are
[1:51:20] watching me praise god dying night and
[1:51:22] day looking to see me fall looking to
[1:51:24] make a snare to make a trap for me
[1:51:26] praise god hallelujah hallelujah where's
[1:51:28] my help coming from oh holla there's
[1:51:30] something beyond there brother there's
[1:51:32] someone beyond them skies something
[1:51:34] beyond the blue hallelujah hallelujah
[1:51:36] that's keeping you that's holding the
[1:51:38] reins
[1:51:39] oh that will not let you fall praise god
[1:51:41] amen
[1:51:42] oh my
[1:51:44] praise god do you love him today
[1:51:46] praise god that's what people hide
[1:51:48] behind don't let me finish i'm almost
[1:51:50] finished anyway
[1:51:52] musician could get ready
[1:51:55] coverings
[1:51:57] hiding behind some concept of god
[1:52:00] some idea their own
[1:52:03] interpretation
[1:52:04] instead of seeing it the way god sees it
[1:52:07] the scripture that says there's a way
[1:52:09] that's seamed right onto a man
[1:52:11] but here is death
[1:52:13] now that scripture is a really serious
[1:52:15] scripture
[1:52:17] because it's such a thin line
[1:52:19] because you see we interpret things in
[1:52:21] our natural way
[1:52:22] they're things that seem right
[1:52:25] it feel okay to do this it seems right
[1:52:28] sometimes it's legitimate things
[1:52:31] that choke the plant
[1:52:33] that it would not be afford fruit in its
[1:52:35] time
[1:52:37] it's legitimate cares of this life that
[1:52:39] they allow to grow up like little weeds
[1:52:42] then they become big wheats then they
[1:52:44] become vines
[1:52:46] then they choke the plant what's taking
[1:52:48] place they're allowed to grow take over
[1:52:50] oh holla isn't that right
[1:52:53] isn't that right you got to pluck those
[1:52:54] things up friends
[1:52:55] praise god hallelujah and keep your
[1:52:57] ground fertile isn't that right praise
[1:53:00] god in the word of god all right
[1:53:03] revelation 13 6 8
[1:53:07] 16 to 8 rather revelation 13 16 to 8
[1:53:10] and the scripture says he calls it all
[1:53:12] both small and great rich and poor free
[1:53:15] and born
[1:53:16] to receive a mark in their right hand
[1:53:18] talking about
[1:53:19] the mark of the beast isn't that right i
[1:53:21] know therefore in their foreheads
[1:53:23] and that no man might buy or sell save
[1:53:26] he that had that mark
[1:53:27] or the name of the beast and the number
[1:53:29] of his name here is wisdom
[1:53:32] let him that half understanding count
[1:53:34] the number of the beast
[1:53:35] for it is the number of a man and a
[1:53:37] number
[1:53:38] his number is 600 three score and six
[1:53:41] isn't that right
[1:53:42] the antichrist friends
[1:53:44] will be christ replaced
[1:53:46] by an image
[1:53:47] isn't that right by organized religion
[1:53:50] it's not the seal of satan praise god
[1:53:53] the mark of the beast is actually a
[1:53:55] substitute
[1:53:56] that the people take in place of the
[1:53:58] holy ghost
[1:53:59] so by rejecting the holy spirit you take
[1:54:02] this mark
[1:54:03] automatically the mark of the beast the
[1:54:05] prophet brought out that you had to
[1:54:07] reject that holy spirit in order to take
[1:54:08] that man isn't that right there's no
[1:54:10] other option for the seal of god tonight
[1:54:13] praise god and the market of beasts so
[1:54:15] instead of a covering of the holy spirit
[1:54:17] amen like what adam had before the fall
[1:54:20] this is what we're supposed to receive
[1:54:21] in the end here now amen god's gonna
[1:54:23] have a true church oh they're covering
[1:54:26] the anointing the holy spirit true holy
[1:54:28] spirit works praise god the rainbow
[1:54:31] flashing of glory of spring all around
[1:54:34] us praise god that's what we're to
[1:54:35] receive
[1:54:36] and if you don't have that
[1:54:38] then what you end up with
[1:54:40] is a bi-product
[1:54:41] amen it's a man-made covering a hybrid
[1:54:44] theory praise god fig leaves all over
[1:54:46] again
[1:54:47] oh my my my my
[1:54:50] isn't that right
[1:54:52] glory to god hallelujah so i'm getting
[1:54:54] ready to wind up i am the resurrection
[1:54:56] of life 1952. the prophet said now the
[1:54:59] ministers of them they said now well
[1:55:01] he's a psychiatrist
[1:55:02] he's a mind reader he reads your mind
[1:55:04] that's how he knows what's wrong with
[1:55:06] them and them people i guess you're
[1:55:07] talking about brother branham's ministry
[1:55:09] here and he said he reads your mind see
[1:55:11] he did
[1:55:13] he said prophet said but jesus was a
[1:55:15] mind reader
[1:55:16] he said that shocked you didn't it yeah
[1:55:18] he was
[1:55:19] he perceived their thoughts is that
[1:55:21] right
[1:55:22] he said well that's
[1:55:23] what what's mine reading he said well
[1:55:25] not one of these
[1:55:26] setting out here one of these little
[1:55:28] women
[1:55:29] uh sitting around the corner reading the
[1:55:31] palm of your hand
[1:55:32] he said that's what the substitute the
[1:55:34] devil's got
[1:55:35] something to maintain imitate it
[1:55:37] he said that's the bogus dollar but to
[1:55:40] the real dollar is that right so prophet
[1:55:42] said here everything god has done
[1:55:45] the devil has made a substitute for it
[1:55:48] made something bogus see
[1:55:50] and that's the reason these two spirits
[1:55:52] in the last days come right along
[1:55:54] they'll be formal and fundamental
[1:55:57] they'll miss the spirit altogether oh
[1:55:59] mercy
[1:56:00] you see like that
[1:56:02] and some of these on the radical side go
[1:56:04] plum off into isms with it
[1:56:06] oh but right in the middle of the road
[1:56:09] runs the true church of god amen
[1:56:13] standing in the full power of god amen
[1:56:17] that is where it's at
[1:56:20] not off to the side somewhere not up to
[1:56:22] this fanaticism but right plum down the
[1:56:24] middle stay with god amen hallelujah
[1:56:28] staying with that word hallelujah and
[1:56:30] god continuing in her amen he's voicing
[1:56:33] you the voice of the archangel for this
[1:56:35] day isn't that right
[1:56:37] why is it that so many christians find
[1:56:38] it hard to live the christian life 1957
[1:56:40] this is my last quote here and i'm
[1:56:41] finished
[1:56:43] he said listen friends let me tell you
[1:56:44] this
[1:56:46] he said now why
[1:56:47] take a substitute
[1:56:50] when the pentecostal skies are loaded
[1:56:53] with the real thing
[1:56:55] he said why try to lay
[1:56:57] upon some fantastic
[1:57:00] he said why try to rely upon some little
[1:57:03] emotion
[1:57:04] oh hallelujah glory to god why try to to
[1:57:07] lay upon that
[1:57:09] isn't that right people get so caught up
[1:57:10] in little things
[1:57:12] people get so caught up in in their own
[1:57:14] imagination and their own idea of how
[1:57:16] things supposed to be
[1:57:17] rather than getting caught up in the
[1:57:19] program of god
[1:57:21] that god has for your life
[1:57:23] that god wants from you
[1:57:25] he wants her to surrender he wants a
[1:57:27] desire oh hallelujah
[1:57:30] he wants something from you today holy a
[1:57:33] full surrender oh hallelujah you got to
[1:57:35] break down
[1:57:37] hallelujah hallelujah god's got to
[1:57:39] renovate you over

[1:57:44] from with isaac over behold i make all
[1:57:45] things new

[1:59:01] prophesy in part but when that which is
[1:59:03] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:59:06] part will be done away which oh and this
[1:59:08] mortal will put on immortality and in a
[1:59:11] moment and in a twinkling of an eye this

[2:00:58] fantastics
[2:01:00] why try to rely on some little emotion
[2:01:02] or some little something
[2:01:04] that's nothing to when the pentecostal
[2:01:07] skies the real pentecostal skies are
[2:01:09] just crowded with the real thing he says
[2:01:12] don't take a substitute
[2:01:14] when you can get the real

[2:01:59] pentecost don't mean altogether
[2:02:01] foursquare pentecost is not a
[2:02:02] denomination he said it's an experience

[2:02:07] experience that constrained you to the
[2:02:10] love of god
[2:02:12] he said and then what is these other
[2:02:14] things
[2:02:15] he said his attributes
[2:02:17] apples that fall off the tree see
[2:02:19] he said but but don't get the apple
[2:02:21] before the tree
[2:02:23] he said get the tree
[2:02:24] and then it'll bear the apples hey
[2:02:28] and that's what we want today god is
[2:02:30] driving us back to the tree of life

[2:02:34] signs will follow isn't that right oh
[2:02:36] you can have all the signs and
[2:02:38] fantastics you want

[2:02:48] something that fell off the tree but get
[2:02:49] the tree first he says
[2:02:51] and it will bear itself
[2:02:54] but if your tree isn't yielding these
[2:02:55] things there's something wrong that's
[2:02:57] right he said this is what you want
[2:03:01] that original tree amen amen oh i'm
