[12:35] things he has done great
[12:41] things bless His
[12:52] World Anthony thank you so much let's
[12:55] bow our heads for word a prayer Heavenly
[12:58] Father we thank you
[12:59] for this grace and opportunity that you
[13:01] given unto us to call upon your name and
[13:04] to approach your throne you're Sovereign
[13:06] in your ways in your word in your works
[13:09] and father there's nothing hindering you
[13:11] for cleansing forgiving breaking bounds
[13:13] of wickedness evil delivering restoring
[13:16] healing baptizing you are God and God
[13:19] alone and I pray come on in a special
[13:21] name and minister to your people right
[13:22] in your homes that your spirit will take
[13:25] a hold upon them their mind their
[13:26] thoughts their actions their attitudes
[13:29] your words Grant it Lord in Jesus name I
[13:31] ask it amen and amen God bless you and
[13:35] thank you all for being here tonight and
[13:37] we want to see what the Lord will do uh
[13:40] so if you have your Bibles IID like to
[13:42] look at Matthew chapter
[13:44] 6 The Book of Matthew chapter 6 and I
[13:47] have taught tonight seek ye first the
[13:50] kingdom of God but this first is
[13:54] actually speaking also about putting God
[13:56] first seeky first the kingdom of God and
[14:00] this is Jesus speaking now we talk about
[14:03] things pertaining to life and godliness
[14:05] if there's a chapter that really speaks
[14:08] to that is this this is a a Living Word
[14:12] a living gospel and Jesus is detailing
[14:17] it here take heed that you do not your
[14:20] arm for men to be seen of them otherwise
[14:25] you have no reward of your father which
[14:28] is in heaven so what he is saying here
[14:31] is that you have to get the
[14:32] Consciousness or the
[14:34] awareness that there is a higher level a
[14:39] level be beyond the eyes of man you know
[14:42] where there are issues you have your
[14:44] Viewpoint you have your words you have
[14:47] your
[14:47] thoughts and I may have my viewpoint my
[14:50] words my thoughts but I want you to
[14:53] consider there a third person so I could
[14:56] think a certain thing I could feel a
[14:57] certain thing but that third person is
[14:59] God and sometime the question we have to
[15:02] ask ourselves is how does God see it how
[15:06] does God see attitudes and ways and
[15:09] behavior how does he see it so Jesus
[15:13] saying
[15:14] specifically you have to be conscious
[15:17] that your reward is from your father
[15:19] which is in heaven verse two he went
[15:21] down deeper therefore when thou doest
[15:24] arms now this is natural thing some
[15:27] people they don't like to give they're
[15:30] very selfish so they have no arms to do
[15:32] they want to get their whole life story
[15:36] is can you help me I need help they
[15:39] don't seek to help others but listen to
[15:40] this when thou doest thine arms do not s
[15:45] a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites
[15:47] do in the synagogues and in the streets
[15:50] that they may have the glory of men here
[15:52] we go again so Jesus talk about
[15:54] practical living practical doing but who
[15:57] you're doing it for and how you doing it
[16:00] that they have the glory of men verily I
[16:02] say unto you they have their reward but
[16:05] when thou doest arm so just think he's
[16:08] making a distinction let not thy left
[16:11] hand know what thy right hand doth here
[16:14] the purpose that thy arms may be in
[16:18] secret and thy father which seat in
[16:21] secret himself shall reward you openly
[16:25] so what he is sharing here is uh higher
[16:30] consciousness of another eye that is
[16:32] watching us and that we are not to look
[16:35] to the eyes of men but to the eyes of
[16:39] God as Isaac but Isaac spoke sometime
[16:42] where he said that there there should be
[16:44] no Christian of a poor testimony of work
[16:47] ethic on their jobs because they're
[16:49] supposed to be operating and reflecting
[16:52] God's kingdom verse five when thou
[16:55] prayest that's what we're going to do
[16:57] tonight thou shal not be as Hypocrites
[17:00] for they love to pray standing in the
[17:04] synagogues and in the corners of the
[17:06] streets that they be seen of men verily
[17:10] they have their reward so he's not
[17:12] saying they will not have their reward
[17:14] no they have award but here we go
[17:17] speaking about you now when thou prayest
[17:20] enter into thy closet and when thou has
[17:23] shut thy door pray to thy father which
[17:27] he in secret and thy father with SE in
[17:30] secret shall reward the
[17:31] open now watch so he come again to show
[17:35] you God Consciousness God awareness God
[17:38] presence but then he wants to detail
[17:41] know how to pray what type of prayer
[17:45] when he pray verse seven use not vain
[17:48] repetitions as a hidden do why would
[17:51] they use V repetitions to make their
[17:53] prayer long so when they in public they
[17:57] have the long long long prayer prayer I
[17:59] don't know if it impresses people that
[18:01] you're prayer Warrior long long drawn
[18:04] out prayer but the thing about it Jesus
[18:06] prayed all night so what I am seeing is
[18:10] that your long
[18:12] prayer in your closet or on the mountain
[18:18] or apart makes effective your short
[18:22] prayer in public all right let's
[18:24] continue now when you pray use not vain
[18:28] reputation as the Heen do for they think
[18:31] that they shall be heard for their much
[18:35] speaking but be not like unto them here
[18:38] we go for your father knoweth what
[18:41] things you have need of before you ask
[18:44] him and after this manner therefore pray
[18:47] ye this is where he taught them Our
[18:50] Father which are in heaven you could say
[18:52] you could say together with me Our
[18:54] Father which are in heaven Hallowed be
[18:56] thy name thy kingdom come
[18:59] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[19:03] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[19:07] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[19:09] our debtors and lead us not into
[19:12] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[19:15] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[19:19] the glory forever amen now when Jesus
[19:22] completed his prayer he went back to
[19:26] forgiveness in verse 14 for if you
[19:28] forgive men their trespasses your
[19:32] heavenly father will also forgive you so
[19:34] he was clearly stating there'll be
[19:37] issues there'll be challenges brother
[19:40] brother brother sister father mother
[19:42] church members whatever pastor
[19:44] congregation whatever and he says now if
[19:47] you forgive men their trespasses your
[19:49] heavenly father will forgive you now
[19:51] this is Jesus own
[19:53] words verse 15 but if you forgive not
[19:57] men the trespasses your sins are on you
[20:00] neither will your father forgive your
[20:02] trespasses there are people who have a
[20:04] and grudges their sins are not forgiven
[20:07] their prayer is not being answered
[20:09] because the only prayer God could answer
[20:11] from a sinner is I Repent God not
[20:14] hearing sin a prayer wasting time total
[20:16] waste of time because in that sinful
[20:19] condition you can't really approach God
[20:20] the only thing God will accept and he
[20:23] doesn't have to accept it because Esau
[20:25] sought God and seed with delion with
[20:27] prayers and he couldn't find that P of
[20:28] repentance so we could seek God but God
[20:31] have to accept our repentance and then
[20:33] from there we could offer up other
[20:35] prayer now he went down to what we did
[20:38] today verse 16 moreover when you fast be
[20:42] not as Hypocrites or sad countenance for
[20:44] they disfigure their faces that they may
[20:46] appear onto men to fast they want people
[20:49] to see how holy how righteous how
[20:52] spiritual whatever in other words men
[20:54] pleases them verily i s to you they have
[20:57] their reward so he's not challenging or
[21:00] questioning the blessing that they will
[21:01] get for what they're doing in mechanics
[21:04] but th so he's classifying you as the
[21:07] elect you are the bread but thou when th
[21:10] fastest anoint thine head wash thy face
[21:13] that thou appear not unto men to fast
[21:16] but unto thy father which is in secret
[21:18] and thy father which see in secret shall
[21:21] reward thee opening so it's evident that
[21:24] somebody that pleases God somebody
[21:27] that's putting God first that person it
[21:31] will be evident of the hand and the
[21:33] blessings of God upon their lives Jesus
[21:36] been a little deeper he's drilling down
[21:38] this was a this is a mighty mighty uh
[21:40] message um that he's presenting here in
[21:43] verse
[21:43] 19 so he talk about prayer talk about
[21:47] fasting he's talk about giving arms and
[21:50] then he's checking out our desires now
[21:53] what do we want what do you have in your
[21:56] heart verse 19 lay not up for yourselves
[21:59] Treasures upon the Earth where Mor and
[22:02] rust that corrupt and where thieves
[22:04] break through and steal so if you stop
[22:07] right there and he talk about lay not up
[22:10] for yourself Treasures on the earth that
[22:12] mean there are Treasures elsewhere so
[22:15] Treasures are not just Earth or Earthly
[22:18] Treasures he is saying okay guy they
[22:22] have Treasures here but I want to tell
[22:23] you about a different treasure this
[22:25] treasure on Earth Mor than rust is
[22:27] corrupt and if you have it theves could
[22:29] break through and steal verse 20 but lay
[22:31] up for yourself Treasures in Heaven
[22:34] where neither Mor nor rust that corrupt
[22:36] and where thieves do not break through
[22:38] no steal now the service on Wednesday
[22:40] night I read the scripture where Jesus
[22:42] spoke about I was hungry and you didn't
[22:44] feed me I was sick and you didn't visit
[22:46] me and and all this stuff and they say
[22:48] where when were you hungry when were you
[22:50] sick when were you in prison he say as
[22:53] as you have done this to the least of my
[22:54] little ones you have done it unto me so
[22:57] the thing of it is this
[22:59] how do we lay up Treasures in Heaven he
[23:02] said but lay up for yourself Treasures
[23:04] in Heaven where neither Mort nor rust
[23:06] that corrupt and where tees do not break
[23:09] through nor steal listen the unbelieving
[23:12] person who treat the elect right with
[23:15] honor and respect because they love the
[23:18] Saints they may not be as sined
[23:19] themselves they may not repent they may
[23:21] never even come to church but because
[23:23] they see you and they love you they love
[23:25] your Christian testimony imagine they
[23:29] are going to be rewarded with eternal
[23:32] life and there are those people
[23:34] hypocritical as ever they'll be
[23:36] separated and
[23:38] sent that is how this treasure is so
[23:42] great then Jesus cap it off with for
[23:45] where your treasure
[23:46] is there will your heart be also if your
[23:50] treasure is money you're after that you
[23:52] put money have children money front the
[23:54] church ahead of the church ahead of God
[23:57] you put money you put you know that's
[23:59] your God that what you're worshiping
[24:00] ready the loot the money S as ever you
[24:04] will share because this is your god you
[24:06] keeping your God intact where your
[24:08] treasure is there will your heart be
[24:11] also so if your treasure is in God if
[24:14] your treasure is considering the Holy
[24:16] Ghost if your treasure is Con in
[24:18] connected with righteousness and
[24:19] Holiness and Purity that is where your
[24:21] heart will be Jesus went down deeper so
[24:24] this is not as we say the Thunders that
[24:27] do shake the devil this one that shake
[24:28] them he said the light of the body is
[24:30] the eye if therefore thy eye be single
[24:34] thy whole body shall be full of light
[24:36] but if thy eye be evil thy whole body
[24:39] shall be full of darkness and if
[24:41] therefore the light that is in thee be
[24:43] Darkness how great is that darkness and
[24:47] we know that the devil used to the iate
[24:50] to take a hold of your mind but God used
[24:53] the heart because that's where the god
[24:55] control tower is the sense of Fai Jesus
[24:58] drilling down further no man can serve
[25:00] two Ms for either will hate one or love
[25:03] the other or else he will hold to one
[25:06] and despise the other you cannot serve
[25:09] God and Mammon you cannot be in between
[25:12] you get squeezed you get killed
[25:14] therefore practical living I say unto
[25:17] you take no thought for your
[25:20] life why are people so stressed out
[25:24] pressed out take it talk for your life
[25:26] God never leave you to be out shelter
[25:29] never leave you without a place to lay
[25:31] on and food and everything else and
[25:32] you're still worried like if he has not
[25:35] been there or he has been faithful take
[25:38] no thought for your life may God Inspire
[25:42] this to you tonight take no thought for
[25:45] your life what you shall eat what you
[25:47] shall drink nor yet for your body what
[25:50] you shall put on is not life more than
[25:52] meat and the body more than arment
[25:55] behold the fs of the air they so neither
[25:58] do they reap nor GA into bands yet
[26:01] Heavenly Father feeded them are you not
[26:04] better than they which of you taking
[26:07] thought can add one cubit onto a statue
[26:11] so thinking doesn't produce it thinking
[26:14] doesn't act to you you could think that
[26:17] you're going to lose weight and that's
[26:18] just your thoughts until you act and get
[26:20] the thing right then you will lose
[26:22] weight you think you're going to get a
[26:23] job and you're stay in home job not
[26:25] coming to the roof you have to apply you
[26:27] have to press you have to fight your way
[26:29] through isn't that right so watch and
[26:32] why take each thought for reignment 28
[26:34] consider the leave of the field or they
[26:36] grow they to not you do they spin they
[26:39] say unto you that Solomon in all his
[26:40] glory not a way like one of these
[26:43] wherefore if God and this is the
[26:46] comparon this is Jesus the greatest
[26:48] teacher on Earth if God so clothe the
[26:51] grass of the field which today is and
[26:53] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[26:56] not much more clothe you over you have
[26:59] little fi therefore take no thought
[27:02] saying what shall we eat that shouldn't
[27:04] come out your mouth what shall we drink
[27:06] that shouldn't come out your mouth where
[27:08] shall we be clothed those words
[27:10] shouldn't come out your mouth for after
[27:12] all these things do the Gentiles seek in
[27:14] other words the unbelievers talk that
[27:17] talk but your heavenly father knoweth
[27:21] that you have need of all these things
[27:24] so when you see this it makes it easy
[27:27] for you to pray for others
[27:29] because you know your business will be
[27:31] taken care of because your father knows
[27:34] what you have need of but this is a
[27:36] Capstone verse here but seek ye first
[27:40] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[27:44] and all these things shall be added unto
[27:47] you this here answers everything you put
[27:50] God first you put the kingdom first you
[27:52] seek that first God will add to you you
[27:57] will be like Joseph God will add take
[27:59] therefore no thought for tomorrow for
[28:02] tomorrow shall take thought for the
[28:03] things of itself sufficient until the
[28:05] days the evil for
[28:09] a
[28:10] wow any Christian will think of others
[28:13] before himself there's a bomb right
[28:15] there there's a huge bomb there's a
[28:17] nuclear bomb any not church member
[28:21] church member is a different one any
[28:24] Christian will think of others before
[28:29] himself every Christian tries to put God
[28:33] first his family second and he is number
[28:37] three I have tried to make that a
[28:41] practice in my own life God first your
[28:46] family
[28:48] second and you are the third let's
[28:52] continue Moses had been a total
[28:55] failure and there may many men here this
[28:57] afternoon know maybe ministers that's
[29:00] been total failures maybe you have been
[29:02] as a housewife maybe you have been a
[29:04] student in school maybe you as a child
[29:06] to your parents whatever you have been
[29:09] let that be has been and start from
[29:12] today so B BR was trying to draw a line
[29:14] and the sign he said let been has been
[29:17] has been a failure has been has been let
[29:19] it start from today no matter what it is
[29:21] maybe you have been a failure as a
[29:22] Christian he's drilling down but maybe
[29:25] you fail to go on with God if it has
[29:29] been take note to what I'm going to say
[29:32] just in a few moments about this listen
[29:35] carefully I I was wondering to myself
[29:37] how many
[29:39] people hear the word as God you know in
[29:43] my early Christian
[29:44] experience God call me when seven years
[29:47] of of age I had many many experiences
[29:49] talking to people witnessing to people
[29:52] testifying to people and everything else
[29:54] and one of my attitudes
[29:58] that I had I can't remember how I
[30:00] developed it how I got it was God could
[30:04] use anybody to speak to
[30:06] me so I always had an extra ear for
[30:12] adventure who is speaking to me whether
[30:15] is unbelief or whatever God using them
[30:17] to get something across to me so listen
[30:20] to
[30:22] this so I'm saying that to say
[30:25] this if you are here tonight in this
[30:28] virtual prayer meeting and you're
[30:30] hearing this like a ritual oh you say
[30:33] some words or somebody say some words
[30:35] and then we go and pray and what not you
[30:37] miss the mark the word is God if you
[30:41] begin to begin to listen with an extra
[30:44] air the inner air of the heart and say
[30:47] God what are you saying to me tonight I
[30:50] just one word will make all the
[30:52] difference you see if you have a a fight
[30:55] with me you can't see God or God because
[30:59] your heart is in a condition you
[31:02] battling with the pastor you battling
[31:03] with who is speaking you battling and
[31:06] you seeing human you seeing Flesh and
[31:08] Blood you're not seeing a man that God
[31:10] can use you're not seeing God speaking
[31:13] you're not even seeing a trly word
[31:15] because that God could only speak
[31:16] through his word so listen so when
[31:18] brother Ram says take note to what I'm
[31:21] going to say just in a few minutes
[31:23] listen to
[31:24] this Woods
[31:28] Moses failed down in Egypt when he was
[31:30] born to be delivered to bring the
[31:33] children of Israel out of Egypt
[31:35] why because he did it in himself he took
[31:40] it upon himself to do it and any time
[31:42] you take things upon yourself this is me
[31:46] I could do this I could do that and
[31:47] whatnot and leave God out then you are
[31:50] going to be a fail like Moses was this
[31:53] is a guaranteed
[31:54] fail once your beef once your flesh you
[31:58] on the human level and the natural flesh
[32:01] parade in which you want to do your own
[32:03] thing
[32:04] failure he thought he could do it seeing
[32:07] an Egyptian beaten an Israelite so he
[32:09] killed him covered him up when he did he
[32:11] become a refugee in another land over in
[32:13] the land of Ethiopia and he went over
[32:15] there and married a wife listen listen
[32:18] he got a job H and
[32:19] sheep Jetro the Sheep of Midian he
[32:22] married his daughter he had two children
[32:24] born to him he got a common laborers job
[32:28] sheep hder and had been hurting sheep
[32:30] for 40 years because he failed to put
[32:35] God first so you
[32:38] see some people think they get through
[32:41] they get through with trickery they get
[32:43] through with the bad behavior they get
[32:45] through with the bullying they get
[32:47] through all through the life they get
[32:49] through and as we say if in your parents
[32:52] house you didn't get discipline life
[32:54] will deal with you life will discipline
[32:56] you and when you think you get through
[32:59] it have some pain
[33:03] coming be
[33:06] careful he had been hurting sheep for 40
[33:08] years because he failed to put God first
[33:14] I think that is what's been the matter
[33:16] with the churches brother when it gets
[33:19] to a place that we put our church first
[33:21] instead of Christ ahuh you mean people
[33:25] could put the church first yes they
[33:27] could put the church first instead of
[33:29] Christ they serving the church is
[33:31] serving the pastor is serving a man
[33:33] you're not serving the lord we are going
[33:35] to get right straight down when you put
[33:37] them as an individual here we go put
[33:40] your church first your social life
[33:44] first instead of your spiritual life you
[33:46] want a break you want a break are you
[33:49] praying to God are you putting God fots
[33:51] instead of your spiritual life first you
[33:53] are going to fail failure is guaranteed
[33:56] and I I see people
[33:58] headen for the waterfall the headen for
[34:01] CRA seeking first the kingdom of God
[34:04] have you ever witnessed that to be the
[34:06] truth put God first pay your tithes
[34:10] first pay God pray first at morning pray
[34:15] all through the day give God the first
[34:19] place in everything now remember you
[34:22] don't have to do
[34:24] nothing you could live your life and die
[34:26] a human
[34:28] but the god that give us Mercy the god
[34:32] that is rich in Mercy the god that give
[34:34] us the opportunity the god to give us
[34:36] life all these years I think he deserve
[34:39] praise and he deserves Glory that is why
[34:41] the judgments of God will be so harsh
[34:43] and fierce because he didn't stay up in
[34:45] glory and look down and say and and and
[34:47] sorry for humans and he came down
[34:49] himself became flesh and paid the price
[34:52] brother br
[34:59] he says this listen young people brother
[35:02] Brandon do you think it's wrong to do a
[35:04] certain thing
[35:06] question I said what are you questioning
[35:09] about if there's a question in your mind
[35:12] leave it alone don't do it at all just
[35:17] stay with that when you start to do
[35:19] anything and if there's a question
[35:22] whether it is right or wrong stay away
[35:26] from it don't do at all then you know
[35:29] you're right a direct this a direct word
[35:33] don't say brother so and so do it and I
[35:34] see do it and this un do it no I think I
[35:38] wrap up with this there's so much the
[35:40] time
[35:41] going seek ye first the kingdom of God
[35:44] his righteousness and all these other
[35:46] things will be added then he said
[35:48] there's amazing words I am positive sure
[35:51] this morning if men and women could only
[35:54] get to the position to where their soul
[35:58] their thinking their attitudes would be
[36:01] perfect in the sight of God that would
[36:03] be one of the most powerful churches
[36:05] that ever existed I'll close with
[36:08] this give me a
[36:11] preacher give me a
[36:13] Christian give me a housewife that's a
[36:17] Christian give me a farmer or a factory
[36:20] worker that will put God first in
[36:23] everything I will show you a man that
[36:27] will be
[36:28] successful in spite of all the devil can
[36:31] put on him he seek Gods first so if
[36:35] things are crashing around you think
[36:38] again this is a word that challenges all
[36:41] of us to put God first and we will be
[36:46] successful he didn't say Seek success he
[36:49] did not say that he said seek the
[36:52] kingdom you seek the kingdom then you
[36:56] becom a value to God the people that are
[37:00] successful is people are people who have
[37:04] become valuable and people are willing
[37:07] to pay for the value of those people
[37:11] that is why they could send for brother
[37:12] Bram all over the world that is why they
[37:15] wanted that woman said show me where
[37:17] that man walk and I'll walk and I'll be
[37:19] here because he become a man of value
[37:23] don't seek success seek the kingdom and
[37:27] success will come don't seek success
[37:30] seek the Holy Ghost blessings will come
[37:33] seek first the kingdom let's bow our
[37:34] heads heavenly father I thank you
[37:37] tonight for these words that I believe
[37:40] that was given to share with your people
[37:43] to seek first the kingdom of God as they
[37:46] get on in prayer may your presence be
[37:48] with them in a special way light them of
[37:50] fire May their faith be lit up with joy
