[1:00:38] leave here with the Holy Ghost We're
[1:00:40] Gonna Leave Here adopted We're Gonna
[1:00:42] Leave Here perfected We're Gonna Leave
[1:00:44] Here shouting and jumping and praising
[1:00:46] and worshiping and we're gonna leave
[1:00:48] with our families oh yes we're not gonna
[1:00:51] leave anybody behind
[1:00:52] Hallelujah when Pharaoh reached the
[1:00:55] point of frustration he said take your
[1:00:57] cattle take your people take your flocks
[1:00:59] take everything on gold and I believe we
[1:01:01] are coming to that season where the
[1:01:03] devil will say just go take your family
[1:01:05] go take your flocks and go take it and
[1:01:09] go because we're gonna frustrate the
[1:01:10] devil before we leave this place but the
[1:01:13] Branham taught us that you know but
[1:01:15] Abraham said a man can live in such a
[1:01:17] way with God that the devil doesn't know
[1:01:18] what to do with him that's the kind of
[1:01:20] testimony I want to have that the devil
[1:01:22] say I don't know what to do with this
[1:01:23] one I don't know what to do I tried this
[1:01:25] he still worship I tried that he's still
[1:01:28] in church I thought he was going to give
[1:01:29] up but he's still in church I turned
[1:01:31] this against him but he's still in
[1:01:32] church Hallelujah I took his job but
[1:01:35] he's still in church I cut his pay but
[1:01:38] he's still in church he's sick this
[1:01:39] morning but he's still in church he get
[1:01:42] cussed out last week what he said in
[1:01:43] church things didn't work out for him
[1:01:45] but he's still in church I don't know
[1:01:47] what to try again I don't know what to
[1:01:49] do about it but he's telling the house
[1:01:51] of God
[1:01:55] Hallelujah reaching a place where
[1:01:57] nothing could move you nothing could
[1:01:59] shake you nothing can make you backslide
[1:02:01] nothing can make you give up nothing can
[1:02:03] make you recant nothing can make you
[1:02:05] give up your testimony whether you're up
[1:02:08] whether you're done whether you're
[1:02:09] sideways whether you're in where you're
[1:02:10] out oh what can separate us from the
[1:02:13] love of God it's a reality to our souls
[1:02:16] can the Church Say Amen
[1:02:19] so for a brief time this morning in the
[1:02:22] presence of the Lord do have two
[1:02:24] portions of scripture when I read from
[1:02:25] the book of Nehemiah
[1:02:27] chapter 4 and reading Ephesians chapter
[1:02:29] 6.
[1:02:31] for a scripture reading this morning
[1:02:38] Nehemiah 4
[1:02:40] I'm reading verse 14.
[1:02:49] Nehemiah 4 and verse 14.
[1:02:53] and I looked
[1:02:54] and rose up
[1:02:56] and said unto the Nobles and to the
[1:02:58] rulers and to the rest of the people be
[1:03:01] not here free of them remember the Lord
[1:03:03] which is great and terrible
[1:03:06] and fight for your brethren
[1:03:08] your sons and your daughters your wives
[1:03:11] and your houses
[1:03:13] and reading Ephesians 6 reading verse 10
[1:03:16] a very familiar scripture
[1:03:19] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:03:22] Lord and in the power of His might
[1:03:24] put on the whole armor of God that he
[1:03:26] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[1:03:29] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:03:31] flesh and blood but against
[1:03:33] principalities against Powers against
[1:03:36] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:03:38] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:03:40] places
[1:03:41] whereforeth take unto you the whole
[1:03:43] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:03:45] withstand in the evil day and haven't
[1:03:47] done all to stand
[1:03:50] therefore having your loins good about
[1:03:52] with truth and having on the breastplate
[1:03:55] of righteousness and your feet shut with
[1:03:57] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:04:00] above all taking the shield of Faith
[1:04:02] weareth he shall be able to quench all
[1:04:05] the fiery dots of the wicked and take
[1:04:08] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:04:10] the spirit which is the word of God may
[1:04:13] the Lord had a blessing to the reading
[1:04:15] of his word you may be seated this
[1:04:17] morning
[1:04:18] in the presence of the Lord
[1:04:20] I have a title this morning taken there
[1:04:23] from the script to be read in Nehemiah
[1:04:25] 14 4 14 fight for your brethren
[1:04:30] your family
[1:04:31] and your houses
[1:04:33] fight for your brethren
[1:04:36] your family
[1:04:38] and
[1:04:40] your houses
[1:04:42] and just for some context we do have a
[1:04:45] burden today
[1:04:47] special burden for the church
[1:04:51] but in particular we have a burden for
[1:04:53] the young people and for the young
[1:04:54] children
[1:04:55] as this week
[1:04:57] some tomorrow some the day after but
[1:05:00] within the week or so everyone is back
[1:05:02] out to school
[1:05:04] and the reality is as you look at what's
[1:05:06] happening around us
[1:05:08] we would be foolish
[1:05:10] to deny the reality that schools are not
[1:05:12] where they used to be
[1:05:14] schools are no longer just about
[1:05:16] education and Mathematics and Science
[1:05:18] and sociology and social studies and
[1:05:21] these things but
[1:05:23] many of the things that our young people
[1:05:24] learn come from the school
[1:05:27] they conduct their behavior their
[1:05:29] attitude children grow up in homes and
[1:05:32] they don't know about disrespect and
[1:05:34] using certain words the way that they do
[1:05:36] in a Christian home but when they go to
[1:05:39] school they start to use different words
[1:05:42] they come home with attitudes
[1:05:44] they come home with behaviors they come
[1:05:47] home singing songs we didn't teach them
[1:05:49] they come home using words we didn't
[1:05:51] give them and that's not just school
[1:05:54] that's in the job that's in the
[1:05:55] workplace and as they progress through
[1:05:57] age it gets worse and worse until
[1:06:00] sometimes we look at them and we wonder
[1:06:02] what happened along the way and we
[1:06:04] sometimes didn't realize how as time
[1:06:07] progressed
[1:06:09] we started to lose our children
[1:06:12] as time progressed we started to lose
[1:06:16] the connection we had with them and the
[1:06:18] few hours we may spend in church on a
[1:06:20] Sunday or Wednesday or prayer meeting
[1:06:22] really cannot mathematically compare
[1:06:25] with the time they spend with their
[1:06:26] school friends
[1:06:27] and the time they're spent in the
[1:06:29] workplace
[1:06:30] the time they spend with others who are
[1:06:32] not of your
[1:06:34] conviction and persuasion and Revelation
[1:06:36] and belief
[1:06:38] and you realize that if you don't have
[1:06:40] the right conversation with your
[1:06:41] children somebody out there is having it
[1:06:44] having some kind of conversation
[1:06:47] and if you are afraid to confront the
[1:06:49] real issues of Life they will be
[1:06:51] confronted with the real issues by
[1:06:53] somebody else with another agenda
[1:06:56] and before you know it the home that you
[1:06:58] taught was protected is no longer
[1:07:00] protected
[1:07:02] the home that you thought was covered is
[1:07:04] no longer covered because Windows have
[1:07:06] been opened and doors have been opened
[1:07:09] that you thought you left shut
[1:07:13] for many of us who grew up under the
[1:07:15] feet and we had our experiences many
[1:07:18] years ago there were things that we have
[1:07:20] cut off from our appetite
[1:07:22] we have lost the appetite for certain
[1:07:24] things but unless somebody has an
[1:07:26] individual experience they have to go
[1:07:28] through the experience to lose their
[1:07:30] appetite
[1:07:32] and if they're appetite and were over
[1:07:34] preach it on Wednesday night if that
[1:07:36] nature is still a pig it doesn't matter
[1:07:38] how much you love to pick up the moment
[1:07:40] the door opens that pig will go back to
[1:07:42] the mud
[1:07:43] it's the nature of the picture desire
[1:07:45] the mud
[1:07:47] and as I'm watching and I'm looking and
[1:07:49] I'm reading and I'm watching and I'm
[1:07:50] looking and I'm reading and I'm seeing
[1:07:52] what's happening I say God what's going
[1:07:53] to happen the prophet when he was here
[1:07:55] looked around and said is this the kind
[1:07:57] of world that my children have to grow
[1:07:59] up in
[1:08:00] and that was how many decades ago what
[1:08:02] about now
[1:08:04] the stuff that we did not know at age 10
[1:08:06] children know at six
[1:08:08] at five even four the things that
[1:08:11] parents guarded your eyes and guarded
[1:08:14] your conversation until you were a
[1:08:16] teenager they know at nine or ten at 11
[1:08:18] and 12 and we'll be naive to operate as
[1:08:21] if it's business as usual when the walls
[1:08:24] have been broken down
[1:08:26] and the walls have become rubble and the
[1:08:29] reality is yes
[1:08:31] there's only so much we could do but we
[1:08:33] could only do all that we could do
[1:08:36] let me say that again we cannot be with
[1:08:38] them a parent came to me not from church
[1:08:40] a parent came to me a couple days ago
[1:08:42] with a situation with their 12 year old
[1:08:44] daughter
[1:08:45] he's in tears he's broken
[1:08:48] and I said to him you cannot be with her
[1:08:50] all the time
[1:08:53] you could only do all that you could do
[1:08:56] and the question is have you done enough
[1:09:02] how much raising of your children was
[1:09:04] left to YouTube
[1:09:06] or to movies or to games
[1:09:09] or to others who don't share your belief
[1:09:12] it is still a responsibility because we
[1:09:15] are stewards we are not owners we have a
[1:09:16] responsibility to train up a child in a
[1:09:19] way that they should go so that when
[1:09:21] they become older they will not depart
[1:09:24] but the Branham taught us that he God
[1:09:27] Don't Make halfway Christians but a
[1:09:28] Christian could be halfway
[1:09:30] he don't make halfway preacher but a
[1:09:32] preacher could be halfway
[1:09:33] parents could be halfway
[1:09:36] and children could also be halfway
[1:09:38] there comes a point where there's an
[1:09:40] acceptance of responsibility where the
[1:09:42] children could no longer say its
[1:09:44] appearance because if you have reached
[1:09:46] that age of accountability then you have
[1:09:48] to give an answer for how you speak in
[1:09:50] school and what you do in your
[1:09:52] neighborhood and what you watch on the
[1:09:54] internet and
[1:09:55] is anybody with me this morning
[1:09:58] so all of this has created a conviction
[1:10:01] in my soul to fight
[1:10:04] to fight as we have never fought before
[1:10:06] to fight differently to fight even if
[1:10:09] you have never been a fighter we are
[1:10:10] being challenged to fight
[1:10:12] [Music]
[1:10:14] and we read that scripture there in the
[1:10:15] himaya and I looked and Rose up and said
[1:10:17] unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to
[1:10:20] the rest of the people be not here
[1:10:22] afraid of them remember the Lord which
[1:10:23] is great and terrible and fight for your
[1:10:26] brethren
[1:10:27] your sons and your daughters your wives
[1:10:30] and your houses
[1:10:34] hear it
[1:10:35] can the Church Say Amen
[1:10:37] I'm building into something this
[1:10:39] scripture we read in Nehemiah 4 we would
[1:10:42] have done this in a Bible study some
[1:10:43] time ago
[1:10:46] and the background is this name I was a
[1:10:48] Jew
[1:10:50] he was a Jew in Babylon as it was
[1:10:54] in shushan the palace
[1:10:57] and he was The copier
[1:10:59] The copier is a trusted role
[1:11:02] The copier is the person who tastes the
[1:11:04] drink before the king drinks it
[1:11:06] so ensure that nothing kills the king so
[1:11:09] you're putting your life on the line
[1:11:11] but it's also a trusted role because if
[1:11:13] you you are the one that if you wanted
[1:11:14] to poison the king that's the only way
[1:11:16] the king can get poisoned so it's a
[1:11:18] position of trust it's a position of
[1:11:21] confidence and it is interesting to
[1:11:23] realize that instead of having a
[1:11:24] Babylonian that Babylonian King had a
[1:11:27] Jew in that spot
[1:11:29] it meant that you had to have such a
[1:11:31] testimony that even though he was not in
[1:11:33] his environment he still had a testimony
[1:11:37] a testimony of trust a testimony of
[1:11:40] confidence a testimony that he would
[1:11:43] have the ability to be that close to the
[1:11:45] king and they would go on and we don't
[1:11:47] have time for it this morning that the
[1:11:49] king realized that he was sad one day
[1:11:51] and he was sad because he had heard that
[1:11:53] the walls in Jerusalem had been broken
[1:11:55] down
[1:11:56] he was sad because the people of Israel
[1:11:58] had been scattered he was sad because
[1:12:00] things were not the way they were
[1:12:02] supposed to be he was sad because the
[1:12:04] walls were destroyed and the people
[1:12:06] couldn't Worship in safety and they
[1:12:08] couldn't praise God and in other words
[1:12:10] Holmes were exposed marriages were
[1:12:13] exposed houses were under attack and you
[1:12:15] have to realize that right now we are
[1:12:17] under attack
[1:12:19] and unless we choose to fight back we
[1:12:22] will remain under attack with the Enemy
[1:12:24] gaining ground
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:26] the Bible says every place you put your
[1:12:29] foot is yours so we cannot wait and say
[1:12:31] well we waited for God to fight for us
[1:12:33] we have to fight
[1:12:36] could I get a little more on the
[1:12:37] microphone please we have to fight we
[1:12:39] can wait until the enemy is inside of
[1:12:42] our gates for us to defend
[1:12:44] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:12:47] Lord so Nehemiah he caught a burden
[1:12:50] and his burden became his calling and he
[1:12:53] shared to the king that listen I need to
[1:12:55] go I can't stay here anymore the job is
[1:12:57] good
[1:12:58] the peer is fine I know you have
[1:13:00] confidence in me but my family is in
[1:13:03] trouble
[1:13:04] my brethren is in trouble my neighbors
[1:13:07] are in trouble my Kinfolk are in trouble
[1:13:09] and I'm not willing to sit here in my
[1:13:12] comfort zone like like Esther could have
[1:13:14] stayed in here and see I'm in the palace
[1:13:16] I'm fine and Mordecai said to her how do
[1:13:18] you not know that for such a time as
[1:13:20] this you are in the place that you're in
[1:13:22] and the question that was asked Esther
[1:13:25] is for such a time as this
[1:13:27] and if you don't get involved then God
[1:13:30] will bring deliverance from somewhere
[1:13:31] else but something has got to be done
[1:13:34] and I want to call out to the parents

[1:15:55] trying to build something
[1:15:56] and just declaring this this morning
[1:15:59] means the enemy will be mad
[1:16:01] because he wants us to operate in a way
[1:16:03] that allows him to walk over us I want
[1:16:06] you to understand that this gospel is
[1:16:08] dripping with blood
[1:16:09] Moses had to fight Joshua had to fight
[1:16:12] brother Branham had to fight Elijah had
[1:16:16] to fight Joshua had to fight David had
[1:16:19] to fight Noah had to fight
[1:16:21] [Applause]
[1:16:24] it's a fight in your school to walk away
[1:16:28] from the music it's a fight on your job
[1:16:30] to walk away from the lunchroom
[1:16:32] Hallelujah fighting is not just physical
[1:16:34] fighting is not just having
[1:16:36] confrontation sometimes it's a fight to
[1:16:39] leave the room and walk away because you
[1:16:41] want to stay there but because you're a
[1:16:43] fighter you choose the battle to walk
[1:16:45] away when Joseph was in Egypt he didn't
[1:16:47] see his son's tale and see the Salvation
[1:16:49] no he fought and his fighting had him
[1:16:52] run away from Potiphar's wife
[1:16:57] it's a fight
[1:16:58] do you know the Bible says that when lot
[1:17:00] was in Sodom and it was time to leave
[1:17:02] the angel was pleading with them let's
[1:17:05] go let's go let's go the Bible said to
[1:17:07] the angel grab lot and pull them out
[1:17:10] it's a fight the Angels was fighting for
[1:17:13] lot the angel was fighting for the
[1:17:15] family are you ready to fight for your
[1:17:18] brethren your password and brother you
[1:17:21] know they're in trouble say come on you
[1:17:23] can make it come on you could be healed
[1:17:26] come on you could stand you could stand
[1:17:29] in your school you could stand on your
[1:17:31] job
[1:17:44] never has there been a day like this day
[1:17:52] and the attack is not just one attack
[1:17:55] when you listen to the way the prophet
[1:17:56] would speak he would talk about staying
[1:17:59] home to watch TV and he talked about
[1:18:01] going out and drinking all the rickies
[1:18:03] and the rakatas he will talk about all
[1:18:06] these things you're doing and when you
[1:18:08] look at what you have to deal with then
[1:18:10] and now it's so different
[1:18:13] it's the same spirits but more forms of
[1:18:15] expression
[1:18:20] [Applause]
[1:18:24] the world America was built in a
[1:18:27] foundation of In God We Trust
[1:18:29] there is a time where people challenge
[1:18:31] that's different and say we can't say
[1:18:32] that no more
[1:18:35] they are no more atheists than ever
[1:18:38] people who don't believe there is a God
[1:18:40] or any kind of God
[1:18:44] the psalmist David says in Psalm 1 when
[1:18:47] 14 1 the fool said in his heart there is
[1:18:50] no God
[1:18:55] I've seen many young people grow up in
[1:18:57] the message went to University and left
[1:18:59] saying I don't believe in God
[1:19:02] so with all of the education they are
[1:19:04] fools
[1:19:07] because it's the fool who said it is no
[1:19:10] God
[1:19:11] when we should teach our young people at
[1:19:13] the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:19:15] wisdom
[1:19:17] not your old levels not your A Levels
[1:19:19] your C second SCA your degree the fear
[1:19:22] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:27] and wisdom surpasses knowledge at any
[1:19:30] time
[1:19:32] and in all that getting get
[1:19:33] understanding
[1:19:39] we have to reject what the world wants
[1:19:42] to normalize
[1:19:43] that's a statement they make though
[1:19:45] let's normalize this and let's normalize
[1:19:47] that the fact that things are being
[1:19:49] normalized meant it was not so from the
[1:19:51] beginning
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:59] and we want to know why our homes are
[1:20:01] broken and why things because we have
[1:20:03] left the enemy to creep in because our
[1:20:05] walls have been broken down
[1:20:10] and if the walls around your home your
[1:20:12] family your life is broken down we need
[1:20:15] to rebuild the walls
[1:20:17] we need to close the breach
[1:20:20] the only way the enemy can get to you is
[1:20:23] because it's an opening but if we close
[1:20:25] the gaps this morning if we close the
[1:20:28] preachers this morning then there's no
[1:20:30] room for the devil he can come into your
[1:20:33] home he can come into your marriage if
[1:20:35] there's a gap in your life Hallelujah
[1:20:38] bring back the family prayer let's close
[1:20:41] that breach Hallelujah through the
[1:20:43] worldly clothes out of your house let's
[1:20:46] close the breach or you don't hear me
[1:20:48] this morning when they went in the
[1:20:50] Cherry cold Jericho Joshua told them
[1:20:52] whatever you do don't touch your cursing
[1:20:55] don't take anything from Jericho don't
[1:20:58] take the clothes don't take the money
[1:21:00] don't take the wealth don't take the
[1:21:03] books don't take the DVDs don't take the
[1:21:05] movies leave everything in Jericho
[1:21:11] because everything in Jericho is a curse
[1:21:15] you know it and they went to war they
[1:21:17] went to the battle
[1:21:22] it was AI dentist artificial
[1:21:24] intelligence now
[1:21:25] [Applause]
[1:21:28] I'm not playing games
[1:21:31] technology will be the undoing of this
[1:21:33] generation
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:39] until man thinks they don't need God and
[1:21:42] they can figure it out and the computers
[1:21:43] could solve the problems and then every
[1:21:45] day you get further away from God and
[1:21:47] you opening doors into your house
[1:21:50] you close your door at night but your
[1:21:52] windows are open your roof is open and
[1:21:55] the enemy is coming in
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:00] coming into your mind coming into your
[1:22:02] subconscious
[1:22:03] based on the things you watch the things
[1:22:05] you encounter and you want to know why
[1:22:06] my prayers can get to God because in the
[1:22:09] subconscious level when you asleep at
[1:22:11] night all the stuff you watch is at war
[1:22:13] with who you are
[1:22:15] [Applause]
[1:22:21] you willing to fight for your brethren
[1:22:24] are you willing to fight for your family
[1:22:25] I want to fight for your house Joshua
[1:22:29] say after me and my house we will serve
[1:22:31] the Lord
[1:22:32] is that your declaration
[1:22:36] listen to fight translate into how you
[1:22:38] dress the fight translates into where
[1:22:41] you go the fight translates into what
[1:22:44] you read the fight translates into if
[1:22:46] you have a prayer life the fight
[1:22:48] translate into your worship the fight
[1:22:50] translate into your fasting the fight
[1:22:53] translates into being in the house of
[1:22:55] God the other places you could have been
[1:22:57] this morning but you fought your way to
[1:22:59] get here hallelujah blessed be the name
[1:23:02] of the Lord
[1:23:09] thank you
[1:23:17] all right
[1:23:18] we live in our other way
[1:23:21] it's a fight against the over
[1:23:23] sexualization of our young people
[1:23:30] we're in the schools they teach you
[1:23:31] different family types now
[1:23:35] coming soon to a theater near you if
[1:23:37] your school won't have it yet it's
[1:23:38] coming
[1:23:40] foreign
[1:23:44] agendas different things to normalize
[1:23:48] Solomon gaborah
[1:23:50] normalize drug use
[1:23:53] normalize alcohol use normalize violence
[1:23:57] normalize dishonesty normalize pressure
[1:24:02] peer pressure normalized I was trying to
[1:24:05] protect my mental health so I don't want
[1:24:06] to think stress them out
[1:24:11] excuses upon excuse normalizing well
[1:24:13] because I have to study so much is why I
[1:24:15] can't make it to church
[1:24:18] when the Bible said what is it Prophet
[1:24:20] the man to gain the whole world and to
[1:24:22] lose his soul
[1:24:25] I will never see a school isn't
[1:24:26] important but you have to make sure you
[1:24:28] have your priorities right
[1:24:31] and it starts from the top it starts
[1:24:33] from the appearance set in the
[1:24:35] environment in the home
[1:24:36] [Applause]
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:43] one of the biggest challenges is our
[1:24:44] parents not doing what they're supposed
[1:24:46] to do
[1:24:49] and the parents want to leave it on the
[1:24:51] school teachers when it's in school
[1:24:52] supposed to do it on is Sunday school
[1:24:54] supposed to do it or the church supposed
[1:24:56] to do it
[1:24:57] that's why there's a big difference
[1:24:58] between being a man or being male or
[1:25:00] being a father and being a a dad or just
[1:25:03] having a child it's a it's a
[1:25:04] responsibility
[1:25:05] [Applause]
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:11] social media or the pressure the Styles
[1:25:14] and the fashions
[1:25:15] parents how we can expect our children
[1:25:17] to do better if we are struggling too
[1:25:19] much
[1:25:23] we have too much compromises
[1:25:32] I'm sorry this is not the kind of jump
[1:25:33] for joy service
[1:25:36] too much compromises
[1:25:39] the Bible say right in your heart or
[1:25:40] your cold
[1:25:46] let you know be you know
[1:25:48] if this is the if this is a Christian
[1:25:50] home then we live by Christian
[1:25:51] principles
[1:25:55] either we are Christian or we're not a
[1:25:57] Christian woman
[1:25:58] and if it's a Christian home and certain
[1:26:00] things could happen and certain things
[1:26:01] cannot happen
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:11] I'm sorry
[1:26:13] foreign
[1:26:24] you speak to anybody who has been true
[1:26:26] or they will tell you if I could have
[1:26:27] done things differently I would
[1:26:34] and for those who are walking down the
[1:26:36] 30 parts of this journey you have an
[1:26:38] opportunity to do different
[1:26:40] to do better
[1:26:41] to ask the questions but even still for
[1:26:44] those who have walked out there's still
[1:26:46] a promise of restoration and there's a
[1:26:48] promise of Deliverance and is a promise
[1:26:50] of real being rebuilt can the church say
[1:26:52] amen I don't believe believing him with
[1:26:55] one person behind who is supposed to be
[1:26:57] in a Rapture it's my promises unto you
[1:26:59] and to your children even to them that
[1:27:01] are far off so it's not a time to be
[1:27:03] discouraged it's a time to realize that
[1:27:05] we need to fight we want to fight for
[1:27:07] those who are here and then fight those
[1:27:09] who are not here knowing that we're
[1:27:11] going to speak a word for every
[1:27:12] backslider that not many days hence
[1:27:16] we're gonna see them in the house of God
[1:27:18] not many days and when is God do it you
[1:27:20] will know it's God hallelujah sister
[1:27:23] Rana sits he has a testimony

[1:27:28] something gripped her heart and since
[1:27:31] then your car final outside of the
[1:27:33] presence of God
[1:27:35] she'll have her up and down but that's
[1:27:37] good that's that man nobody forced her
[1:27:39] not to be here she has a desire to be
[1:27:41] here and whether you I'm prophesying
[1:27:43] over your entire house
[1:27:46] they're all coming back we have to speak
[1:27:49] it we have to declare it oh Hallelujah
[1:27:52] but I asked me I prophesy over your
[1:27:55] house

[1:28:01] Hallelujah but a black one I prophesy
[1:28:03] over your house your children will be
[1:28:06] delivered

[1:28:19] discouraged prepare for war we want to
[1:28:22] be ready

[1:30:15] in his city of Jerusalem
[1:30:18] it affected him so much it changed his
[1:30:20] countenance he was going to work every
[1:30:23] day but he wasn't himself no more it was
[1:30:26] not a sadness that came from the
[1:30:28] depression of the world it was a
[1:30:30] forlorn-ness that came from having a
[1:30:32] burden
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:36] a burden for God's people a burden for
[1:30:39] broken homes
[1:30:42] Joy a burden for those who struggled to
[1:30:45] dress like a Christian a burden for
[1:30:47] those who struggle to sigh and cry for
[1:30:49] the Abomination a burden for those whose
[1:30:52] walls
[1:30:54] been broken
[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:31:01] the story of Nehemiah is a story of
[1:31:04] rebuilding defenses
[1:31:06] and we read in Ephesians to put on the
[1:31:08] whole armor of God friends without your
[1:31:10] defense you will be killed
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:30] put on the whole armor
[1:31:34] the whole armor
[1:31:36] but Abraham told us this is the Holy
[1:31:38] Ghost you know
[1:31:43] the entire Armor of God can be described
[1:31:46] as the Holy Ghost
[1:31:46] [Applause]
[1:31:48] expression of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:51] one Holy Ghost
[1:31:53] taking his position to be your defense
[1:31:56] the Holy Ghost is your guide the Holy
[1:31:58] Ghost is your protection the Holy Ghost
[1:32:00] is your comfort the Holy Ghost is the
[1:32:02] truth even the spirit of Truth the Holy
[1:32:05] Ghost is the anchor for your soul the
[1:32:08] Holy Ghost is the control tower of your
[1:32:10] heart
[1:32:11] Hallelujah
[1:32:20] and where have you ever got an
[1:32:22] experience with the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:32:24] give you a burden
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:32:28] because it's one body you know you're
[1:32:30] baptized into one body and if you're
[1:32:32] part of this body if the toe is hurting
[1:32:34] you feel the pain
[1:32:36] if the finger is hurting you feel the
[1:32:38] pain
[1:32:39] so you can't sit there say well I'm all
[1:32:41] right no if you're part of this body
[1:32:42] when one brother in trouble
[1:32:46] something awakens in you to fight for
[1:32:50] your brethren
[1:32:51] fight for your family fight for your
[1:32:54] house
[1:32:55] it's not more than one body it's one
[1:32:57] mystical body
[1:33:09] could you take some more
[1:33:11] [Applause]
[1:33:15] forgive me how much all over the place
[1:33:18] this morning but
[1:33:22] I want to just look back again into this
[1:33:24] scripture in Nehemiah 4.
[1:33:29] we read verse 14 but verse 14 was a
[1:33:31] responsive situation
[1:33:38] and whenever you decide to do something
[1:33:40] for God
[1:33:42] like I pray today you make a decision
[1:33:45] to do something for God
[1:33:46] not just something but a fight
[1:33:53] the enemy is going to respond
[1:33:56] so if you have your Bibles and you can
[1:33:57] wanna ride with me in Nehemiah 4. verse
[1:34:00] 1.
[1:34:03] good to see you brother Isaiah
[1:34:06] God bless you
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:12] but when Sam Ballard heard that we were
[1:34:15] rebuilding the wall
[1:34:20] but it came to pass that when someone
[1:34:22] heard are we building the wall he was
[1:34:24] wrought
[1:34:25] and took great indignation and mocked
[1:34:27] Jews in other words
[1:34:29] under nehemiah's pleading
[1:34:33] on the nehemiah's cry the people
[1:34:35] realized that they were defenseless
[1:34:38] and the first way to make progress is to
[1:34:41] build back the wall
[1:34:44] friends you need to have a wall in your
[1:34:46] home
[1:34:47] a wall on your job a wall in your school
[1:34:52] without the wall the devil have free
[1:34:54] clearance or walk in and do what you
[1:34:55] want to do
[1:35:01] so sambala tell her they were rebuilding
[1:35:04] the wall he became Furious
[1:35:06] completely enraged
[1:35:10] what do these people choose
[1:35:15] will they fortify themselves
[1:35:19] will they sacrifice
[1:35:22] so you see the question they will ask it
[1:35:26] in other words he said you you think
[1:35:29] they really will sacrifice so get his
[1:35:30] wall back up
[1:35:36] because in fact they're rich in that
[1:35:37] condition meant things went wrong and so
[1:35:39] he was like I don't think they have it
[1:35:41] in them the sacrifice you know
[1:35:47] well they revive
[1:35:49] well uh will they sacrifice will they
[1:35:53] make an end in a day in other words you
[1:35:55] think they could fix it in one day
[1:36:02] will they revive the stones out of the
[1:36:04] hips of the rubbish which are burned in
[1:36:06] other words what are they trying to do
[1:36:10] you see how the enemy looking at you
[1:36:12] trying to get your house back in order
[1:36:16] now to buy it ammonite was by them and
[1:36:18] said even that which they build
[1:36:21] if a fox go up he shall even break down
[1:36:24] the Stonewall
[1:36:26] in other words he's saying listen
[1:36:28] whatever they do when they're so weak
[1:36:32] they wasting time you know in other
[1:36:34] words I will still get them
[1:36:40] so this is bear in mind now this is what
[1:36:42] this is the word that's coming to the
[1:36:43] children of Israel
[1:36:44] they hearing what the enemy thinking
[1:36:46] about them and this is the war that even
[1:36:48] happened in your mind with where he
[1:36:50] never said what are you thinking you
[1:36:51] ready to take your break to your rating
[1:36:52] your son gonna be delivered
[1:36:56] you really think God will work for you
[1:37:00] and Nehemiah prayed this is verse 4 hear
[1:37:03] o Our God for we are despised
[1:37:06] and turn their reproach upon their own
[1:37:09] head
[1:37:09] and give them for a prey in the land of
[1:37:12] captivity
[1:37:13] uncover not their iniquity and let not
[1:37:17] their sin be blotted out from before
[1:37:19] thee for they have provoked Vita anger
[1:37:22] before the builders
[1:37:24] verse six
[1:37:26] saw built we the wall in other words
[1:37:29] Against All Odds against what the enemy
[1:37:32] is saying against the discouraging
[1:37:35] statements against people saying you're
[1:37:37] wasting time going to church
[1:37:39] against the enemy saying but other
[1:37:41] people walk away while you're still
[1:37:43] standing against all their voices about
[1:37:45] giving up and while what's the use of
[1:37:47] going to church and what's the use when
[1:37:50] things are working out for you
[1:37:51] so built with a wall in other words
[1:37:55] we're not stopping
[1:37:56] in other words we're not stopping
[1:37:58] we might look weak but we're not stop
[1:38:00] him we might look tired but we're not
[1:38:03] stop him so build we the wall every time
[1:38:06] we come to church
[1:38:08] so built we the wall every time we have
[1:38:11] a call proper a meeting so built we the
[1:38:14] wall you drag yourself to church but you
[1:38:17] put another brick and you put another
[1:38:19] brick and you put it under a brick and
[1:38:22] the enemy watching and he laughing but
[1:38:24] it was another brick every time you left
[1:38:26] your hand in worship you put another
[1:38:28] brick so built we the wall your daughter
[1:38:32] gave trouble but you put another brick
[1:38:34] your husband act up this morning but you
[1:38:37] put another brick your wife didn't do
[1:38:39] what you asked her to do but you put
[1:38:41] another brick saw built with all
[1:38:44] whatever happens I'm not stopping I've
[1:38:47] got to be defended I need the whole
[1:38:50] armor I'm tired of the enemy coming into
[1:38:53] my house
[1:38:54] foreign
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:16] so this is the lesson right here in the
[1:39:19] face of criticism in the face of
[1:39:21] negativity in the face of people saying
[1:39:24] it's not possible to have a Revival in
[1:39:26] the face of people saying are you not
[1:39:27] gonna make it in a face of the devil
[1:39:29] saying what you did last week what did
[1:39:31] it last year was it in the face of all
[1:39:33] of that so built be the wall and all the
[1:39:36] wall was joined together
[1:39:38] until the half thereof in other words
[1:39:40] for half the height for the people had a
[1:39:42] mind to work
[1:39:44] Hallelujah in the amplifies
[1:39:47] oh God give us a heart to work give us a
[1:39:51] heart to defend our house give us a
[1:39:53] heart to defend our families give us a
[1:39:56] heart to cry for Revival give us a heart
[1:39:58] a heart a heart for the work friends
[1:40:01] it's working on it's not just sit down
[1:40:03] and take any Services work it's work by
[1:40:05] prayer it's work by worship it's work by
[1:40:08] reading it's work by science it's work
[1:40:11] by shouting it's work it's work it's
[1:40:13] work
[1:40:21] parents it's a work
[1:40:24] parent in his work being a good student
[1:40:26] is work
[1:40:30] and he can have
[1:40:32] a work another hard for the worker
[1:40:40] for the people who had a mind to work
[1:40:43] only everybody you know when somebody
[1:40:45] just do something
[1:40:47] versus whenever hard to do it
[1:40:50] there's a difference between doing it
[1:40:51] and having a heart to do it
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:56] have a conversation with your daughter
[1:40:58] your son I talk to them you know you do
[1:41:00] it because you do it but was your heart
[1:41:03] in it
[1:41:05] make things right with your wife make
[1:41:07] things right to your husband well I tell
[1:41:08] them sorry you do it what's that it was
[1:41:10] a heart in it
[1:41:13] people know it's hearted it
[1:41:17] you're doing your job and you're just
[1:41:19] doing your job is it hot in it you know
[1:41:22] the Bible say whatever job you have do
[1:41:24] it unto the Lord
[1:41:27] your heart's supposed to be in it under
[1:41:30] no circumstances in a Christian still
[1:41:31] like this working pretty man you know
[1:41:35] that is not scriptural
[1:41:36] [Applause]
[1:41:43] you can't just go to school where I do
[1:41:45] this school work your heart wasn't it
[1:41:52] I come to church you're hurting it
[1:41:57] [Music]
[1:41:59] there's a different many song leader
[1:42:00] sings and his heart is in the singing
[1:42:03] there's a difference between the
[1:42:04] musician playing and the artist in the
[1:42:06] plane
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:08] [Applause]
[1:42:09] there's a difference between preaching
[1:42:10] and your heart and the preaching
[1:42:13] there's a difference between being a
[1:42:14] worshiper and your heart
[1:42:16] [Applause]
[1:42:19] I'm coming back with a Heart of Worship
[1:42:24] there's worship and it's the art of
[1:42:26] worship
[1:42:28] that's why the psalmist never say
[1:42:30] creating me a clean heart oh God and we
[1:42:33] know our right Spirit Within Me
[1:42:36] I want to have a heart
[1:42:39] because sometimes we lose the burden for
[1:42:41] a family you know
[1:42:43] sometimes parents with your point is at
[1:42:46] this point whatever happened happiness
[1:42:51] universe
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:54] at this point wherever whoever it is
[1:42:57] lady better go lie down there yes
[1:43:04] hot
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:10] in fact I get so bad the things we say
[1:43:12] to our children we speak curses upon
[1:43:14] them
[1:43:16] you're going up to nothing
[1:43:19] you end up with nothing
[1:43:30] hot
[1:43:34] in the not any message I heard a
[1:43:37] preacher I say God help us
[1:43:40] some people left the church
[1:43:42] and he prayed in the church he said Lord
[1:43:44] let those who lead the church let them
[1:43:46] have no money no health
[1:43:49] me you sending them into sickness I was
[1:43:51] like what
[1:43:53] what he was so upset
[1:43:57] that he's had to pray said Lord may you
[1:43:59] bind up their bank account
[1:44:01] a little basically the car shut down
[1:44:06] but you know what that is it's a lack of
[1:44:08] understanding that it's God's people and
[1:44:11] not his people
[1:44:15] because he is the shepherd oh you don't
[1:44:17] hear me this morning
[1:44:21] on this Earthly represent the shepherd
[1:44:27] we are all sheep under the great
[1:44:28] Shepherd
[1:44:37] but a real Christian you could never
[1:44:39] wish bad to somebody where they do to do
[1:44:41] it they do you good to do you evil
[1:44:44] because somebody had your Vex you pray a
[1:44:46] lot didn't you trip them up when you tie
[1:44:48] them up for you
[1:44:50] and God's saying when you repent come
[1:44:53] back to me
[1:44:56] [Applause]
[1:44:57] he said that's why this
[1:45:01] Beyonce and drop the order because
[1:45:03] someone else say you dropped me all but
[1:45:04] you're wishing parting on people
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:09] anybody in your house
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:12] but drop it that drop it and every time
[1:45:14] you think about that boy just hope that
[1:45:16] man I get our promotional
[1:45:20] but nobody can say no I forgive them I
[1:45:23] forgive them I just don't want no
[1:45:25] promotion for them
[1:45:27] I forgive them I just don't want to see
[1:45:29] them happy what it took me through like
[1:45:31] Lord I forgive them but don't make them
[1:45:34] smile
[1:45:41] y heart you know
[1:45:45] because God read in your heart not your
[1:45:47] lips
[1:45:49] he said in vain they worship me
[1:45:53] hot
[1:45:57] do you have a heart for the young people
[1:46:01] I'm coming I'm coming to your house you
[1:46:03] know
[1:46:03] will my children not in church so I
[1:46:05] really don't care about your service
[1:46:14] so because your house in trouble you
[1:46:16] okay but anybody else house
[1:46:23] but if you have a burden
[1:46:25] that's why I said fight
[1:46:28] for your brethren

[1:46:33] houses that you script to be read

[1:46:40] when you catch a burden for the body
[1:46:43] the body begins to work for the body
[1:46:48] and you extending Grace to somebody else
[1:46:51] God put a burden on somebody else for
[1:46:53] your house and you can't even explain
[1:46:56] what happened to your son to your
[1:46:58] daughter you can't even put it into
[1:47:00] words because God knows you try
[1:47:02] everything you could but God's saying is
[1:47:04] not you to do it it's me to do it
[1:47:08] anybody in the house this morning

[1:48:25] the house of God but is your heart in it
[1:48:34] everything we do it's reflective of
[1:48:36] what's in our heart
[1:48:43] God is so interested in that heart he
[1:48:45] said that's why when you break the ties
[1:48:47] and your finger brings saying from your
[1:48:49] heart
[1:48:49] not unwillingly
[1:48:51] [Music]

[1:52:17] going against the current to them
[1:52:21] Hallelujah
[1:52:24] but when it came to Pastor when San
[1:52:26] Valentine to Bayern the Arabians and the
[1:52:28] ammonites and the asterisk Hood now the
[1:52:30] walls of Jerusalem were being made up
[1:52:32] and that the breaches began to be
[1:52:34] stopped then they were very rough
[1:52:37] and they conspired all of them together
[1:52:40] to come and fight against Jerusalem and
[1:52:44] to hinder it
[1:52:46] so what do you think
[1:52:48] you will come to church and shout and
[1:52:49] jump and feel good on the enemy not
[1:52:51] works
[1:52:54] brother Micah you don't think that after
[1:52:56] God took you through and preserved you
[1:52:57] are the enemy not mad
[1:53:06] nevertheless
[1:53:10] we made our prayer unto our God
[1:53:14] and set a watch against them day and
[1:53:16] night
[1:53:17] because of them
[1:53:25] and Judah said the strength
[1:53:28] of the bearers of burdens is the key
[1:53:36] in the Amplified it says the strength of
[1:53:38] the burden bearers is feeling
[1:53:42] and there's so much rubbish so that we
[1:53:45] are not able to build a wall
[1:53:47] in other words they're making progress
[1:53:51] but the burden bearers
[1:53:55] I want us to go through this a little
[1:53:57] slowly
[1:53:58] burden bears
[1:54:00] strength is the kid
[1:54:05] this is where I want to get to the
[1:54:07] younger people in church
[1:54:12] in every company
[1:54:13] in every family in every Church
[1:54:17] they are burden-bearers
[1:54:22] people who do the work
[1:54:25] people who show up
[1:54:27] people for whom has more action than
[1:54:29] talk
[1:54:30] if you ask for help they're ready to say
[1:54:32] I will help
[1:54:34] daddy put mirrors
[1:54:37] and the Bible said that he wouldn't bear
[1:54:39] us
[1:54:40] their strength
[1:54:42] start to decay
[1:54:49] who will pick up this Slack
[1:54:54] who will catch the burden
[1:54:57] Francis wanting to be the message
[1:55:01] for this gospel to move on
[1:55:07] I watch somebody else in the church
[1:55:11] those have been fighting a long time
[1:55:13] and sometimes wonder how some of them do
[1:55:15] it
[1:55:16] I don't want to give in trouble calling
[1:55:17] plenty names but I look at better than
[1:55:19] Hugh Williams
[1:55:21] if anybody has a burden
[1:55:31] and whether you they're responding so
[1:55:32] because I don't even need to finish his
[1:55:34] statement
[1:55:35] because your work speak for itself
[1:55:41] it's not a talk burden
[1:55:48] there's certain people you see I don't
[1:55:49] want to get in trouble like holy names
[1:55:50] and if I call I will reverse on that
[1:55:53] road
[1:55:54] foreign
[1:56:01] but you know who are the birth and it's
[1:56:03] in homes too you know
[1:56:07] who will share the burden
[1:56:16] can I go to the house
[1:56:20] I see my wife went downstairs
[1:56:28] maybe it will help somebody
[1:56:31] but punch
[1:56:38] sharing the burden
[1:56:43] if I ask the sisters in the church
[1:56:47] how much are the house burden
[1:56:50] the husband's share
[1:56:53] the Pastor said oh Lord father
[1:56:59] keep driving around or I should reverse
[1:57:01] this this one too
[1:57:08] [Applause]
[1:57:12] I think nine out of ten wives
[1:57:17] would say they wish their husband cheer
[1:57:19] more
[1:57:21] of the building
[1:57:26] and if I could identify one of the
[1:57:28] number one complaints of the wives in
[1:57:31] the house
[1:57:32] is that tired
[1:57:35] because burden bearers get
[1:57:47] I saw a meme recently
[1:57:49] when the husband gets sick
[1:57:51] versus when your wife gets sick
[1:57:54] when your husband gets sick he curl up
[1:57:56] in the bed he's sick
[1:57:58] when your wife gets sick she has a tea
[1:57:59] really cheer and thing with his thing do
[1:58:01] this do this cook for the husband cook
[1:58:03] for yourself and I'm not saying
[1:58:05] nothing's happening in the church
[1:58:12] but I'm challenging us to step up and to
[1:58:15] understand burden
[1:58:20] because it takes a burden to open the
[1:58:22] church early
[1:58:24] it takes a burden to be part of a team
[1:58:27] to help clean up after the service
[1:58:30] it's not as any people who are doing
[1:58:32] that
[1:58:33] drink five lucozade and a Red Bull
[1:58:35] before they do that
[1:58:38] they're tired too
[1:58:42] but the burden outweighs
[1:58:45] the tiredness
[1:58:50] but the Bible says that as they were
[1:58:52] building the wall and there were certain
[1:58:53] pointy and let's say listen
[1:58:55] we tired
[1:58:59] we've been working in the 70s in the 80s
[1:59:02] in the 90s in the 2000s we've been doing
[1:59:04] this a long time
[1:59:08] anybody with me
[1:59:11] so it's a salute to the burden bearers
[1:59:13] but it's a call for who will carry
[1:59:18] who was shady burden
[1:59:23] years ago I knew prayer warriors
[1:59:26] God bless her heart
[1:59:29] sister Joe for those of you remember
[1:59:31] this is a joke
[1:59:32] real prayer Warrior
[1:59:36] and the testimony said the prayers from
[1:59:39] those who walked before
[1:59:41] it's harder to find them now you know
[1:59:46] the real praying mothers and he will
[1:59:49] pray in grandmothers
[1:59:53] who carry the burden
[1:59:56] because all that is possibly fighting
[2:00:01] you on your knees will do so much for
[2:00:04] your children as they go to school going
[2:00:06] to University
[2:00:10] let's continue I don't need this helping
[2:00:11] anybody
[2:00:12] [Applause]
[2:00:16] and Judah said the leaders of Judah
[2:00:19] the strength of the bearers of burden is
[2:00:22] decayed and there is so much rubbish so
[2:00:23] that we are not able to build a war
[2:00:27] so they feel the tiredness
[2:00:29] and our adversaries said they shall not
[2:00:31] no need or see till we are come in the
[2:00:33] midst among them and slay them and cause
[2:00:35] the work to cease in other words
[2:00:38] the enemy saying we will infiltrate them
[2:00:41] they wouldn't even know when we entered
[2:00:42] do we know how to identify us they will
[2:00:45] not know we are there and they will not
[2:00:47] know we are the enemy until we kill them
[2:00:48] and stop the work
[2:00:51] that's what that's saying there right
[2:00:54] and it came to pass that when the Jews
[2:00:55] which dwell by them came they sent unto
[2:00:57] us ten times from all the places when
[2:00:59] you shall return unto us they will be
[2:01:01] upon you from so from every direction
[2:01:03] they're being told the attack is coming
[2:01:06] the attack is coming the attack is
[2:01:07] coming
[2:01:11] verse 13 therefore said I in the lower
[2:01:14] places behind the wall and on the higher
[2:01:18] places I even said the people after
[2:01:20] their families with their swords their
[2:01:23] Spears and their bows
[2:01:25] and I looked and Rose up and this is
[2:01:27] script we read and said unto the Nobles
[2:01:30] unto the rulers and to the rest of the
[2:01:32] people be not here afraid of them
[2:01:35] remember the Lord which is great and
[2:01:38] terrible and fight for your brethren
[2:01:41] your sons and your daughters your wives
[2:01:44] and your houses in other words I know
[2:01:47] you're tired I know you're weary but
[2:01:49] let's band together let's come together
[2:01:51] let's get the burden shared let's get
[2:01:54] the people together let's defend the
[2:01:56] walls because we can't stop now we can't
[2:01:58] give up now what we are doing as a
[2:02:01] greater purpose so let us fight let us
[2:02:04] fight for our Brethren let's fight for
[2:02:06] our families let's fight for our houses
[2:02:09] [Applause]
[2:02:18] and verse 15 and it came to pass
[2:02:21] that when our enemy is heard it was
[2:02:24] known
[2:02:25] unto us
[2:02:26] in other words when the enemy recognizes
[2:02:28] that Witness
[2:02:30] like the taken battle formation
[2:02:32] like they're getting ready for some kind
[2:02:34] of War like they know we're coming
[2:02:37] and God had brought their counsel to
[2:02:39] note that we returned all of us to the
[2:02:42] wall everyone unto his work and it came
[2:02:44] to pass from that time Fort that the
[2:02:47] half of my servants wrought in the work
[2:02:49] and the other half of them held both
[2:02:51] despairs and the Shields and the Bulls
[2:02:54] and the herbertions and the rulers were
[2:02:56] behind all the house of Judah in other
[2:02:58] words we are building and fighting we
[2:03:00] are building and defending we are
[2:03:02] building and we are alert we have to
[2:03:04] send our children to school but we're
[2:03:06] not sending them undefended we will pray
[2:03:08] for them before they go to school or you
[2:03:11] don't hear me this morning we will pray
[2:03:13] with them we will pray for them
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:17] [Music]
[2:03:22] verse 17.
[2:03:23] the a was building on the wall and they
[2:03:26] that bear burdens with those that leaded
[2:03:28] everyone with one of his hands brought
[2:03:31] in the work and with the other hand held
[2:03:33] a weapon
[2:03:35] everybody
[2:03:37] so we're working but uh Thompson will be
[2:03:39] ready to fight for the builders everyone
[2:03:41] had his sword
[2:03:43] girded by his side and so build it so
[2:03:47] we're not building in ignorance we're
[2:03:49] not building blindly we're building with
[2:03:51] our Swords by our side and he that
[2:03:54] sounded a trumpet was by me so Nehemiah
[2:03:57] had the trumpet saunda right next to him
[2:03:59] in other words if you need a Sony alarm
[2:04:01] I don't want the man who wear the man
[2:04:03] with the alarm no he I want him right
[2:04:04] next to me at all times because we
[2:04:06] unfollow alert
[2:04:09] we are the highest alert level
[2:04:12] church we are the highest alert level
[2:04:15] [Applause]
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:18] and I said unto the Nobles and to the
[2:04:21] rulers and to the rest of the people the
[2:04:23] work is great and large and we are
[2:04:25] separated upon the wall one far from
[2:04:28] another in what place therefore ye hear
[2:04:31] the sound of the trumpet resorting
[2:04:33] theater unto us our God shall fight for
[2:04:35] us in other words when you're in other
[2:04:37] words the trumpet is the thing you're
[2:04:39] listening for when you hear the trumpet
[2:04:41] just come together
[2:04:44] the work don't stop but if you do hear
[2:04:46] you trumpet that's the only time you'll
[2:04:48] stop working because it means we're
[2:04:49] going into fighting mode but in the
[2:04:51] meantime build keep your sword next to
[2:04:53] you work go to work with your sword
[2:04:56] go to school with your sword go to your
[2:04:59] family with your sword go to the grocery
[2:05:01] with your sword go into the taxi with
[2:05:03] your sword drive any traffic with your
[2:05:06] soul
[2:05:07] anybody with me
[2:05:08] [Applause]
[2:05:12] in other words don't let down your God
[2:05:20] verse 21 so we labor in the work
[2:05:24] and half of them held his Spears from
[2:05:26] the rising of the morning till the Stars
[2:05:28] appeared
[2:05:30] likewise at the same time said I answer
[2:05:32] the people let everyone with his servant
[2:05:35] Lodge within Jerusalem
[2:05:38] in other words nobody on the outside
[2:05:40] everybody come inside be come inside the
[2:05:42] water
[2:05:43] come inside
[2:05:44] don't be on the outside don't miss
[2:05:46] church trying to fight by yourself
[2:05:52] let us band together because together
[2:05:53] the enemy have not known one without a
[2:05:56] thousand five but two ten thousand
[2:05:59] there's strength and unity there's
[2:06:01] strength and there's two shall agree
[2:06:02] touching anything you agreeing all by
[2:06:04] yourself but that's two people shall
[2:06:05] agree touching anything
[2:06:09] let everyone with a servant Lord within
[2:06:11] Jerusalem and in the night they may be a
[2:06:13] guard to us and labor on the day
[2:06:15] so so neither I nor my brethren nor my
[2:06:19] servants nor the men of the garbage
[2:06:21] followed me none of us put off our
[2:06:23] clothes
[2:06:26] saving that everyone put them off for
[2:06:29] washing in other words I fell asleep
[2:06:31] with their boots on
[2:06:35] put on
[2:06:37] because they're ready all the time you
[2:06:39] don't have to get ready friends if
[2:06:40] you're staying ready
[2:06:41] and that's the word tonight
[2:06:43] you'd have to get rid of this game and
[2:06:45] he's still ready
[2:06:46] Stay Ready Stay Ready oh Hallelujah I'm
[2:06:50] not gonna be too much longer until you
[2:06:52] appreciate the Lord this morning
[2:06:58] before we close out the service today
[2:07:00] we will be asking all of the
[2:07:03] young people those going to school
[2:07:05] University whatever
[2:07:07] and all the teachers as well to stand
[2:07:09] for prayer we're going to pray with you
[2:07:11] because it's not just the students need
[2:07:13] prayer
[2:07:17] these rebellious spirits
[2:07:20] that any school is different now yeah
[2:07:23] and teachers are also under attack
[2:07:26] she wanted fortified teachers and the
[2:07:28] students
[2:07:29] that's important here today
[2:07:31] that God could preserve them in their
[2:07:33] schools and they don't lose their desire
[2:07:35] to serve the Lord
[2:07:37] and they don't allow the influences and
[2:07:39] the conversations and the peer pressure
[2:07:42] [Applause]
[2:07:48] to be read from Nehemiah
[2:07:51] and we read from Ephesians
[2:07:53] but putting on the whole armor of
[2:07:56] the Lord
[2:07:58] a message to remind us that we are in a
[2:08:01] battle
[2:08:02] in a real battle
[2:08:03] and whether you're tired thinking about
[2:08:05] giving up maybe you're discouraging I'm
[2:08:07] so happy for those of you who made it
[2:08:09] here and I want you to catch a burden
[2:08:10] for those who are not here
[2:08:14] because we're in a real battle
[2:08:18] and many times we don't realize when
[2:08:20] we're losing ground
[2:08:26] and we want to encourage you this
[2:08:28] morning that this war field we're going
[2:08:30] through is not now starting it's a war
[2:08:31] that's been going on since
[2:08:34] since in heaven
[2:08:36] the war started in heaven so you have to
[2:08:38] get used to the fact that this war thing
[2:08:40] is a thing that's been going on for some
[2:08:41] time and the war that certain Heaven
[2:08:43] became a war that we are engaged in
[2:08:46] it's a military operation and the enemy
[2:08:48] is not taking prisoners
[2:08:50] he has white people how do you need to
[2:08:52] take your mind
[2:08:53] because if you go insane it could never
[2:08:55] come down on the signing of this thing
[2:08:57] so you have to guard your mind you have
[2:08:59] to guard your heart
[2:09:01] guard your heart
[2:09:03] and every service we come to is not to
[2:09:05] be taken for granted because it's
[2:09:07] getting us more prepared for battle as
[2:09:10] we wait for the Dynamics for the final
[2:09:12] showdown
[2:09:13] because demon and devil but the Devil
[2:09:16] Himself will wage war
[2:09:20] and it'll be so mad when this bride
[2:09:22] leaves the Earth he will go after the
[2:09:24] remnant
[2:09:27] so we have to fight for every inch of
[2:09:29] ground to make it to the rapture
[2:09:34] and God help those who don't make their
[2:09:37] object
[2:09:38] because they will deal with all the
[2:09:39] enemy
[2:09:40] and his anger for those who got away
[2:09:44] God had to pull us out of the world
[2:09:48] brought us to our understanding and a
[2:09:51] revelation of this message of the hour
[2:09:53] that is not just scripture but the light
[2:09:55] shown on the scripture from the message
[2:09:58] of the Prophet to give us a clean
[2:10:00] visibility into what was sealed in this
[2:10:02] book so that we could have Clarity of
[2:10:05] what our promises are so we can get
[2:10:07] ready to leave
[2:10:09] and because of this message we don't
[2:10:11] have a simple understanding of God and
[2:10:13] who God is but God revealed himself in
[2:10:15] Simplicity to us as the Life of Christ
[2:10:18] the Holy Ghost itself in US
[2:10:20] living himself out so it's not about you
[2:10:24] working yourself up to do something but
[2:10:27] it's about total surrender and crime in
[2:10:29] the pyramid
[2:10:31] [Applause]
[2:10:32] until you are sealed as an individual
[2:10:35] and that being when it's completed is
[2:10:37] the being that goes in the rapture
[2:10:39] but a crime also means a fight
[2:10:42] it means to die out and to fight
[2:10:45] and every death is a fight because you
[2:10:47] have to fight today
[2:10:49] [Applause]
[2:10:50] die out of your feelings your thinking
[2:10:53] diet or how you want to dress how you
[2:10:55] want to speak diet to where you want to
[2:10:56] go and what you want to do it's a death
[2:11:01] and the thing is you can choose a
[2:11:04] journey God takes you through
[2:11:06] God chooses that for us with one desire
[2:11:09] to shape our character
[2:11:11] so that when we get through it
[2:11:13] we are looking like him
[2:11:17] so it's a time of preparation and just
[2:11:19] like in the Army where you can't just go
[2:11:21] to war just like that
[2:11:23] there's training there's chastisement
[2:11:26] there's lift your head up there's keep
[2:11:29] your boots shining there's the
[2:11:30] discipline of the word there's that's
[2:11:32] not how you operate that's not how you
[2:11:34] speak to a superior officer that's not
[2:11:36] how you move you need to report on time
[2:11:38] you need to live a certain way you need
[2:11:40] to have a prayer life you need to
[2:11:42] worship you need to be in the house of
[2:11:43] God your car report when you want to
[2:11:45] report you need to report a duty every
[2:11:47] time on time a certain way because any
[2:11:50] army
[2:11:57] so you could be a true fighter
[2:12:00] so this is not the time for you to live
[2:12:01] die and run and hide
[2:12:03] is it time to stop running understand
[2:12:05] and to fight we read that scripture
[2:12:08] having done all to stand stand
[2:12:10] after your prayers stand don't give up
[2:12:13] after you try talking to your children
[2:12:14] stand
[2:12:15] after you apply for a job I didn't get
[2:12:17] it stand
[2:12:19] after you pray for the Holy Ghost stand
[2:12:22] don't give up
[2:12:24] after your side and Christ and from the
[2:12:27] message as I was with Moses let
[2:12:28] everything go wrong let everybody else
[2:12:30] Prosper let the others Prosper let the
[2:12:33] men who have a form of godliness deny

[2:14:17] that's better to fight you were born an
[2:14:19] overcomer and we are declaring war on
[2:14:22] the enemy for too long we have allowed
[2:14:24] the enemy to have us on the ropes but
[2:14:27] this morning we are coming off the ropes
[2:14:29] and we are taking the fight to the enemy
[2:14:32] this morning we are rebuilding the walls
[2:14:35] the walls around the church the walls
[2:14:37] are on our homes the walls are on our
[2:14:39] desk in our job the world's in the
[2:14:42] schools the walls that protect our
[2:14:43] testimony the devil will not have it
[2:14:46] easy we will not make it easy for the
[2:14:48] enemy to come into our homes we will not
[2:14:51] make it easy for the enemy to come into
[2:14:53] our hearts we will make it very
[2:14:55] difficult for the enemy to take our joy
[2:14:57] we will make it very difficult for the
[2:15:00] enemy to take our Victory we will make
[2:15:02] it nearly impossible for the enemy to
[2:15:05] take our family until as we grow it will
[2:15:08] become impossible for the enemy to come
[2:15:11] into our homes oh come on now foreign
[2:15:19] [Applause]
[2:15:27] for the bride to get into her position
[2:15:29] the third phase adoption time that third
[2:15:33] step up please and Christ's up then the
[2:15:36] Philistines will get to bucking up up
[2:15:39] that's what we're looking for for the
[2:15:41] power of God the Holy Ghost itself up
[2:15:44] doesn't step into the church to step
[2:15:46] into individuals in the church
[2:15:53] listen Nehemiah didn't have an
[2:15:56] intellectual Revelation he wasn't
[2:15:58] leading by intellectual Revelation it
[2:16:00] was Godly wisdom that was directed
[2:16:03] Nehemiah and it'll take Godly wisdom to
[2:16:06] direct fathers now it will take Godly
[2:16:08] wisdom to direct mothers now it'll take
[2:16:11] Godly wisdom to direct young people now
[2:16:14] Hallelujah and he promised he'll be with
[2:16:17] you even in you
[2:16:21] the battle is not yours it's the Lord's
[2:16:23] but he's gonna use you for the battle oh
[2:16:26] you don't hear me this morning
[2:16:29] I'm almost finished
[2:16:31] oh Hallelujah
[2:16:39] we're on the home stretch now the church
[2:16:41] in the massive adoption the church is
[2:16:44] supposed to be predestinated under the
[2:16:46] adoption of children
[2:16:49] where God can take a man
[2:16:51] and adopt him into the family and give
[2:16:54] him something first try it and see if
[2:16:56] it's right the Bible said try the
[2:16:58] spirits the man claim a certain thing
[2:17:00] tried and save his right if it's right
[2:17:03] move with it then say Lord send us
[2:17:05] something else just moving say every
[2:17:07] fellow take its place so that wall
[2:17:10] Nehemiah was putting men in their place
[2:17:14] and in this season
[2:17:16] God is putting men in their place he's
[2:17:19] putting women in their place he's
[2:17:21] putting sons in their place he's within
[2:17:23] taught us in their place so we could
[2:17:25] build and fight
[2:17:28] we're not just building a wall we're
[2:17:30] building a pyramid but while we build
[2:17:32] this touch of a perfect man why we build
[2:17:35] this Great Pyramid we are fighting and
[2:17:37] building
[2:17:38] every man in this place
[2:17:39] [Applause]
[2:17:44] [Music]
[2:17:45] then you're going to see the Church of
[2:17:47] God begin to get into place that's when
[2:17:51] the Philistines will go to backing up
[2:17:53] the shorts will go off here will grow
[2:17:56] down faces will be washed cigars will be
[2:17:59] missing that's right when the truth
[2:18:01] begins to get into its Mighty power when
[2:18:04] they have an anonymized and to fire a
[2:18:05] few of them yes sir you're still in that
[2:18:08] Holy Church stands again in its power
[2:18:10] positionally placed as sons of God
[2:18:13] adopted into the family of God
[2:18:21] the musician can get ready to come hard
[2:18:30] the problem with many of us is we have
[2:18:31] accepted what the enemy has done
[2:18:40] but luta fought
[2:18:42] Wesley Ford
[2:18:44] the Pentecostals fought
[2:18:46] with a Brandon Fort and this morning the
[2:18:48] bride
[2:18:49] that great marching Army is getting
[2:18:52] ready to fight we have been fighting but
[2:18:55] able to take up the fight and today

[2:19:25] fight for our fathers fight for our
[2:19:28] mothers fight for our young people fight
[2:19:31] for each other your Victory is connected
[2:19:34] to your worship but over picture imagine
[2:19:36] the Holy Ghost is connected to your
[2:19:37] worship so in worship you start fighting
[2:19:40] when you raise your hands do you know
[2:19:42] when they had that battle whenever Moses
[2:19:44] hand was up they were winning the battle
[2:19:46] and they have to hold Moses hand up
[2:19:49] because he was tired the burden mirror

[2:19:53] hands up they won the battle as the time
[2:19:56] begin to go down they start to lose a
[2:19:58] battle so this other hold his hands up
[2:20:00] so they can keep winning the battle this

[2:31:12] and it's
[2:31:15] we live in a time with whom invisions
[2:31:17] and
[2:31:19] there was a time people wouldn't bother
[2:31:22] the elderly
[2:31:23] no they're Robin grandmothers
[2:31:26] grandfathers
[2:31:29] killing them and knocking them
[2:31:31] unconsciously take a few dollars

[2:31:35] no respect for the elderly
[2:31:38] no respect for churches
[2:31:40] no respect for God

[2:31:45] no love left on the Earth
[2:31:47] except that the love that's in the bride
[2:31:51] so God this friends
[2:31:54] guide this with you all don't take these
[2:31:57] services for granted

[2:32:08] testimony
[2:32:10] that you identify with this gospel
[2:32:13] but more importantly this gospel is
[2:32:15] identified with you
