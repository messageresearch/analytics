foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] good day friends God bless you thank you so much for allowing us into your homes wherever you are this Christmas Day we just want to start with the word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and we thank you for the gift that you release on the earth even Jesus to make a winner we could get the gift the true gift of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we thank you for coming to this earth to bring Good Will towards men to bring Deliverance to bring breakthrough and to bring Redemption we pray that you will come on especially this morning and visit your people father With Your Love With Your Grace with your mercy with your kindness and most of all with your car because it will take power to live here we are such a needy people this morning but we thank you for the gift of your love that has given us this opportunity to serve you in spirit and Truth father God May our hearts Rejoice this morning and be full of praise and thanksgiving for you for what you have done and the price that you have paid granted Lord and Jesus might ask it amen and amen well this morning is a special presentation we have and we'd like to share something with you and then we have a service that we like to play for you reading from Matthew chapter 2 reading from verse 10 to 11. and when they saw the star they Rejoice with exceeding great joy and Wendy would come into the homes they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and murder may God bless his word and gold frankincense and myrrh these are the three wise men that travel from far with a revelation that they will be able with their gifts that they could identify the Messiah For That season and we know goal frankincense and myrrh and they were not copying one another following one another what this one doing this one doing and so on like that they were moving by Revelation each one having a Consciousness that the gifts that they had and they brought was going to identify something they may not have it together to say how we're going to blend in together but the new the gift that God gave them was from God gold speaks of deity frankincense speaks of service and myrrh speaks of death but the combination of these three gifts spoke of God in service to die and the prophet said something here the things that we bring to him identify what our thoughts is about him you understand what I mean if you believe it with all your heart every word of God you will identify it by giving all that you have to it deity had to be put to death in order to save the imperfect one what a great thing and when Mary Magdalene she but this murder to anoint Jesus in John 12 7 Jesus said let her alone against the day of my burying that she kept this it's expensive ointment for the poor always you have with you but me ye have not always so we are grateful for Christmas it's not to say I give Jones a gift and they give back one I'll see what I've got in the morning why don't you open up your heart and see and see what's in there find out what you got in here if we find it empty with negative trees and cares of the world why not ask Christ to fill it tonight tonight so that you will get the real meaning of Christmas it is Christ in you God dwelling in the human heart that is what the real Christmas Means so God anointed Jesus with the fullness of himself he was God's gift to the world and the wise men are clearly identified they were offering their gift to him show that in their heart they knew who he was what he was going to do for them so no wonder the first thing they did they fell down perfectly in order and worship him before they could even understand it they fell down and worshiped him and then presented their gifts and that's the way to have real Christmas worship Him then present your gift presenting your body a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God guided these men with those gifts God guided in my Giants because they had the right gifts and God guided these wise men because they had the right identified gift to identify his son and may I say this God because of the word spoken of a faithful Ministry with protect guide and look over those gifts that will be for the Perfection of the Saints and bringing that bride into the statue of a perfect man so I say this always watch what these ministerial gifts are identifying or what they are pointing to Christ here we go was identified by goal my and frankincense and I wanted to challenge you to look again at these treatings goal God mer dead frankincense service every life must have that same identification so your life must have an identification of God your life must have an identification of death and your life must have identification of service and he will protect the gift that you are and the gift that you have until his purpose issues and as I close to this part here praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord Joseph Mary Joseph see me what was Isaiah prophecy under us son is born a child has given you shall be called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father of his kingdom there shall be no end he knew who that would be he saw the whole thing when the angel of the Lord told him that this which is conceived in her talk about Mary is of the Holy Ghost a virgin shall conceive and be a son that was a great mystery the super sign that God gave to all the world a super sign that he was his son now notice as we go on when Jesus was being formed in Mary here we go when Christ Jesus was being formed in Mary that is when the persecution set in that's right that is when our persecution started and it's the same thing in you Galatians 4 19 says when Christ the hope of glory formed in you when Christ here we go is being formed in you when you are dying that's the main part when you are dying and Christ is coming to life watch the persecution set in what troubles start on every hand watch The Devil go on a rampage certainly when Christ is being formed in you and when Christ was being formed in Mary quickly come to King's commandment all the people the Christ was being coming a full baby ready to be delivered and right then great persecution what is the prophecy hanging over the bride that the full word which is the full seed will be born into manifestation the Dynamics to normal mechanics so praise the Lord so now we will hear a special exude from the prophet of Malachi for brother William Marion Brown and then we come back right after that may the Lord bless you praise him for a little consecration service a little hard here tonight A dwelling place for Christ remember tonight my odd little story of the trans denied Greely Jesus Christ is that on the street right he was a on the street oh yeah we say we serving sure all the tinsel and glamor that's not him he had to die to bring you this gift not a doll but life he had to die in order to do it to get to you the only way he could get be he could just come here and be a perfect man like he was and get to you he couldn't do it that way he had to die to do it to get get the gift of God to you like the train had to die to get the little dog to his funeral Christ had to die to get God to you we want to accept it tonight I'll be with our heads found and that's just uh raise our hands to God and consecrate our lives and ride your attacks o gracious God we want your gift I'm here at this Christmas season Lord as

Shadow around us oh Jesus the light of the world can we give the Lord a hand of praise foreign so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and if you have your Bibles can we turn to just one portion of scripture reading from Saint Matthew chapter 2. and reading from verse one thank you brother Anthony thank you musicians Matthew chapter 2 reading from verse 1. now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold became wise men from the East to Jerusalem seeing ways he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship Him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are thou are at not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when he had found and when he had found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and low the star which we saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worship him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and moo and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod they departed into their own country another way and when they were departed behold the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream seeing arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring the word for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him and when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt and there was and was there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wrought and send forth and Sue all the children that were in Bethlehem and on all the cause there are from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so I have a title this morning for uh Christmas encouragement or Christmas message and my title is we have seen his star we have seen his star and for a subject the voice of the sign and an inspiration the identification of the true worshipers you know and we know from the message and we know through studying scripture but the Brandon brought it out so many times that December the 25th is not the day that Jesus would have been born and that date would have evolved from a mixture of trying to mix romanism with Christianity and paganism but the reality is as brother Branham said he said whenever people are speaking about Christmas the real Christians have a responsibility to bring up the truth of the birth of Jesus Christ because if Christ was not born there would be no salvation and if Christ was not born there would be no Redemption and if Christ was not born there would be no restoration and if Christ was not born there would be no deliverance and if if Christ was not born there would be no healing so the celebration of the birth of Christ is something that we ought to celebrate every day it is not just in December it is not on a certainty it is a celebration because it is connected to directly to who we are because if he did not come he could not have died if he did not come he could not have walked underwater and God rich in his grace and mercy promised a king he promised a governor he promised a ruler and he brought a baby [Applause] so when the devil is looking for a king and looking for a governor and looking for looking Harriet and looking for a horse here comes a baby and God slips a baby right under the devil's nose and that and that baby is born and right there in a Manger can the Church Say Amen so I greet you this morning and on behalf of brother Ovid and the ministry we want to wish you a blessed merry Christmas and I want to quote the prophet and a message says we would see Jesus he said God bless you not exactly a merry Christmas but God's blessings of Christmas be upon you may the Christ of Calvary hide you in himself blanket you so wrap you and enthrown you in his word till his word will be made flesh in you is my prayer and that is our prayer that is our desire for every believer here this morning can the Church Say Amen so we are going to be in the world this morning I'm excited about what is happening and I'm so happy to see the Believers who made it out here today you know Christmas is a time is a special time Christmas Means synonymously a number of things it means a time for family it means at times connecting it means a time for for him a time for for turkey a time for for different people it means it means different things the time to share gifts the time to connect with friends or a time to break diets it's a Time it's a time of a lot of different things and you always say we have to always remember the real reason for the season and as brother Branham would speak about this he would speak to the church he said I can't tell you how to raise your children you know but Christmas is not about Santa Claus he said if you lie to them about Santa Claus one needle wonder what else you lied about so tell them the truth the real truth about Christmas that and it's not about the gifts and it's not about the Santa Claus but there was a gift because God so loved the world and he gave his only begotten son and and that I call the first great gift and by the manaman preaching would say but there's another gift it's the gift of the Holy Ghost that's that's the real gift that he wanted to give his people and he would always say the best Christmas gift you could ever get is that eternal life the gift of the Holy Ghost and he would preach to the people that when you have a Christmas message that my desire for you is if I could give it to you myself I would but he is The Giver of the gift I'm he is still given the gift of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire and his promise is just as real as it was when he was here on Earth can the Church Say Amen oh Hallelujah oh so we're going to talk about Jesus this morning is that's okay is that okay with you for a few minutes let's talk about Jesus because we have seen his star and because we have seen his star we have come to worship the star woke us up this morning the star caught our attention and brother Branham said that that stock expressed a message because the star itself was a sign the star was not the end game the star was pointing to something that was happening the star was a prophetic message the star had a Voice the star raised questions can the church say Amen I'm already leaving my notes this morning but that's all right for 400 years there was no spiritual move that's what the prophet said prophecy had hung over the children of Israel hung over the Jews the last prophet Malachi had already left the scene and he he uttered behold I will send you Elijah before the great and Dreadful Team all those prophecies were hovering after 400 years there was silence but when the pranam taught us and scripture tells us God could do nothing in the spiritual unless there's a sign so before there's a spiritual happening there has got to be a sign and God had to place the sign with enough notice because there were some Gentiles who had to see the sign and they had to ask questions but the Branham said he is a wise men these were studied men these were spiritual men he said I could imagine and brother Brian I would paint a picture that every day every time they would get up into their Tower and they would look out to the stars but the problem said these men knew what every Star meant they know what every Star was connected to they know every movement meant they understood what everything was about them but all of a sudden one day they saw something they never saw before they saw something they could not explain and but the problem said maybe they went to their master yeah he said when you go back to the Book of Daniel when Daniel was here he was their Master over in Babylonian because all the sages and the wise men would come and discuss the stars and discuss the weather and discuss science and discuss and they said there's nothing we have to explain this sign the sign is a different kind of sign we have seen Stars we have seen constellations we have seen things before but this one is different [Applause] and it got them so curious it got them so excited but the problem said they may have looked through their own scriptures and found nothing remember the problem said maybe they went back to the Book of Daniel found when Daniel wrote about a stone cut out without the hands of man added to connect the pieces theologians describe these men as the king makers because for centuries it was the magized and the sages and the wise men that would convert together to anoint Kings thousands of years ago so when a father was dying and leaving his throne to his son or one of his sons the wise men would be summoned to look at the stars and look at the signs and let the king know that's the right son and when the king passed on they will come an anoint who was going to replace the king so God had some Gentiles who were the problem said they were also Believers because they believed in one God the hearts were pricked to say we have seen something and we have to investigate but they brought him said it took about two years two years of coldness two years of rugged Road and two years of camels and they didn't give up brother Branham said that's how the character of the Christian is more little through the hardship it wasn't a one-week Journey it wasn't a drive to church on Sunday morning it was two years two years of pushing two years of pressing two years of fighting I mean the problem said on the way to battle him they have to pass through Jerusalem the city that was the spiritual City holy Jerusalem and when they got there but the Terence they came in a Revival because they knew they were near to what they were looking for they came at sight where is he where is the king must is the Messiah on the earth now where are all the Miracles where's the king of kings oh and they made so much noise that the officers of the day brought these men in front of Herod and the Bible said Herod was troubled and all of Jerusalem not part of Jerusalem all of Jerusalem was troubled and then Herald called a Minister's meeting he said Brothers ministers scribes tell me what it says about the Christ and the Bible says they found where it was written so it was not that they didn't have it it was not that they didn't know it but they had forgotten about it because they were caught up in the rituals they were caught up in the traditions of but here come three men who were not from their City not from their Town not from their church not from their establishment but they came with the desire because God let them see the Stein oh Hallelujah Hallelujah and Herod and it's so beautiful because you see the clear this difference between what a man says with his mouth and what he says with his heart he said when you find him bring back word to me because I'm also a worshiper because I want to worship him too and these wise men left feeling that that was the right thing to do but you read the scripture God had to give them a dream to let them know pass the other way don't pass through the bypass don't pass back to Jerusalem take the other Road and head back home with your rejoicing because Kara's motive is not right can the Church Say Amen and we're gonna get to it later in the message but our worship is based on a sign the star was a sign it was pointing to the Messiah a prophet is a sign because the prophet is not to identify himself and brother Branham taught us that in the right hand of God he plays Seven Stars and these stars were to attract the people in their age and in their time to see that there was Messiah to reveal word on the earth at that time so Paul he was a star and those who saw the star had to follow the voice of the sign to see what the message was Paul did not Point people to himself but he was pointed to Jesus and he said if an angel comes out from heaven and preached any other gospel let him be your cursor but I'm pointing you to Jesus I'm pointing you to the Messiah I'm pointing you to the king of kings and and Paul was a star in the right hand of God [Applause] anybody in the house this morning anybody in the house just spawning we're gonna get to the real meaning of Christmas we get to the real meaning of what this is all about but we have seen his star that is what has us excited we have seen his top called himself place a star to catch our attention because some of us it's been two years we've been on the journey The Summer's been 40 years up on the journey but we will see the Lord's Christ up we will see Messiah we will see the King of Kings up we will see that great Governor we will see it we shall see the king or we are walking in the lightest morning oh you may be seated oh [Applause] Hallelujah so I'm bringing some types this morning those wise men they saw a natural star but we didn't see that star we were not there when they saw what they saw but we have also seen a star because the messengers of the seven Church ages but the problem said they are stars in the right hand of God and in our day we have had a star in our time we have had a star in our generation we have had a stop and that star has been pointing at the Messiah that star has been pointing to the revealed word we have seen his star oh Hallelujah and we are walking in that light we are walking in the light of that star this morning we are walking in the light of that message he may be seated I want to make sure this gets home this morning when that star appeared to the wise men that star was saying something that's Tower seeing a king is coming a king is coming a king is coming A King is Coming Messiah is coming the King of Kings is coming Redemption is coming Deliverance has come him the kingdom is coming Power is coming listen whatever the Magi is had whatever they had over there they realized that that sign spoke of something more more than they had before many knew before more than they experience before because if what they had was enough they didn't need to follow the stop but when they saw that sign they recognize there's more there's more to waking up in the morning I'm going to work there's more that waking up and baking a ham there's more than picking a turkey Messiah is on the earth the whole creation the whole of nature is groaning for deliverance oh Hallelujah somebody help me preach this morning you may be seated it's wise men whatever anointed Kings before these wise men would have anointed leaders before but what stirred them is there was never a king like this King there was never us never a king like like somebody preached back to me anybody in the house this morning Hallelujah oh Hallelujah oh Hallelujah Hallelujah keep on your spiritual hacks this morning [Applause] and when they came and they saw the young child they testified not just with words but they they brought a gift to identify that they had a revelation of what the star was pointing to they brought gold to identify his kingship they fought frankincense to identify his priesthood and they brought myrrh to identify that he was the sacrifice and these men who were not from Jerusalem they were not from the tribe of Levites they were not from the tribe of Israel but God ministered to them and find them where they were and give them a deeper Revelation that Messiah was on the earth up Herod didn't know it the priest didn't know it the ministers didn't know it the whole of Jerusalem the Bible says they were all troubled [Music] but not these men what was their testimony they didn't even see a miracle [Music] they just saw the star didn't see a sign of they just saw the Stars star and that star gave them enough Faith to believe the impossible to believe that Messiah could be on the earth now can the church Say Amen oh we're talking about Jesus this morning I'm not going to be too long with you but ride with me for a few minutes this morning with a Branham in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed said he is talking about Jesus is the principal theme of The Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms of he was in the history and he also in the Bible is the things that is to come so he was before until after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever and to us this morning he is still the same yesterday the same today and the same forever can the Church Say Amen oh Hallelujah that's when I paint a picture of the different things that are happening around this this birth of Jesus Christ for all of the Old Testament but the Branham said it spoke of Jesus he said if you read the Bible and you read a verse and don't see Jesus in every verse go read it again because he is a principal theme of The Bible every Prophet every messenger every Apostle every teacher and every believer what unites us is not church or doctrine it's Jesus that is what brings us together it's because of Jesus whenever we lose sight of the Messiah we'll lose sight of the whole picture so the picture is painted and God is about to unveil his masterpiece we have preached it before there was so much locked up in God he could release it all at once through the Old Testament so the attribute and God of being a shepherd He used David to display the shepherd attribute of God in God was locked up Prophet so he used Elijah and the prophets to display that attribute and God was locked up the warrior he will fight your battle so when God was was he used Joshua to display that attribute and God was the attribute he may Deliver us so he used Moses for a small part of his story to show he could he could open the barren wounds he took Sarah who was dried up and opened her wombs to show that he could change any situation [Applause] that he was the resurrection he is the resurrection he is the life [Applause] throughout scripture even before Jesus got there we see Elijah yeah praying for the boy who was dead and that boy came to life we saw lepers healed we saw Miracles the ax float we saw men who didn't even have the Holy Ghost but because they were expressions of his attributes they could not help but display what was locked up in God they made mistakes they failed but they could not help be an extension of the attribute of God because God was fighting to get what was locked up in him expressed it it could not have helped him God doesn't need healing for himself he doesn't need to be delivered he doesn't need a miracle it is for people who need a healing and need a miracle it makes no sense for God to have it locked up and nobody could access it or you don't hear me this morning [Applause] [Music] the ability of God to open the blinded eyes is not for his benefit because he is not blind you don't hear me this morning there the ability of God to make the cripples Walkers is not for his benefit because he is not crippled his his hand is not too short that he could oh you don't hear me this morning can we preach a little bit so it's been God's business to get his attributes to be expressed but when the Branham taught us that God needs a vessel he needs somebody to walk through he doesn't want to walk through the the nature he wants to use somebody [Music] so in every age Gideon the Mighty Man of Valor to show that his strength is made perfect in your weakness when when Gideon lacked confidence and Gideon lacked self-esteemer Gideon that his strength could be made perfect in weakness or you don't hear me this morning anybody in the house oh and when your back is against the wall a man like shamga who by the brand undescribers of farmer with his little outfit when your back is against the wall in God had the attribute to say enough is enough I'm not taking this no more I'm not taking pressure from the devil no more I'm not taking the attack of the Enemy No More I've worked too hard I've struggled too long I've given too much I've invested my all you don't hear me this morning and when shamgar saw the Philistines coming look around and he took the ox code it was not shamga it was not the ox code but God said that the attribute of when your back is against the wall and you need to know it could be done look at changa draw strength from him because through shanga I saw the attribute that's in me to fight when your back is against the wall that's right Hallelujah Hallelujah anybody in the house this morning so God is unveiling himself he's unveiling in himself he is slowly If my people will humble themselves and pray he is using prophets he's using little boys he's using Kings he's using he's using one man he's using Hannah and the temple who is crying out and they're all expressing Jesus they're all speaking about Jesus they are not living for themselves they are not acting for themselves in their own little way [Applause] yeah speaking about Jesus and then the time came then the season changed then the hour came and God had to find a way to slip the king onto the Earth without fanfare [Applause] without attention because it's an infiltration because brother Branham preached that the devil is a God of this evil age so he is kind of running things on the earth so God wants to bring a nuclear weapon and slip it through eternity into time to deal with this aberrant issue of Lucifer and his fallen angels but the law of God requires two witnesses for everything to be established so he's setting things up and he starts off and he starts off with a priest who is a kind of half-time priest he's not a full-time priest name is Zachariah and it's his requirement I think it's a fortnight in the year once in the year he has to go and and offer incense while the Believers are praying he is offering incense to God and he's praying for the people but he also has a need because his wife Elizabeth has not had a child and it's been in their marriage in their relationship in this situation so he has a burden in his spirit in his soul and while he's here doing his duties he has a visitor [Applause] from the presence of almighty God sent a secret agent he says have to be in position because the Messiah is coming somebody have to roll out the red carpet in secret because the devil can't know it's happening so God sends Gabriel Gabriel handle it okay all right and Gabriel comes to Zachariah says Zechariah your prayers have been answered you've been praying for a long time I just want you to know God has heard your prayers and I've come to let you know what a message to know you've been praying and sighing and crying and pouring out at the old top Zechariah pouring incense and he said Lord my wife Lord my house Lord our people your prayers answered your wife's gonna have a chat and Gabriel he disappears but he's on a mission because a few months later he has another visitation to do a little lady named Mary a spouse a man called Joseph I know you know the story but it's good to talk about Jesus but the parents said when we talk about him he comes near he loves when we talk about him we could talk about the church we could talk about them but when you talk about Jesus oh he loves to come there when you talk about him he loves to be the center of our attention he loves to be the center of our joy he loves to be the reason of the Season not just in December but in January in February in March on Sunday on Monday on Tuesday every day when Jesus is sweeter than the day before can I just talk to you a little bit I'm going to leave the note we're just gonna just talk about Jesus a little bit so Here Comes Mary everybody knows the prophecy a virgin shall conceive and people don't understand the time you know it's God talking because brother Abraham said it's unusual it's unusual when God talks it's unusual the match don't add up and it's not supposed to add up because if my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are I my ways like your way so when I'm planning stuff it's all to confuse the enemy don't try to figure it out so a virgin shall conceive foreign Comes Mary doing what she's normally doing and that's usually how it is you're going about your normal routine you live in your normal life and then something interrupts your normal schedule to get your attention and here comes this Archangel Gabriel Hail Mary toward highly favored among all women and Mary not buying the story yet so what are you talking about people say you're going to have a child and his his name Shall be Called wonderful his his name Shall be Called counselor his name shall be corporate and Gabriel is describing this thing is excited because for for centuries and for thousands years breaking me till the time this has been what they've been waiting for [Applause] and then Mary asks one question how shall this thing be and Gabriel said the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and in the message we have seen his time and come to worship for the Bible said the Holy Ghost is the father so the child is the father's child so Mary is exposed to Joseph but she's excited because she has this message I'm gonna have a baby and but Ibraham dramatizes that she runs to Elizabeth it wasn't a walk and by the Branham described he said maybe they hug one another how are you doing holy baby coming along and Elizabeth says I'm not too sure you know this is about the Branham he says the baby hasn't moved it's been six months and you know normally by three to four months the baby should at least move something tell you I'm having a baby too so brother Branham said Elizabeth asked why I didn't invite me to the wedding I know you was engaged to Joseph but I didn't get Hulk I'm your cousin oh why didn't invite me and Mary said well I get to marry him yet and brother Branham described you say and Elizabeth is like what you telling me what you talking about you you Sister Mary you you know you living right you what you're talking about [Applause] and by the Branham said Mary said to describe her experience with the angel is describing it and the angel told me that and the angel told me and then she got to the path and the angel told me his name will be called and she started to go down into the names and but the problem said when the name of Jesus was spoken son in his mother's womb who hadn't moved before with the Palms at the Holy Ghost filled John in his mother's womb he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was born from his mother's womb with the baptism after holy ghost at the name of Jesus still power in the name of Jesus Hallelujah we know the story I'm not going to be too long but we love talking about Jesus so everything is getting into place because John has to forerun the coming of Christ somebody has to roll out the red carpet for the king to walk on it come on now so John has a mission to foreign the coming of the Messiah [Applause] meanwhile why this is going on the wise men are walking all of this happening the wise men on their Journey before the first presentation the wise men already left because brother Brown said takes about two years for them fellas to get there so Mary Noggin word the wise men already know because they have seen this sign they have seen this star in the east and they're coming on the expectation for a perfect timing can the Church Say Amen oh can we give the Lord a handle of praise whatever amen Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Oh Glory but the Branham is so wonderful in this message you see how Mary would have told you about you look so pretty but the random describes the whole thing and when the Madam goes on to speak about how God moves things around for his purpose and he brings out in the same message and when you've got time you can read it how God uses visions and uses dreams and he speaks of how a prophet is able to combine his subconscious and his conscience together so with his eyes open he could see a vision but unless you're a prophet God has to wait until normal man goes to sleep and his Consciousness is asleep for his subconscious to be active for God to present himself in a dream so Joseph brother Branham said is an honorable man he's wondering how to handle the situation how to deal with the situation with this Mary and he can't believe you you can imagine little turmoil how a heiling the situation and then God visits Joseph in a dream and say Joseph don't be afraid to take your wife because what is in her is of the Holy Ghost and God used a dream with her God is a dream with a wise man and God is fixing things around because this has to happen in perfect order Jesus is about to be born and herrogate inspired the government can inspired to raise taxes because the law have to change to drive Mary to have the baby where the baby is supposed to be born [Applause] and brother Branham says it was not easy for Mary dramatized the conversation he said Mary would be saying to Joseph Joseph don't worry we're going to make it we're not going to be only ones on the road it's other people have to go to if we get in trouble we'll get help when he wrote somebody will help me I'm pregnant and but the random describes the donkey that they would have gone on what what a donkey that was to carry the king I want you to go back there go back to time with me to see this whole thing unfolding and they see the journey with Mary going through the Dayton and brother said imagine Mary will ask Joseph do you want to take a ride on the donkey now because I've been on a dog the whole time and Joseph saying no no no you stay there because you're carrying the baby and but the problem is revealing this whole thing as it unfolds and falls and falls over time says when God allowed the taxes to be raised God will do whatever he needs to do and what will allow what the devil does to get him praise also so every action or reaction to you is for his purpose and for his honor and for his glory can the Church Say Amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah but the Madam said while he was thinking on these things he was a good man he didn't want his own name mad brother said Joseph was thinking about being a shield for her and brother goes on and on and he's bringing out this whole beautiful Christmas Story can the Church Say Amen Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory and he said that when God revealed himself to Joseph he said when a man can reveal that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter how many Creed try to turn it back you're glad to be a shield so he said Joseph became a shield for Mary you're happy to be a shield let them say whatever you got a big Shield up there to knock the fiery dots off he said I hope I don't get too loud for them out there let them hear it too they ought to notice it you're happy to be a shield you're a doormat whatever wants to be it doesn't matter it's been revealed to you by the Lord and the Lord has shown it to you by his word is the truth and then confirm it to you to make it live again dear it is mine nothing to go on can the church say Amen Oh Glory Glory Glory can the Church Say Amen right Glory hallelujah hallelujah oh Hallelujah brother Adam said when Christ was being formed in Mary quickly come the king's commandment all you people just as she was the Christ was becoming a baby ready to be delivered right then the great persecution but this is coming in the last days when the completeness when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifested among his people he promised it in his word and when that fullness you see there is unusual things begin to happen that he promised that's the reason or a great social lives and things can't understand it it's foolishness to them now watch they're forming a council of churches just the time when the church is beginning to get to its feet where the Supernatural is going to begin to work now they all went into that group and they're going to try to stop this stuff so but Ibrahim is saying as Mary is about to have the baby all the persecution begins to rise up but Abraham said it this way see when you're praying and you're about to breakthrough that's the hardest purchase before you break through just before your blessing that's when the persecution begins oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he stood there and brother is dramatizing he said Mary was in pain and after a while he comes at the top of the hill and once again they look over into the city where they were born over in Bethlehem the lights of the city many was their places was crowded people on the outside sleeping on the ground out along in the fields and the question perhaps the first time it struck Joseph what will I do if I can't find a place because this baby might be born tonight she's been in pain all day so what if the baby is going to be born tonight and brother Venom is dramatizing and he said they're looking down across the valley wandering his eyes happened to look over sideways and he saw a strange sight you know it's usually right in time or trouble when Supernatural things happen and he looked over there and he saw a star he had never remembered see so big it looked so low like it was hanging right over Bethlehem and he looked up and he turned after he helped Mary up on a rock to rest a little while he turned around to say dear did you ever notice and he could even see his reflection listen to the prophet he could see the star's reflection in her pretty black eyes it's as if the problem is standing right they're watching this whole thing unfold and look smiling there isn't that strange she said Joseph honey I have watched that since the sun went down I've been watching that star somehow another I feel real strange tonight that something is fixing to happen it's usually that way you know you have that that tree and spirit S as you begin to rest breathing and they watch USA it had an odd action to it it didn't act like the rest of stars it it seemed to be restless moving it was waiting for something watching for something to happen Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory now let's leave our little couple right here on the rock for a minute leaves them on the rock and travels on the way back over to India to speak about the wise men and how God declares his doings in the heavens before he does it on Earth and he speaks of these wise men came from the line of wise men and Daniel was the prophet he was their master and God is no respecter of person so he could use anybody and these men believe that there was one God and they would study the night and study the stars and they would burn fire at night and they watch and they worship and every night they would climb up there as soon as the sun went down and study these things just like we get together at conferences and study the Bible and word by word they node every move of them Stars and one night while they were up there studying and no wonder it was most alarming when a visitor appeared among them a stranger they had never seen that star before he didn't know what was this was they had no wonder they were alarmed they didn't know what to do about it it was a phenomena so it caught their attention has done something caught your attention to bring you to this great gospel to bring you to this great message to bring you to this great moment oh hallelujah hallelujah and brother random goes on I'm going to skip through it because I've already touched it but when the mom said Divine Healing is for the Believers the Holy Ghost is to them that believe not to the unbelievers and they're on their Journey with their goal their frankincense and men oh Hallelujah can we give the Lord a hand of praise said on their Journey they watched he said they never took anybody's wood they didn't go down and consult any bishop or anything God gave them a sign they've seen it it was the truth they took out after it it led the way it was the one the scripture predicted to and friends that's what's needed today it's a revelation from God to follow the sign what is our sign in our day is the prophet's message because he was a star in the hand of God for our day and he didn't Point them to himself he said he had to build a denomination I made the population of people to myself but I'm pointing to the resurrected Christ I'm pointing to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and that's the message that we hold to our hearts today oh Hallelujah but if I said nobody else saw it but these men saw it he said nobody saw the light that Paul saw when it struck him on the road to Damascus oh hallelujah oh my my my my he said but when you are looking for it when you are ready to receive the real Christmas present the real Christmas give God Christ give the Holy Spirit you're looking for it you'll see it it's a heaven light sent down from God out of Heaven to be a record of Jesus Christ they didn't take anybody's elsewhere for it in the daytime it was Restless they say oh I just can't wait I don't know how much longer we'll go we'll probably go to Jerusalem remember the light only shines in darkness is the only way it's recognize if we live in the dark time so whenever his brain out in the daytime they couldn't see the star so they would be arrested but at night when they see the stock come out they will be able to follow it on down through the rivers through the sandbars and everything else and by the random types all of this as through your struggles through your trials through your journey through your situation you are following the reveal world you are following Jesus Christ the light of the world straight to your promise Hallelujah and brother Branham says and I just want to get his words in it and look Bethlehem was exactly in line with Judea from where they and Jerusalem was in line with Bethlehem Oh What a symbol if you can catch it here's Bethlehem and Jerusalem is up here and from where the Magi was coming they had to come to Jerusalem first because before before coming to Bethlehem I'm not going to be too much longer do you get it the great big self-style denominational headquarters yes sir Jerusalem where all the denominations met together the great Council met there so when these men they came and they come to this city and the thought there it is if anybody will know about this and can explain this great mystery light to us there's all the high priests here there's the doctors of divinity here there's all the PHD and lldo brethruent Jerusalem is in sight here we go we'll have it right into the streets they burst it where are you going we got a great message where is it where is he that's born King of the Jews who is this mystery light up there brother Branham said to cry goes out and nobody responded nobody knows what's going on they are sitting on with all the Scrolls from the prophet Moses they have all the books and tips and they have no idea because they were not looking for the sign oh Hallelujah Glory hmm he said what's the matter with you see but the brother said they didn't have the answer but I said they haven't got it today they don't know what these things are where they ought to know it where the great heads of churches ought to be aware of these things but God always works in the minority and so humble that it goes right over top of them they don't know it but he fulfills his word like that that's it we get our own self twisted up in these great big things and we can't move God cut us free from them things that we can see what our we're living in if God has to walk through a dream again he can reveal it to you sure he said they had not the answer of the mysterious life they didn't know they didn't have it at the headquarters neither do they have it today so what did they do they call for the word of God he said that's the idea they says let's look up in the will of God and find out where these things are and when they call for the word of God the Magi was smarter than a lot of people today the marriage I saw according to the word of God that they didn't have it and wasn't going to get it they found out that there wasn't even the city that wasn't even a place he was born in Bethlehem of Judea of the least the humblers among all of them the little bitty tiny place not the big sales title wise men seen right quick the word of God revealed it and it didn't have it and wasn't going to get it so they got out of that mess if we could just do the same get out of the mess brother Branham said after they got out of the mind and find out where Christ was going to be born the star hit himself disappeared but when it came out of Jerusalem dare the star appeared again there it was he said after they got cut loose from those things after they got out of all them conglomeration of their fussing argument and everything down there with all the big headquarters was and the big high priests and doctors of divinity and I never walked around and what's the matter with these crazy people so they turn their cameras and got away from it but the man said as long as you tied up with a bunch of unbelievers that don't believe these things you'll never be able you'll be as blind as a bat cut yourself away from everything he said if it's mother father sister brother the nomination or whatever it is he said he that won't forsake his own and come after me is not even worthy to be called mine but if I said it means just what it says the Bible said it's of no private interpretation if it's black it's black and white is white that's a prophet's word it's the ultimate it's the absolute and every man that's born of the spirit of God is tighter that no matter nothing will separate him from it he's tied to that word because it's Christ Christ is the word and Christ cannot lie about his word for he is the word and you and and you say well I know he said that but he said there ain't no but and nothing about it he just said it that way and that's what it is he cannot change it he can't he's unchangeable he said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away can the church say a amen so I just want to touch on our star and we begin to wind down but the Brahman said in the exposition of the seven Church ages the sadition churches so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of God working out the will and word of God in different Generations I would like to illustrate that from the word the spirit of God was mightily upon Elijah then that same Spirit Came Upon Elisha in a twofold effect then centuries later The Same Spirit which we call a spirit of Elijah in order to describe its Ministry came back upon John the Baptist one day that same Spirit identified by the same manner of ministry will come upon a man for the end of the Gentile Church age he's speaking about himself now again the scripture says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power and he went about doing good hearing all that was oppressed of the devil as Jesus went away he told his disciples that Tarry until Pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them then that called out body the church will be in his stand upon the Earth taking his place and because that same spirit that was in him would be in them they would do the very same works and any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works as the Jesus and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to account to God it also says here that these Seven Stars or seven Messengers to the seven churches are in his hand he is holding them you know right away that if they are held in his hand they are associated with his power that is what the hand signifies it signifies the power of God and authority of God not one of them came in his own power and authority that is what Paul said no man would dare to it takes the authority of God and the power of the Holy Ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of God in the power of the spirit these men were all empowered by the Holy Ghost they all stand up to the world they could do that they were full of God they were sent or authorized by God not by self or other men and in the patwa's vision last major quote but the Branham said the mystery of the Seven Stars in Revelation which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels or messengers of the seven Church ages and the Seven Cardinal sexual saw us are the seven churches we have already discovered the truth of these two Mysteries oh we haven't revealed who these seven Messengers were but by the help of God we will and that mystery will be accomplished The Seven Ages we know they are listed in the world and we will deal with each so as to come up to this last age in which we live but in one last closing glimpse of this chapter see him as he stands there in the midst of the Golden Lamb stands with the Seven Stars in his right hand oh it is breathtaking to see him standing there in his Supreme deity he is the judge the priest the king the eagle the lamb the lion the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end the father son the Holy Ghost he which was which is which is to come the almighty the all in all there he is the Altar and finisher Worthy is that lamb he proved his word as he brought our salvation by himself now he stands in all of his his power and all of his glory all things committed unto him as judge yesterday he stands amidst the lamb stands with the Stars in his hand it is night for that is when we use lamps for the light and that is when the stars are seen shining and reflecting the light of the sun and it is dark the church is walking by faith in the darkness her Lord departed his Earth but the Holy Spirit still shines out through the church giving light to this old sin cursed world and those stars reflect his light also and the only light they have is his light how dark it is how spiritually Cold Yet when he comes into the midst of it his light and warm the church is empowered and through him does the works that he did all that people might get a glimpse of him as did John what manner of people he ought to be standing before him at that day but the Branham now begins to switch he said if you haven't already given your life to him may you turn your heart to God this moment and kneel down right where you are and ask his forgiveness for your sins and surrender your life to him can the church same and I love in the same message we have found we have seen a star and come to worship with the Branham after speaking about all of this he begins to switch and the musician can play Softly he said I got a good business I know it's flourishing he's saying that's what somebody might say brother do you know one of these days a heart attack might take you at four in the morning and you have to lead that business then where are you going after that he said when you love to have the wouldn't that be the greatest Christmas present anybody could get the gift of eternal life God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life we have seen a star in the east and have come to worship Him civilization has traveled with the Sun
