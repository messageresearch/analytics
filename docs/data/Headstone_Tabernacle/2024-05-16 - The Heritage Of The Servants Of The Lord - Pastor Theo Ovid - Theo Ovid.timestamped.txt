[33:45] beond
[33:50] the let's pray father we thank you for
[33:53] the night we thank you for your presence
[33:55] Lord are we such a needy people
[33:58] we come looking to the Cross we come
[34:01] connecting to the Cross Lord where our
[34:03] whole dependencies upon you we are
[34:06] yielding ourselves to you tonight that
[34:08] you might have the pinenes take our eyes
[34:10] take our lips take our ears take our
[34:12] hands our feet our heart our Spirits our
[34:15] body our soul may we be a living
[34:17] Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling
[34:19] Place granted father speak to us we need
[34:22] to hear from you granted God in Jesus
[34:25] name we ask it amen amen God bless you
[34:28] and
[34:29] welcome and if you have your Bibles i'
[34:31] like to turn to Matthew chapter 3 we
[34:34] want to read from 13-1 17 and Isaiah 54
[34:39] want to read two verses there verse 15
[34:42] and 17 Reading from Matthew 3 verse 13-1
[34:47] 17 then commed Jesus From Galilee to
[34:49] Jordan unto John to be baptized of him
[34:53] but John forbat him saying I have need
[34:55] to be baptized of Thee Come Thou to me
[34:59] and Jesus answering said unto him suffer
[35:02] to be so now for thus it becometh us to
[35:05] fulfill all righteousness then he
[35:07] suffered him and Jesus when he was
[35:10] baptized went up straightway out of the
[35:12] water and low the heavens were open unto
[35:15] him and he saw the spirit of God
[35:18] descending like a dove and lighten upon
[35:21] him and low a voice from Heaven saying
[35:24] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[35:27] pleased
[35:28] Isaiah 54 reading verse 15 and verse
[35:34] 17 verse 15
[35:37] behold they shall surely gather together
[35:40] but not by
[35:42] me whosoever Shall Gather together
[35:44] against thee shall fall for thy sake
[35:49] verse
[35:50] 17 no weapon that is form against the
[35:53] shall prosper and every tongue that
[35:56] shall rise against the in judgment Thou
[35:59] shalt
[36:00] condemn this is the heritage of the
[36:02] Servants of the Lord and their
[36:05] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[36:08] may God bless his word you may be
[36:15] seated and this
[36:17] scripture
[36:19] um Matthew chapter 3 and the Amplified
[36:23] it says here and Jesus replied to him
[36:26] when he says when John said I should be
[36:29] baptized by you okay and but Jesus
[36:32] replied to him permit it just now for
[36:35] this is he Amplified for this is the
[36:37] fitting way for both of us to fulfill
[36:40] all
[36:42] righteousness that is to perform
[36:46] completely whatever is right then he
[36:49] permitted him so it means that because
[36:52] Jesus was Jesus he didn't take a
[36:55] shortcut he didn't say you know this is
[36:58] above me this is I don't have to do this
[37:00] no Jesus submitted himself to the
[37:03] Fulfillment of the word which is the
[37:05] Fulfillment of righteousness do you see
[37:08] it now so in other words there must be
[37:10] no excuse in fulfilling God's word there
[37:13] must be no excuse in our desire and
[37:15] passion to fulfill what God promising us
[37:17] are amen praise the Lord so tonight I
[37:20] have a title the heritage of the
[37:23] Servants of the Lord very strange but
[37:26] this is what I have to share share with
[37:27] you tonight the heritage of the Servants
[37:30] of the Lord and it's from the scripture
[37:32] No Weapon that is formed against he
[37:34] shall prosper every tongue that shall
[37:36] rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[37:37] condemn this is the heritage of the
[37:41] Servants of the Lord now note it didn't
[37:44] just say
[37:45] servants um you know this is the true
[37:47] servants we talking about now true
[37:49] Servants of the Lord this is the
[37:51] Heritage and their righteousness is of
[37:54] me and that and the Amplified
[37:56] righteousness is to perform completely
[37:59] whatever is right amen isn't that right
[38:01] amen so then this in the Amplified says
[38:03] no weapon that is form against you shall
[38:07] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[38:09] against you in judgment you shall show
[38:12] to be in the wrong this peace
[38:16] righteousness security triumph over
[38:19] opposition is the heritage of the
[38:22] Servants of the Lord those in whom the
[38:27] IDE
[38:28] servant of the Lord is
[38:30] reproduced this is the
[38:33] righteousness or the
[38:35] Vindication which they obtain from me
[38:39] this is that which I impart to them as
[38:44] their
[38:45] justification says the Lord you know we
[38:48] we spoke about uh the the righteousness
[38:51] of faith and that's a very important
[38:53] message you have to listen you have to
[38:56] study it you have to partake of it
[38:58] because this is the eyes of God what God
[39:01] sees so we want to strike something on
[39:04] that fivefold Ministry so that fivefold
[39:06] Ministry is connected to us connected to
[39:09] God's people and you have to see it
[39:11] clearly from God's perspective because
[39:14] they have to be proclaimed in that sense
[39:17] or attributed to be righteous not in
[39:20] their own righteousness but God said
[39:23] here that this is what I impart to them
[39:26] as their just ific ation isn't that
[39:29] right Heritage of the Lord so this
[39:31] fivefold ministry as we know and which
[39:33] we teach here will be the ministry of
[39:36] Jesus Christ it will not be man's
[39:38] Ministry and this fold Ministry have
[39:41] seven parts to fulfill one it will be
[39:44] for the Perfection of the Saints two it
[39:46] will be for the work of the ministry
[39:48] three is for the edifying of the body of
[39:50] Christ four till be all come to Unity of
[39:53] the faith five unto the knowledge of the
[39:55] Son of God six unto a perfect man seven

[49:38] I do shall you do also so many of us try
[49:43] to do the works of Christ before the
[49:46] reflection of Christ is in us there's
[49:48] the trouble we find look at that he's
[49:52] saying get the reflection first and then
[49:55] do the works after people believe a
[49:57] testimony know people have so much of
[49:59] works and afterwards their life rotten
[50:01] as hell Hallelujah you see what I'm
[50:03] talking about now they they near in
[50:05] church but they further from
[50:07] God so many of us try to do the works of
[50:10] Christ before the reflection of Christ
[50:13] is in us there's the trouble we find
[50:15] those things happening you know I know
[50:17] it we see these tumbles along the road
[50:20] we find this crap heap of ministers and
[50:23] they still want to preach
[50:26] but they like iron P you know have um um

[50:58] along the road that why they going
[50:59] collect them on sale is because they
[51:03] didn't get into it right and that is why
[51:06] I'm here this morning try to teach this
[51:08] little church and myself and myself how
[51:11] that we can become the dwelling place of
[51:14] the Living
[51:15] God how many would like that would like

[51:25] debt to the believer we don't care a
[51:27] tent or a cottage why should I care live
[51:29] or die sink or drun this is the thing
[51:31] I'm interested in the kingdom of God
[51:34] whether I maintain my home whether I
[51:37] maintain my family whether I maintain
[51:39] whatever it is let me maintain
[51:42] Christ and then for the ministry he says

[57:42] mechanics are you ready yes the
[57:45] mechanics of the church what is it
[57:48] Apostles prophets teachers so forth and
[57:52] he is the Dynamics that works that and
[57:55] it's the worked by a certain
[57:58] dynamic in other words you can't put a
[58:00] 9vt battery to start this V8
[58:03] engine that could start motorbike engine
[58:05] you could that could start some little
[58:07] toy bicycle but this engine this this
[58:10] thing to charge up and to and to start
[58:12] and to leave this world you need the
[58:14] right battery you can't put a
[58:16] Pentecostal battery inside of there or
[58:18] metodist battery you have to get the
[58:19] Dynamics for this day to start this
[58:22] engine amen amen when you turn the keyo
[58:25] all you seen is light because any
[58:26] battery for it oh give the Lord a shout
[58:29] we can't go with lights Oh Glory to God
[58:31] we can't go with fancy lights and they
[58:33] clicking and taking pictures of how your
[58:34] dashboard lighting up the engine have to
[58:36] start we you see the engine have to
[58:38] Tumble okay the Lord I shou in the
[58:42] house go going to raise up some engine
[58:44] tumblers oh Hallelujah to get this thing
[58:51] moving he is the Dynamics that works
[58:54] that what that the mean
[58:57] of the F Ministry so we have to begin to
[58:59] see the Dynamics working that if that
[59:01] man belong to that isn't that right he
[59:04] is the fire that fire off the gas amen
[59:08] now watch mechanics ain't what run the
[59:11] automobile it's the Dynamics that runs
[59:14] it the mechanics don't run the church so
[59:17] we could we could pray we could preach
[59:19] mystery still tell you write books and
[59:20] Mysteries till they could explain it to
[59:22] everybody the mechanics don't run the
[59:25] church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost
[59:29] that gets into this word so I greatly
[59:32] teacher is teaching his place position
[59:34] place you and they place and they place
[59:36] they place you if Dynamics will come
[59:37] into that they still placing
[59:40] you remember long time in a church I was
[59:42] in man was a foundation every three
[59:44] weeks Foundation I said good Lord when
[59:46] this building will
[59:48] come every time the l a foundation and
[59:50] that Foundation me a three hour
[59:52] service l a foundation and I sitting
[59:54] down as a believer but when he build
[59:56] going up how long how long how long how
[1:00:00] long you L this
[1:00:02] Foundation the mechanics don't run the
[1:00:04] church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost
[1:00:08] that gets into this word it is not a
[1:00:10] seminary that teaches you all the
[1:00:12] Theology and the Greek interpretation
[1:00:14] but it is the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:16] in there to set that a fire to bring it
[1:00:20] to pass and to make it live exactly what
[1:00:23] his promised word for this hour not

[1:00:52] church in line with the word what
[1:00:55] question ask Apostles prophets teachers
[1:01:00] pastors evangelists offers of the church
[1:01:03] I a't seen nowhere where he said that in
[1:01:05] the church to be
[1:01:06] popes to be
[1:01:09] dictators to be man of the
[1:01:11] hour no he have a purpose behind that to
[1:01:15] keep the church in line with the word

[1:01:59] chch line up what is it question gifts
[1:02:03] of the Spirit in the church not a bunch
[1:02:06] of fanaticism but truly gifts of the
[1:02:10] Spirit in the church that's right
[1:02:11] keeping the church if a real church was
[1:02:14] ordained of God really filled with the
[1:02:17] Holy Spirit if sin would appear in the
[1:02:19] church it will be another like anas
[1:02:23] ofall that's the goal that's a template
[1:02:27] that's the early church that's the
[1:02:28] original church and we have to get back
[1:02:30] to that and there's a prophecy we will
[1:02:32] get back to that make no mistake about
[1:02:35] it we will get back to that they will
[1:02:36] know this is not a message church this
[1:02:38] is a Bible Church oh give the Lord a
[1:02:40] shout in the house we going back to the
[1:02:42] book of Acts going back to another
[1:02:44] Pentecost there must have another
[1:02:46] Pentecost before there's a book of
[1:02:49] Acts how can we have a book of Acts and
[1:02:51] talk about acts we going here going
[1:02:53] there going there and there's no
[1:02:54] Pentecost identified it wasn't the acts
[1:02:56] of the men it was Acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:59] working through these men it wasn't the
[1:03:01] acts of men it was Acts of the Holy
[1:03:03] Ghost in Peter in Paul in all these
[1:03:06] brothers It Go be the acts of the Holy
[1:03:07] Ghost in you oh give the Lord some
[1:03:10] Praises Hallelujah glory to God
[1:03:15] Amen Hallelujah you know when Jesus
[1:03:18] preached it wasn't 1% of one million of
[1:03:20] the people on Earth ever heard
[1:03:22] him it's the elected that hears it wow
[1:03:26] and he said no man can come except my
[1:03:28] father draws him first and all that the
[1:03:30] father has given me will come that's
[1:03:31] right now I believe here we go that
[1:03:34] there's a church coming into that
[1:03:38] Perfection that Ministry of perfection
[1:03:42] that's what he call
[1:03:44] itall not just Ministry Hallelujah that
[1:03:48] Ministry of perfection where the offices
[1:03:51] where Pro Apostles prophets teachers
[1:03:55] pastors evangelist for the Perfection of
[1:03:57] the church them pastors and teachers
[1:03:59] will be so with the word until the whole
[1:04:03] thing will work right up to the coming
[1:04:06] of the Lord and I believe we are nearing
[1:04:09] that time
[1:04:10] now men that not deviating from the word
[1:04:13] remember the story probably give about
[1:04:14] two men riding the bike and one man
[1:04:16] riding close to the mountain and the
[1:04:18] other fell making sty at the edge he
[1:04:19] lost the race the other one holding and
[1:04:21] the man going no arm and thing right he
[1:04:23] showing his skills
[1:04:27] they showing the skills they could get
[1:04:28] Revelation that not in the
[1:04:31] message and this one holding two hands
[1:04:34] Old Testament and New Testament he
[1:04:36] holding the handlebars anding close
[1:04:39] close this one by the edge see how fall
[1:04:42] no hand free
[1:04:46] hand when does God set this 54 Ministry
[1:04:51] we know it but see it again so this 5-4
[1:04:54] ministry is destined for the church is
[1:04:56] ordained for the body of Christ this
[1:04:58] this five4 ministry is International
[1:05:00] Ministry it's not just for a local
[1:05:02] church it's for the body of Christ and
[1:05:05] the body of Christ is universal the body
[1:05:07] of Christ is international now he said
[1:05:09] when God has set some of the church
[1:05:11] through their labor
[1:05:13] pains only not through conventions not
[1:05:15] through shaking hands through labor
[1:05:17] pains oh how they get tremendous
[1:05:19] sometime labor pains who said that God
[1:05:22] said that not the Min Association pains
[1:05:24] and argument no labor pains when a
[1:05:26] church is growing under persecution from
[1:05:28] the outside world Believing on the Lord
[1:05:31] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:32] is just as real to us as it was to
[1:05:35] Pentecost not no modern Holy Ghost not
[1:05:38] no you gave by the word and when you
[1:05:40] believe the word you have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] not that they not what they had in their
[1:05:42] Pentecost where the Holy Ghost is just
[1:05:45] as real to us as it was to Pentecost how
[1:05:48] they grown and cry what they gr for the
[1:05:50] same Holy Ghost the same pay the same
[1:05:54] power what Peter had what Paul had what
[1:05:56] Andrew had that is what you want you're
[1:05:58] grow in for that yeah gr to be Message
[1:06:00] Church you're grow for the Bible had in
[1:06:08] it hang a picture of the cloud and hang
[1:06:10] a picture of of brother with the light
[1:06:12] and on message church just hang them two
[1:06:14] pictures put pictures
[1:06:17] here that's
[1:06:19] delber all I have perfect
[1:06:22] man the picture I want you see
[1:06:26] yes that is what the Prophet come to
[1:06:27] introduce he I did not come to build a
[1:06:30] denomination I came to introduce people
[1:06:32] what to the Statue of perfect man that
[1:06:34] they could be a
[1:06:36] Powerhouse that by these virtues by
[1:06:39] these promises you become partakers of
[1:06:42] his divine
[1:06:45] nature not your soup to
[1:06:48] yourself his divine nature that to much
[1:06:51] of religious people in this message they
[1:06:54] think the spirit but the
[1:07:00] religious I know what you're talking
[1:07:02] about you know I just seen that by guess
[1:07:03] you know I have encountered these people
[1:07:05] and met these people already you
[1:07:09] know when a church is grown in under the
[1:07:11] proecu of world believe in the Lord
[1:07:13] Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:15] is just as real to us as it was to
[1:07:17] Pentecost how they grown and cry under
[1:07:18] labor pins but when they are
[1:07:23] born Unos born
[1:07:26] amen into the kingdom of God then the
[1:07:30] Holy Ghost when then when then a man
[1:07:36] claimed to be adopted he's a liar this
[1:07:38] is the word here let him break that
[1:07:41] first when they are born into the
[1:07:43] kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has
[1:07:45] set in the church some Apostles some
[1:07:48] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[1:07:52] evangelists these men are not set by
[1:07:54] votes they are set by the holy ghost in
[1:07:56] the
[1:07:57] church oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:08:00] then he give to there speaking with
[1:08:02] tongues interpretation of tongues
[1:08:03] knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all
[1:08:05] kind of Miracles praise
[1:08:08] God 1 Timothy 519 says against an elder
[1:08:13] receive not an acquisition but before
[1:08:16] two or three
[1:08:17] Witnesses and people loose in the m and
[1:08:19] see all kind of things the Bible have
[1:08:22] safeguards the Bible have guard rails
[1:08:24] for people to told the tongue and the
[1:08:26] mouth this scripture here is based upon
[1:08:29] Deuteronomy 19:15 where the Bible says
[1:08:32] one witness shall not rise up against a
[1:08:35] man for any iniquity or for any sin in
[1:08:40] any sin that he sin it as the mou of two
[1:08:43] witnesses or at the mou of three
[1:08:45] Witnesses shall the matter be
[1:08:48] established and these witness had to be
[1:08:50] tried because it have a bias against it
[1:08:52] they would lie without even blinking
[1:08:54] their eyes
[1:08:57] so be honorable people somebody say I
[1:09:01] see him come the bar with a big
[1:09:05] can like like look like he's drinking
[1:09:08] next minute man come the car drinking
[1:09:10] next minute the man break down the get
[1:09:13] some water to put in the radiator
[1:09:14] because need some a
[1:09:16] leak the whole train see he
[1:09:21] wasn't take a picture not to verify
[1:09:24] anything so two or three Witnesses did
[1:09:26] you see him
[1:09:27] drinking no do you have another witness
[1:09:30] no did did you check the B man if you
[1:09:32] went for
[1:09:35] Booze you see things get loose just like
[1:09:40] that so here what 1 Timothy 5:19 he
[1:09:43] amplifi it listen to No
[1:09:46] acquisition presented before a judge
[1:09:49] against an elder unless it is confirmed
[1:09:54] by the testimony of two or three
[1:09:55] Witnesses what what everybody do that
[1:09:58] anytime you he somebody raise up and see
[1:10:00] them against the pastor against elders
[1:10:01] and whatnot you challenge them and say
[1:10:02] shut your mou hold the peace I don't
[1:10:04] want to hear it hey you know what I hear
[1:10:07] you have two
[1:10:08] witnesses you before you speak you could
[1:10:11] confirm
[1:10:12] that because speaking is seeds in her
[1:10:16] words are seeds in not just the word of
[1:10:18] God is a seed you know people M that be
[1:10:20] are seed you know that's why you don't
[1:10:22] let the wrong person speak into your
[1:10:24] life amen somebody could speak a black
[1:10:27] streak into you know speak negativity

[1:13:34] Hallelujah I said my God I want to leave
[1:13:36] it for Sunday I said Lord Jesus God know
[1:13:38] what's going to come Sunday I just taken
[1:13:40] it one day at the time and this was
[1:13:42] something when I get I said Lord have
[1:13:44] mercy title where do I go with this but
[1:13:49] prayed our heavenly father I want to
[1:13:51] express if I can this morning what my
[1:13:53] heart I feel towards one the holiest of
[1:13:55] holy coming down on Earth to redeem a
[1:13:57] sinner like myself and I'm sure that
[1:13:59] these ministers that's present now can
[1:14:01] feel the same way that it was by your
[1:14:03] grace that we have been made Ministers
[1:14:04] of this Covenant that thou has given
[1:14:06] with Adam's Fallen race and we're here
[1:14:08] this morning Father gathered for no
[1:14:10] other purpose but to know and to study
[1:14:12] to know rather the will of God and what
[1:14:14] we must do to make Christ real to the
[1:14:16] people of this generation not to parade
[1:14:18] our beef and ourselves but what we must
[1:14:21] do to make Christ real to the people of
[1:14:24] this generation knowing surely that in
[1:14:26] the day of judgment we will be brought
[1:14:29] face to face with this generation and
[1:14:31] being ministers we will be
[1:14:33] judges so Church upfront this is the
[1:14:37] position as a
[1:14:40] Heritage of the Servants of the Lord
[1:14:43] that they will be judges whether you see
[1:14:45] me right or you see me K it doesn't
[1:14:47] matter how you see me that is irrelevant
[1:14:49] I'm not concerned how you see me you
[1:14:50] know I'm concerned what God see in me
[1:14:59] being ministers we will be judges and
[1:15:01] the people to which we have spoken to
[1:15:04] and their attitude towards the word that
[1:15:06] we bring them will determine their
[1:15:09] Eternal
[1:15:11] destination this is what God
[1:15:16] Said an as a fire that came to church
[1:15:19] and they thought that brother Peter they
[1:15:20] know who who denied Christ and Peter
[1:15:23] fell and Peter this and Peter that when
[1:15:25] they come lying in church they drop down
[1:15:26] dead because they failed to see the
[1:15:29] pillar of fire Seated on Peter's heart
[1:15:32] they fail to understand that that was a
[1:15:34] different man the outward man was the
[1:15:37] same but the Inside Man was different
[1:15:39] and they were dealing with God in a
[1:15:42] man Hallelujah so Peter didn't say
[1:15:44] you're light to me you know he say
[1:15:46] you're light to the Holy Ghost when Paul
[1:15:50] rebuked the spirit he didn't rebuke the
[1:15:51] woman you know who follow him with man
[1:15:53] of God you know he rebuked the spirit
[1:15:56] he understood it was not the woman
[1:15:58] Hallelujah he understood he was talking
[1:16:00] to a demon so when he rebuked the spirit
[1:16:03] that for fortune telling thing came off
[1:16:06] of her so the gift of fortune telling
[1:16:08] was a spirit behind that person that
[1:16:11] giving them the ability to tell Fortune
[1:16:13] making the man who hire her a fortune so
[1:16:16] when Paul get the spirit off of her all
[1:16:19] the fortune anointing left so them them
[1:16:21] end up
[1:16:23] brokes because they Supply
[1:16:26] get
[1:16:28] cut and that's how they end up holding
[1:16:30] Paul and arresting Paul and these men
[1:16:32] causing trouble in the camp trouble know
[1:16:35] them money running
[1:16:36] short the girl can't do what she
[1:16:38] accustom doing oh give the Lord some PR
[1:16:42] tonight Hallelujah so do you get it now
[1:16:47] this Heritage of the Servants of the
[1:16:49] Lord that God plac them re Sons now re
[1:16:52] servants to be judges listen to this
[1:16:56] we know that Paul had the Holy Spirit do
[1:16:57] you believe that when he was 14 days and
[1:16:59] nights upon the sea without moon stars
[1:17:01] it was all dark and he went down into
[1:17:03] the gallery to pray he came back and
[1:17:05] told the men be of good courage for the
[1:17:08] angel of God whose servant I am came to
[1:17:12] me last night and said fear not Paul is
[1:17:16] that right not the Holy
[1:17:19] Spirit the angel of God an angel of God
[1:17:23] sent from God then he said this here now
[1:17:28] therefore Angelic beings Hallelujah is
[1:17:32] ordained ministers of God to come to the
[1:17:37] Earth to Bear record of God and they
[1:17:41] work through mortal
[1:17:46] being so when we talk about ministering
[1:17:48] Spirit yes God has actually sent
[1:17:52] ministering Spirit to minister to those
[1:17:54] who are is of Salvation Hallelujah God
[1:17:56] has sent a ministering Spirit to
[1:17:58] minister you so it's not just the man
[1:18:01] speaking words it's a ministering Spirit
[1:18:04] Angelic being present to speak to give
[1:18:08] unction to give inspiration to release
[1:18:11] the
[1:18:13] anointing because of who you are it's
[1:18:16] not about the man it's about you it's
[1:18:18] for the Perfection of the Saints for the
[1:18:20] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:18:23] the body oh give the Lord some
[1:18:26] Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:29] glory to
[1:18:32] God see where we
[1:18:39] at many times people would ask me why
[1:18:42] would a man like Jesus have to be
[1:18:44] baptized why would this person be
[1:18:46] baptized as an act of repentance and
[1:18:48] confession when he was holy spotless
[1:18:50] unadulterated son of the Living God why
[1:18:52] would this person have to be baptized
[1:18:54] baptism is after confession he had no
[1:18:57] confession to make because he was God
[1:19:00] why would he have to be baptized like
[1:19:01] that unto repentance because he needed
[1:19:03] no repentance he was infallible God he
[1:19:06] was in the world the world was made by
[1:19:07] him the world knew him not why would he
[1:19:09] have to be baptized and he said before
[1:19:12] that he said thus it Beth us to fulfill
[1:19:15] all
[1:19:16] righteousness in other words it must be
[1:19:18] fulfilled all the word of God spoken
[1:19:21] must be fulfill God never speaks until
[1:19:24] it's ready for it to be and when he
[1:19:26] speaks it's just as well as already

[1:28:43] fruit may be seated David did not the
[1:28:47] training Saul had but he know a God that
[1:28:50] Saul knew nothing about so Saul's
[1:28:53] position didn't give him access to God
[1:28:55] David knew God and he was even qualified
[1:28:57] to be in the Army this young man he said
[1:29:00] I will go and fight him why he could
[1:29:03] have took one finger and wrapped it
[1:29:04] around his waist but he had courage for
[1:29:06] guess what he knew he was right and when
[1:29:09] a man knows you're right nothing can
[1:29:10] move you listen to this a man don't look
[1:29:14] like Moses did this way and that way a
[1:29:16] true servant of God never has to look
[1:29:20] this way or that way he don't care the
[1:29:23] thr of the enemy or the pleasing applaud
[1:29:26] of some man he enjoys the Fellowship of
[1:29:28] the Lord God who sent him if he knows
[1:29:31] where he is standing he don't care
[1:29:32] whether his enemies like it or whether
[1:29:34] his friends smile on him that doesn't
[1:29:36] make a bit of difference to a true
[1:29:38] servant of Christ he's got a job to do
[1:29:40] and you don't have to look and see what
[1:29:42] do you think about it is this pleasing
[1:29:45] to you that's a true servant of God are
[1:29:47] you
[1:29:49] ready Jesus said he that receives them
[1:29:52] that I send receives me amen now them
[1:29:55] that he sent and them that receives me
[1:29:58] receive him that sent me he says I wish
[1:30:01] we could have time to linger on that and
[1:30:03] then he make this statement you can only
[1:30:06] serve God as you do and believe the
[1:30:10] servants that God

[1:30:45] judgments of his mouth oh you Seed of
[1:30:47] Abraham his servant each CH of Jacob his
[1:30:49] chosen he is the Lord Our God his
[1:30:51] judgments are in all the Earth he had
[1:30:52] remembered his Covenant forever the word
[1:30:54] which he commanded to a thousand
[1:30:55] Generations which Covenant he made with
[1:30:57] Abraham his oath unto Isaac and
[1:30:58] confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law
[1:31:01] and to Israel for an Everlasting
[1:31:02] Covenant saying unto thee will I give
[1:31:04] the land of Canaan the lot for
[1:31:06] inheritance when there were but few men
[1:31:08] in number yeah very few and strangers in
[1:31:10] it when they went from one nation to
[1:31:12] another one Kingdom to another people he
[1:31:14] suffered no man to do them wrong he
[1:31:16] reproved Kings for their sake saying
[1:31:18] touch not my anointed and do my prophets
[1:31:21] no harm Oh Glory you we come back to all
[1:31:24] of that yes we come back to all of that
[1:31:26] God's anointed will be upon the Earth
[1:31:29] isn't that
[1:31:30] right eastes 12 said fear God keep his
[1:31:33] commandment for this is the full duty of
[1:31:34] man the conclusion of the whole matter
[1:31:37] is to fear God and you cannot have
[1:31:39] respects until you have fear you got to
[1:31:41] have the fear of God Solomon said the
[1:31:44] fear of the god is the beginning of
[1:31:45] wisdom that don't mean you're afraid of
[1:31:47] him but it means that you're given
[1:31:48] respects and reverence and when you
[1:31:50] respect God you fear God you fear that
[1:31:53] he would disle him in some way you fear
[1:31:55] at least you would do something wrong I
[1:31:57] fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my
[1:31:59] church I fear all of God's servants
[1:32:01] unless I should put a stumbling block
[1:32:03] somewhere in the way I fear the people I
[1:32:05] fear the people of the city unless I
[1:32:06] will do something wrong I would cause
[1:32:08] them to think that I wasn't a Christian
[1:32:11] before you can have a respect you've got
[1:32:13] to have fear and God demands it he
[1:32:15] demands respect God does he demands it
[1:32:18] and fear brings it let a man farmer shop
[1:32:21] worker and nobody pay attention to him
[1:32:23] let him a job as a police officer police
[1:32:26] force come down the street he has badge
[1:32:28] and uniform on watch hello there John
[1:32:30] how are you see is is a kind of awe a
[1:32:33] fear a respect because maybe he get
[1:32:35] elected to the mayor of the city who
[1:32:37] would President Kennedy be tonight if he
[1:32:38] wasn't President Kennedy but being he's
[1:32:40] the president of the United States he
[1:32:42] deserves respect you see and because God
[1:32:44] is God he deserves respect that's right
[1:32:47] you got to respect him and give fear to
[1:32:49] him and that brings respect God has
[1:32:52] demanded that for himself and for all of
[1:32:55] his servants God demands respect for his
[1:32:59] servants his servants here we go how we
[1:33:02] know that they are his servants because
[1:33:06] he vindicates these servants by his word
[1:33:08] he takes these servants and make them
[1:33:11] Servants of God and proves that they are
[1:33:13] servants note I like that word servant
[1:33:15] as opposed to minister you see anybody
[1:33:16] can Minister anybody could go could be
[1:33:19] pulpit and pontificate but to serve is
[1:33:22] different
[1:33:24] hallelujah praise God you can't be a
[1:33:25] message Pope and be a servant you need a
[1:33:27] throne for that and a crown on your
[1:33:31] head and and some of them I'm not trying
[1:33:33] to take off the crown of their head I to
[1:33:35] fix
[1:33:36] it but that is what they enjoy they
[1:33:38] enjoy this crown on their head I'm not
[1:33:40] trying and my call is not to get crowns
[1:33:41] over people head I leaving them with a
[1:33:43] crown on the head he said what watch he
[1:33:46] takes these servants and make them
[1:33:47] Servants of God and proves that they are
[1:33:49] servants by making his word work through
[1:33:52] them servants
[1:33:54] he make his word work through them
[1:33:56] servants then as you respect that
[1:33:59] servant you respect God so when I
[1:34:03] respect you and you respect me and we
[1:34:05] respect each other then respecting God
[1:34:08] hallelujah so somebody I'm coming
[1:34:10] somebody say you're coming some say so
[1:34:16] what so
[1:34:18] what so
[1:34:20] Noah he preached B AR God brought
[1:34:23] judgment upon the them suffers because
[1:34:25] they would not listen to the message of
[1:34:26] God come under the Ark of his preaching
[1:34:29] they wouldn't take God's preparation of
[1:34:31] Escape watch these words and there's
[1:34:33] only one thing left Divine judgment you
[1:34:35] can only do two things either Mercy or
[1:34:37] judgment you have to accept one or the
[1:34:39] other and there's where we stand tonight
[1:34:41] we takes God's mercy or we stand his
[1:34:43] judgment there's no way getting around
[1:34:45] it God always makes a way of Escape for
[1:34:48] those who desire to escape what's left
[1:34:50] over is to stand the judgment
[1:34:54] if you can't respect a man respect the
[1:34:57] office he holds in
[1:35:00] God respect him if a minister comes up
[1:35:04] your pastor always respect him not
[1:35:07] sometimes always respect him I've heard
[1:35:11] congregations talk about their Pastor
[1:35:13] just just talk about him run him down
[1:35:15] ridicule him how is that Pastor ever
[1:35:17] going to do anything for you he can't do
[1:35:20] it I don't say this church but I mean
[1:35:22] churches have seen it you've got to love
[1:35:24] your pastor you've got to know he's a
[1:35:25] human being but yet God made him his
[1:35:28] past his Pastor the Holy Ghost has made
[1:35:30] him overseer then you've got to respect
[1:35:32] him in that manner and no matter what
[1:35:34] the pastor done if you respect him in
[1:35:36] your heart as God's servant God will
[1:35:38] respect you for doing it so that's why

[1:36:34] we see Jesus and what did Christ do he
[1:36:36] point them to the Cross that's why I
[1:36:38] suang that song in the cross Christ will
[1:36:42] bring you to the Cross where you are
[1:36:44] crucified with him and his eternal life
[1:36:46] and your life meet together and your
[1:36:49] life dies and you take on his eternal
[1:36:52] life where
[1:36:54] at the cross so at the cross is where
[1:36:56] you meet with him your life dies and you
[1:36:59] take on his eternal life oh my his
[1:37:01] eternal life and your life meets
[1:37:02] together your life dies you take on his
[1:37:05] eternal life and then you are Son of God
[1:37:09] my he said what a difference from the
[1:37:12] disciple of old and disciple of today if
[1:37:14] you mentioned the disciple I would love
[1:37:16] to know the Lord Jesus well now look we
[1:37:18] belong to certain Church come down and
[1:37:20] join us see that's what you hear but
[1:37:22] Christ himself self pointed the people
[1:37:24] to his debt and said except a corner
[1:37:26] weat falls in the Dr and die it abides
[1:37:29] alone but your life and his life find
[1:37:31] each other not at the church not in a
[1:37:34] building not in a Creed not in good
[1:37:37] works but in the cross where you are
[1:37:39] crucify with him that is where you find
[1:37:41] Christ you don't find him by doing
[1:37:42] better you don't find him by turning a
[1:37:44] new page you don't find him by starting
[1:37:46] a new life you don't find Christ you
[1:37:48] find Christ only in debt not in a Manger
[1:37:50] not in a confession to believe in
[1:37:53] certain in Creeds I believe Thunders I
[1:37:56] believe new name I believe patrio 4 I
[1:37:58] believe what you can believe whatever
[1:37:59] you want to believe you're not finding
[1:38:00] Christ in Creeds you don't find Christ
[1:38:02] there a true servant takes it to him and
[1:38:05] he is the word and if Christ is there
[1:38:08] today a real servant would take you to
[1:38:10] him Christ and Christ is here in the
[1:38:11] form of the word and the word brings
[1:38:13] life because he's the word Christ is the
[1:38:15] word and he's the word himself a true
[1:38:17] servant always takes you to the word all
[1:38:19] right we're almost done Romans 1013 to1
[1:38:22] 17 say for whosoever shall call upon the
[1:38:24] name of the Lord shall be saved but then
[1:38:26] how shall they call on whom they have
[1:38:29] not believed how shall they believe in
[1:38:31] him of whom they have not heard how
[1:38:33] shall they hear without a preacher how
[1:38:36] shall they preach except he be sent as
[1:38:38] it is written how beautiful at the feet
[1:38:40] of them that preach the gospel of peace
[1:38:42] and bring Glad Tidings of good things
[1:38:44] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[1:38:46] for Isaiah said Lord who ha relieve our
[1:38:49] report so then Faith come by hearing and
[1:38:51] hearing by the word of God so the
[1:38:54] branches is the one that bear fruit not
[1:38:56] the vine so we the church is left as
[1:38:58] branches so your eyes and my eyes here
[1:39:02] we go is the only eyes that God has on
[1:39:03] the earth that's big your lips and my
[1:39:08] lips is his branch and he energizes it
[1:39:11] to bring forth fruit and our ears is his
[1:39:14] ears our hands to do good is his hands
[1:39:17] our feet are his feet to carry us to
[1:39:19] church and to do good blessed are the
[1:39:22] feet that bring be in good tidings we as
[1:39:25] as his Vine he pours his energy into us
[1:39:28] now there are five gifts that set in the
[1:39:29] church Apostles prophets teachers
[1:39:31] evangelist that's the branches that God
[1:39:33] poures energy into that some of them to
[1:39:35] preach some of them to evangelize some
[1:39:37] of them to Pastor teach and here Apostle
[1:39:39] missionary and so forth isn't that right
[1:39:41] almost done page 12 almost done we head
[1:39:43] to
[1:39:45] 14 you
[1:39:47] ready Paul said all men left me every
[1:39:51] one of them left him I say this
[1:39:54] when a man stands true to the word not
[1:39:57] just in one meeting but in every meeting
[1:40:00] when a man stands true to the word the
[1:40:02] time will come when they will leave him
[1:40:05] they did it to our Lord they will leave
[1:40:08] him when he stands for truth all men has
[1:40:11] forsaken me what do you think that Deus
[1:40:13] and some of them thought when we all
[1:40:14] know the scripture Luke was a doctor
[1:40:16] Paul whenever he went took this doctor
[1:40:18] with him preaching Divine Healing and
[1:40:20] leaving his friend sick so poor he had
[1:40:22] one quat let a man man running out of
[1:40:24] tongue he could Smite the man blind and
[1:40:26] they thought he was washed up but he
[1:40:27] wasn't he was exactly in the bloody
[1:40:30] Footprints he said old man has forsaken
[1:40:33] me how I think of that how a servant
[1:40:35] that to stand true to the word sooner or
[1:40:37] later just remember people are going to
[1:40:39] forsake Him always when God's servant
[1:40:41] stands true to the word all forsake Him
[1:40:44] when a man stay true no matter how
[1:40:46] popular he is when he said true to the
[1:40:48] word the time come when the religious
[1:40:50] World forsaken him and cut him off every
[1:40:52] man every saint every Prophet every true
[1:40:55] servant of God that stayed with the word
[1:40:57] was forsaken by the ecclesiastical thing
[1:41:00] and cast down and Paul was one of them
[1:41:03] almost done musician it is usually at
[1:41:06] such a time as this when men have stayed
[1:41:10] true to the word and all men have
[1:41:12] forsaken him until God steps in his
[1:41:14] defense of that person and crowns his
[1:41:18] ministry what a consolation our
[1:41:21] consolation is built in the promis of
[1:41:23] God's word how many Christians are in
[1:41:27] the way tonight in here that are happy
[1:41:29] that you started a long time ago you
[1:41:32] done made your start way down along the
[1:41:34] road still coming down towards the end I
[1:41:37] pray that God will Crown your ministry
[1:41:41] whatever it is it may be a housewife I
[1:41:44] pray that grown will Crown your ministry
[1:41:46] it may be a preacher it may be a deacon
[1:41:48] it may be a lay member it may be a
[1:41:50] farmer I don't know what it is whatever
[1:41:51] it is may God Crown Your Life with the
[1:41:54] glory of his word and a second coming
