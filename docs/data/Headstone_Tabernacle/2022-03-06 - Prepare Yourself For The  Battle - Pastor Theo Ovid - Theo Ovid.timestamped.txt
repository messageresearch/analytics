[41:28] pipe or heart
[41:29] except to give a distinction in the
[41:31] songs how shall it be known what is
[41:33] fight or heart
[41:35] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[41:37] song
[41:38] who shall prepare himself to the battle
[41:41] and first thessalonians chapter 4 read
[41:43] in verse 13 but i would not have you to
[41:45] be ignorant brethren considering them
[41:47] which are asleep that you sorrow not
[41:49] even as others which have no hope
[41:51] for if we believe that jesus died and
[41:53] rose again even so them also which sleep
[41:55] in jesus will god bring with him
[41:57] for this we say unto you by the word of
[41:59] the lord that we which alive remain unto
[42:01] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[42:03] them which are asleep for the lord
[42:05] himself
[42:06] shall deserve from heaven with a shout
[42:08] and the voice of the archangel with the
[42:10] trump of god the dead and crying shall
[42:12] rise first then we which are alive very
[42:14] mean shall be caught up together with
[42:16] them in the clouds to meet the lord in
[42:17] the ear and so shall we ever be with the
[42:19] lord and wherefore comfort one another
[42:21] with these words may god bless his word
[42:23] you may be seated
[42:24] good morning and god bless you and
[42:26] welcome
[42:27] so glad to have all of you out this

[42:36] praise be to jesus
[42:38] so tonight this morning have a title
[42:41] prepare yourself for the battle
[42:44] prepare yourself for the battle
[42:47] you know as we it keeps his song
[42:49] repetitive
[42:51] but just about week or two weeks ago
[42:53] these people in ukraine they were living
[42:54] normal lives
[42:56] going to the bank using the bank cards
[42:58] go into home teach pick up the children
[43:00] push the prom normal living all of a
[43:02] sudden the bombs are flying the homes
[43:05] are no longer there russians in the
[43:07] street all of a sudden wasn't the time
[43:09] of peace for them is changed the time of
[43:10] war
[43:11] and we come to exhort you today prepare
[43:14] for the battle
[43:16] brother brown
[43:19] so you know this morning you'll get the
[43:20] word right
[43:22] i'll not come here to tell you what i
[43:23] feel what i think
[43:25] you're coming to get the word right
[43:27] so we're on the word this morning
[43:29] tension speaking of tension i was
[43:31] praying about it this morning what would
[43:32] you do if you didn't have tension
[43:35] just think of it
[43:36] tension
[43:37] is part of living
[43:39] that kind of encouraged me when i
[43:41] thought that if you had no tension you'd
[43:42] be like a rag doll
[43:44] you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be
[43:46] nothing you could work on like a husband
[43:48] and wife maybe if you want to do
[43:49] something they're trying to work
[43:51] together especially christians and the
[43:53] other one once and then you come
[43:55] together and you find out what she's
[43:56] done she finds out the tension really
[43:58] brings you closer together
[44:00] and somebody tells you well just think
[44:02] of a little wife that went under a lot
[44:03] of tension when he wasn't so good or the
[44:06] husband went under some tension when he
[44:08] wasn't so good then it's all forgiven
[44:10] how you feel about him my you you've got
[44:12] to have tension that's all
[44:14] and some people try to introduce
[44:16] christianity that you're free from worry
[44:18] you are not
[44:19] you're free from tension no no you have
[44:21] tension when you become a christian
[44:25] ten percent human
[44:27] you add tension is your word
[44:30] and if it's the word you just say amen
[44:31] because it's truth
[44:33] so you're not looking for easy way of
[44:35] our past or as is you
[44:37] god has not as is you
[44:39] because he could have given adam a
[44:40] person a gardener eden

[44:44] you know you eat or you eat or putting
[44:46] a fat a nice child
[44:48] no he told them the day you eat that did
[44:50] you die
[44:51] and if he's god he has to keep his word
[44:53] is that a matter of love and love is a
[44:55] matter of my word
[44:58] so we're not here for love in that sense
[45:00] and you know like and love no we here to
[45:02] get the word
[45:03] the word is god love to us
[45:05] god so loved us he sent his word
[45:08] that will be delivered that will be free
[45:10] that we'll get a breakthrough

[1:02:12] attention at ease a bugle to match so
[1:02:14] that the so they trained the soldiers to
[1:02:17] the song
[1:02:18] song to attack song to retreat so if you
[1:02:21] don't know the difference between attack
[1:02:22] and retreat if you're going forward and
[1:02:23] the beauty booklet to retreat you attack
[1:02:25] and you'll get killed
[1:02:27] because then you move forward and you're

[1:02:46] killed i want you to listen carefully if
[1:02:49] you don't know the song
[1:02:51] you could get killed it has to be a
[1:02:53] certain song
[1:02:55] you can't hear a song and you're not
[1:02:56] yeah sure of course i wonder if the
[1:02:58] music
[1:03:00] are confused
[1:03:06] [Applause]
[1:03:08] when the besieged titus besieged the
[1:03:10] walls of jerusalem compassed about with
[1:03:12] armies all those trained soldiers
[1:03:15] them disciples
[1:03:16] jesus was sitting on the mount that day
[1:03:20] jesus told him this when you see
[1:03:22] jerusalem
[1:03:23] come pastor bought with armies let him
[1:03:26] that's in the field don't return to his
[1:03:28] house
[1:03:31] to get his coat let him in the house do
[1:03:33] not go on the whole stop to come down
[1:03:34] but flee to the mountains
[1:03:37] because there was gonna be a time of
[1:03:38] trouble
[1:03:39] jesus spoke these words
[1:03:41] and when titus around them how they
[1:03:43] could move but jesus when you see them
[1:03:45] move and surrounded jerusalem
[1:03:48] but then something happened back there
[1:03:49] that had to pull titus back
[1:03:51] and when titus pulled back the true
[1:03:53] christians the true people that was
[1:03:55] hearing the certain song they run out
[1:03:57] and get to the mountains
[1:04:00] then titans come back
[1:04:02] and they eat one other children they
[1:04:03] starve them out and they died and perish
[1:04:06] in jerusalem
[1:04:08] all those escaped ones is who listened
[1:04:10] to the certain song and god sent a
[1:04:13] messenger with a message that we will
[1:04:15] not be confused that we have a certain
[1:04:18] song seven thunders gave fate because
[1:04:20] the prophet said it seven times gathered
[1:04:22] right together because the prophet said
[1:04:23] it they don't want to preach it but he
[1:04:25] still said it oh give the lord a shout
[1:04:28] and we still pump in it we are changing
[1:04:30] it
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:34] glory of god seven thunders is that a
[1:04:36] new york revelation
[1:04:38] seven thousand christ himself he came
[1:04:40] down from heaven to lord himself and
[1:04:43] open his mouth and seven thunders after
[1:04:46] their voices
[1:04:47] okay the lord i shall
[1:04:49] this is not a new york revelation
[1:04:58] this is not a revelation from new york
[1:05:00] sorry
[1:05:02] new york does not own this sorry
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:12] those who have been trained to the voice
[1:05:13] of jesus
[1:05:15] they took
[1:05:16] for the mountains as hard as they could
[1:05:18] and the only ones that suffered to
[1:05:20] survive it
[1:05:22] those unprepared
[1:05:24] don't know the song
[1:05:27] when the song of the coming of the lord
[1:05:28] blast
[1:05:30] oh hallelujah
[1:05:32] why did the bible get the parable about
[1:05:33] those wicked servants that would say the
[1:05:35] lord delay is coming
[1:05:36] the lord delays coming so you can fight
[1:05:38] one another
[1:05:39] true revelation show you first
[1:05:40] thessalonians 4
[1:05:42] the lord has already descended
[1:05:45] oh and in the settlement he does three
[1:05:47] things
[1:05:48] a shout
[1:05:49] a voice
[1:05:50] and a trump
[1:05:52] the shout is the living bread that's
[1:05:54] what you hear every sunday morning and
[1:05:56] not my message the prophet's message the
[1:05:58] seventh angel message is the living
[1:06:00] bread that's on books and tapes
[1:06:01] and we glean from that and bring present
[1:06:05] or as well spiritual food
[1:06:07] in due season
[1:06:08] not every tape is to play now and have
[1:06:11] food in it and as a pastor i have to
[1:06:13] find that food
[1:06:14] and mix it just right put it on the
[1:06:17] plate and save it
[1:06:19] oh glory to god become
[1:06:21] oh i am a servant this morning i have it
[1:06:23] on top of here
[1:06:27] oh glory to god hallelujah we come to
[1:06:30] bring your full course menu we are
[1:06:32] coming to bring you soup this morning
[1:06:34] super just part of that thing becoming
[1:06:36] on your full coast menu oh give the lord
[1:06:38] a shout he said my people shall eat
[1:06:42] and be satisfied
[1:06:44] and praise the name of the lord your god
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:07:07] the church has united itself against the
[1:07:09] message
[1:07:11] and when it does that
[1:07:13] the nations are uniting themselves in
[1:07:14] communism to destroy the church
[1:07:16] no communism is not a movement
[1:07:19] communism is a spirit
[1:07:21] you should infiltrate in america
[1:07:24] oh we think about that now not communism
[1:07:26] as a you know them as communists no a
[1:07:28] spirit
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:31] nations
[1:07:32] are uniting themselves in communism to
[1:07:34] destroy the church
[1:07:36] listen let's pause just quote me a
[1:07:37] little bit
[1:07:38] israel had to turn down the message
[1:07:40] first
[1:07:41] and when they turn down the message then
[1:07:44] the military
[1:07:47] the national life united itself together
[1:07:49] and come in and destroy the church
[1:07:52] and that's why i keep saying it's enough
[1:07:54] press come down no pressure coming down
[1:07:55] nothing
[1:07:58] because the bride has to become joseph
[1:08:02] the rejected
[1:08:04] which is christ being manifested in you
[1:08:06] that's joseph
[1:08:10] and when the brethren
[1:08:12] reject the bride
[1:08:15] then it gives the the surrounding
[1:08:18] military and political and phys and
[1:08:20] spiritual force the opportunity to
[1:08:21] destroy the church or attempt to try
[1:08:24] destroy the by elect
[1:08:26] so there's a movement to take place
[1:08:30] the battle is about to start against
[1:08:31] church members
[1:08:32] against false anointed against
[1:08:34] hypocrites the battle no but we're not
[1:08:36] going to get started we're not coming
[1:08:37] outside you know we're not going
[1:08:38] something inside
[1:08:40] oh god boy go in a big walkway and break
[1:08:42] out now you know
[1:08:43] glory to god in the trumpet given
[1:08:46] uncertain song who can prepare himself
[1:08:48] for the battle but you are going to be
[1:08:49] prepared the brightest will we made
[1:08:51] ready what the bible said his wife had
[1:08:53] made herself ready she going to make us
[1:08:56] ready for the battle that is ahead
[1:08:58] oh give the lord i shall shake yourself
[1:09:01] glory to god shake yourself shake
[1:09:03] yourself this morning don't think you're
[1:09:05] in anything yet it's about to get
[1:09:07] started
[1:09:07] [Applause]
[1:09:12] coronavirus or jesus san peron you know
[1:09:14] you still buying the world for two years
[1:09:16] you see are we every nation at the bow
[1:09:18] and then delete laws and regulations and
[1:09:20] instructions and so on it have more
[1:09:22] instructions coming in there's a test
[1:09:24] run you know the devil behind the whole
[1:09:26] thing you know god allowed it but what
[1:09:28] i'll say they're gonna use it
[1:09:29] oh let's continue
[1:09:32] glory to god
[1:09:34] and now the time has come
[1:09:37] to where communism is uniting the world
[1:09:39] together against the church
[1:09:43] why because the world will unite against
[1:09:45] communism
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:54] president putin never expected the west
[1:09:57] to respond like that
[1:09:59] his action
[1:10:00] brought a unity among the euro the
[1:10:02] europeans and the west like never before
[1:10:05] because all them are the issues you know
[1:10:06] they said that demons and them jumping
[1:10:08] up there don't forget
[1:10:13] but putin russia is a bigger kind of
[1:10:15] spirit
[1:10:16] that them spirits have to fight up with
[1:10:18] is war it's war
[1:10:21] remember satan say holy kingdom the mind
[1:10:23] and hear lie
[1:10:25] that is one time you tell the truth
[1:10:28] all this in my mind i have power to give
[1:10:30] it to whomever i want if you're bored
[1:10:31] and i'll give you one
[1:10:33] again russia plus again
[1:10:35] just to keep all if you want i come back

[1:10:41] i come around kick you out
[1:10:43] oh blessed being of the lord so watch
[1:10:47] he said we see
[1:10:48] the united time
[1:10:50] thank you return to this message when
[1:10:52] you see these things be united
[1:10:53] why we feel to see these things you look
[1:10:56] in here in the scriptures and see
[1:10:57] where he promised what he would do and
[1:11:00] now we see it coming to pass
[1:11:02] we see
[1:11:03] nations uniting we see isn't united
[1:11:06] together we see the churches united
[1:11:07] together it's united in time it's the
[1:11:09] hour of uniting it's the spirit of the
[1:11:11] age we have got to unite everything you
[1:11:13] talk about has to be organized he said
[1:11:15] it's a united time and it's going to go
[1:11:18] through to some kind of union of some
[1:11:19] sort and that union praised god is the
[1:11:22] very team that will bring on the mark of
[1:11:24] the beast
[1:11:25] it's a united time and it's working
[1:11:27] right up into that now watch this he
[1:11:30] said the jews
[1:11:32] united himself against jesus as their
[1:11:34] messiah therefore we see what happened
[1:11:37] we see the same thing no
[1:11:39] communism uniting to destroy the church
[1:11:43] after the church has united in the
[1:11:44] workings of churches and trying to
[1:11:46] destroy the message the word of god
[1:11:48] they're trying to get rid of it praise
[1:11:50] the name united how
[1:11:52] praise god united together now trying to
[1:11:55] destroy the message
[1:11:57] how do they destroy it how could they
[1:11:59] destroy the word of god they make it of
[1:12:01] non-effect
[1:12:02] non-effective by taking tradition as did
[1:12:05] back there and making the word of god of
[1:12:06] no effect he said how shall we know the
[1:12:08] voice of god in the last days it will be
[1:12:10] a manifestation of the prophet's word
[1:12:12] the prophet's word only bring back that
[1:12:13] real supernatural gospel oh praise god
[1:12:16] you have to want that if i train you and
[1:12:18] sit now i'm hearing you're bringing
[1:12:19] notepad in here right down whole day
[1:12:20] praise god but if i want to bring you on
[1:12:22] the expectation for the manifestation
[1:12:24] then we preaching the promises of what
[1:12:25] god promised
[1:12:26] oh glory to god and god had promised no
[1:12:28] educated intellectual certain dead
[1:12:30] church god promised a church on fire for
[1:12:32] him a church anointed on commission a
[1:12:35] church that cast no devil's healing is
[1:12:36] sick praise god praise god listen to
[1:12:39] this oh glory to god oh harlow help me
[1:12:41] jesus you may be seated forget it i
[1:12:43] forgive me i get excited by myself
[1:12:46] see what's happening something
[1:12:48] when jesus come on the scene nobody
[1:12:50] never saw devil castle
[1:12:52] [Music]
[1:12:56] they only know what priesthood tall hats
[1:12:58] nice guns custom made them
[1:13:00] custom-made costumes
[1:13:02] and everybody re speaking as priests
[1:13:05] so when jesus cast of the dumb and
[1:13:07] whatnot
[1:13:08] what that was witnessing satan
[1:13:10] your kingdom is being exposed
[1:13:13] because people didn't understand dumb
[1:13:15] spirit and death spirit and blind spirit
[1:13:17] and evil spirit these were spirits in
[1:13:19] people's lives
[1:13:21] covered up
[1:13:22] you're seeing flesh over them but
[1:13:24] there's demons behind them
[1:13:26] so once the power come and begin to
[1:13:28] flick with the finger of god
[1:13:30] flick flickle devils and flick away
[1:13:32] sicknesses and flickable disease
[1:13:35] is that you are identifying that there's
[1:13:37] a higher power
[1:13:38] that is dealing with the power of
[1:13:39] darkness there's a higher power that is
[1:13:42] dealing with satanic influences and it
[1:13:44] is here it is present
[1:13:47] it is with us
[1:13:49] that is what discernment does
[1:13:51] the word deserving the thoughts and
[1:13:52] intents of the heart
[1:13:53] shows there's a higher power
[1:13:55] that going between the bone and the
[1:13:57] marrow and can tell you what's in your
[1:13:59] heart or give the lord a shout
[1:14:02] so satan didn't want to be exposed
[1:14:05] and in this message you don't want to be
[1:14:06] exposed but by the eclipse he will be
[1:14:09] exposed
[1:14:10] oh glory to god he will be exposed
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:21] but
[1:14:23] we're in a process of national
[1:14:24] disturbance
[1:14:25] we see nations are breaking relationship
[1:14:27] year by year we find this nation being
[1:14:29] swallowed up in communism this one being
[1:14:30] swapping communism and right here in our
[1:14:32] own nation is honeycomb with communism
[1:14:35] and it will take over
[1:14:37] he said watch
[1:14:39] they're united you say brother branham
[1:14:41] is that true they are coming to the
[1:14:43] battle of armageddon exactly what they
[1:14:45] will do
[1:14:46] they are uniting right now that's why we
[1:14:48] got the u.n and everything we have
[1:14:50] the western world united against the
[1:14:52] eastern world communist and so forth
[1:14:54] united together they chase the line
[1:14:56] together this is what happened right now
[1:14:58] because of russia behavior it forced
[1:14:59] people who was not together
[1:15:01] together
[1:15:02] to come together and they wouldn't stop
[1:15:04] there
[1:15:05] they come in first
[1:15:07] so quiet they're coming now you're not
[1:15:10] seeing it no in that trillion cent but
[1:15:12] that is what's going to happen
[1:15:14] oh glory to god because we are more
[1:15:15] bombs than putin you know
[1:15:17] oh glory they've got our weapons of
[1:15:18] warfare yeah we have more powerful bombs

[1:22:58] so god is ensuring that this bright move
[1:23:01] doesn't belong to any particular
[1:23:03] the nomination of the spree because here
[1:23:06] we go are you ready
[1:23:08] remember last service talk about the
[1:23:09] seal of god i miss all this judgment
[1:23:12] the issue here is the seal
[1:23:14] if you've got to receive the mark
[1:23:16] listen to why god sends seven days from
[1:23:18] eternity and we have this cloud that we
[1:23:20] witness
[1:23:21] he said watch because it's time for you
[1:23:24] the 19 of men and women
[1:23:26] of every race
[1:23:27] every color
[1:23:29] every creed
[1:23:30] everything
[1:23:31] under christ
[1:23:33] by the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:23:35] and back to the word
[1:23:37] not united on the press play
[1:23:39] no this is the word here now
[1:23:41] oh glory to god that pressed praise
[1:23:43] man's interpretation of men's idea
[1:23:45] this is the word here this is the time
[1:23:47] to unite every man
[1:23:49] every woman
[1:23:50] every race every creed under christ by
[1:23:53] what by the same baptism of the holy
[1:23:55] ghost and back to the word but guess
[1:23:57] what the baptism of the holy ghost has
[1:23:59] been rejected
[1:24:00] and that is the stone
[1:24:02] that the bill is refused
[1:24:04] oh give it lord
[1:24:06] i shall the praise
[1:24:07] and the cornerstone has become the
[1:24:10] headstone
[1:24:11] and the head shall not be rejected in
[1:24:13] the early church it was the cornerstone
[1:24:15] and the end time church is the capstone
[1:24:18] it's the same stone christ is the stone
[1:24:21] and he has been rejected
[1:24:23] oh glory to god you see mankind produced
[1:24:25] that because that is supernatural okay
[1:24:27] the lord has shouted in the house we
[1:24:30] could read and preach and talk and
[1:24:31] explain and reveal and all them stuff
[1:24:33] but this part is god himself
[1:24:36] giving you fire
[1:24:38] pulling inside your heart why we can't
[1:24:40] preach that why we can't talk about that
[1:24:43] why you don't want that it will take and
[1:24:45] burn the lasso to you it will bring the
[1:24:47] cravings out to you it will bring the
[1:24:49] evil out to you
[1:24:51] oh don't you want that
[1:24:53] don't you want them sarah so come down
[1:24:56] the burners and burn
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:03] never before
[1:25:05] since the early church age
[1:25:07] did we see the things that we are seeing
[1:25:09] today
[1:25:10] and this was only made possible
[1:25:12] when god send the seven seals
[1:25:15] and give us a sign by it
[1:25:17] and send seven angels don't go to heaven
[1:25:20] and come to bring back that scattered
[1:25:22] word
[1:25:22] in them denomination
[1:25:24] to tie back into the word of god to
[1:25:27] bring down his holy spirit so the object
[1:25:29] of this message is to fit the word
[1:25:31] together to pull down
[1:25:34] to bring them
[1:25:35] to pull down
[1:25:36] to bring down the holy ghost itself
[1:25:40] we're not talking about 1906. okay the
[1:25:43] lord i shout in the house
[1:25:47] you can't break this
[1:25:49] no man on earth no ministers could break
[1:25:51] this the objective of seven angels come
[1:25:54] from eternity to carry all this
[1:25:56] scattered word to bring all their
[1:25:58] mysteries written and hidden the object
[1:26:01] of it is when it all fit together
[1:26:04] it brings down the holy ghost
[1:26:06] because the word is a conductor of the
[1:26:08] spirit so the spirit couldn't be
[1:26:10] effective because the full word was lost
[1:26:13] but once that word is restored god of a
[1:26:16] channel cordova avenue god of aware
[1:26:19] he could sweep down that pipe and said
[1:26:22] dear is my spirit
[1:26:25] flowing freely
[1:26:30] glory
[1:26:31] give the lord a shout
[1:26:33] hallelujah say amen say hallelujah
[1:26:38] say glory i'm encouraging you to say
[1:26:40] glory to god you have some of this shout
[1:26:42] about
[1:26:48] let me read it again god send the seven
[1:26:50] seals
[1:26:52] and give us a sign by it
[1:26:54] and send seven angels down from heaven
[1:26:56] come to bring back the scattered word
[1:26:59] what did he say that angel came to him
[1:27:00] every night
[1:27:01] to open up the word so it wasn't his
[1:27:03] revelation things he thought was so the
[1:27:05] angels were shamed so
[1:27:07] so every night that angel come them and
[1:27:08] open this seal that sealed that seal oh
[1:27:10] glory to god and christ was the seventh
[1:27:12] seal
[1:27:13] oh give the lord a shout
[1:27:16] and the prophet said i am waiting the
[1:27:17] seven seal is open just waiting for no
[1:27:19] look the book is open
[1:27:21] just waiting for the seventh seal to be
[1:27:23] identified in the coming of the lord oh
[1:27:26] glory to god you heard what he said
[1:27:28] after the seas he said the book is open
[1:27:30] i'm just waiting for the seventh seal
[1:27:33] the last seal
[1:27:35] to be identified
[1:27:37] in the corner of the lord and when the
[1:27:39] prophet was about to leave
[1:27:40] on the message called the rapture
[1:27:42] that's where it was tied together he
[1:27:45] take the seventh seal
[1:27:46] seven thunders
[1:27:48] hanging on the gable of paper and he
[1:27:50] come and identify the lord himself as
[1:27:53] the coming of the lord and that is where
[1:27:55] the buff is at this morning he
[1:27:57] identified first thessalonians four the
[1:28:00] lord himself descended from a man with a
[1:28:03] shout then he said what is the shout
[1:28:05] what is the show he said that's the
[1:28:07] living bread that's the message to get
[1:28:10] the bright together
[1:28:12] oh give the lord a shout there are two
[1:28:14] other parts of his coming voice and
[1:28:16] trump oh glory

[1:35:38] frustration
[1:35:39] should i keep it a secret never private
[1:35:41] revival i have a private revelation
[1:35:45] they have light and they hide in it
[1:35:46] they're all
[1:35:48] they gotta hear the other lights
[1:35:52] like by the out don't like on them

[1:36:16] body the body is waiting for the bright
[1:36:18] as a bride so we call ourselves the
[1:36:20] bride for you the nighting of the bride
[1:36:22] the church is so coming together it
[1:36:24] should create prophecy it should create
[1:36:28] such a love among us that we should be
[1:36:30] hardly away from one another
[1:36:36] so that is my gopher's sake they're
[1:36:38] stabbing ourselves together because you
[1:36:40] don't know when you get caught up in the
[1:36:41] love supposed to love your blindness now

[1:36:46] and take all the evil out
[1:36:48] say your color for me to drop down
[1:36:53] we looking for charity to drop down
[1:36:55] the law and it will help me you know if

[1:37:05] it should have a love among us it's
[1:37:06] create a love among us that we should
[1:37:08] hardly be away from one another that's
[1:37:10] right when you just you don't have to
[1:37:12] beg people to pray
[1:37:14] we're doing that
[1:37:16] l-o-v-e
[1:37:17] you don't have to beg them to worship
[1:37:19] god
[1:37:20] what doing that l-o-v-e
[1:37:22] you don't have to beg them to do what is
[1:37:24] right
[1:37:25] they just do it in love with him
[1:37:28] till there's nothing else
[1:37:29] so no pastor bring some big stick can
[1:37:31] beat you
[1:37:33] some people like that you know

[1:37:53] because really and truly the only things
[1:37:54] beat out at them
[1:37:56] and they're not dealing with themselves
[1:37:58] so they prefer external forces legislate
[1:38:00] righteousness in them

[1:38:04] that tattoo tape
[1:38:08] you know whatness inside of you and you

[1:45:41] does what
[1:45:43] anointed sammy
[1:45:45] let me just stick inside of here but
[1:45:47] abram said this about jesus right he
[1:45:49] said when he was inside the closed doors
[1:45:51] he did something to make them know it
[1:45:53] was he
[1:45:54] after talking with them all day long
[1:45:56] hearing him preach for three years he
[1:45:58] was on earth then after his resurrection
[1:46:00] hearing him preach they did not
[1:46:02] recognize him until he did something
[1:46:04] just like he did before his crucifixion
[1:46:07] then they knew it was him now isn't it
[1:46:09] strange that it's sometimes something on
[1:46:12] the side of the supernatural to make us
[1:46:14] understand it's him
[1:46:17] that teaching itself won't do it
[1:46:25] teaching itself won't do it he never
[1:46:27] commissioned his church to go and teach
[1:46:29] the world he says preach the gospel or
[1:46:32] manifest the gospel and the gospel came
[1:46:34] not in one only but power and demotion
[1:46:37] of the holy spirit
[1:46:38] praise god praise god for teaching all
[1:46:40] these mighty teachers everybody teach
[1:46:42] them
[1:46:43] so they need for us to do that the drama
[1:46:46] but teaching alone can do it
[1:46:48] something has to be done
[1:46:50] supernatural
[1:46:52] oh glory to god and that's the way we
[1:46:54] bring our churches today with highest
[1:46:56] deeper prettiest pew best dressed crowd
[1:46:58] that don't break the toe hole of the
[1:47:00] enemy
[1:47:02] it takes that hidden power of the spirit
[1:47:04] of god
[1:47:05] oh praise god you mean people have tied
[1:47:08] up with enemy had to be broken yes
[1:47:11] oh god and teaching doesn't do it
[1:47:13] oh glory fire does it
[1:47:15] spirit does it
[1:47:16] let him continue like peter here peter
[1:47:19] here he was he was good with the sword
[1:47:21] when jesus got in trouble he pulled out
[1:47:22] his sword he could flop anyway cut the
[1:47:24] high priest his ears off with the sword
[1:47:27] when it comes to real christian courage
[1:47:28] he didn't have it
[1:47:30] but the spiritual courage he denied the
[1:47:32] word made flesh standing right among
[1:47:33] them he was good with his sword that's
[1:47:35] right he could do a decree just as good
[1:47:37] as anybody else when it comes to
[1:47:38] spiritual courage he didn't have it he
[1:47:40] failed right there no why he only he
[1:47:43] only know one thing he screed
[1:47:46] but brother
[1:47:48] after he went up to pentecost
[1:47:50] he put on the old armor of god now watch
[1:47:53] him a different person now he put on the
[1:47:55] old armor what was it the world that he
[1:47:57] walked with was what was in him
[1:47:59] burning him up with fire
[1:48:01] in his flesh and soul
[1:48:03] he had the whole armor of god
[1:48:05] that is god's provider armor he had the
[1:48:08] baptism filled with the holy ghost what
[1:48:11] is it god makes himself ever present his
[1:48:14] own army god on the day of pentecost
[1:48:16] sent down the full arm of god on his
[1:48:17] army so what's the full lamb of god the
[1:48:19] baptism
[1:48:21] of the holy ghost little while the world
[1:48:22] sees me no more but you shall see me is
[1:48:24] not right he is the holy spirit and the
[1:48:27] holy spirit is in us which is the word
[1:48:28] made the promise manifest this is the
[1:48:31] promise christ is the word and he makes
[1:48:33] it manifest now here we go almost done
[1:48:36] the spirit quickens the word
[1:48:39] makes the words the like powder send the
[1:48:42] bullet out there
[1:48:44] and like when david met goliath with a
[1:48:46] slingshot with a rock he had one place
[1:48:48] to hit that was right between the eyes
[1:48:51] the rest of of it was armored but god
[1:48:53] got in that spirit
[1:48:55] so what he's saying god got a hole upon
[1:48:57] david stone
[1:48:59] see david if he gets started going to
[1:49:00] the rest so when god they will release
[1:49:03] the stone which has mechanics the spirit
[1:49:05] take it up as dynamics and and and was a
[1:49:08] guided missile and hit
[1:49:10] right where he didn't have that armor
[1:49:12] isn't that right
[1:49:13] praise god something is fixing to happen
[1:49:15] cause there's the word the promise the
[1:49:17] power to sling it and what we need today
[1:49:19] is a man that will take god's word with
[1:49:22] the power of the holy ghost behind him
[1:49:24] to press it out there and watch it come
[1:49:26] to pass that is god's army now here we
[1:49:30] go he presents his army in the form of
[1:49:32] five offices first prophets apostles
[1:49:35] prophets teachers pastors evangelists so
[1:49:38] all those liars who want to annul the
[1:49:40] fifo ministry that's what they are
[1:49:42] they're liars that's not the word at all
[1:49:44] this is what god said he presented his
[1:49:45] army oh glory to god isn't that right
[1:49:48] that's his army here we say that's his
[1:49:50] commanding officers all with the baptism
[1:49:53] of the holy ghost
[1:49:55] waiting out there to meet the enemy on
[1:49:57] any grounds he comes upon
[1:49:59] to meet the enemy with the word of god
[1:50:01] each one back in one another
[1:50:03] not fighting up with one another backing
[1:50:05] one up so when a man fighting the gospel
[1:50:07] and fighting this minister you know he's
[1:50:08] only five ministry at all that's not the
[1:50:10] first ministry they back one up is that
[1:50:11] right
[1:50:12] watch here this part this is the most
[1:50:14] important part here each one backing up
[1:50:16] with him
[1:50:18] the chief captain
[1:50:20] not in front
[1:50:21] not up here
[1:50:22] above
[1:50:23] not back behind but in them
[1:50:27] so the fifo ministry is god veiled in
[1:50:31] men as apostles teacher prophet
[1:50:33] evangelist pastors
[1:50:35] not man saying that is that because the
[1:50:37] bible said that
[1:50:41] oh my do we believe that
[1:50:43] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:50:45] that's his army
[1:50:47] or with the baptism holy ghost pick up
[1:50:49] play something or where the batman
[1:50:51] really goes
[1:50:52] praise god that's his commanding
[1:50:54] officers to meet the enemy everywhere
[1:50:56] under any condition
[1:50:58] he said with him the chief captain not
[1:51:00] out here in front up here behind but but
[1:51:03] in them that's the army vindicating what
[1:51:05] his resurrection by proofs of his works
[1:51:08] saint john 14 12. he believes in me the
[1:51:10] words that i do shall you also what is
[1:51:11] it it is god in the church
[1:51:14] in these
[1:51:15] five
[1:51:16] predestinated offices
[1:51:18] backing up every word that he said with
[1:51:20] the holy spirit himself there which is
[1:51:22] the wooden manifest proven his
[1:51:24] resurrection proving that he lives
[1:51:26] russia make a little move just a little
[1:51:28] more
[1:51:30] i shouldn't say a little move they're
[1:51:31] moving a long time
[1:51:33] one time they went and take georgia a
[1:51:35] place called georgia
[1:51:37] then they take doing obama time crimea
[1:51:40] and he's setting up a definite plan
[1:51:42] now he come down and take trying to take
[1:51:44] ukraine
[1:51:45] he's not going to stop there
[1:51:47] no that spirit in him not gonna stop
[1:51:50] once he get through the air he's gonna
[1:51:51] go further that forces the unity on this
[1:51:54] side the west
[1:51:56] gets united
[1:51:57] and that going to be reflected now the
[1:52:00] church united to follow this conquest
[1:52:02] churches they're fighting communism and
[1:52:04] they fight communism and they're heaping
[1:52:05] up now and whatever go against what they
[1:52:08] believe they're going to cut off
[1:52:09] and that's where we come in now
[1:52:12] because remember this church is to be a
[1:52:13] bride of christ
[1:52:15] not one of the regular other
[1:52:16] denominations we're not supposed to be
[1:52:18] like a regular other church like
[1:52:20] pentecostal church we're supposed to
[1:52:22] have a church with a shout of the king
[1:52:23] in the camp
[1:52:24] christ walking in it could you imagine
[1:52:27] christ inside this church here walking
[1:52:29] in it cripples walking healing
[1:52:32] rocking the pentecostal hearing about it
[1:52:33] everybody hearing fire in the building
[1:52:36] crippled walking all kind of
[1:52:37] supernatural taking place you think
[1:52:39] that's easy for them to listen to and
[1:52:41] hear about they're gonna want to know
[1:52:42] what's going on then they hear them
[1:52:44] believe in a prophet called william
[1:52:45] branham they say he falls them falls and
[1:52:48] this afterwards now pressures haven't
[1:52:50] come upon them the word stop it
[1:52:52] that's what's coming right
[1:52:55] what are you gonna do since
[1:52:56] how are you going to be paying hard for
[1:52:57] that
[1:52:58] you want to be genuine you want to be
[1:53:00] sincere you want to be ready
[1:53:02] how could you be genuine and approach
[1:53:04] god and there's inequity in your heart
[1:53:06] are you going to be insane you know you
[1:53:07] haven't made things right
[1:53:09] you have to make things right
[1:53:11] when you make things right you can
[1:53:12] approach god because the end of the day
[1:53:14] is he is he want to take us out
[1:53:16] we can't take ourselves out
[1:53:18] all these ministers are saying who any
[1:53:19] bragging on it by this foolishness i
[1:53:21] feel sorry for them they have problems
[1:53:23] they have issues
[1:53:25] on the field by declaring this and
[1:53:26] declaring that come like somebody's
[1:53:29] come like this because the people
[1:53:30] commanding god i command you to do this
[1:53:32] i'll come i keep them in charge of god
[1:53:35] i'm in charge of god commanding god and
[1:53:36] telling god what to do
[1:53:38] and god nothing here them god not even
[1:53:40] speaking to them and then in their own
[1:53:42] world with the money and the whole
[1:53:44] money god's plans on and commanding
[1:53:45] gospel
[1:53:46] they're not even praying right now
[1:53:47] they're declaring the suffering i
[1:53:49] declare i declare all i'm declaring now
[1:53:51] i declare this i declared as i declared
[1:53:52] this that means the declarations
[1:53:55] declarers
[1:53:56] did not pray no more oh god i'm
[1:53:58] dependent upon jesus i pray them
[1:53:59] something praying they won't declare any
[1:54:00] clearing declaring
[1:54:01] oh god fooled
[1:54:04] you know
[1:54:05] how to close
[1:54:07] i was studying this message called uh
[1:54:09] harvest time i've listened to that
[1:54:11] message several times and somehow i just
[1:54:14] couldn't like you almost like you you
[1:54:16] know you're in i'm not getting what i
[1:54:18] want to get i'm not like i'm missing
[1:54:20] something in it at this time i pray i
[1:54:22] say lord jesus would you open up to me
[1:54:25] what the prophet said in this half this
[1:54:26] time
[1:54:27] and it was an odd scripture he read
[1:54:29] about jesus and a temptation and it's
[1:54:31] written and written and so on
[1:54:33] and i'm listening i'm listening and all
[1:54:36] of a sudden because he himself said he
[1:54:38] don't know why he's calling this message
[1:54:41] half his time
[1:54:42] he said that i don't know why i'm titled
[1:54:44] his message harvest time but this is
[1:54:46] something that's going to come in
[1:54:48] harvesting so he's going to how it is
[1:54:50] written it's written also written and so
[1:54:52] on and he was showing that in the last
[1:54:53] days
[1:54:55] when the devil recognized he can't move
[1:54:56] with this he's going to give you a
[1:54:58] supernatural offer
[1:55:00] to be somebody
[1:55:02] the people follow your ministry and and
[1:55:04] a little supernatural and that just blew
[1:55:07] my mind somehow all the time i listened
[1:55:09] to the message i never heard that part
[1:55:10] and then he went on to say he will give
[1:55:12] you a position in church
[1:55:14] or i'll put you in this place
[1:55:17] so then they gave you a decomposed elder
[1:55:19] pose at this post and that's supposed to
[1:55:21] anchor you in his kingdom and his sister
[1:55:24] and how proud you'll feel to be this and
[1:55:28] you get positioned
[1:55:29] harvest time
[1:55:31] and you have to overcome the lust of the
[1:55:32] eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride
[1:55:34] of life what is position pride of life
[1:55:36] i'm in this position
[1:55:38] see
[1:55:39] offers come
[1:55:40] in this last day the second one is a is
[1:55:43] a weird one because the second one with
[1:55:45] jesus tell jesus they satan tell jesus
[1:55:48] but it's written that those shall you
[1:55:50] know
[1:55:51] that's yourself against the stone and
[1:55:52] shall keep the up jump
[1:55:56] offer
[1:55:58] so be careful be careful in the last
[1:56:01] days he says a razor edge it has to be
[1:56:03] the word
[1:56:04] so that's why you got to put a watchman
[1:56:05] in the tower to watch for your souls
[1:56:08] that's why you have to understand and
[1:56:10] believe that god is speaking to us by
[1:56:12] his word
[1:56:13] not what i feel but by the word so it's
[1:56:16] addressing your life addressing issues
[1:56:18] addressing challenges you have to
[1:56:20] prepare yourself
[1:56:21] do you think the people in ukraine must
[1:56:22] prepare for this war of course not
[1:56:25] but things are not normal in ukraine
[1:56:28] and things will not be normal shortly in
[1:56:30] your life
[1:56:31] and around us and around the world
[1:56:33] because warfare is about to break out
[1:56:35] big time
[1:56:36] because long as you remain exclusive in
[1:56:39] moxie mode
[1:56:40] or in foolish mode devil leave you alone
[1:56:43] you know you leave them you don't look
[1:56:44] here already

[1:56:56] alone then you're stripping zone then

[1:57:08] when he touching my wake up
[1:57:10] he's sleeping
[1:57:13] but when you begin to see wait a minute
