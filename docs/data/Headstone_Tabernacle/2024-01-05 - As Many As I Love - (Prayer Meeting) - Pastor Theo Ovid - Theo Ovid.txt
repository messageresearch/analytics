tonight but is first PR meting of 2024 and I pray that you would come in into your word and speak to our hearts Lord it be different May the effect of it be different because we are coming down to that hour Lord where all scriptures are going to be fulfilled your Prophet said been coming to Calvary many many scriptures were fulfilled in a very short period of time we believe this is a critical year in the junction and history of mankind where the wheels of Prophecy are being turned help us Lord and prepare our hearts for your soon coming prepare our hearts to receive truth Lord you prophesied in the scriptures that there are people would have itching ears and wouldn't hear sound Doctrine they would Heap to themselves teachers in their hearts they only desire what they want to hear as opposed to what you want to speak we invite you to speak to us by your spirit granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you tonight I want to welcome each and every one of you here tonight I I could see like it almost appear as if you couldn't wait to be on and that's a good thing so we want to turn our Bibles to Revelation chapter 3 and I believe but Isaac struck 21 and 22 we just want to go from one to 20 of Revelation chapter 3 is a familar scripture unto the angel of the church in sis uh just one minute okay Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 sorry R 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of laan write these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou me neither cold nor H I would thou would Co a heart so then because th luk on neither cold nor h i will skew the out of my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I coun you to buy of me gold Tri and the far that th may be rich and white reignment that th may be close that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint th eyes with is that th may see as many as I Lov I rebuke and chase them be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sh with him and be with me may God bless his word tonight again thank you for being here we appreciate all of you who choose to join us tonight we pray that the holy spirit will speak to your heart you need to hear from God the Bible is not a regular text the Bible is not a novel it's not a you have non-fiction and fiction there's none of that the Bible is God's word and he could look over his own word to make sure his word is gued and he will bring us with to pass he doesn't try to ask us to manufacture anything he want us to believe what he says and act upon what he says so tonight I have something upon my heart and that thought that I have upon my heart is as many as I love as many as I love and this is brother Brandon he is praying heavenly father as we are so enjoyed this fine Fellowship singing how would Trill my heart when I heard that song they done see me father I trust that we be all dear each one of us and we are bowed now towards the dust we pray that you receive our Thanksgiving and our repentance and our prayer for each other look out at his place receive our Thanksgiving and our repentance and our prayer for each other so tonight this night is along the line of repentance now he says now the reason that the Holy Spirit today would rebuke and tear down the church as me a love rebuke thank God for rebuking a real father to straighten us up and get us out whether the scripture is here just let's obey it now in this age Hebrew 12 chapter says if they cannot stand chastisement if they cannot stand won't take rebuke him they're illegitimate and not sons of God a man blow up H I ain't going to listen to that anymore go right ahead illegitimate but a real child of God will take his correction saying yes Father it's your word I've got to straighten up now I've got to do what is right and you know you would see over the years months you keep hearing us talking about people that they are entitled and they are wrong with that entitlement they are wrong with that entitlement because every son that come to God will be chastised and will be corrected butam say uh he so he he had an experience he went to this restaurant we familiar with it just want to just reflect back over it and he was a woman was there with all kind of crazy clothes and everything else and and and and and World music playing and he begin to say Lord how long will you stand this evil and this sin and how long God how can you stand it he said look over to my right I heard someone make out a big grown and there sat an age woman probably 60 years 70 years she had on those old Fula clothes and I was thinking I said God why don't you destroy the whole thing why don't you just sink it Ben the earth I said is my little Sarah and Rebecca going to have to grow up on such stuff like that and God in your great Holiness ever stand to look on a thing like that and not send an earthquake and sink it as I was standing dear condemning the woman as I was I stepped back behind the door and I felt the spirit of God come to me and I stepped behind the door I seemed like something whiring and when it was in the vision it was the world turning WR and around and I noticed around the world was a Scarlet streak around the world and as I got to the world I see myself just a little boy doing things that I ought not to do maybe not like ego was sin but every time I did anything I seen that great black shadow gr towards heaven and God would have kill me at that minute and I see standing between me and God stood that perfect sacrifice I seen him standing dear with the torns on his head spit hanging on his face and every time my sins would start towards God he would reach out and catch it like a bumper on the car he was protecting me from Death so the wages of sin is Deb and this experience where was sharing that every sin was like a black shadow going to God and Jesus his blood was like a bumper on the car he was protecting me from De and every time I would do anything wrong we can underline anything wrong God would have killed me certainly his Holiness requires it his laws requires it and every time I would do anything or you do anything the blood of Jesus Christ acts like a bumper when I see that Scarlet Street meant that then the blood still holds the Earth question now what this shows is is that you could do a whole lot of crap because you're under a covering covering of the blood you see so it's your choice if you're going to recognize that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and God wants you to keep your temple clean and holy but when I have I wrote this down here but when the cup of iniquity is filled up then God takes action so B says here now as I looked looking I got a little closer to him I notice him he would hear me say father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing and I look down and there laid a book and there was recording Angel standing by side and every time I sinned it was put down in the book my name was on it and I realized that someday that blood streak would be lifted and I would have to stand in the presence of God with my sinful life but I seen by his Mercy he was holding off my judgment so I went to him humbly I knelt on my knees so all he see the vision I said oh Jesus thou Son of God I am unworthy to come in your presence will you please forgive me for what I have done question are you going to do that tonight to ask God for forgiveness for your personal sins he touched his side with his hand took it the old book and wrote pardon showed it back behind him and my sins were gone then he looked me s in the face on the light St s in the face he said no I have forgiven you but you want to give them her then I seen what it meant as I come out of the vision I walk over to her I said how do you do she was drinking she looked up at me said hello and he begin to speak to her he said lady just a few minutes ago standing Y and I begin to tell her as I begin to look the tears begin to drop down from her cheeks she told told me I said lady you don't mean to do these things Jesus died and the judgments of God is held off by his blood you don't mean to do this she said no sir my father was a deacon in the church I was raised in a Christian home my husband and I were ched members I live a Christian Life she began to tell me after his death she had two young girls she went astray all the girls had left her she had thrown her life away and she thought there was no more hope for her I said God be merciful those who for he has called she said are you Reverend bam she said I am he said I'm ashamed of myself to be sitting here like this do you think there will be a chance to me I said Jesus has his arm stretched out waiting for you to come lady and the other people begin to take up I said would you walk out here on this floor with me she said I will sir I took her by the hand I said you about the age of my mother would you kneel here with me on the floor and dear in the floor we broke up that place that afternoon to a oldfashioned meeting and God saved that woman by his grace she dressed herself come to the meeting as far as I know living a Christian Life tonight and this is what he said us what is it God requires Perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him no matter how much you have sinned how little how much you are still a sinner let me repeat that no matter how much you have sinned little or much you are still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice and in him you are perfected forever think of it it is nothing you do it is not turning new pages you turn it is not a new life you start here we go Saints it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection and then you are perfected in Jesus Christ it is what it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection and then you're perfected in Jesus Christ so listen to this now in the beginning was the word wood was with God the wood was God the wood became flesh and he was the pillar of fire once then he come was made flesh now he comes in your flesh what is he doing God condescending trying to draw near to his people so he can be loved and worship we in the louan age turned him on the outside he's knocking trying to get back in and here we are that is God our father in the form of the Holy Ghost trying to get back into our lives to control us so we know assuredly that God will not force us God will not hold our hands and hold our hearts and force us to repent Force us to make things right Force us to cleanse ourselves like the Bible talk about having therefore these promises let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God vessels of Honor if we mortify the Deeds on our body and cleanse ourselves we become vessels of Honor that is your choice that is my choice that is our choice that the word could have the pinenes something but U struck in the the last message Sunday passed where Deuteronomy 8:1 he said and thou shalt remember all the way in which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would keep his commandment or no so the only way God could see what's in our hearts is to pass us the way of the Wilderness the way of the Wilderness or hardship or trials or testings however you want to present it it's a way in which God really punctures to see what's inside of them and it's only when the tests come and the Trials come it reveals who we are what is inside is what will come out let's see if we can wrap it up again that is God our F in the form of the Holy Ghost trying to get back into our lives to control us he's got to have a church I said last night that Capstone come on it's got to come on they perfect and the church has got to draw into Perfection you say perfection that's what he said be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is imperfect it okay let's go revelation 31819 I conciously buy of me gold TR and the fire thou th be rich why rment that thou may be closed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and KN and eyes with i that down may see as many as I love I reuk and chasen be zealous therefore repent and the brother R says this here the counsel of God is thirst it is to the point and that word thirst there means abrupt short brief Gruff condensed clipped blunt God's counsel you will never see a wasted word everything is condensed it is blunt it is clipped it is short it is AB brough it is brief it is thirst and bah said to himself it is to the point he directs his lasted Church to one hope that hope is himself he says come to me and by it is evidence from the phrase by of me that the Lan Church age is not at all dealing with Jesus or spiritual products of the kingdom of God their transactions cannot be spiritual they may think that they are spiritual but how can they be let's look at the word buy buy is the pay a price if we are to have a Revival and we know a revivalist promise but the Revival have a cost byy mean a price when the wise verions told the foolish versions go to them that sell it simply meant go and pay the price it meant that the wise virgin PID the price to have extra the foolish virgins was content just to have enough the wise virgin saw the need to have extra so he said the works in their midst are definitely not as Paul would say God in you willing doing his own pleasure thus these churches okay I skip that by me go try the fire you may be rich now these people had plenty of gold but it was the wrong kind it was the gold that bought men's lives and destroyed them it was the gold that wed and twisted human character for his love was the root of all evil which is money and Money Changes people they get tight they get selfish they get mean it changes people watch I'm going to skip down this now and wrap up here all right but he's talking about Babylon for habitation of devils Revelation 18 and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and live deliciously with her and then he said alas alas the great City Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come this is this is powerful here now and the merchants of the Earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buy it the merchandise any more and the's eyes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine and purple silk and Scarlet all thine wood and all manner vessels of ivory all manner vessels precious stones brass iron marble cinnamon orders ointments frankincense wine oil fine flow wheat Beast sheep horses chariots slaves and Souls of men and the fruit of thy Soul lusted after I departed from thee and all things which were dainty and godly departed from thee Thou shalt find them no more in other words Babylon being judged now these words this is exactly the organized churches of the last day for it says in verse four come out of her my people and he put here right after that the Rapture has not yet taken place so we going to see a lot of stuff happening and the Rapture has not yet taken place he said the bride is not yet gone here we go when these terrible conditions in this Rich false Church exist there is a goal and that goal is 1 Peter 1:7 that the child of your faith being more precious than that of gold that perisheth the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction that is where I can of go why am I saying all this tonight Saints you have to toughen up we have to toughen up we have to become strong Bible believing Christians strong word Christians this is the only way out you have to be able to disconnect from what you feel what you think your emotions how you want it to be and come to the place where all you want to know is what God Said and you could simply say God said so I give a little testimony considering how I got on the flight and I had to repent because I recognize then we have to trust God more because how it unfold to me was like a miracle living right in front of me and I've seen so many of these things that all I can know it is the hand of God and I'm sure in your life there experiences and stuff that you could testify of it was the mighty hand of God let me say close here watch this the goal of God is a chis character produced how by Mysteries by teachings by reation in the fiery fullness of Affliction that is the right kind of go what kind of goal does the church have today it has World goal that will perish it is Rich listen to this it is complacent it has made affluence the major Criterion of spirituality and he's talking about AFF by what car you have what house you have and everything else right he said you better come before it's too late buy of me gold triing the far and then you'll be truly Rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is all we can take with us nothing less nothing more so we better be careful now to see we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our our character that is what we will take with us what kind of character will you take with you whether it be his whose character was molded by suffering in the fire fullness of Affliction or will it be we go the softness of this characterless loudes and people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man shall bear his own burden almost done as many as I love har you can Chas him this is the same message that John had when he was dealing with the Pharisees and sades he said repent there was no other cause then there is no other C now there was no other way to get back to God then there's no other way now it is repent change your mind turn around repent what you're doing now that is contrary to God and His word stop it stop it tonight repent tonight let us he said he said it is to repent change your mind turn around repent for why will you die let us examine the first phrase as many as I love in the Greek the emphasis is upon the personal pron I he does not say as many would feel he should say as many as love me no sir we must never try to make Jesus the object of human love in this earth no it is the many that are the loved ones of God it is his love in question not ours so once again we find ourselves glorying his salvation his purpose his plan and we are confirmed even more strongly in the truth of the doctrine of the sovereignity of God even as he said in Romans 9:13 Jacob has I loved does it now obtain that since he only loved many he therefore in the state of complacency awaiting the love of those who have not drawn n him by no means he declared in Romans 9:13 Esau have I hated and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it this love is elective love it is his love for his elect and his love for them is aart from Human Merit let me repeat that again his love for them is apart from Human Merit for it says that the purpose of God stands in election which is exactly opposite to works or anything man has done thems because before the children were born you already said Jacob have I loved es so have I Heen now he says to his own as many as I love so when you see sisters can't take correction brothers can't take correction people Gruff and like a frog eting toad eting bushot and caring with a bunch of foolishness you know that is this is not what God talking about here as many as I love I rebuked and chasen if you are not being rebuked by the Spirit rebuked by the word or being searched by the spirit you have to check yourself and see what is going on because this goes to his elective bride as many as I love I rebuke and Chas him and as I finish listen to this to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction in other words God wants us to be on the right track exposing sin exposing your behavior exposing your attitude is a view to get you corrected chasen does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind just like a father or a parent not the kind of how should I say delinquent parents we have now no the real parents will discipline their children because they want them to be on the right track and then he says this this is exactly what Hebrews 12 says and you have forgotten the exaltation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise not the chasing of the Lord nor faint when thou rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth love it underline love that he Chast it and scorge every son whom he receive and if you endure underline endure endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not and if we be much be without chastisement wherefore all are partakers then we are bastards in that sense furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who which corrected us and we give them reverence shall we not more rather be subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasen us after their own pleasure but he for our Prophet that we might partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seem it to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterwards that yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that are exercised thereby herein is now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons like himself therefore before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and onto this honor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained listen to these words now will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves we talking about the chosen one now he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chases with nail scar hand sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be oh little flock do not fear the ages fast closing and as it does those Tails will be bound together and as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they will have tremendous three-fold strength of political physical spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ here this one she will suffer but she will endure Oh I thought the Rapture coming and oh I'll Fly Away Oh Glory not yet not yet not yet they will seek to destroy the bride who is the day the political the physical and the spirit spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he who love his own love them unto the end be zealous therefore and repent now when people think they're right they repented for nothing God is with me liar God is not you're cursing and you're smoking and you're fooling around and you're fornicating and you're living on clean God is not with you what is happening there because of the covering of the blood nothing happened yet I always say this message have not seen God's judgment but that's read be therefore repent I say now watch he's talking about they supporting their own Creed and dogmas in the message talking about message we talking Pentecostal and baptism they have put the word out for their own ideas you hear me many times saying people preaching their own message and sprinkling it like like ketchup or Salah dressing of the message upon their own sermon and their own invention right now watch they have put out their own ideas they have deposed the Holy Ghost and make men into leaders and make men into leaders they have put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works good works but God is calling for another Zeal this is where we it is a Zeal to cry I am wrong now who is going to say that he's wrong there are so many people once you start to talk to them they put up their defenses sometime they find I like how you talk to me how you supposed to talk to you sofy nicey God is thirst sometime God get angry and if God take a man and begin to use that man you would see the anger of God through that man he would see the fear you would see so much different things because God is a living being he not in the human emotions he's not in the feelings and feel feel feel as you feel like God love is is Parental love that is not the love he has he has elective love he could send you through this through that through that we don't want to fail him he has done so much for us chose us called us elected us and the least we could do is give our life over to him so I'm going to close right here God is calling for another Zeal it is a Zeal to cry I'm wrong now who is going to say he is wrong who's going to say let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only to the false Church to repent in this verse he is talking to his elect so I'm not talking a fraudulent message tonight I'm not sharing you something oh gosh intellectual gymnastics you're not going there this verse he is talking to his elect they have some repenting to do many of his children are still in those churches they are those whom he speaks to in Ephesians 5:14 awake thou that sleepest arise from the dead and Christ shall give the light to be asleep is not to be dead they are sleeping amongst the dead they are there in dead denomination they are floating along with them God Christ wake up repent of your Folly here they are lending their influence giving their time and their money actually their very lives to these Antichrist organizations in the message I would say they need to have a change of mind and turn towards truth yes this is the age that most needs to repent but will it will it bring back the word will it again enr the holy spirit in men's life will it again rever Jesus as the only savior I say not because Jesus said I stand and un knock let's bow our heads Heavenly Father this was just upon me tonight to share with your people as many as I love oh God you hate sin you want them out of sin you don't want them continuing in sin you want them to repent and come completely out of sin May that work start tonight May that Spirit of crying out of mourning of groaning of travailing of repenting oh Jesus may start tonight that oh God we all said I am wrong oh God I need you Lord I need you in this hour taking things for granted taking service for granted taking premit for granted taking Comm to church for granted taking the labor for granted oh God may we not be like that Lord but may we hunger and thirst after righteousness stir us up tonight stir up the church stir up the ministers the elders the deacons the trustees the ushers the Ley all around the Sunday School the musicians the tech bers Lord each stir them up Lord may they understand by coming to church by participating is not a guarantee of getting anything father we have to be perfected we have to come into Perfection and Perfection is by your blood and by your grace and by your mercy and by trials and testings as the songwriter beautiful put it some to the waters some to the flood some to Great TR but all through the blood Lord your blood has given us tremendous opportunity oh God in this hour that we live in Father oh God your blood is still covering us and yet we could sin and fail and fall Lord being under that covering but tonight I pray such a cleansing will come may you release the seraps Lord with the co of the altar may they come with tongues Lord may they fly back and forth in the homes of your people even as I pray right now may the fire of God Break Forth in the homes of your people Lord rebuke Lord God delinquent parents who wouldn't take a hold upon their children rebuke delinquent parents who wouldn't correct their sons or correct their daughters rebuke them Father in the spirit father arrest them Father Who joking and carrying on I wouldn't tell them what they need to know what they need to hear oh God it's a Rapture that is coming but there's a preparation for your coming Lord help us Lord that our hearts might be prepared oh God the wise virgins that is why you taged them that way that is why you Nam them that way wise virgins father oh God they were wise enough to get the wisdom of Revelation to catch the open door to get the Holy Ghost to be filled with power to be filled with your presence to be filled with your grace oh God freshly anoint your sons and daughters May there be an explosion this coming Sunday with
