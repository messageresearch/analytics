appreciate the Lord so God bless you amen amen everybody all right tonight amen what a blessing it is to be here let's just give the Lord a hand of Praise all over this place amen Wherever You Are just want to thank God for his goodness and his mercy and his kindness and his faithfulness toward us amen I just have a couple a couple of things I'd like to share but before I do so let's just buy heads in a wood of Prayer and I want to read a prayer from the message of Church of the Living God and brother Brown opened this way and I just felt led to to pray this prayer this evening I think it's it's timely and applicable and just want to start off in this way amen if you'll just bar heads it says oh Heavenly Father we thank thee tonight that we can sing that from the depths of our heart Lord I believe and as a father with an epileptic son years ago said help thou my unbelief we hear this question asked one day when he returns will he find faith he never questioned whether he'd find righteousness or whether he he'd find Christians but would he find faith when he returned knowing that would be one thing people would let go on hearing also the Holy Spirit speaking in the last days and I believe he is now that how these times would come men would have a form of godliness but would deny the power lack of faith and we thank thee Lord tonight because in our hearts we feel that we have just a little faith and help us Lord that Faith may be increased tonight until it'll be so high so lost and complete surrender in Christ until Great and Mighty Works will be shown tonight we believe that tonight forgive us of all our shortcomings now and help us may the Holy Spirit just now the great officer of God here in the earth searching out for a bride for the Lord Jesus and may He tonight visit every heart in a special way for we ask it in the name of the beloved Son of God Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats amen my what almighty God we serve you know I I I love that song I just love what that stands for what a mighty God we serve in the good times and the bad times when we don't understand no matter how we feel no matter how things look it may look dark I might look gloomy but what a mighty God we serve tonight amen you know I have a simple thought and and just for for a title I'd say faith to unlock the promises of God you know Faith to unlock the promises of God and at this time I just want to want to thank the pastor for the opportunity for for being able to share tonight and and for the Liberty to speak this way and how many of you appreciate Sunday service brother Olu what a masterpiece I mean back-to-back week after week it was tremendous and and I just felt led to bring this thought on faith because you know it's it's so interesting that we know we're trying to say when the son of man comes shall he find faith on the earth and it it sounds like such a simplistic thing we have faith and and how difficult could this be you know and if we if we just stand for a minute and and just review the scriptures there we could read from the book of Hebrews chapter 11 just two verses and it says from Hebrews 11 verse 1 it says no faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and if we were to move down to verse 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen just bar heads once more o Heavenly Father we've read your word Lord we pray that you would breed life and say it Lord I pray that you would take me out of the way and you'll speak through me Lord speak live to heir to your people Lord Lord if there's anyone here Lord if there's anyone connected if there's anyone that will watch this step Lord I pray that you will raise them up that you'll build up their Faith Lord that you'll give them strength and power and understanding and an authority Lord Lord that they could unlock your promises that you've left for your people Lord Lord I pray that the words that would share tonight will find good ground in the hearts of a people and that lives will be changed and transformed by your Holy Spirit and by your power in Jesus name we pray amen you may have a seat once more you know and just just for context there we read what faith is because it seems like such a simple thing why would it be so difficult to find When Faith to some extent is even unconscious it's something that we practice all the time without even thinking about it yet you say when the son of man come shall he find faith on the Earth right it sounds almost paradoxical that something so simple would be so hard to find or fruit should be such a struggle to find and in the prayer and that's why I read it in the prayer brother Brandon actually said that's one thing that people would let go of and as a as I thought about it I realized you know it might seem so simple it may seem so little and almost insignificant you know it took Faith to come here tonight I mean we could say God predestinated that you'll be here and you had to be here to hear what you've heard but it took Faith to leave home and tell your loved ones you know what I'll be back later I'm coming back you know it took me to start that car out to get in that transport or that ride and it was unconscious we didn't have even have to think about it because of our experience because we automatically believe that it's gonna come to pass we believe we'll reach back home what if we don't I'm not here to frighten you now but I'm just showing how we use this everyday thing this nugget that is so special sometimes without a level of Consciousness so we have first of all what what we could deem unto unconscious Faith as a matter of fact in in a message Melchizedek the great Prince and King and here paragraph 48 brother brand himself said it this way he say just like you are come from your homes today they probably want to return to your homes told your wife or your loved ones I'll be back sometime right afternoon how do you know you are the same question as how do you know that he is faithful to to bring you here and Carry You Back Carry you to work and carry back home carrier to school or that doctor's appointment and back home how do you know no no that he said you don't try to wander have I got faith enough to go home you don't have I got enough to drive my car you're just unconsciously turn your key on drive one away and go home see it's the unconscious faith that does it that's the way it is in Christ we just unconsciously just say that's his word that just settles it there is no more to it and gone that's how they get well that's how people are healed that's how they're delivered that's how they're set free they just believe they just grab a hold of that Faith they don't think too much about it they don't try to figure it out as a matter of fact I may not get it but you said you know if you could figure it out you don't use Faith anymore you don't need Faith anymore because it becomes it becomes part of your logical thought it becomes part of of your construct your mental construct if you knew exactly how it worked you didn't have to trust God you didn't need faith faith is that thing that you can't hardly explain that you can't really understand but you believe in your heart that it's gonna happen and what reinforces that is because if he promises that thing to take place you could set your heart on it you could Bank on it and know it's gonna come to pass because he promises and keeps all his promises unlike you and I we can fail and fall and we could promise something today and we forget about it he doesn't forget your friends may tell you listen I'm gonna meet you at four o'clock and and using Trinity time quarter past four they're not there yet but not God he's always on time he's always faithful to deliver and once you catch a whole of the promise and you connected with faith I want to say faith is the key that unlocks that that cause it to be manifested oftentimes they ask but but listen how come this one got healed how come this one got delivered how come this one is restored we can't understand we've been in church for five years for 10 years for 20 years and it doesn't seem to happen to us and and the answer is always simple your faith the belief they took logic out of it they took knowledge out of it they talk history and experience out of it and they're tied into something that could cause something to happen that could cause the end result that could cause a manifestation to take place without thinking too much about how it shall be that's the kind of mighty God we serve that's why I love him it's hard to explain I can't even figure it out but I know it's true I know it works once you could grab a hold of that you know you would see the results come to pass but what I find was even more interesting is that Jesus spoke about different levels of Faith you know brother Branham he went in a little deeper to identify that I spoke of one type before that was unconscious Faith yeah the faith that you're not really thinking about it you think you know what I'm going downstairs and I'm going to come back up I go in for some water and coming back up you don't you don't think about that one too much that's unconscious right almost in your subconscious you just do it but there are different types so I call that one beginner Faith No it's not less than but it's beginner Faith it's faith that you don't have to work but can you imagine like like you want to to build body or you want to lift weeds also and you go to the gym the first day and they tell you well hear what you want just to start on the treadmill walk in a little bit it's something almost everybody could do everybody could do it you didn't have to practice you didn't have to train you didn't have experience you didn't have to see somebody else walk on it but you could do it it was almost subconscious because walking was something you were accustomed to amen so in this case they say this subconscious feat could happen without really see an example of it you don't need to see somebody go to church and go back home to know that you could do it too you don't need to see somebody drive a car and bring it back to know that you could do it too but but there are different levels of Faith so this one we want to move to is is is the kind of faith I call I call Fair true personal experience you know when you go through something and you go through something else and you'll go through something else and you know that you know that you know that God delivered your back then so you're gonna deliver your no and he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he was faithful to bring you out of this trial well listen this one here is chicken feed because because from personal experience I could tell it reminds me of David when he said listen who is this uncircumcised Philistine come to challenge the army of the Living God and he said listen listen from my personal experience let me tell you a story listen a bear came to interfere with my flocks and he delivered it a lion came to interfere with with my flocks and he delivered me so this uncircumcised Philistine in front of me true personal experience his faith this wasn't unconscious anymore this was a level of faith that was let's call it charged by personal experience it was at a higher level that he could look he never did this mind you mind you you have a seat he never did this fit before you know he never saw Philistines this large this was an anomaly this was strange this was different but you know what the principles of God remain the same if he could do it back then he could do it that day if he could do it for them he could do it for us if he could do it with him he could do it with me and that's the principle so through experience when he saw listen the beer the lion and I could testify about it personalize my story this is my story this is my song Nobody have to tell me nobody have to preach to me nobody have to show me in a book or tell me look look what happened here no but from personal experience he could grab a whole lot and no listen you're finished and chop your head off it's a finished work there's nothing that could stop him because his experience proved that his faith could be raised to defeat the enemy to deliver him out of that trial amen so I just want to read a couple of quotes here because I always say the prophet says it's better than I that than I can right so so he said now Simeon he believed because the Holy Ghost had promised him he was looking for it he was expecting it you got something behind that you believe that God had promised it then you got a writer expect it amen is that right when God promises it no I might break my promise cause I'm a man and your friend might break his promise or her promise but God won't break his own amen [Music] he can't because he's God can you imagine how pure unadulterated his promises are how infinite why if I'd go down to a spring and listen to the example if my grandfather drank out of that spring and it was clear and tested the water and it was a hundred percent pure and my father drink out of it and it was a hundred percent pure and all done through life I drank out of it and it was a hundred percent pure why I'd have enough Faith to go back and believe if I take a drink of the water it would be all right amen wouldn't you think they see him through the generations down through several Generations has been proven 100 pure why because this stream that's gushing it up where it's coming from its foundations down there it's bad it's throwing up pure water now if it'll test 100 pure now listen to this how much more will the promise of God test 100 right because the basis of it God's word comes from God which is infinite and pure and holy and he can't lie but he's God there you are now when God promises anything that's right amen that's from expectations and and just know when I give the example of David we talk about personal experience and and the next way to say personal experiences is to call yourself a witness yeah and and and sometimes when we discuss crime you say we're looking for eyewitnesses we don't want somebody's story or somebody's version of what they think the hood you want their personal experience because they were there so David's Brothers could have said listen I go and challenge goliathanol because my brother does manage sheep and a beer came by my brother and he delivered you know God delivered him out and he hands and he they could have done that but there's nothing that beats its personal experience so he said he said you know in in the message with Witnesses he said I'm a witness of the power of God and this is David now a beer went up to grab a kid and I killed him he said and a lion run up and grabbed another I caught him by the whiskers and slayed him he said and the core that helped me to kill the bearded lion won't he much more give this uncircumcised Philistine into my hands Hallelujah in the days when they say the days of Miracles has passed when they say old-time religion won't take anymore that was something for Grandpa and Grandma and they say you know this this old-fashioned thing kind of like Moana you know you're preaching the same seven times over and over you're preaching the same it will reign over and over you're preaching the same promise of a Revival over and over it sounds like an old-fashioned thing but you say listen it sounds like something for Grandma and Grandpa brother I'm glad tonight that there is some witnesses of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost sky blue sin killing religion that kills out the very nature and the adamic powers of the devil and your heart can be clean hallelujah oh a witness so oh my you know some say that people are too noisy why they got something to be noisy about now you tell me if the God I serve is the same yesterday today and forever and brought his people out yesterday you don't think I ought to be jumping and shouting and rejoicing because it's the same yesterday today and forever so I have something to be be happy about to be shouting about to be praising and worshiping about and Thanksgiving and blessing his name because he's the same now listen I'll prove to you that the Bible religion has always been noisy yes and you know this one God told job where was you when job thought he was a great man you know you know where was you when I laid the foundation of the world someone the other day said brother Billy are you still preaching some of that new kind of religion you got he said no sir I'm preaching the oldest religion there ever was the only one that really is and got salvation in it some of that that new kind you said we didn't have that here a few years ago he said let me tell you brother it's older than the world is you know before the world was framed it was there that's right where was you when I lay the foundation out of the world when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy [Applause] amen millions of years before the foundation of the worldly man that's right that that that is what a witness does a witness was there so when God asked Joe where were you he was there so he is a real witness of what's taking place you know so so I highlighted at that level of faith is different it's not it's not the unconscious one that's the one true personal experience and I give you the illustration with the gym because when you start in the gym it may seem very simple you go and and by the way I'm not a gym guy at all but you go and you walk and you walk you walk but see you three years from now you're not walking anymore you're living you're doing curls or bench press or whatever the terms are you're doing the big things you're lifting up things that other folks will watch and see well who how is she doing that boy but you see it's training it's practice test it's personal experience now if I sit on the sidelines and say you know what punch you can live 100 pounds and you say yeah that don't make me laugh 100 pounds if I don't go in the gym if I don't practice I will never be able to do so which is why later on and hope to get to it he will say faith without works is dead so you can believe you have to do it I could watch it and say if you could do it I can that's words you know right unless action goes along with that or behind it [Applause] so so sometimes I say there are different levels of Faith different types of Faith this one I want to call faith based on the experience of others and it may seem contradictory to what I say before but it's different types understand me it's not better than or worse than but it's different types the same way you say you would bless different people according to their measure so so different persons they have a different gift it doesn't make it better or worse but it's different so we appreciate them all so in this case there is faith that could be could be built through the experience of others so we're not discounting that right so listen in a message faith without works is dead hear what he said talking about Divine Healing he said and Divine Healing is it isn't saying a few mystery words over somebody and hypnotizing it's the truth revealed through Jesus Christ his Divine Healing that's what it is that's right gifts of the Spirit are brought down to edify or other words it's a flag of flying over the top of the building it's the appearance of the outsider attract people in out of the rain see what I mean now gifts come from God they are from God they'll testify of God and God will testify of them is that true if you are sick pray until you believe in all your heart did you ever just pray for something just know what node you are going to get it that's Faith you know let me give you a personal testimony right here and brother Anthony is a witness as well you know this evening I came home and for some strange reason I I do get headaches at all I told my wife I said listen I have the worst headache ever I said I don't know what it is I have a headache I have a headache no it's so bad my lack of headaches that I do take pills for headaches I do have tablets for headaches right so I do get them at all but this evening whole evening for two three hours straight after so I told her son I'm going up to church early I said because I have a headache now mind you are just trying to be contrary and opposite to what what is expected I haven't I had it so I dress early and I said I'm coming up early because I have a headache I reach up to church and I still have a headache and I say you know what as I'm coming up I got some let's refer to it as negative news some something that should throw more for a little bit I say you know what God is good I have a headache I see this but you know what bless God anyhow we're going to do this came up Anthony came and you heard me play and and brother Anthony said you know how things different things look I say about it to me I said listen if you know I have to lose headache right now I have a real terrible headache he asked me so you take tablets if I say no I say listen here's what's going on I said no matter what I say I feel you know there's no way things could just stuck I see I'm just watching them stuck when I see the negativity stuck when I see the bad and I was really upset and I know this is not normal I am in church every Wednesday and no headache I'm in church on Sundays no headache I say something had I had a break or something had to be special something had to be different you know I came up here and played and while playing I decided to sing you know my head they're gone gone clean before I reach up here I had it gone at one point I forgot I had a headache I forgot I came up with a headache part of that part of that is belief that listen Nothing Gonna Stop Me tonight you know nothing is going to stop this word from coming forward [Music] [Applause] knock me down but I get them back up you're knocking me to the side but I'm bouncing back no matter how bad I feel how upset I get what go wrong I said listen not tonight or No not tonight Nothing is Stopping me tonight from doing what I set out to do whatever God has predestinated for tonight must be accomplished it's not by my might not by power but by his Spirit nothing is going to stop his word nothing is going to stop your faith from growing and billing and being able to reach out and and hold on to the promises of God Amen oh my Lord you may have your seats you know I just want to to run down a little bit more you know as he spoke about praying you know see you're just pre-prey until until you know that you know it's going to happen you say that's Faith why are you praying for deliverance imagine that you're praying to be healed you know you're not feeling well you know you're not sick you know your condition at home I don't know but you know it and you're praying you know why you pray you pray because you believe God God is going to intervene he's going to bypass your neighbor to come into your home to come into your heart to come into your house into your scenario into your situation you may think you know what I might be lonely I might be small I might be simple but you see the God I serve is so mighty he's so big he could watch out and see and listen he's attracted to Faith but a brand new moments or often times on the healing line you know he would he would stand on the outside and you say you know what you don't need to be on the platform and while speaking here he will say you know what stand up you're just healed right what what caused that kind of fate that could pull the Holy Spirit to you is the same yesterday Faith to Dear Faith forever fate that's what we want to build that's that's what you want to exercise you want to exercise your faith you want to exercise this gift that God has given you this sense that you have to reach out and and we read it earlier in Hebrews 11 verse 1 the substance of things hoped for evidence of things that are not seen so so imagine no one never saw rain before rain never fell but he believed the word of God that's what he stood on you know he stood on the word of God it was not secondhand experience it was God told me Abraham was the same we call him the father of faith God Almighty he said listen I will return to you according to the time of life and we heard it last Sunday how much years he waited and years upon years upon years and and he didn't see Generations yet and and and as it progressed you will understand that listen the Fate was not feeling you know this fate wasn't you know what yeah what happened good today today is Wednesday middle of the week week on what's done no it wasn't afternoon it was a belief deep down in your heart that nothing could shaken nothing could move so when you stand on that when those old Saints stood and praying and those apostles were in prison they prayed and they prayed and they prayed they prayed only more without cease and you know why because they knew because they served was able to deliver the god they served was able to to break the bands of of death and hell and Grave so what what is a physical prison that was nothing to the power of God so their Fair true experience could be so mature so writing so strengthened that they could just execute and activate it almost instantaneously at will [Applause] you know I just want to shift a little bit because I know time is running Glory we talk about we talk about faith and you know it's such a powerful thing to think that he come in looking for this thing he's not coming to ask if you're tired much in your clothes or what was your fashion sense and and how how dramatic things were in 2023 or if you came to church the Wednesday after Carnival what he wants to know is listen do you do you stand on my word do you believe me do you have such a level of belief that it goes beyond everybody else in my family choosing to stay home tonight or or this this this thing seems like too much for me to endure he want to see the effort he want to see how much you really interested in getting this thing think about it Abraham had options you know after a year or two he gonna walk away and say but you see this thing I tried this good thing yes I try to sing I I wait one year I will two years but keep in mind we're talking about building faith to be able to unlock the promises of God we haven't even fully explored the promises of God but when you think that that God through Malachi 4 left promises open in this spoken word for his end time bride that we have to by faith reach out and grab and claim to be our own we need to have this strength we need to have the fortitude we need to have the ability to reach out and claim that and make it ours and make it ours today not tomorrow not not you know that was back then he preached about that that was back then you see if that was the approach we wouldn't be able to read the scriptures we read today because when you think about the prophet Isaiah prophesied on and for about 400 years nothing happened think about that what kind of feet these wise men had to know that you know what almighty God promise that this predestinated time send us sign so Messiah could be born in a particular place that they are willing to leave their land from the East and travels such a far distance just to know that that is the manifestation of God's word they had a awesome level of faith and and this is not just a harp on the fact that different people all over the place had Faith because ultimately we are challenged as individuals that build our faith to ensure that we as individuals could claim our promises because I mean I I I I I know sometimes they call it spoiler alert when when you know you're kind of making the obvious real to everybody before you can see it so I just want to give you a spoiler alert God not come in foreign or if you're skirt about a foot below your knee you are the ones are looking for that wasn't his requirement you know just like in Moses days when you say listen put me to where Solomon commitment but I find Faith would I find people who you know just have a former godliness they just like to come to church because it looks good and it makes them feel good because they perhaps retired and have nowhere else to go so if they come to the Tabernacle they will at least look like the ending the in the group they in the crew know these people had such a a a confidence in God's word that they could rest their faith on his word and walk away knowing if it take two days ten days two months 20 years 25 years it doesn't matter because I have such a faith that he could deliver me out of the the the the belly of the whale out of the fiery furnace from the Lion's Den I've seen examples of the past that I could stand upon right so outside of your unconscious feet which you have on the inside God shows that listen there are things you could do to build your feet you know so so when you read God's word what do you think you're doing practice in English you could do that too but it's your linear Faith because faith comes by hearing and hearing Heidi right so when you come to church what do you think you're doing signing up your your at a social Gathering you know there are some some folks that go to the bank not because they have money in the bank but because their friends just go for pension and things so they lime around the bank no this is not what God has called you have to do you know God has really called you to train you we heard even on Sunday you say you don't go medical school to come out as a student you know you'll go medical school to become a doctor you don't go law school to say whatever I went alone school for 10 years listen boy I extend my project my project I drag it out you know no that's not the purpose of going you go to law school so when we come become word of God day in day out Sunday Wednesday Friday Tuesday we hear exhortation testimonies messages we listen to our team we preach life however come that is meant to really build your faith build your confidence in the word of God nothing man nothing me not in the pastor no you have to have confidence in the past say yes but the word of God is what you stand upon so your faith is built on that is hinge or not is resting on that amen now in a message keeps it to the door he says I know Jesus as he daughter all things and faith is a key that unlocks our door you know I call his faith faith through knowledge and understanding because you know it have the Fate where yeah yeah I believe I believe yeah I believe but God sometimes calls you to a little more than that she said no Jesus is a daughter all things and faith is the key that unlocks our door now if Jesus is the door to all these promises of God which is where are we going now fit in his finish worked on locks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God see it let me read that once more now Jesus is a door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now if Jesus is a daughter all these promises of God faith in his Finnish work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside kingdom of God see it Kia's faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does that in his Finnish work it's these keys that we're speaking on now in Hebrews 11 chapter I got a great string of them wrote down there as you know that's a that's a chapter where we describe the Heroes of Faith and he says it was the key to the door that stopped the mouth of lions it was a key thing that unlocked the prison houses it was a faith the key of faith that quenched the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword brought the dead back to life again it was the fear the key of faith and the Living God that hand that man that woman who can take the key of Faith they can unlock every promise God make but you haven't got that key you're just frogging you'll never unlock it you'll beat against it if you haven't got that key you're wasting time because you're just knocking against the door you're just banging against the door any correct made key has levers on the inside of the lock and it takes a certain form a certain shape of them keys to turn those levers and just one little lever out of the way will mess the whole thing up therefore I believe in the Full Gospel every word of God that turns the power of God loose that turns his Blessing to the people it's the key to the door that unlocks it oh those great Heroes those prophets and great men of the Bible they had that key that's the reason they could stop them out of lions quench violence of fire escape the edge of the sword bring the dead back to life again and do all kind of Miracles is because they held that key and they know that work because it was a scripture born key so that's what I was getting at before it was a scripture born key this is not your own thoughts and ideas this is not the mindset of man and you feel to tell a story and you feel this and you feel this is not about feelings this is about the word of God this is about God's living written word that you could read and develop and you could see that strength in your face and continue to build your faith I'm almost done I'm not going to keep you long at all you know there's a there's a message where Brian preached called the second miracle and this is exactly where I started he said you know some people has great big feet like this anything can happen the next has faith that deep takes a little longer the next recipe that deep takes quite a little while some has fit like a mustard seed but if it's a Mustard Seed Faith genuine Faith hold on to it just keep believing it it'll become marble faith then it'll become grapefruit Faith then it'll become Mountain fate it'll bring you right out if you just stay with it hold on to it it'll bring you right straight to the light if you'll stay with it you know what I call this I call this Faith through patience it's easy to get distracted it's easy to get this tubed it's easy to be thrown off but sometimes you have to keep your eye on the target keep your eye on the prize when God say it will rain it took 120 years it was easy for somebody after five years to say Noah yeah we're going on we believe you know yeah let's preach real good they're preaching the same thing for five years but instead of a boot we have a different idea what if we build a big house that could rule everybody that wasn't the commission that God had given his feet was resting on the word of God and the promise of God to him so he had to stay focused on listen God said so God Said So no matter what the external voices say no matter what the detractors say no matter what the neighbor said it might be a good friend or your family your relative you know but he had to stay focused he had to have patience he had to run this race knowing that the race wasn't for the swiftest that this fate base race was one that was hinged to patience and he had to hold on knowing that God who was faithful to to make this promise was more than able to deliver and bring it to pass you know so no matter the example you use you will see sometimes and he identified here he says some people feel big some people like you would often hear they come you want to be healed and you're healed instantaneously and Barbara also talks about time of span Miracles huh sometimes you have to wait a little bit sometimes you have to be tested a little bit sometimes you have to be I call it tortured a little bit some people either talk about you to say listen you still believe that you know a hundred years past I know I still believe a good Henry no no generation after generation you're going on to three generations and he's still preaching the same thing you know but you know what he's the same yesterday today and forever his promises are still the same and they never fail it's up to us I would Loosely say as a church but directly as individuals to build our faith to be able to grab a hole and catch a hole of all he promises he sets out and lay out for us you know it's not even my nose but I remember reading it earlier I believe it's in fear to the substance and brother Branham said you know there's a scripture that Jesus said hear what Greater Works and these shall ye do because I go unto my father right sure we know it you're students of the Bible huh and he went on to explain that this greater is not better than Christ you know you say because we as individuals as humans as mere mortals we can do and or do Christ we can all do his works right so it's not a matter of competing with God it's not a matter of competing with Christ but you know what he said he said when you look at Christ's life Christ had a very very specific time period to do all his miracles very very specific right from here to here if you say from 18 to 30 it was it was a period of silence and you walk with them for three and a half years so he had this period to do all the Miracles that we could speak of now he said but you know when the scripture said greater than thee shall ye do he say if you look at the original translation for greater it wasn't better it wasn't it it was more advanced but he said it referred to more more in quantity so I tell you that to inspire to uplift to build to motivate because when you think about it we look at Jesus in awe and say he healed sick and he raised it dead and lucky cause he blind to see and look he he did this and he did that and that Creator but imagine in your life now he gave you a promise that you could do more than that so we're not talking about raise one person more yeah we are talking about heal one sick person more not deliver one child that going astray more right he listened at Italian beginning my God is so mighty what a mighty God we serve that he gave us a promise that listen in this time in this season in this hour in this age you're gonna see more and more and more but to catch a hole like that you can't use it the itty-bitty fit you need to be able to build your feet on different levels to ensure that you could grab a hold of everything that is for you I don't know about you but like Caleb said give me my Mountain it seems selfish but he had to look after his interests at that point in in other words you are saying I'm not leaving this alone I want all and that's the attitude I want you to leave here with tonight that listen if healing is yours you need to claim healing tonight you want all you don't want to leave some of your children in the world and some of them in church you want all like when Moses was leaving Egypt and and faith and if you return to them and say listen take your cattle Take A Flock you see them fig tree or plants move it up too take everything take defense take a pose take the pillar take the foundation move it everything he said not one listen Moses said not one hope should be left behind we don't want to leave somebody limping no we're taking everything all is yours all should be taken all the land listen the hentai's the jeopard society amorites no matter who was squatting before you want to come with an order this is an order from the court listen he signed this declaration for you you could go in now with authority listen listen yeah I just want to make it clear you know some sometimes in Trinidad there are some persons that they they believe their budgets they will come and they plant a structure here and they say they live in here state land they're squatting another debating land tonight but they say that squatting that's barge on business God nothing badge on business God said listen look to the east to the West the North and the South the boundary here the course on this side listen from the back here as far as I could see till I reached the river as a matter of fact go across the river that is what I leave for you so I want to possess that your car just run out and say hey move move move move because you will get yourself in problems God is a god of order he is a good Commander he's a good fighter so he he believes in structure right so he said listen what I want you to do I want you to be trained I want to be disciplined I want you to be fortified so when you go out I'm not giving her the whole picture but I want you to go out with the not not knowledge that I'm supporting you that are giving him master plan the master plan may not be in the kind of detail that you prefer but you had to walk you had a step you have to conquer and when you conquer this your friends set her wrong so nobody else should come back here you have to cut and maintain fight and maintain battle and maintain so you're not going to lose ground you know you want to take two steps even if the devil push your back a little bit you're still pressing forward you want to do that over and over why because he promised more more greater than these shall you do so your faith must be lifted to such a level that when the son of man cometh he gonna find faith in you he's gonna find your fit matured and active not dormant and a lion dog and a poor sister come out to service no no no no no no no no no no no you know listen like Simeon Simeon was to say no no Simeon had a promise Simeon believed that listen I will not see death till I see the Lord's Christ so he is not staying home hoping that you know what I will hear about it perhaps when they make the announcements they will dedicate a baby and the next service I will come no he not waiting or not he's standing by the temple day in day out night in night out having faith that God who promised this is able to manifest it in his time in his life amen so he not come in for a group listen listen I wrote this one down and I want to read it listen he not doing an audit of how much books and tips you have home right he not checking how many how many on the lines or highlighters you're right through the Bible right that's not what you're checking he's not concerned about if if you're two hours early or three hours early because you could have a form of godliness think about it but denying the very power denying the faith because you think you could figure it out so you want to sit down and judge you want to sit down and Mark your own papers you want to sit down and do it like as much like as an exact science and you say listen if that's what what you're doing you don't need me you gotta work it out because he promised to supply everything you need not your wants and what you think and your thoughts and your ideas by faith he will supply every need you have think about it he said according to the riches in glory how much riches do you think he have I I could assure you I never check it but Elon Musk compared to my God hero Ali kind of resources my God half my God could provide anything I need anything you need you're not selfish either so it's not if he Supply it's a me you know Supply it's a brother Anthony no he have enough he have enough to go around and are wrong and a wrong think about the Miracles of Christ when that little boy had Five Loaves and two fish it seemed like a simple thing it seemed like a little thing but you know what that's an Act of Faith he said listen bring it bring it bring it bring it bring it bring it bring it which goes to show you say even by the brown highlighted you say you know sometimes you have to do something for something to happen so you tell your stand up and accept your healing you know do something don't just sit down and relax so you say bring the Five Loaves and two fish bring it let me see it because you have it there is just a meal to you but in my hands I believe fate I believe you will see the miracle in Frontier he said bring it bless it take give give share partake enjoy relax and when you're done clean up too because I promise you more more more more above and beyond what you can even ask or think listen I'm talking exceedingly abundantly above all you can ask or think you know not not what in your mind and your finite mind believe he is going to supply the rent for this month no he could give you a house and more than that he could give you a land he could give you a car he could give you Estates he said listen a wise man leaves a hair an inheritance or his children's children he could bless you above and beyond don't think it's a small thing you know he say ask God for big things and have faith that he is faithful to supply it all the time God bless you he will definitely strengthen and build your fear to unlock all the promises he has amen may God richly bless you [Applause] Oh Glory can we give the Lord praise tonight Hallelujah oh give him glory
