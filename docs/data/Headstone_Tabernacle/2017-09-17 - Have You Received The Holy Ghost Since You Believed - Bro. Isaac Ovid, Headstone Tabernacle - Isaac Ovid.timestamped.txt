[54:30] service how many appreciated you service
[54:32] yesterday for those who were here Amen I
[54:36] certainly want to thank all young people
[54:37] who made the effort to come out and for
[54:39] the kaleb's who were here as well and
[54:41] for those who could not be here
[54:45] yesterday I trust you have a good you
[54:49] know the BIOS is about giving an account
[54:50] I trust you'll be able to give an
[54:53] account to the Lord for why you were not
[54:57] here yesterday and it's coming to that
[54:59] kind of a time people don't want to be
[55:02] held accountable but the Bible says you
[55:04] have to give an account you know in the
[55:08] natural when you're not in work and
[55:10] you're not there for a day or two you're
[55:12] supposed to walk with a sick leave
[55:14] signed by a doctor to really make sure
[55:17] you're ready
[55:18] the truth is unfortunate that the nature
[55:20] of human behavior has forced measures
[55:23] like that and for some reason people
[55:24] think that church and the kingdom of God
[55:27] operates by a different set of rules and
[55:29] in fact we operate by a higher order a
[55:32] higher set of rules so I said young
[55:35] people yesterday that we are ramping
[55:37] things up and we took our inspiration
[55:40] and maybe I'll just touch it quickly on
[55:45] what the theme of our youth services for
[55:49] the remaining year and if IDs see for
[55:52] the foreseeable future will be promised
[55:55] on 2nd Peter 1 you don't have to find it
[55:58] where Simon Peter is speaking and he
[56:01] says Simon Peter a servant and an
[56:04] apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[56:06] have obtained like precious faith with
[56:08] us through the righteousness of God and
[56:11] our Savior Jesus Christ so he's
[56:12] addressing a certain kind of people not
[56:14] every and anybody but there might have
[56:16] obtained like precious faith with us
[56:18] through the righteousness of God and our
[56:21] Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[56:23] multiplied unto you through the
[56:25] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[56:27] according as his divine power have given
[56:30] unto us all things that pertain unto
[56:34] life and godliness unto life and
[56:38] godliness and we were speaking to the
[56:40] young people of that balance between
[56:42] life and godliness
[56:45] months ago we had a theme where the
[56:47] young people speaking about between
[56:48] Sunday's where we come to service on a
[56:51] Sunday but there's Monday Tuesday
[56:53] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and
[56:55] God is interested in not just your
[56:58] attendance in church and what happens in
[57:00] a Sunday or Wednesday or prayer meeting
[57:02] all your service but he's interested in
[57:04] every area of your life he's interested
[57:06] in what happens between Sunday's but the
[57:09] Apostle Peter is saying that according
[57:11] as his divine power had given unto us
[57:14] all things that pertain unto life
[57:16] and godliness so God doesn't just want
[57:19] to see you spiritually bless them and
[57:22] spiritually as an overcomer but in life
[57:24] also you ought to have a testimony you
[57:27] cannot be as depressed as those in the
[57:29] world because depression is not your
[57:31] inheritance if your testimony is that
[57:33] you are depressed as those in the world
[57:35] there's something wrong because we have
[57:37] been given all things but healing on
[57:39] support godliness and to live life on
[57:41] this earth until we are taken from him
[57:43] we ought to be happy whether it's in our
[57:47] job or in the church or on the street
[57:49] all things but in the light and
[57:51] godliness has been given to us the rules
[57:54] of business can be found in the
[57:56] scripture the rules of success can be
[57:58] found in the scripture because in this
[58:01] has everything but in it a life and to
[58:04] godliness can the church Shaymin we have
[58:09] for too long been living on our
[58:10] god-given privilege both in the natural
[58:13] and in the spiritual and it's the time
[58:15] has come for us to take our position in
[58:18] God can the church see amen
[58:20] but we went even deeper than that
[58:22] yesterday and we took a scripture that I
[58:24] just read in proverbs 4 and verse 23 to
[58:28] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[58:32] out of it are the issues of life and if
[58:36] you talk to anybody they tell you I have
[58:38] issues
[58:39] who doesn't have issues everybody has
[58:42] some issue that I deal o it being a
[58:44] financial issue a mental issue a
[58:46] challenge a child issuer a job-related
[58:49] issuer issue it with waking up late in
[58:52] the morning an issue and with not eating
[58:53] the right things that all kinds of
[58:55] issues but the Bible says guard your
[58:58] heart or keep your heart with all
[59:01] diligence for out of it are the issues
[59:04] of life and we see the young people the
[59:09] heart is a ground and the heart as a
[59:12] ground doesn't discriminate
[59:14] with what seed you plant the role of the
[59:17] heart of the ground is to bring to life
[59:19] whatever seed is there
[59:22] so whatever seed you plant in your heart
[59:25] you're harder to say I don't want the
[59:27] seed the hearts job is to bring the sea
[59:30] to life but yet the Bible says guard
[59:35] your heart
[59:36] keep your heart protect your heart
[59:39] because out of your heart stems the
[59:41] issues of life every issue of life is
[59:45] coming from what's inside of your heart
[59:49] so I asked young people a question if
[59:52] you have a feel and in that feel you
[59:54] plant and that feel is a good feeling
[59:56] whatever you plant it grows up and
[59:58] blossom wouldn't you want to protect
[59:59] that field would you want to guard that
[1:00:02] field so what would you do you put a
[1:00:04] fence right now but I said to the young
[1:00:06] people if you put a fence all the way
[1:00:08] around how will you get to the pit how
[1:00:10] will you get to the field you have to
[1:00:12] create a kit and it's the same way
[1:00:15] there's a gate to your heart so if you
[1:00:18] have to guard your heart you have to
[1:00:21] mine what passes through that gate so I
[1:00:25] asked young people what other get to the
[1:00:29] heart
[1:00:29] what's the access way to the heart what
[1:00:33] allows things to go into your heart and
[1:00:35] we hear the statements the eyes are the
[1:00:37] windows to the soul and what you see is
[1:00:41] what goes into your heart what you
[1:00:43] listen to is what feeds your heart what
[1:00:46] you see T is touch expressed that is
[1:00:48] what affects your heart again your heart
[1:00:51] doesn't discriminate
[1:00:52] but what see this book it will only
[1:00:54] bring to life what you put in your heart
[1:00:58] so if you take in seeds that lead to
[1:01:01] jealousy
[1:01:02] both of your heart will come issues that
[1:01:05] are tied to jealousy if you listen to
[1:01:08] worldly music then the issues begin to
[1:01:11] change because this is not just don't
[1:01:13] listen to worldly music but music is a
[1:01:15] seed that when it comes onto that ground
[1:01:18] of your heart will bring forth something
[1:01:22] what you look at in the newspaper if you
[1:01:26] watch a TV show whatever it is you
[1:01:28] allowed to pass through that get the Hat
[1:01:31] receives it because the heart is just a
[1:01:35] ground and everything is gonna bring
[1:01:38] forth after its kind so I challenge
[1:01:43] young people and I challenge the church
[1:01:45] this morning to guard your heart with
[1:01:47] all diligence with everything that's
[1:01:51] within you because out of that heart
[1:01:53] comes the issues of life everything that
[1:01:58] is expressed can be traced to a
[1:02:00] beginning everything that happens has of
[1:02:03] course is a seed where it all began and
[1:02:06] if you find yourself out of the spirit
[1:02:10] doing what you're not supposed to be
[1:02:12] doing you can come back to the seed
[1:02:14] where it all started
[1:02:16] they say that a butterfly can flap its
[1:02:18] wings somewhere in Africa or wherever
[1:02:21] and it starts a hurricane because it's
[1:02:24] cause and effect and I believe it's
[1:02:26] where the Gideon was seeing in a youth
[1:02:27] service that our plane it could be one
[1:02:30] degree off but by the time it dry it
[1:02:33] flies for an hour - it's so far another
[1:02:36] continent so it's a small thing that you
[1:02:39] have to guard your heart against can the
[1:02:42] church say man so just for a few minutes
[1:02:46] I want to talk about this God in your
[1:02:49] heart and I introduced a story that I
[1:02:53] read to the young people and it really
[1:02:56] blessed me and I pray that it will bless
[1:02:57] you as well and there was a flight I
[1:03:04] believe somewhere in Europe and the
[1:03:07] Christian businessman was on the flight
[1:03:09] and he was in first class and as he got
[1:03:12] into the first-class cabin the air
[1:03:14] hostess offered him a drink
[1:03:17] complimentary drink an alcoholic drink
[1:03:19] and he politely refused he said no I am
[1:03:24] NOT interested as he moves towards his
[1:03:27] seat a hostess goes to the manager and
[1:03:29] says this guy doesn't want to drink
[1:03:31] maybe we didn't present it right
[1:03:32] so she comes back and brings a drink now
[1:03:35] on a platter and says sir it's it's a
[1:03:38] public man she drink you're flying for
[1:03:40] this class for this class's expensive
[1:03:42] seating this is coming you don't have to
[1:03:43] pay for it it it's on the house he says
[1:03:45] no I am NOT interested in the drink she
[1:03:49] goes back against in a manager the
[1:03:51] manager says send it back one more time
[1:03:53] and they bring it back now with flowers
[1:03:57] on the platter because they're thinking
[1:03:59] that it's their problem and the way they
[1:04:01] are presenting it as why is refusing it
[1:04:03] them the manager comes and he says to
[1:04:05] her listen I am NOT interested in this
[1:04:08] drink because I'm a Christian and I
[1:04:10] don't drink alcohol
[1:04:12] so the hostess couldn't understand it he
[1:04:15] says yes what before I take it if you
[1:04:19] want me to take it give this drink first
[1:04:21] study pilot and the air hostess
[1:04:25] responded how I could do that he's on
[1:04:27] duty if he drinks he will kick a crash
[1:04:30] the plane and that man sturdy I say
[1:04:34] exactly right he's on duty and I'm also
[1:04:38] on duty
[1:04:39] I'm on duty for the kingdom of God and
[1:04:43] if I drink that I will crash my life and
[1:04:47] I took a team of young people always on
[1:04:50] duty because as Christians we have to be
[1:04:53] always of duty there is no vacation from
[1:04:57] this Christian thing there is no time
[1:04:59] off from this Christian thing there's
[1:05:01] not taking a day off I come in and lead
[1:05:04] on this Christian thing we are always on
[1:05:06] duty
[1:05:07] we are duty on Monday on Tuesday on
[1:05:10] Saturday on something on every day we
[1:05:13] are always on duty and the church say
[1:05:15] man
[1:05:19] Joshua's on duty was in that right he
[1:05:22] was there sharpening and sword if he was
[1:05:23] housekeeping I was in duty when he
[1:05:25] injured a captain the Lord was come he
[1:05:28] was going to be ready but it moment he
[1:05:29] heard a noise
[1:05:30] he tried sword first ask questions after
[1:05:33] because he was on duty he was taking
[1:05:35] chances and that's why you gotta guard
[1:05:38] your heart because you have to always be
[1:05:40] on duty because out of your heart comes
[1:05:46] the issues of life can the church say
[1:05:50] men the issues of life guard your heart
[1:05:58] the issues of life lost and fornication
[1:06:01] and these issues of life are directly
[1:06:04] connected the seeds that you saw when
[1:06:09] you lose the desire to come to the house
[1:06:12] of God it's because a seed has been
[1:06:13] planted that takes away that desire
[1:06:19] something else is more important where
[1:06:23] is your job when it's put the perception
[1:06:25] of success or whatever it is it's other
[1:06:28] sees that are taking hold of your heart
[1:06:30] and they will grow because that's what
[1:06:32] the heart is supposed so I challenge you
[1:06:37] Church be conscious that you are always
[1:06:40] on duty I give the analogy that there
[1:06:44] are many professions police officers
[1:06:46] soldiers doctors who are on-call and
[1:06:51] when you are on call as a doctor it
[1:06:53] simply means that even if you are not on
[1:06:56] location they can call you at any time
[1:06:59] to respond to her situation and that's
[1:07:02] how you ought to be as a Christian it
[1:07:05] can be you're trying to get into the
[1:07:08] spirit it must be that you are in the
[1:07:11] spirit it can be I listen they call you
[1:07:14] money let me pray first no you are
[1:07:16] supposed to be prayed up that's what it
[1:07:18] means to be on duty
[1:07:20] the song leader should not to say get in
[1:07:23] the spirit now because you are on duty
[1:07:25] you are walking in the spirit because
[1:07:28] you are on duty you are you are the
[1:07:31] revival because you're on duty if nobody
[1:07:34] else wanna shout you are Sultan because
[1:07:37] your relationship is with God it has
[1:07:39] nothing to do it who's next to you what
[1:07:42] happened this morning what happened last
[1:07:44] night what it does not matter because
[1:07:46] you are duty he can call you at any time
[1:07:49] a situation happens you just say let us
[1:07:53] pray you have to wonder if you're
[1:07:54] pregnant again answer because you know
[1:07:56] your heart is right with God because you
[1:07:58] are always on duty that's why in the
[1:08:04] army they have soldiers training all the
[1:08:06] time so that when the war comes you know
[1:08:09] there's some Swiss who never go to war
[1:08:11] but you know what it doesn't stop the
[1:08:13] training going on because they need to
[1:08:16] be ready just in case they have to go
[1:08:17] and fight the crappity last time I
[1:08:19] pushed I was five years ago you gotta
[1:08:22] call this month you gotta fight you know
[1:08:23] try to do one push-up two push-ups treat
[1:08:26] it's not gonna work but you have to be
[1:08:28] always on duty so that no matter what
[1:08:32] unity comes with you could take care of
[1:08:33] it can the church say Amen so young
[1:08:40] people and the church mark your
[1:08:42] calendars October the 21st will be our
[1:08:45] next youth service and it is a youth
[1:08:48] oriented service the entire church is
[1:08:51] welcomed and I said to the young people
[1:08:54] we have a responsibility that you have
[1:08:57] to be ready according to scripture to
[1:08:59] give an answer so what is the hope of
[1:09:02] your calling it can be somebody asked
[1:09:05] why you are just way why are you a
[1:09:06] Christian and you tell them come to
[1:09:08] church and find out no you supposed to
[1:09:09] be the give an answer that's what the
[1:09:11] Bible says be ready to give an answer
[1:09:13] and that word answer in the Greek is the
[1:09:15] word apologia
[1:09:16] which means a reason defense which means
[1:09:19] you're not just food to say well I love
[1:09:20] God it mean you need to be able to
[1:09:22] explain what happened to you
[1:09:24] that my life was changed and I met
[1:09:27] somebody I never
[1:09:29] my-my-my amnesia was lifted
[1:09:32] I was chatting everybody when I realized
[1:09:35] I was a Eagle among chickens I when I
[1:09:37] got the eagle - eagle call something's
[1:09:39] telling my soul I can't put it all into
[1:09:42] a bullet but if you can hear the
[1:09:43] excitement I have my updates and
[1:09:45] openness but one of these things not
[1:09:47] always me up because I'm going to a
[1:09:49] place where there are no updates have no
[1:09:51] foundation I'm going to a place where
[1:09:53] there's no sickness have no depression
[1:09:55] I'm I'm going to a place where whenever
[1:09:57] I speak something has got to happen and
[1:10:00] the good news is before that time comes
[1:10:03] when I speak here is gonna happen
[1:10:05] because that's my promise and my family
[1:10:08] might be in trouble but I'm not worried
[1:10:10] about it because it's a power coming
[1:10:12] into the church when one sons fell so to
[1:10:16] speak and what this she will be created
[1:10:20] that's what we are talking about a
[1:10:22] judgement power a judgment glory a
[1:10:25] charge when he anointed a church on fire
[1:10:28] for God within these videos who are not
[1:10:32] afraid to separate themselves from the
[1:10:34] world there are no more excuses no more
[1:10:39] excuses you may be seated
[1:10:44] I'm not preaching it we're gonna get to
[1:10:48] the service in a minute I was saying to
[1:10:52] the young people the world is changing
[1:10:53] in this very own country of ours for
[1:10:56] years the energy sector and oil and gas
[1:10:59] was the mainstay of the economy but that
[1:11:02] was before electric cars
[1:11:03] that was before solar panels became more
[1:11:06] common that was before wind power and
[1:11:08] alternative energy started to become
[1:11:11] more popular and as man progresses they
[1:11:14] will find new and innovative we used to
[1:11:16] do things and in me that the jobs that
[1:11:18] you could have had years ago with no
[1:11:20] longer a pie in the new world
[1:11:23] the one constant that his will has is
[1:11:25] change so there's no reason to be sad or
[1:11:29] sorry for yourself because the
[1:11:31] successful people in the future will be
[1:11:33] those who have adapted to the changes
[1:11:35] who haven't adapted to what's happening
[1:11:38] and with the pranam he bridge he said
[1:11:40] there was the horse and buggy day he
[1:11:42] didn't miss anything there was the cows
[1:11:44] then he said it was the aeroplanes
[1:11:45] anything it was the rocket he's here man
[1:11:47] is making progress but he said the
[1:11:49] churches was a laid-back understeer with
[1:11:52] the old thing and not make any spiritual
[1:11:55] progress when we ought to be way of the
[1:11:57] road we ought to have spiritual
[1:11:59] astronauts there are scientists who can
[1:12:03] mix the chemicals together to create the
[1:12:05] right reaction because when you mix
[1:12:08] certain things together certain things
[1:12:10] begin to happen you can sit down in the
[1:12:13] church and hope somebody mix for you you
[1:12:15] better get a mixin the chemicals for
[1:12:18] your house you better get some mixing or
[1:12:22] you don't hear me this morning it's time
[1:12:25] to get up and get it's time because the
[1:12:28] Bible says the kingdom suffered violence
[1:12:31] and the violent take it by force
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:39] you may be seated I'm gonna preach in a
[1:12:42] minute but I want to get something to
[1:12:44] you there's no revival without sacrifice
[1:12:47] there is no victory without sacrifice
[1:12:49] the same way in the natural is the same
[1:12:52] thing in the spiritual listen the pastor
[1:12:56] gave us a book to read things that are
[1:12:58] to be and in that message if you listen
[1:13:01] to it but the Branham was saying that
[1:13:04] everything on it is a shadow it's a type
[1:13:07] of what exists somewhere else he said so
[1:13:10] if there's a tree that struggling on
[1:13:12] earth it means that there's somewhere
[1:13:14] else there's a tree that's not
[1:13:16] struggling he said if there's a man
[1:13:18] shake or Nestle it means that somewhere
[1:13:20] else there's no man that's not
[1:13:22] struggling there's a man that's not
[1:13:24] shake oh can I get a witness in the
[1:13:27] houses swooning
[1:13:29] do we have any believers in the house do
[1:13:32] we have any Christians in the house so
[1:13:34] to have any reward he has got to be
[1:13:37] sacrificed you may be seated
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:44] we spoke about the random piece about
[1:13:46] spiritual amnesia how the god of this
[1:13:49] evil age tries to keep us and for us to
[1:13:53] forget where we come from to forget our
[1:13:55] identity to forget that our genes come
[1:13:58] from God and even gonna keep us thinking
[1:14:01] about our problems our trials our
[1:14:03] mortgage the bills the back pain you
[1:14:06] know this is I'm gonna pee and get too
[1:14:08] much you forget yourself to do because
[1:14:10] it being takes you that's the devil's
[1:14:14] job to bring healing to bring
[1:14:16] frustration to bring depression but when
[1:14:19] you come to church it's to remind you by
[1:14:22] bringing it to a familiar place a
[1:14:24] familiar atmosphere a familiar anointing
[1:14:28] to let you know that this is what you
[1:14:30] were doing before you had a problem
[1:14:32] before you had a mortgage before you
[1:14:35] were sick this is what you were doing
[1:14:37] you were worshiping you were giving God
[1:14:40] praise you were giving God glory
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:45] you may be seated we're still having a
[1:14:49] conversation
[1:14:50] so I share with young people I said
[1:14:52] listen there is no achievement without
[1:14:54] sacrifice
[1:14:55] there is nobody nobody in the natural
[1:14:58] and in spiritual is the same law without
[1:15:01] sacrifice
[1:15:02] there is no achievement without
[1:15:03] sacrifice there is no blessing without
[1:15:06] prayer without science without fasting
[1:15:09] without crying without denying your
[1:15:12] Salva without giving up something that's
[1:15:14] what that seem to get if you want to
[1:15:18] achieve in your school you must
[1:15:20] sacrifice you're gonna give up something
[1:15:22] and spend time studying and spend time
[1:15:25] practicing to the when the exam comes up
[1:15:28] you are prepared and ready to destroy
[1:15:31] the exam that's what you got to do
[1:15:40] certain young people they are too
[1:15:43] powerful beings that get the blame for
[1:15:47] everything the devil gets the most blame
[1:15:51] because of the devil who did it and then
[1:15:54] there are those who blame God is he
[1:15:56] didn't do it so it's the devil who made
[1:15:59] me cuss em out and God and stop me from
[1:16:02] cousin and you fear to accept
[1:16:07] responsibility that you have a choice
[1:16:11] what you eat for breakfast is a choice
[1:16:14] what time you go to bed is a choice how
[1:16:17] long you pray is a choice so I said to
[1:16:19] the church if you want to lose weight
[1:16:21] you can have an all-night for a meeting
[1:16:24] about losing weight if you don't change
[1:16:27] your diet if you don't add some exercise
[1:16:31] what do you want God to do
[1:16:38] you don't want to study to pass your
[1:16:41] exams what you want to pray for God to
[1:16:43] do but it's a difference when you study
[1:16:48] and you see an Lord bring back to my
[1:16:50] memory everything that I studied because
[1:16:53] I'm a child of the king that's a
[1:16:57] different kind of Prayer so when you
[1:17:03] hear the old-fashioned Christian scene
[1:17:05] whenever I pray God answered my prayer
[1:17:07] is they understood the relationship
[1:17:09] between what God does what he has done
[1:17:13] what he will do and what you have to do
[1:17:15] so
[1:17:17] can't have said if God is with me I am
[1:17:20] more than able to drive out the fellows
[1:17:22] time even say God can you please remove
[1:17:25] remove the child's no he said the Lord
[1:17:28] is with me I will be able to drag him
[1:17:31] out myself to overcome to make it sound
[1:17:37] wants to take on the enemy in my life
[1:17:40] I'm called to take all the enemies in my
[1:17:42] family
[1:17:43] blasphemy in my house we will serve the
[1:17:46] Lord
[1:17:46] this is God's house up this is his
[1:17:49] temple this is his temple I'm gonna
[1:17:52] guard this house
[1:17:54] and the church hey man we need some more
[1:18:00] aggressive Christians we have a too easy
[1:18:07] we are too comfortable we have become
[1:18:09] too lazy I was seeing a train in China
[1:18:14] and when the train came to a stop
[1:18:17] wow if you saw the rush to get into the
[1:18:21] train if you are laid-back and you are
[1:18:25] waiting for somebody to usher you to the
[1:18:28] Train huh you will be there next morning
[1:18:30] with him for a dream ah it was an
[1:18:33] example of suffering violence and the
[1:18:36] violent take it by force women children
[1:18:39] men businessman labor oh it didn't
[1:18:42] matter
[1:18:43] Azealia one to get on board or you don't
[1:18:45] want to get on board
[1:18:46] there was a picture and I saw the train
[1:18:48] door closing and chest before the train
[1:18:50] or close a man snitching and the door
[1:18:54] just be ere it goes when he purposed in
[1:18:57] his heart I'm catching aboard this train
[1:19:00] I'm going to get home if
[1:19:05] it reminds you that a woman with the
[1:19:07] issue of blood if I could just touch the
[1:19:10] hem of his comment I'm gonna be me and a
[1:19:12] hole give me some more Christians who
[1:19:15] wants a press pass a person in front of
[1:19:17] you I'll get Piero one the blessing
[1:19:19] that's up to them but Jesus is in the
[1:19:22] house he is in the house I didn't even
[1:19:25] touch the hem of His garment
[1:19:29] you could vote
[1:19:38] but that means it what kind of message
[1:19:42] is this this morning this is the kind of
[1:19:46] message to remind you that the preacher
[1:19:48] cannot bring the revival it's the
[1:19:55] concept of this preacher bringing the
[1:19:57] revival and the preacher doing it all
[1:19:59] that created a papal system of existence
[1:20:02] remove the power from the people and put
[1:20:05] it on bishops and Archbishop's and super
[1:20:09] bishops and until there's a pope but
[1:20:13] quarter in the veil when Jesus died from
[1:20:16] top to bottom to give individuals direct
[1:20:19] access to the throne room of God to make
[1:20:23] their petitions loon and that's why the
[1:20:26] Bible can see you have not because you
[1:20:28] ask not and if you are still coming to
[1:20:31] church and I'm asking then you are
[1:20:32] wasting time but when you come to the
[1:20:34] house of God it's to remind you that
[1:20:37] you're the power to ask because when God
[1:20:39] looks at you he looks to the blood and
[1:20:41] the blood covers your sins the blood
[1:20:43] covers your mistakes of blood covers
[1:20:45] your dinners and the blood is speaking
[1:20:48] better things that you can see yourself
[1:20:50] Hamlet should see me
[1:20:52] you love Lord this morning then let's
[1:20:55] all stand offish
[1:21:02] if you have your Bibles will you turn it
[1:21:06] me to two portions of scripture reading
[1:21:09] from Matthew chapter 24 Mary from Acts
[1:21:14] chapter 19
[1:21:30] Matthew 24 verse 40 then shall two be in
[1:21:35] the field the one shall be taken and the
[1:21:41] other left two women shall be grinding
[1:21:44] at the mill the one shall be taken and
[1:21:47] the other left
[1:21:49] what's therefore for ye know not what
[1:21:52] hour your Lord doth come but know this
[1:21:56] that if the Goodman of the house had
[1:21:59] known in what watch the thief would come
[1:22:01] he would have watched and would not have
[1:22:04] suffered his house to be broken up
[1:22:07] therefore be ye also ready for in such
[1:22:11] an hour as you think not the Son of man
[1:22:14] cometh and really from Acts chapter 19
[1:22:18] reading from this one
[1:22:30] and it came to pass and while Apollo's
[1:22:32] was a Corinth Paul having passed through
[1:22:35] the upper coast came to Ephesus and
[1:22:38] finding certain disciples he said unto
[1:22:40] them how he received the Holy Ghost
[1:22:42] since he believes and he said unto Him
[1:22:45] we have not so much as heard whether
[1:22:47] there be any Holy Ghost and he said it
[1:22:50] to them unto what then we baptized and
[1:22:52] he said unto John's baptism then said
[1:22:56] paul john verily baptized with the
[1:22:59] baptism of repentance saying unto the
[1:23:01] people that they should believe on him
[1:23:03] which should come after him that is on
[1:23:05] christ jesus when they heard this they
[1:23:08] were baptized in the name of the lord
[1:23:10] jesus and when paul had laid his hands
[1:23:13] upon them the Holy Ghost came on them
[1:23:15] and they speak with tongues and
[1:23:17] prophesied made a lord at a blessing to
[1:23:20] the reading of his word he may be seated
[1:23:23] so for a title this morning have you
[1:23:27] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:23:30] believed and for a subject desperate to
[1:23:34] possess your individual inheritance and
[1:23:38] an inspiration another book of Acts so
[1:23:44] this morning we want to really hole into
[1:23:48] individuals hone into your Christian
[1:23:51] walk your Christian journey and to what
[1:23:54] you have to be expecting and what you
[1:23:57] ought to be preparing before you know
[1:24:02] but the Branum he gave an analogy he
[1:24:04] said I believe it was a turtle and he
[1:24:06] said he took a stick and tried to prod
[1:24:10] the turtle the turtle didn't move he
[1:24:11] threw something else in a turtle he
[1:24:14] didn't respond he said it's only when he
[1:24:16] took some fire and put it to the turtle
[1:24:20] the turtle legs flew out and he's had to
[1:24:21] move at his fastest speed because that
[1:24:25] is what fire does it gets you moving and
[1:24:30] it is the nature of human beings who try
[1:24:34] to get comfortable where
[1:24:36] you move to a different country moved a
[1:24:39] different neighborhood he moves a
[1:24:40] different job in whatever position you I
[1:24:42] am it's your nature to get comfortable
[1:24:44] but within the context of your spiritual
[1:24:48] journey there is no such thing as as
[1:24:49] staying comfortable
[1:24:51] you have to stay moving because you have
[1:24:54] an enemy a real enemy and this war where
[1:24:57] fighting is not a war against flesh or
[1:24:59] blood is on a war against your wife or
[1:25:01] your husband or your children or your
[1:25:03] boss so it has nothing to do with that
[1:25:04] is a spiritual war because you are under
[1:25:06] a different covenant what happens out
[1:25:09] there in the world is different from
[1:25:10] what you will experience because you are
[1:25:12] under a different covenant you are here
[1:25:15] to be tested and for a proving ground
[1:25:17] that you are not going to be the see
[1:25:19] that no matter what temptation or trial
[1:25:22] comes your way you will have a testimony
[1:25:24] that you will serve God you're not here
[1:25:27] to be a church member you're not here to
[1:25:28] be in the message you are here to have a
[1:25:30] testimony to show the world to show your
[1:25:33] family that you will serve the Lord that
[1:25:36] he is your king that is your majesty
[1:25:38] that he is your leader he is your guy he
[1:25:41] is your joy he is your peace you you
[1:25:44] look to him to keep you going you look
[1:25:46] to him to wake you up in the morning
[1:25:48] when the doctor runs out of ideas about
[1:25:50] what's wrong with you you know he knows
[1:25:52] because he made you he is your Creator
[1:25:54] he is the Great Physician
[1:25:56] he is your Chiron and that is what keeps
[1:25:59] you inspired it's all about him the
[1:26:03] moment your Christian journey loses him
[1:26:06] as your focus there's something wrong
[1:26:07] there many people Church is a ritual
[1:26:10] it's it's it's amazing it's a casual
[1:26:14] it's a thing to do it's on your to-do
[1:26:15] list so there's certain son need and I
[1:26:18] have to compete bill on Monday and have
[1:26:19] to deliver this report on Tuesday it's a
[1:26:21] thing to do it has become casual to us
[1:26:24] instead of it being the very source of
[1:26:27] our existence
[1:26:29] that is Kingdom that we come from it's a
[1:26:32] different world it's a it's a different
[1:26:34] place it's a different life it's a
[1:26:36] different law and that Kingdom is what
[1:26:38] we are fighting to press into and the
[1:26:40] Kingdom suffered violence and the
[1:26:43] violent take it by force with all of our
[1:26:47] efforts um but always talk about at last
[1:26:49] we you could take a pig and put a bow
[1:26:51] tie on the pig with a three-piece suit
[1:26:53] on the pig put perfume on the pier you
[1:26:55] could put the pig in a limousine and
[1:26:57] drive it as destination the moment it
[1:26:59] comes out of the control environment it
[1:27:02] will go back to what it used to do
[1:27:03] because that's the nature of the pink
[1:27:05] and that's the nature of every man
[1:27:08] that's born and sin and shift in
[1:27:10] iniquity and the babbles it all have
[1:27:12] come short but until your nature is
[1:27:15] changed you'll go back to your always
[1:27:21] until there's something change in your
[1:27:24] heart you go back to your old ways and
[1:27:28] the preaching of the gospel is to
[1:27:31] prepare you for an encounter with the
[1:27:33] pillar of fire the disciples they walk
[1:27:37] with Jesus they talk with Jesus they saw
[1:27:40] miracles if it was any group of people
[1:27:43] who should have not backslidden was the
[1:27:45] disciples think about it think about
[1:27:48] being with Jesus by the scene and you're
[1:27:50] there on the boat and the storm comes
[1:27:53] and Jesus is sleeping and you're scared
[1:27:55] and he just wings myself peace be still
[1:27:57] wouldn't you be persuaded of what this
[1:28:00] Jesus is talking about you're hungry and
[1:28:03] he takes five loaves and two fishes and
[1:28:05] feeds thousands of people wouldn't that
[1:28:08] persuade you of this man's ministry when
[1:28:12] Jesus stood outside of the grave of
[1:28:14] Lazarus and say Lazarus come forth
[1:28:17] how much more examples who you need
[1:28:20] before you were convinced that this
[1:28:21] ministry is right
[1:28:23] but yet still when Jesus died what did
[1:28:26] these disciples do they went back to
[1:28:30] fishing they went back to what they used
[1:28:33] to do they went back to their old ways
[1:28:35] for three and a half years as it will
[1:28:38] they had listened to the greatest
[1:28:40] preacher who would ever preach they
[1:28:44] listened to the greatest teacher who
[1:28:46] would ever teach then listen to God
[1:28:48] Himself Vail and sixteen elements and
[1:28:51] after his three and a half year ministry
[1:28:54] when Jesus died these disciples went
[1:28:57] back fishing so don't be surprised when
[1:29:02] people stand in church for years and you
[1:29:06] can't understand how is it they somehow
[1:29:09] find themselves fishing they find
[1:29:13] themselves just there they find
[1:29:16] themselves no joy no see you know
[1:29:19] enthusiasm they find themselves they're
[1:29:22] just in church or maybe not even in
[1:29:24] church or coming to church when they
[1:29:25] want to come to church or brain when
[1:29:27] they think they should pray or when is
[1:29:29] an emergency because this is how the
[1:29:32] disciples found themselves until Jesus
[1:29:35] rose from the dead and breathed upon
[1:29:38] them receiving the Holy Ghost and in his
[1:29:42] resurrection ministry he opened their
[1:29:44] understanding to the scriptures and he
[1:29:46] pleased them of our promise
[1:29:48] but even while they were under the
[1:29:50] promise the Bible said they were afraid
[1:29:52] and they hid in the upper room but
[1:29:56] something happened in their lives when
[1:29:58] the Holy Ghost came one day the Bible
[1:30:01] says it was a sound from heaven as of a
[1:30:02] rushing mighty wind and it filled the
[1:30:04] whole house where they were settling and
[1:30:06] cloven tongues of fire divided itself
[1:30:09] and he went upon each one and they walk
[1:30:12] out that room without him and Peter said
[1:30:15] this is that which was spoken by the
[1:30:17] Prophet Joel
[1:30:19] he said these men are drunk as you
[1:30:21] suppose but this is that and when the
[1:30:23] Holy Ghost came upon Peter all of his
[1:30:25] fear was gone
[1:30:27] his condition was gone all of his
[1:30:29] backsliding was gone what was it it was
[1:30:32] the holy ghost itself it was not a book
[1:30:35] it was not a message it was the Holy
[1:30:37] Ghost itself a portion of God had
[1:30:40] tabernacled himself inside of these men
[1:30:44] and that is what we need that's what we
[1:30:46] needed here this morning for the ruling
[1:30:50] us it selves tabernacle in each one of
[1:30:54] us and that's my burden this morning
[1:30:58] because if you are if you don't know
[1:31:00] that's what you are supposed to expect
[1:31:02] or prepare for you are not being
[1:31:04] preparation for it but those disciples
[1:31:06] they went into the upper room under the
[1:31:08] promise receive ye the Holy Ghost so
[1:31:12] they were there getting ready they were
[1:31:15] there making preparations they were
[1:31:17] there and they had separated themselves
[1:31:19] from the world The Situation's had it
[1:31:22] now existed that forced them into that
[1:31:24] place where they couldn't go out when it
[1:31:29] couldn't worry about what out there
[1:31:30] because the Romans were we're looking
[1:31:32] for them
[1:31:33] but why they were there cord meant them
[1:31:36] and friends is that easy when you have
[1:31:38] to stand alone most of us we we want to
[1:31:41] be part of something but those disciples
[1:31:44] had to stand alone away from family away
[1:31:47] from friends and among others who had
[1:31:50] the same motivation others who had to
[1:31:52] seem desire others who wanted a core to
[1:31:55] the same place and that's what has to
[1:31:57] happen to each of you you must be
[1:31:59] prepared to separate from everything
[1:32:00] that will take you away from your
[1:32:02] spiritual destination friends we have to
[1:32:06] get desperate to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:32:09] it's not just believing because when
[1:32:13] Paul and acts 19 met some believers he
[1:32:16] asked them the question have you
[1:32:17] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:32:20] believe the question is that if you are
[1:32:22] believer the question is that if you
[1:32:24] have the books and if you have the tapes
[1:32:26] and if you know the message the question
[1:32:28] is have you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:32:31] since you believed and if you have not
[1:32:34] received the Holy Ghost there ought to
[1:32:36] be a desperation in your soul
[1:32:38] day and night morning and evening day
[1:32:42] and night morning and evening Lord I
[1:32:44] need this because the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:47] eternal life the Holy Ghost is power the
[1:32:51] Holy Ghost is your inheritance the Holy
[1:32:53] Ghost is the token that God wants to
[1:32:56] look at can the church see man the Holy
[1:33:00] Ghost will put in the sneak out of your
[1:33:03] heart the Holy Ghost will Tico's desires
[1:33:06] that you're struggling with because you
[1:33:08] can try to bring your body under
[1:33:10] subjection and and there's a lot you can
[1:33:12] do as a human and a Romanichal child
[1:33:14] with your choices but it's a whole
[1:33:15] different thing when the Holy Ghost
[1:33:17] takes complete control and takes control
[1:33:20] of your elements takes control of your
[1:33:22] eyes takes control of your ears where
[1:33:25] you only go where he wants you to go
[1:33:27] it's no longer you choosing not to tuber
[1:33:30] you have gone past that stage you have
[1:33:31] already chosen and as we're over these
[1:33:33] last week because thou has done this
[1:33:36] thing then the Holy Ghost has the full
[1:33:38] authority to take his place in your
[1:33:41] heart and lead you to where you don't
[1:33:43] even want to go take it away didn't want
[1:33:45] to go because it's a Holy Ghost its
[1:33:48] power the Holy Ghost will change where
[1:33:51] you walk it'll change the way you talk
[1:33:53] it will change the way you worship it
[1:33:56] will change the way you break it'll
[1:33:58] change the way you love it'll change
[1:34:00] what you eat it'll change where you go
[1:34:03] it'll make you a Christian
[1:34:05] it'll make you testify it'll make you
[1:34:08] talk different it'll make you walk
[1:34:10] different in kind you he is your
[1:34:13] comforter that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:34:15] he is your guide he will take you to
[1:34:17] your school he will take you to your

[1:44:10] but he dropped a seed a hidden seed
[1:44:14] inside of your soul and every sheep has
[1:44:18] got to bring forth after its time it
[1:44:21] just needs the right atmosphere so let's
[1:44:24] create the atmosphere oh because in the
[1:44:26] right atmosphere Satan gets mad he's

[1:45:03] you will feel an oral adjuster but the
[1:45:05] teller he knew something was gonna
[1:45:07] happen that's why it was a struggle even
[1:45:10] wasn't a struggle there's no blessing
[1:45:12] but if there was a struggle you're gonna
[1:45:15] shout of praise because the devil is
[1:45:17] finished you are pressed fast like the
[1:45:20] lily you grasp last and you are here and
[1:45:24] because you are here and God is here
[1:45:26] something has got to happen

[1:46:09] make it
[1:46:09] the table has no power go with a branch
[1:46:12] settle down it's a bluff
[1:46:13] that pain in your body it's a bluff
[1:46:18] the condition of your children is a
[1:46:20] bluff the problems in your marriage is a
[1:46:25] bluff your financial problems is a bluff
[1:46:29] the devil has no power
[1:46:34] [Applause]
[1:46:38] may your spiritual minds open up that
[1:46:43] you were represented when Lucifer cut
[1:46:47] his angels and try to do a cool event
[1:46:52] Michael through his soul and there were
[1:46:55] some angels some sons of God some
[1:46:59] morning stars who fought with Michael
[1:47:03] these angelic spirits there that
[1:47:06] presented us these angelic beings
[1:47:10] represented us so fighting in the
[1:47:13] spiritual realm is not foreign to us it
[1:47:17] is what we do and that's why God let see
[1:47:20] whatever you in heaven knows you can
[1:47:28] handle it because you are attribute sons
[1:47:31] of the Spirit
[1:47:33] [Applause]

[1:48:09] condition but the Branham taught us
[1:48:11] those are spirits those are demons
[1:48:15] spirits and demons we are equipped to
[1:48:18] take them on because there's power in
[1:48:21] the Church of the Living God all that
[1:48:24] God was important to Christ all that
[1:48:27] Christ was he poor little Church

[1:50:14] [Applause]
[1:50:17] jesus said to Peter the devil has
[1:50:23] desired to sift you like wheat in that
[1:50:31] day sifting of the wheat was not done
[1:50:35] through the strainer that we have now
[1:50:39] the sifting as a wheat but the Anthony
[1:50:42] was they would have these almost four
[1:50:44] sticks as it were we'd almost like a
[1:50:47] cloth between a huge it wasn't like one
[1:50:49] person job but they would throw it up
[1:50:52] and throw it up so when Jesus telling
[1:50:56] this to Peter Peter noticeably would be
[1:50:58] concerned because the devil wants to
[1:51:01] sift you like me through your life up
[1:51:03] and down and side-to-side and you don't
[1:51:06] know where your foot is is not the way
[1:51:07] he said he said but that your feet feel
[1:51:15] not
[1:51:17] [Music]
[1:51:20] listen he didn't say you wouldn't be
[1:51:24] sifted you said that definitely is
[1:51:28] either shifty he didn't go into how and
[1:51:32] when and how long if just do what happen
[1:51:34] but he said listen no matter what you go
[1:51:36] to app prayed for you that true all of
[1:51:40] what you have to go through your feet
[1:51:43] but feel not because if you keep your
[1:51:47] feet see this one will keep you going if
[1:51:52] you hold on to this word and its promise
[1:51:54] no matter if you're up you're down
[1:51:57] you're upside down just keep your feet
[1:52:03] come the church same you may be seated
[1:52:08] I pray that today your spiritual eyes
[1:52:13] will open up and the amnesia that you
[1:52:16] have been suffering because some of you
[1:52:17] really have to have forgotten who you
[1:52:19] are to do some of the things that he
[1:52:22] wanted to but as you come to a greater
[1:52:27] realization of who you are in God it
[1:52:30] should give you a confidence to tell the
[1:52:33] devil know
[1:52:37] it sounds very simple but it's in these
[1:52:42] day-to-day victories that we win the war
[1:52:48] you are the sum total of every decision
[1:52:51] you make years ago we didn't have as
[1:53:00] much lifestyle diseases as we have known
[1:53:03] but we have evolved now we have young
[1:53:07] children addicted to soft drink and
[1:53:09] addicted to juice and processed sugars
[1:53:12] and different things and diseases like
[1:53:16] obesity and all these things these it
[1:53:18] will happen overnight
[1:53:20] you don't drink one soft drink and
[1:53:22] suddenly you obese it doesn't happen
[1:53:24] it's a process it is a process you drink
[1:53:29] a coke every single day there's an
[1:53:30] effect of that and then people want to
[1:53:34] lose it in five days and it took five
[1:53:39] years to reach there and then you have
[1:53:43] these phenomenal programs lucid in 10
[1:53:45] days Lucilla five identities and
[1:53:48] mathematically it doesn't make sense
[1:53:51] because it was one plus one plus one
[1:53:54] plus one plus one plus one plus one plus
[1:53:56] one plus one plus one plus two plus five
[1:53:59] plus three soft wings at the end
[1:54:06] and your spiritual maturity is won by
[1:54:10] simple victories every single day the
[1:54:16] question was asked to the Prophet how do
[1:54:18] you grow how do you grow as a christian
[1:54:22] and the answer has always been very
[1:54:26] simple read your Bible and pray every
[1:54:30] day with a signal in Sunday school and
[1:54:33] that's why I said youth oriented service
[1:54:36] is not just for young people because we
[1:54:38] have quote-unquote killers who have
[1:54:42] stopped growing because they don't
[1:54:45] longer read their Bibles and pray every
[1:54:47] day they have they have graduated to
[1:54:52] seemingly when God told Joshua meditate
[1:54:57] on the word day and night so you will
[1:55:00] have good success and you want to know
[1:55:03] why you're struggling and why things not
[1:55:07] working out and why I can't get a
[1:55:09] financial breakthrough and why life is
[1:55:11] so hard and why I strongly encourages
[1:55:13] the happiest waited I'm just waitin
[1:55:16] because the word teachers God never
[1:55:18] leaves us we are the ones who leave him
[1:55:22] number the Branham said if you ever want
[1:55:24] to get back to God walk right back to
[1:55:26] the place where you left him he'll be
[1:55:28] standing right there
[1:55:29] because he is not his nature to leave
[1:55:32] you it is needed to follow us this is
[1:55:37] why remember the branham's book of when
[1:55:39] Adam fell he said it wasn't Adam when
[1:55:41] looking for God it was God when looking
[1:55:44] for Adam Adam Adam and we used to
[1:55:46] fellowshipping where are you where are
[1:55:48] you Adam and Adam was out of his
[1:55:51] position is God's nature to come after
[1:55:53] us
[1:55:53] it is God's nature to reconcile with us
[1:55:56] and that's my brother Brennan said God
[1:55:59] wants to give you the Holy Ghost more
[1:56:02] than you even want to receive it God
[1:56:06] doesn't want to withhold the whole
[1:56:07] equals from us he wants to give it to us
[1:56:10] the Prophet said more and we even want
[1:56:12] to receive it
[1:56:13] but friends a holy God cannot come and
[1:56:19] live where there is darkness
[1:56:23] and by the Branum satellite as he said
[1:56:25] before court could fill you you have to
[1:56:27] empty yourself and for some of us it's
[1:56:32] saw was a so spiritual we have full up
[1:56:34] of our own spiritual self so different
[1:56:37] things we need to empty all of today
[1:56:39] there those work the empty out sin and
[1:56:41] the world and that's why sometimes and
[1:56:44] that's why but the Browns I know people
[1:56:45] who have come to his meetings sinners
[1:56:47] prostitute on the street and get healed
[1:56:49] because they didn't have no
[1:56:51] preconception they were not
[1:56:53] fact-checking and they were not no they
[1:56:55] just came in humble sincere they
[1:56:57] believed and they were healed and people
[1:56:59] who sat in church for years they will
[1:57:01] fill up up themselves you know how many
[1:57:03] scriptures I know how many books I've
[1:57:05] read how many oh let's pray meeting I've
[1:57:08] been in and they feel to realize that
[1:57:10] God is still simple God who is looking
[1:57:14] for surrender and feet from individuals
[1:57:18] who are sold out so some of us we have
[1:57:21] to empty out of our pride lust whatever
[1:57:24] it is our own we own I know some of us
[1:57:27] that until our good self I'm always in
[1:57:31] church I never miss a service if you not
[1:57:35] see me here my name duty hmm something
[1:57:37] wrong the road Brooke
[1:57:43] and the gap was so big I couldn't jump
[1:57:45] over because it was just a simple brick
[1:57:46] I would have jump over and still be
[1:57:47] every night today good self but God is
[1:57:53] not measuring people on works and on
[1:57:58] your effort less that you boast that is
[1:58:01] you because he wants all the glory
[1:58:05] at the end of the day that the headstone
[1:58:07] will come with Shelton's crying grace
[1:58:09] grace grace grace because we are all
[1:58:13] filled as the begin with we all me
[1:58:16] there's nobody here but I'm not better
[1:58:18] than anybody and he was what I want to
[1:58:20] be worse please I don't want to be
[1:58:26] better than anybody else
[1:58:28] because I know it's a grace of God to my
[1:58:30] life if he didn't pick me up and tell
[1:58:37] him I left all wrong I don't know where
[1:58:38] I'd be
[1:58:38] I could get no credit for what you see
[1:58:43] here this woman it's the grace of God
[1:58:45] and that is what every testimony should
[1:58:49] be
[1:58:49] it's a grace of Almighty God I was lost
[1:58:53] I was a sinner I was no good but caught
[1:58:57] rich and grace and mercy pick me up turn
[1:59:01] me around send our prophet put a message
[1:59:05] that I wouldn't be a Pentecostal or this
[1:59:07] religious but tell me there's a way back
[1:59:09] I went back to Eden or we're back to we
[1:59:11] shall reign on the earth I went back to
[1:59:14] spoken would a wave back to the original
[1:59:16] seed that's what his prophets brought oh
[1:59:18] we ought to be rejoicing
[1:59:20] oh we ought to be so happy all we want
[1:59:23] to be so grateful
[1:59:24] [Applause]
[1:59:27] and I'll see it again friends this is
[1:59:30] not about rules it not to say message
[1:59:33] things that are to be our homework but
[1:59:36] the Brandon was saying when he leaves
[1:59:38] his house to wonder field he doesn't sit
[1:59:41] and his wife and say while I'm gone
[1:59:44] don't have any other husband anybody
[1:59:47] listen anybody remember the part all
[1:59:49] right after I said she doesn't say bill
[1:59:51] while you're gone do happy need a wife
[1:59:54] and I better Brandon goes on to say but
[1:59:56] what if something happens in the field
[1:59:58] he said I come back and look at those
[2:00:00] wrinkles and those gray hair and say
[2:00:02] would you forgive me he said but as he
[2:00:04] looks at her he said it'll hurt him so
[2:00:07] much he'd rather die than have to even
[2:00:10] do that so because of his love for her
[2:00:13] he will never want to do anything to
[2:00:16] hurt her and that's what real love is
[2:00:19] listen for yourself that's your homework
[2:00:21] things that ought to be that's your
[2:00:23] message and I say to young people all
[2:00:26] the time but it's church have real rules
[2:00:28] and that's what I say yeah real rules
[2:00:30] you can't do this you can't do that you
[2:00:32] can do that you can do this you do this
[2:00:34] and is it and I say it's not about rules
[2:00:41] it's about love because if you love God
[2:00:47] then it would be in your nature to only
[2:00:51] do things to please him
[2:00:54] then all of a sudden it's no longer
[2:00:57] rules its he doesn't like this he likes
[2:01:00] he doesn't like this like this and then
[2:01:02] all of a sudden your life becomes easy
[2:01:05] so as a Christian sister he likes it in
[2:01:08] my hair is combed out why would I want
[2:01:10] to cut it he doesn't like it as he likes
[2:01:17] it when I trust modestly that's what I'm
[2:01:19] his queen it's love I said to the two
[2:01:26] some time ago my wife likes whites close
[2:01:30] in one side colors are the next side the
[2:01:35] liberal is our rules in my house after
[2:01:38] pretty white clothes in one corner
[2:01:39] pretty colors and he makes color but
[2:01:43] because I love her after finally with
[2:01:45] the pudding I close it I'm pretty colors
[2:01:47] here because it easier to wash but
[2:01:50] that's what love does your behavior you
[2:01:53] are just to behavior when your love
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:01:57] I remember one time me this language and
[2:02:02] she toasted the bread and she thought
[2:02:04] that she was doing a good job of
[2:02:07] twisting the bread with tuna and I said
[2:02:10] listen I don't like the bread toasted
[2:02:12] with tuna leave the bread with Oh to
[2:02:15] sling it now when she toasted that she
[2:02:18] thought it was the best thing to do if
[2:02:21] she didn't toasted to get me upset but
[2:02:23] she thought I would have walked but she
[2:02:24] didn't know so within this Christian
[2:02:28] journey there are things that you men do
[2:02:29] that you don't know if it working just
[2:02:31] yet but that's what the word comes for I
[2:02:33] don't want that twisting I don't want to
[2:02:35] just like just a little bit gestures and
[2:02:36] the Holy Spirit is your guide he will
[2:02:38] guide you along this journey as you get
[2:02:42] deeper and deeper in love you begin to
[2:02:44] become one so you see certain couples
[2:02:48] just to move the I didn't know what to
[2:02:50] do without words being said without
[2:02:55] words no communication but it's a
[2:02:58] connection and you read there were men a
[2:03:01] few words there when he spoke when he
[2:03:03] wanted them to speak but apparently that
[2:03:05] was one nun didn't know what to do is
[2:03:09] this seem to be preaching about that's
[2:03:11] that's the message but one not you know
[2:03:13] what God's answer to because you are so
[2:03:15] connected you on the same wavelength
[2:03:17] his words your words his thoughts your
[2:03:20] thoughts his behavior your behavior his
[2:03:22] nature your nature his being you're
[2:03:24] being his attributes your what are you
[2:03:27] flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit
[2:03:31] of my spirit bride and groom husband and
[2:03:34] wife mrs. Jesus Christ and the Lord
[2:03:37] Jesus Christ
[2:03:38] bride of Jesus Christ and the church
[2:03:40] semen
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:44] but that type of relationship with God
[2:03:48] cannot be intellectual it has to be hot
[2:03:52] it has to be the same spirit it cannot
[2:03:56] be your spirit that's why the Bible says
[2:03:59] I'll give you a new heart I'll give you
[2:04:01] a new spirit and then I'll put my spirit
[2:04:04] in there because when you have his
[2:04:09] spirit now you could communicate know
[2:04:13] you could really know you could talk the
[2:04:14] same language don't you want to talk the
[2:04:17] same language with him don't you want to
[2:04:19] become a deeper Christian with him how
[2:04:24] many love him this morning
[2:04:29] wonderful so I'm going to assume that if
[2:04:35] you love him you will want to do things
[2:04:38] to please him so how many people this
[2:04:42] morning want to do everything to please
[2:04:44] him
[2:04:45] [Music]
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:54] because they are many gurus say they
[2:04:56] love Illinois ivy Pentecostal people
[2:04:58] watch them they declaring it from the
[2:05:01] car I love Jesus written on the
[2:05:04] windscreen but their behavior and their
[2:05:07] action and you know love is an action
[2:05:10] word so if you love God then your
[2:05:13] actions indicate that you love God so if
[2:05:16] you love God then I shouldn't see you
[2:05:20] dressing in a way that would not please
[2:05:22] him and students see you having
[2:05:24] conversations about what wouldn't please
[2:05:26] him I shouldn't see you putting stuff on
[2:05:28] Facebook in a way that if I could see it
[2:05:32] imagine him because he's seen way doing
[2:05:33] in secret if I see way doing in the
[2:05:35] wrong fathers with him and he's hidden
[2:05:38] secrets and some of you say you love him
[2:05:41] and he doing it in the public how could
[2:05:46] you have a test of money that you love
[2:05:48] Jesus and you will do stuff to let him
[2:05:51] when the Bible says crystals like grieve
[2:05:54] not the Holy Spirit whereby ye are
[2:05:57] sealed until the day of your redemption
[2:05:59] greed means the hood how many first hurt
[2:06:03] the Holy Spirit with how we speak how we
[2:06:06] act we spoke about it many many times on
[2:06:09] the whole it was like a dove comes to
[2:06:13] the lamb dog wouldn't come to the wolf
[2:06:17] and heard a preacher use analogy very
[2:06:20] simple analogy to how sensitive the Dove
[2:06:22] is he said think of a butterfly when a
[2:06:25] butterfly comes it will an and if you if
[2:06:28] you act irrationally or it will fly away
[2:06:31] but we have to attract the Holy Spirit
[2:06:34] our lives I'm giving you guidelines and
[2:06:39] tips and encouragement for those of you
[2:06:41] who want to get the Holy Ghost those who
[2:06:43] really want to but I don't say when you
[2:06:45] want to get a will notice what you do
[2:06:46] spend time with people who have
[2:06:50] who are your friends who is your
[2:06:53] advisors who lead in you who are you
[2:06:56] leading anybody or you just they're
[2:06:58] drifting around do you want to change or
[2:07:05] do you want I said it last Sunday I said
[2:07:10] that I love Bob you know it still
[2:07:11] troubles me because sometimes you know
[2:07:15] even though you know something gonna

[2:10:30] [Applause]
[2:10:32] the all creation waited for the
[2:10:35] manifestation of the sons of God and
[2:10:40] Friends the rapture is not supposed to
[2:10:42] be yelling at people - cow how Whitford
[2:10:44] wrapped in you just want to escape it's
[2:10:45] not what escaped
[2:10:46] it's about we being taken away for God
[2:10:49] to bring judgment we nurture an escape
[2:10:53] you go be scared no we're not scared the
[2:10:55] back seat for he isn't giving her the
[2:10:57] spirit of fear
[2:10:58] that's the Bible what are you afraid of
[2:11:01] but it's given the spirit of adoption
[2:11:04] whereby we cry Abba Father
[2:11:06] yeah it's nothing off vocabulary in fact
[2:11:10] many times you just focus to us fear not
[2:11:12] I think is about 66 or so times or
[2:11:14] signal he said fear not be not afraid it
[2:11:17] is I fear not fear not fear not fear not
[2:11:19] stop being afraid
[2:11:22] you are just like him we are joint heirs
[2:11:26] with Christ the trees know who you are
[2:11:28] that's why they are groaning and
[2:11:30] travailing for the manifestation of the
[2:11:32] sons of God when born sons fill sons
[2:11:35] with suddenly wake up and speak and what
[2:11:37] they say will be created somebodies same
[2:11:42] so who's ready to press past themselves
[2:11:47] this morning
[2:11:47] who's ready to claim their individual
[2:11:50] inheritance who's ready to say Lord I
[2:11:53] want to sell you with everything my all
[2:11:56] my heart my life
[2:12:00] can we give the Lord a hand oh praise
[2:12:02] the musician if you get ready I'm almost
[2:12:06] done but friends what we have this
[2:12:12] morning will not exist all the time one
[2:12:18] day there will be a last service one day
[2:12:20] there will be a last meeting and while
[2:12:23] they are still blood and they're still
[2:12:24] grace every service is a burden are hard
[2:12:28] to see you get closer to Christ and
[2:12:30] closer to the church closer to Christ to
[2:12:33] be like Jesus that's our prayer to be
[2:12:35] like Jesus to be like him
[2:12:38] to press pass ourselves and to get that
[2:12:41] that eternal life in our souls you can
[2:12:46] begin to play something softly we read
[2:12:51] the scripture there'll be two in the
[2:12:54] field one taken one left I know you've
[2:12:57] heard it before
[2:12:59] but the issues of life sometimes makes
[2:13:02] us forget how serious this thing is
[2:13:04] it'll be two and a bear there'll be two
[2:13:06] in our field one taken one left it's not
[2:13:09] to the group it's the individuals
[2:13:19] I don't believe in my heart that is
[2:13:21] anybody here today who wants to be left
[2:13:23] I don't believe in my hearts and the
[2:13:30] days of Moses when he told him to put
[2:13:32] blood on the door that there were people
[2:13:34] who say I want to die
[2:13:35] [Music]
[2:13:39] so the question is that if you want to
[2:13:42] go the question is how much you really
[2:13:43] want to go because we have a requirement
[2:13:46] to meet the preacher didn't make
[2:13:50] requirement the passer that major
[2:13:52] requirement God Himself said the
[2:13:53] requirement he said when I see the blood
[2:13:56] I'll pass over you you have to be
[2:14:02] willing to give it all up and say Lord I
[2:14:06] surrender you have to be willing to say
[2:14:10] Lord I recognize I'm no good
[2:14:13] I'm no good lord I need the Liberals
[2:14:21] Lord I my prayer life is not what it's
[2:14:24] supposed to be I'm no good
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:30] Lord I need the Holy Ghost I'm no good
[2:14:34] what I need a touch of no good lord I
[2:14:38] need an experience I'm no good
[2:14:41] not my heart
[2:14:44] and in a new heart I need a new spirit
[2:14:47] and in your spirit I don't want to go on
[2:14:52] living this way
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:55] I share it under communion service I
[2:14:59] said the rich young ruler
[2:15:01] he came with a desire
[2:15:06] he said master what can I do to inherit
[2:15:10] eternal life
[2:15:13] and but the Branham said you could never
[2:15:16] come to the president of the garden and
[2:15:18] leave the same he said you will either
[2:15:21] leave better or you Olivos
[2:15:25] friends this man stood before Jesus and
[2:15:30] Jesus responded he said obey your
[2:15:34] Commandments obey your mother and your
[2:15:36] father all the commandments and this
[2:15:39] young man he responded Anna I guess he
[2:15:41] would have felt good
[2:15:42] he said master I've done all of this
[2:15:45] from my youth
[2:15:47] what lack I yet and Jesus discerned his
[2:15:52] heart as his discerning hands this
[2:15:54] morning through the wood he told that
[2:15:57] young man he said go sell all that you
[2:15:59] have and give to the poor and the Bible
[2:16:05] says when that boy did that he turned
[2:16:08] away and he left sorrowful and that
[2:16:12] pained me
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:15] why would you come to Jesus and leave
[2:16:18] disappointed
[2:16:19] [Music]
[2:16:21] why would you come to Jesus and leave
[2:16:23] sorrowful when he could answer everybody
[2:16:27] when he could meet every need but that
[2:16:30] young man was not willing to give up
[2:16:32] what he held dear to him
[2:16:35] and that's why he left sorrowful friends
[2:16:39] every one of us me included we have
[2:16:41] something to give up this morning we
[2:16:44] have to give up something
[2:16:47] you know what you need to give up won't
[2:16:50] you give it up today
[2:16:53] would you let it go today won't you come
[2:16:56] back home today won't you rededicate
[2:16:59] your life city what you see Lord I've
[2:17:02] not been living as I should Lord I've
[2:17:05] been trying yes I've been trying but
[2:17:07] I've been trying hard enough Lord I've
[2:17:10] been giving you 99% but it's still more
[2:17:15] this is not just the people who are
[2:17:17] struggling there are those of us who are
