Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy and the grace you have extended to our lives to give us a desire in our hearts for you many would have loved to have that but they don't and we pray help us tonight we thank you that in our hearts tonight there's a longing there a desire there a hungering a thirsting after righteousness father God may you st us up tonight as we prepare to pray in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thanks so much for being here I want to read two portion of scriptures from Luke chapter 18 1 verse verse one and also I wonder read psalms 42 1-3 Psalms 42 1-3 let's read Luke 18 verse1 Jesus talking about Jesus and he spake a parable unto this end that men ought always to pray and not to feain let me give that an emphasis that men ought always to pray and not to faint it says also Jesus told them a parable to the effect they ought always to pray and not to turn coward faint lose heart or give up Psalms 42 1-3 and David speaks as the heart panted after the water Brooks so panted my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsted for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God and the Amplified it says as the heart PS and loans for the water broke so i pant and long for you oh God my inner self thirsts for God for the Living God When shall I come and behold the face of God my tears have been my full de and night why men say unto me all day long where is your god you know we were born in sin and shaping iniquity and we born we born having desires all of us different desires and you know I was reading something that the more desires people have is the more unfulfilled because you cannot fulfill all the desires you want to do this you want want to do that and you're speaking about I think it's Mari Curry and you have different people who work on diseases and getting Solutions and cures and like Albert Ein different ones they had few desires and because they had few desires they could be successful in a in a realm that made them Geniuses and the ultimate spot of Desire is when you have a single desire and that is what Jesus demonstrated a desire to please God a desire to do the will of God it happens that when people have a lot of desires they are unsatisfied they get angry quickly they calm down quickly up recently I was hearing somebody says about this person could curse you up and carry on and then next day if they need something from you they'll ask you normal normal as if they never did anything to you their emotional uh rhythm is up and down and in and out they are consumed by their own emotions it is hard for them to focus now John 737 Bible says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood him C right saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink now a desire to drink and thirsting to drink is two different things and this is the point right here where I want to get to tonight talking about this desire many people know the Bible is right God is true God is not dead but they don't have a thirst and if tonight you don't have that desire or thirst I want to encourage you let's start right there with that you could pray God give you that desire and thirst Jesus even said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness that they shall be filled note he didn't say blessed are they that know the word blessed are they that you know understand understand the message understand the Bible no hunger and thirst and have to do with the heart condition what kind of heart you have when you hear somebody say I don't care watch them that's a dangerous person because the prophet taught us we care about the Milkman we care about the garbage man we care because we want to have respect we want to show God we have respect because God demands respect for his servants and his people and that why Jesus talk about don't bring offense you know don't go and trouble God's people or treat them badly because you could interfere with God and God will deal with that so understand when Jesus If any man thirst he was separating those who had an interest from those who had a desire now a desire dictionary desire is a urge it's a longing it's a craving it's a thirst it's a hunger it's a passion it's an appetite it's a un you see when David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go in the house of the Lord you could see David with excitement you could see David with enthusiasm David can't see that and walk his Le you know why he is ined about going into the house of God he's committed he is an excitement for him it's a joy for him do you have that Joy when Anthony s longing for Jesus I have a longing for him he didn't know what I was going to share tonight but I just connected to that song about having a strong dis desire a longing a craving there are people who craving for other people husband other people wife there are people craving for other people's job there are people lusting for what they don't have and it brings emptiness on the inside because The Thirst that God put within us that a desire is to be filled not with money popularity woman wine and song but is to be filled with him the devil throws things into US upon us to quench that thirst to quench that desire and when David said as the heart pant after the water book so my soul pant after the Living God but theam dramatized that as the heart being wounded and running for its life because the animal is behind it and if it only get that drink of water it will get revived and if there's a hour when we need to be revived is now we need to get revived one two and stay revived because listen everything going to fight the Revival everything going to fight your passion for God everything will will fight your thirst for God that's why it have if not movies it have sports if not Sports it have all kind of things to take up your time friends but have friends is Facebook is Facebook is WhatsApp is this the devil makes sure the options are so vast and wi that he could keep you busy not in God's plan or program but I say this way doing your own thing the problem is we could actually live a fairly successful life without God and without prayer because this is how God set it up you don't need to talk to him you need to call upon him but there's a reason that he placed this thing that men ought to pray and not to faint in other words don't give up don't be weak don't be a coward regardless of how the situation I know a sister what was drinking and a drunk and she prayed for 20 something years and eventually he was saved both of them going on to be with the Lord now but it shows that prayer works and sometimes because we don't see our prayer in operation we get frustrated we feel to give up we feel no longer it doesn't matter God know all things and we throw everything up into heaven and we leave it up to God it doesn't work that way Jesus in teaching them to pray said thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven so somehow Heaven and Earth have to connect in a way where we understand our prayer actually have a connection with things operational in heaven and to prove that the prophet said that when Daniel was praying and the angel was coming if Daniel stopped praying the angel to stop coming so prayer was an effect in affecting things at in the Heavenly realm the Bible call it the prayers of the Saints the Bible call it like our prayers like incense they light some incense in your house or some sweet smelling something and it perfume the house or you you spray something in your room and it smell nice and so like that right well this is what prayer comes in the nostrils of God desire comes before prayer desire goes after prayer desire follows prayer without desire we just going through form we mumbling words we just saying things desire is silent that's in the heart prayer is heard prayer is a verbal expression of Desire I need help oh God you are my help you are my rock you are my shield you are my strong and mighty tower David said I look unto the hills for when cometh my help my help comes from the Lord desire is what goes before prayer Hebrews 1166 says this but without faith it is impossible to please it here we go part when get toight for he that come to God like tonight like tonight you I all of us for he that cometh to God must believe he is and that he is a rewarder for them that diligently seek him or energetically seek him or enthusiastically seeking or passionately seeking God want you to know he rewards did you get that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seeking Jesus said it even this way pray to the father who SE it in the secret and the father who e in secret shall reward you openly in other words the blessings of God would be seen upon you the blessings of God will be evident around you are you willing to get there tonight so prayer is asking God prayer have to be expressed I believe the deeper the desire is stronger the pray the prayer to pray there we go whether we feel like it or not so if you're not feeling to pray you still pray you pray regardless you pray past your fears you pray past your doubts you pray you're reaching out so if you don't have that desire tonight or don't have the intensity of that desire tonight ask God because God can increase your desire and with your desire you can increase in prayer won't be long a short explation let me say that again so if you don't have that desire you're watching people in church you're watching people elsewhere and they say know that one blessed that one blessed and you don't even know how they're being blessed you don't even know what sacrifice that they're making behind the scenes you don't even know the channel of prayer because of the desire and the thirst for God and you know what says usually people who yeah it takes a burden to pray and usually those people who pray gets the burden so it's like how to say it like a cycle you pray you get a burden and then you get a burden it gives your unction to pray no burden no prayer a light superficial life full of desires it remind me of how the Bible talk about silly woman Laden with diverse lust ever learning and never com to the knowledge of the truth hear in this they hear in that hear in that it is here there every never really focused note the right Brothers even this guy El musk all the people that has great achievements have been people who have been focused they focus on a certain thing they can't have all kind of crazy desires because you cannot be Ting yourself out with trying to fulfill this and fulfill that and D why Jesus himself says my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work it was specific God in service to die gold frankincense and Mer the gifts of the wise men identify Jesus purpose you have a purpose where is your purpose do you think about that have you asked God about that it come make somebody interested in a wife what and they wouldn't pray and you pick up some kind of thing and then there a problematic afterwards these things are serious things and Jesus they going and pick up no no body for bride he want a bride that is qualified flesh of his flesh bone of his bone so in our hearts we must want God's desire all right so let wrap up again get first Thessalonians 5:17 says pray without ceasing that's a command in other words don't let nothing stop you from praying said it this way we could sing too much talk tooo much laugh too much eat too much but we can never pray so praying is the will of God and we know this story and I want to close with this here don't be formal in praying no feeling no real desire no heart ined it just going through the emotions and Jesus encountered this with the Scribe and the Pharisees he hated it they was just going through motions formality so when they saw the discip wasn't washing their hands that a big issue with them because how come your disciples not doing this and this foral so when Jesus came they were wrapped in message formality they were met wrapped with thoughts and traditions of the elders and Jesus was a child or a son or a youth of that time and he wasn't bothering with the with the with the teachings of the elders or what the elders Tau about it he said if you believe Moses they going to believe me you know words faith was going to point you to a living expression of God not no dead letter word all right so men ought to pray and not to F maybe I could just close up this one here and there one we know when God told Isaiah Hezekiah and and Isaiah told him thus here the Lord set that house in order Thou shalt not die Thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and PR unto the Lord saying I beseech thee Oh Lord now this is a man that accustom talking to God this is a man that know how to pray the God come and say you shall not live but you will die and he say okay bring the box no he decid to turn his face to the wall and pray unto the Lord saying I beseech you oh Lord remember now how I have walk before thee in truth and with a perfect heart so this man has some money and have done that which is good in thy sight this is from 2 Kings 20 reading from 1-6 and I've done and he said she said I beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah WEP so so it was not his head talking his heart was there he was broken it came to pass a four Isaiah was going in the middle court that the word of the Lord came to him saying turn again and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people thus say the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will heal thee on the third day and thou shall go into the house of the Lord what a blessing it will be tonight in Simplicity for God to come down in your home and tell you I have heard thy prayer but what if he not praying what will he hear or you think about that desire should drive you to prayer prayer is a verbal expression don't sit down in your house or KNE long and you have nothing to say you could talk to Aunt your uncle your sister your brother you could talk to this one on the phone talk to this one on WhatsApp and when you come to the lord it's like you're run out you're M tired you don't know what to say I am saying to you you have to be able to have an expression to God that he could come and said I have heard your prayer you have enemies pray for them you have family pray for them you have loved ones pray for them you have people in the church that nuty and whoopsy pray for them too the church have all types in not all are Saints some ain't no saint but they in church God can make them a but they have to have prayer going forward and the final one I think close this final one in Acts 12 Peter prison church praying for him they praying that Peter get delivered when Peter do come for they want them to visit you off there it's shocking because God operate and God make a way and God answer their prayer and get Peter out of there friends your prayer can start earthquake tonight let us bow our heads heavenly father I pray and that you would speak to your people Lord and you would create in us such a hungering and Tsing for righteousness it will drive the people to Wi them early it will bring them to service on time and make them press to be in service to give you praise and to worship and to put that part that they should put inside the house of God oh Jesus you said in your word Lord If my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and turn from their Wicked Ways you're going to hear from heaven and you could heal their land heal our land tonight Lord pour out the oil pour out the wine pour out your blessings pour out the rain heal the sick in our midst touch the elders
