better yielded to you come and speak to us tonight by your word and confirm your word with signs and wonders and miracles in the mighty blast of your holy spirit be with your people tonight as we stand lord in the gap as it was waiting on you we need to hear from you tonight granted lord in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you thanks for coming out tonight and if you have your bibles i like to read two portions of scripture from luke chapter 22 we want to read verse 39 to 46 and also sent john chapter 15. i want to read from verse 1 to 8. luke chapter 22 reading from verse 39. is jesus in the garden of gethsemane and he came out and went and he was warned to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that you enter nut into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone cast kneeled on and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and he appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was it will great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow he said unto them why sleepy rise and pray we see enter into temptation and reading from saint john 15 verse 1 i am the true vine my father is the husband man every branch in me that bear it not fruit he take it away and every branch that beared fruit he pushed it that he may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i knew as a branch cannot be a fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can he except you abide in me i am divine yeah the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me he can do nothing if a man i bite not in me he's cast photos that merge and it's withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they're burned if you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples may god bless this word you may be seated or praise the name of the lord tonight uh i'm so grateful to be here tonight it's always a privilege to come into god's presence and to his spirit amen under the anointing of god and uh have a title tonight not my will but thine be done and we certainly appreciate the message on sunday have we done enough have we done enough that was such a blessing to me and i um i like that action word have we done not have we heard enough have we done enough now this seems scripture in matthew i just want to read it this is we read it from and that's where i get it from not my will but that be done but in matthew 26 36 to 44 jesus said then come at jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and said disciples city here while i go and pray under so he took with him peter and two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then city unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death this is the same jesus that multiply bread and fish same jesus that turn water into wine same jesus that raised the dead this is jesus saying my soul suffer even unto death tarry here and watch with me he invited him to watch with him and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed seeing oh my father if it is be possible let this god pass me nevertheless not as i will but as though wilt and he comment on the disciples and find him asleep and said unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh my father if this cup may not pass from me except i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went again and prayed at two time saying the same words so much for encouragement so much for partners and friends and people who backing you up and supporting you when you come to this spot you know some time ago i preached about the dynamics we'll drive you to calvary and then to the rapture but before you hit calvary there's a stop and get so many there's a journey through this garden called gethsemane and let's let's go to tonight nowhere is adoption identified with with a man's sermon teaching preaching or revelations nowhere in the message you could ever find a man's teaching revelation human information knowledge bringing him to adoption adoption has always been tied to behavior tutoring child training sanctification obedience to the father's will pleasing the father and about fathers business this word will means to want or to choose you have to want it you have to have a desire for the will of god to be in your life to influence your life to take a hold upon your life and people realize and sometimes it's too late that the choices they made they pay the penalty and price of the decisions that they made so we say the seeds of today the fruit of the more the seeds of the day today is the first day of the rest of your life you can't change your past your past is what it is but what you do today or tonight or this very hour could affect your future so you are still in a position to make decisions decisions right decisions hallelujah i love him tonight i believe that this is what lord want me to share with you tonight hallelujah not my will but dying be done done to do it because you could know the will and don't do it the will could be revealed to you and you don't do it you still have to come to terms not just to catch the will but to do the will hallelujah now we read that scripture if you abide in me my words abide with you let me just go back just a little bit dear this part here i'm the true vine my father is the husband man every branch i mean a beard not fruity take it away that is no if or no but so what i want to say to you tonight you have no choice but to produce the object of the gospel is not that we in church the object here is that we bear fruit he's very plain there's no no if it's not a butt or maybe he or any message he don't have that he said my father is a husband man they just have no satanism this year they're not in their business there ain't no temptation they're not that you know this is something completely out of that satan not in the picture here tonight this have to do with i am the true vine my father is the husband man every branch in me that bear it not fruit he take it away every branch that buried fruit he purged to bring forth more fruit oh glory to god i see no devil inside of there is not lucy inside of there that just you and god you and the word you and your desire to be fruit bearing oh glory to god and the food the food bearing there's a condition and the condition is leafy about in me and my words abide in you you could talk and yap and say what you want to say but if you abide in me and my words are bad in you then you're in a position to ask whatever you will and it shall not maybe not perhaps it shall be done unto you or give the lord a shout nobody could keep you the bride from that nobody could keep individuals from that that is your word that is your seed that is what your rays are for and then he closed off with hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples hearing is my father glorifying so if you want a glorified father it's not just fruit or more fruit is much fruit so god in the improving business the multiplying business the progressing business they add in two business oh glory you can't give god back what you he give you you have to add more an attitude you have to have some interest on top of it that to your feet virtue and knowledge you have to put some things and pile it up on top of that go praise them all you love him tonight so if you don't bear fruit you will be cut off so the objective is to come to spiritual immaturity to be a fruit because a new shoot can't be a fruit it's not mature yet it's not red yet it's not ripe yet isn't that right so god's purpose for us is to be a fruit isn't that right not producing is not an option you will be cut off and the evidence of abiding is the fact that you can ask what you will and it shall be done under you let's continue psalms 40 jesus uh psalms 40 sacrifice and offering though does not desire manners has doubt opened burned offering and sin offering has though not required then said i know i come in the volume of the book it is written of me i delight to do thy will oh my god ye thy law is within my has to be in your heart scale upside brought wood as it was in my heart it has to be in your heart to even want the will of god for your life because i'm not doing anybody else no your wife your husband children neighbor church they tell the deacon pastor that's only with them that has to do with you because the will is personal you have a like personal place in christ the will for your life that's for you alone you alone can hold the script of that you alone could hold a revelation of that i can't give you that revelation god have to give you that revelation and you have to find out the will of god for your life and go and do it not just hear it and speak it back but get the job done it's in john 4 4 30 then went out of the city and came up to him and in the meanwhile his disciples prayed him saying master eat and he said to them i have meat to eat that you know not of and therefore said the disciples one to another had any man brought him or to eat and jesus said unto them my need is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work so jesus was passionate unto his purpose that he was raised up for he even said i always do that which pleases my father his father already said this is my son in whom i am well pleased so it was a harmony and agreement because jesus uh he's he stood with his father's word isn't that right he said now watch my meat is the dude the will of him has sent me and to finish his work say not e they are four months and yet they come at harvest behold i said to you lift up your eyes and look on the field for they are right already to harvest jesus was here confronting the greatest test that he had ever had gethsemane laid just before him where that once and final all-sufficient tests must come when the burden of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder there was no one in all heaven or earth could ever stood it but him and to know this is the burden you know and to know that all of the sins past sins present sins future sins rested upon this decision let me say it again all sins past present future rested upon decision and it was one of the greatest victories that christ ever won or proved his great messiahship as when he said to god not my will thine be done that was the greatest victory he ever won not cast no devils not multiplying bread and fish not doing any kind of mind he works he fell on his face and prayed and that was greatest victory hallelujah it was one of the greatest victory that christ ever won or proved his great message as when he said to god not my will then be done that was the greatest victory ever won all the demons of torment was a wrong to tempt him and the triumph and when we get right with god when our hearts become pure and the holy spirit has taken his place in our hearts it's the most glorious thing to have [Music] attested hallelujah the bible said our testings and trials are more precious to us than sylvan goal of this world so we are should be thankful gethsemane he went a little further i like that part there's a whole message myself you went a little further sometimes you have to go a little further further beyond the noise further beyond the family further beyond the voice of the wife or the voice of the husband or the voice the children the voice of competences our neighbors going further are you prepared to go to the freezer the wise version did they went for you don't get extra oil the bride will do more i believe with all my heart he went a little further then we find out i'll just skip that little bit if you make a mistake some woman make a mistake some man made a mistake some boy or girl made a mistake don't sink scream out and disappear lord save me or perish get desperate about it god will hear you he always he has a desperate soul that's what i'm trying to tell you about our dear lord jesus himself in the world greatest battleground gethsemane he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but watch his humility as he humbled himself not my will but then be done humble himself to the word the promised word of the god of heaven notice then he went a little further and he went a little further how much more ought we to go a little further and notice the scripture said in luke he prayed endlessly brother sister if jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if christ the god of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more we sinner saved by grace but earnestly if the decisions and this is your thing about the weight how we interpret how we take decisions how we make decisions how we go about choosing and making we're going to do this we're going to do that it's so very important oh hallelujah if the decision prays god throw the son of god into despair what will it do to you and i desperately we must cry oh god are you ready tonight the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man so that was a real grit and grime and that started off with having a desire and making a choice to do god's will because he had his own will that's why he said not my will but dying be done we could do what we want to do go where you want to go read where you want to greed meet who you want to be choose whatever friends you want to have go and do this and go that's your will that's your choice but his will is different remember you say my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways so when the revelation of his will begin to come down to you which will it gonna begin it gonna start it's already started but more will come to you because god has to bring us to a spot and to a place not just us as a group but you as an individual hallelujah nobody can put you in the kingdom you know do you have the press the kingdom is preached but you have to press your way into the kingdom of god do you believe that tonight hallelujah the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane you have to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do it that was god anointed that flesh which was human flesh he didn't he went up there as god he would have never died that kind of death but can't kill god but remember he went dear with you and him and god had never separated the bride from the groom so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in one body oh glory to god or his representation in the garden of gethsemane was also representing you so if he could make it so can you if he went through his get sam and he soaked and you because just as he went to cavalry you are yours and you are what you all get 72 by the decisions and choices you make even tonight oh glory to god hallelujah he saw what male and female it was all redeemed in that one buddy they are one same word same word spoke the groom speaks the bride how can the bride come and feel to manifest everything that promised of him and the groom come he wouldn't be the bride it wouldn't be the bride and when he did everything even to proven it by raising from the dead afterwards the bride have to do the same thing have to be the exactly the same word she would be in the last days oh glory to god hallelujah do you believe that so what the elder says when they say who is worthy to take the book on the loses he's there of he said it was non-worthy they said weep not the land of the tribe of judah has prevailed oh glory to god to take the book isn't that right there was one voice came from the elders saying the four beasts don't reap john oh don't be broken-hearted don't weep for the land of the judah the root of offspring of david has prevailed prevail means to wrestle and overcome and the garden of gethsemane is when the blood dropped down from his face he was overcoming oh glory to god think about that when the bible said revelation in the book of symbols when the bible said the language but judah prevailed it was again in gethsemane he was beaten that devil oh glory to god by accepting the choice to pay the price on our behalf oh that's why we should be praising him tonight that's why we thanking him tonight that's how the book get open that's why we could go back to the book of authority and dominion oh glory to god that's why we could claim our redemptive rights because this son that was worthy he would step forward to pay the price oh glory was a blood price and he had to make that decision oh glory to god hallelujah you have to make your decision oh glory to god i see your loved ones and family delivered do you believe that tonight hallelujah praise god and this is a special quote to me and this is from man running from the presence of lord he was praying there jesus let us tonight in these few words as we wait upon thee as we pray that your grace and mercy will be with us lord tend our hearts move back all the shocks the thorns the tissues let the blessed sunshine of god fall in upon the word lord and may we have such a great meeting until there'll be not an unsafe person among us all the children will be in the kingdom of god those without the baptism of the spirit may they receive it not they are it they may they receive it father may all listen may all the great mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age lord be unveiled to us what's the purpose that we might see the plainness of god what's the purpose so that we know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into the discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the lord jesus have no teaching and explaining and all them thinking inside of that oh hallelujah let me say it again so that we might know watch watch me all the great mysteries which come down as the word of god be read me reveal to us unveil to us that we might see the plainness of god that's the objective when you see the plainness of god that you will know how to behave yourself and act correcting ourselves and bringing bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live to this present day at the approaching of the lord jesus have we done enough oh hallelujah oh praise god amen he said i'm a man there's no good thing in man if a man can open his heart and let god cleanse him god only has hands dear your hands and my hands his eyes is my eyes and your eyes because he's a spirit but he can work through us to manifest and to do his will what god wants to do with the church tonight he wants to do with an individual is to find somebody the holy spirit is searching to find men he can take him out to a certain place speak to that person anoint them and give them something special great powers and gifts to work his will and to do his will oh praise god oh how can he do it when he's constantly has to come up and say oh it's terrible they just run after this they run after error they won't go to church look what condition the church is in so the condition the church is in and all the kind of misbehavior and whatnot god can't put no gifts and powers on that something has to happen to get the church in condition but there's a prophecy hanging over that that the church will come in condition oh glory to god the condition of the word so if god can't do it to the body oh glory to god he will pick out individuals and do it and he said oh god can't send a revival he will take individuals and send a revival on individuals make a revival out to you or give the lord a shout the churches don't want it individuals go get a revival or you are a majority in god give the lord a shout tonight oh hallelujah do you believe that hallelujah but i'm saying all that i am all i ever hope to be i have derived from his grace and mercy i was wretched and miserable and poor and blind and by the grace of god he has healed me and i'm strong and healthy by the grace of god i have good acts i cite i have eat drink whatever i have need of he never promised me to supply my wants my needs and if i am cast away at that day and i cannot see where i would be but if i knew that i was wrong and god was chose me to be wrong i would want to stay wrong and because that i want to do his will i love him till i want his will to be done now that's a big statement but i hope you get it the way the spirit i said it in you see i want to do his will i ask him for something sometime he shakes his head and said no i just rejoice so much about that as if he said yes because we always ought to ask thy will be done oh glory to god do we show our love for god by conducting ourselves with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom sends our way so when god shakes it until you know you could shout and rejoice as if he said yes because you know that no is the will of god oh glory to god when god shut this door you could shout because you know god don't want to go through that door give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah praise god and let me know pick up a pen and write in the last days that bribe will be a super church a super race and so on isn't that right and he said here now they will love him and he they will have his potentials for he is their head and they are subjects to his head his headship notice what harmony jesus never did anything until he seen the father the father showed him that harmony between god and christ ceased in john 5 19 so will be the bride he shows the heroes his word of life he shows up she receives it she never doubt it nothing can harm her not even debt for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up he said i've got a big hallelujah here's the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name nobody can stop the bride from doing oh glory to god what the bride has to do no church no ministers association no bunch of ministers preachers or churches gonna stop that bribe not even the press stop in the bride no government could stop that right that bright is the bride of jesus christ not even lucy for stopping that right oh glory to god not even death don't give the lord a shout tonight not even dead stopping that bride oh hallelujah praise god this is a dead defying bride oh hallelujah praise god we believe that tonight oh think about it now i shall not die but live she does it in his name and she has dusty as the lord okay all right the word is in the bride and then the mind of christ of the wood and the bride and the mind of christ which is charity voice of the archangel hallelujah the super anointing drop down to say what to do with the word oh hallelujah praise god you see the syllabus is the full body of knowledge but it's worth coming for the exam it's what is to be done with the word the bible says jesus found the place where it was written it had other scriptures about jesus too they don't do they saw the light and that all kind of scriptures to read the then zebulun a light has sprung up he could have taken the scripture too but he choose isaiah 61. the spirit is upon me he found his word and you will find your word hallelujah your word will be god's will for your life oh glory to god and this is the part here she has thus saith the lord then it is dramatized so the holy spirit waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose love that hallelujah holy she has dusty at the lord so she speaks the word watch and then it is demonized because his word dramatized a spirit-spoken word and then the holy spirit come and water it and it grows people wanting overnight sometimes they take 30 years to be overnight success oh glory that somebody take 30 years to make the man go to slap up the man and tap up the man and flatten the man for 30 40 years and to get the man ready for our three months ministry or six-month ministry that's the god we serve he's not one day before time oh glory to god joseph couldn't comfort not one day before time he had to stay in prison until the word time come until his time came the word of god try him the lord had to try him that's how god works abraham couldn't come on the 24th yeah he had to wait 25 years go he had to wait no one wait 120 years he had to wait that'll wait in your room and we still have to wait because dynamics is promised and we are stopping short of that go give the lord a shout oh glory to god them the people had to wait 40 years more in egypt for moses to come out on his foolishness hallelujah and when god finished with moses he went on to deliver them oh glory to god time up for pharaoh oh glory to god pharaoh just had an extension until moses get reactivated anointed by pillar of fire sent down to egypt to deliver god's people i don't care what condition your family is right now they're going to be delivered oh glory to god go go activate sons of god in the last days and send them out to deliver them the sick is going to be healed the blind is going to see the death is going to hear the power of god going to strike the church i know you keep hearing that over and over and over but one day we will say this day this night this scripture is fulfilled right in your ears oh god right in your face hallelujah praise god a bride that was veiling god by the word god would take the rap and react take the veil off of that bride and you will see jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever no tabernacle for no man no tavern i could build for no church no more no system it would be christ veiled once more hear him who is it jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh glory to god hallelujah praise god what happened i see this dramatized then it is watered then it is grown the filters and then it serves its purpose oh hallelujah hallelujah oh you're going to serve your purpose and your income to maturity you have to come to maturity to save your purpose oh jesus had to wait down away for 18 years in silence jesus had to sit down and chill he had to sit down and be quiet in church and wait for the appointed time you can't jump up and join the baptist they come yet you have to wait for john can they pay away oh glory to god from a messiah to comfort 18 years has silenced the way to be 30 years old and here come john the baptist anointed on commission from the back side of the desert to introduce messiah oh glory to god and jesus knew the time was at hand for him to step forward to be identified by his witness ministry and when that dynamics came upon him nobody see it but john he saw a dove the one upon whom you see the dove staying and remaining that's the one nobody else saw it and jesus was just walking and led by the spirits into the wilderness to overcome that devil oh glory to god the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and he overcome lucifer by himself in the wilderness without any demonstration of power only it is written it is written to prove you could stay with the word and overcome by the word oh give the lord a shout in the house oh glory to god the anointing was off of him he was tasting the test and facing it without any set of power and he gave the devil a man a bruised face when he finished with him in the wilderness and then the bible said he returned oh glory give the lord a shout at night he returned in the power of the spirit oh glory to god the spirit hit him come on for him send him to the wilderness and come back upon him vindicating about the spirit when and disguise yourself as the word to give the word test to jesus and you overcome the by the word itself it is written it is written it is also written here this big bomb here they do only his will as a bride only israel no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they then they will do the works of god for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete our thing he was here for there was not time yet so he's going to finish the work in his wife oh glory to god so brother brother he was seen here oh my hallelujah oh you love him tonight and then he's talking about adoption he was talking about the purpose is seeing your position in christ seeing it's not something that you just stumble into something that you merited somewhere but it's what god did for you himself not that you were so good and you went to church one night and some porn brother led you to the altar it wasn't that it was god before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life and when you get there that day no wonder 40 24 elders laid on their crowns everybody laid down their crowns everyone fell on their face they didn't have one thing they could say no preacher no elder no nothing all praise to the lamb god will gather in him all things that that day oh if we only know and recognize who he was oh you say we start with the eighth verse wherein he has a boundary towards us in all wisdom and prudence having been known unto us the mystery of israel he's quoted from ephesians the mysteries of israel now remember how we hung onto that how many was here this morning let's see how we stuck on that the mystery of israel no it's not just a little thing then it's a mystery god's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of god for his or herself god's mystery let's go around again god's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of god for his or herself god's mystery so you can't claim god mystery is for you to be in church you have to know why you come to church if all i'm saying now you want deeper than that that you're going to church you want a little more than that what god called you unto because jesus wow i was thinking about that quote where i'm saying the spirit left him in gethsemane i was thinking then all he could rely on of who he was because the anointing but ramos says the help of faith god could drop your anointing upon you and help your faith tonight but real fate is a revelation of who you are so when jesus said uh no man eat of thee he knew who he was he crucified me that's his real fate he he's saying that not because he's feeling it's because of who he is he can speak and that's where the bride will come to that is we're going to blow the pentecostal mind because they might have waited for another thing and thing and doing this and what kind of stinging day and all kind of carrying on but this bribe will just be speaking hallelujah and the authority and the revelation of the faith that is inside of you oh glory to god nothing could stop that you know that's superior that'd be god see that'd be god speaking and you wouldn't be saying in jesus name because it would be you would be in jesus when you speak is his name hallelujah you'll be speaking in his name just the word healed see hallelujah dumb speak that's adopted son that is christ reproduce again you know that is the reproduction of the original grain oh glory to god hallelujah oh praise god you love him tonight hallelujah let's continue my my my my my and when he was um teaching them to pray matthew 6 he said after this manner therefore pray he our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven that's the first thing he said your kingdom come we're expecting that kingdom to come we're letting you know that your will will be done and eat as it is revealed in heaven oh my give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forget we give our debtors and leaders not into temptation but deliver us from all evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever amen for if you forgive men that trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not mend the trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive your trespasses and god put brotherly kindness right at the top right on this age when the prophet said the bride will display the blood of her age so therefore the blood of brotherly kindness will be the voice of the bride's voice in this hour god put it there he put it there and put fear to be there because our heart turned back to the fate of the fathers so right on top of their brotherly kindness and then our fate is based upon forgiveness so it's still come where there has to be a manifestation of destroyed of forgiveness upon a bride that will drive you to forgive and drop your oars and to be humble knowing that faith to pull down the cap the thing to take us out the thing that can't feel faith to do that is based upon this vigorously talking about here so god allow a lot of issues family issues church issues business issues what kind of issues over the years to build up and grow and everything else and people take the going down the road thinking they could go on their own it's not working that way there is one lord there is one feat there is one body all praise the name of the lord do you believe that tonight so jesus did the works of his father because the father was in him that is why the works was done because the father was in the sun do you believe that he was the incarnate god and that god the father which is the father of jesus christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in jesus christ which was the tabernacle of god made flesh and dwelt on earth representing the word and jesus was the word and the bible said the words in john 1 the word was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and when the and then the word become visible and through his sacrificial death at calvary and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual and make the world visible hallelujah i wish my church could get that if you could see it friends the invisible god made visible let's say that part again and through his sacrificial debt at calvary and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual and make the word visible how sin john 15 if he abide in me and my word abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you for when omnipotent speak the miraculous have to take place because omnipotence is god himself so a man can't claim to be veiling this omnipotence and there is no miraculous that doesn't even make sense once omnipotent speak the miraculous must not maybe not perhaps must i want to say must must if omnipotence is speaking which is god the word made flesh that means the spirit itself the father is speaking to the son the word hallelujah must take place oh glory to god that's why jesus could tell his disciples by prophecy and by inspiration the same works that i do shall you do also because it shall come to pass this word will be abiding in you and my father and i at that day you shall know because i am going to come into you and activate the word in you to make you reproduce what i did you're going to do also it is impossible for it not to happen oh glory to god i come to do thy will oh god as it is written of me in the volume of the book and the book was unsealed and the volume has been unveiled that we can know what the will of god is to go and do it oh you say what we see should make a church that will make a revival that people should fly from everywhere saying the seven thunders that are written is being made manifest oh glory to god we have to make a revival a church that will see that they call to make this revival people don't want it they laugh at it that's okay but we're gonna have a bright revival even a seven thunder revival oh glory to god hallelujah i'm almost done believe it or not hallelujah oh god i'm excited tonight i come to the bible of god as a written of me glory to god a prophecy came over the prophet night hallelujah and this is what it was february 11 1961 because that was chosen the narrow path because that was chosen the narrow path the hardaway though was walked of your own choosing oh glory to god when jesus was wrestling with this human spirit if it's possible let this god pass him not once he prayed on his three times he was wrestling it's a choice hallelujah sometimes that choice is not the devil and the devil and the devil is you your choice you're choosing what you decide you want to read where you want to go what you want to say how you want to see your choice before i say because that was chosen the narrow path the harder way that was worked of your own choosing in other words i didn't have to do it i consider and go with them if i want to but i stayed with the word that was picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way hallelujah if you notice it punctuated and underlined if you notice it wrote in french spoken french he said because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee because of what a momentous decision there is power in choice not my will but i will be done there is power in what you choose choose ye tonight who you want to serve you want to serve your own feelings or you want to serve the god of the word because you have to put aside what you feel and what you think to receive and accept what god is saying in his word when that little woman was about to die and the lad we're gonna fix up and you're gonna die elijah said and when she said pick me a cake first he said for those saith the lord the cruise will not go down hallelujah me will not dry up until rain come upon the earth a word was given to her she had was received that word oh glory to god it wasn't like a big week coming and and the flower the person in the home before the flower come and bring to offer she know it wasn't that you know it was god's word jesus take five loaves and two fishes to feed 5 000 people or 3 000 people he had to have faith to believe the power of multiplication the power of blessing the power of the father being able to activate what looked as impossible and they say what are these among so many that jesus didn't even hear he said bring it bless it share it end the story oh how he lived the supernatural life he walked a supernatural life he spoke by faith walk by faith by faith his wife will do the same amen oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god i was wondering when i die what happened having that portion of up there different portions up there have missed the kingdom of heaven that's within us one waits for what a glorious decision that was made glorious glorious hallelujah could imagine god saying what a glorious decision though has me this in itself this decision is what will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine oh glory to god hallelujah this in itself is oh i feel good tonight hallelujah we have stayed with the word god going to vindicate and manifest the same word we stayed with oh glory to god no interpretation no man's idea if we stay with the world he will show a continuation of that word oh glory to god he gonna confirm that word tremendous victory oh that's what i'm looking for tremendous i don't want a survival thing oh god oh you're going who could i survive and no no you know what i don't know about tremendous victory i don't want walking on the heads of devils tremendous victory what gives you pressure you pressure in that tremendous victory you're going back and bringing back spoils from the land that you take tremendous victory you're not cutting and running out cutting no no no you're bringing back what you conquered or give the lord a shout you're bringing back evidence that you trample upon that land all glory that god is there and the going on and the sun shall be of course as you keep walking the sun going down all that is yours if the sun is going wrong that is still yours until the sun goes on that should be a course i see no limits here tonight harley that's what i'm saying i don't know battle outside there you know who won that battle maybe on the whole hallelujah i see no limits at all as to what god called us onto what we are focused on oh hallelujah my hallelujah i'm finishing now you see what coming unto the jordan meant this is the same quote continue coming on to the journal we are
