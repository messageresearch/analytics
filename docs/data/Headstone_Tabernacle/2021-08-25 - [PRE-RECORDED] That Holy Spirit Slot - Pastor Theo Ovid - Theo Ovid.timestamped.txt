[32:39] before that was part of the whole
[32:40] package and so on like that now this is
[32:42] on the seventh seal
[32:44] he said and on that dream too
[32:47] he told the virgin look on it but they
[32:48] were looking at him
[32:50] instead of looking at what he tell them
[32:51] to do he said very few were looking on
[32:54] what he said to look on this i was in
[32:56] something in the pyramid but all the
[32:58] other virgins look and say where did he
[32:59] go where did he go where did he go where
[33:01] did he go and they were looking after
[33:02] him see and that's what end up happening
[33:04] instead of looking at the pyramid
[33:06] they're looking everywhere else
[33:07] praise the name of the lord but but
[33:09] there are some people who keep looking
[33:10] on this
[33:11] that like he said all right
[33:14] so then he was talking about this in the
[33:15] seventh seal he said notice the next
[33:17] thing i took some kind of bar cut it off
[33:20] on the inside was a white rock that had
[33:22] nothing wrote in it and at that time
[33:24] i started to go west and i told them
[33:26] don't go out west stay here and look on
[33:28] this until i returned
[33:30] and went west for the blast return back
[33:32] to the east with the holy spirit
[33:34] interpreting the unwritten word now if
[33:38] that isn't perfectly the god almighty i
[33:40] don't know what is
[33:42] what i am trying to say
[33:45] this
[33:45] for friends
[33:47] is to show you we are at the end time
[33:51] and if them others is perfectly on dot
[33:54] with the word so is this

[34:02] millions will lose their lives we talk
[34:06] about how much people die in america
[34:08] right
[34:09] and just keep climbing with the
[34:10] coronavirus because of poor leadership
[34:13] bad management
[34:14] and there's debt everywhere
[34:16] but that is nothing compared to what's
[34:18] going to happen
[34:19] he said millions will lose their lives
[34:22] millions will be and now believe that
[34:24] they are saved and will be counted
[34:26] further for the atomic age we are living
[34:29] at the last hour and by the grace of
[34:32] almighty god by his help to his people
[34:34] that they might look forward to the soon
[34:36] appearance of christ how long brother

[35:44] come now to anoint sons of man purpose
[35:47] to bring back a ministry just exactly
[35:51] like he said it would be in order for
[35:53] the head and the rest of the body to
[35:56] connect
[35:56] together just like the pyramid has enoch
[35:59] built we find in that pyramid they never
[36:01] did get the headstone on it why the
[36:02] headstone is yet to come the seven steps

[36:12] back there in egypt those stones are
[36:14] laying there so perfect at the top
[36:17] and the top the stone is like a great
[36:19] big diamond and that stone could not fit
[36:22] down there at the bottom of the
[36:23] foundation it will not fit on the second
[36:25] foundation or the tilt foundation it
[36:26] will only fit on the top foundation

[36:31] fit on the top foundation he said
[36:34] abraham faith isn't that right

[49:22] so was the foolish virgins
[49:24] they didn't there was no unbelievers
[49:25] they were believers they just missed the
[49:28] wisdom of revelation to get the extra
[49:30] oil to hit the holy spirit they did
[49:33] not get there they did not stay there
[49:36] oh glory to god in him
[49:38] my god
[49:40] so what he's talking about the holy
[49:41] ghost is the person of christ it's the
[49:44] person of the holy ghost understand this
[49:47] the azusa revival brought many mighty
[49:50] miracles it was god
[49:52] it was the spirit but it didn't have the
[49:55] person
[49:56] it was the anointing it was dynamics but
[49:59] it didn't have the seed oh god do you
[50:01] get that
[50:02] it was god almighty it was the open door
[50:06] there was no messenger there god slammed
[50:08] the door open
[50:10] what caught door god open no mankind
[50:12] shut
[50:13] he said it was the open door and the
[50:15] holy ghost come to that door no man was
[50:18] in control of that it was divine power
[50:20] it was divine unction it was the holy
[50:23] ghost sweeping healing delivering
[50:25] baptizing speaking in tongues
[50:27] supernatural piano playing all kind of
[50:30] manifestation
[50:31] it was god almighty but what we are
[50:34] promised is god himself the word in you
[50:38] being dominated
[50:40] by the spirit itself in the holy
[50:43] spirit's
[50:44] oh give the lord a shout god that's
[50:47] using man he is in the world he put in
[50:49] man
[50:51] what's the
[50:52] secret the word is in the bride go give
[50:55] the lord a shout the pentecostal can't
[50:58] claim that because they are shocked but
[51:00] the word is in you
[51:01] deceiving you
[51:03] what happened son of man come
[51:05] son of man is always a sour showa
[51:07] solomon brings seed
[51:09] that was a perfect bring he brings seed
[51:11] he couldn't release quite quite dynamics
[51:13] where we look back to pentecostal again
[51:14] with all the life without the talking
[51:16] with all the holy ghost without the word
[51:18] with all the mechanics we've been back
[51:20] to pentagons again with a kind of half
[51:22] waiting so god put the word as a seed
[51:25] and say hold that
[51:26] hallelujah dial to that
[51:29] dial to yourself to your flesh i'll
[51:31] cross jordan
[51:32] oh
[51:34] hallelujah glory to god
[51:37] so then
[51:39] you become god's
[51:40] tabernacle or god's house
[51:42] oh here brother branham and there's a
[51:44] man i continue what is it just like the
[51:46] pyramid message you see he went right up
[51:48] this way into the minority with the
[51:50] headstone
[51:51] the ministry of jesus christ
[51:54] oh let me back up a little bit
[51:57] he said when a man in a form jesus
[51:58] making a bell
[51:59] he's got to have a certain tone
[52:02] to put in it
[52:03] and when he is sitting his mole and
[52:05] pouring his iron he puts so much brass
[52:08] so much steel
[52:10] so much copper
[52:12] he knows just exactly how much to put in
[52:14] to give it the right tone
[52:16] and that is what jesus has done to his
[52:18] bride he put in so much looter
[52:21] so much methodist
[52:23] so much presbyterian so much pentecost
[52:25] in it what does he come up with his own
[52:27] perfection
[52:29] so you can eliminate justification and
[52:31] signification but you kindly made all
[52:33] the other things that's what make up the
[52:34] tone
[52:36] if you don't have the ingredients you
[52:38] can get ping
[52:39] when you bear supposed to paint your
[52:41] belgian pong
[52:43] so for you to get the ping
[52:45] you haven't got so much of copper
[52:47] so much a method so much at this so much
[52:49] i tried to hit get the right note
[52:51] are you with me you say what is it just
[52:54] like the proven message you see is
[52:55] keeping right up
[52:57] come to minority with the headstone the
[52:59] ministry of jesus christ on earth
[53:02] has to be here we go
[53:05] the same he had
[53:07] or he can't come to it
[53:09] he is saying they have to be
[53:11] i'll say this way
[53:13] i see what prophecy i i i always say
[53:15] with prophecy it has to be a
[53:17] reproduction
[53:18] of the original grain
[53:22] bringing back the same ministry
[53:24] that jesus had
[53:27] so jesus have to see his own ministry
[53:30] in the church
[53:32] isn't that something
[53:33] does not give me not come join and we
[53:35] hear and rewrite that that you know
[53:37] no they know that at all
[53:40] watch it has to be the same
[53:44] minute as he had
[53:45] or
[53:46] he can't come to it
[53:50] he said just like head to feet the feet
[53:52] is not the head but the head packs the
[53:54] feet you get it
[53:56] where's he with a great light he said
[53:58] yes sir no the dirty rags of yesterday
[54:02] no it just become dirty rags all the
[54:04] time it serves its purpose as clothing
[54:07] now it becomes paper justifications of
[54:10] his time
[54:11] on the looter then it had to become
[54:13] signification to wesley signification
[54:15] save his time till it become the baptism
[54:17] holy ghost and the baptism will go
[54:19] service time until the holy spirit
[54:21] wishes only one god now yeah they tell
[54:24] me use now
[54:25] one god blends
[54:28] into the church
[54:29] and the church
[54:31] into christ and it makes jesus christ
[54:34] reflected on the earth as he promised
[54:36] you in the bible
[54:37] so he's talking about blending now
[54:39] remember we're going to say we're going
[54:40] to take up those words blend and honed
[54:43] so now the holy spirit has to come to
[54:45] blend into the church
[54:50] call yourselves
[54:52] i don't beat it
[54:54] you don't just drop an egg on your egg
[54:55] blend it yeah
[54:57] whisk it
[55:00] so if god had to blend the holy spirit
[55:02] he has to do some whisking
[55:09] if you don't want this with skin thingy
[55:11] you don't want to blend
[55:13] because afterwards you have to be
[55:14] blending with the anointing
[55:16] then the anointing becomes part of you
[55:18] and part of it you can live without it
[55:21] is part of your life
[55:22] part of your walk your talk holiness
[55:25] becomes part of your rhythm part of your
[55:27] speech your action your attitude your
[55:29] life
[55:30] [Music]
[55:33] my my mind
[55:35] now what shall we say here now
[55:39] the church constantly getting the
[55:40] minority with greater powers
[55:42] when the enemy become like a flood based
[55:44] on the sign of the time new york
[55:46] the enemy raises the standard
[55:48] when they spend the enemy come like a
[55:49] flood rather the spirit of god would
[55:51] raise a standard against it no we have
[55:53] left the pentecostal age
[55:55] i guess this is prophecy present
[55:58] now we are coming
[56:00] to where like in the pyramid not pyramid
[56:02] doctrine now but i mean like as the
[56:04] pyramid the headstone
[56:07] when it comes to fit
[56:09] it's got to be honed
[56:13] there's got to be a ministry in the
[56:15] church the true church of the living god
[56:17] to where when the headstone comes
[56:20] christ
[56:22] or the ministry of christ will fit right
[56:24] in together
[56:26] then that brings back the redeemed
[56:29] to take the whole house of god to glory
[56:31] the methodist the baptist but through
[56:33] the great revelations that come out and
[56:35] give their lives and persecution and
[56:36] things for the kingdom of god but that
[56:38] stone is coming
[56:39] so in other words you say we must come
[56:42] to perfection to bring the resurrection
[56:43] that is true but remember christ does
[56:45] all three
[56:46] the shout
[56:48] the voice
[56:49] and the trump
[56:50] is not pastor teacher evans is doing
[56:52] that it's christ doing all three
[56:55] he produced the shout he produced a
[56:57] voice he produced the trump
[57:00] isn't that right but they've got to have
[57:01] a ministry christ's own spirit in the
[57:04] church that he could come down and blend
[57:06] into it to do that
[57:08] all glory to god that's why we've got to
[57:10] come to perfection hallelujah that last
[57:13] step and that's where we continue from
[57:15] the last service last wednesday oh glory
[57:17] to god
[57:18] are you with me now he said under luther
[57:20] was the same holy spirit justification
[57:22] then signification then about the holy
[57:24] spirit he said not three steps of grace
[57:27] but three stations notice when a baby is
[57:30] born they are treating that constitutes
[57:31] a birth isn't that right water blood and
[57:35] spirit the elements that come from his
[57:38] body to make his body it comes from his
[57:41] body is the material to make his bride
[57:44] so water blood spirit
[57:46] is the material to make
[57:49] the bride
[57:50] not word only
[57:51] no no no don't come with that don't try
[57:54] that
[57:55] don't try that it's easy because you
[57:56] study long
[57:57] it's easy because you study hard but
[57:59] there's not
[58:01] you see men just
[58:02] go against the spirit because the spirit
[58:06] does put them out of control
[58:10] jesus said when the spirit is come he
[58:12] will guide you into all truth so he must
[58:15] take man out of the way
[58:17] because the spirit is what taken the
[58:19] whole love
[58:20] oh glory to god i meant the one that
[58:21] because men want to be in church
[58:23] but god sent the holy ghost to be in
[58:25] church
[58:26] oh glory to god holy ghost two gifted
[58:28] men holy ghost true men god using men
[58:31] people think i don't believe god has
[58:32] used men no no no god of jews man holy
[58:35] ghost using men
[58:36] oh hallelujah but the man spirit is a
[58:38] defending altogether i spirit a man
[58:40] trying to dominate the church that's
[58:42] nicolette and spirit now by spirit
[58:44] conquering the laity by mental and
[58:47] intellectual and demonic and political
[58:49] power oh glory to god and we get
[58:51] delivered over that the church the
[58:52] church got busted god god come to redeem
[58:54] yourself after that and he said his
[58:56] church will never go back into that they
[58:57] will mind handle church but never the
[58:59] bribe
[59:00] every bright member will be delivered by
[59:02] the spirit of the living god
[59:03] because you you come from god
[59:05] oh glory you come from that
[59:07] you come from that source hallelujah you
[59:10] come from that element that where your
[59:11] gene belong
[59:13] oh no pastor hole in your gene that's
[59:15] nonsense
[59:16] no pastor of the key to your life that
[59:18] is foolishness or give the lord a shout
[59:21] the god who call you is able to the one
[59:23] that started working you was able to
[59:24] finish it
[59:26] and i challenge you to see any pastor
[59:27] started working you that's a lie is god
[59:30] that stopped the work in you the same
[59:32] one that called you i don't care what
[59:34] conditioning he called you out to that
[59:36] for what purpose to be jacob grace no
[59:39] they committed to perfection that the
[59:41] holy ghost could strike his soul
[59:43] hallelujah upon that fourth foundation
[59:46] oh give the lord a shout
[59:49] hallelujah hallelujah and when christ
[59:52] died there was three elements that came
[59:54] out of his body water blood and spirit
[59:56] justification to believe in water
[59:59] signification through the blood and the
[1:00:01] baptism holy spirit and here we go and
[1:00:04] this is where we closed off last week
[1:00:06] now this last great step
[1:00:08] must come to perfection that the holy
[1:00:11] spirit
[1:00:12] has to live in the church
[1:00:14] so perfectly
[1:00:15] do you get it tonight that's the holy
[1:00:18] spirit's shirt
[1:00:19] come along and walk on brotherly
[1:00:21] kindness no brotherly kindness the holy
[1:00:23] spirit or give the lord a shout
[1:00:25] my god how i could run out of the church
[1:00:27] right now
[1:00:28] i could run around the building and come
[1:00:30] back up now
[1:00:31] no brotherly kindness the holy spirit
[1:00:34] when you stand praying for the holy
[1:00:36] ghost when you stand praying for charity
[1:00:39] when you stand praying for that super
[1:00:40] anointed forgive
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:47] forgive
[1:00:51] whatever see that you know
[1:00:54] they're not teaching them i have a
[1:00:56] teaching tonight in burlingame
[1:01:01] that level channel
[1:01:03] when brother branham was condemning the
[1:01:04] woman in the restaurant and got tapping
[1:01:06] on his shoulder and said i forgive
[1:01:08] yourself would you condemn
[1:01:11] and he had to go and repent and he got a
[1:01:12] woman restored when the people was
[1:01:14] making love in church and rosemary drop
[1:01:16] down and tell him death death whatever
[1:01:17] you say will happen and he said i
[1:01:19] forgive you
[1:01:21] and he said hold me was please
[1:01:23] because you see you have to show god's
[1:01:24] kindness
[1:01:26] the way god does think
[1:01:27] the way god does feel they call the
[1:01:29] woman and adultery and said this one was
[1:01:31] caught in the very act and the lord
[1:01:33] wanted moses toner
[1:01:35] and jesus said which one among you
[1:01:36] without sin cast the first stone
[1:01:39] and jesus himself had no sin and he
[1:01:41] didn't curse
[1:01:42] all empty believe he said here do i
[1:01:43] condemn thee
[1:01:45] go and sin no more
[1:01:46] who could do that by the power of love
[1:01:48] who could do that by the spirit of
[1:01:49] forgiveness who could do that by the
[1:01:51] power of reconciliation and that's what
[1:01:53] god come to reconcile sinners unto
[1:01:55] himself
[1:01:56] then we have to be like god oh glory to
[1:01:58] god to express god's kindness
[1:02:01] oh god to the weak ones and of some of
[1:02:03] compassion
[1:02:05] making a difference
[1:02:06] to those who are weak in the flesh from
[1:02:08] brute priests oh give the lord some
[1:02:10] praises tonight
[1:02:12] the way i shout in the house
[1:02:18] [Applause]
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:32] they rejected the stone to the pyramid
[1:02:34] cut off to the mountain without without
[1:02:36] hands god centered do you see it the
[1:02:38] rejected one
[1:02:39] the rejected one is the head of the
[1:02:41] church the head the capstone and the
[1:02:43] very one that they rejected through this
[1:02:45] gentile is christ and christ was not cut
[1:02:48] and put there by as a vicar or son of
[1:02:49] god or some great dignitary to church he
[1:02:52] is the holy spirit and the cap of the
[1:02:56] pyramid will be christ coming
[1:02:59] amen so lovee
[1:03:01] christ coming
[1:03:03] and the holy spirit is what's coming to
[1:03:05] us
[1:03:07] to prepare for l.o.v
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:15] now watch i've got this shape like a
[1:03:17] pyramid the horizon of the saints makes
[1:03:19] the match to glory christ the headstone
[1:03:22] the rejected stone the all-seeing eye
[1:03:25] and daniel have you watched the gentile
[1:03:26] age until the stone come up with the
[1:03:28] mountains wasn't cut without hands they
[1:03:30] never put a capsule on that pyramid it
[1:03:32] wasn't cut off by man's hands it's god
[1:03:35] hand that cut that stone
[1:03:36] so when you talk about capstone now
[1:03:38] which is the seal of the building man in
[1:03:41] charge of that but i'm saying we do all
[1:03:43] that we can do that's the mechanics but
[1:03:45] only gorkas and dynamics so man god
[1:03:47] didn't give the right of man to dynamics
[1:03:50] he's in charge of that but you take
[1:03:52] faith to connect with that because faith
[1:03:54] could pull along the power of god and
[1:03:55] faith is based on
[1:03:57] forgiveness if there's no forgiveness
[1:03:58] there's no real faith because the faith
[1:04:00] was that he sent a prophet to the hearts
[1:04:02] back what to the fate of the father is
[1:04:04] to pull along what the holy ghost the
[1:04:06] power to get into the holy ghost
[1:04:08] you cannot get in that slot by mental up
[1:04:11] ability is by faith you have to get
[1:04:12] there
[1:04:13] so it's a holy ghost send the prophet
[1:04:15] the holy ghost say behold i send you
[1:04:16] elijah to give fate into your system to
[1:04:19] connect back with the power because you
[1:04:21] need power to enter in you need power to
[1:04:23] break through the strong barrier to get
[1:04:25] into rapturing condition oh god lord
[1:04:28] help me tonight did you hear what i'm
[1:04:30] saying you need power to get into
[1:04:31] wrapping condition before the astronauts
[1:04:34] go out there they have to have a
[1:04:35] rehearsal down here oh glory to god they
[1:04:37] have to have a place where they have
[1:04:39] zero gravity to float and whatnot
[1:04:41] because that's the atmosphere up there
[1:04:43] and before we leave here oh glory to god
[1:04:45] we have to have an atmosphere down here
[1:04:47] which is the spirit of christ in the
[1:04:48] church that's why he said there will be
[1:04:50] a church with jesus christ walking in it
[1:04:53] the shout of the king will be in the
[1:04:55] camp
[1:04:55] oh i'm so excited tonight we have a lot
[1:04:58] to live for we have a lot to look
[1:05:00] forward for
[1:05:01] oh glory to god if we move into the
[1:05:03] temple a great ministry lies ahead
[1:05:06] oh give the lord a shout i ain't dead at
[1:05:08] all
[1:05:10] i'm not back singing hallelujah i'm on
[1:05:12] fire for god this is what i'm looking
[1:05:14] for since 1975.
[1:05:17] oh god a church in order oh glory to god
[1:05:20] at church and expectation a church cut
[1:05:23] off from the world and the things of the
[1:05:24] world we'll give him some praises
[1:05:26] tonight
[1:05:27] hallelujah
[1:05:29] hallelujah
[1:05:30] christ is that stone he wasn't born of a
[1:05:33] man he was born of god he is coming for
[1:05:36] a church that has been reborn again by
[1:05:38] the spirit of god because the strength
[1:05:41] of that headstone runs through the
[1:05:43] church like a magnet
[1:05:44] so i remember about watching the mill
[1:05:46] and the time they were shaping and a big
[1:05:48] stone come all that scrap of metal in
[1:05:50] there and a big magnet won't pick up it
[1:05:52] all because it was magnetized it we have
[1:05:55] got to be magnetized to the headstone
[1:05:57] not some person or some bishop not some
[1:05:58] man of the hour not so many son of man
[1:06:00] who is the man of the hour and all that
[1:06:02] nonsense you have to be mannerised to
[1:06:04] the headstone
[1:06:05] who glory to god to who
[1:06:07] had stolen
[1:06:09] say it again
[1:06:10] the headstone that's where to be
[1:06:12] magnetized to not the church
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:15] not this church
[1:06:17] hallelujah the headstone which is christ
[1:06:20] the holy spirit the word hallelujah
[1:06:23] we have got to be manchester headstone
[1:06:25] that headstone is the holy ghost
[1:06:28] oh glory to god that headstone is
[1:06:31] the holy ghost christ and when every one
[1:06:33] of us that got the magnetism of the holy
[1:06:35] ghost when that stone strike the image
[1:06:37] the church will flee to it
[1:06:38] back into glory
[1:06:40] she'll be taken up
[1:06:41] in the rapture of the saints
[1:06:44] my god seriously there's a time you say
[1:06:48] might be closer than you think that's
[1:06:49] got me steered time shall be no more he
[1:06:52] announces that time is over what happens
[1:06:54] what happens could that be so my
[1:06:55] brethren seriously think if it is then
[1:06:57] the pyramid is capped
[1:06:59] by the seven thunders
[1:07:00] oh
[1:07:01] they mean that pyramid down there that
[1:07:03] holy ghost is very tough this is
[1:07:05] that
[1:07:06] that's right
[1:07:07] that's where the sun does at
[1:07:09] oh hallelujah if that be so
[1:07:12] then the pyramid is capped by voices
[1:07:15] what the devil couldn't know
[1:07:16] what the devil can't handle
[1:07:18] oh glory to god the rainbow inside
[1:07:20] the deer joseph rainbow caught inside
[1:07:23] the deer oh glory the father loved that
[1:07:25] son called joseph give him a robe of
[1:07:27] many colors and he'd given the church a
[1:07:29] robe of many colors how else could we

[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:06] glory
[1:08:07] the bridge of god was already breathed
[1:08:09] upon him
[1:08:10] received the holy ghost
[1:08:12] he had just openly understanding of the
[1:08:13] scriptures and opened the understanding
[1:08:15] of the word he breathed on them
[1:08:18] it was the breath of god upon them he
[1:08:20] gave them a promise behold i send you
[1:08:22] the promise of my father no promise i
[1:08:24] don't minister the promise of my father
[1:08:27] tiring the seat of jerusalem until
[1:08:29] you'll be doing power from on high not
[1:08:31] paul from some church not far from some
[1:08:34] connection that's almost a minister who
[1:08:36] knows more than everybody else power
[1:08:37] from on high the on high part of the
[1:08:39] path oh glory to god only god could
[1:08:42] bring along that part the unhide part
[1:08:44] they don't know how it's coming they
[1:08:46] don't know when it's coming they didn't
[1:08:47] know what time it coming all in all it

[1:08:51] was fully come there was in one mind

[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:23] seriously think
[1:10:25] about a georgia minister that seriously
[1:10:26] think at all
[1:10:28] he said seriously think they should take
[1:10:30] it serious
[1:10:31] then the pyramid capability 700 this
[1:10:32] should get serious because the tunnels
[1:10:34] is the capstone where am i at
[1:10:36] oh i can go raptor without thunders
[1:10:40] and thomas is the cap
[1:10:42] so therefore the cap of revelation and
[1:10:44] manifestation then exactly
[1:10:46] exactly
[1:10:48] mechanics and dynamics then
[1:10:50] oh
[1:10:50] you mean just like enoch
[1:10:52] his mechanics became dynamics
[1:10:54] oh yeah the words that i speak unto you
[1:10:57] they are spirit
[1:10:59] and they are life
[1:11:00] you mean the word is spirit
[1:11:02] yes
[1:11:03] holy spirit slapped
[1:11:05] is the same word
[1:11:07] turn into spirit
[1:11:08] making that the kingdom of god in you oh
[1:11:12] glory to god
[1:11:13] hallelujah do you see it tonight behold
[1:11:17] the kingdom is within you
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:34] we continue
[1:11:35] you say you remember the pyramid message
[1:11:38] it is the caption
[1:11:40] what did it do
[1:11:43] the holy spirit
[1:11:45] capped off the individual
[1:11:48] and sealed it
[1:11:49] when we added our faith
[1:11:51] righteousness
[1:11:52] godliness kept adding till we got seven
[1:11:55] things and the seventh one was love
[1:11:57] which is god and that is how he makes
[1:11:59] the individual
[1:12:00] and caps him
[1:12:02] and seals him with the holy spirit
[1:12:05] oh glory to god where is that holy
[1:12:06] spirit that seal is that between l-o-v-e
[1:12:10] and brotherly love
[1:12:12] holy spirit's isn't that right
[1:12:14] and that word is the word from luther
[1:12:16] wesley paul arenas martin columba luta
[1:12:19] all the word to the ages which was the
[1:12:22] scattered word
[1:12:23] he put all that word
[1:12:25] and put it inside of you
[1:12:27] and put a pyramid inside of you
[1:12:29] it's the pyramid of your life
[1:12:32] in mechanic form
[1:12:34] that's the secret
[1:12:36] the entire pyramid is a seed
[1:12:38] put inside of you
[1:12:40] hallelujah
[1:12:42] then if that be so brother branham he
[1:12:44] got seven church ages
[1:12:46] that is immune
[1:12:48] and he had seven mysteries that had been
[1:12:50] summoned away and they fought for to
[1:12:51] bring back that he knew
[1:12:54] and now the heads don't come the cap of
[1:12:55] the church does the thunders mean that
[1:13:01] so what in you
[1:13:03] is what god's seen to keep
[1:13:05] now the cap can't come down unto
[1:13:07] brotherly kindness
[1:13:10] the capital come down holy spirit
[1:13:13] these stones have to be called out
[1:13:16] to be fitted
[1:13:17] into the holy spirit slot
[1:13:19] because it's from dear you will be
[1:13:21] raptured
[1:13:22] because in there you find heavily places
[1:13:25] and there you find another ephesians
[1:13:27] is there you find super church super
[1:13:29] race
[1:13:30] has been near the headstone oh glory
[1:13:33] come on now
[1:13:34] as we need a headstone
[1:13:36] superchurch nowhere
[1:13:39] in the holy spirit
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:47] isn't that what the god tell the prophet
[1:13:49] pick up a pen and write as the bride
[1:13:51] near the headstone she will be a super
[1:13:53] race a super church what he's talking
[1:13:55] about he's talking about holy spirit
[1:13:57] he's not talking about brotherly
[1:13:58] kindness he's not what you in the same
[1:14:00] spirit of christ was
[1:14:02] oh glory to god the works of christ
[1:14:05] saint john 14 12 the same was i do shall
[1:14:08] you do also you can erase that you can't
[1:14:10] change that that is still the word
[1:14:13] all glory of god has to be fulfilled
[1:14:16] or in a bride
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:25] nobody burn him
[1:14:26] and blasphemous name
[1:14:28] he was saying
[1:14:30] he said when you say automobile
[1:14:32] he said no i'm not a mechanic
[1:14:34] it's got to be plugs and coils and balls
[1:14:36] and valves and everything else so when
[1:14:38] you talk about baptism of the holy
[1:14:40] spirit
[1:14:42] there's a lot that goes with that
[1:14:44] so he's comparing the battle he goes
[1:14:46] with the same automobile
[1:14:48] a different kind that manually have
[1:14:50] automatic
[1:14:52] walking thinking of door trunk back
[1:14:54] we have
[1:14:56] this world called automobile
[1:14:58] so when i talk about baptism he said a
[1:15:00] lot of things goes with it
[1:15:02] okay he said no peter said first fate
[1:15:04] now what are you close
[1:15:05] faith now to your faith then you add
[1:15:07] virtue and temperance and so on like
[1:15:09] that and love and i even know love is
[1:15:11] god now
[1:15:12] then bringing this into the seventh
[1:15:13] church ages god is building in
[1:15:16] seventeenth ages are bright for christ
[1:15:18] so this was the structure of building a
[1:15:20] bride
[1:15:21] that is the ages
[1:15:23] of the state
[1:15:24] dispensation then
[1:15:27] and the same way he built the ages he
[1:15:29] built you
[1:15:33] he can't break his principles
[1:15:35] he can't break his laws
[1:15:37] he was building a bride
[1:15:38] under the nose of satan
[1:15:42] because all these messengers were hidden
[1:15:45] in the seals
[1:15:47] it only said white torch reduced a loss
[1:15:49] black horse and so on but these
[1:15:50] messengers was hidden under the land
[1:15:52] anointing ox anointing man anointed
[1:15:54] eagle anointing
[1:15:55] they were hidden behind here to call out
[1:15:57] the elect
[1:16:00] devil totally blindsided
[1:16:02] because in every age the elect was
[1:16:04] called out and sealed away
[1:16:07] this is the first elect satan have to
[1:16:10] deal with it
[1:16:12] mano amano man to man
[1:16:15] he had to deal with this bride because
[1:16:17] this bride was sent in satan's eden to
[1:16:20] defeat him
[1:16:23] do you hear that tonight
[1:16:25] did you get that tonight
[1:16:27] [Applause]
[1:16:31] this
[1:16:33] will be such a defeat
[1:16:34] that when he look for the price he's
[1:16:36] raptured
[1:16:38] and the devil will be so upset
[1:16:40] he will make war with the remnant of the
[1:16:43] woman's seed which is the church members
[1:16:45] in this message i call them the
[1:16:47] tribulation saints that hearing message
[1:16:50] preached tonight
[1:16:53] around the world
[1:16:55] without real revelation
[1:17:00] because they ever went in scott's eden
[1:17:03] and trade on god's bride
[1:17:04] and god waited
[1:17:06] until they have the highest technology
[1:17:08] the highest amount of sin highest among
[1:17:10] our loss and sex and filth and
[1:17:12] pornography you name it a day is there
[1:17:14] and it's having a clean pure virtual
[1:17:16] sinless brain
[1:17:18] going to come out in this age
[1:17:20] and prove to the devil
[1:17:22] prove to satan
[1:17:24] she's not like eve
[1:17:26] oh glory to god she's not only staying
[1:17:27] behind the world you know she will
[1:17:29] become the word itself
[1:17:31] and the same voltage power that satan
[1:17:33] felt when jill well it is written
[1:17:36] is the same power you will feel this
[1:17:37] bride because this bride will be
[1:17:39] extension of jesus christ
[1:17:41] what jesus began to do and continue to
[1:17:44] do what she just began to do and
[1:17:46] continue to do she's going to write
[1:17:49] another book of acts or give the lord a
[1:17:52] shout it will be the acts of the holy
[1:17:54] spirit
[1:17:56] oh glory to god that same holy spirit
[1:17:58] slot
[1:17:59] from dear
[1:18:00] acts of the holy spirit
[1:18:03] write another book of acts
[1:18:05] hallelujah who there to guide you who
[1:18:08] they tell some man some bishop some pope
[1:18:10] the holy ghost itself
[1:18:12] my god
[1:18:16] my lord my lord my lord
[1:18:19] glory to god
[1:18:21] he has built a bride born a bride
[1:18:23] begotten a bride on earth for christ and
[1:18:25] the same way he bears his bride he has
[1:18:27] begotten individuals
[1:18:28] so our sister shepard had a dream
[1:18:31] and the dream was she was wondering lord
[1:18:32] if i have got the holy ghost can you
[1:18:34] prove to me some safe i shouted he said
[1:18:37] watch you said she saw she dreamed this
[1:18:39] dream and baram saw the dream that's how
[1:18:40] you can interpret it
[1:18:42] she dreamed her dream she was up on a
[1:18:43] mountain in this mountain
[1:18:45] it was a rock box her husband was behind
[1:18:47] her she saw a large man standing there
[1:18:49] with work clothes on sleeves rolled up
[1:18:51] bailing the most pure water that she'd
[1:18:53] ever seen pouring it into this box this
[1:18:54] rock box
[1:18:56] setting up the mountain and the rock box
[1:18:57] could not hold the water it rolled right
[1:18:59] out there just boiled up the trash and
[1:19:01] sticks and everything in there ball it
[1:19:03] out rolling up the mountain roll over
[1:19:04] her feet she was standing right in that
[1:19:06] stuff only didn't stick to her
[1:19:08] then she asked why the box didn't hold
[1:19:10] it
[1:19:11] the man said that is not water
[1:19:13] that's the holy ghost
[1:19:16] that's nothing will hold it
[1:19:21] he said he went back and got another big
[1:19:22] bucket
[1:19:23] it was full of honey
[1:19:25] and poured the honey into deer and he
[1:19:28] said no it would hold this
[1:19:30] and she taught the box the rock box was
[1:19:32] going to burst out and spill the honey
[1:19:34] but it didn't
[1:19:35] it finally stuck together and held it
[1:19:37] she turned and went down the mountain
[1:19:38] going down the mountain she stopped on
[1:19:40] the bottom of the mountain and looked
[1:19:41] back she saw five streams of pure
[1:19:43] crystal water not contaminated by the
[1:19:45] things that had been through still pure
[1:19:47] clear coming swiftly then it slowed up
[1:19:49] then almost feed it out and she was
[1:19:51] wondering would it ever reach the bottom
[1:19:52] of the mountain five streams that she
[1:19:54] woke up
[1:19:55] so but the brandon began to interpret
[1:19:56] the rock box his rock confession upon
[1:19:59] this rock blessed also amber jonah
[1:20:01] uh but my upon this rock i'll build my
[1:20:04] church he said no that has been each
[1:20:05] church age hasn't had a rock confession
[1:20:07] which is a rock revelation right so
[1:20:09] there's a revelation that what when the
[1:20:11] whole stuff okay he's not you cannot
[1:20:13] make a holy church one two there's no
[1:20:15] such thing as the holy church or hold on
[1:20:16] tradition right three the holy spirit
[1:20:19] can be preached in it but in dear you
[1:20:20] find good bad renegades and different
[1:20:22] than everything else
[1:20:24] so somebody judging the church by one
[1:20:25] member is foolishness
[1:20:28] because in the church you find let me
[1:20:29] say it again good bad renegades and
[1:20:31] indifferent let me say that again
[1:20:34] it just see this unseen that no
[1:20:36] we call them scenes we call them
[1:20:38] brothers and this he said in the church
[1:20:40] you find good bad renegades and
[1:20:41] indifferent
[1:20:44] places that tree cannot believers
[1:20:47] and everything else so an organization
[1:20:49] will not hold it you can't say
[1:20:52] and i don't understand how believers
[1:20:53] could read these things and see the
[1:20:55] foolishness
[1:20:56] you can't say we got it none of the rest
[1:20:59] of them has it
[1:21:02] so when people in their churches believe
[1:21:04] they own their pastor or their group or
[1:21:06] their only channel of god and and people
[1:21:09] come to them to hear it and to see it
[1:21:10] and whatnot this is
[1:21:12] it is contrary he said you can't say
[1:21:15] that
[1:21:17] he said you can't say that
[1:21:20] if anybody say hear that they will hear
[1:21:22] from me
[1:21:24] don't let me hear you say that reading
[1:21:26] whispered
[1:21:27] don't let her come back in my ears you
[1:21:28] know
[1:21:29] he said you can't
[1:21:31] say that
[1:21:34] you know some spirits they hear that
[1:21:36] but they want to see that you know
[1:21:38] because they're feeling led
[1:21:40] the holy feeling is bad
[1:21:42] it's sitting upon the middle
[1:21:44] jesus jesus jesus be the boy don't worry
[1:21:46] the christ i'm not living god just had
[1:21:47] to be crucified no no no he said get
[1:21:49] behind me satan sit and jump on him
[1:21:51] right after
[1:21:53] you can't
[1:21:54] see that
[1:21:55] all right none of the rest of them have
[1:21:57] no sir the holy spirit is part of the
[1:21:59] individuals
[1:22:00] so tonight people hearing us tonight
[1:22:02] could holy speak about that in their
[1:22:04] house
[1:22:06] they don't even have to be in church
[1:22:11] glory
[1:22:12] because the holy ghost is poured out on
[1:22:14] individuals
[1:22:21] i tell you when he was young he messaged
[1:22:23] and i read what i'm saying one is a
[1:22:24] majority in god i wear them my knees and
[1:22:26] say lord i'm a majority
[1:22:28] are we going to pray for stuff yes why i
[1:22:29] say won the majority i feel like a real
[1:22:31] big majority
[1:22:32] one is the majority and goes in them
[1:22:34] oh glory to god now in this church the
[1:22:37] message the message is being poured into
[1:22:39] the church
[1:22:40] this tabernacle we see here she comes to
[1:22:42] church this tabernacle is not a holy
[1:22:45] ghost tabernacle there is no
[1:22:47] such a thing
[1:22:49] individuals that come into this church
[1:22:51] is holy ghost tabernacles
[1:22:53] they are tabernacles that contain the
[1:22:55] holy ghost but not the church therefore
[1:22:57] it runs out
[1:23:00] so you take a bucket of holy ghost it
[1:23:02] pours into the church it goes sweep all
[1:23:03] the trash fill people individuals by
[1:23:06] going right through
[1:23:07] the church can hold it like how some
[1:23:09] people like if they're renting the angel
[1:23:11] they say the angel with his brother the
[1:23:13] angel with his pastor and people
[1:23:15] fighting the angel of the lord like the
[1:23:16] angels have a rental apartment in the
[1:23:18] church and you have a sexual rejection
[1:23:20] he just living there
[1:23:25] yeah the injured apartment
[1:23:28] yes he has a new scripture he isn't
[1:23:29] really prophet but he enjoyed this one
[1:23:31] and he wrote that one and when they hear
[1:23:33] what they're speaking you could know
[1:23:34] that angel is with them you know but not
[1:23:35] the issue of the lord
[1:23:37] i don't know what name i don't know
[1:23:38] where he comes from but it's certainly
[1:23:39] not from heaven it's not the israel it's
[1:23:41] somebody in general because the india
[1:23:42] being in revelation they're not in
[1:23:44] scriptures not in the message they call
[1:23:46] it hidden mysteries
[1:23:48] hidden from god and all right
[1:23:50] hidden from hearing from the prophet the
[1:23:52] brother didn't reveal it
[1:23:53] see god sent a prophet to reveal all the
[1:23:55] mysteries
[1:23:56] and if a man preaching a mystery now
[1:23:57] that i can't find any word he only own
[1:24:00] and people like that become man invented
[1:24:02] you know they're saying something
[1:24:03] prophet didn't see you know i mean fresh
[1:24:05] they find this is boring i only say in
[1:24:07] bad things a man say years ago why think
[1:24:10] we're reading scripture
[1:24:14] look how long genesis is written
[1:24:16] but you know moses didn't reinvent that
[1:24:18] oh gosh i feel like in the
[1:24:20] beginning was the word or the
[1:24:21] beginning moses just screamed that
[1:24:23] because he takes some marijuana and some
[1:24:25] ganja and something going to his head is
[1:24:28] god spoke to him and we take that as
[1:24:31] dusty at the lord
[1:24:32] holy men move as they were moved by the
[1:24:34] holy ghost
[1:24:35] this is the written word
[1:24:37] that's why the prophet said the spirit
[1:24:38] and the brave prophet will say the same
[1:24:40] thing i'm not embarrassed about this
[1:24:42] message i'm not embarrassed about this
[1:24:43] word i don't have to bring my own
[1:24:45] revelation and my own interpretation and
[1:24:47] my own explanation
[1:24:50] i am locked in
[1:24:52] my job is to find promises to preach
[1:24:54] and i'm preaching to you tonight the
[1:24:56] holy spirit shot is where you belong
[1:24:59] is where you are to aim at is where you
[1:25:02] are to press out
[1:25:09] the man was born in the water was the
[1:25:11] messenger to the church
[1:25:12] pouring a message to the church and the
[1:25:14] water was doing it was boiling all the
[1:25:16] trash that was in it
[1:25:18] that is what the holy spirit does
[1:25:20] and i'm talking about revival revivals
[1:25:21] they're getting trash out of the church
[1:25:22] people but no revival they're a bunch of
[1:25:24] stinkness all weed walking i will pan
[1:25:26] all kind of nonsense inside the church
[1:25:28] and sing a message song on top of that
[1:25:32] as if mr strong's revival
[1:25:34] i said that intellectual songs
[1:25:36] no juice in it no anointing in it no
[1:25:38] atmosphere in it and that's supposed to
[1:25:39] be message
[1:25:42] because you have things and messages in
[1:25:44] it
[1:25:45] yeah
[1:25:47] it's good for information but not for
[1:25:48] inspiration
[1:25:50] informational songs
[1:25:52] we need inspiration song
[1:25:54] listen daniel couldn't uh david couldn't
[1:25:56] play a message song for saul you know
[1:25:58] that spread upon stolen moving messages
[1:26:00] he had a prayer inspirational song
[1:26:02] he had praying because you know devil
[1:26:04] casting knowledge of the atmosphere his
[1:26:06] devil is upon the man when david
[1:26:08] presents his music so it bring an
[1:26:10] atmosphere is the atmosphere to run them
[1:26:12] devils even them difference in your home
[1:26:14] will take your atmosphere you can all
[1:26:15] come out there will come whatever what
[1:26:16] spiritually you have atmosphere you
[1:26:19] create that atmosphere you come to
[1:26:21] church to get connected to atmosphere
[1:26:22] now when you go back in your house that
[1:26:24] atmosphere could vibrate over you you
[1:26:26] know it coming off of you
[1:26:28] oh glory to god is the atmosphere
[1:26:31] hallelujah could we give the lord a
[1:26:33] shout
[1:26:34] glory hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:37] glory hallelujah
[1:26:38] so therefore the message is pure it's
[1:26:40] pure word it will boil the trash out and
[1:26:43] even in pasture kind of crazy stuff and
[1:26:45] all kind interpretation is still pure
[1:26:47] uncontaminated
[1:26:49] it's still written
[1:26:50] it's still there we can still say what
[1:26:52] he tapes see
[1:26:53] we forget all the way into position it's
[1:26:55] still here
[1:26:56] no you see my i do like brother
[1:26:58] so-and-so or brother jones i don't like
[1:26:59] brother son so he said but let something
[1:27:01] happen to that brother
[1:27:03] your heart is broke nearly killed you we
[1:27:05] can't obtain burly kindness and fearing
[1:27:07] for one another
[1:27:09] but to maintain a group and so on so
[1:27:11] he's talking about
[1:27:12] um you know that that forgiveness then
[1:27:15] isn't a group you're getting that that's
[1:27:16] what could hold in the church
[1:27:18] brotherly kind of spirit of forgiveness
[1:27:20] see so that is why we stress we strive
[1:27:22] for that
[1:27:23] because that is what the holy spirit is
[1:27:24] coming down upon
[1:27:26] the atmosphere of brotherly kindness
[1:27:28] spirit of forgiveness i like that i'm
[1:27:30] not teaching a very kind i say people
[1:27:32] teach that and explain that we're in
[1:27:33] brotherly kindness but we can't break
[1:27:35] they just talk
[1:27:36] we're talking about the spirit of
[1:27:38] spirit of
[1:27:40] forgiveness
[1:27:41] you see when that comes husband forgive
[1:27:43] wife why forgive husband i have had to
[1:27:46] forgive children children forgive
[1:27:47] parents when that spirit comes to
[1:27:49] atmosphere
[1:27:50] oh glory to god make you put your put
[1:27:52] yourself in the person's position and
[1:27:55] put your shoes on
[1:27:56] oh my want to skip down quickly you know
[1:28:00] i'm gonna skip down so he's talking
[1:28:02] about our streams of grace i wanna just
[1:28:03] get down can i get this he said but
[1:28:05] those gifts of god with all these
[1:28:07] virtues in them
[1:28:09] we should call please makes a stumbling
[1:28:10] block to the unbeliever
[1:28:12] it's not accepted by god
[1:28:14] this
[1:28:15] has to be first
[1:28:17] so it is important to understand why
[1:28:19] this time of lingering
[1:28:22] in this message
[1:28:24] because god wants to see this
[1:28:26] this has to be first when you have faith
[1:28:29] virtual knowledge temperance patience
[1:28:31] goodness bully kindness
[1:28:32] then
[1:28:34] the holy ghost comes down
[1:28:36] and seals you as a unit
[1:28:39] this is specific are we driving slow
[1:28:41] down this road
[1:28:43] we're not talking about pentecost we're
[1:28:45] not talking about 1906. we're talking
[1:28:47] about when these things are added he
[1:28:49] said then the holy spirit come down on
[1:28:51] syria as a unit the same as receiving
[1:28:53] the church ages as a unit
[1:28:56] so in other words he can't seal the
[1:28:58] church ages until it's completed
[1:29:01] after it's completed so the prophet come
[1:29:03] to the enemy age and he could look back
[1:29:05] and say look at ephesus
[1:29:07] sardis taitara pogamos
[1:29:11] you see
[1:29:12] he come to the end and look back
[1:29:17] so then he could show the cap will come
[1:29:19] it was rejected
[1:29:20] but we are the end now so we know what
[1:29:22] coming next the count of the cap is the
[1:29:25] coming of the christ the coming of the
[1:29:26] cap is the coming of the stone that's
[1:29:28] totally to end the gentile dispensation
[1:29:33] then they could go to 145 000 jews
[1:29:36] but there's a ceiling angel to come to
[1:29:38] close it off
[1:29:39] the angel from the east
[1:29:41] having the seal of the living god
[1:29:43] the cap and we're going to read it as we
[1:29:45] close and we get down to the closer the
[1:29:47] cap the pyramid of your life
[1:29:50] oh give the lord some praises tonight
[1:29:52] hallelujah
[1:29:54] the same way he makes his bride is the
[1:29:56] same remixes individual made all the
[1:29:58] same material
[1:29:59] oh glory to god you can't imitate them
[1:30:02] they got to be god sent and god born
[1:30:05] imitation only causes confusion it has
[1:30:08] to come from inside out and it produces
[1:30:10] christianity god by the power of the
[1:30:12] holy spirit our sister had her feet wet
[1:30:14] when she got to the bottom and then he
[1:30:16] talked about god accepted the foundation
[1:30:17] and so on here's what's wrong with
[1:30:19] brahms i'm not good you see there are
[1:30:21] two different kinds of fate they're two
[1:30:23] different kind of virtue about human
[1:30:25] virtues human faith human body kindness
[1:30:27] natural virtue natural and people say no
[1:30:29] in church but they're natural stuff
[1:30:30] we're not talking about that you're
[1:30:31] talking about blood transfusion such a
[1:30:33] perfect man put you in your preaching
[1:30:34] theater get your blood out and put the
[1:30:35] blood jesus in
[1:30:37] put the blood jesus bring the feet of
[1:30:38] jesus virtue of jesus knowledge of jesus
[1:30:41] not your knowledge knowledge of jesus
[1:30:42] temperance of jesus isn't that right
[1:30:45] that faith and he said no watch what
[1:30:47] what we have the biggest part of it is
[1:30:49] mental fate a mental fate only here in
[1:30:51] the world bring us our mental
[1:30:53] recognition of god but then from above
[1:30:56] if it ever strikes this there is a godly
[1:30:58] spiritual fate so he's talking about the
[1:31:00] operation of the holy ghost to strike a
[1:31:01] mental fate and make it a spiritual
[1:31:03] revelation and that faith only
[1:31:05] recognizes the word
[1:31:06] so regardless of what the man say and
[1:31:08] preach the only way they could recognize
[1:31:09] isn't that right
[1:31:11] now the five streams you see coming down
[1:31:13] through here tempest together has been
[1:31:15] the holy spirit that made the ephesus
[1:31:17] church it was the holy spirit that
[1:31:18] birthed the introduced new word here now
[1:31:21] birth the smiling church the holy spirit
[1:31:24] give the approval mastery tytara church
[1:31:26] and build that bride there's an elected
[1:31:28] predestinated by jesus christ that the
[1:31:30] holy spirit has called out the elect and
[1:31:32] it's been the holy ghost in this age in
[1:31:34] that age in that age onto the top of the
[1:31:36] holy spirit now as in individuals these
[1:31:39] virtues and things knowledge temperance
[1:31:41] is added to it then here we go when the
[1:31:44] capstone comes
[1:31:46] the holy spirit cements it together
[1:31:49] there is the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:31:53] that's the automobile
[1:31:55] that all the parts the plugs deploy the
[1:31:57] condensers and everything else inside
[1:31:59] this fan
[1:32:00] the radiator everything in there that's
[1:32:02] it
[1:32:05] there is the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:32:07] that is why it is short so short today
[1:32:13] so then you talk about from faith so in
[1:32:14] other words from faith
[1:32:16] to love sees you at christ then you have
[1:32:18] the person of the holy ghost
[1:32:20] living inside of you and that is not
[1:32:22] talking he said well speak for itself
[1:32:24] he will make let it be made known
[1:32:28] it will make itself known i must say how
[1:32:30] you say it it will make itself known you
[1:32:32] will have to speak a word it will speak
[1:32:34] for itself
[1:32:36] he said no watch
[1:32:37] what was number one number one coming
[1:32:39] down to your mental fate holy spirit
[1:32:41] coming along into your mental fate
[1:32:42] making it spiritual faith number two
[1:32:44] tree then you'll have a spiritual
[1:32:45] revelation you'll have the holy spirit i
[1:32:47] will seal all these things into you as
[1:32:49] the holy spirit covers this from your
[1:32:51] faith here we go up to the holy spirit
[1:32:54] the slot he's talking about seals you in
[1:32:56] with christ then you become one amen
[1:32:59] then you become one at that day you
[1:33:01] shall know i'm in the father you me and
[1:33:03] i in you then that's a sealed unit of
[1:33:05] the lord god then is when they are
[1:33:07] vindicated
[1:33:08] and placed
[1:33:09] not before
[1:33:11] then
[1:33:12] let me say it again then
[1:33:14] let our pastors figure their own and
[1:33:15] their vindicated no nothing at all zero
[1:33:17] only mouth only talk
[1:33:20] then they are vindicated i'm reading
[1:33:22] then they are vindicated and placed
[1:33:24] and when that time takes place they
[1:33:26] become vindicated sons
[1:33:28] and daughters of god
[1:33:29] right now we are sons and daughters of
[1:33:30] god but then they become vindicated sons
[1:33:32] and daughters of god hollow that song
[1:33:34] and god tonight when when you're in the
[1:33:36] holy spirit slot
[1:33:37] that's inside a deer
[1:33:39] that spirit slot you become vindicated
[1:33:41] sons and daughters of god not a devil

[1:33:45] i take heavy spirits under my control
[1:33:47] for the glory of god hallelujah oh
[1:33:50] hallelujah
[1:33:52] when a member is born by the holy ghost
[1:33:54] into the family of god and has proven to
[1:33:57] have these verses in him
[1:33:58] that god can see virtue and knowledge
[1:34:01] and temperaments and patience and so
[1:34:02] forth then and then god seals him and
[1:34:05] places him
[1:34:06] that is when you see the son of he say
[1:34:08] it again
[1:34:09] when god can see it
[1:34:11] oh glory to god so you don't have to
[1:34:12] impress nobody

[1:35:00] part of it by one spirit you cannot join
[1:35:02] the church you could join a lodge i
[1:35:04] think if god tempered his bride together
[1:35:06] with that spirit
[1:35:07] and then it tempers the individual
[1:35:08] together with that spirit then you're
[1:35:10] born into the kingdom and then the very
[1:35:12] life that was in the church is in the
