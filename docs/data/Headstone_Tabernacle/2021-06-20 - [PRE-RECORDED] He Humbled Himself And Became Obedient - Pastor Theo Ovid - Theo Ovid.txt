isn't that wonderful amen amen amen i am one of those seeds that was shown here on this island oh my and we're going to continue to sow in those seeds those pressure seeds so this morning we want to go to the scriptures we want three portion scriptures this morning philippians chapter 2 you want to read from verse 1 to 11 hebrews chapter 11 we want to read from 32 to 40 and first corinthians chapter 2 13 verse 1 to 5. all right here we go philippians chapter 2 verse one if there be any therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowers of mercy is fulfilling my joy that should be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind that each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus and he's describing the kind of mind who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross a wherefore god also had highly exalted him and given them a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things and earth and things under the earth that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father we go to hebrews 11. i want to read from verse 32 finally amen amen what shall i more save for the time would fail me to tell of gideon of barak of samson of jephthah of david also samuel of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrote righteousness obtain promises stop them out of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens woman received a dead rays to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trials of cruel mockings and scourges ye moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskin and goat skin being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains in dens and caves of the earth and these all haven't obtained a good report through fate receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect last scripture first corinthians chapter 2 i want to read verse 1 to 5. paul speaking and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith here the purpose why why that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god let's pray one more time father we thank you for your blessed word and we are blessed to read the word and to hear the word interpret it to our hearts confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles and may become a reality as the prophet said that the mysteries will unfold that we might see the plainness of god to know how to conduct ourselves in the evil day we live in granted father in jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated we'll have a title this morning this is our first service of the year are we looking forward for god to do great things among us this year this 2018 we have to be looking forward on a great expectation and you get what you expect and you have to do more if you want to get more isn't that right okay so the title i have this morning is he uh from the scriptures in philippians the title is he humbled himself and became obedient that's the title just to take a scripture text from what christ did he humbled himself and before you could come into obedience you have to learn how to humble yourself another inspiration the revelation of jesus christ now we know the scripture hebrews 5 8 says though he was son yet learning obedience by the things that he suffered though he was a son it didn't give him a free pass it didn't give him as is you though he was a son the suffering didn't make him a son he was always a son but even though he was a son he learned obedience by the things that he suffered so obedience is something that you have to learn you are not born with obedience your mother didn't give you that and your father didn't hand you that you have to learn that and things have to come to teach you and to bring you in obedience are you with me now you have to be able to be taught in order to learn it come like if you're if you're not a good host wife coming to church doesn't make you a good host wife it can be a good church member but if you want to be a good wife you have to learn what good wife does can come to church that don't mean a good husband or good father or a good mother or a good daughter or whatever it is you have to become what you want to become you want to be a better mechanic you want to be a better son you want to be a better preacher you want to be a song leader you have to become that you have to want to do better better than you had before so you come to church to learn stuff that you could come in obedience to the word of god that you can follow instructions you have come to church to judge others they come to church to get the benefit they get the jews from the orange praise god praise god not to complain because if you do a lot of complaining you'll do it very well you're very good you become an expert and complaining you have a gift of complaining you love to complain and as the more you complain the more the anointing of complaining come upon you but if you come for faith which is god's currency to purchase things from god or to get things from god then you're in the right place hallelujah praise god could we say it the lord has shout so we're going to take our time this morning the pastor's in the house oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god amen hallelujah so when jesus matthew 16 came to the coast of caesarea philippi he asked the disciples whom the men say i the son of man become men always talking so i want to know what they're saying about me out there then they said some say you were this some say you're general up this elias he said but whom do you say i am because they out there don't know who i am so talk to me now preach back to me now speak back to me you're following me all these years talk back to me and they still didn't know but simon peter he broke into a channel and he said thou are the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are those simon by jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed unto thee but my father which is in heaven then he went on further i say unto thee toward peter and upon this rock hallelujah this revelation i will build not no pastor billy not no five-fold villain i will build my church that's why revelation is suffering and the holy ghost is the only revealer of the revelation of jesus christ oh could we give the lord a shout that's why you could be boxing 10 years but that can't stop the holy ghost from revealing jesus christ to you and he's the same yesterday today and forever oh give the lord a shout of praise oh hallelujah so jesus this isn't red he said i say unto thee thou and peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and that gets that gates of hell you want to wrestle with it but can't prevail against it so the battle is on but i want to confirm to you in case you didn't know that jesus said he will build his church so have no man church really the real church is jesus church and that is built upon by revelation shout out revelation shout out again revelation that church is built by revelation not you following this man or following this church or following this group you have to get a revelation of jesus christ and then you know you're following the messiah oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god understand this they'll leave they'll leave the fishing business they'll leave tax collecting they leave orc to follow this man because they had a revelation that that was the christ amen praise god oh do you love him this morning hallelujah about the banner from the breach this book is a mysterious book it's a book of redemption now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probe that through six church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins the song is mystery he winds up all the loose ends these fellows probe that and the mysteries come down from god as the word of god and revealed the entire revelation of god so all this mystery mystery stuff comes down as word and that word is preached and that word comes to you and the devil is sticking mind battle because he doesn't know how the word getting the bride but that's the secret the word is in the brain the word not on the books the word get into the bride hallelujah do you do i hear amen is that word in you the world is in the bride that's the secret that is your secret that's why you were in church this morning that's why i don't care how much your back's like whatever you're in church this morning because there is something not on top of your head there is something inside of you you don't you can't explain it [Applause] you can't explain why you keep pressing on why they keep getting back up can't even explain it hallelujah but peter peter was revealing something in second peter 1 he said whereby i give them unto us exceeding great unprecious promises that by these what these what these promises you might be a partaker of the divine nature having escaped the corruption doesn't what you lost and besides this giving all diligence giving all application giving all servancy giving your passion your drive your enthusiasm your zeal giving all your head to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge keep piling it up knowledge temperance and patience and cognition add these things up so we have a commission to work to labor to strive and this possession comes starts as a labor it starts with fate but you're laboring to enter into this great promised land there's always been that way god set it up that way a labor of striving like the chicken in the egg he had to pick his way out amen that worm had to be converted to a butterfly have to press its way out god put it in you that it wouldn't be a jellyfish that it wouldn't be some kind of oh my harlem cookie monster thing are you calling again in puppet business forget where they call it you could say cookie monster i'm fluffy thing when you put the handy hands so when you put your hand here so god don't want you like that push it so you say so no no doesn't want you like that a rag doll yeah then toy doll them toy right though and you know deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things belong to the lord [Applause] that's his own but those things are revealed belong to us no devil can't stop you from getting what what is revealed do i have a shout in the house once it's a secret god could keep it but once it come down as a word that's mind's take your hands off on my property secret things belonging to the lord our god but those things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children what's the purpose for that nobody just says us no that we may do all the words so all the revelation has to come into action it's not for sitting information i see people preaching already i meant scratching it so you could see the engagement making a question man you see people on the forum making a question maximum that's not what the word is for the word is to reveal to push you into action let me get another scripture habakkuk to write division make it plain that he that read it could run so this vision of god must be made plain i am not here to tell you you're fine all right i'm not here to tell you you're the nicest interesting sliced bread sorry i'm not here to tell you that you're here to find out your bad spots your crooked spots your wicked ways things in your heart that your husband don't know that your wife don't know that your children don't know that is what you're here for for the surgeon general's knife the sharp sword cut them between the bone and the marrow to come and cut out what's not like him do i hear a shout in the house [Applause] but about how many absolute says this let me tell you something listen to this closely this is the complete divine revelation of god his will the coming of christ everything lays right in this book completed [Applause] and if anything draws you off of that and throws you off the find the compass and that sets you to the word of god in other words don't let nothing shake you off the word of god don't let wife husband children money car land pasta bishop pope whatever it is don't let nothing shake you off the word when i give my heart to jesus christ i was 17 years old and when i saw is only three things to throw a man off is either as money is woman or popularity if there's ten things is there a hundred things just three things i asked god to protect me from them three things i said lord let me be a man that gonna wait upon you because i found the scripture where i said they that wait upon the lord i found the scripture where young men shall fall utterly fall and i know the scripture that i call you young man because you're strong so when i understood that because you're young that don't mean you're going to stand you still have to wait upon god when i understood that i purpose to be a man that could obey upon god i will wait till my change come and if you wait upon god going to bless you the devil cannot stop a man that put gods first i don't care what shape to the left what to the right but that man gonna comfort anyhow glory to god never in my life i ever thought i would encounter crooked dishonest lying preachers but they have them hallelujah but they can't stop anything because they don't have a heaven they don't have hell and they don't have the power of adoption years ago god showed me the adoption have nothing to do with the people adoptions do with father and son so because of how much the people love the man and love the pastor what did i have nothing to do god have to say this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased that's why i don't bother with the people whether you want to shout or shout don't show that's your business i will shout for you i will praise god for you oh glory to god because i know my name is on that book i know i'm a child of the king oh hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah what about him he said god created me a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me to hunger make me the test creating me lord that what is needed in me let me from this our own be more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more humbler more kinder more willing to work more look to the things that are positive and forgetting to the things that are passed let's cut off 2017. we have a land in front of us atlanta possess it's a good land it have signs in it [Applause] in it it's a fire fire fire in it and have your foot on the devil's neck on it oh give the lord a shout if that breaks you after pressure in it deliver us after deliverance pull after power all of that is in that land it's my oh glory you must be seated so brother man i'm talking about the lesson he said feeling the holy spirit which way to set this that the people will see it you see you've got to see it i love how the lord did this thing it is beautiful i just love it write the vision make it plain so the ministers fulfill the commission when the people get the vision of god so what the prophet said is that the minister can't bring the revival thank god the prophet said that these jokers want to bring the revival themselves but he said the man can't bring it it take the people so the minister have to transfer the vision so if you want to play pope and keep everything for himself as the revealer of z miseries then he on his own because he have to stand there revealing a whole lot of things for a very long time but the point is is till we all come not till the minister come the ministry is still we all come into the unity of the faith into the knowledge not not some come all come knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of christ measure because we don't have all the same measure oh hallelujah he ascended high and gave gifts unto men we don't have all the same gifts we don't have the same measure but the content is good so when god hit a housewife and fell over the holy ghost it doesn't make a preacher because she get god in her no no it doesn't do that if make a one anointed holy ghost big cooking cooking wife hallelujah food my god a husband can't wait to come over that kind of food that's anointed food in that house that's what we're talking about a revival inside the hole see them systems rejoicing already they want to be this kind of thing holy ghost-filled wife praying wife anointed wife husband and wife devils after him by the right prayer and michael jordan his sword cutting them devils away from her husband that's what we're talking about that's when we the wife can make the dishes holy ghost revival praying in the home oh glory to god time wash the dishes hallelujah when the husband come home see all the dishes all day you want to know what happened she said oh god oh god refill me with the holy ghost i had a holy ghost showdown come on give the lord a shout in the house how many of you for revival this morning [Applause] i want to see which way to set this that the people will see it that you might in seeing it be enlightened and cause you to come closer to christ because we are the end time not closest to church but the christ may we not take this as a lecture but may we solemnly take the warnings of the holy spirit and pray day and night don't let nothing stop you from praying that include your cell phone that could include facebook that include the internet that conclude whatever don't let nothing stop you from praying we get in we dig up the lives of those great men back there how they sacrifice you see how they literally we have done it makes me ashame of myself sometimes how we after everything so easy and they had everything so hard and he caught the scripture we read they wondered about in sheepskin and god's skin what skin you want about him with your fancy shoes this morning on your nice tie and your time matching your your socks were you wondering with him the sheepskin goat skin destitute caves dens and you have air conditioning in your room did they name my condition then come on give the lord a shout and now come on preach back to me somebody [Applause] so you better begin to toughen up tell somebody i'm gonna toughen up tell somebody that [Applause] [Applause] forgive me forgive me forgive me i will be one noisy preacher i am a happy preacher every time i say i tell my wife i'm here i feel i live a fulfilled life oh i feel i've been doing god's will and i feel great if i drop down there in the morning i go in with good grace i'm feeling good this is a great year they say i'm gonna be 60. when i tell my friend he says that he will not i said tease him when i was 20 something i said were you so old you he said nah well that was the laugh of the day i couldn't stop laughing i had no bolina oh this is so exciting because all these years you're looking for this promise to come to pass you're under expectation and that's how god kept it he couldn't tell us 50 years from now you're busy holding on in a time of lingering that time i linger who for 50 years who wanted linga for so long not even abraham had that length of time abraham at 25 years so we lingering all these years man what black yellow getting gray man getting bald and we still here yes devil we still right here not gonna back down from that word if i'd use a king or walking around with a cane i'll save my use my use my teeth use my gums butter fighting right true praise god queen don't fight it oh glory to god so they had goat skins tormented disinflicted what will our testimony stand up these ideas how will it be besides that we have to have everything so nice my my my my so holy church start up the early church start up with fire with power and then afterwards what happened they begin listening describe it they begin cutting off the spirit and adding the natural yes i know that's why i say you better talk about which doctors doctors you know you hear the title it's which doctors you then have their doctorate in witchcraft not talk craft which graph did they different altogether and they didn't have one some wish doctor coming from some church and he's doing something so like that and the pastor falling down and he fell asleep right pastor he broke him in jesus name and he fallen down man pelting spell and whatnot afterwards he passed and rebuked him in jesus name he fall back too far to hold him i thought he can't catch himself and he said that jesus people had to shout and jump because jesus name versus whatever power that fellow working with nice wish doctor thing this message people without spirit they have no clue what this person is like if satan come with a bright shining light they kind of interview him i know he's the devil i'm not descendant of the devil bringing wrong doctrine you don't know the devil entertaining satan says sit down here where else you have what are mysteries you have oh glory to god that's what we're talking about the church have to be attuned to spirit this natural path is only packed but in the beginning after the church has broken into the spirit realm there was removing spirit bringing natural removing spirit bringing natural until the only spirit man so called was the pope it went to one man he's our man and god don't want that actually god said he hate that he hate the lady being conquered he hate you not having what you're supposed to have when you leave are you supposed to walk with a bundle of joy a bundle of peace a bundle not a separate bundle like tottenham in your back a bundle when you open that up so you can share it out you can say neighbor i have joy in service you want some you have a bundle of it a bundle of god's love a bundle of god's peace when you go on your job you have a bundle of it you could smile hallelujah praise god you could laugh you could rejoice you could shout because you know inside your soul you're all right oh god the lord gods and praises hallelujah so watch each year the cutting of the spirit are the natural of the spirit other nature until now they're ready to do it again we're living in the last days the closing the consummation of the church now why does satan hate revelation why is he so against revelation it is because the entire canon of god's word and church is solemnly built upon revelation amen so normal no one wants satan your business keep you in the flesh keep it natural you come to service you come late so you can't even sing to get in the spirit that's what the singing is for the singing is again inspirational to be prepared for the world you know the singing is to bring an atmosphere you know the signatures will be singing that was song they write some long message song i have to appreciate the club because it's worth somebody profit now so yeah it's something good but have no anointing with it you have no inspiration with it they have no fire no presence nothing with it it's just like information in song form but when them writers was going through the experience it was no information in some form when that brother lost his wife and somebody says say lord he said precious lord and he said precious lord take my hair then fellas wasn't talking or lettering they're reading a book and they put some words together and call like a message song wasn't that it was real [Applause] the blind singer she said i shall know him by the prince of the nail in his hands that was no message song that was a reality oh the blood of jesus oh hallelujah i know it was the blood there's a fountain filled with blood joints from emmanuel fame where sinners punch beneath the flat loose all the guilty stills oh get the lord i shout in the house [Applause] hallelujah in the walls of an insane institution they found the words written the love of god so pure so merciless and strong it shall forever more endure the saints and angels song there ain't no lighting that's inspired stuff the man went crazy trying to figure out the love of god and have our important song written there oh give the lord a shout we might look crazy sometimes but we are inspired oh glory to god because the lord has shout we might talk crazy sometimes we might go crazy sometimes but believe you me be i inspired [Applause] so the church is not built upon jesus it's built upon the revelation of jesus christ what has been revealed so there's no intellectual stuff with that revelation revelation of nothing to an intellect when when when isaiah got the revelation of when he shall conceive if it had passed his intellect i've heard oh just rewind could you play that again that's if it hooked the intellect but because it bypassed intellect he says a virgin shall conceive and be a son his name shall be called wonderful counselor everlasting father prince of peace somebody said i challenge you of which you can conceive i didn't see it you know i was just expressing the thoughts that drop down direct that's not my interpretation of it you know that come direct no secretary i come direct flesh and blood didn't reveal that that was direct a fortune shall conceive god interpret his own word mary come and vindicate that scripture of which he shall conceive but ramsay there's gonna be a bride there's a bride in trinidad god interpret that word no man could interpret that god himself would interpret that there's a bride here on this island and that bride will be called by seven thunders because seven thunders we're gonna call the bride

man peter to tell him these people are drunk he's supposed to devil too then people having a good time went back and sleep that wasn't impressive i'm not impressed because since last week i see the brother excited like he's doubly excited this week not impressed but when peter went to the gate called beautiful and the crippled man everybody knew he cripples he begged him a long time when peter looked at his hands to see what change he could give him he recognized that he's content just like the rest of them scrunting apostle you know but it just doesn't happen those new apostles don't

walk on like here thank you thank you that's not how you're walking inside of here my god you're gonna mash up the place i was gonna mash up the place i'm going to run back and forth all these years tie up tie up tie up and go loose them boys let me free free free atlas glory to god the prophet said when the devil saw that he said wait a minute you gotta stop that nice serious stuff now i know there's no shaking in upper room and falling down i could bear with that but this thing here this is the same what jesus do them guys doing too that's what we're talking about the same works i do shall we do also and greater oh my so barbara said when that time comes through the holy ghost when reveals christ back in the church with power and demonstration and healing the sick and making the signs that we said would follow the believers then satan turns over in his bed he does something about that until that time syrian document church you join amen oh how much money you reveal are they still in mysterious balls here's one packs and satan's satan loading them up when they say satan loading up at mysteries listen it's a bottomless pit let's move on to somebody else but i'm tap already they focus on that they're not focused on the life of christ to be made manifest to focus on that you have to have a revelation of jesus christ [Applause] do you get that who made me understand that not a revelation of this church not a version of my ministry not a man revelation i'm your pastor not that but the revelation of jesus christ if i die in the morning instead of that revelation if this church fall flat you still have revelation if trainers split into 15 parts you'll still have the revelation of jesus christ make sure make sure you have a revelation of jesus [Applause] christ i remember a good friend of mines that perkins holiness he couldn't see the message we used to work together i said share with him with the word and they tell me it's over he said you have a revelation of jesus christ you see everybody that talked to him about his messenger brown and said brother brown saying brother bran i'm saying but he couldn't get that i was talking about jesus but jesus said how jesus said behold i will send you prophets and if you see through the eyes of jesus you could present it correctly if you don't have that but i am saying who is brother branham to them but iran is an authority to them but around that choice to you but you're not presenting christ you're presenting a prophet like a prophet and they prophesy prophet prophet who is that they don't even understand that there's a promise behind elijah they don't even understand that so you're presenting something they can't even start to begin to grasp and they turn it down and they say well they reject it they reject what you have to be have a revelation jesus christ then you can present christ to the people through the prophet [Applause] so that is why i can tell you i don't buy nobody fight you have your fight with this one that's you and them i know you me and them don't bring me in your business stay in your business you fight your fight i might fight the fight i will fight my fight i will fight my own fights i didn't bring you the church in it that brothers ministers let's bring the whole church into the whole church fighting with them fighting fighting fighting i just be sorry for the believers this pastor probably that passed and bringing whole christian and whole church life suppose you better repent oh you're on doing that edit undo that's called only microsoft word that's the computer you can't do that after scrubbing people head and assault the mind and rape their spirits and sow the wrong seeds in them against this one and that one oh you're on doing that [Applause] god will judge them not supposed to do that oh yeah that's strong right that's strong right yeah yeah it's strong but it's the truth and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free when they go in court they say do you promise to speak the truth the whole truth are nothing but the truth the other day all three because you go and lie so the first part cleared that truth but you can sell part whole truth you can leave out some nothing but the truth give us all god say i desire truth from the inward parts god one truth from with inside the depths and shoot from inside of you that's why jesus tell the woman go call your husband to see what kind of woman she is it's not a matter she's doing this and doing that and living this man or that man you know it's what's inside of her it's not what so much you're doing is who you are is that your career he took upon him no reputation repetition is what others think about you but character is who you are everybody can see you nice and nice and nice but that does have to be so that's what people say that what people think but are you nice do you do nice things do you have a nice character or are you crooked inside but nice outside that's what the word come to do now go between the bone and the marrow and go down inside [Applause] glory hallelujah hallelujah the woman jesus is not fit to take that bread and casted the dogs the woman said truth lord i'm a dog but the doctors get crumbs just say go your way woman she humbled herself hallelujah praise god and she received a blessing that's the problem people don't want to humble themselves oh yeah they want bless you they want blessings but they don't want to humble because to obey you have to subject yourself and jesus didn't talk taught robbie to be equal with god he was god but here come and say i am god look at me you see these muscles these are god muscles be just like around that uh a gorilla jesus didn't do that he humbled himself he became the former servant and he became obedient and the bible said let this mind be in you before that paul said esteem each other better than yourself that means see your brother better than you bigger than you so you're not fighting for somebody's face like better than she i'm better than he i am say revelation another word this one has more revelation so he is the man of the hour listen every minister will be preached by the faith and revelation god gave them i'm not trying to have nobody measure i never try to be anybody else but what god have me i'm very comfortable to be what god made me and i want to do the best that i can and so each one of you must be that way to surrender to the lord isn't that right so let's look at the vision we have today for the burnout find out if david was talking about david and the rest of them would only have consulted the bread of the hour you remember david got in trouble right you didn't consult the prophet they even want to bring out the act david didn't move and led to do this and that's the other and he didn't consult god and men died innocent man died so you watch if the priests and prophets and preachers and theologians schools and our nation would have consulted the hour now it won't do them no good they don't they don't move out it won't help a bit she's gone now she's crossed the line five years ago between repentance mercy and judgment talking about um america notice what is then what can be done what is to be done let's consult the prophet the bible where we cannot add or take away from it god takes us from the book of life the bible said malachi 4 version 10 how the seven seas would be open and reveal all these mysteries have been hid through these reformers he said how it would be done it's in the bible thus saith the lord god has completely perfectly identified that and vindicated to be the truth by signs wonders in the heavens in the skies everything else for 33 years you think they listen to it no they're dead it was when this thing happened that david saw he said oh god send us a david that can see where he's standing that can look out and see god made a promise what how he's going to do it today god said it writing in his word how he would do it god told mikaya maikaya examined his vision before 400 dignified prophets he examined his vision to see what was right he looked back to what the prophet said before him to see what happened he looked back he saw elijah stand in there say ahab the dogs will lick your blood too and he seen that the vision was exactly according to the word of god so he pronounced it no matter what the rest of them said amen still with the word when my car said go you say when i come back i will be with you he said if you come back god never talked to me let's look at the vision we have today is it building churches is it new things is it great things are going to happen or is it judgment this is what is facing the world america is perfectly sodom right now it is saddam anointed america is getting ripe for judgment they have two kings kim jong-un on that side and kingdom trump on that side both of them chatting around and i'm talking nuclear talk but something on the break are you going to break soon it is judgment there's nothing left but judgment you know so the bride have to come into position before these things begin to strike oh yes they're going to begin to move in because when those hands really sink the bike will be here so things will be moving in it wouldn't be business as usual or business as normal something horrible happen watch people start to pray oh god not the praying but that's how we're supposed to be now making a greater push isn't that right because los angeles is a sign for the world not for the bride that's for the world outside but for you you're supposed to see your promises made manifest right in your midst that was you supposed to be looking for your promises isn't that right watch so watch so david consulted the priest of that day to illusion but it was contrary to the word god said he would do it today how he'll restore all things he would restore exactly in joel 228 all the years the conquer woman and the caterpillar restore everything back to the church exactly what they had in the first place what are you saying i'm saying tongues have to come back prophecies have to come back interpretation of tongues have to come back gift of wisdom gift of healing every gift have to be back in the church [Applause] every year somebody records in tongues and somebody interpret giving warnings exposing people calling out sin whatever it is that could be back in the church then people could just walk in the building just any old hoe there was no goddess among those people hallelujah fires there it used to have been a long time you know amen oh yeah our tongue was an interpretation and whatnot i was in one meeting i was so scared i wasn't preaching that day i was abnormal believer winter service don't stop and brothers ministers said on the platform and man was preaching talking afterwards tongues come that interpretation will come and when god had exposed some things and said the ministers sit on the platform sitting down there faults i'm tilting over and over and i trembling shaking like a young believer go call them false only platform they say say make that a better spirit picking up is in people's lives and hearts the full operation in the church god can film in the world with signs wonders miracles gifts do you want to see that or just one of your words words words words words that is what you must want to see the living god [Applause] but when thunders was preached 1975 every gift dry up that was a kind of mind-boggling thing called his brother some pentecostal church and open bible church and whatnot had gifts and signs and all kinds of things every sign everything wonders you know what he was doing trying to do get the gifts to identify every word was true and god just try it up the wood is above all those things so god bring the word to the people see they could take it then penn person who couldn't handle it they leave the message because they want that science to empower them and they don't understand that the message comes to bring character because character is what's going to positionally place you for genuine power what the pentecostal was a temporary power temporary blessing god couldn't use them because they didn't have the word to use the word in them he used men but the word come to the prophet and because they reject the prophet they reject the word so god just used men flesh and blood but he promised a bride that would be a true seed of the word a true bride of the word and in that prayer we'll have the word and we're going to use the word and the pride that is why the bride cannot fail it's not you he's using you are not even the believer the believer is the word in you come unknown the lord i shout give the lord i shout you are not the believer the believer is the word in you god put something in you when before the foundation of the world [Applause] glory do you understand that god put it in you before you fail before your fault while you're messed up if god was running your business based upon failure none was going to make it because all have sinned and come short of the glory of god do you get that oh not some all right so don't come with me just sit on my nest in all this sin all have come short of the glory of god hallelujah so god richard mercy drop down blood dropping a covenant unconditional covenant to redeem you regardless blood speaking on your behalf my god the blood following you wherever you go that blood coming the book of redemption wherever you go blood following you the blood have to cover you and the spirit follows the blood because the life of the blood is the spirit so the spirit is upon you through the blood the blood is the word when the word is preached blood is on you blood is over you that will turn the spirit spirit upon you oh lord give the lord a shout oh hallelujah glory to god and once again in the spirit in the spirit there is power in the spirit as victory in the spirit is overcoming power samson was in the spirit those brothers live in the spirit that's why they were one with god they were in the spirit nothing could stop them or give the lord a shout in the house you cannot fix natural condition with spiritual things you cannot fix spiritual condition with natural things however the bible says i'm hungry you can't call me be filled with the holy ghost get that man some food sit down a minute oh hallelujah praise god man no clothing are you talking about getting your spirit give me a spirit spirit with naked you need clothes yes yes i'm saying that so you have to deal with what the needs are so for spiritual condition you need spiritual medicine spiritual attention and you have conditions here natural things can help you a new car new house that will fade so fast in front of your face and you just have new installments but that wouldn't solve your spiritual issue are you with me now your spiritual issue needs to be dealt with and that's where the surgeon general knife come to cut all the excess flesh come to do surgery in your spirit in your soul that you can leave here empowered from within david listen david paul was inside you know it wasn't the string so much you know it was what was in him you know it was his confidence it was his revelation of god it was his revelation of the experience on the backside of the desert [Applause] you can't go very far without an experience ask god to give you an experience the experience of what kept me all these years you cannot go very far without an experience with god you need to confront that pillar of fire you need to get into the presence of the pillar of fire where you know god is a reality now nobody could talk you out of it it's a reality to you you can't explain to your husband to your children to your wife to your neighbor to the boss but god knows it's a reality to you that's why moses could go back so fearless and say pharaoh let my people go that's why moses go back with no mind battles he killed a man 20 years ago 40 years ago it doesn't matter he had none do with that that's not even thinking not even coming up in moses system as far as moses so he's anointed and commissioned to bring two million people out not two thousand you know two million 201 million two of that he come to bring them out with a mighty hand who he met a god with no name who said i said send me tell them i am that i am i ain't talking no name talk yet just tell them i am i am whatever you have neither of them that is what i am tell them i am thank you oh glory to god and as long as i am is there something i have to go after i am to make him the i am i am what what do you want me to be oh hallelujah whatever you want me to be that is what i am i am a healer i am a deliverer what what do you want me to be tonight oh god give the lord a shout you want a deliverance you want a deliverance what do you want me to be tonight oh give the lord a shout in the house god could give me that breakthrough god could give me that victory hallelujah oh glory to god come on now raise your hands and give god some praises glory glory glory to god glory to god [Applause] hallelujah oh blessed be the rock of my salvation hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated old man moses 80 years old i don't know if i'll get into it hot temper wife to make him know to mcmo says no he ain't no god to make moses no you know his big mighty man god have that wife he has to make him humble to break a spirit to make him feel weak that's right that's what he preached in provision above a weakness not to make moses me he's a god no a temple wife and muslim will go with that because you know it had to be god if he was a god then he is divorced but because he's weak you don't know what to do don't know how to do it don't want to bring the people out have to be god god will be glorified when you show god not show you [Applause] my god i feel inspired this morning so paul said the scripture we read he said when i come among you i come in trembling i come in weakness i come in fear or that my preaching will be a certain way i don't want to come with the wisdom that you say oh god he really wise he's a smart man he's an intelligent man he's a man with a lot of deep mysteries of course i ain't come with that i come with a word of power that your faith may not rest in the wisdom of what i'm preaching but in power of god so paul's objective was to lock them into the power of god this paul go with you when they go back home this poor is available you are one as a majority in god when you go along on your knees you can say i am a majority a hallelujah glory to god hey let god come down let god say to you i have heard the cries of my people let god speak because he heard your cry [Applause] is this too much for you is this too hard for you you want land that's easy you could save up and buy it you don't hold that's easy too what better job everyone study that's easy but there's fate and this virtue and this knowledge this life that caused these people to wander into deserts and dens and caves women torn asunder better resurrection they wanted in sheepskin and gold skin and god reserves something better for us better for us god bypassed all their big faith they had real faith you know yes real faith and god said day without us not made perfect god make us the magnet god make us the capstone bride the magnetic bride to pull everybody out from the grave we're gonna be the magnet a pyramid magnet bride with the power of the voice of the archangel the lord himself descendant with a shout with the voice of the archangel jesus does all three with the trump of god this bride the short already happened now the voice he's gathering stones to make up this pyramid body this holy ghost that the voice could come in to speak i say messiah is on the earth now oh give the lord some as people and the kingdom of god is the word in you turn into power oh glory to god [Applause] one time maybe seize it one time but i'm called his hidden power hidden power and daniel ryan's then daniel didn't know his power inside of him detroit lions then hungry lion you

fire around daniel then can handle fire running walking wrong with what's got touch just watching but he can't touch hungry hungry hungry lion supposed to eat that man be able to pass through fire lying smarter than that hallelujah lands better than that when you see fire back off and there's a holy ghost fire coming to consume this bride commanders around this bride every devil in hell have to back off offer for that but abandon prophesy that this bride will be an invincible army you know what that means cannot be defeated oh glory that god cannot be defeated we will meet the challenge anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition or give the lord a shout in the house oh my god the devil cannot get stronger but we can did you hear what i said lucifer is the lucifer but we are now beginning to know who we are oh glory to god and one day you're going to know who you are he said that day you're going to know i am in the father you and me and i and you oh glory to god they go from partial realization into perfect realization you will know as you are known oh give the lord some praises people [Applause] whose son am i now you may be caesar oh hallelujah what's this threefold mystery for god to reveal himself one two for christ of the preeminences three to restore back eden it's simple what's complicated about her that preeminences had a deeper revelation of seven steps of life coming into you by those virtues that god could have the i'm going to get into it oh praise the lord i won't give it too long when you go to the next country you need to change your money you go to america your car go and use tt dollars nobody ain't buying that let it go to the blue dishon get the money change and come back with your us dollars then we could talk because that's the currency limit we'll have another currency and that currency i want to say is virtues so we're going to say something this morning all the mysteries all this stuff had to be converted to virtues so paul said do i speak with tons of men and angels do i have faith to move mountains do i give my body to be burned do i know all mysteries that i don't have charity i have zero nada not nothing waste of time oh glory to god so what are you saying every mystery every revelation every secret thing and mystery thing and it has to convert into something that god could recognize as a currency of heaven that give purchase and power to those who have it [Applause] in other words the golden rule what's the golden rule you have the gold rules yes that's my interpretation of it that goal is character [Applause] goal we'll rule oh my oh my let's get down here where are we going good my my my my my you know unexpected this morning right you wanna in the same boat oh my lord this time just relax just relax and i'm very relaxed that is so good oh my lord is an age but i know that works neither hot no cold i would have had no cold so then because i would look warm neither hot and cold i spilled my mouth oh this is the risk for christianity now look warm yeah cold call me you're dead you're not hot you're not on fire you're just in between lukewarm commentaries lukewarm lukewarm demands a penalty from god so when natural people say hey they come to church god's saying does it change he wants your passion to know the word he wants you cry to get in the spirit he wants the fifth and he's out to please him that's what he wants from you and only you could give him that they're not family things that is you that's not what your husband doing i'm gonna do with that people make excuses people do what they wanna do if you want to come here and sleep you could come here and sleep yeah you can relax in heaven and just doze like you just come for a dozen sessions sister news for the news if you want to be on fire you could be [Applause] at that time in services i'd be a little tired and untimely i would stand up bite my nail whatever it is bite my finger beat the huh sometimes i drive in any states sleepy but i have to do something see i know you have some biscuits you have a sweetie or something something why because i have to stay in my eyes on the road so if you want to be on fire you've been far you want the pressure way you could press your weight you want to achieve you can achieve as a man thinking in his heart so is he oh glory to god i am seeing breakthrough after breakthrough after breakthrough oh yes i'm seeing people lining up to come into the church yes i'm seeing the sick being healed i see in prayer lines spread lines prayer lines i see in service come a double portion afterwards service then prayer line service and walking service then the dead speaking the deaf speak the deaf hearing the dom speaking service after service people hearing the testimony of god among those people with signs and wonders and miracles why are you saying about all of it because there's a prophecy i'll ride this trail once more but didn't say that the holy ghost in him said that the holy ghost said i will ride the trail once more tell me one more ride the holy ghost is the white horse rider he's going to mount a bride there's going to be a power strike the church that's prophecy no devil could stop it somebody gonna connect with it somebody's gonna raise up and spare and because the secret thing belongs to god but everything that has been revealed belongs to us oh glory to god the holy spirit told that prophet pick up your pen and write he said our church will be a super church actually nears the headstone or glory that goes to every day as we get closer as we get closer more power more revelation more anointing more witness of the spirit it's got to be that way i refuse otherwise oh glory to god the timer lingering is almost over [Applause] you may be seated after iran with 25 years don't come on manifestation tell him i will return unto d a quantity time of life there's still a time of life i come to remind you your 25 years is not wasted i come to remind you your years believe in this message is not wasted i come to remind you that time is at hand for sarah to conceive the time is at hand from mary to produce messiah you haven't wasted your faith you haven't believed cannon device fables no no no no no you're going to be activated or go in the word and you're going to come alive the wording you will be manifested oh glory to god amen hallelujah so abraham said lukewarmness demands a penalty from god the penalties that they be spilled out of his mouth here we don't want to go astray folks they very unwisely see that god can spew you out of his mouth and that proves there's no such thing as any truth of the doctrine of in our sins i want to correct you thinking right now this first is not given to an individual it is given to the church he's talking to the church furthermore if you want to keep the word in mind you'll recall nowhere does it say that we are the mount of god we are engraved on his palms we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we are in a sheepfold in his pastures but never in his mouth but what is in the mouth of the lord the word in his mouth oh hallelujah for prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they were moved by the holy ghost so what is wrong with these people in the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it the baptists have their crease and dogmas based on the word and they can't shake them they say their possibilities and miracles are over there's no baptism in the holy ghost subsequently to believe in and the messengers have their stuff all them claim the doctrine to be word-based sometimes they strain to find anything anything to fit their doctrine they put the doctrine first and then trying to fit it they will sell out the word for sensation about every time if they can produce a manifestation like oil blood tongues and other signs whether it's word or not whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it the word god says here we go i am going against you all i will spew out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages i have seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mind so at the end of this age i'm spinning out of my mouth it is all over i'm going to speak all right i'm here in the midst of the church the amen of god the faithful and it will be by my prophet then he quote russian 10 seven and this is the voice seven angel there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he's selling a prophet almost two thousand years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education religion this prophet will turn the heart of the children back to the fathers listen to this he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him will be the ones who will truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works who is that the elect with him hallelujah a momentary consideration of churches she will prove in the dark ages the word was entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word lutheran spoke for god at that time at that time and watch but they organize again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creed are not simple word shout out simple word simple word has to be able to be made plain to the people not complex because once it comes into complexities like telling ghana long time the priest used to say the whole mass in latin so the people just sit down there and he was secular said man he does meet me with the hands and they go home then they convert the latin to english but the people sitting there in this catholic and they they have a clue they demand cursing in the words they have no clue whatsoever he is speaking a different language the whole thing he's speaking mysteries another language god doesn't want that one time afterwards he has stopped talking parables he said lord don't speak us now plainly because he's speaking parables to tie up some of them but he's beginning to break of the disciples he is talking a certain way but then he begin to bring it clear to them because the mystery has to be made clear what you're about to receive that's why the bible said he opened the understanding to the scriptures and opened the word to them that they could go in the upper room without any doubt that this promises minds this holy ghost is minds i'm going to be filled behold i send the promise of my father upon you but parry you'll see jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high there ain't no power on coming sideways from on high buttons come on below from an eye no manner bringing no power from one eye that's a [Applause] and the weird said when the day of pentecost was fully come and like those words fully come they were in one mind they were in one accord they were praising as normal but all of a sudden something happened russian mighty wind fill all the old house terror fire divide itself give each everybody a portion what abraham says the church is no longer the more peace of god this is one more peace so god is still in her and who the church god is doing that oh yes he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her in the last day the spirit and the bride say come version 2017. let's go once more the world will hear direct from god at that pentecost but of course that would buy will be represented as in the first age no he has cried out to this age you have heard you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want leaving out what you want you are not interested in living it but debating it i would sooner you'll be hot or cold if you were cold and rejected i could stand that if you could get white heart to know it's true and live it i would praise you for that but because you simply take my word and don't honor it i will spew you out of my mind oh my god let's take a little more to him that overcome it well i granted him my throne now what are we to overcome that's the normal question to ask but that is not the actual thought in this verse it's not so much what we have to overcome but how but now this is logical for it doesn't matter what we have to overcome as long as you know how we can overcome a quick look at the scripture but jesus overcome devil the temptation by the word is written we know that watch adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this is the only way to be overcomer is the only way you can know if you're overcoming because that word can't fail you have to be able to overcome by the word because god said it you're standing by it god said it you're staying with it you say if you have a doubt in your mind don't do it and you know you're right should i say i said i should i don't do it you're right staying with the world oh my gosh so brother branham says watch he constantly apply the word jesus he spake only what the father gave him to speak there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom because it was the wisdom of god in his personal life contending with himself this is big this is huge now this is jesus are you with me in his personal life contending with himself he overcame by obedience to the word of god amen hebrews 11 says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death and it was heard and i was heard that he feared though he was a son yet he learned obedience by the team that he suffered i know you hear that you hear that intellectually because you have started to suffer yet you only get his stuff and you you've done faith already it's suffer not stuff sometimes he suffered before he come here by by he learned obedience so so see when we finish this service here nobody should complain if the roof falls along you fix it you are too flat tired fix it this happen fix it do something about each other work your ship get wrecked keep swimming don't get up and drown you that's what i'm saying but you see people feeling entitled what if paul said you're entitled lord god don't know us i'm not a porcelain a prophet to the gentiles this not supposed to happen to me what will the people think swim paul swim that's right [Music] [Applause] [Music] paul will be bowling because he'll be drowning other day paul shipwreck with everybody else had to fight up pull things off the shore get wood light fire and all of a sudden a snake bite him now everybody know that sneaking that snake don't make joke in one minute you're gone and paul just shake off the snake and continue anybody looking content ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and they seem still standing paul said jesus thinks i'll bite them and shall not hurt them we we snake proof that amen song a week it had a man used to bring snakes unless snake bite tried to bite him and was protected until you know he eventually just asleep by them but he was trying to prove what god say i'm not doing that i say his job if you want to do that let's feel free to go and do that but my point is this god proved himself paul being shipwrecked before we know all things work together for good to them that love god even when you ship wreck when your marriage wreck when you're home wrecked when this happened and that happened even oak where you're shouting the house what was jesus obedient to the word of god then there will be not be one person there will not be one person who will sit on the throne of jesus christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fasting your repentances no matter what you present to god will not gain you the privilege of sitting on that throne it will be granted only to the word bride as the throne is shared with the queen understand this fasting is not obedient fasting is part of what you do but that is not what if god tells you something and you fast sin faster god said pick up that people from there you're fasting you're fasting god say pick up the people from there until you pick up the paper you're fascinated as reason diana go you want a fast pick on the paper you follow what god's saying this word husband love your wife that's the word i didn't put that there you know somebody when you're preaching the feeling preach up with the picture right he said you know i didn't put it there wife obey her husband i didn't i didn't write that the bible right there sharing obey your parents the bible put that in oh hallelujah all right let's go i know home stretch now the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you see other lord yet you say where have you loved us watch they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant baby with parental care but god said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen on salvation because god had chosen you to salvation through the signification of spirit and belief of the truth he may become he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering there's no email on that one but it's still the word so we say amen anyhow that don't mean you're going undead you're just saying amen to the truth i'll say it again just to get a little confirmation he may commit you to suffering as he did job he may commit to the debt as he did paul that is his prerogative he is suffering [Applause] but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the order of frustration and not peace so god is not the author who got frustrated i'm frustrated yeah you frustrated god's not ordered that you fighting obedience you fighting humbling yourself because if you humbly yourself to the word of god you will know all things work together for good say if you want this and god said not no you want me vex with god and you're angry with this one and hungry with that one no you're going to believe that god knows why you're not getting now [Music] he's six years old the blade is enough for him the thing that could shade the father face now could cut him and damage him so god has to protect that ma that little guy from that shaving blade you know that's how i'm saying that so clone time whatever protect you from things that you don't even know will be indigenous to your own life so you just have to bless god and thank him for his mercy for things seen and unseen jesus you're not even aware of traps of the devil sneers from the enemy that put before you to trap you and to sneer you and god hand upon your life in the spirit realm you're not even seeing it you're only walking on that angel just throw something outside to block your way pass here praise god angel and demons fight in a battle over you don't touch that my anointed prophets know him glory hallelujah hallelujah in

angel's investigating where you go oh glory to god there's a prophecy hanging over your head that must come to pass they are trying to cut you off from your prophecy but the devil is a liar this

nothing so i am mr desperate so so help me god i was going on that bus i got on the bus got on time mama i made it oh glory to god and there's another bus coming we call it the rapture express don't miss it make sure you're getting bored oh hallelujah make sure you get the token let me just make a rubber up here brother branham don't be a son he learned obi-wan i think he suffered james one two the four counted all joy when you fall in the divers temptation but that's the revolution by itself knowing this that the trying of your faithful patience that patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanted nothing for i reckon that the suffering of this present time here we go it's not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us glory listen this unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him amen you have to suffer the rain that should be a message right there you know there's a title sometimes i'm going to preach that one the other suffer the rain the reason for this is the reason there's a reason the reason character simply is never made without suffering amen that's why it's painful to see poor parenting and people spoil their children to death i've seen it is a painful thing mothers destroy sons destroy their own family by their behavior by their conduct by the operation by refusing to be the kind of example that the children could see and reflect and when their time comes they ruin their marriages and their homes and their lives and all the name of you love your child yeah you spoil your child if you only look how god handles his children and you try to emulate how god does that you'll be a whole different bald game altogether oh yes all right let's go character is simply never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot reign because power apart from character is satanic so when i see brothers ministers lying and deceitful and underhand and corrupt or whatever it is i know they're not adoption for them they have no adoption for that oh it has power yes temporary power people power people love your power um convention power and whatnot that's fine microphone power but not power with god not not jesus a man approved of god not that that can't come like that that has to be the right behavior but ram use the term the right kind of a son not sun right kind of it have plenty of different mangos you know oh here they are mangoes and mangoes the kind of mango you have plenty sons kind of sons you are the right kind and your behavior set you up to be the kind not your mysteries not your revelations you have to convert that into behavior you have to convert all the revelations into a behavior which is a life and that is what going to shake the devil up amen oh glory to god a man without character can reign because power apart from karate is satanic but power with characters for to rule and since he wanted to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and settling in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when it comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom too much tribulation so the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god disapproval neither the bright skies and still water signs of god's love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world how does he love us yes how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifest that he love us for he brought us to himself and give us his spirit placing us as sons how shall i prove my love to him are we ready everybody alive are we ready how shall i prove my love to him by conducting by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy i miss the trials he in his wisdom are those come to pass that's how you prove back your love to god conducting yourself with joy believing what he said joy because of he and his wisdom send those things now friends many things the people do and say i am not the judge of people but i think any ministry or any demonstration of the spirit of god that can't be backed up in this bible i would leave it alone if anything that anyone says that isn't backed up by the scripture i couldn't go with it although i wouldn't say it wasn't god till i seen the fruits of it then i wouldn't say nothing about it i'll just let it go like that so that is just a little side ba on this whole thing oh i'll skip that skip that the prophets of the old testament or any time they live in the presence of god until they become with the word the message is the word itself now the holy spirit will not misbehave i'm almost done music will come please the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it will make here we go it will make each person come into its character because it's a spirit that leads you you are not all that natural and you think you know there's a spirit influence in your life whatever spirit it is there's something influenced in your life let's let's trust is the right influence but the holy spirit would bring each person into its character because it's a spirit that leaves you it makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature the holy spirit makes you live and love to do it how you love to give up the things of the world when the holy spirit comes in all right every word in the bible is god taught satan's seed form and if they receive into a human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the bible it brings it to pass i'll skip that i'll skip that all right okay so brother bran i'm okay i'm getting there what am i talking about um each age god places two things into this church all right and showing that each individual that possess these qualities talk about the same virtues and this being this virtuous being is the church of god that's going to the rapture amen not this confession of mysteries no this being when it's completed is the church that's going to rapture okay are you with me hallelujah and this being when completed is a servant of god in the church of god that's going in the rapture so every minister have to complete that is being completed to go in the rapture you see when that big magnet come that magnet that rapture magnet i want you to look at it now the magnitude pickup cloth a magnet can't pick up wood so this rapture magnet could only pick up those virtues that magnet not coming for books and tips i have all but around books i have all brown tips you will stay with that for the tribulation with the books any tips that's not what the rapture is about he told that's part next part you have to display it apply it and display it display it everybody must see it remember in moses time take the blood and put it on your door post and this this this that when i see it i will pass over so there is something that must be displayed [Applause] not talked about i know pastors like to say your villain in mystery something manifesting yeah all right that sounds kind of good the manifestation is sons because they're revealing hidden mysteries but but remembering a lot of mysteries we can only echo what the prophecy ain't our mind reveal a mystery but i'm gonna be revealed you know that man off god they promised that it's almost one messenger to reveal every mystery that's why we could take the messenger and judge every minister you're not judging by his group you're judging my holy state with the word you can't judge me by my children you judge me oh i stay with the word that's the only way you authorize to judge me oh glory to god alone i'm on the word you can't take me off you can't take me out oh glory to god wants you on the word nobody can take you out hallelujah praise god amen glory so do you see it now all right it's maybe next week this is too much boy wow mamma mia we try to make weakness our excuses we want to tell how big we are how great we are and i think that's what god gave me this text for the little things that we do and we come to church is the fine way of false is that we can better ourselves we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong and the reason he chooses us when we say we are insufficient when we say uh i can't do it and you're feeling less down you're feeling unworthy you're feeling struggling he knows that and yet he choose you and he knows your spirit and your condition and he says the reason he chooses us because we're in that condition that sounds strange if god being willing we find out that weaknesses and rejections we find out that those people who are the weakest and rejected by the outside world is god heroes that's the conqueror in the front line those that feel himself unworthy i met his brother three of them they say but we just leave the holy ghost no should be saved gifts to the ministry i said don't do it let it alone he said because we need the holy ghost and we need gifts he said and become a stuffed shirt it is always those trying to get away from it he said don't seek nothing god got anything for you he'll give it to you notice it takes the weakest and rejected and practically every hero god ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person is in good shape so god can start using them i have no ability lord i can't talk this like that good shape when we are thinking that we are able to do it god can't use us because we wanted to do ourselves now watch so the other side we get these feelings and we think that we're insufficient we don't want to do it and if we listen to the call of god that's the very thing that god wants us to do when we are so here we go this is a big thing when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to god's spirit as long as we think we can do it we can't do it when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to god and he does it if it's us trying to do it we'll fail but if we yield ourselves to god then god can fail that's one thing you can't do is fail the important thing one of the important thing we must master remember this especially you young preachers and only members alike there's one thing you've got to master if you expect to fulfill god's desire in our lives we have to master the thought of human ability if we get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence our own abilities we've got to master in such a way that we can get rid of the things as laid aside so god can use us and make a complete surrender to us no ability when we are expecting saying this guy is a great person this is a great person i lean on him that this peace is god so when a minister put himself as the lamppost as a pill any house lean on me god hates that it must be him it must be him working through the ministry it might be him and the man then you see god isn't that right no ability i don't care whose it is will ever be usable in the sight of god god has to get all our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose he's got something for us to do as long as we feel we're doing a pretty good job he'll never be the use of god we have got together from human ability we have got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic whosoever we are we gotta surrender completely to god knowing we are nothing and then god starts from there he starts moving working that includes all of us oh my god but abraham said the reason that paul was fearing is not because he was scared of anything but he was scared he would displease god in some way and he will get his own ability mixed up into it so he said i didn't come with excellence of speech i come to you in fear that and so forth i come to know only christ and him crucified the greatest enemy i got is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one who gets to a place sometime where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that sure has got out the picture but when i can get rid of that guy then i could get to a place he's out of the way then god can come over and do things william branham knows nothing about how many ministers could god use this morning if they only let god bind them with his word with his power and lose them from the strength of their denomination and organization how many sins are people in the city this morning that goes to these great organization churches how many could fill with the holy ghost set this country of fire with the gospel and the power if they only take and lose themselves from the power that they have and be bound to the spirit power that paul had moses realized look i'm almost done i know i keep saying that but almost done moses realized god took him back to the wilderness to learn some human weaknesses the prince principles your custom being really managed in egypt i mean carpet rule for him they pour out his right hand ruling sorry he took him back to learn what it's all about so he and where where did he learn did he get a lesson god must have had a time with him back there mother had a temper and god gave my wife my name is japo she had won two so i imagine things wasn't so pleasing back on the back side it does it for a while when both of the temper gets out of the control at the same time i suppose his intellectual conception of whole psychology ought to control a person didn't do much good because he was because on his way down to egypt she said in the temple she said you're a bloody husband to me god was so angry that he'd look him at the end and he could have found him behind mislead watch human weaknesses here we go will never be used of god this is the point god by human weaknesses pours himself into you and he uses himself you just become an instrument because you got yourself out of the way did god feel sorry for moses with all his weaknesses say paul and moses something sure has happened to you you fell from your degree yeah yeah yeah great intellectual brother you had your phd you are weak no god wasn't sorry for him god never took pity on him god had him cured of all that stuff and he wasn't sorry for him oh my 40 years out there i had you once a poor person kinda wrong in the wilderness where they could find out their human riches or not and then and so forth oh my god i think i want to read this one can i read something for you somebody tell barbara he's such a nice man and nice person i'm so happy for that um there's one thing one thing wrong what's that sister assistant one thing but that if you could just compromise with a little doctrine you have every organism will receive you he said i said um what doctrine sister that baptism in jesus name i said but sister you couldn't expect me to compromise on the word and still be a servant of god she said well there's a bunch of ministers i'm here to represent out of this big city and i if you tell them that the angel of the lord that gives you these visions told you to baptize in jesus name they will be willing to accept it you hear that he said well i said their experience is weaker than this water i don't care what any angel would say if it ain't according to the word i don't believe it if that angel told me something different from that i wouldn't believe the angel god word is first above all angels that way you may say bring your angel and come because we have the word amen to judge what any angel is saying and paul's ever angels from heaven preach any of the gospel let them be a curse when jacob lost all his strength then god gave him power to become a prince when paul lost his education god made him a missionary to the gentiles when moses lost all of his ability and become weak god make him powerful to send him to egypt when you are weak then you are strong it's the simplicity of the gospel that staggers the people they try to make some great intellectual something it's the simpleness but god takes the very tool of humility and weakness and simplicity to work his work with oh maya talk about the little of the cattle demons going around powers of devils under the name of christianity teaching for doctrine the commandments of men who is strong enough who is wise enough to tame them legion stripping off the woman in the name of preachers who is strong enough to say the words that say that there's a miracle is past what we need oh god i feel it pointing around here now well when needs a prophet of god to rise up with a thunderbolt of god spiritual lightning that will shake the world to shame empty vessels is what he needs a call out church a little minority that will receive god's power and blessings that's what we need get them dear friends get weak deny your own ability amen you're on radio you'll never hear these tapes wherever they come empty yourselves out pour yourself off before god's alter let the angel come with the coal of fire fill that vessel with power from almighty god he'll make you strong finally come lord jesus catch away your church and if it be your will lord just before our church is raptured militarized power oh god fill these vessels raise them up lord shake this world once more we know it will pass time there will be no repentance it'll be too far but show your power lord fill those vessels shake them that they have not been shot before god bless you glory to god giving praise this evening oh hallelujah hallelujah giving praise right
