[3:02] Psalms 46 from verse one
[3:06] says, "God is our refuge and strength,
[3:10] very present help in trouble.
[3:13] Therefore will not we fear, though the
[3:16] earth be removed, though the mountains
[3:19] be carried into the midst of the sea,
[3:22] though the waters thereof be roar and be
[3:24] troubled, though the mountains shake
[3:27] with the swelling thereof s.
[3:30] There is a river, the streams whereof
[3:33] shall make glad the city of God, the
[3:36] holy place of the tabernacles of the
[3:39] most high. God is in the midst of her.
[3:43] She shall not be moved. God shall help
[3:46] her and that right.
[3:50] The heathen raged and the kingdoms were
[3:52] moved. He uttered his voice and the
[3:54] earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with
[3:58] us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[4:02] Sarah, may God have blessing to the
[4:04] reading of his word. Is the Lord your
[4:07] refuge this morning?
[4:09] Is he a hiding place this morning. And
[4:12] there's nowhere else to hide. You can

[4:17] only safe place that can be found. No

[47:58] could I go? Oh, I feel good this
[48:00] morning. Oh, tell me where could I go?
[48:05] Oh, tell [music] me where.
[48:08] only to Jesus.
[48:10] Seeking a refuge for my soul.
[48:18] Oh,
[48:21] tell [singing] me where could I go to
[48:24] one more time
[48:29] I go. Hallelujah.
[48:34] Seeking a refuge for my soul.
[48:39] Needed a friend
[48:42] to help me in the end.
[48:46] Oh
[48:48] go to the Lord. Can we give the Lord a
[48:52] hand of praise this morning?
[48:55] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[48:59] Feels good in the house of the Lord this
[49:01] morning. There's a sound of victory in
[49:04] the camp. There's a sound of overcoming
[49:07] in the camp. There's a sound that you're
[49:09] not going to give up in the camp.
[49:11] There's a sound that you're an overcomer
[49:13] in the camp. There's a sound that the
[49:15] devil didn't destroy you last week in
[49:17] the camp. There's a sound that you're
[49:19] still standing this morning in the camp.
[49:23] You may be seated for a few minutes.
[49:27] Amen. And it's certainly a great
[49:29] privilege to be in the house of the Lord
[49:31] this morning and to be able to give God
[49:34] praise and thanks. And as the prophet
[49:37] said, to let the devil know whose side
[49:39] you're on, to let the angels know whose
[49:41] side you're on, to let the Lord knows
[49:44] whose side you're on. Listen church,
[49:46] there are some songs that the angels
[49:48] cannot sing because they cannot have
[49:50] gone through your journey and your
[49:52] experience. So when you say, "Where
[49:54] could I go but to the Lord?" That's a
[49:55] song that the angels can't understand
[49:57] because you have to have been somewhere
[49:59] to go to the Lord. So, we are so happy
[50:01] this morning that we could be in the
[50:03] house of the Lord and we could stand
[50:04] with faith and confidence that he who
[50:06] started the work in us is more than able
[50:08] to bring it to pass. I'm fully persuaded
[50:11] that neither life nor death nor things
[50:13] past, present, or to come could separate
[50:16] us from the love of God which is in
[50:18] Christ Jesus concerning us this morning.
[50:20] Can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[50:23] certainly appreciate a song service
[50:24] brother Anthony and the atmosphere
[50:28] because you create a result. You have to
[50:30] control the atmosphere around you. You
[50:32] have to control the environment around
[50:34] you and that comes from the inside out.
[50:36] We are not influenced from the outside
[50:38] in. We are creatures of eternity trapped
[50:40] in time. And the prophet taught us that
[50:42] we are not even the believer but the
[50:44] word seen in us is a believer. That's
[50:46] why the Bible said greater is he that's
[50:48] in you than he that is in the world. And
[50:50] I want us to remember that inside of us
[50:53] is something more powerful than
[50:54] everything outside of us.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Can we say that one more time? There's
[50:58] something in us that's more powerful
[51:00] than anything else that's outside of us.
[51:03] And if we rest our faith and confidence
[51:05] on he who started the work, then nothing
[51:07] could stop you. Sickness cannot stop
[51:09] you. Disease cannot stop you. Oppression
[51:12] cannot stop you. Frustration cannot stop
[51:14] you. Depression cannot stop you. Nothing
[51:17] could stop you from coming into a full
[51:20] manifestation of who God called us to be
[51:23] this morning.
[51:25] Just a few announcements and a few
[51:27] comments before we get into the service
[51:29] this morning. And certainly I want to
[51:32] really salute the young people who had
[51:33] the fellowship yesterday. Let's put our
[51:35] hands together. It was beyond my
[51:38] expectation. It was an outstanding first
[51:42] salvo if I can say that into the vision
[51:45] that the Lord has placed on the hearts
[51:47] of a number of the young people who have
[51:48] a burden to see the young people set
[51:51] free and we were sharing with them and
[51:53] just a few brief comments you know about
[51:55] this concept of value.
[51:58] You know the world likes to place value
[52:00] on certain things and if you place value
[52:02] on what is temporal or what is temporary
[52:05] then that value is something that will
[52:07] fade away. But when you place value on
[52:10] something that is eternal, that value
[52:12] lasts forever. So we want to think about
[52:14] those things which are above. And I gave
[52:16] a very simple analogy to help the young
[52:18] people who were there. And I said, "If
[52:20] you bring a monkey into a room and
[52:23] present him with a banana or a bag of
[52:25] money and young uh Steven's youngest,
[52:29] young daughter Sarah, I asked Sarah.
[52:32] Sarah is how old Stephen?" She's seven
[52:34] years old. Said, "If Sarah could get it,
[52:36] everybody will get it."
[52:38] I said, "What will the monkey do if it
[52:40] sees a banana on one side and a bag of
[52:42] money on the other side?" And little
[52:44] Sarah said she will. the monkey will
[52:46] take the banana
[52:48] because it's the nature of the monkey to
[52:50] take the banana. The monkey doesn't have
[52:52] a revelation that with a bag of money he
[52:54] could buy a thousand bananas
[52:58] because his mind is not there. He's
[52:59] looking at this temporary satisfaction
[53:01] that he sees on this one banana. He
[53:03] doesn't have a revelation of the mystery
[53:05] that with the bag of money he could buy
[53:07] a plantation of bananas and have bananas
[53:09] for his great grandchildren.
[53:11] So he runs to this thing that he could
[53:12] see and he grabs this one thing that he
[53:14] could get right now and he walks away
[53:16] from the money because he doesn't see
[53:17] value to that thing. And that's how many
[53:20] times we live. We look at this temporary
[53:22] thing and we don't see this value of
[53:24] this eternal mystery of God. And at
[53:27] times and brother Steven came to me he
[53:28] said the first time he saw it this way
[53:30] because in a certain sense we are almost
[53:32] like those monkeys.
[53:34] The actual monkeys have no souls, but we
[53:36] have a soul. But many times it's as if
[53:38] God who is greater than us hiding than
[53:40] us. For he said, "My thoughts are higher
[53:41] than your thoughts. My ways are higher
[53:42] than your ways." And God is looking at
[53:44] us and saying, "But what's wrong with
[53:46] you? You keep going after this. You're
[53:48] you're you're into a monkey business.
[53:49] You keep going after this banana, this
[53:51] banana, and in this bag here is your
[53:53] health, is your healing, is eternal
[53:55] life, is your children, is your
[53:57] grandchildren. But you're going after
[53:58] this thing all the time, and you're
[54:00] satisfied with this temporary thing. But
[54:01] when you get a revelation into the mind
[54:04] of God that you are a creature of
[54:05] eternity, you'll go for that bag every
[54:07] single time. Because faith is the
[54:09] substance. It's purchasing power.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Faith is not the thing. No, no. It is
[54:14] the is the purchasing power. It's the
[54:16] evidence of what you cannot see yet. So
[54:18] you're looking at the bag. It's not a
[54:19] it's not a a thousand bananas yet, but
[54:21] it could get you that thousand bananas.
[54:23] So this morning, being here in the house
[54:25] of God is the most important meeting you
[54:27] could ever have. It's more important
[54:29] than your job because this could give
[54:31] you a better job this morning. It's more
[54:33] important than your doctor's appointment
[54:35] because this could prevent you from
[54:37] having to go to the doctor.
[54:40] Hallelujah. There's no place I'd rather
[54:42] be than in the presence of the Lord
[54:44] because in his presence there's fullness
[54:46] of joy. There's life ever more. There's
[54:48] the mystery of calling my name. Who I am
[54:51] in God. Not who I see myself but who God
[54:53] sees. Can the church say amen? So, I
[54:55] really want to salute the young people
[54:57] who were there and we'll have much more
[54:58] of that. And uh I want you to remember
[55:01] our pastor in prayer. He would have
[55:02] preached on Friday night in France. He
[55:04] would have preached in Germany on
[55:06] Saturday, which is last night. He would
[55:07] have preached in Germany again this
[55:08] morning. And he's on the move. So, may
[55:10] God give him strength
[55:12] and we are under great expectation. We
[55:15] would have sent out the announcement in
[55:17] the church group about our special
[55:19] meeting coming up on December 13th and
[55:22] 14th. And if you remember, we had
[55:25] Jonathan Martin in September. By the
[55:28] grace of God, we're looking for brother
[55:29] Andrew Glover to come minister to the
[55:31] portion of the bride here in Trinidad.
[55:33] Just like brother Jonathan, it will be
[55:35] his first time on this island and we are
[55:37] under great expectation. He has a
[55:39] tremendous ministry and I know that God
[55:41] has something very special for us. So,
[55:43] let's get ready. Let's make preparation
[55:45] for it. Let's be in the spirit. So,
[55:47] that's the 13th and 14th of December.
[55:50] School confirmed is closing on the 12th.
[55:53] So, have no excuse. They could be here
[55:56] on fire. They have no homework to do.
[55:58] They This is This is the best thing.
[56:00] This is the This is the real closing out
[56:02] of the of the school term. This is
[56:04] preparing for 2026 because this year is
[56:06] already done. And God in his grace and
[56:08] mercy has put things in place so we
[56:10] could close it this year with a shout.
[56:11] All the victory you didn't have this
[56:13] whole year, this is the season now to
[56:15] claim it. What the devil took from you,
[56:17] what you didn't get to possess, this is
[56:19] the season to possess it. Even before
[56:21] the meeting comes, you in a mode of
[56:23] possession. you in a mode of walking on
[56:24] top of the devil, walking on top of your
[56:26] promise, claiming your inheritance
[56:28] because this is this is your season.
[56:33] Last Wednesday I said if everything is
[56:35] all right, you don't need faith.
[56:38] If your life is perfect and you have no
[56:40] issues, what you need faith for? Faith
[56:43] becomes relevant and necessary when
[56:45] there is a gap between where you want to
[56:47] be and where you are. And the further
[56:49] this gap is, the more faith you need.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? And faith is
[56:53] the currency of God's economy. So when
[56:56] God wants to see your bank account of
[56:58] faith high, then he creates and allows
[57:00] gaps to exist, gaps of sickness, gaps of
[57:03] issues so that faith could be spent.
[57:05] Because if there was no situation, then
[57:07] there's no currency, there's no economy,
[57:10] there's no transactions. Do you know the
[57:12] natural economy will die up if there's
[57:14] no transactions?
[57:17] What cripples an economy is when there's
[57:19] no transaction? Nobody buying or selling
[57:21] or doing anything. You in your house,
[57:22] everybody. No, then the place is dead.
[57:26] God has a whole bank up in the sky. He
[57:30] has healing on this shelf. He has
[57:32] deliverance on this shelf. And he's
[57:34] looking for people to come and do some
[57:35] spiritual commercial activity. Make a
[57:38] withdrawal of faith. Hallelujah. Brother
[57:41] Brandon give the analogy of signing the
[57:43] check.
[57:45] He said when you're adopted, your
[57:46] signature is just as good as the
[57:47] father's signature. But they need a
[57:49] check because they will honor the check.
[57:52] And the check from the our father, it
[57:54] don't bounce. If you pay for your
[57:56] salvation, it paid for. It don't bounce.
[57:59] If you pay for redemption, it paid for.
[58:01] This check cannot bounce.
[58:04] You could write on that check whatever
[58:05] you need this morning. You have back
[58:07] pain, write back pain on that check and
[58:09] cash it out this morning.
[58:12] You don't have joy, write joy on the
[58:14] check. Cash it out. It's good. It's a
[58:15] good check. This check could work
[58:17] anywhere. Even the devil respects this
[58:20] check because it's the Oh, come on now.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to leave here
[58:25] sick. You don't have to leave here
[58:26] depressed. You don't have to leave here
[58:28] discouraged. You are more than a
[58:29] conqueror. Put a smile on your face.
[58:32] Lift up your head. Square your shoulders
[58:34] back. You are creatures born to
[58:37] tabernacle the Holy Ghost.
[58:40] The Holy Ghost is looking for a house
[58:41] this morning. And the house is not
[58:43] headstone tabernacle. The house is right
[58:45] here. You and you and you and you and
[58:47] you. The Holy Ghost is looking for a
[58:48] tabernacle this morning. Will you give
[58:51] him yours?
[58:57] Hallelujah.
[58:59] So stay on fire.
[59:02] Exercise your faith. Brother described
[59:04] faith is something to have hair on its
[59:05] chest. In other words, in the face of
[59:07] the opposition, let faith speak. What
[59:10] words you use is the product of your
[59:12] faith.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Don't walk around. I shared on Wednesday
[59:16] night that woman who had a son who died
[59:18] when she was moving fast. They say
[59:20] what's going on? Why you breaking your
[59:21] speed limit? You say all is well because
[59:24] she would not let come out of her mouth
[59:26] anything negative. She would not let
[59:28] come out of her mouth the problem she
[59:29] was dealing with. She knew that if she
[59:32] could just get to the prophet Elijah,
[59:33] all is well. And she was living in such
[59:36] faith she already see it as a finished
[59:37] work. All is well. Don't interrupt me
[59:40] with your foolishness. Don't interrupt
[59:42] me with your unbelief. If you don't want
[59:44] to believe, that's up to you. But all is
[59:46] well this morning. All is well. I'm
[59:48] already healed. All is well. My family's
[59:51] already delivered. All is well. I'm
[59:53] already rejoicing. All is well. I've got
[59:55] peace ever more. All is well. My bank
[59:58] account has money in it. All is well.
[1:00:00] Don't I don't care what the banker says
[1:00:03] because my bank is not here. It's in the
[1:00:05] sky. I don't care what the doctor's
[1:00:07] report said. All is well. I don't care
[1:00:10] how I feel. All is well. All is well.
[1:00:15] All is well. Turn to your neighbor and
[1:00:16] say, "All is well."
[1:00:20] Hallelujah.
[1:00:22] Turn to your other neighbor and say,
[1:00:23] "All is well." Do you know when you say
[1:00:25] those words, the devil is trembling?
[1:00:27] Because the devil want to give you a
[1:00:29] mind battle that you have this problem
[1:00:30] and that problem. But we are letting the
[1:00:32] devil know this morning, all is well.
[1:00:34] The Lord gives. The Lord take it away.
[1:00:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord. All is
[1:00:39] well. He's a healer. He's a way maker.
[1:00:41] He's a restorer. He's a baptizer. He
[1:00:44] promised a revival. He promised healing.
[1:00:46] He promised deliverance. He promised
[1:00:48] breakthrough. He promised to open the
[1:00:50] blind eyes. He promised to heal cancer.
[1:00:52] He promised to destroy diabetes. He
[1:00:54] promised to break the grip of high blood
[1:00:57] pressure, female condition, the curse of
[1:00:59] poverty. I don't care what it is. All is
[1:01:03] well.
[1:01:10] Victorious vibrations. When you walk,
[1:01:12] the devil must tremble. Oh, you don't
[1:01:14] hear me this morning. I'm tired of being
[1:01:16] on the defensive. Let's get on the
[1:01:18] offensive. We are taking back what the
[1:01:21] devil took from us. We have a right to
[1:01:23] do it. We have the authority to do it.
[1:01:26] We have been called to do it.
[1:01:32] Hallelujah.
[1:01:33] Hallelujah.
[1:01:35] This joy that I have, the world didn't
[1:01:37] give it to me. Cigarette cannot give you
[1:01:39] this. Drugs cannot give you this.
[1:01:41] Alcohol cannot give you this. A party,
[1:01:44] they could try, but it cannot do this
[1:01:45] thing.
[1:01:49] Brother George, I'm just testing the
[1:01:51] temperature.
[1:01:52] I'm just testing the temperature.
[1:01:54] Hallelujah. Some people look like the
[1:01:57] devil punch you this way and punch it
[1:01:58] this way. Do you know that you could
[1:02:00] punch the devil back?
[1:02:06] There's a quote where the brother said
[1:02:08] whack him.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; And if it don't work the first time,
[1:02:12] what what did the prophet say? Whack him
[1:02:13] again.
[1:02:16] And if it don't work again, what he
[1:02:17] said? Whack him again. So what we come
[1:02:20] to do here this morning, we come to
[1:02:21] whack the devil.
[1:02:25] I'm tired of being the one against the
[1:02:27] ropes. I'm tired of being the one
[1:02:30] against the wall. It's time we put the
[1:02:32] devil on the wall. It's time we push
[1:02:34] back. It's time we say healing today,
[1:02:36] not tomorrow. Now faith is today. Today.
[1:02:40] Today. The young people will go free
[1:02:42] today. The Holy Ghost must pour out
[1:02:44] today.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm so excited.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Keep the motors humming. God has a
[1:02:58] special plan for your life.
[1:03:01] Listen,
[1:03:04] the government could have plans. Your
[1:03:06] school could have plans. I'm not talking
[1:03:08] about those plans. God has a plan for
[1:03:10] your life.
[1:03:13] And that plan, he said, "I know the
[1:03:14] plans." Oh, come,
[1:03:18] plans of peace, plans of joy, plans to
[1:03:21] bring you to an expected end. God is not
[1:03:23] now designing your life.
[1:03:26] God is not now trying to figure out what
[1:03:28] am I going to do with brother George?
[1:03:30] What am I going to do with sister
[1:03:31] Williams? What am I going to do with
[1:03:32] brother Steven? God already sees you
[1:03:34] victorious.
[1:03:37] You are walking through the tape of your
[1:03:38] life and God say, "I know the ending."
[1:03:45] You may be seated. I'm getting ready to
[1:03:47] close out. Listen, you ever sit down
[1:03:49] next to somebody and you're watching a
[1:03:50] movie and they say, "I know the ending."
[1:03:55] It could be frustrating because they
[1:03:57] they're talking to you next. I don't
[1:04:00] want to know.
[1:04:02] I trying to enjoy the thing and they
[1:04:05] they pushing. Hey, hey, look him, look
[1:04:06] him. Look under the table. Oh gosh.
[1:04:08] Well, let me figure that out.
[1:04:11] But in this story of your life, God
[1:04:13] don't see all the parts
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; because that's how full knowledge works.
[1:04:17] That leads to predestination. And in all
[1:04:19] the parts when your family excited and
[1:04:22] you stressed out, God saying, "Don't
[1:04:24] worry about that part." The angel's
[1:04:26] looking at the tape and the angel's
[1:04:27] doing and Don't don't worry about that
[1:04:30] part. Bookie box like don't worry about
[1:04:33] that part. I know what happening next.
[1:04:37] When your favorite character in trouble,
[1:04:39] you wondering if they're going to make
[1:04:41] it into it. And God is saying, "Don't
[1:04:42] worry. There's another part coming.
[1:04:45] There's another piece of the movie.
[1:04:46] There's another part of the story. Wait
[1:04:48] till you get to the end. It'll all come
[1:04:51] together. Wait till you get to the end
[1:04:53] of the story. You'll see how strong he
[1:04:55] is, how powerful he is. the seed that's
[1:04:58] in him that the devil could never have
[1:05:00] destroyed. You don't hear me this
[1:05:02] morning.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. He knows the
[1:05:08] end from the beginning. So, I want to
[1:05:11] encourage you when we come to church on
[1:05:13] Sunday, this is the Lord's day. It's a
[1:05:17] You're supposed to be so excited to be
[1:05:18] here on a Sunday. You can't wait. You're
[1:05:20] counting down the week Sunday is coming.
[1:05:30] Hallelujah. Everybody feeling fine?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand to our feet this
[1:05:34] morning. We're going to hear from our
[1:05:34] pastor a special message for you. Living
[1:05:37] under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:39] And I know it's going to be a tremendous
[1:05:40] blessing to you. God bless you,
[1:05:42] brothers. Let's switch over. Stay on
[1:05:45] fire. God bless you, Richie.
[1:05:57] Let
[1:06:06] [singing]
[1:06:07] your hands
[1:06:16] angle.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:39] Hallelu
[1:06:44] [music]
[1:06:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] Jesus.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Lift up your voices.
[1:07:03] Lift up your hands right now.
[1:07:28] Now give the Lord a shout of praise
[1:07:29] right now. Lift up your voices. Give the
[1:07:32] Lord a shout of praise right now.
[1:07:35] Hallelujah.
[1:07:37] Glory is here.
[1:07:39] The glory of his presence, the same Holy
[1:07:42] Ghost, the same Jesus is here.
[1:07:46] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:07:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:07:52] Thank you for the praise. Thank you for
[1:07:54] your presence. Hallelujah. Keep praising
[1:07:56] him. Keep worshiping.
[1:08:33] Hallelujah.
[1:08:40] Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:08:45] Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] Glory
[1:09:10] God. Without a doubt we know something
[1:09:13] is fixing to happen. Without a doubt, we
[1:09:16] know that we are coming to the closing
[1:09:18] of
[1:09:20] a doubt
[1:09:21] to be prepared for your coming. That's
[1:09:24] why Elijah to turn our hearts back to
[1:09:27] the faith of the fathers. Father anoint
[1:09:33] them to your word today. Father become
[1:09:37] flesh among us that the invisible
[1:09:40] visible grant in Jesus name we ask it.
[1:09:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:09] Hallelujah.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[1:10:14] Greetings from Paris.
[1:10:24] This morning
[1:10:30] 2122
[1:10:32] want to go 24-23.
[1:10:54] And when he had said,
[1:11:01] he showed unto him his hands and his
[1:11:03] side, Then glad when they saw the
[1:11:10] Jesus unto them again
[1:11:13] as my father had sent me.
[1:11:15] And when he had said this, he breathed
[1:11:18] on them and said unto them, receive the
[1:11:21] Holy Ghost.
[1:11:29] And he said unto them, these are the
[1:11:31] words which I speak unto you. while I
[1:11:34] was yet with you that all things must be
[1:11:37] fulfilled which were written in the law
[1:11:40] of Moses and in the in the in the
[1:11:44] prophets and in the Psalms concerning
[1:11:46] me. Then open their understanding that
[1:11:50] they might understand the scriptures.
[1:11:52] And he said unto them, "Thus it is
[1:11:54] written and thus it be Christ to suffer
[1:11:57] and to rise from the dead the third day
[1:11:59] that repentance and remission of sins
[1:12:02] should be preached in his name among all
[1:12:05] nations at Jerusalem and your witnesses
[1:12:08] of these things. And behold, I send the
[1:12:10] promise of my father upon you the city
[1:12:13] of Jerusalem until you be on high." And
[1:12:17] he led them out as far as he lifted up
[1:12:21] his hands and blessed them. And it came
[1:12:23] to pass while he blessed them from them
[1:12:26] and carried up in heaven. And they
[1:12:28] worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem
[1:12:31] with great joy. And they were
[1:12:32] continually in the temple praising
[1:12:35] blessing. Revelation 5.
[1:12:42] And when he had taken the book, the four
[1:12:44] beasts and the 420 elders before the
[1:12:47] lamb, having every one of them
[1:12:50] full of the praise of the saints, they s
[1:12:54] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:12:56] seas thereof. For thou was slain, has
[1:12:58] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:13:01] every kindred and tongue and people and
[1:13:03] nation, and has made us unto our God
[1:13:05] kings and priests. We shall reign on the
[1:13:07] earth. And I beheld and I heard the
[1:13:10] voice of many angels round about the
[1:13:11] throne and the beast and the elders and
[1:13:14] the number of them was 10,000 times
[1:13:16] 10,000 and thousands of thousand saying
[1:13:19] with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb
[1:13:21] that was slain to receive power and
[1:13:23] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:13:25] and glory and blessing and every
[1:13:27] creature which is in heaven and on the
[1:13:29] earth and under the earth and such as in
[1:13:32] the sea and all that are in them. I sing
[1:13:35] blessing and honor and glory and
[1:13:38] unto him that sit upon the throne and
[1:13:40] unto the lamb forever and ever. And the
[1:13:42] four beast said, "Amen." And the four
[1:13:44] and 20 elders fell and worship him that
[1:13:47] live forever and ever. Let us pray one
[1:13:49] more time. Father, we thank you for your
[1:13:51] word. We pray come and interpret to our
[1:13:53] hearts and may pour out your spirit and
[1:13:55] confirm your word with signs, wonders,
[1:13:57] and miracles. We pray bless those here.
[1:13:59] Bless those connected us on the
[1:14:00] internet. May your spirit flow freely
[1:14:02] and speak to every heart. We pray in
[1:14:04] Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And amen.
[1:14:06] You will be seated. Oh, praise God. Oh,
[1:14:09] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a good thing to be in the house
[1:14:15] of God.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; It's always a privilege to be in the
[1:14:18] house of God.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; God give you health and strength and
[1:14:21] your you are here. You want to get the
[1:14:23] benefit of being here in the service of
[1:14:25] the Lord. Amen. How many appreciate the
[1:14:27] service last Sunday?
[1:14:31] Not by might, nor by power, but by my
[1:14:33] spirit. God bless you, brother Isaac.
[1:14:35] That was
[1:14:36] message
[1:14:38] that was some sermon I tell you my god
[1:14:42] my mind was totally blown
[1:14:44] oh my so enjoyed it I was able to take
[1:14:47] it across there France
[1:14:50] so we are not creating a new standard
[1:14:52] the standard already exists
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; oh praise God a standard of holiness
[1:14:57] standard of righteousness standard of
[1:15:00] purity a standard of forgiveness a
[1:15:03] standard of seven living voices the
[1:15:05] stand always was and always will be.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; The standard is Jesus Christ.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:15:14] Only only the Lord can put these things
[1:15:16] together like that. Oh my. The people
[1:15:18] have been taught the church has a
[1:15:20] standard but left the standard. When
[1:15:23] brother left the earth, he didn't the
[1:15:25] standard didn't leave. Isn't that right?
[1:15:27] The standard was in the hand of the
[1:15:29] spirit and the spirit revealed it to
[1:15:32] whomsoever he will.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; So nobody
[1:15:36] what the spirit can reveal. Isn't that
[1:15:38] wonderful? So the spirit can reveal the
[1:15:40] whooever he will. Isn't that right?
[1:15:43] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So the
[1:15:44] standard was always here. Isn't that
[1:15:46] right? In the hand of the spirit. The
[1:15:49] Holy Ghost is the standard bearer that
[1:15:51] will stand with any man who stands with
[1:15:54] the word. I love that.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the standard bearer.
[1:15:58] We stand with any man who stays with the
[1:16:00] word. And this is the bomb for me. The
[1:16:03] spirit has no loyalty to man.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He only has loyalty to his word.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Do you see it now?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; The spirit have no loyalty to any man.
[1:16:14] So why run after a man? Praise God. Stay
[1:16:17] with the word.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Fight for
[1:16:21] the word. Stand by the word. The word is
[1:16:25] God.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. This is so beautifully
[1:16:30] phrased. obedience to the entire word
[1:16:34] entitles you to be acer.
[1:16:38] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Love that.
[1:16:44] Entitle you to the Holy Ghost. Entitled
[1:16:46] to the token. Follow me to the entire
[1:16:48] word. Entitle you to be by the standard
[1:16:53] is the spirit that follows the word.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, you are free this morning
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; to be what God made you to be. Isn't
[1:17:01] that right?
[1:17:04] I so enjoy that message. I was
[1:17:07] tremendously blessed. Praise God. Is a
[1:17:10] message I want to get on print or put it
[1:17:12] out that you can read it. Something that
[1:17:14] you really consider. Praise God. That
[1:17:16] God will follow his word. You see, when
[1:17:18] you go down deeper, you realize no
[1:17:20] respector of persons. I don't care if
[1:17:21] you're pastor, son, pastor, daughter,
[1:17:23] elder son, elder daughter, deacon son,
[1:17:25] deacon daughter, deacon elder. It
[1:17:26] doesn't matter who you think you are,
[1:17:28] what you are. God's standard is his word
[1:17:30] and we have to come up to his word
[1:17:33] doesn't matter what position somebody
[1:17:34] hold as I told them in parish God is not
[1:17:36] adopting the position he's adopting the
[1:17:38] man so you don't get to engineer a
[1:17:41] doctor that is irrelevant what are you
[1:17:43] as a person
[1:17:45] what are you as a person
[1:17:52] youise
[1:17:56] when I come to church I don't That has
[1:17:57] nothing to do.
[1:18:00] He want you. Praise God. We told them in
[1:18:03] Paris
[1:18:04] is a father. He want that connection
[1:18:07] between you and him. Praise God. Church
[1:18:09] supposed to be to rescue man and
[1:18:12] reconcile man and bring back to God. Not
[1:18:16] a system, not a church, but back to God.
[1:18:19] But when you leave here and you make
[1:18:21] your prayer, God can answer your prayer
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; because there's a deep inside of you.
[1:18:25] There's a cry inside of you. I'm
[1:18:28] sinking. Who is talking?
[1:18:32] Lord, let me
[1:18:37] restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[1:18:39] Who is talking? A son is talking. Do I
[1:18:42] hear him in the house?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, God is not interested
[1:18:52] in your party. interesting you come into
[1:18:54] maturity fire under your seat if you
[1:18:57] have to because you want to have a
[1:18:59] perfect church and have a perfect man
[1:19:02] boy inherit nothing you can't possess
[1:19:04] nothing in immaturity you got to come to
[1:19:06] accept responsibility I will arise I
[1:19:09] will say unto my father I have s I have
[1:19:12] failed and I
[1:19:15] can say amen somebody
[1:19:21] might by power but by my spirit say God
[1:19:26] Almighty.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every kingdom is shaken.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Every kingdom is shaking.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Europe shaking. America shaking.
[1:19:39] Everything is rocking. You know the
[1:19:41] world is actually falling apart. So why
[1:19:44] you want the world? When everything is
[1:19:46] mashed up all around you. Oh glory to
[1:19:49] God. We have a word that cannot be
[1:19:51] moved. Heaven will pass away. But this
[1:19:54] word will never pass away.
[1:19:59] America don't even know what they have.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; My Jesus. Thank God. God's kingdom is
[1:20:07] not election.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; By man's election and man.
[1:20:12] Thank God. You don't have the people's
[1:20:13] vote to vote into this position and vote
[1:20:15] into that position in the kingdom of
[1:20:16] God. God have election. His election is
[1:20:21] his
[1:20:22] chosen. And if God chose to deliver you
[1:20:25] this morning, there's not enough devils
[1:20:27] last night, last year is not enough that
[1:20:29] could stop you from your deliverance
[1:20:31] tonight. I believe this morning that
[1:20:33] somebody going to be set freeise.
[1:20:38] This church is a different church. This
[1:20:39] is avereign church. We do what we want
[1:20:42] to do, how we want to do it. We have no
[1:20:44] bishop. We have nobody to tell us what
[1:20:47] to do and how to do it. We We have a
[1:20:49] revival this morning. We have a revival
[1:20:51] this morning. We feel old sillmon
[1:20:55] chasing. You name it, we can
[1:20:58] praise God because we can speak it and
[1:21:01] see it come to pass. Lord shout in the
[1:21:03] house.
[1:21:08] Praise God. Amen.
[1:21:18] time in Paris.
[1:21:20] Praise the name of the Lord. Praise God.
[1:21:23] We fight
[1:21:25] to do the people over fight and then
[1:21:27] leave inheritance. We have seen the
[1:21:29] Lord. That was a group testimony of the
[1:21:31] disciples Christ resurrection ministry.
[1:21:33] We have seen the Lord since we have seen
[1:21:35] the Lord. Seen revelation inspiration.
[1:21:37] We have seen the Lord. But that was that
[1:21:40] seeing the Lord is to point us to
[1:21:42] dynamics in the upper room.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Jesus staying with them,
[1:21:45] walking with them. No, he raised from
[1:21:46] the dead.
[1:21:48] to open their understanding and open the
[1:21:51] word. That is all. Because once your
[1:21:54] understanding is open and the word is
[1:21:56] your word is open to you, you know what
[1:21:58] you have to possess.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You know where you have to go.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; There is no other way to go. There's
[1:22:04] only one place. The place of that
[1:22:06] position of the upper room. And in that
[1:22:08] upper room, they were praising and
[1:22:09] blessing God now and again once in a
[1:22:12] while when they feel like that's not
[1:22:14] what the Bible says. They were praising
[1:22:16] God continually and you have to learn to
[1:22:20] do that your trying circumstance you
[1:22:23] have headache pain whatever it is
[1:22:26] disasters you have to still worship
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; because it's a promise praise God
[1:22:31] hallelujah
[1:22:33] is a promise to you amen
[1:22:37] this morning living under the
[1:22:38] inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; that's my title this morning living
[1:22:43] under the inspiration of the holy
[1:22:46] You don't want to live under demon
[1:22:47] powers. You don't want to live under the
[1:22:49] world. You don't want to live under your
[1:22:51] feeling and emotions. You don't want to
[1:22:52] live under that. You want to be living
[1:22:54] under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:22:56] Spirit. And I have inspiration. These
[1:22:59] are the words. That's the first thing
[1:23:01] Jesus told them. These are the words. He
[1:23:03] didn't give them more words and new
[1:23:05] words.
[1:23:06] the same words that he had before.
[1:23:10] Hallelujah. Bring it back and make it
[1:23:11] more positive. Give the Lord a shout in
[1:23:14] the house.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:23:18] Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, don't be discouraged
[1:23:24] this morning. The Holy Spirit is with
[1:23:26] you. He's looking over you. Isn't that
[1:23:29] right?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. All right, let's go.
[1:23:32] Bible says I want to Isaac preached but
[1:23:35] Isaac preached but Satan makes appealing
[1:23:38] his shows and so it's appealing is
[1:23:40] appealing but the enemy keeps finding a
[1:23:42] better bait.
[1:23:44] had to keep improving his tactics but he
[1:23:46] had to strip off a little more and so
[1:23:50] right
[1:23:53] to his
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to make his word more
[1:23:56] prettier
[1:23:59] and so on
[1:24:04] his to make it more appealing the only
[1:24:07] thing he has to do is to raise up a
[1:24:10] standard of his own word against the
[1:24:13] enemy.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said when the enemy
[1:24:16] comees,
[1:24:22] what does he do? He makes the word that
[1:24:26] he already said more.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; So that's why Jesus come and tell them
[1:24:36] these are the words. I come to make
[1:24:39] positive to you because I want to give
[1:24:41] you an absolute
[1:24:43] guarantee that this promise of the
[1:24:46] father, it is guaranteed.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:24:51] upon you. It is guaranteed. So, I'm
[1:24:53] going to raise a standard in your
[1:24:55] spirit, in your life. Then he brea upon
[1:24:58] them receiving the Holy Ghost. The
[1:25:01] breath of God was upon them. They were
[1:25:03] living under anointing, anointing of
[1:25:06] promise, anointing of dynamics, anointed
[1:25:09] to receive.
[1:25:10] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise
[1:25:14] God. Praise his wonderful name.
[1:25:17] Hallelujah.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? So what says he
[1:25:22] takes the word that he already said and
[1:25:25] make it more positive. Hallelujah.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Not not not new words, not not new
[1:25:33] mysteries. Same ones he was telling them
[1:25:35] all along. You have to make it more real
[1:25:37] to them.
[1:25:39] In the last
[1:25:41] new
[1:25:47] year, the more they hear, the more they
[1:25:49] feel good about what they do. See, but
[1:25:51] this is not that.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus was talking to them. They wasn't
[1:25:54] catching a lot of stuff he was telling
[1:25:56] them because they didn't have
[1:25:57] revelation. You see, revelation gives
[1:26:00] you a certain behavior.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I don't care what country you're from,
[1:26:04] what language you speak, revelation
[1:26:06] comes from God.
[1:26:08] Not from what you read and study. That's
[1:26:10] your study. But when it's revealed, it
[1:26:12] brings stimulation. It brings
[1:26:14] excitement. It brings real expectation.
[1:26:17] Isn't that right? So brother says, you
[1:26:19] know, the Bible says when the enemy
[1:26:21] comes
[1:26:23] up and God, there we go. When God gives
[1:26:27] his church a blessing and they move
[1:26:30] along with that blessing
[1:26:32] until it become the world, then they
[1:26:35] begin to run it down. Then the spirit of
[1:26:38] God comes in and raise up a standard
[1:26:40] again and there's a breaking for a
[1:26:42] revival or something. The message going
[1:26:45] slow
[1:26:47] to get it right and righteous and know
[1:26:49] everything
[1:26:52] but there's no revival
[1:26:55] comfortable in the comfort zone and so
[1:26:57] on but afterward
[1:26:59] a revival breaks out.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And we have a promise.
[1:27:04] What we see happen should put every soul
[1:27:06] in action. It should make a church that
[1:27:08] would make a revival that people be
[1:27:10] flying from Europe to see what's taking
[1:27:13] place. Not here to see. They will say
[1:27:17] there's a place in Arizona called
[1:27:18] Maricopa Valley, a city called Phoenix.
[1:27:21] There is something broke out there that
[1:27:23] the seven th
[1:27:32] that the prophet
[1:27:33] Speak of
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; praise God. Not the bunch of churches
[1:27:36] all around. No, not that. No, this
[1:27:39] prophecy here. These are the words.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. These are the words you
[1:27:45] have to connect with. These are the
[1:27:47] words. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:27:50] Praise God. So he contin
[1:28:00] of his last seven angels church age what
[1:28:02] the mystery of God all about God how God
[1:28:06] is but one God all these things will be
[1:28:08] finished at that time the great battles
[1:28:11] back had got these loose ends hanging
[1:28:14] out ought to be wrapped up together in
[1:28:16] this age so the thunders could all the
[1:28:19] loose ends had to be tied
[1:28:21] before you could get your portion the
[1:28:22] loose in your life have to be tied up.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So brother, we end
[1:28:29] the Holy Spirit influence us to the word
[1:28:34] of God.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Let God do the influencing in our hearts
[1:28:39] and not be influenced by others. But as
[1:28:41] I said, a powerful thing that people can
[1:28:43] get desensitized to the Holy Spirit. But
[1:28:46] the Holy Spirit will bring conviction.
[1:28:47] Holy Spirit will bring you wrong. You
[1:28:49] should
[1:28:51] I told him in Paris, I rather somebody
[1:28:54] wrong in their
[1:28:56] right in their
[1:28:58] right and wrong in their spirit. When
[1:29:01] somebody right in their spirit, they
[1:29:02] could be corrected.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; When somebody wrong in their spirit,
[1:29:05] that's terrible.
[1:29:11] But they're wrong in their spirit. Oh,
[1:29:13] that's a religious spirit. That's a
[1:29:15] demon, actually. Oh, hallelujah. Praise
[1:29:18] the name of the Lord. So watch, let the
[1:29:20] Holy Spirit influence us to the word of
[1:29:22] God and let God do the influence in our
[1:29:25] hearts and not be influenced by others.
[1:29:29] This ought to put us in action with
[1:29:31] reverence and humility. The pill of fire
[1:29:34] among us again in the last days he will
[1:29:37] pour out his spirit.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe this is your promise?
[1:29:42] believe this is your promise that you
[1:29:44] have promised the spirit upon your life.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:29:51] Lord, confirm it right now.
[1:29:54] While I'm before your throne, take every
[1:29:56] one of these people, Lord. Take the
[1:29:58] world out of us. Take me, Lord, while we
[1:30:00] are here in your presence. Just take the
[1:30:02] world. Ring our hearts, God, right now.
[1:30:05] Pull the world and the cares of the
[1:30:06] world away from us. Let us be
[1:30:08] consecrated Christians, oh God, to be
[1:30:10] loving and kind and sweet, bearing the
[1:30:12] fruit of the spirit, won't you, Lord? We
[1:30:15] throne. Sain
[1:30:17] on every one of us, but your blood can
[1:30:19] remit it Lord. Make it white as snow.
[1:30:22] Grant it while we are waiting upon you.
[1:30:24] Take us. We are yours. Consecrated our
[1:30:27] lives to you in Jesus name. Grant it
[1:30:28] Lord to each one of us. Ring my heart
[1:30:30] out Lord. I see all my errors. You are
[1:30:34] not here to see somebody else errors.
[1:30:36] You are here to see what problem you
[1:30:38] have. Everybody here if you fix up, you
[1:30:40] don't have to come here. You don't sick
[1:30:42] people coming here. People that have
[1:30:44] needs come here. People looking for
[1:30:45] deliverance, they come here. People
[1:30:47] looking for breakthrough and help, they
[1:30:48] come here. Hallelujah. People don't know
[1:30:50] what to do, they come here, too. Praise
[1:30:52] God. You're not coming here because
[1:30:54] you're right. They come here because
[1:30:55] you're wrong. And you need a
[1:30:57] breakthrough. You're not coming here
[1:30:58] because
[1:31:00] not nice and you're looking for God to
[1:31:02] intervene. You're looking for
[1:31:04] supernatural breakthrough. Then you're
[1:31:05] in the right place. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:31:08] You're not coming to find no
[1:31:11] deliverance. Oh, blessed be the name of
[1:31:14] the Lord. You're not coming here to see
[1:31:15] who, where, what. That's none of your
[1:31:17] business. Mind your own business. You're
[1:31:20] coming to fight for your portion. To
[1:31:22] fight for your soul. Oh, glory to God.
[1:31:25] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ring my heart, Lord. I see
[1:31:31] all my errors. I see my God from this
[1:31:35] time. I'm trying to live the best that I
[1:31:38] can.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to go. I want to you across
[1:31:43] here this morning after bringing this
[1:31:45] indictment against my man friends out
[1:31:46] there. I have to say these hard things.
[1:31:48] Lord, I did it by your inspiration. I
[1:31:51] feel you told me to do it. Now it's off
[1:31:54] my shoulders. I'm glad it's off. Let
[1:31:56] them do it whatever they will. Father, I
[1:31:58] pray they will accept it. I pray it
[1:32:00] would save everyone. Lord, may there
[1:32:03] come for a revival of the justy
[1:32:09] prophecy and pray
[1:32:12] for a revival of the just and a great
[1:32:15] power come among the churches just
[1:32:18] before it is going.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; It is not too hard to pray that because
[1:32:23] you promised it and we are looking for
[1:32:26] that
[1:32:28] we knew do great things in our midst.
[1:32:34] It's not too hard to pray because he
[1:32:37] promises. And if he promises, God can't
[1:32:40] lie.
[1:32:42] The Lord
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Do you love that quote?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; The revival of the just. Who is the
[1:32:56] just? The justified.
[1:33:01] You are justified as
[1:33:07] talking foolishness who God justify who
[1:33:11] cannal
[1:33:33] Hallelujah.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; That means for you to be justified, you
[1:33:38] have to get a revelation that your name
[1:33:40] is on the book.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; That means you have to get a revelation
[1:33:48] of Elohim.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Before there was a moon, before there
[1:33:51] was a star, before there was a molecule,
[1:33:53] before there was a beginning, before the
[1:33:56] You were there. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:34:03] Praise God.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:34:09] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; This morning, brother sent me this
[1:34:17] morning. Scripture, the blood of Jesus
[1:34:18] Christ, his son from all sorts
[1:34:23] of
[1:34:24] you. You know, Christian doesn't have
[1:34:26] any sin initially
[1:34:42] the blood of the lamb
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; God does not impute to you anything
[1:34:47] that's done because you are under the
[1:34:49] blood and he doesn't see it
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; there is a blood sacrifice the only can
[1:34:55] see you in the way he show you before
[1:34:58] the foundation of the world when he put
[1:35:01] your name in the lamb's book of life.
[1:35:03] That is all he can look at because you
[1:35:06] are redeemed from everything that was
[1:35:09] ever done. You are in the blood of the
[1:35:12] lamb. Therefore, there is no in you.
[1:35:15] There is no unclean habit in you because
[1:35:18] that the blood of the lamb have did this
[1:35:20] and God cannot impute sin to you after
[1:35:24] you got sin offering laying waiting for
[1:35:27] you. Oh hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Well you say I can do what I want to do
[1:35:33] always. But when a man can see what
[1:35:35] Jesus done for him and turn and do
[1:35:38] something contrary to him it shows he
[1:35:40] never received Christ.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:35:44] Do you love him this morning?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless. Hallelujah.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the living God.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Praise Jesus. So that is why the Bible
[1:35:57] says watch this. John was
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; no
[1:36:05] tears. He wasn't happy. He wasn't
[1:36:07] hallelujah. Glory glory. No,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; they have words in that book.
[1:36:14] Hallelujah. His name is in that book.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Your name is the word.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are part of that book.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; So he want that book to be released so
[1:36:24] that he can go back on the earth.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Caught up in that dimension.
[1:36:29] But come back on the earth until that
[1:36:31] book is unfolding.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; So John is correctly weeping.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; He is crying.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; A man filled with the Holy Ghost. He is
[1:36:39] weeping because no man was found to take
[1:36:42] the book.
[1:36:43] Notice the scripture read.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; So therefore your worship will express
[1:36:54] to me express to us whether you have any
[1:36:58] revelation. So when you see somebody
[1:37:00] quiet, they can't worship. They're
[1:37:02] looking, they're looking, they're
[1:37:03] looking, they know something is wrong.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; You have to behave the same way
[1:37:14] because there is only one Lord. There's
[1:37:16] only one spirit. There's only one
[1:37:19] baptism and there's only one behavior.
[1:37:22] When you're living under the inspiration
[1:37:25] of the Holy Spirit, there is only one
[1:37:29] Just by the room, just by the upper
[1:37:32] room.
[1:37:42] This is a very important service. This
[1:37:45] will se
[1:37:49] the upper room and if you can't worship
[1:37:51] you have no revelation because God is
[1:37:54] not coming out
[1:37:56] your head on top of your memory and your
[1:37:59] intellect. God is coming.
[1:38:02] Praise God. That's why
[1:38:04] they got to understand
[1:38:07] the Lord is good
[1:38:09] and he is going to be worshiped.
[1:38:12] Everything worship the elders worship
[1:38:15] the angels worship the four worship. Oh,
[1:38:19] and they were in the upper room and they
[1:38:21] were praising God
[1:38:24] before the dynamics fell.
[1:38:28] of the spirit. But before you have to
[1:38:31] break into revelation
[1:38:54] with your weight Am
[1:39:00] I worship?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That has nothing to do with
[1:39:09] worship. I have nothing to eat between
[1:39:11] that worship.
[1:39:14] That has nothing to do with worship.
[1:39:17] Come on now.
[1:39:20] That has nothing to do.
[1:39:24] Jesus said it's not
[1:39:30] worshiping
[1:39:36] this one. You cannot stop a believer.
[1:39:43] [cheering]
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; You know what this is? This is the
[1:40:11] jubilee
[1:40:12] of the seventh seal.
[1:40:15] Oh, glory to God.
[1:40:20] We are breaking into the jubilee.
[1:40:22] What said the church,
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; not moaning,
[1:40:32] not my God, not
[1:40:35] believe.
[1:40:52] My God, it look like somebody see their
[1:40:54] name. It look like some brother see his
[1:40:56] name. It look like some sisters see
[1:40:59] their name.
[1:41:09] You may be seated. Praise God. Praise
[1:41:11] God.
[1:41:55] Brother said, "No minist bring a
[1:41:58] revival.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I love what God did.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; So then when people run after some man
[1:42:03] who man they love they chose and whatn
[1:42:05] not they figure he's the man or whatever
[1:42:08] that's the business. He said the revival
[1:42:11] has to come from the people.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; So somehow this vision of God
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; has to be transferred to you the people.
[1:42:20] Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Now, the reason that God,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; the church fell in the beginning,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; the reason it fell is because the people
[1:42:30] take the spirit
[1:42:32] and put it on a man.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; And God say, "I hate it."
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I hate it.
[1:42:43] God said that
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; the prophet said God is the God of the
[1:42:49] audience.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; You shall be my people
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; and I shall be your God.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; He's a jealous God.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; So when man play God is trouble.
[1:43:11] Have no other gods before me.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord thy God.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have no other gods before
[1:43:19] me.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, I feel the presence of God
[1:43:22] here this morning. That pillar of fire
[1:43:24] is hanging here this morning.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; When that pillar of fire begin to move,
[1:43:32] this church going to change. Trinidad
[1:43:35] going to change the world going to
[1:43:37] change. The message going to change.
[1:43:39] When that same pill of fire that came
[1:43:41] out be to move among the people. Watch
[1:43:45] what God going to do.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Nobody want to join that church. Bible
[1:43:51] said the Lord added to the church such
[1:43:53] as would be saved. No man just tried to
[1:43:55] join to them.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God wanted that church clean. God
[1:43:59] wanted that church pure. God wanted that
[1:44:02] church.
[1:44:07] But the devil want to destroy it.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Big shots find and complain too much of
[1:44:17] noise. Quiet quiet don't make much of
[1:44:19] noise.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; You know who come to you today.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You don't want to offend the duck.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; And then they start to give special
[1:44:33] seats
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; to special people
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; and then rebuke and change. How come you
[1:44:38] just selecting and giving special seats
[1:44:40] because of who the person is? God has no
[1:44:42] respect of persons
[1:44:45] to backslide because in God's sight we
[1:44:47] are sons and daughters.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; I'm a son behind here and you are son
[1:44:51] there.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; We are the same. We are sons and
[1:44:54] daughters. I'm in a position to speak
[1:44:56] the word because of what God called me
[1:44:57] to do. You are not. I am in this
[1:45:00] position. You are here to worship. You
[1:45:02] say amen. Because if your name is here
[1:45:05] every word you say
[1:45:14] God don't want you
[1:45:17] keep that for yourself. God want to say
[1:45:19] amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Open your
[1:45:23] mouth and give the Lord some praises
[1:45:25] right now.
[1:45:39] Hallelujah.
[1:45:41] Hallelujah.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel your faith being
[1:45:45] anointed.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; A seven of faith.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Being anointed to push for dynamics, to
[1:45:53] push for charity, to push for the Holy
[1:45:55] Ghost. You may be seated.
[1:45:59] Canaan
[1:46:01] does not represent the age of the
[1:46:03] millennium.
[1:46:04] It represents the age of the overcomer.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; The dispensation of overcoming because
[1:46:11] in Canaan they kill and burn and took
[1:46:12] cities.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; So this cross over Jordan and everything
[1:46:16] is wonderful. No sorry
[1:46:20] it's not like that. They cross Jordan
[1:46:24] and you have to fight.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Shout out fight. What you have to do?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Fight everyday fight.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Not a Sunday fight.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; The devil wait until your tomorrow. He
[1:46:39] taking holidays because he recognizes
[1:46:42] days is numbered.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's not trying to stop you
[1:46:46] from coming to perfection. Let your
[1:46:49] family do this, your children do this,
[1:46:51] your grandchildren do that, your husband
[1:46:53] do this, your wife do that to try to
[1:46:56] disturb your But you still have to
[1:46:58] fight.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Don't let your wife fool you. Don't let
[1:47:05] your husband fool you. Don't let you
[1:47:07] fool you. Stay focused and fight.
[1:47:12] Do I hear some Amen.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; David knew he was anointed king.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; You talk about fighting.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; David fight.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; David say, "Oh, Saul, you're leaving
[1:47:34] now. When you're moving out your
[1:47:36] furniture
[1:47:37] for me to move in,
[1:47:40] move in. Saul is after him.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; David want to play mad and all spitting
[1:47:49] and fing all kind of play mad to escape.
[1:47:53] David doing everything to escape. You
[1:47:55] have to fight,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; run, talk, disguise himself.
[1:48:02] Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Tell you
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; because the throne is yours. Fight
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; because him that overcome it will sit
[1:48:16] with me in my throne as I overcome. I
[1:48:19] said my father in this fight because it
[1:48:21] belong to the overcomer.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, we give our shout in the house.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; This land belong to you. Believe that. I
[1:48:30] want you to believe that
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; justification Moses in Egypt
[1:48:42] sanctification through the pillar of
[1:48:44] fire atonement of the sacrificial lamb
[1:48:46] in the wilderness. Then entering into
[1:48:48] the land that has been promised.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; So this message has been a journey,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; a destination.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; The promise is not the wilderness. We on
[1:48:58] a journey to a promise
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; that God has made.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; So don't give up now.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Why you giving up now?
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Raise the standard.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Judah,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; raise a stand.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:27] So watch
[1:49:29] now. What is the land promised to the
[1:49:34] New Testament believer? The promise is
[1:49:36] the Holy Spirit.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; That is the promise.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; It shall come to pass 28, I'll pour out
[1:49:45] my spirit. Question and answers. Now
[1:49:47] watch. Today the church has come to
[1:49:50] justification through Luther through
[1:49:51] sanification through the Methodist. And
[1:49:53] now to the time of the promise. The
[1:49:55] promise is the baptism of the spirit
[1:49:58] which is promised all through the old
[1:50:00] testament and the new. The promise
[1:50:03] behold I send the promise of my father
[1:50:05] upon you.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; That is the promise.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; You can't pray. You can't get victory.
[1:50:12] You can't go and say a prayer. The
[1:50:13] promise is the Holy Ghost. When the Holy
[1:50:15] Ghost come upon you, you will see your
[1:50:16] prayer change, victory change, your
[1:50:18] attitude change. That is the promise.
[1:50:21] It's a new heart. I'll give you a new
[1:50:23] spirit. I'll give you. But that new
[1:50:24] heart, a new spirit is not the real
[1:50:26] thing yet. He promised the Holy Spirit
[1:50:28] to put in the center of that new heart a
[1:50:30] new spirit. That's the promise.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; I I'll write my laws in their heart.
[1:50:35] That's the promise. The word to become
[1:50:37] spirit in your life. That's the promise.
[1:50:39] The word to be quickened in your life.
[1:50:41] That's the promise.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Again, I'll fight for that one. Again, I
[1:50:46] fight with that one. I fight for this
[1:50:47] one. Fight with everybody. They going to
[1:50:49] fight with you yet.
[1:50:52] everybody else but you
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; caugh up in your own human spirit. When
[1:50:57] you get the Holy Ghost, all them fights
[1:50:59] done
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; because you recognize you are your
[1:51:01] biggest enemy.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; And you will stop making excuses and
[1:51:05] you'll get the devil running
[1:51:07] the right thing. You can't run that
[1:51:09] devil.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; So what? The promised land. There we go.
[1:51:15] The promised land. Are you ready?
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Is to live in this land of Holy Spirit.
[1:51:22] That's your promise.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Waking up in it, you're sleeping in it.
[1:51:26] You're walking in it.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; As many as are led by the spirit, they
[1:51:28] are the sons of God. This is your
[1:51:30] promise. I want you to see as your
[1:51:32] promise, not the preacher promise. Your
[1:51:34] promise. You're frustrated. No, that's
[1:51:36] not your promise. You're depressed.
[1:51:38] That's not your promise. Shake that off
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; and accept that your promise is to
[1:51:43] really live in the land of the Holy
[1:51:44] Spirit.
[1:51:49] That's God's promise for the church is
[1:51:51] to live in the power of the spirit. It's
[1:51:53] another world. It's another land. You
[1:51:56] have to come out of the condition you
[1:51:57] have been in to come and live in this
[1:51:59] promised land.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; You have to come out the condition
[1:52:01] you're in. Change your attitude. Change
[1:52:03] your thinking. Change your thoughts. You
[1:52:05] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:52:08] is come upon you.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus. Now, here's where I
[1:52:14] get to. I want to get to but this is
[1:52:15] where his vision from. As Daniel heard
[1:52:17] the seven thunders and forbidden and
[1:52:20] John heard the voices and this book was
[1:52:23] sealed and the back of book was sealed
[1:52:25] with seven seals. But in the days of
[1:52:26] these seals to be open the mystery of
[1:52:29] God would be finished. In other words,
[1:52:31] God would be known to his church not in
[1:52:35] three people but as one person.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God will be revealed. And
[1:52:39] when that was completely revealed, then
[1:52:44] the seven mysteries, which is the seven
[1:52:47] talking about will be open to the
[1:52:48] church.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Because in there, the church would be
[1:52:53] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:52:57] Spirit, him moving in and out, showing
[1:53:00] him signs of being alive among us.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; That's a promise
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; to be living under the inspiration of
[1:53:07] the Holy Spirit. And moving in and out.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; He could do a miracle today, a healing
[1:53:12] today, a deliverance today. He move in,
[1:53:15] he move out. He resto backs today.
[1:53:17] Somebody get to deliverance today. He
[1:53:19] move in, he move out. Him moving in, but
[1:53:22] you're living under the inspiration.
[1:53:24] That's where we are right now. Living
[1:53:25] under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:53:28] Spirit, creating an atmosphere. God
[1:53:30] cannot come down and dry. That's why
[1:53:33] they were in the upper room creating an
[1:53:35] atmosphere praising and blessing God
[1:53:37] continually. Yes, you have challenges.
[1:53:40] Don't let that stop your praises. Oh,
[1:53:42] glory to God. You have problems. Don't
[1:53:44] let that stop your praises. When you
[1:53:47] come here, you come here to worship.
[1:53:49] That's what the word God means. It means
[1:53:51] object of worship. You come here to
[1:53:54] look. You come here to worship. You're
[1:53:56] coming to be a participator. Praise God.
[1:53:58] Hallelujah. I don't care if you're a
[1:54:00] deacon inside of here, a usher inside of
[1:54:02] here, you still have to worship.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Worship with your hand or
[1:54:06] eye open. Praise God. Lift your hands.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Walk like some military
[1:54:12] deacon that you can't worship. It's God
[1:54:14] you're serving.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; If you want to win the military, go and
[1:54:16] join the army. But inside your worship,
[1:54:19] you are worshiper first. Before you
[1:54:21] deacon, you're worshiper first. Before
[1:54:23] your elder worship first before usher,
[1:54:26] you're worship first.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Jesus said, "Woman will
[1:54:34] all come when the true worshippers will
[1:54:36] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:54:39] truth. For the father seek such to
[1:54:42] worship him."
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout.
[1:54:58] You may be seated
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; from Revelation book of symbols.
[1:55:03] Remember Daniel was told by the angel
[1:55:05] Daniel heard seven thunders. They
[1:55:06] uttered their voices. He grabbed his pen
[1:55:07] to write. He said, "Don't write it.
[1:55:09] Don't write it." John told the same
[1:55:10] thing. It has already been written
[1:55:12] outside of the Bible. Had seven seals on
[1:55:14] the back of the book. No man could open
[1:55:16] those seals. That was them voices.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; So the seals on the back of the book was
[1:55:21] voices.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; So you couldn't see the voices, but the
[1:55:24] voices were what revealed what's inside
[1:55:25] the book.
[1:55:27] hide the voice inside of there. So take
[1:55:29] seven seals on the back and put it under
[1:55:30] the seven seal on the inside to make
[1:55:32] sure there seven seals not 14 seals.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; If he didn't do that would be 14 seals.
[1:55:40] Seven on the back, seven on the inside.
[1:55:42] But the voices on the back, he called it
[1:55:44] voices.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; The books were sealed with voices.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Seven voices.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Could have gone further. No man knew
[1:55:51] what it was. But the Bible said and told
[1:55:54] and that the
[1:55:56] These seven voices would be known by the
[1:56:00] real true church.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; So if that is so then the real true
[1:56:06] church must have king worship.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; If it's revealed to you
[1:56:15] the worship.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:20] So we could see who sees their name on
[1:56:22] the book.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. see your name in the
[1:56:25] book. You'll be shouting. You'll be
[1:56:27] praising God. You'll be worshiping.
[1:56:29] Praise be to Jesus.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seven voices. Seven voices
[1:56:34] through seven ages. Isn't that right?
[1:56:36] Praise God. And God gathered up into the
[1:56:39] son of man which is William. He was a
[1:56:41] son of man revealing the son of man.
[1:56:43] Isn't that right? And God through the
[1:56:45] mouth of the prophet spoke back out.
[1:56:46] Seven thunders out. And the seven voices
[1:56:50] that was thundering through seven ages
[1:56:52] is now spoken back out. But when you
[1:56:54] receive the word, you receive seven
[1:56:56] voices. And God going to change that one
[1:56:58] voice into seven voices. No wonder the
[1:57:01] devil going to be shut up. No wonder
[1:57:03] going be shaken in Trinidad. And where
[1:57:05] there was voices, that's the thunder
[1:57:07] that shakes the devil. The devil don't
[1:57:09] want them seven living voices. But we're
[1:57:11] going to have it because God promised
[1:57:13] it. This is a promise of God. I'm
[1:57:15] claiming it this night. I'm claiming it
[1:57:17] today. Praise be to Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Come on. It's not your
[1:57:24] life. It's his life to come into you.
[1:57:28] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; You know you're miserable.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; But God know you're miserable too. But
[1:57:46] he still call you. Still put your name
[1:57:48] on the book. You know you struggle all
[1:57:50] by yourself. But God know you trouble
[1:57:52] too. But he still call you because he
[1:57:54] know you're going to be changed by not
[1:57:56] by might not by power but by my spirit.
[1:58:01] Oh glory of God.
[1:58:10] Praise God.
[1:58:14] Peter was always a
[1:58:16] smoking drinking fisherman. Jesus said
[1:58:20] come make you fishes of men andrew
[1:58:23] comeing
[1:58:26] the cursing what they doing on the book
[1:58:29] see the inside their soul see the germ
[1:58:32] in them the word in them the potential
[1:58:35] in them
[1:58:44] be seated
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; notice Jesus didn't Tell Peter, Peter,
[1:58:49] just gather who you like. Tell them come
[1:58:52] too.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; It was not a second coming. You know, it
[1:58:55] was just come come line up these
[1:58:58] brothers and say greet in Jesus name. I
[1:59:00] don't like him. He was in school playing
[1:59:02] trouble.
[1:59:04] But Jesus called all of them. The one
[1:59:05] you don't like in school. The one you
[1:59:07] don't like in your job, he called them
[1:59:08] too. He called them. One you don't like
[1:59:09] next to you sitting next to you or
[1:59:10] behind you. God called them too. So
[1:59:12] behave yourself
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; and do like I love them too because God
[1:59:19] love you. God love
[1:59:25] nobody complain about their eye. I don't
[1:59:26] like my right eye but keep your left eye
[1:59:31] from your left eye looking bigger than
[1:59:32] my right eye. You want you want to take
[1:59:34] it off.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; You want your right eye there. You want
[1:59:38] your left head there. You want your
[1:59:39] tongue. You want your face. You want
[1:59:41] your whole body as you are.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing with the kingdom
[1:59:45] of God. I don't know what
[1:59:48] But I can't say I don't need you.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Well, if you're big enough, you can say
[1:59:55] you don't need me.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; You're on your own.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Are you in that battle?
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to Jesus. Hallelujah. So,
[2:00:08] in Luke 24, he unlocked their
[2:00:11] understanding. He opened their
[2:00:13] understanding to the scriptures. Isn't
[2:00:15] that right? They knew he was God. So
[2:00:18] that's why they worshiped. Notice when
[2:00:20] he was taken up, they worship him.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; They knew that was God. Elohim and
[2:00:24] Christ. Isn't that right? Christ. Isn't
[2:00:27] that right? Praise be to Jesus. So
[2:00:30] before God sent out the baptism of the
[2:00:33] Holy Ghost in earnest, there got to be a
[2:00:36] sanctified bunch of people that
[2:00:38] worshiping the Lord.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; You know what I said? Not just worship,
[2:00:42] but a sanctified bunch.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; A clean up bunch. A bunch
[2:00:46] for God. Hallelujah. Worship him.
[2:00:50] Creating an atmosphere for the power of
[2:00:52] God to fall.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; God. So God bought three stages. Water,
[2:01:00] blood, and snow spirit. Praise God.
[2:01:04] Seven seat,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; blood, seven thunders that the message
[2:01:08] will have rejected. But now the seven of
[2:01:11] faith give us the faith to call for the
[2:01:14] spirit that there'll be a genuine birth
[2:01:17] baptism of love even charity itself that
[2:01:20] we can have tremendous victory in the
[2:01:23] love divine. God didn't promise just
[2:01:25] victory you know but tremendous victory.
[2:01:28] My God the people that know their God
[2:01:30] shall be strong and do great exploits.
[2:01:34] Some got to begin exploits of faith when
[2:01:37] the sick is being healed. is seeing.
[2:01:40] Death is hearing. Oh, glory to God. By
[2:01:42] the power of the living God. Oh, it's
[2:01:45] promise. I'm looking for it. I'm on
[2:01:47] expectation for it. I shall not die but
[2:01:50] live to declare the works of the Lord.
[2:01:53] The Lord have chosen me, but he have not
[2:01:56] given me over unto death. Oh, open to me
[2:01:58] the gates of righteousness.
[2:02:00] And I shall praise the Lord. Come on,
[2:02:03] you better praise him. That's what David
[2:02:06] said. If you open the gates, I'm going
[2:02:08] to praise him.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:02:14] Hallelujah.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:02:19] Hallelujah.
[2:02:20] Glory to God.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; So, you couldn't go in the upper room
[2:02:23] with an empty head, not knowing
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; because after a while the upper room,
[2:02:28] you know,
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; and it's true.

[2:02:40] You walk out the room because you're not
[2:02:42] sure
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; why you're there. But every one of those
[2:02:44] brothers up there,
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; 120 of them, they knew exactly what they
[2:02:49] were about to receive.

[2:03:05] keeping and keep on worshiping with one
[2:03:08] hand and worship with the next hand.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Keep on giving God praises
[2:03:12] creating an atmosphere. They have to
[2:03:14] wait until God doesn't tell him what
[2:03:17] day. You just say wait until
[2:03:20] until until if you don't get to the
[2:03:23] service until you come back Thursday
[2:03:25] until next Sunday until convention

[2:04:13] thing. Yeah. These are the words.

[2:04:17] house.
[2:04:18] These are the words. You hear it before,
[2:04:21] you're going to hear it again. We're
[2:04:23] going to wait till the power come. We're
[2:04:25] going to stay here dynamics for going to
[2:04:29] step on the devil. We're going to step
[2:04:31] on his neck. We're going to lay hands on
[2:04:33] the sick. We going to cast out devils.
[2:04:35] We know who Satan is, but we know who
[2:04:38] God is. And we know who we are. We are
[2:04:41] to take the land.
[2:04:44] [cheering]
[2:04:55] You know what we're doing here right
[2:04:56] now? Declare a holy war. A holy war of
[2:05:01] occ. You have to dispossess the enemy.
[2:05:05] You running Philistines,
[2:05:07] Jebusites. You have to dispossess them.
[2:05:11] They're living on your land. You were
[2:05:13] born in sin, brother. Just in case you
[2:05:15] forgot.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Personal demons.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the religious spirits. I have
[2:05:28] reached the next class by itself.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; And this message loaded with it. Satan
[2:05:36] personally send them
[2:05:40] 200,000,000 devils
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; loosed against the bride.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Satan is the church.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; That's a big one. That's a That's a big
[2:05:50] one.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; The bride is the word. Satan is church.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; This church fighting
[2:05:56] we going down.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, forget about
[2:06:00] it. church member can stop you. No
[2:06:03] 10,000 fold
[2:06:06] over your dead bodies. Nobody can throw
[2:06:09] you off. Nobody can set you back.
[2:06:23] [cheering]
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; I am not disappointed. I'm appointed.
[2:06:28] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:06:43] You may be seated.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; I feel we cross the line.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you come to a spot where the
[2:06:53] devil can't throw you back. He can't
[2:06:55] throw you off. He got send you back. He
[2:06:56] can't tell you you're not a son of God.
[2:06:59] give up on that. Then you got to try a
[2:07:01] different tactic all together because
[2:07:03] your mind is clear who you are.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; You might be a weak son but you're still
[2:07:08] a son. Might be a struggling son but
[2:07:10] you're still a son. You might be a
[2:07:11] blessing son but you're still a son. He
[2:07:13] can't change that. The devil can't
[2:07:14] change that.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; So you have access to your father.
[2:07:19] That's why the angel here we go. There
[2:07:21] we go. This is big. When the angel can
[2:07:23] open
[2:07:25] the voices outl
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; you can't go if you don't know who you
[2:07:32] are
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; and what you're going for
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; you go to the angel watch I'm going back
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know what I here for because
[2:07:44] that book
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; is so important
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; that's the book that Adam had
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; that's the book that Adam lost that's
[2:07:50] the book what the to call all sons.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; God would only call by his word.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; So the word was in the book.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; The book was in Adam.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; When Adam lost the book, the book went
[2:08:02] back in the hands of the original owner
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ came back down.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; As the book, the book was there
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; open. Now the book is being placed in
[2:08:12] sons
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; to call the rest of sons.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Sons calling sons.
[2:08:19] So he said, "As my father sent me, so
[2:08:25] you the father that was sent him was in
[2:08:28] him."
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Do you see what God about to do to you?
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; He's about to tabernacle himself inside
[2:08:35] of you. You are about to become a house
[2:08:37] for God. You become about to become a
[2:08:39] temple for God. You become the church of
[2:08:42] God. you yourself
[2:08:51] be seated.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Christianity versus idolatry, brother.
[2:08:59] Now, idolatry is a strange thing.
[2:09:03] Down through the ages, we've had it ever
[2:09:04] since the beginning of time. The order
[2:09:08] for this idol worship is the man sets up
[2:09:10] the idol. Fixes the idol. Then he goes
[2:09:13] in and prepares himself for this great
[2:09:15] worship. Now he believes this idol is
[2:09:18] made in the image of some god that he
[2:09:20] doesn't never see. He's without form. So
[2:09:23] he believes he's in an image of this
[2:09:25] idol that he makes to this god. Now
[2:09:28] don't let that leave you. So here is
[2:09:31] bringing a point. He said the image is
[2:09:34] in the image of the God that he believes
[2:09:37] that is then he goes before the idol
[2:09:40] prostrates himself and believes that the
[2:09:42] God that's unseen person comes down into
[2:09:45] this idol and he believes that he talks
[2:09:48] to God through this idol that God brings
[2:09:50] himself into the idol and answers him
[2:09:52] back.
[2:09:54] Many of you teachers here that took the
[2:09:55] mythology even though it's god they had
[2:09:57] battles with one another.
[2:09:59] Now in other words the god hypnotizes
[2:10:02] himself from this supernatural standing
[2:10:04] into this idol speaks back to the
[2:10:06] worshiper through the idol and the
[2:10:08] worshipper in some kind of built up
[2:10:09] emotional sense believes that the idol
[2:10:12] speaks to him to his heart and he's
[2:10:15] forgiven of his sins whatever more which
[2:10:17] surely shows is the devil is the devil
[2:10:19] that does it. Listen to this now they
[2:10:22] don't havely
[2:10:24] these worship of idols. Some of them
[2:10:26] does, but there's real true worshippers
[2:10:29] of those things. For instance, listen, I
[2:10:32] could tell you stories of how those
[2:10:34] devils in those idols perform all kind
[2:10:37] of things,
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; make blood come out of things
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; and everything else. They would say the
[2:10:43] stone weeping, Virgin Mary weeping and
[2:10:45] demons, devils that they worshiping,
[2:10:48] making these things happen. Watch, they
[2:10:51] are devils.
[2:10:53] Now, if you don't believe there's a real
[2:10:56] devil, then you don't believe there's a
[2:10:58] God. Sure, you got to believe. There's a
[2:11:01] real devil and he's a person, not a
[2:11:03] thought,
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; not a thought.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; He is a person. Now, there's a teaching
[2:11:08] goes on that the devil is just an evil
[2:11:10] thought you get. No, it isn't. The devil
[2:11:12] is a person.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; The same people believe that the Holy
[2:11:14] Ghost is a good thought you get, but
[2:11:16] don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a
[2:11:19] person.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; It is the of Christ in spirit form.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; All them people who say they the Holy
[2:11:26] Ghost, they're off.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; That is just that is just contrary
[2:11:30] teachings.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the person of Christ
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; in spirit form.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Now let's go ahead further now. Now
[2:11:38] these idols are frustrating for the idol
[2:11:41] believe that the God they are worshiping
[2:11:44] is represented in this idol. Now you now
[2:11:47] you got that the worshiper is not a
[2:11:49] hypocrite.
[2:11:53] He is actually
[2:11:55] getting a hold of something that is in
[2:11:58] that idol
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; because it come back on him. He does
[2:12:04] something and gets it from that idol
[2:12:06] which is a myth god not a real one.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; So they will have testimonies of what an
[2:12:11] idol does to them and what the
[2:12:13] worshiping does to them and what the
[2:12:14] church does for them. They have answers,
[2:12:16] they have witness, they have
[2:12:18] confirmation, they have all of that. But
[2:12:24] And many times here we go. Are you
[2:12:26] ready?
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; The devil get into those things and the
[2:12:30] devil get into meetings sometime and
[2:12:34] impersonates himself as God. I have seen
[2:12:37] this in my ministry.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; This is very deep.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; This is not skim milk. He says stay with
[2:12:47] the teaching that's been taught here.
[2:12:49] Stay with this word. Don't you leave it.
[2:12:51] You stay right with the word. No matter
[2:12:53] what comes, what goes. Stay with the
[2:12:55] word. People say come to the altar with
[2:12:57] blind teachers, blind teachers say just
[2:13:00] open up. Forget everything. Make your
[2:13:02] mind blank. You'll become an Elijah.
[2:13:03] You'll become this that the other. What
[2:13:04] a lie.
[2:13:06] That's open up your soul to all kind of
[2:13:08] devil spirits to get in. Don't do that.
[2:13:10] You must remember there's a devil and he
[2:13:13] impersonate Christ to the letter almost.
[2:13:16] So just because we can be emotional
[2:13:18] don't mean we are saved.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Because we go to church don't mean we
[2:13:22] are saved.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's a big one.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; That's a big one. Going to church
[2:13:27] doesn't mean people say I see people in
[2:13:29] this message Christians soal Christians
[2:13:32] behite.
[2:13:47] until they fall in the pride and the
[2:13:49] arrogance while the selfrighteousness.
[2:13:52] Okay, let's go on now. Because we go to
[2:13:54] church don't mean we are saved. Don't
[2:13:56] believe those entitled spirits. A real
[2:13:59] spirit of God, a real word of God is the
[2:14:03] truth of God
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; which is the seed of God
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; will produce God in your life. You'll be
[2:14:10] godly, saintly, holy. Amen.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Among a lot of people we find where
[2:14:17] emotions and so forth, they become
[2:14:19] tacklers, backbiting, all kind of
[2:14:22] ungodly things. Brother, that is
[2:14:24] sulfuric acid in the church. It is demon
[2:14:26] powers.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Spirit of men and women who get among
[2:14:30] one another and try to push off and say,
[2:14:32] "This one is not right. This one is not
[2:14:34] right. That is not right." And if you
[2:14:37] chase it down, nine times out of 10,
[2:14:39] it's the very person making that That's
[2:14:42] not right.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; God hates discord among brethren.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Be reverent, be holy, love God, stand by
[2:14:56] him, and as long as you know your life
[2:14:58] is deep enough with the Bible, with the
[2:15:00] purity of heart, purity of thought, love
[2:15:02] towards your brother, trying to best
[2:15:04] build the kingdom of God, doing those
[2:15:06] things, dressing right, living right,
[2:15:07] talking right, going to the right
[2:15:08] places, then you can have all the
[2:15:10] emotions you want and Nobody will
[2:15:12] believe it.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Enticiting spirits going forth. Demons
[2:15:16] under disguises. Look, we the last days.
[2:15:19] It's the end time. False spirits
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; come in.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; And begin to tell people this and the
[2:15:26] other. We are broke up into 900
[2:15:30] different denominations. Everyone with
[2:15:31] different view. We say they say we
[2:15:34] believe this. Period. That's what we
[2:15:36] believe. They can't let the Holy Spirit
[2:15:42] They can't have the right of way. God
[2:15:44] got a bunch of people that can shout,
[2:15:46] then everybody had to shout.
[2:15:48] They got some to speak in tong, then
[2:15:50] everybody had to speak in tong. They got
[2:15:52] all like this till it become what?
[2:15:55] Absolutely. Listen, contaminated with
[2:15:58] enticing spirits.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Enticenses people to do these emotions
[2:16:05] when there is no god in it at all.
[2:16:08] Then they go out and live any kind of
[2:16:09] life that desire to live and call it
[2:16:11] Christian.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; So I say this because to correctly
[2:16:18] worship God, you have to get rid of the
[2:16:21] religious spirits
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; and the enticing spirits. It's not
[2:16:24] worship God a bunch of noise and
[2:16:26] hallelujah. Glory raise your hands. You
[2:16:27] have to be able to follow through with
[2:16:29] the word
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; to worship God in spirit and in truth.
[2:16:37] We give the Lord some praises people.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; So it's not just the noise. It's not
[2:16:44] just the shout. It's not just the
[2:16:46] hallelujah. It's breaking free from all
[2:16:48] the religious demons. Praise God. What
[2:16:51] you think and your dream and this and oh
[2:16:54] I have stories
[2:17:00] from now over 20 years. We just we speak
[2:17:04] from my Lord. We know that by heart.
[2:17:10] So Ephesus here like Joshua crossing
[2:17:13] over Ephraim here, Manassa here, God
[2:17:19] here, Benjamin here. Has the hour come
[2:17:23] for that?
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; As I told him in Paris, seven thunders,
[2:17:27] we have seen the Lord. We fight together
[2:17:29] and what that is finished.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; There's no group testimony.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; We have to get our portion. Amen.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; So all the group
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; they really in trouble
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; because it working
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; say give me my
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; you can't ask for what is not yours.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; So you have to have a revelation of what
[2:17:51] is yours.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; So when it's revealed to you and you
[2:17:53] know what's yours you know who you're
[2:17:55] challenging now
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; you know what you're asking for
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; because it is now yours. Give me
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; my mountain because it revealed to you.
[2:18:03] Give the Lord a shout.
[2:18:10] How each one of those Hebrew mother has
[2:18:12] given birth in those children. She spoke
[2:18:13] the very place in the labor pains where
[2:18:15] they are to be positioned in the
[2:18:16] promised land.
[2:18:19] So what she was in labor pain she said
[2:18:21] Ephraim when she was in labor. Joshua
[2:18:23] not knowing this but by inspiration led
[2:18:26] of the Holy Spirit after being promised
[2:18:29] land after being in the promised land
[2:18:31] give each man the promise exactly what
[2:18:33] the Holy Spirit brought to the birth
[2:18:36] back there
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; how God set in the church the favorite
[2:18:38] quote
[2:18:40] through their labor pains how they get
[2:18:42] tremendous sometimes that's why you got
[2:18:43] to fight
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; is labor pains you want to bring forth
[2:18:47] something don't don't expect a wall it's
[2:18:50] like a line thing and it just floating
[2:18:51] through you have to press your way.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; I want that to stick inside of you. We
[2:18:56] are in the book of Joshua.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; We are in the book of Ephesians. We are
[2:19:00] in the promised land. But you have to
[2:19:02] fight to possess what you know is your
[2:19:04] own.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; You have to fight for it.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's not going to come easy. He didn't
[2:19:08] set it up for it to come easy. He set up
[2:19:10] a way that you have to fight for it.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; It is set up that way.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; It is yours. But every place you put
[2:19:15] your foot.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Stop using binoculars.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Stop seeing a fire off, you have to put
[2:19:20] your foot in it. I challenge you today.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Walk on your land.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; I think I want a better amen than that.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Take healing. Take
[2:19:32] deliverance. Take breakthrough. Take a
[2:19:35] fresh anointing. Walk on your land.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take victory. Glory to God.
[2:19:42] You get defeated yesterday. Don't bother
[2:19:44] with that defeat yesterday. Victory is
[2:19:45] tomorrow.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Victory is right now. Glory to God.
[2:19:49] forgetting things that have passed.
[2:19:50] Don't look in the rearview mirror. See
[2:19:52] where you're going. Don't look back from
[2:19:54] where you come from. Come on, sing with
[2:19:56] somebody. Give the Lord a shout.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; See where you want to go.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; When the church, here we go,
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; is
[2:20:16] my under the persecution. outside world
[2:20:19] believing in the Lord Jesus that the
[2:20:21] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[2:20:22] real as it was as Pentecost. So the only
[2:20:26] spirit that will try to make the Holy
[2:20:28] Ghost not as real is Satan.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; If you could avoid and duck the Holy
[2:20:34] Ghost, that is the devil.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; What you have to believe is that the
[2:20:38] Holy Ghost is just as real.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Just as they have it, the same one Peter
[2:20:42] had, that's the one you want.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; The same one Mary got, that's the one
[2:20:46] you want.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; You don't want a new
[2:20:49] You want the same Holy Ghost.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; But didn't come to turn back to a new
[2:20:52] thing. He came to turn us back to the
[2:20:54] faith of the fathers
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; because they had the real thing.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; And we say local real McCoy.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; They had the real thing.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; So we have to go and pick up what they
[2:21:03] had there. Then we could go forward.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; We can't go forward as as long as we
[2:21:08] pick up what they had because they had
[2:21:09] the faith.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So we have to go and
[2:21:12] pick up the faith to come and connect
[2:21:14] with dynamics that we could go down to
[2:21:16] the resurrection. You break down to the
[2:21:18] resurrection say that can stop you no
[2:21:19] more
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; because you're breaking the time
[2:21:22] barrier. Not even death can stop you.
[2:21:24] Say not even death can stop this. You're
[2:21:27] pushing death aside. You're pushing that
[2:21:29] aside because you have resurrection
[2:21:31] power. You have rapturing faith inside
[2:21:33] of you. You have translation faith
[2:21:35] inside of you. Oh, glory to God. This
[2:21:38] will put on immortality. This corruption
[2:21:40] will put on incorruption. We shall be
[2:21:43] changed.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe that?
[2:21:47] You have to have power. You know,
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; you must have power. It must have divine
[2:21:51] healing. But how could we have faith for
[2:21:53] the rapture and we don't have faith for
[2:21:54] the sick to be healed?
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; That mean kidneys could be restored.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; May I shake your face a little bit?
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Say missing limbs will be restored.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Missing limbs.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Could you mind missing a foot and God
[2:22:17] resto
[2:22:22] the hand grow back up.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Have you heard about a testimony with a
[2:22:28] woman with no eyes?
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; And brother she asked you want her eyes
[2:22:34] just empty sockets
[2:22:37] and when spoke and prayed for her light
[2:22:40] come to and for the eyes and the middle
[2:22:43] of that formation he say I forget to ask
[2:22:44] you what color you want.
[2:22:47] She say, "I hear blue is a nice color."
[2:22:48] You said, "Well, blue, blue will change
[2:22:49] to blue."
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we talking about.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; The God that open the Red Sea, the God
[2:23:01] that could change, praise God, a whole a
[2:23:05] lady.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve this morning.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; A drunk into a son of God.
[2:23:14] Give the Lord a shout.
[2:23:17] [cheering]
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood of Jesus.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood of Jesus.
[2:23:25] The blood of Jesus. Nothing but the
[2:23:28] blood of Jesus.
[2:23:31] [cheering]
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, they grown and cry.
[2:23:40] When they are born, when they are born
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; and positionally born
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God, then the Holy
[2:23:48] Ghost are set in the church. Some
[2:23:50] apostles, some are prophets. He said
[2:23:52] when that's going to happen.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; He said when they are born then
[2:24:03] sure potentially. But he said when they
[2:24:05] are born and positionally born then God
[2:24:10] into the church, pastors and prophets
[2:24:12] and evangelists and so forth. Then he
[2:24:14] have speaking in tong, interpreting
[2:24:16] tong, wisdom, healing, miracles and so
[2:24:18] forth.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Here we go. Let's continue. The church
[2:24:21] is always trying to take somebody else's
[2:24:23] corner. But don't do that.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; You can never raise corn in corner if
[2:24:27] you are manners.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Remember they were not one people. It
[2:24:32] was 12 tribes.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; So don't tell the tribe what to do. You
[2:24:38] don't hear what I'm saying?
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. Lord, I shout.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:24:44] Praise God. Told years ago, minister, I
[2:24:46] said, I will never allow any man on
[2:24:48] earth to tell me what to preach.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Never.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Then trying to put me in a box
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; to believe the way they believe it. And
[2:24:57] I say, big fact, no.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; I would preach and believe what God
[2:25:01] revealed to me.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm trouble all by myself. I
[2:25:05] said this church down here is suffering
[2:25:06] in Trinidad.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; No man are coming to put the hand and
[2:25:10] stick the finger and tell us this and
[2:25:11] tell us that. I'm not tolerating that.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; This church had to become by the Holy
[2:25:15] Ghost.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; I was sick and tired. I had a struggle
[2:25:19] to come here. I don't ever talk much
[2:25:21] about that. My wife will know. But I
[2:25:23] made it
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; to preach what I'm preaching this
[2:25:25] morning.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; I believe this is very important. Praise
[2:25:32] God that you understand the vision. It's
[2:25:34] not you come and join the church and you
[2:25:36] are here and this church is it. Any
[2:25:38] church say any group that believe they
[2:25:40] are better than other groups you know by
[2:25:42] discernment that is wrong
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; inside of believers
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; and so are the other groups
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; but what I know is that there are
[2:25:51] members inside of here
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; and I'm preaching to them.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know who is who but I going to
[2:25:58] preach the word and see who to take it.
[2:26:02] Come on.
[2:26:06] Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[2:26:08] We preach the word and we have faith to
[2:26:12] take it.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; A bunch of people. 2 million of them.
[2:26:18] The word and mix it with faith.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Two million of them with with the
[2:26:26] prophet Moses. We believe prophet Moses.
[2:26:29] And two million of them.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; They know it yet.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; They're coming out but they're not
[2:26:35] going.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; Don't join them
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; because the devil anoint them with
[2:26:41] unbelief.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; That's why when they came to came when
[2:26:44] when they came to the border line there
[2:26:46] when God say 10 or 12 spies there 12
[2:26:49] tribes or 12 ministers and a report 10
[2:26:53] of them come back with a report a report
[2:26:56] they land good but we see giants.
[2:26:58] Somebody said the giants see you know
[2:27:00] but we see them.
[2:27:03] We never see men so big.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; They are real giants. Let me describe
[2:27:08] the height. Let me describe them to you.
[2:27:10] And by the time they finish Israel
[2:27:12] paralyzed with fear
[2:27:14] and just come back and have it so odd is
[2:27:18] the shortest man in the camp.
[2:27:21] said to stand on a box and Caleb come up
[2:27:24] now when he see
[2:27:26] once
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; shorty
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; on top his box we are more than able to
[2:27:32] take the land
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; God make a paradox put a short in a box
[2:27:37] put a shame all them with a big size and
[2:27:40] big height and all the big revelation
[2:27:42] and big churches but praise God a little
[2:27:45] like stand up and tell them like it is
[2:27:48] we are wellable we We are wellable. We
[2:27:51] are wellable. You are well able. You are
[2:27:54] wellable.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:28:01] Amen.
[2:28:02] You are well able to pray. You will
[2:28:05] press. You are able to receive the Holy
[2:28:08] Ghost. You are well able to be
[2:28:09] delivered.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you Jesus.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; So you can never raise corn in Ephraim's
[2:28:24] corner when you're manning. You've got
[2:28:27] to take your place in Christ. It get
[2:28:30] deep and rich. That's how God put one in
[2:28:32] the church to speak in tongues and
[2:28:34] another to do something else. And then
[2:28:36] when somebody speak in tong, we all want
[2:28:37] to do it
[2:28:41] and you want
[2:28:44] because you can't do it. You don't have
[2:28:46] the gift.
[2:28:48] That is why all them jealousy and all
[2:28:50] them foolish get blew out.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; One woman come to Jesus, you worship.
[2:28:55] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. She
[2:28:57] worship. Where's the request? She said
[2:29:01] have two sons walking with you.
[2:29:03] Could you put one in your left hand and
[2:29:04] one in your right hand?
[2:29:07] The other disciples of course get
[2:29:09] furious. They know the kind of mother.
[2:29:11] The mother boys or something. I don't
[2:29:14] know. The mother looking for a favor for
[2:29:16] Jesus to put one on the right and one
[2:29:17] left. She say not my position to handle
[2:29:19] who goes left the right. Have a cup a
[2:29:21] big cup. If they want to drink it, they
[2:29:23] could drink it.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants some recognition. They
[2:29:28] want some position. They want some kind
[2:29:30] of thing.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; But there's a price.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; There's a cross before the crown.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; There's a price. There's character which
[2:29:37] is a gift which is a victory.
[2:29:44] People don't know what you're going
[2:29:45] through.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. This church just dropped
[2:29:53] down here. This build up of blood,
[2:29:55] sweat, and tears
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; and prayers and labor.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; It's not magic.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; It just happen just like that.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; It's a process.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; That's what we talking about.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; You got to have you have you got it.
[2:30:08] That's not a building has to be formed.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; And therefore, all this word is not
[2:30:13] image has to be formed in you,
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; has to be built in you, has to be molded
[2:30:19] in you, has to be shaped in you.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; So said the land was divided up by
[2:30:28] inspiration. Praise God. I'm going to go
[2:30:31] on further as we head out this home
[2:30:33] stretch. Now, we are born of the spirit
[2:30:35] of God and receive the Holy Ghost and
[2:30:38] cry, "Aba, Father." We are children, but
[2:30:41] we can't get anywhere. We can't whip the
[2:30:47] Philistines.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because people trying to take one
[2:30:51] of the position.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Tell somebody do this, do this, do this,
[2:30:54] and do this. If don't want to stay, one
[2:30:57] of them go over here. We find over there
[2:30:59] say, "Oh my, the Lord give me a good
[2:31:01] corn field." And then somebody come,
[2:31:05] but the ground you have is for sheep.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; That land go
[2:31:14] So like
[2:31:17] corn
[2:31:24] waste your time waste then fight because
[2:31:28] his corn will prosper but his land is
[2:31:30] different.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; God put grass for you. Your pick up the
[2:31:34] grass like that and you just wearing
[2:31:36] sheep
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; and say where God blessing is a
[2:31:41] position.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; So why you want to be in a position
[2:31:48] and then in
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; the president
[2:31:56] he wanted the position. I wonder how he
[2:31:58] feeling tough
[2:32:01] fighting pushing.
[2:32:04] didn't know.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it nicely. He said when
[2:32:13] you're invited to dinner, take a lower
[2:32:15] seat.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Because higher seat when somebody more
[2:32:20] worthy than you
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; comes in, they have to tell you the
[2:32:22] other back.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; So you take the lower seat and then they
[2:32:27] could bring you up if you have to be
[2:32:28] positionally placed.
[2:32:35] Oh, this word have everything in it, you
[2:32:36] know.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't this sweet this morning?
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; It's just the word. The word is God. All
[2:32:42] right. So, now wait a minute. I'm
[2:32:43] supposed to raise oats and I'm going to
[2:32:45] get corn, too. You ain't got nothing to
[2:32:48] do with corn. Get oats. It's your part
[2:32:51] to raise. You ain't supposed to hurt
[2:32:53] sheep when you're supposed to hurt
[2:32:55] cattle.
[2:32:57] God wants to place the church, but every
[2:32:59] one of them wants to do the same thing.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; So when you understand that, you begin
[2:33:06] to feel comfortable in the castle of
[2:33:09] your skin in the calling that God has
[2:33:11] called you onto.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; And nobody give you a fight with your
[2:33:14] blessings.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't care what they get
[2:33:17] blessed with. That is not yours.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; You're looking for God to give you a
[2:33:20] revelation.
[2:33:24] This one have more education than me.
[2:33:26] This one have hard me. Forget that. Find
[2:33:29] your calling. Find your position.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; And in your position, you have faith. In
[2:33:35] your position, God have blessed you
[2:33:37] tremendously.
[2:33:44] So then
[2:33:46] nothing about it.
[2:33:48] But but but but but
[2:33:51] you know
[2:33:53] The church, here we go, real home
[2:33:55] church. The church is supposed to be
[2:33:57] predestinated unto adoption of children
[2:33:59] where God can take a man, Here we go,
[2:34:01] and adopt him in the family and give him
[2:34:03] something.
[2:34:05] Okay?
[2:34:07] You understand that?
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Adopt a man, give him something. What
[2:34:10] are we supposed to do? Try first. Try
[2:34:14] that and see if it is right.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; So, it can't be ask question.
[2:34:22] I got to believe it. Believe what it is.
[2:34:25] In this time here, I want to know what
[2:34:27] you have.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Don't hide it.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Bring it.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; We get to test it and try it.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Because here what B says the Bible said,
[2:34:38] try the spirits.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; Anybody coming to church, I could try
[2:34:42] the spirit.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's my right
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; to try people's spirits to see what's
[2:34:47] inside of them.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; That's the authority we have in the
[2:34:50] word. The authorities try the spirit
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; because many false spirit come out
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; religious spirit.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; So this is somebody who can be adopted.
[2:35:01] Now say don't take that just like that.
[2:35:03] Try it. See if it is right.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Watch this man claims a certain thing.
[2:35:10] Try it. See if it is right. If it is
[2:35:14] right move right with it
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; and then say Lord send us something
[2:35:18] else. Keep moving till every fellow
[2:35:22] takes his place. Then you're going to
[2:35:24] see the church of God begin to get in
[2:35:25] his place. Then is when the Philistines
[2:35:27] will go to back it up. The shorts will
[2:35:29] go off. Hair will go down. Facing will
[2:35:31] be washed. Sing will be missing. That's
[2:35:33] the church begin. And when the church
[2:35:35] begins to get in his mighty power and
[2:35:36] there a few of them you will see that
[2:35:39] holy church stand together in his power
[2:35:42] positionally placed as sons of God
[2:35:44] adopted into the family of God. Powerful
[2:35:46] church standing in his glory. That's
[2:35:48] what he's coming for.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Just a few more and we're now after
[2:35:57] you're in this land, it doesn't mean
[2:35:59] you're free from war. You still have to
[2:36:01] fight for every inch of ground. Canaan
[2:36:04] didn't represent the great heaven
[2:36:06] because it's wars and troubles and
[2:36:08] killers and fighters, but it did
[2:36:09] represent this. It must be a perfect
[2:36:11] walk.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to skip down. Oh, blessed
[2:36:14] be the name of the Lord.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Then he talk about
[2:36:22] hiding and men died. Innocent men died
[2:36:25] because of a behavior of a believer.
[2:36:27] Behavior, not teachings, not talking,
[2:36:28] not doctrine, a behavior.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; And then afterwards, he say something is
[2:36:32] wrong. They call a prayer and fast. Then
[2:36:34] they try by tribe, family by family
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; and man by man.
[2:36:42] When they finished, they stole a and his
[2:36:44] entire family. Oh yes.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; Watch. Let's go down. Who could doubt
[2:36:51] that? What Paul said, Paul scripture,
[2:36:53] Paul's writing, what he taught the
[2:36:54] church, the church positionally before
[2:36:56] the founding of the world. When God,
[2:36:58] Here we go. This is big. When God in his
[2:37:02] labor pain, this is God having labor
[2:37:04] pain.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; This is God.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; When in his labor pain was bringing
[2:37:08] forth you,
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; knowing what you would do, he
[2:37:12] positionally placed you into his own
[2:37:14] body to To be a housewife, that's a
[2:37:16] position.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; To be a farmer, to be a preacher, to be
[2:37:22] a prophet, to be this, to be that. He
[2:37:23] placed you positionally that when we
[2:37:25] come from the godlands of Egypt through
[2:37:27] sanctification for the into the promised
[2:37:29] land for the promise is the Holy Ghost.
[2:37:32] God have predestinated the church. He
[2:37:34] said all the peoples will be there
[2:37:39] and all the peoples there will be
[2:37:42] millions time millions that will very
[2:37:45] religious and be deceived.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; The only ones that will not be deceived
[2:37:52] will be those that have come over into
[2:37:54] the promised land who before the
[2:37:56] foundation of the world had their names
[2:37:57] on the land book of life. Come over into
[2:37:59] the promised land and enjoying it.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; And enjoying it.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Leaving. Let's go on to
[2:38:09] perfection. Says, I wish I had the voice
[2:38:11] of that angel to bring this to a place
[2:38:12] where you could see it. So the voice of
[2:38:14] the angel is to come to bring you to
[2:38:16] that spot that you could see. Musicians,
[2:38:18] come up, please. Oh, praise be to Jesus.
[2:38:22] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go over something again. So
[2:38:30] Jesus opened their understanding to the
[2:38:32] scriptures and when they got by
[2:38:34] revelation and inspiration, then they
[2:38:37] knew he was God. They had it clear in
[2:38:40] their hearts.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; They could correctly worship.
[2:38:44] sanctified by the truth. They were there
[2:38:47] worshiping continually until
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, God is good. Let's all stand and
[2:38:51] begin to praise God.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Bless you today.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; That's our promise to be living under
[2:39:01] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Oh,

[2:55:12] share [singing and music]
[2:55:13] you.
[2:55:24] Oh, how we long to
[2:55:28] worship you.
[2:55:32] Oh,

[2:56:00] to
[2:56:07] in [singing] worship
[2:56:10] no matter no matter what the circle
[2:56:14] [singing and music]
[2:56:19] no matter what [singing]
[2:56:22] this
[2:56:27] whom we will lift up [singing] all the

[2:56:54] your hands and worship him.

[2:57:42] you.
[2:57:46] Lord we

[2:57:51] you.
[2:57:55] Lord we [singing]
[2:57:59] worship you.
[2:58:04] You feel his presence.
[2:58:34] You feel the presence of the Lord.
[2:58:41] This is the atmosphere where all the
[2:58:44] wrongs could be made right.
[2:58:56] The prophet said one day we'll just be
[2:58:58] standing there and love will just drop
[2:59:01] down and all that's wrong will be made
[2:59:04] right.
[2:59:06] That's the season we're living in.
[2:59:11] Have some prayer requests
[2:59:20] looking for better understanding
[2:59:22] of life to go through the trials they're
[2:59:25] facing
[2:59:27] with his son having a hard time.
[2:59:33] Andrew Henry
[2:59:35] morning. for my grandmother has mobility
[2:59:39] issues and difficulty breathing
[2:59:41] partially due to a mild heart attack
[2:59:43] some weeks ago that God may heal her
[2:59:46] completely and deliver her
[2:59:50] from Sister Bernardet or Susan
[2:59:55] who has stage four cancer.
[2:59:58] And if you have a request this morning
[3:00:00] that has not been written but
[3:00:04] we could unite in faith with you as we
[3:00:08] approach the throne of grace. The word
[3:00:11] teaches us that if two shall agree
[3:00:12] touching anything
[3:00:15] we can have what we ask.
[3:00:18] So we stand in agreement
[3:00:20] with these requests
[3:00:23] as well as every request that we want to
[3:00:26] take together to the throne of grace.
[3:00:29] Unite in our faith and as the prophet
[3:00:31] taught us if we could get into one mind
[3:00:33] and in one accord that in five minutes
[3:00:36] there will be not a feeble person in the
[3:00:38] room. That's the power of when we are
[3:00:41] united in faith around one objective
[3:00:45] which is to see the prayers of the
[3:00:47] saints be raised up to God in the unity
[3:00:50] of one mind one accord and we are
[3:00:53] standing on the promised word of
[3:00:55] scripture.
[3:00:57] Shall we pray? Our heavenly father Lord
[3:00:59] we unite as a church of the living God
[3:01:02] understanding both the power and the
[3:01:04] authority Lord that we have been granted
[3:01:07] through your word Lord through the
[3:01:09] enforcer of the Holy Spirit who is here
[3:01:12] father when your servant your son your
[3:01:15] prophet left the earth the angel did not
[3:01:17] leave and your prophet screamed out the
[3:01:20] angel is on the earth now setting in
[3:01:22] order for the coming of the Lord so we
[3:01:25] thank you for the presence of the angel
[3:01:27] even the Lord Lord Jesus Christ himself
[3:01:29] who is present in our midst to confirm
[3:01:32] the word with signs, wonders, and
[3:01:33] miracles. We have stood behind this
[3:01:36] sacred desk so many times and seen
[3:01:39] prayer requests become notes of praise,
[3:01:42] Father. So Lord, we unite one more time
[3:01:44] as a body of believers, as a church,
[3:01:47] Lord, knowing that all that was in God
[3:01:49] was poured into Christ. And all that was
[3:01:51] in Christ has been poured into the
[3:01:54] church of the living God. And the power
[3:01:56] now stands and rests within the church
[3:01:58] of the living God over every sickness,
[3:02:01] over every disease, over every
[3:02:03] principality, over every power, over
[3:02:06] every attack seen and unseen. Father, so
[3:02:10] we stand Lord on the confession of our
[3:02:12] faith, Lord, knowing who we are and more
[3:02:15] importantly knowing whose we are,
[3:02:17] Father. Lord, we bring this request from
[3:02:20] Shalon Rivers before you, Father. Lord,
[3:02:22] for a touch in their home, a touch in
[3:02:25] their family, a touch for their son. You
[3:02:27] know the situation and we know that you
[3:02:30] are more than able, not just able, but
[3:02:32] more than able to resolve this
[3:02:34] situation. So father may you do what you
[3:02:36] do Lord and arrest the situation
[3:02:39] transform the situation turn the
[3:02:41] situation around change the situation
[3:02:44] Lord they are bringing it to you Lord
[3:02:46] not to take it back but you said cast
[3:02:48] all our cares upon you are well able to
[3:02:51] handle it this morning father we bring
[3:02:53] this request from Andrew Henry for his
[3:02:56] grandmother Lord with this mobility
[3:02:58] issues and the symptoms of the partial
[3:03:01] the mild heart attack father we pray
[3:03:03] dear God that the angel of the Lord will
[3:03:05] find her where she is right now. That
[3:03:08] the angel of the Lord will walk into
[3:03:10] that room. That the angel of the Lord
[3:03:12] will walk to where she is. That the
[3:03:14] angel of the Lord will touch her from
[3:03:16] the crown of her head to the souls of
[3:03:18] her feet. May the power of the
[3:03:20] resurrected Christ flow through her
[3:03:22] body. From the crown of her head to the
[3:03:25] souls of her feet. You've done it before
[3:03:27] and we know you are able to do it again.
[3:03:30] Lord, we bring Suzanne Hadoway before
[3:03:31] you with stage four cancer. Lord, we
[3:03:34] pray, dear God, that the angel of the
[3:03:36] Lord will move to her right now and she
[3:03:39] will come to know you by an experience
[3:03:41] of the supernatural wonder working power
[3:03:44] of God.
[3:03:46] Father God, for every hand that is
[3:03:47] raised here in the sanctuary, for those
[3:03:50] that we could see, for those we cannot
[3:03:52] see, for those who are at home, for
[3:03:54] those that are struggling, whatever the
[3:03:56] situation might be today, Lord, we unite
[3:03:59] in faith. For every brother, we unite in
[3:04:01] faith for every sister. We unite in
[3:04:04] faith for everyone fighting a hidden
[3:04:06] battle, everyone dealing with a
[3:04:08] situation. Father, we say house of hell,
[3:04:11] give way to the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:04:13] Christ. We speak freedom. We speak life.
[3:04:17] Uh we speak healing. We speak
[3:04:20] deliverance. Uh we speak breakthrough.
[3:04:22] We speak in the mighty name of Jesus
[3:04:25] Christ that the sins that the weight
[3:04:28] that the hold back whatever it might be
[3:04:31] would be resolved in the mighty name of
[3:04:33] Jesus Christ.
[3:04:35] Now, as we come to the end of this
[3:04:36] service, Lord, and as we prepare to
[3:04:38] leave this house, but not from your
[3:04:40] presence, may you touch your people one
[3:04:42] more time. May you be with your people
[3:04:45] one more time. May you grant traveling
[3:04:47] mercies and may you bring us back at the
[3:04:49] appointed time. We commit your people
[3:04:50] into your hands. We commit our pastor
[3:04:53] into your hands. We commit his wife into
[3:04:55] your hands. We commit all the ministers,
[3:04:57] elders, deacons, trustees, ushers, helps
[3:05:00] and governments, the church into your
[3:05:02] hands. Lord, we pray for your bride body
[3:05:05] around the world. Uh, Lord, because we
[3:05:07] are one body, Lord, as one faith, one
[3:05:09] Lord, one baptism. We are part of that
[3:05:12] mystical body, Father. So, we pray dear
[3:05:14] God, that you would bind us together, a
[3:05:17] unity of the spirit, Lord, to usher in a
[3:05:20] unity of the faith, Lord. May you touch
[3:05:22] your people one more time in the
[3:05:24] precious name of Jesus Christ. And the
[3:05:25] church says, Amen and amen. You may be
[3:05:28] seated for a few brief announcements.
[3:05:36] We like to welcome believe
[3:05:41] in Sister Marley Pictton. God bless you.
[3:05:43] Welcome to Headstone Tabernacle. We are
[3:05:44] so happy to have you here with us this
[3:05:47] morning. Trust that the service has been
[3:05:50] a blessing to you for our announcements.
[3:05:54] continues here at the tabernacle on
[3:05:57] Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m. We
[3:05:58] encourage you to make an effort to be
[3:06:01] here. We are under great expectation for
[3:06:03] what the Lord will do in our midst this
[3:06:06] coming Friday ahead of us. We will have
[3:06:08] Bible study this coming Friday. We look
[3:06:10] forward to that by the grace of God. And
[3:06:12] this coming Sunday at 10 a.m. we are
[3:06:14] back in the house of the Lord. We are
[3:06:17] getting ready in full strength to close
[3:06:20] this year with a shout maintenance team.
[3:06:24] Please meet brother Andy Henry after
[3:06:27] service next week, Lord willing. Group
[3:06:30] five, which is brother's group is to
[3:06:33] serve. Want to remind the church of our
[3:06:36] special upcoming meetings December
[3:06:39] 13th and 14th. Brother Andrew Glover
[3:06:45] and also our church dinner on December
[3:06:48] 20th. looking forward to seeing everyone
[3:06:52] at all of these critical events as we
[3:06:55] close out this year. And I want to
[3:06:57] encourage you as we prepare to leave to
[3:07:00] practice the presence of the Lord. Uh
[3:07:04] some time ago we said include the Lord
[3:07:06] in your affairs. The Bible tell us if
[3:07:09] you acknowledge him in all your ways he
[3:07:12] will direct
[3:07:14] your path. Sometimes we underestimate
[3:07:17] the power
[3:07:19] in the simplicity of these words because
[3:07:22] if Jesus isn't in the room with you, if
[3:07:24] he's in the conversations with you, if
[3:07:26] you are including him in your decision,
[3:07:28] then your life becomes very different. I
[3:07:30] want to leave you with this. Be very
[3:07:32] careful who you listen to. Many times we
[3:07:35] are under the influence of people who
[3:07:37] have ideas, suggestions,
[3:07:38] recommendations, and many times it
[3:07:40] doesn't line up with the word. It sounds
[3:07:42] good, but if it doesn't line up with the
[3:07:44] word of God, we'll get into problems.
[3:07:47] The rules and the laws and the guidance
[3:07:49] we live by are different from the rest
[3:07:51] of the world because we are not
[3:07:52] creatures of this world. We are just
[3:07:54] here to have a testimony while we are
[3:07:56] here and we come from God and we are
[3:07:58] going back to God. Other people can get
[3:08:00] away with stuff because they are not
[3:08:02] held to the accountability that we are
[3:08:03] under. But we walk our lives under
[3:08:06] teachers and governors because we are
[3:08:07] not predestinated on salvation. We are
[3:08:10] predestinated onto adoption. And because
[3:08:12] we are predestinated unto adoption which
[3:08:14] is different from salvation and God
[3:08:17] intends to place power into your hands
[3:08:19] than the formation of the character. I
[3:08:22] was sharing with a brother yesterday. I
[3:08:24] said the word teaches us God can turn
[3:08:25] the church against you. He could turn
[3:08:27] your wife against you. He could he could
[3:08:28] train a better sickness. That is his
[3:08:31] prerogative. He can do it. And it's for
[3:08:33] your good to see your character under
[3:08:36] pressure. Leadership is tested under
[3:08:38] crisis. The metal of who you are as a
[3:08:41] man or a woman is only proven under
[3:08:44] crisis. If things are well, we do not
[3:08:47] know what stuff you're made up of. And
[3:08:49] God himself wants to prove that you
[3:08:52] could stand the test. You could prove.
[3:08:54] He wants to prove that when nobody else
[3:08:56] is there, you're a Christian. You're a
[3:08:58] Christian not just on Sunday, but on
[3:08:59] Monday, on Tuesday, you're Christian
[3:09:01] when things are going well and you are
[3:09:02] delighted and top of the mountain. But
[3:09:05] more importantly, when you're in the
[3:09:06] valley and things are not going well
[3:09:09] under the pressure, you could stand like
[3:09:11] Job and say, "Though the skin worms
[3:09:13] destroy my body, yet in my flesh, I will
[3:09:15] see God." So, I encourage you, the God
[3:09:18] of the mountain is still God in the
[3:09:20] valley. I encourage you that the God who
[3:09:22] brought you this far is more than able
[3:09:24] to keep not just you, but your family.
[3:09:26] So, be encouraged. Go back to our
[3:09:28] channel, listen to the tapes, be in the
[3:09:30] atmosphere, feed your heart, feed your
[3:09:33] mind with the words of God. Because when
[3:09:36] you are in that channel, you become
[3:09:38] invincible. The promise in the word is a
[3:09:40] mighty marching army. Nothing will stop
[3:09:42] this end time bride. And if you are
[3:09:44] plugged into that, that nothing is on
[3:09:47] your job, in your neighborhood, on the
[3:09:49] road, you are living higher than the
[3:09:51] environment that you're in. So may the
[3:09:53] Lord rich bless you. May the Lord keep
[3:09:55] you. May he keep you positive in the
[3:09:57] channel of God and may you understand
[3:09:59] that you are not just a normal human
[3:10:01] being. You are a daughter and a son of
[3:10:03] the living God. God wish you bless you.
[3:10:09] Amen.
[3:10:13] Thank you so
[3:10:20] I shall not be moved. Amen. It is
[3:10:23] abiding. Amen. I shall not be moved. I
