[7:30] lord I pray that as we go into the word

[7:37] that or we could take another look at it
[7:39] and true the ministering of the word

[7:44] Lord and a time of deliverance father
[7:45] that we could see lives change and

[7:54] praise tonight Lord we come tonight Lord
[7:58] Lord looking for something more looking
[8:00] for something from your word that we
[8:02] could climb a bit higher we could drink
[8:05] out of the humanistic realm and father
[8:07] we could see that Lord as bad as
[8:09] sometimes we feel things are there are
[8:11] people who are going through even harder
[8:13] times and you truly will never give us
[8:15] more than we can bear so may you
[8:18] strengthen our faith Lord as you spoke

[9:53] minister to us in a special way in the
[9:55] precious name of Jesus Christ amen and
[9:57] amen and amen
[9:58] well it's certainly a great privilege to
[10:00] be here tonight and as we would have
[10:03] indicated last week this is I guess a
[10:07] new order for services of the week where
[10:11] we have the Sunday service and I really
[10:12] want to appreciate those who both meted
[10:14] out as well as connected as we Traverse
[10:17] and transition into this new normal or
[10:20] fooling of the new normal as it were and
[10:22] and I believe some sunny laughs and it
[10:25] was a real tremendous blessing it was
[10:27] certainly a privilege to see those who
[10:29] were there and certainly to be connected
[10:31] to those who were not able to make it
[10:34] but we thank God for His grace to us and
[10:36] how he has kept us and he has preserved
[10:38] us and and to have this Tuesday night
[10:42] call it a study and prayer we really
[10:45] want to take from what we learned over
[10:48] the last three months and really
[10:49] this medium on a Tuesday night a little
[10:52] bit of teaching a little bit of Bible
[10:53] study bit a Sunday school as it will and
[10:54] first to look at the scripture sometime
[10:56] we'll be descriptive said I'm gonna be
[10:58] true prophets message and can I just
[10:59] bring some things out to you and I was
[11:02] short time a prayer and then tomorrow
[11:03] night at 8 p.m. we have our Wednesday
[11:05] night service and this week we would
[11:08] have indicated at our Friday night will
[11:10] let you know what we will be doing and
[11:12] this particular week on Friday night
[11:13] we'll have pre meeting as well so it's
[11:17] Sunday school a little bit of teaching
[11:19] tonight and I'm not sure how to title a
[11:24] Bible study but if I want to call it a
[11:27] text a night just for your reference
[11:29] we will be in second Kings five that's
[11:34] where we're at tonight so if you have
[11:36] your Bibles and you want to ride with me
[11:37] we'll be in second Kings five tonight
[11:41] and if I were to give it a little
[11:44] thought
[11:44] it is Elijah Neiman and jazzy that is
[11:48] what we're gonna study tonight and then
[11:50] have a little time of Prayer
[11:51] Elijah Neiman and Josie and I pray it
[11:57] will be a blessing to you and it's a
[12:00] it's a I would say it's somewhat a
[12:02] familiar scripture because many times we
[12:05] quickly reference Neiman and Elijah and
[12:10] he instruction to go dip seven times but
[12:13] like I would have said in previous
[12:14] meetings like these sometimes we drive
[12:17] so quickly that we miss certain very
[12:20] small things so I want to kind of take
[12:22] it verse by verse and just pull out a
[12:24] few things tonight so second Kings 5 and
[12:30] verse 1 now Neiman captain of the hosts
[12:35] of the king of Syria what a title ah
[12:37] there's like commander in chief now
[12:39] naman captain of the host of the king of
[12:42] Syria
[12:44] captain of the host eyes everything of
[12:46] the king of Syria was a great man with
[12:49] his master
[12:51] that's a powerful statement he's a great
[12:52] man with his master so it meant that his
[12:55] master beanie King considered him a
[12:58] great man treated him as a great man he
[13:00] was was considered a great man he's a
[13:02] captain so his credentials the Spy's is
[13:05] very powerful he's a captain he is
[13:08] captain with a great responsibility he
[13:11] is reportedly a king who considers him
[13:13] great and he is honorable so in Bible
[13:16] says he is a great man with his master
[13:18] and honorable because of him the Lord
[13:23] had given deliverance on to Syria he was
[13:26] also a mighty man in Vala
[13:29] so thus far we have a really this is it
[13:33] is any way to describe somebody this is
[13:36] how ideally I would love to be described
[13:39] and I think for any of us it is it is
[13:42] how anybody should want to be described
[13:44] because there is nothing negative in his
[13:46] resume everything is positive even by
[13:49] the Brenham gives credit to Nieman and
[13:51] his character and his behavior and what
[13:53] he represents him but in verse one ends
[13:56] with but he was a leper naman he was a
[14:01] captain he was great he was honorable
[14:04] and whenever I'm reading with ladies I
[14:07] want to challenge a question to all of
[14:09] us can people see that you agreed and
[14:12] people say that you are honorable can
[14:13] people see that you're a mighty person
[14:16] of Valor meaning you're fearless you
[14:17] Bollier believing what you believe in he
[14:20] is a captain he was great he was
[14:23] honorable he was a mighty man of Valor
[14:25] but he was a leper but he was quitting
[14:31] his peon was not as a result of being
[14:34] poor if you were to do deep study of the
[14:38] time in which he was living in and what
[14:41] it took to be a captain and what
[14:43] captain's were given and what he had it
[14:46] was not a peon of being poor he was
[14:49] hurting not from a war injury
[14:52] he was nothing not because of his place
[14:55] in society because outside of being in a
[14:58] royal family he was pretty much the
[15:00] highest he could have achieved that he
[15:03] could have worked to achieve
[15:06] he was hurting not because he was unable
[15:09] to achieve because to be considered
[15:12] great by those that are above you those
[15:14] that are around you and everyone it
[15:17] meant that he had a work ethic and an
[15:20] approach to doing things and he Bible
[15:22] says that the Lord had given deliverance
[15:24] on to Syria because of him but he was a
[15:29] leper he was hurting he was not hurting
[15:33] with a toothache he was not hurting with
[15:36] a headache he was not hurting with a
[15:38] back peel
[15:39] he wasn't written with I trouble he was
[15:42] hurting from an incurable disease I want
[15:46] you to process that for a minute an
[15:47] incurable disease now this is all in
[15:50] scripture so we want to take our time
[15:51] and try to get through as much of this
[15:54] if the Lord would work that's the night
[15:57] it is quite a very large chapter and
[16:00] I'll try to see how much of it we can
[16:02] get through tonight taking it very
[16:03] slowly he was hurting with an incurable
[16:07] disease because leprosy is something
[16:10] that we know about throughout Scripture
[16:13] and it was considered an incurable
[16:15] disease you can live with many
[16:18] sicknesses and love your life unaffected
[16:21] by the people around you
[16:25] there are many people who and they want
[16:28] young people look out there young people
[16:30] with HIV looking healthy healthy healthy
[16:31] be careful as a warning
[16:35] but this is this is not HIV this is not
[16:40] something that you could live with as a
[16:42] peon or sickness and keep hidden that
[16:45] easy this is
[16:46] leprosy so you have somebody who has
[16:49] been a great standing somebody who is
[16:51] hauling public around public figure but
[16:54] he is hurting he is hurting from a
[16:57] disease and before we could get to the
[16:59] context of holy son fools he is good to
[17:01] come a disease that brings shame that
[17:05] brings rejection that brings separation
[17:08] even when Jesus was on the earth he
[17:11] didn't even lay hands on the lepers he
[17:14] said go and show yourself to the priest
[17:19] Jesus himself didn't want to interact
[17:22] with the lepers because leprosy is
[17:24] something that is contagious
[17:28] this man was hurting from a disease that
[17:31] required that you live
[17:33] typically in what it was call a leper
[17:35] colony but somehow you where he lived
[17:38] his life
[17:40] allowed him to live away from the other
[17:43] lepers think about it for a minute I
[17:46] know many of us we haven't slowed along
[17:48] to really process this and in that time
[17:51] if you had leprosy and leprosy is almost
[17:54] like a flesh-eating disease here your
[17:55] your work body
[17:57] but here it is this man is considered
[18:00] great he's considered honorable he is a
[18:03] leader he has authority he has position
[18:06] he has rank but he has a sickness that
[18:09] is contagious that people run from and
[18:11] he is being allowed to operate he's
[18:15] being allowed to lead an army in so much
[18:18] that God will give victory because of
[18:20] him what kind of man is that and with a
[18:23] sickness that would normally have you
[18:25] hiding away from people you will
[18:28] actually be allowed to offer it this man
[18:32] is living with a disease that would
[18:34] normally bring scorn that would normally
[18:37] bring resentment many people I'm sure
[18:42] would have had situations where you walk
[18:44] this street and maybe they saw somebody
[18:45] living on a street a vagrant and they
[18:47] have sores on their skin
[18:49] something kinda comes over you when you
[18:52] see that on the road almost on an
[18:54] unconscious or subconscious level you
[18:56] might just pull away just a little bit
[18:57] because you seeing that person has an
[19:00] infection I've seen people on the road
[19:02] with open wounds
[19:06] such is somebody with the condition of
[19:08] leprosy this man is living with a
[19:12] disease that bring scorn that bring use
[19:15] them and we still in this one
[19:18] let's take it a little deeper this is a
[19:21] man who led his people to victory and
[19:24] when the time comes to celebrate you
[19:26] would not want to shake his hand
[19:31] it is expected that when you experience
[19:34] victory people would hug you pat you on
[19:36] the back but not this man you cannot do
[19:39] it because you don't want to catch what
[19:42] he has we're still in we still in verse
[19:46] one
[19:49] in his case his victories would come
[19:52] with the ever so hushed whispers don't
[19:55] get too close his victories would come
[19:59] with he ever so quiet I can take a
[20:02] picture with him his victories would
[20:05] come with be careful around him because
[20:08] he has a contagious incurable disease
[20:13] that if you catch it in would destroy
[20:17] your life this is a man who is living
[20:20] with the pain of celebrating victories
[20:23] all by himself
[20:26] but he is so successful he has such
[20:29] credentials of achievement in his life
[20:32] that he has commanded respect but he is
[20:35] still an outcast and for those who are
[20:39] younger among us who he had he would
[20:42] leprosy in passing and I've never really
[20:44] looked at it because it is found in
[20:45] different pieces of Scripture leprosy
[20:47] also known as Hansen's disease is a
[20:50] long-term infection and listen carefully
[20:53] this infection can lead to damage of the
[20:55] nerves
[20:56] respiratory tract skins and eyes this
[21:00] nerve damage may result in a lack of the
[21:02] ability to feel pain which can lead to a
[21:06] loss of parts of a person's extremities
[21:08] so you can lose your hand from repeated
[21:10] injuries or infection due to you not
[21:13] even noticing the wounds that you have
[21:15] an infected person may experience
[21:18] muscle weakness poor eyesight leprosy
[21:23] symptoms usually begin within a year but
[21:26] for some people it could take up to 20
[21:29] years for it to manifest itself so you
[21:31] can be a silent carrier of leprosy
[21:33] leprosy is spread between people the
[21:37] spread is thought to occur through cough
[21:39] or contact with fluid from the nose of a
[21:41] person infected by leprosy
[21:50] so people would have been careful around
[21:52] this man before I go further I want to
[21:56] make mention tonight that there is a
[21:58] disease that is much worse than leprosy
[22:01] and I'm not talking about covert 19 I'm
[22:04] not talking Whitaker on a virus I'm not
[22:06] talking about anything else that exists
[22:07] um there's a disease that makes you an
[22:09] outcast and no matter how much you
[22:12] achieve in life it brings a separation
[22:15] it makes you an outcast it brings a
[22:17] separation from God and this disease is
[22:21] called sin and just as leprosy would
[22:25] have a sickening smell to it sin also
[22:28] has a sickening smell beneath the
[22:31] achievements beneath the activity
[22:34] beneath the cover-up there's a pin but
[22:38] we have good news tonight there's hope
[22:40] this is a Bible study huh
[22:42] naman would have had to make every
[22:45] effort I want this to think about it to
[22:48] hide his condition once he was out of
[22:53] his house he would have had to be
[22:55] completely covered talk about cover-up
[22:58] his armor was not just for physical
[23:02] defense it was a psychological defense
[23:05] it was a mental defense it was an
[23:08] emotional affair his public life is what
[23:12] is described in verse one but when we go
[23:16] to verse two and three it is written it
[23:18] is also unwritten something about his
[23:21] private life so let's go on O verse 2
[23:25] and the Syrians had gone out by
[23:28] companies and brought away captive out
[23:31] of the Land of Israel a little Mead and
[23:33] she waited on Nieman's wife so we have
[23:39] Lehman his greatness his credentials his
[23:44] resume his achievements his
[23:47] accomplishments his pain that we just
[23:50] spent some minutes talking about what
[23:52] his leprosy would have meant and then
[23:54] the scripture goes on to the CM Syria
[23:57] and that he would have led with
[23:59] go on and I guess going through the
[24:02] streets of Israel we don't know how the
[24:05] war played out but there was a young
[24:07] girl maybe instead of her being killed
[24:10] something about her Cortney attention
[24:12] and she is brought into Nima's house to
[24:16] work for Nieman's wife as a servant girl
[24:20] and she said this is the servant girl
[24:25] said unto her mistress which is Nieman's
[24:28] wife what god my lord were with the
[24:32] prophets that is in Samaria for he would
[24:36] recover him of his leprosy said another
[24:41] way because when you do in Bible study
[24:42] you need to go now and sometimes check
[24:44] back how much other ways it is said to
[24:47] me to capture it clearly she said to her
[24:49] mistress what that my Lord will with the
[24:52] Prophet who is in Samaria he would cure
[24:54] him of his leprosy so I asked the
[24:57] question because it's about character
[24:59] it's about life it's about living a life
[25:01] in front of people it meant that
[25:05] Neiman's home life we spend some time
[25:07] talking about his public life
[25:09] it meant that Neiman's private life had
[25:13] an impact on this servant girl that she
[25:18] actually took an interest or a concern
[25:22] in to Neiman's well-being now typically
[25:25] the relationship between master and
[25:27] slave or master and servant is not the
[25:30] is not a typically a pleasant one more
[25:33] often than not there's a level of scorn
[25:36] or a level of I'm better than you so you
[25:39] can tell me anything there's there's a
[25:41] disconnect between masters and leaders
[25:44] and people who are typically perceived
[25:45] to be in a lower level but however
[25:48] Nieman lived his life impressed on a
[25:52] girl who didn't want to be there it was
[25:55] not her choice to be in the house she
[25:57] didn't apply for the job to be there she
[26:00] was a captain yet in her captivity
[26:03] Mammon's life and the way he lived
[26:07] brought a impression upon this young
[26:10] girl's life maybe it was Nieman coming
[26:14] home after a great victory and after he
[26:18] had in all of his defenses to deal with
[26:20] a public he would come home and break
[26:23] down because of the silent P and he was
[26:27] living with that he really couldn't show
[26:28] out there maybe this seven girls saw him
[26:33] trying to relate how the war was and and
[26:35] how normally people get trophies and
[26:38] accolades but he couldn't go out there
[26:41] and do that in that way because of his
[26:43] condition maybe she overheard him
[26:45] gasping in pain
[26:48] the peon that he would only saw in
[26:50] private because it would be weak for him
[26:52] to show it in public and for him to be
[26:54] also still be called a great man living
[26:57] with this kind of team but however it
[27:00] cleared out this young girl is moved so
[27:02] much that she is willing to testify
[27:05] about a prophet and it should say Amen
[27:09] she's willing to break rank so to speak
[27:13] because this man is a spiritual man as
[27:16] well you see it he has a role to play
[27:17] his relationship with his King was not
[27:20] just military and we'll see it later
[27:22] down his relationship with his King was
[27:25] with there was also a spiritual part of
[27:27] it so she's in a house and she breaks
[27:30] rank so to speak to go to Neiman's wife
[27:34] and said my only desire is that my
[27:38] master who is naman can meet this
[27:41] prophet my prophet there's a prophet in
[27:44] the land and if I could just get naman
[27:46] to this prophet then something had
[27:49] happened the Bible doesn't tell us holy
[27:51] conversation would pass from one to one
[27:54] so you've ever said she said until her
[27:57] mistress would God my Lord will be the
[28:00] prophet that is in Samaria for he would
[28:02] recover him of left 40 leprosy between
[28:05] verse 3 and verse 4 the Bible doesn't
[28:08] recall the conversation between Nieman
[28:11] and his wife so we found God that
[28:15] Neiman's wife had to love her husband so
[28:18] much to bring this news to him of what
[28:21] his one her servant that said so the
[28:26] nemeth wife obviously would have gone to
[28:28] her husband and say listen this sleeve
[28:31] here this evangelist telling me about
[28:32] some prophet and if you go to this
[28:35] prophet you could be made wool the Bible
[28:39] said in verse four and one went in
[28:41] speaking about Nieman and told his Lord
[28:44] speaking Abadi king saying thus and thus
[28:46] said the maid that is of the Land of
[28:50] Israel so in other words we Unversed for
[28:52] now everybody with me so basically this
[28:56] verse for seeing so Nieman went in and
[28:58] told his Lord the King Russ and so spoke
[29:01] the good
[29:02] from the land of Israel and the king of
[29:05] Syria said go now in other words I don't
[29:09] know how much responsibility the King
[29:11] took in protecting Nieman's reputation
[29:14] but the King jumped at the opportunity
[29:16] to bring healing so maybe his most
[29:20] trusted lawyer captain anybody with me
[29:25] so Gordon now we in verse four and I
[29:31] will send a letter to the king of Israel
[29:34] we are we are here in verse five now
[29:40] right and the king of Syria said go to
[29:44] which is written as is ready go now go
[29:48] and I will send a letter unto the king
[29:50] of Israel
[29:51] and he departed so he's immediately the
[29:54] Bible doesn't tell us how long Nieman is
[29:57] living with leprosy but obviously the
[30:00] hope and the opportunity and the
[30:02] possibility of healing is enough to
[30:05] motivate Nieman to leave immediately he
[30:08] drops everything and the King writes an
[30:11] immediate letter almost a letter of
[30:15] recommendation as it were and the king
[30:17] of Syria said go to go and I will send
[30:19] the letter unto the king of Israel and
[30:21] he departed and he took with him ten
[30:24] talents of silver and six thousand
[30:27] pieces of gold and ten changes of
[30:30] raiment
[30:32] so Neiman is going now with a whole set
[30:35] of gold a whole set of silver and ten
[30:39] changes of clothing which it wouldn't be
[30:42] no kind of half clothing it will be
[30:44] really good clues he going because he
[30:46] going on and basically tried to find
[30:49] healing at a price so to speak
[30:54] everybody with me so far verse six and
[30:58] he brought the letter to the king of
[31:00] Israel saying
[31:04] so this is what it contains a letter no
[31:07] when this letter is common to thee this
[31:09] is what the King wrote you think I'm a
[31:10] sir the king of Syria routinely king of
[31:12] Israel who should be Jeroboam I believe
[31:15] which is a hab son would have been the
[31:17] king at that time or jwharam
[31:20] jeremy a hab son was king at this time
[31:24] and he brought the letter to the king of
[31:26] Israel saying no when this letter is
[31:28] coming to D behold I have dear with sent
[31:31] name and my servant today that don't
[31:34] mayor's recover him of his leprosy could
[31:37] you imagine could you imagine somebody
[31:40] come to you with a letter letter say
[31:43] here what I send somebody here well what
[31:46] did a fixie leprosy problem that he have
[31:52] if ever says that and it came to pass
[31:55] when the king of vision had ready letter
[31:57] here and his clothes and renting a
[32:00] clothes is like the ultimate display of
[32:02] anger this is like this is he actually
[32:05] you know he suggested shut the rip you
[32:07] closed the king of Israel rent his
[32:11] clothes and said am i God will feel I am
[32:16] a my god am I good to kill and to make
[32:20] alive
[32:20] in other words you bring a case to me
[32:22] that I cannot handle and I'm insulted
[32:25] not only insulted he says am I going to
[32:28] kill and to make a life that this man
[32:30] that said unto me to recover a man of
[32:33] his leprosy
[32:34] wherefore consider I pray you and see
[32:37] how he seek it a quarrel against me
[32:39] so the King process this letter and this
[32:42] leper as a challenge that can lead to
[32:45] war in other words I send in somebody
[32:47] for you to fix the problem so the king
[32:50] said I think if I don't fix the problem
[32:52] this or that King would be upset so
[32:54] you're really trying to be it mentor
[32:56] you're ready time to set up a war
[32:57] because I set a situation to me akka
[32:59] handle so it's like you're stacking the
[33:02] odds against me all right
[33:03] everybody with me
[33:10] so I just want to read it from another
[33:13] translation and when they give me a
[33:14] visual read the letter he tore his
[33:16] clothes and said am I good to kill and
[33:18] to make alive that this man sends word
[33:21] to me
[33:21] to cure a man of his leprosy only
[33:24] consider so I imagine he's speaking in
[33:26] his Kings court or Colosseum are we
[33:29] trying to pick a quarrel with me pick a
[33:31] fight with me my cellar situation a car
[33:33] a castle he said no listing as if I
[33:36] could solve it a car solve it so
[33:39] obviously if I sent him back he could
[33:40] say I'll do it and and maybe I couldn't
[33:42] do it and didn't do it so you rage on a
[33:43] pickup fight is ready an attempt to go
[33:45] to war but he Bible says in verse eight
[33:48] and it was so when Elisha the man of God
[33:53] Alleluia had heard that the king of
[33:56] Israel had rented schools so this is no
[33:58] news good news headline King rents close
[34:03] because this is all that Elijah hood the
[34:06] King granted he likes all he likes a
[34:11] here but his story here here who come
[34:13] here here when you request was you don't
[34:15] know who t he all he know the king read
[34:18] his schools and that is enough to Elijah
[34:20] to drop what he's doing to come and ask
[34:23] the question why your rent your clothes
[34:25] and it was so when Elijah the man of God
[34:28] had heard that the king of Israel had
[34:31] rent his clothes that he sends to the
[34:33] king saying
[34:34] wherefore has no rent I close is your
[34:37] seriousness let him come no to me that
[34:42] he shall know that day is a prophet in
[34:44] Israel I love that in other words the
[34:48] king can handle assembly problem over to
[34:50] me so like I can let them know that
[34:52] there is a prophet in Israel
[34:54] glory so name one I can imagine could
[34:59] you imagine now because naman would be
[35:01] looking at this letter looking le king
[35:03] expression seeing maybe the king or any
[35:04] school or how that whole thing unplayed
[35:06] but no it's almost like you have hope
[35:08] again you hope restored you hope renewed
[35:11] because what look like failure and it
[35:13] looked like he was about to go back to
[35:15] Syria
[35:15] suddenly I get in GPS coordinates so
[35:19] somebody else house
[35:20] in Sumeria where a man named Elijah is
[35:23] living and you toll on go to your next
[35:25] destination he will take care of you so
[35:29] naman came with his horses and with his
[35:31] chariot and stood at the door of the
[35:34] house of Elijah
[35:35] now this is where it gets interesting
[35:39] this is a great man let me just go back
[35:42] again captain of the host of the king of
[35:44] syria great man with his master
[35:47] honorable mighty man and valor that is
[35:51] making sure we know who we talking about
[35:52] here all right I want to put in parallel
[35:55] of the Roman centurion who went against
[35:58] a when I see it on one go he go it when
[36:00] I see the one can we commit this Niemann
[36:03] reach in front of Elisha house and the
[36:06] Bible says Elisha sent a messenger unto
[36:09] him well naman blow a fuse gasket went
[36:15] engine went Nieman cannot free life of
[36:19] him understand
[36:22] the Bible says and Elijah sent a
[36:26] messenger unto him saying go and wash in
[36:29] Jordan seven times and I flesh shall
[36:32] come again to thee and thou shalt be
[36:34] clean and Neiman was wrought and went
[36:37] away seeing the world
[36:38] I thought he will surely come out to me
[36:40] and stand and call on the name of the
[36:44] Lord his God and strike his hand over
[36:46] the police and recover the level where
[36:51] the Branham said it like this
[36:52] he said naman was supposed to dip seven
[36:57] times in the Jordan he said why he
[37:00] didn't have to do that you know it was
[37:01] just a symbol that the Prophet gave him
[37:03] to do something to do so but a grandma
[37:08] was typing that interchange is really an
[37:12] issue of discipline and obedience and
[37:17] that is where it began to uncover that
[37:21] the problem that Neiman had was not just
[37:24] the leprosy he had some issues taking
[37:28] instructions he had some issues with
[37:31] guidance he had some issues following
[37:33] following recommendations maybe he got
[37:37] so used to giving instructions he had a
[37:38] problem taking instructions somebody
[37:41] helped me tonight he was he said
[37:44] insulted that this Elisha whoever he
[37:48] likes sure is wouldn't even come outside
[37:50] and talk to me I reach in front your
[37:52] house you you you you you ever went took
[37:54] somebody host and somebody else come is
[37:58] a complicity person so he have a mighty
[38:05] man the second in command in Syria as it
[38:07] were reaching funny lights out and he
[38:09] like Shay was he inside drinking coffee
[38:11] he said go by the Jordan I'm going to be
[38:16] seven times the first issue the first
[38:19] issue naman has read it
[38:21] he was wrought and went away went away
[38:24] and it comes back to I wrote some
[38:29] questions before I approach today and I
[38:30] ask the same question how bad do you
[38:32] want deliverance because
[38:35] this was a test of hope how much it
[38:37] already meant to me money after you go
[38:40] through all you went to you reach that
[38:41] point and you are not insulted by any
[38:45] instruction yet the end you you are
[38:48] insulted by an instruction but before
[38:50] your easy instruction you're insulted by
[38:52] who give the instruction he instructed
[38:55] by how the instruction come here and
[38:57] deal with it with you with what
[38:58] instruction is yet here you just upset
[39:00] with who tell you so so the first I'll
[39:04] tell you something but it's not a pasta
[39:06] so you're done oh God I mainly remember
[39:11] come over there the D can tell you
[39:15] something and and and just II couldn't
[39:19] because the holy messenger is and like
[39:21] did brother over tell you to tell me
[39:25] under whose is so why and anybody with
[39:30] me anybody with me tonight
[39:33] hallelujah
[39:35] listen the Bible have everything you
[39:39] know the more I study it when people
[39:42] live an act as like a witness as a
[39:44] Niemann spirit a boy the name when I
[39:49] know infant we took with the deal with
[39:52] the elements that is near munching here
[39:54] so Neiman was wrought and went away he
[39:57] went away walked away from his healing
[40:00] walked away from his blessing walked
[40:03] away from his deliverance because he
[40:05] didn't like who came to speak with him
[40:07] and that's a deep message a deep lesson
[40:11] because he regardless of who was
[40:13] speaking to him he was being given the
[40:15] right message he was being given the
[40:18] right instruction and it underscores
[40:20] something very different
[40:22] go ahead use anybody God could use
[40:27] anybody but God was also dealing with
[40:30] Neiman and I love because brother
[40:33] branham said it like this he said any
[40:35] days of Elijah he said there were many
[40:38] lepers
[40:38] but the Bible records only one and every
[40:42] time I go with the script I always say
[40:44] when the Bible brings up an issue
[40:47] is a message is a teaching it's clarity
[40:50] for us to take notes and to learn and to
[40:52] ensure that we are gonna take teaching
[40:55] so we'd love to repeat the issues and
[40:58] that I hear anybody with me tonight
[41:00] it might sound simple but it is a deep
[41:03] teaching a simple team teaching Niemann
[41:07] was wrought he went away so I want you
[41:11] to picture something Neiman didn't come
[41:13] by himself so the people who are around
[41:17] him would see this interchange of a
[41:20] Sylvan coming out speaking to Neiman
[41:22] Neiman losing it children I say we go in
[41:25] I wonder if there were young people
[41:27] around me man who was seen as behavior
[41:30] what message was he teaching them what
[41:34] was he displaying to his men because
[41:39] everything in life is a lesson anybody
[41:42] with me tonight it's about discipline
[41:46] it's about understanding every action we
[41:50] take somebody is watching us and we have
[41:52] to understand that they are first-order
[41:55] consequences and second-order
[41:57] consequences of our actions be who I
[42:02] thought you see that thereby the problem
[42:06] be whole I thought he will surely come
[42:09] out to me and stand so you define it how
[42:12] the monocots of us operate
[42:15] you you know how the amount of God
[42:18] supposed to break ladies here behold
[42:21] I thought you see that spot right there
[42:24] woody problem sir
[42:25] but if I hadn't said it like this he
[42:29] said like all Neiman this is from the
[42:33] message Israel on the church like only
[42:35] man when a man went down to get his he
[42:37] likes a tool him to go down doc seven
[42:39] times or dip seven time oh my that hurt
[42:42] his prestige well number the my name if
[42:47] we go over and we believe this and
[42:48] believe that we'll have a nice shirt and
[42:50] treat everybody nice happy little money
[42:52] except he's but a man was bringing out
[42:54] here that people have their own idea
[42:56] their own thinking their own beliefs of
[42:58] how things should be
[43:00] but God was dealing now with with me and
[43:04] how his thinking it was up the name and
[43:06] he tell you holding aluminum imagine you
[43:12] go Mary doctor I want you I was getting
[43:14] imagine if every doctor and the doctor
[43:16] is is given you a prescription Nana died
[43:20] nary prescription I want to do this I
[43:26] mean it should be this is that is eating
[43:29] a comedy doctor or you want to fix
[43:31] yourself you company that they regret to
[43:33] tell you Trudy newest Trudy he decide he
[43:37] pharmacist whatever go and do this any
[43:39] like man excitatory doctor would have
[43:41] come and right behold I thought he will
[43:49] surely come out to me and stand he said
[43:52] yet to stand up to do you got Saddam
[43:53] talk about defining and this is why I
[43:56] appreciate but over it so much because
[43:58] if you listen to what everybody think
[44:00] you it should be in trouble enough if
[44:03] you don't move by revolutionary
[44:05] inspiration one person think you should
[44:08] stand up in the front somebody think you
[44:09] should pray me back somebody think you
[44:11] should put it George so somebody think
[44:13] you should do it this way somebody think
[44:14] everybody thoughts into attend thought
[44:15] into Totten you're tarnishing Spanish is
[44:18] sit ting ting ting and afterwards you
[44:20] spinning like a top that's the way you
[44:22] know what I think I
[44:26] he will surely come out he was convinced
[44:28] he will surely come out I get spending
[44:31] who has it even in this one wisdom I
[44:32] trying to get on get me an early chapter
[44:34] come out to me and stand and call on the
[44:37] name of the Lord his God is hidden
[44:41] Syrian defining the terms of engagement
[44:44] of Elijah and his good and strike his
[44:48] hand over the police and recovery leper
[44:50] so that was his first issue for this
[44:53] issue then he goes on so in other words
[44:55] to add insult to injury that that's what
[44:57] he seems
[44:58] I'm not a banner and flapper rivers of
[45:02] Damascus better than all the waters of
[45:05] Israel so not only expected he
[45:09] prescription to be different but if you
[45:11] want me to wash I know better places to
[45:15] wash me I'm not washing them and be
[45:21] clean so he turned and he went away in a
[45:23] rage really bad I'm said it this way
[45:28] except a man be born again he will in no
[45:31] wise enter the kingdom notice it these
[45:35] charitable things are fine that's not
[45:38] God provided we hear him keen from his
[45:41] own weak so but a Branham type this to
[45:44] people who own their own way
[45:46] he said Kim come his own way and many
[45:50] tonight are coming their own way the one
[45:52] the world the gospel they want church
[45:55] they want this ministry to be today
[45:57] appetite so I would obviously it's a
[45:59] buffet so you want to take me things
[46:01] that please you you cannot even reason
[46:04] it why reasons can't even your reasons
[46:07] and not eligible in other ways how you
[46:08] think it should be is not even eligible
[46:10] you're not eligible to reason it out if
[46:13] you can reason it it would be no more
[46:16] feet you've got to offer it by feet you
[46:19] saw no you say by the banner you mean I
[46:20] have to get down there and get filled
[46:23] with the Holy Ghost and carry on like
[46:25] the rest of them if you expect to be
[46:27] with the rest of them you do that's all
[46:29] yes sir you can take it
[46:31] Neiman had the same thing God told the
[46:34] Prophet tell him go down and did seven
[46:36] times and he said isn't this water
[46:38] cleaner and better but it was that water
[46:40] of Jordan looks pretty bad sometimes can
[46:44] the church say Amen I'll touch it apart
[46:54] a little atone and this is where I find
[46:59] it gets a little interesting because
[47:01] it's important there are many lessons
[47:03] here even though naman was angry he was
[47:09] upset he went away in Ridge he had to
[47:12] have such a relationship with his
[47:14] servants I have a friend of mine who
[47:18] runs a business and I have been in
[47:21] meetings with him and I have seen him
[47:24] lose it slam is Hannah new table and
[47:27] scream at his employees because he's
[47:29] looking for a certain level of service
[47:31] if he hears something was wrong with a
[47:34] customer he is furious cause he wants
[47:36] his customers to be happy
[47:37] well the amazing thing about it is he is
[47:40] employees of such a love for him such a
[47:43] respect for him he's a Christian and I
[47:47] had my only fact that he could have a
[47:49] standard and he was not compromise only
[47:52] service he wants to give and even though
[47:55] he would correct them and straighten
[47:57] things out there's a love that they have
[47:59] for him that speaks volumes to the
[48:01] character of leadership because you
[48:03] could be firm you could be in command
[48:06] you could command respect not because I
[48:09] discipline you or shout at you for doing
[48:12] something that's wrong doesn't mean
[48:15] there's not love there or that love
[48:16] cannot be there but it is evident from
[48:19] this scripture that the greatness of
[48:22] Neiman and the way he lived and even
[48:25] though he was in this condition of rage
[48:27] his servants still had his best interest
[48:30] at heart
[48:31] because if his servant with malicious
[48:33] you were to say well boss your your your
[48:36] day tomorrow disrespect you well let me
[48:38] go let me go let me just bomb to be a
[48:39] Zuba you know you listen you better than
[48:42] that do let him worry just back here and
[48:44] all of them when I ride out and he will
[48:46] I still having leprosy condition but he
[48:49] Bible says and his servants came near
[48:51] and speak unto Him
[48:54] and said my father they speaking with
[48:58] respect if the Prophet had bid me to do
[49:01] some great thing wouldest Dowell not
[49:04] have done it
[49:05] how much rather than when he said to
[49:07] thee wash and be clean and they are two
[49:11] sides of it only one hand it is the
[49:14] servants love for their master as it
[49:16] were but on the other hand I feel it
[49:19] really powerful that that can encounter
[49:22] almost humbled Neiman didn't listen to
[49:27] his servants because it was not Elijah
[49:33] who end up convincing Nieman to go into
[49:36] Jordan it was his servants who persuaded
[49:41] him to go to Jordan
[49:43] it's a powerful teaching on leadership
[49:46] because if you are ever in a position of
[49:49] leadership it takes great wisdom to
[49:51] understand how to deal with people who
[49:54] may not be on your level but also
[49:56] genuinely have your best interest at
[49:59] heart it also applies to parenting it
[50:02] applies to any situation where there is
[50:06] a disproportionate or even balance of
[50:10] power
[50:12] many time as people go up and run the
[50:14] ignore good ideas around them but Neiman
[50:18] as upset as he was and I guess his
[50:21] servants knew him well enough to be able
[50:23] to persuade him listen listen you know
[50:27] if this man actually do something good
[50:29] and he would I get recognition and
[50:30] respect you were to do it so what's so
[50:32] different about this we're ready come
[50:35] for where are you come to change for you
[50:37] ready come all this way to go back home
[50:39] and do the same thing you ready come all
[50:41] this way so just walk away and I leave
[50:44] with nothing
[50:45] I don't know how much time they would
[50:46] have spent trying to explain this to him
[50:48] but it takes great strength up because
[50:50] it's now known Eamonn is no humble he
[50:53] has to be humble because after there
[50:55] there are people who so want to take you
[50:58] road of doing it not he disrespect me
[51:00] then they wouldn't even come back if
[51:02] something good for them I leave early
[51:04] church I coming back and they never want
[51:07] to come up because that Brower never go
[51:09] back there and I had to go and unwind
[51:12] all and woods it it all back because the
[51:16] way me my left
[51:18] you were not excused of thought he would
[51:21] have gone and did it
[51:23] everybody with me we taking out what
[51:25] time I just go into this but his fluence
[51:28] so I want us to understand something no
[51:30] and that is why it is important I am
[51:34] here tonight as a servant
[51:37] that is how I see my role tonight
[51:39] because the prophet of God hallelujah
[51:42] sent a message out for what we supposed
[51:45] to do and many of us we hear what he's
[51:48] supposed to do but we have not done it
[51:49] because of pride because of what we
[51:52] think we know because of what we think
[51:54] we understand but it took servants who
[51:59] had a love for naman to say boss father
[52:03] brother leader of course we come too far
[52:07] to go back now let me go all you either
[52:09] let me go on dip now we can we come in
[52:11] with you become a Mitchell everyone do
[52:13] this thing because we are going back if
[52:15] this market already got here why are you
[52:17] going back I sell it to the young people
[52:19] before friends as carrier Ando bringing
[52:21] back these were not regular servants
[52:26] these were subin's with distinction
[52:28] servants with class service
[52:35] similar to the men who carried a man
[52:38] with palsy and carried him up the roof
[52:40] when Jesus was there
[52:43] he couldn't go himself but their love
[52:46] for him carried him namin had reached
[52:49] that far and he reached a spot that he
[52:51] couldn't go further so whether it's a
[52:54] friend to you or somebody was under your
[52:57] level or somebody who might guess the
[52:58] impasse who say keep pressing brother
[53:01] hold on to that keep pressing brother
[53:03] keep pressing system because that
[53:05] encouragement is priceless for you to go
[53:08] all the way anybody with me that tonight
[53:11] I'm hoping I've taken too much time
[53:13] alone Bible study then he went down and
[53:18] dipped himself we had verse 14 then when
[53:21] he don't and dipped himself seven times
[53:24] in Jordan where the Branham said I could
[53:30] see him walking out there by pulling his
[53:32] feet out of mud like a tomcat in
[53:35] molasses you know buddy Branham and he
[53:36] prophetic eyes seeing him playing in
[53:39] front of him you know Walker there I
[53:41] guess I have to do it he's speaking like
[53:43] it I guess I have to do it
[53:44] dog dong it'll hit his prestige he
[53:47] saying dog he come back up
[53:48] he still had leprosy hallelujah he
[53:51] prophet said seven times but after he
[53:54] had done seven times his skin come to
[53:56] him clean again hallelujah and berry man
[53:59] said brother I'm telling you some people
[54:01] say I don't believe I have to get to the
[54:03] altar and boohoo and cry around snot or
[54:06] like the rest of them do stay back there
[54:08] then but I'll take away with a lord
[54:10] despise few started towards Jesus know
[54:14] this verse 14 which says and then he
[54:18] went known and dipped himself seven
[54:20] times in Jordan according to the saying
[54:23] of the man of God and his flesh him
[54:26] again like unto the flesh of a little
[54:29] child and he was clean my god they were
[54:33] all battle-scarred veteran and when he
[54:36] did God at His Word and he think the man
[54:38] of God's wood and he took action on the
[54:41] man of God's wood as he prophesied it
[54:43] was something to do that he had to
[54:45] follow somebody Branham in friction
[54:47] about this brought the type of Jesus
[54:50] remember when Jesus had these situations
[54:52] he was a blind man and he takes some
[54:54] dust on he's spitting in Europe he said
[54:55] Jesus didn't have to do
[54:57] it was just something to do it's
[55:01] something to do God has a way here do
[55:03] things in different way means these
[55:06] people can't tie these seven and he
[55:08] could type walk and I think but I bet
[55:09] him saying it is simple this God is
[55:11] really simple it was just obedience the
[55:14] new word of the man of God and the word
[55:17] of this prophet and once he did it you
[55:19] get in skin like a child it is skin like
[55:23] a baby and the church semen and he
[55:27] returned the telling man of God he and
[55:30] all of his company and came and stood
[55:32] before him so now that he was screamed
[55:34] he now has earned the distinction of
[55:37] standing before him Adam god I don't
[55:39] know why he might have Gordon want to
[55:40] see him as every man a girl say see this
[55:42] leprosy thing
[55:43] ideally without telling well fix that
[55:45] and then ready but now the relationship
[55:47] has changed
[55:49] hallelujah powerful Villa and he
[55:52] returned to the man of God he and all of
[55:54] his company and came and stood before
[55:57] him and he said Behold no I know that
[56:01] there is no God in all the earth
[56:04] but in Israel hallelujah no dear for I
[56:07] pretty now this is where is it
[56:09] interesting take a blessing of thy
[56:12] servant
[56:15] no there's so much teaching in this rain
[56:19] so you remember he came with ten change
[56:24] of clothes ten nice pinstripe suits
[56:27] Paloma de it was ten garments it was
[56:30] syllable I'm cool he come with all this
[56:32] thing I mean he thought he was gonna pay
[56:35] for this thing he took me one PF is
[56:36] healing he saw that it was a price that
[56:38] he can pee he thought that that doors of
[56:40] course he didn't know how much the cost
[56:42] was so he walked with extra we go when
[56:44] you want to buy something you will bring
[56:46] enough that he could peer fit and if you
[56:49] do any price you need to bring more than
[56:50] enough just in case the guy a high price
[56:52] so he's feeling good about himself but
[56:56] this is a Gentile a heathen as it would
[56:59] who is no getting introduced to this new
[57:01] kind of love because he don't understand
[57:03] what is working here and he teaching
[57:05] that is going on here so he doing what
[57:06] anybody who is transactional in nature
[57:09] is thinking he said he said he said take
[57:12] a blessing of thy servant take a
[57:14] blessing I feel I'm good o go and if yes
[57:17] what's gonna look this good take a
[57:18] blessing but Elijah responds he said as
[57:22] the Lord liveth
[57:23] before whom I stand I will see received
[57:26] none he urged him to take it and Elijah
[57:30] refused again and naman said
[57:37] shall then not then I prayed he be given
[57:39] to thy servant two mules burden of it
[57:41] but I serve as well hence what order
[57:44] offer need a boon offering or sacrifice
[57:46] unto other gods but unto the Lord so I
[57:48] want to I want to read that in a
[57:50] different translation but sometimes when
[57:52] people read as they get a little
[57:53] confused right so what are you seeing
[57:56] here this is we are now interval 17
[58:00] so when he is urging Elijah the chicken
[58:04] he likes with the name and said if not
[58:05] please let there be given to your
[58:07] servant to mule loads up to it
[58:10] so in other words he said give me
[58:14] something for from no one your servant
[58:16] will not offer burnt offering or
[58:18] sacrifice to any God but the Lord in
[58:21] this matter and he goes on in this thing
[58:25] the Lord played and I servant that when
[58:28] my master goeth into the house of Rahman
[58:31] so in other words he an image going to
[58:36] our transition he's saying listen I have
[58:38] duties when my master he's feeling
[58:41] mighty king the Syrian King God in every
[58:43] house of women to worship there and he
[58:46] leaned it on my hand and that's why
[58:48] that's why Mary points that when the
[58:51] servant girl brought up the prophet of
[58:54] Samaria who is Elijah it was not just a
[58:57] captain who was a military captain but
[59:00] this was the captain who would go with
[59:02] the King to their idol worship God
[59:06] so nehemiah is trying to not protect
[59:09] himself because he has gone through an
[59:10] experience that he no knows there's no
[59:13] good from his own words outside of the
[59:15] God of Israel even in this thing the
[59:17] Lord pardon a silver and when my master
[59:19] going into the house of Rahman to
[59:21] worship there and he leaned it on my
[59:23] hand in other words I am going off with
[59:25] him he leaning on my hand and I bought
[59:27] myself in the house of women when I
[59:29] bought on myself in the house of him and
[59:30] the Lord cried and I silver in this
[59:32] thing this is deep we can't go into all
[59:36] of it no but Elijah said unto him go in
[59:40] peace so he departed from him in a
[59:43] little we know this
[59:51] here in second Kings five is a message
[59:54] about uncovering things much more much
[59:58] more time here at understand ephemera so
[1:00:01] it's about uncovering things so you have
[1:00:02] a case of Nieman who would have been
[1:00:04] living in some level of hiding now
[1:00:06] having to come and confront what he had
[1:00:09] been hiding which was his leprosy
[1:00:11] well we have this situation now similar
[1:00:15] to the prodigal son so you have the
[1:00:20] prodigal son who leaves his home with
[1:00:22] his money and he displays what's in him
[1:00:25] and his display gets him into trouble he
[1:00:30] comes back home but his return home as
[1:00:33] it were is what brings out what was in
[1:00:36] the other brothers hat that was hiding
[1:00:39] there all along it's a type of
[1:00:41] situations that come in your life to
[1:00:44] reveal what's inside of your heart so in
[1:00:49] verse 20 but G huzi he servant of Elijah
[1:00:53] the man of God said Behold my Massa had
[1:00:57] speared him and Assyrian it not
[1:00:59] receiving at his hands that which he
[1:01:02] brought but as the Lord liveth I will
[1:01:04] run after him and take somewhat of him
[1:01:08] so here now we have a rogue officer
[1:01:13] this is Elijah make clear his position
[1:01:18] but we have a rogue officer now I wrote
[1:01:24] down proximity to spiritual leaders
[1:01:27] doesn't help your character however in
[1:01:29] my notes because you would think better
[1:01:32] parents
[1:01:33] you would think were Thomson that jay-z
[1:01:35] next to Elijah he will behave yourself
[1:01:39] this is not the beginning of Elijah's
[1:01:41] ministry he has seen enough he would
[1:01:45] know of Elijah's Ministry of the mantle
[1:01:47] and felony life so he know enough to
[1:01:49] behave himself but in his hat he also
[1:01:52] has leprosy we start with natural
[1:01:58] leprosy in this passage every reading
[1:02:01] and now is at the uncover a stench right
[1:02:06] in Elijah's house that natural leprosy
[1:02:10] opened up into the identification so to
[1:02:14] speak of spiritual leprosy
[1:02:17] look at this rogue officer but she has
[1:02:21] any servant of Elijah the man of God
[1:02:24] said behold my master had spared name
[1:02:27] and this Syrian defender he see in this
[1:02:31] Syrian itself is he trying to chuck
[1:02:34] wooden fire each other you know he's a
[1:02:37] man come with all his gold all his
[1:02:39] silver 10 costume tonight suit I love a
[1:02:42] good suit look at them suit and my my
[1:02:44] say even take a suit yeah I take a shirt
[1:02:46] yeah I think I've sucks in not receiving
[1:02:51] Ares and that which he brought but I see
[1:02:52] Lord liveth he actually to speak and
[1:02:55] include gory me corruption as he learned
[1:02:58] live it I will run after him and take
[1:03:00] somewhat of him he just won't anything
[1:03:03] so Jay has him followed after Nieman and
[1:03:06] when Nieman saw him running after him he
[1:03:09] lighted down from the chariot to meet
[1:03:11] him and said it's all well is everything
[1:03:14] cool is everything ok I see you running
[1:03:16] reckless reckless I saw you there he
[1:03:18] lied shows host something happen because
[1:03:20] I'll even enjoy a co running what what
[1:03:23] what what what can I do for you so not
[1:03:26] only is the leprosy in his hat but is a
[1:03:29] lyin thievin we get any full in full
[1:03:34] stanchion alright
[1:03:36] and he said all is well all is not well
[1:03:40] its corruption Airy heart supplying all
[1:03:43] is not well my master had sent me line
[1:03:47] number two line number one all as well
[1:03:49] first life line number two my master had
[1:03:53] sent me saying you must have didn't say
[1:03:56] Nia line I'm a tree what he said behold
[1:03:59] even now they become to me from mount
[1:04:04] ephraim to a young men of his sons of
[1:04:07] the prophets
[1:04:10] give them I pray thee a talent of silver
[1:04:13] and two cheetahs of diamonds so this way
[1:04:15] lion on top a lion not only learn a
[1:04:17] double life he's fine - boys : Suns re
[1:04:22] profits bring them up there I'm a man
[1:04:26] said be content don't take one he actual
[1:04:29] wanna he's actually a talent singular
[1:04:32] name honesty rejoicing Easterlin Reviver
[1:04:35] he still in Jubilee he said oh just take
[1:04:37] one talent he said take two towers no
[1:04:40] one's a double portion and he urged him
[1:04:43] and brung two talents of silver in two
[1:04:45] bags with two changes of garments and
[1:04:48] laid them upon two of his servants and
[1:04:51] they bare them before him these two
[1:04:54] servants is two boys that Joe has a ring
[1:04:58] on the wings and pretend to be son
[1:05:01] through three prophets no bearing
[1:05:04] managed as if it is slick this is all
[1:05:06] scripture such as he said air receive
[1:05:09] anything them boys collect it and when
[1:05:12] he came to the tower he took it he took
[1:05:14] them from their hand so when he was out
[1:05:17] of sight of pigment is when he relieved
[1:05:20] these two young actors of the gifts that
[1:05:23] they lie to get
[1:05:27] and be stored them in the house so he
[1:05:31] put it away similar to a Cohen puttin
[1:05:34] his stuff away and he led the men go and
[1:05:38] they departed we almost done but he went
[1:05:42] in and stood before his master and
[1:05:44] Elijah said unto Him whence cometh thou
[1:05:47] has he
[1:05:47] I don't always realize this because he
[1:05:50] had been lying up online a stop comes in
[1:05:52] and he said die someone went know
[1:05:54] whether I went no way you see the effect
[1:06:00] of spiritual leprosy known that he would
[1:06:03] stand this is not standing in front of a
[1:06:05] teacher and evangelist is not an apostle
[1:06:07] this is not even a prophet with
[1:06:09] inequality revival ministry this is
[1:06:11] stand in front of a major profit and the
[1:06:15] major prophet who has divine insight
[1:06:18] into the mine and his sight of God you
[1:06:21] come and lie and say I doing anything
[1:06:24] and he said unto Him which is Elijah
[1:06:30] speaking I went not mynhardt with me
[1:06:32] when the man turn again from his chariot
[1:06:35] of MIDI is it a time to receive money
[1:06:38] and to receive garments and Olivia's and
[1:06:41] vineyards and sheep and oxen and men
[1:06:43] Subin and meat servants and listen now
[1:06:46] what is on the inside and is the point I
[1:06:48] want to get to what is on the inside
[1:06:51] comes on the outside and full circle
[1:06:56] this is one of the few scriptures if any
[1:06:58] that ends with these element of what
[1:07:03] began the story the leprosy therefore of
[1:07:06] Niemann shall cleave unto thee and under
[1:07:10] thy seed for ever and he went out from
[1:07:14] his presence a leper as white as snow
[1:07:21] end of chapter powerful lesson that I
[1:07:28] want you to study it think about it
[1:07:31] ponder reflect on it he P enough a man
[1:07:35] in leadership what he was hiding his
[1:07:41] journey for deliverance and how his
[1:07:44] situation and and that is why many times
[1:07:47] people around you get blessed again
[1:07:50] deliver them and things to in people's
[1:07:53] hearts you have to be careful friends
[1:07:57] yet to be very very careful so to bring
[1:08:00] this to a close I identified four
[1:08:07] questions so to speak
[1:08:10] that I wanted to take from this teaching
[1:08:12] first critical question how desperate
[1:08:16] are you for deliverance your desperation
[1:08:21] for deliverance is directly correlated
[1:08:23] with your obedience because if you
[1:08:26] really want to be delivered you have to
[1:08:28] have a willingness to obey the Word of
[1:08:29] God subject yourself to you would have
[1:08:32] good not to your thoughts because naman
[1:08:36] was clay and how he taught it will be I
[1:08:38] told his survey should be like this I
[1:08:39] thought he Prem attention good idea I
[1:08:41] told we should have two services one any
[1:08:43] morning I told this person should preach
[1:08:44] I thought he should come and spread his
[1:08:46] hand he didn't find evenly movement
[1:08:48] Shirley come up to me and stand up
[1:08:50] calling him a lord and strike his hand
[1:08:52] over the place all of that is happening
[1:08:56] there
[1:08:58] subjecting yourself not to your thoughts
[1:09:01] not to how you think it should be but to
[1:09:04] OB these simple instruction of the Lord
[1:09:07] means a lesson number two can you take
[1:09:10] advice from people who may not be at
[1:09:14] your level powerful teaching
[1:09:18] because Neiman has to thank God for the
[1:09:23] servants around him who had his best
[1:09:26] interest at heart because like I said it
[1:09:29] was not Elijah that pushed Neiman to
[1:09:33] Jordan it was his servants who and I
[1:09:37] want us to see this now it is a parallel
[1:09:39] so to speak of the world is coming and
[1:09:42] and the Bible was very clear man of God
[1:09:44] man a good man a good man of God so the
[1:09:46] man of God spoke his servant his
[1:09:48] messenger brought it out to Elijah so
[1:09:52] it's a third naman sorry naman goes away
[1:09:54] but he company you keep can have an
[1:09:59] influence on what you do when you were
[1:10:01] you here let me see it again never went
[1:10:06] to get a word your word came to him he
[1:10:10] didn't like who preached that Sunday he
[1:10:13] liked who gave it as the money he didn't
[1:10:16] like it was a table was life but he
[1:10:18] weren't came to him he got questioned
[1:10:20] would it was the word that came to him
[1:10:22] the medium of how the world was
[1:10:24] presented to him was not to his
[1:10:26] expectation nor that he received the
[1:10:28] message the way he should have received
[1:10:31] but it is important friends the company
[1:10:34] you keep
[1:10:35] especially after hearing you would it is
[1:10:38] important accompany you keep you have to
[1:10:41] know and I would have set aside young
[1:10:42] people years ago you have to separate
[1:10:44] friends from associates they're people
[1:10:48] you are so seed with on your job
[1:10:50] we take advice many times from the wrong
[1:10:52] people
[1:10:53] we take advice from the wrong people but
[1:10:57] you have to be to take advice from the
[1:10:59] right people and it takes spiritual
[1:11:01] wisdom to understand it it takes a deep
[1:11:03] and it takes humility to do that and I
[1:11:06] thank God that naman was able to reach
[1:11:09] that spot where his servants would be
[1:11:11] ones so India talk afterwards boss you
[1:11:14] have to use your father a little more
[1:11:16] respect father or garage if the Prophet
[1:11:19] had did be do some grating who are
[1:11:22] appropriate and do something you want to
[1:11:23] do it but no you have to go and do this
[1:11:25] simple thing thing take it was that talk
[1:11:29] afterwards so what we have in here
[1:11:32] tonight is to also it's like we having a
[1:11:34] conversation to help us process the word
[1:11:38] process scripture see how it applies our
[1:11:40] normal living and beyond that when you
[1:11:43] come to church when your your-your-your
[1:11:45] see a service spend time talking about a
[1:11:48] wood many time better balancing it with
[1:11:50] their fellowship or the body service
[1:11:52] people and the holy sprit drop don't see
[1:11:54] quad is pleased when I talk about him
[1:11:56] can you change the same man point number
[1:11:59] three this is how I wrote it brother
[1:12:00] open proximity the spiritual leaders
[1:12:04] does not change your character
[1:12:07] jaha's 'i live in an elijah house and he
[1:12:14] have spiritual leprosy
[1:12:17] he has greed in his heart
[1:12:19] he is lying in his heart and the same
[1:12:23] way that Neiman may have been hiding
[1:12:25] what he had externally
[1:12:27] jaha's II would have been relatively
[1:12:30] successful hiding what he had internally
[1:12:37] until the situation came to reveal what
[1:12:41] was in his heart
[1:12:44] sadly what was in his hat as a spiritual
[1:12:47] problem and they're being manifested as
[1:12:51] a physical problem manifested externally
[1:12:55] as well and underlying all of that
[1:12:58] it's to say this has been a Branham
[1:13:01] tortoise full obedience to the entire
[1:13:04] Word of God entitles us to the token
[1:13:09] ultimately because even in the case of
[1:13:12] Johansen
[1:13:13] Elijah made clear how he wanted a treat
[1:13:17] with the matter when Neiman tried to
[1:13:21] give the gift more than once he refused
[1:13:25] it basically that instruction and and I
[1:13:29] and I say this really really clear it's
[1:13:31] one body so gone crisis he had everybody
[1:13:35] he body car do I want to do hand ship
[1:13:38] defines the structure of the
[1:13:40] organization so within the spiritual
[1:13:44] context saying he is the head of the
[1:13:46] body and that's why but Urbana will say
[1:13:47] no is a lack of revelation that brings
[1:13:50] the division because if you have a
[1:13:52] revelation of the structure and in
[1:13:54] nature of the pose everybody then saying
[1:13:58] that source of a sovereign church don't
[1:14:01] mean you're doing what you want any way
[1:14:02] you want it
[1:14:04] I'm hitting something something
[1:14:06] something some things here because there
[1:14:09] has to be a discipline to do wood there
[1:14:12] has to be a level of obedience to order
[1:14:15] and I will DSA this the message has some
[1:14:18] of the most in discipline Christians you
[1:14:20] can find
[1:14:23] message churches lack discipline they
[1:14:27] are entitled they believe because they
[1:14:30] were blessed to have access to this
[1:14:33] prophetic message they could do whatever
[1:14:34] I want and get away with it and they
[1:14:36] live you way limited I thought I thought
[1:14:38] I thought and interestingly when outed
[1:14:41] being said that way jaha's he thought he
[1:14:44] was doing the right thing you know even
[1:14:46] so much that he wanted to say as the
[1:14:48] Lord liveth
[1:14:51] and these are words that Elijah would
[1:14:53] have used as the Lord loved it
[1:14:54] this man can go without being lack of
[1:14:58] discipline if he was a disciplined
[1:15:01] servant in Elijah's house he would have
[1:15:03] told align and respect the decision that
[1:15:06] Elijah had mean
[1:15:09] I want to get that if he was a
[1:15:12] discipline if he understood when I
[1:15:14] beated a shout shout when I bid either
[1:15:16] sit sit when I built a stands done this
[1:15:20] problem he feeis was simply one of lack
[1:15:23] of discipline the more I see it and I
[1:15:25] see it trust me with any spiritual armor
[1:15:28] to be natural around this simple virus
[1:15:30] that we be showing what people have in
[1:15:33] them showing what stuff in them
[1:15:38] can the church say me anybody with me we
[1:15:41] could talk for hours on this thing
[1:15:43] enough but mighty Ziya is out of this
[1:15:46] because in the case of lehman he was
[1:15:48] brought in to discipline being brought
[1:15:52] into discipline brought him into
[1:15:54] humility and obedience to follow
[1:15:57] instructions and as a church as the
[1:16:00] people what anybody say they did only
[1:16:02] what he told him to do they only said
[1:16:04] what you want him to see they say what
[1:16:09] he said only keep still that's
[1:16:10] discipline you Han want to go this way
[1:16:13] you were you're feeling led
[1:16:16] but abandom times in the upper room
[1:16:19] people feel in lead did Peter say shut
[1:16:21] up and sit down until empower come you
[1:16:23] can't get inspired Akaya you you feel
[1:16:25] and sing ish you feelin sing as you feel
[1:16:29] impeaches you feel like place you wanna
[1:16:33] do what you wanna do because i thought
[1:16:35] that this is how it's supposed to be
[1:16:37] discipline discipline of the word
[1:16:41] obedience I'm gonna brendham said it and
[1:16:44] we are clear the token is the thing is
[1:16:46] he thing is not he teaching is not
[1:16:48] induction is that Waverly is the token
[1:16:50] has to be explained and the condition to
[1:16:53] get it token is full obedience this
[1:16:56] teaching is a teaching on obedience and
[1:16:58] it unveils the benefits of obedience and
[1:17:01] a lack of obedience in the case of name
[1:17:04] and he came into obedience in the case
[1:17:06] of jaha's II he walked out from listen
[1:17:09] you know what it is to live in the house
[1:17:11] of a major profit think about it
[1:17:16] process that visitor living in in in in
[1:17:19] a in a mayor house or a policeman host
[1:17:22] or or this is the house of a major
[1:17:24] profit in them
[1:17:26] not only that you have no this is not
[1:17:29] this is not a man who have prompted any
[1:17:31] business Canada
[1:17:33] you just have a man who came and leprosy
[1:17:36] leave healed so you know God is working
[1:17:39] and you after that still want to do your
[1:17:42] own thing you know what it meant it
[1:17:47] meant just as he didn't really ever
[1:17:48] expect with your fish you know because
[1:17:52] it meant that despite the magnitude of
[1:17:55] Elijah's ministry Joe has he still felt
[1:17:58] he no better go help us process that for
[1:18:02] a minute it meant because if you see a
[1:18:07] man he loved what in that day was an
[1:18:10] incurable disease here in front of your
[1:18:12] eyes so yeah no question the ministry
[1:18:16] you don't question he spurred us out of
[1:18:18] things but what was actually the in
[1:18:20] question was administration oh god help
[1:18:24] us tonight the question was not if
[1:18:29] Elijah should open the door for his
[1:18:32] healing the question now was I don't
[1:18:35] think he likes her maybe right call on
[1:18:37] how to administer this matter and jaha's
[1:18:44] he took upon himself authority he did
[1:18:46] not have and he paid a price for it
[1:18:49] similar to King Uzziah going into the
[1:18:52] temple when it was not his place to go
[1:18:54] into the temple presuming but around him
[1:18:57] speaks about presuming taking authority
[1:18:59] is not your authority
[1:19:00] all of this speaks to discipline and I
[1:19:03] heard a brother said in one of our our
[1:19:05] meetings this church had some tabernacle
[1:19:08] we don't take no playbook from no other
[1:19:11] Church give me the scripture
[1:19:13] give me the prophets message and in
[1:19:16] there has every key we need to do things
[1:19:19] the way God wants us to do it I cannot
[1:19:22] exhaust we talking over all on one
[1:19:25] chapter you know what chapters that have
[1:19:28] in this book you know much service we
[1:19:30] have to have to even get to this thing
[1:19:33] we cannot exhaust it and the more you
[1:19:36] spend time in you would anywhere becomes
[1:19:38] a passion for you and you
[1:19:40] recognize that all things pertaining to
[1:19:42] life and godliness is in the scripture
[1:19:45] and brother branham's ministry and his
[1:19:47] message was the same light on the
[1:19:50] scripture so we could open this book and
[1:19:52] see with clarity and that's why we're
[1:19:54] ready quotes from the Prophet so you can
[1:19:56] see here just it as well and brought the
[1:19:58] types of receiving Allah knows how to
[1:20:01] get you all he goes you can't get
[1:20:02] anywhere you want it you got think about
[1:20:04] how to get it you can get in your own
[1:20:05] way there's a way to get it there's a
[1:20:07] way to healing there's a weak but a
[1:20:09] better pitch approach to God hallelujah
[1:20:11] it's all of these things it's an
[1:20:14] approach to what a way of doing things a
[1:20:16] way of operating and the question is as
[1:20:20] I get ready to close and we just close
[1:20:21] up in prayer hope I didn't take up too
[1:20:23] much of your time but let's get excited
[1:20:25] with when you see mine or you should
[1:20:27] know that I in a groove here but the
[1:20:32] Bible is used to be your life your sauce
[1:20:34] I don't want to make these mistakes I
[1:20:36] want to be the kind of leader who I can
[1:20:40] listen to anybody and think of I
[1:20:42] civilizer boy taken you come to father
[1:20:44] and I want to be that kind of leader and
[1:20:47] we are all called to be leaders so let
[1:20:49] me copy the code to be followers for you
[1:20:53] to swim against the current abide
[1:20:55] abandon brought you have to be able to
[1:20:57] make decisions that advance your
[1:21:00] spiritual trajectory and anything here
[1:21:03] like that before but you have to take an
[1:21:05] interest in advancing your spiritual
[1:21:07] trajectory and it seemed like God wants
[1:21:09] you to make decisions to advance every
[1:21:11] area of your life so you can be a
[1:21:13] complete Christian all things but in to
[1:21:16] life and godliness
[1:21:19] so in closing mediocrity substandard
[1:21:23] half waiting do anything more you want
[1:21:26] you do we don't know if your company
[1:21:28] you're going to create just in
[1:21:29] discipline that's why I love the army
[1:21:32] and I mean say with the army of the Lord
[1:21:33] and your actual post of duty whether
[1:21:35] your post of duty is in this room your
[1:21:37] posted it is on your live stream and
[1:21:39] they have an approach to how yeah yeah
[1:21:40] yes yeah wake up on Sunday and yeah
[1:21:43] community that's plenty like sheer lying
[1:21:44] on your bed and here for you that is
[1:21:47] that is approach to God oh come on now
[1:21:50] inside your house tonight
[1:21:53] you have to have an attitude that shows
[1:21:56] you really mean business about this
[1:21:58] because if you don't mean business about
[1:22:00] God God will not mean business with you
[1:22:03] God shrewd it out there
[1:22:06] dip seven times you couldn't do it six
[1:22:07] times you couldn't do it fight that you
[1:22:09] couldn't do it three time you do it how
[1:22:11] he said to do it and watch the blessing
[1:22:13] for can we bow our heads for a word of
[1:22:15] Prayer
[1:22:16] our gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[1:22:19] you tonight Lord for these few broken up
[1:22:22] words Lord to inspire and encourage your
[1:22:27] people father and Lord this one chapter
[1:22:32] that we spend this over an hour just
