hoping enjoy the service last Sunday what is your name what a message and our Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he refused the world refused all the offers that could be offered to him to gain something greater and better and in life there will be always offers in front of you and the choices that you take and decisions that you make you will see the fruit of that Pharaoh look and see madhavan's fear Allah can see people that were hungry and struggling and slaves but when Moses saw those very same people through the same window that Pharaoh saw Moses saw the people of God sometimes they may look like mud daubers they may look like nobodies they make like trodden and despise and so on but look again be careful you're looking at the people of God hallelujah everything might be right with Jacob but he had a heart for the boot right he wasn't right but he wanted the boot right and because he had a desire for the bird right God God God loved him he loved him and he knew he was going to be changed and God loved you God knew that you are going to be changed that's why you are here this morning you are not going to stay as you are you're not but to

something beautiful out of it yes yes yes there was chaos in the beginning darkness cover the earth but then God said let there be light and God went down into the chaos and God brought a beautiful thought of it so don't tell me God can take something beautiful over you don't tell me about you what is your name Jacob what's always Israel is that was in him he was always a sheet up as a temporary

daughters Zoe and Tameka they're here and so I feel a little at home amen so then you wouldn't be upset with me if we finish at 4:00 I'm just kidding anyway it's just about ten months government's I was here and I've had the pleasure to be back here again doing a little vacation with my Tamika and some opportunity for me to fellowship with you and to express to you what God is doing for us in Grenada you have your Minister here he's full of food full of God's grace so I can bring you nothing that you don't already have but I can tell you what God is doing for us on the other side and I can by sharing my testimony maybe you could identify and say well it's the same card there is the same gone here as the God in the value it's the same God in the mountain not another God the same God and therefore we use that opportunity to come and share with you what God is doing for us we don't further do we want to go to the word internal violence to first Kings 19 and read him from verse 1 to 9 when you get its amen and by the way let me the lady that sang that song was really inspirational middle Oh bless you amen and Ahab is read me the Lord blessed with two hearts and a have told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword you can join with me tree thence Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the guards do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to Bathsheba which belonged to Judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down on the juniper tree and requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now O Lord take away my life for I am NOT better than my father's and he lay and slept under a juniper tree and behold then an angel touch him and said unto Him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake Baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee any rolls and delete and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights on to Horeb the Mount of God and he came today into a cave and Lodge there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and said unto Him what doest thou here Elijah may the Lord bless thy readin and then we go to chapter 2 reading from this one amen can you read with me and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly they came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance and and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold and not all these which speak galilaeans and how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born and then finally we go back to Luke chapter 6 read in verse 12 amen and it came to pass in those days he's talking about Jesus that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night and pray to God this is one of the most amazing Scripture the Jesus in whom 12 God spent the whole night talking to God made a lot less the reason to our hearts you can have your seats if you don't mind I can um probably notice message what here is Dow Elijah I was doing a little quote from it now Elijah had just completed a great victory in Mon common and God had been prepared at him brother Branham was saying that God was preparing him and then he said I was listening to brother David to Bridget who was seen what a Ministry of the supernatural meant no one knows unless you have to go true with it what it means and people think as a prophet speaking that I am a isolationists because I am NOT out amongst the people but it isn't because I don't like people I love the people but I cannot be a servant of God and a servant of the people at the same time I must keep myself before God so that I can serve his people so all this is true for also the true servants of God I believe that no minister of the gospel has any business out in social gatherings and this is brother Branham speaking to us ordinates before he goes into the pulpit those are sacred grounds if he does then he comes to the pulpit on fit and on anointing and when a man is on anointed he is unable to hear clearly from God what God wants the people to hear amen I think a minister should lay in the presence of God listen carefully no remember I'm not very good of it and I tend to go a little this is what God has played on my heart to go a little deeper and I like going T and the song the lady sang she says she wants to go higher so it is not by chance he sang a song to coincide with the message I want to go deep and not that you don't go deep but I just want us to go a little deeper amen and I think that's what God wants his children to do because we are supposed to be identified with the dynamics we have the mechanics but the dynamics wouldn't work by itself it has to hit the diner mechanics and then Gore has to do something to get the two of them to work it's like when you have a chemistry are you doing in lab and you have the oxygen and the hydrogen if you want water you can leave them separate h2o you have to join the edge with the to undergo if you want water otherwise it remains h2o correct so what good is good to have the edge I'm thirsty you are thirsty I have the edge I have the two and I have the oh but I need water since when you put them together then the water comes and we have to understand that we have the dynamics which is in the spirit and you have the word but you gotta get join the two together and we have to find out how to do that because the back where the Brenham didn't see when you get he said when you get to know who you are so whatever it is it's here what we just get has to get to know because if you don't get to know it will remain like that and then we can't blame God if the rapture is taken long are you follow me because God has already identified and sent you everything but it's taking us longer to know where the h2o is so that we could join them together because once you join them together is gonna flow amen then the Lateran and the former rain becomes wandering amen so it's not something God has to do again it's already here we just have to connect to be able to see it but then he says when you get to know who you are so if I don't know who I am then I'm trying to find out and if you don't know who you are then you're trying to find out and if the spirit is there he would leave you to who you are in da right alright so let's go back here as you take a literary because I don't all right where am i all right so you need to lay in the presence of God in his she kind of glory know the word Shekinah is a given name in Hebrew and it means God's manifested presence or his dwelling place amen and by the way that my subject this morning is under the juniper tree into his Shekinah glory and the text is meeting with God so I want you to follow this so he says lay in the God in the presence of God and she kinda means gods manifested presence all his dwelling place so after laying in his dwelling place the minister thereafter walks out before the congregation and tells the people what the Holy Spirit wants to be told to them this did Elijah and for the purpose of clarity Elijah here types the church so this lean and the presence is not only for the minister it types the church see we want to get stuff but we don't want to lay and you're not gonna do it by your intellectuals because that's that's failed already denomination that's what they work of it the bride has to go deeper you can use mental faith to get things that you need amen alright so you have to lay in his presence amen and that's the hard work lean in his presence oh we want a lot of things from God but look I don't have time to Lee and it wouldn't work because you cannot tell God how you want to get what he told you that you're gonna get you have to go his way the word wing and we are so busy that we don't want to like not on I'm willing to sleep I'm talking about laying in his presence and that's where the church is failing we want all the miracles we want all the signs and we want to speak tenders and everything else but we are not prepared to lay dead speak now if I speak just not gonna you're not gonna have any Ripple but if God speaks you go back amen but you have to live in his presence amen all right he said did you with the parents saying did you ever notice after the wickedness of the night has settled down and you walk out into the morning real early into the stillness and quietness of the dawn where the drew has brought the freshness the fragrance of the flowers oh what an atmosphere what it's the same when you can come out of a room of prayer so that God sorry so that you could come out of a room of prayer where you will lay in his presence and you come out fresh many times we come out stale because we didn't I and I cannot eat stale food now I don't know what you're in Trinidad but in Grenada we cannot eat stale food because it's not our custom the fruits and the trees are all over the place so we would rather go and eat mango then eat stale food now I know you keep quiet and I hope I'm not touching your toes but we write we write when it's fresh it goes down easier amen so when it's fresh it's good are you hurting me when you're in the presence of God lean in his presence and you walk out you're fresh and that's your revival right now amen glory so we can't eat something that's been gone long ago we ask why you come every day to hear the word otherwise we're just gonna - you could stay home and just play the tape but why you think that's not enough you need to get that fresh kill simple what we killing it all the time and every time you kill it you see something new and that's what you waiting on and one of these things is gonna break one of the cells is gonna unfold and it's gonna let loose an explosion but we gotta do the first part we have to connect the what h2o all right so God has been preparing Elijah and remember lighter types of church for a great outstanding miracle there you go and he had called all Israel together and he thought surely if Israel could see the supernatural hand of God on display then they would believe that God was truly God and they worship would be to him just imagine and I want you to think about this because he lighter is thinking if they see the supernatural then his journey is over his book is released if they see the supernatural that's his thinking and that's your thinking and I write glory Lord God but just imagine that it took five hundred and eighty five years from the time Egypt with your came out of Egypt to the time Elijah is doing this montano Montcalm our showdown I must remember to take my time and speak because I'm the home alright it's five hundred and eighty five years since the Great and notable miracles in Egypt and it's not like that don't know it's in the book it's in the books that you don't read anymore it's in the books amen we don't you know people hadn't listened to you have you ever going on believe us home and you don't hear the Prophet preaching anymore Oh in the early days we usually have it having preaching morning noon or night but something happened between then and now now you heard me don't get quiet something happened between then and now is it because you have all the books in your head because every time you listen to the Prophet there's something new every time you come here there's something new so when you shut it off you're shutting off the fragrance you're shutting off the freshness and yet you wanna smell sweet how's that gonna work [Applause] [Music] it's not gonna work like that in Grenada there's something called a cowboy back Co boy bat means you don't wander the show you just kind of wet certain parts and then you dry and you're gone and to make up for what the soap enriched you spray Cologne and that Cologne you hope is gonna take care of all the stench right then of course you don't do that it's raining out you don't do coke boy bites you do the real thing but it had home yeah there's something call a cowboy but you're just going out pick and you make sure you have a big bottle of cologne and you probably use about five when you mix it up then it's supposed to be good but it'd be so after an hour here comes the real set and then you know is it me hey you follow me and I'm trying to say that if you shut off the tapes and you shut up the books you can do like you're taking a cowboy back I don't have to go further so after five hundred and eighty-five years since the Great and notable miracles in Egypt on the Moses when God had so powerfully displayed the supernatural here once again as they did in Egypt Israel was once more sliding down into pale worship how does that work we've seen the supernatural you've seen God do great things pop the waters and 585 years we just have 60 70 years next day won't be 70 years in all right next year Israel is going to be 70 years and all those people who were born at that time they look they're supposed to not die until they see the Messiah we are here since we became a nation she'll be something in 2018 and Jesus said that this generation shall not pass away until all the things that I've told you which is the three questions is fulfill and it's gonna take us on a ways if we don't connect the edge to all so we have to understand that while you're going along and everything things are happening it may not be happening in your house but it's happening we not be happening in your life but it's happening and you ain't gonna stop it you got to get with the program or the program is going to leave you out you got to come in his presence you're gonna turn it back on the thing that brought you is the thing that's gonna deposit you whatever started you is going all the way you can change it that's why the wife you started with is the one you go to the end you can change meet with mid wiki so well honey you know I think it's the way you get off it don't work so you wanna get quiet hope I'm not touching so I get here when you get quiet is not to speak of all those things alright so so the hair that were torn between the worship of God and bear they were constantly driven back and forth between the ways they had picked up in Egypt and the Word of God sent to them by the prophets they were not able to hear God's voice anymore the priests of Jezebel and it's prophet seems to overwhelm the long the Lord prophets voice which was only Elijah could imagine Israel which is a chosen people of God had no false prophet and truth and it has always been that way four hundred verses one eight hundred and fifty verses wrong how does that work and remember God takes this man but not the spirit Satan takes this mana not despair Oh church how does that work it seems to me the longer the time is the hotter the people the more sold out you get that's how it's supposed to be not following this and following that and following here and following their stay where the where there is no shut up there is no other way is only one way [Applause] it's a proven way it works [Music] [Applause] and God will let you play with it until you realize oh my it's a Brooke cuz it'll make you want to go that way alright go ahead and then you'll find out it broke it don't work no more and then you find yourself struggling to come back we're to the origin I don't care which church the chipster you always come back to the origin no word you didn't get salvation in the church you got it in the world but we seem to lose focus

or that - I understand lower than that you know what zeal means Z like what J who had zeal major who drive seriously the zeal of the law had eaten me sorry I could never lose my thing never ever cuz it's not mine but one day I found it one day for nobody never have to lay in the presence of God so help me God [Applause] [Music] we're looking for a few good men there won't be many go that's what makes me sad because as pastors we love everybody and we wish everybody would go but not everybody hop dizzy and a lot of people hanging on to people Scott wait for me wait for me are coming anytime you here wait for me I coming you're not going on your own you don't see wait for me I'm coming that wasn't gone you on your own you know where you're going hello you're there all right you get quiet again let me go back a and the purpose at all we better check our experiences these days were truly the Holy Ghost you're anybody the Holy Ghost is only go to a night in the last days go suicide and cry [Music] for the abomination and the abomination is a spirit of Nimrod that brings into the church he had designs I'm gonna be like God I'm gonna get worship like God and I'm gonna do things like God let me tell you Satan has nothing original without the original he isn't he don't have a job are you hearing me all the original is on your side our side my side his side he can only imitate [Music] impersonate and we ran after the imitator and not the one will you original seal [Music] the money to make from counterfeit look green and it it even feeling but it in really same thing with a counterfeit Krishna look really sorry feelin real but an injury I don't want that to be me I don't want to wait until I reach down there to find out that I'm real a doctor now [Applause] God must be real to me now not that want to be real now I trust by the time we finish if you let me finish then you would realize where we are because sometimes you can be so comfortable and Trinidad is the country of comfort don't get back to me we just don't have it that good so for us that's excellent as a new world I thought Berta Shane excellent so we must check in my CV remember it Larry god bless furnishing hallelujah I'm almost feeling like I'm home so he's only going to anoint in the last days those who cry and sorry do you remember how to say can you say how does that thing do you know how to cry but it's not just sign and crying but the silent crying for what so you could pry outside for the wrong thing I got I got got a little Eve God join you axis to measure and she was here when you say what joint God God joined together let no man put asunder usual man you are ask God God all God and then you remain you nice the bad good comment for what better offer I wonder if we really believe us boy Kobe scratch-off was as long as you're doing anyway what's gone we change the promenade and then we sit down and walk with me you want him back with you and you pull out the page what's in that covenant is a whole page but God you remember us over the same oh god the fear I mean the world in fear but God is just God did not just leave us so if he said better you didn't see the tire and he cannot lie and make a comment if you said Oh better one come if you move or change governor what I do in here let me go on so today we're mine how'd it go back excuse the old man I know how cannot as fast as I used to be so where is it in our day abomination would be deceptive because sin is not getting less it's growing you just can see it because it's invisible why it is principal that is and if we were fighting a fight with a tang clan clan and we seen one another it's a different story you could come up and say well I sure don't fight I can I look blow here and there but that's what I'm five I heard me but I know the fight we talk about spirits not zooming in and zooming out and you can hope to beat a spirit in your body and in your flesh you better get some spirit [Applause] they go up if you don't want to fight to be one-sided going leg in his presence and I'll tell you where is this I come in there so he's hiding and not only and therefore if he's hiding only the truly spirit-filled ones would see him I just went to speech a circus services room and I found out they are gifted men who are not truly spirit-filled that's dangerous because they have a manifestation of the real Holy Ghost but the life which is the person of Christ it's not there that means dangerous men gifted Canady night how many of you does this at the TD jakes wait baby doll I know no hands for why would I want to listen to him if I have somebody who can see what he cannot see and I will tell you I hope he doesn't mind he's truly gifted let me leave it there let's move on and the Provost said now we can shout we can scream we can speak matones and have signs and things but where is the sincerity about the Word of God and in the Church of God this idolatry had become a grief to Elijah Elijah is the type of the church is it a grief I had some Amen Connor we got a ship the boat horn again signals here this side I'll call it as I see it hello because I'm asking you is it a grief is it grieving you this is boring you to action cause if you're not if it's not grieving here you're sleeping or the two kinds of people in this in this war those who are wake and those who are sleep and these days if you're sleepy means you're dead you dying twice physically spiritually you cannot afford to be like that now when the Prophet was are wrong he had so many demons and sort of fight could you imagine now could you imagine now if there was ever a time to churches beyond this God the church should be focuses now that glass all over the place the Philistines the armor eyes the besides the mists heights the club play nights all the ice and only the truly spirit-filled that is why I don't even think you realize what kind of man your Shepard is no I don't have to give props God give him props I doesn't give people purpose I speak the facts because if is either there it's not there you can't pretend it's there and it's not there and it because it's there I'm here and one of the problems is we are canceled far from God that we can discern what is spirit-filled are supposed to be gifted and somebody raised for say nice things China lalala and all the people in that section gone leaving that which made them to be here sit please you're baptized and you receive the world and you've been fed who could you get perfected some wheels it's like you're going a restaurant and you order food and you want me to be free you're gone I see you're not being a bit oh then we'll pay for it but I dominate what you eat is were you painful are you getting me we are looking always for their easy way there is no easy way but Abraham said the Christian walk is a rugged Rock this is do you know a rugged meet not smooth you need to take a hike in the rugged terrain and understand when you come back why you have ten bruised rocket means not smooth if you find your life smooth don't leave here until you ask God to change [Applause] [Music] okay let's roll this idolatry had become a grief to Elijah and as Christians we should always watch what we do and say I find there is a level of concern Sarah T among believers and I'm coming I'm coming from home now I used to we began some serious prayer about six years ago they spray and then spray I'm done with laying in his presence so I'm not preaching to you something I hope work I'm preaching to you what I have experienced and one of the things God showed us when we really got down to pray and by the way praying easy for those who think crazy no no no no no no no there's a struggle until you break through you ain't wait until you break through cause that part before you break through is you're dying you know patience with God and you accident for patience how does that work can you spend 50 minutes in prayer it's a better move for every I know that's why you're like that cuz those who bring like Jesus he stayed all night I'm not telling you about Peter now I'm not telling about Paul I'm speaking about the Messiah and if he did that whole night you think at 10 minutes ago work for you but you know why we look 10 minutes because our experience is equivalent to 10 cents committed Allah so we could only pray what we experienced and we not prepared to go deeper to get higher you cannot go higher going up heaven is the only place where higher means going down on your knees if my people which are called by my name shall humble what that means is kneeled on stoop don't lie down down fibrous to pray standing stooping sitting different ways and David didn't even take that chance you see a falling prostrate and you afraid if I come in your house and your prostate on the floor but I don't think you crazy and yet that is evidence of your growth in going because as you grow in God you get more sincere sincerity comes from growth in God where we are now I wasn't there before and then we found out that we used to talk casually now coming by in tomorrow and fix the thing but we lie we didn't go and we didn't call and say we can't make it so it's come a habit but it is called lying the first man I ever hear talk straight is William Branham when he said every hung leg and I stood at attention I said Oh God we shall a man kept say that bring him and they brother Branson we've got don't do this then he's and he's obligated to do it then he is not God you say that Goodin you don't deserve the right to speak to God until you stay with God the more you stay talking to your wife and it is the easier it cut it gets I don't like to go there but I just pull it right Boggan on way and what is happening with marriages today's Tschida heat it and we talking all by tax you can up your she answer back not now Sam house and if you're talking to her you were talked about and I say white I know your bread I know and if you can't talk to her you're gonna talk to me or you can put on a smile a casual hello god bless but how far does it go so we cut that out because we found out as we pray and we got muslin see things change and the angel told William Branham my prophet yes - if you can become more he was already sincere you know of anybody who promised somebody something and reached halfway down the road and bring it all the way back after preacher and the end I said am i enough you want to get rid of cancer then your heart go down in the basement you can stay in the veranda y'all go in the engine room we want so much things from God but we are not prepared you can get more speed from the book if you're not in the engine and in separatin it had to be easier than that yes but is not in the Bible not that what you want is knowing that Bible matter get the next Bible you have a lot of able regain this so this brother had a problem a problem of self-indulgence in the flesh in the flesh I hope a talking store could speak in green Erica talk about internet not too sure and I don't want to live my welcome but he had a problem itself and doesn't he love the Lord hard-working praising God Shelton and I prayed for him and I thought that God but I go in the church every morning pray lay in his presence and then I go to work you don't have to do that because you're not fire everything fire home in fire so I would drive up going for a half an hour and those are the brothers who followed me and we will pray and he will be praying and crying every single day and it got to me I said what is he crying so Allah isn't he victorious didn't he get the victory and I wouldn't approach him because I'm waiting some of us don't weigh a lot of experts in the message and by the way X means you're not there again and I was weighted and that came communion service and after the message I saw anything and I said what's wrong brother he said I can't take communion no he didn't say I come to come here you see I happiness problem I said where you had a sit at communion because you can't be taking communion after reading all the scripture says judge yourself fix it up we'll make it right with God and stay there until it's right and I said maybe you're not sincere enough cuz everyday he would come and I think he's getting the victory and same thing the night same thing no this is a brother his whole life that's what he did and this message that I'm preaching him I'm not preaching this him because of because I have nothing to say it works that's telling you that God changes people and God heals and God delivers and it don't work I'd be lying original I and this message that God has sent to us with the dynamics of the mechanics has enough power to change the body but the reason why you're still in the press where you are it's because you're not sincere you're like the lady that told brother Branham I wanna stop smoke she would be in the prayer line all the time she would be in the prayer line day after day and better brand I pray for her the Prophet didn't go away I don't care who prefer if you don't want that double go he married to you even the devil does nowise marriage he married he stayed there you had a divorce him Oh quick the divorce in the natural but we not divorcing in the spiritual that's where the divorce need to be and the most wish to separate and you cannot separate and still have him light a new thing now in Grenada and applause from a white but she's my girlfriend so men would it was still living and sleeping by the lady but a divorce that went on here not that can't be going on here but separate means to set power rate and I'm saying to you the power is real and the only reason why you ain't seen it in your life if you're not seeing it because you didn't mean it and they don't know when you mean something coming up here for me tonight you ain't going make a move if you want him to stay if you still like it he's still like that spirit let me tell you you cannot get rid of the devil unless you're headed if I regard iniquity in my heart God will not hear me on the reason why many of us are lights is up and down or we get a little picture even getting a little revival in the three weeks the revivalist only plan we got just alyou it Noorie it's because of a lack of sincerity we should have been higher than where we are now this one I we bridge joke you're making that's the most powerful force that ever hit this lit hip to moon missus not comparable and God bless against the hearts and the minds of simple people why complicate it we complicate the message the message is not complicated [Applause] looking for other ways to pop the water but it don't need the voice of God that can pop the water when God come down he will pass your water he will separate your situation he will divide it for the Word of God is powerful [Applause] Shabba that's not so like that and you telling me you're still with this yes now SEP super this sorry can I say that [Music] I'm passionate sorry I'm very passionate cuz this is my life that's all I got I want much more like David said I don't want to be rich don't want to be pushed just give me this and I'm holding on to this until dot-com and so after that experience the briella came to me said Burton this is the situation with me I said well now mean business with God I said you were making the problem God is already giving her the deliverance to his will and what his spirit and spirit his life will you not take any life if you take it you would lose it and I said the first thing is to you gotta hate it a week bus and we have permiten I don't know how you do it I was here in your permitted what our permit and everybody comes out because they understand dice the oil we didn't know that before it's gonna be gone to pray we found the sound like the oil in the church now I hope I'm pushing nobody tools because pray without ceasing is in the Bible but if you're looking for a shortcut what can you do and you know what happened he came to me one morning happy Laughlin mr. Burton I couldn't believe this thing so easy I said what you said take God [Applause] Dino island he said it's gone and you know what the next weekend permitting he pretends no when we got the break there's that change now he happy he said you mean all this time I was holding back myself [Applause] the problem is not brother to you if you have a problem it's not none of the ministers it is whether you're here and no it is this you can trust because if I tell this when I get something by the time you reach in your back is a different story so I don't trust this I trust this if you are listening to me this morning with this angle no way but if this is open it will hit your soul and it would not be oh nice message it will be oh girl I want that [Applause] [Music] he's happy now where another brother he was in the message and he said good not in the world cause he don't know it is like I said brother you know you're doing si all right and he gone in the world first thing what there was a job watch them job again not all job is job he heard me some daughter some of them job see Sonny let's give you to blind you I hope is going touching my I'm toast I know you have I see on the news to budget and everybody jittery and so on and so on so pretty before you do anything but he took a job in the bank and they give me the right name the bank is a bank of this and a bank at that and a banker the other by the time he catches himself he was gone and for five years the devil did what he want with him we kept praying for him and one day he came back he said lord I want to give my heart to the Lord but he didn't just come back so yeah something driving back and he couldn't handle it we reach a place right called full and he had no place to put what was coming on couldn't handle it spirits this that he say want to come back to the Lord and I said wonderful brother if you mean business with God I stand with you if you're not mean in business with God please speak to somebody else because I don't even joking when it comes to that no no no I don't have friends when it comes to that I have brothers they're not a thing so he came back we prayed for him and he thought it was alright man that was the beginning of troubles you went off got a runner his brother who was in the message who is one of the trustees had to run and help him and he was getting worse and they bring him into the mental institution and they give him what they ought to give him and he came back out and he kept the church and we taught okay now look okay and then he trip again I know he strip himself naked and ran in the road the people came to us and said you know what we want to take him to a Pentecostal preacher who does do a lot of deliverance and he came to him but Russ he said you're praying look at you walking he came to me as he said Burton what to do I said listen you want to take him take you know the message you know the way if they want to take him not you if they want to take me let them go with him his mother came to church you know in a message and after she heard the message I don't know what happened but it didn't bother and we prayed for him and it's only when he got sin CA I talking real sincere Donna's knees whole night I'm not talking about 3 o clock and ago not sleeping whole night and I'm asleep before a week today in e-rate mind serving the Lord but he will tell you don't you ever do it because I'm saying to you you do not walk off on God and get by with it that's got me day and night you're piling up trouble for yourself every inch is yours you plant it you offices that's why when you come back it's not just the prayer of the believers that will help you man you are a walk through the valley of the shadow of death you got to come to yourself that's where you find God in his presence are you following me he had it he had it hard but he's no victorious let me run quickly as I as I realized I passed well after cuz I I'm wondering if I don't want y'all all right and that was the second brother he had another brother who was a song leader but he have a problem with women his wife could not make children so he blame her and he was looking for a baby I would say he didn't get it and he would drift off and I didn't even know that was happening until one day after the word he you were screaming on the floor and there may be good to find out he repented because his phone had all the ladies in it pornography tilt of the woods game in the church and he's singing so I've seen it singing shoten praising and living in didn't I say brother oh you could live like that and be I mean this is not the right way I said you need to get sincere gets and seal with God and stop blaming your wife you might be thinking she can make on my knees you many times we put a blame somewhere else isn't that easy easy put somewhere else not me who me could be then who and when he got serious with God I'm talking about serious we don't tell one another I'm coming on don't go we don't talk casual life if we cannot do it we cannot do it but you're not gonna get him doing that what have we found a move of God so powerfully the sister had a baby when the baby was born it had jaundice and they kept the baby in a special incubator and she and I didn't even know how much trouble she was going to until she me give the testimony and the baby had white blood cell count higher than the red fightin the infection and it got so high that the doctor said it's climbing every day it was climbing 12 13 they called me when it hit 14 so what's happening here he said the baby is getting worse in the beginning they didn't call me because I figure the doctor tell them II could hunt you know but it was getting worse and then he said when it hit 14 will taking it from you god is danger and that morning it hit 14 and they called me and I said I just finished in the church brain I said Lord what do I do and the Lord directed me to go in a certain place because the the what make it worse her baby was not taking the milk which could you read it to the problem because the milk helps to fight the infection Bressman are you following me I can say that and she it wasn't flowing and she was getting real anxious it's our first baby just married and you know how that means I'm just growing getting worried that morning one of the relative scream out check the whole church and I didn't know why then after we found out and that morning I was gonna say Lord what do I do and a lot directed me and I went to this lady that I usually buy peppermint oil from and I said I need something that talks about breast feed she said well mom is my Hannah I don't know what to do I said well you are empty ebook she said look under there I said what page is breastfeeding she say I don't know I said well let me go and since God is my witness I open it and they're in a carrot page breastfeeding problems God is my witness I don't really been cutting but I tell any I open it just breastfeed him problems I say I want a photocopy that she said all right I took the book I bring it downstairs and I see the hair that Pete had other things so I said well Lord I hope that's not sin and I tear them out and I photocopy them and I now put them back with group I can't lie and the glue stick it really nice you won't know and I said thanks and I went to the hospital and that started I said go in the hospital Testament said stop you need oil call the elders anoint them with oil so I went looking for oil and oil in Grenada you know like the olive oil there was it expensive and I have my liquor cap she always walking my little care so I said I need just this amount and I didn't tell her why she said well if you need them yet go in there and I walked to everybody and then they say good to that way and when I saw the lady and I said I need someone she said come and she poured out her bottle which normally will sell for $15 and she purchased some and she gave it to me she said you can leave I said I don't want to pay for because I remembered Abraham and I pull out $10 I said she said I said no take it and then I said I'm going to pray for a sick person and I went to the hospital and when I walked into the hospital they said you cannot see the baby the mother has to come out I said well I want to pray for the baby said no you can't see I said well if I can't get the baby I'll get the mother because she's getting it from the mother and I showed out what to do in the page tell you how to hold a baby to breastfeed apparently out of in a certain position real techniques and you put it in a way then it flew and so on and so on she had a picture but the the number on the white blood cell had risen for them to take the baby and I am no in tinfoil and I said father God in the name of Jesus I cannot reach the baby but I can reach the mother I pray that you would touch that baby and then I left I said keep me up to date the next morning she said president of them is gone down I said what does it she said normal England of the disease he goes well normal [Applause] let me go quickly I just express these things to you to show you what praying in his presence does so the Prophet was saying I find as a level lack of sincerity alright and this is where we are feeling because if we are not truly honest and sincere with each other how can we be with God so sometimes operator God is as casual as or words to a burden and if your brethren can't take what you say can Gothic and you're not going to get God moving if you're in serious the Bible clearly says in Matthew 5:37 let's you're a be a and your Navy knee you're ready for the rest and whatsoever is more than these comment of evil I would like the 'man know like the word how do we serve one another is how we serve God so if I am honest and sincere with you I will be so cool with God then my prayer will be different my life will be different my walk with the different my talk and that's what's all in the truth but this is a spirit is not bringing it up Trinity this is a spirit all over catch your lies I don't care how you dress it is a lie if you didn't do it and you didn't call and say I can't do it you like to him because if you tell me you'll come into fixed maggiore and I'm dependent on you because I really need it fixed on your didn't show you gave me a lie to bank and they become NSF not sufficient funds do you do it and we don't just lie to one another we can even tell the pasta I'm pass our own pass on do it tomorrow I had the brother called me today because I heard I knew he was supposed to go by me to do something he sent me a text I said I can't do it today but I do tomorrow and I could Bank that can God Bank Hills can God Bank yes cuz you depend on his world what does he depend on if your prayer is not something for him to take and God hear me God is no respecter person you could be in the best change if you're hot not right nothing happening and this is all over the world the word we have is enough to raise the dead every Sunday for hosts the dead gonna hear when your brother ain't even here we are seen and he alive you have people you know when they tell you to come here anymore in because you're not incoming but you're doing communion a better move on because when you get quite like that let's get free and at the in Trinidad so I want you to treat me nice all right so let me move on so he says anything that is not here on me Chamitoff even now how we serve one another I saw we serve God all right now many a time our praise him that because his lack sincerity when we get real serious with God it will show up in a walk with others a man under pressure is what he is irony a man under pressure is what he is his real true characteristics will show when he is under pressure a pipe that you say you just fix it fix until I open it oh you put some tape on it you put whatever it is a lot of promise today our pipe join us the knock llamas they're not the same thing and it's easy to join pipe where's another story to get the whole thing to work you say a Christian are you you sure you're not out Joyner joined us brother this sister or join this and join that god bless god bless Dino enough the life is abyssal Whovian you remember take these words they are serious there's no other shortcut and God looking for his people to move from where they are and it's the simple things we leave undone he's ready and saying God hides and what we make it complicated let's let me go on so when he's on the pressure gets him all riled up stirred up these didn't even have to get them riled up he always right you ever have people like that they always your fritters music god bless just I look at him and just say sorry then you'll see the rail man come on if he has a temper it will show I had a brother that you stay hit his wife trusting betta she will come he see relative I'm afraid and he had to get serious to stop be thorough I said until you get your wife to not be afraid of you as if it's the children you ain't reached no way she must feel comfortable in your present your wife comfortable in your purse or your boys big on your hand big a vice versa because this is women hittin [Music] so you have a template to a show and here is God puts all his children this is a path alike because history know how to behave what makes it bad is one that is not a certain but a day in the house the worst thing to have is cousins that come in your house and behave bad and India but Incas audio so the real children know how to behave you know how to walk they know how to talk they have an experience but it's not only children anyhow I hope you are altering or what your God that we all are children look I gotta go gotta push this I don't want to miss miss the rapture might come before we see again and I want this to be get perfected so it does literally testimony could help you may God help you so you will see the real man if he has a template to show if he's meek it will also show if he's meek and gentle now we get in there it will also show God put all your own pressure on the test to see whether there's any hitters flaws I love that God is a God of perfection you are supposed to be a statue of perfection God doesn't do like other men after you don't bring it why are you going on you checking it so after you make the foot you'll kick it to see if we could swing cuz you don't make sense I've been offered the catwalk so when you make the honeys or you working good right hello every pot working I don't have to be standard a head first or he put but whatever he did it works and how does he know put it on no what yes Gordon just called Moses and say hey go get some boy since long Moses no yeah a job to do it we just didn't know how he had to be done we had an idea but the idea is not good idea Yahweh's us know his ways he thought he thought God idea was boxing hit it Bam Bam Bam and then God show him that naughty way because when he did that the other end for you like imagine I tried to pop up I ought to run for my life and I supposed to be the deliverer so maybe I mix it boy I miss it somewhere but God and way enough and the backside that he doesn't he come from one side front seat place of prestige to a place where no party no and all the others he and the manimals these caring care of animals God sir before you leave my people look from cheap [Music] [Applause] and here you have the real happy chance with sheep because all our sheep needles are good and going there very obedient we have that here so God checks us to see there's any flaws he called Jonah to see if Jonah had flaws disarmed hey I want you go in the never and everybody know they never was built by whom Nimrod so that's not place or what idol worship Jen jordison me going I'm dead we end up going Tasha's weave God send a donkey and you decide the worm so you just make it higher it's just a longer walk [Applause] Moses Peter all these men had the experience of pressure Rita is one of the best I like breasts I see myself in Peter Oh glory you see Peter wonderful brother hey children you can't be around here now this is big people thing and Jesus a hold on Peter suffer the little children to come unto me if I thought you won't have to go no Peter you're missing it every time the Tomica move is not the move God huh he had a zeal but he didn't lay where in his presence he didn't lay a defeat but you know what to say you see Jesus what was high now you are coming we are better so I got see up whereas get up and preach yourself you like adren these are sacred grounds every word I preached to you everyone even the commas I have to come in a cone you know what the accountants naughty words and God what is true the account is the life you know how to give a to truth to the standard for yourself but you say are you gonna come so if the is not for the world is for the man that speak and do it so I don't play with this because he have things after when you inside and have in your face what happen a meeting with me so given a continued structure what did you tell them and I have a record of you look August 2014 listen to that you have tapes right way do you learn that from Wheelan tape from who wait TV come from wait audio come from everything we have here came from somewhere this is not original you have see whether Branham say he can see horse of young people's laugh and any lighter I met up at horse so when I was is see we they have our own ideas and we don't link it with you way and that way we just get tired you gain this so let's move on I have to move it lighter got to see Israel in the Chu State under pressure under pressure and this church will never know what it is until have pressure when God move you from your little comfort we say but I don't want to move well I know if he's our son when you get to the one to pray not have to break they're not the same enough that they were mentioned I want to pray and I have to pray what the night is pre-meeting where we have to go to pre I just make from it in home I want to pray and that comes from what love and if you're in love you'll be sincere that's another problem again lack of sincerity is lack of what do you know that God had a problem in the first church age with all the you notice what he said you bump them up oh you're dissing your dad and I'm pleased with you but no it dies for sage and then men get that what we doing down in samia's way demlove the first loan and Jesus see when he come would I find fit do you know fit and love is cousin in fact we're ancestor can't go beat or the other for me to have it I must have confidence and if I have confidence is because of a relationship then how you could pray and ask God for things and you don't have a relationship because you're not talking to him some of us only talk mime in church what kind of relationship is that no wonder when you're not gonna know God doesn't even return what is looking for worshipers what time Wow only four people katalk what time you could shoot it from me if you don't mind what time I said sure not top-load what time yes he said let the God that is supernatural show himself alive let him be God if BL is because if he can answer let him answer let it go that answer let that God keep his word let that God I'll be gone alone I wonder if this challenge is not for us to prove in this dreadful times the word we preach if it is indeed the truth then it got to be on display don't you feel that this is not something you pray now this is Gideon in the house if God is real and is true and everything he says is right that I want some I don't want to be alone 195 son hope in the final son but Abraham say hope that skill feat but you know hope is long-range Peters now and many of us Oh dumb so don't so don't so happening now well dumb so wouldn't happen unless you are now now text you the dumb so you want the dynamics to be on display where are you now them is not words them as live in words and it has to be manifested and if not you say for them so if you don't want it somebody wants it we want it bad thanks me right how could I stand and look down and say that's not true that's not true that's not true this is true where is the evidence [Applause] maybe looking forgot to come back God is here you have to make that walk you have to make that talk you shut up [Applause] well you know like us I'm sorry I thought I was home stop that crying

change you [Music] [Applause] sometimes I'm praised a message I had a friend in school well we grew up together and he was a revolutionary he became the commission of police and in the time of Bishop he brought me into the army to be the bodyguard of the prime minister's wife and while we were in school with me we've argued every single day he against God I forgot I'm giving up King given up he holy and I hold my own and as we got older he got bolder I got bolder and then the revolution fell like that batts and he was left with nothing he got the press started to drink and we started drifting because now he's saying things as I can handle because the material God enemies are my enemies his friends are my friends whatever side he have I am on anyone coming against him meets me dices all it is that's what it is and we party to this day he thinks I abandoned him but I did not abandon him God cut the time to this day I don't know what I would tell him if I see him he's sick dying and I saw God hand in my life and I said Lord maybe it's because I stood faithful or whatever it is I am grateful today I'm still holding my end he undoing what are you willing what is the thing that keep you going what driving you over every time on a preacher the full and me much more minutes out of time there is a boolean there is a pull here let me run so the time has come to produce the evidence surely we are forced to get dung in earnest and get into that secret place because let me tell you something don't let them people come and ask you where is your God a missionary event or our India and they say hello don't bring new tracks do bring nothing everything you bring in we already know in fact the Bible come from us we stop Mohammed use of Jesus but until you could bring at Jesus that could raise the dead and open eyes to talk to us but Abraham said that missionary left with his help turned on and he tail between your legs not willing to tell them there is somebody that can do that that can make the word live Isis succulent people now for this for the Christian faith now there's two questions in the world let's Christians any message and they trace on outside I'm not talking about the outside one's talking body here if you have to come to that place that's where you really go know why you're believing it's not knowing them right now everything aromas nice but if you had to give it up account and they said hey if you recant we spare you but if you keep in that name you go in you don't have a prayer life you don't have a relationship is going you will tell them hello I go in with you I mean it you know what the devil tells you what to tell God Joe whatever you do him is all right but if I could hit the body I was squeezing day and we could talk holmen's all mysteries on all testimonies until or unless they touch this this real thing are you willing to make that sacrifice in prayer nicely real thing that secret place where he dwells and takes of take us up to where he is we can shorten that's good we can run and that's good we can sing that's good but there is more and we ought to go after it to see a living manifestation of God for when the supernatural is presented faith Rises [Applause] and what we have now has the rise but Abraham said many cars gonna do it what they have it cannot do it and if you forgot and you go back in the seals which came from heaven and drawn by the angel that anything on that tree God is up the devil you like the hitter he said that is pagan worship but a parent was too plain go back in your books if you have many times you give a lot of credence the things that got dumped he dumped why because he saw the Train of Nimrod I never never stop walking step by step Jesus Judas he never will stop until we go Soph it has to rise and what we have now has to rise now you looking for body change I don't have a body change but but it changes move it it's called rapture in rapture and fit is a higher fit know if you're not fit to stop you to take I went low to take small one if you don't have fat for that which body changing there's no such thing as well I feel sorry for you no you feel sorry for yourself Jesus told that is Madonna weep for your self I already in you commanded and for your children your body has to change and it's good to rejoice but reality is your name there for body change we call remember that book written long before we born and God have names and double not this not a book like Diana this is called a page ym is the book there's any mine that he alone knows and he allocate 144 for the Jews I wonder how much he allocate for the sentence God is omnibus go ahead you wanna hear up numbers 1 to 8 and one of the 8 was not his how much went in the AK check and see the animals and contain them lights greased upper room 128 of numbers small numbers they are about 1.5 million people in the message or wrong the world how much names in the book because you have a lot of people who are attracted to the book they like the book the love about the book but they're naming one the book and it's easy to know where name is I think but at this brother he talked about why's the name well that name had to be in the book no name surprise God none hello I cannot surprise God you cannot surprise God you can see what about him I have insane on I wanted these days I will see if I could get some time hello you missed the boat I said it's not hope is now fate and they've gotten talking to you then something wrong because he prepares he what Jesus said all that them is here none is lost and we were there in the room with him when you are they always close to him how many gone he said I'll come and be a comforter to you comforter casting in marival and you did Santa Grandy wherever you are the computer had to be with you especially today we need real comfortable I gotta go I had something here I must leave with you Pentecost can do denominations cannot do it then it leaves just a little bright and he always said little bright my sheep know my voice no I heard my sheep and he didn't put chips because sheeps is not a word and sheeps is not our you can say single a sheep Lordships so he said my sheep no ships no no my voice not will know already know I heard me they know my voice in all right and that bride will hear is still small voice while dong on her right the honest in his Shekinah presence and they will bring that rapture in feet we look forward we look around their groups look along the groups in the message there's an increase in sickness there's increase in hospitalization like never before the rates of divorce I never thought I'd live to see so much divorce in the message is that they never heard Mary's own divorce what about nothing to do with them is that fellow named Nimrod unless desire to conquer and have a church like grace and his church is Mabel of X I also Dax Jesus honors individuals with their name you know in school X means wrong or out of it I don't know why I keep going Lord this is not my business let me just go here so divorce rates on the rise hospitalization under eyes more people need more prayer and the plagues and drop yet in earnest because the Prophet said it will begin to show just before we go do you want more plague and wanna know but I call for the eruption way Israel call for their release God said four hundred years time to go fortune and ten years the men and ready for John 20s then ready four hundred thirty years the nosin we can't take it anymore they call for it and the reason why I believe nobody knows the day or the hour God written on you [Music] young believe that because I tell you why God cannot bring you if you're not ready and God have time so here the Prophet says if you're in common I will squeeze you because I'm gonna lose none and the devil done a my all and God said you're coming after them but they are mine and my sheep will hear my voice and hearing the voice is good what if I say good at - you don't want you to come and say praise the Lord and make him feel good he are no nice boy in this church I had a shake I better than just a nice boy now I sewed a nice nice nice I need serious it's nice people as I or not shocking to you know Colin and she's so nice and she does lie all empress and I'm the telling you the truth who nicer than them you

go when every Sunday I pray I walk with God on the beach every Sunday I couldn't go any race or walk wrong but nothing holds this morning and I talk with God and I hear his voice and when I finish

trust them you know how many of our grandparents gone in our priceless eternity because of these nice people but I'll stop that let me know so let me go on so we see these things coming in the message Oh Lord we need to get down and climb up into that dwelling place remember he misses his under the juniper tree then we can say let the God that answer by fire come and burn up the sacrifice Elijah did that and if I came down and lick up all the water and sacrifices why Balaam was important dead and did not know it but after the fire still that wasn't enough and Elijah just did not know what to do so they did what most people do in such a situation he took off you ever had yourself in that situation and Iran but he did not just run back to Egypt or to his friends or to the medicine cabinet no he ran until he came and rested under a juniper tree when you when trouble comes to you where do you want to go now sometimes I feel bad and I'm going to work in the morning I said well just let me reach in the church socket one free and I'm telling you I Drive another thing and I say Ricky and I started praying all that bad feeling just wipe away so you know what it judge is my hospital my

filthy what is yes but how you feeling you're naked but when you come here and you're hitting with it mr. stack your feet put on your girdle yeah I hear that any battle cut up your loins [Applause] and talk to me did you drop that the Santa Fe I like doing one going after all back on to what God said let me gonna have some fun and he talked to Tom and Joe answer back and talked to Joe and he said what you did when I was measuring it is see when I pulled the tape and I line up we did not be resolved what you dare when the sons of God oh oh you don't know the Bible what happening and I heard better tutor stir you preach back to me want me to where are you how are you [Applause] [Music] I was there [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you see how this thing sweet oh you can leave this to go for that when a branch say you know why we don't have revival the only one service for one hour half in singing half in preaching because if you don't do that the people wouldn't come the problem is not the Peterson is the people I saw this long when we were in heaven we didn't have short services in 1000 years it wouldn't happen by and you can take our Ghidorah in Azusa Street revival by the way no move of God ever came without prayer [Applause] not even the upper [Applause] how is it you don't like them talk to the one that you say you love what can I love is that die why is the only thing he can say Bridget our season Lin says sing without ceasing hello wild why not beam up of my oh god casual like me and you better you better take the word for what he says it needs no private God let me go again but after the fire still that wasn't enough and that has happened when people backslide you heard me that is happening the scene go there hearing God and the power of God moving through and they want more than that Israel had reached that place and Elijah just did not know what to do and there are ministers who just don't know what to do we get so what did he do he took off but when I'm said I'm glad that there is a juniper tree me too you got you have one dole I know look at my casual if you don't have one get one this morning but unit batteries are kind of bushy thing that does give shade so much I can sleep and you can eat and you can lay and God like juniper trees why president says they've got meet him in a juniper tree day and I don't have Juna pretty down here in the same situation you come in president except there's a thing in law I don't know be a lawyer I said when president said there was wind case by that they did that direct so my case is that you in the case and if there's precedent said what we'll do for death I want mine too [Applause] so let me run quickly he said oh I'm so glad there is a juniper tree we're all God's people needs to go know me what say the Prophet you say love needs to go not should go need is something higher in others you must do it when they are discouraged or when they are disappointed or when they are dismissed I'm giving us some more adjectives but disliked or had a big one or the boos are nothing like that word a or disinherited as a new thing now everybody who was supposed to get that that somebody if they inheritance a natural type spiritual or damaged your people are the stolen damaged goods nobody want to touch them obviously for people he she's damaged goods as if you in a damaged as far as icons on all of us get damaged and what did God do with the damage you see I didn't come to call on damaged stuff and I the problem in the church too many were just people too many good people 20 nice but I was nice I was wretched I was a rich and I knew that that's another thing if you don't accept your was a rich drama problem cause everybody a cop is he did Lord oh listen he doesn't he or he interact ordained and yet people who does analyze he could make it why he can't make it rain on walking crooked oh yeah I know but I want that wall job is just identifying yeah yeah you see I want to make I talk to that one but not I want long hear expert remember X beans they out of it [Applause] we can analyze the pasta message and annoyed modern he telling him what he preached when God gave it to him interpreters like Nimrod you know what mockery means the interpreter of the gods and mockery was named Redwoods cush was Bell was fellas and by the way welcome from River rebel rebel Belle is BL so all rebels get their origin and the connection from Nimrod words are very important don't minimize them everything means something where did I learn that in prayer everything God say have a meaning when you're reading the exodus I can say already lamby so and this year and it's a lord or looking for if it wasn't important you wouldn't have put it it's just that you can't see it not because it that don't mean you have iron significance meaning don't tell them names and you've been here is not by chance you could have been somewhere else and if you're not somewhere else you're here in all right then make it count you don't have much time make it count I saw a man Welles listen to me preach in Grenada and as they're preaching waiting like the service he would get up and walk out and I knew he was walking out because you didn't like the message and God didn't make me do not I just preaching and not trying to reach him and a preacher and I'm not never change and bad gas stroke so I say like Elijah he go change change what the man died wife compeletly but to be looked at it going on and in his condition temper high like a kite and I have learned sickness don't change you death don't change you better be careful and aspirated in you come when you're ready wanted to go is when you go make children don't play with God you get rid of us for it now the word come to cut it off don't cut it off Monday and Wednesday when I look for it like that people who love strawberry cigarettes and go back for the but again same every week and our week time you can't sterilize you notice the messages is the same message with a different slant to the same people know if the people growing the message will grow whether you can't even go higher if you angry and after a while he acts good what to do because if it happened in lighter who was God prophet we can minimize nobody every minister goes do that I go to it I would preach and then I got a message after a message somebody fight on the way home in the bus and you can tell me in Trinidad I do happen spirits are the same they remove I remember this colored lady who got hit by a car so they asked her if she wanted to sue for damages that's another new thing in defeat she said lost in no child I don't need damage I need repairs and I think that's what the church need today a lot of repair you like I needed it and we find that place of repair under the juniper tree I won't stop just now cuz I can't give everything here because you see there's something here there's a there's a current there's a whirlwind there's a there's a spin I can feel good talking and food is something when it nice it has heated slow nobody ever going KFC and just leave walking and gasoline and KFC's the worst food ina see people aside the big so I say if I had a cave see diamond comin in and they will Sydney and chew the board well it's not the board is not born to the thing that is the period she came from cause he used to be born is not born it's soft bonus something when you're bagging suppose a crack I hope this mean you're taking it way Ridge all right coming down so Elijah was so disappointed think he had done exactly what God told him to do and that the people would believe but he found out that all the miracles God told him to perform which he did still Jezebel not only refused what he said but she countered what he was saying and there's a lot of counters in the message in Grenada is a column counter-revolution once you in agree what Bishop said use a counter you contain what go today you have a better way there's no better way to bring a child but it's true word Lima if a woman make a baby and she's in labor she will never be close to the child the more your labor is the moral challenge of matchstick is everything watch them to have hard labor you cannot get the favor that child where are you wrong alright but if she the next field nuttin or hosting nothing just Remington him spin our are closing jeez Abell counted what he's in and she said I was stopping camp in and if he didn't stop our chopper fee head talk about that test and when the devil gets a hole of a person he just does him often Elijah felt heartbroken one day we does feel sometimes hosts we feel sometimes when disappointment arise in spite of all the signs he did no change so the skirts are not broken he ran to the juniper tree for refuge and rest there he was over there all by himself he had left his servants further back and gone on by himself and when he got serious with God we will and when we get serious regard we will come to him alone alone you ain't serious until it is you alone here no friends no father no mother you alone that's when you're ready all right yeah but I've just my little key in a nice little song when we get serious with God he will come to him we will we will come to him alone in sincerity under the juniper tree all of us ought to have a place we can go when trouble arises let's bow our heads this medicine while your heads are bowed and your eyes are closed I want you to think about this all your problems all the things you suffer all the disappointments everything that you got you do you have a place of refuge with God a place of retreat a place where you spend time in prayer not an hour but a time when time runs out when the curtains drop down and the world is shut out once the thing we need to go back we can't keep runnin and we can keep shipping if you want that change then you have to do something to get that change fit is what you believe that God will do but you got to do something to you have to accept what he said you have to believe what you say are you gonna just move along with the life you have or you want something deeper with going until you lay in his presence remember he lied I went there and he laid and then God dropped down he sent that Raven Raven is the most intelligent bird in the world to feed him with meanness in under the juniper tree God feeds you he takes care of you that's when you make an experience that's when nobody could come and tell you something else too many people have been easily led you need a personal touch with God God wants you to go deeper and it can't work unless you go down lay in his face there's things to be done here God is identified this place to lead the charge that's one of the reasons I'm here this morning he always has a place this is your juniper tree have you gone to the place where you forgot to come in the house of God and just lay or you're busy going you don't want to find yourself in trouble and then go and lay it won't be genuine it won't be true it be because you need him not because you love him I'm talking to Christians if you're not yet saved then there's no what time I good as any because you are running out of time what I'm calling the believers now the charges go deeper normally in Grenada I don't call an altar call I let the spirit speak to you what does the spirit tell you stay where you are go as you're going or are you willing to be sincere and be honest and said god I cannot continue the way I'm going I've got to get something Maury well the same place you got salvation is the same place you'll get that deeper work on your knees maybe I'll break that this moan and say isn't that somebody would fall on the knees it's a Lord God all me break me and change me is there somebody after all that you heard are you going to continue how you're going are you satisfied with your prayer life what if something come in your life are you satisfied that there's in this connection with you and God you can bring him down or you could go up [Music] I'm not smart I'm just simple don't make it complicated just surrender surrender to him and said Lord I want to closer work I'm on a deeper walk as a song the lady sang I want to go higher it doesn't happen just by saying it we gotta go down we gotta go down and clinch and get into that secret place that juniper tree surely it's about time for the bride to know who she is Heavenly Father we thank you Paul that has been said and done I cannot change them only you I trust law that what has been said can help them it's because I love you and because as servants of God we are compelled to speak the truth let it be a change in our attitude and the things we say to one another let's not lie let us be honest let us be sincere let it be a change in the church let it be our climbing to a higher ladder the virtue of showing themselves faith virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly
