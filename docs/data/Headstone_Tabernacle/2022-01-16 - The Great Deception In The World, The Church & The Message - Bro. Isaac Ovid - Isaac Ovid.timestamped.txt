[44:26] i think it's the first time i'm in this
[44:28] capacity for this year so
[44:30] we are still in the middle of january so
[44:33] we certainly want to
[44:35] extend all of god's blessings for this
[44:37] year
[44:38] how many appreciated services thus far
[44:40] but over the
[44:41] first two sundays of this year
[44:44] back to the cross
[44:46] and by one spirit you're baptized into
[44:48] the body
[44:49] making a straight line to what a great
[44:52] apostles preach paul would reference we
[44:54] come to preach christ on christ alone we
[44:57] come to preach the truth of the cross on
[44:58] the cross alone and the great theme of
[45:01] every apostle have you received the holy
[45:03] ghost since you believe that's anybody
[45:06] who wants to line up with this great
[45:07] mystery and this good revelation these
[45:09] are the things you preach have you
[45:11] received a holy ghost since you believe
[45:13] that's apostolic teaching it's teaching
[45:15] to set your heart on fire to create a
[45:17] desire in your soul that lifts you above
[45:20] the world lifts you above church and
[45:23] lifts you above the message because
[45:25] there are all kinds of people in the
[45:27] message but there's an elect in the
[45:29] message
[45:32] can i say that one more time there are
[45:34] all kinds of people in the message but
[45:37] there is an elect in the message
[45:39] oh hallelujah this shout message called
[45:42] all kind of people all kind of religious
[45:45] spirits all kind of people with all kind
[45:47] of ideas but in there make no mistake
[45:49] about it there is an elect lady who is
[45:52] not going to be moved by ideas not moved
[45:55] by all kind of winds of doctrine not
[45:58] moved by suggestions and and delusions
[46:00] and illusions but their eyes are fixed
[46:03] on the cross and fixed on a
[46:05] transformation not on the outside in but
[46:07] on the inside out up because there'll be
[46:09] the holy ghost life up we spoke about it
[46:11] in bible study they who walk after the
[46:14] flesh after the flesh but they that are
[46:16] of the spirit and as many as a leader
[46:19] who allow the holy ghost the holy spirit
[46:22] to lead them
[46:23] [Applause]
[46:24] until that police man can move from on
[46:27] the outside and come inside and then
[46:29] there's the holy ghost sitting on the
[46:31] tower of your heart or when you look
[46:33] left you know what to do when you look
[46:35] right you know what to do can the church
[46:37] say amen
[46:38] oh hallelujah

[48:01] that follow christ will suffer
[48:03] persecution but my promise is not
[48:05] persecution
[48:06] he suffered so he could be glorified and
[48:09] the sufferings of this present time are
[48:11] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[48:14] that will be revealed in us so hold on

[48:49] spirits not to be church members but

[49:22] while the angel is here he's stirring
[49:25] the water you could step into the water
[49:27] this morning whatever you have need of
[49:32] you may be seated
[49:33] [Music]
[49:34] hallelujah
[49:35] [Music]
[49:36] hallelujah
[49:38] god loves to confuse people it's through
[49:40] the foolishness of preaching he loves to
[49:43] confuse people just to think to god he
[49:46] loves it you know
[49:48] simon invited jesus to his home
[49:50] did not wash his feet
[49:52] and they used the opportunity when that
[49:55] woman came to wash his feet to make the
[49:58] accusation that if jesus only knew the
[50:01] kind of woman that had come to him
[50:05] or if he only knew what she was he would
[50:08] have sent her outside the church he
[50:10] would have thrown her out and jesus sat
[50:12] there
[50:13] he sat there quietly because he doesn't
[50:16] see the way man sees all those religious
[50:18] spirits that was sitting around jesus
[50:20] listen they were criticizing jesus
[50:24] and when you study it listen the amount
[50:27] of criticism jesus had to deal with
[50:30] how are you feeling bad when you get
[50:31] criticized
[50:34] they call jesus the devil in them
[50:38] they say these things you're doing is
[50:40] because you're part of the hobbyist
[50:41] above you
[50:42] and he said but a kingdom that's divided
[50:45] against itself cannot stand
[50:48] the devil smart enough to not break up
[50:50] your own army
[50:54] listen the devil is organizing him
[50:57] he's moving together you know
[50:58] is we have to come and see the unity of
[51:00] the fate or no
[51:02] not organized religion no no but one
[51:04] mind
[51:05] one accord
[51:06] one purpose one mission
[51:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[51:13] so
[51:14] i'm blessed by the services thus far for
[51:17] this year
[51:18] and uh knowing that god has something
[51:20] planned for us and we want to be
[51:23] connected to his plan
[51:25] and to his purpose
[51:27] so
[51:28] i have a message this morning
[51:30] by the grace of god and i have three
[51:32] scriptures that i want to read but we'll
[51:35] do two of them standing and then when we
[51:37] take our seats we'll grow through the
[51:39] third
[51:40] by the grace of god so can we get to our
[51:42] feet
[51:43] if you have your bibles would you tune
[51:44] with me
[51:46] we're going to go to the book of saint
[51:48] matthew 24.
[51:53] thank you musicians
[51:54] matthew 24
[51:58] verse 3.
[52:04] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[52:06] this is speaking about jesus the
[52:08] disciples came
[52:10] under him privately
[52:13] by this time in jesus ministry there
[52:15] would have been
[52:16] many people around jesus
[52:19] and the disciples being more and more
[52:21] exposed
[52:23] to the greater truths about jesus's
[52:25] ministry would have
[52:27] exercised wisdom
[52:29] and come to him when nobody else was
[52:30] there saying tell us when shall these
[52:33] things be
[52:34] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[52:37] and of the end of the world
[52:40] and jesus
[52:42] answered and said unto them take heed
[52:44] that no man deceive you
[52:48] we have read this many times
[52:50] but i want to amplify this statement
[52:53] take heed
[52:54] that no man deceive you so before jesus
[52:57] goes into any kind of explanation he
[53:00] first gives them a warning
[53:02] take heed that no man deceive you
[53:06] because jesus understood the power of
[53:08] deception
[53:10] and many of us we don't really
[53:11] understand the power of deception and
[53:14] how deception works and how deception
[53:17] slips in and the father and the author
[53:19] of deception so jesus goes on for many
[53:22] shall come in my name
[53:26] now the thing is deception is designed
[53:29] to deceive
[53:31] so deception is not obvious
[53:35] let me make a distinction that deception
[53:37] cannot be obvious to be deception
[53:41] deep understanding of the deception
[53:43] which would lead us to the scripture we
[53:45] will read about deceive the very elect
[53:48] if it were possible meaning it is so
[53:50] close
[53:51] that it's not as if you're seeing well
[53:53] he is off he is off you almost will not
[53:55] know
[53:56] that somebody is off
[53:59] and it challenges us by the word to be
[54:01] really careful to understand what is
[54:03] right and what is wrong and what
[54:04] guidance we have through the scripture
[54:06] and to the message of this great elijah
[54:08] prophet to discern what is truth from
[54:11] what is falsehood
[54:12] anybody with me this morning
[54:14] for many shall come in my name so
[54:17] they're not coming in a name that is not
[54:19] his name
[54:20] they're not coming and openly presenting
[54:23] something to you that you could say you
[54:24] know that's off no because they're
[54:26] coming in his name and and the lord
[54:28] jesus and they're saying certain things
[54:30] even quoting the prophet
[54:35] not a few will come you know
[54:40] many will come
[54:42] in my name saying i am christ and shall
[54:44] deceive many
[54:46] and you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[54:47] wars see that he be not troubled
[54:51] so the wars and the rumors of wars
[54:54] is not supposed to affect us
[54:56] for all these things must come to pass
[54:58] but the end is not yet
[55:01] for nation shall rise against nation and
[55:03] kingdom against kingdom and there shall
[55:05] be famines and pestilences and
[55:06] earthquakes in diverse places all these
[55:09] are the beginnings of sorrows not the
[55:11] ending that's how the sorrows begin
[55:14] then shall they deliver you up to be
[55:16] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[55:17] shall be hated of all nations for my
[55:19] name's sake
[55:21] and then shall many be offended and
[55:23] shall betray one another and shall hate
[55:25] one another and many false prophets
[55:27] shall rise and shall deceive many
[55:29] and because iniquity shall abound the
[55:32] love of many will wax cold
[55:37] but he that shall endure until the end
[55:40] the same shall be saved
[55:43] and this really resonates with me
[55:45] because many have started
[55:47] but you see that enduring to the end
[55:50] and this is why when we were preaching
[55:52] on lam trim in time we keep referring
[55:55] it's not about what happened years ago
[55:56] for you
[55:58] it's not about what happened 10 years
[55:59] ago 15 years ago god isn't looking at
[56:02] that experience back then because many
[56:04] started and many were there and many
[56:06] went through that but you see the
[56:07] enduring to the end part
[56:09] the holding faster that which is good
[56:11] part the persevering against all odds
[56:13] part that if everybody else walk away
[56:15] you can hold on pat
[56:18] he that challenge you're to the end so
[56:20] there's a distinction that's being made
[56:22] from those who start the journey
[56:25] you know that song i started on this
[56:27] journey many years ago but i'm going all
[56:31] the way
[56:32] how many want to go all the way this
[56:34] morning i care less what you may do or
[56:37] say but i've made the lord a promise
[56:41] hallelujah but anthony i don't even get
[56:44] seen that at the end
[56:46] that if he will lead away i told him
[56:48] i'll follow
[56:50] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[56:52] preached in all the world for a witness
[56:55] unto all nations and then shall the end
[56:58] come
[56:59] i'm going down to verse 24
[57:02] for there shall arise false christs
[57:05] and false prophets
[57:07] and they shall show great signs and
[57:09] oneness in so much that if it were
[57:12] possible they shall deceive
[57:15] the very elect
[57:18] lord may you add a blessing to the
[57:19] reading of the word and may you speak to
[57:21] us today in the precious name of jesus
[57:23] christ amen and amen you may be seated
[57:26] i know i said i had three scriptures but
[57:28] we'll take them
[57:30] while we're seated i want us to approach
[57:31] [Music]
[57:33] second thessalonians
[57:35] chapter two
[57:37] i'm just laying a background to the
[57:39] message this morning
[57:42] now i want us to appreciate
[57:45] that in paul's ministry
[57:48] paul is exhorting the church
[57:51] and
[57:52] in fact thessalonians the letter to the
[57:54] thessalonians he would not have written
[57:56] himself i would have taught this he
[57:57] would have written it yes but he wrote
[57:59] it he wrote it along with timothy and
[58:01] silas
[58:03] and there would have been a difference
[58:04] in time
[58:06] actually between when
[58:08] first thessalonians was written and
[58:10] second thessalonians
[58:13] some historians say would have been
[58:14] about a period of about two to three
[58:16] weeks or maybe three to four weeks
[58:17] between the two letters reaching into
[58:19] the hands
[58:21] of the believers
[58:22] now if you recall before we read it in
[58:25] first thessalonians
[58:27] we reference very often first
[58:29] thessalonians 4 16 for then the lord
[58:31] shall descend so when you read true
[58:33] first thessalonians a lot of what paul
[58:35] was presenting is about leaving this
[58:37] place
[58:39] about the coming of the lord the first
[58:41] three chapters or so was about the
[58:43] fellowship and so happy he was to see
[58:45] that it was still standing for the fate
[58:47] and all these things and he was kind of
[58:49] just touching bases with them and then
[58:50] by the time he gets to to verse four to
[58:53] chapter four rather he gives a little
[58:55] encouragement and gets down into the
[58:56] coming of the lord
[58:58] and he sort of closes off there
[59:00] somewhere between that letter it is said
[59:03] and
[59:03] and the second
[59:05] some questions kind of arose and this is
[59:07] what led to the position of second
[59:10] thessalonians and when we read chapter
[59:13] two
[59:14] verse one
[59:18] so paul is now addressing a situation
[59:20] now we beseech you brethren by the
[59:22] coming of our lord jesus christ and by
[59:25] our gathering together unto him
[59:28] that ye
[59:29] be not soon shaken in mind or be
[59:32] troubled
[59:34] neither by spirit nor my word nor by
[59:37] letter as from us
[59:38] so paul is saying listen i don't want to
[59:41] get spooked
[59:42] by a word by spirit or even the letter i
[59:45] may have sent to you
[59:47] anybody with me
[59:51] as that the day of the cry of christ is
[59:53] at hand so when people read for the lord
[59:56] shall descend and read these things in
[59:58] that first thessalonians i'm wondering
[59:59] did it happen yet
[1:00:02] did i miss it
[1:00:03] you know what it is to wake up one
[1:00:05] morning and wonder if you missed it
[1:00:07] because people missing and people say
[1:00:09] did the rapture take place
[1:00:11] so paul was beginning to exhort them
[1:00:13] don't get spooked about if the rapture
[1:00:16] took place yet
[1:00:19] and again
[1:00:20] paul is starting to speak just like
[1:00:22] jesus in matthew 24 because he starts
[1:00:24] with the same line in verse 3 let no man
[1:00:27] deceive you
[1:00:30] so we see jesus addressed that issue of
[1:00:32] no man deceiving in matthew and now paul
[1:00:35] is picking it up again let no man
[1:00:37] deceive you by any means
[1:00:39] for that day shall not come
[1:00:42] except there be a falling away first
[1:00:48] paul is saying listen
[1:00:50] don't talk about rapture yet until you
[1:00:52] see your falling away first what is
[1:00:54] falling away mean people who once
[1:00:56] believed
[1:00:58] no longer believe
[1:01:00] people who were once faithful
[1:01:03] no longer faithful
[1:01:05] people who were once holding on decide
[1:01:07] to let go of the rope and say i'm not
[1:01:09] sure this is worth it
[1:01:16] that they shall not come except they
[1:01:17] come up falling away first and that man
[1:01:20] of sin be revealed that son of perdition
[1:01:23] we know who that is
[1:01:25] listen to the description of that man of
[1:01:28] sin the son of perdition
[1:01:30] who oppose it
[1:01:32] and by definition here this is the
[1:01:34] antichrist we're talking about an anti
[1:01:37] in the greek alt it means to oppose and
[1:01:39] replace
[1:01:41] we're getting somewhere this morning a
[1:01:42] little teaching message
[1:01:44] who oppose it which has come against and
[1:01:47] exalted himself above all that is called
[1:01:50] god
[1:01:52] so the objective of lucifer's mission
[1:01:54] his plan is purpose is to oppose and
[1:01:58] replace
[1:02:00] so the devil is not just satisfied to
[1:02:02] come against what you stand for and what
[1:02:04] you want to be the you know he wants to
[1:02:06] replace it
[1:02:08] because this was his whole plan all
[1:02:09] along he was jealous of the worship that
[1:02:12] god got
[1:02:14] anybody with me this morning i'm reading
[1:02:16] the scriptures
[1:02:18] who oppose it and exalted himself above
[1:02:20] all that is called god or that is
[1:02:22] worshipped so that he as god
[1:02:26] sitted in the temple of god
[1:02:29] showing himself that he is god
[1:02:31] so you see what the devil the devil's
[1:02:33] job is that to run governments
[1:02:35] and to run companies and that's that
[1:02:38] that's the petty thing
[1:02:41] that's the simple machinery
[1:02:43] but you see worship
[1:02:44] you see the spiritual side of it and you
[1:02:47] can see why jesus was talking about let
[1:02:48] no man deceive you because they were
[1:02:50] going to come in my name
[1:02:52] but they're coming in my name but they
[1:02:54] are not belonging to me
[1:02:57] so whose name are they really coming in
[1:02:59] if they're coming in my name but they
[1:03:00] don't belong to me and here we see the
[1:03:03] bible talking about except the kind of
[1:03:05] falling away first and that man of sin
[1:03:07] be revealed the son of perdition we're
[1:03:10] getting somewhere
[1:03:12] verse 5 remember he not that when i was
[1:03:14] yet with you i told you these things so
[1:03:17] paul is again reminding them of previous
[1:03:19] conversations
[1:03:20] and now you know what would hold it that
[1:03:23] he might be revealed in his time in
[1:03:24] other words now you're clearing about
[1:03:26] clearing up to you what we're waiting
[1:03:27] for
[1:03:28] for the mystery of iniquity dot already
[1:03:32] work
[1:03:32] there's already iniquity that's working
[1:03:34] already
[1:03:35] the devil has already infiltrated he has
[1:03:37] deceived all
[1:03:39] except
[1:03:41] those names on the book
[1:03:44] everyone will be deceived you know
[1:03:46] in the world in the church even in the
[1:03:48] message
[1:03:50] and i'm gonna heading for that that's
[1:03:51] where my end game is today
[1:03:54] down to the deceived in the message
[1:03:57] who have failed to reproduce the life of
[1:03:59] jesus christ or are not trying to
[1:04:01] produce that life and sit along in a
[1:04:03] message because if you because i have
[1:04:04] books i have tapes i said you're not
[1:04:05] going to message church that all is well
[1:04:07] and when the bible is clear that
[1:04:09] something must be produced
[1:04:11] for you to be identified
[1:04:12] as the elect
[1:04:15] can the church say amen
[1:04:17] i'm building to something
[1:04:19] we're stepping for the mystery of
[1:04:21] iniquity that already work only he who
[1:04:25] out of the downloaded and then shall
[1:04:27] that wicked be revealed whom the lord
[1:04:29] shall consume with the spirit of his
[1:04:31] mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:04:34] brightness of his coming
[1:04:36] even him whose coming is after the
[1:04:38] working of satan with all power and sins
[1:04:41] and lying wonders
[1:04:43] and with all
[1:04:44] deceivableness
[1:04:46] of unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:04:49] because they receive not the love
[1:04:52] of the truth that they might be saved in
[1:04:54] other words there's a truth that allows
[1:04:56] you to be saved but people don't want to
[1:04:58] receive it and they want to accept
[1:05:00] deceit
[1:05:02] for this cause god shall send them
[1:05:06] and this is a warning here a strong
[1:05:09] delusion
[1:05:14] sitting in the message with a strong
[1:05:15] delusion sitting in church with a strong
[1:05:18] delusion
[1:05:20] that they should believe a lie
[1:05:24] that they all might be damned who
[1:05:26] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[1:05:29] in unrighteousness
[1:05:32] may the lord have the blessing to the
[1:05:33] reading of his word
[1:05:35] and i have one scripture that we're
[1:05:36] going to go to before i
[1:05:38] share a few things with you
[1:05:41] this is things that we know but it's
[1:05:42] bringing back to your remembrance and if
[1:05:44] you don't know it it's an opportunity
[1:05:46] for you to sharpen your sword because
[1:05:48] but imam taught us everything must be
[1:05:50] scripturally proven
[1:05:52] brother branham's ministry had to be
[1:05:54] captured in scripture and you must know
[1:05:57] the scriptures that pertain to you to
[1:05:59] your message to your ministry to your
[1:06:01] purpose because outside of that you will
[1:06:03] fail
[1:06:06] you understand whether branham couldn't
[1:06:07] come outside of the bible
[1:06:10] we can't come outside of the bible and
[1:06:12] but ibraheem would say the angel will
[1:06:14] come and when the angel came i had to
[1:06:15] check what he said against the scripture
[1:06:19] dream check against scripture ideas
[1:06:21] checked against scripture your thoughts
[1:06:23] checked against scripture and if it
[1:06:24] can't line up with scripture throw it
[1:06:28] out
[1:06:34] last scripture reading second timothy
[1:06:37] now timothy is the only book that paul
[1:06:39] wrote that's not written to a church
[1:06:42] he writes it to his closest confident
[1:06:46] we would have done a study a bible study
[1:06:48] on timothy to identify that paul would
[1:06:50] have said there was nobody in his
[1:06:52] ministry like timothy
[1:06:54] he almost adopted timothy as his son
[1:06:58] timothy we would have discussed should
[1:06:59] not have made the cut because he was
[1:07:01] offer a sort of mixed marriage as it
[1:07:03] were he was not of the pedigree and
[1:07:05] there was so much against him and he was
[1:07:07] a nervous boy and and all that is
[1:07:09] captured in there
[1:07:12] so this conversation or this letter
[1:07:14] between paul and timothy now bearing
[1:07:16] mind that book we read from
[1:07:17] thessalonians timothy would have been
[1:07:19] party to that letter being written so
[1:07:21] this letter being written that timothy
[1:07:23] is different
[1:07:24] because this is somebody who is in in
[1:07:26] the loop as it were so it's it's it's as
[1:07:28] if a minister is speaking to another
[1:07:30] minister
[1:07:31] and sharing something and we are getting
[1:07:33] privy to that communication between the
[1:07:36] messenger of the age the star of the age
[1:07:38] the apostle of the age this great
[1:07:40] messenger paul who is the gold standard
[1:07:43] upon which every messenger could be
[1:07:45] measured everybody with me this morning
[1:07:48] and he is speaking to his apprentice as
[1:07:50] it were the young minister who would be
[1:07:52] the first pastor of the ephesians church
[1:07:54] that's who timothy was anybody with me
[1:07:56] this morning
[1:07:57] and he's encouraging timothy and he's
[1:07:59] sharing something that is for our day
[1:08:03] second timothy three verse one
[1:08:06] this know also that in the last days
[1:08:09] perilous times shall come
[1:08:15] dangerous times
[1:08:17] will come
[1:08:19] time of stress and trouble is not what
[1:08:21] we're living in now
[1:08:23] has there been any age as stressful as
[1:08:25] this age as much trouble as this age as
[1:08:27] much perplexity and information as this
[1:08:30] age
[1:08:31] verse 2
[1:08:33] for men
[1:08:34] shall be lovers of their own cells
[1:08:40] in the amplified narcissistic
[1:08:42] self-focused
[1:08:45] and technology and social media has
[1:08:47] pushed the world into this concept but
[1:08:49] if it says it casually but it's true
[1:08:52] selfies and these things lovers of
[1:08:54] themselves
[1:08:56] self focus selfish
[1:08:59] we're going somewhere we're in the
[1:09:00] scriptures now
[1:09:03] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:09:05] they don't care about nobody else
[1:09:08] they love themselves more than their
[1:09:09] children more than their families
[1:09:13] love themselves more than god
[1:09:16] loves themselves more than the
[1:09:17] environment
[1:09:18] that's why they could litter and throw
[1:09:20] things into the seas
[1:09:21] because they about themselves
[1:09:23] selfish
[1:09:29] covetous
[1:09:32] lovers of money impelled by greed that's
[1:09:35] what it means
[1:09:36] boasters
[1:09:38] boastful
[1:09:42] and this is in the message now where is
[1:09:43] this in the church you find it here
[1:09:45] because this is part of this last day
[1:09:47] thing
[1:09:49] bosses you're boasting about your
[1:09:50] achievement when you achieve nothing
[1:09:52] because without god you could do nothing
[1:09:58] the moment you take credit for it you
[1:09:59] miss the whole thing there's nothing we
[1:10:01] could take credit for because god didn't
[1:10:03] have to wake you up this morning he
[1:10:04] didn't have to give you a hand a
[1:10:06] musician could take no credit because
[1:10:08] god give you a hand to play if you had
[1:10:10] no hand how you could be a musician what
[1:10:11] credit could you take for anything
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:15] but in the last days
[1:10:18] boosters
[1:10:19] i me my my achievement
[1:10:24] it's a simple message you know we're
[1:10:25] gonna get to something
[1:10:30] boastful
[1:10:31] arrogant that's proud
[1:10:34] proud they don't want to be guided proud
[1:10:36] they don't want nobody tell them and
[1:10:37] they're proud they're proud of their
[1:10:39] achievements
[1:10:42] because of pride
[1:10:44] they don't ask for help
[1:10:47] because of pride they don't seek
[1:10:49] guidance
[1:10:50] because they don't want anybody to
[1:10:51] perceive them less than their station
[1:10:54] they keep themselves trapped and limited
[1:10:56] by limiting beliefs
[1:11:00] anybody this morning
[1:11:02] we're gonna build into something
[1:11:04] proud blasphemous
[1:11:12] disobedient to parents
[1:11:16] how you could ever tell me you and the
[1:11:18] bride and you can't be your parents
[1:11:28] where are you going with that
[1:11:33] is either this thing is real to you or
[1:11:35] if it is not then you're really living
[1:11:36] in deception you know
[1:11:39] outside of this truth you're living in
[1:11:41] deception
[1:11:42] unthankful people can't say thank you
[1:11:46] they're just unappreciative
[1:11:49] you know what the opposite of unthankful
[1:11:51] really is is entitlement you know
[1:11:53] because when you understand gratefulness
[1:11:57] and thankfulness it makes you a thankful
[1:12:00] person when you're entitled somebody or
[1:12:03] or feel entitled you feel because you
[1:12:04] deserve it you're going to be thankful
[1:12:06] for it you know because it's mine
[1:12:09] so you don't acknowledge anybody else
[1:12:10] because you're supposed to have it
[1:12:13] you ask your parents to something and
[1:12:14] they give you because you know why
[1:12:16] they're supposed to give you that's how
[1:12:17] you feel
[1:12:18] and because they did not give you you're
[1:12:20] upset and when they do give you you're
[1:12:22] not thankful because they're supposed to
[1:12:24] do it
[1:12:26] and people walk around life
[1:12:28] ungrateful unthankful because they think
[1:12:31] they deserve it
[1:12:34] so they can't say thank you because
[1:12:35] you're supposed to give it to them
[1:12:38] and you feel a kind of way when things
[1:12:40] don't work out because you're really
[1:12:42] ungrateful and you're unthankful and you
[1:12:45] don't understand you're living with a
[1:12:46] spirit of entitlement
[1:12:49] and you're upset with god because you
[1:12:50] feel god's supposed to do it on your
[1:12:52] time in your way
[1:12:56] and you carry the foolishness from god
[1:12:59] to your home to school to work and we
[1:13:01] live with a culture of ungrateful un
[1:13:05] entitled people
[1:13:07] who can't say thank you
[1:13:12] that's why i said this morning god
[1:13:13] collects thanks
[1:13:18] that's why the bible say in all things
[1:13:20] in everything give them tongues
[1:13:23] everything
[1:13:25] everything
[1:13:26] do have you practice and learn to thank
[1:13:29] god for everything
[1:13:30] i work hard for this job i suppose i
[1:13:32] have it no you just have to thank god
[1:13:34] for the job
[1:13:36] i i work hard for you and how much hours
[1:13:38] i put in studying i don't care how much
[1:13:40] of what you're putting you're supposed
[1:13:41] to do that but in fact you pass the exam
[1:13:43] you have to thank god
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:51] i hope this helps somebody could have
[1:13:53] some spiritual some religious spirit in
[1:13:56] the message
[1:13:57] of behaviors that cannot go over there
[1:14:02] that's what i want to get at you cannot
[1:14:03] go over there you could know the
[1:14:05] mysteries he could understand the vials
[1:14:07] he plays he was he sees women under his
[1:14:09] son you understand all of that but if
[1:14:11] you cannot give thanks
[1:14:13] how he can enter into his presence we
[1:14:15] say enter his gates with thanksgiving
[1:14:19] and he's caught with praise
[1:14:22] you not praising you're not thankful
[1:14:23] because you know you know so much
[1:14:25] already you're already thankful you you
[1:14:27] know
[1:14:29] and your attitude is all twisted and god
[1:14:32] cannot bless you he cannot use you
[1:14:34] because you're not even approaching him
[1:14:35] the right way
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:14:38] help us this morning
[1:14:43] i don't know what's going to happen this
[1:14:44] morning
[1:14:46] trying to watch the time to see
[1:14:49] but i want you to get some help
[1:14:51] i'm i'm not preaching to you and i'm
[1:14:53] preaching to us
[1:14:54] because i have to check myself
[1:14:57] lovers of their own selves
[1:14:59] people want to to build
[1:15:01] this whole nonsense about the church you
[1:15:03] go to and and the pastor and people
[1:15:06] liked it this and they like that listen
[1:15:08] without god everything is nothing you
[1:15:09] know
[1:15:10] people have almost bypassed god and look
[1:15:13] at it but it's because the man studies
[1:15:14] so much or he prays so much that has
[1:15:17] nothing to do with it that is supposed
[1:15:18] to be done but unless god bless and
[1:15:21] unless god open the door and open the
[1:15:23] windows of heaven that is nothing
[1:15:25] without the favor of god you are going
[1:15:27] nowhere
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:37] this scripture this this conversation as
[1:15:40] it were between paul anthony is not a
[1:15:43] speculative conversation this is for
[1:15:46] declaring it as it shall be
[1:15:49] men shall be lovers of themselves
[1:15:52] how many fathers love themselves more
[1:15:55] than their children
[1:15:56] in so much that they miss the
[1:15:58] opportunity to truly be your father
[1:16:06] years ago you'd hear of the days of
[1:16:07] father sacrificing for their children
[1:16:11] you don't hear much more now
[1:16:16] mothers for their daughters
[1:16:20] even children sacrificing for their
[1:16:21] parents oh it goes both ways now
[1:16:24] because you love yourself so much you
[1:16:25] don't care you don't care about your
[1:16:26] parents you cut away from the dead
[1:16:30] no i'm not saying that lightly you know
[1:16:34] it's a spirit you know
[1:16:36] it's a spirit
[1:16:41] because if it's the spirit of god is the
[1:16:42] spirit of lucifer
[1:16:44] is he spiritually deceiver
[1:16:46] the spirit has the behavior has a source
[1:16:49] and that's why you have to know who your
[1:16:51] influence is
[1:16:52] because if whatever it is is not pushing
[1:16:54] you to the life of jesus christ it's
[1:16:56] from the devil
[1:16:58] notice i didn't say pushing the church i
[1:17:00] said push of the literal life of jesus
[1:17:02] christ outside of that
[1:17:05] is he devil or no
[1:17:06] because he talk in itself the life
[1:17:08] itself that's the only thing that
[1:17:09] matters you know all roads that god is
[1:17:12] calling for is leading to that life in
[1:17:14] them to perfect love you know to charity
[1:17:16] you know because that's the only thing
[1:17:17] we'll make it over there only perfect
[1:17:19] love
[1:17:20] [Applause]
[1:17:22] you maybe and sadly no matter how much
[1:17:25] we teach it's not about the church it's
[1:17:27] not about the pastor people still hooked
[1:17:29] because they want to rest their
[1:17:30] confidence on a man
[1:17:35] it is easier to rest your confidence in
[1:17:37] a man saying well because i'm a man
[1:17:38] right i i i want to follow that man and
[1:17:41] where's your life and he's struggling
[1:17:47] paul was so conscious of this that's why
[1:17:50] in humility he said if an angel
[1:17:53] or even me
[1:17:54] because i can't speak what god will do
[1:17:56] or what will happen to my life but if
[1:17:58] they bring another gospel
[1:18:00] from the gospel i present to you no let
[1:18:02] that be a curse
[1:18:04] because paul was so convinced of that
[1:18:06] teaching he said if i come back to you
[1:18:09] with something different and change what
[1:18:11] i say the first time curse me because
[1:18:13] the angel kills everything else because
[1:18:15] this is the truth because this is what
[1:18:16] christ brought us for
[1:18:20] any other gospel there are many other
[1:18:22] gospels that are circling right now
[1:18:24] but we come against every other gospel
[1:18:26] and this gospel that takes us through
[1:18:29] calvary through the cross to the
[1:18:31] wonderful glorious baptism of the holy
[1:18:33] ghost with an experience in your soul
[1:18:36] that burns that snake out of your heart
[1:18:39] and brings you to forgiveness brings you
[1:18:41] to love brings you to the ministry of
[1:18:43] reconciliation
[1:18:44] where seven living voices the fun that

[1:22:15] verse 3 without natural affection
[1:22:21] any amplified as devoid of natural human
[1:22:24] affection callous and inhumane
[1:22:26] i was having a conversation yesterday
[1:22:28] you see the kind of crime taking place
[1:22:29] now
[1:22:32] how painful you see a mother holding a
[1:22:34] child and the bag and abandoned knocked
[1:22:36] and grabbed the bag and a child in
[1:22:38] danger what kind of hat
[1:22:40] and the sad thing is this mother is
[1:22:42] going to work for a living for the child
[1:22:45] and that bozo don't want to work
[1:22:49] don't want to take a day's work well
[1:22:50] wait for her to come home to grab the
[1:22:52] handbag
[1:22:53] that is demonic
[1:22:56] that is demons at work
[1:22:58] and you want to walk the streets without
[1:23:00] the holy ghost
[1:23:04] you want to walk outside the covering
[1:23:05] and trust in what
[1:23:12] i tell you you apply the blood over your

[1:23:20] car
[1:23:21] [Applause]
[1:23:23] because satan know his time is short and
[1:23:25] he's trying to pull souls into his
[1:23:27] kingdom and the same time god is trying
[1:23:30] to raise his elect
[1:23:31] out of this sodom and gomorrah we're
[1:23:33] living in
[1:23:34] god help us this morning to preach
[1:23:36] heaven high and hell hot to have a
[1:23:39] church
[1:23:40] that's without spot or wrinkle
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:23:48] without natural affection
[1:23:50] truth breakers
[1:23:53] breaking agreements
[1:23:55] irreconcilable
[1:23:56] they're not trying to
[1:23:58] to find a middle ground
[1:23:59] false accusers
[1:24:03] there's liars
[1:24:05] incontinent
[1:24:08] malicious gossip in the amplified devoid
[1:24:12] of self-control in temporary losing
[1:24:15] control they have enough they have a
[1:24:16] they're quick to explode
[1:24:20] that's the world and you want to live in
[1:24:21] this world without the holy ghost
[1:24:25] you want to risk
[1:24:26] trying to navigate this hell we're
[1:24:28] walking through with all the holy ghost
[1:24:31] you think your intellectual can navigate
[1:24:34] spirits at work
[1:24:39] when jesus was on the earth the man who
[1:24:41] they call legion
[1:24:44] one man can hold him down no no
[1:24:46] because his spirits upon him made him so
[1:24:48] strong you want to intellectually have a
[1:24:49] conversation with that
[1:24:53] or you want to get your life right with
[1:24:55] god
[1:24:56] that the holy ghost could be pulsating
[1:24:58] to you and the holy ghost is your guide
[1:24:59] is your defense you tell you no don't
[1:25:01] walk down the street no just turn left
[1:25:02] just turn left and you don't even know
[1:25:04] why eternal life you're about to leave
[1:25:06] your home and somebody said not yet and
[1:25:07] then you'll leave now and you'll even
[1:25:09] walk you say leave early today you don't
[1:25:11] know why you're leaving early today but
[1:25:12] god knows what he protecting you true
[1:25:14] and what he guided you through because
[1:25:15] you are the elect
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:18] touch not my anointed the devil knows he
[1:25:21] can't touch the anointed he knows he
[1:25:23] can't touch the elect of god but you
[1:25:24] need to make your calling and election
[1:25:26] show today this morning
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:39] this will have to be part one because
[1:25:40] i'm still in the scripture
[1:25:41] but a popular i read you quoted
[1:25:46] despises of those that are good
[1:25:49] what kind of person despise people who
[1:25:51] are good
[1:25:53] you understand a spiritual limit
[1:25:56] and spiritual forces your son is
[1:25:58] demonology spiritual wickedness in high
[1:26:00] places and you want to walk and say with
[1:26:02] irony message and that is enough
[1:26:09] this is not to scare you know it's to
[1:26:10] get you to run into the arms of god
[1:26:13] run into the act of safety
[1:26:15] and not depend on your ability and your
[1:26:17] strength and all of these things
[1:26:22] verse 4 traitors heavy high-minded
[1:26:24] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:26:28] god
[1:26:33] pleasures
[1:26:34] they love friendship and lyman and
[1:26:37] movies and games and all kind of just
[1:26:40] old talk more than
[1:26:43] lovers of god
[1:26:45] they find all other things that give
[1:26:47] them
[1:26:48] pleasure
[1:26:51] and they can't find pleasure in god
[1:26:53] something is wrong with your journey
[1:26:55] friends
[1:26:56] if you find more pleasure
[1:26:58] in other things
[1:27:00] than in the kingdom of god
[1:27:02] if that is the condition of your soul
[1:27:04] this morning
[1:27:06] would you repent
[1:27:07] would you make it right today
[1:27:09] would you come back in order today
[1:27:14] verse five having a form of godliness
[1:27:19] but denying the power thereof
[1:27:27] that in the amplified says holding to a
[1:27:29] form of outward
[1:27:31] godliness or religion
[1:27:33] although they have denied its power
[1:27:35] for their conduct nullifies their claim
[1:27:38] of faith
[1:27:40] so it's a form on the outside it's an
[1:27:42] expression of it but on the inside it's
[1:27:43] not lining up with it but denying the
[1:27:46] power of the error from such turn away
[1:27:48] for of this sort are they which creep
[1:27:51] into houses
[1:27:53] and lead
[1:27:54] captive silly women
[1:27:57] laden with sins led away by divers lust
[1:28:01] or different lust
[1:28:03] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:28:06] the knowledge of the truth i want us to
[1:28:07] pause there a little bit
[1:28:09] information coming to you you're
[1:28:10] learning new things
[1:28:13] but never coming to the knowledge of the
[1:28:14] truth
[1:28:17] seeking information get it but you're
[1:28:19] never coming to the truth you know
[1:28:21] you know more than last month you know
[1:28:23] but you're nowhere closer to the truth
[1:28:26] because the knowledge you're going after
[1:28:28] what you're learning is all kind of
[1:28:30] other knowledge that's not the truth of
[1:28:31] what you need to know
[1:28:33] are you spending time any word are you
[1:28:35] spending time in the scripture are you
[1:28:36] listening back to tapes or sharpening up
[1:28:38] your sword
[1:28:40] i'm almost done we're going to read this
[1:28:42] scripture here
[1:28:43] now as jonathan jamboree's withstood
[1:28:45] moses so do these also resist the truth
[1:28:48] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[1:28:50] concerning the fate
[1:28:53] so this is talking about
[1:28:55] people who going around doing this dunk
[1:28:57] forth they shall proceed no further for
[1:28:59] their folly shall be manifest unto all
[1:29:01] men as theirs also was
[1:29:04] and paul is saying for dao has fully
[1:29:06] known my doctrine manner of life purpose
[1:29:10] fate long-suffering charity patience
[1:29:14] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[1:29:16] me at antioch and iconium at lystrom
[1:29:19] what persecutions i endured but out of
[1:29:22] them all the law delivered me
[1:29:25] hallelujah
[1:29:26] ye and all that will live godly in
[1:29:28] christ jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:29:32] but verse 13 but evil men and seducers
[1:29:36] shall watch worse and worse and listen
[1:29:39] to this deceiving and being deceived
[1:29:43] now this is this is a mind-blowing
[1:29:46] statement
[1:29:47] so not only are evil men deceiving
[1:29:49] others but they themselves are being
[1:29:51] received
[1:29:55] so you know what it means somebody is
[1:29:56] deceived deceiving others and do you
[1:29:58] even know that they themselves deceived
[1:30:01] you see how horrible that is
[1:30:04] but continue though in the things which
[1:30:06] job has learned and has been a short of
[1:30:08] knowing of whom thou has learned and
[1:30:09] made a lot of the blessing to the
[1:30:10] reading of his word so
[1:30:13] everybody feeling fine
[1:30:15] wonderful so just for a few minutes
[1:30:18] i have a title the great deception
[1:30:21] in the world
[1:30:22] the church
[1:30:23] and the message
[1:30:25] the great deception in the world the
[1:30:28] church and the message with a subject
[1:30:30] discerning the two spirits working in
[1:30:33] the framework of the message and an
[1:30:35] inspiration the elect
[1:30:37] cannot be deceived
[1:30:40] hallelujah so
[1:30:42] just by way of background deception
[1:30:45] is the act of causing someone to accept
[1:30:47] as true or valid what is false or
[1:30:51] invalid
[1:30:53] that's what deception is
[1:30:55] and the devil we know it in the garden
[1:30:57] of eden came down to ask
[1:31:01] but he couldn't reach adam
[1:31:03] because adam
[1:31:04] was a son
[1:31:06] in position
[1:31:07] original creation
[1:31:09] merely the image and likeness of god
[1:31:11] his desire the devil's desire was to
[1:31:14] take control he couldn't get to adam
[1:31:18] he could not deceive adam
[1:31:21] he couldn't penetrate the wall of the
[1:31:23] world
[1:31:24] because brother branham told us adam was
[1:31:26] behind the world he said eve had stayed
[1:31:27] behind the world she would not have been
[1:31:28] deceived so we know the fact that the
[1:31:31] devil could not get to adam meant that
[1:31:33] adam still behind the word
[1:31:35] at no point in time did adam step out
[1:31:37] from behind the word he stayed behind
[1:31:39] the word
[1:31:41] and this is an encouragement to us once
[1:31:42] you stay behind the world the devil
[1:31:44] cannot get you the devil cannot touch
[1:31:46] you but when eve came eve as the
[1:31:49] by-product of
[1:31:51] eve god did not address eve until after
[1:31:53] the fall adam's responsibility was to
[1:31:56] tell eve
[1:31:58] what god told him
[1:32:00] and adam did tell her but when adam was
[1:32:03] not around
[1:32:05] the devil came
[1:32:07] and he had to get the information first
[1:32:10] he said what did god say because he
[1:32:11] didn't know god never spoke with him he
[1:32:13] said what did god say and when he
[1:32:15] revealed it
[1:32:16] there is where deception began
[1:32:19] eve said we could eat out of every tree
[1:32:21] but accept that tree there we cannot eat
[1:32:24] because if we eat there we will die
[1:32:27] and the devil created the first
[1:32:28] deception he said no no no no no if you
[1:32:30] eat of that tree
[1:32:31] it's okay you know you wouldn't die
[1:32:34] and the deception was you could disobey
[1:32:36] god with no consequences
[1:32:39] you could disobey god with no
[1:32:43] retaliation from god as it were
[1:32:46] and eve was deceived
[1:32:48] and fell
[1:32:50] and the deceiver throughout every age
[1:32:52] has continued to deceive
[1:32:54] going after age after age after age
[1:32:57] until the whole world
[1:32:59] is deceived
[1:33:01] it's his job to deceive because deceit
[1:33:04] is how he pulls your attention away from
[1:33:06] god
[1:33:07] the act of causing someone to accept as
[1:33:10] true or valid what is false or invalid
[1:33:14] and this whole world we live in is
[1:33:16] deceived
[1:33:17] but abraham in the message of god of
[1:33:18] this evil is says the world seems to be
[1:33:20] the most evil age it ever was
[1:33:23] never in any age that women act like
[1:33:25] that never but just before the time has
[1:33:28] god lost control
[1:33:29] or is he permitting another agency to
[1:33:32] control i wonder the true answer to this
[1:33:34] question is there's two opposing spirits
[1:33:37] in the world today at work
[1:33:39] but everybody say there can be no more
[1:33:41] than two two heads one of them is the
[1:33:43] holy spirit
[1:33:45] the other one is the spirit of the devil
[1:33:47] in the last days in deception
[1:33:50] so the spirit of the devil is in
[1:33:52] deception
[1:33:54] hallelujah now i'm going to base my
[1:33:56] torch right on here for the rest of the
[1:33:58] text our message the two spirits one of
[1:34:00] them god's holy spirit the other one the
[1:34:03] devil spirit working in deception
[1:34:06] the people of the earth are now making
[1:34:08] their choice
[1:34:10] you see this
[1:34:11] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[1:34:13] bride for christ he is doing it by
[1:34:15] vindicating his word of promise of her
[1:34:18] for this age showing that it is christ
[1:34:24] the devil's unholy spirit
[1:34:27] is here calling his church by error
[1:34:31] so god is calling to the holy ghost but
[1:34:33] the devil is also calling through the
[1:34:35] unholy spirit
[1:34:37] by the spirit of error by perversion of
[1:34:40] the word of god like he did at the
[1:34:42] beginning
[1:34:45] and i'm sharing these friends because
[1:34:46] there are many people in here today and
[1:34:48] there are many who in new mexico are
[1:34:50] different stages because there are three
[1:34:51] levels of deception
[1:34:53] there's deception of the world deception
[1:34:55] of the church deception in the message
[1:34:57] so there are people who are in church
[1:34:59] and they're deceived by the stuff in the
[1:35:00] world cylinder
[1:35:03] and the people who are in church and
[1:35:05] they're received by churches
[1:35:06] and what's happening in the religious
[1:35:08] realm and it doesn't matter to deceive
[1:35:10] any message i don't think i have time to
[1:35:12] get into all of it today but just a
[1:35:13] layer foundation
[1:35:17] the first level of deception of the
[1:35:19] world is you don't need god
[1:35:21] that's the first reception in the world
[1:35:23] on the world level you don't need god
[1:35:25] and we have a world now where people
[1:35:27] depend on science
[1:35:29] and technology
[1:35:31] and computers and information and money
[1:35:34] and success and these things where
[1:35:36] people go after and people say i don't
[1:35:38] need god
[1:35:39] they don't want to hear about god
[1:35:41] as far as they're concerned if they work
[1:35:43] hard and do what he's supposed to do and
[1:35:45] they go down that road in fake success
[1:35:50] fake success
[1:35:52] and because some have money and they can
[1:35:53] pay a doctor they don't need to come and
[1:35:55] pray to god because they can pay the
[1:35:56] doctor
[1:35:58] they live with a mindset you only live
[1:36:00] once
[1:36:01] which is also a lie that's a great
[1:36:02] deception
[1:36:04] because after this there's another
[1:36:05] accounting you have to account for
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:09] so do everything you could do because
[1:36:10] you only live once and enjoy life and
[1:36:13] they don't know they are digging their
[1:36:14] goals straight to hell
[1:36:17] god not in the picture
[1:36:19] they don't quote a god for nothing you
[1:36:21] know when people have never been to
[1:36:23] church never entered a church building
[1:36:29] have no place for god in their lives
[1:36:32] have no consideration that's where these
[1:36:34] brute beasts who walk the earth
[1:36:37] they have no connection to god they
[1:36:39] don't acknowledge god
[1:36:42] whenever i say the fear of the lord is
[1:36:43] the beginning of wisdom
[1:36:46] but that's the world that we in the
[1:36:47] world is deceived and they trust in all
[1:36:49] their machinery and their project
[1:36:51] technology and science and all these
[1:36:52] things
[1:36:56] education and university how many young
[1:36:58] people went to school and get messed up
[1:37:01] grew up in church grew up knowing the
[1:37:03] word and gone and here two courses and
[1:37:05] messed up
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:09] they can't definitely lose their anchor
[1:37:11] with god
[1:37:14] they want you to prove god they want you
[1:37:15] to do this this is this
[1:37:19] what change is deception
[1:37:21] they have just been deceived into a
[1:37:23] delusion
[1:37:25] to accept what is fake as is as if it's
[1:37:28] real and the devil is just happy because
[1:37:31] those are not the ones you worried about
[1:37:34] because if you're not trying to go after
[1:37:36] god you just lost you just haven't you
[1:37:38] the devil already put you you he didn't
[1:37:40] even pay attention
[1:37:42] because the devil is a religious being
[1:37:44] he's a spiritual being
[1:37:46] he really want to sit in the temple of
[1:37:48] god
[1:37:49] so once he gets you to discount god
[1:37:52] completely and live your life without
[1:37:53] god he can leave you in a bucket as
[1:37:56] brood beast walking around the earth let
[1:37:57] me police until you let it thing i knew
[1:37:59] you he not even business with you
[1:38:02] he doesn't have to bring false doctrine
[1:38:04] to somebody who don't know about god
[1:38:07] anybody with me
[1:38:09] there's no great deceit with somebody
[1:38:11] you don't want to hear about god
[1:38:14] there are people who just don't want to
[1:38:16] know about god
[1:38:21] and i have to say you know because i
[1:38:23] know people who are in the message who
[1:38:24] don't believe in god now
[1:38:26] it's
[1:38:28] true so they have fallen for the receipt
[1:38:31] of away from god completely
[1:38:34] they don't hear anything nothing about
[1:38:35] any spiritual being they believe in
[1:38:37] nature
[1:38:39] and the universe
[1:38:40] any planets and they spend all the time
[1:38:42] in that living in scientific realm and
[1:38:46] now you have the metaverse
[1:38:48] and all these new things
[1:38:52] pulling your attention but you realize
[1:38:54] it's either moving closer to god or away
[1:38:56] from god
[1:38:59] [Applause]
[1:39:08] but i brought him in the message a
[1:39:10] thinking man's filter he said has come
[1:39:12] to the whole world has become a great
[1:39:14] deception of what is really true
[1:39:17] and what's right in politics in social
[1:39:19] affairs in school in everything it
[1:39:21] becomes a deceitfulness
[1:39:24] we all have family members loved ones
[1:39:26] they tell them come to church what
[1:39:27] church i want to go to church
[1:39:30] tell people jesus is coming they don't
[1:39:32] want to accept it
[1:39:35] but that's the majority of the world we
[1:39:36] live in
[1:39:38] over the last few years
[1:39:40] every religious group has recorded a
[1:39:42] decrease in people who believe this is
[1:39:44] not just christianity nowhere
[1:39:48] this is the nature of the world as satan
[1:39:50] is making in rules and receiving people
[1:39:53] because if you're not worshipping the
[1:39:54] true god you worship the devil you might
[1:39:56] call it technology you might call it
[1:39:59] science you might call it philosophy you
[1:40:01] might call it psychology you might call
[1:40:02] it new age you might call it nature you
[1:40:05] might call it meditation you might call
[1:40:07] it all kind of different memes
[1:40:10] because while he can go by all those
[1:40:11] names there's only one way to worship
[1:40:13] the true living god and the overcomet
[1:40:16] and now is
[1:40:18] to worship the father in spirit and in
[1:40:20] truth
[1:40:23] [Applause]
[1:40:26] i hope you get it this way but if
[1:40:27] branham can say you can make anything
[1:40:28] your god
[1:40:29] so for some people it's their business
[1:40:31] is the gardener
[1:40:34] and the true god not nowhere in the
[1:40:36] picture you haven't even prayed to god
[1:40:38] but he's spending all your time trying
[1:40:39] to build it in your business god go
[1:40:41] nowhere
[1:40:45] and then you have those who they have
[1:40:47] big success millionaires billionaires
[1:40:50] but what does it profit a man to gain
[1:40:52] the whole world and to lose his soul
[1:40:54] that's in the world they do acknowledge
[1:40:55] god it's their achievement and they have
[1:40:58] all of the books and all the guidance
[1:40:59] and if you don't balance these things as
[1:41:01] a believer you get tied up out there
[1:41:04] because you are under a different
[1:41:04] covenant once you hear this gospel
[1:41:06] you're you're on a different covenant
[1:41:08] you know your life i'm here to break it
[1:41:10] to you or i'm happy to break you your
[1:41:12] life could never be the same once you
[1:41:14] hear this truth
[1:41:16] you have been exposed to too much to go
[1:41:18] to the world and do foolishness
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:23] and god help me i've seen too many young
[1:41:26] people go to school get two certificates
[1:41:28] and feel they don't need god anymore
[1:41:30] and they're born and grew up in the
[1:41:32] message
[1:41:33] they get so qualified they educate
[1:41:35] themselves out of god
[1:41:39] that is why the prophet took the
[1:41:41] position he did you know he wasn't
[1:41:42] against education but if two or three
[1:41:45] degrees will take away from god is best
[1:41:47] is best yeah you have none
[1:41:50] because if god is not the focus of your
[1:41:52] life you're wasting time you are wasting
[1:41:54] time so you have to know your balance
[1:41:57] young people
[1:42:02] if you do not put god first everything
[1:42:04] you do will crumble and fail
[1:42:08] and that law is not one for the world
[1:42:10] this is for you and here i'm talking to
[1:42:11] you
[1:42:12] because you know better
[1:42:14] you know the truth you know what god
[1:42:16] expects from you you move god from
[1:42:19] number one place you will
[1:42:21] find years to get back in place until
[1:42:23] you put him back where he's supposed to
[1:42:25] be but i can guarantee you with
[1:42:27] everything that's in me if god is put in
[1:42:29] his place forget it no weapon no power
[1:42:33] nothing
[1:42:34] could come against you
[1:42:35] [Applause]
[1:42:38] so friends don't get caught up in the
[1:42:40] deception of the world
[1:42:42] living in church and still in the world
[1:42:44] you know by the receptioning world what
[1:42:45] is that the music
[1:42:48] the worldly styles and fashion because
[1:42:50] you're not you're not all the way in
[1:42:51] church
[1:42:52] i'm painting a picture of three levels
[1:42:54] of deception deception in the world any
[1:42:55] church and any message
[1:42:58] people receive in the world and then now
[1:42:59] they're coming to church
[1:43:02] and there are people in all kind of
[1:43:03] church you cannot compare this to any
[1:43:05] other thing friends
[1:43:07] this is not a pentecostal church it's in
[1:43:08] the mediterranean baptist church
[1:43:12] and people have come into the message
[1:43:14] with the baptist ways
[1:43:16] with the methodist ways with the
[1:43:18] pentecostal ways with the catholic ways
[1:43:20] with the worldly ways and hoping that
[1:43:22] the message could conform to these ways
[1:43:28] well the message is not designed like
[1:43:29] that friends
[1:43:30] this message is to bring us closer to
[1:43:32] christ
[1:43:33] than the world has ever gotten before
[1:43:34] outside of jesus walking on the earth
[1:43:36] and that alpha church is to produce an
[1:43:38] omega word pride through a prophet
[1:43:41] messenger that unlocks scriptures that
[1:43:44] were there all along you cannot find
[1:43:46] this in the catholic church you cannot
[1:43:48] find this in a bible study you cannot
[1:43:50] find this in a methodist church i don't
[1:43:52] care how learning the theologian is
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:43:57] hallelujah go to his grace found an
[1:44:00] imperfect vessel to bring a perfect
[1:44:02] message oh you don't hear me this
[1:44:04] morning
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:08] i thank god for the clarity of his word
[1:44:11] you know
[1:44:13] because elijah wasn't perfect moses
[1:44:15] wasn't perfect david wasn't perfect paul
[1:44:18] wasn't perfect
[1:44:21] irene has paul martical number brother
[1:44:23] branham wasn't perfect
[1:44:25] but i brought him you want me to return
[1:44:26] the phone call came by the man i'm
[1:44:28] around outside the house and said tell
[1:44:29] them i'm not here
[1:44:31] and god said oh you could do that what
[1:44:33] kind of behavior is that go to the
[1:44:35] property to be more sincere an imperfect
[1:44:37] man with a perfect message
[1:44:40] hallelujah so i can't be focused any man
[1:44:42] i want to focus any message
[1:44:49] when jesus came i set a heal on his
[1:44:51] sabbath day they say hold this market
[1:44:52] healing but any spiritual man would know
[1:44:55] what to do on his sabbath
[1:44:58] it had people red sabbath field for
[1:45:00] people say i can't follow jesus you know
[1:45:02] because we do on the sabbath day
[1:45:05] and god i said it at the beginning god
[1:45:06] loves to confuse people
[1:45:09] because only the elect
[1:45:11] cannot be deceived god loves to present
[1:45:14] things to people so that you could
[1:45:16] understand truth
[1:45:18] can the church say amen
[1:45:21] so not only is there deception in the
[1:45:23] world but a deception in the church with
[1:45:25] people who actually think that you could
[1:45:27] be uh you could come the church and
[1:45:29] that's okay
[1:45:32] i can't tell you how much people tell me
[1:45:33] you you know i'm a born again you're
[1:45:35] born again well we born again
[1:45:39] and here it's not you the party on
[1:45:41] friday we go in i said well the
[1:45:43] cannabinoid again i am
[1:45:45] it's not that kind of bone again i'm not
[1:45:47] sure
[1:45:48] what kind of bone again you are
[1:45:51] but my kind of bone again is not that
[1:45:53] kind of born again
[1:46:00] it's not that i'm better than nobody
[1:46:01] else but it kinda born again i am
[1:46:04] prevents me from going into that kind of
[1:46:05] place if you're kind of born again let's
[1:46:07] go then that's a different kind
[1:46:09] the can i want is the old-fashioned kind
[1:46:11] of dogo party that don't drink that
[1:46:14] anybody with me this morning
[1:46:18] maybe you and version two or version
[1:46:21] three are they born again but the one i
[1:46:23] want is the original version one the one
[1:46:25] that felony they are pentecost that
[1:46:27] original version
[1:46:29] i don't want to upgrade it he improved
[1:46:31] the modified the altered the water down
[1:46:33] the hybrid and one of the original
[1:46:36] that make peter stagger out of the upper
[1:46:38] room and they want to know if peter
[1:46:40] drunk because it was too early on a
[1:46:42] sunday morning for peter to be drunk
[1:46:46] anybody with me this morning
[1:46:49] [Applause]
[1:46:53] so
[1:46:54] message believers get pressured by
[1:46:56] people in other i don't know what to
[1:46:58] call them denominations groups beliefs
[1:47:01] why you do this why are you dressed so
[1:47:03] why you're thinking and how this message
[1:47:05] and it's when you feel earlier and it's
[1:47:07] a thing as an organizing and you can't
[1:47:09] defend it
[1:47:11] because you can't go into the scripture
[1:47:14] to find out how this thing unfolds
[1:47:18] friends is a warfare you know
[1:47:20] jesus defense in the wilderness wasn't
[1:47:24] spiritual you know it was the order no
[1:47:27] it was scripture you know it was a man
[1:47:29] shall not live
[1:47:34] it was it is written it is written it is
[1:47:36] written can you pass the it is written
[1:47:38] exam
[1:47:40] can you defend your work but it is
[1:47:42] written
[1:47:43] [Applause]
[1:47:50] i was driving the car yesterday and he
[1:47:51] taught coming to me
[1:47:53] i say you know what the devil is a
[1:47:54] better believer than plenty believers in
[1:47:56] him
[1:47:57] because the bible said he devil believe
[1:47:59] and he trembling and people here have
[1:48:01] believed and it's hard to trim
[1:48:02] tribulation
[1:48:06] the devil there's studying scripture and
[1:48:08] reading and trying to find believing and
[1:48:10] he doesn't believe in and you there you
[1:48:12] you want to believe
[1:48:14] is that three kind of believers we have
[1:48:16] trick at the never totally believe
[1:48:19] we are unbelievers make believers and
[1:48:20] true believers
[1:48:25] the devil has been true enough
[1:48:28] all your doubts he don't have it in him
[1:48:32] the devil had doubting what you are
[1:48:34] supposed to get you know
[1:48:37] when you doubt that's a the devil is out
[1:48:39] you know because he know but eventually
[1:48:41] when he encountered that that that that
[1:48:43] wilderness experience it was like votes
[1:48:45] of electricity
[1:48:46] that knocked him out you know
[1:48:49] when jesus came jesus was the greatest
[1:48:51] headache he ever had on him because he
[1:48:53] saw when adam fell he saw david fall he
[1:48:56] saw joshua fall he saw elijah fall but
[1:49:00] when jesus come and he waited for jesus
[1:49:02] to fall he waiting he waiting he waiting
[1:49:06] he waiting he waiting and he's still
[1:49:09] waiting he's still waiting because jesus
[1:49:12] we said it on bible study he conquered
[1:49:15] sin in his flesh brought sin under
[1:49:17] subjection
[1:49:19] tempted as we were but never fell
[1:49:24] did ever say this is different this is
[1:49:26] different let's kill him because we
[1:49:28] don't know what this is you know
[1:49:29] whatever you see something you don't
[1:49:31] understand you want to kill it he said
[1:49:32] let's kill this thing because we don't
[1:49:34] know what it is and when he killed jesus
[1:49:37] oh my it was the biggest mistake he made
[1:49:39] because that is what god was waiting for
[1:49:41] to reproduce himself he said take me to
[1:49:44] calvary before that you see my always
[1:49:46] not yet come but when it was time he
[1:49:48] can't wait he said put a nail in my hand
[1:49:51] it hurt him but it's a bigger picture i
[1:49:53] need to reproduce myself i need to
[1:49:55] multiply myself
[1:50:00] and now we can declare because i live
[1:50:02] you are going to live also
[1:50:04] [Applause]
[1:50:08] can the church say amen hallelujah give
[1:50:11] the lord a shout of praise
[1:50:13] so i am not gonna let nobody deceive me
[1:50:15] if this is not that i'll keep this until
[1:50:18] that comes can the church say amen
[1:50:20] there's no other truth on the earth
[1:50:23] outside of this great message brought by
[1:50:25] malachi 4 god orchestrated everything to
[1:50:30] bring this message to us
[1:50:32] [Applause]
[1:50:35] hallelujah
[1:50:41] you may be seated
[1:50:43] there are many things i will never
[1:50:45] understand
[1:50:46] and there's some things i don't want to
[1:50:47] try to understand because quite frankly
[1:50:50] it's not important
[1:50:52] it's not important
[1:50:55] you know how much things but the brand
[1:50:56] i'm taught
[1:50:57] but there are certain seeds that are for
[1:50:58] the bride
[1:51:00] only for the elect
[1:51:02] there's certain promises but a punch
[1:51:04] that are tied to my body being changed
[1:51:07] you see them kind of thing
[1:51:09] that is the kind of thing i like because
[1:51:11] i could know about rome and the
[1:51:13] ecclesiastical council and i could spend
[1:51:15] all kind of time with that but that is
[1:51:17] not connected to this bodyguaran
[1:51:19] you see missing limbs getting back
[1:51:21] restored and them
[1:51:22] damn kind of thing i'm talking like a
[1:51:24] trini right now you see damn kind of
[1:51:25] thing it's the thing i want because if
[1:51:28] this body fall down i want to get back
[1:51:30] up again the world cultural churches
[1:51:32] have nothing to do with me being
[1:51:34] transformed but give me the promises of
[1:51:37] my family being restored that's what i
[1:51:39] want oh come on now because the devil
[1:51:41] the world council of churches none of
[1:51:43] them can stop your son from coming out
[1:51:46] to the grips of the hands of the devil
[1:51:48] give me the promises of god
[1:51:50] [Applause]
[1:52:00] by these promises we become partakers
[1:52:04] not by the knowledge or the information
[1:52:06] we become partakers but by these
[1:52:08] promises we become partakers of his
[1:52:11] divine nature it's his promise for your
[1:52:13] family it's his promise for your health
[1:52:15] it's his promise for a new body is his
[1:52:17] promise for the holy ghost his promise
[1:52:19] of adoption his promise of perfection
[1:52:22] his promise of a wonderful glorious
[1:52:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:29] [Applause]
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:43] the elect cannot be received
[1:52:46] so the deception in the world can't
[1:52:48] touch the elect
[1:52:51] anybody thanks god
[1:52:53] that they have been chosen to not be
[1:52:55] deceived by the technology and the
[1:52:58] systems and the education and the
[1:52:59] degrees
[1:53:02] you may be seated
[1:53:04] i have my degree you know but it
[1:53:06] couldn't take the god i was in my heart
[1:53:09] when i went to the university i operate
[1:53:11] a certain way the god i was in my heart
[1:53:13] took me through my degree i pick up my
[1:53:15] paper i woke up with my paper but the
[1:53:18] jesus in my heart he is still there and
[1:53:20] then lose my joy lose my testimony no no
[1:53:24] no no no no no and it's not me keeping
[1:53:26] myself it was his grace his grace his
[1:53:29] grace was greater his grace was greater
[1:53:32] than my strength his grace was greater
[1:53:34] than my understanding his grace was
[1:53:36] greater and he is able to preserve you
[1:53:39] in your school in your job
[1:53:42] you may be seated
[1:53:44] i've seen too many people get a job they
[1:53:46] say lord bless me with a job and they
[1:53:48] get a job and they can't find them in
[1:53:50] church
[1:53:51] you know what that means is the world
[1:53:52] receive them you know it's not doctrine
[1:53:54] it's not it's not false teaching
[1:53:58] years in a message and they can't find
[1:54:00] themselves back in church
[1:54:04] so foundational deception got them
[1:54:07] they have no time
[1:54:10] there's only time they're caught up
[1:54:12] working hard they're working hard
[1:54:13] they're working hard they're working
[1:54:14] hard they're working out they're working
[1:54:15] hard for what
[1:54:17] for what
[1:54:19] to what end to what purpose
[1:54:25] but i thank god for you who are here
[1:54:27] because you are here
[1:54:28] you're in church immediately to this
[1:54:30] spot we're gonna go a little deeper but
[1:54:32] we made it to this spot you made it to a
[1:54:34] spot where you recognize that without
[1:54:36] god you can't do nothing
[1:54:38] am i right that without god you can't
[1:54:40] make it am i right is there anybody who
[1:54:42] feels that way without god you have no
[1:54:44] hope without god you can't go to work
[1:54:46] tomorrow without god you don't know how
[1:54:48] to start your day without god you know
[1:54:50] how we are going to make it
[1:54:53] so we have moved past the deception in
[1:54:55] the world and we are contending for the
[1:54:58] deception in the church and moving now
[1:55:00] to the deception in the message
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:06] you may be seated
[1:55:08] a few more minutes
[1:55:09] not every teaching is for the elector
[1:55:12] there are nice christians out there in
[1:55:14] nice churches
[1:55:15] what can an evangelical church of god in
[1:55:17] christ and all kind of wonderful
[1:55:19] behaviors
[1:55:20] and listen the thing is we can't elect
[1:55:22] nobody
[1:55:23] i can't elect you you can elect me god
[1:55:26] does the election
[1:55:27] so i cannot get upset with somebody
[1:55:29] because they're not elected
[1:55:31] it is not my place to judge your
[1:55:33] election i just have to preach you word
[1:55:35] that speaks to those who are the elect
[1:55:37] because they elect like a certain kind
[1:55:39] of food
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:43] the elect like to eat a certain kind of
[1:55:45] food
[1:55:47] and are working on me because i'm an
[1:55:50] expert at food so i woke up but i
[1:55:52] understand the difference between good
[1:55:53] food and bad food
[1:55:55] it's a different between a little rice
[1:55:56] and peas but when you add a little salad
[1:55:58] add a little a little meat and a little
[1:56:00] pie and a little i like christmas he had
[1:56:03] a pastel and he added a little potato
[1:56:05] salad and a scalloped potato and what
[1:56:08] else is there will it have some little
[1:56:09] smoke ribs
[1:56:11] i wonder too what else is there because
[1:56:14] nothing shall pass by the punch nothing
[1:56:16] nothing i have to do all the work but
[1:56:18] nothing shall pass even on the menu i
[1:56:20] want it even if it isn't good i want it
[1:56:23] come on now because if this is prepared
[1:56:26] at the table for me by the heavenly
[1:56:28] father who is the master chef put out a
[1:56:31] whole food course
[1:56:32] [Applause]
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:39] why
[1:56:40] settle you maybe see that
[1:56:43] for some people is is peace and rice one
[1:56:45] day then rice and peas
[1:56:47] and the third is peace with rice next
[1:56:49] year's peace and rice
[1:56:53] but you see the elect
[1:56:56] the food that has been sorted for this
[1:56:57] age is the food brother pop well that
[1:57:00] they cooked in the first age that kind
[1:57:02] of food plus the food from the second
[1:57:04] age plus the money from the turret age
[1:57:06] plus the money from the fourth age plus
[1:57:08] the menu and in this great banquet
[1:57:11] we can eat from anywhere
[1:57:14] eat at any time every sunday we come we
[1:57:17] can take some addition take some of that
[1:57:19] fat some family virtue knowledge
[1:57:22] temperance don't leave this morning

[1:57:45] this is a controversial statement
[1:57:47] but i'm not sure about dieting in the
[1:57:49] bible because the bible said they shall
[1:57:51] eat and plenty
[1:57:52] and be satisfied so i'm telling you you

[1:58:48] my robin message and i said by the grace
[1:58:51] of god
[1:58:52] last year somewhere is 25 years

[1:58:56] all kind of thing i've seen
[1:58:58] i used to be like a new kid in a block
[1:59:02] but now i'm feeling like i'm getting on
[1:59:04] a little older side
[1:59:05] a little bit
[1:59:07] i feel like
[1:59:12] for five years i was a 16 year old
[1:59:14] preacher
[1:59:16] but as i getting a little older now i
[1:59:18] can start to say like david i was young
[1:59:20] and now i'm old but i've never seen the
[1:59:22] righteous forsaken this thing's still
[1:59:24] eating good it is all over me it is
[1:59:27] keeping me alive it is joy unspeakable
[1:59:30] and this thing has room for your family
[1:59:32] for your children for those that are
[1:59:34] around you because it promises unto you
[1:59:36] and your children and to them that are
[1:59:38] far off as many as the lord shall call
[1:59:41] and you are the supposed to be the
[1:59:43] witnesses unto me
[1:59:44] [Applause]
[1:59:46] oh i'm trying to get out of the pulpit
[1:59:48] but god help me this morning oh give me
[1:59:51] the old-fashioned sin killing sky blue
[1:59:55] holy ghost revival
[1:59:58] [Music]

[2:00:07] full share of mistakes not my fair share
[2:00:09] you know no full share of mistakes i
[2:00:11] make my full of mistakes but god's
[2:00:13] grace has kept me i didn't keep myself i
[2:00:16] couldn't bring myself to church i have
[2:00:18] to repent daily as we all have to repent
[2:00:20] dearly but god knows my heart i'm
[2:00:23] looking for a city whose builder and
[2:00:25] maker is god i'm looking for perfection
[2:00:27] i'm looking for oh come on now i'm
[2:00:30] waiting for those seven thunders to
[2:00:31] utter their voices to that group and i
[2:00:34] believe i'm part of that group i believe
[2:00:38] i'm part of that
[2:00:42] [Applause]
[2:00:46] you may be seated
[2:00:47] [Music]
[2:00:49] abraham wasn't perfect
[2:00:51] david wasn't perfect joshua wasn't
[2:00:54] perfect elijah wasn't perfect
[2:00:56] isaiah wasn't perfect
[2:00:58] peter wasn't perfect john wasn't perfect
[2:01:01] paul wasn't perfect but abram wasn't
[2:01:03] perfect but jesus was perfect and he
[2:01:06] says beep therefore perfect as your
[2:01:08] father in heaven is perfect and the
[2:01:10] bible says they who have gone before
[2:01:13] without us
[2:01:15] listen
[2:01:16] in that sentence structure they
[2:01:19] cannot come to
[2:01:20] perfection without asana
[2:01:23] we become the perfection that they could
[2:01:26] not achieve oh god help me this morning
[2:01:29] when this pride comes to perfection
[2:01:31] it'll be so perfect it'll be so close
[2:01:34] that it'll be enough perfection to cover
[2:01:36] for they
[2:01:38] who are without us
[2:01:39] cannot be made perfect so when we
[2:01:41] connect to the whole body all the loose
[2:01:44] gaps in the body will be sealed off by
[2:01:46] this end time pride by a perfect message
[2:01:49] oh help me help me this morning
[2:01:52] somebody give god a shout our praise
[2:01:58] come on brian lift your head up
[2:02:00] square your shoulders come on you
[2:02:03] for such a time as this this is your
[2:02:06] time this is your season this is your
[2:02:08] hour this is what we have been waiting
[2:02:10] for
[2:02:12] [Applause]
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:21] you have escaped the great deception in
[2:02:23] the world you have escaped the deception
[2:02:25] in the church
[2:02:34] the message has to be rejected
[2:02:37] christ had to be rejected but a brand of
[2:02:40] message has to be rejected
[2:02:42] even people in the message have to
[2:02:43] reject it because that's falling away
[2:02:45] that has happened first before god could
[2:02:48] come people have been exposed to the
[2:02:50] truth and they can't see the truth no
[2:02:51] more
[2:02:52] when in reality is they don't want to
[2:02:54] live up to the life standard
[2:02:58] remember branham says things like so
[2:03:00] sweet and humble
[2:03:05] so sweet so humble so gentle attractive
[2:03:08] holy ghost you at your behavior without
[2:03:11] a transformation could produce that
[2:03:13] that's not intellectual
[2:03:15] that's not figuring it out that is you
[2:03:17] getting so much into the spirit
[2:03:19] and yielding to the spirit and the holy
[2:03:21] ghost taking control your vessel your
[2:03:24] lamb so filled that your way of doing
[2:03:26] things which has failed no longer is
[2:03:29] even necessary because the holy ghost
[2:03:31] does the work
[2:03:33] all god wants is for us to get out of
[2:03:35] the way you know
[2:03:37] you driving i got your god let me take
[2:03:39] over the connor
[2:03:43] right now some of us have jesus as a
[2:03:44] backseat driver
[2:03:48] and he want to drive the car
[2:03:50] he wants you to come out of the driver's
[2:03:51] seat
[2:03:52] and you sit down and shut up
[2:03:54] and just worship and thank god you want
[2:03:56] to tell god turn here turn here no
[2:03:58] attorney i want this job i want this job
[2:04:00] i don't have ex
[2:04:01] oh my god say but i don't want you have
[2:04:02] that job
[2:04:05] you see god talks to us without using
[2:04:07] these words you know by allowing things
[2:04:09] to happen that you want to happen and by
[2:04:11] shutting down things you don't want to
[2:04:12] happen god always talking to us
[2:04:15] let me say that one more time god had to
[2:04:17] come audibly and say my son don't take
[2:04:20] that job no
[2:04:21] but when your job gets rejected there's
[2:04:24] god saying that wasn't for you
[2:04:26] so whenever something don't happen that
[2:04:28] you want to happen you should be the
[2:04:30] first person to be jumping and shouting
[2:04:35] you trying to buy a car and you're
[2:04:37] getting through the bank saying no watch
[2:04:39] now started jumping
[2:04:41] because the car you're trying to buy is
[2:04:43] too small
[2:04:45] god wants to get a bigger one
[2:04:48] oh you you need to reframe your thinking
[2:04:50] you know who your father is so don't get
[2:04:52] depressed when things don't work out
[2:04:53] when i was trying to get a loan i was
[2:04:55] trying to get at this and i'm so
[2:04:56] depressed because my church is your vex
[2:04:58] you're just getting even it taking your
[2:05:00] 47 minutes to get in the spirit
[2:05:03] the preacher has to walk punch and punch
[2:05:05] punching punching punching for you to
[2:05:07] finally snap out what happened last week
[2:05:09] for you to say well thank god jesus died
[2:05:11] for me all that work because you can't
[2:05:13] separate the voice of god in your life
[2:05:15] every day by allowing things you know
[2:05:17] nothing is accident with god nothing
[2:05:19] could come your way unless god allow it
[2:05:24] it's time we act more mature there's no
[2:05:27] mistake with god
[2:05:28] what you're supposed to have you will
[2:05:30] have it and what you're not supposed to
[2:05:31] have you're not going to get it thank
[2:05:33] god in everything give him thanks
[2:05:40] i don't know who this helping this
[2:05:41] morning i'm trying to close out
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:50] so we have moved past the deception of
[2:05:51] the world and the school and the
[2:05:53] education and my professor
[2:05:55] i remember when i was in primary school
[2:05:57] i said come back home
[2:05:58] and every time i was very pleased with
[2:06:00] my standard five teacher
[2:06:02] and for those who don't know me i was a
[2:06:04] very good student
[2:06:05] so i would come home
[2:06:07] and the first thing i would say is
[2:06:09] cersei
[2:06:11] every day was cersei seriously and tell
[2:06:13] my parents he just don't even come here
[2:06:15] without saying anything
[2:06:18] a little bit again still become the
[2:06:20] gospel yes because we're looking at this
[2:06:22] everything cersei
[2:06:23] said to cersei distance this is anything
[2:06:26] with life and he was a very good teacher
[2:06:28] really really fantastic and he was so
[2:06:30] good ever and he was a christian so he
[2:06:32] was he was inclined to listen to him but
[2:06:33] something he was saying was wrong not
[2:06:35] scriptural but cersei and cersei that's
[2:06:38] he better stop that seriously better put
[2:06:39] it down right away pick it up
[2:06:44] it's so easy if you're not being guided
[2:06:46] to fall into a trapping
[2:06:49] because listen that's how deceptive it's
[2:06:51] so logical it does make sense it if it
[2:06:53] don't make sense you wouldn't go for it
[2:06:58] look i hear somebody do a whole long
[2:07:00] teaching on joseph
[2:07:02] this is mary and joseph and jesus a
[2:07:04] whole teaching on joseph stuff that not
[2:07:06] written know any bible
[2:07:08] and somebody who was there say you hear
[2:07:10] what you say
[2:07:11] i say he filling in blanks they're not
[2:07:13] even there
[2:07:16] because you know i'm a student of
[2:07:17] scripture so i'm like i don't know where
[2:07:18] you find that and he said yeah but i
[2:07:20] hope called us that i say yeah you're
[2:07:21] right
[2:07:23] but what he said so nice it sounds real
[2:07:25] nice you know he do a whole analysis of
[2:07:27] joseph and analyze joseph and i say but
[2:07:30] that is not nowhere in the bible
[2:07:33] but it sounded very nice
[2:07:35] and if you don't take the time to study
[2:07:39] and listen to the word and take over the
[2:07:42] tv and take off the netflix and take out
[2:07:43] the radio and you know the same radio
[2:07:46] listen to a good point like an audio
[2:07:47] team funding right or i know all the
[2:07:49] technology you could play any profit
[2:07:50] message you could play all i know these
[2:07:52] things right i just making sure because
[2:07:54] some people did somehow they call it
[2:07:56] somebody listen to everything else
[2:07:58] it's two hours of cnn
[2:08:02] and they can tell me all the things in
[2:08:04] gaza strip and the ching and the
[2:08:11] this tsunami and thing and what's not
[2:08:14] chronological order
[2:08:20] tell me two scriptures you read this
[2:08:21] week well i ain't nothing too much
[2:08:23] reading or i was really listening listen
[2:08:24] well listen to the bible
[2:08:32] this age is really easier in many ways
[2:08:34] you know
[2:08:35] i was driving this morning to church
[2:08:37] listening to these scriptures these same
[2:08:38] scriptures that i read this morning i
[2:08:40] kept playing these three scriptures over
[2:08:42] and over any card that's all i did whole
[2:08:43] trip up to the church
[2:08:45] i played matthew 24 i played this
[2:08:48] christian
[2:08:51] the whole trip that's what i'm doing
[2:08:53] playing it over and over and over
[2:08:55] if not i didn't read it before but i
[2:08:57] want this thing to be in me
[2:09:00] every word i want it to be in me
[2:09:02] i can listen to the news i can listen to
[2:09:04] music you have choices
[2:09:06] that's how i i'm not telling you that's
[2:09:07] what you do all the time but you have
[2:09:08] choices
[2:09:10] people load music on their phone and
[2:09:11] they're there with a headphone and and
[2:09:13] they had fun on the ting and thing and
[2:09:14] thinking what you listen to and work
[2:09:18] how do you want to grow i want to stay
[2:09:19] in spirit because i said it before i
[2:09:21] could guarantee you you kind of been
[2:09:23] listening to a spoken word tape or a
[2:09:24] song and then end up casting out your
[2:09:26] next door position any work
[2:09:28] it is too big of a
[2:09:30] leap the leap is too big you have to
[2:09:33] already be holy spirit to reach that
[2:09:35] level if you're up here you would just
[2:09:36] look at them and just feel sad and pray
[2:09:38] for them
[2:09:40] because your in your spirit
[2:09:43] but you dear you listening to conscious
[2:09:45] music you want to be conscious or i
[2:09:46] don't know what
[2:09:48] i don't know what they call it now out
[2:09:49] three loop on these things
[2:09:52] but whatever it is now that you want to
[2:09:53] listen to that keep you positive this is
[2:09:55] your workout you you walk in and people
[2:09:57] walk people walk in and exercise
[2:09:58] exercising great exercise but what are
[2:10:00] you listening to
[2:10:04] because what you eat is what you
[2:10:05] becoming now
[2:10:09] i heard somebody say recently i really
[2:10:11] like it because i like stuff that helps
[2:10:12] you live life we have too much spiritual
[2:10:15] religious people who don't know how to
[2:10:16] balance it for every life and he says
[2:10:18] jesus says man shall not eat by bread
[2:10:20] alone but by every word that we said
[2:10:22] ultimately god
[2:10:23] no this is not scripture i've given you
[2:10:25] what i want to say no but this makes
[2:10:27] sense and i like it because i see i will
[2:10:28] do it for myself
[2:10:30] he said how much time he'd have spent
[2:10:32] eating when he did come
[2:10:34] he says you might eat breakfast you
[2:10:35] might smell like eating lunch you might
[2:10:37] isn't it he said if you spend time in a
[2:10:39] day eating
[2:10:40] and you're spiritual
[2:10:42] what you consume spiritually is not at
[2:10:45] least that's something wrong
[2:10:47] because you eat to live
[2:10:48] so jesus imagine not live by bread alone
[2:10:51] so what you consume alone but by the
[2:10:53] words so he said god was typing eaten
[2:10:56] naturally with your spiritual sustenance
[2:11:00] so you need your natural sustenance to
[2:11:02] live what about your spiritual
[2:11:03] sustenance so you spend 10 minutes on
[2:11:05] breakfast 50 minutes in breakfast half
[2:11:06] an hour on lunch half an hour on think
[2:11:09] so it just been a hour and a half in
[2:11:11] eaton
[2:11:12] could you commit a hour and a half
[2:11:14] in eating spiritual food
[2:11:18] could you have the discipline because
[2:11:20] everybody as far as i know discipline
[2:11:22] breakfast up breakfast ready at lunch
[2:11:25] what time is lunch what time is lunch
[2:11:27] lunch already yet
[2:11:29] discipline you've got to push them to
[2:11:30] get disciplined
[2:11:35] but who can say let me go and time to
[2:11:37] pray let us let us pray time to read the
[2:11:39] bible
[2:11:42] can we become that discipline so what
[2:11:44] you consume that drives your life
[2:11:47] becomes both natural because you need
[2:11:49] bread
[2:11:50] god wasn't saying don't eat bread you
[2:11:51] say man shall not live by bread alone so
[2:11:53] you need the bread but you need a word
[2:11:55] that proceed out in the mouth of god as
[2:11:56] well
[2:11:58] but where's the balance especially in
[2:12:00] this day that trying to take away your
[2:12:02] time
[2:12:05] your time you're going to work your time
[2:12:06] you're working at home your time you're
[2:12:08] doing this and and you don't make people
[2:12:10] don't want to make time to pray
[2:12:12] they don't want time to make to read the
[2:12:13] bible but they get to be first thing on
[2:12:15] facebook
[2:12:16] or youtube or tech talk or instagram and
[2:12:19] the list will keep going on and on
[2:12:20] because the devil have a factory
[2:12:22] manufacturing time waste and tools
[2:12:27] all of them have one agenda you know
[2:12:29] it's not entertainment it's time
[2:12:31] to take away your time for worship god
[2:12:33] that's what it really is
[2:12:35] i'm not saying at all that please they
[2:12:36] purpose the objective you know but if
[2:12:38] you can't find time for god that helps
[2:12:40] you censor by bringing a policeman on
[2:12:42] the inside what you're doing with the
[2:12:44] rest of your time then you're out of
[2:12:45] control
[2:12:46] [Applause]
[2:12:50] and that's a deception i'm trying to
[2:12:51] bring a place to a close here so the
[2:12:53] deception in the message now
[2:12:55] the musician can begin to come
[2:12:59] people now have their own message and
[2:13:01] because they have the books and the
[2:13:02] tapes they are comfortable
[2:13:04] that that is what it takes to make it
[2:13:07] you know
[2:13:09] you'd be surprised how many people just
[2:13:10] believe because i in the message i'm
[2:13:12] making it
[2:13:14] and that's the reception
[2:13:17] and it gets worse now
[2:13:18] and i want to address a few things with
[2:13:20] this
[2:13:20] especially not doing this pandemic
[2:13:23] because a lot of people know who
[2:13:25] they they they want to connect here
[2:13:27] connect here connect these are
[2:13:28] connectors it's like the old tfct
[2:13:30] connection board thing they plug in here
[2:13:32] they plug in here they plug in here they
[2:13:33] plug in here no accountability they
[2:13:36] under no pastor
[2:13:37] which rapture you go into
[2:13:40] when god say i'll give you pastors to
[2:13:41] feed you
[2:13:46] i'm addressing the church here but i'm
[2:13:47] also bringing to a level of
[2:13:48] consciousness of the deception in the
[2:13:50] message
[2:13:51] because the five-fold ministry has a
[2:13:53] purpose for the perfecting of these sins
[2:13:57] so you cannot be perfected by listening
[2:13:59] to a tip
[2:14:04] a tape is a tool it's an element it's a
[2:14:06] transfer device but god has a plan
[2:14:08] that's why you have ministers
[2:14:11] now i cannot be held responsible for
[2:14:13] ministers who doing craziness
[2:14:15] so you kind of put a blanket statement
[2:14:17] that we supposed to listen to tapes and
[2:14:19] i see only way to do it because
[2:14:20] everybody wrong that cannot that car cut
[2:14:22] it
[2:14:23] because whether god have one two three
[2:14:25] five around the world ten fifteen twenty
[2:14:27] that's for him to know
[2:14:29] because my job is not to evaluate any
[2:14:31] other minister
[2:14:32] my accountability is to my heavenly
[2:14:34] father
[2:14:36] let me
[2:14:37] anybody with anybody with me this
[2:14:38] morning the connection we have as a
[2:14:40] local sovereign church is vertical in
[2:14:42] them
[2:14:44] our accountability is a gardener
[2:14:47] so once god is pleased brother didn't
[2:14:49] know what i'm gonna preach today you
[2:14:50] know
[2:14:56] he has confidence in the vertical
[2:14:57] connection
[2:15:01] that i getting fed from above
[2:15:03] because if i do have my own plug
[2:15:06] then we're in trouble
[2:15:10] and you know you have to get your own
[2:15:11] plug aha
[2:15:14] you know you have to get your own
[2:15:15] connection
[2:15:17] i am the vine you are the branches oh oh
[2:15:19] so there comes a point where the
[2:15:21] ministry is until
[2:15:23] we all come there's a limit on the
[2:15:25] ministry you know but the ministry has a
[2:15:27] purpose
[2:15:29] so i want to challenge you know of the
[2:15:31] deception and the message with people
[2:15:32] who said i'm saying well i hear play any
[2:15:34] profit tapes home
[2:15:35] that take anywhere
[2:15:39] it's important to pay the profit tax but
[2:15:40] what church are you in and who is your
[2:15:42] pastor
[2:15:43] because you have to be held to account
[2:15:46] so people sit along at home deceived for
[2:15:48] years
[2:15:51] not under any accountability
[2:15:53] not no they don't want the discipline of
[2:15:55] being held to account by the ministry
[2:15:57] that god put in place
[2:16:00] they're not paying tithes to nowhere
[2:16:03] they have no home church
[2:16:08] but any message and they're quick to say
[2:16:10] well they should be playing tapes every
[2:16:12] sunday too and comedy pulpit really
[2:16:16] deception and the message
[2:16:19] and then you have those who
[2:16:21] when you go through the message the
[2:16:23] empire king buildings
[2:16:26] that believe you already have one if it
[2:16:28] will shoot this one man this one chill
[2:16:30] just one group
[2:16:31] at telling your church friends don't
[2:16:32] follow me you know
[2:16:35] you see the holy ghost
[2:16:37] but obviously this is not to over church
[2:16:39] you know
[2:16:40] this is the lord's church
[2:16:43] and if by his grace i'm standing here
[2:16:46] follow me only as i follow christ
[2:16:49] because i
[2:16:51] i want to be clear you have you have
[2:16:53] deception any message but but if it's
[2:16:55] not true that church or you're not
[2:16:56] connected to this one or this one that
[2:16:58] you can't make it where is that in the
[2:16:59] word you remember that brandon said any
[2:17:01] church that claimed that it false
[2:17:05] that's any prophet message
[2:17:07] and they have people walking around
[2:17:08] saying well because i am in this church
[2:17:09] or i'm in that church oh i believe this
[2:17:11] and this person is my apostle or my
[2:17:13] pastor or whatever friends brother
[2:17:16] branham was a messenger of this age
[2:17:19] just as paul was a message of his age
[2:17:22] but ibrahim was not in the fightful
[2:17:23] ministry he was above the father
[2:17:25] ministry he was a star in the right hand
[2:17:27] of god
[2:17:28] the prophet that is describing the five
[2:17:30] well it's not messenger status we're
[2:17:31] talking about you know
[2:17:33] god but it brought me to the work of me
[2:17:34] and of an evangelist until he was
[2:17:36] operating as prophet but he was a star
[2:17:38] he was a messenger he was above the
[2:17:39] fivefold
[2:17:41] but it's only fivefold it's held to
[2:17:43] account to god you know there's no
[2:17:45] between the prophet and the ministry you
[2:17:47] know
[2:17:49] and these are the deceptions in the
[2:17:51] message that this brother so and so or
[2:17:54] that brother so and so or this version
[2:17:56] or this doctrine or this teaching and
[2:17:57] everybody believe it this way
[2:17:59] and this mystery that needs to be
[2:18:01] unfolded what was brother branham
[2:18:02] message to do not unfold every mystery
[2:18:06] and when god finished with somebody
[2:18:07] doesn't he take them off the earth
[2:18:09] so if brother branham wasn't finished
[2:18:10] wouldn't god have left him to finish it
[2:18:12] so isn't it the fact that byron is gone
[2:18:14] meant his job is over
[2:18:16] so isn't every mystery laying any books
[2:18:18] and tapes and don't we all have access
[2:18:20] by the spirit to go into the books and
[2:18:21] tapes and find out what's applicable to
[2:18:24] us
[2:18:25] [Applause]
[2:18:31] so i'm challenging us and as paul taught
[2:18:34] his followers at the time he said follow
[2:18:36] me as i follow christ you know in other
[2:18:38] words hold me to account by going to the
[2:18:40] same book the same scriptures and
[2:18:42] fortifying yourself by the word per
[2:18:44] adventure i say something and they could
[2:18:46] come to me and have a conversation
[2:18:47] around it so we can make sure we say any
[2:18:48] right thing and brother branham taught
[2:18:50] us how to address all these things you
[2:18:51] see if something is said to understand
[2:18:53] then let's have a conversation around
[2:18:55] the world
[2:18:59] but in the message we have people who
[2:19:01] are comfortable
[2:19:04] that well are connected or in this
[2:19:06] church and they have no worship remember
[2:19:08] the brandon taught us if there's no
[2:19:09] worship there's no god
[2:19:11] no opening of the world relevant to that
[2:19:14] specific local church at a particular
[2:19:15] point in time
[2:19:17] there's nothing wrong with playing a
[2:19:18] team there's nothing wrong with
[2:19:19] listening to somebody
[2:19:20] that's not the issue but the reality is
[2:19:23] i better offer the ministry but anthony
[2:19:25] but it's even we have a responsibility
[2:19:26] to this local church
[2:19:28] i'm not being measured by the success of
[2:19:29] any other group
[2:19:31] we have a responsibility to preach
[2:19:33] heaven high and hell hot and for you to
[2:19:35] understand the levels of deception in
[2:19:37] the world so you can be driven to the
[2:19:39] holy ghost not to hesitate tabernacle
[2:19:40] but to god himself
[2:19:42] because that is your husband i'm not
[2:19:44] your husband he is your husband
[2:19:48] and by the branham was like eliezer just
[2:19:50] to catch the attention of a bride to
[2:19:52] introduce her to her husband
[2:19:55] is he waiting for you you know anna
[2:19:57] waiting for you know is he waiting for
[2:19:58] you
[2:19:59] and every message every service is to
[2:20:01] bring us closer to preparation to being
[2:20:04] able to leave this place can we change
[2:20:06] same man
[2:20:07] [Applause]
[2:20:11] deceived in the message being
[2:20:13] comfortable to know but not prepared to
[2:20:16] live
[2:20:17] so we know about broadly kindness you
[2:20:18] know
[2:20:19] but we are doing it
[2:20:22] we have oats
[2:20:24] we have grudges
[2:20:27] believers in the message what's not the
[2:20:29] message has the
[2:20:30] the award
[2:20:33] for the most amount of people who can't
[2:20:34] shake hands
[2:20:36] in the message itself
[2:20:40] we win the award
[2:20:41] worldwide this is not true
[2:20:42] nanotechnology worldwide
[2:20:46] because he don't believe it so and she
[2:20:47] believes so on this doctrine and this
[2:20:49] teaching and this teaching and this
[2:20:50] teaching and and people cannot agree
[2:20:53] on the same one message well i hate to
[2:20:54] break it to you everybody cannot be
[2:20:56] right if they read it from the same as
[2:20:58] you'll not have a different
[2:20:58] interpretation
[2:21:00] it cannot be better punch everybody
[2:21:02] right
[2:21:03] because there can be 15 weeks for this
[2:21:04] thing and only god is the interpreter of
[2:21:06] his word
[2:21:07] there has to be one way that we leave in
[2:21:09] this place
[2:21:11] and we have to all fight for that one
[2:21:13] way
[2:21:14] and i made it clear he said perfect love
[2:21:17] you say the holy ghost itself the person
[2:21:20] of christ
[2:21:21] it can't be true me a cabbage from
[2:21:22] minister it has to be your relationship
[2:21:24] with god that's the truth
[2:21:27] [Applause]
[2:21:30] people are deceived and comfortable they
[2:21:31] have made local church history bright
[2:21:33] history
[2:21:35] and that is a pattern around the world
[2:21:37] this is an around the world
[2:21:38] thing made local church history bright
[2:21:41] history
[2:21:43] every church has its own history
[2:21:45] i could spend a whole set of time here
[2:21:46] talking about from kai well to grandi to
[2:21:49] think to when he was in marrow and he
[2:21:51] went to go martin and we went on to
[2:21:52] maraval and but how would that bring you
[2:21:54] any closer to you leaving here
[2:21:56] [Music]
[2:21:58] but over two minutes this morning he
[2:21:59] found the first message i preached in
[2:22:01] 1997.
[2:22:04] so i can spend a whole set of time now
[2:22:05] talking about what i said in that first
[2:22:07] mention how we're tied to the great
[2:22:08] going home of the church
[2:22:11] i'm happy if only you know but that is
[2:22:13] local choice history
[2:22:17] people make a whole doctrine and
[2:22:19] teaching in this message around this is
[2:22:21] what happened here and this one and if
[2:22:23] you're not part of this you're out of
[2:22:24] out of what
[2:22:28] and this is why we operate a certain way
[2:22:30] in this church
[2:22:31] bright history is is a global thing and
[2:22:36] it affects all the locations in a
[2:22:37] different way i don't have to be part of
[2:22:39] your church issues or your student story
[2:22:42] to make it
[2:22:43] because god is dealing with us
[2:22:44] differently the same way paul had to
[2:22:46] write to the thessalonians and the
[2:22:47] ephesians and the colossians and the
[2:22:49] hebrews and the romans
[2:22:56] we all have to have our personal
[2:22:57] testimony
[2:22:59] our personal experience
[2:23:01] and because i don't spend five hours
[2:23:02] talking about my experience doesn't
[2:23:04] negate my experience
[2:23:07] and because you spent five hours talking
[2:23:08] about yours doesn't make yours mine
[2:23:11] but we all have to come into the unity
[2:23:12] of the faith we all have to come into
[2:23:14] our preparation to leave this place and
[2:23:16] go to the rapture
[2:23:24] i'm trying to close
[2:23:26] but i just want this it was on my heart
[2:23:28] because i'm tired of seeing people being
[2:23:30] manipulated and deceived into all kind
[2:23:32] of stuff from the world from the church
[2:23:35] system from the message that we're the
[2:23:37] angel in this church in whose church is
[2:23:39] he injured in exactly which church
[2:23:41] because brother branham said one time he
[2:23:43] said i saw the angel he came to my room
[2:23:45] i didn't see him for six months he just
[2:23:46] looked in and walked away
[2:23:49] so i want to know how brother branham
[2:23:51] wasn't locking the angel neck and put
[2:23:53] him under the bed and say cargo because
[2:23:55] if not i can't tell him that you're not
[2:23:58] with
[2:23:58] me but abraham said he hidden he hadn't
[2:24:01] heard from the angel for six months so
[2:24:03] if the prophet hadn't heard from it for
[2:24:04] six months when they say the angel is in
[2:24:06] this church or they find a way to lock
[2:24:08] him
[2:24:11] but if you don't know the message and
[2:24:13] the scriptures i know how god operates
[2:24:14] you will fall for that
[2:24:16] and then it is used to build faith and
[2:24:18] confidence in people because outside of
[2:24:20] that they have no faith and confidence
[2:24:22] because our faith and conviction should
[2:24:24] rest on the word itself
[2:24:26] jesus said it paul said it be not
[2:24:29] deceived
[2:24:31] let no man deceive you this gospel is
[2:24:34] real the revelation of the word is real
[2:24:36] this word will bring us to perfection
[2:24:39] if we put aside our differences but
[2:24:41] aside our personal issues and yield to
[2:24:43] god god will bless you for the effort i
[2:24:47] challenge you to spend more time with
[2:24:49] you but i challenge you to spend more
[2:24:51] time in prayer i challenge you to spend
[2:24:53] more time consecrated
[2:24:56] i challenge you above all else because
[2:24:58] what separates now in this bride i have
[2:25:01] been called but i'm not going to read it
[2:25:02] but but i'm but but about speaking only
[2:25:04] two spirits working in the framework of
[2:25:06] the church
[2:25:09] one is our unholy spirit and one is the
[2:25:12] holy spirit itself that brings us into
[2:25:15] relationship with god
[2:25:17] brings us into communion with god brings
[2:25:19] us to fellowship with god brings us into
[2:25:21] the presence of god bring it into a
[2:25:23] condition of perfect love that we can
[2:25:26] enter into that place
[2:25:28] and that's what's important friends
[2:25:32] family differences begin to fade away
[2:25:34] these issues begin to fade away the
[2:25:36] distractions begin to fade away and it
[2:25:38] becomes just you and god alone
[2:25:40] lord it's me
[2:25:42] lord i thank you that i escaped the
[2:25:44] deception of the world i thank you i
[2:25:46] escaped the deception of the church and
[2:25:48] reception in the message that i'm all
[2:25:50] right when i believe but lord i need the
[2:25:53] holy ghost
[2:25:56] and i'm clear that i have to get it
[2:25:57] since i believe
[2:25:59] i want to change on the inside i want to
[2:26:01] change my walk in my talk
[2:26:04] that's what god is fighting for
[2:26:06] you and him not the group on him but you
[2:26:08] and him as an individual where he could
[2:26:10] see himself in you and he can say
[2:26:12] there's my spirit flowing freely that's
[2:26:15] when you reach a position of not seeing
[2:26:17] anything outside of what god wants you
[2:26:18] to see and that's what god has fought
[2:26:20] for to bring relationship with him
[2:26:24] listen friends
[2:26:26] god is no respecter of persons
[2:26:30] god is a jealous god
[2:26:32] people have built up kingdoms and god is
[2:26:35] also very good at breaking down kingdoms
[2:26:38] any church any group any system that
[2:26:41] comes together that tries to replace
[2:26:43] what he is god will shut it down
[2:26:45] and he's very good at doing it because
[2:26:47] he's about his relationship with his
[2:26:48] people
[2:26:49] so we thank god we have escaped
[2:26:51] all the corruption escape false christ
[2:26:54] escape force teaching escape false
[2:26:56] doctrine and our singular focus is the
[2:26:59] baptism of the holy ghost our singular
[2:27:01] focus is a perfect church our singular
[2:27:04] purpose is an adopted church our
[2:27:06] singular purpose is a church where the
[2:27:08] holy ghost moving in it may the lord
[2:27:10] richly bless you
[2:27:12] [Applause]
[2:27:21] thank you father give him praise today
[2:27:23] hallelujah lift up your hands
[2:27:26] oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah
[2:27:30] glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[2:27:33] yay man i will go
