certainly appreciate each and every one of you coming out here this morning I also want to salute Life Tabernacle family connected to us live this morning God bless you brother Solomon you're on the Believers there praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus so today is our I to say our Super Sunday have communion this evening so you are here to worship you're here to stay you're here to be blessed and I want you to be blessed and we have had quite some sessions of uh things pertaining to life and godliness which we believe is not only for the young people but we believe that even the older ones there are stuff that sometimes we don't know we're not aware of and a lot of stuff had been shared downstairs and I want to invite brother Andrew now I'm going to share something for us for a few minutes and that give you a little taste or appetizer of what happens down there in the sessions of Life pertaining to life and godliness but Andrew you could come praise the Lord amen amen and welcome everyone and I'm so glad to be here and those sessions have been such a blessing and I want to thank the ministry for the for the for the opportunity to be able to share with you and just for a brief thought um um and it's just going to be a few minutes just for a brief thought I want to talk about the field of potential and it's basically we're talking about life and godliness and I'm very very passionate about the subject because I don't just believe that we are to have good success just in the spiritual but leave out the Life part amen all right so if you could stand for just a few minutes just to read read a scripture with me so I want to read [Music] from 2 Corinthians 9 verse 6 and it reads on this wise but this I say he which swe it sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which Seth bomul shall reap also bomul and just one more scripture and it's Ecclesiastes 9 verse 10 and and it says whatsoever thy hand finder to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge no wisdom in the grave without thou goest amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let's just open up in a quick word of prayer Lord Heavenly Father Lord um we know that we need you more than ever in this season Lord Jesus and we just come to create an atmosphere of good ground where we could be nurtured where we could have life and have it more abundantly Lord we ask that these few words be a blessing to your people in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats amen all right so it's um like we said it's just a a few words and basically in the Bible there's a whole lot of good stuff there's a lot of um like nuggets there's a lot of success principles and within these sessions we would have gone through the righteousness of of profitability um the righteousness um we want to talk about thinking big right because God pulled aside his servant and told him to count the Stars if he can right and God count counted him Believing on that promise as righteousness right we want to talk about the righteousness of Taken territory we would have spoke about that in one of the sessions and strategic um planning and so on but today we're just going to talk very briefly about the field of potential and we believe that God would have put man here on Earth to dress and to keep and to occupy and we must have a great representation about how it is that we we do it so when the Bible would have said do it with all your might right it made me wonder about these stories in the Bible and I see it now David he took his job very seriously right and I wondered if it is that the brothers had an opportunity before to take care of the sheep and then I begin to wonder if they also had a chance to meet up with the lion or to meet up with the bear and what was the outcome or what was that particular report did they come back to their father Jesse and say lamb down it was quick right we didn't get to see what happened right but David the Bible said David said that the that the lion took the sheep and he took back the sheep and slew the lion now for some persons who may not have taken that job so seriously they may have recommended to the to the lion listener pepper and salt does Go real good with this if it is that you smoke it a little bit it does add to the flavor right because there's no way that they go in and attempt to take it that seriously right it also came to me in the story of Joseph very very powerful story as well where Joseph was sold into slavery and he had an opportunity to say boy them Brethren they're just so wicked and evil are you going and work hard at all and in the house of pitifer his hands were blessed he was so blessed that he was elevated to the head of the home because what he did he did it with all his might and potifa was able to see the blessing of the Lord upon his life amen so I just want to close by just reading two more scriptures and I know that is very very brief right but it's supposed to be a taster amen so I want to go to Proverbs 20:4 now you don't need to find it but if they could put it up it'll be it'll be great Proverbs 20:4 and it says the slugged will not plow by reason of the cold therefore shall he beg in Harvest and have nothing and when I was reading this I begin to think about it and I and I told myself like this the sluggard refuse to plant because they have an excuse that's right whether it's cold whe whe it's hot whether it's rainy whether it's sunny they have an excuse and because they have an excuse they will depend on the persons who didn't have an excuse wow right and they'll still leave themselves vulnerable they will still have nothing and at that point I mean there's so many passive passive Christians out here at that point that's when that's when the old gospel songs really really hit great because you want to sing Jesus we're depending on you but you didn't plant that's is when The Neighbor mango looking real real big and juicy you want to help them you're saying hey that one right there if it is that the neighbor tell them well your Rod broken don't worry I'll fix your rod they didn't plant right so last scripture last scripture and it's Proverbs 24 verse 30 proverbs 24:30 and in the Bible there's a lot that is said about the man that is void of understanding and we want to see what is the situation here with persons who don't understand their field of potential and God is looking for a return on his investment because you are planted here on Earth so Proverbs 24:30 it reads on this wise it says I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and Nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then I saw and considered it well I looked upon it and received instruction so the person who is full and void of understanding he does not understand that he has productive capabilities and profitable capabilities within his field right and that's why he could leave it and neglect it because when one Thorn comes it becomes a becomes a little issue don't worry I'll deal with that tomorrow but it begins to multiply very fast right and then you have the whole face of it that is all grown over and the fact that the wall is broken down there's no protection on that field of potential so that mean even if it is at something was to grow up through it anybody could come and rub steal destroy kill and we need to be able to protect our field of potential and make sure that it's productive and make sure that it's profitable and make sure that it's that it's generational and make sure that it's a blessing onto blessing unto people amen so I hope that that was a blessing to you and I hope that you are blessed today right I thank you for the for the opportunity to speak to you and I'm looking forward for whether young whether old that you come to the sessions for life and to Godliness it's no longer generally youth service and you could feel free to invite someone and I'm sure that they'll be very blessed [Applause] amen Al and right now in the good times and bad you are on your throne You Are God Alone singing You Are God Alone from Before Time began you were on your throne You Are God Alone and right now in the good times and B you are on your throne You Are God Alone you're unchangeable unshakeable unstoppable that's who you are unchangeable unshakeable unstoppable that's who you are hallelujah hallelujah God Alone amen praise the lord we appreciate what but Andrew Shar what an appetizer I don't want to miss the next session I hope all of you can make it the next time we're having it and be a blessing to you so let's bow head one more time father God we thank you for your word and we pray a bless it interpret to our hearts in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen I have a scripture I to read for you 2 Samuel CH 24: 10 to 25 and when you sit down keep your Bibles open we want to look at a context scripture of Luke 14 from verse 12 so just 2 Samuel 24 verse 10 wow and David had smot him after that he numbered the people and David said unto the Lord I have sinned greatly in that I have done and now I beseech thee Oh Lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for I have done very foolishly for when David was up in the morning the word of the Lord came unto the prophet God David SE saying go and say unto David thus sayeth the Lord I offer thee treatings choose thee one of them that I may do it unto thee so God came to David and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or will thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me and David said unto God I am in a great straet let us fall now into the hand of the Lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man so the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from Dan even to BBA 70,000 men and when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it the Lord repented him of the evil and said unto the angel that destroy the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the Lord was by the treesan place of Aruna the jebusite and David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smoke the people and said lo I have sinned I have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand I pray thee be against me against against my father's house and God came that day to David said unto him go up Ray an altar unto the Lord in the thres Floor of Arona the jebusite and David according to the Sint of God went up as the Lord commanded and Arona looked and saw the king and his servants coming on towards him and Arona went out and bow himself before the king on his face and upon the ground and Arona said wherefore is my Lord the king come to his servant and David said to buy the treesan float of thee to build an altar unto the Lord that the plague may be stayed from the people and Arona said unto David let my Lord the king Take and offer up what seeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice instruments other instruments of The Oxen for wood all these things did Aron as a king as a king give unto the king and Arona said unto the king the Lord thy God accept thee and the King said unto Arona n but I will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God that which cost me nothing so David bought the trees floor and The Oxen for 50 shekels of silver and David built there an altar on the Lord and burnt offerings and peace offerings so the Lord was entreated of the land and the plague was teed from Israel may God bless his word you may be seated Hallelujah you want to know where but over that this morning the scripture from Luke 14 familiar scripture reading from verse 12 Luke chapter 14 Jesus about to speak then said he also to him that b him when thou makest a dinner or supper call not thy friends nor thy Brethren neither thy Kinsmen nor thy Rich neighbors least they also bid thee again and recompense be made you call your friends they call your rich people and then them call you back hear what he says but when th makest a feast call the poor the meme the lean the Blind and thou sht be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou sht be recompensed at the resurrection of the Just note how Jesus constantly reminding them of to do stuff that God recognizes and that God sees verse 15 and when one of them that sat and meet with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God and then he said unto him a certain man made a great supper and B many sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things and not ready and they all with one consent begin to make excuse just like what but Andrew talk about making excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground I must needs to go and see it I pray to have me excuse another said now listen The Man by cow beef the man have rice peas macaroni pie salad the man fix up his place and invite people only hear excuses and they all with one consent begin to make excuses another said verse 19 I have bought five UK of oxen I go to prove them I pray to have me excuse another said I have married a wife therefore I cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being Ang angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bringing hither the poor the meme the Halt and the blind yes am and the servant said Lord it is done as thou commanded and yet there is room amen amen and the Lord said unto servant go out to the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of these men which were bidden shall taste of my supper and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said to them If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters ye and his own life also he cannot be my disciples and whosoever do not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciples for which of you intended to build a tower sth not down first and counted the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it least happily after he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man begin to build and was not able to finish may God bless his word hallu to pay you have to count the cost there's a price for everything what we call free is not really free if we say after service there are meals downstairs everybody have one is free for everybody it is free to you but it cost the church or whoever putting out it cost somebody salvation is free to us but Jesus is who went to the Cross so what we think is free is not free notice the three options that David got not one of them was Spong cake with dressings in it it was dead serious so much months of famine let enemy run after you or pestilence David say better fall in the hands of God than the hands of man man's still dreader than that God send pestilence the prophet God spoke to David and said go make a sacrifice David went to pay he said come to buy it the man said no I Ox in here that free I have wood I have everything here is free you up to you I'm giving you it free David said I will not offer to God what cost me [Applause] nothing not David not David remember one time you say your to give this to God give give it to some bot thing What Remain what what you have some kind of old clothes you want to wear again you want to give some no give it to somebody don't no don't do that that's what you have to do give your best to God if you're working work with all your might and all your strength it have no reason for a Christian to be ratting on the job you should be always doing your best everything cost even Freedom cost somebody 16 they wait to reach 18 like everything is a magic number when you reach that 18 like that like just magic has happen you want your freedom but Freedom have a cost it have a cost of discipline no matter young fellas when they reach 18 they find as we said already them the driver they get a w car because they get license and so happen they reach 18 and they driving to get a wer when police come all them lock up they have a 10 years to make because they thought they're free they could smoke they're free I could drink you're free you could go to parties and and lime you're free but are you really free because Israel came out of Egypt but Egypt didn't come out of them after bondage for so much years those people they were so wicked they say let us get a captain to lead us back to Egypt because the cost is what he didn't want to pay the price of Deliverance The Cost of Freedom the cost of being saved and to stay Sav the cost of being delivered and you remain delivered there's a price for that because if you let unbelief come a worst thing happen the same sickness but I'm pray for people they get healed and by even time they get back sick again is because of unbelief because of their attitude he said the same you have to have faith to keep it off of you it's not to sit down and Rock back and it going just going to work out so have a title are you willing to pay the price
