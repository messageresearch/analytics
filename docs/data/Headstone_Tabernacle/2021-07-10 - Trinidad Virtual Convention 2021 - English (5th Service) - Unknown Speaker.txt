time amen as we want to ask one of our brothers amen in the lord amen minister and brethren to greet us amen and send amen wisdom encouragement today so god bless you as he comes amen god bless you amen okay god bless you uh i am very grateful to pastor and you theo allowed me this time i know he's taught me to go for about 10 minutes to give my testimony or how i came to that message in fact i've heard so many times for brother theo long time ago but i never had the privilege of meeting with him even to see him and by god's grace in 2019 i was invited by the in the convention in enugu that's why i met with pastor theo we had some very nice time of fellowship and we enjoyed the world and since he asked me to just give a testimony for about 10 minutes i'll try to do so in fact i feel like i am handicapped because here on the island of mauritius have been colonized first by the french people and we are i am more inclined to speak french and also we have our own dialect which is creole that's our island language here that's how we preach we don't preach in english therefore i i hope that i can get across to you with my english i want to tell you that i have never known the message the way that god has led me to it now in fact i was a very was very uh if i can use the expression i was very mad with the message people because the message was like a threat to my denomination i came from first the assembly of god i was maybe you don't know my religion i was i came my great-grandfather came from south india and from there we used to practice our religion i was sick for 16 years from birth i was sick with asthma it was quite a chronic asthmatic condition i thought i i would die with that one one of the those days you know my mother brought me to the first doctorate i was three months old and for 16 years i was sick i remember i couldn't go to school i couldn't really study as i should i couldn't even sit normally to study i have to just put my foot on the chair just to be able to gasp for breath and i've seen people die in front of me with asthma my dad had to rub me with some you know cream because i was gasping for breath we've done so many things in religion i've gone to my gods my dad made a vow to our god three years i've been i don't know that you know the practice we have to carry our guards walked barefooted it was a sunny day you know the road surface was very hot very difficult but yet with the valve that we made and the fasting that we observed it was like that we carry our guards it's very strange the way i'm saying to you that we have to carry our guards walk it's like a pilgrimage and then we even have to walk through fire that's the way that we serve our gods we had many gods and we have never come come across the bible in our life we never read that book we had our own religious book and then for the first time i was 16 years old some young people came home maybe about a month ago it was in 1975 they came and testified about jesus christ and it was very strange for us my dad also was very sick for nearly 20 years 22 years he was sick he had he had to undergo many surgical operations but every time he was ready for the surgical everything was postponed and it was becoming skinny how the days were going by then one afternoon i came from school i was very very sick with high fever and i was gasping for breath i remember i could hardly breathe and when i reached home my dad told me do you want to go to church i thought he was talking about our church our you know tamil church but he said no let's go that those young people talk to us about jesus christ let's go and see reluctantly i followed my dad it was a friday i think on the 16th of may an evening service i went there and i was sitting like on the tenth row and listening i just came from school and listening to the to the preaching i'll be honest with you i was i was crying the pastor was preaching on the political song oh my that sermon i was asking myself why sitting there what is that book he's reading from extracting tears from my eyes i was really shocked and i was crying weeping and after the service he he called for a prayer line for those who were sick before i was that's the reason i went there my dad brought me there and i found myself in the queue when it came to my time the pastor asked me his name was nicole he asked me do you believe in mark 16. you know i i look at him like with surprise eyes you know because i never read the bible i don't know what he's referring to you know then he called the scripture to me they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and he asks me do you believe that i can remember you know with that time i can't i can't tell you how it happened but with a childlike faith i just told him that uh yes and he prayed for me from that very moment i got healed completely of my asthma today i'm 62 years old that was 46 years later never been sick again and i did a term of three or four years in the assembly of god but i was looking for the truth something deep inside of me told me there was a deeper truth than that i got the holy ghost there you know i was pentecostal people speaking in tongues but when i read the bible said when the holy ghost shall come it shall lead you into all the truth that i knew that there was more truth to that and it would be a long story i just ended in the pentecostal church the upc and i was one of the mem founded members of the upc and one of the founder pastors and for nine years i was there and the message came to mauritius in november 1978 and the message was a threat to my church to the upc therefore i did all i can to fight the message i even pulled people out of the message and i'll tell you the result the consequences of that are fairly sick i got schizophrenia which is one of the worst cases of depression and i told my psychiatrist while he was giving me the tablets i told him i'm going to commit suicide he was scared and he gave me some other tablets higher dosage you know try to just to prevent me from doing that and that's when i came to the message i came from a trip from hong kong a non-stop fight on a truth on a tuesday 2nd of march 1993 i went first time on the 7th of march to the message church there i i got a message today is around 28 years now the lord has helped me with a message i've been able to go to madagascar because i was a missionary to madagascar also in 1982 and 1996 i went there 14 years later and i preach until today there are about 24 years during three or four times a year i've been going to madagascar i've been able to go to many many several numerous areas in madagascar preaching the message bringing the books there even in the beginning i was doing the translation myself getting the people translated into malagasy language but today i'm very happy that vijaya voice of god has taken over with some very very nice job they are doing there having even somebody on the spot there to do the recording the voice recording and and to have the books translated a fantastic job and madagascar and is on fire i can tell you that i'm very happy to have been able to talk to you about my testimony how the lord led me and on the island where we are now we have a few message churches and the message has changed my life and has impacted many people in my head and even i've been allowed by the authorities no church in the in the history of the prisons here no church has ever been allowed inside the prison premises to preach the word i've been given the permission by the prime minister to go in and today in my church there might be about 15 ex-inmates i mean drug dealers notorious drug dealers criminals those who kill people and they're in my church they're living a decent life i'm just talking about the power of the message the power behind the message it's really a powerful message and i like the theme that brother theo has chosen about another ephesians and that code that he put about about redemption has got two parts i like that quote said you must come out of unbelief to be able to enter the world of faith i just thought about the political son he had to come out of his pink pen come home and there many things happened to him the father talk about the role you know the best robe it was like a kind of adoption to put a robe on him and gave him a ring a ring of authority he has taken his position in his father's house as a true son and that's our history and remember when this prodigal son came back home he left all the pigs behind there is no record that bring that he brought a little pig with him you know and that's what we have to do leave everything behind to enter this world of faith to enter this position as a son of god to be adopted to have another ephesians we have to leave everything behind and when he came home he got the best robe the fatted calf the shoes everything was prepared for him as a son even if he stole to himself i'll talk to my father treat me as one of the higher servants but he was his son he left home at his son that never changed his status as his son he was adopted in the house of his father as his son and just remember the privileges that he had being adopted that was his ephesians for him i don't know whether i have already gone my my my seven my ten minutes but praise god god bless you i thank brother theo for everything may the lord preach uh bless you uh richly bless every one of you there all the ministers who have been chosen to preach for the convention i know the purpose behind it is to get the bride to attention because we are living really in dangerous time in treacherous times but also a very glorious time for the bride god bless you richly shalom shalom ye

so god bless you as all precious brother thompson comes to speak the word of the lord to you amen just have faith and believe amen god bless you amen and amen praise the lord [Music] just before we go into the word maybe let's have a seat i just want to do the greeting and then we'll go into the word after [Music] so yeah i just want to agree rather than the lord and just for this opportunity and privilege to to stand here i'm standing here on behalf of our pastor pastor raymond thompson and to to greet the convention with the virtual convention in the name of the lord jesus christ and we just want to thank the lord for this inspiration that brother theo's got and uh you know thank him for for uh you know just i think from my side maybe you know for all the years that he's put up these conventions the last a couple of times they had to be virtual since the old covert pandemic and it was such a blessing i had the privilege to travel with my dad like two occasions at headstone to experience those kind of conventions and it was always a blessing and we want to thank god even for the headstone ministry brother iva brother isaac anthony brother stephen various ministers day we want to appreciate the ministry of edston tabernacle as well and also just a greeting again on behalf of the pastor to all the ministering brethren that we'll be ministering and the ministers that will be greeting as well we just want to thank god for you and for your ministries and the blessing that it's been to the pride across the world so uh i'm standing here again like i said on behalf of the pastor as a church and as a family we wanted to you know give him that time uh just to mourn our mom we lost a little bit over a month now the church has lost the pastor's wife as well and uh so i'm just here standing in on his behalf and uh i felt when i was when when he spoke to me about it it was like uh i don't know if i can do it but you know i was thinking to myself the one thing that we should be doing is really just to hold up his arms in these times and the scripture says that you know the lord is lie to them that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit and so we believe the lord will give him the strength and very soon we're going to see him in the pulpit again so the message that i've got is a little bit from a different angle i know brother theo's inspiration is the dispensation of another ephesians so i really wanted to just bring it in from a different angle but not you know go into anything specifically or anything deep but really just to bring it as an exaltation so it's a message of exaltation we had these mighty men that's been preaching for years and years and i'm talking about 20 30 40 plus years uh that they've been preaching this inspiration so there's nothing new that we can come you know we had a vindicated word from the prophet so i'm here this today really just to exalt you and i trust and i believe that it will be a blessing to the bride across the world so let's stand to our feet let's just go into the scripture reading amen i've got two portions of scripture the first one is in ephesians 1. we'll read from verse 3 to 8 and then ephesians 3 from verses 1 to 7. if you found the first scripture from verses 3 ephesians 1 it reads blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in here the bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence ephesians 3 and we'll read from verses 1 for this cause i paul the prison of jesus christ for you gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you would how that my by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote before in few words whereby when he read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow is and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel wherever i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our heads gracious eternal father we just want to thank you lord for this opportunity that we have to be found in your presence and lord we thank you father god just that we lord and realizing rather that it's not by our own efforts but it's by your grace and we pray father god jesus really just this word of exaltation that it may be a blessing to your people i pray father god jesus wherever it will be listen to over the livestream i pray father god jesus may you go lord and quicken the word to your children's hearts so father god i pray lord for the reading of the word as well may you bless it father god as we believe it's a vindicated word and we thank you father god jesus in jesus name amen amen you may be seated amen i'm not going to roll up my sleeves like the pasta would brother luke showed me there you must be able to shoot like fire so only the pastor can do that when he rolls up his sleeves you must be able to fire like he can so i'm not even gonna try that so just the title for today grace in the dispensation of another ephesians an inspiration possessing the holy ghost land and a subject we shall overcome amen grace in the dispensation of another ephesians and if we listen if we take it from the ephesians 3 that we just read paul identifies that ephesians as the dispensation of the grace of god now the prophet spoke to us and he said that there has to come another ephesians to this journey and if that first ephesians was a dispensation of grace then this ephesians will be another dispensation of grace to you and i yeah and that's what i wanted to take this morning and rather i wanted to use and take grace as the underlying theme for the sermon and if we look at grace what does grace mean it means unmerited favor in other words you didn't do anything to deserve it but you received it the prophet preaches a message where he says god who is rich in mercy he's the god who is rich in mercy and if we look at god and if we look at the grace of god we understand and we look at every action of god to you and i or towards you and i is by grace so in other words when he created his creation we need his providence towards you your salvation your future your destiny is all by the grace of god [Applause] john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son now we can turn around and say what did the world do to deserve his love what did you do to deserve his love and if we look at it you you come to the realization and you realize that god's love gives on grace terms and i want you just to follow me with this we're going to place it all away from the beginning of time in fact you can go back to the before the foundation of the world when he chose you in his mind that was god's grace to you in a message earnestly containing for the faith the prophet speaks there on jude and how that he was encouraging the saints not to to to to lose this so earnestly content for this faith and he speaks in a message and he refers to ephesians in paul the prophet says in that message paul was fixing to speak of grace through redemption he was fixing to speak of grace through god's election when he was addressing the letter to the ephesians church and the church was made up of individuals that made up the body of christ for that age and as we understand the dispensation is a divinely appointed age and when paul addresses it to that age he's addressing the body of christ and he speaks in ephesians of three how he received this great mystery of god so in other words paul received this great revelation of who jesus was and when he received this revelation why did paul come to the conclusion that this jesus was jehovah of the old testament so this revelation came through and he realized and the prophet says it was by grace that it was shown to paul and this big man of this threefold purpose of god was unfolded to paul and what did paul come to the realization by a revelation that god was manifested in christ christ wants to be manifested in his church from the day of pentecost and he says for that third step was in order to redeem lost eve back to our original condition and so that revelation came in that first church age in communion the prophet speaks about grace he says you know how five is the number of grace and he says in that message he says if god ever sends his power again to the church he says it will be by his grace in other words it won't be by the obedience of any man no obedience of any man it will be nothing that you and i will do but if he sends his dynamics power in this dispensation it will be because of the grace of god it won't be because of you and my obedience or what we will do to deserve this now let's trace this grace grace we can trace from the foundation of the world we can run it all the way through genesis you can run it through to the church ages you can run it right into revelation and the prophet in oneness he paints this picture he says how this great god of eternity that covered all of space and time he says he wanted to make himself known he wanted to become material he says in the very first step of him becoming material was genesis 1 26 let us make man in our own image and eventually he puts this man into material into a body of clay the prophet says and this was the father and he had this fellowship he had this oneness with his family which was adam and eve and he says and they had this oneness and this fellowship with the father the prophet says how because they had his nature they had the very nature of god in them and the prophet in oneness continues to paint this picture he says out death he says there was no death there was no heartaches there was no sorrow he says there was no sickness he says there was no heartache he says oh what a beautiful picture this must have been and when satan came in and disrupted this entire program of this existence of mankind when god himself then had come into in into to a body of flesh you are he came in the volume of the book the prophet says there in john 17 11 when he prayed to the father he said father i want that same oneness that you and i now have with my church so in other words when he came in the body of flesh he demonstrated what adam and eve had and he said and he prophesied and he prayed that i want the same oneness with my body so when they had it in the in in pentecost you're gonna have it that oneness will have to be amen under this dispensation in one as the prophet turns around and he says and at that day you will know that i am in the father the father is in me and i in you amen and that will be the oneness restored in that first church they demonstrated that oneness and if we are living in another dispensation of that it will be by grace he says but the prophet turns around and he says but the church needs to realize who she is in other words you need to realize what your position is you need to get into your position he says turns around and he says and when that happens that prayer of john 17 11 will be answered once more in this day and age let's give the lord and praise now let's let's continue to look at grace the prophet's preachers he preached a message called the message of grace and in that message he says this you know that grace is old he says grace is as old as the world is he says and grace was first introduced to the human race when the human race was first created in the garden of eden he says then then he paints the picture he says on that dark morning when that little woman stepped across the dividing line she caused the husband also to step across that dividing line because the law was given that at that day that you eat there off that very day you're going to die and the prophet in that message he says now remember that first judgment seat was on the earth in the garden of eden and that judgment and the last judgment seat will also be on the earth in the end time so they realize that they had sinned they realized that they were naked and they eat from the presence of god now if you think about it why did they hide obviously because they realized that they were naked but they also realized that there was a penalty attached to the law so in other words the days that you eat there if you die but they were not yet introduced the way the prophet says it in that message to grace they were not aware of what grace will do for them he says and there they stood this couple they stood there condemned there would be no more human race from that time on now remember they didn't know about grace yet but as far as they knew because of the law that there would be no more human race why because there was a requirement for death the prophet says it was the darkest hour in their lives he says it seemed like all hope was gone but all of a sudden grace came pouring through grace said i'll give you a savior the prophet says oh god's amazing grace in the garden of eden he says i'll give you a savior and that very god that had put down the law was the same one that slew a lamb under the shadow of redemption for their sake he says grace gave them a promise at that same time that there was going to be a just one that was to come and he would come through the woman and you see that woman's seed will be the one that will brew satan's head now even though they had to leave the garden of eden grace provided them a redemption plan [Applause] and as we look at this picture we realize and we see how this plan is going to play itself out through the ages through the various dispensations of time because now they had to live immortal life and they were eventually gonna die immortal's death but grace provided him this plan that from dispensation to dispensation grace is gonna be following this redemption plan and he says now now look at what grace did for them because grace showed him this plan then it will play itself out through the ages and it will play itself out up until the dispensation of the fullness of time now the prophet says what is the dispensation of the fullness of time he says when death is no more when sickness is no more when heartaches is no more why because in the fullness of time he brings and he draws all of this up into himself at the fullness of time or the dispensation of the fullness of time now brother and sister to you and i isn't it glorious and in that message the prophet says god's amazing grace to look at this step back and look at it and marvel and see how it plays itself out through the ages so what i want to do this morning like i said it's really just a message of exaltation let's follow it through the ages [Applause] the prophet says in message of grace he says god's grace is sovereign and for you and i in layman's term sovereign means i don't have to ask your permission to do it in other words he does what he wants to do he didn't need satan's permission he didn't need lucifer's permission when he decided to save you when he decided to save me he didn't ask the angel's permission do you think that i should save thomas blaikis in this age in this dispensation he is sovereign he chose you and i before the foundation of the world [Applause] why because of his sovereign grace and as the scripture says he chose you in him and the prophet says in that message he says that's the reason why he could save the violence i can turn around it says no god but thomas practice is the worst yes he doesn't need my permission he never did need my permission why because he's sovereign and that's the reason why he chose you and when he chose you he elected you before the foundation of the world and because he elected you he called you at dispensation at this dispensation of grace and that's the reason why you and i are now under dispensation of grace in this ephesians give the lord and praise amen in adoption 3 he says i needed saving i could do nothing to save myself in other words you and i could do nothing because of the way we came into this world he says we came into this world speaking lies with our pacts turned to him you aired no hope you had no hope the prophet in adoption 3 he turns around and he says but god who for knew you did he fall know me he knew me before the foundation of the world and because he knew me before the funding he predestinated me and and because he predestinated you now now he's going to call you in your decreed season in your age in your dispensation and to those who is called is justified and to them who is justified is glorified [Applause] now turn back and the scripture says it this way now brothers and sisters what shall we say to these things [Applause] if god is for us who can be against you who can be against you if god is before you his providence his election his foreknowledge his predestination of you and i what shall we say to these things what shall we say to these things it's grace from before the foundation of the world all the way into your dispensation all the way into your age and god this is our god brings it to us my my the prophet says i was a cockapoo but all of a sudden i'm a weak grain how did that happen he says what is that he says that's his election and now i'm saved and now i'm walking in the grace of god the prophet says why because of your predestination and that's the reason why like the pastor had preached in the past predestination looks back to your full knowledge and he says for knowledge looks to your destiny now what is your destiny the adoption of sons and daughters of god that is your destiny and that's the reason why jesus christ when he spoke to his church he said don't rejoice because devils are subject to you rejoice because your names are written in heaven because your names are written in glory now again what did you and i do for that nothing nothing but god sovereign grace that he put your name on the lam's book of life and it's for that reason that peter was found in the upper room because he knew there was a promise of a dynamics and power coming in his state in his backslidden state in his fallen state he felt like he he failed god but he was predestinated to receive that dynamics and power [Applause] let's move on to abraham because we're following and we're running with this grace the prophet comes to abram in the message of grace he says you know that abram was no special man he come down from the tower of babel in fact he came from a family of idolaters and if you look at it historically his father was in fact the one that used to mold and fashioned idols in babel now the prophet in that message turns around and he says god called him from that he says that was god's grace he says it was not because he was a different man but it was all because he was a better man he says but it was the grace of god that called you he says and abram was saved by faith which is grace god saved him and it was not because of his behavior so abram could have been a good a good man a good self but it was not because of the behavior that he was called he was given a promise and the promise the prophet says that promise was altogether grace in other words it had no law mixed in with it and that shows you how determined god was to save that man or to save mankind he says he you are so determined to save him that he even made a covenant with himself in other words it was not like in the beginning the day that you eat there that day you die in other words if you do this i will do that he says no he made a covenant with himself but he made that man the beneficiary of that covenant so i'm going to swear by myself but you're going to be the beneficiary of this covenant and today because you and i are the abraham's royal seed you and i are the beneficiaries of that covenant [Applause] now as we move on let's get to redemption in a paradox the prophet preaches this and he says how joshua was the book of redemption of the old testament and we know that redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into he says moses represented the law which was brought and brought them out of egypt but joshua represented the grace that took them into the promised land and in paradox i'm going to read this quote this is really where i got the call it the theme of grace and we see as time played out or the ages played out abram was given a promise by god in other words this is your inheritance as far as your eye can see north south east west i give this land to you but your seed will so journey in a strange land but i the lord god will bring them out with a mighty end and in this message paradox he says this they started out really with grace to begin with before they had law they had grace while they were in egypt without the law no one was down there it was just priests and so forth but they didn't have any laws the law had not yet been given through moses but grace provided them a prophet so they were crying out for a prophet for this mighty deliverer the prophet says but grace provided them with that prophet he says grace also provided them with an atonement a sacrificial lamb that would bring them out and that atonement had been provided before there was any law then he makes this statement and this is where i got the inspiration from he says grace was before law it was during the law and it is after the law and this is where i got it from [Applause] and so we tracing them now they come out moses leads them out of egypt with a mighty end of deliverance the prophet says and took them through the red sea mighty miracles that they've seen he says and yet they came to a state in the wilderness where they used to they murmured and complained and the prophet says but there's a reason why he let them one day in the wilderness for so long he says because the promise of canaan or the promise of that inheritance was not to that generation but he needed that generation to bring forth the seed that it was from the promise was meant for and if you look at it only two from the original that came out had gone into the land in other words possessed the land but he was waiting for the joshua generation to come forth because he knew that they were overcomers they knew that they were believers and that's the reason why the prophet says he needed them to bring forth that seat now let's let's come all the way down to jesus christ the royal seed of abraham this was now he was born he was the promised one that was to come the woman's seed the audition church age the prophet says he is standing now in the midst of the church talking about christ standing in the midst of walking through the midst of the candlesticks and he says he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of this church the heavenly bridegroom who created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and he created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born he was this new creation man and god had met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead and in all things he might have the preeminence second corinthians therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creation all the old things have passed away behold all things has become new a new creation now so no longer is he dealing by the ways of the flesh now but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself he says god the creator creating himself a part of his creation the prophet turns around and he says this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose and this purpose took form through election by his own decree elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will [Music] and there you see his sovereignty again in oneness now the prophet turns around and he says your debt is paid yes he says hallelujah to the lamb your death is paid every man and woman hearing me this morning and he says end to you that's hearing me by tape your penalty is speech he turns around in that message he says don't disbelieve god or believe disbelieve his word ever again when the word died in my place he was resurrected again he become preeminent in my life in my heart he says and and the prophet says it's over when was it over the day that he cried out with a loud voice and said it is finished so he done it hebrews 10 12 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of god the father and because of this offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified and we give god praise and glory and honor and we thank him again for his marvelous grace toward you and i [Applause] adoption moses being a type of christ led the children all the way up to the promised land but joshua took them in divided up the land and gave them the inheritance jesus paid the price but led you all the way up to the holy spirit it says but it's god's holy spirit that will positionally place you into the body and therefore when you look at adoption you realize that adoption is not your birth because the sun is the sun he says but your adoption is your blessing the prophet turns around in adoption too he says i'm trying to get this to you sons of this last day in other words you sons of this dispensation he says that you were predestinated unto adoption in other words you were predestinated into a blessing now what is your pleasing it's to be sons and daughters of god with authority so that's your inheritance that's your sonship the prophet says that's your dominion that's the dominion restored and so that's the reason why jesus christ was raped raised from the dead and his spirit is now dwelling in spirit form in his church in other words he's given his church all of the powers the prophet says and the authority then he turns around the prophet turns around in that message he says but why are you afraid to move he says have you really crossed jordan in other words have you and i to make this come to life in our dispensation have we died out to ourselves have we died out to our own thinking our own abilities and let god step forward the prophet says you can walk walk hand in hand with him in the fellowship what will it be it will be christ in you the hope of glory he says it's the god holy spirit that's going to be moving once again immortal flesh that's that's the restoration that's the reason why he died yes and he too in order to him for him to send down the promise of my father and the prophet says it wants to restore that fellowship it was to restore that unity it was to restore that oneness then he turns around but now go possess that land go possess that holy ghost land this great warrior joshua now taking it out of the things of the world predestinated by god called of god elected by god chosen of god saved by god baptized into the body of christ by the holy spirit and made members of this body it's alive it's ready it's willing the prophet says my shadow will move every time anything of my body moves and he says and the holy spirit body of christ will move just as christ moves he says and if christ in heaven can get this spiritual body on the earth moving as he wants it to move he turns around and he says watch for things to happen what things is going to happen why because it's going to be the same life the prophet turns around he says if the life of christ is in you you're going to do the works of christ and a little bit further i got it under overcomers he says when christ himself came in contact with sickness he rebuked sickness he says when he came into contact with death he raised from the dead now if he can only get that spiritual body to move watch what things are going to happen [Applause] amen now in order to possess this holy ghost land in this dispensation of grace we need overcomers in adoption one he says canaan did not represent the age of the millennium because we know there was bloodshed but it only represented the age of the overcomer that was the dispensation of overcoming in other words they had to fight to possess the land they knew it was theirs they knew it was the inheritance but they had to fight to possess it so that applies then to you and i that we have to fight to possess this land and following the overcomers now he says even if you take it through the church ages and the dispensations of the church ages the prophet says this he says that he had overcomers in every age in other words he always had a witness he was never without a witness through the church ages then he comes to the laudition church age which is this a dispensation he says do you know that this little decent church age is the grandest of all the church ages he says why because it's the ending of time in the blending of eternity no wonder the sages and the uh and the patriarchs have all wanted to live in this age because this the prophet says is the grandest of all the ages yet it's the it's the age with the most sin he says satan is more powerful in this age than he was in any other age he says but he's got an elected group of people he says i've got an elected group of overcomers for this dispensation and here's a group of these overcomers and there's a group on on the live stream you are that elected group of overcomers that's gonna overcome this age we are living in the grandest age the grandest dispensation and god has got an elected group of overcomers the prophet says for this age [Applause] my my adoption four now moses was the type of christ he says he led the children up to the promised land but joshua took them in okay i need to move on the other page sorry now overcome means to stand the test the prophet in that message how can i overcome he says use your greatest example of an overcomer the lord jesus christ and this is what i spoke about earlier he says in every face of sickness because he was the messiah he healed it amen he says when he came into the face of death he brought back to life he says in the very face of his own death he prophesied that you can destroy this body but i will raise it up again in three days the prophet turns around and he says now there is your example of an overcomer how did he do that by the word the prophet says why because he was the word made manifest and that word made manifest said to you in the scriptures if he abide in me and my words abide in you you will ask what you will in other words he's given you the way and he's given you how to overcome it greater is he that's in you than ye that's in the world the prophet says that is how i overcome he says it's not me but it's his word that's in me and if his word is in me then that means that the word is god and he says that's how i overcome it will not be me the prophet says yes sir that's how you will overcome thank you jesus and then he turns around and he says now there's an ark yes sir and that ark is not your denomination yes that ark is not your good works but it's by one spirit which is the holy spirit according to romans 8 1 we are all baptized into that body into that domain of that kingdom by one spiritual baptism the prophet says and once you get under that shed blood he says then you are an overcomer he says and what is it you resting and god is doing the overcoming for you give the lord and the praise for that amen [Applause] you know how can i overcome he says surely that joshua and caleb and him there was obstacles was great he says when the ten spies that came back they said that we look like grasshoppers they weren't lying why because they were professing what they saw the prophet turns in that message he says but joshua and caleb did not look at circumstance they did not look at what they saw they looked at what the word of god said what did the word of god say this is your land this is the land that i give you this is what you you you you overcome and the prophet says now the overcomer takes god at his word it does not matter what sign says and this is we can take it all the way back to abram but you are 100 years old how are you going to be able to conceive but abram's taken not at the promises of god because god said so so you take god at his word and that makes you an overcomer [Applause] we're almost there now to be an overcomer means that there has to be a reward [Music] the prophet says in every age there was a reward promised to the overcomers of that age of that dispensation the first church aids they were given a promise of the crown of life sorry of the tree of life the second church aids their reward was the crown of life the third church age they reward was the hidden manner and a white stone the fourth church age they reward was power and rule over nation over of nations and the morning star the fifth church age they reward was the white raymond and the name on the book of life the sixth church age was the pulley in the house of my father the loud nation church age he says the one that's the most lukewarm church the one that's rich it's increased in goods it's it's need of nothing but the and it's wretched poor blind miserable and naked and there has to be overcomers in that church what is your reward the prophet says the for to you the overcomer in this i give to you to sit with me in my throne and that's the overcomers reward for this dispensation revelations 3 21 says the following he says i grant to you to sit with me in my throne now in how can i overcome the prophet says what is the throne if you look at any kingdom what is the the king's throne the king's throne is his domain that he governs then he turns around and he says now your domain is as far as your borders will reach then he turns around and he says now how far does this king's borders reach he says from eternity to eternity and to you i will grant to sit with me in my domain from eternity to eternity and that's the overcomers reward for this dispensation my my you know how can i overcome he says do you know that the mother of james and john asked him for that position and he says he turns around and he says jesus responded to in other words that place or that position he says the prophet says was not even in existence yes he says but that position would only be granted to them that it was ordained for in other words you have a reservation in other words that seat is reserved only for you it could not be given to the mother of james and john for my one son to sit on my right and the other one on your on your left it was reserved the prophet turns around in that message he says there's a predestinated seed waiting out yonder that this position is reserved for and now we are living in that dispensation we have come all the way now to another ephesians [Applause] and and just as paul had identified it it's going to be by god's grace that he's going to overcome or he will grant it to you to overcome so that he can give you that reward he turns around and he says she will not fail and so to you and i is the overcomers of this day let's press on to the overcomers reward why because now we know what our reward will be and if you're an overcomer you have to be a believer the prophet says you must take the promises of god and you must apply he says you must walk in it and you must trust god to do it take him at his word [Applause] three kinds of believers he says job was a believer amen he says through his trials he believed through his persecutions he believed he says in the very face of the death of his children he believed why because he knew that he was fulfilling the requirement and he and he was of a sacrifice so in other words the prophet says that he did not die but he knew that he came by the way of the word for his day the prophet says and even though his children had died as sinners he says they were waiting for him in glory why because job was a believer and he was an overcomer in his dispensation [Applause] he said so the believer believes regardless of what it sounds like regardless of what anybody else is going to say about it regardless of how impossible it might seem the believer believes give the lord and praise amen now we have to come to another ephesians to this journey and there was a promise made according to revelations 10 7 malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 that there has got to come an ephesians to this journey now the prophet says there must come in ephesians that these seven-fold mysteries of the word of god must be unfolded in this day in this audition church age and the prophet turns around and he says we are here now so to you and i the believer believes we saw it happening in our age we believed it we received that word so that we can make it come to pass [Applause] he says in this great warrior joshua when moses sent those 10 spies over it was in the time of the harvest he says it was the grape time and he says that was a type of pentecost which was the first fruits now pentecost was the gathering in of the first harvest and when they they was at kedis barney at judgment when it was to be determined on whether they would go over and get the holy spirit or not into the land of promise where they promise you say now he says where they promised you say is that the promise the prophet says yes peter said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now that promise was given unto you and to your children he says and to them that's a far off even in chicago and we can say even in our lorado park today as many as the lord our god shall call and we're living now by the evidence of this new land [Music] now in oneness he says now let's take it back to the disciples he says the disciples was walking with him for three and a half years he says they were walking hand in hand with jesus he says they slept with him they ate with him he says they watched and watched him do the miracles he says and yet they did not have it yet but for all of that time he says it was the son of man seeds that was being sown into them and when they received the promise wait there at the city of jerusalem until i send the promise of my father and you will be endured with power from an eye in other words you will send his dynamics power to quicken that seed to life and to you and i we've been living under that day for whatever amount of years you've been in you've been living on that son of man's seed and when he turned around and he said as my father have sent me so am i sending you now and we know how the prophet says this he says how did the father send him he says the father came into him and this is how he will send you an eye [Applause] so acts 4 32 the bible says that they were then in one heart in one soul in one mind the prophet says brother why they had been restored back to that original again and he's referring to the oneness there now the prophet says then now again you know we can talk about it and look at it through the ages they received the dynamics power for that day it's an age that has gone by yet they had to die immortals death eventually now the prophet says this in that message he says the only thing that they had left to be disposed of was an old city and then he turns around and he says that old body called a city or a temple and he's referring to the flesh he says that they had lived in the in here that had to rot because it has to die and corrupt he says but in spirit in life in purpose in vision and everything he says they were one with god now that same promise applies to this age and again i was thinking of it this way we might not all be destined to see the rapture he says but god will send that dynamics power why because again if you look at it it's really just this plan of redemption playing itself out and it doesn't matter whether we're going to die oh you're going to live to be able to see this rapture god's grace has been following me from the foundation of the world so he's got this thing planned out and all i can do is sit back and say wow god's amazing grace to you and i adoption for he brings it to the church ages it says how we were now called out from justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit and the prophet says how justification under luther he says that was a work of grace amen when he caught the revelation he says when wesley uh caught the revelation of sanctification sanctification it was a work of grace restoration of the gifts he says the baptism of the holy spirit is a work of grace and now right into this time which is the coming of the headstone he says the church has got to be so perfectly like christ until christ and the church can unite together by that same spirit he says and if the spirit of christ is in you then it makes you live the life of christ it's gonna make you act the life of christ it's gonna make you do the works of christ he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also that's what jesus said the prophet says we got a ministry coming when he spoke this in in adoption 460 he says we have a ministry coming that's going to be just exactly like the life of christ and he prophesied that for this dispensation and you and i are now living in the manifestation of this prophecy he says what is that ministry going to identify it's going to identify the coming of the lord now when he turns around in that in that quote he says now god and the church is waiting for the church to find its position they without us cannot be made perfect they waiting on you and i to find our position so that you can manifest that ministry and when you manifest that ministry it will identify the coming of the lord why because she's gonna pull on or bring on the resurrection and very soon once that happened the prophet says it's going to be a short quick message that's going to sweep the world 40 days he says what will it be and eventually we will start hearing the knock on our door and that appearing i was reading in the scripture and i told abigail in a message the prophet says that appearing when you see your loved ones it will only be specific people it's not meant for everyone in other words when i and when we hear mom knocking on the door there we're gonna know the resurrection is on why because we're gonna see sister gale in a glorified body once again and we will know at that day that the coming of the lord has come upon us but god and the church the church by the body that has gone on before us is waiting for you to find your position and so that's the reason why we want to press on [Applause] that's the reason why we want to conquer that's the reason why we want to take this inheritance amen [Applause] my now the prophet says he's an adopted son in his ephesus and he speaks about joshua he says if you're an overcomer and if you're a believer you have to speak it so in other words when joshua needed more sunlight it did not help joshua to think about it because a thought will do nothing for you until you speak it and if you have the mind of christ you speak the mind of christ he says and then it materializes it would not have helped joshua on that day to think i wonder if i have to speak to the son if it will stop so he turns around and he says you have to speak it he says joshua was an adopted son in his ephesus and when he turned around and he said son stand still moon hang over agilent he says god was almost obligated to do it on his behalf why because this was an adopted son and he was in authority he says god had to interrupt his program in other words he had to interrupt nature itself and give him those extra minutes in order for him to to he granted him what he spoke now the bride has to become the final age or rather the final voice to the final age and if you don't speak it it won't happen why because you will have the voice of god you know she will be god's voice she will be god's mouthpiece and the way the prophet we know how he preaches he said when she speaks it it will flash like lightning and what she speaks will create itself now he says if you look at joshua he says god never forsook him god never failed him he's done around he turns around and he says god will not fail you god will not forsake you why because he promised you that he will be with you even in you until the end of time [Applause] in divine love and sovereign grace now in this dispensation of another ephesians you and i have to speak it like peter and john at the gate of beautiful when they said look on us silver and gold have i none but what i have i give to you rise up and walk he says satan didn't lift a finger that day when three thousand souls came to salvation he says but as soon as peter and john did that he realized now that that very same power [Music] was now in these men so in other words when jesus christ was on the earth he disrupted satan's kingdom by the spoken word and now he realized that these men has got the same thing so in other words they because they did the same things they realized that they were with jesus and now just throwing it to an end now i want to bring it to our first wave chief now if we're living by the evidence of the new land there was grapes that was brought to us to show us what this land is like [Applause] the prophet speaks about an incident he says when he was on the pulpit yes sir there was this maniac there that shouted insults and the man was going to come and hurt him we all know these stories right the prophet says in in divine love and sovereign grace he says and he was able to do what he was saying he's going to do in other words it was this big man that was going to break your bones and he was coming to threaten the prophet itself the prophet says and all of a sudden i love this man why because i was thinking that he could be someone's father oh and and and he says he loved him but this man was was determined to to come and uh hurt him and he says the prophet turns around in that message he says but all of a sudden i felt sorry for this man but he says this and i want to read it he says the holy spirit begin to speak and as the holy spirit spoke yes obviously we know how he he rebuked the devil in the man he says and all of a sudden the man fell across my feet he says it's it's wonderful to see what god can do when love is the mightiest force that there is so in other words when love projected sovereign grace took over now these are the grips yes exactly little fishy i give you back your life yes sir before the doctors touches my wife let the tumor be gone [Music] now if there was a there was a promise that that's given that there's going to be a ministry exactly like that ministry now i'm drawing to a close yes and i wanted to really just climax into this one with with this thank you the musicians can come up amen and we know the various stories in the prophet's life the boom we were speaking to the bull yes sir and apologizing yes sir to him amen and says to him that look uh you know the way the prophet puts it there he says it's i'm i'm here and he speaks to him in this way he says it's your creator and it's my creator and when he speaks to him with that love yes he says sovereign grace took over yes sir then in divine love and sovereign grace i wanted to read this quote specifically yes and we he speaks on the warnings here amen he says instead of hating those little fellows and trying to fight them i love them and i said little creatures of god i'm the servant of the lord i'm in a hurry and that's the reason why i hit the nest or the fence i said god's people comes in for me to pray for them and i am a servant of the creator who is also your creator now in the name of the lord jesus go back to your nest i won't bother you anymore you go right back to your nest and as god will have the judgment keys at the day of judgment those hornets was just humming as hard as they could you can play something look he says not one of them touched me and one took the lead and every hornet single filed and went right straight back to the nest and went inside the nest the prophet turns around and he says what was it now listen to what he says in this message [Applause] and this is very similar if you take it back all the way to the day of pentecost the prophet says i don't know something happened he says i don't know whether god converted their yearning to hear me or whether he changed my words to their language [Applause] [Music] my that was the manifestation because under this dispensation you can raise to your feet under this dispensation of grace he demonstrated exactly what had happened in the day of pentecost when peter stood up and said repent there was multiple different languages but they all heard what he said now here's the grapes of the of this land he says he changed my words to their language whether a projecting of that love that i had for them but something had taken place and the hornets went back into their nest and now we realize now that you know how god's grace had come through and for me again like i said i just wanted to run it all the way through and we have to come to the realization that we have to possess this land and the prophet says that grace provided us a lamb who took the book and opened the seals [Music] when john stood there crying because he realized that all of humanity is going to be lost there was no wonder it was found worthy no one on the earth no one underneath the earth no one in ages to come no one in ages gone past could do it [Music] and when the elder cried out john behold the line of the tribe of judah has prevailed in other words the prophet says god by his amazing grace provided that lamb to take the book to lose the seals thereof and that was you and i he says god break to us the seals that's on the back of the book now let us enter into this great place and in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to be made manifest and we're now living by the evidence of the new land which is the son of man and we are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man adoption one let's press now into a position the prophet says a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost give the lord and praise amen let's just praise the lord and thank him for his grace and mercy upon our lives thank you for his grace that he sent the message your way thank him that he has opened up the seal [Applause] thank him that he brought the revelation of jesus christ the threefold purpose to you so that you and i can see it and that is god's amazing grace let's give the lord and praise amen hallelujah last quote god by his election grace called you god by his election grace sanctified you god by his election grace and his power baptized you and put you into this land of rest they which have entered into this rest has ceased from their going astray they cease from their works like god did from his they have joy unspeakable and full of glory the tree of life is blooming in them they have long suffering

record with signs and wonders following the believers these signs shall follow them that believe as they go along they heal the sick they cast out devils they speak with tongues they see visions and they walk with god the very same way that adam and eve before the fall had walked with god under this dispensation this is what we will have and they will talk with god no devil can move them they are
