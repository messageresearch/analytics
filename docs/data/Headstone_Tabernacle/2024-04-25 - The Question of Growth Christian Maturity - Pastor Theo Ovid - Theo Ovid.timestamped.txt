[25:25] 22-13 and 1 Corinthians chapter 13 one
[25:29] verse there verse
[25:31] 11 reading from 2 Peter 1
[25:34] verse4 whereby I given unto us exceeding
[25:38] great and precious promises that by
[25:40] these you might be partakers of the

[25:53] Temperance the temperance patience the
[25:55] patience godliness the godliness
[25:57] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[25:59] kindness charity 1 John 2 want to read
[26:04] verse
[26:06] 12 and 13 I write unto you little
[26:09] children because your sins are forgiven
[26:11] you for his name's sake I write unto you
[26:15] fathers because you have known him that
[26:18] is from the beginning i r write unto you
[26:21] young men because you have overcome the
[26:24] wicked one I write unto you little
[26:26] children because you have known
[26:28] the father 1 Corinthians chapter
[26:31] 13 verse
[26:34] 11 it reads whether I was a child I
[26:37] spake as a child I understood as a child
[26:41] I thought as a child uh when I became a
[26:44] man I put away childish things let us
[26:48] pray one more time father God we thank
[26:50] you for your presence and your word and
[26:52] and Lord it takes you to make this word
[26:54] come alive and come real to your people
[26:57] father we're not here for games we're
[26:59] not here for performances we're not here
[27:01] for entertainment we are here to hear
[27:03] truth Lord because you said you shall
[27:05] know the truth and the truth shall set
[27:07] you free we're not here for old talk
[27:10] we're not here to kill time we here to
[27:13] hear from Heaven father may you drop
[27:15] down and speak to your people tonight we
[27:17] wait upon you we are needy have your way
[27:21] I pray in Jesus name I ask it amen God
[27:23] bless you amen you may be seated praise
[27:26] God have a context scripture like to
[27:28] read from 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and
[27:30] this is Paul speaking from 4 to 7 and my
[27:34] speech and my preaching was not with
[27:35] enticing
[27:37] words of man's Wisdom but in
[27:41] demonstration of the spirit and power
[27:44] what was the purpose of that verse 5
[27:46] that your faith should not stand in the
[27:48] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[27:52] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[27:55] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[27:58] this world nor of the princes of this
[28:01] world that come to not but we speak the
[28:04] wisdom of God in the
[28:06] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[28:09] ordained before the found the world unto
[28:12] our Glory oh praise God now this verse
[28:16] here verse 6 in the Amplified says here
[28:20] yet when we are among the full grown
[28:24] there's an echo here brother Francis
[28:28] yet when we are among the full grown or
[28:31] spiritually mature Christians who are
[28:34] right in understanding we do impart a
[28:38] higher wisdom the knowledge of the
[28:41] divine plan previously hidden but it is
[28:45] indeed not a wisdom of this present age
[28:48] nor of this world nor of the leaders and
[28:50] the rulers of this age who are being
[28:52] brought to nothing and are doomed to
[28:54] pass away so this scripture here when we
[28:58] talk about how be it we speak wisdom
[29:00] among them that are perfect that perfect
[29:04] is to them that are mature amen
[29:07] amen fully grown amen spiritually mature
[29:12] and the title I have tonight is the
[29:14] question of
[29:15] growth Christian maturity and another
[29:18] subject why miss the
[29:21] Mark I you know what you know what sin
[29:23] is right to miss the mark to miss the
[29:27] target to miss the objective of what God
[29:30] want you to strike and hit that's what
[29:32] sin really is okay now Paul writing to
[29:39] different churches each Church
[29:41] representing different levels amen the
[29:43] foolish Galatians he called them the
[29:46] Hebrew
[29:47] babies the carnal
[29:49] Corinthians all these different groups
[29:52] or churches represent let's say
[29:55] different stages or growth or experience
[29:59] expences so the caral church at that
[30:01] time was the Corinthians church the
[30:03] church lacking growth the babies and so
[30:06] on was the Hebrews church the legalistic
[30:09] church galatian church but the ideal
[30:12] church was the Ephesians church amen
[30:14] Paul had no issues with those Believers
[30:17] at
[30:19] Ephesus now the Pinnacle of God's ideal
[30:22] church is Ephesians or Ephesus and that
[30:25] is where we are going back to another
[30:27] Ephesians Alpha and Omega the original
[30:29] have to come back again in other words
[30:31] the corn of seed that went down into the
[30:33] ground it went through processes and
[30:35] come back up bring back the corner seed
[30:37] in this last day again because God works
[30:39] just as nature works hallu you have a
[30:41] seed you plant it it go through
[30:43] processes and it comes back to the
[30:45] original amen so the church Ages was the
[30:48] expression of the unfolding of the
[30:50] mystery of what was lock up in the seed
[30:53] and so is your
[30:54] life Hallelujah your life itself goes
[30:58] two processes amen for you to come to
[31:00] maturity the objective is to come to
[31:03] maturity Hallelujah so he said I write
[31:05] you children that's a stage I write to
[31:08] you young men that's another stage I
[31:10] write them to you fathers that's another
[31:12] stage the object is to get it to
[31:15] fatherhood because you know him from the
[31:17] beginning the object is not for you to
[31:19] come to church a lot of people get old
[31:22] in church they're not mature they
[31:23] haven't grown he objected for you to
[31:25] grow in God because asking to be closer
[31:28] to God that's our desire I want to be
[31:31] closer to you you want to be closer to
[31:34] you he give you Faith Oh Glory to God to
[31:36] St you to get closer then after Faith he
[31:39] give you virtue Oh Glory to God you're
[31:41] getting closer to him then he give you
[31:43] knowledge you want oh you're getting
[31:44] nearer to him now then you get
[31:46] Temperance you get patience Peter talk
[31:48] about these things by these divine
[31:51] nature we become partaker of his divine
[31:53] nature in order to come closer to God
[31:57] and a brotherly
[31:58] you're ready there to T the Holy Spirit
[32:00] right on top of there and then
[32:02] charity come now the bond of perfectness
[32:05] to cover you with that robe to seal all
[32:09] those virtues inside of you that there
[32:11] be no leaks in the building when I was a
[32:14] child I spake like a child I understood
[32:16] as a child but when I became a man I put
[32:18] away childish things I pushed them aside
[32:22] because I'm coming into Christian
[32:23] maturity could we give the Lord some

[35:25] there's a mind of God you're not lost is
[35:29] not impossible when Moses was brought to
[35:31] the Red Sea mountains on both sides and
[35:34] Pharaoh coming down breathing on his
[35:36] back there was a mind of God behind it
[35:39] Moses sought to cry out and say God
[35:41] what's going on Moses sought to do that
[35:43] God said why cry speak and move forward
[35:46] God saw a way where there was no way God
[35:49] saw a way through the Red Sea and
[35:52] sometime you're looking up you're
[35:53] looking down you're looking around and

[36:42] what the father want done with the word
[36:44] real
[36:45] Christianity mature Christians not just

[36:52] the intimacy of knowing
[36:55] him the person
[36:58] hallah huj what we have now is an
[37:00] intellectual Bunch people that have a
[37:02] lot of knowledge just knowledge shall
[37:03] increase you have people who know quite
[37:05] a lot but they don't know
[37:07] him and not the knowledge is
[37:10] life to know him is life the person
[37:16] Hallelujah are you with me now glory to
[37:18] God so Hebrews 5 says for when for okay
[37:23] uh Paul there's an example Hebrews 52 12
[37:28] for when for when for the time you ought
[37:30] to be teachers you have need that one
[37:33] tissue again which be the first
[37:35] principle of the Oracles of God and have
[37:38] become such as have need of milk and not
[37:41] of strong meat for everyone that is use
[37:43] that milk is unskillful in the word of
[37:45] righteousness for he's a babe so baby is
[37:49] a stage child is a stage young man is a
[37:53] stage isn't that right and fathers is a
[37:56] stage
[38:00] Hallelujah hallu so he said but strong
[38:02] meat belongeth to them that are fool ag
[38:04] even those who by reason of use have
[38:08] their senses exercised to discern yes
[38:13] both good and evil so what does that
[38:16] tell you about somebody who can't
[38:17] discern good and evil they're not mature
[38:20] they need to grow something is lacking
[38:23] so this is beyond the battle with sin
[38:26] and that's truck Sunday when I just said
[38:29] some myself but never said that before
[38:32] this is not talking about overcoming sin
[38:33] and sin and sin no this is grow now and
[38:36] to grow you have to get birth to grow
[38:39] bir then grow isn't that right now the
[38:42] word to miss the mark in the Greek
[38:45] Lexicon is a word called hamaa h a m a r
[38:48] t i e it means to miss the mark am to to
[38:53] be mistaken right to miss or wonder from
[38:56] the part of of uprightness and honor to
[38:59] wonder from the law of God to violate
[39:03] God's law and sin a violation of Divine
[39:06] Law in thought or in
[39:09] act the miss the mark describe falling
[39:12] short of God's standards or commands I

[39:26] Living God hallelujah
[39:28] I try to show you over and over the
[39:31] promise that God gave Abraham to deliver
[39:33] his people and they come out and 400
[39:35] years and so on it be a Strange Land and
[39:36] so on that is a promise God gave to
[39:38] Abraham okay The People Under Pressure
[39:41] the under Pharaoh but they don't know
[39:44] God God spoke to Abraham Abraham knew
[39:46] God Isaac knew God that's why he said

[39:51] Abraham Isaac and Jacob these men met
[39:53] God spoke to God you understand I'm
[39:56] saying then them million people there

[40:06] them by my
[40:08] law by my word that's right that they

[42:35] mark falling short of God's
[42:38] standards or commands as in the
[42:40] scriptures to miss the
[42:43] markah this implies not just making
[42:47] mistakes but failing to live up to the
[42:50] moral and ethical
[42:53] standards set by God James 4:17 says
[42:57] therefore to him that knoweth to do
[43:01] good and doeth it not to him it is sin
[43:06] amen so he's not talking about you going
[43:08] and do sin he's talking about so that
[43:12] sin can also be a failure to do what is
[43:19] right think on that tonight
[43:23] sa take a pause on that we not talking
[43:26] about going do wickedness and El but
[43:29] failure to do what
[43:31] is
[43:33] right and that's why when people don't
[43:36] do all that they're supposed to do which
[43:39] is the mechanics getting your heart
[43:41] right doing what is right you can't have
[43:43] full
[43:45] confidence you can't present Amen to God
[43:48] your full faith am because you are
[43:50] shorten
[43:55] him if you're not praying you're not
[43:57] studying you're not reading you're not
[43:59] in the word you're not in the spirit
[44:00] you're coming you're loing then you're
[44:03] loing and other people

[44:08] yourself you're lazy Hallelujah but
[44:11] nobody want to tell you that I tell you
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] thatl that is not
[44:18] maturity that you are
[44:21] slacker my father long time when

[44:26] pants whatever the expression it is I
[44:29] just say slacker on a Chinese
[44:33] pants you real
[44:37] slack 1 John 34:9
[44:40] says what whosoever committed sin
[44:45] transgresses also the law for sin is the
[44:50] transgression of the law and you know he
[44:53] was manifested to take away our sins and
[44:57] and in him is no sin look how this word
[44:59] is being presented okay sin you're
[45:02] breaking the law but he was manifested
[45:03] to take it away from us that we in other
[45:06] words he dealt with the same question we
[45:09] we shouldn't have to deal with that
[45:10] again oh Glory my God we should close
[45:13] off right here right now you could shout
[45:15] on that one tonight Jesus when he paid
[45:18] the price on Calvary he de with the same
[45:20] question once this man hey offered his
[45:24] blood once and w perfected forever them
[45:29] that are Sanctified oh God help me
[45:31] tonight oh glory to God I'm in Heavenly
[45:33] places tonight he has perfected forever
[45:37] them that are Sanctified in other words
[45:39] he answered the question of sin at
[45:42] Calvary now we have a question of growth
[45:45] oh give the Lord a shout that's a
[45:47] question Oh Glory to God if you're going
[45:50] to stay in this way forgive me Lord
[45:52] forgive me Lord I did wrong and forgive
[45:53] and you're inside of there or you want
[45:55] to grow in God hallelujah
[45:57] am like how God tell Abraham walk before
[45:59] me and be th
[46:04] perfect and he know he was manifested to
[46:06] take away our sins and in him is no sin
[46:09] whosoever abideth in him sinth not
[46:11] whosoever sinth had not seen him neither
[46:14] know him little children let no man
[46:17] deceive you he that doth righteousness
[46:19] is righteous even as he is righteous he
[46:22] commits sins of the devil for the devil
[46:24] sinned from the beginning for this
[46:25] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[46:27] that he might destroy the works of the
[46:29] devil that's right whosoever is born of
[46:32] God do not commit sin for his seed
[46:34] remain in him and he cannot sin because
[46:36] he's born of God now here this in the
[46:40] Amplified everyone who commits practices
[46:42] sin is guilty of
[46:44] lawlessness not just commits but
[46:48] practices that is what sin is
[46:51] lawlessness the breaking violating of
[46:55] God's law by trans transgression or
[46:58] neglect being unrestrained unregulated
[47:02] by his commands and his will in other
[47:04] words you do your own thing and still
[47:05] come to church right because you have no
[47:08] accountability and nobody's looking over
[47:10] your shoulder and that's why people like
[47:13] legalism Pastor that's why they like
[47:15] generals and militant generals because
[47:17] they don't have
[47:20] internal internal discipline and they
[47:22] want somebody to discipline them to
[47:24] bring a whip and they beat them and they
[47:26] straighten up left turn right turn and
[47:28] whatnot and they expose this they expose
[47:29] that and they feel good about that
[47:32] because somebody and the external amen
[47:35] is doing it Hallelujah but that is what
[47:37] the law was Thou shalt not commit
[47:39] adultery Thou shalt not steal that was
[47:41] external and it still couldn't work oh
[47:45] glory to God so he said I'm going to put
[47:47] my laws inside your heart oh give the
[47:50] Lord a sh because the law on the outside
[47:53] couldn't
[47:54] work th sh not cover the neighbor wife
[47:57] Thou shalt not cover the neighbor's
[48:00] Goods oh give the Lord a shout the law
[48:03] couldn't work
[48:06] Hallelujah so then God bring Grace in
[48:09] the person of Jesus Christ to give an
[48:11] opportunity to get that law that was the
[48:13] outside and the inside that you can get
[48:16] the internal restraint or
[48:19] [Applause]
[48:21] discipline
[48:23] hallelujah what I want to show you the
[48:25] external couldn't bring them to matur
[48:29] even Jesus told them I have to go if I
[48:32] don't go the comforter will not come I
[48:34] am with you but shall be in you he knew
[48:37] the power they needed to withstand the
[48:38] devil the power they needed to overcome
[48:41] had to come on the inside the anointing
[48:43] they had to share in his ministry was
[48:46] temporary power but he was promising and
[48:48] permanent power oh give the Lord I shout
[48:51] out of your bellies shall flow rivers of
[48:53] Living Water oh give the Lord a shout in
[48:56] the house he that believeth on me as the
[48:58] scripture had
[49:00] [Applause]
[49:05] saides God above us God With Us God in
[49:07] us amen God coming down Hallelujah
[49:13] Hallelujah unrestrained unregulated by
[49:16] his commands and his will you know that
[49:18] he appeared in visible form and became
[49:21] man to take away upon himself sins and
[49:24] in him there's no sin for six this is
[49:27] the part I want to get to no one who
[49:29] abides in him who lives and remains in
[49:33] communion with and obedience to him
[49:37] deliberately
[49:39] knowingly habitually commits or
[49:42] practices
[49:44] sin no one who habitually sins had
[49:48] either seen or known him and he went
[49:51] down deeper recognize perceive or
[49:55] understood him or had an
[49:58] experiential acquaintance with him
[50:01] that's how deep it is I love this
[50:05] tonight I hope that this is edifying to
[50:08] you boys lad let no one deceive you and
[50:11] Lead You astr he who practices
[50:13] righteousness who is upright conforming
[50:15] to the Divine will and purpose thought
[50:17] and action living a consistently
[50:20] conscientious life is righteous even as
[50:23] he is righteous Hallelujah no one
[50:27] begotten of God deliberately knowingly
[50:32] habitually practices sin for God's
[50:35] nature abides in him his principle of
[50:38] Life the Divine sperm remains
[50:41] permanently within him and he cannot
[50:44] practice sinning because he is born or
[50:47] begotten of God and the Bible says that
[50:50] was not born of the will of man nor of
[50:53] the will of flesh but of B but of God so
[50:57] your birth have to be Supernatural your
[50:59] birth can't be coming to church and say
[51:01] what you believe I don't care what you
[51:03] believe something supernatural has to
[51:05] happen on the inside oh give the Lord a
[51:08] shout born of God just as you was born
[51:11] of a woman you have to be born of God
[51:14] born of the word and born of the spirit

[53:27] in the
[53:28] wilderness where your fathers tried my
[53:30] patience and tested my forbearance and
[53:34] found I stood their test and they saw my
[53:37] works for 40 years and so I was
[53:41] provoked displeased and sorely grieved

[1:13:57] the sun that is shining today bringing
[1:14:00] the wheat up in Canada that same Sun it
[1:14:03] didn't have no more Sun than that this
[1:14:05] coming July or August it could never
[1:14:07] ripen the green it's got to be stronger
[1:14:10] and more powerful each day as it grows
[1:14:13] and matures to bring the green on so the
[1:14:16] son have a job the sun job is to bring
[1:14:21] that grain to maturity
[1:14:25] so that's why the prophet talk about the
[1:14:26] hot July sun because when the grain is
[1:14:29] green and the shock hole in it is green
[1:14:31] you don't know who is who but when the
[1:14:33] sun start to hit it so the Shar start to
[1:14:37] dry up and the grain becomes golden
[1:14:39] brown by the same Sun Hallelujah so that
[1:14:42] sun dries up one and ripens another oh
[1:14:46] give the Lord some
[1:14:48] Praises glory to God so the seed in you
[1:14:51] will come to maturity by this son this s
[1:14:55] so n this Holy Spirit Dynamics to the
[1:14:58] mechanics this Pillar of Fire Oh Glory
[1:15:02] to God will dry up the church member and
[1:15:04] go to ripen the elect to give the Lord
[1:15:06] some
[1:15:08] Praises oh how many feel good with this
[1:15:11] world
[1:15:12] tonight oh you have been elected and
[1:15:15] predestinated you call for this
[1:15:18] hour woo hallelujah hallelujah hallu if
[1:15:23] the grain itself it begins to mature the
[1:15:27] grain comes on it stays right what each
[1:15:30] day the husk around it the part of
[1:15:31] calcium whatever it goes in it builds
[1:15:33] right into the green as the sun gets
[1:15:35] stronger but you take the Sun that
[1:15:36] shines in August and put it on the wheat
[1:15:38] to day it will kill
[1:15:40] it so the July Sun August Sun can't work
[1:15:45] on the February wheat it will kill it
[1:15:49] it's too much of heat God had to make
[1:15:52] sure things dry around you that you're
[1:15:54] ready for that son now some people can't
[1:15:57] handle the son they want to cuss they
[1:15:59] want to leave they want to give up and
[1:16:01] everything else because the heat upon
[1:16:03] them but the elect the child of your
[1:16:06] faith is more precious than gold that
[1:16:09] perisheth God put heat for your
[1:16:12] faith faith that can't be tested can't
[1:16:16] be trusted so God has test your faith
[1:16:19] that it can be trusted oh give the Lord

[1:24:37] to God hallelujah I'm going to close
[1:24:39] with
[1:24:42] this Hallelujah but I'm talking about
[1:24:44] Elijah Hallelujah Juniper Tre struggling
[1:24:48] angel food and then he needed a rest how
[1:24:51] we need in this journey and we are now
[1:24:54] to find a place of rest and to Feast on
[1:24:57] the word of God so that it will give us
[1:24:59] strength night after night go to the
[1:25:01] room and rest come back next morning
[1:25:03] fresh eat more for there's a great
[1:25:05] journey and a great battle ahead for the
[1:25:07] church I believe that we have been
[1:25:09] children long enough God is going to
[1:25:12] turn his church into manhood now we have
[1:25:15] played and Frolic as children but now we
[1:25:18] are going to have to put away childish
[1:25:20] things and take on manhood maturity I
[1:25:24] believe it was Paul who said when I was
[1:25:26] a child I spake as a child because he
[1:25:29] thought as a child but it's time that we
[1:25:31] begin to think like men and women now
[1:25:33] for we've got to get down to
[1:25:36] business so the church here we go is not
[1:25:39] in its right state yet we have to
[1:25:42] remember that it is not matured so we
[1:25:46] just have to linger and do the best we
[1:25:48] can and there is no one here we go there
[1:25:51] is no one can bring it to maturity
[1:25:54] only the Holy
[1:25:57] Spirit as we listen to it I don't
[1:26:01] believe it will ever come by man it will
[1:26:04] come by God oh glory to God so Jesus he
[1:26:09] was the first son all right two minutes
[1:26:12] Hallelujah that come to full maturity to
[1:26:14] be in God and because he was the first

[1:26:22] testimony that other Sons will come and
[1:26:25] be matured oh give the Lord some Praises

[1:26:38] according to Luke 17:30 that the word is
[1:26:40] to wave over the people that the de
[1:26:42] tradition of men is dead and the Son of
[1:26:45] God is alive again with the baptism of
