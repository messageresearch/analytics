[1:08:26] uh I want to read 30 verses if you don't
[1:08:29] mind amen by the time we finish reading
[1:08:32] Jesus our lord preaching to us we can
[1:08:34] close on it yeah but if you permit we'll
[1:08:37] say some few words on it and uh we'll
[1:08:40] trust that the Lord will help us but
[1:08:42] let's enjoy the sermon from the Lord
[1:08:45] himself John chapter 10 from verse 1
[1:08:50] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:08:54] enter not by the door into the sheep
[1:08:58] fold but clth up some other way the same
[1:09:02] is a thief and a robber a thief and a
[1:09:06] robber Jesus said
[1:09:09] so but it that entereth in by the door
[1:09:13] is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the
[1:09:17] porter open it and the sheep hear his
[1:09:20] voice and he colth his own Sheep by name
[1:09:25] and leaded them out and when he puted
[1:09:29] forth his own sheep he goth before them
[1:09:31] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[1:09:34] his voice so the proof of the sheep
[1:09:38] being the Sheep of this Shepherd is that
[1:09:40] they know his voice amen amen and a
[1:09:44] stranger will they not follow but we
[1:09:47] flee from him for they know not the
[1:09:51] voice of
[1:09:53] strangers this Parable spake Jesus unto
[1:09:55] them but they understood not what things
[1:09:58] they were which he spake unto them then
[1:10:02] said Jesus unto them we want to try and
[1:10:04] understand it tonight if he will help us
[1:10:07] then said Jesus unto them verily verily
[1:10:10] I say unto you I am the door of the
[1:10:13] sheep all that ever came before me are
[1:10:17] thieves and robbers so it may not be one
[1:10:21] but as many as they are they are thieves
[1:10:24] and they are robbers but the Sheep did
[1:10:26] not hear them I am the door by me if any
[1:10:30] man enter him he shall be saved and
[1:10:34] shall go in and out and find
[1:10:38] pasture the thief cometh not but for to
[1:10:41] steal and to kill and to destroy I am
[1:10:45] come that they might have life and that
[1:10:48] they might have it more
[1:10:50] abundantly I am the Good Shepherd I like
[1:10:54] that word
[1:10:55] Christ introduced himself he even
[1:10:58] qualified himself I am the Good Shepherd
[1:11:03] the Good Shepherd give his life for the
[1:11:05] Sheep but he that is an harling and not
[1:11:09] the shepherd whose own the Sheep are not
[1:11:13] seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the
[1:11:16] sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catched
[1:11:20] them and Scattered the
[1:11:22] Sheep the hiring fleeth because he is
[1:11:26] anhing and care not for the Sheep I am
[1:11:29] the Good Shepherd
[1:11:32] affirmatively and know my sheep and I'm
[1:11:36] known of mine as the father knoweth me
[1:11:40] even so know I the father and I lay down
[1:11:43] my life for the sheep and other sheep I
[1:11:47] have which are not of this fold them
[1:11:51] also I must bring and they shall hear my
[1:11:55] voice and there shall be one fold and
[1:11:59] one Shepherd now that is the scripture
[1:12:02] that applies to you and
[1:12:04] I because his visible audience here was
[1:12:07] the Jewish Brethren are you following
[1:12:11] but he made it clear to them that other
[1:12:13] sheep I have they don't belong to the
[1:12:15] Jewish or the Samaritan food amen and I
[1:12:19] must bring them in
[1:12:20] also I'm glad he has those in mind and
[1:12:24] we have our appointed time an appointed
[1:12:28] season amen uh the Jews being preached
[1:12:31] to First did not give them a better
[1:12:35] Advantage he called the Jews his
[1:12:37] Brethren the Samaritans he called his
[1:12:40] friends but they gentiy call his
[1:12:44] bride among these three people who has
[1:12:47] the closest intimacy with a man come on
[1:12:51] friends so we have our appointed time we
[1:12:54] have our appointed season and in that
[1:12:57] season we must come
[1:12:59] in the seventh trumpet will bring in the
[1:13:03] Jew the seven seal will bring in the
[1:13:06] Gentile bride to the same
[1:13:13] atonement all right all right all right
[1:13:15] all right we just want to tell a story
[1:13:18] okay let's go
[1:13:19] on verse 17 therefore th my father love
[1:13:23] me because because I lay down my life
[1:13:27] that I might take it again no man taketh
[1:13:30] it from me but I lay it down of myself I
[1:13:33] have power to lay it down and I have
[1:13:36] power to take it again this commandment
[1:13:39] have I received of my
[1:13:41] father there was a division therefore
[1:13:44] again among the Jews for these Saints
[1:13:47] and many of them said he had the devil
[1:13:49] and is mad why hear him others said
[1:13:54] these are not the words of him that ha a
[1:13:57] devil can the devil Open the Eyes of the
[1:14:01] blind so it is their word against
[1:14:05] them and it was at Jerusalem the Feast
[1:14:09] of the dedication and it was Winter and
[1:14:12] Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's
[1:14:15] porch then came the Jews round about him
[1:14:18] and said unto him how long does thou
[1:14:20] make us to doubt if thou be the Christ
[1:14:24] tell us plainly
[1:14:25] Jesus answered them you know they were
[1:14:27] saying tell us plainly as if they will
[1:14:30] believe Jesus answered them I told you
[1:14:33] and you believe not the works that I do
[1:14:35] in my father's name they bear witness of
[1:14:37] me but ye believe not because ye are not
[1:14:41] of my
[1:14:42] sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear
[1:14:45] my voice and I know them and they follow
[1:14:49] me our voice is connected to
[1:14:52] followership here all right please take
[1:14:54] not not and I give unto them eternal
[1:14:57] life and they shall never perish neither
[1:15:02] shall any man plug them out of my hand
[1:15:06] my Father which gave them me is greater
[1:15:09] than all and no man is able to plug them
[1:15:14] out of my father's hand I and that my
[1:15:17] father are
[1:15:19] one may the Lord add His blessings to
[1:15:23] the read of his holy word
[1:15:25] God bless you you may please be
[1:15:31] seated we want to thank the Lord very
[1:15:33] much

[1:15:38] you musicians God bless you s
[1:15:41] amen uh tonight and this season for the
[1:15:45] privilege the Lord give unto us to
[1:15:48] gather in his presence again amen and uh
[1:15:52] we want to specially thank our dear
[1:15:54] pastor
[1:15:55] uh Theo ID and his associate brother
[1:15:59] Isaac oid brother
[1:16:02] Tony ministers and all the rest the
[1:16:04] board of the church the entire Saints uh
[1:16:08] for their accommodation their invitation
[1:16:11] to us uh to come and rejoice at the feet
[1:16:14] of Christ one more time at this time uh
[1:16:18] a lot of things and a lot of spending
[1:16:21] sacrifices in time energy resources go
[1:16:24] in to this amen uh but I know uh the
[1:16:29] things that God honor most are things
[1:16:31] that go with one sacrifice of the other
[1:16:34] I want them to know which I know they
[1:16:36] know but I'm affirming it assuredly that
[1:16:39] God will never forget your Libor of love
[1:16:42] all that you are doing for the kingdom
[1:16:44] uh they are investments and God will
[1:16:47] repay you back in several fold in the
[1:16:49] name of Jesus Christ like the prophet we
[1:16:52] say they have done their part and it is
[1:16:55] for we that come to really take
[1:16:58] advantage of this opportunity uh to EMB
[1:17:02] better our lives and I believe through
[1:17:04] the preaching of the word and fellowship
[1:17:06] one with one another uh we will go home
[1:17:09] better than we came greetings thank you
[1:17:12] greetings to everyone who had come from
[1:17:15] everywhere uh you're coming both in the
[1:17:19] Highland and outside the country uh it's
[1:17:22] a blessing and it's an encouragement to
[1:17:25] any servant of God who stands behind the
[1:17:27] sacred desk I say it everywhere that uh
[1:17:31] the gospel is not meant for cheers of
[1:17:33] our benches it is meant for human beings
[1:17:36] so it is always a privilege when the
[1:17:38] Lord give us people to speak to and we
[1:17:40] will never take that for granted we will
[1:17:43] do our best uh in the grace that God
[1:17:45] give unto us uh to be a blessing or at
[1:17:49] least to be of service to the people of
[1:17:51] God thank you for coming you encourag me
[1:17:54] tonight ton
[1:17:59] amen I bring the greetings of the Saints
[1:18:03] back in Nigeria a good portion of them
[1:18:05] is represented here and many others many
[1:18:08] more others who couldn't come uh told us
[1:18:11] to pass their greetings both the
[1:18:13] Servants of God and our congregations
[1:18:15] and all the loved ones they told us to
[1:18:17] give their greetings to the convention
[1:18:20] some said I should mention their name
[1:18:22] but you see if I mention them I don't
[1:18:23] know in fact one or two of them stress
[1:18:26] it I forgotten their name right now so
[1:18:29] just uh just take it that uh the names
[1:18:32] that I didn't the names I couldn't
[1:18:34] mention send
[1:18:37] greetings so if anybody says did you if
[1:18:41] you meet anyone and he says did he pass
[1:18:43] our greeting just help me put it
[1:18:45] together he passed their greetings so
[1:18:48] and the Lord will bless you as you give
[1:18:50] me a
[1:18:51] cover God bless you uh we want to thank
[1:18:55] the Lord for all the Servants of God uh
[1:18:58] that have gone before uh before me I was
[1:19:02] telling uh this great men of God before
[1:19:06] after they finish praying with me and
[1:19:08] they come into the audience uh I said uh
[1:19:12] the men of God the preachers have
[1:19:14] preached uh what we are to do we 2x4 is
[1:19:18] just to do a buffer to encourage the
[1:19:19] people then Pastor L was saying if you
[1:19:21] are talking like that how about me
[1:19:24] I said I said you are father preacher so
[1:19:27] there
[1:19:29] not so so we we trust with the Lord that
[1:19:33] he will help us one more time so if God
[1:19:36] will be our help which I trust he will
[1:19:38] tonight and um I just want to speak just
[1:19:42] to encourage you on a subject I called
[1:19:45] The Shepherd's
[1:19:47] business amen the shepherd's business
[1:19:51] the business of the shepherd amen the
[1:19:54] sheep has his own business the shepherd
[1:19:56] has his own business and it's nice for
[1:19:59] us not to confuse the two activity so if
[1:20:02] we stay in our lane and the shepherd
[1:20:04] stay in his Lane life will be a lot
[1:20:06] easier so that's what I trust that he
[1:20:08] will help us in the time we have before
[1:20:11] us our Lord is preaching here and he
[1:20:14] said verily verily I say unto you he
[1:20:17] that entered North by the door into the
[1:20:21] ship fold but climed of some other way
[1:20:27] the same is a thief and a
[1:20:30] robber now this particular verse is not
[1:20:35] referring to the Sheep who straight into
[1:20:38] the ship
[1:20:40] fold this particular verse is referring
[1:20:44] to a
[1:20:47] Shepherd uh who tries to
[1:20:50] impersonate the real Shepherd
[1:20:54] all right so it's not a scripture for
[1:20:56] the Sheep it's a scripture for the
[1:21:00] shepherd Jesus Christ want you to know
[1:21:03] very
[1:21:05] affirmatively that he is the only
[1:21:10] Shepherd onefold one
[1:21:15] Shepherd amen now then you will turn to
[1:21:18] this side I'm glad they are sitting here
[1:21:20] thank you they love me so well they
[1:21:23] haven't sat here before
[1:21:25] now but they realize how weak I am and
[1:21:29] they choose to back me up God bless you
[1:21:35] s thank you I appreciate that now then
[1:21:39] you may look here or you look into the
[1:21:41] audience and say but what about our
[1:21:44] pastors you call them the right name
[1:21:46] they our pastors amen Pastor has a
[1:21:51] pastoral service the Pastoral service is
[1:21:54] for them to feed the sheep on behalf of
[1:21:58] the owner of the
[1:22:01] sheep the owner of the sheep is the
[1:22:07] shepherd but pastors are those
[1:22:11] engaged to Fe the sheep on behalf of the
[1:22:17] shepherd so it is not their business to
[1:22:21] look for the food for the Sheep
[1:22:25] it is the shepherd's
[1:22:28] business he must furnish the food then
[1:22:32] they will feed the
[1:22:34] sheep so I'm not attacking their
[1:22:38] position they are pastors but I'm
[1:22:40] talking of the
[1:22:44] shepherd all right so he said there if a
[1:22:50] Shepherd is laying claim to a Sheepfold
[1:22:53] a Sheepfold is an environment the
[1:22:56] collection of
[1:22:58] sheep and he did not lay claim to itat
[1:23:02] by the right form of
[1:23:04] purchase he is a thief and a
[1:23:10] robber because something must qualify
[1:23:13] you to be The Shepherd of the
[1:23:16] sheep are you with me now what qualifies
[1:23:21] in this case is that there must be a
[1:23:23] purchase
[1:23:25] and the purchased price in this case is
[1:23:28] the price of death that releases the
[1:23:35] blood I want us to follow me you will
[1:23:39] just follow the story that releases the
[1:23:42] priz of the blood now I know today there
[1:23:46] are people who are willing to die for
[1:23:50] the cause that they believe
[1:23:53] in so dying today is not a big deal
[1:23:57] we've seen politicians we've seen
[1:23:59] activists we've seen great people and
[1:24:02] we've seen people with dear that as I
[1:24:04] can die over this matter and they will
[1:24:07] die but in this particular case your
[1:24:10] death will be a waste of time because
[1:24:13] you must not only be able to Die the
[1:24:17] price you are offering by your death
[1:24:19] must have the capacity to be accepted
[1:24:22] [Applause]
[1:24:24] if your price is not acceptable you
[1:24:28] cannot lay claim to this
[1:24:32] sheep so death is fine but the price
[1:24:36] that comes from your death is what we
[1:24:38] are looking
[1:24:40] at are you
[1:24:42] following and uh uh brother Stephan said
[1:24:47] we on a campaign
[1:24:49] ground yeah I love that and there's a
[1:24:53] campaign to T night between a stranger
[1:24:56] and a Good
[1:24:57] Shepherd I want you to know the side I
[1:25:00] belong to quickly I'm on the side of the
[1:25:03] Good Shepherd so I'm going to campaign
[1:25:06] for him and I'm going to demaret the
[1:25:10] [Applause]
[1:25:12] stranger I will demaret him I will make
[1:25:15] him unattractive for you so that if you
[1:25:18] have been follow him you throw him away
[1:25:27] so you know this stranger there's just
[1:25:30] one
[1:25:32] impostor because there's only one guy
[1:25:35] who wanted to lay claim to the Sheep
[1:25:37] just as the Lord so when Christ is
[1:25:41] talking here he knew who he was
[1:25:43] referring to amen for now I will call
[1:25:46] him the
[1:25:48] stranger all right this stranger in the
[1:25:51] Book of Ruth was offered an opportunity
[1:25:54] to
[1:25:55] purchase amen because boas was not the
[1:25:59] first person who has the right to redeem
[1:26:02] Ruth do you realize that why because in
[1:26:07] Genesis 3 somebody brought about Genesis
[1:26:10] 3 somebody occasions the fall amen and
[1:26:14] the person who occasions the fall
[1:26:16] introduce a nature that makes us
[1:26:18] children of Wrath so by being children
[1:26:21] of Wrath he became qualified to have a f
[1:26:24] chance at you and high amen I told you
[1:26:28] last year that that is why everybody who
[1:26:31] died including the Saints he wants to
[1:26:33] lay claim to their body amen until
[1:26:37] Christ uh you know Archangel Michael had
[1:26:40] to dispute the body of Moses because
[1:26:42] he's got a future work with him are you
[1:26:45] following all right so this men was
[1:26:48] offered
[1:26:50] Redemption but this stranger love to
[1:26:53] take possession possession without
[1:26:56] willing to pay the price of
[1:26:58] possession so when he was offered he was
[1:27:02] exited then boa said if you will redeem
[1:27:05] this you must be ready to do
[1:27:08] this then the stranger said no I cannot
[1:27:12] do it and attempt to do it with M my
[1:27:15] inheritance he said boys go ahead so
[1:27:19] this stranger was not willing to pay the
[1:27:22] price yet he wanted possession let me
[1:27:25] tell you Satan is not ready to pay your
[1:27:28] price but he wanted your
[1:27:31] possession let me tell you your value is
[1:27:34] too high to be taken by the devil
[1:27:39] cheaply this is why Jesus Christ said
[1:27:43] he's an impostor he's a thief and a
[1:27:46] robber he's a thief and a robber that
[1:27:50] wants to enjoy something without willing
[1:27:53] to pay for him
[1:27:54] he wants to steal it when it was not
[1:28:02] given so that's what that's what this
[1:28:04] verse is referring to and the Lord said
[1:28:07] be very very weary of him be very very
[1:28:11] wey of him let's continue let's continue
[1:28:14] and he said he that enter him by the
[1:28:18] door is The Shepherd of the
[1:28:22] sheep so Satan The Stranger does not
[1:28:25] want to enter by the
[1:28:27] door he doesn't want to meet the price
[1:28:31] he couldn't stand the Pains of gsim many
[1:28:34] he couldn't stand the Pains of Calvary
[1:28:37] and yet he wanted a lordship in your
[1:28:39] life it's not
[1:28:43] possible your Redemption wasn't a cheap
[1:28:47] thing so you cannot cheapen your
[1:28:50] life your worth and your value is too
[1:28:53] great
[1:28:55] amen don't throw away your virtue for
[1:28:58] pennies don't throw it away for iPhones
[1:29:02] Hallelujah you have a greater value than
[1:29:06] that your Redemption wasn't cheap it ca
[1:29:10] God his own
[1:29:13] life and you have more worth to God than
[1:29:17] his own blood that was why he was
[1:29:20] willing to give up his blood so that he
[1:29:23] can help
[1:29:28] you Mr stranger you are in trouble
[1:29:31] tonight because I will demaret you so
[1:29:35] [Applause]
[1:29:42] bad he that entereth in by the door that
[1:29:47] is a real Shepherd there was only one
[1:29:51] who entered him by the door he first
[1:29:54] gets him many and he has to battle over
[1:29:58] his own will as 100% man or the will of
[1:30:03] father as 100% God and I can hear Jesus
[1:30:08] said not my will let thy will be done
[1:30:13] and he went to the cross of Calvary and
[1:30:16] he paid the price and he declared it is
[1:30:20] finished the Bible said the one that
[1:30:23] entered in by the door is the one to
[1:30:26] whom the porter opens to when the price
[1:30:29] is accepted the poters have no option
[1:30:33] they've got to open the door that was
[1:30:35] why when Jesus said it is finished
[1:30:38] Hallelujah three things happen in three
[1:30:40] different dimensions on Earth in heaven
[1:30:44] and in hell oh Hallelujah on Earth the
[1:30:48] veil of the temple rented the port has
[1:30:52] opened
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:56] the cherubims who were guarding the part
[1:30:59] of the tree of life they had to
[1:31:02] their short they have to step aside for
[1:31:05] the man who is qualified to come inside
[1:31:08] The Potters of God
[1:31:12] open underneath the Earth the Bible said
[1:31:15] his body was placed in the grave but his
[1:31:18] soul continued his work he he treaded
[1:31:22] through the wine press of the RO of God
[1:31:25] brother Brown said I can see him
[1:31:26] traveling in Dimensions he went into the
[1:31:29] realm of demons he said you are too
[1:31:31] small for me you don't have what I want
[1:31:35] step aside then he got to the of the
[1:31:38] Devil Himself and he says Satan give me
[1:31:41] the
[1:31:44] key why should I give you the key my
[1:31:48] price is up there I offer the priz it
[1:31:51] has been accepted even your agents on
[1:31:54] Earth erod are inclusive and the pilot
[1:31:58] inclusive they declared they find no
[1:32:01] fault in me so I am a worthy sacrifice
[1:32:04] no wonder the elders in Revelation 5
[1:32:07] said Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
[1:32:10] Glory Hallelujah Worthy is a lamb that
[1:32:14] was slain Glory Hallelujah so I meet the
[1:32:18] price I meet the qualification my price
[1:32:21] has been accepted you ain't got no right
[1:32:23] to hold the key brother Braham said I
[1:32:26] can see Satan resulting into sterile
[1:32:30] recrimination is a stal one because it
[1:32:33] doesn't matter he said when I killed
[1:32:35] Isaiah I thought I heard you when I
[1:32:38] killed Ezekiel I thank God those
[1:32:41] Brethren they lived so much until their
[1:32:44] life became the identity of Christ and
[1:32:46] Satan was
[1:32:49] confused hey that is for another day but
[1:32:51] take that home that you can live so well
[1:32:54] and Satan won't know the difference
[1:32:56] between you and
[1:32:57] Jesus that is what the message of the
[1:33:00] hour is to achieve in our lives amen he
[1:33:04] said when I killed this I thought I have
[1:33:06] you he said but now I have you Jesus
[1:33:09] said you will have you may have enough
[1:33:10] time later for this your weak testimony
[1:33:14] but right now what I need is the key and
[1:33:17] me the key why will he take the key
[1:33:20] because some people must be unlocked
[1:33:23] Porters must open Abraham is under lock
[1:33:27] Sarah is under lock all those great
[1:33:30] Saints are under lock and they must be
[1:33:32] released because they died in the hope
[1:33:35] of the promise of the coming
[1:33:40] Messiah and brother Brown said I can see
[1:33:43] him give him a terrible kick and before
[1:33:46] the devil could wake up from his kicking
[1:33:48] Slumber God took Christ took the key and
[1:33:52] went straight to the right places he
[1:33:55] first went to the region of the Lost The
[1:33:58] Fifth Dimension he knocked at their door
[1:34:01] and when they open to say you know what
[1:34:03] I was the one Noah preached because the
[1:34:06] Bible says since the long suffering of
[1:34:08] the days of Noah I was the I was the H
[1:34:11] that Noah preached which you rejected oh
[1:34:14] you have come we want you now he said it
[1:34:16] is too late Souls that are in prison
[1:34:19] now it is too late I just come here to
[1:34:23] witness to you you that Noah was right
[1:34:25] and you were wrong Ezekiel was right and
[1:34:29] you were wrong Isaiah was right but you
[1:34:32] were wrong Jeremiah was right but you
[1:34:34] are wrong Enoch was right but you are
[1:34:37] wrong and from there he moved to the
[1:34:39] sixth
[1:34:40] Dimension and he began to knock at the
[1:34:43] door and the door the pter has to open
[1:34:47] you know why he's qualified he's the
[1:34:50] great Shepherd and I can hear Abraham
[1:34:53] say yes who is knocking he said I am the
[1:34:56] one that when he spoke it was a familiar
[1:34:59] voice he said Sarah come come come do
[1:35:02] you remember that one that appeared to
[1:35:04] us in the plane of mamory that said I
[1:35:07] will visit you according to the time of
[1:35:10] life he right there at the
[1:35:13] door and how they came Hallelujah when
[1:35:18] he kned at Isaiah when Isaiah heard the
[1:35:21] voice he said I know he will come
[1:35:24] because I told my generation I told them
[1:35:28] that a virgin shall conceive unto us a
[1:35:30] son is a TI is born unto us a son is
[1:35:33] given he's right at the
[1:35:36] door Ezekiel saw him as the middle in
[1:35:38] the wheel in the middle of the way all
[1:35:41] of them wants to be having a good time
[1:35:43] Jesus said you know what you will have
[1:35:45] enough time because I have an
[1:35:47] appointment 72 hours must not expire
[1:35:51] before I get out so that my work is not
[1:35:53] broken he said come right along and they
[1:35:56] came on the head with him the porters
[1:35:59] opened all doors until tonight's they
[1:36:01] will open relative to this age oh my
[1:36:05] before I come to this age hold on hold
[1:36:07] on hold on when the port has open it
[1:36:09] brought all the saints because the Bible
[1:36:12] said when he said it is finished the
[1:36:14] graves no matter how tight they were
[1:36:18] sealed they became hoping Preparatory
[1:36:21] for what Resurrection because the pters
[1:36:24] must
[1:36:28] open and on Earth for about 30 to 40
[1:36:32] days he had a post-resurrection
[1:36:34] Ministry after which he decided to go up
[1:36:37] and the Bible said he ascended in his
[1:36:39] Rapture with thousand times thousands of
[1:36:42] the Saints and they got to the gate of
[1:36:44] glory and the Saints behind him began to
[1:36:46] sing lift your Gat ye po has
[1:36:50] open and they said who is open to the
[1:36:53] King of Kings said who is the king he
[1:36:56] said the Lord Mighty in
[1:36:59] battle oh he still the Lord Mighty in
[1:37:02] batt and the pters of Heaven also
[1:37:07] opened and in these last days we were
[1:37:11] loged in the house of
[1:37:15] hell and there was nobody who could open
[1:37:18] us it has to be somebody who brings to
[1:37:21] us the ministry of the shepherd
[1:37:25] reincarnated uhhuh because the ministry
[1:37:28] of the shepherd you see that is why he
[1:37:30] said I have other people I have other
[1:37:33] Sheep amen now these other sheep are to
[1:37:37] be brought in by the exact Ministry of
[1:37:40] Christ in Luke
[1:37:42] 17:30 he said his person will not be
[1:37:45] here but his ministry will be here so it
[1:37:49] is of necessity that a son of man must
[1:37:53] come to reveal the son of man that was
[1:37:58] why in these last days when we were
[1:38:00] locked in the house of Hell the only
[1:38:03] person we were calling onto was brother
[1:38:06] Braham did you remember that Vision do
[1:38:09] you remember that dream he said brother
[1:38:11] Brown help us help us help us help us
[1:38:16] and what do they want they want to be
[1:38:18] unlocked they want the gates to open
[1:38:21] they want the pters to open and brother
[1:38:24] Brown became qualified because he
[1:38:26] carried the voice of God in the ministry
[1:38:29] of Jesus Christ
[1:38:31] reincarnated underline that in your
[1:38:34] heart he wasn't a person of Christ but
[1:38:37] oh in the message Souls that are
[1:38:39] imprisoner he said if you call me the
[1:38:42] person of Christ you make me an
[1:38:45] antichrist but if you said the ministry
[1:38:48] exact Ministry that cried out has been
[1:38:51] reincarnated today he said that is what
[1:38:54] the Brethren believe I believe with
[1:38:57] them Hallelujah so he carried that
[1:39:01] Ministry to do what to bring in the
[1:39:04] other sheep who were outside the fold
[1:39:06] when he was preaching in John chapter 10
[1:39:09] and they were saying Help Us brother
[1:39:11] brah and that is was say only you can
[1:39:13] help us and by the voice of the grace
[1:39:17] she he said House of Hell House of Hell
[1:39:21] House of hell give way to the name of
[1:39:25] the Lord and the poters open again and
[1:39:29] the ships were coming out the ships were
[1:39:31] coming out that is why you are here
[1:39:33] tonight because you were represented in
[1:39:37] that
[1:39:38] Vision to him the portal open
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:48] [Applause]
[1:39:50] it Hallelujah
[1:39:55] he has a sheep for friend and he said
[1:39:58] when he puted forth his own sheep he go
[1:40:02] before them oh man it doesn't send them
[1:40:06] on an erand that he is not responsible
[1:40:09] for he goeth before them and the Sheep
[1:40:13] follow him we're coming to something now
[1:40:17] for they know his voice
[1:40:24] are you
[1:40:25] here the followership of this Shepherd
[1:40:29] is by his
[1:40:31] voice look let me tell you to follow the
[1:40:35] shepherd today you must know his
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:43] voice I'm talking to spiritual people to
[1:40:47] follow the shepherd
[1:40:50] today you will soon see who the real
[1:40:52] sheep are
[1:40:54] H to follow the shepherd
[1:40:57] today you must know his voice and Jesus
[1:41:02] was saying it
[1:41:03] confidently because he knew that the
[1:41:06] ship is programmed
[1:41:09] Hallelujah to listen to no other
[1:41:12] person the womb of their mind is sealed
[1:41:16] to any other thing than the voice of the
[1:41:20] shepherd
[1:41:24] hey hey
[1:41:27] hey you saw him you can hear him
[1:41:30] repeatedly saying it that this sheep
[1:41:34] know my
[1:41:35] voice and a
[1:41:38] stranger so the stranger also has his
[1:41:44] voice but they will
[1:41:46] never follow the voice of a stranger
[1:41:50] because there's an imbu spiritual
[1:41:52] mechanism
[1:41:54] Beyond five
[1:41:57] senses to decode every
[1:42:00] hero when the stranger came to St
[1:42:07] Martin when the stranger came to St
[1:42:10] Martin in the seven Church ages you know
[1:42:14] what happened because he's an impostor
[1:42:17] he dressed perfectly he used the Bible
[1:42:21] to dress himself so his appearance was
[1:42:25] very scriptural if you look at him you
[1:42:28] look at the Bible the
[1:42:33] same that is how deadly that is how
[1:42:37] dangerous this stranger can be the
[1:42:40] stranger we are talking about is not
[1:42:42] outside the
[1:42:45] message the the ones outside the message
[1:42:49] can't do
[1:42:50] much amen you can challenge them what do
[1:42:54] you know in the Bible but the stranger
[1:42:56] I'm talking about is the one that has
[1:42:59] step up the game he will carry the Bible
[1:43:02] with a spoken
[1:43:04] [Applause]
[1:43:07] word Satan is too deadly brother Braham
[1:43:11] said he studies you by your weapon he
[1:43:13] knows the way your mind runs and he
[1:43:16] attacks You by that
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:23] strangers in Malachi
[1:43:28] 4 that was why when he appeared to St
[1:43:32] Martin I'm repeating again its
[1:43:35] appearance from head to toe my brother
[1:43:39] very scriptural underline it in your
[1:43:44] mind so here is Martin looking at the
[1:43:47] Creator and looking at his bible and
[1:43:50] they seem to be the same so the power
[1:43:53] are not to be deceived is beyond your
[1:43:55] five
[1:43:56] senses there must be a programmed Divine
[1:44:00] mechanism that is why Christ knew what
[1:44:03] he has put in you that was why he said
[1:44:06] if it were possible he said the time
[1:44:08] will be so tough Matthew
[1:44:11] 24:24 that if it were possible these two
[1:44:14] spirits being so close the elect will be
[1:44:17] deceived but I thank God it is not
[1:44:21] possible it will not be possible
[1:44:24] never ever ever because you know why you
[1:44:28] know why Christ already had a
[1:44:31] Thanksgiving over you he said father I
[1:44:34] thank you for all you gave me I lose
[1:44:39] none he cannot withdraw his Thanksgiving
[1:44:42] he lost none means he lost
[1:44:46] none H Allelujah
[1:44:58] so all right so as M was looking at the
[1:45:02] scripture looking at him that guy was
[1:45:05] pleading worship me worship me that is
[1:45:08] the craving of the devil worship worship
[1:45:10] worship he was pressuring him worship me
[1:45:15] but something was checking M even though
[1:45:17] he looks but Waits does that wait upon
[1:45:22] the Lord
[1:45:24] as he was waiting as he was waiting the
[1:45:28] grace of God came down and what did the
[1:45:30] grace do he show to him from the same
[1:45:33] scripture in the message Christ is
[1:45:36] revealed in his own word brother Braham
[1:45:39] said no matter how true something looks
[1:45:42] it must go through three things there
[1:45:44] must be no
[1:45:45] mislocation
[1:45:47] misinterpretation and
[1:45:49] misrepresentation he said this guy you
[1:45:51] are looking at he has crossed two
[1:45:53] holders but there's a
[1:45:55] mislocation because the crown on his
[1:45:58] head the same Bible he read said that it
[1:46:01] is you it is you it is I it is you that
[1:46:06] will crown him King of Kings Lord of
[1:46:10] lords this one is already crowned ask
[1:46:14] him how he got his
[1:46:19] crown the word the word of God God will
[1:46:23] defeat the Devil anytime anywhere under
[1:46:29] any
[1:46:33] circumstance
[1:46:36] Hallelujah by the time M ask him how did
[1:46:40] you get your crown The Stranger knew he
[1:46:42] was exposed he ran
[1:46:47] away hallelujah
[1:46:50] hallelujah this is how deadly The
[1:46:52] Stranger will
[1:46:53] be but this
[1:46:55] sheep I'm repeating because the Good
[1:46:58] Shepherd says so he said they know my
[1:47:03] [Applause]
[1:47:06] voice so it is important for us to find
[1:47:11] out his
[1:47:12] voice when we are following the Voice
[1:47:16] automatically we are the Sheep of his
[1:47:19] Sheepfold Hallelujah
[1:47:22] let me give you a type so that you will
[1:47:25] begin to understand it I don't know much
[1:47:27] but I can explain by type all right in
[1:47:31] the first
[1:47:33] Exodus when the shepherd was ready to
[1:47:36] lead The Exodus people
[1:47:39] out he called them into a
[1:47:43] contract he said this road you are going
[1:47:46] I'm going to be the
[1:47:48] leader so he came down as the pillar of
[1:47:51] Fire EX CH
[1:47:54] 23 God walked the consciousness of those
[1:47:57] people he said behold I send my
[1:48:02] angel that angel was the pillar of
[1:48:06] fire I sent my angel before thee to lead
[1:48:11] you in the
[1:48:12] way he said Beware of
[1:48:15] him don't argue with
[1:48:18] [Applause]
[1:48:19] him for my name is in
[1:48:24] him whatever he says
[1:48:26] do no matter how strongly opinionated
[1:48:30] you
[1:48:31] are you must have no thought coming just
[1:48:35] accept what he says no matter how hard
[1:48:39] how illogical how unreasonable lean not
[1:48:42] to your own
[1:48:46] understanding but there's a problem
[1:48:48] there's a problem this pillow of fire is
[1:48:52] not visible
[1:48:57] and yet is to lead the journey so how
[1:48:59] can we follow a leader we are not
[1:49:02] seeing are you catching that are you
[1:49:05] catching that this leader we don't see
[1:49:08] him and we are not to and we are to
[1:49:10] follow him if we will enter into the
[1:49:12] promise are we not in
[1:49:14] problem God say you are not in problem I
[1:49:17] know what I'm doing then he brought a
[1:49:21] messenger they call called him
[1:49:23] Moses what was Moses to do to
[1:49:27] humanize the leadership of the pillar of
[1:49:31] fire because Moses by Design he was
[1:49:35] designed with the capacity to see the
[1:49:38] pillar of fire Paul the same William
[1:49:43] Braham the
[1:49:44] same Paul was second Exodus William Bram
[1:49:48] is Third Exodus these men were designed
[1:49:52] to see the pillar of fire that was why
[1:49:55] when people come to the prayer line the
[1:49:57] only thing they experience is feeling
[1:50:00] brother Braham said we say are you
[1:50:02] feeling very good and nice they will say
[1:50:05] yes he said you see that angel of the
[1:50:07] Lord that Pillar of Fire I talk about is
[1:50:10] just 2T away from you that is why you
[1:50:13] are feeling that way he is seeing him
[1:50:16] but the people feeling it were not
[1:50:18] seeing him so somebody's eyes must be
[1:50:21] programmed to see the pillar of
[1:50:26] fire in the first Exodus it was
[1:50:31] Moses so it follows that Moses will hear
[1:50:36] from the pillar of
[1:50:39] fire and whatever he hears he will
[1:50:43] declare to the
[1:50:45] people so it became the voice of God to
[1:50:49] the people my sheep hear mine
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:56] voice so the voice was Moses but the
[1:51:01] content of the voice was
[1:51:06] God you must not miss that you must not
[1:51:09] miss that the
[1:51:11] voice they were hearing was Moses but
[1:51:15] what Moses was saying wasn't Moses it
[1:51:19] was God
[1:51:23] if you take it as the words of Moses you
[1:51:26] will finish your journey in the
[1:51:29] wilderness if you want to go all the way
[1:51:32] through you must take the content of the
[1:51:36] voice as the word of God Paul warned his
[1:51:39] own people he said that which I receive
[1:51:42] from the Lord the same I deliver without
[1:51:46] addition or suppression in these last
[1:51:49] days will Abraham said I was not the one
[1:51:53] that appeared at Ohio River I was only
[1:51:56] the person that was
[1:51:58] near did he say so he said a man is word
[1:52:03] will fail you are not feeding on me but
[1:52:06] you are feeding on the unfailing body
[1:52:09] word of the son of
[1:52:17] man somebody said that in these last
[1:52:21] days somebody said I am God's voice to
[1:52:24] you did he say so he said the first time
[1:52:28] I said it under inspiration and I can
[1:52:30] see people resenting it he said let me
[1:52:32] say it again I am God's voice unto you
[1:52:38] he said when I was growing up because my
[1:52:41] parents were drunker than unbelievers
[1:52:43] many people have no use for me when they
[1:52:46] see me on one side of the street they
[1:52:48] will cross to the other side he said but
[1:52:50] today by Amazing Grace
[1:52:53] Hallelujah I will have to run away from
[1:52:55] my house from people who were willing to
[1:52:59] see me he said because God has given me
[1:53:01] the charge to direct the Bride of this
[1:53:04] day so God's bride director God's voice
[1:53:08] for today is the prophet of the
[1:53:11] hour so for you to be a true sheep to
[1:53:14] follow this Shepherd you must know that
[1:53:17] voice that voice is a person it's a
[1:53:20] messenger
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:36] do you know why this is important
[1:53:38] friends let me tell you why this is
[1:53:40] important you say I should tell you it
[1:53:43] is the voice that can keep you in the
[1:53:46] Rage of
[1:53:51] atonement you will see what it means
[1:53:54] now you see when they left Egypt let's
[1:53:57] start from there again do you know there
[1:53:59] are many
[1:54:01] roads that led
[1:54:03] to Canaan did you realize that spiritual
[1:54:07] people are responding they said that's
[1:54:09] right they know their
[1:54:13] Bible
[1:54:14] amen I have
[1:54:17] traveled from Israel to
[1:54:19] Egypt traveling by the borders of red SE
[1:54:22] SE and I never crossed the Red Sea and I
[1:54:24] entered
[1:54:26] Egypt the Bible said there is a shorter
[1:54:30] distance to Canaan which is the highway
[1:54:32] of the
[1:54:34] Philistines is it in your Bible like
[1:54:37] that when
[1:54:39] Joseph and his Brethren went to bury
[1:54:42] Jacob their father after he died in
[1:54:45] Egypt they didn't have to cross the Red
[1:54:49] Sea what does that tell you my brother
[1:54:52] my sister there may be many routes but
[1:54:56] that does not mean each route is an
[1:54:58] option for the believer your Shepherd
[1:55:03] selected the part you must
[1:55:08] stret my Bible told me that God chose to
[1:55:13] lead them by the way of the Red
[1:55:17] [Applause]
[1:55:18] Sea do you know as long as they follow
[1:55:23] God's Divine Direction by his voice they
[1:55:26] will be under the
[1:55:30] atonement hey before the journey started
[1:55:35] God dedicated that Journey with an
[1:55:37] atonement that is why brother Braham
[1:55:39] said the blood of the Passover lamp was
[1:55:42] applied at the lint and the door post
[1:55:46] the prophet said they were making the
[1:55:47] sign of the cross the cross has been
[1:55:50] with us right from the beginning
[1:55:53] because the Redemption plan was not an
[1:55:56] accidental plan it was a plan conceived
[1:55:59] in
[1:56:00] eternity and God has put his people
[1:56:03] under Shadow blood and the real blood
[1:56:06] through time and
[1:56:09] ages because it's got to be the blood
[1:56:11] cover when Abraham was to start his
[1:56:14] journey with him he brought him first
[1:56:17] under the atonement right you didn't
[1:56:19] catch that Genesis chter 15
[1:56:23] he told him when Abraham wanted a deal
[1:56:26] with God where we shall I know that you
[1:56:29] are going to keep your promise so that
[1:56:31] this walk between me and you can be
[1:56:34] seamless we know where we are going God
[1:56:37] said no problem kill your Bullock
[1:56:40] exactly divide it into two exactly but
[1:56:42] after you have done that had for me T do
[1:56:45] and pigeon brother brah said t do and
[1:56:48] pigeons represent atonement and healing
[1:56:52] you you know why God knew that along the
[1:56:55] journey it is Abraham that will not be
[1:56:58] able to keep his part God is faithful he
[1:57:01] will never fail but man will fail and
[1:57:05] God knew that but God wanted a situation
[1:57:09] that no matter the failure of man he
[1:57:11] will still keep his promise did you hear
[1:57:14] what I'm
[1:57:17] saying this is why brother Brown said
[1:57:21] the Covenant gave to Adam was
[1:57:24] conditional but when he came to Abraham
[1:57:28] unconditional he said it is not what you
[1:57:30] do it is what I have done if you can
[1:57:34] accept what I have done it ends the
[1:57:36] matter if you can stay under the
[1:57:39] atonement it ends the
[1:57:44] matter and to every child of God in our
[1:57:48] walk with him it is atonment that comes
[1:57:50] first before our work because God knows
[1:57:55] we will do things that will make him
[1:57:57] that will make it impossible for him to
[1:58:00] keep his promise but he is determined to
[1:58:04] keep his
[1:58:05] promise
[1:58:06] Hallelujah whether you fail or not and
[1:58:10] you can cut me anywhere he is determined
[1:58:14] to keep his
[1:58:18] promise is a Abraham put it it's all
[1:58:22] there for me you know why Abraham knew
[1:58:26] that God knew that Abraham will
[1:58:29] lie he knew that he will make a poor
[1:58:31] excuse of a husband he will deny his
[1:58:35] wife and instead of calling him wife he
[1:58:37] will call him sister he knew Abraham
[1:58:40] will backslide and go to Egypt he knew
[1:58:43] he would do those things but you
[1:58:46] see oh my by the
[1:58:50] atonment everything Adam will do Abraham
[1:58:53] will do it's already taken care
[1:58:59] of are you with me by the
[1:59:05] atonement that was why when his obituary
[1:59:08] was written later the Bible says Abraham
[1:59:12] St up nuts at the promise of God because
[1:59:16] of unbelief how many read it in their
[1:59:20] Bible but I can can show you from that
[1:59:23] same Bible where Abraham staggered in
[1:59:27] Genesis chapter
[1:59:28] 17 when God was talking about the
[1:59:31] promise son you say Sarah smiled within
[1:59:33] herself but Abraham did the worse one he
[1:59:36] laughed to the face of
[1:59:39] God it must have been God what are you
[1:59:42] talking what do you mean let is Man live
[1:59:45] before you and
[1:59:49] go that was enough to block the promise
[1:59:53] but God was
[1:59:55] determined when Sarah argued with God
[1:59:59] and told God I did not smile that was
[2:00:03] enough to block the promise but I told
[2:00:06] me
[2:00:14] stand in the second
[2:00:16] Exodus God knew what Peter will do do
[2:00:20] you realize he said Peter with all this
[2:00:24] your sh again you b s you did all this
[2:00:27] he said before the co cre you will deny
[2:00:30] me three times Peter said me me Peter
[2:00:33] The Rock maybe if you are talking of
[2:00:36] somebody like brother
[2:00:37] Thomas maybe that is possible but not
[2:00:40] somebody like me God said Jesus say okay
[2:00:44] we will see how it goes but said you
[2:00:46] know what I don't mind your shenan what
[2:00:49] I have done is I have prayed for you
[2:00:52] he offered him Advan
[2:00:58] atonement but do you know do you know he
[2:01:02] also knew that Judas will betrayed him
[2:01:05] and he never offered him
[2:01:07] anything why did he offer Peter why did
[2:01:10] he pray for Peter and he did not pray
[2:01:13] for Judas my sheep know
[2:01:18] my if you don't if you don't belong to
[2:01:21] to him he is not obligated to
[2:01:25] you thank God I belong to him I'm so
[2:01:29] glad I belong to Jesus I'm so glad I
[2:01:33] belong to
[2:01:46] Jesus when was the lamb slain brother
[2:01:49] Isaac when was the lamb SL
[2:01:52] SL when was the lamb slain before the
[2:01:55] foundation of the before the foundation
[2:01:57] of the w why did why did he have to slay
[2:01:59] the lamb in his mind
[2:02:04] before before you came to make it
[2:02:08] necessary for the lamb to die God
[2:02:11] knowing what you will do he offered you
[2:02:14] an advance atonement
[2:02:22] that was why that was why when they
[2:02:25] wanted to start that Exodus Journey he
[2:02:28] said give me the blood of the
[2:02:32] Passover and they offered it and they
[2:02:35] said you know what you do for me apply
[2:02:37] the blood on the lint and on the door
[2:02:39] post brother Braham said that was a sign
[2:02:42] of the cross even before Calvary so this
[2:02:46] Exodus people carried the cross with
[2:02:49] them oh
[2:02:56] and because they were carrying the
[2:02:58] atonement what will keep them enjoying
[2:03:01] the blessings of atonement is the voice
[2:03:04] that will keep them in
[2:03:09] lineah so minding the Shepherd by his
[2:03:12] voice is critical to your
[2:03:16] Survivor when he L them by way of the
[2:03:18] Red Sea amen by of the Red Sea means by
[2:03:22] way of the Red Sea and that's why when
[2:03:25] they got to Red Sea no more
[2:03:27] way it was a dead end but these were
[2:03:31] people hallelujah under
[2:03:34] atonement they didn't get there by
[2:03:37] themselves they were following the
[2:03:42] voice before you attack a man find out
[2:03:47] how you go to where he is brother brah
[2:03:50] said challenges of Life do not come only
[2:03:53] because we have we done
[2:03:56] wrong did you hear me our wrongs can
[2:03:59] bring us into problem but it is not
[2:04:02] every problem that is caused by a wrong
[2:04:05] you might be following God's
[2:04:07] leadership and yet find yourself at a
[2:04:10] dead end see in the front Pharaoh behind
[2:04:15] Hills and Valleys on either side
[2:04:18] following the pillar of Fire by his
[2:04:23] voice hallah whether you like it or not
[2:04:28] that is the range of atonement then that
[2:04:30] is why God took
[2:04:32] responsibility for their safety if you
[2:04:35] want God to take responsibility if you
[2:04:38] want atonement to Avail for you to meet
[2:04:41] your needs to save your soul to heal
[2:04:44] your body to change your situation you
[2:04:47] must follow the voice
[2:04:49] [Applause]
[2:04:55] you must follow the
[2:04:58] [Applause]
[2:05:05] voice hallu brother BR said of this
[2:05:10] age you know we have the Feast of the
[2:05:14] trumpet and brother Braham said six
[2:05:17] trumpets sounded under the six seal he
[2:05:21] said but the seventh one is to be sended
[2:05:23] by Moses and Elijah in order to call
[2:05:27] Israel after we go into the Rapture into
[2:05:31] the atonement he said but that is
[2:05:34] exactly what the seven seal did to
[2:05:36] [Applause]
[2:05:38] us he called us to the genuine
[2:05:42] atonement to the blood of the Lamb who
[2:05:45] was shed at Calvary it was the opening
[2:05:49] of the seals that brought the blessings
[2:05:52] of Calvary to you that was why the day
[2:05:55] brother Brown was preaching the bridge
[2:05:58] between the seven Church ages and the
[2:06:00] opening of the seals he said the lamb is
[2:06:03] about ready tonight to take the book and
[2:06:07] make Redemption
[2:06:09] claims because for 2,000 years he has
[2:06:13] been interceding for the ignorance of
[2:06:16] his people that is why Luther will make
[2:06:19] it despite his teaching that is why
[2:06:22] Wesley will make it despite his teaching
[2:06:25] and all those reformers will make it
[2:06:27] despite their teaching because the lamp
[2:06:30] was interceding for 2,000 years for
[2:06:33] their ignorance but the moment he got up
[2:06:36] ignorance was perfectly interceded for
[2:06:40] because the lamp opened the book in
[2:06:43] order to do what make Redemption
[2:06:46] claims to call your own name
[2:06:50] supernaturally he said the shepherd
[2:06:52] called them by their names you may not
[2:06:55] hear Zoe but you didn't hear Zoe but you
[2:06:58] are here tonight something called you
[2:07:01] something called you something called
[2:07:04] you something called you something
[2:07:06] called you you heard your name
[2:07:15] supernaturally what is he calling you to
[2:07:18] he's calling you to the genuine
[2:07:20] atonement we where you can be under the
[2:07:22] blood cover of Jesus Christ for your
[2:07:26] safety for your provision for your
[2:07:29] life's journey for your shielding
[2:07:32] against every attack you can only get
[2:07:36] that under the voice that open the
[2:07:40] seals no other
[2:07:43] messenger no other messenger open the
[2:07:46] seals they attempted but they failed can
[2:07:50] they take in said have you ever seen
[2:07:53] somebody who went into the Book of
[2:07:55] Revelation and come out alive but thank
[2:07:58] God we saw
[2:08:00] somebody William Brown entered he came
[2:08:03] out alive and he brought us inside
[2:08:07] because is the voice of God the voice of
[2:08:10] the shepherd to us in this
[2:08:12] [Applause]
[2:08:17] [Music]
[2:08:19] day if you want God to be personally
[2:08:22] obligated to you if you want the
[2:08:25] shepherd to meet your needs follow his
[2:08:29] voice you know this our
[2:08:32] GPS that you have and you put in your
[2:08:34] radio and your cars do you don't see the
[2:08:38] S the woman or the man okay let me use
[2:08:41] the man because some brothers will feel
[2:08:43] offended by that they said I can't allow
[2:08:46] a woman to be leading me so they will
[2:08:48] change the voice of the GPS from that of
[2:08:51] a woman to a man suit
[2:08:55] yourself anyone you want it is okay but
[2:09:00] you realize you don't see the fellow
[2:09:03] that's right you are only following the
[2:09:05] voice did you realize it and if you
[2:09:08] follow the voice
[2:09:10] diligently nine or eight out of 10 times
[2:09:14] they land you safely the margin of error
[2:09:17] is because it is human's
[2:09:19] achievement amen amen
[2:09:22] but in God's economy there's no margin
[2:09:25] of
[2:09:27] error so you may not see the shepherd
[2:09:31] but if you can follow his voice you will
[2:09:33] arrive safely just the
[2:09:37] same my sheep know my
[2:09:40] voice have you known his voice do you

[2:10:24] house of the Lord amen if we follow it
[2:10:27] Faithfully we have come under the
[2:10:29] atonement let me say this whether you
[2:10:31] pray or you do not pray I'm not
[2:10:34] supporting on prayer don't misunderstand
[2:10:36] me
[2:10:38] Hallelujah As Long as You Follow what he
[2:10:41] says you are
[2:10:43] automatically under the blood
[2:10:54] there are
[2:10:55] benefits in following the shepherd I
[2:10:58] will come to it let me tap it for you
[2:11:02] again going back to the Old Testament
[2:11:05] for you to see the importance of
[2:11:08] following what the voice of the shepherd
[2:11:10] says even when it doesn't look like it
[2:11:13] makes
[2:11:14] sense in the Bible God told Israel as
[2:11:19] they were journeying he said any time
[2:11:22] you get to a place where you want to
[2:11:25] relax before the next challenge before
[2:11:28] the next myone he said you must speach
[2:11:32] according to my
[2:11:34] instruction if you go in your Bible you
[2:11:37] will see how God emphasizing
[2:11:39] ping he said the Tabernacle you know
[2:11:42] they carry that Ark he said you must put
[2:11:45] it in the center there is a
[2:11:48] group then he divided Israel into three
[2:11:52] amen into three groups into three you
[2:11:56] know three three to make four groups is
[2:11:58] that right so three in each group and
[2:12:01] each group has a tribal Edge is that
[2:12:04] right and he said one must be in the
[2:12:07] north the other in the East the other in
[2:12:10] the west and the other in the South he
[2:12:14] said whenever you want to move if it is
[2:12:17] Southward you are going you must move
[2:12:19] according to that picture meaning the
[2:12:21] people of the South will lead the
[2:12:22] journey and all of us will be following
[2:12:25] like that if it is not it is the same
[2:12:27] thing it might not make sense to the
[2:12:30] people you understand but let me show
[2:12:32] you how it made sense when they came to
[2:12:34] Moab can you bring us the pictures I
[2:12:38] want to show you
[2:12:41] something
[2:12:43] Hallelujah you can see the picturing for
[2:12:45] those who can see you can see the one in
[2:12:48] the north you can see the one in the
[2:12:50] south you can see the one in the west
[2:12:53] you can see the one in the East is that
[2:12:56] right look at it for a while now the
[2:12:59] figures you were seeing there were the
[2:13:00] figures in the Bible these were the
[2:13:03] numbers after all some certain judgments
[2:13:07] and decimations at this time Koran and
[2:13:09] Abram many of them have been destroyed
[2:13:12] yes sir but they are ready now to enter
[2:13:14] Moab so God did numbering and he said
[2:13:18] the people that will be in the south
[2:13:21] will be led by reuben reuben Simeon and
[2:13:24] God they were 15
[2:13:27] 1,450 in the west you have ephra manasi
[2:13:29] and Benjamin
[2:13:32] 108,000 in the in the west I mean in the
[2:13:35] north you have Dan Asha and Nali
[2:13:38] 157,00 in the East you have Judah isak
[2:13:42] and Zebulon
[2:13:44] 186,000 and they said the Tabernacle of
[2:13:46] the congregation put it in the middle
[2:13:48] yes sir this was the way Israel moved
[2:13:51] throughout their Journey does this make
[2:13:54] sense it's not making sense yet it
[2:13:57] doesn't make sense okay let's let's move
[2:14:00] on give us the next
[2:14:03] one you will see where it makes sense
[2:14:05] now you will see what balam
[2:14:08] saw that made it impossible for him to
[2:14:12] curse the people of
[2:14:14] Israel because when balac was carrying
[2:14:17] him amen I like the way he did it he
[2:14:20] carried him to the
[2:14:21] Pinacle and he said if you view them
[2:14:24] from here you'll be able to see their
[2:14:26] back Parts their front parts and every
[2:14:30] part and it will make curing easy now
[2:14:33] these folks might think that they were
[2:14:35] just following the routine but God's
[2:14:38] wisdom is greater than mine God knew
[2:14:42] what he was
[2:14:43] doing no matter which direction they
[2:14:46] cause them from you read in your Bible
[2:14:49] Numbers 22 numbers 23 it became
[2:14:53] impossible for balam to cause these
[2:14:56] people let's see okay move on you are
[2:15:00] seeing the counting you can go to your
[2:15:02] Bible I'm waiting you up time go to your
[2:15:04] Bible and do the numbering it is there
[2:15:07] amen go on keep joining with us move on
[2:15:11] all right you see the number amen okay
[2:15:15] move
[2:15:16] on okay this is the NS now give us the
[2:15:19] last
[2:15:21] that's the
[2:15:23] Tabernacle show us the last let's see
[2:15:26] what it
[2:15:33] forms what are you seeing
[2:15:36] there what are you seeing you can see
[2:15:40] that the North and the South they are
[2:15:42] similar in amount 151
[2:15:46] 157 then the West Was 108 then the East
[2:15:50] was the Plenty
[2:15:51] 186 the longer length of the Cross this
[2:15:55] was what balam saw just by Israel
[2:15:58] following
[2:15:59] instruction take your position like this
[2:16:02] so if God tells you as a husband this is
[2:16:05] your position if he tells you a wife
[2:16:07] this is your position if he tells you
[2:16:09] children this is your position you don't
[2:16:11] know the structure you are forming don't
[2:16:14] argue it just accept it now when balam
[2:16:18] saw this
[2:16:22] give us Numbers chapter 22 or chapter
[2:16:25] 23 this was what bam saw give us the
[2:16:29] Book of
[2:16:32] Numbers following the shepherd the voice
[2:16:35] of the shepherd is important Numbers
[2:16:37] Chapter
[2:16:39] 23
[2:16:41] okay is that verse one give us
[2:16:44] 24 we'll come back to this
[2:16:49] 23 is that verse
[2:16:51] one give no no no I mean Numbers chapter
[2:16:56] 24 I want whichever is the chapter I
[2:16:58] want you to start from verse one is that
[2:17:01] 24 and when balam saw that he pleased
[2:17:04] the lord to bless Israel he went not as
[2:17:08] at other times you will see what said
[2:17:10] before this now to seek for enchantment
[2:17:14] uhhuh go
[2:17:16] on but he set his face towards the
[2:17:19] Wilderness and and balam lifted up his
[2:17:22] eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his
[2:17:25] tent according to their
[2:17:28] what so they pached according to their
[2:17:32] grouping just as the Lord said and the
[2:17:36] spirit of God Came Upon him
[2:17:39] uhhuh and he took up his Parable and
[2:17:42] said balam the son of be had said and
[2:17:45] the man whose eyes are open had said
[2:17:48] uhhuh he had said which had the words of
[2:17:50] of God which saw the vision of the
[2:17:53] almighty falling into a trance but
[2:17:55] having his eyes open hallelujah how
[2:17:58] goodly are thy tense oh Jacob and thy
[2:18:02] Tabernacles oh Israel as the valleys are
[2:18:06] there spread forth as Gardens by the
[2:18:09] Riverside as the Trees of line allows
[2:18:13] which the Lord had planted Hallelujah
[2:18:15] and as seear trees beside the waters
[2:18:18] uh-huh he shall pour the water out of
[2:18:20] his b ET and his seed shall be in many
[2:18:23] Waters and his King shall be higher than
[2:18:25] aak and his kingdom shall be exalted

[2:27:12] characters in The Bible to reflect one
[2:27:15] nature of himself or the other in terms
[2:27:17] of shepherd He used David and that was
[2:27:20] why abata became a blessed person when
[2:27:23] Saul became mad and he was killing all
[2:27:25] the priests the only place abata could
[2:27:27] run to was to David and David told him

[2:36:46] Exodus notice the king I thank God what
[2:36:49] I'm reading

[2:36:55] that didn't know Joseph I want you to
[2:36:56] get something
[2:36:58] here what was his first king to destroy
[2:37:01] the power of Israel was with their
[2:37:04] children that's correct
[2:37:07] amen Satan let me tell you Church go
[2:37:11] ahead and this is for my young
[2:37:14] colleagues relative to the gospel I'm

[2:37:31] message of Joshua and Cale read your
[2:37:34] Bible amen when the when the 10 Elders
[2:37:38] came to pre this is just for you now
[2:37:40] when the 10 Elders came to preach the
[2:37:43] message of I cannot make it that was the
[2:37:46] topic of that
[2:37:48] message do you agree with me they preach
[2:37:51] it with such a FY
[2:37:53] anointing until they converted the
[2:37:56] entire church in one
[2:38:00] sermon it's in your Bible numbers 13
[2:38:03] numbers
[2:38:06] 13 all the hard dos who think they
[2:38:10] understood and they have some experience
[2:38:13] and knowledge they said that makes
[2:38:16] sense we mustn't gamble with our lives
[2:38:20] too much
[2:38:21] RK it's too much risk but you know what
[2:38:25] the Bible told me go ahead brother it's
[2:38:27] 20 below they were not impressed with
[2:38:29] that

[2:38:35] it this is why I'm 20
[2:38:39] below
[2:38:41] Hallelujah but when Joshua and Caleb got
[2:38:43] on their own topic is we are more than
[2:38:46] able

[2:41:12] confront Goliath Gentile Warriors are
[2:41:15] you
[2:41:15] here when David killed one golad all his
[2:41:20] Warriors who are with him they said I
[2:41:22] must celebrate my own
[2:41:24] giant read your Bible golad asked Four
[2:41:27] Brothers each of David's Warrior kill
[2:41:31] them one by one even the one with
[2:41:33] lionlike face Hallelujah you will
[2:41:36] celebrate your own giant you will kill
[2:41:39] them you will eat them you will chew
[2:41:42] them you will swallow them you will
[2:41:45] digest them and nothing will happen it
[2:41:48] is the the blessing of Gentile Warriors
[2:41:51] to kill
[2:41:54] Giants
[2:41:57] Hallelujah so the devil knew
[2:42:00] this that is why he wanted to destroy
[2:42:03] the children Hallelujah see you can see
[2:42:06] why the pleasure is so much on our
[2:42:09] children the prophet said before the
[2:42:11] things start he likes to kill it in
[2:42:15] infancy just as we must kill sin in his
[2:42:18] infancy are you seeing it the prophet
[2:42:21] said the wisdom of God is not in how
[2:42:23] close you get to sin without committing
[2:42:26] sin but how fast you sh its
[2:42:29] appearance that is
[2:42:32] wisdom so Satan also understood the
[2:42:35] principle that was why it came through
[2:42:37] Pharaoh Moses you guys want to go and
[2:42:39] worship right who are the people that we
[2:42:42] go what is his business we didn't say I
[2:42:45] and my wife go want to go and worship I
[2:42:48] said me and myus
[2:42:50] we he said okay you adults can go leave
[2:42:53] the
[2:42:54] children and at another time he went on
[2:42:57] rapage killing the children his desire
[2:42:59] was to truncate the
[2:43:02] Revival before it starts this is a
[2:43:05] pressure that is coming upon young
[2:43:08] people but let me give you a blessing
[2:43:11] you know there's a quotation that says
[2:43:13] that they have more to deal with in
[2:43:16] their day than you Papas and Mama have
[2:43:19] more to deal with it's a quote but don't
[2:43:22] sympathize wrongly with that
[2:43:25] quotation and take it as a
[2:43:28] license to be succumbing to the devil
[2:43:31] that was not what the prophet is saying
[2:43:33] the prophet is only waking you to the
[2:43:36] consciousness of the battle that
[2:43:37] surrounds you but let me give you this
[2:43:40] blessing while we CAU that which is true
[2:43:43] we must also tell the children that you
[2:43:46] have much more Grace today
[2:43:49] than your parents heart because where
[2:43:52] sin abounds Grace much more when the
[2:43:57] enemy comes like a flood the spirit of
[2:44:00] the Lord will raise his in the days of
[2:44:03] these old people spoken word books was
[2:44:07] scar we have our own Liberian nationally
[2:44:10] here amen you get you get it in Bat I
[2:44:15] remember when I was growing and I'm
[2:44:17] still under under 20
[2:44:20] when I was growing we have people who
[2:44:23] will borrow us books and they will make
[2:44:25] us write our name and the day we are
[2:44:28] going to return it two three days and
[2:44:31] the brother looks like a champion he
[2:44:34] counting this for you and he reminding
[2:44:36] you you need to be honest as a Christian
[2:44:38] brother so what we try to do because we
[2:44:41] don't have it we have to quickly read
[2:44:44] take extra I have my friends who will
[2:44:47] drop the entire book because they can't
[2:44:50] read it fast they want to settle down
[2:44:52] and digest it those were the days we
[2:44:54] lived in and by the grace of God the
[2:44:57] little we had kept us it kept us above
[2:45:01] Temptation it kept us above immorality
[2:45:04] it kept us above sinful habit even
[2:45:07] sometimes one page is just
[2:45:08] enough it will do a lot because this
[2:45:12] voice of the shephers is so potent it's
[2:45:15] so powerful to change lives but today my
[2:45:19] brother today my sister you have it all
[2:45:22] around you just in your small phone the
[2:45:25] entire message of the hour is in there
[2:45:28] Grace much more abound what we don't
[2:45:31] have you have so you have a greater
[2:45:33] weapon than we had at that time
[2:45:36] Hallelujah may God help you to use your
[2:45:38] weapon to fight this battle of
[2:45:46] Life Hallelujah he tried to destroy
[2:45:49] their children now listen close the same
[2:45:52] devil in different form of a
[2:45:54] kingship tried to destroy God's only son
[2:45:59] get rid of the children first before
[2:46:01] they get his touch that was why when God
[2:46:04] told them to get to Canaan he said
[2:46:06] utterly destroy
[2:46:07] everything brother Brown said I can see
[2:46:10] an Hebrew mother saying I'm a mother I
[2:46:12] can't kill this little baby he doesn't
[2:46:14] even have teach and Joshua will say hand
[2:46:16] him here if you can't deal with him we
[2:46:18] will deal with with it he said you know
[2:46:20] why when that little child grow up he
[2:46:23] going to behave like his
[2:46:25] daddy the people they refuse to wipe out
[2:46:28] go and read your Bible they said we
[2:46:30] shall make them Fetchers of water
[2:46:31] shiners of our shoe those people
[2:46:33] eventually became their teachers to
[2:46:36] teach them corruption and they are
[2:46:38] priests to teach them idolatry the
[2:46:40] wisdom of God is greater than the
[2:46:43] intellect of
[2:46:44] man no matter how hard it seems whatever
[2:46:47] God says do do
[2:46:49] [Applause]
[2:46:52] Hallelujah and he said the devil is
[2:46:54] really
[2:46:56] smart shrew bird he knows how to eat the
[2:47:00] thing before it gets started he knows it
[2:47:04] and the only thing you can ever do now
[2:47:07] we have talked about the shepherd's
[2:47:08] business he is your own business as the
[2:47:11] Sheep the only thing you can ever do to
[2:47:14] beat him is rely on Christen and humble
[2:47:18] yourself and let him lead you you will
[2:47:22] never do it any other way your
[2:47:25] intellectual Powers will never do it
[2:47:27] you've got to believe it just rely on
[2:47:30] him he is the shepherd now listen it
[2:47:35] ain't the Sheep's business to Keep the
[2:47:37] Wolves
[2:47:38] Away it is the shepherd's
[2:47:42] [Applause]
[2:47:47] business you know why
[2:47:49] sheep is usually attractive to
[2:47:53] wolves you didn't get that Foles and
[2:47:57] wolves they like
[2:47:58] sheep that is why those Wayward boys
[2:48:01] they prefer a girl of the
[2:48:03] church you are attractive to
[2:48:06] wolves listen to me when they have
[2:48:09] finished their life brother Brown said
[2:48:11] out there it is dog each dog you
[2:48:15] understand they knew the life of these
[2:48:16] girls they are finished they know they
[2:48:19] are not wife
[2:48:20] material so when they are looking for a
[2:48:23] wife they want a decent church girl who
[2:48:27] will not cheat on them who will be a
[2:48:30] mother who will not live his life on
[2:48:33] social media to the detriment of our
[2:48:37] family all those guys in the world they
[2:48:39] know things that are good know so you
[2:48:42] will always be attractive to
[2:48:44] wolves but you follow the voice of the
[2:48:48] shepherd
[2:48:49] under no circumstance the shepherd said
[2:48:52] must you as a Believer marry an
[2:48:56] unbeliever don't begin to worship the
[2:48:59] admiration there's no compliment they
[2:49:01] want to give you that your parents have
[2:49:04] not giving you if they tell you you are
[2:49:07] such a beautiful girl tell them your
[2:49:09] Daddy has told you
[2:49:12] that say another thing
[2:49:20] MH don't sit still for that because the
[2:49:24] chemistry of a woman is designed to
[2:49:27] respond to what she hears the chemistry
[2:49:30] of a man is designed to respond to what
[2:49:32] he
[2:49:34] sees you must be careful sheeps are
[2:49:38] usually attractive to
[2:49:45] wolves the same thing to Brothers if it
[2:49:49] sounds unpopular I can't say forgive me
[2:49:51] because I'm telling you the truth
[2:49:53] swallow it for your
[2:49:55] good
[2:49:57] amen he said it ends the Sheep's
[2:50:00] business to keep the wolf away it's the
[2:50:03] shepherd's
[2:50:05] business but the Sheep must stay with
[2:50:09] the
[2:50:10] Shepherd in order to stay safe that's my
[2:50:15] safety zone it's in Christ and Christ is
[2:50:19] the word and the word comes from the
[2:50:22] voice of the
[2:50:23] shepherd you stay by that voice you will
[2:50:27] stay safe whatever comes whatever go the
[2:50:31] Lord will defend you the Lord will fight
[2:50:35] your batt it wasn't modi's
[2:50:38] problem I'll give two more slingshots
[2:50:41] and we're going to close it wasn't
[2:50:43] modi's problem to take care of the plot
[2:50:46] of Ammon
[2:50:48] did you realize that that was a wolf
[2:50:51] coming for the life of a Sheep amen and
[2:50:55] if you look at amen very well he
[2:50:57] typified Satan
[2:50:59] 100% his problem against modai was
[2:51:03] simply on
[2:51:04] worship you are still going to have that
[2:51:07] problem friends because the Antichrist
[2:51:09] will demand it Revelation 13 said so he
[2:51:13] said all the people of the earth will
[2:51:15] worship him except those whose names are
[2:51:18] in the
[2:51:20] Lambs have I shown you your name in the
[2:51:22] Lamb's Book of Life you are the one that
[2:51:24] have recognized the voice among all the
[2:51:27] people of the earth and you are
[2:51:29] following the voice you have come under
[2:51:31] the blood of the atonement all your
[2:51:33] needs will be
[2:51:35] [Applause]
[2:51:39] Mex are you with me
[2:51:43] Brethren Amon was getting worship from
[2:51:47] everybody except
[2:51:49] mod all the people of the earth will
[2:51:51] worship him except those whose names so
[2:51:55] why should he be bothered when he
[2:51:56] already has worship everywhere because
[2:51:59] yours is the
[2:52:04] premium until he get it from you he w't
[2:52:08] be satisfied unfortunately he will die
[2:52:12] unsatisfied because he won't get it from
[2:52:15] you that's what the Bible say according
[2:52:18] to the scripture it's
[2:52:20] impossible so he plotted you know you
[2:52:23] can imagine somebody came mody a man
[2:52:26] came and said God has blessed me with
[2:52:28] everything but I have one
[2:52:31] problem and his only problem is the
[2:52:34] problem of an undocumented
[2:52:39] immigrant will know about that because
[2:52:43] in their country I'm an American you
[2:52:45] undocumented immigrant Hallelujah
[2:52:51] modai was a captive he's got no record
[2:52:56] that was why he couldn't get a decent
[2:52:57] job no social
[2:52:59] security he was doing Gat Man daily
[2:53:03] wage how can how can ordinary modai
[2:53:07] became a problem of a
[2:53:10] prince did you catch that but it became
[2:53:13] his problem anyhow and his friends told
[2:53:16] him if that's the only problem you have
[2:53:18] in life life eliminate it so you can
[2:53:21] enjoy the moment they mention Modi in
[2:53:25] their Gathering the Bible said they
[2:53:28] shall surely
[2:53:31] gather God became
[2:53:35] interested while Modi was sleeping at
[2:53:38] home God wasn't sleeping the keeper of
[2:53:42] Israel neither sleep
[2:53:45] [Music]
[2:53:47] nor you you are people of Interest
[2:53:50] wherever your name is mentioned Jesus
[2:53:53] must appear to say what is going on so
[2:53:57] sleep easy and sleep well you ain't got
[2:54:02] no problem the shepherd is at work I'm
[2:54:06] telling
[2:54:08] you save yourself worry save yourself
[2:54:13] Panic you've got a real Goda you can't
[2:54:17] be frustrated
[2:54:18] [Applause]
[2:54:20] they plotted against
[2:54:22] Moda they plan to see the king tomorrow
[2:54:25] God finished the business
[2:54:27] tonight Hallelujah he never is late he
[2:54:31] never is gone count on his
[2:54:35] presence do you know how the story
[2:54:38] ended the king couldn't sleep and God
[2:54:41] said I didn't keep you awake to be
[2:54:44] thinking go pick the book of remembrance
[2:54:46] keep doing all you can for God
[2:54:49] there'll be one day of
[2:54:50] remembrance and the only chapter God
[2:54:53] made the king to read was Mod's good
[2:54:55] work and he has what has been done to
[2:54:57] him they say he's an undocumented
[2:55:00] immigrant he's got no connection nobody
[2:55:03] to carry his
[2:55:05] fire but the Lord who can carry all
[2:55:09] fires you need something somewhere the
[2:55:13] Lord will carry your fire is your
[2:55:15] Advocate is your intercessor he will do
[2:55:19] it for you he's your
[2:55:23] Shepherd and while they finish what they
[2:55:26] were doing the king and his people the
[2:55:29] day broke and him man came Co who is in
[2:55:32] the court general Prince amen he said
[2:55:35] welcome do you know God never allowed
[2:55:38] Amen to declare his
[2:55:39] mission that mission to kill a modai
[2:55:43] died with
[2:55:44] him the king said what shall be done to
[2:55:47] the men whom the king the lights to Hon
[2:55:50] he went greedy who else will the king

[2:56:07] are you seeing Lucifer that became Satan
[2:56:10] come on through types and shadows God
[2:56:12] has told the story of
[2:56:14] redemption he said and let it be add
[2:56:17] done to that man and let the most noble
[2:56:19] Prince do an escort Rider before
[2:56:23] him in the presidential Convoy the king
[2:56:27] looked at him is a good talk but this is
[2:56:31] powerful you know this is powerful the
[2:56:34] only thing a man didn't ask for was the
[2:56:36] king's
[2:56:39] Queen he asked for
[2:56:42] everything then the king said no problem
[2:56:46] what you said is really demanding but
[2:56:47] it's going to be now since you are the
[2:56:49] one who had the idea no better person to
[2:56:52] execute
[2:56:53] it than you so as I'm standing here by

[2:57:35] modai is of the seed of
[2:57:37] Israel whom you have Begin to Fall
