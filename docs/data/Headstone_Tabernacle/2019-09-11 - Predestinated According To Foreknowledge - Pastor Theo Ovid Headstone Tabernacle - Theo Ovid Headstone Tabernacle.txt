changing the you know [Music] selection here tonight we want to go into the Scriptures Romans 8:28 231 first Thessalonians for one verse verse seven and first Peter chapter 1 verse 13 to 23 so we read Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them what he called countries purpose for me did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren over whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified anomie justified them he also glorified what shall we then cease these things they've got before us who can be against us we live from 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 7 for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness on our last scripture from 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 13 it reads thus we have forked up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the Greece that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance and that not fashion illness do not conform yourselves to evil desires that govern you in your former ignorance when you did not know the requirements of the gospel verse 15 but as he which had called you is holy so be holy in all manner of converts and that would conversation is all manner of conduct and manner of living as a mean of conversation of poor but if with 17 but if he call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work pass the time here of your surgeon in here in fear and the amplifying have that if you call upon him your father who judges each one impartially according to what he does then you should conduct yourself with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary residence on earth whether long or short for as much was 18 as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by the tradition of your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last thanks to you by who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and give Him glory that your faith and hope might be in God there we go seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth to the spirit under unthink of the Brethren see that you love one another with pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever may God bless his word you may be seated or praise the name of the Lord I have a context scripture from Ephesians 1 and you know it blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ so blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Odin as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace where it he admit as accepted and beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace God would is wonderful God would is true could we see amen say love him tonight our title predestinated according to foreknowledge predestinated according to foreknowledge again I want you to leave the church tonight get away from yourself your past your feelings your fears and your own thinking and just see if you could just receive what is being spoken tonight because this have to lodge in your soul in your mind in your spirit also this Sunday was really powerful amen what you look what do you see oh praise it all depends upon what you're looking for but the Prophet said predestination looks back to foreknowledge I mean lection looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny don't forget that election looks back there I was a cockapoo I was born in sin shaped iniquity how many were speaking lies born among sinners father and mother whole family sinners I was a cockapoo all of a sudden I become a weak green how did it happen what was it election God before the foundation of the world elected that the cocklebur was to become a grain of wheat no I know I'm a grain of wheat because I am saved how do I do it look back and see what he predestinated it a long time ago by foreknowledge is seen I would love him so he made appropriation to his own son and chew him I might become a macaque able to agree no BT where am I now I am saved I am walking in the grace of God what does predestination look to destiny where will he take me to where am I going there you are Oh hallelujah according as he has chosen us in him before the function in the world so what I feel like picking people no God is not no picking people so you may as well get out your flesh and accept the reality that if you are chosen you would before the foundation of the world it has nothing to interferes it has nothing to with your paths and I've nothing to with your feelings it has nothing to do with your emotions it have everything to do with what God has said Oh blessed be the name of the Lord having predestinated the US and adoption listen of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will what did he do by foreknowledge he foresaw us knowing that he was a savior there was no ins as he was Elohim and so forth and when he started by foreknowledge he looked on he saw everyone that would accept it and by doing so to save that the only way I can do it will be come down myself and we made flesh take the set of man upon him and dive him that I might be the one that is worshipped so at the end of the day we have to come back to that same worship because I said what make him God you can sit in your unbelief you're not bullshitting you can't step in y'all have a pity party you not worship Him you have the second your sickness you not worship Him you worship and regardless because we know why we worship we know what we worship we know who we worship whoa glory that God is not right he came down on take upon himself why did he did that he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved so in his foreknowledge he saw people wanted to be saved and the only reason for them to be safe is to come down to make appropriation for their sins and their failures and that's why he could say openly and Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God that they already called according to his purpose because they play me we can see it confidently because they because of what the devil throw on you all things will put together for your good never do nothing about that that's the world that's the structure we can change that

the Word of God no people staying on Falken excuses if people come to service to me Wednesday night they're supposed to hopefully service when a man confesses his sins and get right with God and God dropped the sin of his confession into the blood and forgive that sin and replaces and that man who recently split at rabida his one spirit making him a son of God how much more or the creative power

focus before we snap it and when we get the real to picture that's what we wanted to focus our lives in the Jesus Christ and Christ and you become the same person you are son adopted to God by the blood of Jesus Christ the church would be moving on without friction we don't could without ham without don't know scruples without friction if you'll be moving in the power of the word of God manifest in every divine blessing that God promised it not trying to explain this mystery and explain that mystery without manifest and every divine blessing that God promised on it [Applause] [Music] and that prophet finished free she could see you know what I'm waiting on and then he said I think every spirit and I might come true and maybe devil know what happened after that chorus we must do our eyes and see him and see him only not some Bishop so why I should recognize some bishop not some great man or something we can take patent by but we looked at Jesus Christ not some organisation not some Pope or Archbishop of Canterbury or the divine man not pre : to it we must look at Jesus Christ he's do with could you take some more of course they come to take some more hallelujah that's what I come here for not to sleep on advanced night but to get something to energize your soul now listen recloser this remark but a man of faith no don't forget this now faith is designed to see what God wills and wants there is no knowledge can do that so that is why a man of faith is so inspired because he's not going with knowledge sense people know what is to be but they don't have the faith in what is to be the children of Israel they're not knowledge sense Michael laughs was concerned they were seeing knowledge from who is big to face Goliath who has muscles who long in battle who qualified that was knowledge information by sight but David wasn't in that at all as he heard Sunday David even studied him and sighs he just parmesan circumstance he's always that uncircumcised philistine define the army David never saw his eyes he saw the fact he wasn't covenanted to be in that land he any wrong place he on my land you're my territory because I am tolerant okay the Lord I show and when you begin to see that you are covenant it by this blood of Jesus you are being purchased by the blood of Jesus then that give you the vine right the plaster Devils the same noses enough [Applause] [Music] [Applause] fit is designed to see what God wills Oh Harlan there was no knowledge can do that it alone is designed and gifted a human race to find out what the will of God is and you take your fear that you cut and it don't focus with the world leave it alone they've got the wrong fate so your fate and supposed to come back with the feelin look at Abraham go tell Abram off up Isaac on a mountain I will show you and when Jordan tell him when he reached was at this one I'm Abram snip off of his camel or whatever I said I and the lad we go up and and the lad we're coming back down you know we're talking that knowledge talking in that is pure faith talking then they climb up the mountains mantener it's not flat plan is mountain in its high high high going up then Isaac Isaac and no fool as I said I D I see would I see fire but where is the sacrifice studying an efficient go and watch whatever up God will provide for himself [Music] all that is vision or no knowledge you know his understanding is Isaac to follow he teii exact on thank god he's a condo obedience know these modern sure answer but sit tight boy you see he's full you see these soles of the feet headin on the mountain that is one sacrifice escaping like that Skippy I said exactly game tied and Abram come up with knife no Abram a welcome another Lord God final prayer before no that's how we want to do final prayer Lord if it's your will on your up the mountain go talking to you you know it's God's will but you see you don't want to do it you don't want to come into obedience you see people sitting on here in knowledge information revelation mysteries but you have to come in obedience and purify your soul in obeying the truth because when you obey what God tell you you see the blessings walking in obedience to what God tell you even though it looks simple when everyone's come down with a knife you know called twice and round tire Garrity if he didn't do that you concede around them God don't have one already done can't move no you can sit down mom Missy is our I'm up there looking for RAM RAM so you're looking to offer exactly me looking around on your spine old mountain are

were three questions in one here first one is it true that every Jew born since Christ came into the world is to be saved answer no nothing will be saved only those whose names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the phone isn't world Jew or Gentile that is all the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is why this
