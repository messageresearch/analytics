amen may the lord richie bless you amen praise god amen i do appreciate the opportunity from precious brother solomon from live tabernacle ghana to bring greetings to your virtual convention inspiration behold the bridegroom comment lamp trimming time boro branham 58 years ago said many of you people about my age when we use to use the coal oil lamp so it is safe to assume that many of the under 50s will be challenged even to have a clear understanding of lamb trimming today's people are acquainted with the flick of a switch dust dawn motion sensors and many other gadgets the scripture in matthew 25 verse 6 tells us at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom comment go e out to meet him amen god's prophet is a message wrapped here paragraph 141 tells us the first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven there's a shout what is it is a message to get the people together a message come forward first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamp what watch was that the seventh not this week's the servant behold the bridegroom comet rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found that they didn't even have oil in the lab but it's lamp trimming time behold the bridegroom comet and god's prophet is telling us that's what this shout is all about the shout a message to get the people together a message come forth first lamp train a look at the lamp the design we on this side of the wall is acquainted with there is a wick and a wick is made of a special material there is a wick and this wick has the ability to pull the oil there is you can see a jar and in that jar is where the kerosene or the oil will be that's the base of it so the wick literally draws up the oil and then the wick is lighted god's prophet called that week a picture of the true believer the believer is a real wick of god and in this week fire is on one end and the other end has oil hallelujah fire on one end the other end drops in oil and that's what make the fire and god's prophet identified us amen that's a picture of the real elected that's the picture tonight of a virgin with oil in the lab church friends those who are not acquainted with the lamp fire burning out of oil makes carbon so carbon is formed on the top of the wick as fire burns it makes carbon and carbon interferes with the light so so long you have a lamp there's something you need to pay attention to amen many of us as children would have been acquainted that uh you have to clean the shed that's only one part of it but the very wick it is regular use has received carbon and that carbon interferes with your light what happens after a while your wick ends up in a bad shape amen you wick start burning very low your wick will literally block your shield amen so it means one of the things you got to do is to get the carbon off it is a part it's something like i die daily in as much as you serving the lord you do things things happen to you amen yo your weak cannot get cloudy you will kind of get shady so the same way amen the children of yesteryear or the families of yesteryear has to trim the week you got to be doing something you got to be doing something you got to get it trimmed off so it was a lamp like this one of the many variations people would have been acquainted with not a lantern this is more a lamp stationary and it's a lamp like this that granted inspiration to some writers that tell us trim your feeble lamp my brother amen amen those the lamp gives inspiration to a songwriter who tell us be filled with the spirit you're lamp trimmed and clear blessed be the name of the lord blessed be his holy name so songs were inspired by the land it means as a believer the lamp in daily use you recognize you have to attend to it and as a believer you can't go on on what you did you cannot go on on your past you can't go on on your history you cannot go on what you did you have to trim your lamp hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord darren there's a need tonight or whatever part of the day we are in your part of the world there is the need to die daily there is the need tonight that you should get rid of carbon you got to get so long you are lighting you're going to have problems you know amen so long evening it's normal use of daily use and you have to realize in your normal life you have to deal with you amen you're not doing wrong the lab's not doing wrong but in use in news the lamp needs attention oh glory to god god's prophet tells us that god raised up some preachers god raised up some preachers preachers that will go to trimming lamp larry so the purpose of the preacher is preacher you've got to go preacher go to trimming lamb they may deal with these lamps these lambs need to be dealt with and preachers need to go trimming lamp it's a time of lamp trimming it's a time of lamb dreaming amen trim your lamp it means get yourself ready that is what shrimp your love means tribe your lobbies get yourself ready

believers in tamil we want to thank you brother solomon to be invited to participate in this great move of god in the last day with this tremendous inspiration behold the bridegoon comet lamp trimming time to my fellow ministers i say god bless you to the believers that would view this convention god bless you as we wait on the coming of the lord so this morning we want to go straight into the scripture we have one scripture uh from revelation 22 verse 12. revelation 22 verse 12 and it says behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be let us bow heads heavenly father we thank you for your presence we thank you for this ghana convention lord that you put upon buddhism on heart lord and we thank you in this time of pandemic in this time when people are in their homes and different challenges lord that we could still gather virtually lord to speak your word and to edify and strengthen and encourage your people father may take me out of the way this morning i may bring a word of encouragement a word of direction a word from you father may we hear from you this morning and may you be magnified and be glorified in our midst in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise god we're so good to be here one more time praise god to be in his presence so this morning i have a title behold i come quickly and my reward is with me and i have an inspiration be ready and stay ready oh praise the name be ready and stay ready now the scripture we read this morning uh from revelation 20 to 12 and the amplified it says behold i am coming soon and i will bring my wages and rewards with me to repay and render to each one just what his own actions and his own work merit oh praise the name of the lord behold i come quickly and my reward is with me and we know the vision the the the word that came to the prophet because that was chosen the narrow part there was uh the hardaway the walked of your own chosen doors picked the precise decision it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee oh praise god now i wonder when i die what then i happen to think now heaven is not portioned off the different portions to us of dear heaven is the kingdom of heaven within us that one waits for what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine so a lot of things are dependent upon decisions decisions are fruits of consequences and actions every decision that we make have have things seen and unseen consequences let me say every decision we make have seen an unseen consequences oh glory to god hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise god so i want to strike the very team that brother solomon brought and it's brought from matthew 25 you're going to read the scripture shortly but jesus had an incredible way of telling parables and intelligent parables and stories what jesus did he include the people in the story themselves that they will see themselves that they will see their own hearts when he want to talk about brotherly kindness and helpfulness he said the kingdom of god is like a man saw a man beaten on the street and the pharisee passing by and this one passing by and that one passing by and i'm a man who is a samaritan oh praise god no no no religious person come and help him and put him in an inn and feed him and clothe him he said which one is your neighbor oh glory to god and he busts them like that so jesus will present words and make sure they see themselves in the story that he is telling oh glory to god when david's sin the prophet came up to david they say a man had one sheep and and our next man had so much and he leave all that he have and come said david said take that deal with that man he said the what the man that's what parable is about the story and inside the story it could reveal your own heart oh glory to god a woman caught in adultery he said which one of you can't have i have no sin cast the full stone yet tell them you just drop a mirror in front of them which one of you without sin cast the first stone and one by one they start to leave so that's the power of parables parables are hidden mysteries and stories hallelujah parables are keys in a story form oh glory to god hallelujah praise god so therefore when the parable come forth you could look at yourself you could look at what it's telling you you could look at what the story is telling you so don't take jesus parables lightly don't take when the word being spoken is likely that's the story it's more than just a story oh glory to god and this parable we are about to read is one of the most important ones hallelujah in connection with the coming of the lord it's from matthew 25 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps each had their own lamps that's personal lamp that's your lamp hallelujah praise god which took their lambs and went for to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps took no oil with them and though but the wise took all in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slipped and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom comet go yo to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lambs are gone out or going out but the wise answer say not so at least there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that already went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know not near the dean of the hour wearing the solomon comet watch be ready get ready stay ready oh praise god maybe we should stay that way get ready be ready and stay ready because the bible prophesied that the love of many gonna watch coal that is expected people will get dry up this panda pandemic send people to the left and to the right and chilling and quiet and everything else but they're gonna be a people are gonna see that not that the lord delay is coming but the lord already standing with a shout with a message and that message is lamb trimming time oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise god hallelujah the lord is when the son of man cometh luke 17 what happened the son of man revealed himself the same son of man that reveal himself to a prophet of malachi 4 that son of man is coming oh glory is coming in dynamics he's coming in power he's coming by his spirit a lot of people not expecting it they think they have it already but they don't know they got it to get oh glory to god they'll be taken unawares if you're not expecting you can't get the fulfillment of your expectation but you have to have expectation oh claude simeon had an expectation because we revealed the simeon that he would see the lord's christ that he was coming to the temple oh give the lord a shout simon was an old man but the revelation was not all i shall not see death till i see the lord christ hundreds of years of waiting for a manifestation and all mancinian grey-haired simeon come into church looking for deliverance looking for god almighty to come on the scene to bless him and to help his family and god revealed to him he shall not see death how much time the grim reaper come close but he can't touch him because he cannot see death until we see the lord's christ oh give the lord a shout we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed you are going to see the lord's christ you are going to see dynamics to the mechanics you are going to see signs and wonders miracles and powers you are going to see super church super race be encouraged bride of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen you may be seated when abraham got the promise of having isaac and he being an old man his wife being an old man after 25 years don't come elohim feel the human flesh to remind him of the promise to tell him i will return unto thee i'm coming back not as flesh but in power i'm coming back to change your body the change here everybody i'm coming back that you can produce isaac i'm coming back that you can produce a perfect man i'm coming back that you could have a living faith a living virtue and living knowledge a living temperance a living patient i'm coming back it will be my time of life your time of life i am coming back give the lord a shout [Applause] oh glory to god hallelujah parables stories one time just give a nice wedding parable about a wedding and you know the weather is not like we have it in the west it's an eastern book we didn't have an eastern style and i was privileged to see it in africa where everybody was wearing the same clothes i was telling my wife i wonder if i could storm that wedding but i didn't have the clothes i didn't have the clothes and everybody look alike in that wedding whatever they give out you have to dress the same way and that is how it was in the bible that the guest the host provided the clothes for the people so when you have the invitation you present invitation and you get a garmin to go in so people don't know if you're poor if you're rich if you have money you don't have money as long as you pretend we present the invitation you get a robe and everybody have the robe everybody looking the same and the king came out and saw a man without the robe he said sir he called him friend he knew him he said friend how how will you get here because everybody passed through the door get a robe and that robe is the baptism of the holy ghost that romans are joining the church that brothers don't play in tapes that road they're not saying who your pastor is that robe is the baptism of the holy ghost he said this man come true not the door he comes your window he comes to the roof he comes through anywhere else but the door because you come to the door you get a robe we'll give the lord a shout you'll be just like everybody else oh glory to god this is a serious message you know it may sound light it may sound like a story but it's a dead serious message you know this messes up tribulation in it this message that rapture in it this message of the bridegroom coming in it this presence of the bride in it oh glory to god this message of oil in it but this person have wise versions in it this message our foolish versions in it oh everybody's including this message oh glory to god this message of time in it time are lingering when they think the lord coming right now right now right though and he stretch it out or give the lord a shout they see them who could persevere to see those who could press [Music] glory this message exposes those that say the law delay is coming so let me fight one uh yes hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah for the brianna and remember the very time that the sleep invasion went to buy oil that is when the bridegroom came he said glory he's in the don't you see it if the presbyterians and his percolation and those others are coming to

have wick you have the glass over it you have the bowl with the oil and when you light the lamp after a while it gets your wick gets swooty you have to take it down and cut the wick that is called trimming the wick and when you cut the wick it shines brighter you clean the glass and jesus said so let your light shine he said let's shine you know so let your light shine that men may see your

what god said to a prophet they believe they're taught that by people that stand by their own conviction in my conviction you know yeah your conviction more than god you're on your own standing with your own conviction i've seen it so that you're seeing god saying my thoughts are not your thoughts and you know when i start to die when you start to dismiss what you see him and say god that is what you said in your word i believe that i put my feelings aside i put my opinion aside i put my own politics aside america finisher so it's not a matter republican or democrat you know america finished you know the world is finished you know this is bright timmy coming into you know daniel saw a stone no man ain't gonna mind that stone no dynamite blow that stone you talk about a stone cut out without the hands of man god don't need the hands of man to bring that stone and the comment of that stone and the gentile dispensation the covenant of that stone is a capstone to the bride it's the judgment to the world oh glory to god we are actually in the coming of the lord get ready or be ready and stay ready your glory to god hallelujah don't get your gum and spotted oh glory to god don't get to come and filthy don't get to come as dirty keep them clean and white oh give the lord some praises amen amen let's go from the rapture he said to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture what a revelation yes and who does give revelation the holy ghost alone is the revealer of the revelation of jesus christ let me say it again no no man that's why you say if they say low here come here come here go here forget them they have the clue what are they talking about like spiritual man tried to draw men but oh glory to god he said behold the kingdom is within you and when you understand that the bride has the ability somebody's out that ability the ability to get direct from god god put that air inside you know devil could take that out you know when god talking to you you know when god's speaking to you you know when you hearing direct from god the bride have the ability to hear direct from god god put something inside of you to hear his word i don't care if you backs it in a hundred years oh glory to god when you hear that voice you have to have you can't have in your heart oh glory to god my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow oh the only following the word we are word sheep oh glory to god not man sheep wear sheep not pasta sheep were cheap my sheep hear my voice it's a revelation why revelation is fit you cannot have a revelation without being fit fit is a revelation because sometimes revealed to you faith is a revelation and faith is something revealed to you like it was to abraham that would do what call anything contrary to what has been revealed to him now faith that's what the revelation of that's what the church is built upon the entire body is built not upon knowledge knowledge is information which pumping heavy now but we're not talking about information we don't want divine revelation so somebody could be sitting in front of you next to you and they do have a clue what's going on and holy spirit just drop down so that's it revealed to you and you leave there in that in your pocket and nobody knows nobody knows not even the pastor you hear what i said not even the pastor because this is not father pastor son this is father and son business let might say they're getting good because some people feel god having some in between somebody and some secretary you know god don't need secretary anna [Music] when eliana was coming to slackness and god recognized the whole priesthood footed and polluted god called samuel you know a young girl called samuel [Applause] so god can't call her any angel oh praise the name of the lord all right so i want you to notice a greeting taking

the world shake the message will have to shake oh yes hallelujah the church will have to shake first who written jesus jacob it wasn't quite fascinating is the pharisees and sadducees who taught the hardy people locked down and when jesus had to do miracles so they say old man go after him when lazarus raised from the dead they say oh god we finished now we had to get rid of this man yes but because he crazy dead and all this is trouble this is plenty trouble oh hallelujah the plot to kill him give judah some money to sell him out but that still didn't concept jesus he said my always not

lamb trimming time [Applause] [Music] glory what it is to be ready what it is to be unaware what does court unawares mean it means to affect someone without warning without being expected example the rainstorm quarters unawares definition of unawares without design attention preparation or premeditation without warning unawares means suddenly unexpectedly without knowing or being away unintentionally unexpectedly suddenly by surprise to sneak up on someone on our ways now we're gonna read luke 21 jesus speaking heaven earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away amen take heed to yourselves this is jesus talking to giving a warning at least at any time your hearts be overcharged with the fighting and drunkness and cares of this life so that that day come upon you unawares for as a sneer so he's describing how it coming do you know your thoughts are my thoughts this is jesus this is written in red as a smear shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole eat watch you therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man and the amplified jesus said the sky and the earth the universe the world will pass away but my words will not pass away but take heed to yourselves and be on your guard lease your hearts be overburdened and depressed weigh down with the giddiness and the headache and the nausea of self-indulgence drunkness worldly worries and cares pertaining to the business of this life least that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose for it shall come upon all who live upon the face of the entirety so this is not a a train that trial oh we going through something we do something you can do this is for the entire world the entire world isn't that right he said keep awake then and watch at all times be discreet attentive and ready praying that you may have full strength and ability to be accounted worthy to escape all these things sticking together that will take place and stand in the presence of the son of man first sister in five spirit this scripture reads but of the times and seasons brethren we have no need i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord shall commit as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction should come upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not escape but he brethren are not in darkness that that they should overtake you as a teeth you're all the churn of light on the churn of the day we are not of the night no of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for day that sleep sleep in the night daily be drunk not drunk in the night let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and fun helmet the hope of salvation for god has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ oh my and this is this verse truly unbelievable is so powerful he said when people are saying all is well and secure there is peace and safety then in a moment unforeseen destruction ruin and death will come upon them as suddenly as labor pains come upon a woman with child they shall by no means escape there will be no escape oh my when libertarians hit a woman she cast up the pains she cast up that labor force coming through oh that's how we're going to come upon the world so god don't want you to be taking on our ways get ready and stay ready oh harlow as you hear what i said get ready and stay ready islam trimming time trim out the excess flesh trim off the excess world trim off what is not right in your life oh bring it before god and put it up on the brass altar oh glory to god hallelujah gonna have a cleanse bride a purified bride oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus you know like when isaiah went to the temple and the fire came upon him he ball woe is me if he didn't see that he couldn't get close we say i could just get ready as i could no no seraph coming to burn his lips but when he was who is me i'm undone i'm a man of unclean lips when he can confess he's unclean then they could come with the toes from off the altar oh glory to god and cleanse him when you're sick he can say lord i'm sick heal me oh glory to god you're dumb you're you're drunk and i'll say god i'm depressed but raise me up this morning oh glory to god i'm struggling but help me and strengthen me god give me a word and god could give you a word there that wait upon the lord showing you their

[Applause] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god my lord my lord my lord this is dead serious this has nothing to do with what you should belong to hallelujah when the press come in they asked him if you have one seal two still have steve samso they they're coming and coming and coming and coming and coming where you're not coming hallelujah like a woman escaped oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah what the foolish vision thought what the foolish virgins thought they knew they should be ready but they would not they thought there would be oil to purchase they thought it was okay to procrastinate putting off for tomorrow what you can do today putting it off in the door unwilling to act when they know they should procrastination is a form of rebellion because you don't want to follow instructions you don't want to be told what to do how to do and by what time to do it so you want to do it in your own time you want to be in charge so you're put off for tomorrow things you should know to do today they thought that they were in charge in charge of their own time they will do it when they choose they thought dynamics will come sooner not so late as midnight you see because they didn't know when the brand grew coming so time started to take its toll hallelujah i expected him at three o'clock who tell you that i get that revolution that's your revolution he said coming to your club your day is sitting waiting to your club four o'clock five o'clock your eye getting them feeling asleep they fell asleep at midnight the time you least expect a friend of the bridegroom say behold he coming caught near to midnight caught at a time that was not expected hallelujah they thought that it would come when they thought it should come they never thought the time would be drawn out to midnight they never expected the door to be shut to them they didn't understand when the son of man comes as dynamics he who is filthy be filthy still he who is righteous is righteous still and who is the filthy the foolish virgins prophet call him the filthy who they did not expect and asking the wise for oil the wise would say not so. that is the foolish version they say give us of your oil you know what i mean i we we know each other a long time time to share they didn't expect the answer from the lips of the wise the why say not so the foolish was shocked to hear those words not so no one no doubt the foolish would ask and get whatever they wanted but this was oil at a certain time at the time of the bridegroom comet the wise was listening to the call behold the bridegroom comment hallelujah in other words he's right at the door you asked me for oil not so not so not so was not the response they were expecting not so was an astonishing response to them when they knew the kindness gave them things in the time past hallelujah you know the age of kindness yeah but not so the wise was responding to the cry behold the blood will commit and i can't afford that what i got to run out oh give the lord some praises the wife said what i have now sorry not so can you could you pray for me the usual request got a rebuke go and pray for it for yourself go and buy go to them that sell don't ask me for anything no don't beg i want to pray for you now go and pray for yourself go and pay the price go to them that sell go and buy buy implies there's a price to be paid sell means that there is available if it is available did they know it ran out they didn't know the the final bucket of the holy ghost after a while runs out they thought it was still available for purchase they were not ready to forgive they hold oughts for years they hold grudge for years they're not ready to forgive because they want to have access to the holy spirit slot hallelujah they're not ready to break through the skylight of brotherly kindness to access the holy spirit but the bible says door was shut up no ready to forgive after all he has a bad behavior nasty behavior not ready to forgive when forgiveness shall be in your spirit in your heart and mind one disciples ask jesus shall we forgive our brother 70 times save me he says 70 times 7. they have jesus seven times a day as if you could come to my time somebody could offend you a day number says congress and that was a big number it says sometimes that did you say 70 times 7. forgive your brother hallelujah you know what they said open to us that a group revelation you could see that they were felt entitled because they didn't have the oil and yet they still had the confidence say open to us we are brethren we believe we are virgins but god could tell him but you are foolish [Music] and your foolishness will have a reward you have a choice you always have a choice hallelujah the scripture in we read it but in the advertising he replied i suddenly clear to you i do not know you i am not acquainted with you oh my listen they did not expect time would run out on them they had time to pray they had time to seek the lord that time they begged god for the holy ghost because the bible said he gave the holy ghost to them that ask him oh glory to god and you can't ask god to give you the holy ghost and a filthy vessel you better get clean so god give them time to ask for holiness righteousness cleansing purification whatever it is to tarry to wait whatever it is to take out and as you trim you have to add oil hallelujah you cannot wait till last minute to make up for what you could have had or what you should have had to give of your best let me say it again you cannot and should not wait for last minute because at the last minute what best you gonna give god when you had all the time to prepare your heart and mine oh glory to god those three wise men they brought gifts of gold frankincense and moon they just traveled all them two years and when they come to see abbas i say you have a toy you have a give me that no i want i go and see messiah no they had revelation that inspiration one word goal representing god one word frankie sends what we're in service one brought me representing debt god in service to die was the message that three of them was presented by presenting these three gifts oh hallelujah it took time it took meditation it took inspiration it took prayer it took sacrifice for them to get that long distance to bring that offering to god amen last minute cannot make up for what you could have or should have done to give of your best your best is what he expects from you what god tell them they want to offer gold kind of beaufort lamb and what kind of crooked things and what is it gives a governor will be bring it give it to them they want to give god what we mean they want to give god wherever they want to give god but god should get your best [Applause] he wants your heart he wants your mind he wants your soul and he wants your body because you are the temple of the holy ghost bite of jesus christ hallelujah i know you're not and that is a familiar phrase i think it's spoken about three times in the scriptures if i'm not mistaken and i'm going to read one of them there's some luke chapter 13 reading verse 22. and he went to the cities and villages teaching and journeying towards jerusalem and he said unto them then said warning to them lord are they few that can be saved and he said unto them strive to enter into the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able when once the master of the house is risen up and had shot to the door you begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us he shall answer and say unto you i know you're not whence he ah then shall he begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and i was taught in our streets and he shall say i tell you i know you not whence i depart from me all the workers of iniquity so this was a nice debate they were saying but jesus you you spoke to us you you eat with us you was on our street you talk with us he said i don't know hey why because you're a worker of iniquity watch this there shall be weep in the nation of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves trust out and they shall come from the east and from the west from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom and behold dear which at last shall be first and therefore fool shall be lost i don't know you worker of iniquity with a brown you see people a long time ago you ought to have come to god and got yourself settled down to know where you were standing the bible said in these last days that there will be a famine not for bread and alone but for the hearing of the word of god and they will go from east west north and south trying to find it and would fail you better get sealed into the kingdom of god by the holy ghost why you got a chance you talk about the confusion time it's coming and the bible said they'll be so close that it will receive the very elect if it is possible is that right no another question i want to clear up someone said is it doesn't mean that you're a christian because you heal the sickle cast oh devils he said that's true many will come to me and say lord lord have my done devil castle devils in thy name in thy name done mighty works jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity i didn't even know you now these people claim they've done it but they did not do it that's right i never knew you they just claimed they done it no how could you write a check on me without me knowing i mean a check for the bank jesus said many will come and say lord have not i he said i didn't know you many will confess and say i cast out devils in thy name in thy name i prophesied preachers and so forth and everything he will say depart from me he workers of iniquity i didn't even know you some people might have went out and had some big and a fleshly idea try to get popular and some big education could speak a few 12 words and make some money out of it jesus you workers of iniquity i didn't even know you you want to get to an iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and will not do it hallelujah what you must do get the oil not just all the extra all in your lamp that means every service every time you go along and pray you're hungry oh god tell me lamp lord he said the early church always do like they never had anything when they beat them they went in the room and instead of taking sick leave and taking time out they say lord god sending on your power once again and they were filled again with the holy ghost they were refilled with the holy ghost oh glo i mean you're trimming that lamp you're looking pouring oil as the lamb burning you're pouring all because that lamp is burning while you're waiting while you're waiting the lamb burning praise god while you're waiting you're keeping ready that's why you have an extra vessel with oil oh god so when they say behold the brand new comet you could take your extra vessel party all in your lamp and go out to meet him or give the lord some praises hallelujah can't go over there's the lamp you have to go with oil in the land fire in that lamp fire in your heart fire your soul oh glory to god your light shining bright [Applause] the prophet every man knows he's got to be born again by the spirit of god you've got to receive the holy ghost to turn it down just as it was to know to turn it down is just the same as the term jehovah of the old testament dung in that day or jesus and tasty same penalty always oh my hallelujah oh to this parable of the ten five versions and and five wise five foolish it have a parable that identifies preparation expectation being ready and staying ready oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord verse 10 is a powerful voice of that scripture while they went to buy while they went to pray while they went to pay the price while they went to make things right the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him and the door was shut that's a whole message inside right there oh glory to god in other words filthy filthy still righteous righteousness you cannot change your ways it's a snap picture you're caught hallelujah glory to god so this parable emphasizes the need to act now
