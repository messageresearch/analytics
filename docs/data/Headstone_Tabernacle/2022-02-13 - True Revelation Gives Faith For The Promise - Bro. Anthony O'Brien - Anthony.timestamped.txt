[37:05] so god has been blessing us
[37:07] thus far
[37:08] so we're gonna turn our bible down to uh
[37:10] deuteronomy 29
[37:12] also to saint john 1 and hebrews 11
[37:15] for scripture reading so firstly if you
[37:17] could look at
[37:19] deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 29
[37:22] familiar scriptures but
[37:24] just something that the lord uh
[37:27] well has just
[37:29] inspired me to so
[37:31] praying that god will
[37:32] bless us this morning to uh
[37:35] see what he's saying to us this morning
[37:37] amen
[37:38] deuteronomy 29 29
[37:41] says the secret things belong unto the
[37:43] lord our god
[37:45] but those things which are revealed
[37:48] belong unto us
[37:50] and to our children
[37:52] forever
[37:53] that we may do all the words
[37:56] of this law amen now saint john 1 new
[37:59] testament
[38:00] we'll read the
[38:02] last portion of scriptures there saint
[38:04] john 1 2 3
[38:06] we'll read inclusively amen
[38:09] and saint john 1 says in the beginning
[38:10] was the word
[38:11] and the word was with god
[38:13] and the word was god
[38:16] the same was in the beginning
[38:18] with god
[38:20] all things were made by him and without
[38:22] him was not anything made that was made
[38:26] amen and amen diving over to hebrews
[38:29] chapter 11
[38:31] reading from verse six
[38:33] man we're familiar with that
[38:35] chapter but we just want to pull this
[38:36] voice out here
[38:39] amen
[38:40] to for context
[38:42] hebrews 11
[38:44] 6
[38:45] says but without faith
[38:47] it is impossible to please him
[38:49] for he that cometh to god must believe
[38:52] that he is
[38:53] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[38:56] diligently seek him
[38:58] amen and amen let's bow our heads one
[38:59] more time praise god
[39:02] oh heavenly father lord we
[39:04] come into your presence today lord
[39:07] cognizant of the fact lord father
[39:09] that we are nothing this morning
[39:12] we are but tools in your hands lord that
[39:14] you could use father and lord we offer
[39:17] ourselves for you before your lord as a
[39:19] living sacrifice lord may you come and
[39:21] bless your people lord father lord as
[39:24] lord as we read these scriptures father
[39:25] we pray that your holy spirit would just
[39:27] come and lord give me the words to speak
[39:29] to your people father i can do nothing
[39:32] without you lord these people wear
[39:34] nothing without you father so lord we
[39:36] surrender to your will and to your way
[39:37] father
[39:38] make me a servant today and father
[39:40] highway behind your presence father may
[39:42] you speak your word only oh god father
[39:44] and come behind it lord anoint it afresh
[39:47] give us a fresh anointing a fresh
[39:48] inspiration
[39:50] for the hour that we're living in father
[39:52] for our great charge is upon us granted
[39:56] almighty god may bless your heart to the
[39:57] people now as we dive into the
[40:00] scriptures lord to see what you would
[40:01] speak to us lord may you anoint us and
[40:04] inspire us one more time we pray and ask
[40:06] these things in your precious name amen
[40:09] and amen you may be seated
[40:14] praise god amen
[40:17] [Music]
[40:20] hallelujah amen praise god so for title
[40:23] amen we've chosen
[40:26] true revelation gives faith for the
[40:28] promise
[40:30] amen that's my title this morning and
[40:32] advice but i had for inspiration here
[40:35] lord increase my faith amen lord
[40:39] increase my faith
[40:41] amen as inspiration i have here it's
[40:43] kind of like a prayer
[40:44] that i'm setting it out ass
[40:47] and i'll just give a little extra
[40:49] experience praise the name of the lord
[40:51] but lord increase my faith
[40:52] and uh you know i was just worshiping
[40:54] and this thought came to me just about
[40:56] early january early to mid-january
[40:58] and um you know i was just in the car
[41:00] kind of worshiping and stuff like that
[41:02] and
[41:03] i was listening to
[41:04] some worship and i i heard someone say
[41:06] lord increase my faith
[41:08] you know and i began to think on that
[41:10] because i'm asking myself well lord what
[41:13] does that really mean you know
[41:15] and so i'm asking lord what does it
[41:17] really mean to increase your faith
[41:19] and we know many times the prophet talk
[41:21] about faith and revelation and he says
[41:24] it's one and the same
[41:26] isn't that right
[41:27] and that
[41:28] so what when someone asks lord increase
[41:30] my faith what are you asking him to do
[41:33] really what he asked him to do
[41:35] is for him to reveal himself to you
[41:37] in a way that your faith could take a
[41:39] hole
[41:40] is not right because the more of himself
[41:42] is revealed is the more faith you can
[41:45] have
[41:46] in what he said
[41:47] isn't iran and it come like what brother
[41:50] isaac was preaching last week
[41:52] as god unfolded himself
[41:55] and became jehovah jireh as he became
[41:58] jehovah rapha the people's faith
[42:00] increased in who god was
[42:03] as he continued to unfold himself
[42:06] amen there was more of him to unfold and
[42:09] as he unfolded himself he became more to
[42:12] them if they needed healing he became a
[42:14] healer he became their deliverer he
[42:17] became their shepherd he became their
[42:20] righteousness
[42:21] he became their isn't that right oh
[42:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:26] so that's what i'm talking about lord
[42:27] increase my faith what we're really
[42:30] talking about is god giving you an
[42:32] experience
[42:34] praise god of unveiling his word to you
[42:36] praise god so that you could see more of
[42:38] him so that the more of him you see
[42:41] is the more your faith can hold
[42:45] oh you don't hear me this morning
[42:47] hallelujah hallelujah because what has
[42:49] been revealed to us in this age is more
[42:52] than the other ages had gone past
[42:55] luther had a tip of it wesley had a tip
[42:58] of it but what has been revealed to us
[43:01] in this day
[43:02] we can see the whole program of god
[43:06] oh hallowed from faith all the way to
[43:08] charity and that ought to give us our
[43:10] faith oh hallelujah our seventh and
[43:14] faith to claim the promises of god for
[43:17] this day
[43:19] oh
[43:20] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[43:23] hallelujah isn't that right
[43:25] praise god amen hallelujah so i
[43:27] certainly appreciate that message amen
[43:29] praise god hallelujah i'm backing you up
[43:31] brother amen each one back one another
[43:34] up
[43:34] praise god hallelujah that's another
[43:36] ephesians break that's what we're coming
[43:38] to praise god and we see the unfolding
[43:41] of his word
[43:43] and what does it do it ought to give us
[43:45] faith
[43:46] amen it ought to increase our faith as
[43:49] we see more of him unfold isn't that
[43:51] right
[43:52] so this faith we're talking about what
[43:54] is it it's a revelation
[43:56] and as god is god given faith
[43:58] isn't that right
[44:00] it's something that's divinely revealed
[44:02] to you
[44:03] it's to the individual
[44:06] isn't that right
[44:07] virtue could pour out knowledge could
[44:09] pour out but faith is revealed oh reveal
[44:13] to you as an individual
[44:15] who you are who god is who the devil is
[44:19] and when you get that revelation fate it
[44:22] gives you power to possess your promise
[44:25] because you see by revelation
[44:27] what you have to possess
[44:29] oh
[44:30] somebody's saying man this morning i'm
[44:32] not here to warm a church bench i'm not
[44:35] here to be a church member but i'm here
[44:37] to find out what i'm here to possess
[44:40] i'm here to possess my mountain god
[44:42] didn't bring you this far
[44:44] just to bring you this far no no no no
[44:47] he brought you out
[44:49] to take you in
[44:51] to your promise to your holy ghost and
[44:54] fire
[44:55] all our redemption is in two parts
[44:58] coming out of and going into
[45:01] i didn't come for no halfway gospel i
[45:04] didn't come for no halfway redemption
[45:06] jesus didn't die halfway
[45:09] he died the whole way
[45:10] he unveiled a whole
[45:12] temple it was rent hallelujah to give
[45:15] you access
[45:17] to your promise to your heavenly father
[45:21] somebody say amen
[45:23] oh
[45:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[45:26] hallelujah
[45:28] glory
[45:29] do you believe it
[45:31] so in order for you to have faith
[45:33] you have to see something
[45:36] you have to see something
[45:39] your faith must rest in the word reveal
[45:43] the word presented to you in truth
[45:46] hallelujah then god anoints that
[45:49] he cannot anoint your own thoughts he
[45:51] cannot anoint your flesh but he can
[45:54] anoint his word oh hallelujah isn't that
[45:57] right
[45:58] luring
[46:00] your faith is based on what has been
[46:02] divinely revealed to you isn't that
[46:04] right so let's ride through here quickly
[46:06] amen your faith takes a hold of that and
[46:08] says god said so
[46:10] isn't that right
[46:12] that's why faith comes by hearing
[46:15] and hearing the word of god and then
[46:18] when it revealed to you
[46:20] it belongs to you
[46:22] oh let me say that again when it's
[46:24] revealed to you
[46:25] then it belongs to you
[46:27] so if god reveal your healing it belongs
[46:29] to you if god reveal your ceiling it
[46:32] belongs to you if god will reveal the
[46:34] holy ghost to you then it belongs to you
[46:37] it is your portion oh hallelujah
[46:40] hallelujah oh
[46:43] because the secret things belong to god
[46:45] that's his secret that's his secret to
[46:48] keep he's suffering he can choose to
[46:50] reveal whatever he wants to so if god
[46:53] withhold back something you can't fix it
[46:55] god that's his secrets that's the
[46:58] father's secrets that's in his time to
[47:00] do that is in his time to reveal
[47:03] whatever he wants to do isn't that right
[47:05] nobody can question him although he is
[47:08] called supreme but whatever he revealed
[47:11] to you
[47:12] that is yours the holy ghost is yours
[47:15] seven thunders is yours the anointing is
[47:17] yours your theophany oh hello your place
[47:21] in christ if god reveal that to you then
[47:23] that is yours this morning then no devil
[47:26] on the universe can take that away from
[47:29] you if god revealed to you this morning
[47:32] that he's going to deliver your family i
[47:34] don't care how many devils oh your faith
[47:37] will stand
[47:39] oh
[47:40] because revelation is fulfilling power
[47:44] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[47:47] [Applause]
[47:50] [Music]
[47:56] [Applause]
[47:58] hallelujah
[48:00] hallelujah he revealed something to you
[48:02] that you didn't know before
[48:05] isn't that right
[48:06] you're born in sin
[48:08] shape and iniquity
[48:09] come in the world speaking lies
[48:11] you came into this world clueless
[48:14] not doing anything
[48:15] but god know everything so when god
[48:18] reveals something to you you start to
[48:20] jump and shout
[48:21] because you now see in it but god
[48:23] already know that a long time
[48:25] and guess what you have more to show if
[48:28] you stay with that word here more to
[48:31] show you you think you see something god
[48:33] just pulled back a little thing so and
[48:35] you jump in and shouting when god pull
[48:37] it back and he pulled it back and he
[48:39] pulled it back oh how do you begin to
[48:41] scream and shout oh because you're
[48:43] seeing more of god unfolding
[48:46] oh
[48:47] hallelujah on the seventh seal will
[48:49] continue to unfold unfold and explode
[48:52] and explode until we see christ
[48:55] reproduce himself again
[48:57] in the natural that's what we're looking
[49:00] for that's the time we're living in
[49:02] praise god
[49:03] hallelujah
[49:08] oh amen amen
[49:10] glory
[49:12] so we've been living in a time of the
[49:13] revelation
[49:15] of these things being made known
[49:17] so that you could hook in
[49:18] praise god to malachi fourth third paul
[49:21] the opening of the word the mysteries
[49:23] reveal to know who you are
[49:25] who god is and who the devil is praise
[49:28] god your faith is not based on signs and
[49:30] wonders but your faith is based on your
[49:32] name and epoch because whatever your
[49:34] name is in there that's what you're
[49:36] going to receive oh hallelujah we have
[49:39] not received connelly devised fables
[49:42] praise god but there's a name in the
[49:44] book praise god concerning you

[49:51] natural name
[49:52] as brother branham said not leave ale
[49:54] not all roberts but the mystery of what
[49:57] the book is
[49:58] while it is calling those names so when
[50:00] the word is preached and the word is
[50:02] being revealed and the word is being
[50:04] anointed something inside of you connect
[50:07] with the name on the book and you see
[50:10] what you are supposed to be by
[50:13] revelation
[50:15] oh
[50:17] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:19] then when you come to church you make
[50:21] your mind up that no devil can stop you
[50:24] no demon can stop you you come to
[50:26] worship you come to bow down you come to
[50:28] create an atmosphere because you know
[50:30] you have a holy ghost to get doesn't
[50:32] matter who on the left won the right i

[50:54] [Music]
[50:55] [Applause]
[50:57] oh my
[50:59] keeping the time here amen okay
[51:02] so with revelation
[51:03] it gives you the power to see
[51:05] what you're supposed to see
[51:07] and it gives you ability to possess
[51:09] what you know is your own when caleb see

[51:44] in heavenly places
[51:47] hallelujah
[51:49] what is heavenly places the believer's
[51:52] position in christ
[51:54] that's when you're in heavenly places
[51:56] when you can find your place
[51:58] some apostles some prophet some teacher
[52:00] your place the church is striving today
[52:03] to find her place god may you send a
[52:06] revival to shake the church into their
[52:08] place shake the church into a position

[52:39] do you feel him
[52:41] he's anointing your faith
[52:44] amen
[52:45] i'm trying to get off page one amen
[52:47] what god is now showing you
[52:50] is not new
[52:51] to him
[52:53] it's not new things
[52:55] you know
[52:56] he's been thinking about this a long
[52:58] time
[53:00] how long we don't know
[53:02] it's undefined
[53:03] it could be thousands of years
[53:05] it could be millions but when elohim sat
[53:08] alone with his thoughts
[53:09] he knew what he wanted to do
[53:11] he knew how he was going to do it he
[53:13] knew who he was going to choose that's
[53:15] why it pleased god
[53:17] it put a smile on his face
[53:19] to choose you
[53:21] because the devil look at you
[53:23] and see a pony one who's struggling and
[53:26] can't pay the pills but when god looked
[53:28] down he see a mighty
[53:31] mighty marching army
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:32] [Music]
[53:35] amen
[53:37] oh my
[53:41] you know recent recently i was studying
[53:42] the book of moses
[53:44] and moses as a character you know the
[53:45] scripture kind of
[53:47] gives glimpses of who he was based on
[53:49] how we express himself and talk and
[53:50] different things so if you go through
[53:52] the scripture you really see
[53:53] you get a glimpse of his
[53:56] his his his character his
[53:58] his disposition
[54:00] you know as he talks talk to god
[54:03] you know in his conversation
[54:05] as a scripture accounts it
[54:07] and when you really look it over moses
[54:10] was moses was a mess you know
[54:14] i started off song and real good i mean
[54:17] his story song sort of real nice and
[54:20] he was pulled out of the water
[54:22] you know he was
[54:25] brought into the king's
[54:26] palace
[54:28] raised up as an egyptian
[54:30] in his mind he really thought that he
[54:32] was going to be deliverer
[54:33] to the people
[54:35] he thought so
[54:36] he when he saw the egyptian
[54:38] doing wrong to the hebrew and so forth
[54:40] like that he looked this way he looked
[54:41] that way the bible says and he went and
[54:43] slew him
[54:44] you know
[54:45] and then his own people

[1:00:38] whatever he had planned is already
[1:00:39] settled

[1:00:56] omnipotence speaks the miraculous just
[1:00:59] take place
[1:01:00] because god packs up his own word
[1:01:03] and he is his own interpreter
[1:01:06] he don't need no other interpretation he
[1:01:08] will interpret his own way and the
[1:01:10] manifestation will be the interpretation
[1:01:13] of what he said of what he promised when
[1:01:17] he comes and fulfills it
[1:01:19] so then what is it your faith is being
[1:01:21] tested
[1:01:22] to see if you could hold on long enough
[1:01:25] to what he said and then he fulfills it
[1:01:28] and proves what he said and proves that
[1:01:31] your fate is ripe and proves that your
[1:01:33] fate was real
[1:01:35] and that you did surely believe in the
[1:01:37] god that spoke to you
[1:01:39] oh hallelujah pray what a confirmation
[1:01:43] what a vindication when god proves his
[1:01:45] word
[1:01:46] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:50] oh man can make a promise but he breaks
[1:01:53] his promises but god cannot breaks his
[1:01:56] promise because he is god and he has the
[1:01:59] ability
[1:02:00] he has the ability to keep his own word
[1:02:04] oh so if he said he's gonna deliver you
[1:02:07] he's gonna deliver you if he said he's
[1:02:09] gonna fill you he's gonna fill you with
[1:02:10] the holy ghost if he said he's gonna
[1:02:12] heal you if he's sad i'll bring you out
[1:02:15] with a mighty hand if he promises he is
[1:02:19] going to do it
[1:02:21] oh hallelujah
[1:02:25] so here we are on earth
[1:02:26] in the context of time
[1:02:28] isn't that right
[1:02:29] beginning and end
[1:02:31] we were born in sin shape and inequity
[1:02:32] isn't that right
[1:02:33] we didn't know what truth was
[1:02:35] so it was only when god's truth was
[1:02:37] presented to us
[1:02:39] then we caught something
[1:02:42] then that something in you
[1:02:44] responded to the word of god's truth
[1:02:46] presented as the word of god
[1:02:49] then that's how you got faith
[1:02:51] isn't that right we get faith when god
[1:02:53] would reveal to us something we didn't
[1:02:55] see before something previously hid but
[1:02:58] in god's mind was always there
[1:03:00] isn't that right isn't that right on the
[1:03:02] rapture the prophet said but to the
[1:03:04] church the bride
[1:03:05] the rapture is a revelation to her
[1:03:07] that's right
[1:03:09] it's revealed to her
[1:03:10] that the revelation the true bride of
[1:03:13] christ will be waiting for that
[1:03:15] revelation of the rapture oh hello it's
[1:03:18] a revelation isn't that right now it's a
[1:03:20] revelation he said what for the
[1:03:21] revelation is faith here he says it here
[1:03:25] you cannot have a revelation without it
[1:03:28] being faith
[1:03:30] faith is a revelation oh
[1:03:34] hallelujah so says the prophet amen and
[1:03:36] we believe it amen because it's
[1:03:38] something that's revealed to you isn't
[1:03:40] that right
[1:03:40] faith is a revelation he says it again
[1:03:43] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:03:45] you
[1:03:46] like it was revealed to abraham
[1:03:48] that could call anything contrary to
[1:03:50] what had been revealed to him
[1:03:52] as though it wasn't so
[1:03:54] isn't that right he didn't see a son he
[1:03:58] couldn't feel him he couldn't hear him
[1:04:00] but what's amazing about faith is that
[1:04:03] it's a super sense
[1:04:04] faith could do all the things the five
[1:04:06] senses can't do
[1:04:08] so when god told abraham he would have a
[1:04:10] son
[1:04:11] his eyes couldn't see it but faith could
[1:04:13] see it his ears couldn't hear it but
[1:04:16] fate could hear it his hands couldn't
[1:04:18] touch it but his faith declared that it
[1:04:20] was real
[1:04:22] and it counted everything else as a lie
[1:04:24] and took god's word as truth
[1:04:27] and abraham staggered not of the promise
[1:04:29] of god hallelujah hallelujah but was
[1:04:31] strong in faith giving praise to god
[1:04:35] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:38] hallelujah
[1:04:42] oh
[1:04:43] my
[1:04:44] because it was revealed
[1:04:46] not based on an idea
[1:04:48] not a theology or a creed or a doctrine
[1:04:51] but what god said
[1:04:53] he just took it for what it was
[1:04:55] no explanation needed
[1:04:57] no injection of man thoughts or man's
[1:05:00] ideas hallelujah and so he produced a
[1:05:03] promised son isn't that right
[1:05:04] isn't that right
[1:05:06] even though sarah herself doubted
[1:05:08] that it would be so
[1:05:10] god revealed to abraham didn't matter
[1:05:12] how much faith sarah had
[1:05:14] abraham's fate stood in the gap for
[1:05:17] sarah abraham's face was counted for
[1:05:20] righteousness and even though his wife
[1:05:23] touted the word hallelujah god still
[1:05:25] revealed to her who she was and what was
[1:05:28] going to happen and next 28 days not a
[1:05:32] time of life something going to take
[1:05:33] place something going to come over you
[1:05:36] hallelujah hallelujah you're gonna be
[1:05:38] overshadowed oh with the holy spirit oh
[1:05:41] glory glory glory glory glory glory
[1:05:43] glory hallelujah
[1:05:45] [Applause]
[1:05:47] my
[1:05:48] it's not right so faith is a super sense
[1:05:52] it sees the promise
[1:05:54] when you can't see it
[1:05:55] it goes the distance
[1:05:57] when you get tired
[1:05:59] it stands a test
[1:06:00] when you get weary when you feel like
[1:06:02] you can't go on your faith says there's
[1:06:05] still something out there
[1:06:07] i know it's got to be
[1:06:09] i know god spoke to me
[1:06:11] when i think back about how lost i was
[1:06:14] and then he spoke to me he told me
[1:06:16] something he told me he was gonna do
[1:06:19] something for my family for my son for
[1:06:22] my daughter for my husband for me he was
[1:06:26] gonna fill me with the holy ghost he
[1:06:28] told me he was gonna seal me when you
[1:06:30] see god speaks to you in his scripture
[1:06:32] you cannot doubt it there's something in
[1:06:34] you that has faith to stay with that
[1:06:38] word
[1:06:39] oh
[1:06:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:43] and god
[1:06:44] is forcing the issue because nations are
[1:06:46] breaking
[1:06:47] israel's awakening signs of the prophets
[1:06:50] foretold are coming to pass right in
[1:06:52] front of very eyes
[1:06:53] it ought to get us desperate to see this
[1:06:56] word fulfill
[1:06:58] god will not be slack concerning his
[1:07:01] promises he is not as men are he is god
[1:07:05] he lies not whatever he said shall come
[1:07:07] to pass if his judgment is judgment and
[1:07:10] if his righteousness is righteousness oh
[1:07:13] hallelujah hallelujah but on that day
[1:07:16] michael is going to stand up and he's
[1:07:19] going to begin to deliver every name
[1:07:21] that is on that book and if your name is
[1:07:24] on that book this morning
[1:07:26] happy
[1:07:27] hallelujah because your redemption draw
[1:07:30] at night
[1:07:31] look up this morning
[1:07:33] look up for your redemption
[1:07:35] destroying night there's a reason to
[1:07:38] celebrate there's a reason to praise
[1:07:40] your god this morning there's a reason i
[1:07:42] have faith there's a reason to lift your
[1:07:44] hands there is a reason to try one more
[1:07:47] time because god is not slack concerning
[1:07:50] his promise he will fulfill it he will
[1:07:53] do it god said so
[1:07:56] i came this morning because i know he
[1:08:00] can do it
[1:08:01] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:07] come on
[1:08:12] amen okay quickly now
[1:08:14] revelation gives fate that's right
[1:08:16] revelation of what his word
[1:08:19] amen now what is god revealing
[1:08:21] what was locked up in his mind a long
[1:08:22] time ago isn't that right so revelation
[1:08:25] it means to reveal
[1:08:27] means to uncover i have this here or
[1:08:29] show something
[1:08:30] previously hidden
[1:08:32] amen to uncover
[1:08:33] to show it in the open
[1:08:35] to you
[1:08:36] praise god as an individual
[1:08:38] isn't that right
[1:08:39] the bible said uh no sorry the prophet
[1:08:41] said here and is this a sign at the end
[1:08:43] sir it says a mystery is scripture
[1:08:47] it's a previously hidden truth
[1:08:49] but now
[1:08:50] divinely reveal
[1:08:52] amen that's what it is
[1:08:56] sorry excuse me
[1:08:58] amen a scripture you read a scripture
[1:09:01] it's a word
[1:09:02] praise god but it only becomes the word
[1:09:04] to you
[1:09:05] when you could believe it by revelation
[1:09:07] isn't that right
[1:09:09] so it's nice to say god is a healer
[1:09:11] god is a deliverer
[1:09:13] god is a restore but unless that is
[1:09:16] revealed to you
[1:09:17] you can't really possess that you can't
[1:09:20] really walk in that
[1:09:22] you can't really anoint that to yourself
[1:09:25] that's just a word like floating like a
[1:09:26] weird cloud over sangri grande or
[1:09:28] something that's all that is to you
[1:09:30] but until revelation strikes
[1:09:33] that god wrote that word concerning you
[1:09:36] concerning your family he said you shall
[1:09:39] receive power you when you realize that
[1:09:42] god is speaking to you
[1:09:44] malachi 4 said behold i send unto you
[1:09:47] elijah the prophet you have to know that
[1:09:49] he is your prophet that god sent him to
[1:09:52] you
[1:09:53] to speak to you
[1:09:55] to anoint your faith hallelujah
[1:09:57] hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:10:00] god no you can claim it no you can say
[1:10:03] it's mine joy is mine peace is mine i
[1:10:06] claim it because i have revelation i
[1:10:08] have faith to claim what god has said
[1:10:13] and that's what we're here to do this
[1:10:15] morning not just to hear the word but to
[1:10:18] get into action and to begin to claim
[1:10:21] the promises of god for this day
[1:10:23] because if you don't claim it it'll just
[1:10:25] remain there on the shelf
[1:10:28] of your mind
[1:10:29] and you want and you'll take it for
[1:10:31] granted
[1:10:34] huh
[1:10:35] think about it
[1:10:37] huh
[1:10:39] think about it now it's really serious
[1:10:41] i think about so many years ago about a
[1:10:43] man who left that child in his car in
[1:10:45] the back seat you remember that story it
[1:10:47] was on the paper and he went to work
[1:10:50] and forgot the child in the back seat
[1:10:52] and the child died
[1:10:53] he had something more important
[1:10:56] to do
[1:10:57] then the child in the back seat
[1:10:59] and how many times how much things we
[1:11:01] leave in the backseat of our minds
[1:11:03] praise out that we don't do
[1:11:05] that we don't confront that we don't get
[1:11:07] done or we leave it in the back seat
[1:11:10] thinking somebody will take care of it
[1:11:12] you so caught up in the natural that you
[1:11:14] forget what god is doing
[1:11:16] but god is always moving
[1:11:18] you might not heal him you might see him
[1:11:21] but he is here this morning you better
[1:11:23] get desperate or it's gonna die in that
[1:11:26] backseat if you don't get next to
[1:11:28] yourself if you don't get desperate and
[1:11:31] seek god's face for the baptism of the
[1:11:33] holy ghost time is short
[1:11:37] [Applause]
[1:11:40] [Laughter]
[1:11:41] hallelujah
[1:11:43] time is short
[1:11:44] it's running out
[1:11:46] russia's getting ready to make their
[1:11:47] move
[1:11:48] you better make your move this morning
[1:11:51] and get desperate prophet said in russia
[1:11:53] go down there for that oil oh how do you
[1:11:55] better get ready the evening time is
[1:11:57] close at hand but god promised that in
[1:12:00] evening time there shall be light
[1:12:03] in the evening time oh god spoke to a
[1:12:07] prophet and said there shall be light
[1:12:10] and that's you and i this morning oh you
[1:12:12] are the light of the world god's getting
[1:12:14] ready to activate his kingdom in your
[1:12:17] heart and you are gonna be
[1:12:19] written epistles read of all men people
[1:12:23] are gonna take notes that you have been
[1:12:25] with jesus
[1:12:26] oh hallelujah by a manifestation of the
[1:12:29] holy ghost on fire missing limbs will be
[1:12:32] restored the sick is gonna be healed the
[1:12:35] blind is gonna see the will walk
[1:12:38] and the devil will be running out of the
[1:12:40] church when the gospel is preaching his
[1:12:42] power
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:48] oh hallelujah
[1:12:50] oh my
[1:12:51] when we see another ananias and sapphira
[1:12:55] huh
[1:12:56] god's gonna bring that kind of church
[1:12:57] back
[1:13:00] a move in power
[1:13:02] and then as you see god move your faith
[1:13:04] ought to rise
[1:13:06] in god
[1:13:07] as you see him move but abraham says on
[1:13:10] a platform and he's doing miracles he's

[1:18:00] that the lord has made

[1:18:20] the same thing through you
[1:18:21] outside of that the rest is not even
[1:18:23] called to it at all
[1:18:25] watch god's great revelation unfolding
[1:18:27] i'm getting ready to close out
[1:18:28] my lack of this revelation
[1:18:30] is why we have so many different
[1:18:31] divisions among us here's our divisions
[1:18:34] why for a lack of revelation and so much
[1:18:36] mockery and things so so much division
[1:18:38] among us is because the people lack that
[1:18:41] revelation
[1:18:42] see they lack that revelation the
[1:18:44] teachers
[1:18:45] isn't that right what's the bible say
[1:18:47] without a vision the people perish so
[1:18:50] god had to send a 20th century prophet
[1:18:52] to reveal to us what our promises were
[1:18:56] that is written in the book he said he
[1:18:58] is obligated god is obligated to meet
[1:19:01] you on the basis of them promises
[1:19:04] outside of them promises he can't meet
[1:19:06] you because you cut yourself off when
[1:19:09] you don't anoint those promises
[1:19:12] isn't that right
[1:19:14] one time the children of israel are
[1:19:15] crying up unto god and the bible said
[1:19:18] god heard their cries
[1:19:20] by reason of their affliction
[1:19:23] but it also said he remembered the
[1:19:25] covenant that he made with abraham that
[1:19:28] my people would churn in a strange land
[1:19:31] but with a mighty hand
[1:19:33] i would bring them out and when god
[1:19:36] remembered his promise he realized that
[1:19:39] he was obligated to hitch so when the
[1:19:42] people cry
[1:19:43] went up to god
[1:19:45] it shook god because something had to
[1:19:48] happen
[1:19:49] he was guilty of his promise until he
[1:19:52] brought it to pass
[1:19:54] oh
[1:19:56] and if god promised a revival here the
[1:19:58] prophet said we're going to have it make
[1:20:01] no mistake he said get ready for it
[1:20:04] there's something fixing to take place
[1:20:06] real soon i can do it for a fact he said
[1:20:09] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:20:12] oh i'm getting ready to close musicians
[1:20:14] get ready hallelujah hallelujah i'm
[1:20:17] about done
[1:20:19] amen
[1:20:20] my new ministry he said we're expecting
[1:20:22] i have a great inspect expectations this
[1:20:25] morning a great expectation at most any
[1:20:28] meeting i've ever been on because i
[1:20:30] believe we're just at the ease of
[1:20:32] something fixing to happen he said i've
[1:20:34] looked forward for it for a long time
[1:20:37] and i believe that we're right on the
[1:20:38] verge of it now for something that god
[1:20:41] is going to do to help his children
[1:20:44] a little further up the road how many
[1:20:47] want to get put up the road this morning
[1:20:49] he said you know the bible said that
[1:20:50] when the enemy coming like a flood the
[1:20:53] spirit of god would raise a standard
[1:20:56] against it
[1:20:57] oh hallelujah it's nara
[1:21:00] he raises a standard
[1:21:02] isn't that right no one take on the
[1:21:04] whole arm of god here's the prophet he
[1:21:06] said but god doesn't have to do anything
[1:21:08] more to his
[1:21:09] to make it any more appealing
[1:21:11] he doesn't have to do any more to his
[1:21:13] word the only thing he has to do is just
[1:21:16] raise up a standard of his own word and
[1:21:19] catch the enemy and when the bible said
[1:21:22] that when the enemy comes like a flood
[1:21:25] the spirit of god
[1:21:27] raises a standard against it the prophet
[1:21:30] said what does he do you begin to stand
[1:21:33] he said he takes that same word
[1:21:35] that he's already said
[1:21:38] that word is already spoken
[1:21:40] oh he said he filled it with the holy
[1:21:42] ghost he said he deliver you he said he
[1:21:44] restore you he said he baptized you he
[1:21:47] said he'll give you something what does
[1:21:49] he do he takes that same word
[1:21:52] that is already said and makes it more
[1:21:55] positive
[1:21:58] the prophet said
[1:21:59] and take his same word
[1:22:01] and just make it more positive
[1:22:04] oh
[1:22:05] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:08] hallelujah oh glory glory glory i'm
[1:22:12] about done you can begin to play
[1:22:13] something softly oh hallelujah do you
[1:22:16] know that god is fixing the move this
[1:22:18] morning that god is fixing the power of
[1:22:20] the holy ghost he promised to have a
[1:22:22] revival he said the pride hasn't had a
[1:22:24] revival yet it will take those seven
[1:22:26] unknown thunders to wake her up again
[1:22:29] he will send it he will promise it he's
[1:22:32] gonna speak to you direct and you're
[1:22:35] gonna see it and when you see him you

[1:22:55] out yonder now here it is you could
[1:22:57] touch it it's made flesh
[1:22:59] and when the enemy is still coming like
[1:23:00] a flood he poured the word into the
[1:23:02] person
