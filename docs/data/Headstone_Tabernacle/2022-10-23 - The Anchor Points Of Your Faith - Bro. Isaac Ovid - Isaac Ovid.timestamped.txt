[56:30] though he know them and be established
[56:33] in the present truth so Paul is saying
[56:36] here uh Peter rather is saying here that
[56:38] I will not be negligent I in other words
[56:41] I will make it my responsibility to put
[56:44] you always in remembrance of these
[56:46] things in other words I don't want you
[56:47] to forever forget it though you know
[56:49] them and be established in the present
[56:52] truth he said yeah I think it meets or I
[56:55] think it is fit as long as I am in this
[56:58] Tabernacle or this physical body to stir
[57:01] you up by putting you in remembrance
[57:04] because you're going to forget some
[57:06] things but I want to make sure that I
[57:09] remind you can the church say Amen
[57:11] knowing that shortly I must put off this
[57:14] my Tabernacle in other words shortly I
[57:16] must give up this flesh even as our Lord
[57:18] Jesus Christ had showed me moreover I
[57:21] will endeavor that ye may be able after
[57:24] my disease to have these things always
[57:27] in remembrance
[57:29] for we have not followed cunningly
[57:32] devised fables when we made known unto
[57:36] you the power and coming of our Lord
[57:39] Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of
[57:41] his majesty may the Lord add a blessing
[57:43] to the reading of his word you may be
[57:45] seated this morning in the presence of
[57:47] the Lord it's certainly a great
[57:48] privilege to be in the house of the Lord
[57:50] this morning
[57:52] Hallelujah are you happy to be in the
[57:54] house of the Lord
[57:55] happy to be in Fellowship on a Sunday
[57:58] morning in the presence of the Lord and
[57:59] under expectation for God to do
[58:02] something special for us I really want
[58:04] to appreciate the worship this service
[58:06] this the anointing the present this
[58:08] morning God bless you once again whether
[58:10] Anthony the musicians and I really want
[58:13] to salute right over it for the prayer
[58:15] meeting on Friday night you appreciate
[58:16] the service on Friday night
[58:19] I'll talk a bit more about that and then
[58:21] uh last Wednesday but Anthony my my my
[58:24] and there he wrestled you appreciate
[58:26] God's servants
[58:28] amen and last Sunday within every
[58:31] service God has been unfolding himself
[58:33] to us in a special way you know and uh
[58:36] after brother Anthony preached last
[58:38] Wednesday
[58:39] you know but always said I'm going to
[58:40] follow by the Anthony and he's pulled a
[58:43] tomb of frame of reference and he spoke
[58:46] about anchor points on Friday night and
[58:48] I was sitting there my mind was
[58:49] completely blown completely blown
[58:52] because I knew what the Lord was showing
[58:54] me and the road I was trying to go and I
[58:57] called him the next day I say that
[58:58] anchor points where you got that from no
[59:01] I know where I get it from but it just
[59:02] stirred me because I was into something
[59:04] about the place where something happened
[59:07] in your life that you could anchor so if
[59:09] you have a full back position and the
[59:11] devil back you up on a wall he can hold
[59:13] on to something and not move anymore but
[59:15] I was trying to find the right phrase to
[59:17] use to describe that spot and when he
[59:20] said anger point I say that's it the
[59:22] Anchor Point so for a title this morning
[59:24] the anchor points of your feet so I'm
[59:27] following straight after but over it's
[59:28] message the anchor points of your fate
[59:31] and my subject knowing what to forget
[59:34] and what to remember
[59:37] and as an inspiration spiritual amnesia
[59:40] it's important for us to know what to
[59:43] forget
[59:43] and we have to know what to remember
[59:45] there are some things God wants us to
[59:48] forget
[59:49] but there are also some things that God
[59:51] wants us to remember can the church say
[59:54] Amen when you come out of what you were
[59:56] in before God wants you to forget them
[59:58] always and those all things you say
[1:00:00] don't go back when you go to water
[1:00:02] baptism he said he could take the whole
[1:00:04] world but give me Jesus no turning back
[1:00:06] no turning back you're supposed to
[1:00:08] forget certain things but when you begin
[1:00:10] to walk along this journey you have to
[1:00:12] remember certain things and we read the
[1:00:14] scripture there from Peter saying I'm
[1:00:16] gonna make it my responsibility as long
[1:00:19] as I'm alive to remind you although you
[1:00:22] already know these things but I want to
[1:00:24] always put you in remembrance because
[1:00:26] you need to remember certain things it's
[1:00:28] critical for you to make it that you
[1:00:30] don't forget certain things can the
[1:00:32] Church Say Amen
[1:00:34] an anchor point an anchor point is a
[1:00:37] place that holds you Hallelujah and the
[1:00:40] last time I preached I spoke about
[1:00:41] finding faith in the midst of your storm
[1:00:44] Hallelujah this morning the Anchor Point
[1:00:46] of your feet and I'm going after that
[1:00:48] Faith because the whole Ministry of that
[1:00:50] Elijah Prophet was to turn our hearts
[1:00:53] back to the fate of the fathers can the
[1:00:55] church say amen and Jesus himself said
[1:00:58] when the son of man coming shall he find
[1:01:00] so you gotta find Faith you gotta be
[1:01:03] anchored in your faith your faith must
[1:01:05] be unshakable it must be unmovable
[1:01:07] nothing could distract you Hallelujah
[1:01:11] can the church say Amen Faith goes
[1:01:13] beyond your five physical senses so see
[1:01:16] taste start smell goes beyond that and
[1:01:19] even the senses of the spirit
[1:01:20] imagination reasoning those five Avenues
[1:01:24] into that sixth sense that Center the
[1:01:26] soul is either doubt or faith but we are
[1:01:29] here this morning by faith
[1:01:31] you came to church this morning by faith
[1:01:33] you are looking for your healing by
[1:01:35] faith your family is going to be
[1:01:37] delivered by faith you are going to be
[1:01:39] healed by faith you're going to receive
[1:01:42] the Holy Ghost by faith we're gonna have
[1:01:44] to have faith to go to the Rapture that
[1:01:46] kind of people call Rapture and Faith
[1:01:48] we're gonna have faith to move the power
[1:01:50] that keep it called perfect Faith but
[1:01:53] when the son of man cometh he shall find
[1:01:55] faith on the Earth
[1:01:58] can the church see amen oh hallelujah
[1:02:01] hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord a
[1:02:05] shout out praise this morning tomorrow
[1:02:07] is a public holiday so Tim lock off your
[1:02:09] seat belts take a make sure you take up
[1:02:12] your phone Hallelujah forget everything
[1:02:14] else and let's ride the anointing
[1:02:17] Hallelujah because we're gonna find the
[1:02:19] Anchor Point of your feet when the devil
[1:02:21] think you're gonna backslide you're
[1:02:23] gonna drop an anchor when the storm of
[1:02:26] light comes you drop an anchor and the
[1:02:28] anchor is going to hold and despite the
[1:02:31] storm
[1:02:32] Hallelujah when there's problems on your
[1:02:35] job your anchors got to hold in spite of
[1:02:38] the storm when the doctor report come
[1:02:41] negative your anchor has got to hold
[1:02:44] despite the storm can the church see
[1:02:47] amen thank you
[1:02:49] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:52] so I did a little research before I get
[1:02:54] into my texts I started to understand
[1:02:56] and we we may know it but why does a
[1:02:59] ship even need an anchor Hallelujah
[1:03:01] because if the winds come and the
[1:03:03] current come and in the middle of the
[1:03:05] storm where you can't move the ship you
[1:03:07] gotta drop an anchor at a hole and
[1:03:09] steady the ship
[1:03:10] but I found out the best ships don't
[1:03:12] have one anchor because one anchor may
[1:03:15] not be enough
[1:03:17] so at the minimum you have two anchors
[1:03:20] and the more important the cargo you
[1:03:22] even have three anchors you have an
[1:03:24] anchor just in case one of the two
[1:03:26] anchors that anchor the front and the
[1:03:28] back if something goes wrong nobody can
[1:03:30] bail you out so you walk with that extra
[1:03:32] anchor in case something goes wrong with
[1:03:34] the main anchors because you want to be
[1:03:37] so anchored that's not a good move you
[1:03:39] now when the storm coming Don't Drift
[1:03:41] somewhere and your ship don't wreck
[1:03:43] somewhere so you got to know where to
[1:03:45] drop the anchor know what your Anchor
[1:03:47] Point is can the Church Say Amen
[1:03:50] foreign
[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:03:59] but an anchor point is also a point
[1:04:02] where that is a foundation for you
[1:04:04] you're not gonna back down from there it
[1:04:06] gives you fit so your faith could be
[1:04:09] based on these anchor points can the
[1:04:11] church say amen and that's why I said
[1:04:13] this morning you got to know what to
[1:04:15] forget and what to remember there's some
[1:04:17] things that when you remember them it
[1:04:19] gives you faith it gives you
[1:04:21] encouragement so when I think of Jesus
[1:04:23] walking on the water that's an anchor
[1:04:25] point for me Hallelujah it shows me all
[1:04:27] things are possible Hallelujah when that
[1:04:30] woman had the oil and the meal and she
[1:04:32] was about to do her last meal and Elijah
[1:04:35] said pick me a cake first and she just
[1:04:38] opened it up and her food didn't run out
[1:04:40] that's an anchor point for my soul up
[1:04:42] that he is still able to take the
[1:04:45] impossible he could take the little I
[1:04:47] have when he took the 55 lows and the
[1:04:49] two fishes up and he fed all those
[1:04:51] people I can have little this morning
[1:04:53] but that's an anchor point my feet is
[1:04:56] resting on that anchor pointer you can
[1:04:59] distract me from my Anchor Point
[1:05:03] somebody say Amen
[1:05:04] and I don't want to forget it I can't
[1:05:07] afford to forget it you know the thing
[1:05:09] about the memory
[1:05:11] sometimes we forget important things and
[1:05:13] sometimes we remember the wrong things
[1:05:17] the devil's job is to bring back to your
[1:05:19] memory things to hold you down and to
[1:05:22] weigh you down and I so thank God we're
[1:05:24] going to get to it God remembers stuff
[1:05:26] but God also loves to forget stuff
[1:05:28] because you have a sea of forgetfulness
[1:05:31] specially designed to make sure he
[1:05:34] forgets certain things or you don't hear
[1:05:36] me this morning you got to know what to
[1:05:38] forget you got to know what to remember
[1:05:40] Paul said forget the things that are
[1:05:43] possible I want to forget my mistakes I
[1:05:46] wanna oh come on somebody help me this
[1:05:48] morning
[1:05:52] you may be seated
[1:05:54] so I started to discover by the Clarence
[1:05:56] some patterns in Scripture that blew my
[1:05:59] mind completely we know it's there but
[1:06:01] when you're looking at it it starts to
[1:06:03] jump out at you how God set up anchor
[1:06:06] points to have a spot to have a
[1:06:09] conversation with somebody so and and
[1:06:11] one of the things I was sharing
[1:06:12] Beethoven that one of the things as
[1:06:14] Believers we don't celebrate what God is
[1:06:16] doing enough in our lives
[1:06:20] let me say it one more time we don't
[1:06:23] celebrate the victories that God has
[1:06:25] done for us because every Victory you
[1:06:28] have is an anchor point the fact that he
[1:06:31] woke you up this morning is an anchor
[1:06:33] point the fact that oh you don't hear me
[1:06:35] this morning you know how many people
[1:06:37] told me they should have died could have
[1:06:39] died would have died every service you
[1:06:42] should be writing a note of Praise
[1:06:43] because every time the Lord does
[1:06:45] something for you it's an anchor point
[1:06:47] it could be big it could be small it
[1:06:49] could be for your son you may be seated
[1:06:53] last Sunday with a black man give me a
[1:06:55] testimony about his vehicle and I and I
[1:06:57] left saying you know what we supposed to
[1:06:59] be celebrating these things more because
[1:07:02] it's God doing something for us God
[1:07:04] inspiring people in our lives people on
[1:07:07] the streets people being pushed to do
[1:07:09] things they don't even know why they're
[1:07:11] doing it but it's because of you they're
[1:07:12] doing it they don't even understand why
[1:07:14] they open a door why they do this why
[1:07:17] they do that you that's why you have a
[1:07:19] reason to shout oh Hallelujah you have a
[1:07:23] reason to worship
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] every one of you have an anchor point
[1:07:28] the fact that you made it the service
[1:07:30] this morning is an anchor Point
[1:07:32] Hallelujah glory to God oh somebody give
[1:07:36] the Lord a shout of praise Hallelujah
[1:07:39] [Applause]
[1:07:42] but it's so easy to forget
[1:07:47] and under the pressure and the stress
[1:07:52] under the depression distress I remember
[1:07:53] one time I was traveling and I got to
[1:07:57] the U.S and I got into the immigration I
[1:07:59] got to the customer something had any
[1:08:01] bag and you know sometimes they randomly
[1:08:03] pull you over
[1:08:05] and say well what's in this and I look
[1:08:07] at the back and say I don't even know
[1:08:08] that bug
[1:08:11] because under the pressures like wait a
[1:08:12] minute but I actually forget about today
[1:08:14] you know because under pressure under
[1:08:17] stress you just forget certain things
[1:08:19] and Under Pressure some people just go
[1:08:21] to the bank and forget the PIN
[1:08:23] you go to the community forget your
[1:08:24] password
[1:08:27] all kind of things people going to exam
[1:08:29] and get exam Friday and they know they
[1:08:30] work you know you know much people tell
[1:08:32] me they know they work and I know they
[1:08:34] know they work but under depression they
[1:08:36] stress status it just comes to their
[1:08:37] mind it's not that it's not in their
[1:08:40] mind but under the pressure they forget
[1:08:41] so God through scripture I realize
[1:08:44] always reminding the people
[1:08:49] [Applause]
[1:08:51] Say Amen
[1:08:53] so when God is saying I am the god of
[1:08:55] Abraham
[1:08:57] I'm the god of Isaac I'm the god of
[1:08:59] Jacob he not seen it because he's just
[1:09:01] calling names you know each of those
[1:09:03] Patriarchs were anchor points
[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:06] Generations strongly line he says in I'm
[1:09:10] the god of Abraham I'm the god of Isaac
[1:09:12] I'm the god of Jacob most of the people
[1:09:15] who heard this never met Jacob or never
[1:09:18] met Isaac or never met Abraham but they
[1:09:21] knew the testimony in the life of
[1:09:23] Abraham they knew the testimony in the
[1:09:26] life of Isaac they know their testimony
[1:09:28] in the life of Jacob and God was using
[1:09:30] it as an anchor point to remind them
[1:09:33] that when Abraham couldn't have a son do
[1:09:36] you remember the story of how I walk up
[1:09:38] to Abraham and I turn his life around
[1:09:41] and said leave your country leave your
[1:09:43] family and come and follow me
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:09:52] to this day we are called children of
[1:09:55] Abraham so great was that Anchor Point
[1:09:58] that to this day we are still sons and
[1:10:00] Tall you don't hear me this morning
[1:10:03] [Applause]
[1:10:09] you may be seated
[1:10:10] anchor points that God put there so we
[1:10:13] can look back you remember when the god
[1:10:15] opened up the waters he said put 12
[1:10:17] Stones
[1:10:19] so that when your children I mean
[1:10:20] children's children and your children
[1:10:21] children pass by here they will remember
[1:10:27] open up the water
[1:10:29] it's morning
[1:10:31] to have anchor points so when your child
[1:10:33] in trouble he could look at the stone
[1:10:35] and say I wasn't here but I heard the
[1:10:37] story of if God could open up the water
[1:10:40] he can do it for me he did it before he
[1:10:43] could do it again he's the same
[1:10:45] yesterday today
[1:10:48] and forever
[1:10:51] Hallelujah somebody give the Lord a
[1:10:53] shout of praise
[1:10:54] hallelujah
[1:10:56] hallelujah shout like you had breakfast
[1:10:59] sound like you didn't have breakfast but
[1:11:01] get in the spirit of the Lord because we
[1:11:04] have enough anchor points to keep on
[1:11:07] pressing the battle I can't backslide I
[1:11:09] can't turn back I can't give up that
[1:11:12] come too far to turn back now I've seen
[1:11:15] too much I've seen too much
[1:11:21] thank you
[1:11:23] foreign
[1:11:24] [Applause]
[1:11:30] I hope this is helping somebody this
[1:11:31] morning
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:33] I want to go through some scriptures
[1:11:35] then we're going to touch some quotes
[1:11:41] Abraham was an anchor point but that was
[1:11:45] an individual
[1:11:47] God called out a man
[1:11:49] call Abraham
[1:11:51] and when he was finished dealing with
[1:11:52] Abraham the man and his house he dealt
[1:11:56] with his son Isaac
[1:11:58] and after that he dealt with Jacob and I
[1:12:01] started by the Anthony preached on last
[1:12:02] Wednesday but that was all individuals
[1:12:05] and that's why they are named as the
[1:12:06] Patriarchs the foundations of faith
[1:12:13] but after Jacob wrestled he became
[1:12:15] Israel
[1:12:17] and God switched from dealing with
[1:12:20] individuals
[1:12:21] to dealing with the group
[1:12:25] so we find out that when the children of
[1:12:28] Israel end up in bondage in Egypt
[1:12:31] that in Exodus 3 7 is the first time you
[1:12:35] could find the Bible reference my people
[1:12:40] because Exodus 3 7 and the Lord said I
[1:12:43] have surely seen the affection of
[1:12:45] my people
[1:12:48] which are in Egypt but I have heard
[1:12:50] their Cry by reason of their taskmasters
[1:12:53] for I know their sorrows
[1:12:57] so it was the first time God had the
[1:12:59] opportunity to interact with the people
[1:13:03] and the group in that kind of way beyond
[1:13:05] the Patriarchs themselves
[1:13:07] so throughout scripture
[1:13:10] apart from Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
[1:13:13] being individual anchor points that
[1:13:16] whole Egypt became a narrative that
[1:13:20] existed this day we could look and talk
[1:13:23] about how the Lord
[1:13:24] took us
[1:13:26] out of Egypt
[1:13:28] in Exodus 33
[1:13:31] and Moses said unto the people remember
[1:13:33] this day
[1:13:36] in which he came out from Egypt out of
[1:13:40] the house of bondage in other words I
[1:13:41] don't want to ever forget this
[1:13:43] for by strength of hand the Lord brought
[1:13:46] you out from this place can the church
[1:13:49] say Amen in numbers 15 we're going to
[1:13:52] take a little walk through the scripture
[1:13:53] because these are anchor points not just
[1:13:55] for the children of vegetables for us
[1:13:57] also numbers 15 37 and the Lord speak
[1:14:01] unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[1:14:04] chairman of Israel and listen bid that
[1:14:07] they make them fringes that's tassels in
[1:14:11] the borders of their garments so when
[1:14:13] you wonder why the Jews wore tassels
[1:14:15] this is why speak unto the children of
[1:14:18] Israel and beat them that they make them
[1:14:19] fringes in the borders of their garments
[1:14:22] throughout their generations and that
[1:14:25] they put upon The Fringe of the borders
[1:14:27] a ribbon of blue
[1:14:29] and it shall be unto you for our friends
[1:14:31] listen that he may look upon it and
[1:14:35] remember all the Commandments of the
[1:14:36] Lord and do them and that he seek not
[1:14:39] after your own heart and your own eyes
[1:14:42] after which she used to go a whoring
[1:14:45] that he may remember and do all my
[1:14:48] Commandments and be holy unto the Lord I
[1:14:51] am the Lord your God who has brought you
[1:14:54] out of the land of Egypt to be your God
[1:14:57] I am the Lord your God so God wasn't
[1:15:00] even the instruction to word only he
[1:15:04] said dress in such a way that when you
[1:15:08] look at your clothes in the mirror you
[1:15:10] will remember that I brought you out of
[1:15:12] Egypt I want you to dress in such oh you
[1:15:15] don't hear me this morning I want you to
[1:15:17] dress that when you look in the mirror
[1:15:19] you will remember my Commandments are

[1:15:30] their young sisters
[1:15:31] [Applause]
[1:15:35] to keep you in the way
[1:15:40] in other words God gave them actual way
[1:15:42] to remind themselves
[1:15:44] because in the peace of life you get so
[1:15:46] busy sometimes he said put it on your
[1:15:48] clothes so when you're about to do
[1:15:50] something and you look at it you you
[1:15:52] pack yourself and say listen this
[1:15:54] tussle is not here for decoration no
[1:15:56] it's not it seems just put it here
[1:15:58] though the tailor put it here because
[1:15:59] it's in style this is to remind me that
[1:16:02] that I could have been dead but I'm
[1:16:04] alive this is to remind me that there's
[1:16:07] a Commandment that I have to follow

[1:30:13] I'm still in Deuteronomy still here
[1:30:16] brother Nicolas thank you so much let's
[1:30:18] go back to verse 8. he says not because
[1:30:20] it was bigger he was handsome he was no
[1:30:24] but because the Lord loved you and
[1:30:28] because he would keep the oath which he
[1:30:31] sworn unto your fathers all the way back
[1:30:34] to the first patriarch Father Abraham
[1:30:36] had the Lord brought you out with a
[1:30:38] mighty hand look how God reminded him
[1:30:40] again and redeem you out of the house of
[1:30:42] bond men from behind the Pharaoh king of
[1:30:45] Egypt
[1:30:46] foreign
[1:30:47] no therefore
[1:30:49] that the Lord thy God he is God
[1:30:52] the faithful God
[1:30:54] which keepeth Covenant and mercy with
[1:30:57] them that love him and keep his
[1:30:59] Commandments to a thousand Generations
[1:31:04] young people
[1:31:06] this world is changing but God does not
[1:31:08] change the wages of sin is still death
[1:31:12] and there's still a Rapture and a heaven
[1:31:15] to fight for for a thousand Generations
[1:31:18] there will be those who keep his
[1:31:21] covenants keep his Commandments
[1:31:25] listen to verse 10. and repaired them
[1:31:28] that hate him to their face
[1:31:33] to destroy them he will not be slacked
[1:31:37] to him that hated him
[1:31:38] so in other words God will deal with
[1:31:42] people who come against this word you
[1:31:44] have nothing to do don't worry about it
[1:31:47] the Bible is in God is Not slack he's
[1:31:49] not delinquent to dealing with those who
[1:31:52] come against him
[1:31:54] he will not be slacked to him that hated
[1:31:57] him he'll repay him to his face Thou
[1:31:59] shalt therefore this is your
[1:32:01] responsibility keep the Commandments
[1:32:04] and the statutes and the judgments which

[1:33:56] [Applause]
[1:33:58] is this happen to anybody this morning
[1:34:00] [Applause]
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:04] just a few more scriptures
[1:34:08] Deuteronomy 8.
[1:34:11] verse 2.
[1:34:13] and thou shalt remember
[1:34:16] all the way
[1:34:18] which the Lord
[1:34:20] thy God LED you these 40 years in the
[1:34:23] wilderness
[1:34:26] listen why
[1:34:28] you remember talk about it the people
[1:34:30] who bear in bucket and then they get
[1:34:31] shower and they don't want to
[1:34:33] he said to humblebee
[1:34:38] in other words the people came out of
[1:34:40] Egypt but the sense of Pride you know
[1:34:43] so he sent them to the Wilderness for 40
[1:34:46] years to Humble them
[1:34:48] and to prove thee so all these years
[1:34:51] since the prophet left it was the humble
[1:34:54] people who got conceited with some books
[1:34:56] and tips
[1:34:58] and to prove me to know what was in
[1:35:01] thine heart not what you're saying with
[1:35:04] your mouth
[1:35:05] but what in your heart whether thou
[1:35:08] would keep his Commandments or no
[1:35:12] you see all God is interested in his
[1:35:13] Commandments you know
[1:35:16] that's why he said follow obedience to
[1:35:19] the entire world
[1:35:21] entitles you to the token
[1:35:27] could he take someone
[1:35:33] because we would not we wouldn't finish
[1:35:36] I'm on page 12 of 62.
[1:35:39] somebody say oh my
[1:35:43] I will come out of Deuteronomy and just
[1:35:45] show you
[1:35:47] because the problem throughout history
[1:35:49] and through scripture is when things get
[1:35:52] bad people remember the Lord
[1:35:54] and when things get normalized they
[1:35:56] forget you Lord
[1:36:00] why God have to put in your back way to
[1:36:02] come back to church
[1:36:04] you leave church walking or you come
[1:36:06] back on a wheelchair
[1:36:08] pray for me
[1:36:15] judges 6 6.
[1:36:17] and Israel was greatly impoverished
[1:36:19] because of the media9 this is how Gideon
[1:36:21] was activated
[1:36:22] and the children of Israel cried to the
[1:36:24] Lord
[1:36:26] no they was Bachelor no no
[1:36:28] and it's because God sent them in a
[1:36:31] nicer deal with them
[1:36:33] but the children were greatly
[1:36:35] impoverished because of the millions of
[1:36:37] cried out and it came to pass when the
[1:36:39] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:36:41] because of the midianites that the Lord
[1:36:43] sent the prophet
[1:36:45] you see why I can't get around God
[1:36:47] setting a prophet the law sent a prophet
[1:36:50] under the children of Israel with seven
[1:36:51] to them thus said the Lord God of Israel
[1:36:54] I brought you up from Egypt that's how
[1:36:56] we start the message
[1:36:58] back to the Anchor Point of Egypt
[1:37:01] and brought you forth out of the house
[1:37:03] of bondage and I deliver you out of the
[1:37:05] hand of the Egyptians and out of the
[1:37:08] hand of Allah to oppress you and drave
[1:37:10] them out before you and gave you their
[1:37:13] land
[1:37:15] and I said unto you I am the Lord your
[1:37:17] God fear not the gods of the amorites in
[1:37:20] whose land he dwell but ye have not
[1:37:23] obeyed my voice
[1:37:25] that way the angel came to pre-double
[1:37:27] that's what the angel came to sit that's
[1:37:28] what he Prophet came to say
[1:37:31] and that's how Kieran was activated and
[1:37:33] and when you go further and read about
[1:37:35] Gideon Gideon say where all the Miracles
[1:37:37] the father's talking about taking us out
[1:37:39] of Egypt that's that's Gideon away he
[1:37:41] keep going back to the Anchor Point
[1:37:44] where the Miracles I hear about Egypt
[1:37:47] but where's my miracle
[1:37:50] but to show you but upon your cycle over
[1:37:52] and over by judges eight
[1:37:55] verse 33 and it came to pass as soon as
[1:37:58] Gideon was dead that the children
[1:38:00] adventure turned again and went a
[1:38:03] whoring with Balaam and made Bal buried
[1:38:05] their God
[1:38:07] and the tuna fish are remembered not the
[1:38:10] Lord their God
[1:38:13] so is God a god of convenience to you
[1:38:16] because that's what it was the remnant
[1:38:17] when things get bad call upon God
[1:38:20] I want to take a normal well well we
[1:38:22] could go back
[1:38:24] over and over
[1:38:29] can you take some more
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:35] it saw many scriptures I want to try to
[1:38:38] cut it short here but Nehemiah though
[1:38:42] even though all adult even though as
[1:38:44] Lord alone thou has made Heaven the
[1:38:47] heaven of Heavens with all their hosts
[1:38:48] the Earth and all things that are there
[1:38:50] in the seas and all that they're in and
[1:38:51] they are preserving them all and the
[1:38:53] hosts of Heaven worship with thee that
[1:38:55] why the Lord and he goes on and on and
[1:38:57] on and on
[1:38:58] until the city Affliction of our fathers
[1:39:01] in Egypt are they showing you how true
[1:39:02] scripture they keep going back to the
[1:39:05] Anchor Point
[1:39:10] Psalm 78
[1:39:15] how often they provoke him in the
[1:39:18] wilderness and grieve him in the desert
[1:39:20] yeah they turned back and tempted God
[1:39:22] and limited the Holy One of Israel and
[1:39:25] remembered not his hand
[1:39:28] so I want you to see truly problems
[1:39:29] because I want to know how you end up in
[1:39:32] about how you end up in a party did you
[1:39:34] remember the Lord when he was walking in
[1:39:37] oh you end up in that dress how you end
[1:39:38] up wearing that or you end up in that
[1:39:39] position
[1:39:42] because it could not be remembering you
[1:39:44] Lord when he picked the outfit
[1:39:47] when they take the money out to your
[1:39:49] purse with the car to make you purchase
[1:39:51] the way you remember any Lord
[1:39:54] when your holy drink will you remember
[1:39:57] me look because I can guarantee you if
[1:39:59] you remember me Lord you're saying no no
[1:40:00] no no
[1:40:03] when he was with that woman that boy
[1:40:04] that girl whatever it is were you
[1:40:06] remembering the Lord when they chose to
[1:40:08] not come to church to do something that
[1:40:10] that was that was different
[1:40:12] will you remember any Lord
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:20] and God keep taking them back to their
[1:40:22] Anchor Point
[1:40:25] Church what is your Anchor Point
[1:40:27] what what is holding you what what is
[1:40:30] reminding you to keep pressing the
[1:40:31] battle
[1:40:34] Isaiah 46 I shouldn't choose scripture
[1:40:36] remember this and show yourselves men
[1:40:41] you want to be a man show me a man bring
[1:40:43] it again to mind in other words remember
[1:40:45] oh you transgressors
[1:40:49] remember the former things of all what
[1:40:52] I've done for you for I am God and there
[1:40:54] is none else I am God and there is none
[1:40:56] like me
[1:40:57] declaring the end from the beginning and
[1:41:00] from the ancient times the things that
[1:41:02] are not yet done seeing my counsel shall
[1:41:04] stand and I will do all my pleasure
[1:41:08] throughout scripture God crying to get
[1:41:10] the attention of his people in every
[1:41:13] generation
[1:41:14] and the same cry is on today the same
[1:41:18] way Peter cried out he said I know you
[1:41:20] know these things but I want to put you
[1:41:22] in remembrance
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:25] all right
[1:41:29] I'm almost finished this section
[1:41:32] Jeremiah 18 15 the last one
[1:41:36] because
[1:41:38] my people had forgotten me
[1:41:42] you know what does it do something for
[1:41:44] somebody and they just forget you
[1:41:46] ungrateful
[1:41:49] I know I can imagine feels
[1:41:52] when they do something for your child
[1:41:53] and you held them and then you feel like
[1:41:55] they even use it good they did his waste
[1:41:57] and they do what they want to do they it
[1:41:59] doesn't feel a certain kind of way
[1:42:01] when are you sacrificing and put your
[1:42:03] effort to do certain things
[1:42:06] all the parents I know
[1:42:08] except the reprobates always do their
[1:42:11] best
[1:42:14] they may not do all they need to know
[1:42:15] but they do their best with what they
[1:42:17] know
[1:42:19] that's why the Bible say honor your
[1:42:21] father and your mother
[1:42:23] that the days may be long
[1:42:26] because they're doing their best
[1:42:32] and then children want to walk around
[1:42:34] and
[1:42:37] it's really experts you know the other
[1:42:39] day my daughter is three years old

[1:43:02] so I said to her you're not listening to
[1:43:04] me she said you're not listening to me
[1:43:11] and I can imagine we as natural parents
[1:43:14] go through this because they're trying
[1:43:16] to discover themselves
[1:43:18] but yet still we do all we could do
[1:43:21] because we want to see them smile we
[1:43:24] want to see them happy we want to give
[1:43:25] any best chance to survive and to
[1:43:28] succeed and to make it because this is
[1:43:30] our evil horrible world we want to give
[1:43:33] them every Advantage we could
[1:43:36] because if you're not prepared for life
[1:43:37] life will eat you up

[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:45:57] this helping anybody this morning
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:07] just wrapping up Jeremiah 18 15 because
[1:46:09] my people had forgotten me
[1:46:13] they have burned incense to vanity
[1:46:16] and they have caused them to stumble in
[1:46:18] their ways from the ancient parts
[1:46:23] to walk in Parts in a way and not cast
[1:46:26] up in other words they're making their
[1:46:27] own track
[1:46:29] having a form of godliness
[1:46:32] but deny any power that's what it is
[1:46:35] anybody feeling fine this morning
[1:46:38] could you take some more
[1:46:40] that is the introduction
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:43] I'm on page 20 so we
[1:46:47] we're making progress
[1:46:51] so we talk a lot about what to remember
[1:46:53] and how much God wants to be remembered
[1:46:56] and I found myself more and more
[1:46:58] as I get older
[1:47:02] I recognize I am but Clarence laughing I
[1:47:06] am becoming Allah I'm not trying to
[1:47:07] clean my ownership but
[1:47:13] but I'm becoming more understanding of
[1:47:16] the importance of memories
[1:47:22] and how important to remember the right
[1:47:24] thing
[1:47:26] because as they get older
[1:47:28] and you're unable to do certain things
[1:47:31] and operated in ways what you are left
[1:47:33] with is memories
[1:47:36] memories of what he could share that's
[1:47:38] why it is so important that you sit with
[1:47:40] the elders
[1:47:42] and you have respect for those who have
[1:47:43] walked a certain road before
[1:47:46] they can share certain things they may
[1:47:49] not be able to run around and do what
[1:47:50] you could do but they have memories that
[1:47:52] are precious memories
[1:47:59] Hallelujah
[1:48:02] so I think and Paul in Philippians 3 13
[1:48:05] says Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:48:08] apprehended
[1:48:09] but there's one thing I do forgetting
[1:48:11] those things which are behind
[1:48:13] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:48:15] with her before I press towards the mark
[1:48:18] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:48:20] in Christ Jesus
[1:48:24] friends there's so much information this
[1:48:26] information age
[1:48:28] that it's tough to remember everything
[1:48:32] but in all of your doing remember the
[1:48:35] Lord
[1:48:38] we are challenged no more than ever to
[1:48:41] have more all levels more a levels more
[1:48:43] degrees more qualifications more this
[1:48:45] more than that but in all of your
[1:48:47] remembering
[1:48:49] remember the
[1:48:54] things and you have to choose to forget
[1:48:56] certain things like Paul
[1:48:58] I've said it to the young people many
[1:49:00] times
[1:49:01] and young people here and those
[1:49:03] connected to the internet you have to
[1:49:04] forget certain friends
[1:49:07] yeah forget you have to forget certain
[1:49:08] phone numbers
[1:49:09] you have to forget certain people
[1:49:12] they're not going where you're going
[1:49:14] [Applause]
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:20] and remember the Lord
[1:49:26] in broken systems but Abraham said all
[1:49:29] the learning he had as Paul he had to
[1:49:31] forget all he knowed in order to find
[1:49:33] Christ
[1:49:38] in a message once more but Abraham said
[1:49:40] if there could only be the objective of
[1:49:43] the Pentecostal move tonight I'm willing
[1:49:45] to forget about whether I'm this way or
[1:49:47] one is Tunis trainings I'm going to

[1:50:51] it one small Lord once more
[1:50:54] and they stood that big Hulk of a frame
[1:50:57] talking about Samson powerless and
[1:51:00] helpless all at once he began to feel
[1:51:03] something happening every Vibe of his

[2:11:32] all these anchor points are my anchor
[2:11:34] points and I can have faith to keep on
[2:11:37] pressing Faith to keep on fighting Faith
[2:11:40] to Keep On Believing
[2:11:42] I was with Moses when he crossed the Red
[2:11:45] Sea when he raised his hand and walked
[2:11:48] forward and the Red Sea opened I was
[2:11:51] identified in Christ right then I was
[2:11:54] with Moses at that hour oh Hallelujah
[2:11:57] but Abraham said whatever Christians has
[2:12:00] been whatever Believers has been every
[2:12:03] believer now is identified with that
[2:12:06] same person whatever it is you must be
[2:12:09] identified don't forget that when you do
[2:12:12] when you forget it you've got spiritual
[2:12:14] Amnesia you have forgotten who you are
[2:12:17] now identified with him I was with
[2:12:20] Elijah in the days of ihaba when they
[2:12:22] had to make a choice who they would
[2:12:25] serve God or belam we was with him on
[2:12:28] Mount Carmel that's my Anchor Point when
[2:12:30] he had to make this choice and today we
[2:12:33] have to make another choice will we
[2:12:35] serve God or will we go back to the
[2:12:37] world we'll remember the Lord or will we
[2:12:40] forget the world for we are identified
[2:12:42] data in the body of the same God that he
[2:12:45] was identified in oh hallelujah
[2:12:48] hallelujah
[2:12:51] I was with David when he was with
[2:12:54] Richard by his Brethren I was with David
[2:12:56] you were too if you are a Christian you
[2:12:59] have to be identified with his rejection
[2:13:02] I was with the Hebrew children in the
[2:13:05] fiery furnace so I could handle fire I
[2:13:07] could handle it I could handle it you
[2:13:10] could handle it too it's an anchor point
[2:13:12] [Music]
[2:13:14] come on Church come on elders come on
[2:13:17] deacons come on parents come on young
[2:13:20] people the fire couldn't burn them
[2:13:22] because of the presence of the fourth
[2:13:24] Manor I was with Daniela in the Lion's
[2:13:27] Den I was identified in there when the
[2:13:30] angel of the Lord identified him and
[2:13:33] there I was more surely with him at
[2:13:35] Calvary I must be identified with him at
[2:13:38] Calvary I must be there to a place that
[2:13:42] we're not us was I'm identified with him
[2:13:44] at Calvary I died with him at Calvary
[2:13:46] every Christian must die with him at
[2:13:49] Calvary if you don't die with him on
[2:13:52] Calvary you can't be none of his I was
[2:13:55] there when he died I died with him and
[2:13:58] then I was with him when he raised from
[2:13:59] the dead I come up on Easter morning
[2:14:01] with him in the resurrection whatever he
[2:14:04] did I was right there with him every
[2:14:06] believer every believer do we have
[2:14:09] Believers in the house this morning do
[2:14:11] we are believers in the church this
[2:14:13] morning I you identified do you know
[2:14:16] your anchor points
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:27] I was with him on a day of Pentecost I
[2:14:30] was with the disciples that they
[2:14:31] identified with them in the baptism of
[2:14:34] the Holy Ghost
[2:14:36] [Music]
[2:14:40] I wonder if the church hasn't got
[2:14:41] amnesia
[2:14:44] so much now that they don't some of them
[2:14:46] don't even believe there's such a thing
[2:14:48] as the Holy Ghost
[2:14:49] see why the church has got a very bad
[2:14:51] case of amnesia they have forgotten that
[2:14:55] was Jesus Christ back there they have
[2:14:57] forgotten what Jesus Christ was they
[2:14:59] have forgotten they thought he was just
[2:15:01] a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man
[2:15:04] they forgot that he was God they forgot
[2:15:07] that he's the same yesterday today and
[2:15:10] forever I'm whining down and the church
[2:15:12] has got a bad case of spiritual Amnesia
[2:15:15] they have forgotten all these things
[2:15:17] they don't understand it no more
[2:15:20] foreign
[2:15:25] on the day of Pentecost I heard what he
[2:15:29] said I believe what he said I obeyed
[2:15:31] what he said now I'm identified in the
[2:15:34] same thing don't get spiritual Amnesia
[2:15:36] don't forget the always ask the elders
[2:15:40] about it it's the same Holy Ghost the
[2:15:43] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[2:15:44] real today as it was in the day of
[2:15:47] Pentecost don't get spiritual Amnesia
[2:15:49] don't get comfortable don't just come to
[2:15:52] church to come to church we want a real
[2:15:54] experience it's real maybe you forgot
[2:15:57] what it felt like up but today May today
[2:16:00] be a new anchor point for you may today
[2:16:03] be a reminder of how good God is and how
[2:16:06] his promise is real
[2:16:09] foreign
[2:16:12] [Applause]
[2:16:14] because you will identify yourself with
[2:16:17] something else and that's what's
[2:16:19] happening all around the world happening
[2:16:20] in the message people have spiritual
[2:16:22] Amnesia and now Associated doctrines and
[2:16:25] teaching that so far removed from
[2:16:27] reality
[2:16:28] because they don't know who they are
[2:16:32] we was with the church when it was
[2:16:35] commissioned by Jesus Christ going into
[2:16:37] all the world and preach the gospel to
[2:16:39] Every Creature are you testifying to
[2:16:42] anybody
[2:16:44] you know everybody's a preacher you may
[2:16:47] not preach on the pulpits but you peace
[2:16:48] with your life your life is a sermon
[2:16:52] if you're a Christian you have to be
[2:16:53] doing this you know
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:57] but everybody preached last Sunday a
[2:16:59] candle cubby hid
[2:17:02] but put it on top of the hill
[2:17:09] if you don't believe it then you have
[2:17:10] spiritual amnesia
[2:17:12] and you've forgotten the Lord
[2:17:16] you must be identified with Saint John
[2:17:18] 14 12 he that believeth with me the
[2:17:20] words that I do shall you also don't
[2:17:21] forget it if you do you've got spiritual
[2:17:23] amnesia
[2:17:25] you have forgotten what your testimony
[2:17:27] means
[2:17:29] you can't tell where you belong
[2:17:32] all you remains are Methodist I'm
[2:17:34] Baptist that's what I know about it I'm
[2:17:35] pentecostalam they said I'd watch out
[2:17:37] that may mean that the disease sign is
[2:17:39] showing on you that you've got some
[2:17:40] spiritual amnesia
[2:17:43] is all I can talk about is a group you
[2:17:45] belong to you have symptoms
[2:17:48] oh special amnesia
[2:17:51] because
[2:17:53] we're talking about the promises of God
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:00] if you don't believe the sick could be
[2:18:02] healed you've got spiritual amnesia
[2:18:04] if you don't believe the party I'm
[2:18:05] reading a prophet if I don't he say you
[2:18:07] say I don't believe in a baptism of the
[2:18:09] Holy Ghost spiritual amnesia
[2:18:13] I don't believe that God promised to do
[2:18:14] these things in the last days then you
[2:18:16] have listened to a Creed or some
[2:18:17] Doctrine instead of the Bible you have a
[2:18:18] spiritual Amnesia you don't know where
[2:18:20] you belong
[2:18:22] Hallelujah
[2:18:26] that's the matter with the church today
[2:18:28] and that's the matter we kind of
[2:18:30] revivals doesn't matter with the people
[2:18:31] today this is 1964. they've been so drug
[2:18:34] over cause of everything and every ISM
[2:18:37] they can hatch up till they don't know
[2:18:38] what is right and wrong
[2:18:40] she can't remember the promise
[2:18:43] that's why you got to keep pleading the
[2:18:44] promise that's why Peter was saying I
[2:18:46] want to bring it back to your
[2:18:48] remembrance even though you know it that
[2:18:50] you're gonna be established in the
[2:18:51] present truth
[2:18:54] he said that what's the matter with
[2:18:55] Israel when Jesus come to the scene he
[2:18:57] said listen to this they could not
[2:18:59] remember Virgin supposed to conceive
[2:19:03] they could not remember that Moses said
[2:19:05] the Lord will raise up a prophet like
[2:19:07] unto me they had spiritual amnesia
[2:19:12] oh Hallelujah musicians can be gonna
[2:19:14] play something
[2:19:19] [Music]
[2:19:29] there's no scripture that says remember
[2:19:31] Moses
[2:19:32] remember David remember Joshua Samson
[2:19:34] died and I've preaches before many times
[2:19:36] but the Bible says remember that's why
[2:19:38] Jesus said that
[2:19:44] that's the one character the main
[2:19:47] character that just remember Lord's wife
[2:19:50] remember David he can actually remember
[2:19:52] Abraham
[2:19:56] you say you remember Lord's wife
[2:20:01] we don't have no name for her but we are
[2:20:02] commanded to remember her
[2:20:04] wife
[2:20:09] when I preached it before I said he
[2:20:10] could forget how to do algebra you could
[2:20:13] forget how to do literature you forget
[2:20:15] how to do history but whatever you do
[2:20:17] remember Lot's wife
[2:20:21] because she had an opportunity
[2:20:25] to forget her past
[2:20:29] and to remember what the Lord had done
[2:20:31] to take them out
[2:20:34] but she could not separate
[2:20:36] the promise of God
[2:20:39] from her past
[2:20:41] and she found herself
[2:20:43] looking back
[2:20:45] to where she come from I want to warn
[2:20:48] you and challenge you today
[2:20:50] Church
[2:20:51] young people parents
[2:20:55] don't look back
[2:20:59] let today be a day where you forget the
[2:21:01] world forget the past forget your whole
[2:21:03] life
[2:21:04] and you remember the Lord in a way you
[2:21:07] have never done before
[2:21:09] make him the center of your life
[2:21:13] I find myself guilty of not remembering
[2:21:16] him enough
[2:21:19] it's a consciousness
[2:21:22] of putting God first
[2:21:25] in every decision
[2:21:28] we take so much in ourselves that we
[2:21:30] want to decide for ourselves what we
[2:21:31] want to do but it's a real Consciousness
[2:21:34] to remember the Lord
[2:21:40] we learn to depend on our support system
[2:21:44] our family our jobs our salaries or the
[2:21:47] church whatever it is
[2:21:49] and the Lord is nowhere
[2:21:51] as he sends a point you know
[2:21:56] are you suffering from spiritual amnesia
[2:22:00] are you guilty because I know I'm I'm
[2:22:01] guilty
[2:22:05] he wants our all
[2:22:07] he wants a hundred percent
[2:22:11] imagine God find himself through
[2:22:13] scripture pleading with the people
[2:22:15] don't forget me
[2:22:18] remember what I did for you well last
[2:22:20] have you said Lord already thank you for
[2:22:23] what you did 10 years ago
[2:22:26] we live life not even looking back and
[2:22:29] saying oh God I even thank you enough
[2:22:35] in the story of Esther
[2:22:38] you remember when the king couldn't
[2:22:40] sleep
[2:22:42] he said read for me
[2:22:44] the Chronicles
[2:22:46] maybe that'll put me to sleep
[2:22:49] this was the records of all the memories
[2:22:54] and he's read and they're reading and
[2:22:55] they say wait a minute
[2:22:57] read that again for me
[2:22:59] I forget about that
[2:23:01] when Mordecai warned me of what he's
[2:23:05] been I didn't remember it
[2:23:07] what did we do
[2:23:09] for him
[2:23:12] because no good thing
[2:23:15] should go unrewarded
[2:23:17] [Music]
[2:23:18] everything you do for the Lord comes
[2:23:21] with a reward a blessing
[2:23:23] because God doesn't forget
[2:23:24] [Applause]
[2:23:28] but we forget so much
[2:23:31] we let our stresses in our lives get to
[2:23:34] us and then we live sometimes grumpy how
[2:23:37] could you be a sad Christian
[2:23:38] [Music]
[2:23:40] can't you find a reason to smile
[2:23:44] I don't care if it was 30 years ago
[2:23:47] Lord I Thank you
[2:23:49] for just taking me out of that situation
