[19:45] Amen. Do you love him? Praise God. It's
[19:48] good to be in his house this morning.
[19:51] Let's turn to our Bibles. Welcome to the
[19:53] house of the Lord. Psalm chapter 98 for
[19:57] a scripture reading. Praise God.
[20:04] Amen.
[20:08] Psalm chapter
[20:11] 98
[20:14] from verse one says, "Oh, sing unto the
[20:17] Lord a new song, for he hath done
[20:21] marvelous things. His right hand and his
[20:25] holy arm hath gotten him the victory.
[20:29] The Lord hath made known his salvation.
[20:31] His righteousness hath he openly showed
[20:35] in the h in the sight of the heathen. He
[20:37] hath remembered his mercy and his truth
[20:41] towards the house of Israel.
[20:43] All the ends of the earth have seen the
[20:46] salvation of our God. Make a joyful
[20:50] noise unto the Lord. All the earth make
[20:53] a loud noise and rejoice and sing
[20:57] praise.
[20:58] Sing unto the Lord with the harp, with
[21:01] the harp and the voice of a psalm, with
[21:04] trumpets and sound of cornet make a
[21:07] joyful noise before the Lord the King.
[21:11] Let the sea roar and the fullness
[21:13] thereof, the world and they that dwell
[21:17] therein, and let the floods clap their
[21:20] hands. Let the hills be joyful together
[21:24] before the Lord, for he cometh to judge
[21:27] the earth with righteousness. Shall he
[21:30] judge the world and the people with
[21:33] equity? May God and his blessings for
[21:36] the word of God. Let's bow our heads as
[21:39] we pray. Ask God's blessings this
[21:41] morning. Almighty God, we thank you to
[21:44] be in your house this morning, Lord
[21:46] Jesus. There's no other place we'd
[21:48] rather be, Lord, than in your presence,
[21:51] Father. No other thing can satisfy, Lord
[21:55] God. The longing heart and the thirsting
[21:58] soul, oh God, Father, but what we want
[22:01] more is more of you this morning, Lord.
[22:04] So, Father, would you come by here as we
[22:07] sing and enter into this place of
[22:08] worship, Lord? Won't you meet us here,
[22:11] oh God, as we offer our sacrifice this
[22:15] morning? Lord, we pray your presence
[22:17] would come down, Lord Jesus. And Lord,
[22:19] may you anoint us and inspire us, Lord.
[22:22] And we pray that you'll bless your
[22:23] servant, Lord, as he heals himself to be
[22:26] used by you, Lord Jesus. We pray that
[22:28] your presence would come down and
[22:30] minister to our hearts, Lord. Use Lord
[22:34] Father your servant Lord to speak to us
[22:37] in a mighty way as we are in expectation

[40:50] you would send that consuming fire of

[41:18] Amen.
[41:20] We're going to turn our Bibles to
[41:21] Matthew chapter 8. We're going to read
[41:24] from verse 5-13. Hebrews 4 verse 1 verse
[41:27] verse 12. God bless you and welcome to
[41:29] our Sunday morning service. I pray that
[41:32] God be with your hearts
[41:36] this morning. You know the Bible talk
[41:38] about the word was preached to so many
[41:40] of them but many didn't allow that word
[41:43] to be mixed with faith.
[41:45] So I trust in that you allow that word
[41:48] to sink in today.
[41:51] Reading from Matthew chapter 8 want to
[41:56] read verse 5. Now when Jesus was entered
[41:59] into Capernaum, there came unto him a
[42:01] centurion beseeching him, saying,
[42:06] Lord, my servant lith at home sick of
[42:08] the paly, grievously tormented.
[42:12] And Jesus saith unto him, I will come
[42:14] and heal him. The centurion answered and
[42:17] said,"Lord, I am not worthy that thou
[42:20] shouldest come under my roof, but speak
[42:24] the word only, and my servant shall be
[42:27] healed."
[42:28] For I am a man under authority, having
[42:31] soldiers under me. And I say to this
[42:34] man, "Go," and he goeth. I say another,
[42:36] "Come," and he cometh. Unto my servant,
[42:38] do this, and he doeth it.
[42:40] When Jesus heard it, he marveled,
[42:44] said unto them that followed, verily I
[42:46] say unto you, I have not found so great
[42:49] faith, know not in Israel. And I say
[42:52] unto you, that many shall come from the
[42:54] east and west, and shall sit down with
[42:55] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
[42:57] kingdom of heaven. But the children of
[42:59] the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
[43:01] darkness. They shall be weeping and
[43:04] nashing of teeth. And Jesus said unto
[43:06] the centurion, "Go thy way, as thou hast
[43:09] believed, so it be it done unto thee."
[43:12] And the servant was healed in the
[43:15] self-same hour. Our last scripture is
[43:17] from Hebrews 4 verse 12.
[43:23] For the word is of God is quick and
[43:26] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[43:29] sword, piercing even to the dividing
[43:32] asunder of soul and spirit and of joints
[43:36] and marrows and in the discern of the
[43:38] thoughts and intents of the heart. Let's
[43:40] pray. Father, we thank you for this time
[43:44] and what a battle to get to this spot,
[43:45] but we are here. We pray the angel will
[43:48] come forward
[43:49] and be with us in Jesus name I ask.
[43:51] Amen. You may be seated. Oh, praise the
[43:54] Lord.
[43:57] G.
[43:58] Oh, it's good to be in the house of God.
[44:00] And more importantly, it's good to be in
[44:01] his presence.
[44:03] Amen.
[44:06] By by now, you you must have heard about
[44:08] the attempted assassination of the
[44:10] former president of America, Donald
[44:13] Trump. And um I know that
[44:18] uh a lot of trauma and drama is about to
[44:21] begin.
[44:23] This is a critical year for the entire
[44:25] world. I believe a huge change is coming
[44:29] and it means a huge dynamic change even
[44:32] for this bride of Jesus Christ.
[44:36] You know sometimes they take years to
[44:38] get the wheels turning but once the
[44:40] wheels get to turning that's it. When
[44:42] God's appointed time come, God's
[44:45] appointed time come.
[44:48] So, we going to see how things unfold.
[44:51] The Bible speaks about the head of gold
[44:53] and and right onto the feet of iron and
[44:56] clay.
[44:58] And and that last kingdom was worse than
[44:59] the others.
[45:01] This is the kingdom we're in right now.
[45:04] And I think I said it before that the
[45:07] devil, he's not omnipotent or
[45:09] omniscient. So he was waiting for this
[45:12] great technological age where they could
[45:15] have all these technologies to spy and
[45:18] to privacy and everything else to know
[45:22] all things by information
[45:24] and we attachment to that of artificial
[45:26] intelligence it makes it even much more
[45:29] dangerous but we are living in that time
[45:32] and we have to begin to grasp and accept
[45:34] the time that we're in. And I'm trying
[45:38] to hint to you and encourage you that
[45:42] what you're going through now is
[45:43] nothing.
[45:45] You can't even compare it
[45:47] to what is to come.
[45:51] There's a dreadful time coming ahead.
[45:54] A glorious time for the bride.
[45:56] But the bride will be a hunted,
[45:57] persecuted group.
[45:58] Years ago, I couldn't preach that. I
[45:59] couldn't say that because I didn't think
[46:00] the people was ready fed. But now you're
[46:02] ready for it
[46:03] because the spirits to hunt and kill and
[46:06] destroy is already on the earth.
[46:08] The man who pulled that bullet 20 years
[46:10] old.
[46:11] So the spirit could get whoever he want
[46:13] to get to do stuff. Amen. So this
[46:17] morning
[46:19] uh where do I start? How do I start? But
[46:22] the punch
[46:24] maybe somebody could come and help me.
[46:26] But we have to start somewhere, right?
[46:29] All right. So
[46:31] the word is God.
[46:35] Black man there. Can you see about black
[46:37] man? Praise the Lord. The word is God
[46:40] and the word is Jesus a person.
[46:47] The written word is God in print.
[46:51] Brother Brandon, I believe that this
[46:53] Bible, this word right here, the Bible
[46:55] is God in print form.
[46:58] I believe that the Bible is a seed and
[47:00] those those words are seeds. Jesus said
[47:04] the sewing for to sew and this is it.
[47:06] The word of God is a seed. Jesus said it
[47:08] was. Then if it is God in print form and
[47:12] you receive it into your heart. Here we
[47:14] go. And then the Holy Spirit waters that
[47:18] seed, it will bring forth what it
[47:20] promised.
[47:22] Any kind of a seed you sow, it will
[47:24] bring forth that kind of a crop. God and
[47:27] his word is the self-same thing.
[47:31] So the person of Jesus and the word of
[47:34] Jesus which is the scriptures is the
[47:36] self-same thing.
[47:39] It is God in print form. You are no more
[47:42] than your word. God is no more than his
[47:44] word.
[47:44] So Jesus is the word as a person.
[47:50] This is this is something I I put put on
[47:51] here.
[47:52] Jesus is the word, the same written word
[47:55] as a person
[47:56] or the word made flesh
[47:59] or the personification of the word.
[48:02] You cannot say you're connected to Jesus
[48:04] and you're not connected to this word.
[48:10] I love Jesus. I love Jesus. But yeah, I
[48:11] love the word. Something wrong
[48:13] because the word and Jesus is the same
[48:14] thing.
[48:17] That's how people could live any kind of
[48:18] life and you know what I mean? and it
[48:21] has nothing to do with the word but the
[48:22] word is God.
[48:24] If you ever want to know what God thinks
[48:26] about a matter just read the word
[48:28] and that word is God.
[48:30] God make a a mistake. God God can't have
[48:32] been errors.
[48:42] Many are deceived
[48:44] into thinking they love Jesus but they
[48:48] have no love for the word.
[48:50] It does not work that way.
[48:53] You cannot claim to know the person of
[48:55] Christ and deny the word
[48:57] and this word is not dead.
[49:00] This word is alive.
[49:02] That's why I read Hebrews 4:12. In the
[49:05] amplified, it says, "For the word that
[49:07] God speaks is alive
[49:10] and full of power,
[49:12] making it active, operative, energizing,
[49:16] and effective. It is sharper than a
[49:19] two-edged sword.
[49:21] That's the word.
[49:22] And when you talk about putting the
[49:24] whole armor of God, you have the sword
[49:26] of the spirit,
[49:27] which is
[49:28] the word of God.
[49:32] Hallelujah.
[49:34] So to be properly empowered, you have to
[49:36] have the word as a sword. You have to
[49:38] have the word as the spirit. You have to
[49:40] have the word that is energizing. Oh,
[49:43] glory to God. Hallelujah. That is
[49:45] effective. That is operative, that is
[49:48] active. This word is not dead. This word
[49:51] have more power than you think.
[49:55] Glory. Right now, you're under the word
[49:58] because the word is what we are
[50:00] preaching. You can be healed under this
[50:02] anointing. You can be delivered under
[50:04] this anointing. You can be free under
[50:06] this anointing.
[50:07] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[50:10] [Applause]
[50:17] So let's say again from amplified for
[50:20] the word of God that speaks is alive
[50:23] full of power making it active operative
[50:25] energizing effective. It is sharper than
[50:28] a two-edged sword penetrating to
[50:30] devising line of the breath of life,
[50:33] soul, and the immortal spirit of joints
[50:35] and marrow of the deepest parts of our
[50:38] nature, exposing and sifting and
[50:41] analyzing and judging the very thoughts
[50:44] and purpose of the heart.
[50:46] So when you watch the word, the word is
[50:47] watching you.
[50:49] Oh, give the Lord some praises. When you
[50:51] watch the word, the word is watching you
[50:54] because the word goes beyond the
[50:56] thoughts, beyond the bone and marrow. So
[50:58] don't you think you get away from that
[51:00] word or give the Lord some praises. Give
[51:03] the Lord a shout in the house. The word
[51:06] that you're hearing, the word that
[51:07] you're reading, watching you,
[51:10] discerning you, checking you out,
[51:14] [Music]
[51:19] [Applause]
[51:23] the word.
[51:25] So somebody could be connected to the
[51:28] scriptures but not to the person of
[51:30] Christ.
[51:32] That's like theologians
[51:34] and people going to Bible studies and
[51:35] whatnot.
[51:36] They know Bible
[51:38] but they don't know him.
[51:40] They could debate text and scripture and
[51:42] Greek and Hebrew but they don't know
[51:44] him. So the prophet said you have to
[51:46] know the author.
[51:50] Not just the book
[51:51] but you know the person who wrote the
[51:53] book
[51:54] because the author is who already knows
[51:56] the book.
[51:57] Oh give the Lord a shout in the house
[51:59] what this mean and what that mean and
[52:01] what that mean is have an author behind
[52:03] what's written. To write it have to have
[52:05] an intelligence a mind author a person
[52:08] behind what is written. And this book
[52:11] was written by God through the mouth of
[52:14] his prophets. And man shall live by
[52:16] bread alone, but every word that proceed
[52:18] out of the mouth of God.
[52:22] No, I know I haven't given my title yet.
[52:24] I'm coming to that. Don't worry. Don't
[52:26] think I forget. I ain't forget.
[52:35] The title I have this morning is the
[52:37] authority of the word in the brain.
[52:42] the authority of the word in the brine.
[52:45] And we're going to preach some things
[52:46] this morning, not for you to hear and
[52:48] slip over your head, but for you to
[52:50] believe and accept.
[52:52] If you don't believe and accept it, it
[52:53] would not be effective to you.
[52:54] This is only for people who believe in
[52:56] what we are saying and going to accept
[52:58] it.
[53:05] Jesus. Yes. Come in. Come
[53:12] now.
[53:14] Just as a theologian could have texts,
[53:17] scriptures, Greek and and all kind of
[53:19] analysis and whatnot, and he don't know
[53:21] who Jesus is.
[53:25] A man could preach the word
[53:27] and speak words,
[53:29] but it's more than just speaking words.
[53:33] Is what kind of vessel?
[53:35] Speaking the word.
[53:43] If the word is coming through a defiled
[53:46] vessel,
[53:47] then that word is not a proof of God.
[53:50] Amen.
[53:52] And just as water coming through a pipe
[53:55] that is rusty or or it taints the water
[53:59] because of the channel that is coming
[54:01] through.
[54:03] So that is why they have so much false
[54:05] prophets now
[54:07] and false teachers now
[54:09] and they have huge massive churches
[54:11] because people following stuff.
[54:13] The Bible speaks about people following
[54:15] teachers having itching ears.
[54:17] what they're hearing of the word is not
[54:19] good enough. They want some something to
[54:21] stimulate their head
[54:23] or the ears
[54:24] and they they go for these teachers
[54:27] and these teachers going for it too.
[54:29] The Bible speaks about they are deceived
[54:31] and while they deceiving others
[54:35] it's a powerful scripture. You know
[54:37] the ministers themselves are deceived
[54:40] while they're deceiving others. So it's
[54:42] a deceiving spirit in operation. Amen.
[54:45] God doesn't come in cunning.
[54:48] God doesn't come in craft.
[54:50] God comes in wisdom,
[54:52] in knowledge and understanding.
[54:55] God will work on hand.
[54:57] God will shush you and talk behind
[54:58] somebody's back.
[55:00] The word of God is sharp.
[55:02] It is powerful. It is discerning. Oh,
[55:06] give the Lord some praises.
[55:09] Hallelujah.
[55:11] So we are talking about not just a gift
[55:14] of preaching or a gift of teaching.
[55:17] There are many men that are gifted but
[55:19] we are talking about the channel
[55:22] that brings the word.
[55:24] That's why a lot of ministers who get
[55:26] messed up and fall along the side. They
[55:28] still want to come back in the pulpit
[55:29] because they have a gift
[55:31] and the mouth deep and growly
[55:37] but they have no life
[55:39] and the channel are defiled
[55:41] but they still want to handle the word
[55:44] but the word is God.
[55:46] Oh give the Lord some praises.
[55:49] Hallelujah.
[55:51] Praise God.
[55:54] Sorry you didn't send us in the back. 1
[55:56] Thessalonians
[55:58] 2:13
[55:59] says, this is Paul.
[56:02] For this cause also, thank we God
[56:06] without ceasing.
[56:08] Because when you receive the word of
[56:10] God, which he heard of us, you receive
[56:14] it not as the word of men,
[56:16] Amen.
[56:17] But as it is in truth,
[56:19] the word of God
[56:21] which effectively
[56:23] workketh also in you that believe.
[56:26] Amen.
[56:27] Now hear this in the amplified. Paul
[56:29] speaks.
[56:30] Hallelujah. And we also especially thank
[56:33] God continually for this that when you
[56:36] receive the message of God which you
[56:39] heard from us, you welcome it not as the
[56:44] word of mere men, but as it truly is the
[56:48] word of God,
[56:49] which is effectually at work in you who
[56:54] believe,
[56:55] exercising its superhuman power in those
[56:59] who adhere to and trust in and rely on
[57:02] it.
[57:05] When you begin to conscious of the power
[57:08] of this word, you wouldn't take it
[57:10] lightly
[57:11] because this word have power in it.
[57:17] Note when Jesus was led by the spirit
[57:20] into the wilderness to be tempted, he
[57:22] didn't use any power.
[57:24] What did Jesus use?
[57:26] It is written.
[57:27] It is written. Amen.
[57:28] It is also written and that was in your
[57:31] power to back the devil up.
[57:33] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[57:35] The devil telling you things, but you
[57:37] giving back the word.
[57:38] You know what? You can't move me. I
[57:40] can't hear from God, but the devil are
[57:42] moving me. God is not speaking to me,
[57:45] but the devil can't move me. I ain't
[57:47] feeling anything, but the devil can't
[57:49] move me. Oh, God. This one said this,
[57:52] this one said that, but the devil are
[57:53] moving me. God called me. Before I had
[57:56] wife, God called me. Before I had my
[57:58] children giving trouble, God called me.
[58:00] Before that, okay, the Lord I show the
[58:02] devil moving me. Husband or no husband,
[58:05] children,
[58:07] wife on a wife, job or no job, money on
[58:09] no money.
[58:13] Upon this rock, I'll build my church, an
[58:16] anchor point. Oh, give the Lord some
[58:19] praises.
[58:25] The word
[58:27] works effectively
[58:30] depends upon how that word is received.
[58:37] First Peter 1
[58:39] want to read 22
[58:41] to 23.
[58:43] This is a backdrop of what we're going
[58:45] to go through.
[58:47] Peter speaks,
[58:50] "Seeing you have purified,"
[58:52] First Peter 1 22, "Seeing you have
[58:56] purified your souls." Here, here we go.
[58:59] Into obeying the truth,
[59:02] through the spirit,
[59:04] not hearing,
[59:07] but
[59:08] obeying.
[59:10] Amen.
[59:14] unto unfake love of the brethren. See
[59:18] that you love one another with a pure
[59:21] heart fervently,
[59:24] being born again,
[59:26] not of corruptible seed, but of
[59:30] incorruptible
[59:31] by the word of God, which liveth and
[59:33] abideth forever.
[59:35] So the real born again starts with
[59:39] the word.
[59:41] Jesus said it this way. You must be born
[59:43] again of the water and
[59:46] spirit. In other words, the seed and the
[59:49] rain.
[59:50] Not just spirit, but the word.
[59:54] Listen to me. Amplifies. 1 Peter 1:22.
[59:58] Since by your obedience to the truth
[1:00:01] through the Holy Spirit, you have
[1:00:03] purified your hearts.
[1:00:06] So your heart becomes purified by
[1:00:10] obedience to truth. Amen.
[1:00:15] You know my wife keep asking me how do
[1:00:16] we get people to change their minds
[1:00:19] that's a tough one because their mind is
[1:00:21] you
[1:00:23] I was telling her how we came from Kaiwa
[1:00:24] come from the bush
[1:00:27] wooden church outside house water from
[1:00:32] the well and different things like that
[1:00:34] and to come to here
[1:00:37] it's almost a revolutionary change of
[1:00:40] mind
[1:00:41] to think and get our mind to do things
[1:00:45] in the spirit of excellence
[1:00:49] because this is what we do here.
[1:00:51] This is how we feel about ourselves.
[1:00:53] We do things in the spirit of excellence
[1:00:57] and it's not as if we had somebody to
[1:00:59] look to or get from. Amen.
[1:01:04] We felt we did it and had to do it
[1:01:07] because we couldn't see anything like
[1:01:09] what we see what we wanted what God put
[1:01:11] in our hearts.
[1:01:12] So we had to move and change the bush
[1:01:16] thinking or country thinking to think
[1:01:18] here
[1:01:21] we made three steps. First we went in s
[1:01:23] cinema then we went in shines building
[1:01:24] and we came here and get this land and
[1:01:27] we were downstairs and everything else
[1:01:29] and step by step all the time or whatn
[1:01:31] not visioning and whatnot. So what I'm
[1:01:34] saying is this if we had the same
[1:01:37] mindset as in the country
[1:01:39] and we came here we couldn't manage this
[1:01:42] here
[1:01:42] with that same mindset
[1:01:44] we had to change our minds.
[1:01:50] Are you with me now? Amen.
[1:01:53] So since by your obedience to the truth,
[1:01:56] you have purified your hearts for the
[1:01:59] sincere affection of the brethren. See
[1:02:01] that you love one another fervently with
[1:02:02] a pure heart. You have been regenerated
[1:02:04] born again, not from mortal origin,
[1:02:08] seed, sperm, but from one that is
[1:02:12] immortal by ever living the lasting word
[1:02:15] of God.
[1:02:16] So your birth can't be from your mother.
[1:02:19] Your birth has to be from God.
[1:02:22] And the bird starts with you receiving
[1:02:24] his word
[1:02:25] willingly
[1:02:27] and inwardly,
[1:02:29] not outwardly and formally. Oh, give the
[1:02:32] Lord some praises.
[1:02:34] Hallelujah.
[1:02:35] When you could receive the word
[1:02:38] willingly and inwardly, not outwardly
[1:02:40] and formally, that's make a huge
[1:02:42] difference.
[1:02:43] Oh, give the Lord a praise
[1:02:45] because that was differentiate bride
[1:02:47] material from church material.
[1:02:49] Church do formally. and outwardly. But
[1:02:52] the bride will move inwardly. Oh, glory.
[1:02:55] And willingly. Oh, glory to God. You
[1:02:58] want God. You want a reality. You want
[1:03:01] the word. You want this word to become
[1:03:03] flesh in you. Every day I pray that
[1:03:05] prayer almost.
[1:03:08] I want this word to become flesh. When
[1:03:10] you read the word and you see me, you
[1:03:12] see the same thing.
[1:03:13] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:03:16] That makes the word active.
[1:03:18] Makes the word alive.
[1:03:26] Brother Brandon,
[1:03:28] he's doing amentment here. He said,
[1:03:30] "You're a thin lady and tired, night
[1:03:34] sweats. No one has to tell you what it
[1:03:36] is. You know that the doctor can't do
[1:03:39] it." And that's the first disease that
[1:03:40] Jesus cured. You believe that, don't
[1:03:42] you? Why TB? So, she had tubiculosis. TB
[1:03:46] is no more to him. He can just make you
[1:03:48] well in a moment. Do you believe it?
[1:03:50] Come forward.
[1:03:52] Listen to his prayer. He said, "Almighty
[1:03:54] God, the omnipotent God, omniscient, the
[1:03:56] resurrected Lord Jesus, this poor little
[1:03:58] woman standing here dying. Lord, Satan
[1:04:01] has did this evil and she is trying. I
[1:04:05] take charge over him through the
[1:04:09] authority of the Bible and through God's
[1:04:12] eternal word. I condemn Satan in Jesus'
[1:04:16] name. turn the woman loose and may she
[1:04:19] go and be made well.
[1:04:21] Amen.
[1:04:22] Oh, glory to God. Do you see what he did
[1:04:25] there? He took the authority. Oh, glory
[1:04:28] to God of the Bible and through God's
[1:04:32] eternal word. I condemn Satan in Jesus
[1:04:36] name. Turn the woman loose and may she
[1:04:38] go and be made well.
[1:04:41] Oh, hallelujah. Blessed. Give him some
[1:04:43] praises. Blessed be the name of the
[1:04:46] Lord.
[1:04:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:50] [Applause]
[1:04:51] No.
[1:05:03] The enemy will always propose his system
[1:05:06] and unbelief will accept it because the
[1:05:10] enemy is the intellectual sign.
[1:05:14] Now remember there's only two. Don't
[1:05:16] forget this. There are only two powers.
[1:05:21] Not four, not five, not 10, not 20. It's
[1:05:25] just two powers.
[1:05:29] And you are being influenced by one of
[1:05:31] them.
[1:05:37] Do you believe that?
[1:05:40] It have no neutral power, you know.
[1:05:41] Nothing nothing influencing me. But and
[1:05:43] you're behaving bad
[1:05:45] and you're behaving rude and you're
[1:05:47] behaving contrary.
[1:05:50] Wife can't talk to you, husband can't
[1:05:51] talk to you. Nobody could talk to you.
[1:05:53] And you have a frog face.
[1:05:56] Who inspire with a frog face
[1:05:59] is the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:01] Holy Spirit have peace and joy and love
[1:06:04] and everything else. You know,
[1:06:06] you know how much problem it take to to
[1:06:07] have a frown face.
[1:06:09] You you smiling sometime does lift other
[1:06:11] people's spirits.
[1:06:13] Some people looking for a good smile,
[1:06:15] healthy smile.
[1:06:17] Okay, let's go.
[1:06:19] There are only two powers. One is
[1:06:22] spiritual power of the Holy Spirit. The
[1:06:24] other one is the devil working through
[1:06:27] intellectual power.
[1:06:29] For that is where he entered in the
[1:06:31] garden of Eden through intellectual
[1:06:33] powers to make Eve believe in a
[1:06:36] intellectual conception against the
[1:06:38] word.
[1:06:39] That's why anybody try to get you off
[1:06:42] the word.
[1:06:43] You know that he's the devil.
[1:06:46] Amen.
[1:06:48] I'm talking about the written word
[1:06:50] or the spoken word
[1:06:52] or the original and see what God said.
[1:06:54] I don't care how much big the church is.
[1:06:56] If there's bishop, ask bishop, they
[1:06:57] could be the pope, it doesn't matter.
[1:07:00] Anybody of the word that's the enemy
[1:07:03] because the word is God.
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:05] [Applause]
[1:07:09] To show you what we talking about in the
[1:07:11] Garden of Eden, Eve wasn't there yet.
[1:07:13] God put Adam as a spirit.
[1:07:14] Bible said there's no man to till the
[1:07:16] soil. Take this spirit man and throw him
[1:07:18] in the dust man
[1:07:19] and man became a living soul.
[1:07:21] So here's Adam now with five senses and
[1:07:24] he could till spirit man can't dig no
[1:07:26] fork and use no hoe and till no soil and
[1:07:29] plant no peas and plant no corn.
[1:07:31] You need a physical man for that.
[1:07:33] So God form man in the dust of the earth
[1:07:35] and take the spirit man throw him inside
[1:07:36] of that man and man could work. Now
[1:07:39] when God saw Adam was lazy
[1:07:42] for you lazy inside are here
[1:07:44] then he introduced the woman to him
[1:07:46] and say he working he have my word
[1:07:49] now he could get a wife.
[1:07:54] Satan saw the opportunity when he saw
[1:07:56] Eve
[1:07:57] because Satan never approached Adam. He
[1:08:00] wait till Adam gone to work
[1:08:02] to infiltrate his home and talked to Eve
[1:08:05] and he tell Eve you shall not surely die
[1:08:08] because and he had a because with it was
[1:08:10] he because trouble
[1:08:12] because means that you're given an
[1:08:15] explanation why not to obey God why not
[1:08:18] to stay under the covenant of God
[1:08:19] because God don't know the day you eat
[1:08:22] you go be wise you'll be just like God
[1:08:25] she ears get tickled she wanted to find
[1:08:27] out what going on and afterwards we fell
[1:08:29] Yes.
[1:08:32] Lost the inheritance,
[1:08:34] lost the authority,
[1:08:35] lost the power,
[1:08:37] lost the right. I preaching this so
[1:08:39] simple that a child can understand what
[1:08:40] I'm talking about.
[1:08:41] Hallelujah.
[1:08:43] This man that God put in the Garden of
[1:08:45] Eden, lost the authority, lost the
[1:08:47] power, lost inheritance, lost the book.
[1:08:50] Lost the deed.
[1:08:54] How could we come back in a position of
[1:08:55] power and authority?
[1:09:00] How could we?
[1:09:07] Let's skip this.
[1:09:09] All right, let's close that off. Just
[1:09:11] two powers, right?
[1:09:12] All right, let's go. Now, when Jesus
[1:09:16] cursed the fig tree, Peter brought it to
[1:09:18] the remembrance. Hey, look next day. It
[1:09:20] withered away. So, one day Jesus cursed
[1:09:23] it next day to see fig tree. And Jesus
[1:09:25] said, "Verily, I say unto you, if you
[1:09:27] shall say to this mountain, be thou
[1:09:29] removed,
[1:09:30] and cast into the sea, but not doubt in
[1:09:32] your heart, but shall believe that those
[1:09:34] things which he see shall come to pass.
[1:09:36] He shall have whatever he seeth."
[1:09:38] He's talking about you speaking now.
[1:09:40] He's talking about what he did, you
[1:09:42] could do.
[1:09:43] He's telling them that to their face.
[1:09:45] Not only I could do this, but you can
[1:09:46] too.
[1:09:47] But you have to believe in your heart
[1:09:49] what you say.
[1:09:52] You have to believe what you say.
[1:09:54] I want to say it again. You have to
[1:09:56] believe what
[1:09:57] you say. I can't say it. You have to say
[1:10:00] it.
[1:10:01] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:10:03] Oh, glory to God. Do you get that?
[1:10:06] He is saying I can't say it for you,
[1:10:08] but you have to believe what you say.
[1:10:11] You can have what you ask for.
[1:10:21] So you're saying about
[1:10:24] have faith in God. We are taught in
[1:10:26] God's blessed word that faith come by
[1:10:29] hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[1:10:32] Now faith is also an experience.
[1:10:34] Last time we spoke about that too.
[1:10:36] Amen.
[1:10:36] That people talk about faith come
[1:10:37] hearing the word and what right? But
[1:10:39] faith also is also an experience.
[1:10:44] He's going deeper. And many times faith
[1:10:47] is had by a former experience makes
[1:10:51] faith grow.
[1:10:54] So you really can't be a dull Christian
[1:10:56] or a dumb Christian or a kind of donkey
[1:10:59] like Christian. Heho or like a goat
[1:11:01] Christian. You have to be active in
[1:11:03] faith to get God experience that your
[1:11:07] past experience help it to grow to a new
[1:11:10] experience. David handled the bear and
[1:11:13] the lion that give him the faith to deal
[1:11:16] with Goliath. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:11:18] in the house.
[1:11:22] God can't lose Goliath and you and you
[1:11:25] handle a mouse
[1:11:27] in the house.
[1:11:32] The mouse come in and you run out
[1:11:37] in your own house.
[1:11:45] But it's true.
[1:11:49] So I want you to understand what you are
[1:11:52] facing. God want you to deal with it.
[1:11:54] Amen.
[1:11:55] We read
[1:11:56] God give the guarantee and the assurance
[1:11:59] he will never allow you or not allow you
[1:12:02] to be tempted above what you can bear.
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:07] So when the testing come, the temptation
[1:12:09] come, the trial comes, God know you can
[1:12:11] handle it.
[1:12:12] Hold yourself steady.
[1:12:15] Say it. I shall not be moved.
[1:12:19] Say tell the devil, "No devil,
[1:12:22] not this time.
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] [Applause]
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:35] Hallelujah.
[1:12:37] Many times faith is had by a former
[1:12:39] experience makes faith grow.
[1:12:42] Faith being the substance of things
[1:12:43] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[1:12:45] seen. So many people fail to find the
[1:12:48] real meaning of what faith is. Some
[1:12:50] people believe that faith is some
[1:12:52] sensation or some emotion. But the Bible
[1:12:56] said that faith is the substance of
[1:12:59] things hoped for.
[1:13:01] Some things that is a mental conception
[1:13:02] of the word. That is not right. Faith is
[1:13:05] a substance.
[1:13:08] Like how I have this scripture in my
[1:13:10] hand
[1:13:10] and I could feel it.
[1:13:12] Faith is actually a substance.
[1:13:15] A real thing.
[1:13:16] He said faith is not a myth. That's
[1:13:18] right.
[1:13:19] Fear is a substance.
[1:13:21] And I know it.
[1:13:23] Hallelujah. It's real.
[1:13:27] I was telling my daughter-in-law. I
[1:13:28] said, "When I see it, I have it."
[1:13:32] That's how I I'm built. I have to see it
[1:13:34] first.
[1:13:37] I remember when water was coming out in
[1:13:39] front there and one day I just get like
[1:13:41] that and let's walk straight across here
[1:13:43] and look over. I said, "But we could get
[1:13:44] a camera straight down this way." And
[1:13:47] right there was the gentleman who owned
[1:13:48] the property there. I said, "Could we
[1:13:49] allow us to?" He say, "Sure." That's how
[1:13:51] we get a diver in there.
[1:13:54] Thinking about uh the cry room where we
[1:13:57] have cry room. One day I walk out there
[1:13:59] watch side the building there. Watch and
[1:14:02] I see it.
[1:14:04] I said we get it right then and we have
[1:14:05] it now.
[1:14:07] That's faith.
[1:14:09] I believe it
[1:14:12] and we can have it.
[1:14:13] Oh, glory to God. faith.
[1:14:16] Sometimes difficult challenges come and
[1:14:18] I I'm seeing solutions.
[1:14:20] I'm seeing opportunities.
[1:14:22] I'm seeing how the way going to be made.
[1:14:24] I don't drop my God because this
[1:14:26] happened and that happened and that
[1:14:27] negative. No, I press past that.
[1:14:30] That's the only way we could get it
[1:14:31] done.
[1:14:32] We have to get it done.
[1:14:35] Not no if, not no but. We are warriors,
[1:14:38] not warriors.
[1:14:40] Warriors of the faith. Oh, give the Lord
[1:14:43] some praises.
[1:14:45] Worrying about your problem can't help
[1:14:47] your problem.
[1:14:48] Worrying about your problem can't solve
[1:14:49] your problem. You have to fight.
[1:14:52] Oh, glory to God. You can't fight in the
[1:14:55] carnal realm. You have to fight in the
[1:14:57] realm of the spirit.
[1:14:58] You have to fight in the realm of faith.
[1:15:00] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:15:03] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:07] Let's go.
[1:15:10] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:15:11] for. To have an evidence, it must be a
[1:15:14] substance.
[1:15:15] You have evidence for the court and what
[1:15:17] must be real.
[1:15:18] Man was smoking marijuana. Where the rat
[1:15:21] eating marijuana hear
[1:15:23] the rat eat all the marijuana. There no
[1:15:24] evidence that didn't miss the case. You
[1:15:27] must have
[1:15:28] they say rat cooking too. Don't know
[1:15:30] what it is. All the cooking gone police
[1:15:33] selling cooking selling marijuana. What
[1:15:35] they said the rat the evidence dismiss
[1:15:38] the case. It is the evidence of what you
[1:15:42] hope for.
[1:15:43] It is the evidence of things you do not
[1:15:45] have yet. So when God revealed to
[1:15:48] Abraham about Isaac, Isaac had it.
[1:15:50] Not Sarah. Isaac had it
[1:15:52] in his heart. Isaac knew.
[1:15:55] Abraham knew Isaac was coming
[1:15:57] because it was a faith seed inside his
[1:15:58] heart.
[1:15:59] Oh, glory to God. And when God told
[1:16:02] Abraham to offer up Isaac, it was easy
[1:16:04] for him to say, "We going up and we
[1:16:06] going back down." Because you know if
[1:16:07] you had a killer go raise him from the
[1:16:09] dead. So it's not a problem we see. Oh
[1:16:13] gosh my 12y old son. Oh God
[1:16:18] no no no you know some some of us when
[1:16:20] when God bring the test but not are you
[1:16:22] sure it's you voice of God tell me over
[1:16:25] Abraham didn't go in that mode you know
[1:16:27] we going that kind of mode you know you
[1:16:28] know pray for me in a fight. Where is he
[1:16:30] fight? God tell
[1:16:32] you no fight. You just have to do what
[1:16:34] God say do.
[1:16:35] But you don't want your flesh get
[1:16:37] singed. You don't want to get your heart
[1:16:38] arrested. So you are sticking with your
[1:16:41] old. You're sticking with your problem.
[1:16:42] You're sticking with this. And God want
[1:16:44] to you to offer it up because God have a
[1:16:46] ram already caught in the ticket there.
[1:16:48] You can stay down here and get that ram.
[1:16:49] You to go up there, put the boy on the
[1:16:51] altar. Come down with a knife. Then you
[1:16:53] will see the ram. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:16:55] shout. You don't have to hunt the ram.
[1:16:57] You don't have to lash through the ram
[1:16:59] and pull the ram. It's already tied up
[1:17:00] already. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[1:17:03] the house. God has provided for himself
[1:17:05] a sacrifice. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:17:08] praises, friends. I want to stir your
[1:17:11] faith up this morning. I want to light
[1:17:13] you up this morning. I want to put some
[1:17:15] gasoline on you and scratch the match
[1:17:17] and light you up this morning. Oh, glory
[1:17:19] to God. When you leave here, it might be
[1:17:22] oozing out of you. Faith in your mouth,
[1:17:24] faith in your eyes, faith in your ears,
[1:17:26] faith in your feet, faith in your hands.
[1:17:29] Well, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:17:31] house.
[1:17:32] Glory to God. Your living, moving faith
[1:17:34] member.
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:47] It's not something that you kindly push
[1:17:49] yourself to. I've noticed so many in my
[1:17:52] meetings, people try to work themselves
[1:17:53] up into something to make themselves
[1:17:55] believe you can't do that.
[1:17:57] You're just beat in the air.
[1:17:59] Faith is something here we go. That's
[1:18:01] just as calm and subtle as it can be.
[1:18:05] You want to know?
[1:18:06] It is taking God at his word
[1:18:09] and having the assurance in your heart
[1:18:12] that God is able to keep what he has
[1:18:15] said and he would do and will perform
[1:18:18] everything that he said he would do.
[1:18:20] Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:18:23] I've noticed many times people think
[1:18:26] they must be prayed for. We should pray
[1:18:27] for each other and the hands, some
[1:18:30] evangelist's hands must be ministered
[1:18:32] that bring contact. But real
[1:18:35] unadulterated faith is taking God at his
[1:18:39] word.
[1:18:41] That's the main thing.
[1:18:43] One time some Apache Indian was in a
[1:18:46] wheelchair and she had a got a prayer
[1:18:48] cloth from the prophet. She put the
[1:18:50] prayer cloth on her legs and say,
[1:18:52] "Satan, get out of there, you crippled
[1:18:55] spirit."
[1:18:56] and she walk out the way.
[1:18:59] That woman believe
[1:19:01] another woman come up on the platform
[1:19:03] with crutches and she was watching
[1:19:05] everybody coming through and whatnot.
[1:19:07] And when she reached up, she hand him
[1:19:09] the crutches and walked back out. No
[1:19:10] prayer.
[1:19:14] That is faith. She see enough to ask for
[1:19:17] prayer. Her faith was so high she didn't
[1:19:20] need to pray. She just hand him the
[1:19:21] crutches and keep on walking. Oh, won't
[1:19:24] you hand your crutches here this
[1:19:25] morning? Where you what propping you up?
[1:19:29] Give the Lord a shout in your house.
[1:19:32] Don't let all kind of stuff prop you up.
[1:19:33] Hand your crutches and walk out of here
[1:19:36] whole. Walk out of here healed.
[1:19:39] Walk out of here delivered. Oh, praise
[1:19:41] God.
[1:19:44] Let's go.
[1:19:46] In the meeting, my meetings I has never
[1:19:49] been a my meeting has never been to a
[1:19:51] place where I have tried to make the
[1:19:54] people think that there was something
[1:19:56] that God has given me a little special
[1:19:59] towards healing someone. That's an
[1:20:01] error. God has given no one any powers
[1:20:05] to heal someone. Healing comes alone by
[1:20:09] faith
[1:20:10] and faith in a work that already been
[1:20:12] done. Yes,
[1:20:14] a finished work that Christ did at
[1:20:15] Calvary.
[1:20:18] He says, "If it is so much like this, if
[1:20:20] I was starving for food and one loaf of
[1:20:23] bread would save my life and you pass by
[1:20:25] in the country, you see me starving. You
[1:20:27] say, "But Brana, are you hungry?" I
[1:20:28] said, "I will die shortly if I do not
[1:20:30] have some bread." And you reach in your
[1:20:32] pocket and give me 25 cents. You say,
[1:20:34] "But a Brandon, this is the purchasing
[1:20:37] power of the loaf of bread. You're sick.
[1:20:39] Your belly holding your belly, but you
[1:20:40] have the coin. You need to get to the
[1:20:42] bakery. Once they get to the bakery, you
[1:20:44] get the bread. So the 25 cents is the
[1:20:47] purchasing power, which is the fate. The
[1:20:49] 25 cents is the substance of what how
[1:20:51] you're going to get the bread.
[1:20:52] 25 cents represent a ticket that will
[1:20:54] give you the bus ride.
[1:20:55] You have to have that 25 cents.
[1:20:57] And that is what that word come to do to
[1:20:59] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:21:01] fathers. That's why in a prophet that we
[1:21:03] could get the power now, we get the
[1:21:04] authority now to make further claims
[1:21:07] because you have to have faith to handle
[1:21:09] this book that Adam lost.
[1:21:11] Oh, praise God. Romans 5:17.
[1:21:14] This is a great scripture here. Romans
[1:21:16] 5:17. For if by one's man offense,
[1:21:20] debt reign by one. Talking about Adam.
[1:21:23] Much more they which receive abundance
[1:21:26] of grace.
[1:21:28] Talking about us now. Abundance of
[1:21:31] not just grace. Abundance and of the
[1:21:33] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[1:21:36] life by one Jesus Christ. In the
[1:21:39] amplified, this same scripture says,
[1:21:40] "For if because of one man's trespass,
[1:21:45] lapse or offense, death reign through
[1:21:48] that one, much more surely will those
[1:21:52] who receive
[1:21:54] God's overflowing grace, unmmerited
[1:21:58] favor, and the free gift of
[1:22:01] righteousness,
[1:22:02] putting them into right standing with
[1:22:04] himself, reign as
[1:22:08] kings
[1:22:10] in life through the one man Jesus Christ
[1:22:13] the Messiah the anointed one
[1:22:16] God want us to reign as
[1:22:18] shout out shout outings
[1:22:20] he has made us
[1:22:21] kings and priests
[1:22:23] and we shall reign
[1:22:25] on the earth
[1:22:27] that's not just to come you know that's
[1:22:28] all now
[1:22:32] I know I didn't expect anybody to shout
[1:22:33] on that one or say amen on that one but
[1:22:35] it's still the truth and the truth
[1:22:36] people going to set you free. We shall
[1:22:38] reign on the earth. Reign is to conquer,
[1:22:39] to rule, to dominate, to overcome, to
[1:22:42] have victory over, to have power over,
[1:22:44] to have dominion over. We going to reign
[1:22:46] on the earth. Reign over your feelings.
[1:22:48] Reign over your fears. Oh, give the Lord
[1:22:50] a shout. Reign over that devil that's
[1:22:52] troubling you. You're going to reign on
[1:22:54] the earth. Reign in your own home. Reign
[1:22:56] in your territory. Reign in the grounds
[1:22:58] that God has given you. Give the Lord a
[1:23:00] shout in the house.
[1:23:08] We have been striking this thing about
[1:23:09] righteousness through faith and what God
[1:23:12] sees as righteousness. It's not we are
[1:23:14] righteous. The Bible said there are
[1:23:15] nonrighteous not one.
[1:23:16] So it's not all righteousness. It's his
[1:23:18] righteousness upon us through the
[1:23:20] abundance of grace. You can't work for
[1:23:22] that. Grace is the gift of God. Oh give
[1:23:24] the Lord some praises.
[1:23:25] Do you have grace? He g release
[1:23:27] abundance grace
[1:23:29] to you. He could have killed you a long
[1:23:31] time ago, but to you, he released
[1:23:35] abundant. Say, shout it abundance grace.
[1:23:37] Abundant grace. That's what he released
[1:23:39] to you that you could acquire his
[1:23:41] righteousness. 2 Corinthians 5:21 says,
[1:23:45] "For he had made him," talking about
[1:23:48] Jesus, "to be sin for us
[1:23:50] who knew no sin,
[1:23:52] that we might be made
[1:23:56] the righteousness of God
[1:23:58] in him."
[1:23:59] Did you get that?
[1:24:01] Let's say that slowly. For he Jesus had
[1:24:04] made him for he God had made him to be
[1:24:07] sin for us
[1:24:09] who knew no sin
[1:24:11] that we might be made righteousness of
[1:24:13] God in him. The amplified of 2
[1:24:16] Corinthians 5:21 says, "For our sake, he
[1:24:20] made Christ virtually to be sin who knew
[1:24:23] no sin. So that in and through him we
[1:24:27] might become endued with, viewed as
[1:24:30] being an example of righteousness of
[1:24:32] God, what we ought to be approved and
[1:24:35] acceptable in right relationship with
[1:24:38] him by his goodness."
[1:24:41] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:24:44] You ready with me now?
[1:24:46] So we want to talk a little bit about
[1:24:48] Joseph.
[1:24:50] And Joseph is a good example of when
[1:24:52] your life is destined to power and
[1:24:55] authority and how where God pass you
[1:24:57] through.
[1:24:59] Good example. He was sold by his
[1:25:01] brothers
[1:25:03] but he was not ready to assume
[1:25:06] power and authority.
[1:25:08] Are you with me now? Amen.
[1:25:10] When he was in Pisva's house and he's
[1:25:14] thinking back, he could have had harbor
[1:25:17] a lot of resentment for his brothers.
[1:25:20] It's normal. Your brothers treat you
[1:25:22] real badly and terribly. They sell you
[1:25:23] out. And Joseph had was to grow all pass
[1:25:26] of that. All pass of if I only see them
[1:25:29] now, I'll get revenge. I go take
[1:25:31] revenge. Angry, upset, you know, people
[1:25:33] talk, I'll hit back.
[1:25:36] But all of that revenge or anger or
[1:25:39] whatever he might be going through that
[1:25:41] proved
[1:25:42] he was not ready
[1:25:46] because you can't be ready and you have
[1:25:48] a grudges.
[1:25:50] You can't be ready and you can't talk to
[1:25:51] this one and nobody can talk to you and
[1:25:53] your same old self stinking rotten self
[1:25:56] you was 30 years ago. You're still so
[1:25:57] now
[1:25:58] and everybody seeing no change.
[1:26:05] people looking and seeing no change.
[1:26:07] You're supposed to feel ashamed now. I
[1:26:09] feel sorry for you. Now, you know, I
[1:26:11] hope you feel ashamed
[1:26:13] because see, nobody could change but
[1:26:15] you.
[1:26:16] You have to want to change.
[1:26:18] Because you could be you and stay you as
[1:26:20] you
[1:26:21] without any change.
[1:26:23] And you have to start to change by the
[1:26:24] renewing of your mind, by changing your
[1:26:27] thoughts. And if you change your
[1:26:28] thoughts, you change the words that come
[1:26:30] out your mouth.
[1:26:32] Oh, give the Lord a shout. They stop
[1:26:33] your gossiping, old talking, just saying
[1:26:36] things negative, saying where will come
[1:26:38] to your mind and you have no lit for
[1:26:40] your mouth. You'll cut that crap out and
[1:26:42] you would speak what God want you to
[1:26:44] speak.
[1:26:45] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:26:47] You would say what the spirit want you
[1:26:49] to say.
[1:26:51] Hallelujah. You would zip up.
[1:26:59] Peter thought he was doing a great job
[1:27:00] when he jo
[1:27:09] not not so that same Peter draw sword he
[1:27:11] deny Christ said nice you know
[1:27:15] the outward action the outward drama
[1:27:18] you're defending the Lord and what a
[1:27:20] drama you know
[1:27:22] when Peter say Jesus going and die and
[1:27:24] get licks he say are you not in Yeah,
[1:27:26] that's a different thing. I believe I'm
[1:27:28] I'm a disciple, but you see that I don't
[1:27:30] know him at all. I never saw that man.
[1:27:32] He didn't have three times.
[1:27:35] He didn't have power
[1:27:37] internally. He didn't have resident
[1:27:39] power.
[1:27:40] He didn't have the attian well inside of
[1:27:42] him yet.
[1:27:43] So therefore, if wife, we know her,
[1:27:48] drama queen,
[1:27:50] and Joseph runs straight out from her.
[1:27:53] Now he's in prison wrongfully accused
[1:27:57] but he know he's promised to come into a
[1:27:59] position of power and authority
[1:28:02] but the time is not yet. He interpret
[1:28:05] butter butler dream, bake a dream. He
[1:28:07] see the butler going to be restored. He
[1:28:09] say when you get up there remember me.
[1:28:12] But when the man going up there forget
[1:28:16] wicked man
[1:28:18] I tell him his b and thing. Look at the
[1:28:20] man. Wicked man. Send a letter for him.
[1:28:22] Wickedness. Send a text in a WhatsApp.
[1:28:26] Not Joseph.
[1:28:27] You see it wasn't about the man.
[1:28:30] It's about God. Joseph wasn't ready yet.
[1:28:34] Because when Joseph is ready, God could
[1:28:36] be ready.
[1:28:37] You were ready yet.
[1:28:40] Glory to God. God want you to get ready.
[1:28:43] His wife have made herself ready. When
[1:28:45] you ready, you get it.
[1:28:47] Glory to God. Are you ready this
[1:28:49] morning? You got to get ready.
[1:28:52] That woman with the blood issue, she
[1:28:53] told herself if I could just touch him
[1:28:55] with his garment and made whole. And she
[1:28:56] pressed away and what happened? She got
[1:28:58] healed.
[1:28:58] All right, let's continue. Oh, praise
[1:29:01] God. So God wanted Joseph to grow to
[1:29:06] learn.
[1:29:07] And when he grew into his calling,
[1:29:11] and he come into that maturity to
[1:29:13] effectively lead. And I keep saying you
[1:29:15] cannot really lead if you don't know how
[1:29:16] to follow.
[1:29:18] Watch all them people who have ambition
[1:29:19] to lead and to be charged and to be
[1:29:21] charge of and what not. They can't
[1:29:22] follow nothing. They're just bullhead
[1:29:24] and bullies.
[1:29:25] Not not not leading nice brassfaced
[1:29:27] people. Go be brass facing to see our
[1:29:31] feet.
[1:29:32] All right.
[1:29:33] So watch. You cannot
[1:29:36] effectively become a leader if you're
[1:29:39] not prepared to serve.
[1:29:42] Jesus said it this way. Let him that is
[1:29:44] greatest among you.
[1:29:46] Let him serve.
[1:29:48] For the son of man came not to be served
[1:29:50] but
[1:29:52] to serve. By this shall men men know you
[1:29:56] make disciples when you love one
[1:29:57] another. And how he demonstrated that?
[1:29:59] By washing one another feet.
[1:30:01] And that was the lowest job in them
[1:30:03] times.
[1:30:04] That's the job you have when people come
[1:30:06] into somebody's house. They call him
[1:30:07] feet washing flunky. You have a basin of
[1:30:09] water. All the dust and all muck and all
[1:30:12] the mess from the donkeys and on the
[1:30:14] road. And you come to somebody house,
[1:30:15] you just walk with all your mess. And in
[1:30:17] them days is long clothes. So they had
[1:30:18] somebody to wash your feet before you
[1:30:20] come into the building. That was the
[1:30:22] job. That was the lowest paid job.
[1:30:24] That was the lowest job. And Jesus when
[1:30:26] he took the B and say come Peter said no
[1:30:28] no no Peter already and he talking if
[1:30:31] you don't watch no you no pat Lord b me
[1:30:34] now pour p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p
[1:30:35] p p p pour the water pour the whole
[1:30:36] basin on me. You understand I'm saying
[1:30:38] then? But but the point I want to bring
[1:30:40] to you is this. Jesus was demonstrating
[1:30:42] if I could do this to you. I want you as
[1:30:45] an example to do this to each other to
[1:30:47] demonstrate to the world that my love is
[1:30:49] now among you all. that my love is
[1:30:51] stirred inside of there. Oh, give the
[1:30:53] Lord some praises. Oh, God. Do you get a
[1:30:55] church? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So all
[1:30:59] your trials and all your challenges and
[1:31:02] tribulation is designed for you. You
[1:31:04] can't try to get it access some other.
[1:31:06] You can't download somebody else trial
[1:31:08] and test it. Say Lord my own too hard.
[1:31:09] Let me download sister so and so. Let me
[1:31:11] let me get brother so and so. No, God
[1:31:13] don't giving you that download. The
[1:31:14] download you getting is designed for
[1:31:16] you. It's customized for you. So thank
[1:31:19] God he knew you. That's why he rebuked
[1:31:22] you. He knew you. Oh, that's why he
[1:31:24] called you. He knew you. That's why he
[1:31:26] could give you a special test and trial.
[1:31:28] Glory to God. If you know you're lazy,
[1:31:29] he know what to put the fire under you
[1:31:31] and slow burn. You know what I mean? To
[1:31:33] put some heat in you to get you moving
[1:31:35] then. That turtle didn't want to move.
[1:31:37] They beat the turtle with a stick.
[1:31:39] Nothing happened. Choke it. Put water.
[1:31:40] Nothing moving. When God when he put
[1:31:42] some fire on the turtle and neck head
[1:31:44] come out and start to move. And some of
[1:31:46] you still in your shell. But God has to
[1:31:48] put some fire under you to get that head
[1:31:50] out and get that turtle moving. Oh, give
[1:31:52] the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:31:59] So, Joseph at the climax of his
[1:32:02] revelation of the call of God upon his
[1:32:05] life. He recognized that God actually
[1:32:08] took him through that journey to put him
[1:32:10] in a position that he could serve
[1:32:13] and minister to his own family. Amen.
[1:32:16] Oh, glory to God. Give that Lord some
[1:32:18] praises.
[1:32:19] They listen to Joseph words. God send me
[1:32:22] ahead to preserve life.
[1:32:25] When the time come, they say, "Send for
[1:32:26] Joseph because he had a dream and all
[1:32:28] them magicians and rich doctors and all
[1:32:30] them so-cal
[1:32:32] anointed men of the hour
[1:32:34] that far around him. They could
[1:32:36] interpret that mysteries that was coming
[1:32:38] for and Joseph went and prayed, come
[1:32:40] with the mysteries, bring revelation."
[1:32:42] And Joseph said, "Here what? You got to
[1:32:44] find a man
[1:32:45] that have the wisdom to manage this.
[1:32:48] And Pharaoh say, "Well, who else?
[1:32:50] A old jail bird like you,
[1:32:52] a felon like you. You are the man.
[1:32:55] You are the man." Somebody say, "But he
[1:32:57] just go to prison." What you going to
[1:32:59] do?
[1:33:00] He's chosen.
[1:33:02] He's appointed.
[1:33:04] He's anointed.
[1:33:06] Somebody say, "You did this. You did
[1:33:07] that." What I going to do?
[1:33:09] Abundance of grace.
[1:33:11] Abundance of God's love. abundance of
[1:33:14] God's blessing. I'm anointed.
[1:33:17] I'm appointed. I'm elected. I am
[1:33:21] predestinated.
[1:33:23] I didn't call myself. I didn't
[1:33:25] predestinate it myself. I didn't elect
[1:33:28] myself. And I am grateful this morning.
[1:33:31] Oh, give God some praise. Glory.
[1:33:35] Hallelujah.
[1:33:37] Let's go.
[1:33:39] It was him sitting on the bench down the
[1:33:41] other day when Satan seen a chance to
[1:33:43] kill me.
[1:33:45] And he couldn't do it.
[1:33:47] He will never do it until Christ says
[1:33:49] it's ready.
[1:33:51] No matter how much times he comes, he'll
[1:33:53] go back empty-handed
[1:33:55] until Christ gives an order.
[1:33:59] A promise. God's promise it. God, God's
[1:34:02] word that promises it. And we believe
[1:34:04] that because we are air.
[1:34:07] Let's go. Are you ready?
[1:34:08] Amen.
[1:34:09] After all these things, I want you to
[1:34:10] say
[1:34:10] amen.
[1:34:12] Loud as loud as you can.
[1:34:14] I'm an air of divine healing.
[1:34:16] I'm an air of joy.
[1:34:18] Amen.

[1:34:32] I'm an heir to every evidence is got.
[1:34:35] And there's a big one. I'm heir to the
[1:34:37] authority of God.
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:48] Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] Glory to God.
[1:34:53] Hallelujah.
[1:34:57] I'm a heir to the throne.

[1:35:04] thing. All things. He say everything is
[1:35:06] under your feet. Even death is under
[1:35:09] your feet. The grave is under your feet.
[1:35:12] Hell is under your feet. Sin is under
[1:35:15] your feet. Everything is under your
[1:35:17] feet. You are air. Oh give the Lord a
[1:35:20] shout in the house.
[1:35:23] Oh glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:35:31] Call us what you want. You say we are
[1:35:34] crazy if you want to, but we are heirs.
[1:35:37] Heirs of what? All things.
[1:35:40] Shout out all things.
[1:35:42] Are you heir to Brandham Tabernacle? No.
[1:35:44] I'm heir to all things both, seen,
[1:35:47] present, future, to everything. I'm air
[1:35:50] to air.
[1:35:56] Doesn't that make you feel good this
[1:35:57] morning?
[1:35:59] Every sin and wickedness, you may be
[1:36:01] seated, has been put under my feet
[1:36:04] by the grace of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:06] He rose on Easter morning, triumph over
[1:36:08] death, hell, and the grave and made me a
[1:36:10] heir. And he said, "Wait yonder. I give
[1:36:12] you a promise." And his anointed
[1:36:14] authoritative servant said, "The promise
[1:36:16] is unto you."
[1:36:18] Amen.
[1:36:18] And to your children,
[1:36:20] to them that are far off, even as many
[1:36:22] the Lord of God shall call, I'm an heir.
[1:36:24] Jesus, prove it to us. When we enter
[1:36:27] that battleground between death and
[1:36:28] life, I'm a sinner, brother Bham. You
[1:36:30] don't have to be.
[1:36:32] You a sinner because you desire to be.
[1:36:34] You don't have to be because the debt
[1:36:36] already paid.
[1:36:38] Brother Brandham, I wish a high joy. You
[1:36:40] can have it. You are just letting Satan
[1:36:42] rob you from the privileges that Christ
[1:36:45] died for.
[1:36:46] I'm a heir to it. It's all mine.
[1:36:48] Everything he died for belongs to me,
[1:36:50] belongs to you. We are his children. We
[1:36:52] are heirs of everything he died for.
[1:36:54] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. When
[1:36:56] you enter into the battleground, there
[1:36:58] is no such thing as the baptism of Holy
[1:37:00] Ghost.
[1:37:03] You know you're going to act funny.
[1:37:05] There's something there's going to be
[1:37:06] something going to be something
[1:37:07] different. I don't care what difference
[1:37:08] it is. I'mma air it.
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:14] Tell the message don't want to talk
[1:37:15] about no back.
[1:37:17] You want to say seed in soul seed is you
[1:37:21] word on top of word on top of word.
[1:37:23] You're the bride.
[1:37:25] a train that bride
[1:37:28] go there coming for a train bride
[1:37:30] that bride rep in representing a
[1:37:32] national garment doesn't mean a train
[1:37:33] bride you know it just represent a bride
[1:37:35] from training
[1:37:36] nothing else the bride has to be the
[1:37:38] word
[1:37:39] because the bride is part of a husband
[1:37:42] the bride has to be magnetized to the
[1:37:44] Holy Ghost
[1:37:46] isn't that right
[1:37:47] let's go
[1:37:49] my
[1:37:51] ought to be the motive of every sinner
[1:37:53] I'm coming to receive it upon the bas of
[1:37:54] the Holy Spirit who is here now telling
[1:37:57] me coming to receive it. All right,
[1:37:58] let's continue. Now Abraham,
[1:38:01] Lot was part of that land. Abraham had a
[1:38:03] right to it. Now Abraham, he said, "God,
[1:38:06] you made me a promise that this land and
[1:38:08] all that is in it is mine. You made a
[1:38:10] promise. Now my kinsman has been taken.
[1:38:11] He's got gone." Now remember Lot and
[1:38:15] Abraham men had issues, right?
[1:38:17] Lot choose and end up to Sodom. And to
[1:38:20] show you that Abraham had the right
[1:38:21] spirit, he still was interested in Lot's
[1:38:23] deliverance.
[1:38:25] So he went go to God and say, "God, oh
[1:38:27] God, my family, my family." In other
[1:38:29] words, I apply that today. I said,
[1:38:30] "Church, Lord God, here's my brother.
[1:38:33] He's laying here stricken with cancer.
[1:38:35] He's stricken with tuberculosis. He's
[1:38:36] got so and so. I lay." Listen to these
[1:38:39] words now because we have to apply it.
[1:38:41] We have to be able to speak it. You
[1:38:42] know, this is this is thing to teach us
[1:38:44] how to manage when it comes our way. You
[1:38:47] say, "Lord, I lay a hold of the promise.
[1:38:50] It is my possession.
[1:38:52] You told me so." This is you talking to
[1:38:55] your child.
[1:38:56] This is you talking to your sister, to
[1:38:57] your brother, to your daughter, whoever.
[1:38:59] You told me so. And then you can go
[1:39:02] after the enemy, that devil, and
[1:39:03] slaughter it. Yet Abraham had a right to
[1:39:05] the promise, and the promise was his.
[1:39:07] Yet he had a right fight to possess it.
[1:39:09] There is the believer today. We are heir
[1:39:11] to all things. We're heir to every
[1:39:12] spiritual blessing, every physical
[1:39:14] blessing, every blessing the Bible
[1:39:15] promises. But you have to fight every
[1:39:17] inch
[1:39:19] of it.
[1:39:20] Amen.
[1:39:21] And that's the way God got it set up.
[1:39:24] It's always been that way.
[1:39:25] Amen.
[1:39:26] So if you feel that the car is yours,
[1:39:28] but you're seeing tricycle and other two
[1:39:30] wheel bike and thing like that and you
[1:39:32] had a that you know, thank you Lord for
[1:39:35] the tricycle and you ped on your
[1:39:36] tricycle but the car is yours.
[1:39:38] You had to fight for it.
[1:39:39] You had to come through this and come
[1:39:40] through that but that is yours.
[1:39:42] The throne was always David owned but
[1:39:44] you had to fight for it. You have to
[1:39:45] fight to live, fight to die, fight to
[1:39:47] survive. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:39:49] Are you with me?
[1:39:50] Let's go. Let's go. It's going to get
[1:39:52] better. You say, "But man, I need
[1:39:54] healing." The promise is yours. But if
[1:39:56] you're ever going to get it, you ain't
[1:39:57] going to get it easy. I'm going to tell
[1:39:59] you that. You're going to have to take
[1:40:01] it away from Satan. Satan, capture your
[1:40:03] health. You got to write say, "Give it
[1:40:05] back.
[1:40:06] Hand it over.
[1:40:07] I come in the name of the Lord, the
[1:40:09] possessor of the heaven and earth. I'm
[1:40:11] his air. Give it back." Amen.
[1:40:13] You took my child. You got to mix up
[1:40:15] with the wrong boy. You took my boy. Mix
[1:40:17] up with the wrong girl. I claim them.
[1:40:20] When last you made a claim,
[1:40:23] say amen.
[1:40:24] When last you say, I claim them.
[1:40:26] I claim my family. I claim this house
[1:40:30] out of the hands of demon oppression and
[1:40:32] activity. I claim it in the name of
[1:40:34] Jesus.
[1:40:37] When you go home, put your foot in your
[1:40:39] home and say, I claim this ground.
[1:40:41] Every devil hanging around here have to
[1:40:43] leave.
[1:40:44] Devil of frustration, devil of
[1:40:46] depression. Oh, the devil is not act.
[1:40:48] The devil is active, you know.
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:52] Hallelujah.
[1:40:54] You're not talking about a physical
[1:40:55] being. He nobody spirit. Spirit spirits
[1:40:58] spirits in the air.
[1:41:00] Spirit in your mind. See, but the pastor
[1:41:02] don't love you spirit.
[1:41:11] The church have no love
[1:41:14] cuz nobody look for you. Do you look for
[1:41:16] anybody? No.
[1:41:20] They wouldn't say I have no love because
[1:41:22] you look for nobody. You know the church
[1:41:24] who church supposed to come by you and
[1:41:25] look for you.
[1:41:26] Devil playing with your mind.
[1:41:29] If we had 10,000 people here, you think
[1:41:31] nobody look for you. Only 10,000 people
[1:41:32] come and look for
[1:41:35] one in a million.
[1:41:37] Amen.
[1:41:38] When you look through Trinidad, you
[1:41:39] choose me.
[1:41:41] That alone should make you happy.
[1:41:43] That alone to shout.
[1:41:45] Praise God. Praise God. Amen. I'm an
[1:41:49] heir to all things. It's given to me.
[1:41:51] I'm an air. I can claim everything.
[1:41:54] Watch this. That God promised me. There
[1:41:57] you are.
[1:41:58] How do you get it? This is deep. Just
[1:42:00] remember the scripture talk about
[1:42:01] abundance of grace,
[1:42:03] gift of righteousness. Right? Listen.
[1:42:05] You say it belongs to us. Satan cannot
[1:42:07] hold it. You go to him in
[1:42:11] and I hope this mean more to you now. We
[1:42:13] struck this quote before. You go to him
[1:42:15] in the scriptural authoritative word
[1:42:18] with faith to say it is mine.
[1:42:20] Amen.
[1:42:21] Lay it down. You don't go and say gosh
[1:42:23] devil you move. So
[1:42:26] brothers talk like that.
[1:42:28] You know why
[1:42:31] you tell why? Why you moving? So you
[1:42:34] moving so
[1:42:37] you sure you want to move so
[1:42:40] my my father is he he in charge over all
[1:42:43] you know
[1:42:45] but you are no power.
[1:42:48] You're not even talking like a son
[1:42:49] because your father do you talk like
[1:42:51] that
[1:42:52] he say lay it down with the
[1:42:54] authoritative word with faith and say it
[1:42:56] is mine.
[1:42:57] I like that Satan you lay it down. You
[1:42:59] took it from me, you give it back
[1:43:01] because I am serving notice on you.
[1:43:05] Oh, praise God. Lay it down. So, you
[1:43:07] have to speak with authority.
[1:43:09] Yes, sir.
[1:43:10] All right.
[1:43:12] What did he have to do first? Abram, in
[1:43:13] order to do this, he had to lay his fate
[1:43:15] upon a solid rock foundation, God's
[1:43:18] promised word. He had a little bunch of
[1:43:20] servants, a dozen, a couple of thousand
[1:43:22] armed men, rusty knives and whatnot. And
[1:43:24] he took them and Abraham defeated the
[1:43:26] enemy and brought Lot out because he
[1:43:29] said it's mines. I'm going after what
[1:43:31] belongs to me. And that's why I say when
[1:43:33] you come to service, you come to get a
[1:43:35] revelation of what belongs to you.
[1:43:39] Note not just I believe stuff but in
[1:43:44] what is being spoken. Do you hear what
[1:43:46] belongs to you? Because whatever you
[1:43:49] hear that belongs to you and they can
[1:43:51] say by revelation then you could fight
[1:43:52] for it. In other words, you're fighting
[1:43:54] for what you know is your own.
[1:43:57] If you know peace is yours, you fight
[1:43:58] for it.
[1:43:59] Joy is yours, you fight for it.
[1:44:01] If you believe that frustration and and
[1:44:03] depression is yours because you're
[1:44:05] sinning and in a real terrible position,
[1:44:08] then you have battle in your own mind.
[1:44:10] You have to get out of sin.
[1:44:11] You have to come to true repentance
[1:44:13] because in your mind, you will say,
[1:44:14] "This is justified.
[1:44:15] I supposed to be sick. I supposed and
[1:44:18] and sapping you up like that." Like if
[1:44:20] you some kind of bubbly and just
[1:44:22] slapping you up and you just taking
[1:44:23] licks and you and you like you deserve
[1:44:25] it and Satan and once you say you
[1:44:26] deserve it, Satan help you deserve it
[1:44:28] even more.
[1:44:31] But God is your father.
[1:44:34] Do like the prodal son.
[1:44:36] I will arise. I will go to my father. I
[1:44:39] will say what? Well, you know, daddy,
[1:44:42] you have a space back in the house.
[1:44:46] Just go back where you come from. That's
[1:44:48] not what he said. He said, "I will say I
[1:44:50] I have sinned.
[1:44:53] I am no longer worthy to be
[1:44:55] call your son.
[1:44:57] Make me a higher servant. I prefer to be
[1:45:00] servant now."
[1:45:01] And the and the father receive him with
[1:45:02] abundance of
[1:45:04] grace. Give the Lord some praise.
[1:45:06] Because your son,
[1:45:08] he he brought him back with abundance of
[1:45:09] grace. Watch his older brother get a
[1:45:12] fight when he hear the fatted caffe
[1:45:13] feeding for so long. taken
[1:45:17] eaten
[1:45:18] that somebody put fail. No, he wasn't
[1:45:20] interested.
[1:45:22] He was more concerned that that wretched
[1:45:23] miserable money spending brother of
[1:45:26] mines that spend all the money and he
[1:45:29] was so well received.
[1:45:31] Jesus Jesus is a master teacher.
[1:45:33] All right. When a sinner can see you
[1:45:35] don't have to sin, a lot of people say
[1:45:37] they sin because they have to sin.
[1:45:38] That's a pitiful shape when you say that
[1:45:40] you have to sin. But when you realize
[1:45:42] you don't have to sin anymore,
[1:45:45] see, watch. There are people that stand
[1:45:47] up and curse and laugh in your face and
[1:45:49] call you an idiot. Everything else, they
[1:45:51] are willful sinners. There's no hope for
[1:45:53] them. But that man who does something
[1:45:56] constantly, they don't want to do it. He
[1:45:59] steals, he don't want to. He lies, he
[1:46:02] don't want to. He does thing he doesn't
[1:46:03] want to. He don't want to be a sinner.
[1:46:05] There's hope for him
[1:46:08] if you can let him see what's the truth.
[1:46:11] See, come up to God's promise and lay a
[1:46:14] hold upon faith. Oh, blessed be the name
[1:46:17] of the Lord.
[1:46:18] Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] Glory to God. The scripture we read this
[1:46:21] centurion.
[1:46:23] This centurion, he was looking a long
[1:46:25] time at Jesus.
[1:46:26] Hallelujah.
[1:46:27] He was observing Jesus and seeing Jesus
[1:46:29] operation.
[1:46:30] And when he couldn't take it no more,
[1:46:32] he come to Jesus. He said Lord
[1:46:35] I have a servant inside my house.
[1:46:38] He is sick.
[1:46:39] Now in those times very unusual for a
[1:46:42] man to ask for help for a servant
[1:46:46] because so much people doing servant job
[1:46:47] in them times that if a servant dead is
[1:46:50] next
[1:46:52] you could always get somebody inside of
[1:46:54] there.
[1:46:54] Hallelujah.
[1:46:55] But it goes to show that this centurion
[1:46:57] had a certain quality in him.
[1:46:59] One thing you could see about him, he
[1:47:01] was a humble heart. Amen.
[1:47:02] With a humble soul.
[1:47:04] He had compassion.
[1:47:06] Yes.
[1:47:06] He was a compassionate person.
[1:47:08] And Jesus said, "I will come
[1:47:11] and heal him
[1:47:12] because Jesus is a healer."
[1:47:15] That man said in all humility,
[1:47:16] "Yes."
[1:47:18] What if he had pride?
[1:47:20] Because you have a six-bedroom house
[1:47:21] with a pool on top.
[1:47:23] The third floor
[1:47:25] said, "Jesus are waiting for you." Woo.
[1:47:29] He waiting to demonstrate his success,
[1:47:33] not him. He said, "Lord,
[1:47:37] I am not worthy
[1:47:38] for you to come under my roof
[1:47:40] to speak
[1:47:43] the word
[1:47:44] because I have a revelation.
[1:47:46] I am a centurion.
[1:47:48] I have men under me.
[1:47:50] When I tell them go, they go."
[1:47:52] When I tell them come, they come.
[1:47:53] And I recognize the authority that is
[1:47:56] upon you. Amen.
[1:47:57] Could give you the authority
[1:47:59] to send a word
[1:48:01] and you're going to recreate yourself
[1:48:02] just like that.
[1:48:03] You don't have to come,
[1:48:05] just speak.
[1:48:07] Oh, give the Lord a shout. I feel
[1:48:08] anointing.
[1:48:10] Glory to God.
[1:48:12] You don't have to come.
[1:48:14] Just speak.
[1:48:16] And I know
[1:48:18] he'll be made whole.
[1:48:19] And when Jesus spoke that very hour,
[1:48:23] his servant was made whole. Another
[1:48:26] scripture said when the man was walking
[1:48:27] home, he said, "What time?"
[1:48:29] Yeah. Say if. He said, "What time was he
[1:48:31] healed?"
[1:48:32] It was the same time
[1:48:34] Jesus spoke. The word does pass through
[1:48:38] barriers. The word will pass through
[1:48:40] time zones. The word will pass through
[1:48:43] your body. The word could come to your
[1:48:46] soul. The word don't know distance. It
[1:48:50] don't care how tall you are, how short
[1:48:52] you are. It don't care what pain you in.
[1:48:55] God could heal you today, deliver you
[1:48:57] today, shield you today, free you today.
[1:49:01] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:49:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:06] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:49:09] This word have power. This word have
[1:49:12] power. This word is active. This word is
[1:49:16] real. This word is good. This word can't
[1:49:20] fail.
[1:49:24] [Applause]
[1:49:28] Hallelujah.
[1:49:30] Hallelujah.
[1:49:31] Right with me now. We home stretch.
[1:49:34] God became a sinner.
[1:49:36] Hallelujah.
[1:49:36] Took our sins upon him.
[1:49:38] Yes, sir.
[1:49:38] Knowing no sin
[1:49:40] yet was a sinner because our sins was
[1:49:42] placed on him.
[1:49:43] He become me.
[1:49:44] Hallelujah.
[1:49:45] That I might become him.
[1:49:47] He become a sinner.
[1:49:49] That I might become a son of God. He
[1:49:52] become a sinner
[1:49:53] that you might become a son of God.
[1:49:56] And now we are sons and daughters of God
[1:49:59] because God has made us a kins folk.
[1:50:01] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:50:04] The word was made a human being.
[1:50:07] The word become a kinsman. He become a
[1:50:11] man. He become death. And through that
[1:50:14] death I might become life.
[1:50:16] Through his righteousness I might have
[1:50:19] life. He become poor that I through his
[1:50:23] poverty I might be made rich.
[1:50:27] Who say a child can be rich? He become
[1:50:29] poor that I might be made rich. He
[1:50:33] become what I was so that I might
[1:50:35] through his grace become what he is.
[1:50:38] Are you riding with me now?
[1:50:40] Are you going with me now?
[1:50:42] Now you're going to say what he said.
[1:50:43] The same works I do shall you do also.
[1:50:48] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:50:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] Glory.
[1:50:55] What love the father had bestowed upon
[1:50:57] us.
[1:50:58] That while we were sinners,
[1:51:00] aliens away from God,
[1:51:03] drawn nigh unto God in so much that we
[1:51:05] become sons and daughters of God.
[1:51:07] Not servants.
[1:51:09] Amen.
[1:51:09] Here we go. Brother, the gentile church
[1:51:12] was never a servant.
[1:51:14] And this centurion, he was a gentile.
[1:51:17] And Jesus was so astonished. He
[1:51:19] marveled. He say, "And all Israel and
[1:51:22] never see faith like this."
[1:51:24] That's gentile faith.
[1:51:26] That's the faith that God put in you.
[1:51:28] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:51:36] The Gentile church was never a servant.
[1:51:40] No sir. The gentile church is son and
[1:51:42] daughter. You are sons and daughters of
[1:51:45] God who have received the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:48] Now, sons and daughters, let's go.
[1:51:50] Who has the most power before God?
[1:51:53] What is an angel?
[1:51:55] A servant.
[1:51:56] They are his servants. What are you?
[1:51:58] His son and daughter.
[1:52:00] Who has the most power in heaven then? A
[1:52:03] sinner that's been saved by grace or an
[1:52:06] angel that's standing by his right side?
[1:52:09] It's a big question.
[1:52:11] That's a big question. Hallelujah.
[1:52:14] But the sinner
[1:52:16] that has been saved by grace
[1:52:18] has more authority
[1:52:20] in heaven.
[1:52:21] What you binding on earth
[1:52:24] bong in heaven. Oh, glory to God.
[1:52:27] What you binding
[1:52:29] is bong in heaven.
[1:52:31] What you loosen it is loose in heaven.
[1:52:37] If this don't make you shout,
[1:52:40] you could be dead and don't know it.
[1:52:43] Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] All right.
[1:52:46] Watch this.
[1:52:48] A sinner being saved by grace
[1:52:50] or or or an archangel is standing by his
[1:52:53] right side.
[1:52:53] Hallelujah.
[1:52:54] The sinner
[1:52:55] that's been saved by grace
[1:52:57] has more authority
[1:52:59] in heaven
[1:53:00] than the archangel that stood by his
[1:53:03] side without sin
[1:53:05] because he's a son.
[1:53:07] A son has more authority
[1:53:10] than the servant of God.
[1:53:12] Oh, we forgot what we are.
[1:53:15] We forgot many times what we what made
[1:53:17] us what we are.
[1:53:19] After we become what we are, then we
[1:53:22] forgot how we got there.
[1:53:24] And that's where pride and arrogance
[1:53:26] overtake people.
[1:53:27] You see all time humble God blessing
[1:53:29] them and blessing them and blessing
[1:53:30] them. And afterward you see pride
[1:53:32] running away with them, you know,
[1:53:33] and afterwards pride overtake them.
[1:53:35] arrogance overtake them
[1:53:37] next minute if I didn't work so hard I
[1:53:38] didn't get what I get afterwards they
[1:53:40] throwing off God now
[1:53:42] they start to go power the money the
[1:53:44] money trip them money has trip people
[1:53:45] you know send them totally nuts
[1:53:48] and afterwards they just go on they go
[1:53:49] on the money tip them over
[1:53:52] and go looking for somebody the more he
[1:53:53] bless
[1:53:54] the more humble he become
[1:53:57] all right all right
[1:53:59] question which has the greatest
[1:54:00] authority
[1:54:02] an angel from heaven or an angel at the
[1:54:05] pulpit.
[1:54:06] Which has it? The angel at the pulpit.
[1:54:10] Hear the scripture for it. Because Paul
[1:54:12] said, "If a angel from heaven comes and
[1:54:16] preach any other gospel to you,
[1:54:18] that which I've already preached, let
[1:54:20] him be a cursed."
[1:54:21] So the angel anointed with the Holy
[1:54:23] Spirit and with the word stand next to
[1:54:25] God
[1:54:26] in heaven with authority.
[1:54:28] Jesus said, "All power
[1:54:31] in heaven and earth
[1:54:32] is given into my hand." Amen.
[1:54:34] Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind in
[1:54:36] heaven.
[1:54:37] Whatever you loose on earth, I'll loose
[1:54:38] in heaven. Oh, if the great holy church,
[1:54:41] this is a big one.
[1:54:43] Can only realize its power to do these
[1:54:45] things.
[1:54:46] But there is so much doubt and fear and
[1:54:48] trembling wondering if it will, could it
[1:54:50] happen? As long as that exists, the
[1:54:52] church can never stand upright. But when
[1:54:54] every talk of fear is vanished,
[1:54:56] my God, my God, oh glory.
[1:54:59] So, let me say this to you now. On your
[1:55:02] way to power, you pick up authority.
[1:55:09] Power and authority is not the same
[1:55:11] thing.
[1:55:12] Because the policeman, the new recruit,
[1:55:15] the thin guy
[1:55:16] and the uniform fresh and starts good.
[1:55:20] As thin as he is,
[1:55:22] as small and skinny as he is.
[1:55:24] If he step out on the street
[1:55:25] and hold up his hand like that, you have
[1:55:27] to stop.
[1:55:28] big truck, tanker truck, gasoline truck,
[1:55:32] whatever you're driving have to stop
[1:55:34] because a uniform man
[1:55:36] raise his hands
[1:55:37] and you have to take a pause
[1:55:40] for that cause. So, give the Lord some
[1:55:41] praises.
[1:55:42] He does not have power to stop the
[1:55:44] vehicle, but he have authority.
[1:55:46] Oh, glory to God. And when you put on
[1:55:48] your uniform
[1:55:49] and you're putting it on today,
[1:55:51] you ain't get power yet,
[1:55:53] but you're picking up on your
[1:55:56] shout out to her. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:55:59] praises.
[1:56:00] Glory to God.
[1:56:02] You have authority.
[1:56:04] This is what the devil don't want you to
[1:56:06] know.
[1:56:07] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:56:10] In my name.
[1:56:12] May be seated.
[1:56:13] Jesus put it there. You know,
[1:56:15] it's in print. You know,
[1:56:17] he say in your name. You know,
[1:56:19] he say in my name. You know,
[1:56:21] every devil in hell
[1:56:22] recognizes that name.
[1:56:24] That name of Jesus. Every devil in hell
[1:56:27] knows that name.
[1:56:28] He said do it in my name. You can't go
[1:56:31] in your name. Satan don't recognize your
[1:56:33] name. But when he hear Jesus name,
[1:56:36] oh glory to God. But the bride will have
[1:56:39] more than that. The bride will get a new
[1:56:41] name. Oh, give the Lord a shout. She
[1:56:44] would speak and it going to happen. Give
[1:56:46] the Lord some praises. My God. My God.
[1:56:49] Let me see how I can wrap up here.
[1:56:54] When every talk of fear is vanished
[1:56:56] and the Holy Spirit is completely in
[1:56:58] control of the church,
[1:57:00] then all fears are gone and that church
[1:57:02] has the power. Why? They have everything
[1:57:04] that heaven owns behind them.
[1:57:06] They are ambassadors of the throne.
[1:57:09] An ambassador of Christ has the
[1:57:13] authority.
[1:57:15] An ambassador represents a nation, a
[1:57:17] country in another nation. Amen.
[1:57:19] So we we from the kingdom of God
[1:57:22] and we in Satan's Eden.
[1:57:23] Amen.
[1:57:24] And you are an ambassador from heaven
[1:57:26] representing another kingdom.
[1:57:29] Hallelujah. In your country have laws.
[1:57:31] In your country have power,
[1:57:33] but you are in another country,
[1:57:35] another kingdom. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:57:37] praises.
[1:57:38] And in your country, you have backups.
[1:57:40] You have backings because they send you
[1:57:43] as an ambassador.
[1:57:44] And the whole of heaven is behind you.
[1:57:46] The whole of heaven is behind me.
[1:57:49] An ambassador have the complete support
[1:57:52] of the country he represents.
[1:57:55] The country he comes from, the armies
[1:57:58] behind that man, the powers that be is
[1:58:00] behind that man. And I'm saying the
[1:58:02] angel of the Lord encamp around
[1:58:05] those ambassadors. Oh, glory to God.
[1:58:07] Hallelujah.
[1:58:09] You are not ordinary. The devil's a
[1:58:11] liar. He want you to see yourself as
[1:58:12] ordinary. You are not ordinary. You are
[1:58:14] ambassadors of the throne.
[1:58:17] God's representatives on the earth.
[1:58:20] Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] Glory to God.
[1:58:25] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:27] Are we going good
[1:58:32] talking about Jesus
[1:58:34] uh was taken to the mountain and they
[1:58:36] adopted and so on. He said that's the
[1:58:37] thing that God will do to his son here
[1:58:38] on earth someday. He will call you aside
[1:58:41] church if you'll only obey him and stay
[1:58:43] on the word and believe it. He will
[1:58:45] place he God will place into the church
[1:58:49] before the coming of Jesus Christ. He
[1:58:51] will place into the church all the
[1:58:53] powers that Christ had in him will be in
[1:58:55] the church.
[1:58:57] Could we give the Lord a shout at that?
[1:58:59] Did you hear that promise?
[1:59:00] We are talking about no mini son of man,
[1:59:02] no next son of man, no new son of man,
[1:59:04] no kind of son of man at all. He said
[1:59:06] all the power that Christ had will be in
[1:59:08] the church in the last days. Not no
[1:59:09] talk, no no mystery talk, none of that.
[1:59:13] Give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. The
[1:59:15] prophecy is all the power.
[1:59:18] Hey.
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:22] Am I crazy?
[1:59:24] No, I am not.
[1:59:29] The Bible prophesied as Janice and
[1:59:31] Jambre which Moses so shall be in the
[1:59:35] last days.
[1:59:38] May be seated.
[1:59:39] What happened with Jambre?
[1:59:42] And Moses come and Moses want to
[1:59:45] demonstrate power.
[1:59:46] Aaron th
[1:59:48] Moses saying that in a nice way
[1:59:53] turn to snake Johnson show what we could
[1:59:56] do.
[1:59:59] Magician
[2:00:01] they threw down sticks to
[2:00:03] turn to snake. In other words, you had
[2:00:05] that
[2:00:07] too.
[2:00:09] Not quot versus co
[2:00:16] Not text versus text
[2:00:18] as Janice and Jamb. Oh, what what book?
[2:00:21] What from
[2:00:23] spinning page? You know, JP spl
[2:00:30] turn the water into blood.
[2:00:33] Them fellas do it too.
[2:00:39] Bring forth frogs.
[2:00:41] Them fellas blew it too.
[2:00:43] Round three. Equal.
[2:00:46] Both of them. Tick tick tick. When Moses
[2:00:51] called for the dust to become fleas and
[2:00:53] flies and lies, them fell say that the
[2:00:56] finger of God
[2:00:58] cuz we can handle that. We that that
[2:01:01] that above our pay grade. We we can't do
[2:01:03] that. them fell that the hand of God
[2:01:06] that the thing you got
[2:01:10] licks you know
[2:01:11] if you don't understand how this battle
[2:01:13] end up you'll get blows you know
[2:01:15] if you don't know where you act when you
[2:01:16] see that brother fell thick you run out
[2:01:19] you know Moses stood to the ground
[2:01:21] and his snake eat
[2:01:23] two snakes as somebody say his rod
[2:01:25] become heavier
[2:01:28] what whatever power that was going he
[2:01:31] absorb it he just got heavier rod
[2:01:34] Man, they lost two snakes and Moses have
[2:01:36] a extra one, two, extra.
[2:01:39] What I'm saying is this, that is how the
[2:01:41] battle going to be.
[2:01:43] Oh, this end time battle will be a
[2:01:45] display of power.
[2:01:47] Powerl
[2:01:49] power.
[2:01:50] Power came into the beast.
[2:01:52] Power comes into the bride.
[2:01:53] The beast have an image and the bride
[2:01:55] have an image.
[2:01:56] Oh, glory to God. And the image of the
[2:01:58] beast have to get empowered. And this
[2:02:00] image is second Peter 1 4-7. That image
[2:02:04] is inside of you. That image have a
[2:02:07] dynamic power to come into that image.
[2:02:09] It will be the image of God versus the
[2:02:12] image of Satan. Lucifer will finally
[2:02:15] achieve to be as God on this earth. He
[2:02:18] will be the god of this evil age. But
[2:02:20] the bride of Jesus Christ. Just as Satan
[2:02:23] went in Satan, just as Satan went in
[2:02:25] God's Eden and throw it down. God make
[2:02:28] sure you have a special woman on the
[2:02:30] earth,
[2:02:31] the bride of Jesus Christ to be in
[2:02:33] Satan's Eden.
[2:02:34] We're going to rock this world. We're
[2:02:37] going to shake hell's kingdom.
[2:02:39] Oh, glory to God. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:43] Glory to God. The bride will be a super
[2:02:46] church,
[2:02:47] a super race as we near the headstone.
[2:02:51] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:02:53] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[2:02:56] And a little more again.
[2:02:57] All the power that Christ had in him
[2:03:00] will be in the church.
[2:03:01] All that God was, he poured into Jesus.
[2:03:04] All that Jesus was, he poured into the
[2:03:06] church.
[2:03:07] God wanted his work done, he sent it
[2:03:09] into his son.
[2:03:10] The son wanted the work done, sent it
[2:03:12] into the church. At that day,
[2:03:15] you will know that I'm in the father,
[2:03:17] the father in me, I in you, you in me.
[2:03:20] at that day because the same power of
[2:03:23] God that was Jehovah God rest in Jesus
[2:03:25] Christ. The same power that rested in
[2:03:28] Jesus Christ rest in placed sons in the
[2:03:31] body of Christ.
[2:03:32] Placing a son take him out to a certain
[2:03:35] place. Have a ceremony. Place him
[2:03:37] positionally what he is in the body of
[2:03:40] Christ. Then that person has the
[2:03:42] authority. What he hire is hired. What
[2:03:45] he fire is fired. He could sign the
[2:03:47] check. Oh God have mercy. Oh, glory to
[2:03:50] God. The authority is coming back
[2:03:53] because Adam had authority. Because Adam
[2:03:55] had the book, he could tell the mountain
[2:03:57] move here. He could tell the lion and
[2:03:59] the lamb lie down there. Oh, glory to
[2:04:01] God. But when Adam lost the book, he
[2:04:03] lost the power. He lost the authority.
[2:04:05] He lost the dominion. But it coming
[2:04:06] back. God said, "Let us make man in our
[2:04:09] own image and likeness. Let that man
[2:04:11] have dominion." The prophet brought back
[2:04:13] the image and the likeness of God. Oh,
[2:04:16] give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:04:19] Seven living voices, seven thunders,
[2:04:22] seven voices, seven mysteries, seven
[2:04:26] virtues, thunder and praise God, the
[2:04:29] image back on the earth, the devil is in
[2:04:32] trouble. We give the Lord some praises.
[2:04:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:37] Glory to God. Let me say this. If you
[2:04:41] count me as a fanatic from this night
[2:04:42] on, that very same thing I'm speaking of
[2:04:45] will be done.
[2:04:46] There'll be a power put into the church.
[2:04:48] And now coming in that the Holy Spirit
[2:04:50] will so anoint the people.
[2:04:51] I see the Holy Spirit anoint you this
[2:04:53] morning.
[2:04:53] So anoint the people. Then they will
[2:04:55] speak the word. It will create itself
[2:04:57] like that. We haven't seen powers like
[2:05:00] like coming into the church now. I know
[2:05:02] it for a fact.
[2:05:03] So what Abraham saw we haven't seen it
[2:05:05] as yet.
[2:05:06] Say unto this mountain be moved. Do
[2:05:08] doubt in your heart but believe what you
[2:05:10] have said shall come to pass.
[2:05:11] You can have what you said. the placing
[2:05:13] of the church in position where the
[2:05:17] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:20] comes into his church. Then the critics
[2:05:23] mouth will be bishop.
[2:05:24] Amen.
[2:05:24] Right now
[2:05:28] the dogs back in
[2:05:30] as we wind up our glass and the air
[2:05:31] condition.
[2:05:33] The dogs had to keep on barking.
[2:05:35] But they can't shut up just yet.
[2:05:37] It will take the power
[2:05:38] of the Holy Ghost. Notice it will be a
[2:05:41] short time. Jesus come right off the
[2:05:43] mountain, went straight to Calvary. It
[2:05:45] won't last long, but it will be here.
[2:05:50] There's a few more again and we close.
[2:05:52] Almost there.
[2:05:54] Brother Brandon, spiritual food and due
[2:05:56] season. Do you see what I'm trying to
[2:05:58] get to you? I spoke with you pretty
[2:06:01] plain this morning. Don't you see the
[2:06:04] authority of the living God in the
[2:06:05] living church,
[2:06:06] the bride? Listen to these words now.
[2:06:09] The sick are healed,
[2:06:11] the dead are raised up, the cripples
[2:06:13] walk, the blind see. The gospel goes
[2:06:16] forth in its power. For the message and
[2:06:18] the messenger are the same.
[2:06:21] Then he said these words, the word is in
[2:06:25] the church in the person.
[2:06:32] That's a big one.
[2:06:34] In other words, he's saying you are
[2:06:36] seeing what you see around here.
[2:06:39] about I'm trying to get it plain to you
[2:06:41] this morning. Don't you see the
[2:06:43] authority of the living God? See, he
[2:06:44] explaining why it is so dead.
[2:06:47] Why the sick are being healed, the dead
[2:06:49] are raised, the cripples walk, the blind
[2:06:52] see, the he said the message and the
[2:06:54] messenger are the same.
[2:06:57] Because the word is in the church in
[2:07:01] in the person.
[2:07:03] What did I first say when I come up
[2:07:05] here? Hallelujah.
[2:07:05] I tell you the word is God
[2:07:08] and Jesus is the personification of the
[2:07:10] word itself.
[2:07:11] Or he is the word made flesh.
[2:07:13] That is the person of the word.
[2:07:14] So when the person of the word is here,
[2:07:17] the sick is healed.
[2:07:18] Blind see,
[2:07:19] deaf heal, crippled walk, dead raised
[2:07:23] because the word is here in its person.
[2:07:26] It would be evident the person is here.
[2:07:29] Oh, give the Lord some praises. Give the
[2:07:32] Lord a shout. He said there will be a
[2:07:34] church with Jesus walking in it. The
[2:07:37] shout of the king
[2:07:40] will be in the camp. Give the Lord a
[2:07:42] shout on that one.
[2:07:51] You're almost done.
[2:07:54] Pet come up.
[2:08:00] Gal,
[2:08:07] [Applause]
[2:08:17] let the old man drink some water.
[2:08:22] You didn't expect to hear that, right?
[2:08:25] Say, let young man drink water.
[2:08:29] All right, brother.
[2:08:32] Now listen.
[2:08:33] The least of his believers,
[2:08:36] no matter who little, whatever you are,
[2:08:41] the least of his believers in him has
[2:08:45] all evil under them.
[2:08:52] 30% say amen. Some still wondering if
[2:08:54] they should say amen to this
[2:08:56] because they're feeling less than the
[2:08:57] least.
[2:08:58] Hallelujah.
[2:08:59] Let me read it again for all the least
[2:09:01] ones inside
[2:09:03] who think you're the least or who see
[2:09:05] yourself as the least.
[2:09:07] The least of his believers in him
[2:09:11] has all evil under them.
[2:09:14] Look, Christ is the head of the body. Is
[2:09:15] that right?
[2:09:16] Wherever the head is, the body with it.
[2:09:18] Where my head goes, my I take my body
[2:09:20] with it.
[2:09:20] Where Jesus is, the church is with him.
[2:09:22] He don't get out of his word. He stays
[2:09:25] in his word
[2:09:26] and watches over it to make it manifest.
[2:09:30] His church is with him.
[2:09:33] And you look and say, "But brother
[2:09:35] Brandham, I'm the least one." That's the
[2:09:37] souls of his feet.
[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:44] But remember,
[2:09:45] he triumph with you.
[2:09:47] He triumph with you
[2:09:49] over it. Even you are the souls of his
[2:09:52] feet.
[2:09:53] Every sickness, every devil, every
[2:09:57] power, even death itself is under your
[2:10:00] feet under you. Glory.
[2:10:03] I don't feel like a 52 this morning.
[2:10:06] This is the truth.
[2:10:07] If I can just get this church to see
[2:10:10] that. But Ram said, "If I could just get
[2:10:13] this church to see that, brother, we'll
[2:10:15] be triumphant church.
[2:10:18] Believers
[2:10:19] in him,
[2:10:21] all evil is under him."
[2:10:23] Oh, glory to God.
[2:10:25] You listen to this one. I'm about to
[2:10:27] close.
[2:10:28] You say, "Brother Brandham, I have no
[2:10:30] power." Neither do I.
[2:10:33] I do have any power. Well, Brother
[2:10:35] Brandham, I'm a weakling. So am I.
[2:10:38] But I am not dependent upon my strength.
[2:10:41] It ain't my strength.
[2:10:42] I'm depending on my authority.
[2:10:47] My authority given to me.
[2:10:49] It is not me that is strong. I ain't
[2:10:52] strong.
[2:10:54] Oh, glory to God.
[2:10:56] As you go into power, you pick up the
[2:10:58] authority.
[2:10:59] But power coming.
[2:11:01] You shall receive power after the Holy
[2:11:03] Ghost come upon you.
[2:11:04] Oh, give the Lord a shout. You're going
[2:11:07] drunk to power and along your way,
[2:11:09] you're picking on authority. We picking
[2:11:11] up some this morning. That's why I
[2:11:14] preaching this this morning. The
[2:11:16] authority of the word and the bride.
[2:11:18] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:11:21] Just the word. Just the word. Just the
[2:11:22] word. In my name, they shall cast out
[2:11:25] devils. Just the word. Just the word.
[2:11:27] They shall lay hands upon the sick and
[2:11:29] they shall recover. Just the word.
[2:11:34] [Music]
[2:11:37] Brother, you be seated.
[2:11:39] Oh man,
[2:11:41] this is the very end here now.
[2:11:42] Musicians,
[2:11:47] let's say there's traffic coming on the
[2:11:50] street at Fort and Broadway in
[2:11:51] Louisville. Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
[2:11:53] just fast as they can. 60 miles per hour
[2:11:55] across the street. Everybody rushing,
[2:11:57] hustling. One little man walks out
[2:11:59] there,
[2:12:00] raises his hand and brother slide.
[2:12:04] That little man hasn't got enough power
[2:12:05] to stop one of those cars,
[2:12:07] but he got authority.
[2:12:08] It ain't his power. Well, if one of the
[2:12:11] cars hit him, it'll demolish him. But
[2:12:12] let's but let him raise his hands.
[2:12:14] Drivers of the car recognize that
[2:12:16] uniform. Oh, brother.
[2:12:17] They recognize that uniform. Break
[2:12:20] slide. Why? Look at his authority.
[2:12:22] Look what's behind him. The whole system
[2:12:25] of the city is behind him. The law
[2:12:27] enforcement of the city is behind him.
[2:12:29] That uniform represents that. He is
[2:12:32] different because he's an officer.
[2:12:34] He ought to stop. One of them cars go
[2:12:36] zoom and take him like that. They better
[2:12:38] not try it. What's behind him? They will
[2:12:41] squeak brakes and slide. He don't have
[2:12:43] to say a thing.
[2:12:45] It's all behind him.
[2:12:46] He's weak, but what's behind him? He's
[2:12:48] dressed up in a uniform.
[2:12:50] He's not an idol, but but an individual
[2:12:53] ought to be dressed. Let us put on the
[2:12:54] whole armor of God. The helmet of
[2:12:56] salvation, the great shield of the
[2:12:58] faith. Oh, glory to God. It ain't a
[2:13:01] little man standing there. He's an
[2:13:03] ordinary man. But what does he
[2:13:05] represent? Our armor is Jesus Christ.
[2:13:09] All devils slide their brakes when they
[2:13:11] see that. When they see the full armor
[2:13:13] of God, the true baptism of the Holy
[2:13:16] Ghost, seeing it coming straight down
[2:13:18] from the throne of God, dressed in the
[2:13:21] full armor, his resurrection, not that
[2:13:23] you are strong, you are nothing. It's
[2:13:26] what's behind you. You are dead. You
[2:13:28] join the army. You join the police
[2:13:30] force. You're going to keep the law to
[2:13:33] control these devils. Oh, give the Lord
[2:13:35] a shout. You are on the police force.
[2:13:38] The whole thing behind you. You are
[2:13:40] reckon dead. You are nothing. You
[2:13:41] couldn't stop nothing. But your
[2:13:43] authority has been given you because you
[2:13:46] are raised and sitting in heavenly
[2:13:47] places in Christ Jesus. The devil
[2:13:50] recognizes that everything sight is
[2:13:53] breaks. Oh, glory. Give the Lord. Let's
[2:13:55] all stand and give the God some praises.
[2:13:58] The authority of the word in the bride.
[2:14:01] God has released authority. The
[2:14:03] authority of God is here this morning.
[2:14:05] The word of God. Let's just praise him.
[2:14:06] Father God, we thank you for your
[2:14:08] presence, Lord. We thank you for the
[2:14:11] anointing and your presence and power.
[2:14:13] May you pour out your people. And the
[2:14:14] prophet cried out, "If I could just get
[2:14:16] my church to see this, if I could get
[2:14:19] the church to see this, that every devil
[2:14:21] is under their feet." Granted, Lord,
[2:14:23] have the preeminences. May open up their
[2:14:25] minds. may change your thinking, change
[2:14:28] your lives in Jesus name I ask it.
