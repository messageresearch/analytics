robledo from the usa i want to really thank the brethren for their sacrifice and for blessing god's people around the world and it almost appears as if they were in the same room get connected with the same sort of notes but with such a blend of the holy spirit bringing that you're in a battle and we in a battle this morning technical one the computers give out so we will have some really uh so we started late we sorry about that but these things do happen but before you have a special tip i want to play for you this morning before we do that i want to read something brother branham says this is from super saiyan he said let us work lord for we know we have much more time to work we see time closing in soon we are looking for the angel that will set his foot on the land praise the lord praise the lord we haven't we haven't much time much more time to work we see time closing in soon we are looking for that angel that will set his foot on the land and on the sea and raise up his hand and swear by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more said at that time the mystery of god should be finished we understand now father that god's threefold mystery has been made known to us and we understand and we are looking now so he said god threefold mystery has been made known to us and we are looking now for those for those mysterious standards that came out of heaven in the book of revelation that was sealed in the back of the book revealed to us o lord the things that we need for the battle ahead of us oh praise god so he was looking for the seven thunders praise god for the battle that lays ahead it will take those seven thunders to deal with that devil that's why he said wait till them seven thunders utter the voices of that group that could take the wood and hand it here it will slice and cut isn't it isn't that right oh praise the name of the lost i thought i was shared with you so i i was on tuesday night i was at ephesians tabernacle pastorate and george who stood a brother uh about tumelo madiba from south africa uh first time i kind of met him and it was quite early fine and i thought it would be a blessing for you today to share that service and that service is an in a divine introduction talking about the introduction of jesus christ and you know the amazing thing about it sometimes you hear services and you don't hear about jesus you hear everything else about jesus christ and what we're supposed to be seeing is jesus christ and one day god going to introduce him in you he said he will let it be made known among men if you try to hide him he will say look at here look look the christ here in other words he would be veiled inside of you that is our promise christ in you the hope of glory so we want to go straight into the tape by the grace of god i know we have some real technical challenges this morning but we by the grace of god we believe that things will not work out by god's grace we're going straight into it amen god bless you praise the lord [Music] of jesus christ how many were blessed last night [Applause] how many came with big containers this evening [Applause] i just pray for my voice god will undertake amen and just say special greetings to the ministers who are here we appreciate them amen as we turn to the book of john [Music] the first chapter from verse 29 until verse 33 i want to speak on a divine introduction a divine introduction the next day john sees jesus coming unto him and say they behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is the ego of whom i said after me cometh amen which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifested to israel therefore he might come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it about upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same satan to me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i sow and bear record that this is the son of god as we bow hate gracious even the father you are our god you loved us even before we could love you you found us before we could find you and heavenly father we are here to worship you we are not ashamed to call you our god we are not ashamed to testify of your greatness to our colleagues our friends and our family there is none like thee you are such a wealthy god and worthy of every praise we thank you for sending malachi 4 in the end time we thank you for the message of the hour and we thank you for the anointing of the hour dear god may you bless the reading of the weight and there are ministers that are here fellow ministers fellow laborers in the gospel i pray for them their churches their ministries you please do a special blessing upon them i pray for brother george for arranging these meetings may you bless him and may you bless him with his office bearers and may you bless the local assembly may you blessed your efforts city of god as we commit everything to you in the name of jesus christ amen while you take your seats we are appreciating the lord it was a day before yesterday we spoke about a divine handover ceremony then last night we spoke about our divine origin and this evening we want to speak about a divine introduction hallelujah are you here this evening amen now there is a quotation i remember i mentioned last night that when god sends a message he already has people in his mind who are going to believe the message when jesus died on the cross god didn't just allow jesus to die on the cross and maybe thought people may feel pity for him and believe him before jesus could go to the cross god exactly knew the people that were going to receive jesus when god sent brother branham he had people in his mind that were going to believe in brother branham god doesn't operate on chances god operates on predestination now in this message what is the attraction on the mountain paragraph 35 the prophet of god says but in the midst of all of it through every church age and every prophet that had been and would be there's going to be a certain amount of people that's predestined to hear that message and they will follow it those ignore the crowds hallelujah they ignore the criticism of the unbeliever what does it mean it means when god sends the message there are people that are predestinated to hear the message but there will be the crowds and there will be the critics but these people that are protested will not focus on the critics they will not focus on the crowds they will focus on the message and i say in the end time we don't focus on the crowds we don't focus on the critics we focus on the message [Applause] they've got one thing to do that's believe and to get every bit of it they can and soak it in like mary who set at the feet of jesus are those people in the building tonight are there people in the building that are ignoring the crowds that are ignoring the criticism of unbelievers that are following the message unconditionally i hope we are together this evening now in the unveiling of god i'm just laying my foundation here paragraph 22. there is a reason why i'm reading these quotations before i get into the main course the unveiling of god paragraph 22 brother branham says and each time if you take the tapes and listen and i hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what that god has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out so it's not brother means he doesn't use a plain language you've got to read between the lines see it's a thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin it might thin down it might bring some to go out and some to leave and some to ponder over but that's done purposely it must be done that way so the prophet says god is not obligated to make things more just plain sometimes we're going to say certain things purposefully so that others it may thin down it may bring some to go out and some to leave and some to ponder but it's done purposefully so what i'm simply saying when you are in the message you must have revelation without revelation you are not going to stay alone because god is going to say certain things that requires not understanding but revelation most people that have left the message they lacked revelation they had the intellectual conception of the message but they liked revelation but some of us we are remaining because we've got to the revelation remember when the lord jesus christ says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you are worthy of me he was not obligated to explain what he meant mostly left and the 12th remained and after they remained you would have thought maybe he would make made it easier he turns around and say why are you remaining why don't you go like the rest of them are with me i mean logically as a minister if a crowd leaves you and you remain with you you want to encourage them and say at least you guys are remaining but not the lord jesus christ he turns around and says why are you remaining why don't you follow them because he wanted to test why are they remaining but peter said where can we go because peter hated the revelation and tonight we say where can we go we can go back to all the denominations we are not chickens we are not returning back to the chicken vineyard we took a flight and we are not retaining town are you here this evening [Applause] i hope we are together i want to speak about a divine introduction and i want to look at the commission of john and look at the commission of willem branham amen william branham received to the commission as john was there as john the baptist was the forerunner of christ in his first coming your message shall be a forerunner in his second coming and a lot of times and by the way we are not expecting another man after brother branham eight messengers and scriptures there was only seven stars so if you want to become another star you will treat you with suspicion because jesus brother branham never came to introduce another man he came to introduce christ eliezer never introduced another man he introduced isaac so if you think brother branham was introducing you you are wrong you have read it poorly you need to read again from brother branham is christ i do not believe that we don't want chance takers in the message now i want us to go and look at this maybe as i said received an angelic visitation gabriel told him you are favored among women and you shall conceive the thing that you shall conceive shall be of the holy ghost and after mary received that visitation she was told about the same visitation that elizabeth received then mary went to visit elizabeth and when they quoted there they had a fellowship about the angelic visitation now mary and elizabeth were related they were relatives they were first cases and g and john were six months senior to jesus then mary elizabeth gave birth the first and after mary gave birth to jesus and the two visited to each other i would imagine jesus and john crawled together i would imagine there are some clues that john had that were handed down to jesus because john and jesus were relatives [Music] but later on john goes into a ministry and he determines that i will introduce the messiah hallelujah and he disrupts the religious order of the day and people are coming out of their churches they say the messiah is coming and john is going to introduce the messiah and john kept on saying i don't know him but when i will know him i will introduce him and the time came when john introduced the messiah then he introduced his cousin [Music] there are tense of john where he's preaching i don't know him there is spoken weight of john where he says i don't know him but jordan introduces a man that he played with a man that he crawled with johnny introduces his own relative as the messiah tell me if you were in john's church where are you going to stay brothers are your ministers are you here i can imagine ministers having ministers meeting but here he said he doesn't know him but now he introduced the very man that he was playing with john is lying that's what they would have said if there was internet during that time they would have created websites john de la are you still with me the messiah that johnny introduced was his own cousin i want you i want that to sink in so that you understand that when god delivers his weight he is not obligated to any man except those that receive it by revelation [Applause] i hope we are together it was of course the split in the church some would have said he lied we are no longer coming to church here we've got it unaligned he said he doesn't know who the messiah will be but he introduced his own cousin it's a family business some would have preached we will never fall for that family business we came out of there not knowing that it was the very messiah now i want us to go and look why would john say i did not know him and yet he grew up with jesus and i want us to look at the first coming the introduction of the first coming and see even the introduction in the second coming if the first coming required revelation the second coming will require revelation i hope we are together now let's come to this maybe before i read this when you read the life of jesus it speaks about when he was born and how he was dedicated in the temple later how he was in the temple at the age of 12 years and later after 12 years we heard nothing about jesus the only time we hear about jesus again is when he is 30 years 18 years of jesus life is not in the bible the bible is silent about 18 years of jesus life are you with me i hope we are together now let's get into the business of the day god's gifts always find to their places paragraph 93. the prophet says the brothers are this evening i would want quotations because it's good when people see what we read about amen they say not brother money is that a new spoken weight no it's the very one that i found in trinidad now 93 now notice and after them the wise men identifying him what he would be and we find through the scripture that's exactly what he was deity in savings for death what for dieting service to god for death jesus was deity in service for death to redeem the world but what did the world do they refused it they rejected it why some of them a big part of them did that because of this because he did die they said he couldn't be deity and die he couldn't be deity and die this is where even the muslims have got a problem that how can you say jesus is god but he died now the prophet says the man the man the body was not idiot the body the man the body was not a deity but deity was in the boat this body has to perish now let's pause here for a while that means when john played with jesus he took him as just a man he did not know that jesus was more than a man he played with him as a man but what made john now to recognize jesus as the messiah is when he saw the deity in the body william branham and i have said many times even here last night william branham's minister was the great test for what is the was the most difficult ministry john's ministry was easier because god said you will introduce the messiah but it was john and jesus two police but in the end time god says to william branham we want to introduce the messiah but this time he will not come in another body he will use your body with branham so it was easy for john to say behold the lamb of god but it was difficult for william branham to say he's here and he was going to ask where hallelujah so william had to speak in parables so that the bride can read between the lines william brennaman was naughty son of man william brennan was a son of man veiling this son of man revealing this kind of man within a son of man [Applause] we're gonna have a good time this evening no matter my voice we're going to define that we're going to have a good time now i want us to follow this thought i like it when brother george was here he says god sometimes will lead you to certain avenues and you need to go and search in those avenues now when brother abraham says and this is where we want to explain to the muslims to the hindus to everyone when we say jesus christ is god what do we mean because they get confused because they say how can you say it's god but he was born how can you say he was god but he was tired how can you say he was god but he died god can never be born expected a amen human than that god can never be a baby we're going to get into things here relax jesus learned how to speak as a baby god cannot learn how to speak as a baby i am glad you are coming on the edge of your seat and you say where is he going don't forget the body is not in the deity but the deity was in the body you cannot kill the deity you cannot give birth to the deity the deity has got no beginning and the deity shall ever never have an end but the body can have the beginning and the body can have an end are we gonna have a good time and this will help the catholic as well because they think mary was the mother of jesus god cannot have a mother but the body can have a mother do you believe brother branham because i'm going to read quotations here now i'm glad i'm preaching to ephesians tabernacle ephesians brother broom says it was a scriptural historian's church there are certain things that you can't preach to the corinthians but the efficient material you can preach to and i believe the entire right in the end time is the efficient material because we must have another efficiency god is perfected in three joshua's deficient book and paul comes with efficient book in the end time you must have the third episode [Applause] now listen here in the message paradox paragraph 279 i'm glad i'm preaching this message brother james because i wanted to relax now brother branham says are you always in the quotation all right he says look here speaking of mary she said your father and i have sought you for day and night with tears she discredited her first testimony because she was saying joseph wasn't the father but now i say your father and i were looking for you she called to joseph his father and we know joseph was not the father now look at this 12 year old boy not knowing what he said he was just a boy but he was the weight see he said knowing what i must be about my father's business see the weight correcting the error the word will always correct the error see she was giving testimony after he was raised up it was all over now see your father and i have sought you she said she had conceived this child by the holy ghost and then calling joseph the father and this little boy 12 year old child no wisdom at all why but just a 12 year old 12 12 year old boy the father didn't trail in him at that time and we're reading quotation here is that to the message of the hour the father didn't dwell in him at that time because hallelujah because he come on the day when he baptized me [Applause] he saw the spirit coming down and went into him but look this little 12 year old boy being the weight he was born the anointed one see to be [Music] do you see every weight is there for a reason to be the anointed one and then he was knowing he knows that i must be about my father's business we said the body was not the deity but the deity was in the boat brother branham said at 12 years the father was not in him yet [Music] hallelujah john knew jesus john was raised with jesus but what john was waiting for was waiting for something to come into the body to identify the body as long as there was nothing coming into the body the body was ordinary for 18 years the bible says nothing about jesus but he was around we thank god for the prophet let's go and check what the prophet says about those 18 years in the message jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 3 0. the prophet says and with such a shifting condition as we are today how can faith rest itself you've got to come back to the bible back to the truth when jesus a carpenter's son physically speaking when he come to the fda that's all he was known of the day that when john baptized him god vindicated him god spoke from the heavens and john saw him john saw him john saw him coming in the form of a tower and certainly this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to drive the right translation there is in home and place to join in jesus immediately anointed with god he was just a man oh come on he was a man till that time but now he becomes the god man now his mother and trusted john's cousin now he's the messiah the boy now is anointed in the unveiling of god brother says anointing is a person god it's a direct quotation are you still with me now now somebody says wait a minute brother madiva but when jesus was born he was called emmanuel which means god with us so when you say the father came into him at the river jordan what do you mean because he was born he was immanuel now you've got to understand the language and the potential the potential i am not in south africa now am i correct but if somebody gets lost and comes into the street i stay in protea avenue if somebody comes into my street and maybe storms by my neighbor's house and say where is madiba where are they going to point they're not going to bring their dream without they're going to bring their what even though i'm not in my house it doesn't change the fact that it is my house even if i'm not in the house it is still my house and when i live trinidad i am returning back to my house one did you find it behold i will send my messenger it's joy and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to the temple is not to the lord it's not the lord but the temple is of the lord are you here the lord that you seek whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold you shall come save the lord of hosts jesus was the temple of god do we agree and the lord that is the sword suddenly came into his temple i hope we are together here now let's come to this there is a scripture that i want us to read my brother isaiah 9 6. if you have found it you can say amen isaiah 9 6 it says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is giving and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace now when you read this scripture like a newspaper you're going to make the body the deity when the prophet says the bible is not the deity but the deity was in the body can we read the scripture again this time not like a newspaper but by revelation for other people that understand english in the building are they going to help us with english for unto us a child is born is that a past tense present tense future tense is what present tense for unto us a child is about present tense i will do agree unto us a sign is given is that future tense or present tense then and the government shall be upon his shoulder is that present tense or future tense hallelujah why is isaiah taking a call why couldn't he keep on saying for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government is upon us why he says the government shall be upon his his shoulder and his name shall be called his name is called why he said he shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and to us a child is born jesus unto us a sign is given jesus but the government shall be upon his shoulders his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace what is going to make a chance to be called this somebody must come into the church are you i hope you are here with me this evening jesus never answered the disciples who do men say i am i'm the son of man i am before jonathan after jordan he said who do men say i the son of man em and peter a mystical channel opened and a revelation dropped from eternity and it dropped into the heart of peter and peter said thou art christ the son of the living god thou art anointed somebody will be with me here jesus christ is not the same name of jesus amen when we say jesus christ it's not like when we say rattan and george no say jesus is the name of the temple christ is the anointed one are you still with me now after jonathan he was not just a man he was murdered a man he was a dual bee when he was tired he was a man but when he came to the storm he was more than a man when he went to the graveyard salazar was crying he was a man but when he said he loved the roots it was not a man it was more than a man it was the father in the temple [Applause] the jews the series the scribes they never had a problem when you called him jesus no they were fine but to call him christ to call him christ that's why he said to them before abraham i am and they said but you are not yet to 50 how can you say you already know father abraham he said abraham shot my dead and he rejoiced who was speaking it was not the body that came through mary it was something that was there before that conception it was the very one that john coming into his temple i can imagine john after he preaches that sermon and he said he made history he's among you but god will identify him and when the heaven opened and he saw the father in the form of the town coming down and coming into the castle john myself said what am i going to tell the people [Music] how what someone am i going to preach that my cousin is the messiah what applies to jesus applies to you you empowered your family and they raised you and they taught you how to speak and they affect you but they did not know the word is not a deity but the two was coming into their body and today today yes you get sick yes you get tired yes you get discouraged hallelujah no wonder the problem says that yet is not in heaven but the deities in you christ the hope of glory we're not worshiping christ in a manger worshiping christ in you you look at me as a man yes i'm a man but there is something within me hallelujah [Applause] [Music] he says the greatest of all revelations the greatest of all revelations is the deity the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ you can't get your first base until you believe that you can't get anywhere until you believe that amen because that's very crucial let's follow this in the message the communion what is looking for that quotation is something that comes in my mind it is in the message spiritual fruit induces it brother branham says if jesus if christ can come this evening with his body with hands a piece and with blood oozing out of his body he says i will reject him he says because it is not the season for that body but it says if he comes in the form of my brother and my sister i will accept him this is john 14 verse 20 and that day you shall know that i am in the father the father in me and i in you it's a three form we are now in the season where it is 44 the prophet says but in that great crucial hour until he suffered knowing all things until the father until the water and blood separated because of strain in his body and grated drops of sweat like blood dropped from his brow he died more death in gentleman than he did on the cross you can go anywhere in the world you will never find this phrase it's only the prophet that said it he died more death in german than on the cross what does it mean we have to follow and check what does he mean did he die in case man but the prophecy he died more death in gentleman down on the cross and your prophet comes don't forget what brother defines death to be he said death is separation [Applause] in the message it is the rising of this heart paragraph 241 he says let's wait for the brother i like when you see this quotations the spirit left him the spirit left him in the garden of gazima he had to die amen remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which was human flesh if he had went up there as god he would have never died that kind of death you can kill god you can kill god but you can kill his temper you can even handle his temper but you can never kill god if he says the spirit left him in the kind of gentleman with spirits i'm asking which spirit when did the spirit come into him your prophet told you everyone shall die the same one that came into the river jordan he left him in catamount he died more than catholic than on the cross because god left him and said you have to go and die but god cannot die but his flesh can die this place can die but what is in this place can never die you can't kill god there is a part within you that shall never be killed there is a path within you that shall never be contained by the truth yes i it's a divine introduction same spirit that came into him and remember jordan left him in german do you see if you make the body brother judge because of lack of revelation and because of laziness to study the message that's why we have ended up with people introducing trueness doctrine in the message when they say here's jesus in the in the river and here is the father coming that means when the children protest meets is the scripture we don't believe in trueness we don't believe in trilogy and please same spirit that came into him in river georgia left him yes sir in so that he can die like a man when john says i knew him not he did not refer to the body he knew the body he played with the body he learned how to talk with the body but there was something that came into the body that identified to the body they played with you they grew up with you they know your name they went to school with you they worked with you but you only know the body but the message to introduce something that is i am not in this jacket if it gets one out i take it off and i throw it away you are wearing a boot and as this go by i can see grey hairs in the building the body is getting weaker but as it gets quicker something is getting stronger as they are what can perish do you now see why it was not easy to have john's ministry johnny had to introduce his cousin as the messiah amen let's come to our time all right are we talking to you about the first introduction can we move to the second one let's come to our time i was showing you what happened today i want to bring what's happening here today [Music] will bring them came to introduce christ now i think pastor green was here tonight's brother george introduced him brother theo was not here you couldn't introduce brother phil when he's not around you can introduce somebody in absentia you introduce the person that is so brother branham had his ministry was to introduce he cannot introduce christ in christ absentia let's carry on with it [Applause] i want to show you why great men like brother baxter you know in the midst of the present stage of my ministry brother brahma says when he preaches about who's this gentleman that left paul dimas brother brennaman he says brother baxter he said to me when i came to heaven i want to look for jimas and asked him as how can you leave that great messenger of god now isn't exactly what brother baxter did when he left brother branham what i'm simply saying is don't become the spirit that you're fighting against [Music] if you fight a spirit without this spirit you can become the very thing that you're fighting now people like great men they loved the festival ministry yeah they loved the second pool but when he came to the third pool even people like child osborne said brother brennan has lost his mind but they are attracted i remember tell osborn first night it was his wife that went to the meeting and came back and told brother tell husband say it was such an annoying thing and brother taylor osborne was a chairman of a denominational organization that had arranged a convention he absconded from his own convention to come and attend brother brown's meeting and he was moved by what he saw but in the latter years he said brother brethren had lost his mind we want to follow what does it mean what made them to go away and what makes us to stay amen now in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 181 i want you to pay attention because dates are going to be important because you are tracking what brother branham was saying remember to be a good student of the message don't take one quotation and run with it you must check community in the message now brethren says when in one jesus christ the same yesterday forever this was on the 18th of july 1962. he says he's in prayer he says heavenly father we are grateful to know that we are living in this last day just before the coming of that just one that wonderful glorious loving son of yours our lord jesus our lord and savior jesus christ who we love we know the world speaks of an appearing before we know the bible speaks of before and there is a great difference in the word appearing and then coming amen are you with me stay with the prophet messenger there is somewhere where he's going he says there is a difference between the appeal and the copy then you come in the message leading of the spirit of god paragraph 25. he says the messiah saw that and they said there will be a star rise i'll be watching for it today so it what did jesus say would take place just about this time and i will restore to the people all the glory of the farmer and i will pour out upon them the former in the lottery and the signs and wonders that was in the first church will be in the second church at the last day here is your sign he is appearing on the earth signs and wonders the same thing that he did his year again his spirit moving among the people this was on the seventh of august 1955 he says he is appearing on the earth now are you still with me 25th may 1962 in the message convinced to then consent paragraph 31 i want you to pay attention to dates 21st may 1962 of 31 do you love the message don't sleep on me this is very critical if somebody sleeps next to you just nudge them and says you are still funny sleeping as well convince and consent 21st may 1962 paragraph 31 now john was so sure that he was going to see the messiah until he said he is in our midst now now watch notice there is a great big difference in the sign of jesus appearing and then jesus coming there is two different words means two different things the appearing of the lord and the coming of the lord now the appearing of the lord is the appearing of the lord is when was that now 21st of may 1962 he says now is the appearing of the lord jesus now when is appearing in his people his people working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for the rapture for the coming of the lord to catch up with the bride they are building and they're coming let's move from may and go on the 8th of june a month immediately after in the message perseverance somewhere i'm going paragraph 96 so the lord is now appearing among his people great in science great signs and oneness raising the date healing the sick doing the very same things that he did that hasn't been done for 2000 years the church is run up through that brought up till it's right at the time the headstone is coming to me to the church then it will all go together and be raptured the words fell asleep in the first watch second watch third watch onto the seventh watch the appearance of the lord last night i touch it our house would come so brother enemy is calling the healing of the sick the sights and wonders the appearing of the lord are you with me same month few days later 11th of june 1962 you're gonna love this you know there is a difference between the appearing of christ and the coming of christ that's two different rates altogether he is appearing now in his church we see him we know it's him it's the holy spirit see we know it is here again on the 11th of june he says it is the appeal of the lord the message from that time now this is on the 13th of july 1962 a month later paragraph 102 he says how many knows there is a difference between the appearing of christ and the coming of christ is two different ways now is the appearing the coming will soon be the coming will be this is now july on the 13th of july 1962 he tells you it is appearing now the coming week should be he is appearing in the midst of us doing the works that he once did in his church now you're part of that church by grace you believe i'm a member of that church now i'm not a preacher you know i'm not i'm not i have not the education to do it sometimes i feel reluctant standing here by men of god who's called you to that office there are apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists not all apostles not all our prophets not all teachers not all evangelists i'm standing here but my ministry is a different ministry from a pastor or a teacher let me pause here the five-fold i'm gonna say this the five-fold ministry must be liked by the holy ghost today i'll repeat the five-fold ministry must be led by the holy ghost today not by library distributors [Music] i'll repeat the whole the five-fold ministry must be led by the holy ghost not by led readings i'm not afraid to say that the five-fold ministry must be led by the holy ghost and the holy ghost will show you the message of the mothers of the time they must never be ranked by why am i saying that it's because people today are saying brother brother is a pastor how can a prophet of the age be a pastor the part of this church is not a brother brother he's brother george the prophet is a dispensational prophet he operates about the five point ministry and the fight foreign ministry is subject to the prophet the people said to joshua we will follow you as long as the god that was with moses is with thee we will follow you as long as the law of moses shall never depart your time and you the church in the end time must tell the faithful ministry must never depart your so even if we remain 40 years later is but you can never correct the process let me give you confidence in this message you know moses struck the road twice instead of once was wrong but in his wrongness god made it right because when he strikes the rock is tied to the crucifixion of christ but now many struggle twice and god said that you never met him with this wrong amen 96 certainly the prophet comes from the prophet he says god i stay with the prophets is is and this message is [Applause] mystery is a different ministry from a pastor or a teacher i'm not if i say things president forgive me i don't mean it but this is my ministry this is my ministry to declare him ministry to declare him that he is here [Applause] still is 1962 on the 13th of july now because as i carry on somebody said wait a minute but then then what happened at ohio river when he was baptizing the 17th person whether they're appearing or they're coming if there is a message question there must be a message in the message that anointed once at the end time paragraph 2 69. he says now i want you to know this show you then listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say some to say that about myself being that i was picking this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declared to do and determined you i wasn't the one i wasn't the one i wasn't the one another came that up yet down on the river remember that appearing in the coming is two different things then it tells you what happened at the river ohio it was the appearing i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and for tells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was the only voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew is what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a name it's god the angel was thought to this son of man he was a messenger he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you are feeling on you are not feeling on a man his way will fail but you are feeling feeling on the unfailing body weight of the son of man the message is not just a literature the message is the revelation of the son of man the mystery of our time the mystery of our time is the revelation of this argument within a son of man remember i gave you an example about how many powers to give you a banana without pills i want to eat it what i wonder where is this banana bee is it really a banana because you identify a by banana appears and you want to be the one that will open the bills and brother pranam was the pill and the banana is the diet and you receive to the banana but you had appeared a son of man to get to this son of name as this son of man was built within the son of man you cannot receive this son of man without a son of man you can never know christ without malachi of allah you can never know christ without jesus i must read this i must say this one more time our message is greater than tg's message our message is greater than creator crypto dweller our message is greater than jewelry austin our message is greater than mine is monroe's is a great preacher but his message does not have rapture in faith only one message come and smile to the entire the only way of escape is the message of the arm [Applause] revelation 10 verse 1. and i saw another mighty angel appear from heaven god bless you awake my brother the mighty angel does not appear 19 revelation 10 verse 1 is what did they appearing towards 1963 the soon soon to be the coming and he said my ministry still tell him that he's here revelation 10 verse 1 and i saw a mighty angel calm down and i write this code for you in the message the bridge read it one more time when the sales are broke and the mystery is revealed down comes another piece folks now down comes the engine the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time not of disappearing as a time of what that means brother is this the seven angel is where at the time of this coming brother must be on the scene she will receive the mighty engine amen are you with me but it's not for the public i say it's not for the public it's a total secret let me give you a testimony of her brother this brother was at a university and they were studying about the clouds out loud because they wanted to know was it a rain cloud what was happening so they had a lot of questions that it cannot be because of the altitude so there are many questions at university that they couldn't resolve with their lecturer and this brother was done with varsity and now he was waiting to get a job a few years later then he was moving around he was now a vendor selling merchandise from house to house then he goes to another brother's house he knocks on the door and the brother opens the door as he opens the door for this man that is selling merchandise the man his gaze is just above the brother he is captivated by something above the brother another person says can i help you then that man say forget why i'm here what is this it was the picture of the cloud above the brother then he says what do you mean he says we studied about this cloud at university we looked at it we couldn't find answers but today when you open the door and i saw that picture i saw the face of a man [Applause] we couldn't see it at university but today i see it and the brother said come in my body that is our lord jesus christ the desolated seat shall come shall capture the mystery of his second coming eye with me in the message the seventh seed he says you know when i came into the message in the early years i wanted to reach the 76 because it was more like a final year of university of the message when i read as a youngster must have been 13 i couldn't get anything i said oh brother doesn't say anything only to realize later that brother brahma is speaking in parables he says because if the devil catch it he's going to create fanaticism he says it may be time it may be the hour that this great person that we're expecting to rise on the scene may rise maybe this ministry that i've tried brothers if they can fold it that i've tried to take people back to the weight has laid a foundation and if it has i will be he can't leave unless the mighty angel is here because that quotation says the seventh angel messenger is on the earth at the time of this coming but it says if it has i will be leaving you for good there will be we want to tell every man in the message that wants to be an ex messenger it cannot be the two of you i will repeat one more time every man must decrease i say every man must decrease the lord jesus christ must increase [Applause] there won't be two of us here at the same time if it is he will increase and i will decrease let me stop you in the message after john you know the greatest danger in the scriptures it's always around transition when the minister moved from moses to joshua and when the minister moved from elijah to elijah it's it's always a problem when the minister moved from john to jesus john says he sees jesus coming he says behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world only two disciples follow jesus only followed jesus the rest revolved around john they did not see a scriptural and spiritual transition now brother is not going to return back to preach i'll repeat brother branham says he is not coming back to pray he will come in the resurrection with the rest of the saints you the fightful ministry must preach but i want to show you something here when john was in prison he sent some of his disciples i don't know whether he was tired they don't see it he said go and ask him is he the one then they came to jesus and say john is asking this question about you jesus doesn't give him the quotation doesn't give the scripture he points him at the manifestations of the ministry the damn speak the lane here the crap will walk tell him this because he knew that christ is identified by his characteristics and today a question could be asked again is he the one and i'm amen to give you an answer go and tell him the message has reached the jungles of africa go ahead and tell him people are coming and receiving the revelation of the hour in trinidad telling him community did not change their standpoint they still believe in the message of the hour telling him our young people have separated from the world they don't have boyfriends they don't have girlfriends they are far away from it [Applause] tell him about what you see you know why if john pointed at jesus and said behold the lamb of god and brother branham in our time did not point at another body but jesus christ was built in brother brother a brother branham moves off the scene christ today where is he brother say he always fails himself he always hides himself behind the skills so tonight where is christ you know message christ is a minister of god revealed he says christ is making himself known within his church he is here tonight and my brother in my sister hallelujah go go to this wearing his suit god is wearing a dress today he's hiding behind your flesh but don't forget the body is not the deity but the deity is in the body here is the deity of jesus christ we are not worshiping christ in a measure we are worshipping christ in you the hope of glory god bless you
