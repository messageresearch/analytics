of sons of god and daughters of god surely hallelujah god has a time set hallelujah for an adoption hallelujah he had a time said hallelujah when your salvation came to a reality he had a time set for your healing to come to a reality hallelujah is a time set for your adoption hallelujah into the kingdom of god hallelujah there's a time set before you hallelujah and we are looking forward for this time praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah as we receive the seeds of adoption we have received it and the light has struck it hallelujah it will grow hallelujah and it will come into a full manifestation hallelujah in your life in your surrounding hallelujah and others will see that you have been with jesus christ hallelujah praise the lord amen so god has a plan a hallelujah let me say this god has a plan a and the plan a is always the best plane it's a plan about adoption hallelujah so let satan hassle his plan b brother hallelujah but god has a plan a hallelujah so let's focus on the plan a hallelujah because this one it works hallelujah this one worked and it will work again hallelujah it worked in jesus christ it worked in so many and it will work in you hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah amen amen amen amen and i have a little sword hallelujah that i want to share with you for this greeting hallelujah praise the lord and it's i want to speak a little short just to bring it out what's on my heart it's about the unfolding of the realities of god hallelujah there there's realities of god that we don't see yet hallelujah but for god it's already there hallelujah but it's a time set hallelujah for these realities to unfold hallelujah to unfold in your life to unfold in my life hallelujah and the time is at hand hallelujah all what you heard through the convention everything what you heard hallelujah i believe the time is here for the realities of god that you can see hallelujah god was made more visible in the garden of eden hallelujah he became light hallelujah that he was more tangible the prophet says hallelujah and adoption is going to be more tangible to us hallelujah amen hallelujah amen praise the lord and i want to read a scripture and i want to take it short from matthew 17 verse 2 as a little background hallelujah praise the lord and hallelujah amen hallelujah matthew verse 17 verse 2 chapter 17 verse 2. now jesus was on the mount of transfiguration and transfiguration means there's a change it's a mountain of change hallelujah there was a change going on amen and there was he transfigured before them and his face shone like the sun and his glosses became as a white light hallelujah amen and a voice from the cloud said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased hear ye him hallelujah that talks about adoption hell allah now now god said in whom i'm well pleased so god was in jesus christ and he was so pleased how jesus done everything according to the word hallelujah and it was a time set hallelujah on the mountain side praise the lord and i want to read from hakai 2 verse 7 i would take my second scripture from there verse 7 and verse 9 and it has struck me lately and here the lord tells his prophet and he says i will fill this house with glory says the lord of hosts the glory verse 9 of this latter house shall be greater than the former house says the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace says the lord of hosts hallelujah and we have also a house hallelujah the prophet told us in the bible tells us that we are a temple of god hallelujah and there's a glory coming down hallelujah and his glory at the end at the latter day it will be even greater hallelujah then in the first place hallelujah so there's a big glory coming down hallelujah praise the lord and there's a glory coming down and and and brother branham says that he says is an adoption he says hallelujah in in one message he says he says he says jesus went and he went all the way and he went to the to the to the crucifixion and he died and he rose again and he says but he rose again hallelujah for the holy spirit to come back in a double portion hallelujah so the double portion is here already hallelujah he's sent on the earth and it's here the double portion hallelujah what is a double portion hallelujah you shall receive power hallelujah shall receive the baptism of the holy spirit and you shall be adopted hallelujah a greater measure a greater one hallelujah and jesus himself hallelujah he had that glory he had its glory and we read in john 17 verse 5 we read and now our father jesus is praying this prayer to his father and he says oh father glorified glorified thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world wars hallelujah jesus he knew there was a glory that he had before the foundation of the world hallelujah and he said father glorify me with that glory with your own self hallelujah with the glory that i had before the foundation of the world hallelujah and your glory helly it's his glory and it's already there before the foundation of the world your adoption your double portion hallelujah it's already there before the foundation of the world hallelujah but made this day hallelujah this day may be a tremont transfiguration experience hallelujah but there's a change going on hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but it took some time hallelujah from before the foundation till now it took some time of unfolding of unfolding the realities of god there's a reality of god it's already there it was there before the foundation of the world hallelujah chope saw that reality and he cried out i know my redeemer lives when he saw the lamb of god slain hallelujah and that's gonna come for us hallelujah amen praise the lord hallelujah so there's unfolding going on of the promise there's a folding of your adoption going on hallelujah hallelujah you are saved by face you are saved you are healed by face hallelujah and you are redeemed and you receive it and god redeems you hallelujah and your adoption hallelujah is on its way praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord if we go in the old testament hallelujah we're going to have a look on ruse ruth was a moabite she was living in the land of moabite hallelujah there was no salvation for her there was no redemption for her in this land hello but god has chosen her without the foundation of the world she should be in line of jesus hallelujah and he chose her hallelujah but one day she came into a reality healthy she came into a reality of a living redeemer of boas her redeemer at this day and she came forth hallelujah and gideon he was a fearful one he feared he was not sure will the lord do it and the lord gave him a sign hallelujah and he was changed from a fearful warrior he was changed into a warrior he was changed and he saw the god's overcoming power hallelujah in his life hallelujah all the enemies all the enemies that struck israel hallelujah they had to go away hallelujah and they were defeated hallelujah because there was a change going on and gideon he was walking in his adoption time hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah peter let's have a look at peter short look at peter peter he was trying himself he tried all he could hallelujah to get into this land to have this authority hallelujah but in all his trying he failed but he still loved the lord hallelujah but one day hallelujah he faced the reality of god hallelujah and he had a key hallelujah to open and to unlock hallelujah the realities of god hallelujah praise the lord and peter was a different person from that time on amen let's have a look at paul paul he had he had his own mindset he was really sellers about the lord but still he had his own mindset and how often have we our own mindset how things should be and how things should turn away and the way it should come but when it comes by the way of the lord jesus christ it's so different it surprised paul it surprised him on his way to damascus hallelujah and that being hallelujah it struck paul hallelujah and it set him in hallelujah for his time for what what was his place of adoption he says i'm a prisoner of the lord jesus christ what a place of adoption to be a prisoner of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah so it's unfolding it's unfolding through all the time what is unfolding brother branham says it talks about jesus he says you are the same yesterday today and forever he says you are the word he says you was the word that was noah you are the word that was in moses you was the word that was in elijah and you was the word that was in david and you are the word made flesh and is among us today hallelujah so there's an unfolding of the word of god in our lives it has been in all the ages it was the word of god unfolding in paul in peter hello this was unfolding the word hallelujah and it unfolds in our lives hallelujah and one day hallelujah it's gonna come into plain view the unfolding of the reality of god hallelujah hallelujah when will it unfold when will it unfold we are waiting for it we are waiting for our adoption we are so much waiting we are longing for it there's something in our hearts that's striving for us that's striving to it brother branham in a code where i think pentecostal failed he said god will place in the church the place that he sees you in so god will prepare that place within the church where he sees you in after he adopts you into his family he says he will call you out someday in a little prayer meeting hallelujah there's a call going out hallelujah in a little prayer meeting hallelujah and the first thing you know and he plays a rope upon you hallelujah brother prem says this robe is a rope of serenity it's a robe of reigning hallelujah it's a royal robe he says hallelujah and he puts that robe where does brother branham says it he says in a little prayer meeting hallelujah a little prayer meeting where we are shut up with god hallelujah in a secret place where our own thoughts are gone hallelujah everything else is gone but only he matters he matters all to us hallelujah and in a meeting like this hallelujah he can come down hallelujah and he can call you out hallelujah and he makes a ceremony upon you hallelujah hello he can be in a prayer meeting it can be in this meeting hallelujah where he's gonna call out but let's be ready let's be focused hallelujah because god is ready hallelujah and he will call you out hallelujah praise the lord brother branham says he says in this message the great warrior there david he says now we know it's god will it's god's will to save the lost we know it's god's will to heal the sick now if we can only positionally place ourselves in his will he says then it's over hallelujah if you think about adoption healthy brother branham says when we put our own will hell and we put it in the will of god hallelujah he says then it's over hallelujah so let's put our will let's put ourselves let's put our personality let's put everything else in him hallelujah in his will and then it's gonna be over one of these days it's gonna be over hallelujah hallelujah let me make this example hallelujah of placing hella yourself into his will in john 14 12 jesus says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also do and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father now you see the will of god that was the will of god before the foundation of the world and jesus spoke it out and he said greater works you shall do hallelujah how shall i do it how will i do it place yourself in the will of god it's the will of your father that you do the creator works it's the will of him that that will us hallelujah place yourself in the will of god place yourself in the word of god and he will do it surely he will do it hallelujah in the message adoption the prophet says god is trying to place his church in position your position is in his will your position in his in his word it's in his spirit it's in his presence that's your position god is trying brother branham says to put you into that position hallelujah for what to manifest himself it will be him adoption will be him manifesting himself in your life and he's trying to bring you into this position hallelujah getting one that he can work through like this and say there's my spirit flowing freely praise the lord adoption you have conducted yourself the character of god is there and it's time for the spirit of god to flow freely in your life you cannot hold it anymore you cannot hold it back anymore but it will flow out in a message and i'm coming to an end of this short greeting what has touched me one day there's gonna be an unfolding of the realities of god in the young people in older people there's going to be an unfolding and unfolding and unveiling of the realities of god on this earth and god himself will be seen and that way is gonna be taken away and the world gonna see god once more time on his earth walking and speaking and performing the same things that he did not only this but he said greater works because a double portion a greater measure hallelujah before we leave this verse hallelujah there's gonna be a revival in the land hallelujah that's gone brother branham says he says what is the revival gonna do he says you have to see he said the sea doesn't change it's the same seed it's the same promises it's the same word he says but a revival comes along the way and it's gonna sweep all the trash out of this sea it's gonna sweep all the trash out of this lake hallelujah and the word of god will be in full effect hallelujah in his people in his chosen pride hallelujah bride of jesus christ be encouraged hallelujah the world is gonna have their manifestation you're gonna not gonna hold it back hallelujah and the world is not gonna hold your manifestation back hallelujah there's nothing that can hold it back hallelujah because where the spirit of god is there's liberty and it will flow and it will flow out god bless you i'm looking forward to see you again

so much to thank you for lord we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy for your preservation for your blood for redemption for your prophet for this message lord for this great

that are here lord i will help make this tape father may you take complete control we commit the service into your hands we commit your people into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen and amen let's just give the lord a hand of praise one more time amen so before you take your seats let's go to the scriptures and i'll do the greetings after the scriptures so i greet you in the name of jesus christ i want to read from ephesians 1 and romans 8 for the text certainly great to be in the presence of the lord ephesians 1 and reading from verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him that's past tense before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved and reading romans eight and reading from verse 14 romans 8 and verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father the spirit itself buried witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then ears ears of god and joint ears with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you believe that this morning tonight where whatever time zone you're in for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation grown it and travail it in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray one more time heavily father lord we have read your sacred scriptures lord and in this last service we pray that lord you would walk out the pages of the bible may you lord open your word to us may you bring lord understanding to your people may you raise the fate of your people may you encourage your people may you take me out of the way may you use me as a microphone me you speak direct to your sons and your daughters lord both here and around the world and wherever the tape may be played may the shout of the king be in the camp and let your people know that they are more for us than against us and let your people know that the season is here and the time has come and the always upon us may you bless the word bless the reading of the word bless the hearing of the word in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen and they mean well you may be seated amen and what a season what a time and by the time this service is played you would have seen all the all the services and all the meetings and we thank god that throughout this whole season of 2020 that although we can't meet how we would normally have done god allowed a technology to be used to bring us together from around the world from the east from the west from the north and the south and we are grateful to god for his grace and his love and his mercy and his blessings that we could be looking at the last few days of 2020 and looking forward to 2021 by the grace of god for our mighty climax of this great story of redemption that started way back there that we could be counted a part of that great story that god would leave the last chapter for a certain group of people who would form the last pages of this book and satan is mad but we are so glad and the inspiration of this meeting the manifestation of the sons of god the adoption time the placing of sons to think all these years has been leading to this spot has been leaving to this time has been leading to this season what a reason to shout what a reason to worship what a reason to shake yourself and forget about yesterday and forget about the things you cannot control and forget the things you cannot change and forget the things you don't have the power over but there are certain things that are within our power there are certain things that are within our control and the sons of god who are coming into view by revelation and manifestation where peter wants to push back the darkness up to push back the plagues not the plagues only but the devil himself up because we are getting ready for a final climax and a final showdown can the church say amen you may be seated i'd like to thank brother solomon china the host pastor uh for the inspiration to have this meeting and the and the and the theme of the meeting and may the lord richie bless him and live tabernacle in tamale ghana for the great fate and the great vision and the great passion to see what can be done in this time because there's a time coming when no man could work so while we could work while we could worship while we could pull on fire while we could hold on for our families we want to do it every day because they're going to shut the churches down you know that they're going to shut it down but listen before that time comes this pride will come into power i'm not talking about the church i'm not talking about church members but mrs jesus christ true sons of born sons filled sons will rise up and no devil no demon no principality no power nothing past nothing present will stop his pride from coming into view i see her rising up rising up in the east rising up in the west rising up in the north rising up in the south oh hallelujah you may be seated i know you've had wonderful preaching because that's how god is he rose up individuals in such a time as this a man of god i'm just a spare tire to close us out but you've already heard the word the word is in the pride the word is in you and that word cannot fail it must come to pass it will produce it will produce what malachi 4 spoke about a glorious church without spot without wrinkle sin we cannot stay in that church the holy ghost will be in that church in the individuals in that church you may be seated i'm trying to finish the greeting so i can get a little thought in

there are two kinds of miracles they are instant miracles so while you're in this service or you're watching this tape god could heal you instantly but brother branham also spoke about span of time miracles that takes some time so after this service is over the world that is spoken over you will follow you follow you to your car follow you to your home follow you to the plane follow you to wherever you go and anything now it's gonna come to pass [Applause] oh hallelujah may the lord bless you so for a title this morning this evening positionally placed for the final showdown positionally placed for the final showdown for a subject the manifestation of the sons of god and as an inspiration the great hour of charge is at hand what we have been waiting for with the terrorists what we've been waiting for brother kangali what we've been waiting for all these years this is it so this is just a layer background before i get to the text i'm not going to be too long with you right with me this evening in a message adoption but ibrahim said looks to me like we are the end time and god is adopting and i'm sure by the time this service is played you would have heard this in many different ways because this is the theme of the convention god is adopting setting positionally in church in the body of christ he said now there's not going to be too many i want you to catch this that he puts in there so it's not based on attendance it's not a numbers game it's not everybody who coming to the message it's just going to be a few people he said there's not going to be too many that he put in there so you got to make sure that you are one of them that's placed in there hallelujah and you will see throughout this meeting that god is differentiating between sons and play sons he's differentiating between being born again and being positionally born because we know that god dispatches a tutor oh to watch over your behavior to watch your conduct over this year 2020 when the world is gripped by a pandemic the tutor has been dispatched to see how you would operate up when the pastor cannot see you to see how you would operate up when the deacon cannot see you because it's not about impressing the deacon or impressing the pastor it's the tutor he's giving a report he's giving a report right now he's giving a report on your attitude he's given a report on your worship he's giving you a report right now and i want that report to say hey i want that report to say pass i want that report to say overcomer i want that report to say he's making it he stood the test up he didn't give up he's not backsliding he might be tired but he made it in he might be wary but he made it in he thought of giving up but he's still here give the lord a shout our praise oh hallelujah oh hallelujah just a little background in adoption he said you think cancer is coming this whole virus had the whole world crippled shut down the airports shut down businesses shut down the streets lock people up all kinds of situations he said you think cancer is coming the bible said there's coming a time when men will rot right in their flesh oh you think this pandemic is something and the buzzers will eat off carcasses before they even die he said cancer is a toothache to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the seal of god that's what we are striving for now so god bless you brother solomon for bringing out this theme because this is what we are striving for to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike not placed in the church but positionally placed in the kingdom of god in other words take your position take your rank hold your position take your rank why we are getting ready for warfare we are getting ready for warfare satan has run his course he has done everything he is supposed to do and he's at the end of his journey but now when it looks all dark here comes mrs jesus christ oh she has been preparing for a long time since the prophet was here she has been getting ready she's been getting ready but now now when we need it the bride hasn't had a revival yet but it'll take just oh hallelujah no manifestation of god to stir the pride he will send it he promised and i believe it's now hallelujah oh my you may be seated so we talk about being positionally placed for the final showdown so i just want to encourage you a little bit i want to talk about position about being in position i want to talk a little bit about positionally being placed i want to talk about the importance of order and position because god is a god of order he doesn't make a mistake you look through god's resume you cannot find a mistake he's a perfect god there's no mistake when he put your name on the book he didn't make a mistake he's not trying something he's not making up something he's not hoping something happens he's a god of order he said you are predestinated unto adoption not predestinated unto salvation predestinated onto adoption placing of sons where the authority and the power could come to you can the church say amen hallelujah and the reason placing is necessary it's because something is out of place if it was not out of place brother george there's no need to put it in place so this whole thing about getting in place is because it's out of place so i want to go back to the beginning i'd love to go back to the beginning and before the beginning because we know the devil hates genesis and he hates revelation so i love to go there because it puts pressure on the devil whenever the devil comes at you bring out revelation and bring on genesis and see the devil begin to tremble because he doesn't like the beginning and he doesn't like the ending can the church say amen so before the fall of man the sun was in its position the s-u-n the moon was in its position the animals were in their position nature was in its position nature wasn't groaning and travailing because it was in position everything was in order there was nothing needed to be fixed because everything was perfect god said it is good it is good it is good and each day that passed it was good it was good and when god brought man into the picture man was not born he was placed adam wasn't a little boy he was placed in the garden so he was a placed son he was just put there in the garden and there without any explanation the animals knew that a master had been installed the trees knew that the master had been installed the heavens knew that a master a placed son was in position can the church say amen and because adam was in position and nothing was out of order when eve came she was also in position there was nothing to be fixed there was nothing to be corrected everything was in order and that's just how god loves it he loves to see your life in order he wants your prayer life to be in order he wants your home to be in order he wants a church to be in order he wants your heart to be in order and god was good he felt good because everything was in order [Music] everybody with me this morning this evening all manner of life recognized that the place sun was on the earth no introduction was necessary no explanation was necessary no conversation was necessary they recognized the the power that was locked up in adam he just had to speak and they had to obey can the church say man oh hallelujah eve had a position and it was behind the word once she stayed in position nothing could go wrong once she stayed behind the word in position the devil couldn't move i want us to realize that the devil was moving around but he was limited he had no ability to access nothing because everything was in position the position was physical they were in the garden of eden the position was spiritual they were in order perfect communion harmony with god nothing could have gone wrong because they were in position the position was there was an emotional element adam didn't know what fear was he didn't know what hiding was he didn't know what shame was so he was also in an emotional position he got the emotion that we know but he didn't know certain emotions and that position was in the word it was hiding behind the word it was protected by the word that position had rights that position had benefits that position had restrictions once he was impositioned by the currents there were rights that came with the position there were benefits that came with the he couldn't get old once he was in position he couldn't get sick once he stayed in position he couldn't die once he was in position he didn't know sorrow once he's in position he doesn't know heartache oh hallelujah anybody with me and that's the position that we are going back to oh god lord help me a position with rights a position with benefits a position with restrictions you maybe see that for a minute you know when they get a job your job is called a position so when you are uh uh uh uh administrator in a job that administrator has rights you have a writer salary yeah you have certain benefits you might get insurance you might but but as you go higher and your position changes you get different rights you get different benefits you also have different restrictions because the higher you go the more right you get you get a better salary you get rights to a bonus you have certain other benefits they might give you a car they might give you a mobile device they might give you a computer and you have restrictions there are some things you cannot do the higher you go the higher the position you hold there are certain things you cannot do because you represent the position and you represent the office come on now anybody with me oh hallelujah i'm not a i'm not a deep preacher i'm a practical kind of preacher because this thing about position in christ because i have to understand it break it down simple to me this position has rights there are certain things i can access when i get into this position and the closer i get to this position my rights are going to increase my benefits are going to increase and my restrictions are going to increase because of this position there are certain places i cannot go no more because of this position there are certain words i can't use no more because of this position i can't hold any odds because of disposition i can't have any grudges because of this position i can't have any jealousy anybody with me this morning anybody with me this evening so adam fell and he fell and because they fell from this position things change i want us to understand how important this position thing is because it's position in christ it's a place in the body it's a ministry by the branham says he calls it five offices and there's a court that i'm gonna get to that god before the foundation of the world predestinated you to be a housewife to be a farmer god predestinated your occupation you think you chose your job god predestinated it oh come on now somebody preached back to me god wasn't leaving anything to accident he wasn't leaving anything to chance because this bride will be the one to give the final knockout punch can the church say amen hallelujah i'm building we're talking about positionally placed for the final showdown i want to even go before the beginning i want to go to the war in heaven because the war in heaven was a war position this issue of position is a big one because the devil wasn't satisfied with his position so he wanted to get a promotion he looked at where god was he looked at what god had he looked at the worship and he said i would like to be like the most high he wanted a change in position so you know what god did god demoted him there was war in heaven and michael fought and the angels fought and at the equal sign of that war was satan was demoted he was kicked out of heaven called the first emotion that's the first emotion keep opening that because we're going to get to his second emotion later in the service but the devil's aspiration for position led to his first demotion anybody with me this morning what is your position this morning i tell you young brother young sister mother father get right with god get into position your position is not playing around with the world your position is not being a good church member your position is not being in the message its place in christ adoption time manifestation of the sons of god can the chit say man can i encourage you a little bit your position affects what you can see when you're in the valley you could see less than when you're on the mountain your position affects what you can do in a war your position can determine if you have victory or defeat if you have to go into war you have to choose the battleground you have to make sure you know where the enemy is at so your position is important your position affects what you are exposed to so the higher you are in a company the more information you have the more knowledge you have your position impacts your responsibility so when you are not a father and you become a father your position changes so too do your responsibilities that's the problem today people don't realize that the change of position also mean change of responsibility when you become a father you need to pray more oh yeah oh yeah you gotta have more patience because a change opposition your position impacts your responsibility your position impacts the decisions you need to make so your position as a son means you have to make certain decisions of when to say yes i want to say no when to turn the tv off when to turn your head like the prophet did because of his position he didn't spend time with any and everybody because of his position he put a cross in his car so when he saw the woman on the street he would look at the cross in the car that was based on his position [Music] anybody with me your position means that there are some things you must ignore you can't let everything get to you because of your position you have a lot coming at you i'm trying to encourage you church because this year has been a rough year for many people and i've got news for you 2021 going to be harder it's going to be tougher but god will not give you more than you could stand and he promised to send power so that it will not be your strength it will not be your might but it will be the holy ghost it'll be god's power coming into you to meet the challenge of the hour so lift your head up square your shoulders back your position means that there are some things you must ignore your position means that there are some things you must act upon you can't just do as if it doesn't exist so you have to have wisdom based on your position because this isn't it's about a father's business you know it's about confidence so i'm speaking to ceos because the father has a business and he's adopting sons to take his place in the business so you can't tell me you don't know and you don't understand and you don't want to make the decision and you don't want to say no to the devil because your check your signature is as good as a father's signature so you got to get stronger that's why you say let the weak say i'm strong you gotta have confidence so when you say to one go he go it when you say come he comes this adoption is not playing games this adoption is running the father's business so we give you a little home a little house a little family you got to get experience managing that well if you want to graduate to manage in the kingdom business oh come on now you got to run a good business before you can manage god's business you got to run a holy life because you could operate in this thing he the tutor is seeing your conduct your behavior under pressure how you handle stress how you handle decisions that's who he's coming to adopt because it's about the father's business anybody with me is that just a shout and a jump no it's about your behavior under pressure oh hallelujah hallelujah under pressure everybody operates well when there's no pressure but under pressure there's no money in the bank there's pressure you lost your job there's no food on the table there's this going on you have somebody in a family sick it's under pressure you can say i know my redeemer lives oh and you could be like job if the lord gives the law take it away or you'll be like jonah you just there you recognize that you are the wrong one and you say i'm out of position i should have been a nineveh but if i turn to face the temple and get back in position somebody help me this morning anybody in the house this morning you may be seated so the issue of led to the first war the war in heaven and this issue of position will lead to the end of all wars to the final showdown because god will place in position sons and daughters who have been seasoned out and the devil man you know that's why the devil is so mad oh hallelujah somebody give god a shout our praise our position in christ is our legal standing with god listen god don't have to explain to angels who you are when you are in position the angels know who you are oh you don't even know how you made it to church this morning how god was moving things around angels moving things around because you are a child of god and the fact that you are predestinated unto adoption meaning if you're not adopted yet because your trajectory is adoption because your destiny is adoption because adoption is within your reach oh god send angels to protect you to watch over you even the tutor himself to report on you you can miss this if you wanted to you can't lose this if you wanted to it's not even up to you you are predestinated cannot fail what devil what demon what principality satan you are finished in this meeting finish in this year finish in the church finish in your family finish the egyptians you see today you will see them no more forever forever this is your year of jubilee this is your year of freedom [Applause] no wonder the prophet said the moment the bride gets to know who she is all the devil could do is try to tell you you are somebody else but in this meeting you are a son you are a son as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god oh it does not appear what we shall be but when we see him we shall be like him [Music] born of his bone spirit of his spirit flesh of his flesh hallelujah you may be seated and when that time comes but abraham said right now you lay hands on the sick but when that time comes up you will command the demons right now you have trouble on your job but when that time comes your boss will not need an introduction he will not you need an explanation there'll be something about you that will give way to give glory to god because you are carrying the seed of the world that's going to become fleshly somebody help me this evening anybody with me oh hallelujah oh hallelujah the whole creation since genesis the whole creation the trees are growing because they knew what it felt like when adam was in position the trees knew what it felt like the animals knew what it felt like when a son said come the lion knew what it felt like to walk to adam and i didn't touch the lions yet but when adam fell the animals had to go to retreat the animals had to go into the defense the trees began to die out the nature began to get affected all the streams were gonna get polluted because sin had entered into the picture and since that time a groan a travail a cry for restoration started to affect the whole world from that time on the groan has been increasing it's like a mother a group getting ready to give put labor pains since genesis and as each decade and as the years come back the contractions keep getting closer the time be getting shorter there's a countdown going on because this earth is about to give birth again this whole earth is to be transformed because once more suns are coming into position you don't think the trees know it you don't think the trees got a revival oh yes somebody help me the trees had a revival the winds had a revival the seas had a revival when jesus was here anybody with me and the devil raised up a storm and jesus was sleeping and they said let's wake jesus jesus got up out of his sleep he looked at the disciples he looked at the weather he looked at everything he said peace be still and he went back to sleep he didn't even look to see what happened and the trees and the seas and the birds and the animals say you felt that this is what it felt like when adam was here this is what it felt like way back before the fall it means there's hope there's restoration somewhere there's restoration sometime oh i'm going to read it in a quote from the prophet how do you think the earth felt up when god's prophet william branham walked here and say storm move back and say little fishy i give you your life that fish went to tell all the other fish oh the suns are coming back up there's another one on the earth now somebody else is doing what jesus did or somebody else is doing what adam did go tell everybody it's close at hand manifestation of the sons of god and we have a down payment of that fullness the birth is a down payment healing is a long payment you know but everybody said how could y'all feel for the rapture if you guys are not fit for divine healing so it means divine healing is a forties it's a little appetizer oh come on help me help me this morning oh as an appetizer because you can't get a body change if you're if you're afraid of a little healing brother nico god gonna heal your toe you're gonna heal your head you're gonna heal your head you're gonna heal your eyes because your body change is coming and a body change takes more work than just a healing healing will become a small thing because a body change is a big thing come on somebody help me [Music] healing is a down payment joy is a down payment a down payment to god there's greater peace to come revival is a down payment you know oh come on now somebody preach back to me a familiar quote you could take some more keep the motors coming you're only going to get out of it what you put into it oh so keep on worshiping keep on praising oh hallelujah get into position get into your position as a worshiper get into your position as a believer because god could only prove his word by believers so you have to be in a position where you throw doubt aside throw fear aside throw unbelief aside and recognize listen i don't have to take what the devil give me you know this is not my position like what over preach about a prodigal son the political son end up out opposition until he came to himself where he realized nobody told him it wasn't a preacher came to him he came to himself he's had to remember wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute i've had better food i've had better clothes there have been better moments than i go into right now so he came to himself and realized i have to arise in other words i have to change my position so you have to realize yourself you need to change your position if you not having a shout you're supposed to change your position you're not having a joy as opposed to change your position stop doing certain things start doing certain things and do it now don't wait till you go back home don't wait till the convention is over change it today claim it today you can't change yesterday you can't change last month but right now you can lift your hands and you could defy gravity you can lift your hands maybe you didn't lift your hands for a long time we're gonna lift your hands and defy gravity take a different position maybe you're sitting now for a long time but you could change your position and get to your feet and give it give a little movement let the devil know that you're down but you're not out let the devil know he still have a fight in you let the devil know i'm not gonna give up i'm not gonna backslide i'm gonna get into my position [Music] positionally placed for the final showdown oh you may be seated we know this quote from adoption tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be made manifested outside of this time now you know this goal right when were there ever a time in the history there was to manifest the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation now listen to it at this part why before the atonement was made one before the holy ghost was poured out to before all the old testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestations so but ibraham made it clear that throughout all the old testament throughout before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was poured out you couldn't preach this message so this messages tied to the holy ghost being poured out [Music] it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought now we talk about all things so this coat has so much laid in there because took on all things and it was every mystery every truth every loose end coming shaping up to a headstone so we're talking about now that that honing spot now that holy ghost to the manifestation of the sons of god coming back and listen and the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly not not one day you're up when they are down you don't know if you believe you don't if you don't believe you don't if you're accepted no so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ till it will join him and his church together that's your prophecy that's what's unfolding and that's what's happening now can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah so he said a few things he said before the atonement before the holy ghost through the old testament in other words when you read the old testament and you see different manifestations and different people having great miracles it was a taste of what adam lost but it was like a temporary job it's like you had it for a little while but it couldn't be permanent so that's why in the old testament they have to offer the high priest have to go every year because there was no permanent sacrifice but when the atonement anybody with me when jesus come no longer you have to go every year anybody with me this morning hallelujah getting into position so god is talking about moving from a temporary position of having a little experience and and having a little touch and and having and you feel something to this becoming a permanent thing could you imagine that think of the greatest joy you ever had as a word is coming to you and your spiritual experience and you went through where you you fell from that into into dealing with natural things of life think of not falling from that state think about being in the presence all the time think of the holy ghost moving through you all the time you're not taking no taught away you see because the holy ghost giving you the right words at the right time telling you where to go how to move how to live how to act oh come on now can the church say amen oh hallelujah i just want to you know i love bible studies so i want to touch two scriptures before i push forward have a too and verse one i will stand upon my watch that watch his position and i'm bringing this here because a lot of people this year in particular i'm speaking to young people maybe some old people too this year was a different year for churches people who were used to a certain normal approach have been forced to adapt forced to adjust the tutor hasn't stopped working the tutor has not been under quarantine the tutor is not social distancing so the tutor is operating and he's moving from house to house i don't know if you have stayed in your position in the word in the spirit have you been on watch have you been conscious that the tutor is still on his job anybody with me so when i saw this as like i would stand upon my watch or i was standing in my position i will haul ground i'm not going to backslide i'm not going to give up and set me up on the tower the tower is high because it allows you to see out there and see the uncommon storm the uncommon danger to your home to your family to the church to your life to your prayer life oh this is not the kind of convention words now because it's about conduct and order and behavior not your shout out not your attendance it's your conduct your behavior i will stand upon my watch singular when nobody else is watching you on your watch you in your position you at home on the internet you at home have the choice to connect to the service or not and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write a vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that read it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie doorway wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry many people have gotten calm and relaxed in the message but the prophecy is here the time is here and the time is at hand oh give the lord a hand of praise [Applause] i'm not going to be too much longer with you i have a scripture here in chronicles i want to encourage you with before we move on second chronicles 20 and verse 1. and it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphater battle then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying they commit a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in hazotama which is in gedi and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaim a fast throughout all judah and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord and in this meeting we have come from all cities and countries to seek the lord it's not to have a good service but we need to hear from the lord anybody with me this evening judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord they didn't look within they were looking to the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord verse 5 and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court and said oh lord god of our fathers and that's how i feel this evening oh lord god of our fathers are thou art not thou god in heaven is that how you feel and rulers not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen so jehoshaphat begin to train again now and in this hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee you see where my faith comes from that no weapon formed against you can prosper verse seven add not thou our god who did is drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gave us it to the seed of abraham thy friend forever oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh that's how i feel this evening and they dwell therein and have built your sanctuary variant for thy name saying if when evil commit upon us as a sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry out to thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help so he is reminding god of what god did he was reminding god of the promise he made he is reminding god of how you kept us through the years and how you took your sins the prophet left you took us through the 60s and you you took us through the 70s and you took us through the 80s and you you took us through the years there's been rough roads but you have always been there for us we have had tough moments but you have always been a deliverer and we have always stood with you anybody with me you have always stood with us after all of his reminding god he said your hand is not too short you know you have the power now he comes to bring his petition he comes to get a solution because he don't know what to do he don't have opposition he is not in his right place anybody with me is heathen and now behold the children of ammon and moab and monsieur whom the wood has not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not behold i see how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession in other words jehoshaphat is saying these people how you did you didn't allow us to attack them you spared them you left them alone but no they repaid us by coming to attack us anybody with me oh our god will thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that commit against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee that's how i feel this evening that's how i feel in this meeting our eyes are upon thee we are looking to the captain of the host just like joshua looked at the captain of the host oh hallelujah our eyes are upon thee and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children come on church everybody got involved all the children were there the wives were there the men were there everyone in their position nobody sleeping in the tent nobody doing what they want to do because they saw that the enemy was upon them they saw the devil was trying to take them out up they saw the demons that were oppressing them and there they were holding on to god's promise oh judah i say rise up or tribe of judah rise up sons and daughters of god with their little ones their wives and their children verse 14 then upon jehaziel the son of zechariah the son of binaya the son of jail the son of matanya a levite of the sons of assaf came the spirit of the lord oh hallelujah so the spirit of the lord came down and upon a prophet and i know that the spirit of the lord came upon our prophet william branham to tell us what to do to tell us how to move to tell us how to live to get us ready for this war hallelujah a great showdown are you with me come on keep your motors coming in the midst of the congregation verse 15 and he said how can he all judah in other words listen he all judah i don't care what your position is i don't care what you're what's going on in your life i want you to pay attention right now or judah and ye inhabit sons of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat dost say the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude doesn't this song familiar for the battle is not yours but gods it's not your battle but it's the lord's battle and listen for the 16 now the instructions start it sounds like the captain of the host is present he said tomorrow go ye down against them oh come on now are you ready to rise up are you ready to take back what is yours are you ready to push the devil back from your home tomorrow go e down against them in other words you can't stay where you at now stop the crying stop the complaining stop the sigh and stop it get up where you at change your position you can't fight the war here now it's time to go out and meet the enemy we have been silent for a long time but the bride is being given instructions to get into opposition tomorrow go ye down against them listen to how specific god is behold they come up by the cliff of this so before they reach god tell them where they're coming he said i've given you the gps coordinates of where you're going to meet them and you need to be in position to be able to deal with them hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah come on pride of jesus christ you need to be in position to deal with your house you need to be in position your son is going to be

be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord will be with you anybody with me give the lord a shout our praise i want to finish this up verse 18 and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshiping the lord and the levites of the children of the qurantites and of the children of quran stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high you notice this they start to worship even before they're moving oh come on now preach back to me they hadn't left yet but they began to worship they began to shout they didn't even reach the position yet but because they knew they had a word from the lord they could worship they start to sing new songs they start to give adoration you don't have no excuse to be on fire for god oh hallelujah just the revelation that they had the victory was enough to make them shout stand up to praise the lord god with a loud voice on high and i believe this meeting the revelation that you have a position in christ and god is gonna place you and the battle is not yours but it's the lord he has kept you all these years and he will keep on keeping you that's enough to shout that's enough to worship that's enough to praise him you're not in position yet but you have a promise you know where you're supposed to be you know where the showdown will be at you know where the final battle anybody with me verse 20 and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem believe listen in the lord your god so shall he be established so you want to be established believe in the lord your god believe his prophets so shall he prosper and this is the prophecy this is the ministry and we believe this prophet of william branham every promise every prophecy of adoption a perfection of the seven thunders of a manifestation of the sons of god of born sons filled sons who will speak [Music] can i just finish read it and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord that should praise the beauty of holiness you see how god likes to fight battle you there fighting up with yourself and look at the order he's his sing just sing sing in the beauty of holiness just stay in the presence then stay in the atmosphere don't let nothing move you don't look at the enemy don't look at how much is against you don't look at the ten thousand on that side but sing praises begin to worship god begin to thank him for the victory begin to thank him for the promise begin to thank him and they went out before the army you may be seated you know you have to have a lot of faith i want you to picture these worshipers brought a punch they go in before the army so these worshipers have no weapons hallelujah but the george they have no weapons but they have to sing before the army you have to have a lot of faith to sing without a weapon because the army is behind you but you go in in front of the army blessing and honor might and power he is the god who took us he took us through the red sea he took us through the wilderness he opened up the prison doors and the armies behind you but you have confidence in the lord because he said to you the battle is not yours it is the laws you don't need to even have the weapon your weapon is your worship your weapon is your praise your weapon is your shout your weapon is your joy [Applause] give the lord a shout out praise oh my i want you to see it the army behind you but you leading the attack with worship the army behind you but you lead in the attack with praise hallelujah come on church you have to know your position to do that you have to know where your faith is to do that you have to know where your confidence is to go in from the army and say blessing and honor might and power [Applause] and listen you may be seated so dear listen god i want you to see the picture because this is about position so god said before the weapons i really want the praise that has to be in place listen to how god unfold this now everybody with me are you ready to get into your position but a branham had to be in his place the fightful ministry have to be in their place the song leaders have to be in their place the ministers have to be in their place and listen as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord listen to what he was saying for his mercy endured forever imagine this you could walk in from the army you walk into the enemy and say praise the lord for his mercy and joy forever you watching the enemy in the face praise the lord for his mercy endured forever i've never seen the righteous forsaken i've never seen his seedback bread oh hallelujah oh hallelujah the prophecy of abraham was upon them to possess the gates of the enemy they had to have confidence in the word of god they had heard he said believe in the lord and you shall be established believe the prophets and so shall he prosper so those worshipers you tell me today brother isaac i don't have much you have worship oh that's enough that's enough to push back that demon yo come on somebody help me this evening that's more than enough [Applause] his mercy endured forever his mercy endure it forever his mercy enjoyed forever his mercy endured forever he may be seated i'm trying to find a place to close out a little bit and they went down before the army i love that and to say praise the lord for his mercy and joy forever and when they began to sing when they began to sing have trouble in your house start singing have trouble in your job start singing have trouble with your children start singing demons coming against you start singing and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and monsieur which will come against judah and they were smitten the law destroyed the enemy the law destroyed the enemy [Applause] listen to what god did he said for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount sir you read that day in other words god turned them to fight among themselves you their worship and singing and you're watching the enemy fighting among themselves [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah didn't he say he will prepare a table for you in the presence of your enemy you will be eating food you just worshipping on your enemy your enemies don't even know what upon them listen to how this unfolds for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of monsieur utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seer everyone held to destroy another so it was three groups when they went for the first group the last two groups that remain fight and kill one another you can't fight like that but the lord he could do that he could do it and he will do it no weapon formed against you shall prosper your family will be delivered your house will be delivered the promise is unto you and to your children could you take some more and listen verse 24 and when judah came toward the watchtower i spoke about tower before right you know where they changed position they went to the elevated position by the cannons they want to see the whole tapestry the whole plan of how it unfold when judah came towards a watchtower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold there were dead bodies fallen to the earth and none escaped not once just like the egyptian you see today you see them no more forever and when jehoshaphates people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance bought riches with their dead bodies and precious jewels which is stripped away for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering the spoil you didn't fight the battle but yes collecting for three days you collecting for three days the reward of obedience the reward for worship the reward for obeying the prophets the reward for following the law's instruction the reward for having faith to take a position against all odds when the enemy is turning you in the face listen i'm reading scripture more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much when the bible tells you brother eclipse it was so much don't you want to shout and worship and obey god and follow his word because he will bless you he will fight battles for you he wants to place you so he can bless you you are his son you are his daughter you are his child he loves you he cares for you [Music] hallelujah my my and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of barakah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of barakah unto this day then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies and they came to jerusalem with soul trees and harms and trumpets unto the house of the lord and listen to this last part this person finish it for me and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel so the testimony went out that these children of israel have a god who fight in their battles with them so fear was on all the countries you talk about having nuclear weapons fear was on these countries the tournaments are just walking and countries are afraid they don't want to mess with these people because messing with these people means messing with their god the devil got to know he can't mess with you because when he messes with you he messes with your god can the church give the lord a shout out [Applause] praise i want to encourage your faith hallelujah i know you would have been preached through so i just want to encourage your faith let me try to kind of place the clothes out oh the musician can get ready hallelujah that's a running true scripture so eve adam fell out of position we talk about being positioned in place right we say it can be back in position or place in position if unless you were out opposition so eve was out opposition because of the fall joseph when joseph is dying he tell them listen take my bones with you right now we're out of position resurrection is coming where we are now so makes one carry my bones into position because when resurrection come even if i'm dead i want to be in position even if i'm dead i want to be in position oh god help me to get into my position by placing christ anybody with me we get into the home stretch now samson during the pandemic he lost his way samson during the pandemic he lost his eyes samson had a promise of how to live oh god but samson lost sight of the vision he lost sight of his purpose he fell from grace you remember we said it at the beginning with your position it has restrictions things you can do so there were consequences but his position pot was being restored while he was grinding at the mill hallelujah his luck was growing back so he was getting back into position but for his great ministry to be unfolded he said for the final showdown he said lead me into position lead me to the pillars that holding up this world economy lead me to the pillars of what hauling up the government lead me to the headquarters of what's happening here he said when you put me there i'll be all right and when he was in position it couldn't happen before he couldn't ask once more lord when he was in the dungeon but when he was in position he said lord once more lord once more lord oh come on now you see a why you need to be in position i'm almost finished trying to close out here esther esther had a ministry esther called for a purpose she didn't really understand it morika i had to tell her esther how do you not know that for such a time as this for such a time as this in this season 2020 for such a time as this all these years we have the prophets and the tapes and the books i would love for such a time as this but you can stay in your room and not testify about it you can't be afraid to go out you have to get into position oh hallelujah and esther got the faith to say take me to the king if i perish i perish but i need to get into position because i need to make a request i got to get into position my family is depending on it my son is depending on it my daughter is depending on it my marriage is depending on it the church is depending on it getting into position i'm encouraging your fate in the book of kings we studied it those four lepers sitting outside they said listen why sit here why sit here and die this position i'd have to be a better place somewhere i can't just die here i've been in the message all these years why am i sitting down it's better if if if if i stay here i'll die if i go inside i die i want to change position i'm willing to go out and face the enemy [Music] oh hallelujah may your faith rise this morning may you take that kind of it not this way in other words if i'm going no not this way not this way i'm not going to let the pandemic take my joy and i'm going to let losing my job take my joy and i'm going to let what happened in my business take my joy i'm not going to like how many years the lord allowed this to go and to take my joy i'm getting into a position [Music] even god had to change his position he was up in glory and there was only so much vehicle if he could have done there he had 10 prophets he had placed kings he had fought battles for them just like what we read with jehoshaphat but for this battle for this showdown he had to get in position he had to get into place so he left glory and not only changed position but changed form he had to come as a man he had to go through a process he had to go to a place of trying he had to pass the tests up he had to be adopted this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased hear ye him he had to pass the same test you have to pass he had to pass the same test i have to pass he had to get the same approval you have to get he has to get the same approval i have to get and the countdown was on peace be still a place son on the earth an adopted son on the earth and then there was this calvary showdown where the atonement would be made you know we read the quote before the atonement before the holy ghost all through the old testament there couldn't be a manifestation until now i'm walking through it right now and after the victory at calvary we know it there was a showdown in hell this adopted son with full power full authority all that god was was in him he left this realm went down to hell he didn't have to ask he didn't have to have a negotiation there was no need for conversation he just took the keys of death and hell and in so doing he weakened satan's position this was satan's second emotion because he was kicked out of heaven and he was operating and he had keys he had locked up job locked up jonah locked up moses locked up david but when jesus came he took the keys you know how embarrassing that was with the devil you want to understand why satan's so mad now he's walking around he walking around hell with no keys even the demons who looked up to the devil start to look at him funny because keys represent authority keys represent power and all that the devil had left was keys of death and hell so no grave where is your victory because the mighty conqueror we took the keys what was god doing he was opening doors he was preparing for the manifestation of the sons of god he was making it possible for more like him give the lord a shout our praise [Applause] he may be seated i'm trying to finish the devil had to have an emergency meeting to figure out how to keep people in bondage because he couldn't lock them up anymore that's why i could see it tonight you can go free if you want to go free that door just look like it's locked it looks like it's locked but it's really open oh hallelujah when jesus walked through he unlocked those doors he unlocked those doors the devil can't hold you your sickness cannot hold you your unbelief cannot hold you no demon could hold you house of hell give way to the name of the lord jesus christ you have no power over the sons and daughters of the living god give the lord a shout our praise [Applause] you may be seated satan had witnessed many miracles over the years hundreds of years but nobody nobody had ever taken his keys nobody had ever walked in and walked back out oh my you wanna know i'm so happy that in the midst of my struggles to know that jesus said because i live you are gonna live also the same words that i do you are going to do also he said i go to prepare a place for you that that where i am you will be also he left and left a body and left out space for us that day without us cannot be made perfect to think that all of this has been leading up to this great climax to a final showdown where what abraham couldn't do and elijah couldn't do and the prophets couldn't do and jesus didn't want to do because he's going to leave his bride to give the final knockout punch in the final showdown to switch this whole world up because we are not going to reign in heaven we are going to reign on this earth this is our jurisdiction and the devil has squatted for way too long but i'm happy to know that the sons of god are coming back in the message who is god brother abraham said what adam lost in the fall christ restored in his debt and god allowed all these messages and these messengers and these church ages i'm closing to bring us to this spot that we can fulfill that quote that brother branham said now is the time for the manifestation of the sons of god at thy word he said after sons there's placing of sons or the adoption of sons so don't be satisfied friends so just be a son you want to be a placed son you want to be a son in position and that could only come by character that could only come by character development i have so much but i want to close out when i plot to close out but about him said what places you is your conductor whoa my my my my my hallelujah i just want to read that to close out and hear him with random said it's your character your conduct that gives god confidence in you the reason we haven't got the great church marching on today is because god can't find people listen to put his confidence in the holy spirits keep saying they're tearing up they're breaking up they're doing this they're off on the line stay with god's word that's god's truth that's the pattern that's the blueprint that's the reason the church today has got all kinds of isms and everything in it because they don't stay with the word if they won't listen to the holy spirit the holy spirit won't testify of one other thing but god's word what places you is your character oh let me find a place to close how do you begin to play something softly oh hallelujah oh hallelujah just worship him just worship him let's worship him just worship him oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my god and the greatest battle ever fought but abraham said in fact let me read from influence first he said the great battles back there had got the loose ends hanging out just over many battles he had a battle of jericho this battle all the way down to ecclesial battles had got the loose ends hanging out so now he's going beyond now he's going beyond just the atonement and and and the holy ghost pouring out and he's coming out to tanner these loose hands only after this great prophet comes down it ought to be all wrapped up together in this last age then when that sounds an angel come down and say time shall be no more whoo we are here brother sister we had a time let's let the holy spirit influence us to the word of god from the greatest bat level fought and the only thing that he's waiting for is for his army to get their position are you in the army like the stars get in their position the great hour of charge is at hand in
