soul Glory Hallelujah Glory oh my soul praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah my soul oh we worship him this morning thank you Jesus praise God so good to see sister Karen over this morning praise the Lord what an experience you know Prophet say he could take it through different things and it's how your thinking and your mindset and everything else I'm been going through something myself the last two weeks after I preach that first message about return to the land headaches back and forth back and forth just terrible but God is good I'm still alive and kicking in the land of the living and in case you don't know that a testimony you wouldn't like to be 6 feet down the ground so you better begin to praise and thank God to be in the land of the living and you're still kicking amen I certainly want to thank brother Kelly Sal for his testimony and [Applause] Frid these sort of testimonies bring glory to the kingdom of God because it shows where your life could be changed your life could be preserved your life could be kept in this present evil time when he shared his testimony about four years ago about the experience of God doing something within him it looked like something to just watch because we have heard people with different testimonies and stories and and whatnot and it just F to the ground but this is years later it is just as strong not only that he investigated his own testimony by the word and by history to see that his something that is real it is tangible that you can be released from your guilt from your shame from your past and you can experience the true forgiveness of God which come by God's works but which come by God's grace by God's word rather okay so I shared something before he came on about entitlement and and and so like that and I just want to bring back something I'm not not the speaker this morning but Isaac would Minister to you this morning but I fell let to come before him to share something to with you and something brother Kelly said and that was so beautiful to me about the opening of the word reveals Jesus you know a lot of ministers talk about the opening of the word and seals and Mysteries and vs and plagues and woves and a lot of drama behind there that looks all exciting and I call it sometime verbal gymnastics flipping words to stimulate the people head and mind but the truth is the revealing of the word supposed to reveal Jesus Christ and at the end of the day if you can't see Jesus something kind of wrong something not cutting it then because we have been through the Pentecostal age 1906 and the Pentecostal speaking in tongues and all their drama and it hasn't worked out because they reject the word so they have no life to this day they still don't have the life I don't care best how much big the churches is how much money they have they still have a battle with life life that's is why this one falling here this one cracking up here this one doing all kind of crazy stuff here because they have a contention with this life well this message come to bring life and and the life is what will give us the test and the trial that will produce character because character is not a gift never will be never can be character I mean now in time like these you'll find how the prophet words are waited that character is not a gift you not you don't have a gift of character you have to go through discipline there a word people don't like to hear because that brings you in order and you want to run and do your own thing and God will have none of it what your parents let you get away with God will not let you get away with You' reap what you Soul do you understand what I'm saying here now okay let's go so but the okay so Jesus in Luke 12:15 says he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness and sometimes we need to go down deeper into certain words we hear cous and just a word but what is conciousness for a man's life this is Jesus own words now consisted not in the abundance of things which he possessed covetousness is an eager or excessive desire especially for wealth or possessions it is characterized by a strong or imoderate desire for what others have in local terms we say people have long eye they see somebody and they want it to and the Heart start to swell and I want that I want that I want that they don't even know the person get that the person rber Bank you don't even know but he sell drugs and what not but the coveres know they lusting after what somebody else have Jesus said Beware of that why would Jesus say that beware of that in other words he wanted man to reject selfishness and greed and pride to reject it not just talk about it to reject that you don't want that to be part of you you you the one that to be part of you you could you could be yourself you know in your pride and arrogance and thing you know but he will humble you if you are son or if you are a daughter he wouldn't leave in your Folly of your pride he will break you to show you who's the boss oh give the Lord some Praises so Jesus was warning against this thing called covetousness greed and entitlement to possession and he taught that a man life is not measured by material wealth that's how the world train now to say well this one have car this one house swimming pool this one have a plane this one have a rocket and therefore he's up somewhere some of the worst siners than people who had a rocket Matthew 202 says 25 and Jesus called unto them and said ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that a great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you whosoever will be among you whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister if you don't understand that let's take the next verse whosoever be Chief among you let him be your servant even as a son of man comparing it came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a answer for many so Jesus actually taught that through service not through a certain power some people can't wait to get them get them power they trouble you know just I always to say if you want to see what a man get them power or give them money money is power you know so what we said before the the Prem uh brother Kelly sh his testimony was sacrifice versus entitlement and you might find me sticking this thing because this is so important I see a spirit of entitlement upon people and it bothers me I Spirit entitlement on the people in the message in church and it bothers me because you will get disappointed and I'm seeing the hurt of the entitlement Spirit they will get hurt because entitlement bring you on expectation and when that expectation not fulfilled you get disappointed I remember in KY there was a brother well he's deceased now and I used to come from ppine and walking and and things that in order and I to go and get to the well and get water and different thing like that and he have upset me because living up the hill and I find from right there to down there what's the point and afterwards I lower my expectation I said maybe you can't do it my problems or what and afterwards I got no disappointment because I had no expectation so I free myself from him I free myself from expecting him to do a certain thing that I am expecting and getting disappointed every time so when you free yourself and that is why the Bible say for God so love the world why God love us for God so love the world he give his own begotten son why he love us you never know reason why suppose God reason because you're tall and everywhere you trying to be tall now because you're slim everywhere you want to be slim before you're fat every you want to be fat God a give no reason to say well why God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth should not perish God just love and that's what love is love just give love does share love Do release Grace love does release Mercy he so love that's all he so love that he give that's his love towards us could we give the Lord some Praises because you don't want you to be under a false expectation to get a great disappointment you have to believe him for his grace and mercy to deliver you and to free you is not what you have done or what you will you will do is what he has already done and he has to do it inside of you that you can give witness of the Grace and the power of the mercy of God we need more testimonies like what brother Kelly [Applause] had because what that reveals is the operation of God do you understand that you up in this way bbing and hubbing and bbing and weaving and and keeping quiet and your under hand and all kind of thing like that that nothing do with God you know when that woman was revealed when Jesus revealed himself to the woman of the well she run and say come see a man she wasn't hesitant and say you know what let better change my dress yes because you look nothing happened to her she one she Dr know she was free to say come see a man who show me all that I did is not this to Christ are you free this morning or do you want to be free this morning God want you to be liberated this morning free from sin free from Fear free from your past free from what your neighbor say Your mother say your father say free from whatever everybody else say free from all that that that you could live and have the Abundant [Applause] Life Hallelujah free to laugh at yourself this the one thing about Donal is that he can't laugh he doesn't laugh at all can't even laugh on itself Donald can't laugh so sacrifice versus entitlement both carries two different mindset sacrifice involves giving up personal desires comfort and I hope you study these things by saying you I hope I'm not speaking to the wind because I'm not speaking because I have nothing else to say you I'm speaking because I believe this is important for you to catch for yourself are you giving up sacrifice involve giving up personal desires what did God ask Abraham to give up his own son that he waited 25 years for and when he Bo know right about 12 years old he say offer him up now to make a sacrifice you got to take a blanket the first blanket and cover this and take the first fastest Maxi Chariot and WR I say go this got be you this got be you write it out but Abram knew God he knew God's voice that's why God could tell you don't bring no B foot L off him don't put all kind of animal where what left back trying to give God God said no you have to better than that you have to inspect the lamb if you're bringing a lamb bring one without blemish because it's God you're bringing it to there's not your Governor this is God oh give the Lord some praises and if you are to become a sacrifice God want you to give your best go just give your hand and amen and your mouth going and your head thinking somewhere else give you he want you oh give the Lord a shout he don't want your dress he don't want your tie he don't want your shoes he want you as a sacrifice on his altar [Music] [Applause] this is Sunday you know we here to [Music] worship sacrifice involves giving up personal desires comfort and resources for the benefit of others or a greater cause it comes from a heart of selflessness and humility Romans 121 we read it before I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable to God with a reasonable service it's not your body is UN loan to you so you go and tattoo that up you know we're going on on T up God house you go and smoke that up what going on you're get House of good smoking you're boozing you're boozing you're boozing you see what going inside that house and God said that is my hous I give you that house am entitlement entitlement focuses on personal gain and comfort with the belief that one inherently deserves privileges or benefits without necessarily earning them you want a promotion why you want more work or just one more pay everybody could do with more pay but the higher you go is the more work you to do I want to say walk I want to say like like a chicken not work work walk so normal clar or whatever it is you got corporate lad manager then director then man and you're going up higher higher means me more headache hire mean more more more board meetings hire means not 8 to4 no more you can't handle that but go back down the ladder to go to 84 so you feel entitled and that's what I'm to all the Bandit and Crooks you know they enill the entitle to your pay that they working for so they entit to wait for you to get your money to R you do you understand what I'm saying they find work too hard so so they wait for you to work and then they had the gun and they're looking to get on alternative employment by rubbing you but God is the one who set up work isn't that right so watch this so you cannot expect to be promoted without Desiring the work necessary to go with that promotion because if it doesn't produce the work to get the promotion you are fit for demotion you understand that you have something in the market say when the market is uh over how they say it boy when it too high now sometime a stock gone too high when a man promote himself he gone too high it is due for correction only time corrects that are bringing back in order so entitlement focusing on personal gain comfort with the belief that one inherently deserves privileges or benefits without necessarily earning them this mindset focused more on rights and expectation rather than on there we go responsibilities or obligation to towards others it can lead to selfishness or an exaggerated sense of one's importance and that's why I read that scripture do have it here now of Jesus was saying when you're invited to a wedding take the lowest seat and the reason somebody taking the higher seat because they seat themselves as important so they say but you see that seat it tall it high had gold on us and I just feel that he kind of seat that I supposed to sit and you take your cool you relax in the comfort of that seat only to find out somebody more worthy than you the bride sister or the bridegroom brother come and say excuse me you invited you know it's not that you send out but you had to go down so so Jesus was saying don't carry yourself with that support you know who I am no I don't know who you are you want the dust that God say you're born in sin and shape iniquity just like everybody else you I'm saying no prime minister say God you know I am prime minister recognize that God you know who I am my here long God I look at my face last I look very pretty God don't see Soul you know and if you sin sick the soul that s that God not looking at your flesh your height your color complexion your race country who your father is is your mindset one of offering your yourself to God as a sacrifice valuing humility over self-importance or are you expecting to receive without deserving it holding on to selfishness and pride without doing necessary work watch that word work Philippians 2: 34 I'm almost finished let nothing be done to Strife of V Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on a things of other okay so I'm wrap up with Matthew 20 this the parable a form Parable but I want to show you something in this Parable for the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that has a householder that went out early in the morning to hire laborers in his Vineyard and when he had agreed with the laborers watch this a penny a day he send them in the vineyard he went out about the third hour saw others standing idle in the marketplace said to them go you into the vineyard whatsoever is right I will give it you note he didn't tell him a penny and they went their way again he went out about the sixth and 9th hour did likewise about the 11th hour he went out from other standing idle said unto them why stand he here all day idle they said to him because no man had heard us he said unto them go ye into the vine and whatever is right yes that shall he receive he didn't tell them he given them a penny so when even was come the lord of the vineard watch the words sayth unto his ch call the laborers give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first ver n and when they came that were hired about the L Tower they received Every Man a penny but when the first came they suppos this is the expectation this is the expectation this is the expectation that they were entitled to more even though the vineyard the lord of the master agreed with them for penny that was the contract that's what they signed for when they came they were H about hour they receive every man of Penny when the first came they supposed that they had received more and likewise receive every man of Penny when they had received it they murmured that disappointment when they get trouble because you're on expectation to receive more because you started early you started first but you signed the contract that I'm going to be paid a penny you have it on paper you have it on the master but he choose to give you the penny he give you the penny that you deserve he you give you the penny that you agree to when they receive it the movement against the good man of the house saying these last have rought but one hour they're just come in and thou has made them equal unto us so what they're saying they're not equal because we walking heart this morning and these only put in one hour work hear the words now but thou has made them equal to us which have borne the burden and heat of the day and he answered one of them and said friend is the master speaking and I want us to get this to the church this morning friend I do the no wrong did not thou agree with me for a penny take that thine is and go thy way I will give unto this last even as unto theej it didn't stop there is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own is thine eye evil because I am good so he is saying I am God this is good this morning I could choose to forgive the dirtiest filthiest sinner I could choose to restore the furthest backslider I could bring back those who never thought they would come back because I am God and God Alone is it not lawful for me [Music] to do what I will with my own is thine IE evil because I am good so the last shall be first and the first last for many are called but few are chosen so God is showing he have a right to be generous and give the Holy Ghost to those who ask him he has a right to be generous and release Grace into your life am don't condemn yourself more than the devil is doing let God have his way with you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you you are entitled to what God want to release to you when God pardoned that woman that was caught in the very Act of adultery she said woman go and send no more and he released that woman and you can't tell God he cannot do that God is suffering he is suffering this morning oh glory to God and you can do a special work praise God hallelujah hallelujah oh give the Lord praise God and but Isaac comes up Hallelujah Glory you want be seated this one blow my mind from Luke 17:10 and it says here Jesus is in Red so likewise ye when ye have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do Jesus was telling his own disciples what to say in keeping and maintaining and having the right mindset yes and the Amplified it says even so on your part when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you say we are unworthy servants possessing no merit for we have not gone beyond our obligation we have merely done what was our duty to do so Jesus actually taught humility yes sir do you get that he actually taught humility having a humble in service without no expectation or entitlement at the end you could say I'm unprofitable Lord ah Lord Jesus thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you attitude of humility and gratitude and a complete rejection of entitlement but Anthony I want to sing a song for it I say come on oh praise I trust these words will help you praise the name of God hallelujah hallelujah praise

he's a way maker so we thank you for your prayers all the greetings all the uh reaching out and the questions and the support and you know it's it it it means a lot and meant a lot and it continues to mean a lot so let's go to the word this morning I want to read one portion of scripture uh from the book of Hebrews a very familiar scripture and I'm looking for God to do something tremendous in our midst this morning so reading Hebrews 11 from verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the word is important your words are important God's word is important the words were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God what a testimony to have what a testimony I want to have do you want to have that testimony that you pleased God wonderful but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so not just those that seek him but those that diligently seek Him by faith Noah being warned of God of things not yet as not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an arc to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have have should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went that's what faith does it makes you go places not knowing where you're going to end up at times by Fai he ajour in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of her child when she was was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sandwiches by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth so so they saw something a far off they couldn't access it they couldn't touch it they didn't receive the promise but they they were persuaded with just seeing the promise that was enough to keep them going have you seen enough to keep you going have you seen enough to not backslide have you seen enough to not give up they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things plainly declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from W they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is a Heavenly in other words they looking for a Heavenly country Heavenly citizenship Heavenly residency wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he had prepared for them a city by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac that he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he he received him in a figure by Faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph and worship leaning upon the top of his staff by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones and we know that was he say when you leave here carry my bones with you because I know a Resurrection coming he is saying it by faith he knows there's something bigger than himself he said don't leave my bones here because this is not the place where the bones will be Resurrected there's not only a Resurrection coming but there's a place where the resurrection will take place so don't leave my bones in this place can the church say Amen Hallelujah by faith my Moses when he was born was HD three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment so Faith removed fear Faith gave them courage to do what they had to do by faith Moses when he come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he said don't call me that Hallelujah I may have grown up in Pharaoh's house I may have grown up in Pharaoh's daughter's house but don't call me the son of Pharaoh's daughter because I know who I am I have a spiritual identity I have a spiritual consciousness can the church say Amen am choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ's greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they pass through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do were drown by Fate the walls of Jericho fell down after they had compassed about seven days by faith the hot Rahab perish not with them believed not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jeffa of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms uh wrought righteousness uh obtained promises uh stopped the mouths of lions uh quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cural mockings and scourgings yeah moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown aunder they were tempted were slain with the sword they wondered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted torment and listen to what Paul says here of whom the world was not worthy in other words the world was not worthy of these men can the church say Amen the way they lived with all of their mistakes with occurrence with all of their faults Paul is saying this world we in is not worthy of the character of these men there's something about them that establishes that they come from somewhere else that this Earthly terrestrial plane we are in is not worthy of some people are there anybody in anybody in the house this morning that the world is not even worthy of you being here can the church see oh that's a shouting moment right there Paul is saying the world was not worthy they lived above the world with all their mistakes with all their faults they lived above the world of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received under the promise God having provided some better thing for us there's better than them for us there's better than that what they went through for us that they without us should not be made perfect may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning can we give the Lord a hand of Praise Hallelujah so we are here by faith we are living by faith you woke up this morning by faith you came to church by faith you wake up to go to work by faith you start your car by faith you hire a taxi by faith say good morning by faith sometime you say good morning and you're hoping it's a good morning you're saying it by faith oh you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah Lift Your Hand by faith you worship God by faith you believe by faith you hold on to the promise of God by faith without faith it is impossible to please God so you can't start to please God unless you have faith to believe that he's a Healer that he's a way maker that he's a restorer that he's going to help your family I don't know what condition you're in but by faith he's going to help them I don't know how I don't know when I don't know how it's going to work out but I have faith that he's going to send a Revival I have faith that he going to heal the I have faith this morning he's going to raise the dead I have faith this morning he's going to open the blind eyes uh I have faith this morning that the My Wayward Daughter I don't care what condition she is she's coming back in this morning I have faith this morning that my bills are going to get paid I have faith this morning but my high blood pressure will come back normal I have faith Fai this morning that this Mortal will put on immortality I have faith this morning that this body is predestinated for a body change I have faith this morning that I'm going to get the Holy Ghost I have faith this morning that I'm going to be adopted by Faith by faith without faith it's impossible to please God by faith Noah build an ark and we are building an ark this morning by faith the lion's mouth was shut and we are here to shut some lion's mouth this morning by faith we can look at our trial look at our Goliath look at our problem and say the same Faith they had we have this morning and if they overcame by faith we are going to overcome that way also and if they did it without what we have how much more us they didn't receive the promise but we have the promises and we are waiting for the Fulfillment of every promise that belongs to us can the church say amen hallelujah you know what's amazing about Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 count some names and if you go through these names every one of these names had mistakes and failures and problems associated with them none of these names with a kangi had a perfect walk except Enoch Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God can the church say Amen there's no scripture we could find to point a finger to Enoch he was just different but everybody else we go through them we could find something that we could identify we could see where Moses fell we could see where Samson fell we could see where Gideon fell we can see where Abraham fell we could see it all through the scripture but somehow they made it to Hebrews 11 oh you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah whenever you wonder if somebody's going to make it Hallelujah I can imagine somebody say I wonder if Samson going to make it and until Paul came and and wrote Hebrews 11 they say you know he made it can the church say amen and I'm here to tell you this morning there's a there's an extension of Hebrews 11 that's being written that's being written and there are some more names in there because Paul said it's only because of time I can't call all the names you don't hear me this morning if I had more time there' be some more names to call oh I I feel religious this morning oh by faith my name is in there by faith your name is in there Hallelujah you might look defeated you might look frustrated but Faith by faith my name is in Hebrews [Applause] 11 hallelujah hallelujah somebody give God praise this morning [Applause] Hall we could spend a whole service talking about the failures of Samson we could spend a whole service talking about the H at Rahab that God loves to take broken people people with issues people with trouble people who made mistakes people who came from bad past and bad history people with a messed up resume and put them in Hebrews 11 Hallelujah as a hero of F I always said when I preach on the the the the genealogy of Jesus Matthew 1 the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham it blew my mind because even Abraham with his mic wasn't as bad as it would seem as David Jesus could have choose whoever you want to be born under you know but he choos a mess of people for part of his lineage so this morning I have a message to encourage you to inspire you and for us to Rel look at our vows and our commitments so for a title this morning by the grace of God everybody feel it fine wonderful a title this morning the outlaw who became a judge the outlaw who became a judge and we're going to spend some time in the Book of Judges this morning to pick up some things in there that I trust will be a blessing to you and an encouragement to you now the Book of Judges within there has some very critical Biblical characters because when you look at Hebrews 11 it really Maps out from the patriarch all the way down to Rahab so it dealt with from Abraham Isaac Jacob everybody and then there's this bridge where he deals with those within judges who he chose to call out so Gideon Barrack Samson jeffa those were part of the judges around 12 or so judges and the judges were the bridge between Joshua and the Kings so after the last judge you have the prophet Samuel and you have Saul coming up as the first king so you have the Patriarchs all the way to Joshua then you have the judges then you have the kings that will come after everybody with me this morning and under the judges men did what it was in their own Hearts everybody feeling LED I feeling led to do this I feeling led to do this and God had to send judges to minister to guide to lead and most importantly to deal with the cycle of rebellion sin idolatry and restoration that they went through in the Book of Judges so in the Book of Judges you have Samson dealing with the Philistines you have Gideon dealing with the medion nightes all critical pieces of the puzzle so this morning we want to spend some time talking about jeffa because many of us we read him in the book of Hebrews but we never really spend time looking at this why is jeffa there amen that's what I want to know why is Jeff's name included in there what's so special about jeffa that he say and Gideon and bar and jeffa and Samson can the church say Amen so we want to go to Judges chapter 10 and we want to read from verse six are you with me this morning and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord again it was the cycle over the last few weeks we have been preaching about the war of priests the war of altars we have been talking about putting away the strange Gods we have talking about your body being a temple of the Holy Ghost and here it was we are seeing here in judges 10 uh 106 and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and served I want to watch that word served bam and ASAT the gods of Syria and the gods of sidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines and forsook the Lord and served him not amen friends here we find the children of Israel after having been delivered from Egypt after seeing the Miracles after seeing judges already come before church Gideon already pass through Gideon Ministries already done at this point in time dealing with the midianites god already has delivered them over and over again and here it is they are now finding new Gods I want to pause there for a minute they're finding five different gods to worship and if you study in scripture and scriptural history and I'm bringing this to a point for us to bring some Deliverance to somebody in here every God that they serve the people enslaved them so when they give serving to the god of the Philistines the Philistines enslaved them when they serve the god of the the Ammon the ammonites enslave them and I want to say to you this morning whatever you serve will control you amen if you serve the god of money the god of money will will will control you if you have some Idol in your life and the moment and serving I want you to understand what serving means serving mean doing the bidding you know so you're not serving the lord you're serving something so we use the word worship and many times we see worship as okay you could worship anything anything could be your God but serving is the acts you do in support of that God can we take some time this morning I want to make sure because when people say I'm not getting a breakthrough and I'm not seeing my way who are you serving I want you to look at it deeper than just is who you worship is your God because your servitude is your time your effort what you're doing speaks to what you're serving and whatever you serve controls you whatever you serve you bow down to them can the church say Amen so I want to get it again the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and served Bim and ASAT and the gods of Syria and and the gods of sidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines and forsook the Lord and served not him and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the children of Ammon you want to serve the music you want to serve the Styles you want to serve the Fashions well fine go ahead can the church say amen amen and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel 18 years all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the amorites which is in Gilead moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim so that Israel was so distressed so because of their sin because of what they worship because of what they spend their time they end up in bondage again saw distress for how long for8 years can the church say Amen we're building to something and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken Our God and also served BM and the Lord and I want you to catch this friends and the Lord said unto the children of Israel did not I deliver you from the Egyptians and from the amorites from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines the sidonians also and the amalekites and the moonit did oppress you and you cried to me and I delivered you out of their hand yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore I will deliver you no more listen to verse 14 go and cry unto the gods which you have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation can the Church Say Amen I want to pause here for a little bit what is God saying why didn't he respond to the cry because friends recognizing your sin doesn't mean repentance having remorse about your sin doesn't mean repentance acknowledging that you regret a decision doesn't mean you actually repented crying at the altar and saying I am sorry doesn't mean repentance anybody with me so God say I'm not accepting this cry you have here because you're crying because you're looking for anybody to help you you already want me to help you you know you're in trouble so you're crying as if you come to me and I'll just help you every single time you mess up and you do the thing over and over anybody with me this morning I hope this helped somebody this morning you know many of us say well Lord I'm really sorry and I regret it and I'm coming back to you because you're living in regret and remorse but you're not repentant because when you're repentant repent mean to turn away from oh come on now repent mean to change your ways so you recognizing I want this to stick because this is a big issue here you recogniz in your mess up and say Lord I recognize that I sin I recognize I make a mistake help me God say I still listening because I hear repentance yet I you see true repentance yet you recognizing you sin you having remorse about what you did you having regret about you did is not repentance God is looking for true repentance you looking to say Lord turning away today I'm willing to cut it off today I'm willing to turn around today somebody preach back to me so let's make sure you get this here so the two of Israel Under Pressure why are they Under Pressure because they serve false gods they throw God out of the picture they know better they have been through enough God has dealt with them enough and they throw God out the picture well God say okay fine you serve what you want to serve when they are under pressure they cry out they say Lord help us he said don't call my name anymore go to the gods you serve and let them help you I want to make sure there sticks verse 15 now there's a different change that taking place here and the children of Israel said unto the Lord we have sinned do unto us whatsoever seeth good unto thee Deliver Us only we pray thee this day and now listen to going beyond the words because this is where many of us miss the Mark friends we it's easy to come to the Altar and say Lord help me deliver me save me I repent and but you you have every intention of going back to do the same thing look what it took for God to respond in verse 16 and they put away the strange Gods from among them can I say that one more time and they put away the strain Gods from among them and serve the Lord and his soul talking about the Lord was grieved for the misery of Israel so only when they put away the strange Gods God say okay now now I can get involved because the first time you came to me you were still living with the gods oh you don't hear me this morning the first time you came for me to pray for you you're still mining the situation but when you're willing to put away these strange Gods Noah could intervene and and heal you and and and wipe your tears and bring Deliverance to your home and to your family so brother Anthony preached about it we've been preaching about it are you ready to put away the strange Gods anything that is strange we don't want no strange gods in your life no strange gods in your home no strange gods in your family no strange clothes no strange music no strange forms of worship no strange Idols put away the strange God so that God could operate in your life oh can somebody preach back to me you want to see the power of God true repentance means putting away the strange Gods you have to say I'm not going that way anymore I'm not going to do that thing anymore I'm walking away from the world can the church say amen hallelujah one time I want to preach a message on the emotions of God because God gets happy you know he gets sad he gets upset God in in Genesis say he repented he made man because what he saw was not what he wanted to see the sin had reached him and here it was God reached a point of frustration he said your one prayer your one prayer go to the gods who you serve in until they came with true repentance is there anybody this morning I want have true repentance you're really willing to throw the worldly clothes out and the worldly friends out and the worldly relationships out throw away forication throw away adultery those are all gods throw away the music and his sty and the fashion and your idea could be your God too you know oh yes your feeling could be a God your interpretation could be a God your job could be a God your idea could be a God because you're serving that and not serving the word itself but the moment they say we putting away the strange gods and God to see it that is not God don't want an explanation of what you do know he wants to see action this morning he want to see you put fire in your home he wants to see you at your altar he want to see you praying that's how you show God repentance oh you don't hear me this morning repentance is not a phrase repentance is not a word repentance is not saying Lord I'm sorry he wants to see your change that on the inside you really want to change or you don't hear me this morning I want this to stick to somebody you know how much time people come to the Altar and his lip service and they intend I want to say it again they intend to go and live in sin they intend to go back into pornography they intend to go back into fornication they intend to go back into drinking smoking lying whatever it is and God is saying away with it you want to serve those Gods serve those Gods but if you want my Deliverance get away those strange Gods burn the strange Gods clean out your life clean out your home throw the movie out throw the books out whatever it is that's taking you away from serving the Living God burn it today I want to see you do it I'm not coming to help you God is not turning your heart away from the strange Gods let me say that again young people God is not coming to turn your heart from the strange Gods you have to want it you have to say Lord I don't want to live that way and I'm making a change there are some people you got to delete their phones their phone numbers from your phone there are some things you got to stop doing you got to do what ever it take to get the Strange God out of your heart out of your mind out of your life can the church say [Applause] amen that's that's true repentance true repentance Allowing God to work and the moment God saw it his emotions his feeling about them change the Bible said because before this he wasn't at grief but the moment verse 16 and the put away the strange Gods from among them and serve the Lord oh my and his soul his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel it was God who allowed them to go into bondage because of the way they were living but the moment he saw true repentance with occurrence his soul began to grieve for the misery so you mean there are some people in misery that God isn't grieving about because they haven't truly repented yet so God still waiting to feel something about them because they haven't reached the point of repentance why didn't they do it after the first year or the second year or the third year they were taking pressure until it became too much it was only after 18 years and and we could take a lot of stress and pressure you know and that's why I say some people have to go through more pain to bring them to the Lord that's why B Bram say a love to get you desperate then conditions will don't wait till 18 years to reach your breaking point to start to call upon the Lord if you need the Lord call upon him today he wants to hear you and he wants to see you do something about your situation can the church say Amen anybody in the house this morning can we continue a [Music] bit true repentance verse 17 and then the children of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead and the children of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mespa and the people and princes of Gilead said one to another what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead oh my goodness so now they're ready to fight for 18 years but the George is sitting on there under pressure but they have Cried unto the Lord and they feel a wrestle in the mber retree they feel the season is changing and they say is there anybody in the house who could fight against the armies of the enemy is there a man among us is there a great warrior among us we know about Warrior Joshua we know about the warrior Gideon we know what we went through but we're looking for somebody this morning who is brave enough who's willing enough to take the fight to the enemy we feel the time has come we have put away the strange Gods we have cleaned up our houses we have restored the altars we are looking for God to do something is there anybody in the house who could fight for us and if this man could fight for us he can lead us can the church say Amen what a position to be in to know that you have put away the strange Gods you have clean up your life Your Heart Is Right your house in order you wake up in the morning there's a joy in your heart you're praying every day you know your Lord is with you and you're just looking for somebody who can lead you into battle you're looking for King Jesus you're looking for the captain of the host because they know the testimonies of the old days uh how the Lord LED them they know what it was to be delivered from the amalekites and the Hittites and the jebusites but you can't go into war without a general oh God sent us a general this morning who could lead us into battle can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my my my so the the FI you may be see the Fate of the people were Rising because they know God had to move among them again because the moment you move the strange Gods from your life you start to feel the presence of God come back in your house oh come on somebody preach back to me light and dark can't live in the same house but the moment you put the strange gos out you begin to feel the rustle in the mberry tree you begin to hear the still Small Voice you begin to feel it in the atmosphere oh come on now and then the prayer changed the prayer all along was Lord Deliver Us the Lord help us Lord we need a touch but now the prayer changed so who will go for us who will fight for us who will lead us into battle we are ready to go and fight we know who we are but we need a general God send us a general this morning Hallelujah somebody give what a shout of praise [Applause] Hallelujah so it is against this backdrop we enter judges 11 to meet a man called jeffa judges 11 and verse one now jeffa the gileadite was a mighty man of Allah Lord give us Mighty Men of Allah Hallelujah men who Not Afraid men who not ashamed men who could fight the good fight of Fate men who are warriors Hallelujah Glory now jeffa the gileadite was a mighty man of Allah I want to get this any he Amplified as well because there's some things we want to bring out here that I think is important for us to ponder on this morning are you with me you're here for the you're here for the day right now jeffa the gileadite was a mighty man of Valor and he was the son of a hot yes he was the son of a prostitute and Gilead begat jeffa and Gilead's wife bear him sons and his wife's Sons grew up and they Thrust out Jeff and said unto him Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house for thou art the son of a strange woman so here we have a young man as it were who has a natural aptitude to be a fighter but his birth is under some troubling circumstances he don't fit the mold of the of the true son of soil as it were he's the son of a prostitute and the reason I want to call it the outlaw who became a judge is because under the law in Deuteronomy it says in Deuteronomy 232 a bastard shall not enter the congregation of the Lord even to his 10th Generation Hallelujah shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord so not only is he son of a prostitute but he's an entitled to title he can't qualify for land he not allowed to go into the temple in the way others could because he have a bad birth now I want to touch on something here because he couldn't control his birth he had nothing to do with how he was born you had nothing to do with how you end up here can the church say amen and because of his resume because of the Circ some sances of his bir they say we don't want you around know verse three then jeffa fled from his Brethren they say get out of here we don't want you here we don't want to inherit no land belong to you you're not supposed to be in your house who you use use a half brother you're not really a full brother you talk about pressure you know people could be then fled from his Breen and dwelt in the land of tub and there gathered with a punch and they were gathered vain men to jeffa in the Amplified it says then jeffa fled from his brothers and lived in a Land of tub and worthless and unprincipled men gathered around jeffa and went out on raage with him so pushing jeffa out of the house turned jeffa into a real bad boy jeffa is what you would call a community leader a gang leader he's a bad man he big he's a valiant he's a the Bible is listen when the Bible say was a mighty man of Valor that not just a man of Valor a mighty man of Valor that's how it start judges 11 before you go down to his pedigree and his history and his family line you know he's a bad man he's a big man he's a man if he's your friend you want him to be your friend but if he's your enemy you don't want him to be your enemy because he could beat up real people can the church say amen and against this backdrop and I want you to contextualize it that's why we read Hebrews 11 because this bad man this gang leader this community leader this man as we say in Trinidad was with a bunch of wless men that's what the Bible says and God moved this man from judges and put him into the book of Hebrews you tell me my God can't take anybody with any background with any story your birth your history your resume your what you went through what you do wrong the Bible said he went and raided he to rob people he to beat up people he to torment people he a terrorize [Applause] [Music] people whether it was his desire to be had bad boy or not we don't know but we know his family pushed him and sometime people push people into a situation where have no choice or you don't hear me this morning whatever it was jeffa was no longer welcome in his own home anybody ever studied this story JEA fled from his bedroom fled is not running fled is like he he got out of it he had to escape lived in the land of tub and worthless and unprincipled men gathered around jeffa and went out on raids with him that's in the Amplified went out with him that went out with him mean he went to do bad things he went to terrorize people as the say goes so it's against his backdrop that we go into verse four and it came to pass in process of time that the children of Ammon made war against Israel and it was so that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel the Elders of Gilead went to fetch jeffa out of the land of tuba so brother George I want you to see this the same brother who couldn't come to church with them the same brother who they say you can't inherit nothing you can't eat at the table you have to eat outside you're not part of the family you're big by a that bad go outside all of that he grew up with when waterm flower but the Ashby and these ammonites putting pressure on the children of Israel the elders say here this now you know that boy used to be here bad boy the trouble The Outlaw he out there terrorizing people now send they send the deacons know they send the elders they say go and find jeffa and tell jeffa we need JEA what an encouragement friends and this is so many ways to look at this there's something of value you have no matter where you at there's value in your life no matter what situation you end up in there's value can I say that again there's value you have value so while the world is looking at jeffa as an outlaw as a terrorist there's still value in jeffa this is just a little bible study to encourage you this morning and it was so that when the children of Israel made war against Israel the the the children of Ammon made war against Israel the Elders of Gilead went to fetch jeffa out of the land of to they themselves venture out of the comfort of Gilead went to the land of to and say all you know all you know who I looking for I looking for a big man he he's strong he tall he's go by name jeffa say you want to talk to jeffa you know who jeffa is you sure you want to going to talk to jeffa I imagine the ERS you looking oh you looking for the baddest man in top we looking for jeffa they invite jeffa to talk to them they went there we say we you say you know when people strange people come into a community that rough you see you sure you the way going you know this road you on brother had a friend of mine drove down some Street and somebody flagging on and say brother you know where you're going if you know where you're going wether turn around cuz this street I don't think you need I don't think you need to meet anybody in this street so here it is them Elders brother George driving down the road into tub and they looking for a junior Batman they're looking for the head of the Batman themselves because jeffa was the leader this who you looking about Jeff they said we don't know who these guys are and I can imagine I wonder but the clar when jeffa see them coming what ran through Jeff's mind because just like Joseph he had a reason to say but look at these what men who supposed to be Godly men now I sure they only come in here because they want [Applause] something they never did like I us to go to church there you know and nobody used to greet me and they us I used to always Fe some kind of way anybody with me this morning verse six and they said unto jeffa come and be our captain I wonder what Jeff's men around jeffa looking at jeffa saying but wait now who is who is jeffa really boy because all the time we going on raids with jeffa and of course everybody knowbody children of Israel they knowbody the tribes it's like jeffa who are you really boy because we seen some Elders from the church looking for you jeffa you undercover all these years leading us here all these years you you are under don't tell me you undercover believer all that bad man thing you putting on so let me find out that you really used to be in church on the front row come on somebody help me preach this morning don't let me find [Applause] out we don't know about the judge we don't know about the C of Jud say Brothers let me talk at the side now I don't want them bad boys to hear what we talking about Hallelujah I don't want them to know I'm really a Christian on the inside inside there's something bubbling in my soul but it's just because I felt rejected I was out here doing what I doing but I always knew on the inside there's something inside of me that kind of kept [Applause] anybody with me this morning hlj but look at the contrast from a man who is rejected he is despised he can't fit in he don't belong your mother was a hoe and that is what they would have said to him and they said unto jeffa come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of Ammon amen now I want you to see something very peculiar about this particular judge if you look back at the story of Gideon who called Gideon the Bible said an angel of the Lord came to Gideon as a judge he was called by an Angel Samson was born with a Nazarite vow because the angel came and speak to his parents not so so there are other judges between the judges dispensation where it was clear that God was involved at the very beginning of the story but here we see a man we see no mention of God calling him at the beginning of his story oh you don't hear me this morning I feel more a connection with jeffa than any other judge because there was no angel came and talked to me at the beginning of my journey I was a bad boy and God came and found me somebody preached back to me Samson had an angel come and talk to his parents you had an angel come and talk to your parents you had an angel come and meet you but God is able to take back Boys Bad Girls people who messed up people who made mistakes people who walked away people who backslid and say come I could use you I could use your messed up story I could use your messed up history I could use all of that and still move you straight from Outlaw into Hebrews 11 move you straight from Outlaw to a judge somebody say [Applause] amen hallelujah can we go on some more so verse 6 and they said un the jeffa come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of Ammon verse seven I I would like to believe that at this point Jeff has pulled away from his whole gang because they could really understand this conversation here because here je jeffa is now being seen as vulnerable but a punch no Community leader no gang leader I want to be seen as vulnerable you have to you have to put on a good show even Joseph when he saw his brothers the B say he went in the back and cry wash your face and and then come back out because no leader lies to show vulnerability anybody with me so here jeffa in verse 7 saying and jeffa said unto the Elders of Gilead did not you hate me and expel me out of my father's house and why are you coming me now when you are in distress why you now start to see my word why you now seeing my value when I was with you you didn't value me am but now you're under pressure all of a sudden I'm your friend all of a sudden I'm somebody who you want to associate with because you can't deal with your problems and I can help you you don't even mind breaking your own law amen because the LA say I shouldn't be there I can't be even a leader I can't belong in the tribe but because you're under so much pressure you willing to break the law to bring an outlaw into the law anybody with me this morning and the elders you have to trust how many appreciate the elders [Applause] the elders says and the Elders of Gilead said unto Jeff therefore we have return unto thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of Ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead in the Amplified the Elders of Gilead said to jeffa this is why we have turned to you now that that you may go at us and fight the ammonites and become h over all the inhabitants of Gilead the son of a prostitute who was rejected from his home who had no right to title or inheritance now being given the opportunity to sit as CEO of the entire [Applause] Community can the church say Amen could you take some more because this thing have some some thing in here we need to finish you can't just stop halfway we need to we need to go all the way to the end of this thing today all [Applause] right verse n and jeffa said unto the Elders of Gilead if you bring me home I like how he still call it home yesall even though he living in tub and being a gangster for years he still know where home is there's no place like going home Jeff to know as bad as things was home is always over there they rejected me there but that is is my home there's no place like home that's why we have a homecoming service can the church say amenallah and jeffa said unto the Elders of Gilead if you bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon and the Lord deliver them before me shall I be your head he want to verify you know there was he watching and writing will I really be ahead veryy you say just say it again one more time for me because Jeff had to be in shock you know he is a man who not qualified for the job being given a the best job without he didn't apply for the job this is head hunting at his very best for anybody in HR this is the biggest head hunting you could find in scriptural and historical history the hiring of jeffa for the role of CEO or leader of the Gilead verse 10 and the Elders of Gilead s jeffa the Lord be witness between us if we do not so according to thy words in other words the Lord is the witness that if you come to fight with us you will be the leader the Lord is the one signing off this thing can the church say amen I don't know how jeffa tell his men in to what the plan was I don't know who he left in ch I don't know what happened next but them fellas over there but all them fellas over there see is jeffa packing up his gangster thing he on he ganger outfit and jeffa put back on his Gilead outfit and jeffa start to walk back with the elders so verse 11 say then jeffa went with the Elders of Gilead and the people made him you could imagine the celebration and what a contrast brother the Clans he left running out he left embarrassed he left not telling any body when they ask him who your mother is he say I don't want to talk about that because that was the source of his his whole issue but here it is jeffa walking back into Gilead and the people say brother Jeff brother je brother Jeff look Jeff I want you to see the picture of this you know the contrast of when God because this is not jeffa coming for Redemption now it's God who called jeffa and when God call you it don't matter who rejected you who sent you out who despise you who have problem with you when God say ready for you they have to be saying je je je because it's God hallelujah hallelujah I tell you friends when God ready for you and God ready to lift you up your past will be inconsequential your history your story it will not matter because God is a redeemer and this story is a story of the sovereignty of God God is Sovereign he can use whoever he wants to use Hallelujah somebody give God a shout of Praise this should set anybody free if you have a messed up story this is your freedom service Give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] hallah we only we we see we this thing eating good but then jeffa went with the Elders of Gilead and the people made him head and Captain there two things you know head and Captain over them and jeffa uttered all his words before the Lord in mispa so I want you to catch now all of us yesterday you're raiding people house H yesterday you hold up somebody oh God help yesterday you're a bad boy but today he uttering words before the Lord you talk about God's power to transform God's power to take somebody and turn them [Applause] around when he need is there when your time to come you can't help but come jeffa didn't have a choice because there was a SE in him that was already written in Hebrews 11 before he woke out his name was already [Applause] there woo [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah listen friends nothing surprises God or know jeffa was walking in a story written by the author and finisher of our faith Hallelujah God already saw this whole thing play out jeffa was just walking in his part of the story oh come on now somebody help me this morning I want to remind you when God ready for your son there's nothing could stop it when God is ready for your daughter nothing could stop it when God ready for your husband your wife your nothing could stop [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it the outlaw who became a judge yesterday he's Outlaw today he's judge yesterday he's Outlaw today he is head yesterday he is Outlaw today he's a captain yesterday in the world today in the house of the Lord yesterday you don't know where you stand today you have a revelation of who you are yesterday you're all confused but today something over [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you could we go on some more so the bad man reach you see how God like to use God like to use your history and your story as part for his glory you know oh come on now can I say that one more time I didn't plan to say that but Steph but it sound good God like to use your history and your story for part of his glory god wanted a bad man for this role when God wanted to write the bulk of the New Testament he wanted an orator he wanted a writer he wanted an academy called Paul who sat at the feet of gel Paul's history helped him fit the role that God put him in everything you are going through is to prepare you for the role that God wants to put you in don't be discouraged with your journey don't be discouraged with how God take you through some through the fire some through the flood some through great trials but all come through the blood to fit the place they fit in the Great Pyramid of God oh [Applause] Hallelujah listen friends you cannot change your past if you could have erase it we would all do it but is God who allowed you to go through that don't get vexed with me because of my past I can't be vexed with you God allow you to go through that to build you a certain way to fit a certain piece of this great puzzle [Music] so the bad man jeffa they're watching him now because you have to let a leader lead when it put him to lead you can't give a man leadership and then tell him you're not leading you can't ask him how you doing it how you do how your high meal lead right so the first thing but the punch they expect Jeff to do is to use the same bad boy tactics see tomorrow you running up in there strap up everybody strap up let me go strap up ready soon could you imagine more punch the moment reach he say strap up let me go ready that's how that Trin a rich what you carrying let me go ready no look at the measure of leadership and character from this outlaw verse 12 Jeff because and again true scripture you really have to be anointed and inspired know the bad man s to operate like a diplomat jeffa went to arbitration before he went to war anybody with me this morning so verse 12 and jeffa sent Messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon saying what hast thou to do with me he already claimed ownership of the whole land now he said what H has thou to do with me that thou had come against me to fight in my land yesterday you robbing people for their stuff today you talking about my land fighting me and here going himself brother CL he send his lawyers he send his Messengers he say let's try the Diplomatic way first because if it's War they want it's War they going to get but let's start the Diplomatic way [Applause] first anybody here with me this morning and the king of the children of Ammon so jeffa start the war on a dialogue level he leave Gilead yet he leave his seat he s down there and need to go to the king and tell him jeffa is here this is my land this is my territory my jurisdiction I'm leader and Captain as of this morning I've been appointed ask the king of Ammon under what Authority he come to challenge me this morning can the church say Amen verse 13 and the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of jeffa because Israel took away my land this is this is the king of ammon's response because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt from Anon even unto Jabbok and unto Jordan now therefore restor these lands again peaceably so the king of Ammon say well here this now just give us the land quietly we don't need to fight we don't need to fight about this I claiming This Is My Land you claim this is your land but I want to tell you I want to go back in history to identify that when Israel took my land they came out of Egypt from Anon even unto Jabbok and unto Jordan now therefore restore these lands again peacefully and this is why friends you have to know the word that applies to you Jesus under trial could say it is written it is written it is also written you have to know the legal right under which you can make claim for you and your family you know because this becomes a legal case remember the devil is the accuser is a living court case we are in every day you know the devil is the one accusing so you have to understand the law which is the written word to be able to counteract his arguments so when that come back with that now verse 14 and jeffa send Messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon and said unto him thus saith jeffa now there are so many types in this because this is not this is not D say the Lord D say Jeff and what this underscores is as bad man as jeffa was jeffa knew line by line the historical word of their standing all the banditry all the gang leader thing don't change you know much people like me to backslide and when I talk to them they say you know the Rapture coming and are watching them because the word lock up in them the word lock up in them they know the word know the word has been sewn in their heart they could be And when they see it they kind of get you know I coming back and I know that there's a great move to come and they said hit you the thing the thing lock up inside that way the word inside there they say the door to be before the door shut I'll be in there brother don't take chances get in there now don't just know the word and do anything about it better getting now before the horrible plague strike because jeffa didn't learn the history in the last 24 hours he had to have known it to craft this response you can't become a lawyer overnight even with ch GPT you cannot do it overnight so he can learn this so JEA is speaking from training and Revelation he say and and verse 14 and jeffa sent Messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon and S him thus say jeffa Israel took not away the land of Moab nor the land of the children of Amron but when Israel came up from Egypt and walked through the Wilderness unto the Red Sea and came to cadish you see how he he said to preach a message there for them and then Israel sent Messengers unto the king of Edom saying let me I pray the pass through thy land but the king of Edom would not hearken there too and in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab but he would not consent and Israel Abode in Kadesh we had to stay there because nobody wanted us to pass then they went along through the Wilderness and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came by the east side of the land of Moab in other words JEA have a map in his mind of the exact Journey that we took to be here this morning and pitch on the other side of anon but came not within the border of Moab for Anan was the border of Moab can we go on and Israel sent messages unto seon King of the amorites the king of heshbon and Israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee through thy land unto my place but seon trusted not Israel to pass through his Coast but seon start the thing gathered all his people together and pitched in Jes and fought against Israel we were asking for passage and they start a war anybody with me and the Lord God of Israel delivered seon and all his people into the hand of Israel we didn't deliver it the Lord himself got involved in the matter and delivered it and they smed them so Israel possessed all the land of the amorites and the inhabitant of that country and they possess all the coast of the amorites from Anon even unto Jabbok and from Wilderness even unto Jordan so now the Lord God of Israel has dispossessed the amorites from before his people Israel and should as thou possess it he challenging the king of Ammons saying the Lord is who give us this land and you want to dispossess this thing now if you don't know healing belongs to you to allow the devil to come and dispossess your land you don't know your children belong to you and you want allow the devil to dispossess your land you don't know Joy belongs to you and allow the devil to dispossess your land you know the Holy Ghost belongs to you and you allow the devil to dispos adoption is mine healing is mine perfection is mine s of Revival is mine perfect Church super [Applause] Church Give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise listen to verse 24 jeffa saying will thou not possess that which chus thy God give thee to possess je just baton it he say if you're God gave some you would fight f it if you're your God gave some you would hold on it so how you Vex with me this morning first my God give me if your God give you something you would fight for it so I am in my right this morning to fight for what God give me don't get vexed with me this morning for fighting for what my God give me don't get vexed this morning if by faith I claim my daughter claim my son claim my family claim the backslider that God he gave me I didn't give myself he gave me I'm in my right because God gave me to claim it to walk upon it he told me every place I put my foot is blind can the church say Amen is this helping anybody this [Applause] morning bear in mind this is the bad man still in the Diplomatic real will thou not possess will not thou possess verse 24 that which chamers thy God giveth thee to possess so whomsoever the Lord Our God shall drive out from before us them will we possess and now art thou anything better than baac you see how much jeffa the backslider know how much jeffa the gangster know he man quoting down to baac he done not not just history he going down to Doctrine and now are thou anything better than baac the son of zior King of Moab did he ever strive against Israel or did he ever fight against them in other words he said he and all try and look what happened to him is jeffa talking to you here this morning don't mess with us we have history we know who we are we know who our God is it was God of our fathers who delivered the land into our hand you're picking the wrong fight here today because it's not just Jeff fighting I fighting with the history and the knowledge that God is in charge not only that in judges 10 we read it all these strange Gods already put away so we unsp in terms with God can the church say Amen all right will Israel verse 26 while Israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in Aurora and her towns and all the cities and that be by the course of anon 300 years he see this is so powerful why therefore did you not recover them within that time in other words my Lord you know in Lord called a statute of limitation after a certain time you can't come back with no case he say I had 300 years since we left Egypt it's 300 years already gone since they left Egypt you see had 300 years to do with this thing your statute of limitation over if you wanted to beef about this thing you should have dealt with it a long time ago it too late for you to even apply in the court for mercy in this matter because we are now statute bad you have no case here this morning you say 300 years why de did you not recover them within that time so we see jeffa is a leader he's a diplomat he's a negotiator he understand arbitration he's a spiritual man he understand spiritual history he is on the word he also understand law he know statute of limitation he said if you wanted to even bring a case you should have bring the case a long time ago but 300 years already gone too much time already passed and I reach here now I am here now can the church say Amen wherefore this is the conclusion of the legal matter I have not sinned against thee but thou doest wrong to war against me the Lord the judge here's a judge talking about the judge the Lord the judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon verse 28 how be it the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the word of jeffa which he sent them now I love verse 29 verse 29 said then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jeffa so after the word go on forth now brother Stephen now now we see a shift a further shift an acceleration of the shift something now an anointing now come upon jeffa he was a bad man before he was on the word before but the anointing could only anoint something so now all the the foundation has been laid the word has been declared the message has G forth there there's nothing to hold it back now now the spirit of the Lord come upon Jeff you mean to tell me that God can't send the Holy Spirit upon somebody who messed up made mistakes and just find their way back into the house of God oh my [Applause] woo what a joy could you imagine the feeling that Came Upon jeffa he had gone to many battle before but now he feel something different he feel a quickening he feel an unction he feel a something different he never felt this way before he had done everything in his flesh before but now the spirit of the Lord is upon Jeff the the anointing is upon jeffa the Lord has confirmed that he is with JEA the Lord is present with jeffa woo Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Glory Hall Spirit of your Lord come upon jeffa friends what a way to feel to know that the spirit of the Lord is upon you in other words the holy spirit is pleased with the way it has flowed thus far can I amen if there any thing you want to ever feel or experience it's the spirit of the Lord coming upon youj when you need to know what to do when you need to know how to live when you need to know the next move jeffa was going a certain way all of a sudden something changed in the atmosphere the prophet would be there speaking he say you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting for the angel of the Lord and then the spirit of the Lord would be there verse 29 then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh and passed over mispa and from misah of Gilead he passed on over unto the children of Ammon now this is where I want to get to where this takes a interesting turn I'll see that has caught many a theologian of God and within this passage of scripture what we're going to go into next I'm not going to be too much longer but I want to bring this home to us about what drives jeffa into Hebrews 11 because I made a point that everyone in Hebrews 11 had something in their past in their story that should disqualify them but God overlooked it and placed them there The Heroes of Faith he said by faith verse 30 and jeffa vowed a vow unto the [Music] Lord and said if Thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon shall surely be the Lord's and I will offer it up for a burn offering he made a a big statement and I want to qualify this a little bit in a short while from a quote from the prophet so let's go on so jeffa verse 32 passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them and the Lord delivered them into his hands and he smoted them from Aurora even till Thou come to men even 20 cities and unto the plain of The Vineyards with a very great Slaughter thus the children of Ammon was subdued before the children of Israel so we read in Hebrews 11 subdued kingdoms so this is this is if you read Hebrews 11 the subdued kingdoms and all those things were the descriptions of the acts of the names that were called and jeffa came to misper unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him am with Tims and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou Hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord and I cannot go back and she said unto him my father if thou has opened thy mouth unto the Lord do to me according to that which had proceeded out of thy mouth for as much as the Lord had taken Vengeance for thee of enemies even of the children of Ammon so I want to pause there for a minute there's a quote from Brother brandom Where he made a statement in at Thy word Lord and he say I notice he called him a king had made a rash vow one time and he vowed that he'd sacrificed the first thing that come from his house and there's a lot of debate it about that vow that jeffa made and we'll read How It Ends and what God leaves without saying it but there are things I want to capture in this that should make us pause to reflect because I want you to listen to the words of jeffa very carefully and the response of his daughter and I want to bring two additional scriptures to bear on this verse 34 again and jeffa came to misper unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him and you know what he said he said whatever is the first thing that come out will be a sacrifice now when I read this I have one daughter but George I read this and I had to put on the book a little while but this is heavy because his motive was a noble motive he want to destroy the ammonites so up until this point because we could say that his past was the past we could see the transition from Outlaw to judge but now as a judge he makes what is called a rash vow a vow that if you look at brother Brandon describing it as rash vow it makes you wonder if he did the right thing at that moment and it raises the question to us do we make statements or promises to God and how do we view these commitments and these promises to God and how does God view it because one thing we see about jeffa is the honor of the man that he makes a vow brother popwell that even though it's a rash vow there's something in him that's compelling him to be a man of his word now this becomes deep because there are scriptures that raise this to the Consciousness and when we see that the spoken word is the Original Seed and in in Hebrews we read that the world was framed by the word of God it means we have to be very measured with the words we use because life and death is in the power of the tongue and we cannot just string words together into sentences and not understand that these sentences have consequences I want to make sure this sticks but I want to to underscore not just Jeff's belief in the matter but the training of the daughter because she herself understood the importance of whatever you say to God being something that's critical could he take some more so jeffa came to mispah unto his house and to behold and behold his daughter came out to meet him I can imagine I know how my daughter gets when I get home I don't know what Jeff was thinking was going to come out the house I can't I can't I can't explain it don't I can't explain it he said whatever come at the house so maybe he just feeling so inspired sometime people get anointed and say the wrong thing he feels so inspired he said Lord if you let me win this battle whatever come to the house i' sacrifice he make a pledge a v commitment without even thinking anything through and here he reached home and the daughter excited to see him as any daughter would be because you don't be father coming back alive dead is a war he went to fight he didn't go by H Massi he didn't go by the grocery and when you hear this song is Daddy there is Daddy there yes daddy there daddy there and the moment Jeff sees us and say you have brought me low amen because I made a statement to God I made a statement to God and I cannot go back on my word I want us to be very careful because whenever you make a statement to God you cannot go back Amen on your word this is not making a statement to your brother to your sister this is you making a vow to God this lifts up this morning the vow of marriage yes anybody with me this morning is a vow before God this goes beyond this is adultery this is jeffa is about to contemplate what happens with his only child because of how much he values his vow to God and when he tells his daughter girl I told God that whatever come of the house I'm going to set sacrifices she said well if you said that to God you have to honor [Applause] it let's go to Psalms 15 verse 1 I'm not going to be too much longer Psalms 15:1 Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill he that walth uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor take it up a reproach against his neighbor in whose eyes a vile person is condemned but he that honored them that fear the lord and listen to this verse that the psalmist David picks up here he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not and I want to now go to the Amplified oh Lord who may Lodge as guest in your tent who may dwell continually on your Holy Hill he walks with integrity and strength of character and works righteousness and speaks and holds truth in his heart he does not slander with his tongue nor does evil to his neighbor nor takes up a reproach against his friend in his eyes an evil person is despise but he honors those who fear the lord and obediently worship him with all inspired reverence and submissive wonder he keeps his word even to his own disadvantage and does not change it for his own benefit so in other words the psalmist David is saying be very careful with your words because God values honor anybody with me this morning this lifts a critical point to how God wants us to keep our word keep our commitment keep our commitment to one another and more importantly keep it to him last scripture before we bring a close to this message this morning and these are the lessons of jeffa the Journey of jeffa right let's go to Ecclesiastes 5 Ecclesiastes 5 and verse one keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be Hasty to utter anything before God for God is in heaven and thou upon the Earth therefore let thy Words Be Few for a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a Fool's voice is known by multitude of words and when thou vest a vow unto God defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou Hast has vowed now you can see ananas and ZF here now because they made a vow they made a commitment suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an error all you all you hearing this is the Bible reading morning well Lord already was making a mistake when I say I was giving up the world this week this now ties back to judges 10 with true repentance because you're saying with your mouth you repent and God saying but I'm not seeing the repentance you made a vow that you're turning away from the world where is the evidence of you keeping the vow I will I want to read these two things again and because some of us are seen you looking at me like you never look at these scriptures in this way before because we build up true jeffa to see the manly transformation and then to see how he makes a vow that brings them to a crisis because he recognize maybe he said something he should not have said then we read in Scripture that even if it's to your own hurt you lose out on the deal you make a bad decision and you say you're going to do something and you have to keep your word because you have to honor your word well I didn't make a mistake and that why I keep my word that is not Christian I didn't really mean to say it so so really I really mean no you made a vow let's just close it out suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the Angel and the angel here translates even to priest or Minister and and again I'm bringing this up now because bovid was speaking last week about the Temple of the Lord and fleeing fornication and and adultery and these things so when you stand in front the altar with a marriage vow it's a vow to God and before the priest which here is Angel this lifts vows commitments the marriage vow the Covenant you as a Believer you vow to God when you get baptized it's a vow you're taken it's not just words will I repent I get baptized a simple thing I I come in a church I want to be a Christian what does that really mean when you make these declaration I accept you as my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I accept the fact that I'm now transformed saved and I'm and and you begin to make certain declarations to God and then you do as if you talk Amen in the old days before laws were written and agreements were signed it was word of mouth and a handshake agreement because men kept their words the reason you need people now because man are keeping the word that's right I did for get what it really say and I was an error and I well will P sign here you know anybody with me this morning let's close it out suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an error wherefore should God be angry at thy voice and destroy the works of thine hand so let's let's bring this to conclusion back to judges and she said unto him this is the daughter speaking my father now when you look at the deeper translation of that sacrifice the original writing sorts of have a double meaning so this is one of the reason theologians have weighed what we know for sure and we'll get into it and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that I may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity I and my fellows and he said go and he sent away her away for two months and she went with her Companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in Israel that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jeffa the gileadite 4 days in a year we see a repeated theme here where it says in verse 37 let me alone two months that I may go and bewail my virginity it says it in verse 38 and she went with her companions to be whale of virginity and it goes on to say and it was that she uh did with her according to her vow which she had vow which he knew no man so from the scripture what we are seeing here is that a sacrifice was made the scripture doesn't say clearly what the final outcome was if she was actually offered up or some would argue that she gave her life to serving the lord and she never got married and the sacrifice that jeffa made was his lineage was cut because he his one child never got married and the sacrifice he made was basically cutting his lineage the Bible doesn't expressly say if he was offered up physically what we do know for sure is that she never got married what it does show is the Bible says that jeffa kept his vow and Jeff was committed to The Vow and the critical lesson I want us to take away this morning from this scripture it's to look back very carefully on vows that you have made and as we approach this time of repentance and grace and mercy before judgment be very careful because now you are drawn to the scriptures that speak very clearly to the importance of the words you speak and what it means not just in the spiritual realm but in the natural realm but more so in in Ecclesiastes going I want to read these two scriptures as the musician get ready to come to read the scriptures one more time so you look at the gravity of the situation because if you could you could attribute to each of the judges what is the significant thing about them that pushed them into Hebrews 11 it is one thing to win a war it is one thing to be transformed from an outlaw to a judge but the cross that jeffa had to bear was this vow that he made that brother BR call a rash vow maybe an impulsive vow maybe a vow under excitement because he want the Lord and the thing is the Lord honored the statement because the Lord allowed Victory and Jeff still had to honor Lord I made a vow to you you know to live holy yeah this is The Vow we making right Lord I make a vow to you I I want to be a Christian I want to live a righteous life I want to cut out the world I want to and I'm vowing that as a sister I'm not going to cut my hair that that's a vow oh yes you vow to dress like a Christian that is a vow is a commitment when you accept this journey you want to be a real Christian how you can make a vow to dress like a Christian and then when you're not dressing what do you how do you want God to receive you at that point amen this goes beyond rules and stuff now because this is now you and God because Jeff saying I made a vow before God and I really can't come back on my vow and I love the daughter recognizing but if you commit to the Lord to do something you have to honor it bring back the Y is y and the N is n bring back if I'm saying Lord I'm going to serve you and not serve the ASAT not serve the gods of Canaan not serve the god of I'm serving you then why you trying to go back in the world I'm not saying that you're not going to have struggles I'm not saying you're not going to have ups and downs but you made a vow unto the Lord Lord I am going to serve you you are my God that's a vow you are my king Lord I'm making a promise to you it it it reframes things whether you feel anointed or don't feel anointed you living by a v it's same with marriage if you feeling on Cloud 9 all the time that is a whole different thing but I have yet to find a cou who on cloud n all the time there a reason you take a vow anybody in the house this morning and when the emotion is not there The Vow is supposed to stand and we say in in marriage vow The Vow is before God and man is like two signatures on the contract this changes the conversation about adultery just a sin this is now elevates it to back to spoken word you made a vow nobody forced you you came to the altar and said For Better or Worse for richer or poorer in sickness and in health I'm standing by you this has nothing to do with anybody else just at that point is you making a vow before God and man whether your partner keeps her part his part is irrelevant your vow is before God and man am I in the is there anybody in the house this morning The Vow goes above the emotion because here it is Jeff saying you have brought me very low this thing driving me to depression I cannot believe that the outcome of my statement would have turned out this way I made a vow and look how it has played out this is not what I envisioned but I made a vow to God and I have to be prepared to deal with the consequence of My Vow before God am I in the house this morning is anybody here with me this [Applause] morning maybe Jeff's Journey but Joe of being a bad boy because in the Underworld you are keeping where to get killer now you say you're going to deliver the thing by so and so place and thing there they say well is you and your family gone or just a simple thing so the respect for vows and commitment is different we playing games in the natural realm here but in the criminal Enterprise your word is all have you no criminal signing agreement there's a contract between this gang and that gang and they are written no there's the tur there's a Turf you deliver you deliver you pay you pay yeah pay tomorrow you're dead this simple so maybe Jeff's Journey had him very sensitive to I have made vows with my gang gang gang men but here I just made a vow before God this has to be the most important vow I've ever made if I didn't play with my natural vows how could I even try to play with My Vow before God you see I've made a vow before God and I cannot take it back because when I tell somebody I'm going to do something I'm going to do it and if I say I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it and somehow that daughter was trained enough to say well Daddy this is this is what we believe you make a vow before God and prepare to deal with the consequence whether the consequence is is sacrifice whether the consequences I don't get married and I have to live in the temple for my whole life because I see whatever this whatever you have to do do once we don't break devour I pray this helps somebody in here who has been on the edge and your thinking about the world thinking about this but wait a minute if you when I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided it's a decision to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back the cross before me the World Behind me the cross be is not just a song It's a commitment it's a vow and it has nothing to do with your feeling it has nothing to do with what happens it has nothing to do with what plays out in your life you say Lord I don't have nothing but Lord I made a vow God help me help me but I have I can't go back on My Vow amen is this a reality to anybody this morning this is a renewal service it's a reflection service Lord I'm making a vow I've made vows making vows you'll always make vows but Lord I V to serve you what's the point of coming to church and know to serve God what's it purpose to come the service and you you don't want to commit because it's a commitment God says I keep my promises we say he's a God that doesn't fail he's a God that keeps his word then what is what is our part of this equation that says but Lord as a sister I vow to keep my chastity it's a vow this woman kept her vow she bewailed her virginity maybe she thought of having children one day talked about getting married one day whatever it was it was cut off because of her vow that said listen young lady you have to sacrifice your life to the Lord cuz I made a statement that I intend to live to God this is not about pleasing anybody now it's about pleasing God I want to Circle this home to everybody this morning that as you leave this service you recalibrate the importance of your words whether you maintain your family let me maintain Christ but the B was taking a vow money or money friend or no friend in season out of season all this is vows but feeling no fire if you know you made a vow for 5 years but abam preached without the anointing because he was standing on his vow standing on his commitment baptism is a vow consecration is a vow communion is a vow these are all different commitments along your journey this is not to condemn you this is for you to reframe and say Lord maybe I wasn't keeping it as I should but Lord From This Day Forward and be careful in saying this but from this day forward Lord I'm going to make a different approach and make a different effort toward serving you you can be to play something softly I just want to read these two verses one more time and then brother Anthony will come from Psalms 15 ver1 Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle who shall dwell in thy Holy Hill he that walth uprightly and worketh righteousness speak the truth in his heart not truth with just your mouth but truth in your heart he that back back bite it not with his tongue nor do it evil to his neighbor nor take it up a reproach against his neighbor in whose eyes a vile persons condemned but he honored them that fear the lord he that swear it to his own hurt and change it not and at last statement is the one I want to hone into you make a commitment a vow maybe it end up to your hurt maybe you end up into problems maybe you end up into challenges but you can't change the vow that was made you have to live with the vow you have to live with the commitment you have to live with the dedication because God is the one who's marking the score not your family not your neighbor not a preacher not a pastor not anybody else God is the one marking The Vow so if you have not been living to your vow your commitment to the Lord the commitment to your wife the commitment even to your family because when you have a child you're making a vow to raise that child in the fear of the Lord are we in the house this morning last verse Ecclesiastes 5 verse 1-6 keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God in other words be careful I'm going to read in the amplifi I didn't read it the last time and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be Hasty to utter anything before God for God is in heaven and and thou upon Earth therefore let thy Words Be Few let your words be measured let your word be very calculated for a dream cometh through a multitude of business and a Fool's voice is known by multitude of words when thou vest a vow unto God defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou Hast vowed better it is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay in other words if you want to be a Christian be a real Christian it's better you don't choose to walk just and try to walk it and don't keep up to the walk this brings a level of soberness to everyone in the house this morning suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an error wherefor should God be angry thy voice and destroy the work of thine hand let me just read that in the Amplified and we close out Hallelujah guard your steps and focus on what you're are doing as you go to the house of God you you hear that the solemnness the sacredness not the Casual while I going up to church guard your step and focus on what you are doing as you go to the house of God this is the same Ecclesiastes 5 reading from the Amplified and draw near to listen rather than to offer the careless or irreverent sacrifice of fools for they are too ignorant to know they are doing evil do not be Hasty with your mouth speaking careless words or vows or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter before God for God is in heaven and you are on earth therefore let your Words Be Few for the dream comes through much effort and the voice of the fool through many words when you make a vow or pledge to God do not put off paying it for God takes no pleasure in fools who thoughtlessly mock him pay what you vow it is better that you should not vow than you should vow and not pay do not allow your speech to cause you to sin and do not say before the mess messenger priest in the King James says Angel before the messenger of priest of God that it was a mistake why should God be angry because of your voice words and destroy the work of your hands may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word this morning let's stand to our feet hallu from an outlaw to a judge jeffa was more than a mighty man of Allah in the physical sense he was a mighty man of Valor in that he was a man who kept his vow that's the deeper message that jeffa was a big man he was a man that kept his word he kept his vow I pray to God today that we leave this service as believers who make up our minds Lord I want to keep my vow that's why that song with the Anthony S at the beginning Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart is a is a real song We ought to PA and reflect because a Christian in your heart means Lord I want to live right I want to say the right thing I don't want to say the wrong thing I don't want to move rash as brother bam said it was a rash vow maybe it was impulsive we don't know because there's a lot we can't understand we don't understand how Samson made M he made and I don't know how Som how you or I make the miss that we made but it's Grace and blood and mercy for us all but all of scripture is for correction it's for edification is for reproof is for guidance and the word is there telling us be more careful God told the prophet be more sincere if you be more sincere you'll have the power to bind him member so we want a deeper sincerity a different sacredness may the Lord Richie bless you [Applause] [Music] today oh let's give him praise this morning let's lift our hands and just worship him all over Oh Glory
