[33:26] into your hands in the precious name of
[33:28] Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[33:30] "Amen." And amen and amen.
[33:37] Amen. Listen that song. What a mighty
[33:39] God we
[33:42] serve. Oh, what a mighty God we

[35:58] life.

[36:04] do? Oh, how he loves
[36:10] you.
[36:12] How he loves me.

[36:23] lifted, let's just sing it back to him.
[36:27] Oh, how he loves you and
[36:36] me. Oh,
[36:39] how he loves you and me.
[36:48] He
[36:49] gave his
[36:52] life. What more can he
[36:58] do? Oh,
[37:00] how he loves
[37:03] you. Oh,
[37:05] how he loves me.
[37:10] Oh, how he loves you and
[37:17] me. Oh, singing. Oh, how he loves
[37:24] you and
[37:27] me.
[37:30] Oh, oh, how he loves you and me.
[37:42] He gives his
[37:45] life. What more
[37:55] [Music]
[37:56] [Applause]
[37:59] can he loves
[38:02] me? Oh, how he loves you.
[38:09] [Music]
[38:17] Bless the
[38:19] Lord. Thank you
[38:22] Jesus.
[38:25] Hallelujah. Thank you Lamb of God.
[38:28] Hallelujah.
[38:38] [Music]
[38:44] [Music]
[38:53] He loves
[38:55] me. Oh,
[38:57] how he loves
[39:00] you and me. Just sing it one more time.
[39:04] Oh, how he loves you and
[39:06] me. Oh,
[39:08] how he loves you.
[39:13] [Music]
[39:24] He gave his
[39:31] life one more.
[39:38] [Music]
[39:56] Oh Lord, give the Lord some praises
[39:57] right
[39:58] now. Hallelujah.
[40:03] [Music]
[40:09] [Music]
[40:22] [Music]
[40:30] [Music]
[40:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[40:41] [Music]
[40:43] Thank you Lord
[40:46] Jesus. Let us bow our heads forward a
[40:50] prayer. Heavenly Father, we could truly
[40:52] say what manner of love is this that you
[40:55] could love us that we could be called
[40:56] the sons of God in this last hour. But
[40:58] we thank you for your blood shed in that
[41:00] blood Calvary that given us this divine
[41:04] opportunity to be surrendered to you to
[41:07] be connected to the vine as a branch
[41:09] that we could bring forth fruit and as
[41:12] we make the tree good the fruit becomes
[41:15] good. Make the fruit good. Father come
[41:17] Lord as charity this morning and pour
[41:20] out your love among your people. Speak
[41:21] to our hearts. stir our spirits and
[41:24] souls, Lord, in the spirit of the coming
[41:26] of the Lord, that we can be prepared for
[41:28] your coming, Father, because this is
[41:30] what service is all about. This is what
[41:32] church is all about, for your advent,
[41:34] for your coming, Father. Prepare our
[41:36] hearts this morning and speak to us by
[41:38] your word and confirm your word with
[41:39] signs, wonders, and miracles. We ask in
[41:41] Jesus name. Before I have your seats,
[41:43] why don't you turn around and greet
[41:44] somebody in Jesus name.
[41:48] [Music]
[41:57] M. Oh, I love
[42:01] you and
[42:07] me. He gave his
[42:11] life. What more
[42:14] can Jesus give?
[42:18] Oh, how he
[42:21] loves you and
[42:24] know how he loves
[42:28] me. Oh, how he loves you and
[42:34] me. If you have your Bibles, I'd like
[42:36] you to turn to Leviticus chapter 23. We
[42:39] want to look at St. John chapter 7 and
[42:41] Matthew chapter 5. God bless you and
[42:44] welcome. Greetings in the name of Jesus.
[42:47] It's good to be here and we greet all
[42:50] those connected to us on the internet.
[42:53] May God bless you this
[42:56] morning. Want to read from Leviticus
[43:01] 23:33-36. It's in John
[43:03] 7:37 and 38 and Matthew 5 verse 6. Happy
[43:07] Father's Day to all the fathers in our
[43:10] midst.
[43:15] Leviticus 23 we
[43:25] read. And the Lord spake unto Moses,
[43:28] saying, Speak unto the children of
[43:30] Israel, saying, The 15th day of the
[43:33] seventh month shall be the feast of
[43:35] tabernacles for seven days unto the
[43:38] Lord. On the first day shall be a holy
[43:40] convocation. You shall do no survi work
[43:44] therein. Seven days you shall offer an
[43:47] offering made by fire unto the Lord. On
[43:50] the eighth day shall be a holy
[43:53] convocation unto you. You shall offer an
[43:57] offering made by fire unto the Lord. It
[44:00] is a solemn assembly and he shall do no
[44:04] survile work therein. and St. John
[44:07] chapter
[44:16] 7. Read in verse 37 and 38. In the last
[44:21] day, that great day of the feast, Jesus
[44:25] stood and cried, saying, If any man
[44:28] thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
[44:31] Amen. He that believeth on me, as the
[44:34] scripture had said, out of his belly
[44:36] shall flow rivers of living water. And
[44:40] Matthew chapter 5, 1 verse verse
[44:44] 6, blessed the day which do hunger and
[44:47] thirst after righteousness, for they
[44:49] shall be filled. May God bless his word.
[44:52] You may be seated. As you sit down
[44:54] there, just give God some praises and
[44:55] some worship.
[45:01] Glory.
[45:02] [Applause]
[45:04] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. Thank
[45:08] you, Jesus.
[45:10] Our title this
[45:11] morning, the 8th day holy convocation.
[45:15] Amen. It's actually the theme of our
[45:17] upcoming international convention, the
[45:19] 8th day holy convent convocation. And I
[45:22] have an inspiration
[45:24] uh if any man thirst come. Hallelujah.
[45:29] Amen. If any man to come. Wonderful. If
[45:31] you have your Bibles with you, I want
[45:32] you to turn your Bibles to 2 Corinthians
[45:34] chapter
[45:35] 11. And
[45:38] let's read something there before we get
[45:40] into the message. I had this I wanted to
[45:43] share with
[45:55] you. Right. So keep your Bible close to
[46:00] you. 2 Corinthians chapter 11, we want
[46:04] to read from verse
[46:09] 22. And this is Paul and Paul giving
[46:13] testimony here. So this is for all the
[46:15] people. This is to help the whiners, the
[46:18] complainers, the people who think that
[46:21] it's too tough. This is Paul. Are they
[46:24] Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites?
[46:27] So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham?
[46:31] So am I. Are they ministers of Christ? I
[46:33] speak as a fool. I am more. In labors,
[46:36] more abundant in stripes above measure.
[46:40] In prison, more frequent in debts
[46:45] oft receive I. 40 stripes save one. I
[46:49] heard it talk like that. Sister
[46:51] 39. 40 stripes save one. Thrice I was
[46:55] beaten with rods. Once was I stoned.
[46:59] Twice I suffered shipwreck. A night and
[47:01] a day I have been in the deep. In
[47:04] journeyings often in perils of water. In
[47:08] perils of robbers. In perils of my own
[47:11] countrymen. In perils by the heen. In
[47:14] perils in the city, in perils in the
[47:17] wilderness, in perils in the sea, in
[47:19] perils among false brethren, in
[47:22] weariness and painfulness, in watchings,
[47:25] often in hunger and thirst, in fastings,
[47:29] often in cold, in nakedness, besides
[47:33] those things that are without, that
[47:35] which cometh upon me daily, the care of
[47:37] all the churches, who is weak, and I am
[47:40] not weak, who is offended, and I burn
[47:42] not. And if I must needs glory, I will
[47:44] glory of the things which concern my
[47:47] infirmities. The God and father of our
[47:49] Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
[47:51] forever more, know it that I lie not. In
[47:55] Damascus, the governor under Aritus the
[47:57] king kept the city of Damascus with a
[48:00] garrison desirous to apprehend me. And
[48:02] through a window in a basket was I let
[48:05] down by the wall and escape his hands.
[48:07] May God bless his word. Keep reading
[48:10] your Bible. There are many mysteries
[48:11] inside of there. This is the mystery of
[48:13] guts and and amen and and having that
[48:16] belly to take a clear stand and
[48:18] everything don't have to work out as
[48:19] smooth as you want it to work out as you
[48:21] expect it to be. Be rugged Christians.
[48:24] Be rugged sons of God. Paul had stripes.
[48:27] He had prison. He had all kind of stuff
[48:29] and he still served the Lord. He still
[48:31] remained a servant of God. He still
[48:33] remained a Christian. He didn't give up.
[48:36] He didn't let go. He didn't back down.
[48:38] The devil couldn't move him. If he can
[48:40] hear from God, the devil can move him.
[48:42] May that be your stand, my brother. May
[48:44] that be my your stand, my sister. Amen.
[48:47] Oh, praise God. Satan hates revelation.
[48:50] He doesn't like it because he it upsets
[48:53] his plans. Hallelujah. Satan hates
[48:57] revelation. And the prophet said, "Let
[48:59] me show you another reason why Satan
[49:02] hate this book of the revelation of
[49:03] Jesus Christ." He knows that Jesus
[49:06] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[49:07] forever. He changes not. He knows that a
[49:11] whole lot more than do 90% of the
[49:13] theologians. He knows that since God is
[49:15] immutable in his nature, which is
[49:17] unchangeable in his nature, he's also
[49:20] immutable in his ways. Thus, Satan knows
[49:22] assuredly, here we go, that the original
[49:25] church at Pentecost with the power of
[49:28] God. Mark 16 in action is the true
[49:31] church. Yes, sir. That Jesus claim as
[49:34] his own. All else is false. It has to
[49:37] be. Now remember
[49:39] this. Christ in the true church is a
[49:43] continuation of the book of Acts. Amen.
[49:46] Amen. Amen. It's a continuation of the
[49:49] book of Acts. And the book of Acts is
[49:51] the acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[49:53] church. And there's a prophecy. It will
[49:56] return. Yes, sir. So Christ in the true
[49:58] church is a continuation of the book of
[50:00] Acts. So what you ought to be looking
[50:02] for is a continuation of the book of
[50:04] Acts. Remember the inspiration of the
[50:06] Holy Spirit, him moving in and out. Who
[50:09] is he? Christ in the church. That's your
[50:12] promise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:15] Now remember, the book of Revelation
[50:17] shows that the Antichrist spirit would
[50:21] come into the church and defile it,
[50:23] making it lukewarm, formal, and
[50:26] powerless.
[50:28] Hallelujah. That's the defiling. They're
[50:32] not crushing the church, you know. The
[50:33] object is to make the church lukewarm,
[50:36] formal, and powerless. All the church
[50:39] must have is a form and say their name
[50:41] message. Hallelujah. But you have to
[50:44] fight that. Hallelujah. Because that's
[50:46] not the true church. The true church
[50:48] will be on fire. Hallelujah. The church
[50:50] is not formal. The church truth will be
[50:52] on fire for God. Isn't that right? Isn't
[50:55] that right? Watch. It exposes Satan,
[50:58] revealing his works, attempted
[51:00] destruction of God's people, right to
[51:02] the time he's cast in a lake of fire. He
[51:05] fights that. He cannot stand that. Here
[51:07] we go. He knows, this devil knows this.
[51:10] I want you to hear it plain and clear.
[51:12] The devil knows that if the people get a
[51:17] true revelation of the true church and
[51:20] what she is, what she stand for, she can
[51:24] do. to greater works. We're not talking
[51:28] about talk now. We talking about what
[51:30] you can do by revelation by you getting
[51:33] a revelation of what the true church is.
[51:37] The true church is not a form. Oh, glory
[51:40] to God. Jesus said, "Upon this rock,
[51:43] I'll build my church."
[51:47] That's why revelation will make you
[51:49] stand on the ship. Whether you
[51:51] shipwreck, whether the boat break up,
[51:53] whether to put you in prison, the
[51:55] revelation going to stand because upon
[51:57] this rock I will build my church and the
[52:00] gates of hell cannot prevail.
[52:02] [Applause]
[52:04] Not new doctrine. You can get new
[52:06] doctrine every week. You will still
[52:08] crumble. But when you have revelation,
[52:10] nothing could move you. You are anchored
[52:13] because it's flesh and blood. It reveal
[52:15] it to you and it gives you prevailing
[52:17] power. Oh, give the Lord a shout. That's
[52:20] why so many people get thrown off the
[52:22] gospel
[52:24] cuz they lack revelation. They join
[52:27] church, they believe the message, they
[52:28] believe the word, they believe the
[52:30] Bible, but have no revelation. God never
[52:32] spoke to them.
[52:35] Hallelujah. If the people get the true
[52:38] revelation of the true church, what she
[52:40] is and what she stands for, she can do
[52:42] the greater works. She will be an
[52:44] invincible army. If here we go that's a
[52:48] further a sub sub behind that. Now if
[52:51] they get a true revelation of the two
[52:54] spirits within the framework of the
[52:57] Christian church listen the spirit on
[53:00] outside it working on the inside. Two
[53:03] spirits. Hallelujah. Working in the
[53:05] framework of the Christian church. And
[53:07] you battling with them two spirits. That
[53:09] that's one spirit making you cold and
[53:11] lukewarm. One spirit don't want you to
[53:13] come to church. Don't want you to praise
[53:14] God. Don't want you to appreciate that
[53:16] God sent some through the waters, some
[53:18] through the flood, some through the
[53:19] trials, all through the
[53:23] blood. Them two spirits working upon
[53:26] your life. Make you only want to praise
[53:28] God when things working nice. When you
[53:29] get this, when you get that, but praise
[53:32] God. But the Romans 8:28 says, "All
[53:35] things work together for good to them
[53:38] that love God to them who are the called
[53:41] according to your purpose." When I'm
[53:43] sick, that will work for good. When I
[53:45] lose my job, that will work for good.
[53:47] Whe this happen, that happen, forget
[53:49] that.
[53:53] Hallelujah.
[53:55] If they get a true relationship spirit
[53:57] working within the frame of the church
[53:59] and and listen and by God spirit discern
[54:05] and withstand the antichrist spirit. Not
[54:08] only discern it, you know, but withstand
[54:09] it. challenge it, test it, rebuke it,
[54:13] fight it, battle it, discern and
[54:15] withstand it. That's why B say all them
[54:17] devils don't want to get exposed. They
[54:18] want to hide religious spirits, enticing
[54:20] spirits, evil spirits. Oh, blessed be
[54:23] the name of the Lord. Praise God. So
[54:26] watch say so, so watch. Withstand the
[54:28] antichrist spirit. Satan will be
[54:30] powerless before her. He will definitely
[54:32] be towed today as when Christ withtood
[54:34] his every effort. Satan hates
[54:36] revelation, but we love it. We're true.
[54:38] Listen, with true revelation in our
[54:42] lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail
[54:46] against us, but we will prevail over
[54:50] them. So the question is, do you have
[54:53] true revelation in your life? Because
[54:56] the evidence of true revelation in your
[54:59] life, you will be able to prevail
[55:01] against the gates of hell, not hell
[55:04] prevailing against you. So if you don't
[55:07] have revelation, get in the spirit
[55:10] because revelation is going to come your
[55:12] way. Oh, give the Lord praises people.
[55:16] That's why you ought to be worshiping.
[55:18] That's why you ought to be worshiping.
[55:19] This is not taking notes and writing
[55:21] down and you in the flesh. This is not
[55:23] Jehovah Witness Kingdom Hall. No, this
[55:25] is the kingdom of God that's being
[55:28] preached and every man press their way
[55:30] into it. Could we get a shout in the
[55:32] house? That's why when they come here,
[55:34] you come to sing. Regardless of how you
[55:37] feel, they come here to worship.
[55:39] Regardless of what the devil tell you
[55:40] last night, you raise your hands. You
[55:43] give God praise because you want to be
[55:45] in your spirit per adventure. Revelation
[55:48] drop down upon your very
[55:54] soul.
[55:56] Hallelujah. Oh,
[55:58] glory. I don't care how much knowledge
[56:00] you have. You could be, you could speak
[56:02] a whole encyclopedia, you still need
[56:03] revelation. You could know the Bible in
[56:06] the Greek and the Latin. You still need
[56:07] revelation. Revelation is what called a
[56:10] fisherman who can read or write to be an
[56:13] apostle to the church. Oh, give the Lord
[56:16] a shout in the
[56:17] house. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God.
[56:24] You may be seated. Getting revelation is
[56:26] is better than getting a degree. It's
[56:29] better than getting a doctorate.
[56:32] Revelation is the greatest thing there
[56:33] is. When that boy had five loaves and
[56:35] two fishes, Jesus by revelation, which
[56:38] is by faith, took five loaves and two
[56:40] fishes and didn't ask for more flour and
[56:43] water and and go and fish,
[56:46] he just bless it and said, "Break it
[56:48] because my revelation
[56:49] [Applause]
[56:55] Jesus put a multiplying anointing on the
[56:57] fish and the bread.
[56:58] You couldn't see it, but once they break
[57:00] it, it have to break. It have to break.
[57:01] It have to grow back. The bread growing
[57:02] back, the fish growing back. The bread
[57:04] growing back, the fish growing back. The
[57:05] bread is a multiplying anointing. You
[57:07] think God can put a multiplying
[57:08] anointing upon your life? Come on now.
[57:11] The more you give, the more you get, the
[57:12] more you give, the more you get, the
[57:13] more you break. Oh, give the Lord some
[57:15] praises, people. Praise God. Our God,
[57:18] not easy. Come on. He's an awesome God.
[57:21] Give the Lord a shout. Oh, he is worthy
[57:24] this morning.
[57:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[57:30] Glory. Divine revelation.
[57:33] My Lord. So Jesus was speaking a lot of
[57:36] stuff in parables. Amen. And the
[57:38] disciples, why you talking like that?
[57:40] And Jesus said, he said, because it's
[57:42] given to you to know the mysteries of
[57:45] the kingdom, but to them it is given. So
[57:49] they only getting parables in the head,
[57:51] but I'm giving mysteries to you because
[57:53] the mysteries belong to the children of
[57:55] God. And the mysteries come down as the
[57:57] word of God and reveal the revelation of
[57:59] God. That's why you have to come hear
[58:01] the word because faith which is
[58:03] revelation come by hearing the word. So
[58:05] when you hear the word, the spirit could
[58:07] pick that up. Shut that in your soul.
[58:09] And the devil can't go inside of you and
[58:11] take it out. He can mess with your mind,
[58:13] but he cannot mess with what God put in
[58:16] your heart.

[58:23] Give the Lord a shout of praise. J could
[58:26] mess with your mind. Mind battles, but
[58:28] he cannot
[58:29] [Applause]
[58:34] mess. Man, I'm getting excited this
[58:38] morning. Hallelujah.
[58:41] Glory to God. That's why somebody could
[58:43] be lunatic in a mad house mental and

[58:50] That's all have to do with inside of
[58:51] here. mental stuff that have nothing to
[58:53] do with that. That's why Legion, look at
[58:55] Legion. He He had a thousand devils and
[58:58] he pressed and he pushed and he said,
[59:01] "Lord, have mercy upon me." Oh, glory to
[59:04] God. So, what about you? How much devils
[59:06] you have? Not hearing what I'm saying.
[59:09] This morning, praise God. If any man
[59:12] thirst, not everybody want to drink the
[59:15] water, you got to be thirsty. A thirst
[59:17] is a painful desire. If you're thirsty,
[59:20] come

[59:35] nobody stiff in here. I don't want a
[59:36] stiff de. I don't want a stiff usher. I
[59:38] don't want no dead person. I don't want
[59:40] a dead elder. I don't want a dead
[59:42] believer. Come alive.
[59:45] [Applause]
[59:50] God, I want to see them deacons raising
[59:51] their hands. I want to see raising their
[59:53] hands. I want to hear you saying
[59:55] hallelujah. Want to join the four beast
[59:57] and join the four 20 24
[1:00:00] elders. We are leaving here.
[1:00:03] [Applause]
[1:00:07] God called me when I was 17 years old.
[1:00:09] And since that time, I'm looking for the
[1:00:11] coming of the Lord. Since that time, I'm
[1:00:13] pressing my
[1:00:15] way. and he is still coming.
[1:00:20] Glory to God. Hallelujah. I pick up a
[1:00:23] wife and he is still coming. I pick up
[1:00:25] three sons. He is still
[1:00:30] coming. I pick up grandsons and he's
[1:00:33] still coming. As for me and my house, we
[1:00:36] going to serve the Lord. Oh, give the
[1:00:38] Lord some praises. It ain't worth
[1:00:41] serving the devil. It ain't worth giving
[1:00:43] yourself to the world. It ain't worth
[1:00:45] it.
[1:00:46] Hallelujah.
[1:00:50] Be seated.
[1:00:56] [Applause]
[1:00:58] Ah,
[1:01:02] this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:01:05] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:01:07] things. According to Malachi 4, he will
[1:01:10] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:01:13] fathers. That's an experience. That's a
[1:01:16] manifestation. Dino walking with no
[1:01:18] spoken with book. That is something that
[1:01:20] has to happen. He has to turn the hearts
[1:01:22] of the children. Back to the faith. Not
[1:01:25] back to church. That's Luther Wesley.
[1:01:28] That's the spirit of man. Back to the
[1:01:31] faith
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:35] because that is what they came out from
[1:01:37] the upper room with. They came up with
[1:01:39] the faith. S and gold have I none. Not
[1:01:42] long
[1:01:45] dress, not jacket and tie, not get a
[1:01:49] nice building to have service in. That
[1:01:51] wasn't the fate. It was silver and gold
[1:01:53] have I none. Such as I have, I give it
[1:01:56] unto you. People were walking. The debt
[1:01:58] was being raised. Life was being
[1:02:00] transformed. Prison couldn't hold them.
[1:02:02] Death couldn't stop them. the when they
[1:02:05] beat them, they came back and said,
[1:02:06] "Lord God, send down some more power as
[1:02:09] we could go back and preach the gospel."
[1:02:12] That's the faith.
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:19] Yeah. Sure. You come to service, that's
[1:02:21] the faith. The miss service, that's the
[1:02:24] faith. You can't pray. That's just
[1:02:26] faith. That's foolishness. God will have
[1:02:29] to take that. God could raise up
[1:02:30] prostitutes. God could raise up slackers
[1:02:32] and bring them inside of here and
[1:02:34] unslack them, make them get tight. God
[1:02:37] could take drunkers and shower them. God
[1:02:40] could take all kind of hoes and
[1:02:41] prostitutes and make them ladies. Make
[1:02:44] them walk right, talk right, live right,
[1:02:46] dress right, and have their hair right.
[1:02:49] My God, I feel like preaching this
[1:02:51] morning, but I have something burning in
[1:02:53] my spirit.
[1:03:00] There is
[1:03:02] power in the name of Jesus.
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:12] You may be seated. One, according to
[1:03:14] Malachi 4, he will turn the hearts of
[1:03:17] the children to the fathers. Two, he
[1:03:19] revealed the mysteries of the seven
[1:03:21] thunders in Revelation 10, which the
[1:03:24] ministers do like to talk about
[1:03:26] because it figures that New York thing.
[1:03:30] Read your Bible. So another mighty angel
[1:03:33] come out of heaven with a crowd.
[1:03:35] Hallelujah. And and a lion roar and
[1:03:37] seven thunders are the voices.
[1:03:40] That's right. That's in the Bible.
[1:03:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] Here's a bump part. Now watch. He will
[1:03:48] reveal the mysteries of the seven times.
[1:03:50] Revelation 10, which are the revelations
[1:03:53] contained in the seven seals. It will be
[1:03:57] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:04:01] that will literally turn the hearts of
[1:04:03] the children to the back to the
[1:04:06] Pentecostal fathers. Amen.
[1:04:14] God gave
[1:04:15] Israel seven feast
[1:04:18] or seven appointments
[1:04:20] to observe. Amen. He gave them the feast
[1:04:23] of the Passover. Amen. Unle the feast of
[1:04:27] the unleven bread. Three, the feast of
[1:04:29] first fruits. Four, the feast of
[1:04:33] Pentecost.
[1:04:34] Five, the feast of trumpets.
[1:04:37] Six, the feast of the atonement or the
[1:04:39] day of atonement. And seven, the feast
[1:04:41] of the tabernacles.
[1:04:44] Amen. It was a reason he gave them these
[1:04:46] observances in that order.
[1:04:50] Amen. Come on. The order of it is
[1:04:52] perfect.
[1:04:54] Because these seven feasts also
[1:04:56] represent seven church ages. Yes, sir.
[1:04:59] Amen. Come on.
[1:05:03] Hallelujah.
[1:05:05] Every biblical holiday given to the
[1:05:09] Jewish people had three aspects. Amen.
[1:05:13] Hallelujah. Israel was to
[1:05:16] observe it in the present to remember
[1:05:20] something of the past. Amen. And it had
[1:05:23] a mystery of what was coming in the
[1:05:24] future. Amen. And I understand how all
[1:05:28] these observances or feast connect them
[1:05:30] to God. Amen. Because God will tell them
[1:05:32] keep the Sabbath, have a holy
[1:05:34] convocation, do this, do that. So it
[1:05:36] always put them in acknowledgment. Amen.
[1:05:39] Now I don't want you to just see Israel.
[1:05:40] I want you to see you. Amen. Amen. Why
[1:05:44] you should pray over your meals?
[1:05:46] Why you should pray in the car? Why you
[1:05:49] should be constantly reminded of who God
[1:05:51] is and his power and his grace towards
[1:05:53] your life.
[1:05:55] Amen.
[1:05:57] Because this is what they had.
[1:06:07] Each Jewish festival was to teach the
[1:06:11] Jewish people about God's character.
[1:06:13] Yes. And to help him un help them
[1:06:16] understand his plan of salvation. Amen.
[1:06:18] Amen. The word
[1:06:21] feast means appointed times. Amen. The
[1:06:25] feast was laid out in a calendar year
[1:06:27] with three occurring close together.
[1:06:30] Hallelujah. Then the coming of the Holy
[1:06:31] Spirit after followed by a long pause
[1:06:34] and then God put it in a way to unfold
[1:06:38] prophetically by these feast. Amen.
[1:06:44] So it is about remembering the Lord.
[1:06:47] Not your friend, not your family, not
[1:06:50] your neighbor, not your coworker, but
[1:06:53] the Lord. About his ordinance and about
[1:06:57] his commandments. Amen. Now, if you want
[1:06:59] to go with me, you could turn your Bible
[1:07:00] to back to Leviticus chapter 23. I'll be
[1:07:03] reading a bit from there. We're going to
[1:07:04] talk about it and you're going to just
[1:07:06] keep it open cuz that's the key
[1:07:07] scripture we're going to use. All the
[1:07:10] feasts are in this chapter. Leviticus
[1:07:12] chapter 23 and I want to read verse 4
[1:07:15] and 5.
[1:07:16] These are the feasts of the Lord, even
[1:07:20] holy convocations, which you shall
[1:07:22] proclaim in their seasons. Amen. In the
[1:07:27] 14th day of the first month at evening
[1:07:30] is the Lord's Passover. Amen. So, keep
[1:07:32] your Bible open and we're going to talk
[1:07:34] now. We're going to share some things
[1:07:35] with you. This Passover had his original
[1:07:39] in Egypt. And you know that when the
[1:07:42] angel was coming and he said, "I'm going
[1:07:44] to pass over you."
[1:07:45] this night and smite all the first boys.
[1:07:47] Isn't that right? And that was a
[1:07:49] memorial of redemption and deliverance
[1:07:51] from the of the children of Israel out
[1:07:53] of Egypt. It was to be there. It was to
[1:07:56] be the beginning of months. And their
[1:07:58] birthday as a nation. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:01] That what that was all about. So God
[1:08:02] say, you know what? Respect that day.
[1:08:04] Remember that day. Call it the Passover.
[1:08:07] I will pass over you. Always observe
[1:08:09] that day. So when they observe that day
[1:08:11] and they humble themselves, they
[1:08:12] remember the Lord. how we pass over our
[1:08:15] people generation after generation of
[1:08:17] Jews. They could communicate to your
[1:08:20] children. Remember this day because on
[1:08:22] this day there was blood on the doorpost
[1:08:25] and the death angel passed over. Our
[1:08:27] people was delivered and their
[1:08:28] generation tell the next generation. So
[1:08:30] they always connected to the scripture.
[1:08:33] Notice how they pray. The God of
[1:08:34] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob praise is the
[1:08:36] same God. But these are our fathers that
[1:08:39] serve this God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:08:42] God was real to them. God was true to
[1:08:45] them. And they see their children down
[1:08:48] with this testimony of the Lord.
[1:08:50] Hallelujah. And by the observance, they
[1:08:53] were connected to the character and the
[1:08:55] behavior of Jehovah. Amen. Oh, praise
[1:08:58] God. Are you with me? So that Passover
[1:09:01] for the Christian is deliverance from
[1:09:03] sin is Jesus as the sacrifice. Isn't
[1:09:06] that right being offered up? But
[1:09:08] Brandham an indictment. He was talking
[1:09:10] about the most holy city, the most
[1:09:12] religious city in the world, the most
[1:09:13] religious people in the world at a
[1:09:15] religious feast, the feast of the
[1:09:16] Passover. There they crucified him.
[1:09:18] Amen. There he indicted them. There they
[1:09:21] crucified him. It was the feast of the
[1:09:22] Passover. And it was to my astonishment,
[1:09:25] God used those feasts perfectly.
[1:09:27] Pentecost was perfectly 50 days.
[1:09:30] Jesus died on the exact day Passover.
[1:09:32] Exact. Amen.
[1:09:35] When the lamb was supposed to be offered
[1:09:37] up exact, that's when he died. Amen.
[1:09:39] Everything is perfect. If that is so,
[1:09:42] then we run into perfect numbers.
[1:09:44] Amen. Oh, glory to God. Isn't that
[1:09:47] right? Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:09:49] The second feast was the feast of the
[1:09:51] unleven bread. And that is verse six in
[1:09:53] your Bible there. On the 15th day of the
[1:09:55] same month for 14 day, 15th day, the
[1:09:58] same month is the feast of the unleven
[1:10:00] bread unto the Lord. Seven days you must
[1:10:03] eat this unleaven bread. This feast
[1:10:07] begins the next night after the
[1:10:09] Passover. God told the Jews to eat pure
[1:10:13] unleaven bread the week following the
[1:10:16] Passover. We will compare that to having
[1:10:18] the communion. Amen. In the Christian
[1:10:20] thing, unleaven bread. And the purpose
[1:10:23] we have unleavened bread and they call
[1:10:24] it unleaven bread because leaven is a
[1:10:26] type of sin. Amen. Iniquity. Amen.
[1:10:29] Malice. So don't put that in. Have
[1:10:32] unleaven bread. Oh, praise be to Jesus.
[1:10:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Leaven in the
[1:10:37] Bible symbolizes sin and evil. Unleaven
[1:10:40] bread eaten over a period of time
[1:10:42] symbolize a holy walk with the Lord.
[1:10:45] Amen. That's what it symbolizes. So
[1:10:47] that's when the understanding to the
[1:10:48] Jews, they understand when they partake.
[1:10:50] And the feast of the unleven bread, they
[1:10:52] are partaking and they saying, "I want a
[1:10:54] holy walk. I want a walk with God."
[1:10:56] Isn't that right? The feast of the
[1:10:57] unleven bread begin the day after the
[1:10:59] Passover continued for seven days. The
[1:11:01] lamb was slain on the 14th day at
[1:11:03] sunset. Remember what the Bible talk
[1:11:05] about? Take a lamb in the 14th day, a
[1:11:06] good lamb and say it. Take the blood
[1:11:08] from that lamb. Praise the Lord. So the
[1:11:11] feast of the 11 bread began immediately
[1:11:14] after sunset which was the beginning of
[1:11:16] the 15th day. Thus there was no interval
[1:11:20] between as the Passover was a type of
[1:11:22] the death of Christ. So the feast of the
[1:11:24] unleven bread is a type of walk of the
[1:11:27] believer. There should be no interval
[1:11:30] between the salvation of the soul and
[1:11:32] his entrance on a holy life and walk.
[1:11:35] Praise God. You don't want to say how
[1:11:36] much the world. No, you walk out the
[1:11:38] world not to connect back with the
[1:11:39] world. You leave the world to find
[1:11:41] Christ. You leave the world for a holy
[1:11:42] walk. You leave the world for a
[1:11:44] righteous walk. Amen.
[1:11:47] Hallelujah.
[1:11:48] Praise God. So the Bible talk about but
[1:11:51] with the unleaven bread of sincerity of
[1:11:52] tr and truth. unleaven bread of
[1:11:55] sincerity and truth. Oh, pray. Walk in a
[1:11:59] newness of life, purging out the leaven
[1:12:01] of worldliness. Isn't that right? Then
[1:12:04] the third feast was the feast of the
[1:12:06] first fruits. And that's verse 10. If
[1:12:09] you look down on your scripture right
[1:12:10] now, verse 10 of of of Leviticus 23,
[1:12:14] speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:12:15] say unto them, when you come into the
[1:12:17] land, all right, because there's
[1:12:19] instructions given in the wilderness. So
[1:12:20] first fruit can be observed in the
[1:12:22] wilderness that'll wait till they come
[1:12:23] in the land cuz you have no fruit in the
[1:12:25] wilderness. Wilderness is journey. When
[1:12:28] you come in the
[1:12:30] land which I give unto you and shall
[1:12:33] reap the harvest thereof. You shall
[1:12:36] bring a sheath of the first fruit of
[1:12:37] your harvest unto the priest. He shall
[1:12:39] wave the sheep before the Lord to be
[1:12:42] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[1:12:44] the Sabbath the priest shall raise it.
[1:12:46] And you shall offer that day that you
[1:12:48] wave the sheep a lamb without blemish
[1:12:50] and the f for the first year for a burnt
[1:12:52] offering. So that uh first fruits was
[1:12:56] the first fruit of your uh crop was to
[1:13:00] be brought before the priest and way
[1:13:01] before the Lord. The very first fruit
[1:13:04] first fruit and that was a type of
[1:13:06] Christ. He was the first fruit of them
[1:13:08] that slept. Amen. His resurrection was
[1:13:11] the first fruit. Oh that we're going to
[1:13:13] be raised from the dead.
[1:13:14] So that was testip tip that was typing
[1:13:17] Christ as the first fruit of him that
[1:13:19] raised from the dead. So whenever you
[1:13:21] get the first fruit you're waving before
[1:13:22] the Lord. What that speaks of others
[1:13:24] coming. So God tell take William Branham
[1:13:28] and he was waved. He was like a wave
[1:13:30] sheath. He was the first son that came
[1:13:32] to maturity and he was wave and God took
[1:13:35] him off the scene and that waving means
[1:13:37] other sons coming just like that. Born
[1:13:39] sons, Phil sons, mature sons. Could we
[1:13:43] give the Lord a shout in the house? I am
[1:13:46] talking about you.
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:53] William Brandon didn't come just for
[1:13:54] William Brandham to come. He came to get
[1:13:57] some children whose hearts turn back to
[1:14:00] the faith of the father. So he was the
[1:14:03] first son that come to maturity. He said
[1:14:05] what you see manifested temporarily will
[1:14:08] be manifested in the fullness when the
[1:14:10] press come. He is not here for that
[1:14:12] press. You are because the press is
[1:14:15] coming. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:14:18] Praise God.
[1:14:19] So, the Passover took place on the 14th
[1:14:22] day of the month. Then you had the feast
[1:14:24] of the unleven bread on the next day,
[1:14:25] which was the Sabbath. And the following
[1:14:28] day, which was the tomorrow after the
[1:14:30] Sabbath, was the first fruits. That's
[1:14:33] why Jesus rose on the Sunday.
[1:14:36] Passover was Friday. Unleaven bread
[1:14:39] Saturday, first fruits Sunday. Amen.
[1:14:42] Which is the eighth day. Which is back
[1:14:44] to the first day. Oh.
[1:14:48] Oh. Glory to God. Praise God. Praise
[1:14:52] God. Do you see it this morning? No. I
[1:14:55] never preach on this. Hallelujah.
[1:14:59] This is the first time I'm preaching on
[1:15:00] this. Amen. Amen. Amen. I never did it.
[1:15:03] All my years never did this.
[1:15:10] So the feast of the first fruit was to
[1:15:11] be celebrated. This could not be done
[1:15:14] until after the children entered in the
[1:15:16] Canaan land. Therefore the first fruits
[1:15:18] was not observed during the wilderness
[1:15:20] wandering. The offering was the sheath
[1:15:23] reaped from the waving field of the
[1:15:25] right harvest carried to the priest wave
[1:15:27] before the Lord for all acceptance and
[1:15:30] was followed by burnt meat drink
[1:15:31] offering and so on. The first fruits was
[1:15:34] foreshadowing the resurrection of
[1:15:36] Christ. He was the first corner wheat in
[1:15:39] John 12:24. He was buried in Joseph tomb
[1:15:42] and resurrection was the first fruit of
[1:15:43] the harvest. Isn't that right? Amen. So
[1:15:45] I'm going to skip down. The next feast
[1:15:47] was the feast of Pentecost scripture
[1:15:49] verse 15 to 22. Look down in Leviticus
[1:15:52] and begin to read. And you shall count
[1:15:57] from the tomorrow after the Sabbath,
[1:16:00] from the day you brought the sheath of
[1:16:02] the waif offering, seven Sabbath shall
[1:16:05] be complete.
[1:16:07] Even unto the tomorrow after the seventh
[1:16:09] Sabbath shall you number 50 days. Amen.
[1:16:12] And he shall offer a new meat offering
[1:16:14] unto the Lord. You shall bring out of
[1:16:16] your habitations two
[1:16:18] wavelength deals. They shall be of fine
[1:16:20] flour. They shall be bacon with leaven.
[1:16:22] They are the first fruits unto the Lord
[1:16:25] and so forth. And the priests, I'll go
[1:16:28] down a little bit. Verse 20. And the
[1:16:29] priest shall wave them with the bread
[1:16:31] and the first fruit for a wave offering
[1:16:32] before the Lord. And the two lambs, they
[1:16:34] shall be holy to the Lord for the
[1:16:35] priest. And you shall proclaim on the
[1:16:37] self-saved day a holy convocation unto
[1:16:40] you. You shall do no survile work
[1:16:42] therein. Verse 22. And you shall reap
[1:16:44] the harvest of your land. You shall make
[1:16:46] clean riddens of the corners of thy
[1:16:48] field. When hold, let me read it again.
[1:16:50] Verse 22. I like this. When you reap the
[1:16:53] harvest of your land, thou shalt not
[1:16:57] make clean riddance of the corners of
[1:16:58] thy field. When thou reapest, neither
[1:17:01] shall thou gather any gleaning of thy
[1:17:03] harvest. Thou shall leave them for the
[1:17:05] poor and unto the stranger. I am the
[1:17:08] Lord. Don't cut down everything and say
[1:17:10] you're going to sell all cuz you want to
[1:17:11] make some money. Say leave back some for
[1:17:13] the poor to get some. And the stranger
[1:17:15] could pass through your field and pick
[1:17:16] some corn.
[1:17:18] Okay. The Lord said, "I am the Lord.
[1:17:21] Behave yourself. Don't be mean, selfish,
[1:17:23] and stingy.
[1:17:27] But I hear shouts in the house. Is this
[1:17:29] getting more real to you? God gave very
[1:17:33] specific
[1:17:34] directions for counting the proper
[1:17:37] number of days until the feast harvest
[1:17:40] which referred to as Pentecost. Amen.
[1:17:42] That is why in Acts they say when the
[1:17:44] day of Pentecost
[1:17:46] was fully come Jesus appeared to them
[1:17:49] for 40 days and then tell them tar in
[1:17:52] the upper room they had to wait 10 more
[1:17:53] days because it had to be 50 days they
[1:17:56] had to get the Holy Ghost on the feast
[1:17:58] of Pentecost. The numbers are perfect
[1:18:04] and we still going forward.
[1:18:08] Oh give the Lord a shout. Are you
[1:18:10] getting revelation? Do you understand
[1:18:13] this omnipotent God that give these the
[1:18:16] feast and doing all things under the
[1:18:18] feast? Hallelujah.
[1:18:22] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.
[1:18:27] It was to take place. This this this
[1:18:29] feast of Pentecost was to take place
[1:18:32] exactly 50 days. Hallelujah. After first
[1:18:34] fruits. So after Jesus rose from the
[1:18:37] dead, he appeared to his disciples. And
[1:18:40] 50 days later when the day of Pentecost
[1:18:43] was fully come to the upper room under
[1:18:46] the feast of Pentecost something had to
[1:18:49] happen God's my numbers can't
[1:18:53] fail there one man there in one accord
[1:18:58] all of a sudden there was a rushing
[1:19:00] mighty wind fill all the holy arms hold
[1:19:03] on and fire
[1:19:05] fire sat upon each one of them
[1:19:09] offering made with fire. Holy Ghost and
[1:19:12] fire. Behold, I send you power. Power
[1:19:15] can't come before time. It has to come
[1:19:17] at the right time, at the appointed
[1:19:20] time. Oh, give the Lord some praises,
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:26] people. Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[1:19:31] Hallelujah.
[1:19:33] Glory to God. So, this was first fruit.
[1:19:37] First fruit representing redeemed and
[1:19:38] resurrected men. That God church would
[1:19:42] be comprised of two parts, Jew and
[1:19:44] Gentile. The elect. Jews are not the
[1:19:46] elect. The elect is the elect. That's
[1:19:49] why they have 144,000. It's not because
[1:19:52] somebody's a Jew, their elect. That's
[1:19:54] foolishness. That's not the scriptures.
[1:19:56] Oh, all Israel is not Israel. Oh, come
[1:19:58] on now. Give the Lord a shout. That's
[1:20:01] why it's 144,000 that's going to be
[1:20:04] sealed. But the same Holy Ghost that you
[1:20:06] are going to be sealed with, it is one
[1:20:09] Holy Ghost calling a Jewish and a
[1:20:12] Gentile bride.
[1:20:14] A Jewish people and a Gentile bride.
[1:20:19] Oh, give the Lord some praise, people. I
[1:20:22] am convinced this is truth. I am
[1:20:24] convinced this is the word. It will
[1:20:26] happen.
[1:20:33] My
[1:20:35] hallelujah. Glory. Father. Hallelujah.
[1:20:40] 50 days after first fruits. All right.
[1:20:41] The feast of Pentecost was observed. The
[1:20:44] space between the two feasts include
[1:20:47] seven Sabbaths.
[1:20:49] Seven church ages. Seven. Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah. Amen. Then on the 50th day,
[1:20:55] charity,
[1:20:57] dynamics, holy spirit. Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] manifestation of sons of God. Seven
[1:21:02] church ages. Type in seven Sabbaths
[1:21:05] after seven church ages. We have a
[1:21:07] promise of another Ephesians, not a Holy
[1:21:10] Ghost land, not a Holy Ghost church. He
[1:21:13] said there going to be a power coming in
[1:21:14] the church. Now coming is when man going
[1:21:17] to speak the word and going to flash
[1:21:19] just like that. The prophet said you
[1:21:20] haven't seen power yet. Well, I'm
[1:21:22] telling you, you ain't seen power yet,
[1:21:24] but power is coming because it's
[1:21:26] promised.
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:31] Oh my. Do I hear people shouting in the
[1:21:35] house? Just ought to get sons and
[1:21:36] daughters excited. Oh, glory to God.
[1:21:40] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:48] Praise God. Do you know? Amen. Where
[1:21:51] Mary and Joseph forget Jesus? She said,
[1:21:53] "Amen." It was the Pentecostal feast.
[1:21:55] All right. Hallelujah. But the Bible say
[1:21:57] where did they leave him? At the
[1:21:58] Pentecostal feast. All right. At that
[1:22:00] feast where they miss him. And he said
[1:22:02] the churches have to go right back.
[1:22:03] Hallelujah. At the Pentecostal feast. He
[1:22:05] said go back to the feast of Pentecost.
[1:22:08] Go back to the pouring of the Holy
[1:22:09] Ghost. There you will find the power of
[1:22:11] almighty God. There you will find the
[1:22:13] risen Christ. Amen. Oh, glory to God.
[1:22:17] Then wearing your dress long is not a
[1:22:19] problem. Wearing your face clean without
[1:22:21] makeup is not a problem. There's no
[1:22:22] fight because you're obeying the word
[1:22:24] and obey. No, no, no, no. is something
[1:22:26] on the inside that that oozing out of
[1:22:28] you. A lamb don't force and put on wool.
[1:22:31] The lamb does bear wool because it's a
[1:22:33] lamb. It have the nature of a lamb. Wool
[1:22:35] come out of a lamb. The nature is built
[1:22:37] in. The lamb wear the lamb put on a wool
[1:22:40] coat. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:43] Come on, give the Lord a shout in the
[1:22:45] house.
[1:22:47] Amen. Hallelujah. I have to do that. I
[1:22:50] don't have to do that. No, you don't
[1:22:51] have to do that.
[1:22:53] You can go back
[1:22:57] but the elect going to press.
[1:23:00] Oh yes. Oh yeah. I love how God did it.
[1:23:03] Hallelujah. Woo.
[1:23:06] You see he's so content just to be in
[1:23:08] church.
[1:23:11] Press
[1:23:15] really Jesus. Amen. But but but but but
[1:23:19] Abel, press him. Jacob, press him. Amen.
[1:23:23] I will not let you go till you bless me.
[1:23:25] That's right. Amen. He wasn't talking
[1:23:27] about flux and money and car and house.
[1:23:29] He had that. Hallelujah. But he
[1:23:31] recognized that is not the thing.
[1:23:33] Because he had that had fear. He had
[1:23:35] that and a sickness. He had that and
[1:23:37] have a spiritual breakthrough. That what
[1:23:38] is that? Nothing. They fight for this
[1:23:40] and fight and they get it. Then what?
[1:23:43] You want that shoes so bad. You don't
[1:23:44] care what the price of the shoes.
[1:23:46] Hallelujah. But you get the shoes now
[1:23:47] when you wear the shoes. And guess what
[1:23:49] is the shoes? That's right.
[1:23:52] And the heel wearing down and the soul
[1:23:55] wearing out. Amen.
[1:23:57] Hallelujah.
[1:23:59] And the fancy shining it losing losing
[1:24:01] the fancy shine. That's right. So Jacob
[1:24:04] recognized he need more than that. So
[1:24:06] God make an arrangement. Amen. That
[1:24:08] Jacob will find himself
[1:24:11] alone. Alone.
[1:24:14] Hallelujah. All right. God made sure he
[1:24:17] didn't bring his cell phone with him.
[1:24:18] No. Because he might have be he might
[1:24:21] have be using WhatsApp or something.
[1:24:23] Might have be streaming or some kind of
[1:24:24] thing. Might be checking his emails. So
[1:24:27] somehow Jacob didn't have none of those
[1:24:29] things. All Jacob had was his mind and
[1:24:32] his heart. Amen. And his brother coming
[1:24:34] for him. And the more he think about his
[1:24:36] brother is the more horrors he get. Is
[1:24:39] the more frightening he get. So he said,
[1:24:41] "Lord, I can't take it. This get too
[1:24:43] much for me to bear. This fear too much
[1:24:45] for me to bear. Something had to happen
[1:24:47] inside of here. Don't come the angels. I
[1:24:50] hear you talking. I hear you praying. I
[1:24:53] hear you hungering. I hear you
[1:24:55] thirsting. I come to see if you're
[1:24:57] serious. Jacob was serious. He said, "I
[1:25:00] ain't letting you go." How many are
[1:25:02] serious? All night long.
[1:25:05] All night long. God was testing. If that
[1:25:09] son is serious, if you are serious,
[1:25:12] forget about everything. You fight for
[1:25:14] what is right. You press your way into
[1:25:16] the kingdom. If you're serious, you want
[1:25:19] to wrestle with that angel. I will not
[1:25:21] let you go till you bless me.
[1:25:28] Oh, glory God. We give the Lord a shout
[1:25:30] in the house.
[1:25:31] When the angel was finished with him, he
[1:25:34] was walking limping. That's right. And
[1:25:36] he wasn't ashamed. He wasn't telling
[1:25:38] what people would think. I changed your
[1:25:40] business. Hallelujah. Laugh at me. Now
[1:25:43] on the inside is a new man. Outside the
[1:25:46] old man, but inside is Give the Lord
[1:25:49] some shouts inside.
[1:25:56] You looking nice outside and inside
[1:25:58] rotten as ever. Hallelujah.
[1:26:00] My Jesus. Flip the script. Change
[1:26:03] inside. The outside look however outside
[1:26:06] look. Hallelujah. Today I shout in the
[1:26:10] house. Be dandy about so much outside.
[1:26:13] Forget about outside. Let's get the
[1:26:15] inside right.
[1:26:18] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:26:20] Lord. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] Brother, go up to Jerusalem and there
[1:26:25] just wait there till I send the promise
[1:26:26] of the father. What did they do? There
[1:26:28] was 120 men and women. They went in the
[1:26:30] upper room at the temple. It was nearing
[1:26:33] the day of the feast of Pentecost. All
[1:26:35] right. From the cleansing of the
[1:26:37] sanctuary, the killing of the Pascal
[1:26:38] lamb, the coming of Pentecost, which was
[1:26:40] the first fruits of the harvest. So when
[1:26:42] them priest doing a ceremony of Passover
[1:26:45] and whatnot, Jesus on the cross, veil
[1:26:47] ran from top to bottom. Glory no more
[1:26:50] and is still doing the business.
[1:26:54] And he is not there. Amen. Amen. Thank
[1:26:57] you, Lord Jesus. He has retreated from
[1:27:00] the temple. Yes. Hallelujah. And the
[1:27:02] glories don't hanging on the cross.
[1:27:04] Introducing a whole different feast time
[1:27:06] altogether.
[1:27:08] Now be after the feast of Pentecost is a
[1:27:10] long period of time. Yes. It's about 4
[1:27:14] months like an interval.
[1:27:17] Between the feast of Pentecost, the next
[1:27:18] feast is the feast of the trumpets.
[1:27:21] Interval about 4 months. No convocation.
[1:27:26] This long in interval was like the
[1:27:28] present dispensation. What the Ram call
[1:27:30] it? I hope I could find it for you. The
[1:27:33] long Pentecostal feast representing the
[1:27:36] church ages.
[1:27:38] Because the trumpets, watch out. Watch.
[1:27:41] Every feast is in order.
[1:27:44] Amen. Perfect order. Amen. Amen. From
[1:27:46] the first feast, Amen. Isn't that right?
[1:27:49] of the Passover coming down. We coming
[1:27:51] down now to the coming of the Lord to
[1:27:54] the millennium to the hereafter. So
[1:27:57] after this feast of Pentecost is the
[1:27:58] trumpets. The trumpets is to guard the
[1:28:01] Jews.
[1:28:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:28:06] So the Gentiles have to be wrapped up as
[1:28:08] it was within the feast of Pentecost.
[1:28:10] Amen. This long feast of Pentecost
[1:28:13] because the trumpet's coming to call the
[1:28:15] Jews back to the homeland. Then it's
[1:28:17] finished.
[1:28:19] Then after the Jews with the trumpets is
[1:28:20] the feast called the day of atonement
[1:28:23] where they going to be repenting
[1:28:26] for rejecting Messiah. Amen. All that is
[1:28:29] the scriptures.
[1:28:31] Oh praise the name of the Lord. Oh glory
[1:28:34] to God. Brother Brandham in recognizing
[1:28:37] this message he said now what here here
[1:28:40] I think this is where I get from between
[1:28:42] the feast of Pentecost and the feast of
[1:28:45] the trumpets was a long period of time
[1:28:48] exactly 50 days between Pentecost and
[1:28:51] the feast of trumpets 50 days Pentecost
[1:28:54] means 50 the first fruit was brought in
[1:28:57] and the first fruit represent the first
[1:28:59] fruit of the Holy Spirit to be poured
[1:29:01] upon the people now we find out
[1:29:05] 50 days was received by the Gentiles.
[1:29:10] God called the Gentiles a people for his
[1:29:13] name. Amen. The feast of Pentecost and
[1:29:17] we have been going through that. We have
[1:29:19] been going through that long feast of
[1:29:22] Pentecost. Amen. Now the 50 days was
[1:29:26] exactly seven Sabbaths. And seven
[1:29:29] Sabbaths represented the seven church
[1:29:32] ages. Amen. to be called in the time of
[1:29:35] the Pentecostal feast. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:29:38] Come on. So, the seven church ages is
[1:29:42] being called in the time of the
[1:29:44] Pentecostal feast. Oh, glory to God.
[1:29:48] Amen. And bear in mind, all seven feasts
[1:29:50] represent seven churches also.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah. Oh, praise. Now, at the end
[1:29:54] of these seven Sabbaths, there was to be
[1:29:56] a day of atonement
[1:29:58] which was the seven trumpets. And the
[1:30:01] seven trumpets was to call a day of
[1:30:02] mourning back to the sacrifice, the
[1:30:04] atonement. The seven trumpets pertain to
[1:30:07] Israel only. Oh, praise the name of the
[1:30:11] Lord. So then we go on to the feast of
[1:30:13] the trumpet, which is verse 24 of
[1:30:16] Leviticus 23. speak unto the children of
[1:30:19] Israel, saying, "The seventh month, in
[1:30:21] the first day of the month, you shall
[1:30:23] have a Sabbath, a memorial of blowing of
[1:30:26] trumpets, a holy convocation." The feast
[1:30:29] of the trumpets, which was observed on
[1:30:31] the first day of the seventh month,
[1:30:32] ushered in a second seed of set feast.
[1:30:35] It fell on the Sabbath day, at the time
[1:30:37] of the new moon. It was followed by the
[1:30:40] day of atonement, on the 10th day of the
[1:30:42] month, and by the feast of the
[1:30:44] tabernacles, which was on the 15th day
[1:30:46] of the month. The oh praise God.
[1:30:50] Hallelujah. So the fact that the feast
[1:30:52] of the trumpets come immediately at the
[1:30:54] close of the interval between the two
[1:30:55] series of set feast which is Pentecost
[1:30:58] trumpets it represent the dispensation
[1:31:00] of grace. That's within that feast
[1:31:03] period. Amen. Isn't that right? So
[1:31:05] brother Brandham on the feast of the
[1:31:07] trumpets brother Brham the garden of
[1:31:09] Israel is the trumpets. The trumpets is
[1:31:12] to gather Israel. Yes sir. All the
[1:31:14] trumpets sounded under the sixth seal
[1:31:16] because the seventh seal there was
[1:31:18] silence. No one knew what was the minute
[1:31:21] or hour that Christ would come. All God
[1:31:24] was calling out Israel natural in Egypt.
[1:31:26] Now it's calling Israel in the spiritual
[1:31:29] sense. He is making them ready for the
[1:31:31] atonement. Amen. So in other words, the
[1:31:34] trumpets come to make Israel ready for
[1:31:36] the atonement of what they reject 2,000
[1:31:38] years ago. Isn't that right? and Moses
[1:31:41] and Elijah, they're going to deal with
[1:31:43] that. They're going to handle those
[1:31:45] 144,000 Jews. Amen. Now, the feast of
[1:31:47] the trumpet was first, which was
[1:31:48] Pentecost. The feast of the atonement
[1:31:50] followed it 50 days later. We're going
[1:31:51] to skip down a little bit. This has been
[1:31:54] watch the calling out of the church.
[1:31:57] Jesus.
[1:31:58] Amen. Afterwards, he took them into the
[1:32:01] land of promise. He will do the same
[1:32:03] thing. He takes the church to the land
[1:32:06] of promise. What's the land of promise?
[1:32:08] The Holy Spirit. Amen. That's your land
[1:32:10] of promise. Don't avoid it. Don't dock
[1:32:13] it. Tell yourself you have to have it.
[1:32:14] Amen. You need it. Jesus said, "Blessed
[1:32:17] are they that hunger and thirst after
[1:32:19] righteousness." They shall shall be
[1:32:23] filled. Amen. Hallelujah. Could we give
[1:32:25] the Lord some praises? Glory to God. Not
[1:32:29] blessed are they that come to church. He
[1:32:31] didn't say that. He said, "Blessed are
[1:32:32] they that hunger and thirst after
[1:32:35] righteousness." There's a natural
[1:32:36] hungering and there's a spiritual
[1:32:38] hungering. There's a natural thirst, but
[1:32:41] there's a spiritual thirst. David said
[1:32:43] it this way. As the heart planted after
[1:32:44] the waterbrook, so my soul thirst after
[1:32:47] the living God. Thirst could save you.
[1:32:50] Oh, glory to God. Thirsting for the
[1:32:52] right thing could save you because
[1:32:54] thirsting could drive you to
[1:32:55] desperation. You got to have it. You got
[1:32:58] to drink it. Come unto me all ye that
[1:33:01] are heavy laden. I'll give you rest unto
[1:33:03] your souls. Oh, glory to God. But if
[1:33:05] there's no test, you're drifting.
[1:33:09] Amen. Hallelujah. You're not desperate
[1:33:11] to go to the doctor because you don't
[1:33:13] know how sick you really are.
[1:33:17] You see, when Peter started to walk on
[1:33:18] the water side of sink, Peter didn't
[1:33:20] have to ball. Lord, help me. You know,
[1:33:22] Peter could have closed his eyes and
[1:33:23] said going backstroke. I doing front
[1:33:25] stroke. I'm a fisherman. I don't want to
[1:33:27] be embarrassed. I don't want to feel
[1:33:28] small in front of my other fishermanmen
[1:33:31] cuz all fishermanmen could swim. I don't
[1:33:34] think I go down the sea and I can't
[1:33:35] swim. That makes no sense. But this was
[1:33:38] sinking in the Jewish sense of sinking,
[1:33:39] you know, cuz devil was in the mix
[1:33:41] there. Amen. He said, "Lord, help me.
[1:33:44] I'm sinking." Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:47] Because Peter eyes move off the ball. He
[1:33:50] move over Christ. He start to sink. But
[1:33:53] I like him because he was able to say,
[1:33:54] "I am sinking. Help me." Oh, glory to
[1:33:58] God.
[1:34:01] You afraid to cry for help. You need the
[1:34:03] help. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Cry for
[1:34:06] help. Don't be afraid. Help Lord help
[1:34:08] me. Help me. Don't know what way to be.
[1:34:10] I don't know what way to go, which way
[1:34:12] to turn. Help me. I'm sinking. I'm
[1:34:15] struggling. Struggling to come to
[1:34:17] service today. Not knowing what the Lord
[1:34:19] will speak to me, but I come. You made
[1:34:20] it. I'm waiting for God to speak to you.
[1:34:23] And I believe God going to speak to you
[1:34:24] by his word. Oh, praise the name of the
[1:34:27] Lord. Now, hear this bum. The seventh
[1:34:30] trumpet is to Israel the same as the
[1:34:35] seventh seal was to the church. Amen.
[1:34:39] Amen. Not seven seals. Seventh seventh
[1:34:42] seal. The seventh trumpet was to Israel
[1:34:46] the same as the seventh seal was to the
[1:34:48] church. And under the seventh seal there
[1:34:49] were seven thunders. Yes sir. To call a
[1:34:51] bride. Amen. To gather a bride together
[1:34:54] to give the bride faith. To show the
[1:34:56] bride how to prepare. He is still
[1:34:58] calling a bride. Amen. Do you believe
[1:35:00] that? Praise God. For years, a bunch of
[1:35:04] church members, three kinds, but God
[1:35:06] going to call a bride. He's still
[1:35:07] calling a bride. We still have a revival
[1:35:10] that is promised. That ain't pass yet.
[1:35:12] You know, that's still coming.
[1:35:16] Seven times. Give faith for rapturing
[1:35:18] grace. That's still coming. Because
[1:35:20] rapturing grace, you say, you see a man
[1:35:21] dead on the floor, see him raised up,
[1:35:23] that's supposed to give rapturing faith
[1:35:24] to the church.
[1:35:26] That's mean dynamics, power coming to
[1:35:28] produce the same faith that Peter had.
[1:35:31] Peter didn't have no mystery faith. He
[1:35:33] had no talking faith. He had a living
[1:35:35] faith, a manifesting faith.
[1:35:41] [Applause]
[1:35:44] Hallelujah.
[1:35:46] So it kind of disingenous to come and
[1:35:48] tell me somebody have faith and there is
[1:35:51] no miracles, there's no signs, there's
[1:35:52] no power, there's no wonders, no
[1:35:53] trouble. They have faith to talk
[1:35:57] like talking faith. That is not the walk
[1:36:00] in faith. Peter thought he had faith
[1:36:02] too. But when they say, "You are one of
[1:36:03] them." He said, "No, no, not me at all."
[1:36:06] That's denial number one. They said, "By
[1:36:08] sure, but you dressing like them. I saw
[1:36:10] you walk into that church, you know." He
[1:36:11] said, "No, you're not. Not me. Not me.
[1:36:12] Not me. I I didn't go. I didn't go."
[1:36:15] Amen.
[1:36:17] The third time Peter had a curse. They
[1:36:20] said, "Nah, he he want Christian.
[1:36:22] Christian Jesus disciples don't behave
[1:36:24] like that. Then is when Jesus had a cry
[1:36:28] because he recognized he couldn't walk
[1:36:30] the walk. He was talking all along but
[1:36:33] he didn't have what it take to meet the
[1:36:36] challenge. And that's what I'm saying.
[1:36:38] The press is coming. You have to have
[1:36:39] what it takes. Sitting down on a church
[1:36:41] bench is not what it takes. Millions
[1:36:44] doing that right now this morning. So we
[1:36:45] not talking about that. We talking about
[1:36:47] divine revelation to give a prevailing
[1:36:49] power and then the inspiration coming
[1:36:51] upon that.
[1:36:52] can anoint you for the job of the hour.
[1:36:54] Oh,
[1:36:57] listen. God not afraid to anoint you.
[1:37:00] You know,
[1:37:02] God anointed David before David was
[1:37:04] ready. You know,
[1:37:08] David was the eighth son of Jesse. You
[1:37:10] know, he had overcome his seven
[1:37:12] brothers.
[1:37:15] [Applause]
[1:37:17] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Watch out
[1:37:20] for number eight.
[1:37:23] Number eight is a new creation. Number
[1:37:25] eight is back to the beginning. After
[1:37:27] the seven run out is charity, faith,
[1:37:29] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:37:32] confidence, brotherly kindness. Seven
[1:37:33] run out. Charity never failth. Charity
[1:37:37] is number eight. We are going into
[1:37:39] number eight. The thing that cannot
[1:37:41] fail. This pride will be an invincible
[1:37:43] army.
[1:37:46] [Applause]
[1:37:51] There be no manifestation to s the
[1:37:53] bride. It will take those seven thunders
[1:37:56] to wake her up.
[1:38:00] [Applause]
[1:38:02] Wake off for for more talk. Wake up to
[1:38:05] know who she is and that she can do the
[1:38:08] greater works.
[1:38:10] Come on now. Come on now.
[1:38:15] You may be seated. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:38:17] hallelujah.
[1:38:19] You stronger than you think.
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:26] Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] You are more faith than you think.
[1:38:31] Hallelujah. You are stronger than you.
[1:38:33] See, you you listen to the devil who
[1:38:35] tell you your weapon not good enough and
[1:38:37] the word is not good enough. That the
[1:38:38] devil is a liar.
[1:38:42] Abraham could not show no evidence Isaac
[1:38:44] was coming. Every day he see an old
[1:38:46] wrinkle of face say Sarah
[1:38:50] Sarah grumpy but God tell him through
[1:38:53] Sarah you're having a son he had to
[1:38:56] watch that old face watch that attitude
[1:38:58] and believe God and the Bible said he
[1:39:01] believed God staged not at the promise
[1:39:03] of God through unbelief but was strong
[1:39:06] in faith giving glory to God.
[1:39:10] [Applause]
[1:39:12] Listen just refuse to die.
[1:39:16] Hallelujah. If the doctor say you have
[1:39:19] stage 10 cancer, refuse to die. Unless
[1:39:22] God pronounce you're dead, don't let the
[1:39:24] devil tell you you're dead.
[1:39:29] Everybody's supposed to be shouting
[1:39:30] inside of
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:33] here. Whoa.
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:38] Give me a scripture. Psalms 118. I shall
[1:39:41] not die but live to declare the works of
[1:39:45] the Lord. My God, I don't want the dead
[1:39:48] yet. I said over there hold I want to
[1:39:51] get I want to say once more Lord I want
[1:39:53] to r some Philistines. I want to back up
[1:39:55] some Hittites. I want to drown out some
[1:39:57] Jebusites. I want to possess my
[1:39:59] mountain. I want to push back some
[1:40:01] Philistines. Come on now. Give the Lord
[1:40:03] a shout in the
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:06] house. Glory to God. It have to start
[1:40:09] somewhere. Have they had some time? May
[1:40:12] it start now. May it start here. May it
[1:40:14] start with
[1:40:18] you. Let the weak say. Let the weak say
[1:40:23] I am strong.
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:46] Glory. Glory to the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:52] Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My Lord
[1:40:56] and my God.
[1:40:59] The sixth feast. The feast of atonement.
[1:41:02] The day of atonement. That it was 26. I
[1:41:04] start to read it. And the Lord spake
[1:41:06] unto Moses, saying, "The 10th day of the
[1:41:08] seventh month, there shall be a day of
[1:41:09] atonement. It shall be an holy
[1:41:11] convocation unto you, you shall afflict
[1:41:14] your souls and offer an offering me by
[1:41:17] fire unto the Lord. You shall do no work
[1:41:19] in the same day. For it is the day of an
[1:41:22] atonement, Amen. to make an atonement
[1:41:24] for you before the Lord your God." G.
[1:41:27] For whatsoever soul it be that shall not
[1:41:29] be afflicted in that day, he shall be
[1:41:31] cut off from among his people.
[1:41:34] Whatsoever soul be that doeth any work
[1:41:36] in that same day, the same soul I
[1:41:38] destroy from among the people. So on the
[1:41:41] day of atonement that Jew live or died,
[1:41:44] he had to live or died. Amen. Day of
[1:41:46] atonement, the high priest went once a
[1:41:48] year to see if they were forgiven.
[1:41:51] The temple is there. The the the the
[1:41:53] tent is there. The cloud of glory is
[1:41:55] over the tent. The high priest have to
[1:41:57] go out with blood to offer on behalf of
[1:42:00] Israel. Israel is in tension. They want
[1:42:03] to know if God has forgiven them. Yes.
[1:42:06] One man had to go inside of there. He
[1:42:08] had to go inside of there with a rope.
[1:42:10] That's right. In case he did, they had
[1:42:11] to pull him out because nobody else
[1:42:13] could go inside of there. The man had to
[1:42:15] be dressed right. He had to have bells
[1:42:17] around him. The bells was ringing
[1:42:20] symbolizing holy holy unto the Lord.
[1:42:24] Those bells was reflecting an order in
[1:42:27] heaven. In heaven they have saraphs.
[1:42:29] Sarah's worshiping day and night. Heaven
[1:42:32] is noisy. This is the quietest place
[1:42:35] you're going to be. In hell have noise
[1:42:38] in heaven have noise. I'm identifying
[1:42:41] with the noise in heaven. But when that
[1:42:44] priest high priest Aaron with the bells
[1:42:47] around him when he walking holy, holy,
[1:42:51] holy, Lord God almighty, holy. And when
[1:42:55] he just standing to pour the blood over
[1:42:57] the sacrifice, they're in silence.
[1:43:02] The people are waiting. They don't know
[1:43:04] when God forgive them. But when they
[1:43:06] hear them bells coming back out ringing,
[1:43:10] the people start to shout. They start to
[1:43:12] rejoice. They start to be happy because
[1:43:15] they know for one more year.
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:21] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. The
[1:43:25] day of atonement, you may be seated, was
[1:43:27] Israel annual cleansing from sin.
[1:43:30] Hallelujah. And that was replaced by
[1:43:33] Jesus, our sin offering. Our high
[1:43:35] priest. Isn't that right? In Christ, we
[1:43:38] are saved and him alone. Hallelujah.
[1:43:40] Through him alone. Isn't that right? Oh,
[1:43:42] praise the name of the Lord. Praise be
[1:43:45] to Jesus. And this atonement of
[1:43:47] rejection of of of what how to reject
[1:43:49] Christ is found in Zechariah 12. And it
[1:43:52] shall come to pass in that day I will
[1:43:54] seek to destroy all the nation that come
[1:43:56] against Jerusalem. And listen, I will
[1:43:58] pour upon the house of David, upon the
[1:44:01] inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of
[1:44:03] grace and of supplication. Hear the
[1:44:06] prophecy, and they shall look upon me
[1:44:08] whom they have pierced. They shall mourn
[1:44:10] for him as one mourning for his only
[1:44:12] son, and shall be in bitterness for him
[1:44:14] as one that is bitterness for his
[1:44:16] firstborn. In that day there shall be
[1:44:18] great mourning in Jerusalem. And in the
[1:44:20] land shall mourn every family apart, the
[1:44:23] family of the house of David apart, the
[1:44:25] family of the house of Nathan apart, the
[1:44:26] wives apart, and the Levi and so on and
[1:44:28] so they'd be mourning. Amen. Because
[1:44:30] Christ will show this is is me you
[1:44:32] reject the one you have pierced. Oh,
[1:44:36] hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Okay, we
[1:44:38] going now to the last feast. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:41] The feast of the tabernacles.
[1:44:43] Hallelujah. Verse 23-36. And the Lord
[1:44:45] speaking to Moses saying the scripture
[1:44:47] speak unto the children of Israel saying
[1:44:49] the 15th day of the seventh month shall
[1:44:50] be a feast of tabernacles for seven days
[1:44:52] unto the Lord. The first day shall be a
[1:44:55] holy convict a convocation. You shall do
[1:44:58] no survive work therein. Seven days you
[1:45:00] shall offer an offering made by fire
[1:45:01] unto the Lord. On the eighth day shall
[1:45:04] be a holy convocation unto you. You
[1:45:06] shall offer an offering me by fire. It
[1:45:08] is a solemn assembly. You shall do no
[1:45:11] survi work
[1:45:12] therein. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:45:14] Verse 39, also on the 15th day of the
[1:45:17] month, you shall have gathered the fruit
[1:45:19] of the lamb, you shall keep the feast of
[1:45:21] the Lord seven days. Verse 40, you shall
[1:45:23] take the f on the first day bows of
[1:45:26] goodly trees, branches, and palm trees.
[1:45:28] And I'll just summarize a little bit.
[1:45:30] Make little boots to live in outside
[1:45:32] your house to remind them of the little
[1:45:35] tents that you live in coming out of
[1:45:37] Israel. To this day, they still do it in
[1:45:39] front of nice house. They make little
[1:45:41] boots of bows and so on and stay inside
[1:45:43] the deal. to remember that is how it was
[1:45:46] in the wilderness. Amen. That's why
[1:45:48] called the feast of tabernacles.
[1:45:50] Oh my. Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus.
[1:45:54] And brother Brandham says, "Oh my."
[1:45:57] Watch my
[1:46:01] Oh, glory to God. This is so much. This
[1:46:04] is so much. This is so much.
[1:46:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:10] Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. I go
[1:46:13] here. Wow. I want to skip down. So,
[1:46:16] brother said, I just going to skip a
[1:46:17] little bit. He said, now watch. Um, you
[1:46:19] cannot live by yesterday light.
[1:46:21] Yesterday light is only a memory. The
[1:46:23] wheat could not live in the same
[1:46:24] sunlight in June. See, it can't do it.
[1:46:27] No, let's back up and see. So, so, so in
[1:46:29] other words, the the wheat have to be
[1:46:31] mature to get the type of sun it have in
[1:46:33] June. The sun not changing wheat
[1:46:35] maturing. That hot hot sun in June, July
[1:46:39] cannot hit that wheat in May or so. It
[1:46:41] will kill it. So, it has to mature.
[1:46:42] Isn't that right? The sun comes stronger
[1:46:45] each day and the grain should be more
[1:46:47] matured to receive the sunlight. And
[1:46:49] that's the matter today. The grain that
[1:46:50] swed in the early fathers back there,
[1:46:52] Luther Wesley, the sun kills it and
[1:46:54] refuse to grow. See, watch. It becomes a
[1:46:57] husk and no life in it. The grain should
[1:47:00] be maturing and getting stronger and
[1:47:02] stronger each day. Amen. Now the shock
[1:47:05] that covering the grain when that sun
[1:47:07] begin to hit that shock, the shock dry.
[1:47:09] So the shock can handle the pressure.
[1:47:11] All right. Hallelujah. But the grain,
[1:47:13] the grain want the sun. The grain, the
[1:47:16] sun making the grain go from green to
[1:47:18] golden brown. Golden brown Christians.
[1:47:21] Amen. Not green Christians. Golden brown
[1:47:24] Christians. You understand the
[1:47:26] shipwreck. You understand the prison.
[1:47:28] You understand? You have to come out
[1:47:29] through a basket over the wall. You
[1:47:31] understand? Escaping the enemy. Isn't
[1:47:34] that right? Oh, praise the Lord. Blessed
[1:47:37] be the name of the Lord. Now watch how
[1:47:39] the grain would mature and come down to
[1:47:42] this last hour. This last hour we're
[1:47:44] living in. The churches must do the same
[1:47:46] thing. But the grain goes right on. He
[1:47:48] said we are another eight. Why won't
[1:47:51] they receive it? You see that grain is
[1:47:54] matured. Here is the promised word for
[1:47:56] the day. Them seven seals where the
[1:47:59] whole mystery was revealed would come
[1:48:01] back and tell while these mysteries were
[1:48:03] done. They walked further away from it
[1:48:05] than ever. They're without excuse. I
[1:48:07] know. Now watch. Luther's manner was the
[1:48:09] message of justification. Wesley message
[1:48:11] was the message of sanctification. The
[1:48:13] Pentecostal was the restoration of the
[1:48:14] gifts. But this is here we go.
[1:48:17] Introducing the headstone,
[1:48:20] the last day. Hallelujah. The bride
[1:48:22] tree. Hallelujah. Which is contrary to
[1:48:24] all of it. It's the same light for the
[1:48:27] matured. Hallelujah. Like the same
[1:48:29] sunshine today will be ripening the
[1:48:31] green for the harvest in July. You see
[1:48:33] what I mean? The light today won't do
[1:48:37] any good back there in July. It is
[1:48:39] stronger. The wheat is more advanced.
[1:48:41] Isn't that right? So has the real little
[1:48:44] minority of the church grow from
[1:48:46] justification, sanication, baptism of
[1:48:49] the Holy Ghost. Now the coming of the
[1:48:51] capstone shaping itself up. No more
[1:48:54] organization after this.
[1:48:56] So once I see and smell and hear
[1:48:58] organization, I run for my life. He said
[1:49:01] no more. because you're coming into
[1:49:02] maturity now where you have to get your
[1:49:04] own portion on your inheritance. Like
[1:49:08] the other day, here we go. Question
[1:49:10] answers. I got something mixed up. He
[1:49:13] said, you probably hear I was talking
[1:49:14] about the seven trumpets and I said
[1:49:16] seven trumpets and I was referring to
[1:49:18] the Pentecostal feast. From the
[1:49:19] Pentecostal feast until the trumpets
[1:49:21] there were seven Sabbaths and seven
[1:49:23] Sabbaths means seven churches. Well, now
[1:49:25] you understand that because we talked
[1:49:27] that already, right? from the Pentecost,
[1:49:29] the Sabbath to the trumpets. Seven
[1:49:31] Sabbaths. He said, "Now watch." He got
[1:49:33] it mixed up. He said, "Now watch." I'll
[1:49:36] just jump off. Count off seven months.
[1:49:38] January, February, March, April, May,
[1:49:42] June, July is seven months. Amen. Which
[1:49:46] represents seven church ages. Amen. Some
[1:49:48] minister might pick that up. Yes, sir.
[1:49:50] And then you'll have it. Hallelujah.
[1:49:52] Have what? A harvest. Amen. Where? In
[1:49:54] July. July. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:49:56] praise this people.
[1:49:58] Oh,
[1:50:01] hallelujah.
[1:50:02] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:50:04] Hallelujah. In that seven month, we're
[1:50:07] looking for a harvest. In this seventh
[1:50:09] month, we're looking for a rain to fall.
[1:50:11] In that seven month, we're looking for
[1:50:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We have a
[1:50:15] right to be anointed. Hallelujah.
[1:50:18] January, February, March, April, May,
[1:50:20] June, July. Some minister may pick it
[1:50:23] up. Then you're going to have it. Oh,
[1:50:25] give the Lord some praise this people.
[1:50:27] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:50:29] Hallelujah. Holy convocation. Amen. Is a
[1:50:33] calling of a a solemn assembly. Amen.
[1:50:35] That is what is a holy conversation. A
[1:50:37] convocation is a calling of a solemn
[1:50:40] assembly. An assembly by summons.
[1:50:44] Not asking you to come. When the judge
[1:50:46] serve a summons, you have to come. Oh,
[1:50:49] glory to God. Only elect getting served
[1:50:52] with this summons. The Lord himself. 1
[1:50:56] Thessalonians 4 come down with the
[1:50:58] summons which is the seven thunders to
[1:51:01] summon to you to a holy convocation. The
[1:51:04] Lord himself descends with a shout.
[1:51:07] That's the summons. Only elect going to
[1:51:10] get that. Oh hallelujah. You ain't just
[1:51:13] called. You have been summoned. You got
[1:51:17] to make it. You're going to make it. You
[1:51:19] didn't bring this far to lose you. Come
[1:51:22] on now. You're going to make it. They
[1:51:24] got to make it. You will make it. You
[1:51:27] have to make it. You have been summoned
[1:51:29] to this great call.
[1:51:33] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:51:35] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Someone say
[1:51:38] what? A 8th day holy convocation. Not
[1:51:41] just holy congregation. Amen. But the
[1:51:43] eighth day that is specific. That's the
[1:51:45] title of the message. The 8th day holy
[1:51:47] congregation. Hallelujah. You going to
[1:51:48] get what that 8th day really is. Praise
[1:51:50] God. Oh, glory to God. Amen. Brother
[1:51:52] Brandham from future home of the
[1:51:54] heavenly bridegroom. Oh, glory to God.
[1:51:56] Hallelujah. He say your old life passed
[1:51:58] away. Your old desire passed away. I
[1:52:00] think Anthony thank for the message last
[1:52:01] week that struck. Amen. New creation.
[1:52:04] This is a continuation of that. Oh,
[1:52:06] hallelujah. Praise God. The old desire
[1:52:09] has passed. When you used to drink and
[1:52:11] cuss and fuss and stew and run around
[1:52:13] immoral, it died. Amen. Then you were
[1:52:15] Satan instrument. Now you are redeemed.
[1:52:19] Amen. Oh, glory. what the world will be
[1:52:22] redeemed.
[1:52:23] That's why John said, "I saw a new
[1:52:25] heaven and a new earth. It's a redeemed
[1:52:28] heaven. It's a redeemed earth." Isn't
[1:52:30] that right? And you will be redeemed.
[1:52:33] Oh, glory to God. Changed. Transformed.
[1:52:37] Not painted over, not brushed over,
[1:52:40] changed, transformed. You don't want
[1:52:43] you, you want him. Oh, give the Lord
[1:52:46] some praises, people. Do you believe
[1:52:49] that? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You a new
[1:52:51] creature. Praise God. A new creation in
[1:52:54] the same old temple. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:58] Same face.
[1:53:01] But new creation in the old temple. Oh,
[1:53:05] glory to God. Isn't that right?
[1:53:07] Hallelujah. Praise God. So, watch.
[1:53:11] Before he could come and live on it, he
[1:53:13] had to watch. Before he could come into
[1:53:15] us to live, he had to give us the
[1:53:17] baptism of fire. Amen. Then the Holy
[1:53:21] Ghost can come in.
[1:53:25] We 10% say amen on that one.
[1:53:28] Maybe you have the fire already. But I
[1:53:30] ain't feeling it, you know. Because I
[1:53:32] hear you. I hear it in your worship and
[1:53:33] in your shouts. If you don't have the
[1:53:35] fire, the fire have to come to burn the
[1:53:37] snake out to burn yourself righteousness
[1:53:39] out to burn all what you think to burn
[1:53:41] your head out. Your head too high. Fire
[1:53:45] on that head. Oh, glory to God.
[1:53:47] intellect too strong, too strong minded,
[1:53:50] too strong willed. Oh, praise be to
[1:53:52] Jesus. When you get the baptism of fire,
[1:53:56] then the Holy Ghost can come in. Amen.
[1:53:59] What does it do? It burns out everything
[1:54:02] contrary to the word. It would leave
[1:54:04] nothing else but the word. Hear what
[1:54:06] John said? Whose shoes I'm not worthy to
[1:54:09] unloose. He shall baptize you with the
[1:54:13] Holy Ghost and with fire. Praise God.
[1:54:16] This man is something else. He gone for
[1:54:18] talk. He come to release fire on me yet.
[1:54:22] Holy Ghost on fire. I feel that fire is
[1:54:25] here this morning. I feel that people
[1:54:27] are going to be changing this morning. I
[1:54:29] believe you could be changed this
[1:54:30] morning. You could be healed this
[1:54:32] morning because he's the same yesterday,
[1:54:34] today, forever. You could be delivered
[1:54:36] this morning.
[1:54:38] [Applause]
[1:54:40] Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:54:42] Hallelujah.
[1:54:44] Glory to God.
[1:54:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. The
[1:54:49] anointing is in the building. The spirit
[1:54:52] of God is here. Ride it.
[1:54:55] Worship. Give him praise. Glory to God.
[1:54:59] That's how it was in the upper room.
[1:55:02] They create an atmosphere. Holy Spirit
[1:55:04] can come and dry. Holy Spirit can come
[1:55:07] on dead. They was in the spirit. They
[1:55:09] were worshiping and blessing God
[1:55:11] continually. That's the word. They were
[1:55:14] dry seeds, but that didn't stop them
[1:55:16] from worshiping. They had revelation.
[1:55:18] That didn't stop them from worshiping.
[1:55:20] Their understanding was open. That
[1:55:22] didn't stop them from worshiping. The
[1:55:24] word was open to them. That didn't stop
[1:55:26] them from worshiping because their
[1:55:28] understanding was open. Because the word
[1:55:30] was open because they had revelation.
[1:55:32] They had expectation. And faith is a
[1:55:35] revelation that brings expectation.
[1:55:38] [Applause]
[1:55:40] Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] You may be
[1:55:45] seated. Amen. Faith doesn't bring
[1:55:48] examination.
[1:55:49] But he wait to see you know. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:52] I receive from himself. Hallelujah. And
[1:55:54] Elijah walked up to that woman. He said,
[1:55:56] "Bake me a cake first." Who you? Where's
[1:55:59] your credentials? Let me see the ID
[1:56:01] card. Hallelujah.
[1:56:04] Hallelujah. Look to Elijah. I command a
[1:56:06] woman to feed you there. She has no
[1:56:08] food, you know. But he command her. Yes.
[1:56:11] She don't even know she under command.
[1:56:16] She command to feed him. Yes. And she
[1:56:19] have a little bit of flour, a little bit
[1:56:21] of oil to make final bread. She and her
[1:56:23] son going to die. And this man walk up
[1:56:25] and say, "Bake me a cake first." Is
[1:56:28] somebody intellectual? What? I going to
[1:56:29] bake my cake and I close my door. Yes.
[1:56:32] Amen. But faith doesn't work like that.
[1:56:35] Faith doesn't work by examination. It's
[1:56:37] work by something inside that heart.
[1:56:38] That woman turned to do the bake first.
[1:56:42] And when she turned, she hear thus say
[1:56:44] the Lord. That not dust is an opinion.
[1:56:46] Like dust say the Lord. The oil wouldn't
[1:56:49] run down. Your flour wouldn't go out. As
[1:56:52] she dip, she getting more. My God. The
[1:56:54] water sappy. She dip. She get more. I
[1:56:56] put too much of water. I need some more
[1:56:57] flour. She dip. Just dip. You don't have
[1:56:59] to look. Just dip. You don't have to
[1:57:01] look. You don't have to shake the
[1:57:03] barrel. Just
[1:57:04] dip. Commanding blessing. Just dip. Come
[1:57:07] on. Say it. Just dip. We need oil. Just
[1:57:11] dip. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:57:16] I wish Christians were more light and
[1:57:18] free. You too heavy with unbelief. You
[1:57:21] do heavy with your own thoughts and
[1:57:22] ideas.
[1:57:24] Amen.
[1:57:33] Free yourself. Loose yourself. Stop
[1:57:35] being so stiff in your own thoughts. Oh
[1:57:38] my. I don't know. Let me get out of
[1:57:40] here. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Praise
[1:57:42] God. You could take some more. We have
[1:57:44] lots more. Don't worry. Is if you could
[1:57:47] take it,
[1:57:49] [Applause]
[1:57:50] my Lord. So therefore, the Millennium
[1:57:53] Marine is still in time. Thousand years.
[1:57:56] What does the Millennium Marine
[1:57:58] represent? 6,000 years. The Millennium
[1:58:00] Marine represent the seventh.
[1:58:04] And after that is the eighth eternity.
[1:58:06] Amen. Because the millennium is still in
[1:58:07] time. But Abraham said it this way. He
[1:58:10] said, "Notice the millennium reign, the
[1:58:12] thousand years is not the new earth. The
[1:58:14] millennium rain is a different reign.
[1:58:16] That's what we go into. The millennium,
[1:58:19] but that isn't the new earth and new
[1:58:20] heaven." No, no, no. That's just a rest
[1:58:22] place, a rest period. That is what this
[1:58:25] feast of the tamalu represented, a place
[1:58:27] of rest. The seven feasts in the boots.
[1:58:32] Isn't that right? Yeah. See, in the
[1:58:34] millennium, we have things that we would
[1:58:36] not go into. It is a type of the old
[1:58:38] seventh day out at Eden. The seventh day
[1:58:41] he made the world. On the seventh day,
[1:58:43] he rested in Eden and the millennium.
[1:58:45] And the world now is almost 6,000 years.
[1:58:48] Every 2,000 years in destruction. The
[1:58:49] first 2,000 years was the flood,
[1:58:51] baptized with water. The next 2,000
[1:58:53] years come and sanify it and claim it
[1:58:54] with his blood. Now is fire. The next
[1:58:57] second 2,000 years, what? Now he burns
[1:58:59] her off and claims it as his own. Not
[1:59:02] the perfect world. This millennium is a
[1:59:06] type of the seventh day. Then comes the
[1:59:08] white throne judgment. We still have
[1:59:10] judgment. We still in time in the
[1:59:12] millennium. It's a day 1,000 years. It's
[1:59:14] a time element. Don't get it mixed up
[1:59:16] with the new heaven and new earth. It is
[1:59:18] not. Now you say, brother Brandon,
[1:59:20] you're trying to put something way over
[1:59:21] yonder beyond the seventh day. This is
[1:59:24] brother saying this now. Now the seventh
[1:59:26] day Sabbath and God made the earth and
[1:59:28] labored six days rested in the seventh
[1:59:30] day was only a type of time. But I've
[1:59:34] said we become eternal. So where is your
[1:59:36] type now? You said your typologist you
[1:59:39] run out of types now. No I haven't.
[1:59:42] Let's find out what we have. Come on.
[1:59:44] This is brother Brandham speaking. He
[1:59:46] said now Leviticus 23rd chapter. So he's
[1:59:49] going into that. He said now watch
[1:59:51] remember there are seven feast days. The
[1:59:55] feast of the trumpets, the feast of
[1:59:56] tabernacles, the feast of shaven. There
[1:59:58] are seven great feasts that was only a
[2:00:00] type of the seven church ages. Now you
[2:00:02] remember how many Sabbaths there was
[2:00:04] between one and the other. Seven
[2:00:05] Sabbaths between Pentecost and the
[2:00:06] trumpets, which was seven church ages.
[2:00:09] And there was a seven feast days that
[2:00:11] represented the seven churches. Keep
[2:00:13] your numbers running. Amen. Seven days.
[2:00:16] 36 verse he's reading from Leviticus.
[2:00:19] Seven days shall you made an offering
[2:00:21] made by fire unto the Lord. On the
[2:00:24] eighth day there shall be a holy
[2:00:26] convocation. Amen. So all the time he
[2:00:28] talking about seven seven7 but in the
[2:00:30] scripture talk about the eighth day and
[2:00:32] then he prophesied there's another holy
[2:00:34] time coming.
[2:00:37] Hallelujah. That's a prophecy. There's
[2:00:40] another holy time coming. Holy
[2:00:42] convocation unto you. And you shall make
[2:00:44] an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
[2:00:46] It is a solemn assembly. You shall do no
[2:00:48] survile work therein. Hallelujah. The
[2:00:51] eighth day what? Back to the first day.
[2:00:54] Sunday. Seven days. Come back to what?
[2:00:57] Back to Sunday. Sunday is the seventh
[2:00:59] day or the eighth day. The first day or
[2:01:01] the eighth day. Isn't that right? So God
[2:01:03] have seven. And when it go over to the
[2:01:05] next number is 8, but it's also back to
[2:01:07] the first. Amen. Isn't that right? Now
[2:01:10] it was the eighth day, the last day of
[2:01:12] the feast of the tabernacle. Notice
[2:01:17] after the last church age, after the
[2:01:19] last complete seven days upon the earth,
[2:01:22] after the millennium, then this
[2:01:24] convocation come the new earth. He has
[2:01:27] already went to prepare a place. It's
[2:01:28] built a holy convocation. The eighth day
[2:01:31] which is only seven days. Then on the
[2:01:33] eighth day, which come back to the first
[2:01:35] day, the eth day is a holy convocation.
[2:01:38] So the prophet is revealing something
[2:01:39] here. Let's continue. Are you with me?
[2:01:41] Amen. The Sabbath speaks of the old law.
[2:01:44] Keeping the Sabbath which passed away
[2:01:46] changed to another. Watch. Precept must
[2:01:48] be upon precept. You enter into life.
[2:01:51] You are not keeping a day or a shadow.
[2:01:55] You have passed from death unto life,
[2:01:58] not days and times. You are passed unto
[2:02:00] unto eternity. So he's saying this holy
[2:02:03] convocation is the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:06] Ghost. Amen. That takes you out of time
[2:02:09] and put you as a creature of eternity.
[2:02:11] Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Eight
[2:02:13] deals with new creation, not old
[2:02:16] creation. 8 days is new creation. It was
[2:02:19] the eighth day that our Lord raised from
[2:02:20] the dead. Amen. Isn't that right? There
[2:02:23] is your holy convocation. It is not
[2:02:25] Sabbaths. It is not all this feast of
[2:02:27] the tabernacle, feast at this, feast at
[2:02:29] that. Jesus raised from the dead and so
[2:02:30] forth. You have done all passed through
[2:02:32] time. You're dropping into eternity
[2:02:33] again. Not keeping of days, keeping of
[2:02:36] Sabbaths, new moons, but had passed,
[2:02:39] changed form, but passed from death unto
[2:02:42] life. Notice, not seven days to do with
[2:02:46] anything at all. Notice after 50 days or
[2:02:48] seven Sabbaths from there, there comes
[2:02:50] another holy convocation. What happened?
[2:02:52] The Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[2:02:54] Pentecost. Oh yes. On the eighth day,
[2:02:56] rather on on the eighth day was seven
[2:02:58] Sabbaths. So therefore, the Holy Ghost
[2:03:00] fell on the day of Pentecost. Amen.
[2:03:02] Sunday. Isn't that right? the eighth
[2:03:03] day. Isn't that right? So, it been seven
[2:03:06] times. Bring it right back around to the
[2:03:07] first day of the week again. So, watch.
[2:03:09] There is your holy congregation. What it
[2:03:11] is? The Holy Ghost. Amen. Breaking upon
[2:03:14] your soul. Bringing you into a new
[2:03:16] creation. That's the eighth day.
[2:03:18] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:20] There is your holy convocation. Listen.
[2:03:22] Not have nothing to do with literal
[2:03:24] thing. It is beyond that. Amen. It is
[2:03:27] into the kingdom of God with eternal
[2:03:29] life. Hallelujah. Like the predestinated
[2:03:31] that never did start.
[2:03:32] It never started on any day. You and
[2:03:35] Lisb, you was never saved on any day.
[2:03:39] You was always saved.
[2:03:47] Jesus has come to redeem that. But you
[2:03:50] were saved from the beginning because
[2:03:53] you had eternal life to begin with. You
[2:03:56] had that attribute gene thought of God
[2:03:58] inside of you. That's why you find
[2:04:00] yourself believing the word. receiving
[2:04:02] the word, you are always saved.
[2:04:06] Hallelujah.
[2:04:09] Oh my, I feel like running right now.
[2:04:11] Just a little more again. Hallelujah.
[2:04:12] Oh, hallelujah. The woman at the well,
[2:04:15] Jesus knew she was a seed.
[2:04:19] So, he had no fight with all what she
[2:04:20] had been through. He didn't come to ask
[2:04:23] a question and fill out a form.
[2:04:26] Hallelujah. A sin form, a complaint
[2:04:28] form, all what you do form. He didn't
[2:04:31] come for that. He come to show her a
[2:04:33] higher order. He come to show her where
[2:04:36] she come from. He come to show her she
[2:04:39] belong to better than that. She worth
[2:04:42] more than that.
[2:04:43] [Applause]
[2:04:45] And when Jesus finished with her, she
[2:04:47] said, "Come see a man who told me all
[2:04:50] what I did." Isn't this the Christ? And
[2:04:53] them religious people in Benzub.
[2:04:56] But this woman,
[2:04:58] hallelujah, she's saying the grace.
[2:05:03] Hallelujah.
[2:05:05] Hallelujah. You may be seated. Shall we
[2:05:08] live through all these types? Oh my.
[2:05:11] Amen. Amen. All these seven types. But
[2:05:13] when you hit eight, you go to eternity.
[2:05:17] Are you ready? You don't go by by laws.
[2:05:19] You go by rituals. You go by orders.
[2:05:22] Like you had to wear a a part in the
[2:05:24] middle of your head and look like a
[2:05:24] brandite or look like how everybody else
[2:05:26] is looking or so and so on. Unless you
[2:05:28] don't look so you're not in the message.
[2:05:30] That's foolishness.
[2:05:32] Amen.
[2:05:35] But Ram said I could talk to somebody in
[2:05:36] 5 minutes and know if they're Christian
[2:05:39] much you could ra in 5 minutes. Much
[2:05:41] doctrine a man could talk in 5 minutes.
[2:05:43] People come with the platform. Baram
[2:05:45] said uh are you a Christian? He feel the
[2:05:47] spirit.
[2:05:52] Why? Why didn't the devil know who you
[2:05:53] are? Because what he sees.
[2:05:58] If the devil not troubling you, you in
[2:06:00] trouble. Hallelujah.
[2:06:02] He has seen nothing.
[2:06:05] Hallelujah. You don't see people pelting
[2:06:07] at empty trees that ping at leaf.
[2:06:11] If you see somebody ping a tree, have no
[2:06:12] fruit on it.
[2:06:16] Come on, Dennis.
[2:06:18] But if you see a tree of fruit, if
[2:06:19] somebody pelt it, look for the fruit,
[2:06:22] the devil see something inside you, want
[2:06:24] to out, you see a light. And that's why
[2:06:26] he said all them demons trying to out
[2:06:27] your light. You don't even know what
[2:06:29] light inside of you toward you.
[2:06:35] Wake
[2:06:36] up. Wake up.
[2:06:39] Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] So watch. You don't come by laws,
[2:06:46] rituals, order. You come by
[2:06:48] predestination. There is the genuine
[2:06:51] holy convocation. We are ending the
[2:06:53] seventh year age. We are entering that
[2:06:56] holy convocation. We are entering into
[2:06:58] that real genuine eternity where the
[2:07:02] church is called. Not to some station,
[2:07:04] not to some denomination, but into
[2:07:07] eternity. That's why it has upset me
[2:07:10] when ministers point the people to
[2:07:11] themselves or their churches or their
[2:07:13] groups because that is not the
[2:07:14] destination. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We
[2:07:17] go into eternity. Amen.
[2:07:20] Amen.
[2:07:22] G. You have passed into eternity. Where
[2:07:25] you come from, you was there to begin
[2:07:27] with.
[2:07:28] [Applause]
[2:07:30] You're going back to where you come
[2:07:32] from.
[2:07:33] I didn't hear you. I ain't hear them
[2:07:36] shouting out here.
[2:07:38] Where you come from is where you're
[2:07:39] going. You're going from where you come
[2:07:41] from.
[2:07:46] [Applause]
[2:07:49] The Holy Ghost is eternal. Then you are
[2:07:52] in eternity. When you was all the time,
[2:07:55] where you was all the time, but you just
[2:07:57] recognize what happened. You were made
[2:08:00] for eternal purpose because you was the
[2:08:02] manifestation of the attribute that was
[2:08:05] in God.
[2:08:06] Amen. That thought of you and expressed
[2:08:09] you. He made an earth to take you out of
[2:08:12] to make you a human being. He gave you a
[2:08:15] body called time.
[2:08:17] [Music]
[2:08:17] [Applause]
[2:08:19] There's a time body. But at the last
[2:08:21] trump, the trump of God shall sound
[2:08:25] telling Christ shall rise. We shall be
[2:08:28] changed.
[2:08:31] [Applause]
[2:08:38] That is why Jesus could talk about
[2:08:40] Lazarus said he sleepeth and I go wake
[2:08:43] him. Not even death could stop him. He
[2:08:46] said I go wake him because I understand
[2:08:48] in that dimension that's a temporary
[2:08:51] hold.
[2:08:52] Oh glory to God. Then death become a
[2:08:55] chariot to take God's saints into glory.
[2:08:59] A chariot to hitch a ride over. You have
[2:09:01] to take off this carcass, spin around to
[2:09:04] go into your theophony, waiting for that
[2:09:07] physical body, resurrection voice,
[2:09:10] waiting for a church to come to
[2:09:11] perfection to bring on the resurrection.
[2:09:14] You are not a creature of time. You
[2:09:17] become a creature of eternity.
[2:09:19] [Applause]
[2:09:22] Oh, glory to God. You may be seated.
[2:09:25] Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:09:27] Don't worry. Tomorrow the holiday.
[2:09:32] Hallelujah. They don't want they don't
[2:09:34] want to say amen. Amen. But and I ain't
[2:09:36] about it with you, you know. You're not
[2:09:38] short of me at all. Praise God. This is
[2:09:41] rich. This is real. I was astonished
[2:09:43] when I was studying this. It blow me all
[2:09:46] out. I recognize we coming down here to
[2:09:48] the end. Oh, glory to God. How every
[2:09:51] feast is in order. The trumpet is about
[2:09:54] to sound. Moses and Elijah already on
[2:09:56] the earth somewhere to go to the Jews.
[2:09:58] And if that be so, the Bible said, "I
[2:10:00] saw another mighty angel ascending from
[2:10:03] the east having the seal of the living
[2:10:05] God." He said, "Seal all
[2:10:07] those
[2:10:09] 144,000." But before those Jews could be
[2:10:11] sealed, there's a gentile bride have to
[2:10:15] be sealed. And Jesus said, "If any man
[2:10:19] test
[2:10:20] [Applause]
[2:10:21] [Music]
[2:10:22] [Applause]
[2:10:27] Oh, glory. Hallelujah. My Let me say it
[2:10:31] again." Amen. You were made for an
[2:10:34] eternal purpose. Hallelujah. Because you
[2:10:36] was the manifestation of the attribute
[2:10:38] that was in God that thought of you and
[2:10:41] expressed you. He made a earth to take
[2:10:44] you out of to make you a human being.
[2:10:46] Hallelujah. Sin come along and perverted
[2:10:49] his way. You come anyhow. You was lost
[2:10:52] with the world. So he come to redeem
[2:10:53] you. The express attribute and redeem
[2:10:57] the earth the same way. Amen. The earth
[2:10:59] get water on Noah's day. It's not that
[2:11:02] in a flood and drunk Noah and drunk the
[2:11:03] earth. The mystery behind that the earth
[2:11:06] was baptized
[2:11:08] like my sister here going to get
[2:11:09] baptized. Young lady going to get
[2:11:10] baptized in it. The earth was baptized
[2:11:12] in water. Then Jesus blood drop on it.
[2:11:16] Satan don't even understand what's
[2:11:17] happening. The earth has been redeemed.
[2:11:20] And then he promised fire. The righteous
[2:11:22] shall walk on the ashes of the wicked.
[2:11:24] Fire coming on the earth. And what God
[2:11:26] does to you? He redeems you by water by
[2:11:29] blood and then fire and one more fire.
[2:11:33] The fire that changes mortal into
[2:11:35] mortality. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:11:39] Watch Ephesians 1:10 call it a
[2:11:42] dispensation. Not the seventh day. It is
[2:11:45] called the fullness of time. When the
[2:11:48] fullness of time has come, when time has
[2:11:51] been fulfilled, there is no more time.
[2:11:53] Then you go into eternity. Revelation
[2:11:55] 10, what the angel says, time shall be
[2:11:58] no longer. Seven thunders, time shall be
[2:12:01] no more. Amen. Time no longer. A
[2:12:03] prophecy that time is about finished.
[2:12:06] Amen. We are running out of time,
[2:12:07] friends. Amen. Oh hallelujah. Oh glory
[2:12:10] to God. Praise God. So after the world
[2:12:13] is on fire and baptized, it's the
[2:12:15] baptism world on fire from heaven. All
[2:12:18] sin is gone. All germs gone. All devil's
[2:12:21] gone. All temptations gone. Evil gone.
[2:12:23] Isn't that right? What does God do? He
[2:12:25] can sit upon the earth because all sin
[2:12:28] is gone. That's the same thing he does
[2:12:30] when he gives you the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:31] Baptism with fire. He can come and dwell
[2:12:33] in you and sit in heavenly places.
[2:12:36] Watch. You get it? Now the fullness of
[2:12:38] time has come after time has been
[2:12:40] fulfilled. Sin is gone. After the
[2:12:43] world's baptism, it's in a fifth place.
[2:12:45] No sickness, no germs, no taunts, no
[2:12:47] tissles, no death, no sorrow, no
[2:12:49] heartaches, no old age. Nothing to
[2:12:51] represent. Hallelujah. Amen. That mean
[2:12:54] all the gray hair going back.
[2:12:56] Hallelujah. All the wrinkle face going
[2:12:58] back smooth. Amen. Missing teeth being
[2:13:00] restored.
[2:13:02] Hallelujah. Everything going back to
[2:13:03] normal. Amen. Looking like a 19year-old.
[2:13:06] Everybody smiling now. Look at they want
[2:13:08] to go back right now. I with you on
[2:13:11] that. I'm with you. I'm with you. Oh,
[2:13:14] hallelujah.
[2:13:16] I want to go back to you now. Cuz
[2:13:18] sometimes this this this mechanics
[2:13:20] doesn't be working so well. Oh,
[2:13:23] hallelujah. This equipment has
[2:13:24] malfunction. Praise God. Spark plug
[2:13:28] sometimes that not cracking up. Oh,
[2:13:30] praise the name of the Lord. Here we go.
[2:13:33] You're eternal. You have crossed from
[2:13:35] seventh day into the eighth. Amen. You
[2:13:38] have got eternal life by the baptism of
[2:13:41] the Holy Spirit. Amen. Included in this.
[2:13:44] Oh, praise God. This is the eternal. The
[2:13:47] feast after the feast of the
[2:13:48] tabernacles. Oh, glory. This is the
[2:13:50] eighth day. The tabernacle feast was for
[2:13:53] seven days, but in 8th day, holy
[2:13:54] convocation. Oh, praise the name of the
[2:13:57] Lord. I'm on the home church here now.
[2:14:00] St. John
[2:14:02] 1:39. St. John 1 chapter 7 rather verse
[2:14:06] one I I'll read it you don't find it
[2:14:08] after these things Jesus walked in
[2:14:10] Galilee as he would not walk in jewelry
[2:14:13] because the Jews sought to kill him
[2:14:18] now the Jews feast of tabernacles was at
[2:14:20] hand feast of the tabernacles was at
[2:14:23] hand his brethren therefore said unto
[2:14:25] him hence go into Judea that the
[2:14:28] disciples also may see the works that
[2:14:30] thou doest for there is no man that
[2:14:32] doeth anything in secret that he himself
[2:14:34] seeketh to be known openly. If thou do
[2:14:36] these things, show thyself to the world.
[2:14:39] For neither did his brethren believe in
[2:14:40] him. Let's continue. Then Jesus said
[2:14:44] unto them, my time is not yet come.
[2:14:46] Amen. But your time is always ready. The
[2:14:49] world cannot hate you hate you, but me
[2:14:52] it hateth because I testify of it that
[2:14:55] the works thereof are evil. Go ye up to
[2:14:57] this feast.
[2:14:59] I go not up yet unto the feast, for my
[2:15:03] time is not yet come.
[2:15:05] So when he had said these words unto
[2:15:07] them, he abode still in Galilee. But
[2:15:09] when his bre was gone up, then went he
[2:15:12] up to the feast. Amen. Not openly, but
[2:15:14] in secret. So Jesus said him, "Go up. I
[2:15:17] ain't going up yet." And he sent them.
[2:15:20] Then he slipping there
[2:15:21] secretly. And the Jews sought him at the
[2:15:25] feast saying, "Where is he?" Because
[2:15:26] Jesus is like a controversial figure. So
[2:15:29] he had to be somewhere around. So where
[2:15:31] is he? And there was a murmuring among
[2:15:33] the people concerning him that some said
[2:15:35] he's a good man and said nay he
[2:15:36] deceiveth the people. How be it no man
[2:15:38] speak openly of him. So people shuing
[2:15:40] shoo for fear of the Jews. Now about the
[2:15:43] midst of the feast Jesus went into the
[2:15:45] temple and taught in the midst of the
[2:15:48] feast. He's teaching the dudes marvelous
[2:15:51] saying how this man let us have never
[2:15:54] learned. My Lord, my Jesus say, "My
[2:15:57] doctrine is not mine, but him that sent
[2:15:59] me." Amen. If any man will do his will,
[2:16:02] he shall know of the doctrine. Whether
[2:16:05] it's be of God, or whether I speak of
[2:16:07] myself. Amen. He that speaketh of
[2:16:08] himself seeketh his own glory, but he
[2:16:10] that seeketh his glory that sent him.
[2:16:12] The same is true. Amen. And no
[2:16:15] unrighteousness is in him. So, I'm going
[2:16:17] to skip down. And Jesus say, if a man on
[2:16:20] the Sabbath day receives circumcision,
[2:16:21] that the law of Moses should not be
[2:16:23] broken. Are you angry with me because I
[2:16:24] made a man every bit on the Sabbath day?
[2:16:28] Judge not according to appearance, but
[2:16:30] judge righteous judgment. I'll skip
[2:16:32] down.
[2:16:35] Hallelujah. So then said yes to them,
[2:16:36] yet a little while I'm with you. Then I
[2:16:38] will go unto him that sent me. You shall
[2:16:40] seek me. Shall not find me, but where I
[2:16:41] am, you cannot come. Then the Jews still
[2:16:44] among themselves say, Whereither will he
[2:16:46] go that we shall not find him? Will he
[2:16:48] go among the dispersed among the
[2:16:50] Gentiles and teach the Gentiles? What
[2:16:51] manner of sin is this? He shall seek me
[2:16:53] shall not find me. Tither you cannot
[2:16:55] come. Then at the last day, the great
[2:16:59] day of the feast. Hallelujah. Jesus
[2:17:02] stood and cried. If any man tests, let
[2:17:06] him come unto me and drink. He that
[2:17:08] believeth on me, as the scripture had
[2:17:10] said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[2:17:13] of living water. But this spake he of
[2:17:15] the spirit which did that believe on him
[2:17:17] should receive. for the Holy Ghost was
[2:17:20] not yet given because Jesus was not yet
[2:17:22] glorified. Amen. Oh, hallelujah. So
[2:17:26] Jesus, William Brham on the future home
[2:17:29] of the bride made a promise, isn't that
[2:17:33] right? And tied the seventh Jewish feast
[2:17:36] of the tabernacle with a promise of the
[2:17:38] Holy Spirit. Amen. That's why Jesus went
[2:17:41] at the feast of the tabernacle and said,
[2:17:43] he praise the name of the Lord. Blessed
[2:17:46] be the name of the Lord. He he come unto
[2:17:48] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[2:17:50] and drink. Hallelujah. So the Holy
[2:17:52] Spirit is for the elected 144,000 Jews
[2:17:55] as we said. Amen. And the Gentile bride.
[2:17:57] That prophecy that there's a holy time
[2:17:59] coming. That prophecy was taken from the
[2:18:02] Old Testament and connected to the New
[2:18:04] Testament. God tied the feast of the
[2:18:06] tabernacle of the Old Testament with the
[2:18:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Oh,
[2:18:11] praise the name of the Lord. Do you
[2:18:12] believe that? Amen. Praise God. I'm
[2:18:15] going to close. I'm about to close.
[2:18:18] Hallelujah. I want to talk about a
[2:18:20] ceremony they had for that day. And it's
[2:18:22] interesting why Jesus could use if any
[2:18:24] man thirst, let them come to me and
[2:18:26] drink. This is it. On the eighth day,
[2:18:30] they take down their boots, the the
[2:18:32] boots that they were well and so on like
[2:18:33] that. One of the ceremony was pouring
[2:18:36] out some water from the pool of Silon.
[2:18:38] As we come to the end of this feast
[2:18:39] period to the last festival of God in
[2:18:42] the calendar year, the Jews, the priests
[2:18:45] would go down to the pool of Silom in a
[2:18:47] religious procession with large water
[2:18:50] jugs. And there at the pool, they would
[2:18:52] fill the water jugs, walk up the steps
[2:18:55] leading to the temple mount
[2:18:57] commemorating the long anticipating
[2:18:59] promise of Messiah. Nice. And in that
[2:19:01] day, you will say, "Lord, I will praise
[2:19:03] you. Though you were angry with me, your
[2:19:06] anger is turned away and you comfort me.
[2:19:08] Behold, God is my salvation. I will
[2:19:11] trust and be not afraid. The Lord is my
[2:19:13] strength and my salvation. Oh,
[2:19:16] hallelujah. Glory. Praise and become my
[2:19:19] salvation. The stone which the bill has
[2:19:20] refused. They were singing these psalms
[2:19:23] from Psalms 113 to 118. And that blow me
[2:19:26] out that they were singing the stone the
[2:19:28] billers refused has become the headstone
[2:19:30] of the corner. Amen. And they'll be
[2:19:31] rejoicing as the water is coming out.
[2:19:33] Isn't that right? As the priests
[2:19:35] approached the water jugs, the people
[2:19:37] would start singing the halal psalms.
[2:19:39] They call them. It is interesting to
[2:19:41] know that on this day they sang the
[2:19:43] marvelous hal psalm of praise which
[2:19:46] concluded with psalms
[2:19:48] 118:22 and you have become my salvation
[2:19:52] and the stone which the builders re
[2:19:54] rejected has become the headstone of the
[2:19:56] corner. And the people were praising the
[2:19:58] Lord. They would pour all these water
[2:20:00] jugs on the pavement reminding them how
[2:20:03] God miraculous provided water in the
[2:20:05] wilderness from the rock. So this is
[2:20:07] what is and the people they said you'll
[2:20:10] never see rejoicing like that when it's
[2:20:11] happening because water used to be
[2:20:13] scarce and they know that water
[2:20:15] symbolized the pouring of the Holy
[2:20:16] Ghost. So the people will be rejoicing
[2:20:18] and rejoicing on the eighth day.
[2:20:21] Okay, it was I'll just skip over on the
[2:20:23] last day that day of the feast Jesus
[2:20:26] stood and cried if any man thirst let
[2:20:27] him come and drink. Glory. Oh, praise
[2:20:29] the name of the Lord. Praise God. Oh,
[2:20:33] just give him some praises. Hallelujah.
[2:20:35] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord
[2:20:39] Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[2:20:43] God. So Jesus waited for the climax of
[2:20:46] the whole celebration to make that
[2:20:48] pronouncement. If any man thirst, let
[2:20:50] him come unto me and drink. Amen. Oh,
[2:20:52] praise God. Let's just stand and worship
[2:20:54] the Lord right now. Are you thirsty?
[2:20:56] Hallelujah. Are you hungering for God?
[2:20:58] If you are not, I want to invite you to
[2:21:02] ask God to create in you a hungering and
[2:21:04] a thirsting for him. Hungering and
[2:21:07] thirsting for the Holy Spirit. Just
[2:21:09] worship the Lord right now. Oh, blessed
[2:21:11] be the name of the Lord. The 8th day
[2:21:14] Holy convocation. What is it? Is your
[2:21:16] appointment of the Holy Ghost bringing
[2:21:18] you from time into eternity. Amen. You
[2:21:20] have to need it. You have to want it.
[2:21:23] You have to hunger for it. The prophet
[2:21:25] spoke about praise be to Jesus. Oh those
[2:21:30] that sigh and cry. Seal all those put a
[2:21:34] mark upon those that sigh and cry. Oh
[2:21:38] praise be to Jesus. Oh hal something
[2:21:41] softly. Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus.
[2:21:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise
[2:21:46] the name of the Lord. Praise the name of
[2:21:48] the Lord.
[2:21:49] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:21:53] Jesus.
[2:21:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[2:21:58] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:22:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:22:02] Hallelujah.

[2:22:15] morning?

[2:22:22] Ghost. Just for breakthrough.
