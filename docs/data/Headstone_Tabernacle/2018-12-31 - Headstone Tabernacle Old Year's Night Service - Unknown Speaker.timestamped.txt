[23:46] praise God 1st Corinthians chapter 6
[23:50] verses 9 to 11
[23:54] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[23:57] not inherit the kingdom of God be not
[24:01] deceived neither fornicators nor

[25:18] sinless Bride of Christ amen
[25:23] praise God now whatever we do as
[25:27] Christians whatever we achieve can only
[25:31] be done through faith and faith is a
[25:35] revelation because faith has been
[25:38] revealed to you can we say amen amen
[25:42] so without faith is impossible to even
[25:44] please God amen
[25:46] and Cain was very religious he built
[25:51] altars
[25:51] he offered sacrifices he paints tides he
[25:56] went to church he did everything that
[25:59] any other religious man would do he was
[26:02] sincere but Cain locked revelation he
[26:07] lacked faith in God so he could not
[26:09] please God no matter how what he did or
[26:13] how hard he tried my revelation of the
[26:18] word which is God is the only thing that
[26:22] God honors can we say men tonight it's
[26:25] the only thing that will stand true
[26:27] revelation divine revelation amen
[26:30] and Jesus said upon this rock of
[26:32] Revelation I will build my church and
[26:35] the gates of hell can never prevail
[26:38] against it a man of Florida Gori man
[26:41] hallelujah Hell itself will come against
[26:44] you
[26:44] two hundred thousand thousand Devils are
[26:48] loosed against you a man but they are
[26:50] not going to prevail over you tonight
[26:53] hallelujah glory to God they can prevail
[26:57] tonight cannot prevail tonight because
[27:00] on Christ the solid rock I stand
[27:02] hallelujah can we say man tonight

[27:10] tonight he meant no matter what you do
[27:12] you pray for divine revelation amen
[27:14] praise God
[27:16] so 1st Corinthians 6 we read it these
[27:20] adult reside on us fornicators fruits of
[27:24] the flesh tires and rock biters whatever
[27:27] it is we were born into this world and
[27:30] given a human nature by our first
[27:34] parents through a natural birth can we
[27:37] say man and with this human nature our
[27:40] desires were to do the things of this
[27:42] world you don't have to teach the 300
[27:45] how to tell lies amen
[27:49] it's just in him amen that's the human
[27:52] nature we come into this world speaking
[27:54] lies hallelujah so there's a law of
[27:57] nature within our members pushing us to
[28:01] do evil things oh god help us tonight a
[28:03] man hallelujah but inside of man there's
[28:08] a thirst a deep crying out for God can
[28:12] we say man tonight hallelujah so here's
[28:15] God's Word through a preacher and he
[28:17] accepts the Lord he gets saved but the
[28:21] old Connor Adamic nature is still there

[28:29] from the message you approach to God
[28:31] polishing up join in church reading a
[28:36] lot of books don't mean that you're

[28:51] hallelujah you might go to church often
[28:55] you might put your name on a book praise
[28:58] God you are still out of the line with
[29:00] God because that all
[29:03] no.13 nature of the world is telling you
[29:06] say man tonight
[29:08] hallelujah take a lamb feeding on grass
[29:12] and a pig eating slop if you take the
[29:16] pig and polish him up and reform him and

[29:23] within a short space of time you will
[29:26] run right back to his wallow and slop
[29:29] praise God amen right doctors always a
[29:32] man my the only way to get the pig to
[29:37] change permanently from eating slop to
[29:40] eating grass is to take out the pic
[29:43] nature hallelujah and then take the
[29:47] nature of the lamb and put it inside of
[29:49] the pig or chlorine of God tonight a man
[29:51] in other words the pig must get a change

[30:03] years since yeah you be applied but
[30:05] still not a Christian the picnic is
[30:09] still in there amen
[30:10] Paul said when I want to do good evil is
[30:14] present with me deep down inside of me I
[30:17] delight in the law of God but my human
[30:20] nature is warring against the deep
[30:22] inside of me Paul cried out o wretched
[30:26] man that I am Who Shall deliver me from
[30:29] this body of death amen and maybe
[30:34] tonight some brother some sisters crying

[31:38] still not converted a man this is
[31:41] serious now a man hallelujah a man

[1:19:54] said my days I guessing many now
[1:19:56] soon I'll be 5200 cells from 1960 I said
[1:20:00] lord I want to be faithful I want to be
[1:20:02] true to the end around the world many
[1:20:05] nations many peoples colours races and
[1:20:08] many creeds and things see how they're
[1:20:10] mixed up and they all in different
[1:20:12] little fusses and frustrations when in
[1:20:14] those places
[1:20:15] there's many true children mixed up in
[1:20:19] all fluster issues and things but there
[1:20:21] are two children and their true seed in
[1:20:23] it crying out for a reality in this
[1:20:26] message through seed that will do real
[1:20:31] revival that are praying for something
[1:20:34] that come from the law
[1:20:36] Harlan Lee the Prophet said he knew it
[1:20:37] for fact something is coming forth from
[1:20:39] the law and there's true seed out there
[1:20:42] looking for revival prophecy a said he
[1:20:46] said many children women in these places
[1:20:48] or in the hybrid fielding that truly
[1:20:52] don't want to be there they think
[1:20:54] they're doing God's will he said but I
[1:20:57] pray thee father this morning the take
[1:20:59] away all doubts from my little group
[1:21:01] here today I repeated God take away all
[1:21:03] dirt out here tonight
[1:21:04] know and from the rules who be listening
[1:21:07] on the tapes of sword take away all a
[1:21:09] man-made creeds and as Jesus when he
[1:21:12] came the first time he found them
[1:21:13] teaching things that wasn't sold from
[1:21:15] the beginning from the beginning so
[1:21:17] while God made it pure and unadulterated
[1:21:20] but man had take God's Word and made it
[1:21:23] of none effect by teaching the Creed of
[1:21:26] man and father so it is now and at the
[1:21:30] ner of coming of Jesus again see he said
[1:21:33] just like a vine that the bank puts was
[1:21:34] a branch on that branch was a
[1:21:36] Pentecostal branch filled with the Holy
[1:21:38] Ghost and signs and wonders the fruits
[1:21:41] followed that branch isn't alright
[1:21:44] because it was up pure branch is now he
[1:21:47] said if that vine ever puts forth
[1:21:49] another branch it'll be the same kind of
[1:21:53] branch we know that father by nature
[1:21:56] itself we know that if it graph any
[1:21:58] fruit is pretending to into that vine
[1:22:00] it'll it by the vine see and we know
[1:22:02] that we can take an orange tree grow
[1:22:04] citrus fruits of different kinds 7:08 we
[1:22:06] can put lemons on it isn't that right I
[1:22:08] don't go true citrus fruits it'll grow
[1:22:10] grapefruit it'll grow any kind of other
[1:22:11] tangerine it'll run any other citrus
[1:22:14] fruit but if that tree brings forth its
[1:22:16] own branch again it'll be an orange he
[1:22:20] said Lord it would be like the first one
[1:22:22] was the property here is now he said and
[1:22:25] we believe that there is to be a church
[1:22:27] and these last days that will receive
[1:22:31] Pope for monitoring the world in this
[1:22:37] laude CH right here we're living there
[1:22:40] be another true church
[1:22:43] in it here's what he says it'll be a
[1:22:45] church that's called back to the
[1:22:47] original painting car
[1:22:49] it'll profit it'll be a church that I
[1:22:51] have Jesus Christ walking in it you mean
[1:22:58] that's gonna come a time when that same
[1:23:00] Jesus it's gonna be walking and fail in
[1:23:03] a church brother I want to see that kind
[1:23:06] of church I believe tonight we are

[1:23:40] will be deliver again if the signals
[1:23:43] heal then they will be healed now
[1:23:45] they've got to because it's the same
[1:23:48] Jesus doing the same things he did in
[1:23:51] the Apostles in the Bible we talk about
[1:24:02] heroes of faith we talk about Joseph
[1:24:03] Wright we talk about Joshua Wright we

[1:38:13] so it's just a few minutes to go I'm
[1:38:16] here through the countdown you already
[1:38:19] had the preachers preach your appreciate
[1:38:21] but it's evil Oliveri
[1:38:22] your precept our hands in your Brian a
[1:38:26] man so just for a quick thought just to
[1:38:29] bring the countdown if you tell them
[1:38:31] quickly with me to two portions of
[1:38:33] scripture I want to get that out and
[1:38:36] then have a few comments and when every
[1:38:39] from Hebrews 10 just Hebrews 10 just one
[1:38:45] verse of scripture in there
[1:38:52] and reading from Ephesians six we read
[1:38:56] from Ephesians first actually Ephesians
[1:38:59] six and verse 10 finally my brethren be
[1:39:02] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:39:04] his might put on the whole armour of God
[1:39:07] that he may be able to stand against the
[1:39:09] wiles of the devil
[1:39:11] Ephesians six reading verse from verse
[1:39:14] 12 now for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:39:16] and blood but against principalities
[1:39:17] against powers against the rulers of the
[1:39:21] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:39:23] wickedness in high places
[1:39:25] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:39:27] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:39:29] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:39:32] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:39:35] good about with truth and having on the
[1:39:37] breastplate of righteousness and your
[1:39:39] feet shod with the preparation of the
[1:39:41] gospel of peace above all taking the
[1:39:43] shield of faith wherewith ye shall be
[1:39:46] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:39:48] the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:39:50] salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[1:39:52] which is the word of God I'm reading
[1:39:55] Hebrews 10 and verse 35 cast not away
[1:39:58] therefore your confidence which had
[1:40:01] great recompense of reward be the Lord
[1:40:04] and a blessing to the reading of his
[1:40:05] work and we bow our heads over the frail
[1:40:07] heavenly founder your word has been
[1:40:10] preached to us tonight Lord with power
[1:40:12] with demonstration and clarity the way
[1:40:15] your prophet would want it to be

[1:44:01] or talk
[1:44:02] I began gasping for breath my daughter
[1:44:05] took me to the sangre granny hospital
[1:44:07] and he put me on a stretcher to lie down
[1:44:10] for observation all my organs had
[1:44:13] started to shut down and the doctor told
[1:44:15] my daughter that most likely I was going
[1:44:17] today he told her and I had a major and
[1:44:21] very severe heart attack and that I had
[1:44:23] to be transferred to the section for
[1:44:25] patient that were in a very bad state
[1:44:27] the hospital had a lot of patients and
[1:44:30] was overcrowded so it happened that I

[1:44:35] minutes after 15 minutes the doctor
[1:44:37] passed by again and examined me he was
[1:44:40] in awe he told my daughter this is a man
[1:44:43] of God he said God likes this man

[1:46:46] pyramid of your lives be kept made a
[1:46:49] chains that have held you for how long

[1:46:53] season may the sickness and the baggage
[1:46:56] that you have carried be dropped off in
[1:46:58] 2018 and not reached 2019 and may be
[1:47:02] that the Egyptians you have seen for all
[1:47:04] your years because they would have seen
[1:47:06] the Egyptians for a long time but this
[1:47:08] day Moses said you will see them no more
[1:47:10] forever can the church shame and so I
[1:47:14] have a small fort and I'm gonna try to
[1:47:16] get it done in a few minutes and we
[1:47:18] cross the new year with this thought and
[1:47:19] by the gorge I have to admit you helped
[1:47:21] inspire the thought and the thought is
[1:47:24] connected to Ephesians having done all
[1:47:26] to stand the stand so I took a text
[1:47:30] tonight still standing still standing
[1:47:36] after I went through all I went to I'm
[1:47:39] still standing after I lost health I'm
[1:47:43] still standing after I made this mistake
[1:47:46] that mistake the devil thought he had me
[1:47:48] out I'm still standing when they thought
[1:47:51] I would backslide and never come back to
[1:47:52] church I'm still standing when they
[1:47:54] thought that the devil had me and
[1:47:56] nothing would freak me out or what I was
[1:47:58] in I'm still standing I'm not where I'm
[1:48:01] supposed to be but I'm not where I used
[1:48:03] to be but by the grace of God at the end
[1:48:05] of 2018 I'm still standing oh can the
[1:48:09] church shame him oh and that has been
[1:48:13] the testimony you may be seated of
[1:48:15] every hero that better Anthony spoke
[1:48:18] about Paul was shipwrecked but when he
[1:48:20] wrote this he was still standing he had
[1:48:23] been bitten by the Sun's up
[1:48:24] but even though he had been bitten the
[1:48:27] poison of the supper
[1:48:28] cut
[1:48:29] stop him he was still standing there
[1:48:31] boya-chan in oil and when they turned
[1:48:34] the oil off and tony was dead he walked
[1:48:36] out of here he was still standing and
[1:48:39] whatever trial situation problem
[1:48:42] persecution nothing past present takes
[1:48:45] to come could knock you down and even if
[1:48:49] you fall you will still get strength to
[1:48:52] struggle back up and looked at devil in
[1:48:55] the face and say Satan I'm still
[1:48:57] standing I'm standing on the promise of
[1:49:00] God I'm standing on Malachi fourth
[1:49:03] message understanding you may be seated
[1:49:09] just a few more minutes told you already
[1:49:13] that the preaching I'm just giving you
[1:49:14] new year greetings job lost everything
[1:49:18] he lost his children he lost his money
[1:49:21] he lost his property he lost his own
[1:49:24] health and at the end of the day he was
[1:49:26] still standing the Hebrew boys it was
[1:49:28] because they were still standing they
[1:49:30] put him in the fiery furnace
[1:49:32] he would not bow down he was still
[1:49:35] standing and because they were standing
[1:49:37] they put him in the fire and in the fire
[1:49:40] they were still standing when the
[1:49:42] man ended up SIA and tonight we are
[1:49:46] still standing on the promise world has
[1:49:49] brought by the prophet of Malachi for
[1:49:52] you maybe see this for a minute
[1:49:56] anybody sleeping if tab can make sure
[1:49:59] they're not sleeping because you can't
[1:50:01] go until 2019 sleeping make sure they're
[1:50:03] not sleeping you made me see that one
[1:50:07] Tanner is a school teacher and she had a
[1:50:09] boy in the class who was giving trouble

[1:50:13] standing up to me he's in sit down he
[1:50:16] kept standing up this sit-downs kept
[1:50:18] standing up she hit him eyelashes stop
[1:50:20] Danny Lee's had a smile he was sitting
[1:50:23] on but he was smiling she said what you
[1:50:25] smiling for because I'm standing up
[1:50:27] inside so you may not have strength to
[1:50:32] stand up all the time but stand up
[1:50:35] inside is that's a prophecy you lose
[1:50:37] your teeth you come the devil you use
[1:50:40] your foot

[1:50:45] shout of praise

[1:50:57] men to get something it was about 3000
[1:51:00] or whatever to one man
[1:51:01] they thought that 3,000 men would take
[1:51:04] out Samson but when they came upon
[1:51:06] Samson Samson found a little jawbone dr.
[1:51:09] brother branham said that trouble would
[1:51:11] have collapsed if it had hit what the
[1:51:13] helmets these men had but when he
[1:51:15] annoyed he came upon Samson listen it
[1:51:18] was not his train to Adam standing but
[1:51:21] it was the Holy Ghost had him standing
[1:51:22] you have not been carrying yourself it's
[1:51:25] so Holy Ghost has been carrying you you
[1:51:29] don't have strength to carry yourself
[1:51:31] but when the Holy Ghost gets up on you
[1:51:33] you can have it all you stand you may be
[1:51:40] seated
[1:51:41] I'm about finished we're almost there
[1:51:44] listen friends that scripture is such a
[1:51:48] study having done all to stand it means
[1:51:51] when you have done everything you could
[1:51:53] do the command and stand goes beyond
[1:51:55] your ability to even stand having not
[1:51:59] all to hold it together still wanted a
[1:52:02] stand having done all to stand is that
[1:52:05] point when you want to give up because
[1:52:06] you did all you could to policy and
[1:52:08] stand when the doctor said you did
[1:52:13] everything and you should know turn it
[1:52:15] in and by the mahasiddhas to see you're
[1:52:17] in a bad state but something was holding
[1:52:21] him he couldn't operate on himself he
[1:52:25] couldn't change the situation around
[1:52:27] but God was standing for him and if you
[1:52:29] stand for God he'll stand for you he has
[1:52:32] never feel he will never feel he is a
[1:52:34] God of his word he's a car of his
[1:52:37] promise
[1:52:39] hallelujah you take a little more Televi
[1:52:43] platino stop sinner
[1:52:45] you can't tell me a time there's
[1:52:47] somebody somewhere no starter jumper
[1:52:51] there's somebody somewhere knows isn't
[1:52:54] excited for 2019 I've got to be excited
[1:52:57] because I'm looking for the sick to be
[1:52:59] healed I'm looking for the blind eyes to
[1:53:01] pop open I'm looking for you to be
[1:53:03] blessed until your cup run over I'm
[1:53:05] looking for you to see the Holy Ghost
[1:53:07] all over you and the church see him give
[1:53:11] the Lord a shout afraid
[1:53:12] give the Lord a shout of praise listen
[1:53:21] friends you cannot feel because God
[1:53:25] cannot feel I'll say that again you
[1:53:28] cannot feel because God cannot feel you
[1:53:31] heard it's already tonight you are not a
[1:53:33] believer but in Stephen said that the
[1:53:35] word seed in you that's the believer
[1:53:37] that's who is saying Amen that's who's
[1:53:40] standing it's not your flesh standing
[1:53:43] but the seed in your soul you didn't
[1:53:45] even put it there
[1:53:46] your mother didn't put it here your
[1:53:48] father didn't put it here but call
[1:53:50] himself what the seed in your soul
[1:53:55] I mean that word seed is healing in that
[1:53:58] word seed is deliverance in that word
[1:54:02] serious power in that would see this
[1:54:05] dynamics in that word seed are the
[1:54:07] attributes of God that will be made
[1:54:10] manifest in your life the devil is in
[1:54:13] trouble turn to your neighbor and tell
[1:54:15] them the devil is in trouble because you
[1:54:23] belong to God the devil is in trouble
[1:54:26] because you don't belong to the devil
[1:54:28] the devil is in trouble because even
[1:54:31] though you might be back slither
[1:54:32] you're still standing you see standing
[1:54:34] don't listen you can have cuts on your
[1:54:38] body understand me you can be tired and
[1:54:41] you still standing you can tie yourself
[1:54:44] to the pole and you still standing the
[1:54:47] important thing is you made it those 120
[1:54:51] disciples the immediately open he made
[1:54:55] it to the right place at the right time
[1:54:57] the Bible says they were afraid they
[1:55:01] were hiding but then all of a sudden
[1:55:03] they came a sound from heaven as of a
[1:55:06] rushing mighty wind and fill the whole
[1:55:08] house where they was setting and all we
[1:55:11] have been waiting for for all these
[1:55:12] years is to come to the Upper Room
[1:55:14] experience as tri-c's for the same Holy
[1:55:18] Ghost
[1:55:19] because when the branham's had the
[1:55:20] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:55:22] real to us as it was in the day of
[1:55:25] Pentecost I'm not preaching on new Holy
[1:55:27] Ghost I'm not pitching a new message
[1:55:29] it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:55:31] it's the same anointing it's ashame
[1:55:33] power it's the same spirit it'll make
[1:55:37] you stop your lion
[1:55:38] it'll make you forgive your brother
[1:55:39] it'll send the terror flying
[1:55:42] it'll make you lift your hand
[1:55:44] and I'll make you give God praise
[1:55:46] hallelujah listen friends I'm getting
[1:55:52] ready to close out sickness have a
[1:55:54] beginning and must have an ending don't
[1:55:57] have a beginning and must have an ending
[1:56:00] but a Branham taught us everything that
[1:56:02] had a beginning must have an ending but
[1:56:05] you never had a beginning because you
[1:56:07] are eternal you come from the eternal
[1:56:10] section of course mine so you never had
[1:56:14] a beginning
[1:56:14] you are part of Cora when God existed by
[1:56:17] himself you were there
[1:56:19] when he created the Sun you were there
[1:56:21] when he put the Oh somebody help me
[1:56:24] [Music]
[1:56:28] you may be set up set it before you know
[1:56:31] what that makes you it makes you older
[1:56:33] than the devil because you existed
[1:56:38] before the devil because you are in the
[1:56:40] eternal section of God in the back part
[1:56:43] of his mind in his thoughts as he was
[1:56:45] thinking he had you there waiting for
[1:56:49] the right season for flesh of my flesh
[1:56:51] born of my born spirit of my spirit and
[1:56:54] for all these years when you are born
[1:56:56] you're born with amnesia
[1:56:58] you're born with an identity crisis as
[1:57:01] well as even preach you wake up in a
[1:57:03] barnyard barnyard in your house wherever
[1:57:06] your host is he was upon you even if
[1:57:08] you're born any message it was a banya
[1:57:10] because you have to know who you are
[1:57:11] your identification is not peace and who
[1:57:13] your father is
[1:57:14] who your mother is or if you bought any
[1:57:16] message it has nothing to do with that
[1:57:18] but one day when you hear the Eagle call
[1:57:21] and say wait a minute
[1:57:22] have Allard rock rock music I've heard
[1:57:25] jazz music I've heard R&B music I've
[1:57:28] heard slow music but this Eagle music is
[1:57:30] different I bet in the world I've done
[1:57:33] this but this this anointing is
[1:57:35] different that's where the Anthony said
[1:57:37] this method and Hennessey this method
[1:57:40] I'm alcohol is better than drugs there's
[1:57:42] nothing like this joy there's nothing
[1:57:45] like this
[1:57:46] there's nothing like this victory
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:54] so as we get deeper into 2019 I want to
[1:57:59] encourage you to go deeper than you've
[1:58:01] ever gone before
[1:58:02] go deeper in your prayer life go deeper
[1:58:04] in your worship go deeper in your
[1:58:06] sacrifice

[1:58:12] excited about your healing if your foot
[1:58:15] has had a brightness for a long time
[1:58:16] start to move it in advance move it in
[1:58:20] advance

[1:58:25] don't hear me this morning we've already
[1:58:28] reached morning welcome to 2019 so you
[1:58:30] might as well start a practice you might
[1:58:34] as well start a practice if you have
[1:58:37] body pre inside to tell you what it
[1:58:39] means accounting don't I just making
[1:58:41] sure that you're still there because I
[1:58:43] let you know you have to go

[1:59:03] this is the year of my redeemer stop
[1:59:07] give the Lord a soda praise
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:13] I'm still standing listen I'm closing up
[1:59:18] standing not on my idea of my
[1:59:20] interpretation or my opinion but I'm
[1:59:23] standing on the promise would of malachi
[1:59:25] for this message is real it works every
[1:59:29] time if you apply it and that's a
[1:59:31] problem with us you know you're not
[1:59:32] Trinitarians when you buy something
[1:59:34] people like to start to use of an
[1:59:37] already manual people and the first
[1:59:41] thing they say it's not working
[1:59:43] they've getting device years ago before
[1:59:46] people understand what vcr was it they
[1:59:48] put it in the planting and thing and i
[1:59:50] see you not but i think i'm not working
[1:59:52] but if you really manual I see well
[1:59:54] dunes and somebody warned you do not
[1:59:56] connect this part before you do this I
[1:59:58] mean II realize you don't mess up
[2:00:00] because you choose to not really
[2:00:02] instructions on how to set up the thing
[2:00:04] correctly and that is what this Bible is
[2:00:09] you know it's a manual of instruction
[2:00:11] for how to set up your life correctly
[2:00:13] and if you follow this instruction
[2:00:15] everything will work alright if you
[2:00:18] follow this instruction every day with
[2:00:20] Jesus is sweeter than the day before if
[2:00:22] you follow this instruction everything
[2:00:25] you love you more and more and to make
[2:00:27] it more beautiful for us cross in our
[2:00:29] profits to shine light on this scripture
[2:00:32] so when you read it you really with new
[2:00:34] eyes it's not just scripture to you but
[2:00:36] you see your name the people have know
[2:00:38] their color to exploit you say well
[2:00:40] that's me that's me that's me in the
[2:00:44] world can the church say man everybody
[2:00:48] feeling fine who's ready to give the
[2:00:51] devil trouble who's ready to tear the
[2:00:54] devil's Kingdom down who's ready to lift
[2:00:56] Jesus higher who's ready to make heaven
[2:00:59] high
[2:01:00] and make hell hot you know one day one

[2:01:06] thousand years will have no tempt of it

[2:01:12] circumstance because it'll be only love
