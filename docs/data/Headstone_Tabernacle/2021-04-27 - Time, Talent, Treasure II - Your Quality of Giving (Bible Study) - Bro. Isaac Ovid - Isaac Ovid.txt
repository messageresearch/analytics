privilege and an honor to be able to gather one more time in this way in this season for this bible study and this time of reflection around the word of god and as a body of believers and before we open in prayer tonight um we do have uh just a few requests a few requests and and if you didn't get to send in a request and you do have a request we'll pray for that also but we do want to remember um brother joe williams aunt claire carrington are diagnosed with stage 3 cancer and we also want to remember um brother thompson's sister in toronto uh about to go into another round of chemo for cancer so we want to remember them in prayer and if there's a request tonight that you want to take to the throne of grace take it to the lord as a body of believers there's fate in this house there's faith in the church and the bible teaches us that if two shall agree touching anything we can have what we ask for so we are coming tonight and we are uniting in faith and prayer making an altar where we are being reverent having respects tonight coming back our heads heavenly father we come tonight lord lord at the beginning of another study lord where we are so grateful for you showing yourself alive to us through your word lord and teaching us from your thoughts lord the plans lord and the way you look at things that are so different from how we look at things lord and lord before we even get into that we want to lord to remember the needs of your people lord there are so many needs lord many that are spoken many that are not spoken many requests that are written not written articulated not articulated deep into the hearts of the people that some people may not even want to express but they're there and lord more importantly you know they are there and you know they exist and lord in this virtual meeting tonight lord as so many times before and even when you are here on the earth you didn't need to be physically in the room where a subject was to be able to bring relief to them lord that centurion came lord for a servant who was sick lord and lord you were able to minister in so much that that centurion had to ask the question what time was he healed so father god we know that time is no limitation for you space is no limitation for you logistics and location these things are not in limitations to you so we come tonight lord and we pray for by the jews aunt lord diagnosed with cancer we pray for brother thompson sister lord god that healing and your grace and your love and peace will come upon them that they will come to know you by revelation and by experience lord god for every person in this church in this bible study tonight who will hear the tape whatever their condition their situation their challenge at the point of time when they interact with this lord may your peace be peace your peace that surpassing all understanding drop down upon them and may you bless them abundantly may you heal seal deliver restore lord we live in dangerous times treacherous times scary times lord men's hearts failing for fear lord but you promise to not give us a spirit of fear lord we know that fear doesn't come from you so we rebuke and bind fear in the name of jesus christ we re you combine stress and uncertainty and lord all these things father knowing that we come from a different order a different place lord a different promise a different lord genetic structure and code and a heritage lord that is not from this world so may your peace cover your people may your blood cover your people may your strength cover your people may you lift the spirits and the hearts of your people to be more like you lord to see lord god what you have in store for us so we commit this bible study into your hands we commit your people into your hands lord we pray for every brother every sister lord god if there's anyone wearing me you give them strength is it there's anyone feeling they'll downl lord may you lift your people up father me you touch me you reach into homes right now and touch fathers me you touch the men lord who have such a great responsibility in such a time as dismay you touch the mothers the woman the sisters the young people the children father god may you garrison your people lord father you promise to be our shield our buckler or reward our strength lord god may you give the people the comfort to know that you are a present help in time of trouble so father we commit the bible study into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and the church says amen and amen and amen and uh before i get started tonight i um uh i really want to salute um brother joseph williams he he shared a scripture this morning and um i just felt it was such a blessing and you know when i saw it as like this is such an encouragement you know and it and um it speaks to me because he took it out of the amplified and um i love um when you see the scriptures out of the amplified because it puts it's put some shape to the words at times you know so i'll read it as it would i was as i would normally do from both the king james and then he amplified and i trust it'll be a blessing to you before we get into this bit of a teaching tonight and um also if you're not seeing somebody here in a meeting tonight feel free to send them a message um to connect to the bible study we are we want to report for duty and strength and we want to encourage one another especially now in this time more than ever and um the scripture that brother jew would have shared was taken from second corinthians four and it was verses 16 to 18 you know and um so thank you brother joe for this and uh i want to share it with the church uh second corinthians 4 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction i love that light affliction you know sometimes they don't feel light but paul says it's our light affliction which is bought for a moment well if that's not the comfort i don't know what will be a comfort to you tonight that the affliction you're going through is just for a moment work it for us a far more and more far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so that's in king james but i want to read it and this is how brother joe would have shared it as well and he amplified therefore we do not become discouraged utterly spiritless exhausted and wearied out through fear i can't tell you friends how much time i've heard the word fear and tired and discouraged and weary in the last few weeks but here it is paul is encouraging this is this is not written solely to the corinthians but this is written to me this is written to you this is written to us therefore we do not become discouraged so so so this year i want this to be an encouragement to everybody we do not become discouraged utterly spirit-less you have no spirit yeah you have no no zeal you have no your drive it is there utterly spirit-less exhausted and worried about through fear though our outer man this physical man that we know it's not like we don't know this outer man is progressively decaying and wasting away yet our inner self which is more important is being progressively renewed day after day is that your testimony that your inner self is being progressively renewed day after day whether you feel like it or not for our light momentary affliction and i mean in the fight it says this slight distress of the passing hour is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory beyond all measure excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations of vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen for the things that are visible and temporal the thing that are visible are temporal brief and fleeting but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting so we want to focus tonight i really appreciate about the joe i trust he's on the on the court tonight but that was really a blessing and i trust will be an encouragement to us tonight and i trust everybody's doing fine that you are pressing the battle amidst the trials that god in his wisdom send our way to ensure that we build the character and the disposition and the attitude and the temperament of sons who are being shaped to take over to take responsibility uh to reign on the earth and over the last few weeks god has really been gracious to us and i would have said it that we turned a corner uh remember we preached that message get into the golden altar and every service that followed have been there's a thread that's connecting it you know all about sacrifice and priesthood and we shall reign on the earth and and and and every service including sunday service and what a tremendous blessing it has all been so by the grace of god uh i want to continue from our last bible study where we would have touched on time talent and treasure and i would have entitled it to study of giving um tonight by the grace of god i want to speak on time talent and treasure 2 this is part 2 and i want to speak on equality of giving and i trust that it'll be a blessing to you that we could take a look at the scriptures and the word and see what god wants us to see um i don't intend to be too long with us tonight and uh i i'm trying to also fit in a number of things within a certain time frame um so certain things i i would have you know that me i may have wanted to share tonight um i would not be able to get it in that kind of a way but i trust that what we're able to do tonight could edify us and to reframe our perspective our approach to how we live and to how we use these three great resources we spoke about in our last bible study of our time our talent and our treasure the reality is that time as we said before is given to man a time a time beyond which we cannot pass a time that we have choice over a time that we could choose if to be in bible study or not be in bible study a time to choose if we work or play if we study or we relax time what we do with time time has results lack of time use of time failure to use time time running out time speeding up time how we look at time time talent the gifts that we are given you're not here on this earth without something to give i heard somebody say recently the fact that you are here the fact that you are alive means god is not finished with you yet so there's a talent there's something in you that god placed there that that that is there for a reason um and most people you know sadly never come to realize the purpose that god placed them on the earth and they are mel purposes a multi-layered thing because on the one hand um you could say well they want to understand your purpose in god but purpose has so all to do with your interaction with others so it's not just your purpose to god but your interaction with other people for some people their purpose so but iran would say i believe in speaking of of martin luther or one of those in the past that that his mother's purpose was to bring him to the earth i think it was john wesley or or one of them that the whole purpose she was on it was to bring wesley to the earth because he was such a critical peace in god's plan that how great of purpose was to bring him to the earth so so you have people who their purpose you know could be to touch somebody's life in a certain way it could be to to do certain things in a certain kind of you know and and you have to understand that your talent and what god gives you and how you do things is uniquely you and god doesn't want to use you like somebody else he wants to use you like you but you have to make yourself available to be used um you having a talent or a skill or a gift and not making yourself available is the same thing like almost not having it because if you're not available then god can't use you you know so time talent and treasure the resources it becomes an equation because how you use your time and your talent will typically equal your treasure somebody who works overtime it will result in a greater treasure because there's a greater compensation for working over time if you improve on your talent if you master your talent it will result in your treasure so it's all connected you know time talent and treasure very important for us to understand what god has given us access to and what we use it for not just as as citizens of this earth but as believers and what god wants for us so as we go a bit deeper um into this thing tonight um i want to start with matthew 16. um jesus's pivotal scripture in matthew 16. and then we're gonna just touch three different spots in scripture we're gonna look a bit at malachi something that malachi refers to and speaks about so and then we're gonna touch on david and then come back to jesus himself by the grace of god tonight so matthew 16 as we know is a turning point it is that discovery moment when jesus challenges his disciples who do men say that i am we are familiar with this and he gets his answers we're not teaching on that so we're gonna just go past it and then he comes to them personally all right it's one thing to know what others say but what do you say and then later on and very close to the ending of that chapter very powerful scripture matthew 16 24 then jesus said unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul powerful scripture and i want to hone in there's so much to say in this but i don't want to spend too much time on this area here but that last verse really struck me because we're dealing with giving the quality of giving and i think i said it in the last bible study that many of us in the message within the message for some reason we have some of the most selfish people sometimes you don't even realize it sometimes you don't think about it you don't consider it selfish with your time selfish with your talent and selfish with your treasure but here it is jesus is talking about what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and to lose his soul i want to read this in the amplified before i bring it so close and then jesus said to his disciples if anyone wishes to follow me as my disciple so not just follow me in any way you want to but as my disciple and disciple means disciplined one so it means in your operations your behavior you're not just following him you know the people who who follow the news they follow our entertainer they're following what's going on with the pandemic that's not the follow here that we're talking about if anybody wants to follow me this is now conditional as my disciple as my disciple now puts context of what this follow me really means because as my disciple it speaks now about discipline and i remember yeah last year we did a bible study uh speaking about the discipline of the word and having the word bring us into a conformity to be like god to be like jesus to behave the way he wants us to behave and we have been students long enough to know that we believe in a practical gospel that this thing can be a head knowledge thing or an intellectually we hear any message thing but it must be real to us that we have to have a discipline with how we live and act so it says if anyone wishes to follow me as my disciple he must deny himself which means set aside selfish interest so again i want to bear this out here when jesus is saying something it must be that a condition existed exists or will exist for him to make this statement can i say that one more time for jesus to make a statement it must be that the problem existed exists or will exist to warrant him making a statement she said if any man wants to follow me he has to deny himself and and the amplifier goes on to say this deny means to set aside selfish interests now we all have interests we all have things that we want to do for ourselves and quite honestly the vast majority of what we do for ourselves very important we are driven by self-interest you want to eat something if you don't eat or die so your self-interest would drive you to want to eat your self-interest will drive you to want to rest there are certain things you are driven to but you don't have to weigh everything you do in the context of a decision a choice a commission a command to follow jesus a certain way because not everything that you want or i want or you desire or i desire maybe in our true best interest is anybody with me all right so then jesus said to his disciples i want us to capture this again it is not anybody and anybody's talking to he is speaking to his disciples he is speaking to a very select group of people and it is almost as if he is rebuking them it almost comes across as a warning you know if anybody wants to follow me this is not the public he's speaking to this is him he's speaking to a chosen hand-picked few these people didn't volunteer they didn't sign up they didn't put in an application form they didn't apply for the job they didn't say i'll be interested in no no no this is after having spent enough time with jesus that he was comfortable to challenge their understanding of who he was and after the revelation of who he was is made clear to them he goes in deeper it's almost like he's going in to make a point now i don't understand who i am because god revealed it to peter now that it is clear to you let me let me nail this in this is this is the kind of teaching jesus is doing in matthew 16 and it's like a call to arms call to action kind of teaching and it applies to us tonight as well if you really want to follow this thing if you really want to be a christian if you really want to be a believer if you really want to make the rapture if you really want to be my disciple because ultimately these things in succession in sequence and in combination is what leads to victory as a christian right so again then jesus said to his disciples why would you say to your disciples if anybody wants to follow me and he's already his disciples so is it that jesus is looking for a deeper relationship a more consecrated relationship a more sincere kind of following because earlier in that same chapter he would realize that they were following without a fullness of revelation they were following him based on certain things but when he challenged them for their own personal testimony of why they were following and who and if they as individuals recognize who he was he recognized that they were failing the test i don't know this is helping anybody tonight i'm not into the teaching yet this is just foundation to just get that one line i just like to i'm just trying to reach it at one line but i just want to make sure the context is there because context matters most people who read scriptures take scriptures out of context so you have to put scriptures in context for it to make sense anybody with me right so then jesus said to his disciples if anyone wishes to follow me as my disciple in the amplified he must deny himself set aside selfish interest and take up his cross listen to the amplified here expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come and follow me believing in me conforming to my example in living and if need be suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in me that's all in the amplifier for whoever wishes to save his life in this world will eventually lose it through debt but whoever loses his life in this world for my sake will find it that is life without me for all eternity for what will it profit a man if he gains a whole world and it says wealth fame success but forfeits his soul or what will a man give in exchange for his soul so he's still coming back to this giving before i close off this chapter i just want to highlight this one point for what will it profit the man if he gains the whole world and the amplified says wealth fame success think about it wealth fame success what are people famous for wealth fame and success what are people famous for to this day people still talk about michelangelo leonardo da vinci shakespeare people are famous so for what what makes somebody famous isn't it how they use their time isn't it how they express their talent is that because of their treasure is there some combination of these three things is what make people famous so famous people wealthiest man on the earth forbes have their publisher list of wealthy people famous for what treasure people get prizes and awards for what for talent they could sing they can act they discover something scientists what is that is that not talent and don't you have to spend time to express these things so your time your talent and your treasure how you use it and then jesus ends that message that sermon with the question what will a man give in exchange for his soul so how much of your time will you give to ensure that your soul is in order how much of your talent will you give to ensure that you're that you are doing all you can do for the lord how much of your treasure will you give for this thing is it worth it is is it worth it is the time we spend in this room with it is your prayer life with it do you see the value of your prayer do you see the value of the effort of the sacrifice in my song light but it's connected because what shall a man give in exchange for his soul so can we go on i believe i would have touched it it was in my notes bible study if i didn't get to it but paul said i have shown you all things in acts 20 verse 35 how that soul laboring [Music] ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive and i was sharing with brother ovid and um you know i hardly thought but in just having a conversation with brother i was just sharing with him and i said it's so interesting that most people give the lord their leftovers they give their leftovers of time they give their leftovers of their talent and they give the leftovers of their treasure it's almost like if after what is important is taken care of then i can give god so only what's left then when i finish doing then i will see you know i'll i will see if i have time i will see if i have time to do something pretty long i will see if i have time or i'll see if i could if i make myself available make my skill available or if i have a resource if i have the money to do something for the lord instead of god being first god is interested in in first fruits he's interested in the first of your time the first of your talent and the first of your treasure do you really want to be someone who give god what's left that's a question tonight do you really want to be someone who give god what is left all right so i want to go our first reading to malachi 1. i know many people have never read malachi 1. but we're going to go to malachi 1 and we're going to go to uh to we're going to start from verse 6 malachi 1 and verse 6. malachi 1 and verse 6 and this is the lord speaking through malachi here right we're talking about time talent and treasure and look at and and specifically now tonight he's speaking about equality of giving in other words before i even read the scripture most of us choose what we give effort and energy to sometimes because the boss put pressure on us we give better to divorce because there's some pressure what something we give in that kind of a way but look at how god is dealing with this in malachi 1 and verse 6. a son on earth his father and a servant his master if then i be a father this is god speaking where is my honor a son on a written father and a servant his master if then i be your father where is my honor and if i be a master where is my fear so god is saying even a son that's honored his father even a servant his master then if i god is speaking about himself if i am a father where is my honor and if i be a master where's my fear say the lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name and you say wherein have ye despise my name so this year is interesting because he is speaking to priests who despise his name who by virtue of the next question they don't think they despise in his name that's why he asks this question and he say wherein have we despised thy name so god is using malachi to challenge the priests and we have spent and labored and spent effort to establish that we are all priests so i want to look at this very carefully now wherein have we despising him listen to verse seven this is how god is seeing the despising of the name now till the priest didn't realize they were despising the neymar so now god is telling them what he means by that he said ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar and he's still wearing have we polluted thee in that he say the table of the lord is contemptible and it and he offered a blind for sacrifice is it not evil the blind is referring to is you know when you bring a lamb to be sacrificed it has to be alarmed without blemish anybody with me so god is coming straight into not the fact that they're giving you know can we kind of drive home here it's not that they didn't bring the bread they brought the bread it's not that they didn't bring the lamb they brought the lamb they brought their sacrifice they gave they gave their time they gave their talent they gave their treasure they brought a sacrifice but they brought it anyhow they wanted to it and if you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if he offered a lame and sick is it not evil offer if no unto thy governor thy governor so you saying offer this not to the natural governor you bring into god you bring into kingdom business things that you can't even carry to natural man anybody with me anybody in the house tonight this is malachi 1. a lot of people have not spent time and we're going to connect this we're going to go to david then we're going to go to jesus himself so god is saying i see how old you're operating what you're bringing from me you wouldn't even care for the governor lord help us you wouldn't go to your boss with this thing you wouldn't go to pay your taxes this way the approach you're taking and this is priest he's talking to he said you and he offered a blind for sacrifice is it not evil we spent time but over spent time in in the message getting into the golden altar we spent time talking about the tabernacle and and they had to wash their hands on their feet and they had to all all the details of it that got laid out by the time malachi is profit look at how backslidden they have become but you can't tell them they're not bringing sacrifice on offering and doing what it's supposed to do you know so this is not a quantity of it it's the quality of it anybody with me it is the way they're doing it and the offer is still in verse 8 and ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if he offered the lame and sick is this not evil or for if now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person say the lord of hosts so god is speaking through malachi and has to resort to using an example of how they will treat a natural governor to try to make a comparison that what you do and not even good enough for man and he's trying to bring it to me verse 9 and now go through malachi saying and now i pray you beseech god that he will be gracious unto us this had been by your means will he regard your person said the lord of hosts who is there even among you that would shut the doors for naught neither do you kindle fire on my altar for note i have no pleasure in you said the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering at your hand in other words when you give stuff to the lord and it's not willing it's not in your heart you don't want to do it you're not approaching god the right way god say keep it i'm not accepting it because you wouldn't do that in the natural why would you bring it any spiritual anybody with me all right we we i want to help you i want to help me i want to help us this is where the scripture comes from for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the seam my name shall be great among the gentiles that's verse 11 and in every place incense shall be offered anybody with me unto my name and a pure offering now there are so many layers and layers and layers that we can go to but i want us to understand part of our worship is our giving giving of our time giving of our talent and giving of our treasure not only is it a requirement to give god is clear on how he wants it given you can't bring your time the way you want and this is why is is babies you have to keep cooks and cokes and cokes and come to church connected you hook up report for duty let that be a meeting because as a priest it's your responsibility morning sacrifice even sacrifice keeping the flame burning if you're missing that go and watch every single service from getting to the golden altar watch everything twice three four times until you understand that you're a priest the priest can say i feel in this morning to do it i have feeling this evening to go and i'm feeling you can't do that and if you're called to be a priest that is your talent you're called to do it you have to give me time to do it anybody with me verse 11 trying to i'm trying to i'm trying to move i'm trying to get in for for from the rising of the sun even into the going down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name this is powerful i know in other words worship sacrifice in every place will be offered unto the lord and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the heathen said the lord of hosts but he have profaned it in that you see the table of the lord is polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible and we can sub there anybody with me tonight so god wants our very best all right so i want to jump now if you will with me to first chronicles first chronicles 29 i just want to pick up a little point in there to help us along this journey about putting god first and understanding a few things and we can take it from scripture to see how god thinks about about it so we saw god dealing with a certain situation there in malachi and we're talking about not giving godly leftovers so you work hard hard for the boss you work hard hard for the boss and then you're wiped out you could barely keep your eye open for bible study you could barely make it to our service you're there you're on two percent but 98 going 90 you're you're there breathless breathless going to work early early in the morning you're doing this you're doing that and and your car find you when it's time to report for god so we would have spent time in our last bible study coming offered by robert's message going into the that this was the first time a major offering was picked up in scripture was for the first tabernacle and for the what he pre-sat away and we went into extensive detail in that period there between exodus 25 as we know all up to exodus 35 and we spent some time in there so i don't want to spend too much time there all right now we're at a different junction in scripture this is no longer the tabernacle now in the desert but this is now first chronicles 29 in first chronicles 28 gore will be telling david david i know your desire to build a temple but you have too much blood on your hands your son solomon i will put it in his responsibility to build temple anybody remember that so i want to now see the context here and when i saw this my mind was blown and i would tell any part that really blew my mind about perspective here all right so let's go first chronicles 29 we're going to take it from from verse 1. furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation solomon my son whom alone god had chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord god now this is david speaking all right now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of iron though and wood for things of wood you recall when we we were in exodus it almost sounds a little similar it had different colors different elements but there's a pattern that is unfolding here that's very similar to inexodus right onyx stones and stones to be set glistering stones and of diverse colors and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance moreover and this is one of the things that i didn't touch me because i have set my affection to the house of god where have you set your affection what are you affectionate about in the amplified that is said moreover because i delight in the house of my god and this way you think a little bit we'll keep you there just with your point a little bit and ask a question to prove you moreover because i have set my affection to the house of god this is the same david man after gone on heart this is david we know david moreover because i have set my affection to the house of my god i have no i are trying to move on from here but a lot of people their affection is not the house of god you know they're affectionately things of god you know they're not bothered with what happens with the kingdom you know can this be said because this is in scripture when you when you meet david david will have the same testimony i set my affection to the house of god i set my affection to the people of god i set my affection to the things of god can people say that about you not church people or anybody if i go to your closest friend and ask them what is brother so and so passionate about what do you think he set his affection to what will people say about you i want what is the thing about it it is you know these bibles are reflective movement are you selected for me when i see this i say but wait a minute can somebody say i have set my affection to the house of god to the kingdom of god to the people of god to the service of the lord to the care of these saints for the edification of the body to fighting for truth and clarity and present tense the gospel in a way that people's lives can be changed and impacted and for the unity of the faith and for some doctrine it can't just be words only to us it can't be our agenda what we're trying to achieve but i want to build into perspective because many of us and and you'll see by the time we get to the end of this service everything is connected and everything matters and i don't want to be guilty of a little thing or a small thing that could have been fixed because i wasn't looking at it the right way listen to david moreover because i have set my affection to the house of my god i have of my own proper good so david is saying of my own stuff of gold and silver which i have given to the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house so david is saying of his own of his own substance he going over and above what he has already prepared for the holy house and david goes on to explain what he david is giving even three thousand talents of gold of gold of ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses with all the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artifices and who then listen now is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the lord so david is all about the temple now this is the temple and the temple we're talking about the temple and he challenges now he asked a question who then is willing to consecrate his services day unto the lord again he acted about three things there disservice time talent treasure and here we speak in treasure verse six then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of israel you see whole as well now and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly note this word willingly we touch his word willingly in genesis in exodus as well with people who they were not willing and moses was calling for the people who willing and gave for the service of the house of god of gold 5000 talents and 10 000 drums and of silver 10 000 talents and of brass 18 000 talents and 100 000 talents of iron and there with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the lord by the hand of jahil the gosha knight then the people rejoiced no you see this attitude here this is this is a revelation by itself so they give and they rejoice when last have you given and rejoiced it's a real question you know i want you to process this for a minute because somehow within the christian journey and the way of life and the pressures and the stress and stuff giving for many people feels more like a pain than a rejoicing thing listen i know few people can teach this few people can teach this giving is like a and people could could make it as a p as if it's a how how willing you know but you know deep down if you could really rejoice because if in you trying to give you don't have a rejoice in giving it because you understand why and how and what not just the blessing you will get but what god is looking for you denying yourself blessing including spiritual blessings including desires if we had and we'll get to it then the people rejoice listen for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and david the king also rejoiced with great joy so the people were rejoicing because they were offering willingly with a perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and david who started the ball rolling who was already saying his heart is set to the things of god was rejoicing because he realized the people were also genuine with their giving no hear me tonight i ain't talking about quantity of giving are dealing with quality of giving we might have to do our next teaching on quantity but right now we deliver quality the spirit of giving the willingness of giving the approach to giving time talent and treasure now this is where i want to come to now i even reached a pattern i still trying to reach where i'm going right verse 10 wherefore this is no afternoon rejoicing friends tonight if you look into unlocked blessings take this to heart study it meditate on it relook at your life look at what god said we'll look at the word and see how it applies to you go listen back to the first lesson on this connect it to this because i don't have to read and spell you need to understand god works by principles and the principles have existed for a very long time wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father forever and ever verse 11 thine oh lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty can we just say that one more time thine oh lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty is that your testimony that you know the lord is great and powerful and glorious and victorious and majesty listen to david's perspective for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom oh lord and thou art exalted as head above all this is one of the few places in scripture that positions giving in a way that blows your mind both verse 12 both riches and honor come of thee so whatever you have is not your doing can i say that one more time whatever you have is not your doing both riches and honor come of thee and the reiness overall and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious name anybody with me this here is the scripture that matched me up david is saying but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort so david just gave this huge offering and all the people follow willingly and excitedly and david is now praying and david is asking god a question and this is the question that i think if we begin to operate like david and we look at how god entreated malachi with your approach to offering and sacrifice and all of that tying talent and treasure captured on all of that david is saying after the giving this is after they have come there you say but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee now you see this right here this should set everybody free because if god is saying give and it will come back to you bless and you'll get blessed it is better to give than to receive and all these things and we operate from a selfish standpoint that we earned it we worked for it we did it we acquired it it was my labor it was my effort and and i and they telling me i had to give something and i want to david is saying but wait a wave who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort means of this abundance for all things come of thee so david is recognizing and acknowledging that what he had he didn't earn he didn't make he didn't work because whatever you say you worked if god didn't wake up this morning you couldn't work whatever you say you do if god didn't give you strength to do it you couldn't do whatever job you have if god didn't give any job you wouldn't have the job so david is saying for all things come of thee and of thine own we have given thee so david is saying but wait a minute we actually given to god what is already his ole catch that anybody seen that listen verse 15 for we are strangers before thee answer journals as were all our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding our lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build thee and house for thine holy name comet of dine han and is all thine own so david is saying lord this store he david actually this is what david felt unworthy no there's a whole next perspective on offering david is there saying well you know because you have people who take the approach well i give something to the lord i give something to the church and it's i do it i give it it's mine it was mine to give i make a choice to give david not approaching it so you know david's saying i'm not even worried to bring this offering because yours to begin with lord everything is yours i don't even know why you're accepting it because it's yours i'm acknowledging you as the source of it all so it's out of yours that you have given me is utter yours be giving you listen all this store we have prepared to build here now look at the attitude look at the approach look at the difference look at the mindset this is scripture we read in scripture we are prepared to build your house and holding him comet of thine hand and is all thine own listen now to verse 17 i know also my god that thou has tried the heart and has pleasure in uprightness here the man that god will call a man after his ordinance beginner i know also my god that don't try is the heart the heart is going after you know and has pleasure and uprightness as for me in the uprightness of my heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee i want you to know the parallel in this willingness here in david and building of the temple and what was offered to the kingdom i want to parallel it with exodus i want you to parallel it with poor experience i want you parallel throughout scripture are you a willing giver do you understand that nothing you have is yours and it's god's and you are steward gorgeous have you managing his stuff or anybody with me tonight it reframes you thinking you know because if god recognized that you can't manage his stuff he can't give you water manage oh come on i'm gonna push and a lot of christians tell me in a message in particular they want a financial breakthrough if you can't manage the little that god gives you from his stuff how you want god to give you more because the stuff you want coming from him or you don't hear me tonight this is not pentecostal teaching this is bible teaching because if you understand that everything is god and belongs to god and we are stewards and we are being measured evaluated performance review hr review come into the office and explain to god how you spend your time how you use your talent how you use your treasure and david is coming to that realization but wait a minute who am i to even give these things i is nobody to give it because it wasn't mine in the first place it's out of your in other words we going in god's bank and giving god from inside e-bank and transferring in his account into company transfer that's what david is saying here anybody with me anybody with me so it's not your time it is not your talent it is not your treasure you are accessing god's time the talent you have is his talent the treasure you have is his treasure and god wants you to give him from what is his own anybody with me anybody who understands these scriptures will never have a problem given offering paying tights all night prayer meeting you will never have an issue never have a problem because that is bible teaching let me let me go on assuming verse 17 i know also my god that thou tries the heart and has pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of my heart i have willingly offered all these things and now i have seen with joy by people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee oh lord god of abraham isaac and of israel our fathers listen this here is so precious he said keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee so he say keep this forever what is it the willingness of giving will it catch that the understanding that everything belongs to god the understanding that everything is his his david counted this revelation to be a precious revelation he said keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people forever and prepare their heart unto thee and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build a palace for the which i have been provisioned and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your god and all the congregation bless the lord god of their fathers and bow down their heads and worship the lord and the king and the sacrifice sacrifices unto the lord this whole chapter is about sacrifice before now they go they went from natural sacrifice to now spiritual sacrifice look how god wrapped it together and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burnt offerings unto the lord on tomorrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance of all israel and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priests anybody with me so we're building time talent treasure given the quality of your given we say god saying malacca i reject what you give because you give it any all you want you give it you bring whatever you want you throw it there you do it or how and here we see david a whole different approach willingly recognizing the lord i've given you what is the even mind to give is yours i hope somebody gets some help tonight and i'm touching three areas here friends time talent and treasure we are responsible for all three you have people who like to give one and two are going after all three your time you have people who there there are people who have a problem paying tithes they're paying attention but you don't see them giving time to the lord you know these are the people who feel they could they could peer their way into heaven so ties an offering they sanitize an offering but you can't find them in a prayer meeting you can't find them you can't find them helping nobody they don't know time and talent no it's theirs because for them their time is precious oh come on i'm going in i'm starting to but over do i have permission i try to push in i'm trying to drive down this road here so for some people titan offering is fine that that is not an issue for them but tell them let's go visit somebody tell them let's go help tell them let's do something tell them let's clean the church afterwards oh oh no don't ask that time and talent for them is the problem you have those time and talent is is is is it's finding the title they they they're working it out for the lord on on effort on labor anybody with me we're trying to bring it together in context of the word now all right cool great great anybody with me all right so let's let's move on a little bit i will have to skip a whole section because i don't have too much time tonight but i want to get to one of the most interesting pieces of scripture and i'll close up with this and i'm going to tie it to the prophet now and this one also because friends we have been doing bible study for some time and you realize perspective matters right when you read a scripture and and you read it in isolation and you don't get any perspective it's there but when you get it you get a whole perspective all right so i want to go to the book of saint mark so we're going now to to jesus and a specific context here in scripture and if you want to tie it to the prophet to close out tonight i trust this has been a blessing to you and encouragement to you in some way so jesus has given parables in saint mark and in mark 12 41 we find jesus in a very interesting position the first thing i would define is jesus is position and this is what brings this whole teaching tonight to a point about quality one would expect or one would assume or one would think that if jesus is interested in observing people's behavior around the temple one would think jesus might go by the prayer altar and see people praying in fact he addressed the issue of praying you see praying in secret which is praying lord he he would he would highlight this thing so he was clearly conscious everybody with me still he's clearly conscious that people has been praying and they're praying for appearances and these kind of things and you know there are so many things jesus could do with his time there's so many places he could go people will come to the temple for different reasons one would think that jesus would spend time maybe looking to see somebody praying for a need doing different things and but sin mark has jesus doing something very interesting the bible says since in mark 12 41 and jesus sat over against the treasury time talent and treasurer so now we're going from treasure to treasury jesus sat over i want you to picture this i want you to picture this jesus said that over again the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury i want to pause right there for a minute i want to picture the scene people going into the temple and jesus by now he's known this is not jesus unknown jesus at that point of time is not in the temple praying jesus is not there praying for people jesus is not there doing anything that it would seem to be spiritual and jesus of all the places he would go positions himself and sits down watching people come and put money into the treasury could you imagine i know few people have ever looked at it this way i want to imagine what would it be like if jesus was walking around with the offering container because that is pretty much the same thing in the context here here it is jesus sitting down just watching people putting money into the treasury and the bible says and many that were rich cast in much so jesus is watching the actions he's taking note he's watching what is going on this is a system that he built hundreds and hundreds of years ago and instead of looking from afar looking from him glory he is no one earth and he's opera he's watching the operations and the bible says in verse 42 and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a fathing our father is like a one cent piece so and this so blew jesus mind it blew jesus mind completely because to this point he would have had no conversation with his disciples but when he saw this he called his disciples the bible said in verse 43 and he called on to his disciples because it was the first thing that was worthy of bringing to their attention nothing that happened before was noteworthy was what a message a text a tweet a call his disciples there just wondering why jesus is there and there jesus sit and watch and then this one where the woman comes throws in two mites which is a farthing and jesus actually calls his disciples and see it unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow had cast more in than all day which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of the abundance but she of her want her want meaning her desire her choosing her willingness anybody with me she of her willingness she of her desire caused in all that she had even all her living no i don't know how you want to personally process this but this is jesus himself giving not a teaching as a parable this was not a parable jesus was giving parables but this was not a parable this was jesus sitting on watching the human condition and seeing the people who had giving of what they have but this woman give more than all they did because she wanted to do it and she had a desire to do it and she gave more than they did she gave all that she had to live on i'm not saying give all i have to live on but i'm just showing what jesus was taking note of and i'm going to get ready to close with this a familiar story we all know it brother branham this is from the message my new ministry we are familiar with it but i trust you i've heard of the butterfly effect scientists refer to the butterfly effect oh one action somewhere else in the world let's say a butterfly flaps its wings in africa could create a storm or a hurricane in the park you will because there's a ripple effect sometimes we don't know how things connect all right so i want you to see how this thing connected for this one experience here in brother brown's ministry brother branham in my new ministry sister hattie wright all of you know we call her right her name is mosey but she has been a loyal person a little old housewife lives in two rooms a way back into the hills out there with a shovel and a hole trying to hold the cockle bulls out of the corn part so like in agriculture trying to cut all the weeds from the corn patch to keep a little family together she has worked faithfully but abandoned goes on now listen don't miss this show you the sovereignty of god now while we were talking so we would recall that brother branham would have shared with sister hattie wright or in the presence of sisterhati right his experience with the squirrels when his spirits were created all right students of scripture any message would know this right so listen to this here now listen don't miss this now i'm reading show you the sovereign sovereignty of god now while we are we were talking i said i want to ask you something what put those squirrels there there's no squirrels in the woods i had hunted and hunted and i'm not the best of hunter but i've hunted since i was a little boy and i had hunted close and they were in the most ridiculous place and in the most ridiculous way i could call them i said what put them there so but the brandon was sharing you see in all his years of experience hunting them squirrels that he end up shooting it had to come from somewhere else because that is not where they would usually be the way it was was different right but ivan said i said i wonder if it is that my ministry fixing to take a change that the god of abraham is confirming his promise as he did to abraham when he was up on top of the mount and he needed a sacrifice for instead of his son jehovah jared performed a miracle and placed a ram a hundred miles back he was three days journey and any ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day then he lifted up his eyes and saw the mountain of fire off and then went to the mountain and went on and topped the mountain while ram back in their sheep wild animals would have killed it and then up on top of the mountain where there's no water how did that ram get up there what happened god needed a sacrifice to prove to abraham that he was jehovah jireh the very god of creation spoke aram into existence no it wasn't even a vision he killed the ram and blood came out of that animal it wasn't a vision it was a ram i said that same god hallelujah that jehovah jireh he's just as much jehovah jared today as he was on the mount with abraham can the church say amen but if branham clapped his hands three times he can still produce an animal to his glory these curls was not a vision i shot them blood came out of them i dressed them and eat them there wasn't visions they were squirrels i said that same jehovah gyra trying to get his promise over to me in my thickness and dollars of mine he could speak my need into existence the same as he could speak abraham's need into existence all right so listen brother bran i'm finishing he's sharing this in that room let's go i know more than said that until sister hat is sitting there crying no hasn't said a word so but abandonment is sharing it and it's having an impact on sister hattie and she said that's nothing but the truth but ibrahim goes on she said the writing she said just like bang said down there i heard her voice as it swept from my ears like up into the woods and that super annoying thing that adam said swept over me said tell hattie that she has found grace in the sight of god who would have thought said tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak it by this gift into existence whatever she asks it speak it into existence i look to sister hati the first time it was ever performed in a human being i said sister hattie ask what you will god is going to give it to you my that that's powerful her friends what do you think of that congregation says amen does it get into you seven times he had confirmed it all right ask what you will hating that to me brother branham what do you mean i said ask anything your heart desires and it shall be produced right here that you will know that the lord god of heaven answers and his scriptures are true but abandonment said he's sharing now because he's preaching this whole thing right in the pulpit my first time with a new gift my first anointing i could hardly hear and she looked around we had been talking about her little crippled sister i said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little eat it will be jumping to the glory of god hattie looked around all around and she said brother bill my greatest desire is for the salvation of my two boys whether why there couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for ten thousand dollars she would have got it what if it would have been some millionaire who would have asked for another million god knowed what she was going to ask for everybody with me we're getting ready to close out now sister hearty at least seven or eight witnesses standing there all you people that was present when that happened raise up your hands so but at random is sharing this and the people in the church who were there when it happened all right ask anything you want cause god has given to me to give to you whatever you want she said her voice was beginning to go off on the on the teenage tantrum and she said the salvation of my two boys i said by the will of god by the power of god i give you in the name of jesus christ your desire and her two boys shook under the power of god and that whole building trembled my my my mind banks fell into his plate shelby grabbed and had his scream till you could hear her for two blocks and then two boys with tears rolling down their cheeks receive exactly what they asked for right then oh the first time it was ever used on a human being ask what you will and a child be giving on to you her boy sitting there with her this morning what would she have asked for what if she would have asked the healing of a little sister what if she would have asked that that little girl would have been healed but her two boys lost what if but ibrahim is there he said what if and then but ibrahim says something mind-blowing and most people know that part but what is what about i'm saying right after that but ibrahim says what if he said that poor speaking widow my sister hattie and brother branham had spoken about it in another message before this message he said that poor widow who had just told me that she are trying to give to this church 50 on a pledge to help build a new church and brother robinson wouldn't take it and only let her give 20 of it and i said to myself when she was speaking i'll give her back the 20. so brother branham is saying that sister hattie was struggling financially she had come to the church and said she wanted a pledge fifty dollars one of the brothers says he's not gonna take it end up taking just 20. and brother branham also felt so bad about it that he says he want to give up back the 20 dollars i wanted to show you the prophet experience and how god is seeing and dealing with it with the prophet as well but god said to me in my heart now not no god said to me in my heart no not by vision in my heart when jesus and that's why i'm tying it back now so i want you to see the connection now between sisterhati's experience with the salvation of our two boys the fact that the prophet was even in our house in the first place the testimony by the banana was given a number that branham has taken this scenario back now to a root cause stuck our connection here but i said but god said to me in my heart now not by vision in my heart when jesus was standing watching a widow putting three pennies where there was thousands of dollars laying what would you have done so that's god speaking to the prophet in his heart i said well if i would have been standing there and i said we don't need it sister so brother branham is being sincere he said he would have said we don't need it we got plenty of money but jesus never said it he let her go on listen to the prophet no he let her go on and do it because he knowed what was down the road you heard that so let me bring it to our close now so help me god as my solemn judge god knew that was down the road for her so but a branham is now saying god knew all along when sister hattie was trying to make a little pledge the effort she'd been in that pledge what the blessing would have been that was tied to that let me bring it so close and i run my hand listen to the prophet and i run my hand in my pocket to get my pocketbook to give her her twenty dollars back and say sister hearty but he said but what i'm saying but he'll told him don't do it and then a few minutes when the question is brought up about jehovah gyra she said that's nothing but the truth and it comes from a poor widow woman's heart god knowing she'd ask the greatest thing that could be done as long as there's a heaven when the stars is gone when there's no more moon no more earth no more sea them boys shall live on true eternity with the same jehovah gyra who gave the immortal promise his promises cannot fail so friends i want to show tonight that many people don't connect that part of sister hattie right testimony her experience and what he prophet himself went through as a man in this day but here it was god dealing with the prophet but he also honoring sisterhati as he did that widow woman who jesus himself saw who he said give more than all those who give because she was willing to give so it shows that since the heart he had the right heart to begin with your right desires to begin with i'm finished tonight says bower heads forward of prayer or grace says heavenly father lord we thank you tonight for your love for your grace for your mercy lord for this teaching on time talent and treasure lord and how you want our best you don't want our leftovers lord you want us to put you
