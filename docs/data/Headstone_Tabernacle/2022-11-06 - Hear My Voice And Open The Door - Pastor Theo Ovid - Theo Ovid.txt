in Jesus we ask it amen God bless you thank you for coming God bless all of you here and you were connected to us life we want to go to the scriptures Revelation chapter 3. want to read from verse 14. girlfriend chapter 3 verse 14. and unto the angel of the Church of laodistance write these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and when I works this is God speaking that would neither cold nor hot I would that would call a Hut so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I was Beauty out of my mouth so God's pure lukewarm straight out of his lung because don't see us I am rich increased with Goods have need of nothing and no it's not the dog wretched and miserable and poor and blind naked this is what they don't know think the rich thing to increase with Goods but they don't know this we say Tina constantly buy of me gold tried in the fire the dog must be rich white green men the dog must be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint their eyes but I said that thou May a sea as many as I love I read book and Jason bizella Stefan repent behold I stand on the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and would support him and he with me may God bless his word you may be seated it's always a blessing to be in the house of God where we can get strength all your Victory all your britual and deliverance comes from the word of God there is no philosopher there is no writer there is no author there is no one could bring give you that breakthrough outside of this Gospel of Jesus Christ [Music] so last service I believe it was we speak about uh uh if uh uh the whole I started or knock I want to go a little further today I have a title here hear my voice and open the door I said I'll hear my voice and open the door and this is for any man whosoever will this you only hear Jesus outside the church outside and he's knocking yeah you can't barge in him itself in he can't force himself you know he can't save you against your will he can't heal you against your will he can deliver you against your will if you want to be how you are you could see as you are but if you want to be changed you have a decision to make I don't want this kind of like I want a different life I want to change then if you knock the doors on the inside you open the door and let him in and something could happen I will support you nobody come knocking on your door with nothing to tell you at this recent time knocking and running away they knock because they have a message for you they're not because they want to say something to you they're not because they have something to give you that's why they knock and Jesus is a gentleman he's embossing on nobody door to go in you have to open the door and that is why in church have all types some of Jesus outside some of Jesus were questioning wrong songs yesterday in the porch and have all types inside of here because you are a free moral agent and God put you on the earth in the same basis he put Adam and Eve no something struck me and I hope it strike you today what's the sense giving somebody free choice and they have no choice if God wanted he could have put Adam and Eve and tell them eat everything and all also we wasn't going to be here this morning no sickness no disease no death nothing at all but he put them with the ability to make choices here it is God said let us make man in our image and likeness but he can make them robots like they like zombies yes right yes right you know you have to choose whether you want to serve God or not so in the Garden of Eden because he set up man this way with free choice because there's no mandatory soil so if you want to talk you talk come back on your husband at home he could have said that and she should have said that but she engaged in conversation herself because she wanted it that was a choice go tell them every tree you eat all the heavier tree but that tree name is don't touch it because the day you eat that day you die that's why we are funeral services that's what we have heartaches that's why we have tears that's what we have here green and all kind of sicknesses and so on because somebody this this disobey God's word and if we get back to God's word we're going to bless us you're going to bless her going out you're gonna bless her coming in he said blessed is a man that walketh not in the Council of them Godly not stand in the way of Sinners nor sit in the seat of this cornful but is the light is in the law of the Lord and in that Lord God he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water whatsoever he do is shall prosper or give the Lord some shouts inside of here this is God blessing to you this is God promised to you David says himself I've never seen the righteous forsaken you have to believe you are the Righteous seed on Earth God himself call you no man could come and set the father draw him God has to call you Oh Glory to God I was a filthy dirty sinner but God called me I heard a knocking in my heart and I answered the call and I'm still here Satan I'm still here okay the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God and David said it boldly though I walk to the Valley of the shadow of the attacks shall fear no evil for thou art Whitney thyroid and staff they comfort me forgive the Lord some Praises David said don't ten thousand follow my right side I shall not be moved Give the Lord I shout God is for you this morning [Applause] Glory [Applause] [Music] so you have five senses of the flesh see they smell feel and touch and five senses of the spirit conscience imagination affection reasoning and so on but it has nothing to do with the sick sense of fate that God put on seed inside of you Hallelujah so God put every man and woman and I love it because God know the choices we would make so that's why you can make all things work together for good when you're beating pan smoking drinking carrying on and drinking and whatnot God knew you'll become out of that God knows Satan could only hold you so much and no more because you had to come to your senses do you understand what I'm saying that prodigal son backstage and holy money run out he didn't pick food he came to and says you know he came to himself he said I will arise I will go on to my father I will say father I have sinned I'm no longer worthy to be called your son make me a servant they expect food everyone good or give the Lord some Praises pray this pick food they're going as good how long he can pick food what the devil have to give you is pick food or give the Lord a shout God of a table spread you have hidden manner Oh Glory to God you have Inner Strength for you he has power for you he has blessing for you praise God no weapon form against you could Prosper you are protected by God or give the Lord a shout bullet passing here bullet passing here none coming ID or give the Lord some Praises in the house Glory Hallelujah I look how much robbers bandage trucks like the cave trainer take over the clothes that I'm not doing me Glory I'm a son of the king your devil have to get permission to interfere with your life that's when he anointed that's when he appointed that's when you are predestinated oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God when you walk Angels walking with you when you quiver you call the angel of the Lord and Camp around them that fail him Angels walking with you oh give the Lord some Praises we've got to know who we are we got to know who's we are foreign [Applause] you're a free moral agent to act any way you wish to and none of these other senses have anything to do with it neither Soul nobody it's through the spirit on self-will so even Jesus knowing he was born to die when he came to Calvary let me switch back when he came to Gethsemane what did he pray he said if it is possible foreign you don't run to that he said if it is possible let this come pass but if not nevertheless not my will but thy will be done do you see that's a debt to Will do you see that you have your own will and sometimes your mother say don't do it somebody said do it and you do it anyhow because you want to do it that's what we're talking about you have to will to live a will to die or give the Lord a shout glory to God you have to will you have a desire to come unto Egypt for two how much years then bondage Pharaoh beating them the building bricks and have a desire to get a deliverer and when they cry unto God and they begin to call and seek the Lord God told Moses I heard the Cry of my people and I come down to deliver and when you're ready to get Deliverance she goes out of cry you ain't gonna sit down on your sin you wouldn't sit down in your unbelief they wouldn't sit down in your condition and more open some God smile on you if they work and show you have to repent Oh Glory to God that's the message of John the Baptist repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is the Lord a shout you have to repent and recognize you are wrong glory to God you are wrong Hallelujah glory to God and get the Godly sorrow for sin not worldly sorrow Godly sorrow not the sower the world have because somebody get exposed and they mess up no not that kind of sorrow but they'll recognize you offended God to recognize his God you're affected he recognizes God you're hurt or give the Lord some Praises Godly sorrow glory to God when God looking at you your wife might be looking your husband like me looking but God looking okay the Lord our prayers hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus let's go so God made man and all the animals till he come down to sin hear this but but he could not make sin because he cannot be righteous and the father of righteousness and make sin so you know what he done he made Man In His Image knowing man would fall because he was given to be a free moral agent he knowed he was going to touch the tree he said don't touch it he said that's just you you die he thought you should die he knew man would fail but he couldn't make him feel that's a good one you know he knew man would fail but he couldn't make him fail he had to do it on himself and that would make God righteous so God put a man in the image and like this no bar No Woman No Calypso no Carnival no pan beaten nothing at all just a man his wife the tree and the man fell and that man was in God's image so that means any man could fall so behave yourself and don't play self-righteous or give the Lord some Praises glory to God behave yourself for all I've sinned and come short of the glory of God don't play a more righteous than nobody inside of here behave yourself Give the Lord some praises glory to God hallelujah it wasn't you knocking on God's door it was God knocking on your door he said behold I stand on the door and knock If any man hear my voice hey an open hear his voice and open the door I'm gonna come in I see this morning let him in [Music] let him in because of what's inside the house [Music] I said don't go there preacher we're going right there all right so he knew man would feel and but yet he couldn't make him fall he had to do it on himself so that will keep him righteous so man fell himself after he made him so close to himself he put him on the basis of free moral agency and therefore that is where he fell by his act he fell and today each one of you children and each of us adults is placed on them same two trees we can't we can accept it or refuse it oh my God so God was in Christ the anointed one that was Christ means anointed one there what was it what he said watching he died to pay the debt of your hybriden so because man fell a price had to be paid to get us back on track it wasn't free so Jesus had just come to die he come to pay the price of a high breeding to get us back in the original because Adam wants to speak for a son just like him how did God make man let us make man it was spoken word So Adam was supposed to speak for his son in the womb of Eve and bring forth another Son of God but when Adam fell and the creation fell it fell into sex but it wasn't so from the beginning it was supposed to be spoken word so that's why Jesus when he first message he came he said you must be born again of the word and the spirit so we are already going back out are we supposed to be in Genesis by the word and the spirit so when you come to church you come to come they get the word inside of you and then the spirit takes the word and transform inside of you glory to God your flesh is the same outside dying man but something happened on the inside that the devil could only watch but yeah touch or give the Lord a shout the same outside man but a different Inner Man glory to God a new man inside the dear oh God God put the work inside of you a light like a button coming inside of you and every devil in hell could see the light over your life every devil in hell to see that light inside of you or give the Lord a shout we are not trinidadians we are born from here we born from above Give the Lord a shout Oh Glory love God you are not from this Earth You are from above testimony [Applause] Glory God send your New Year to give you a witness to the world that Jesus Christ has seen yesterday in favor please go on again my heart say Lord age 17 praise God oh my that's the greatest thing I could have done surrender to Jesus and I'm on my real journey I pick up a wife I pick up three sons I pick up daughter-in-laws I pick up grandchildren are still on my way to the journey I have stopped yet I keep walking pray you can't stop no you can't shut down now you write a hot or cold whatever God I have to do I'm gonna do all my best on my strength now say if I lose my teeth I could use my gums but I'm gonna stay and fight anyhow oh give the Lord us he prays offering Hallelujah but we will go home and they're gonna fight inside of here Lord this bride is not going to be like evil she was still behind the word but despite will be the word because the world will become flesh inside of you you're gonna be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his Spirit life of his life Glory let me be seated watch he died in order to pee the death of your hybridian what is it that you could die to yourself so you want this and God said no but but you want it so you all will become stronger than God's will for your life so sometimes people really want to pray because they're afraid go tell them no that's why they don't ask God you know Because deep down they know coming already because they know it's not right but they want it yeah and someone said we're going to take it then you can get burned but that's where you're saving it from she's gonna protect you from building your hands what is it that you could die to yourself until you are normal yourself and be filled with his word believe in his word and then the Holy Spirit was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow and then what is it it is God manifesting continuing the work of his full son he's doing that through you God have an interest in us getting back to Indiana whether Adam lost his life he lost his inheritance in life he lost the title deed the original deed went back and as original owner when you have property internet everybody asking for a deed they did show testimony of ownership if you don't have a deed they say a squatter and if the original owner comes back he could take it back so the original one of the Earth was God himself now the Earth was not created for demons the Earth was created for Sons and Daughters of God that's what he put the Earth for for us We Are Not Angels so even though I go to heaven six Dimension you have to come back here because this is Where We Belong we shall reign on the Earth this is what God put the Earth for for man when Lucifer and his boys got kicked out of heaven they fell on the Earth is rebellious gang the rebels Hallelujah that fell off our pride and and he won power he wanted to be in charge you want to be like the most high and they have men right now trying to be like the most high too and God will bring them no the most low praise God don't try to be the most high God will bring you down low because everybody exalted shall be brought down low oh give the Lord some Praises my God hallelujah praise God so listen let us know the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed as long as laying here it won't do nothing but when it comes in here when it comes into the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God ten Visions come then power comes then humility comes all you know it all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die he lives there's some people don't like to admit they don't know they prefer to Bluff their weight and they say I don't know that you know could you tell me yeah but you don't know you're bluffing your way through you're too proud that's why you act like you know and sometimes you bless you with you sometimes you get you sometimes you don't but you don't want to say you know I really don't know that you know but there are people who know their stuff and that way one resource day well you know you let's say you want a mechanic or something somebody said he's he's a spanner he's a mechanic because he's a spanner you wouldn't go to a doctor operation a man just passed his degree just come on the law he say he never even operates in a body and they say I want to operate on him you wouldn't want that you want that duck to operate many many times you have 80 operations behind his back that's the person you want a manual custom which man can't take blood when you do something you want to leave you you don't want that oh Hallelujah so when you come to God you come to get the expert they come to get the Fountain of wisdom they come to get his knowledge they get they get the information it's not right so we are predestinated why Christ is the Original Seed and this Original Seed was predestinated by the foreknowledge of God knowing that the fall would come and predestined him to take our place you get it all Sons and Daughters of God are predestinated all all so when your mother had you you not was after thought you had to come because God ordained you as a seed earlier do you believe that so what he didn't make Eve do that he didn't make her do it but he knewed she would do it so God foresaw and predestinated the world of Sons and Daughters of God isn't that right praise the name of the Lord so we know that every year the high priest used to have to offer blood in the temple isn't that right and Israel will be under tension waiting to know if God forgive them once a year you have to go in there with bells ringing isn't that right from the holy place to the most holy place isn't that right the outer Court he has to go in in and when did he come back out the people shout because they know they got forgiven that all that was a temporary reprieve because the Lamb of God had to come to pay the price every year either going praise God but they pay the price forever praise God is not right and the veil between that and the holy place the holiest of holies the only way you can get in there is to have self-will the will to do the will of God praise God we believe that and when Christ comes in you create an altar on your heart and your sins are taken daily the great Saint Paul said I Die daily who said that Paul said that the prophet said that I Die daily not weekly not monthly I Die daily every day we have to die every day we have to surrender every day we have to submit ourselves to his will into his word praise God you will to live or you will to die either one you want to praise God you are based on free moral agency the doctor say a second you have some disease or you have cancer or something so all of a sudden like something clicking your mind I go there I go there I go there I go there you sing like a Psalm like a song after that's your special you go dead who said you were dead God Is A Healer free is good but

little boy being very swift-footed known good well that he could order on all the rest of the boys in the contest he thought he could he practiced day after day of running how he could pump up his lungs got his physical body and trim he would he wouldn't Tire as he gone he practiced how to start with his feet get his head plunged ahead of the rest of the boys know who he must breathe during the time I was running in order to hold the oxygen that came to his body to keep him pumping on it wouldn't slope his heart too much he studied it from every Angry curd and in the morning that they restarted there was more than 150 little boys line up at a certain age this little boy was rather a good-sized boy for his age and he remembered all his training he got ready they got on the line put their faces against the string that come forward along pushed the little nose up against it he studied all the rules of that making himself ready when the gun was fired and the line was broken the little boy jumped forward little guy so physically fit till he jumped way ahead of the rest of them and down the track he went with terrific speed well trained until he could outrun every boy that was in the race and he was there quite a long time a minute or more before the rest of the runners ever reached the place but all of his physical training he had forgotten the password he had forgotten the very thing that he was to see to let him in at the gate so he reached first in front of everybody and boy he forgot the password all his physical training he had forgotten the password he had forgotten the very thing that he was to say to let him in the gate he pays back and forth stalled sir to his mind he had been so interested in the natural physical conditions of his body till he had

praise God Amen Hallelujah okay let's continue there's an artist you know you say before you go into the Hall of Fame you had a bachelor hold of the critics people that criticize you had a painting and the pain was a pain of Christ in front the door and the other said you forgot to put a latch on the door if the man would come in how could he come in when there's no latch in the coming by oh the other said I painted the dust you see in this case the latch is on the inside and that's the way it is the latch is on the inside Christ knocks at the door but you have to open the door he will not do that against your will he give you the ability to let him in he cannot force himself in for there is no latch for him to come in by you must open the door he said If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and would sup with him oh glory to God Isaiah hear his voice today and open that door we can't even bang down your door you have to open the door and say God I want you in my walk my talk my life do you believe that glory to God but brother Branham I'm a Christian I know honey dear you're a Christian I appreciate that by accepting the Lord but you are living under your privilege you are keeping your door closed you're running from Pillar To Post some people do that looking for this Minister this pastor looking for more Revelation more thing is still in the head but the door's shutting up they're only having a mental experience with information he said no you're running from pillar to postal fault because you don't believe you must open that door of faith and let him in and he will give you the desire of your heart all right no you know the script that we read I constantly buy me gold trying to fight I didn't be rich as many as I love I rebuke and chasteness so those that are loved of God get the rebukes you get the chastisement and you see if your lord receive chastisement you're not a son you're a bastard son I was the bastard son you don't know about them these Bullocks on them it's a reuse on your straight note because you want them to come right any genuine parent will straighten out their children to get them right is and God is no different he's straight not Noah he's straight not Moses all his sons he straightened out yes as you pass behind him back I says you he is no respecter of persons I know that preacher Prophet pastor King it doesn't matter he has no respecter of persons he honors his word he honors his truth that's why he told Adam the day you eat thereof that day you die that's what make him go to us he keeps his word his curses and His blessings oh give the Lord a shout in the house Glory Hallelujah thank you Jesus he said I stand at the door said Jesus in this age did you notice the only church age that he was put out of his church all the other churches he was inside the church though through the Methodist Lutheran and so forth he was on the inside the church but he is on the outside our Creeds and things have run him out of the church he's standing there knocking but here and opened the door I will come up with him and support him and give him a healing for his eyes and close and give him Riches of Heaven he that will hear me knock oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and whenever what what does a man knock on a man's door for he's trying to gain entrance he's trying to get in he's perhaps got something he want to tell you talk over with you he got a message for you that's the reason people knock on one another's door they got some reason to it there cannot be that happened without some reason you could go to another you cannot go to a man's house unless there's some reason to go if nothing else to visit take him to a message or something and whenever there's a question there has got to be an answer there could not be a question without an answer so we look for the Bible these questions of the day the Bible has the answer and you know the most important person of all time Jesus Christ knocks at our door and he's turned away more than all the kings and potentials there whatever was who would come to your house any greater than Jesus Christ who could knock at your door greater than Jesus Christ who could do that the Son of God who could knock at your house would be more important yet he knocks day after day day after day and if you even accept him you call a fanatic see the world knows its own what if you knocked at somebody's door he's switching it now let's turn the picture right around for a minute what if you went and knocked on somebody's door and you had something for them and they were about like you would be to God well you know and so when you knock on somebody's door and the people of the window and shut the curtain and neither come out the door and say or say some other time you say I ain't got this time this morning you know what you'll do you're probably the same thing I will do you wouldn't go back anymore but not Jesus do you see that but not Jesus I stand and knock continually knock he that seek it not seek he that knock it so he is continuing nothing every day he's knocking hey I want to talk with you hey I want to help you I want to deliver you I want to free you I want to heal you oh glory to God I want to bless you hey open the door man open the door now man I can't push it down I can't break it down I know Bigfoot my boss don't you don't want to enter in you have to open the door hey do you want Deliverance do you want to break you do you want some pressure for your family Oh Glory to God I'm still out here I'm still waiting come on now you are son praise God you are daughter of God you don't have to live like a devil you don't have to live like a pig you don't have to live like an animal you can live hard on that he made man a little Lord and Angels not hire any animals they could live better than that come on now you can overcome to him and overcome it behold I stand I don't knock are you hearing my voice do you know it's me glory to God who else is knocking praise God hallelujah I want you to get the Deliverance I want you to get a breakthrough come on now I want your cop to run over glory to God that's what David said wake up run it over surely mercy and while follow me all the days of my life blessed be the name of the Lord isn't that right Hallelujah Doyle what if I invite you to my house you come in the door and you knock the door and I looked outside yes come on in if you if you can help me well you do so when you come in now I don't want you I do all your medal around my house you know you stand here right at the door the human heart there are many little doors in the human heart and little doors covers up a lot of things when I come to your house if you welcome me in the door why you say well but I'm glad to see you it's a privilege of me to come into your house won't you come and sit down but Ibraham make yourself at home I can go to the refrigerator get me one of those big sandwiches take off my shoes go on bedroom and lay down I have a weak astronomical Jubilee because I felt welcome you made me welcome I appreciate that you made me welcome but if I went to your home and you told me you stand here at the door no don't you go middling around I wouldn't feel too welcome would you you will feel to welcome so let's look at the human heart the doors inside of doors we want to identify one first door here at the door of selfishness what I can get out of it for me and my family only cares about you all your burden is about you and your family you zoom in right there it ends right there you're not looking to your left look to the right who need help who need encouragement who need prayer all your concerns about you selfishness it's for me or for my group as long as my animation is all right see and you know there's a kiss I find you know this thing called selfishness and God could hardly use a selfish person because they don't give they don't share they keep everything locked down God has gave a giver because that person will give so God could give them the more God give them the more they give so they become a Channel of God's given but when people selfish they stop right there by them isn't that something you're gonna just go through it quickly praise God he said I'd like to do a certain thing I if you say what I like for him to do a certain thing for me if I can get so much out of it I'll go to church if I'll make people in my community think better of me but you won't open this little door so you'll receive Christ you open him but you keep that selfishness yeah yeah like the private people she's there that's yours but he wants you to open the door and get that selfishness out Hallelujah another little door in the heart is a door called Pride that's a big one that's a big one little dough when they come human heart he says it's have a lot of them but I'm going to speak a few of them on the right side of the human heart I like that when you walk into the door is that they'll go on the right side and that door is called the door of Pride don't you go enter into that door they don't want the Lord in there at all that is pride I am Blue Blood it is pride don't you meddling there he can't feel welcome as long as you keep that Pride or shot that's why sometimes God sent us to experiences to humiliate us and humble us he said he went and tries people threw a lot of stuff to Humble them and to prove them to see what's in their hand you knew you could very proud being God's people that's how Israel becoming a proud God's people till they could do anything praise God there's another door called Pride what a horrible little black Devils all pinned up in the heart of pride thinking you're better than somebody else bunch of devils in that room you know Christ's just outside but in that room that door you don't want to open that door at all I like how he's sitting a bunch of black Devils all pinned up in the heart of pride thinking you are better than somebody else because Mike just better shoot better house better car better I am better I am the better one and the devil feeling better inside Pride fear feel complex you have you don't want Jesus to touch that because it will degrade your social standing Society I wonder if we have some open services and invite somebody Believers to come and get some tambourine at this side of the road oh God I think I think that's a good one boy but that could be a Revival glory to God let them come inside the road and I

looking at that mirror after 50 years your best looking you're looking you continue in your foolishness you better thank God for the grace that you're still alive the land of the living you have an opportunity to hear the gospel because it's a famine in the land for hearing the truth of God give us preaching all kind of foolishness they run into the east west and north and south and can't find it but to hear in gospel you're hearing word of righteousness hearing away from a prophet that we are gonna have a Revival under all trash will boil out when fire start to roll inside the church Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God Amen you see me on fire I was a Catholic you know I was a dead Catholic you know when I started to read the Bible and said don't call no my father my father never forget him God they are getting scriptures I was acolyte he gave me one quote I scared down the eyes without clothes I tell any priests the Bible said don't call woman father You Know The Enemy I mean after that I began to read the scriptures be there for perfect as your father name is perfect when when did Gideon's people drop Bibles in school my friends and I'm sure the Bible just means I hold on to that little bible I begin to read it and it was such a joy and something that means something me was crying for what's inside the deer I kept the bible let them throw it away that's a choice that they took that wasn't my choice my choice was the Holy Scripture and I said I am to be perfect I didn't know about the message yet but I know from the scripture that Jesus said be there for perfect so I had something in my heart for Perfection Oh Glory so when I get this message of perfection I could receive it because this Teach Me by them seven steps Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness perfectly kindness I am going to be perfect I know devil and hell go stop it no sin nothing pass nothing present nothing to come go stop this Perfection it take Perfection to bring the resurrection glory to God hallelujah hallelujah is that they want to be a Christian or you don't want to be a Christian your choice he has to have access to every room in the house every compartment all the little secret things of Life he's got to have access to every bit of it then he becomes Lord so here Lord of you yet until you open them doors oh give the Lord a shout do you want them to be Lord Hallelujah open them doors [Applause] Jesus said let me see your cell phone hold on we have my next door we're coming to you know you don't have your private life say Jesus this is private this is private have a password on it okay you know what Jesus if things is fine Jesus could go to your cell phone you can see where your browsing what you're looking at who you're talking to you can see everything he said Jesus here you are five amen I asked for cell phone you know I told my Jesus you know your pastor come to check itself I know I'm not in chickens I want my head to stay straight and right what does he want okay what does he want to come in your heart for is to be your Lord he's knocking at the door to be your savior if you hold selfishness and pride and Malice and all these things in your heart he can't be a lord do you accept him he can't be your lord what stopping is is fellowship when you got the fellowship of one with another that you and the Lord are buddies your partners whatever you have he has to whatever he has then you have to you become like we said in some parameter back his friend of God and it easy to get things from your friends than if you're a stranger and if you're not talking to the Lord have sup with the Lord having fellowship with the Lord and they come and say give me give me give me you're stranger but when you have a friend you could say let me have bread could I have some aloof something to eat something to drink and you get it because it's a friend so here at this now let's continue he's got to humiliate you that's what he comes in for you mean to tell me I have to go down and act like the rest of them that is pride I want the Holy Ghost private Holy Ghost remember Emmanuel the Holy Ghost and the in boss man say I want the Holy Ghost is to come you want to come come say follow me follow me and he went down and crossed and he picked stay all the pigs are stinks melon pigs and when he crosses over no one says no no he said you're ready for it yet because if you're ready for this thing you come anywhere every again when you are ready to open that door and let him come in he will be cleared out for you shorts will go out in the garbage can make up will go back in the garbage can and the Baba was after that if he just caught woman's here is a cutting woman here because he can't cut your hair God your hair has given to you the covering when you cut your hair as a woman you break a covenant when you hear way away here long as a man nice problems God don't like that either all right all right now watch something they say wait a minute young man I'm virtuous that might be so in your own thoughts but remember their judgment you're going to answer for commit an adultery whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after had committed adultery already you presented yourself to him see how the devil got them blinded it's a disgrace it's they got a spirit and it's an Unholy Spirit the genuine holy spirit will make a woman dress decently and look holy all right we're under stretch door to your private life foreign I don't know that but if you want Jesus not the pastor Jesus open the door to your private life there's a door there I want to call that door a door the right hand side and the door is the door to your private life you know if I want to go out a cocktail party what is that to you what is the church going to tell me a tenth of my wages you're going to tell me what to do that's my private life I make this money I have my own life I wear shorts if I want to my privilege but if you're a lamb not a goat alarm is what he's after so no you could understand the parable of the soul and the seed some fell on the Wayside some Philemon rocks spring up and then die some fell among Thorns some fell on good ground the seed is not the problem it's a ground had fallen so every service seeds are going out the ground is the heart s that are until Rocky need a whole need a pickaxe to get their stones out and then you'll take a hole and you revive the ground then you can put season so that's what the word does it grabs out things that needs to come out to get the seed in because remember the seed bring forth after its kind and the seed have to be the word coming inside of you so a lot depends upon the kind of Hearts so that's why he said there is no such thing as a holy church the Holy Ghost can be preaching it but inside the day if I'm good bad Rebels Renegades all kinds because inside that they have all kind of Hearts but you're preaching the word of God and we don't know the condition of the heart unless God reveals it so you have to know what condition your heart is in that you could receive the word of God so some people they hear it and they can act upon it because it's effective to them some people just hearing it is like what on Duck back maybe they come to see somebody they come because they come a long time and they don't want to look like they're backstream they're making up time they'll know where they go this Sunday morning and that traffic all around to them as well spend some time in church what kind of thing people come for Oh Glory to God whatever come to be changed and transformed then this world is for you praise God because the world have to take you back the way you belong glory to God hallelujah now watch yes then there's a Dwarven difference to people who whether God bless them and bless them you know there but I'm talking about after a while people see so much America so much times and wonders become normal to them no more excitement no more thrill and that is troubling you know because sometimes people miss the grace of God they save and they save and they look like everybody like if they they're so righteous and and how can this person mean such sin and how would this happen how that happened how you happen he was dancing too God didn't deliver you well as God show you Mercy show other Mercy too Moses sit and judge others praise God one time brother was doing that you know he was judging a woman with some other men are wrong in a bar and whatnot and and he was saying oh God for my daughters to grow up in this kind of condition and God tap him on the shoulder and a vision broke and God show him his sins and when his sins watch go up to God a bumper of the blood of Jesus wash around in the earth and and it was bouncing backs off and then God write pardon drop his sins in the sea of forgetfulness and he tell him I forgive you and you condemn her on one part I want to bring more than this because the blood is around the Earth you are covered until you die if you die with all Christ you go to hell because the blood doesn't cover beyond that so on Earth because of the blood you have a chance you have a choice the lowest sinner have a choice because the blood is still Heavenly Earth if they leave the earth when all that blood affecting their heart then they go to hell oh praise God so today is the day of salvation and you know what he did afterwards he went to the woman and tell the woman he said woman I was condemning you and whatnot and God show me my sins and how you forgive me and I won't begin to testify to him while she was once a Christian and she got backslidden and oh God and right there on the floor in the bad place in the restaurant he knee along with that woman and brought her back to Christ because God show him his own sins and how God handled his own sins and when God revealed to you that the same blood for you is for your brother the same blood for you is for your sister you will stop condemning them or give the Lord a shout and you're going to pray for them because that is still your brother that is still your sister and you can still get Grace to love them Oh Glory to God Amen Hallelujah I think this is the last door we have here the door feet the next door is feet you have private life door of Pride now let's open feet he says no you said brother slider would you pray for me I said yes ma'am I'll be glad to your backside of the year now I just want just wait a minute let me read the scriptures to you talk about in hospitals all right there's a ladies laying there in a bed looked at me next bed really funny her and her son about 20 years old regular Ricky standing there looking at me I said yes ma'am I said I read the scripture to her do your sins be a Scarlet they shall be white as snow don't they be like red like Crimson it shall be right like wool and when I read that to her I said if you are straight away you've got away from God but God never got away from you you wouldn't be calling for me she started crying I said will you pray the lady over the next bed said wait a minute wait a minute there I said yes ma'am she said pull that curtain I said aren't you a Christian she said we are methodists I said well what that has to do with it see that's no one insane that you was a cult if he was in a big pen I said that don't mean a thing you see that is where it comes self-righteous that's against our faith I said we don't want Divine Healing our church that kind of stuff that's against our faith I said but there's only one Faith there's only one Lord there's only one fate sin there's only one sin that's unbelief praise the name of the Lord so there's a door in the heart that door is a door of feet and so many professed Christians don't want to open that door of Faith you said Lord you can come in that's right but I do believe that all the Bible is right I will take what my church says I won't take the rest of it how can he be your lord and healer if you can't get your heart door of feet to open so even Christians have the faith door closed the hearing gospel but they're not applying the word to themselves the
