your Divine authority to speak better things for us than we could ever speak for ourselves Lord we are unworthy to stand here in your presence but Lord your blood made our way possible Your Grace made it possible your mercy has made it possible we stand naked in your presence Lord as Isaiah stood as a prophet he thought he was okay until he came into presence Lord and in lord your presence he said wo is me he saw something he didn't see before because Lord your presence makes everything plain Lord your presence uncovers everything Lord and we are so grateful this morning that we could be in your house and be in your presence that you could speak to us that we could look into the mirror of the word Lord and see the word being in formed the word image being in formed that shaped as your servant brother Anthony spoke last week Wednesday Lord father we are here this morning looking for more shaping some more molding some more cutting some more changing Lord until what we see reflected is a stature of a perfect man Lord may you bless us as we go into your word this morning may you walk out of the pages of the Bible may you break chains and shackles Lord may you restore and bring comfort and peace Father may you take me out of the way completely and speak directly to your needy children father we commit the service into your hands and the reading of the word into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ you appreciate the song service this morning weing the musicians amen so if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading from The Book of Genesis and reading from the book of Jeremiah Genesis 1 and Jeremiah 1 reading Genesis 1 and reading verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God made so God created man in his own image in the image of God created him male and female created he them reading Jeremiah 1 reading from verse 4 brother Gideon reading Jeremiah 1 verse4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen what a time to be in the presence of the Lord we see the world falling apart we see the economic system failing the political system failing the health system failing the scientific system is failing and you know over the last few Services brother ID has uh spoken about the all the artificial intelligence and these things and I saw an article this week that there are some scientists who are a bit concerned because uh the they have now realized that artificial intelligence can now confuse humans and trick humans and they seem to be starting to have somewhat of a mind of its own so it's quite an interesting time that we are living in and I was sharing with my wife how the same way we have gotten used to living with the refrigerator and these technology that artificial intelligence and these things are becoming more of a way of life and within this context of the normalization of technology and these things all the way back to Genesis when they try to build a tower to reach to the heavens man is building to his own destruction he's building to his own demise it will seem convenient but within that convenience has its own challenges and we see as brother brandham typed out when there was the horse and buggy age and the car age and the and the the aerplane age and now we're in the astronaut age he said that the church is moving too slowly you know and we see the unfolding of the natural and we know that the natural types spiritual so there's a lot that's happening now and more than ever we live in a world of of Crisis you know there's economic crisis there's Health crisis there's financial crisis there's there's military crisis you know we are somewhat sheltered from some types of Crisis here on this small island but if you live in the Middle East or certain other countries where you wake up in the night because there's a bomb exploding around the corner it's a different kind of life that you liveing but to every single person on the earth they have their own form of a crisis to come or a form of Crisis to deal with family crisis marital Crisis crisis with the school the education system a crisis on your job and that's the nature of life it's mountains and valleys and through it all we have to learn to trust in the Lord and knowing that God is in control of all these things so we thank the Lord for his grace because I believe that now more than ever we have to rely on the who we are in God not rely on our thinking our imagination our reason ing our own understanding of things but it is more important than ever before to be grounded in who we are in the Lord because our comfort comes from who we are our faith comes from who we are our identity comes from who we are so may the Lord richly bless you to uh this morning how many appreciate by Anthony's message last Wednesday what a tremendous message from the Lord I was not brother Anthony speaking that was the Lord speaking to his bride and I'm under great expectation for God to do something special for us this morning so thank you so much for being here this morning both those who are here live and those who are connected online so for a title this morning the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity can the church say Amen you know you're a mystery right Hallelujah sometime you're a mystery even to yourself but on the very simplest levels brother Nathaniel you're a mystery to the world you're a mystery to your family you're mystery to your company and you're sometime you're a mystery to yourself you're not a mystery to God because God is the one who created the mystery but you are a mystery not just any kind of a mystery you are a Divine mystery there's the mystery of the stars and the Mystery of the earth and the Mystery of gravity and all these things that is they discovered over time these were natural Mysteries Hallelujah but there there's also a Divine mystery Divine as in desided by God thought of by God planned by God unfolded by God and there's nothing that you could do about it there's nothing that the devil could do about it there's nothing your family could do about it there's nothing your past could do about it it is part of a Divine mystery a Divine story is unfolding Hallelujah he's the author and he's the finisher and the story of your life has already been written you are walking through the pages of a story that has already been written the conclusion of your story has already been written the final chapter of your story has already been written your story ends with shaking David's hand and your story ends with shaking Joshua's hand and your story ends with you dancing and shouting the end of your story doesn't have gray hair in your head the end of your story doesn't have any sickness in your body the end of your story doesn't have your high blood pressure higher than it should be in fact you won't even be dealing with high blood pressure or low blood pressure the end of your story doesn't have a natural pest House of a body the end of your story is a Eternal being that rotated off of the presence of God the end of your sto oh you don't hear me this morning and even that statement but the thumbs about the end of your story is itself a mystery because you have no ending it's the natural story I'm talking about but you come from God and you're going back to God you are an eternal being trapped in time Hallelujah and one day time has to let you go time has to free you from this prison of time to get back into eternity only in time is sickness only in time is depression only in time is the bills and all these things but you are really an eternal being you are bigger than time you are more powerful than your circumstance you are bigger than your situation in your story there's no depression there's no frustration that's a product of time but you are a creature of Eternity Hallelujah you may not know it you may not recognize it but that's all right because there's nobody who was born who understood their purpose until God revealed it to them Hallelujah it took the revealer to reveal to each individual their purpose nobody was born knowing who they were it took a revelation from the revealer himself to make it known unto each individual what they were born to do what they were born to achieve here is God in the scripture we read to Jeremiah then the word of the Lord came unto me saying in other words Jeremiah you don't even know but I want you to know before I formed the in the [Applause] belly before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee I'm not now getting to know you I'm now now getting to meet you I'm not now looking at you on this Sunday morning but before you were formed in the belly I already knew you I know what you'd want to eat and know what you'd go through and know your struggles and before thou camest out of the womb I sanctify thee Hallelujah and I ordain thee to be a prophet unto the [Applause] Nations do you understand that you are part of the same genealogy you are part of the same lineage you are part of this same DNA before you were formed in the belly God knew you hle and he put you in this age he put you in this day Hallelujah Glory [Applause] put you in this day Young Brother put you in this day young sister that no matter what family you came from in a natural you come from a Heavenly family Hallelujah you are related to Joshua you are related to David oh Hallelujah related to Moses you're related to Abraham you're related to the to Peter and James and John hallelujah our natural birth put us here in Trinidad but our spiritual birth brings our true connection to our true family we belong to a kingdom we belong to God we belong to a Heavenly oh you don't hear me this morning oh hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm not relying I'm not speaking to your natural bird this morning I'm not speaking to who your natural father is your natural mother I'm speaking about a change that comes to the inside a change oh it changes your expectation it changes your hopes it changes your desires it changes your expectations it changes your appetite the things you used to do you don't want to do them no more because you're coming into a greater realization of who you are you are coming to a recognition that you are royalty Hallelujah I said in Nigeria that when Prince Charles or Prince Harry when they were born they didn't know who they were they just born like any baby but after a while somebody tells them you know your grandma is the queen you know your father is a prince you can't do that know because of who you are and you need to do that because of who you are because of who you are you have extra security because of who you are the food is already made for you but when you get up in the morning you don't need to cook no food because of who you are because of who you are you have clothes that already taken care of because of who you are there's land already in your name the moment you were born your name was written there you didn't have to do anything for it it was because of who who you are just because you were born into this family you have certain benefits certain privileges certain expectations certain promises certain entitlements certain things will happen to you just because you don't have to earn it just because you don't have to fight for it just because you don't have to save money for it but just because just because your father is a king just because your mother is a queen [Applause] Hallelujah and I'm here to remind you Church of the Living God this morning just because of who you are there's land ready for you just because of who you are there's an inheritance for you just because of who you are healing is yours just because of who you are the Holy Ghost is yours just because of who you are adoption is yours just because of who you are Perfection is yours hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah that is by [Music] Design I shared in Nigeria said listen I'm not into the politics but the royal family has worked to try to disown Harry to some extent because of his choice in marriage they stripped some kind of military title from him they but but the reality is nothing they do could take the media off of him because of who he is they could pull piece of the land or the title but the reality he's still a son he make bad decisions in their books but he's still a son if they could have erased the fact that he was born in the family maybe they could do it but they can't do it because he was born into the family and many of us we have made mistakes but you know what we've been ped family you might have lost this you might have lost this you might have lost that you might have lost this but you were born into the family and the devil oh come on now he wish he could take your name but your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life In The Blood section can the church say [Applause] Amen it's more important brother she to have faith in your account and money in your account it's more important to have joy in your account and money in your account because the joy of the Lord is your strength the faith of the Lord or the faith in the Lord could take care of with the doctor the biggest doctor bill that you could ever have that money could try to address put Faith to deal with the bill and what's Faith bypass the bill go to the problem and heal you in your body that the bill is no longer necessary and it's because of who you are it's your spiritual [Applause] identity listen when the children of Israel left Egypt they really didn't have a big relationship with God in know they had been in bondage for so long that they had lost certain things but God said because you are my people when you walk your shoes wouldn't go down when he get sick I'll put a rod there and put sinks around rod and when you look and you could look and you could live he know was all kind of Believers in there but because of who they were he said I put I put put food for you every single day can the church say Amen what is it it's a Divine mystery it's a Divine mystery that's why you could be happy when the devil expected to be sad you know what reasons you have this morning to be upset punch much reasons if they asking much reasons you have to be upset and frustrated and upset you could come up with a whole list but I could guarantee you if you're right all your problems on on one side and look on the other side and turn the page I had to write all the benefits and the blessings I could guarantee you you will find more on the side of blessing than the side to complain you know that song Count Your Blessings name them one by one when last you count your blessings and you name them Lord I Thank you for waking me up that itself is a blessing I could lift my hands in the house of God that itself accounting that one too accounting the fact that you put my name on the book oh you don't hear me this morning accounting the fact that I could sing I might sing the best but I could sing and accounting that blessing too can the church say amen I thank God for my family I thank God for the Holy Ghost I thank God for salvation I thank God for the prophet I thank God for the message I thank God for the church I thank God for the pastor I thank God for every trial send my way to form and to shape and to cut and to mold I'm just talking to the church this morning just encourage you along this life's journey because it's a Divine mystery God could have done it in many different ways I talked about Matthew 8 and Matthew 14 how God unfolding this divine mystery to his own disciples because he is preparing them for tough days ahead and I've said before if you don't become unbreakable life will break you so the training we go through in life is for us to become unbreakable we need to be flexible enough that we can move without breaking so Paul say to the strong I became strong to the weak I became weak he said I know what it is to have and I know what it is to not have and in all this thing are giving God thanks so he not letting no money in his pocket affect his Joy his praise His worship he not allow allow his environment well it's because of this is why I'm not in church and because of this is why he seeing me no he has become unbreakable nothing can move him nothing could shake his feet though this person walk away this person nothing because he's not in church for the people he's in church to meet the Lord his faith is not in his office his faith is in who he is can the church say amen and okay if you're Deacon Usher Minister it doesn't matter your confidence in God is Not based on your position your title it's based on your identity because the title and the position comes based on your identity if you are not in the family you can't get anything that's why when you're in the body there's a measure of Grace for you in the body [Music] and by one Spirit we are baptized into the body our place in the body is by Spirit not by attendance but by Spirit can the church say Amen can you take some more this morning I'm still warming up from the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed but the bandam said now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak onto the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we are living amen then you'll understand clearly this mystery of God friends this mystery of God cannot be found in a university it cannot be found by reading academic exploits and academic books this mystery comes to you by an interaction and an encounter with the revealer of the mystery it comes from an experience with the Lord himself and that has been one of the biggest challenges we have is that people don't know the Lord they know the church they know scriptures but to know him is life to have a relationship with him is life and if you ever meet him then it doesn't matter what anybody else does because he reveals himself to you whether you're sick whether you're up whether you're down your relationship with him supersedes everything else that revelation of who you are is what makes you stand under pressure isn't that right young people it makes you dress a certain way it makes you speak a certain way it makes you live a certain way it makes you resist what the enemy presents to you because of who you are that recognition of who you are says you cannot do certain things I heard an interview with President Obama when he was in office or he was speaking about when he was in office and he said as the President of the United States he was he was not allowed to drive because the office required a certain type of driver he can't just Ops and get up and I go for a spin so he had to adjust his behavior because his office required him to live a certain way he can't feel say drish and he related a scenario where one of the officers on the White House property got an electric vehicle and he said he saw it he liked it he say can I can I test drive it so the officer said well go ahead he said the moment he stepped in that vehicle and start to move a little bit this is on the grounds of the White House Secret Service lock down lock down they say he couldn't get to move far because he was out of his office because of the office do you know that if the president his life is in danger and he say well I want to go into the Danger The Secret Service is authorized to knock him out unconscious and move him out of the danger he wanted be brave heart he want to be some hero and run into danger they say no you need to go down in the bunker we have soers for that so if natural man could put things in place to protect a natural office against themselves what do you think God will do to protect do you realize that you are the royalty on the earth more Royal than the you I don't think I I don't think you get what I'm saying this morning man sitting on and putting measures in place to protect the bloodline of royal families in the Dutch in the the Spanish the English and all these traditional monarchies do you realize you're part of a monarchy and there's a king of kings and that King of Kings says that you are Kings and Priests and that you are going to rign on the earth and because you're going to Reign on the earth there are certain powers that are given to you that whatever you bind on Earth Bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth is lo in heaven that if you will pick up deadly things it wouldn't harm you because of who you [Music] are so how could somebody in royal family end up drunk on some corner somewhere you trying to sneak out the White House you trying to sneak out because you you want to go and meet some friend and because your royalty you have to I want to speak to the young people can I talk to the young people a little bit and it might apply to some many calebs too who not fully sure of their identity their spiritual identity there's a reason they write speeches for presidents and kings and monarchs and thing because they want to make sure they don't just say anything because your words could start a war your words could end a war your words your words are powerful where you go who you meet with your conduct your etiquette you where you dress your mannerisms you go to different countries different count different norms and Customs so there's a protocol officer who's there to prep the president when you go into this country don't extend your hand this way they bow this way they do this because all this is conduct befitting an officer and the word comes to us to shape us but the Anthony says to mold us so no matter what situation is you conduct yourself in a way yeah that speaks to the office that you are in we are all in an office we all have a role to play and when you are in your school on your job you are walking in the office can the church say amen I heard a brother say yesterday that we are ambassadors of the kingdom and when an ambassador Walks In A Country he is representing the country he represents the US Embassy in Trinidad is America in Trinidad and the Trinidad Embassy in the next country is Trinidad in that next country that's why if you are in a foreign country and there's a Trinidad Embassy there you could be running for your life the moment you cross into your Embassy nobody could follow you because that ground of the embassy is the ground of the country even though you're in another country it's recognized and respected as such and they have to say well you are under the custody of your government can the church say Amen there's diplomatic immunity because of who you are not to do the wrong thing but to realize that you are an Untouchable because you are being represented by another nation and here we are representing an eternal Kingdom in a Time Kingdom and I know you don't realize it but you have diplomatic immunity all you have to do is get on the safe ground of your Embassy and when you touch your Embassy all these soldiers all the this is why you have to be on your ground your Embassy is not the club you have no protection when you go to the club oh you don't hear me this morning now you now I want you to connect the dots when you go to Carnival F that's not your ground you are off of your protection but when you are in your environment when you're in your safe place the devil have to watch you but he can't touch you he said put the blood on the doorpost and when I see the blood I'll pass over you the enemy can't come onto your ground that's why you stay away from from Shady places listen look back through history there are very few if any instances of embassies that have been invaded by other countries it don't just happen like that because it triggers global war if the Russians try to enter the US Embassy in Russia you know much problem that is because the whole host of the government all the warships go on Red Alert because they don't want to cross the line to say if the American has made it to their Embassy we can't touch them if they step out the embassy they fair game pick them up so they're waiting around the corner they're looking around this side if you slip up and get out that's that's on you but if you stay inside your Embassy and you go under the authority of your protectors then no devil could come near you and I want to encourage you this morning stay on your safe ground don't go onto the enemy's ground unless God says to go that's why David asked the question shall I pursue he said because Lord if I don't get a word I'm not moving I want to stay on my safe ground and David put on the ephod and David began to pray to the Lord he said the enemy came to our ground and took our our eyes and he said Lord shall I pursue and God tell him pursue in other words if I give you the permission to pursue then the host of the armies of the Lord are with you then no weapon formed against you could Prosper no demonic attack could prosper no devil could stop you because you have Divine Authority by a Divine mystery based on your spiritual identity to go into the devil's camp and take back what the devil stole from [Music] [Applause] [Music] you brother brandham gave the story of the young lady who was delivered and she went back into the barn and Spirit came back upon her why you trying to expose yourself do you understand that the music you listen to the places you go the conversations you have the movies you watch the books you read the clothes you dress all these things have an impact on the ground you represent if you have never thought about it that way and you know this gospel to be the truth recognize that you as an individual are an ambassador for the kingdom your words represent a kingdom the way you rest represent a kingdom where you go represent a kingdom not your mother's house not your father's house but your heavenly father there are many people who will Who are looking to see Jesus and the only Jesus they will see is the Jesus in you your testimony could change someone's life your humility could change someone's life your prayer life supposed to change somebody's life your humility your forgiveness your purity your desire to serve God supposed to radiate something that the enemy knows that this is somebody different they have been touched by the Master's Hand they come from God and they're going back to God can the church say Amen it's a hunger for Holiness it's a cry for Purity it's a [Applause] desperation you represent a kingdom why do your fingers look like that you represent a kingdom why does why why why does your hair look like that is that the kingdom should I keep driving or should I some people say reverse some people say drive in every Church three kinds of Believers you know but I only have one Authority this morning to speak what the Lord put upon my [Applause] heart because when President Obama went to the car he was in his Joy of a electric vehicle you know he didn't think it was wrong but his secret service was there to say you can't do that to know and so too the tutor the Holy Ghost is here to say you can't do that to know you might want to do it you might desire to do it but because of who you are you cannot do it because of who you are that music you like you can't listen to it maybe it was part of what you did but not because of this office because you're in this office because you're in this office because you are son of King because you are daughter of the king the things you used to do you cannot do them no more the conversations you used to have you cannot have them no more you can't say the first thing come to your mind because you're in our office your words have gravity if you shall say to this mountain that the kind of words that he canot powering you everybody to P your words up powerful I was having a conversation with someone and they're speaking about the fact that your words are so powerful so you don't say I am sick you don't speak that words the doctor say is a big difference you know the doctor report saying something but I say I'm Healed by his stripes I'm [Applause] Healed your words are powerful that's why let you weak say you're strong you don't have to accept what is said or there are others some say Jesus say what who do you say I am what is your testimony what is your declaration what is the words that coming out your mouth people say so much negative things about themselves yeah but I want to encourage you this morning the negative things you say doesn't change your identity you could be a depressed son you're still a son you could be a weak son you're still a son you could be a son who has lost their purpose but you're still a son you're still a daughter you lost your way like The Prodigal Son the fact that he was eating pig food but the George didn't change the fact that he was a son he was a messed up son but he was still a son and we have some messed up sons and some messed up daughters but it doesn't change the fact that you are still a son still a daughter and God is here to restore listen I had no plans to see this this morning but if this is for somebody I don't know who it's for then I pray to God that you get a revelation of who you are whose you are and you walk out of whatever prison has you bound can the Church Say Amen Hall so Because of Who You Are Young Brother young sister don't follow the Playbook of the world because they are following their playbook their dreams their hopes their ambition their dress their fashion their Styles the societal pressure the social media influence these things will destroy your faith can the church say amen God is a mystery and because you are part of God you are also a mystery God in his great desire to express himself We Know It This is not new to us God has existed alone he was the self-existent one he couldn't even be called God because there was nobody to worship him we know this so when when God created the angels and they start to say holy holy holy are you Lord then God becames God because God means object of worship so is he your God if you're not worshiping that's why I said worship has nothing to do with you praise you praise God for what he has done but worship is based on who he is so you praise him because he help you with a job but you worship God because he is God you worship God because he is bigger than your problem you worship God because he is God he is all by himself though he slay me yet I'll trust him but he is still God and he is the object of worship worship him when you're sad worship him when you're happy worship Him in the morning worship him in the evening worship him when you can't see your way you still worship the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity God wanted to express himself an omnipotent God an omnicient God an all powerful God had to find a way to express a Divine mystery all the books in the world could not contain him he was just too big too powerful he could do anything he's too Sovereign you could write and write and still can't write enough about him but God always wanted to express himself he didn't want to remain a mystery the mystery of God was so great God had to take centuries to slowly reveal himself layer after layer page after page story after Story son after son daughter after daughter all part of the expression of God hallelujah God put man in the Garden of Eden as an expression of himself but that man couldn't even express all that God was because God couldn't Express who he was to that man until that man fell oh you don't hear me this morning he was just a father to Adam but when Adam fell he became more than a father oh you can I say that one more time he was a father to Adam but when Adam fell now we could be a SA avor now we could be a redeemer now we could be a restorer now we could be a deliverer and sometime God send us through some stuff to be more to us than he was to us before some of us if you never got sick you don't know him as a Healer oh you don't hear me this morning I don't think you hear me this morning if you never knew sickness you would never know him as your healer you could always say he you know you healed that person but when you went through sickness now you can say the Lord is my healer when you go through weakness you can say the Lord is my refuge he is my strength when you go through crisis he hides me in his pilion not he hides my brother or my sister this is now my testimony oh you don't hear me this morning David could now say the Lord is my shepherd maybe he was brother pun Shepherd but now he's my shepherd because as a sheep I know what it was to be lost and God found me oh you don't hear me this morning he becomes a personal God it becomes your testimony so don't look at your trials and your situations as as poor me no this is God's ability now for you to write more about him that is your personal testimony So Daniel could say he was there with me in the fire in in in the Lions then listen some of us have to work in our testimony to meet Daniel and and the Hebrew boys and them know we need bigger trials to get bigger testimonies can I say that one more time the woman who was about to cook the last meal She Was preparing to say let me cook my last meal then we're going to just die and then Elijah happened to pass that way and say bake me a cake first and she had a testimony I was just here about to cook my last meal to bake me a cake first and for three and a half years whenever she dipped for meal there was meal when she dipped for oil you know what her test for Years brother you know what a testimony was this food never run out to no in the famine God found a way to Min that was now her testimony and you know the Bible say they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony So Young Brother young sister you have to have a testimony of how you overcame and what you overcame so don't look at me when you have a trial or a test or a situation it is a reason for you to build a testimony and for God to be more to you in that particular area than he was to you before can the church say Amen so God in his great plan could we could we take some more I haven't even gotten the message yester now I'm on page four of 25 and I have two other sections pursue I like that God want to express himself he wants to express himself in your marriage he wants to express himself in your situation on your job he wants to express himself in your business he wants to express himself in your school he wants to express himself when you're back against a wall and you feel like a run out of options he wants to express himself as God to you this great message that came through this great prophet messenger of Malachi 4 is not for us to be caught in a mystery that can't relate to this world is for the mystery to become flesh to deal with the situations that come our way to deal with the frustrations and the but man PR message why are we so tossed about and letting off the pressure this message is to let off the pressure this message you to live life with a smile with a confidence that when you don't have it all figured out he does God didn't want to a mystery the mystery of God was so great God took centuries to slowly reveal himself he didn't want to be complicated he didn't want to be misunderstood he didn't want you to need a degree to understand him that's why he could take a simple uneducated prophet and bring the greatest mystery and tab all he Loose Ends but bam had no big education but God could take a simple man this is a simple message people want to make it complicated but it's a simple message sir he wanted anybody to talk to him that's why when the veil was Ren from top to bottom it was to allow you to have Divine access you didn't have to go to anybody you could access the Lord yourself because you were a son or daughter you don't have to go to the priest you don't have to go to a father you can say Lord here I am I'm in trouble I'm messed up I made a mistake I want to be restored heal me touch me reconcile me help me God had to find a way to take this mystery of who he was and bring it into simplicity and throughout scripture I've preached this before but I really want this to resonate with you in the middle of your trial in the middle of your uncertainty and when you're back against the wall and you feel like giving up you recognize that none of those who went before knew at the point in time what they were unfolding they were all born just you don't realize Elijah David all them were born just like you and I without until they came to a full realization of who they were they had no clue more than that they died without even understanding the part of the story that they were playing because only when you look back you could see all the pieces connected didn't the prophet teach us that all of those Heroes of Fate Heroes of old they didn't know what they were living out God spoke lip to air to Moses and Moses went on without seeing the whole picture the whole mystery unfold because God they couldn't show him the whole mystery yet still God as a deliverer in expressing himself as a deliverer used Moses to display that attribute of a deliverer so if you want to see what a deliverer looks like and what God as a deliverer looks like just look at Moses that's a reflection all peace of God the same material of God but it's a peace of God because Moses was not God but God was in Moses can the church say Amen when God wanted to express himself as a shepherd He gave us David as a Shepherd the same material he was a part of God an expression of God an expression of the thought of God for his day and his time but when you begin to connect Moses to David and you bring the shepherd and the deliverer together you get a closer picture of how God is can the church say Amen when God wanted a warrior he look at Joshua he say who best exemplifies Warrior he said let me find somebody and he found Joshua he said Joshua I want you to be a warrior take the people over into the promised land wherever you put your foot every inch that your foot shall tread upon that is your land as an example to us of what a warrior a conqueror a possessor looks like can the church say Amen when God wanted to find a prophet like a to himself here he is looking at Elijah we have five types of the prophet of Elijah throughout scripture can the church say amen and here it was Elijah wasn't God but God was in Elijah a piece of God an expression of God a gene of God all through scripture every single person expressing a part of God a mystery of God an expression of God can the church say Amen but when Jesus came he wasn't a part of God he wasn't a piece of God he wasn't an attribute he was God himself all of the mystery that was laid out through all the Ages was finally wrapped up in a body called Jesus he was the mystery of God himself revealed Hallelujah he was the wheel in the middle of the wheel he was the great shepherd He was the Savior the Redeemer the master the priest the prophet he was the king all wrapped up in one all that was in God was pour into Christ and because of that Christ because of that Messiah because of the Lord Jesus Christ all that was in him is now poured into us so we can continue the expression of God on the earth God will always have a witness in David's day he was the witness in Moses day he was the witness in Joshua's day he was the witness and in our day I'm looking at the witness this morning I'm looking at the expressions of God the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity Hallelujah a mystery to your friends friends young people you know too much now to be able to fit into the world you know I preach this to the young people years ago you know too much you can't dance like the world you can't fit into the world you can't look like the world your best day and your best effort to try to fit in they know you don't belong there used to be some sing for the kids one of these things just don't belong there when you go into the world they can tell you don't belong there so stop kidding yourself as much as you try to fit in you a whole big eagle in a ban of a chicken when you walk you bouncing down things and you're trying to fit in you trying to be in a daily party everything falling on around you because you're too big you don't look like them you don't act like them your genan is different you an eagle you're not a [Applause] chicken the moment you leave your house you're looking different and they trying to fit in trying to wear worldly clothes music when they try to sing the worldly music your whole whole Eagle voice s sing them chicken songs you're not a chicken you your nails look like a chicken you your nails too big I'm trying to get a picture it he clar you are eager trying to wear a chicken mini skirt picture it you're an eagle you're not a chicken a eagle is a big strong burden chickens can't fly you know but you are Eagle you walking around there trying to look like the world act like the world and say but what wrong with you Bo trying to little chck chicken language chicken music and every time your whole voice your whole self you don't belong in the world you belong to God maybe you lost your way you know the story The Prophet gave the eagle found himself in The Bard and he look at the food he tried the food he tasty food he say this thing kind of okay but it's not giving me what I need what the chickens get excited about he tried to get excited too because that's what you you will do that the environment we say I just don't fit in it just don't feel like me I can't identify with this thing but then one day the mother Eagle who was looking for that eagle all along just screaming for that that eagle screaming and then he said what is that sound but that songing that song song like me and that mother Eagle screamed out I've been looking for you come on let's fly he say how do I fly I never fly before he said them big things that bouncing on everything just start to move it just start to worship just start to lift your hands and you'll find yourself start to fly start to rise above your situation rise above your problem rise above your temptation [Applause] can the church say Amen the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity I just want you to get it clear you do not belong to the world and it will never fit into the world and I want to encourage you parents in here this morning if your daughter or son is out in the world they don't fit in they all have to come right back just keep praying for that mother Eagle scream to reach them and they're going to come screaming back into the house of God because there's an uncoming storm and with it uncoming storm there's only one way out to fly into the storm and the Hawks and the chickens they can't go that high can the church say amen hallelujah somebody give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise Is this helping anybody this morning there's a simple thought to encourage you this morning along the journey to remind you because that's the that's the great thing H but the B said the moment that the bright gets to know who she is then the Raptor going to go so the whole journey of the word is about revealing who you are and like that great sculpture who sculpt uh was Michael Angelo also he said when he had a cut he was cutting away everything that was not David cutting away everything that was not Elijah cutting away everything that was not the image he wasn't trying to form the image he was cutting the image out from the Rock by cutting away everything that was not supposed to be there so when you begin to cut away the things that don't belong to the image what will be left will be the image can the church say Amen so when you cut away your envy and your lust and your backbiting and your no prayer life and your not in the word and all them things that to disappear is only one thing is going to be left it's a statue of a perfect man because we're cutting away everything that's a shaping that's going on Lord take away my Envy cut my lust cut my whatever it is take it away this morning morning oh my lack of Desire help me get back to F and desire to please you Lord I give you permission shape mold cut make this morning take everything out that doesn't belong my pride my ambition whatever it is cut it this morning let my desire only be your desire let your desire be the least of my command can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah so you are mysterious people we some sometimes try to explain in message to people and people just can't get it and they can't because your mystery and if it's not reveal to them that they can never get it but to you it's a revelation of how you're going to go to the Rapture for you it's a revelation of how you're going to get to the other side and access things like perfect love and charity you talk to your family about charity and perfect love and seven tunders and Dynamics and and shaping and forming of the word image not they look at you like you're crazy brotherly kindness on some of compassion and forming of the word image and dying out to yourself and this Mortal putting on immortality a body changer the rapt is on the inside you walk the street now and tell people the rapt is on the inside they're going to want to register you somewhere but nothing wrong with you nothing wrong with me it's a mystery it's a mystery to the world the reason your young s have to dress modest and stay pure and stay chased and these things it's it's confusing to the world but it's a mystery the reason why you're smiling and you just lost your job and you're still happy what is it it's a mystery they can't understand you can the church say Amen they don't get you can the church say amen amen Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets when you were saved friends that was only part of the mystery this is not a Pentecostal church this is not a a a Christian this is know that because Christianity is being Christlike we have to go beyond salvation Salvation is just a step you know when you came into the message that's only part of the mystery so you can't say well I'm saved and I'm in the message that's only part of the mystery of who you are your spiritual identity is more than you being being saved or in the message can I say that one more time your identity is bigger than being in the message or being saved you being here this morning is only part of the mystery because the unfolding of the mystery of who you are entitles you to Perfection and adoption you are not predestinated to Salvation you are predestinated to adoption that's scripture so do they St and say well I'm saved I'm saved save is ABC you know you have to go beyond salvation all the way to adoption and adoption is a power and authority speaking the word the your signature just as good as the father's signature now right now you're praying for your son but when that time come you speak and say come forth and like Lazarus whether they're dead or Not Dead or Alive they have to come Jesus already demonstrated it dead or alive but the B say the pillar of fire will rest on the shoulders of the pre oh the adopted Sons you are not predestinated to to Salvation you are predestinated to adoption that's the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity right now some of us we save some of us go to different thing but but your name should be this is a saved son this is a redeemed son this is an adopted son this is a perfect son but call it born son fill son play Sons that's the unfolding of your spiritual identity brother the Jo and when they reach that point and they look at you they recognize but wait a minute we thought Jesus dead because you know when Jesus died they thought he dead know until Peter walked by the gate called beautiful and he had walked there many times before but this time was different he must have reached in his pocket I don't know and he recognized he don't have anything he says silver and gold I don't have but such as I have this was his identity now he says such as I have he didn't say such as somebody else you know say such as I have it's part of me it is my identity because I have it I can give it to you oh come on now somebody preach back to me such as I have I give unto you rise up and walk Peter was in his identity he was in his place he was in his position and Bram taught us perfect faith is based on your [Music] position can the church say Amen when people see you they must see Christ in you it don't take no explanation it don't have business card to say you're adopted you no they will see they will take note that you B with Jesus they will know you're medip pillar fire they will know you have a prayer closet they will know you cut out the world they will know you living a Sanctified life they will know you cut out certain things because you have not come to a realization of who you are can the church say amen hallelujah come we take some more from the message Witnesses brother the ROM said Jesus Christ is in a building tonight to perform Miracles but he does it through his church his people he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they shall cast out evil spirits is that right the commission is given to the church that's what the matter with the church today it doesn't know its position so not knowing your position is not knowing your identity but the B said if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes can I say that one more time if you know positionally who you was and what you are can I preach a little bit is there anybody in the house this morning if you know who you are and what you are oh you are not just a human you are not just somebody walking the street if you know who you are that you are Son of God and what you are you are in the bride if you know who you are you are born for such a time as this and what you are you are predestinated for adoption if you know who you [Applause] are butam said in 5 minutes so when you look at this brother asby you can see why the enemy whole job and mission is to get you to think you somebody else it is why brother brand will preach a whole message called spiritual amnesia amen because people have forgotten who they are that's why God had to ask job job where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth and the morning star sang together he had to remind job job listen shake off the amesia I want you to remember that there was a war in heaven and you were there I want you to remember that the same power that kicked out the devil in heaven is on the earth now locked up in Sons and Daughters who don't yet know who they are but the power is there it's been lying dment God couldn't put Abraham in this day he couldn't put David in this day he couldn't put Joshua in this day he couldn't put Peter in this day he couldn't put Paul in this [Music] day and if he wanted to leave with a Bram longer he could have done it but he said but brandom all the Mysteries already revealed it's finished the final knockout punch I will leave it to a little lady an unassuming lady a lady who is undercover people don't know who she is she will have her ups and downs she'll have her struggles but at that time I'm going to come to her I'm going to visit her I'm going to reveal myself to her I'm going to identify her and she will identify me and he will say she is Flesh of My Flesh she is bone of my bone she is Spirit of my spirit seven spirits woo come on now [Applause] Church the mystery of all the ages wrapped up in a End Time Lady unassuming lady humble lady quiet lady gets up in the morning goes to work does what she has to do but in that lady is deity in that lady is the Lord Jesus Christ husband gets up and goes to work but locked up in that husband locked up in that brother locked up in that sister deity coming alive uh deity being made known God himself you are not producing it but God himself Hallelujah somebody give God a shout of Praise Hallelujah listen when a baby is conceived in that smallest form all the mother has to do is eat she doesn't have to think about it she have to decide well let the hand form now and let the foot form now and no no no no no no no it unveils itself it's just food it takes and that seed that that germ that that that that that that that that that that early stage knows what's next can I preach a little bit God designed it that way he made it that way no mother have to think it's time for the spinal cord and it's time for the eyes to form and it's time for the feet to form no all she has to do is eat and that germ knows what's next and we are here this morning to eat because that germ in you knows what's next that deity in you knows what's next oh you don't hear me this morning all you got to do is keep eating eat the book eat this word eat this message and that seed in you will produce Fai will produce virtue will produce knowledge will produce Temperance will produce it'll do it by itself oh you don't hear me this morning because every seed will bring for after its kind and I want to remind you this morning the Divine mystery of who you are is that in your spiritual identity is a seed that you didn't put there but the brandham taught us that you are not even the believer but the word in you The Germ in you the seed in you even when you were backslidden that seed was believing even when you fell in sin that word seed was believing you have to forgive me it's my [Applause] testimony I'm trying to find a place to close out woo it's Sunday morning brother Clarence brother clar say don't close out blame blame brother Clarence he say pursue so we pursu in until you get a revelation that there's no excuse for you to be sad there is no excuse for you to be depressed there is no excuse for you to be frustrated I don't care what your husband did what your boss did what the government did what your neighbor did it doesn't matter there's a seed in you that's greater than the world there's a power in you that's greater than your situation bigger than your sickness bigger than your financial problem bigger than your family problem bigger than your lust problem bigger than your sin is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element Still Remains despite this Revelation so you are a mystery it means you are scripture previously hidden so you are the expression of scripture just like Mary was not named the Bible just said a virgin shall conceive and but Hugh it sat there for years nobody understood it it sounded crazy because craziness and mystery is closely connected every Prophet sounds crazy when Noah say it's going to rain it was going to sound crazy because it never rained before but when Isaiah say a virs shall see they say Isaiah just lost it but Here Comes Mary and Mary is born and that scripture lifts off of the Bible the scripture just raises off the Bible and the moment Mary is born sister oliv that scripture drops down above Mary Mary is going to school Mary is growing up and that scripture can't separate itself from Mary because she is the very manifestation of that scripture can the church say Amen when with the Bram was born the scripture Malachi 4 5 and six lifted off of the scripture found its way to Kentucky found itself over a prophet St Luke 17:30 raised up from the scripture Revelation 10 raised up from the scripture and they all came in one place because somebody was on the earth who was a manifestation of their scripture I wonder this morning what happened when you were born wo what happened when you were born I'm here to tell you when you were born all kinds of scriptures start to fly off the Bible every scripture that could not have been identified was finally being identified [Applause] the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity it's really powerful when you think about it God told Abraham your people my people will s journ in a Strange Land and with a mighty hand I'll bring them out that Mighty hand had a name his name was Moses Hallelujah and when the Bible say the spirit and the bride would say come that bride oh Hallelujah that bride when you were born that bride that's where you fit right there the spirit and the prde will have the same voice will say the same thing the spirit the prophet and the bride because the prophet brid scripture to the bride the prophet connect the secret Mysteries to the bride the prophet reveal every mystery for the bride so we could plainly see what is to happen we have not believed cunningly devis favors but we are walking on scripture we are standing on scripture we are protected by scripture touch not my anointed do my prophets know [Applause] how from the message beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation see we come out of Eternity you have to forgive me but Tony this food eating nice today today's double service but this food eating nice we come out of Eternity you mean I didn't come from maraval or Deo Martin or Porter Spain or Maro or shonas or we come out of Eternity we was before there was a world did you know that God made man in his own image we read the scripture where was you he said to Job when job thought he had some wisdom he said where was you when I laid the foundation of the world before I laid it when the sons of God sang together and The Morning Star shouted for Joy the Morning Star shouted for Joy them shining ones shouted for Joy when they seen that someday through a tabernacle here on Earth and the King MDC would come in a righteous of God and give his life to redeemers to God back again and outshine the Stars forever can the church say Amen your identity your identity is who you are it's your characteristics it's how you are known there are some people by the laugh you know them by the walk you know them but said last week some people that he said everybody lights up a room some people light up the room when they walk in some people the moment they walk out the room get bright but everybody lights up a room how do you light up a room do you light up a room when you walk in or do you light up a room when you go on to say oh gosh glad Go yes now let me talk because your energy so heavy and when you there Place tight or when you walk in they City the the thing now start that's your identity some people are known for being sad some people are happy to be I'm a pessimist some people some people are proud to be I'm a realist T I just see things for what they are they just some people they they have no lid for their mouth you know them they just know them they don't Le for the mouth some people when they're supposed to talk they're not talking it's your identity your characteristics it's your abilities your nature your potential your realizations your achievements your failures your victories your ups and downs is all part of your identity your identity is a real you I'm trying to find a place to close up but uh thank God for cl parents the identity is you real you I always say it you real you is when nobody else around is he in church oh go as if we had the Oscar and the Grammys and thing if they really come here we we we win you know we have good actors and good performers you know God bless you shake your hand and think normal normal I love you brother watch now and ni just performance you know performance that we have it locked down I don't think anybody else can compete people come and dress up for church on Sunday morning and but God help you if you see them on a Tuesday is a whole different person and the problem with that that's why you call identity crisis you're in crisis you already here it has people they leave the house husband and wife leave the house smiling watch now when I tell you is work it's work to acting acting is working because after by when the hours pass so and you get tired of acting then some point be really you show up that's why companies have probation because you could act for a week or two weeks three weeks but after 6 months probation some point in time over that six Monon probation you really would have show up Hall I remember when before I got married but a h came and give me some advice I hope I could say it but you I don't but you remember the advice you give me this is before I Get Married the elders speaking to the the Juniors you tell me but Isaac make sure you know how she is when she get angry whether he was don't know if you remember tell because CU When You're cting and thing people just put their best when I tell you their best foot if was your right foot the right foot all the way out but after they tie the nut then they see the left foot because at some point in time the real you will'll always show up and the thing about it is and this is where it gets interesting it is easy to mask who you are when things are going well because when things are going well you're not under the pressure of the external world or the inside world but under pressure the real you always appear and under pressure it's only when you could see things about yourself that you didn't even know was there and we have many examples in scripture just take the prodical Sun but preach a whole message on this the older brother up until the younger brother returned had a certain testimony in church you know fine Brother this brother is a blessed brother Deacon in the house of the Lord always there everything was fine when he younger brother went and think he shine even more more he's the one who stay in church he faithful faithful unto the Lord then young people and them is trouble young brother gone and I sure the older brother felt good but I still standing my poster Duty I just want to have testimony to thank God that I still had my poster Duty you know how those who stayed a songer but when the younger brother come that day is the day the Deon come late to church and he say what is that noise going on in the Tabernacle they say well your brother come back he said the Rascal and where where the cow that was chain up there where the Cal the calf was there last week somebody moved the Cal wa who who which did did he had Deon say move C well they say your father killed the calf he said the fatted one the one I was feeding for this last few years and he say I'm not going any service the Deacon didn't make it inside because under the pressure of and this wasn't this wasn't losing money losing car losing a job this was somebody being celebrated that was not him you see that situation this wasn't a sick my wife in the hospital this wasn't none of that you know this this is somebody come back to church who was not in church and I'm going say I'm not going inside all this time I hear they kill one calf a small calf the Big Calf that I was feeding they going to kill that for this Rascal the father have to go outside and say listen W to you all that I have is yours I need to tell you that you've been faithful oh go celebrate with your [Music] brother and that situation showed something in the older brother that had to be a addressed and many times situations come to us for us to know what we need to address it happens between mother daughter father brother sister employee coworker and God help us because some of us in the workplace we have no testimony because a testimony your identity is supposed to be your permanent character whether you're in the workplace whether that's said I respect the garbage collector I respect the male man that's the prophet's words he said if you don't respect the man I disrespect the office all this he taught us because is the way he lived and we are being challenged now to adopt and realize and walk in our true spiritual identity because it comes with an expectation of a certain kind of behavior you talk nice to the Casher you talk nice but your wife forget it greeting sister in church God bless you God bless you your wife God bless who I'm not talking to anybody in the church I'm just painting a picture of what not to do versus what to do but if the cap float around and fall anywhere and it fall on your head let it let it fit nicely so you could address the issue because we want to have the spiritual identity to make it to the other side it might sound somewhat comical but the reality is this gospel this message is to really produce a behavior change after all is said and done if your behavior a change have you really met the Lord because there are people who have sat with the books and tapes for decades and the behavior changed for 40 years 30 years 20 years 10 years and but Bram himself said he could preach blue till you BW to the face until it's revealed to you for you to do something about it because I can come into your house and deal with it from where I sit there certain things I can see brother Anthony but over but stepen the ministry God gives us ises certain things I and you imagine even the prophet but the brandham stood there seeing spirits issues challenges on the people and he still have to deal with them a certain way Jesus knew what Judas was and Jesus with his identity say whatever you do do quickly he even expose him man you say gun from here and just go and finish just go and no go and do what you do you don't know stabing remember back all the time and Jesus not pray them thought he was going to buy more bread because he didn't let out any animosity and we have heard it said about brother random you couldn't tell his enemy from his friends some of us we know who your enemy is you don't even discern you don't even need discernment there's some things we need say we don't even need we know who your enemy is and we know who your friends are what will it take for us to reach a level of maturity that that you begin to treat everyone like a child of God with love with Mercy with Grace that's why we preach don't write off anybody do you know when Paul was converted them brothers read the Bible had a problem with Paul and these are things that have to be addressed in the church because Paul was Saul who was killed brother Steven who was the Deacon them brothers brother Tony had some serious them other deacons so your comrade Brothers like this brother now come we know God to save everybody here but bearing witness with this one because they the Bible said they had a problem with him and here it was this is the first star of the ages the messenger to the Ephesians Church the one who could speak and could say withstood Peter to the face and Peter had to back down because the rules Peter wanted to implement from the Jews didn't apply to the Gen and Paul say hold your hands and his brothers had to be SP spiritual enough to put aside their differences and have respect for one another and it shows the need for a maturing and that's why at the end of the day we realize we still really need to grow up you know we need to grow up that's the real issue we need to grow up as children and even as adults because we have reach anything yet we will always be learning Paul could say I Die daily in other words daily every day I'm finding something I need to fix I approach it wrong and it takes a big man and a big woman to say I'm sorry I didn't mean it that way I didn't get it that way even the prophet made his own mistakes and God say you can't do you have to make things right and told the prophet you need to be more sincere oh God help me if God can tell the prophet you need to be more sincere I can't even stand up in the book so it's an encouragement to us to be more sensitive to our spiritual identity and for us to really grow beyond the simpler things oh gosh you're still fighting up with clothes and ha and first year you have first year second year then standard one then to standard five then secondary school and then University and then work how long you stay in first year you still fighting up with yeah really have to cover really to cover my knees when I was a child I speak as a child I act as a child a child but when I became a man I put away childish things we talking about possessing The Inheritance the Holy Ghost Land we talking about dealing with not the outer man anymore the outer man is easy the Bible say bring your body under subjection we didn't know with the inner man is the harder project you know but say the Philistines is them inner them inner issues the real issues you know none the things on the outside are we we trying to get beyond that young people to get to the man on the inside to put the Holy Ghost on the control tower of the heart because that's what happened to Peter when ananas and Safa came they didn't meet Peter no more the Holy Ghost was on Peter's Throne so Peter was talking but it wasn't Peter talking it was the angel of the Lord and then he say didn't lie unto me if it was me I might to give you a BL but you lie to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost makes his own decisions on how to deal matters in the church so this is for us to be sensitive because it's going to come a day when the man of God will step behind the pulpit and it could be anybody it could be brother Anthony brother Steven brother Gideon brother over s anybody and it's no longer the minister speaking is the pillar of fire has taken his seat and say you haven't lied to me but the Holy Ghost dealing with you he promised that judgment will begin where in the sanctuary checking your attitude your approach he say enter into his gates with Thanksgiving enter into his court with praise leave your cares and your issues by the door you need to get pray the door ask the Deon say pray for me before you walk inside but come into the house of God with a desire Lord I want to be changed I want to be transformed we all have issues Jesus came and said they that are well have no need of a physician but I come to those that are broken I come to those that have struggles I come and he said come unto me all ye who are Laden and heavy laden and I will give you rest Amad over so beautifully preached it he said my yoke is easy and my burden is light the Bible never said there's no yoke and there's no burden there is a yoke there is a burden but my yoke is easy and my burden is light your office requires a certain Behavior your office that's the Yoke that's the burden it's the burden of leadership it's the Yoke of your office it's your testimony being put on trial because it's an expectation of you from the word with how you deal with situations I'm guilty you are guilty we are all guilty to say Lord help us to carry this yoke to carry this burden anybody with me this morning can the church say [Applause] Amen the musician get ready let me great to close out I didn't get to finish but I believe the Lord will have it that I could continue a part two to this brother Clarence your identity is the real you your identity is beyond your physical appearance if you were to go and change your face you know people do and do facial surgery and thing it doesn't change who you are you change your face but the Envy still there the lust still there the anger still there the animosity is still there the the you still there that's why I've preached many times before you could take a pig from out in the pig sty bring him into your house put a bow tie upon Him spray him down with deodorant put cologne upon him put a pig pants upon him put a nice Pig bed with air condition put him in your room and he will behave himself for as long as you keep them locked up in the house that's what legalism is because the nature hasn't changed so he's now walking around in the house he's sitting on on the table he's he's but the day you forget it door open he leave the AC he leave the the nice mat he leave the color and he dve dve straight into the mud and start to swim he say oh gosh I missed this thing boy this thing went this mud good because the nature hasn't changed but but the Bram said put a lamb and when a lamb fall in your body you know what the lamb does it bleeds it cries because he knows that's not his atmosphere his environment and I say that's how you know a son or daughter not that they don't fall but when they fall they say oh God I'm sorry oh God forgive me oh God change me not that they don't fall into the mud but the attitude in the mud is different say Lord I'm messed up again oh God help me pull me out take me out deliver me this is not me this is not who I am can the church say Amen I'll close with this last point and Hebrews 11 23 by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment verse 24 by faith Moses when he was come to years and this is the scripture I want to get to you at with respect your identity he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to ensure to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season in other words Moses made a choice and his revelation of his identity brought him to a spot that he refused to be called he said don't call me that that's not who I am That's Not My Name he chose the Bible said choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God Moses had a choice he could have say I'm not answering that call he could have been like Jonah but he made a choice to suffer the Affliction than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season Young Brother young sister mother father the pleasures of sin is for a season and after that season is death I want to encourage you to refuse to be called the son of Hero's daughter refuse the identity the world wants to put on you refuse the identity of this Modern Life and this Modern influencer Age where people are being influenced by all kinds of things but not by God I want to encourage you to accept your spiritual identity that only comes from the revealer of the word which is a Divine mystery that you are part of God predestinated before the foundation of the world to be an overcomer to be a worshipper to be a saint to be a son and daughter of God to identify in this day that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that the devil could get most but he cannot get all that there are Sons and Daughters of God who will refuse what the devil's offer is they will refuse the things of the world they will refuse a life of sin they will refuse a life of lost and animosity and envy and they will say Lord I want the cross I want the blood I want a change I want a transformation I want seven Living Voices I want the virtues to be expressed in my life I want to forgive I want to drop o if you have a ought this morning I want you to to drop it refuse it refuse the ought refuse The Grudge refuse the life of sin refuse the animosity refuse your past refuse your mistakes that's not who I am when Jacob wrestled with the angel he say what is your name and when you over came he say your name will no longer be called Jacob it'll be called Israel that was a personal experience but the PO anybody who met him after that encounter was going to call him Jacob because that's what they knew his name to be and he had to say that's not my name my name is no longer Jacob call me Israel call me Israel the man you used to know that's not me anymore don't call me Jacob I don't know who you're talking about anymore because I'm a change man I met the angel of the Lord I met the pillar of fire I had an experience and Moses had an experience enough to say don't call me pharoh's daughter don't call me Jacob don't call me Saul I'm now Paul don't call me Simon I'm now Peter don't call me Sarah I'm now Sarah don't call me Abraham I'm now Abraham because I've gone through a change the old man is dead and a new man is now alive and that man is called the Holy Ghost and he's birthing something in me like I said that seed in you will reproduce what is supposed to reproduce may the Lord richly bless you can we stand and give the Lord a hand of praise [Applause]
