[23:13] minute
[23:14] god bless you if every Bibles we have
[23:17] one scripture to reach a knight from
[23:18] second Corinthians chapter three wanna
[23:23] read from verse 1 to eat
[23:33] I'm good to see all of your tier tonight
[23:36] even though the weather is how it is but
[23:38] we still present we first one of second
[23:44] Corinthians chapter 3 do we begin again
[23:47] to commend ourselves or need we some
[23:50] others epistles of commendation to you
[23:52] or letters of commendation from you
[23:55] Yayoi Bissell written in our hearts
[23:57] known on read of all men for as much as
[24:01] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[24:04] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[24:06] written not with ink but with the spirit
[24:09] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[24:13] but in fleshy tables of the heart and
[24:17] such trusts have we through Christ to
[24:20] God would not that we are sufficient of
[24:23] ourselves to think anything as ourselves
[24:26] but our sufficiency is of God who also
[24:31] had made us able ministers of the New
[24:35] Testament not of the letter but of the
[24:39] spirit for the letter killeth but the
[24:42] spirit giveth life but if the
[24:46] ministration of death written and
[24:49] engraven stones was glorious so that the
[24:54] chair of Israel could not stedfastly
[24:57] behold the face of Moses for the glory
[25:00] of his countenance which glory was to be
[25:05] done away how shall not the ministration
[25:08] of the Spirit be rather glorious may God
[25:13] bless his word you may be seated
[25:15] it's a powerful Scripture Amen you may
[25:18] be seated and I I enter it tonight and
[25:22] our title the letter killeth but the
[25:26] Spirit give it life Oh praise what
[25:30] letter kill it but the Spirit give it
[25:33] life first corinthians 2:4 paul's at my
[25:36] speech and my preaching was not with
[25:38] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[25:41] demonstration of the
[25:43] Spirit and of power
[25:46] first Corinthians 2/5 continue and he
[25:49] said that your feet the purpose of that
[25:51] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[25:53] but in the power of God what was behind
[25:56] him what was motivating him what was
[25:58] active with him
[26:00] isn't that something else ok if God told
[26:03] Moses take off your shoes you're on holy
[26:05] ground Moses said that's too much
[26:06] trouble I'll take off my hat I got
[26:09] unleased my shoes would have been would
[26:11] it have been just as good no sir
[26:13] God would have never spoke to him until
[26:17] he took off his shoes it's big never
[26:22] spoke to him until he took off his shoes
[26:24] but Abraham knock on his pulpit four
[26:26] times and God will never speak to the
[26:30] church till it comes back to the
[26:32] Articles and principles that Krait lists
[26:36] lead them and it is not dominated by
[26:39] some emotional or some denomination to
[26:42] pull it this way and that way they will
[26:44] still have to come back to believe in
[26:47] miracles believing in science they will
[26:51] have to come back to believe in miracles
[26:53] believing in science believing in the
[26:55] Holy Ghost build baptised in the name of
[26:57] Jesus Christ all these things they have
[26:59] to come back to that or God won't speak
[27:01] to them or glory to God you mean back to
[27:05] the signs and wonders America's yes now
[27:08] the gospel is not altogether the word or
[27:12] this is the Word of God and all thing
[27:15] must be based upon the word isn't it
[27:17] true he said jesus said go ye into all
[27:19] the world and preach the gospel to every
[27:21] creature
[27:21] now he did not say teach the world no
[27:26] this is where we head in tonight he did
[27:28] not say teach the word he said preach
[27:34] the gospel so the gospel consists more
[27:40] than teaching the word I wanted to soak
[27:45] in tonight the gospel consists
[27:51] more than teaching the world remember
[27:54] jesus said nation shall rise against
[27:56] nation Kingdom against Kingdom
[27:58] earthquakes pestilence and the Gospel as
[28:00] we preach and then shall the income not
[28:04] gospel taught gospel preached and then
[28:08] shall the income so all the teaching
[28:10] have to come to preach him in other
[28:13] words the teaching going to produce the
[28:15] seed the preached and produced the rain
[28:17] the water to manifest the very seed that
[28:20] the teachers have taught so every
[28:22] position have a role and a function the
[28:25] posture to hold the church a teacher
[28:27] teaching ministries evangelists
[28:29] to get the fire up on the people the
[28:31] Atmos everyone have a part to play
[28:33] that's why the fight for ministry is for
[28:36] the perfecting of the Saints in my name
[28:38] and we believe that so the gospel is
[28:41] consist more than teaching the word for
[28:43] Paul confirming that says the gospel
[28:46] came to us not in word only but true
[28:49] power which is demonstrations of the
[28:53] Holy Spirit would come and demonstrate
[28:55] the gospel to bring the word to a living
[28:59] reality Oh glory to God live in reality
[29:03] shout out live in reality so if you
[29:06] receive the word by knowing the word
[29:08] that doesn't do you any good because
[29:11] they letter kill it but the Spirit give
[29:13] it life then you must be born again and
[29:16] then the Holy Spirit quickens the word
[29:19] to you in other words like a grain of
[29:20] corn it's leaning in my hand just a
[29:22] green a corn it will never do nothing
[29:24] else but bury it it comes contaminated
[29:26] moles then it bring up another green a
[29:28] conscience like yet yes sir we need
[29:31] every stepladder the building is still
[29:34] in make him and when it's completed here
[29:36] we go
[29:37] the gospel is to be preached to every
[29:39] kindred tongue and nation when then
[29:42] Jesus returned Oh glory to God you mean
[29:45] all of this pyramid building was the
[29:46] billet until I become completed don't
[29:49] make it get the full gospel Oh
[29:50] hallelujah praise God isn't that right
[29:54] he said now watch we have had plenty
[29:56] passes on trucks and theology around the
[29:59] world but the gospel is not the Bible
[30:01] all together
[30:03] all said the gospel came to us not in
[30:06] word only but true power and
[30:08] demonstration of the Holy Ghost so then
[30:11] when Jesus said go into all the world
[30:12] and preach the gospel to every creature
[30:14] then he meant this is the interpretation
[30:16] now to go into all the world and
[30:19] demonstrate the power of God to every
[30:22] creature hallelujah praise God do you
[30:25] understand what the gospel really is now
[30:27] to demonstrate the power of God to every
[30:30] creature
[30:31] doesn't that remind you of something
[30:33] what happened in gadna Eden when God put
[30:36] man in His image likeness have power
[30:38] over every creature that is bringing
[30:40] back the gospel so Adam had the gospel
[30:42] back there Oh glory to God and we coming
[30:45] back to that same gospel that original
[30:46] gospel when Wareham get access to the
[30:49] book he demonstrated the power from that
[30:51] book and that book is only earth the
[30:53] angel is on you know with the book or
[30:56] glory to God nor watch in order to
[30:58] preach the gospel before you can make it
[31:03] a gospel preached you have got to have
[31:06] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[31:11] Spirit to prove the gospel so it is not
[31:15] a ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a
[31:20] real living reality of the resurrection
[31:24] of Jesus Christ living among men and
[31:28] that's the faith that I'm trying my best
[31:32] to contend for today this is William
[31:37] Marion banner or glory record he was
[31:40] seeing it and he was seeing what he had
[31:43] to fight for he was fighting to see that
[31:47] original gospel come back Oh hallelujah
[31:50] let me say it again it's not just a
[31:52] ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a
[31:55] real living reality of the resurrection
[31:58] of Jesus Christ living among them and
[32:01] that's the fate that I'm trying my best
[32:03] to contend for today that Jesus Christ
[32:06] is the same yesterday today and forever
[32:08] his power is unlimited
[32:14] [Applause]
[32:17] allelujah file it will fool around with
[32:20] unlimited power
[32:21] Pilate will stop unlimited power his
[32:23] power is unlimited that means to
[32:26] and walk the blank and see the
[32:28] difficulty rivers can be cast out
[32:29] whatever condition it is and missing
[32:32] limbs can be restored this power is
[32:34] unlimited
[32:35] every gift could be back in the church
[32:37] within five minutes with the power of
[32:39] God back in the church I talk about
[32:40] tongues interpretations the wisdom
[32:43] differ fate gif of healing miracles all
[32:45] the same and every give back in the
[32:47] church Oh glory to God what is it
[32:49] another book of Acts he essays Alpha and
[32:52] Omega just recent I'm saying that he's
[32:54] alpha
[32:55] he's Omega what he manifests in the
[32:56] Alpha he has to manifest sin Omega I
[32:58] want nothing less than that I don't want
[33:01] to try that Church I'm not taking that I
[33:03] have come on for that this is not my
[33:06] mess this is my message here or give the
[33:08] Lord a shout hallelujah praise God I'll
[33:11] preach till I see it I'll fight for it
[33:14] praise God in that delicious was a super
[33:16] Church nothing but stop them
[33:18] Oh glory to God nothing could stop that
[33:20] church I never asked this is a prophecy
[33:22] this last day breath will be a super
[33:25] Church or super race who said that not
[33:27] even the Prophet said that his God
[33:28] pelham pick up his pen and write that
[33:30] Old Glory is written and so shall it be
[33:33] Oh glory to God as the near a headstone
[33:36] a super church a super anointed a super
[33:39] power a super strength or glory to God
[33:41] Samson was ordinary
[33:42] but when an anointed come upon him he
[33:45] was not ordinary or glory to God
[33:47] hallelujah and when the anointed come up
[33:49] on David they were not ordinary is
[33:51] something come upon him something has to
[33:54] come upon you or glory no God but this
[33:56] time is not just flesh and blood is the
[33:59] word image inside of you or give the
[34:01] Lord a shout if you can limit God you
[34:08] can limit Christ if you limit the church
[34:10] today in its possibilities you are
[34:13] limited in God but all things whatsoever
[34:15] you desire when you pray believe
[34:18] but to receive it and you shall have it
[34:19] he said I believe and I know it's true
[34:21] sir
[34:22] Oh glory to God thank you Jesus Holly
[34:26] Elijah was a perfect type of the church
[34:29] on Christ
[34:30] Elijah being the type of Christ and when
[34:32] he was about to leave before leaving oh
[34:35] he made preparation that the Spirit of
[34:39] God must remain on the earth
[34:41] God takes his man never his spirit God
[34:45] took Christ but the Holy Spirit is here
[34:47] tonight vindicating him just as similar
[34:49] Jesus he tokenized her but it came upon
[34:53] Elijah come upon John the Baptist same
[34:55] spirit making Lysa act like he likes her
[34:57] made John the Baptist act like Elijah
[34:59] it's with the church today act like
[35:02] Christ because the same spirit coming
[35:05] back upon the church
[35:06] Oh glory to God hallelujah the devil
[35:08] takes a spirit or his man but never in
[35:10] spirit so that way they cast up crane
[35:13] the cast of evil because the evil man
[35:15] dead I'm going to hang him they kill him
[35:16] or whatever it is the barium but the
[35:18] anointing of upon him fallen upon
[35:20] somebody else and if the devil could
[35:22] drop his anointing on somebody else the
[35:24] Spirit of God could fall on you because
[35:27] when Jesus died the ghost of Jesus which
[35:30] is the Spirit of God the Holy Ghost is
[35:32] what is promised to come upon you the
[35:34] spirit of a man a perfect man or glory
[35:38] to God Jesus man hallelujah his spirit
[35:41] is what his promise to come upon you do
[35:42] you believe that Alleluia so them same
[35:46] teachers who the devil takes is the man
[35:49] but never his spirit damn shame
[35:52] teachers bacteria that condemn Jesus
[35:55] Christ they were scholars to the minute
[35:58] they were far beyond our seminary
[36:01] students today in the width they were
[36:03] holy men no one could put a hand on them
[36:05] they had to be holy
[36:06] they had to be righteous they had to be
[36:09] blameless but yet powered by sitter
[36:13] does the title 1/2 of this section
[36:16] powered by Seaton yet man behind it
[36:21] pulpit man preaching word but powered by
[36:26] Sita didn't recognize the Son of God and
[36:30] they condemned and killed him that's
[36:34] right and that spirit lives on today
[36:36] people who are just as fundamental just
[36:40] as scholarly and pita as they can be
[36:43] having a form of godliness but denying
[36:46] the power thereof watch them how to deny
[36:50] the power thereof or glory to God
[36:54] hallelujah the ninety-nine mysteries the
[36:56] 1990 history there not be 90 prophecies
[36:59] but denying the power the power and that
[37:02] is what you come for
[37:03] that is what Judas couldn't access
[37:08] because Pentecost is what caught you
[37:11] deserve Oh glory he was under temporary
[37:14] power in Matthew 10 but he couldn't get
[37:16] permanent power in the upper room Oh

[37:36] word but the letter kill it but the
[37:40] spirit give it life its life comes by

[49:55] word was was God no dependent upon the
[50:00] what the word was the word was the
[50:02] expression of a thought it has to be a
[50:04] thought before it can be a word so God
[50:08] in the beginning give the thought of
[50:10] what it would be
[50:12] the word for it and we received the word
[50:15] and it produces what God taught it was
[50:18] then he says this the word is the gospel
[50:24] in seed form that was seen again

[50:35] Underwood is a seed and then he come to
[50:38] bring this emphasis the word is the
[50:42] gospel in seed form so as long as we

[56:47] gospel seed form she went on deeper you
[56:51] see if you ask me but Branham in your
[56:52] country that a country a country would
[56:55] you give me a country I could give you a
[56:57] corn you have a country potentially but
[57:02] it's in the seed fool you can't see you
[57:08] have absolutely got a tree until the
[57:11] seed has produced a tree and that is the
[57:13] problem today people claim in all kind
[57:15] of things that they do already have so
[57:18] we're not talking about seed we're not
[57:21] talking about potential we're talking
[57:23] about the fruit that is to be produced
[57:26] and that is coming to maturity because
[57:31] seed represent the potential babies in
[57:35] life that is to be unfolded until the
[57:39] life grows up into maturity there is
[57:42] ready to blossom and be a fruit or glory
[57:46] to God so once is the seed form its baby
[57:50] its potential hallelu there's nothing
[57:53] much I could do about it but bury it and
[57:55] let the life unfold no you can't force
[57:58] the life you can't force the leaves
[58:01] you can't force the maturity life itself
[58:04] unfolds it or give the Lord a shout so
[58:10] the mystery of what's in the seed is
[58:12] when the life is unfolded because your
[58:15] daughter is a pumpkin seed or watermelon
[58:17] see that looks similar but when you put
[58:19] it in the ground
[58:20] and the life they kept unfold even
[58:21] though both of them running on vines
[58:23] when the life unfold and the fruit comes
[58:25] forth they said this is a pumpkin and
[58:27] this is the watermelon there's two
[58:28] different things altogether
[58:29] oh I mean the life unfold this is bright
[58:32] this is church member or give the Lord a
[58:35] shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[58:38] so it is clean it is clear why you could
[58:42] see the mystery is the secret is I'm
[58:45] caught on to write that do
[58:47] Wood is in the bride Oh hallelujah so so
[58:53] potentially it's in seed form but you're
[58:55] you can't see some people want to claim
[58:59] to be adopted now on all kind of thing I
[59:00] don't know power no nothing at all even
[59:02] a devil or don't believe that not only I
[59:07] don't believe it I don't believe that
[59:08] are you go challenger adopted son is
[59:10] over adopted son like that different
[59:13] thing altogether you know like back to
[59:15] evening hallelujah cause I'm adopted son
[59:18] zealand's you know what up see Sansa men
[59:21] will repel a fire in them
[59:29] I'm gonna do great damage you can't lose
[59:32] someone like that and there's old human
[59:34] spirit they just plain terribly do
[59:36] terrible things we seize any world with
[59:39] leaders when man have no character and
[59:41] getting a big position on power how does
[59:42] lead it's just terrible in a yeah it's
[59:46] good counter for that this is perfection
[59:48] I went that much the perfect has come
[59:51] what's put Pat aside
[59:52] so God permit certain things but when
[59:55] perfection have been unfolded got the
[59:57] man is perfection he's supposed to have
[1:00:00] perfection
[1:00:00] don't come short of it brethren oh this
[1:00:03] is not being h passed by they not be not
[1:00:06] elutriation Wesley is this is a
[1:00:08] perfection Oh glory to God and Paul said
[1:00:11] this way I will show you a more
[1:00:13] excellent way do I speak with the
[1:00:15] tongues of men and angels after all the
[1:00:17] mysteries after all the revelations
[1:00:18] though I speak have all knowledge and
[1:00:20] understand all mysteries that some all
[1:00:22] all and I do i charity I'm still nothing
[1:00:27] hallelujah hallelujah do I have all
[1:00:29] knowledge and all the books are in
[1:00:31] nature so she computer hallelujah do I
[1:00:35] know our mysteries and do our charity
[1:00:37] nothing
[1:00:38] and then he he expressed the behavior of
[1:00:41] this thing called charity yeah look for
[1:00:45] that a monkey I claiming a charity
[1:00:47] there's a word another he can spell that
[1:00:49] you could put this with the people and
[1:00:52] say I have that and put in your pocket
[1:00:53] in negative charges suffered long and is
[1:00:56] kind charity vaunteth not itself is not
[1:00:59] puffed up is not easily provoked beareth
[1:01:03] all things believeth all things hopeth
[1:01:05] all things endureth all things charity
[1:01:07] never is the characteristics there's a
[1:01:09] behavior that goes with what you call
[1:01:12] that life Oh hallelujah so a man can't
[1:01:16] claim you have and you're not seeing
[1:01:18] that you have to have that and then you
[1:01:21] could claim whether you want to claim
[1:01:22] all let's just see see we could just hit
[1:01:24] the home stretch here oh well preaching
[1:01:27] the word is the Acorn but making it live
[1:01:31] is the gospel he promised the Holy
[1:01:34] Spirit that's the word and receiving the
[1:01:37] Holy Spirit is making it live manifested
[1:01:39] and if he promised these blessing
[1:01:42] by the word then accepting the word and
[1:01:44] producing what it said is the gospel
[1:01:46] going all the world and preach the
[1:01:48] gospel to every creature
[1:01:49] the very next line is the proof that
[1:01:54] just teaching the world wouldn't do it
[1:01:56] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:02:00] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:02:04] out Devils evil spirits speak with new
[1:02:06] tongues take up serpents it won't harm
[1:02:08] them no that is the gospel and then
[1:02:14] Bertram said this I believe that we are
[1:02:17] living in the day when the Holy Spirit
[1:02:18] is moving upon the hearts of people
[1:02:20] regardless of how much criticism how
[1:02:23] much fanaticism God is under obligation
[1:02:25] to take that to it out of the Gentiles
[1:02:28] just as certain as I'm standing on the
[1:02:31] platform he will do it Oh glory to God
[1:02:35] hallelujah
[1:02:37] then let's collect Anna was hoping I'd
[1:02:41] get this thing that I want to read for
[1:02:42] you know title it the preaching that
[1:02:45] kills and this is an extract from a
[1:02:52] writer called en bomb she's a man who
[1:02:53] wrote about the power of prayer and way
[1:02:56] back in the early centuries the West and
[1:02:59] I wonder I can say it like him so I
[1:03:01] wanted to read I want to read this for
[1:03:03] you tonight the preaching that kills the
[1:03:06] preaching that kills is non-spiritual
[1:03:09] preaching the ability of the preaching
[1:03:12] is not from God lower sources then God
[1:03:16] has given to its energy and stimulant
[1:03:18] the spirit is not evident in the
[1:03:21] preacher nor his preacher many kinds of
[1:03:25] forces may be projected and stimulated
[1:03:27] by preaching that kills but they are not
[1:03:30] spiritual forces they may resemble
[1:03:33] spiritual forces but they are only the
[1:03:35] shadow the counterfeit life they may
[1:03:38] seem to have but that the life is
[1:03:41] magnetized the prison that kills is the
[1:03:44] letter che
[1:03:46] plea and orderly it may be but is the
[1:03:48] letter still the dry husky let the empty
[1:03:53] ball shall the letter may have the germ
[1:03:56] of life in it
[1:03:57] but it has no breath of spring to evoke
[1:04:00] it winter sees they are as hard as the
[1:04:04] winter soil as I see as the winters air
[1:04:07] nor torreón not germinate and by them
[1:04:10] the letter pigeon has the truth but even
[1:04:14] divine truth has no life given energy
[1:04:16] alone
[1:04:17] it must be energized by the spirit with
[1:04:20] all of God's forces at its back shoot on
[1:04:24] quickened by God's Spirit
[1:04:25] dedenne's as much as more than error
[1:04:37] shoot on quickl by God's timid dedenne's
[1:04:42] as much as or more than error it may be
[1:04:46] the truth with oat mixture for all the
[1:04:48] spirit its sheet and touch a deadly its
[1:04:52] shoot error its light darkness the
[1:04:56] letter preaching is functionless reader
[1:04:59] mellowed more oil by the spirit there
[1:05:02] may be tears but the tears cannot run
[1:05:05] God's machinery tears may be the summer
[1:05:08] spread on a smoke of an iceberg
[1:05:10] nothing but surface feelings and
[1:05:14] earnestness there may be but it is the
[1:05:17] emotion of the kata and the illnesses of
[1:05:20] the attorney repression I feel from the
[1:05:23] kindling of his own spots the eloquent
[1:05:26] over his own disease earnest in
[1:05:30] delivering the product of his own brain
[1:05:32] the professor may usurp the place and
[1:05:34] imitate the fire of the apostle brains
[1:05:37] and nerves
[1:05:38] misses the place and fake the work of
[1:05:40] God's Spirit but by these forces the
[1:05:43] letter may glow and sparkle like a
[1:05:45] illumined X but the glow and sparkle
[1:05:47] will be as barren of life as this field
[1:05:49] soon with pills
[1:05:52] the depth demon element lies back of the
[1:05:55] woods back of the sermon back of the
[1:05:58] occasion back of the manor back of the
[1:06:00] action the great hindrance is the
[1:06:03] preacher himself say Amen he has not in
[1:06:13] himself the mighty life Cretan forces
[1:06:15] there may be no discount on his potted
[1:06:18] oxy honesty cleanness or innocence but
[1:06:22] somehow the man the inner man in its
[1:06:26] secret places have never broken down and
[1:06:28] surrender to God his inner life is not a
[1:06:32] great highway for the transmission of
[1:06:34] God's message God's power somehow self
[1:06:37] and not God rules in the Holy of Holies
[1:06:40] somewhere all the unconscious to himself
[1:06:44] some spiritual nonconductor has touches
[1:06:47] in a beam as a big one
[1:06:49] spiritual nonconductor as touches in a
[1:06:53] beam and the divine current has been
[1:06:55] arrested his inner being has never felt
[1:06:58] its thorough spiritual bankruptcy its
[1:07:01] utter powerlessness
[1:07:02] he has never learned to cry out with an
[1:07:05] ethereal cry of self disappear and self
[1:07:09] helplessness till God's power and God's
[1:07:11] fire comes man fills
[1:07:13] purifies and empowers self esteem self
[1:07:16] ability in some pernicious shape has
[1:07:19] defamed and violated the temple which
[1:07:22] should be held secret for God life given
[1:07:25] preaching cost the preacher much death
[1:07:31] to self crucifixion to the world the
[1:07:34] travail of his own soul crucified
[1:07:37] preaching only can give life crucified
[1:07:41] preaching can only come from a crucified
[1:07:43] man or give the Lord some praises all
[1:07:47] glory to God you love him this light
[1:07:50] almost finish this is the Prophet he
[1:07:56] says if you have been called from
[1:07:58] darkness and the light from death unto
[1:08:01] life from a formal intellectual
[1:08:03] conception of Christ are boiling in a
[1:08:05] spirits watch in your life that it
[1:08:08] leaves the things of the wool aside and
[1:08:10] you stand for Christ we got this there's
[1:08:12] something in you hunger and unmoving
[1:08:15] like it wasn't Jacob you're rested with
[1:08:17] the Lord you walk different after that
[1:08:19] something is different than you
[1:08:20] you have changed this is one I get to
[1:08:23] hear no no it has to before it can be
[1:08:26] done it has to be inspired to you I
[1:08:30] don't care and he had a big bomb and
[1:08:34] this is good for all and people who
[1:08:35] don't want plenty plenty plenty I don't
[1:08:37] care I could stand here and preach till
[1:08:41] what here I got fell off off of my
[1:08:43] shoulders till my shoulders tripped on
[1:08:46] I was 90 years old and you listen every
[1:08:49] day until God quickens that to you
[1:08:53] you're still in the same shape or glory
[1:08:57] the cover give the Lord a shout on that
[1:08:58] so it's not just the word the laptop it
[1:09:02] has to be inspired to you or glory to
[1:09:05] God hallelujah so he said no he's gone
[1:09:09] Jacob one after the spirit he order
[1:09:11] after the flesh what is it Esau and
[1:09:13] Jacob fighting in the wombs of the
[1:09:15] mother he said they have been since
[1:09:17] Luther brought the first Reformation I
[1:09:19] hope that is simple enough for you to
[1:09:20] understand it these men if they pick up
[1:09:25] this and go out with it they can make
[1:09:29] more sense to it here we go to bring it
[1:09:32] to a place that you would want I just
[1:09:34] wanted I just want to lead this seed and
[1:09:37] hope they make it come to life so
[1:09:41] brother Branham was saying he just
[1:09:43] wonder what lay the seed and hope that
[1:09:46] these men that coming after bring the
[1:09:49] seeds to life Oh glory to God and he
[1:09:53] says no there's not he said no he was
[1:09:56] the light there was no two or three
[1:09:57] lights or four five different
[1:09:58] organization there was one right there's
[1:10:00] not a Methodist Baptist Lutron precision
[1:10:02] Christ is the light the light is the
[1:10:05] light and the word manifested is the
[1:10:07] light of the hour what you mean not just
[1:10:11] the word know the word manifested is the
[1:10:14] lighter II or or glory to God rise and
[1:10:17] shine for the light has come
[1:10:18] and every data sunlight it's got to be
[1:10:20] separated and the only one thing
[1:10:23] separates it is the word manifested so
[1:10:25] everybody talk and talk and talk and let
[1:10:27] them talk but they're gonna come would
[1:10:29] manifested light of the hour or glory
[1:10:32] Terry's her pride she must be the word
[1:10:34] manifested to be the bride Co because
[1:10:36] the Lord a shout thing capri-sun message
[1:10:39] on that the bride wanna be the word
[1:10:41] manifested hallelujah glory to God he
[1:10:45] was the word manifested here on earth
[1:10:47] but he could not do this as a man if
[1:10:50] taken the Spirit of God what is a big
[1:10:52] one Tombo Jesus it take the Spirit of
[1:10:55] God dwelling in him to quicken these
[1:10:58] promises to him I hope that we get this
[1:11:01] really clear Jesus being a man himself
[1:11:04] the body but it took the spirit in him
[1:11:06] the Spirit is not me to do it the words
[1:11:08] he is seen the Spirit is what I've got
[1:11:10] quicken the promises of Jesus as a man
[1:11:15] he can pull it on himself the spirit
[1:11:16] itself to do that whole glory to God and
[1:11:20] then he said but to the elected God is
[1:11:22] calling to elected didn't know it he
[1:11:24] calling of virtuous bride the last ditch
[1:11:25] a selected lady
[1:11:26] he said the bride is always part of the
[1:11:29] bridegroom so the bride will not be a
[1:11:31] denomination it will have to be the word
[1:11:33] manifested to be the Bride of Christ say
[1:11:37] everybody was all much seen some church
[1:11:39] and a bride I believe this I believe
[1:11:41] this like foolishness I ain't no bad at
[1:11:43] all light revolution scenes you have to
[1:11:45] see you have to become the would
[1:11:46] manifests it to be the brain and this
[1:11:49] year faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:11:51] patience gone this vertical as long as

[1:11:56] fights and pitch all deep color
[1:11:57] mysteries that is that is the mysteries
[1:11:59] there I do because that is the entire
[1:12:01] Bible did previously Bible you know what
[1:12:08] do you have here is the written word
[1:12:09] with mysteries written in it that guy is
[1:12:12] the machine life form that's why I said
[1:12:16] if you have these things then you have
[1:12:17] had seven mysteries that they fought for
[1:12:20] to bring back does the term does mean
[1:12:21] that my brethren if you have these
[1:12:23] things inside of you then you have seven
[1:12:25] ages you have seven mysteries you have
[1:12:27] several voices does the tug does mean
[1:12:29] that all the machines inside of you
[1:12:32] any identified Irina Saul then he said
[1:12:34] they were hidden the seals think only
[1:12:36] think about that know who know
[1:12:37] Irina San Martin like a llama loot as
[1:12:39] messengers nobody knew that until the
[1:12:41] profit came he said they were hidden
[1:12:42] Lucille's
[1:12:43] how would they hid white was black was
[1:12:45] red horse all that that was a seasonal
[1:12:47] but these were behind devil do know
[1:12:50] about them they were hit and he WI them
[1:12:53] he only liked it didn't born he tried to
[1:12:54] kill them but God hide him
[1:12:57] hallelujah behind all MCS breakin he hid
[1:13:00] them messengers and they were the tools
[1:13:03] that God used the colony licked come
[1:13:05] come come come come
[1:13:06] or glory to grow when Luther job
[1:13:09] justification and hurry the elected the
[1:13:11] elected came out then he said he called
[1:13:13] the elected Lutheran's and maker
[1:13:14] Brazilians then he called the elected
[1:13:16] resident to make the Pentecostals now we
[1:13:18] call the elect and he can start to make
[1:13:20] up a headstone that he could come into
[1:13:22] it or glory to God so you have to be
[1:13:25] part of the elected bunch that God call
[1:13:27] out to make up the headstone to be the
[1:13:29] magnet right to pull them from the grave
[1:13:32] or blow in the court because there is
[1:13:34] going to be a resurrection or give the
[1:13:36] Lord a shout hallelujah so you can go
[1:13:39] Philip a letter and more revelations and
[1:13:41] letter you have to look for the spirit
[1:13:43] for the Lord is that spirit let's go and
[1:13:46] where the Lord is where the Spirit is
[1:13:48] there is Liberty not by name Liberty not
[1:13:54] not people that care warship Liberty
[1:13:57] where the Spirit is
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:04] my it was the same of the Old Testament
[1:14:09] Paul being well trained he knew the
[1:14:12] Scriptures the word you see the
[1:14:14] Scriptures no matter how well you know
[1:14:16] them if the Spirit doesn't quicken them
[1:14:19] then the letter killeth the spirit given
[1:14:21] life it must be quicken or made alive by
[1:14:23] the spirit if the screw doesn't live in
[1:14:26] up the word to you and make it the
[1:14:27] reality you then the letter is just
[1:14:29] intellectual that is why I know if if we
[1:14:33] don't get an atmosphere in his singing
[1:14:34] and you wish upon the prisoner that's
[1:14:35] where he's Oh hallelujah see pre-scored
[1:14:36] and what doesn't show them what not to
[1:14:38] keep any spirit gets in is very sinister
[1:14:41] a cheese that doesn't have that it tough
[1:14:44] the man is more letter going out not
[1:14:47] because he under letter you know but
[1:14:50] because this spirit atmosphere is nadya
[1:14:51] to inspire what he is preaching to the
[1:14:54] people he could be the best preacher or
[1:14:56] teacher if the atmosphere is not there
[1:14:59] is like he we sent time I don't want to

[1:17:29] they take us back to even go and reveal
[1:17:32] himself have the preeminence and take us
[1:17:33] back to even who's the big thing about
[1:17:35] that he said that war from Jesus
[1:17:37] revelation three words would made flesh
[1:17:39] and that story let the main thing be the
[1:17:42] main thing hallelujah water baptism and
[1:17:45] Pope and Rome and Israel all that talk
[1:17:48] all that filler material at the end of
[1:17:50] the day is God reveal themselves God how
[1:17:53] many preeminence has taken us back to
[1:17:55] Eden because you cannot go back to Eden
[1:17:57] without the preeminence --is because
[1:18:01] Eden demands a restored son not a crook
[1:18:04] not a sinner but us restored son and the
[1:18:08] blood came for justification as if we
[1:18:10] never lived in the first place so when
[1:18:12] God looked on this night he seen us as
[1:18:13] original sons or give the Lord a shout
[1:18:15] my God my God justified as if you're
[1:18:18] never in the first place
[1:18:22] hallelujah that's why cash out that's
[1:18:25] why could praise God that's why I was so
[1:18:27] excited when God look down and then
[1:18:29] wonder brother said Noah we the sons of
[1:18:31] God
[1:18:31] it doctored up here what we shall be but
[1:18:33] we know when we see him we shall be like
[1:18:35] him what they took they caught up in it
[1:18:39] caught up in a revelation of the sonship
[1:18:42] that he had not be canceled
[1:18:46] let me finish
[1:18:48] Moses was taught in the wisdom of the
[1:18:51] Egyptian he had 40 years of teaching
[1:18:54] under his mother and he could even teach
[1:18:56] them masses of Egypt but it taken God
[1:18:58] another 40 years to get all that beat
[1:19:00] out of him on the backs of the desert
[1:19:02] and one day while he was hidden jetrel
[1:19:04] sheep running from Egypt running from
[1:19:06] the task that thought he was to go back
[1:19:08] unless they all go because he tried in
[1:19:10] himself and having any with out he tries
[1:19:14] in himself without having any experience
[1:19:21] the seals of his deliverance and being
[1:19:24] liver was open up there but all I was
[1:19:26] intellectual teaching is all right he
[1:19:30] said by the letter killeth the spirit
[1:19:32] gave it life and in the presence of the
[1:19:34] burning bush he knowed more about God in
[1:19:37] five minutes than he had been taught in
[1:19:38] 40 years your own teachers this position
[1:19:42] ecclesia teach it teach it to be needed
[1:19:44] on so he can say Amen Ninomiya church
[1:19:47] and all he could see the other my
[1:19:49] teacher my pastors are my decision I go
[1:19:51] look at the area lady
[1:19:53] you can talk about your life you have a
[1:19:55] booster testimony or like a talk about
[1:19:57] the manbana pulpit if that is your
[1:19:59] testimony you have new testimony I
[1:20:01] question your own testimony very pastor
[1:20:05] that no whole church messed up think
[1:20:09] about you know you think what one that
[1:20:11] we fight that listen listen the reason
[1:20:15] we end up in this condition is because
[1:20:17] I'm Nicole Eaton somebody feel they
[1:20:19] began and somebody and somebody want to
[1:20:20] take over the churches somebody think
[1:20:22] there's a little Pope
[1:20:23] bishop and Archbishop that most bishop
[1:20:25] Danny best bishop higher bishop and they
[1:20:27] pull this out right up a delegate Pope

[1:21:07] perfect man my man loosen the tongue big
[1:21:10] argument big carrying on Mac the perfect
[1:21:13] man he could badly stung so you have to
[1:21:18] demonstrate power over yourself before
[1:21:20] God give power over others another thing
[1:21:22] if somebody understand that what he
[1:21:23] could clean my look in the deeper corner

[1:24:32] is his word fin the kitchen the wood
[1:24:34] itself here we go
[1:24:36] the spirit that's in you is the Word
[1:24:39] made flesh in you this is big enogh this
[1:24:44] is not skim milk you know this
[1:24:46] spirit in you that's right the foolish
[1:24:48] virgins we could never get the oil they
[1:24:50] don't have the world in them to turn to
[1:24:52] spirit so it's not just prayer meetings
[1:24:57] and praying you have to have the will it
[1:24:59] in you because the Spirit in you is the
[1:25:02] world made fresh one of the biggest
[1:25:07] mysteries Jesus busting in Cyprus we
[1:25:09] don't talk much about it one of the
[1:25:10] biggest mysteries he said - ello here do
[1:25:12] whatever them know here he said the
[1:25:13] kingdom is within you they couldn't
[1:25:17] understand that and then the Baron said
[1:25:20] the kingdom is the word maintaining the
[1:25:22] power is the flesh-and-blood kingdom is
[1:25:27] the word in you turn into power and that
[1:25:30] puts the kingdom resident inside of you
[1:25:32] Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:25:36] when GSA all Paul and her mother's

[1:25:41] kingdom was resident he could call for
[1:25:44] help at any time boy let me finish here
[1:25:48] because my my my my my the spirit that's
[1:25:56] in you is the world made flesh in you
[1:26:00] the spirit minds the word and is active
[1:26:05] in vindicating the word now the spirit
[1:26:10] is not active in any denomination it is
[1:26:14] not interested in making an organization
[1:26:17] because the spirit itself is contrary to
[1:26:20] organisation how can you how can the
[1:26:24] spirit work in an organization when it's
[1:26:28] the ninth take increase instead of the
[1:26:30] word it can't do it it is dead
[1:26:31] God don't go to damn kind of places his
[1:26:34] group amount to work for him cause
[1:26:36] they're already dead they are
[1:26:37] unbelievers in the world or wouldn't be
[1:26:40] in there no we are active in the things
[1:26:42] I'm above the spirit Minds the word the
[1:26:46] spirit gives the word life the Spirit is
[1:26:48] interested in vindicates in the word
[1:26:50] that's why he said the manifestation of
[1:26:52] the Holy Spirit is that angel trying to
[1:26:54] get the people back to the world because
[1:26:56] God can only vindicate the word
[1:26:58] see man want to get vindication they say
[1:27:00] I am it but court said no I'm not
[1:27:02] vindicating that I'm particular my word
[1:27:04] if you have the word in you you'll get
[1:27:06] the part of the vindication when that
[1:27:08] confirmation comes but go wonderfully
[1:27:10] Kiedis would the reason depend depend
[1:27:12] consulted many manifestations but they
[1:27:14] didn't have the word so that's why they
[1:27:16] went and seen at door she what kind of
[1:27:17] thing like that unknowingly but the Holy
[1:27:19] Ghost doing all kinds they go I don't
[1:27:20] want that so he give us 50 plus years to
[1:27:24] soak him to blend in to add this word to
[1:27:31] get mature or let's put it this way to
[1:27:34] get your feet right that's what this was
[1:27:37] all about to get your feet right to
[1:27:39] break into this season Oh hallelujah
[1:27:42] let's continue Oh save it last me
[1:27:47] musicians he was the first son of God to
[1:27:53] comfort the full maturity to be in God
[1:27:57] for my Jesus Christ he was plucked from
[1:27:59] the earth and wave over the people what
[1:28:02] a glorious lesson by the quickman power
[1:28:04] the first one he had been tight but this
[1:28:08] was the first fruit of them that slept
[1:28:10] so when Jesus rose from the dead he was
[1:28:13] the first fruit of them that slept isn't
[1:28:16] that right and the first fruit must be
[1:28:18] with hallelujah so what he was wave over
[1:28:23] the promised seed that had the promise
[1:28:26] of life he was waved at the day of
[1:28:29] Pentecost people don't want us to go
[1:28:31] back there but we have to because that's
[1:28:32] where he was with when their common song
[1:28:35] from heaven like a rushing mighty wind
[1:28:37] and was wave over the people at
[1:28:40] Pentecost waiting for the blessing and
[1:28:41] is to be waived again we realize in the
[1:28:47] last day according to Luke 1730 in the
[1:28:51] day that the Son of Man will be revealed
[1:28:53] or waved over the people this is the cap
[1:28:57] of all what I'm preaching tonight what
[1:28:59] I'm about to read here you cannot miss
[1:29:01] this one he said who is the son of man
[1:29:04] but a mission in the beginning was the
[1:29:07] word
[1:29:08] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:29:11] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:29:14] dwelt among us now if all the teaching
[1:29:16] that we have by the confirmation of the
[1:29:18] world by signs and wonders no Luke
[1:29:20] something to hear we all agree with that
[1:29:22] Scripture that the word again is wave
[1:29:26] over the people so for 50 years what was
[1:29:29] wave over you the word by these promises
[1:29:33] so all these promises I don't know what
