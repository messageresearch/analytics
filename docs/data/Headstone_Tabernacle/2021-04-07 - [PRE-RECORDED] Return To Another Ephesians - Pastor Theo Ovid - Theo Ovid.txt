praises oh glory hallelujah yes yes yes hallelujah amen it's good to be here tonight oh hallelujah once his presence is here we are fine [Music] ephesians chapter 2 we want to go from verse 1 to 10 scripture reason tonight ephesians chapter 2 praise god my what a weekend we amen praise the lord ephesians chapter 2 reading from verse 1 and you had a quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now worketh in this children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others sinner was no differentiation at all but god bought god who is rich in mercy for his great love where it he loved us even when we were dead in sins had quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and had raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are you safe through faith and not of ourselves it is a gift of god none of works at least any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them may god bless his word amen you may be seated oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah how many feel good to be here how many feel good to be in the presence of god and where the twos and trees are gathered there we are there he is in the midst amen praise god but tonight have a title return to another ephesians return to non-efficient uh last time we spoke with last wednesday we don't want to return to that first love getting back to that love getting back to that word isn't that right and we spoke about the future is that please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out to the spirit all begins to feed and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of god that has cooled off and become a bit former that is what was happening back literally ephesians they were getting formal the abandonment to god was dying out and the people want to careful about what god taught of them as they begin to be careful about what the world taught of them so you see when they come to that spot where you're more concerned about what god thinks about your mother husband father brother wife whatever it doesn't matter what people say humans you want to study what god says how god feel about your life how god feel about your actions and your attitude and so on then it be so ephesians fss means relaxed drifting aim at and relax at high aims but they got relaxed and we can't afford to get relaxed that's why we want to push up the key a bit have that all-night prayer meeting we want to keep adding and adding an errand because we want to know we're making that progress you say but ram says you've got to do something for god to honor there are people who do like no kind of sacrifice they want god to bless them as they are you see but you see we once were sinners we wants in lust we want all kind of stuff but god rich and but god rich rich rich and mercy had quicken us that's the word we want to emphasize tonight quicken quicken us hallelujah to our lively hope quicken us to a higher order quicken us gonna have to quicken you that's why all the father phone knew he called amen you have to be called of god to be quickened hallelujah non-elect cannot be quickened but you can be quickened think about it now you were down in sin you were doing whatever but god quickened you and gave your eyes out that you may see that you could put your foot and walk that's why we could come and worship that's why you can come and express your faith and love to god because he actually quicken you understand these people not just trying to press to go to church like they stand up to to play lotto or go in a cinema or something like that no no no they line up to the play lotto they line up to protect the gamble they line up to go on something like that but they're not going to have to come in the church god had to quicken you and then your soul is being fed by the word your camera's service because your soul is being fed by the word every service they're getting strengthened every savings are getting quicker every service you get in revelation every service you're being empowered and you're going from grace by grace to grace to grace you're going from glory to glory from power to power from strength to strength oh glory to god amen end time evangelism this is background from last week according to malachi 4 he is to bring back the faith that was once delivered to the saints bring them back to the fate of the fathers the pentecostal part in the restoration time this message is yet to see the pentecostal part hallelujah we have message part teaching part word pact but it's a pentecostal part in the restoration time we have to move into that part that's the holy ghost part that's the spirit part that's the quickening part that's where the quickening power comes to quicken the word to you oh glory to god hallelujah understand what the holy ghost is for to anoint the promises to yourself all glory that the promise is not oh dear the promises is here because you are no internet to yourself you have the spirit to anoint it to you oh that's why joshua could say caleb could say if the lord be with me if this quick and power be with me if this anointing be with me if the spirit be with me i shall be able to oh give the lord a shout the nerves do you understand that he wasn't talking intellectual talk you know he was talking spirit talk if the spirit be with me when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart you see what david did when the spirit come upon him what samson did when the spirit come upon him all those brothers when the spirit come upon them that's a different thing altogether that's a different man altogether the spirit has to come upon you oh glory to god and i want that to break up on you tonight that you must know you have to go back to another ephesians we don't want a corinthian church we don't want galatians church all that is good that's scripture we want ephesians we want the original because you could breed back the original we could plant and get back the original oh glory to god hallelujah you can't breed back no hybrid no mule oh glory to god original tower bed horse you could get back that because he know his father is his grandfather is he a storybread horse and when they get a true word believer he is thoroughbred just drop the word on him and he's a big hearty amen just deliver the word to him and because that's nothing but the truth that's a terrible horse believer a sovereign word believer you don't want god to you don't want god to bless you in your own thing there you want to come out of that you want to be quicker like the scripture says hallelujah we were once this way once that way but god had quickened us into the higher order not above the animals but a little lower than the angels oh glory to god so it's the pentecostal part in the restoration time i'll restore saith the lord now everything is hybrid even they got hybrid churches not only hybrid corn hybrid churches hybrid christians took in my shaken hands they can dress better use better english and so forth but that ain't got no life in it you take a big fine a of corn hybrid maybe it's twice as pretty as the other one plant it it will die because have no life in it we don't want nothing hybrid we want the genuine thing [Music] do you want the genuine thing you haven't got it still it still stay there till it comes why accept a substitute when the pentecostal sides are full of real nothing hybrid it won't stand you always have to spray a hybrid plant to keep the bugs over it and that's the way with some of these hybrid christians you have to baby them promise them they'll be deacon and and all kind of things that give the bully bugs if they get if they what what what if they do otherwise they want to leave the church you might join a lot you can join a methodist lodge baptist lodge pentecostal lodge but you can never come to christ but if you ever come to christ you will be born into the church the mystical body of jesus christ you are no more a hybrid you're no mother hitchhiker trying to top me right to heaven anybody going here i've taken a ride you can't come away to heaven you have to be born again that's the first message jesus preached you must be born again mother and father give your first birth but this is the second birth this is the new word you have to be born again you say how of the word and the spirit not word only it has to be word and spirit i'll say it again not word only it has to be word and spirit not i believe the message only it has to be the quickening power the spirit and that's put me in mind a lot of these so-called hybrid christians they have hybrid the church until they got the disease of spiritual amnesia they can't reproduce nothing again they talk about hybrid corn hybrid corn is nothing it's the worst thing ever put in your mouth anything hybrid that's the season you have hotbed plants the reason hotbed plants and hybrid stuff spirit doctor deviate but a genuine thoroughbred you don't have to put no disinfect on him he's got power within himself to keep the bugs over here [Applause] you gotta give them free bible and get them kentucky chicken to come to church you know encourage them with this and encourage them for that and give them this card and shake the hand long and and what not you don't thorough bread terrible oh glory to god my man kai well about five people remember kindly i said fly or die that was my message to fight people richard fly or die imagine a tree fly out oh glory to god i didn't come to them three i come to the two that remain it was a strict case of fly or die could you imagine that and shoot preaching to five people until they fly or die i say come to preach no church members and guess what some flyer some die on some fly some still alive tonight they're still flying look where the kangaroo is still flying over 30 plus years still flying oh those were the days man oh rugged gospel boy even nice that wasn't a gas lamp you know what nothing i was on a gas lamp hallelujah and water from the well oh glory to god when you look back now he said how to be a crazy preacher he had to be something like crazy man wasn't crazy what's our reality that this message come to haunt the elected seats [Music] i was when a fisherman children's net is fishy gonna catch you know but when he pulling her crabs snake wabi all kind of thing he it but he neck all of that but his fishy one and god sent him to catch fish some fish hiding in the bar some fish smoking and drinking some fiction swims in sin but god had to find them waiting god find you you look don't look look at me like a boner christian god find you wherever you are you have to hunt you and find you then then he clean you up no look at you you had it quicken and if you're not quick and yet you will be quicker because the seed alone can be quicker oh give the lord and shelter nerves only the seed alone can be reborn when god created a church he created a pentecostal church no no dead message sitting on church talking about world war ii the original church that ephesians church was a pentecostal church that means that shouting singing jumping praise god pentecostal clapping you can't clap something is wrong because that's part of the pentecostal experience the leaves clapping and then the word comes to me the fruit in the midst of that pentecostal atmosphere before god can send a prophet he had to send on the atmosphere 1906 the atmosphere dropped down and even before that god said behold i sat before the open door so he put a bloodline in the aids before laodicea to bring the spirit itself without no man messenger or give the lord a shout oh glory to god he said i sat before the unopened door i thought was no man open and no man could shut and god open the door to the spirit without putting a man inside of the ear so you don't need a man to bring on the spirit of the lord himself the spirit is already here do you believe that the dynamics is here if we could only get started god will do the rest we have to get started let's get started tonight we're going back to ephesians then fight for earth you don't want the corinthians church you don't want hebrews babies you don't want legalistic galatians you don't want them sinful corinthians you want an ephesians hallelujah praise god that you become god's word manship oh hallelujah for every good work you become god's workmanship he is working on you tonight to produce something out of you or glory to god you are going to be the workmanship not of a man but the workmanship of god oh hallelujah give the lord a shout what do you think the lord himself descended from heaven with a message not my message i don't have a message god sent a message we are echoing a message from a 20th century prophet to prepare your hearts to turn your hearts back to the faith of the fathers because the fate is to go back and pick up what they have back there i want nothing less than that i bought another ephesians i don't want all messengers another ephesians on a bunch of people sitting on walmart in the church benches another ephesians you must think and speak it claim it believe it walk into it i super church that was another ephesians i just predestinated them the adoption that's another ephesians oh glory to god in ephesians you have a fightful ministry an ephesians husband love their wives if ephesians turn over their parents all of that in ephesians we wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers or arrests in ephesians or the devil is finished in ephesians whatsoever in ephesians oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god and ephesians rights obey their husbands in ephesians husbands love their wives what can the lord have shot over after ephesians we're going back to that we're going back to that and he teaches out the faith that was once delivered to the saints we going back to that what kind of faith is that number preaching faith but silver and gold have i known such as i give it unto you the blind have to see the death have to hear the people have to walk they have to walk but if not no but they have to walk between participation [Music] [Applause] oh glory to god [Applause] my god you may be seated in this original championship match ephesians was caught heavyweight champions follow original undefeated undisputed that was the original church that was god's masterpiece oh glory to god behold my sons and your computer oh yeah but that is a different man now that's a transformed man that's an ephesus man there's a man back in the garden of eden then fellas went back into the academic anointing that's why peter said silver and gold have i known such as i have i gave he wasn't asking no bishop no no no no no ministers association permission to do anything peter was standing there alone he has said this was never done before anybody ever do this before if anybody he wasn't asking a question what was the precedent that my lawyers could be so miserable you could never go by president but when god said to do you think i'm not president this was never done before oh all right right right like the lawyers have talked about the case studies oh all right the law says so and 10 years ago and this judge says so and so but god hasn't do with that the president is still president doctors say what this case was never healed before and and when you're so bad in sickness you're on your way to the dead dead again one week to live there's no precedent that anybody coming from that that will doctors say that's not what god says we're breaking precedence we breaking what people understand breaking past the intellect you're breaking past the strong barrier you're breaking past your imagination your affection you've been past all of that you're bringing pastor all things are possible you want to know all things are possible not with god but with them that believe and these signs shall follow i wanted to hit you with you real good these signs shall follow not no pastor not no evangelist not no bishop these signs shall follow them that believe yeah who's that damn that believer they who is they damn that believer they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover oh glory to god who is that that's them that believe not them who don't believe forget them is that not that scripted not for them but then they believe that's you i'm talking about i am a believer you are a believer if we lay hands upon the sick they shall recover oh glory shall speak in new tongues that's not a pentecostal thing that is waiting oh give the lord a shout thomas get a bad name but that is our thing that is sin mark 16 in action we shall speak with new tongues glory to god hallelujah to speak in tongues tonight oh glory to god speak [Applause] [Music] and paul indicated that when the snake bit him and he shake the snake off and it's they didn't kill him he shake it off showing the power of the blood is more powerful than snake poison think about it now think about it the power of the blood of jesus is more powerful than snake poisoning [Applause] original church was a pentecostal church do we get that a pentecostal church filled with the holy ghost men and women led by the spirit of god not a man from somewhere by the spirit the thing was steven tell them you stiff neck are not circumcised he was a dick he was not preacher he said you do resist the holy ghost anointed yes led by god hallelujah man watch watch a pentecostal affair with the holy ghost men and women led by the spirit of god man couldn't leave that alone he wanted to hybrid the church so he bred the world with the theology doctrines and indonesia you see they could argue over that because they might talk to you better than your doctrine i agree with your doctrine that wasn't what god had in the beginning you know copenhagen because peter couldn't explain too much a doctrine because he was an unknown fisherman all he had was defeat [Music] that was delivered and the faith was jesus christ in him because the wisdom of god is right on the shoulder [Applause] so that is why gwadar to choose a man named saul flip him over and tell him to paul because he was in the enemy camp a soul so god doesn't do a fruit because god knows he needs an educated man together in them scriptures to break the old testament and reveal the new testament so he couldn't get peter to do that he had to find a hook no jesus educated man and learned the man but filled that little man with the holy ghost he's a holy ghost learned man not a learned man a holy ghost fell in man so when that fire burned into porsche paul went in the desert paulie consult no human being fire fight all around him you see in god and wrote the ten commandments such a right paul would get called revelation and paul said i know him by revelation i am with a little flesh i walk with jesus i have fish with jesus i have walked on galilee i see this i see that but i paul a prisoner of jesus christ i call an apostle to the gentiles well glory to god any man take himself to be spiritual let him acknowledge what i say is the commandments of the lord and if he believes he would let him be ignorant that's a man sent from god he could speak for god they could speak like god oh get the lord and shout him to her [Applause] so god could take paul flip him over hallelujah so paul was a double agent hallelujah satan thought he was working for him but he was always an agent of god hallelujah god had him like a sky and then paul said to say what you think you this and that i won't be full said this and early pharisees in the pharisees i i born in this and born in that and i call that a dumb amen i fully qualified to talk a lot to holly talking so you can't be no pharisees into me i am i was a pharisee of the pharisees i knew this thing well good man this flesh thing i know this thing i know this gun on this tall hat and all these rares and tears and what did i know about all of that it was seen i was pressing in the church don't talk to you talk i had zeal i was running them down but god had more seals for me man god sent fire to run me down and god threw me off my high horse oh glory to god now i know who he is and i know who i am oh glory to god give the lord a [Music] so don't shout up on anybody pray for them that the bloodhound will go after them the holy ghost will go after them pray for them we serve a living god a god that delivers a god that rescues a god that restores oh give the lord a shout you know what i said he is still a deliverer so you can be delivered tonight he can break the bands off of you and the weights are for your life that is what the gospel is for oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah i send them to the upper room to wait there until the holy ghost come upon them to be ordained ministers of the lord but hybrid and bringing the church into theology instead of letting the holy spirit lead it they bred in bishops general overseers when the holy spirit is god's original leader of the church they hybrid the church like the chicken they did the same with the mule they did the same with everything else i breathed making it different breeding in the world basketball games soup suppers bunker games what kind of things it's prettier bigger building polish nasa people singing is more orderly in the notes in the notes sometimes you're saying it's informational instead of inspirational we need more inspirational and informational because we have to get in the spirit oh glory to god hallelujah praise god the old fashioned pentecostal with tambourine and the guitar but it hasn't got the seed it hasn't got a ring to it life isn't right in breeding god wants it the way that he made it in the beginning so the church has been hybrid and now we come to a place where the church is more like a lodge any church here we go that left its original foundation has never been able to come over again i know people don't like this but this is the truth when god sent looter he had a revival he strapped the world but they organized it hydrated by the world and they produced a catholic church and when they did what did he do he produced a bunch of renegades hybrids never rose and never will rise along come john wesley same thing after the messenger gone the seven of god gone they hybrid it and that's it now here we go now let's take a tree of fate that eve taking of this forbidden tree of unbelief then we can make a text come out of it it was fate she disbelieved god's word god said that says everything will happen she ought to have left it alone she ought to have believed that the way god said it but no satan committed theology mixed it she gave it to adam it caused a hybrid fate it's our faith and it has hybrid faith and that's what the church so-called have a hybrid field it is mixed here we go are you ready this fate is mixed with fears dumps frustration if it was genuine faith it wouldn't move genuine faith would say god said so that's why the prophet said when a church is believing that the holy ghost is just as real as it was on the day of pentecost how they groan and cry but when they are born and positionally born then god sets in the church pastors teachers i know he hasn't been preached when they believe the holy ghost is just as real you don't want unless holy ghost they don't want a modern holy ghost you don't want that interpretation holy ghost you don't want to be the holy ghost before getting the holy ghost you want the same holy ghost that felony are pentecost no other votes [Applause] no one of those but the holy ghost itself the same one peter had [Music] tongues of fire sat upon them and the bible said they were filled with the holy ghost the bible never said they were the holy ghost and there's a full revelation praise god no no no no no they were filled with it i mean but i believe somebody got the holy ghost but you have enough to stop lying and whatnot don't want to fill every fiber you're being you know what it'll be filled with the holy ghost every fighter alien therefore the holy ghost inside john started jam your atoms already you know all you need is the next holy ghost on the outside and your atoms in between you know you're on your way to the rapture area you have raptured holy what's inside of you all you need is one for the body outside i went fire on the inside and fire the outside you know longer when you're making big the fire on top on fire below like good old-fashioned coconut bake oh gloria before that stove hallelujah praise god bake fire on top and fire below but god put in fire on the inside of you first and thoughts are in a fire on the outside we shall be changing the moment in a twinkling of an eye this mortal will put on immortality and this corruption will put an interruption oh glory to god but you have to have the fire inside oh glory to god they fire me inside we'll talk to the fire on the outside but you have to have the fire on the inside oh god the lord that shell what about him said we're taking love to enter there love is nothing ahead love has to be in your heart hallelujah he loved the animal he loved this he loved that the love is the greatest power there is has to let somebody who don't love you come to you and see how you're dealing with that you have to be able to love your enemies you have to have enemies for that to happen you can't be all mr nicey and mrs nicey everybody nice god must set up this thing for you man i mean god set it up is to test you not the tested enemies to test you there will be no excuses you have to love your enemies you have to go be on your own you have to go beyond the scribe and pharisees they can't love who likeable to you and who you like you have to demonstrate to be like god have the love of god in your spirit in your heart and your soul oh get the lord shout that's why they probably said one day we'll be talking and loving just jump into the building and all the evil will be taken out it has to happen because we have to go back to another ephesians we have to go back to that first love that love descended it was upon them it was the bond of perfectness it was charity the bride's absolute oh glory to god upon a bunch of people that that love can't fail let me be seated that love can't fail to receive the prostitute oh glory to pull the bar the bomb and the drunkard all the liquor all out of it oh hallelujah take the desire oh that's that's christianity not you stop drinking you know but something come take the desire out you hear what i said that's quickening power ah that's when god quickened you you're smoking your tamper your marijuana you're cooking whatever drugs and guacamole then you change on the inside same old sweat man but inside man something happened inside you god richard mercy but god hallelujah it wasn't for but god but god on your way to another ephesians you journey into a place you're not here you're journey into a place this church is on its way to the journey you're getting tools for the journey you've come here to be empowered for this journey oh god you're only your journey you're on your way but let the devil tap your mind you're on your way don't let the devil say you're not going anywhere you're on your way come on from egypt to the promised land you're journeying you are present from justification and signification to the baptist you're pressing your way say amen press your way keep on pressing [Applause] a hybrid faith is condemned by god i'm reading a hybrid faith is condemned by god it's no good stay away from it it is evil that's big that's speaker that's that that's a skill military is a night hybrid fit it's evil it brings doubts maybe i'll go up and get healed maybe the lord will heal me that's hybrid feet it's not that's church feet we want god's fate god is something that's the truth stay with it so when the blind man came but around pray for him say you're healed you come back in the prayer line again said pray for your heal now in reality but a random card you don't have that man again he is healed his faith hasn't connected to his healing yet but he's here it's pronounced it's upon him so he was a catholic so he had to get something to rest his fate on super given the words say by your stripes i'm healed so after you leave it by shaman here by shabbat i'm here by shrapnel that's and he dropped from here to here i [Applause] [Applause] dynamite time laughter we're having a shout in time a rejoicing time of holy ghost time oh give the lord a show let people laugh let people laugh let them learn but you're sealed in and the devil is healed out oh glory you're on your way to the rapture you're on your way to the coming of the lord oh glory to god amen he said stay away from it it's evil it brings doubt maybe i'll be healed that's hybrid faith that's church faith we want god's fate then he said well i wish my words were wrote with an iron pen stay with what god said it's the truth hybrid faith reads hebrews 13 it says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and when a hierarchy come and say well in a certain way in a certain way he's either the same or not the same if the same condition comes you have to act the same way he has to forgive the same way you have to heal the same way you have to raise the dead the same way devils have to cast out the same way because he's the same yesterday today and forever we have to prove that in this message it can't be god was with brother branham and where is god today no he's the same yesterday today and forever he is still a god of miracles but you have to believe in miracles you have to want a miracle you have to be expecting a miracle you have to be looking for a miracle america for your own soul for your own sight for your own body for your own spirit so i don't want you to be contented i want you to shake off that spirit of contentment but i will mess up the message of the day people say that where they passed outside here with the church time for the elders and the deacons everybody that go into a nice church and that nice word nice teachings and so on and they happy with the man but is god happy with him it's what happened with the church uh is the church back to ephesians what do we have this church that we exhorted and sharing thoughts every sunday every wednesday or do we see efficient as a vision that's my target then that's my goal then yeah i'm gonna be passionate corinthians but i want to be destination that you are passing through somebody passed you walk on different churches without your destination you passed to them because it wasn't entirely enough to what it's supposed to be but you have to see the vision of where it's supposed to be you say right the vision will make it plain it has to have a world vision a scriptural vision god planted an original seed where is that tree it had denominational brands grafted in and got keep cutting them out of cutting off and the tree kept pushing up pushing up pushing up but at the end another original branch will come forward will produce another original fruit because it's god's planting oh glowing a goddess hybrid faith plant them other seeds inside the deer but the original branch is pushing we want another pentecost people say we get it already that is them they are dry pentecost we don't want that prey because we're not saying that wonders we don't want that telling us with word word we don't want that we want the same thing we are returning to another ephesians oh give the lord a shout hallelujah [Applause] [Music] soul people figure i don't like mystery they feel like fighting history but christ is the mystery of god really if you want to show me the [Music] message but i see what kind of bad behavior and bad boy thing and gangster and thuggery you want to tell me is that mysteries behind that that is the mystery to me holy could preach mystery and be a thug how you can preach mystery and be so unchristian like that is a mystery to me hallelujah so i look to see what is the life behind the name i want to know what is it like behind the mystery oh glory to god i have nothing against mysteries that will become a mystery so i'll be against myself then i'm a mystery a hidden one too hallelujah you know you are hitting the street you know that brother was hidden in the seals paul irenaeus martin columba looted they were hit in no sea devil only seen red horse white or stay lost but behind all of that there were men of god standing behind there that the devil couldn't figure out [Applause] of the children to be turned literally back to the faith of the father and these seven tenders will do it turn their hearts back literally but what i realized it had to be translated oh glory to god whatever currency you know the currency is fit you can show god a prayer bible and say god because i have this in my hand uh you have to answer my prayer you're born to like to kind of like and expect god to answer you because you like to gather god's saying what is that god can't translate that that can't affect the kingdom two candles say to our father and treat mary that can't affect the kingdom god even hearing that you call it priest designer a man make that god can't even hear that a next man will come up to me temple and lord i am not like that man out there i paid twice i do this i do that today the man said oh you're not even going to church he will god i've always supported me as sinner jesus jesus said which one were righteous man on the outside he recognized he's a sinner this man is a sinner anointed not he attributed because of what he does to be righteousness and god watching attribute to what's in his heart so the confession of him to come in lord have mercy upon me god recognize that ahead of the mother man in tiny temple playing right just because he caught long and he got mad looking white god not looking at garment god looking at coat god looking at what's in the heart so it come back to our gospel in the heart and that's what peter got converted his heart got converted now the mind is he gave me to the soul the mind he channeled to get down to the womb of your spirit so it has to have a channel which is the mind that's where the word has to come first so of course there's always mental but it drops into spiritual it drops into the heart and it becomes a divine revelation that you actually possess oh glory you'll possess it when it dropped down inside of here it is yours and when it dropping inside of here there is no demon could go beyond there to take what god put in your heart and that's why the prophet said whatever your soul whatever the faith lead your soul to believe that is yours oh glory that you hear that once god leaves your soul your faith to believe it that is yours oh hallelujah praise god oh god you understand that so the woman with the blood issue there was no scripture saying if she touched me man she took that for herself she told herself that and it went so deep it went like a revelation into her spirit so she was convinced that if she only get there she'll be healed that's why she pushed it where she pushed if she was on this level when she see the crowd around jesus she came back and go back home but she said today is my day i ain't going nowhere some big big fella standing up there that end intimidating huh a bunch of men standing up there twiddling their bears and watching jesus okay he shall not do with that they don't believe nothing they only come to try to interpret the master but she come for a touch she said if i could touch him of his garment that's all she comes from she comes from her touch she has come to debate his words she'll come to question his words she'll come take a quote and debating thing abductional theology all she wants is a touch [Music] because she had a problem and she had a need and she needed a breakthrough and she pushed and she pressed you hear what happened something struck a heart and when something strike your heart that is how you could push and press if you just strike a hat you have no pushing and you have no person you're just thinking about it oh glory to god but once you strike your heart you say wait a minute you mean i could live higher than that wait a minute i could get a picture tonight wait a minute my home don't have to have that atmosphere i could change the atmosphere around my life i can live in a higher atmosphere and when you see that you could push now you can press now you can create the atmosphere now you can believe god now oh glory to god are you with me tonight hallelujah glory to god so what the bible teaches the new birth and the subject of handshakes everything else to the new birth but it can never take the place of the new book it's got to be an experience to be born again so the intellectuals said a new book is the revelation of jesus christ maybe what experience now there's a quote but the prophet said the new book is experienced so the question may ask which is first is it our experience or is it revelation those are the revelation and state with revelation alone the other people just our revelation so i'm born again but he said a new book got to be an experience something that you know a birth is a mess so what we say now the revelation come first experience come after supporting revelation and let go give you an experience that something has quickened in your life do you believe that hallelujah glory to god so watch abandon a baby is born we all know a buddhist is a mess when a baby is born if it's on the floor if it's on a shock pile if it's a pink decorative hospital it's a mess but it brings life and that is what the new bird is it's a mess hallelujah no no it's a mess it's a mess it's a mess but it brings life that's what a new word is it's a mess but it brings life and in style or put on or decoration that creeds is the bathroom they go so i will do believe the doctrine you have and i don't see it so much it'd be very different but what are they doing the new word means called blood start to flow inside of you the new word means that you are quickened to life the new word mean you are son and daughter of god then under the blood of jesus we can have fellowship because the blood of jesus covers you it covers me also isn't that right so watch now i know you get it from the altar crying on boohoo and squealing and slobbering it brother brings life it takes the stat out of you it makes you something you ought to be it takes all the world and stiffneck out of you isn't that right and that you said no watch i take jesus and my personal savior today we will come and say i take jesus for my personal savior listen to the ram that will never take the place of the new bird when men and women come to the altar and forget where they are and who is around them until they really die out and are born again all night prayer meetings and the power of the holy ghost get back into the church again oh glory to god and that is why we have an all night permitted from 10 to 6 on friday coming here right here in the church and anybody don't see you tell them don't miss it oh glory to god hallelujah praise god you're tired come to it amen come and wrestle with god come and cry out come and be born again come and get the delivered come and get set free oh my my my my praise god so man who are born of the spirit of god is god's sons and daughters they don't mix with the world they're not hybrid they stay with god they stay with the program they stay with the spirit they don't want none of them hybrid stuff don't be carried away with hybrid stuff it's not right it will finally come to its end it can't go back when it's hybrid it's finished it can never reproduce itself again oh my hallelujah praise god do you believe that glory hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you lord so john what was john to do restore the faith the father was once the real seed that was in the garden of eden to take god's word where it was hybrid by christian into christianity john come back he said hallelujah to shake the nation before the great and terrible day of the lord comes that's john mission the anointed one that's brother branham to bring back the fate oh glory to god so oh my hallelujah i'm going to skip that o praise the name of the lord thank you jesus hallelujah glory to god amen we are we said version 10 in version 10 we find out the last messenger of the last age during the time of his prophecy that seven seas will be open the seven mysteries seven full mystery had been left off in every age had something left off the reformer didn't have time to take care of it there's a looter he preached justification by faith and he's gone and then come with representification knock on the pentecostal but we are promised according to version 10 going to malachi 4 according to luke 17 20 there's a common ephesians to this that's the prophecy there's a common ephesians to this and that these seven four measures of the word must be unfolded and it's the loudest age where this takes place i believe we're in the shadow of the coming of the son of god and as joshua just before the ephesians raised up so that john the baptist raised up just before the next ephesians and we are promised another ephesians that's a promise that's that's the promise you heard what this promise not corinthians not hebrews not galatians ephesians is promised that's what you're looking for that's what you come in the church for you want the ephesians man of god to stand there in the pulpit one that have ephesians four is that right pastor teacher prophet that's what you want inside of here oh glory to god man harlem louisville manchester family got together the house of god that's great but division oh glory to mankate family or whatever it is how could we even take care of the house of god that could that could go good for corinthians but not divisions so when ephesians ministers are lined up with the word when that which is perfect has come that which is part is done over it well ephesians is that which is perfect so all this part preaching and path ministry and path this that is finished with when we come to ephesians so when you see it come to real ephesians ministers will have to sit down qualify for that level we're not even talking about being placed in the body and place a position but you know you talk about that we don't want ephesians coming back to that it has to be visions you know have to be the word standard the correct kind of deacons the correct kind of elders everybody have to stand up to it i tell you i'm the boss not that it's decisions all men jack line up with that it's not my standard it's god's standard in other words it's the plumb line when a man put the plumber you just hang it like that if you build them crooked it's crooked then you know the plumb line fault you can't bend the plumb line you just drop the plumb line the problem and show you how straight it is if it's crooked it will plummet will expose it because ephesians is the plumb line it has the original line that is the original word that we got for the original seed that's the god for the original life and incisions that's the plot line oh glory to god satan knows assuredly the original church was mark 16 in action always is false satan know the original church is the church with the power in it the lord himself went everywhere with them satan knows that we are coming back to that sin mark 16 20 the lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following oh glory to god we have to have a confirmation of the world that's being preached oh glory to god amen oh give the lord a shout oh this is going good tonight hallelujah hallelujah redemption isn't too bad coming out of and going into we came with a catholic or the methodist or the baptist but we got to go into ephesians come on come on come on now we come into the message but we have to go into ephesians [Applause] for a prophet talking about a certain prophet and elijah what that is good they commented the message by the message they get your division god sent moses to get israel out egypt was not from islam all right so you want to build a church in egypt that's you you might get egyptian name even pharaoh is a bigot says that sends some bricks for you but the promise is not egypt so when joseph they all died he said listen give me a pledge when you're leaving here not if when you leave don't leave my bones here take my bones with you because resurrection is in the promised land well where the rapture is is it efficient another wrapped in a current yet think about it now rapture is an ephesians you have to go into another ephesians to go in the rapture because that's where the faith is that and you have to have rapture and faith to be changed not hybrid faith rapturing faith that's why raptured hybrid fruit is evil it's god is a deceitful fate it makes people think because they believe the message they have arrived and that time they had their own journey they have to go normally ephesians and it's a battle to get there because he's jordan in front of you oh give the lord a shout o give the lord and shall be in the word tonight this is dossier the lord tonight this is the message who nobody want to cross jordan because the water is cold it's better cells is depth to what you think is depth to what you feel for the last 20 years hallelujah and god rocking you because a new season's about to break upon us don't miss that all night permitting oh give the lord a shout oh hallelujah have the bulleted into ephesians 1 oh hell placed into ephesians heavenly places in christ jesus oh we're going to strike it tonight we're gonna hit it you know this just gonna hit ephesians i was raised up for this i believe i was born for this we're going to hit another ephesians nobody could stop it nobody is hindering you nobody's hindering me it's just the fate that god said it we believe it that just settles it oh glory to god we are returning to another ephesians [Applause] tell the truth you may be seated hallelujah all them gossipers and whoever and bad mothers and whatnot and negative people inside of here tell them that when they start the negative telling you go back on ephesians and that can't survive in ephesians hallelujah tell them liars that can't survive any visions because the prophet said just as anastasia was judged in another ephesians it will have that same kind of judgment again because fire will be upon peter these men will be upon peter holy ghost discernment the anointing will be upon peter holy ghost hebrews 4 12 these thoughts and intents of the heart to return back into the church no liars are coming inside of there no evil workers coming they'll be exposed oh glory to god hallelujah because we're going back to another ephesians sin can't come in because we're going back to another ephesians ephesians being a church that even sin could come inside of it it'll be called out have to be repented of downstairs before they come upstairs oh glory to god of fire hanging over the building pillow of fire hanging in the church pillar of fire hanging in the pulpit kill our fire all around oh glory to god why we're going back to another ephesians angelic horse angelic visitations angel of lord and camping around those that fear him oh give the lord our praise we're going back to angels we're going back to angelic hosts we're going back to another ephesians going back to the supernatural all this ordinary natural thing supernatural where there is god there is supernatural you can't express god without the supernatural all this word word has got to be beyond the word hallelujah that's why paul said i come with preaching that your faith rests in the power of god i've got the wisdom of man oh hallelujah let's continue glory to god pray amen oh we on target tonight this is the world tonight let's continue redemption has two different parts come out of entering into first you have to come out of some people want to bring the world in with them but you got to come out of the world to enter into christ you've got to come out of unbelief to enter into faith there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine faith you must absolutely leave everything contrary to the word behind and this book of ephesians of the old testament is joshua and moses represent the law that could not save no one but grace could and joshua here it means jehovah savior and now we find out we have come to another ephesians where here we go in our intellectual denominations and all our educational programs has come to his jordan so now after 40 years of preaching and teaching and explaining and debating and exhorting it coming to an end where is the power say come down to our jordan amen we must then watch then watch watch in our intellectual denomination and so forth all our educational programs has come to jordan then we must have an ephesians again we must have an exodus to come out and go into for the rapture for what for what so ephesians is for the rapture then to go in the rapture you have to return to ephesians could we give the lord a shout how many of us stand out tonight how many see that tonight to go in the rapture you have to go to another season [Music] subs probably one of the greatest criticisms of the full gospel church is not positionally knowing what they are in christ jesus i always said i made two classes of people one of them is full gospel another fundamental fundamental knows where he's standing positionally only he's never been born again but he's head on point he mountain point he could talk on point everything is forget it you can't you can't get away from how he can explain it but he's not born again just fundamental teaching alone so he doesn't have any faith and if there's no faith of course you'll expect new miracles right no signs no powers no worship no anointing no nothing because the faith is not there or the understanding of who they are that's there but not the fate but watch so it's just and the full gospel has been born again but don't know where he stands now if i could get the full gospel pentecostal faith and the fundamental believers or the fundamental believers doctrine on the pillar of faith we have it made right it's like a man that can write a check but he hasn't have any money back you have a nice signature but you have no money so he you ever see a consignor the other man have money in the mark but he can't sign that's trouble you need to get the two together you won't have money and the signature i think everybody's smiling right now because that's what you want i want the same thing too i'm gonna have money in the bank okay so watch one got the money in the mouth they can't write a check they don't have to write the check you gotta want anybody but if you get those two together oh praise the name of the lord so buddha brown says if you put the life of jesus in the donut body of believers it would bear the same fruit the first one did they will write another book of acts behind them because they were the same life see what i mean you can't get away from it blind leaders of the mind god holds this key alone theologians can tell you it is not known it's hid from them they know nothing about it god here we go is known by simplicity and revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person not my theology is the revelation of jesus christ that's the spirit itself revealing that's why you come in the spirit that's why you're saying that's why you worship because in the spirit you could get defined revelation god making himself known by revelation but god doesn't own it make himself known by revelation he makes them known by manifestation also oh glory to god hallelujah upon historically my church no other rocks accepted no other schools accepted no nothing exactly the revelation of the jesus christ chewed a new world he is born in there he injects his own life your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people and they see the very life one works to signs wonders that he did is doing through you are you ready outside of that the rest of it is not even called at all outside the death we've just said here call of duty says yes sir watch god's great revelation unfolding and yet he said this by lack of this revelation is why we have so many visions among us so much mockery so much division among us is because the people like that revelation they lack that revelation the teachers he said the teachers lack the revelation it is jesus christ himself being revealed again isn't that right so paul said i come among you and i thank brother george for this quote but not with the excellent your speech declaring to you the testimony of god i come in weakness and fear and much trembling and my preaching was not with enticing words of my wisdom but here we go in demonstration of the spirit and power you see there is the gospel go into the world and preach the gospel didn't say go teach so all this teaching place your positionally that is just part of it teaching places positionally that you could have the faith to receive the spirit he didn't say go and teach he said go preach in other words here we go get into that demonstrate the power these signs shall follow just teaching doesn't do it it takes the actual spirit itself demonstrating these signs remember the clients not teaching teaching alone can't do it so all this teaching and teaching four hours teaching teaching three hours teaching teaching ten hours teaching teaching that alone can do it it will take the spirit oh glory to god and how you're getting that no you're gonna cry for it you're going to pray for it you're going to call on god for it you're going to get in the spirit of it it will take the spirit there has to be a transitioning into the spirit realm in this message and we are going nowhere the raptor no intellectual thing if it doesn't be so we should be in rapture ready if the rapturous books and death we should have been long gone because we all in this thing now oh glory to god be green in this thing now oh glory to god we're still here it will take up power so he said when the power of this church rises it will bring the brethren when the power of that church rises it will bring the brethren oh he said national force put the church in the world come to the churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride okay the lord i shall feel anointed tonight i feel inspired tonight because it will take the power of god not a mighty teacher the power of god not the mighty apostle the power of god that the mighty evangelist the power of god that the mighty pastor the power of god not the mighty prophet the power of god it will take the power to put you inside of the earth we need power oh lord send the power just now and baptize everyone [Applause] teaching alone wouldn't do it i'm done done i don't know it i have a few more things oh musicians come and play oh god teaching alone won't do it it will take the power and demonstration oh glory could you imagine that we come and service 15 minutes of this man don't preach what do you waste your time for not not the goal of 50 minutes ago before god knows that [Music] so how he got perfectly sick sometimes sick service people are sick that might take a hour praying for sick people i could see crippled coming inside of here i could see lame walking i could see blind singing god have to demonstrate his power god has to do it where there is god but anthony you could come up where there is god there is supernatural are you expecting i want you to come here under expectation for the supernatural not only for your body to be healed but your spirit and your soul all them complex in your mind and your heart something from long time 20 years ago this happened that happened that happened and you still can't get over this and they still can't get over this and your father one day mama said father never give my long pants but he's a big man marrying her children and he's still body but his father never gave my lung thanks and there was this short pants and long pants was the executive thing all kind of complexes in people's mind could be a place what kind of issues inferiorly complex are shy i don't know people seeing me when you're coming you feel everybody's seeing you nobody willing with you but you put eyes all around all around you have a soul a drone on top over that examining yourself in your own eyes in your own mind that complex message i don't want to translate you oh god this is good into the kingdom of his son god wants to take you where you are right now and translate you into the kingdom of his son where you could see the higher order oh god see woman cut through the tattoo on his shoulder another way he dressed up that he should tattoo my show so that make you think everybody i put that together they put tattooing as a hidey tattoo god say jesus here put a light in there put it you don't hide it don't be pushing so when god lights you up is to put you as a as a billboard you must walk and you must say oh boy look look jesus walk in there look look her son is walking there look like a daughter is walking there he's different she's different i don't know why but but you're vibes in something you see on the platform but ramen talk about a man come up there he said you're a christian he said what you should belong to who is your pastor why do you believe no he said you're christian he said i could tell somebody's a christian in five minutes amen and there are people in this message cannot tell when people is christian they look you up they look it down look at how you're looking they might assume because there's no discernment of the spirit that's been purposed one time they're trying to bring off about abraham and complain about a woman who dress was a little short played piano hannah look look at she you say but you have a fine spirit all we need is a we need how could a man know somebody's a christian in five minutes time how much talk you could talk how much mystery you could talk is what your vibes and if if he could say as a christian you think that demons and devils don't know that they're christians so when the devil see you walking say cross cross first of course of course you should cause you you don't want to mess with that you don't want to tamper with it there's a genuine one coming when you see a hybrid a hypocrite he says would you walk with me then lucy follows i could work with him because as a hybrid he involved in hybrid stuff he was twisting and manipulating but the original non-hybrid he's staying far because here original not even jewelry will fall like conflict that's original that's original oh glory to god blasphemy blessing and speaking the word that's original let's all stand our way to the lord oh glory to god [Music] there is no one no one
