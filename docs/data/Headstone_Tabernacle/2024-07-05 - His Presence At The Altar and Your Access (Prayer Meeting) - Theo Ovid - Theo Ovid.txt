convention before you we don't know if this is our last convention we know the world is heading down to turmoil and real uh rough times that lays ahead we don't know what going to be taking place as the weeks and months unfold but we know we are under your care we under your prophecy so help us tonight and make yourself known to your people bless every Minister that will step forward to minister in this upcoming convention bless all the testimonies the greetings may it been glory to you bless all the Believers who would come out and may they be refreshed revived Be Inspired of you granted God in Jesus I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thanks again for coming out tonight it's a blessing to be here and if you have your Bibles all you turn to Exodus chapter 20 we want to read verse 17 to 24 Exodus 20 this is after this is Moses Gets In The Ten Commandments and we just want to take up just to the end of it there and go forward and this is verse 17 of Exodus 20 it says God speaking Thou shalt not cover thy neighbor's house Thou shalt not cover thy neighbor's wife nor his manservant nor his maid servant nor his Ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbors Verse 18 and all the people saw the thunderings the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the M Mountain smoking or when the people saw it they removed and stood a far off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us least we die and Moses said unto the people fear not for God is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that he sner note those words that Moses told them that his fear may be before you your faces that you sin not and the people stood a far off and Moses Drew near unto the thick Darkness where God was and the Lord said unto Moses thus Thou shalt say unto the children of Israel ye have seen that I have talked with you from Heaven he shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall he make unto you gods of gold an altar of Earth thou shal make unto me and shall sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and thine oxen in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee may God bless his word praise the lord we just so glad tonight for the scriptures other title of this exaltation tonight his presence at the altar and your access that's the title have tonight his presence at the altar and your access what a Time on Wednesday night and to think that our bodies are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and God wants us to see it that way he want us to see this house that we are in is a tabernacle and he want to dwell there in so let's go now sin broke man access the presence the presence of God now remember what God told them eat of all the trees by the tree in the midst don't touch it because the day that day you shall surely die but more than just that they will actually run out not just of the Garden of Eden but out of presence access to God's presence so you know God is not like a man if you have to see somebody important we have to go through much of hurdles and securities and everything else be it a mayor a CEO a Prime Minister President whatever but God wanted man to have access to him without complications man was driven out of the garden of out of his presence and I am seeing that the Altar and I wrote this down here was the intersection point of man and God through sacrifice and offering so even at the ending of The Ten Commandments God told them make me an altar of Earth and of that altar You' offer peace offering you offer sheep and everything else because we know why uh the connection back to God is a sacrifice and at that time what was accepted was the blood of birs and coats and so like that so the altar was the place where presence was restored where the blood price was offered because instead of man dying the sheep or the lamb or the goat or whatever they died in the place of us man now Mark 15 37-38 and Jesus cried with a low voice and give up The Ghost and the veil of the temple was rent in between from the top to the bottom so here it is at Calvary when Jesus died Jesus by getting that Veil rent from the top to the bottom it show that you no longer need a high priest to go in one once a year but now you had Direct access to his presence and we find out that that we find out that that is what God wanted the people to see direct access now I want to share something with you I think last year around June June 2 or so I preach a message exalting a message about building an altar is a building of your prayer life a place where you could contact God a place where you have a communion with God and a fellowship with God now listen to this from the prophet and he says here now when God run them out and says now that man know good and evil L he put forth his hand and take of the tree of life and eat and live forever and the Lord sent him forth out the Garden of Eden to tell the ground for when he was taken so he drove man and he placed at the East of Eden cherubin with swords flaming swords to keep them from the tree of life because if man take a hold of the tree of life he can live forever notice these terrains they they kept the tree of life and gaed it and we know that Jesus said I am the way I'm the bread and so like that I'm the life so therefore now I want to show this to you this is important I read this at that time I want to show you now and make this show it's an altar now this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden I'll tell you why do you remember both Cain and Abel come here to worship so that shows that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar here you again here you are again back to Eden through the Altar and they were they were to keep the way there and guard it and they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood so of course this is an Old Testament requirement but then all this was prophecy that the lamb perfect lamb was coming with Jesus Christ and with his blood now we have a perfect sacrifice because the presence now come at the altar and here what he said now he say oh God can people see it nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat this altar of judg M must become a mercy seat and when this alar if the blood is lifted there will stand on that Judgment Day the fire of God the r to G that tree again Garden at the gate another thing I want you to notice Cain Bible said Cain went out from the presence of the Lord at the gate at the Garden so here we go listen carefully so the presence of the Lord must have been at the altar and the altar was at the gate so this altar that we speak about because remember the word that we've been preaching for the past few days or so uh present your bodies a Living Sacrifice a Living Sacrifice to be placed upon God's altar so the presence of the Lord must have been at the altar and the altar was at the gate he said Glory it is God's dwelling place at his altar so I will say this tonight sin's purpose is to cut off access from your father to keep you powerless and in a defeated state so the object of the devil working over time to get you into slackness into looseness into sin into sexual deviations or whatever the object of that is to cut you off from presence because in presence you have access to all that you have need of now the prophet preer message in another and he was describing the seraps and the seraphim and burners and actually the seraphim is the one who receed the sacrifice that cleanses the worshipper and then presents him to God so I want you to think from a natural standpoint you may see people come up to Natural altar or people about there in prayer or get into crying or or seeking the Lord and so on like but what is actually happening there is that Sarahs are the ones that cleanses the worshipper and then presents him to God this seraphim was Angelic beings and they are the very one that stands right at the altar and they receive the sacrifice it shows the justice of God and that sin here we go cannot come in his presence unless it has been atoned for now the reason that I could say that is present at the altar and your access is because not everyone have access to presence because the prophet said the altar itself is guarded that no scalian could access that presence so you could see by for knowledge God called you and he called you not to stay as you are human natural ordinary caral but he called you that you could come up higher into the spirit and recognize that your predestination is what you are predestined onto or what God ordained for you to go onto and that is to come back to Eden by The Altar and through the altar so the Sarah a being that stands next to God and they guard this altar now brother in here let's go we go talking about at the altar right talk about you must be born again he says when you go to church and accept their Creed and their forms of baptism that you supposed to yourself to lay up there you might have get up and shivering speaking in Tong R over the FL FL you might get up beeping but if that offering here we go has been received by God it consumed the world the world is dead to you you are gone for we reckon ourselves dead and buried we are dead we are HID in Christ and hid in Christ when our souls here we go is placed upon the altar of divine judgment so note we are going away from church away from building away from organization away from I am in the message and I believe the message we're not going there we're going to you being a tabernacle being a temple being a house being a true worshipper being a priest being one who have access not through the pastor not through an elder not through a man but having direct access to God by his Spirit okay so watch when our souls is placed upon the altar of divine judgment what was the penalty death and when you lay yourself upon the altar of God death upon the sinner how can you raise from there alive in sin if God accepted the sacrifice here we go now you die see the message say you are the bride and you are the this you that and watch the you speak the word but this is the process to get to that you die you actually are consumed you are petrified there is no more left to you but just this form you are standing in like the brass serpent like Christ was when he took him dead and Co off the cross you are dead until his judgment has actually killed your senses Oh you mean these senses have to be killed yes the senses that trip you into anger trip you into temper trip you into misbehaving trip you into going to the wrong places trip you in wrong reactions because you're in your flesh and you're getting upset and this one offend you and you get upset and you're getting mad and all of that this judgment actually kill your senses you might say well I'm going to turn a new page that isn't it you know I used to smoke I'm going to quit smoking that still isn't it until God receives that sacrifice on his past altar what is his J judgement death that's the penalty I want to go into something here right now that kind of blow my mind when I see it sin is actually the absence of presence the presence of God you cannot sin in the presence of God and that is why the devil's JW is to upset and shake and try to overthrow and Rock Believers and the church come out of the presence of God and here where this draw from but Psalm 168 David said I have set the Lord before me that's a good thing to do I have set the lord always before my Fe now David have set the Lord before my Fe and here what he said here now always be conscience of God's presence presence wouldn't that be a good lesson for all of us tonight set the Lord before our face so be conscious of his presence put him first put him first why then you won't sin when you are realizing that constantly you are in the presence of God so the presence of God is a sin killer the presence of God is a sin a protection against sin so in other words in God's presence you can't be sitting at the bar you can't be smoking a cigarette you can't be car a bunch of foolish be curing and in the Pres of God that just going to happen listen to what the prophet says when you realize God is around you will watch what you see a man when he think God is gone he will cuss he would lust after woman he will steal cheat lie he will do anything when he thinks that God don't see him but bring him into the presence of God he will stop it right now God help me God help us God help our church then people need to really come up into God's presence because they think and brother U has emphasized it so many times they separate work from God they separate Church from God from and their daily Liv of God so you go to church is a ritual you come home you do you do you go when you go act when to act but when you blend it all together is not really so it's supposed to be all God it's supposed to be his presence that we in so brother said again I read it again when a man think God is gone he will cuss he would lust after woman he will steal he will cheat he would lie will do anything that when he thinks that God don't see him but bring him into the presence of God he will stop it right then David said I have put the Lord before me that's a good thing no wonder God has said he was a man of his own heart man will do everything when he thinks that God isn't near but when he realizes that God is near did you ever notice a sinner let a Godly person walk up he's quit his cussing if he have got any respects at all he wouldn't tell any dirty jokes why because that Christian standing there represents the altar now this altar as I close I want to present you tonight is not a church altar it's not a headstone Tabernacle altar it's a personal altar is Right Where You Are Tonight right in your homes tonight you building a personal altar a place to have access and to be brought into Fellowship of God and I have written here this relationship is to go beyond petitioning is to go be Beyond asking asking God for a raise asking for car asking for this asking asking asking God is a a big Giver like a Santa Claus man this relationship is to go beyond petitioning or Beyond asking God for things into the realm where you just want to be in the company of his presence Lord I want to be in your presence I just want to worship you I just want to be in your presence I close and this is scripture we read I Bes you Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service what house will you build me what altar will you build me we need to build a personal Altar and you hear about Isa speak about it a king Kingdom of priests offering sacrifices to God and this one blow my mind Genesis 8 this is last scripture Genesis 8: 20-22 says and Noah building an altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar now he this part verse 21 and the Lord smelled a sweet sa and the Lord said in his heart you know this here describing God it describ him as a person here I find this was so amazing the Lord smelled the sweet SAA and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the gr anymore for man's sake for the imagination of man heart is evil from his youth neither will I again Smite anymore everything living as I have done while the Earth remain it sea time Harvest and cold and heat summer and winter and day and night shall not cease why what made God say that in his heart a offering that Noah made at the altar we about to close off here tonight to let you go and pray I want you to see you have a personal alar and I want to see you to see that your prayer tonight going up to God and he could smell it he could have a heart for what your desire really is to love him and to serve him and he could intervene tonight on your behalf regardless of your condition regardless of your situation you have an opportunity not to go through guards and go to appointment books and go through all kind of Investigation before you see this big person that's how man have it to see the prime minister to see a mayor to see somebody you have to go to a set of drama and secretary and whatnot God kill all of that and through the blood of Jesus Christ we have access if the devil apply for this tonight he will get a word access denied not you God given you the key God giv you the password that you could have direct access to his presence in his presence there's no frustration in his presence there's no depression in his presence there is no I don't know and I going to no it don't have that it have peace it have joy it have Assurance it have long suffering I am delighted by this what I'm seeing because I realize that as we grow in God as we get more mature we realize God have a heart God have a mind God have desires God have expectation and God cannot change his word so even though he wants to bless if the person have to repent they have to repent in order to activate His blessings he cannot go around his own word God cannot go around his own word he want to bless you tonight or he have to bless you according to his will let's bow our heads heavenly father I ask for Anthony to sing that song tonight is your all on the altar of sacrifice lead oh God take our hearts tonight as we lead upon your brass altar you know every need here and I was sharing with brother Kangley I believe about how I of time hear Brother brand talk about God know when every fly bats his eye and that was just like a statement but for me now is not just a statement it's an understanding that God knows every thought every heart every desire every sin every failure every shortcoming he knows God when that t and lightning came down on the mountain the people didn't stay where they were they went backwards they went AAR they stood a far off and the people cried out let Moses speak don't let God speak it's a Dreadful thing to fall into the hands of almighty God lord I know that someday this that we speak about will become a living reality in the homes and lives of your children they will understand that the god of Moses the god of Isaac the god of Jacob the god of the Old Testament is still alive confirming and vindicating this word oh God help those children here tonight help us as your sons and daughters tonight heal our wounds heal our hearts forgive our past and bless our future anoint us and prepare our hearts for what lays ahead we don't want to be foolish we want to be wise we don't want to be in ignorance we want to be in knowledge we want to understand that you promise to have a kingdom of priests Lord May begin tonight where each person here would see themselves as offering their sacrifices as bringing their offering to God their hearts their minds their lives their homes their marriages everything around and about them that they could lay at your feet oh God what are we living for what are we fighting for we fight to live and we live to die Jesus may you come and consume us tonight send down the SS Lord may we have testimonies of individuals being purged and cleansed and being baptized with the Holy Ghost on Fire heal the sick in our midst touch Lord every sick person Lord reach out to brother VJ in a special way tonight visit him with your presence and strength touch him from the crown of his head to the soul of his feet touched by the terance tonight when the crown of his head to S his feet every hard case every challenging case in our midst God you visit them and may your virtue flow freely among the people strengthen them and bless them as they get on in prayer tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you I was certainly excited about bringing this word to you tonight that you would see that this God is real he told Moses what to share tell them because he wanted them to follow through with his word so God bless you as we get on in prayer tonight God be with you praise the Lord
