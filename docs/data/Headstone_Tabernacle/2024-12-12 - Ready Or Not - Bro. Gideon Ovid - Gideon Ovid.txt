praising and worship in his name Blessed Be His holy name thank you Jesus amen blessed be the name of the Lord thank you brother Anthony musicians what singing what worship you know it was the blood for me where would we be without his blood without his love without his grace without his Mercy amen amen thank you Lord amen if we could just turn your Bibles with me reading a few verses of a scripture in the Book of Matthew chapter 24 just three verses there Matthew chapter 24 reading vers 42- 44 amen everybody feeling all right amen and it says watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as he think not the son of man cometh may we just bow our heads as we open in a word of prayer oh Heavenly Father Lord we deem it such a privilege to be gathered together in this way tonight Lord Lord we thank you for your presence Lord we thank you for your power Lord we thank you for your love Lord I pray that you would take me out of the way tonight Lord that you would merge together stitch together put together all that is said Lord Lord all the words all the broken up thoughts and ideas I pray that you would make it seamless so it could touch your hearts of your people Lord speak lip to air to them Lord I pray that lives be changed and transformed I pray that something be said that would be so changing Lord Lord that could be so impactful Lord that wherever there are those gathered together here live Lord those connected on the internet those that might be at home at work and different places right now Lord that your Holy Spirit would drop down and meet their needs Lord that you will heal the sick among us Lord that you will set free that you'll baptize Lord Lord Lord that you will cause a great Deliverance tonight Lord Lord we pray that we give you all the praise honor and glory Lord that nothing will be said that you don't want said Lord Lord I pray that everything will be in order and we want to praise you and worship you and create such an atmosphere that the Holy Spirit could drop down Lord Lord you sent us a message of preparation Lord you sent us a message of perfection in this hour Lord and that's all we seek Lord to be drawn Closer to You Lord Lord to live the kind of lives that you could be pleased with Lord Lord to live the kind of lives that you could say there is my spirit flowing freely Lord Lord I pray tonight that we be blessed and be a blessing tonight in Jesus name amen amen you may have your seats blessed be the name of the Lord amen I always say I don't get accustomed to this but sometimes I just have to do what I have to do amen and we didn't come here in vain we didn't come here just to talk just to have a good chat came to to water the word with your Praises Lord to to water with your worship Lord to delve deeper into the scriptures to delve deeper into the word so we could be closer to Jesus closer to Christ closer to the the image he wants of us amen for a title the title tonight is ready or not that's it ready or not ready or not it sounds like a game they play in primary school but but it's so profound that it doesn't matter what's going on around you sometimes ready or not that's the point in time in which something is going to break something is going to change something is going to strike it doesn't have time to cater for you and and your thoughts and ideas and and where you think you should be and where your maturity is at sometimes it doesn't matter ready or not when that countdown reaches zero it doesn't matter he who is filthy is filthy still he who is righteous is righteous still it doesn't matter if it's Christmas time or Easter it doesn't matter if it's the old year or the New Year ready or not he's coming ready or not he has a test for you ready or not he has an exam a requirement that he's coming for amen hallelujah for an inspiration will you be ready that's the call tonight will you be ready he give us instructions he give us guidelines he set out things that he would like from us things that he want us to do things that he require of us and the question is will you be ready tonight will you be ready if he comes to mark your papers right now would you get the A+ would you be able to progress would you be able to pass the test amen so in that scripture we read it says watch therefore so at the beginning there was an instruction so there's no room for laziness when we say ready or not even in the context of the game sometimes you run and you hide you have to do something so in this scripture it says watch therefore so you don't just lie down and sit down and and hope for the best and and hope the cameras pick up what's going on no no no there's something required of you there's something you have to do because you don't know the day or the hour you don't know when the thief is coming you don't know when the opposition is going to attack you so you have to always be prepared like the cop Scout Moto always be ready because it doesn't matter when the opposition strikes what you're sure of the opposition is going to strike yes so as we say in times of peace prepare for war in times of calm you prepare for danger and difficulty because it's certainly going to come amen I have you the Journey of Life as we travel through life life is a journey it's lightened unto a journey so you have a start a middle part and an end in True Life some of the journeys are days some are months you know you don't don't even know where life will lead you you start at one point and sometimes you end your trajectory is so so diverse so different to your neighbor so different to those around you you may start in one part in this context you may start in one part of the island and you end is at a different part or you start in one country and you end is a different part or we all start at Birth but we don't know when the end is that's right you didn't choose your family that's right you didn't Cho chose your environment you certainly didn't choose your trials and your tests and your ups and downs but God chose you he chose you he chose to love you he chose to raise you he chose to keep you you're here because of his love you're here because of his grace and his mercy and and and his provision for you and his will in your life your destiny is assigned by him your purpose is assigned by him as they say he is the manufacturer so he knows why you're here sometimes you might be misguided sometimes you might be distracted but along the journey you have to realize and acknowledge without him you're nothing without him there's nothing you can do in your own accord there's nothing you could do by yourself there's a song that says without him I'll be nothing without him I'll surely fail amen he chose to call you he he chose to love you he train you he raised you up and he purchased You by his blood now listen God was willing to pay a price for you because you were invaluable he couldn't run the risk of losing you he couldn't run the risk of somebody else getting control of you so he was willing to pay the ultimate price to get you in this life if if you see value in something you're willing to go through great sacrifice you're willing to work to get it you're willing to wait you you're willing to be patient and and store up whether it's money whether it's time whatever the medium of exchange you're willing to do it because it's valuable to you so he was willing to take his only son and shed his blood to redeem you to raise you up to bring you back he give you life he give you purpose hope and Destiny he showed you Grace and Merc Mercy day after day after day without you requesting it without you earning it to some like I said he give days to some that Journey was just weeks to some it was years some persons we enjoy just just a little while and and they called off the scene some person they they they live a little while and they do a thing or two and and we remember them a little bit and the number is called but you're still here you you still here tonight to praise and worship and to beat the devil anytime anywhere under any condition God must have a a special plan for you we could call you Special Forces because there are those who dropped off in the 80s and 90s there are those who white Tok wipe them out but you still here despite the ups and downs despite the rocking of the boat despite how you may be tossed and turned you're still here is something that keep holding on to you that have you here in 2024 now we're on the cusp of 2025 and you're still holding on to faith you're still believing you're still waiting for your children you're still holding on for your loved ones it doesn't matter what time of the year it is you know for many they celebrate Christmas and they decorate and and they they clean up and they they they do some nice things they they prepare food and stuff but you know at the end of the day doing all you do in the natural has no real effect or impact on the spiritual requirement of God no matter what you do don't get me wrong I'm not saying don't clean I'm not saying don't cook I'm not saying don't decorate or do whatever you want for Christmas but I'm saying at the end of the thing we have to make the main thing the main thing at the end of the day it doesn't matter if if it's Christmas or if it's New Year's or whatever holiday it might be at the end of the day you still have to ensure that if Jesus were to come and Mark your papers tonight that you get a passing grade that you get a passing grade you can never be too busy for his requirements there is no excuse good enough for not making his Mark he has a pass Mark and I want you to know that your pass mark Mark is different than mine that's right it's different than your neighbor so something we have to do is stop comparing to the people around you and I'll show you true scripture why you should stop doing that it will get you in a lot of problems because you look at your brother and your sister and you see them doing something and you believe you know what I could do that better you know I should do that too but God said listen here what I have chose you chosen you because you different than your brother you're different than your sister your mother and your father couldn't see what I have ordained for you because I call you and selected you before the foundation of the earth I didn't call the ones around you I call you don't look around it's you it's you are speaking to so I know you might be listening to this right now but it's you he is speaking to tonight because he called you for a special operation in the military there are special ops and that's why he called you in the last day because you have special training Abraham may not have passed the test that he has ordained for you your brother may not have passed the test that he's ordained for you amen now in a message of seal of God I'm not trying to scare you but in reality this might be a last service you know this might be a last message I know it was the blood might be the last song you ever sung and that's reality that's the reality in which we liveing in a message the Seal of God paragraph 293 the prophet said one of these days the last Holy Ghost anointed gospel sermon will be preached he didn't say it might be preached he said it will be preached it will be the last one he say one of these days the last gun will fire one of these days the last song will sung one of these days the last prayer would be prayed one of these days the doors of the Tabernacle would be closed Clos for the last time the Bible will be closed on the pulpit and you'll stand in the presence of God to give an account for what you've heard tonight not just Last Week Tonight the words you're hearing tonight you have to give an account for because you're hearing it now wherever you are under the sound of my voice you're hearing it now that the last word will be spoken at some point and you'll stand in the presence of God to give an account for what you heard tonight what then what then would it matter how much money you earned this year come on would it matter if you bought a new car come on would it matter what you plan to do for Christmas what then when the Great book is opened what then when tonight comes on record what then when the Great book is opened when the ones that rejected the Savior today will be asked to give a reason to give an excuse to give an answer for what's going on what then your job stood any way because you had things to do because you was busy what what excuse you think will be good enough your girlfriend stood anyway the church stood anyway the Deacon or the Usher when the Great book is open what then when the ones that reject the message tonight you're going to be asked to give a reason what then what are you going to do about it you know what the mark of the beast is you know what the Seal of God is it's up to you and that's the beauty of God he he he's not forcing you tonight you know let's call it information he's presenting the information to you he's presenting it to you he's saying listen this is what I want of you I'm coming with a test I'm coming with an exam so in class class and I just going to shift a little bit in the classroom they often do do do this all the time and teachers in the house could confirm they will say 1+ 1 is two 2+ 2 is four 3 plus three is six and then for the exam they come 1 plus two that's how it comes usually so it might be a little little different it might look a little different to what you did in class but the teacher hopes that you would have grasped the concept that you understood that the seed was planted so when you walk out you're not just regurgitating you're not just just just rattling it out no but you have a proper understanding that that it could live in you so you could walk and say silver and gold I don't have but such as I have I give Thee I could release to you because I understand the power that is within me amen so that's the way test usually would operate so you learn the principles and then you're you're required to apply it so in most exams as well you have a start time and a pred a predetermined time to finish many times there are students who find themselves writing or the as we say they working down to the wire they going they're going they're going until they hear 's up but you know what's interesting about that not nothing is wrong with writing down to the wire the teeth on the cross was down to the wire Jesus on the cross was right there about to give up The Ghost and he said Lord remember me remember me I right here with you I didn't walk with you or talk with you I might have stolen from you but remember me down to the wire but here's the thing about exams though it doesn't matter too much if you was a a student if you was the teacher's pet if the teacher liked you if you were the class clown or you just love the subject you know some folks they love math or they love chemistry or they love physics they just love that but when the exam come it may not like them that's just reality of exams but they love it they're passionate about that they could talk about it but under exam conditions they fail remember the exam have a start time and a time to finish so while you doing all your tests and exams and you believe you ass simulate all the information and you're coming and you're writing and you're finding new Solutions at some point they will tell you time's up and at that point it didn't matter how your term went or how your year went or how your five year or how the period it didn't matter and we'll come to it in a little while if you was coming to church consistently on time time will be up and at that point even if you would have read the books so you take the exam book and you do all nighters you drink coffee cover to cover you know everything you could walk and just start to recite you could recite the book from the front to the back at that point it doesn't matter what you could recite because time's up and the only thing that matters is what you wrote on the paper I remember my wife recently she was invigilating an exam and she say you know there was a young man came into the exam he came late looking flustered came in when he got the paper he started man and after about 10 minutes his head went down and when his head came back up the exam was finished he was totally stumped worn out studied out whatever you call it he slept through the entire thing the only thing that they could judge at that point is what he wrote on the paper it didn't matter if he was the top student if he was a a student what they're marking is what's on the paper because that's the requirement the requirement is you have to write what is required and that's the result of your exam so given that context if you read book cover to cover when the invigilator says time's up nothing you learn matter you know some folks that say what I learned did not come it doesn't matter what matters is what you write on the paper just like that Jesus he healed the sick he raised the dead he caused the blind to see and stuff he opened the word and the understanding and he walked with disciples and he showed them mer very very many miracles he gave them Parables he taught them he walked with them for three and a half years amen but all of that culminated at the Garden of Gethsemane at the Garden on his knees he faced the ultimate test he said Lord listen if it's possible let this cup pass let me not participate in this partner I I I I get I mean people talk bad about me they say all kind of thing they they they accuse me wrongfully but let me not do this part now but you know at the end of the time when is time to Mark the exam you know what he said not my will but thy will so like man he stand up and he say listen I going through I passing the test I taking it for what it's worth I taking your word and are going to execute not my will but your will God's will so it is with us you know God dropped us in time or like I say God dropped time on us he dropped time on us and and say listen there's a time to born a time to die a time for this and time for that a time to marry a time to eat a I mean he really allocate time for everything amen and there Comes A Time in your life in this journey called life when it doesn't matter what you heard it doesn't matter what you read you know it doesn't matter too much what you say at some point he'll declare time no longer and when he does what matters is if you're ready you're ready to meet him that's the question at that point will you be ready at that point will you be ready when he call your number will you be be ready for him to mark your papers have you done what is needed to pass his test do we have the faith that he coming to look for do we believe the things he tell us he want us believe he tell us trust him love him serve him he tell us he coming to look for Faith knowledge Temperance patience godliness broadly kindness he want charity to be able to drop down you you have that that is his requirement that is what he looking for that's his test that is what he testing so when he look could could he find Faith could he find virtue if you don't have that if you can't live that if your carh show that you're falling short it don't matter how much hands you're shaking it don't matter if the pastor love you if you just come early and everybody love you you know you is a man of the people as they say it don't matter how charismatic you are what requ what what what matters is that you fulfill his requirements at some point you will be called to account called to give an account and it's so interesting that I often say the Bible gives the examples for everything everything we need is in the Bible and you say at some point you will be called to give an account he say you'll be called to give an answer too but I want to delve a little deeper into that given an account and use a scripture that's familiar to us you don't have to find it but in Matthew 25:14 this is the scripture with the parable of the talents it's something we're familiar with something we've read many many times s we know it 5 10 to five two two one bury it but I want to read it because I think there are some things in it that we need to explore and consider in verse 14 of Matthew 25 it says for the Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country and I want you to take a note there you see if somebody is traveling to a far country you as his servant don't know when he coming back he not traveling by the neighbor he not going next door he traveling far he going far so you don't know how long he will take to return amen so he called his own servants not servants from down the street you know his own servants the people he know love and trust and he entrust unto them and the Bible says he delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents and to another two and to another one to every man according to his several abilities so earlier on when I said don't compare to your neighbor because you have a different ability than your neighbor if everybody had the same ability you know what he would have done he would have given everybody five or everybody two or everybody one but he knew knew everybody had a different skill set different ability different listen everybody was not the same that's right because he knew that he customized your test for you you know you not qualified for my test you know and I'm not qualified for yours you know so it's easy to look and say but you I see how God blessing him you see how God prosper in his way and you don't know listen this job you looking at you job was blessed job was prosperous but you don't know in a little while the devil going to go to and through and God go and say have you considered my servant job all the time you watch it you want to exchange roles with job you want to do that listen I I think if job had the opportunity to swap he might have swap you know because his test wasn't right here you know I could tell you I don't want his test you know job lost everything you know right the Rich Young Ruler was told to sell all he had job didn't have to sell all he hav job lost it you know don't his children the cattle the flocks the I mean everything so I come back to the the the thing that everybody had a different ability so because they had a different ability he give them different talents and I will use the scripture again to show you and reemphasize that fact that is more about you being ready than the amount it's more about you being prepared than watching your neighbor it's more about you being faithful to God's word than seeing what other people doing so it went on and we say to he that receiv received five talents he went and traded the same in verse 16 and he made them other five talents and likewise he that received two he also gained other two but he that had received one went and died the Earth and hid his Lord's money and listen in verse 19 and I think verse 19 just like 14 is so significant he said after a long time it sound like it wasn't a day it wasn't a month it was a time that they didn't identify here in the scripture he said after a long time the lord of the servants the same Lord cometh and reckon with them and and Converse with them and dialogue with them and so he that had five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou deliver unto me five Talons behold I gained beside them five talents more amen his lord said unto him listen to the words well done thou good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things now he had most to know and God said thou has been Faithful over a few things and I will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord and listen he also that had received two talents came and said Lord thou deliver unto me two talents behold I have gained two other talents beside them so same thing he multiply it his Lord in verse 23 said unto him listen well done good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord what what we observe it didn't matter that one had five and one had two the Master's comments the master dialogue the conversation they had the conclusion was the same they had been faithful according to their measure listen he saw them as equal if they looked at each other you might just say but that's the great one he give he give him five God find favor with him the Lord bless him more the Lord give him more but no the Lord said listen you and you although you had five and you had two you have been faithful in a few things so I want to make you ruler over many things so it doesn't matter your ability is different to your neighbor and your brother and your cousin and your uncle so you still have to focus on you being ready is an individual Affair it went on and he said and we know it he that had received the one Talent came and said Lord I knew thee that thou art a hard man well he starred bad because he knew he was a hard man now if you know is a hard man how you will behave the way this one behave but I think it's a good example we know the God we serve is not is not a normal being you know the God I serve is a terrible God you know he's a jealous God you know he's a god of mercy and love and he's kind and gracious and you know he really likes to take care of his children but listen when he declare war and destruction and judgment nothing will stand in his way you know he's no respect to persons you he don't care how long you're in the message and who your father is and the fact that you used to come on a Wednesday night he not concerned about that you know his word is his word his requirement his requirement in Egypt when he say put the blood on the door post what then what excuse you have for not doing it you and Moses you grew up together Moses your partner your uncle knew Moses and all you listen you all used to travel together and you say Maxi no it didn't matter what then all he want to see is the blood that was it will you be ready that's it ready or not that angel was coming he wasn't going and pause and say listen oh you went down listen you had some business to to to do you just wanted to wrap up some things before no the time had come ready or not that angel was about to strike you had to be inside with your doors locked with blood on your door poost if you didn't have that you didn't have on your paper the answer that was required to your failure exam that was your portion that was it in verse 25 of the same scripture he said I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth Lo where thou Hast thine is thine so I have exactly what you give me time pass with time value of money and inflation listen that was even worth less than the the master give him that's time pass with inflation what the master could do with that that was a loss listen God not in the Lost business you know God said listen not one shall be lost you know he want everything you know he don't want to give up a hoof you know when the children of Israel was about to leave he said listen take everything you know don't leave anything behind you know he don't want to leave a back know he want everything there's a scripture I want to read in a little bit but in the end of this one if I went down you know just paraphrasing cuz time is fast spent and running he said listen he cast in verse 30 cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth and he took took the one and G give it to the one that had 10 at the end of the day when God give you a purpose when God give you a challenge when God give you a test when God give you a responsibility you have to be able to account to him what you did with that you know you have to be able to give a proper account of what you did as man of the house and guiding your household you know you have to be able to give an account as the kind of leader you were with your children you know the kind of example you were you know you as an individual have to give an an account of that and it's interesting in Hebrews I don't want to read the whole thing but we often refer to them as The Heroes of Faith you know we know Abraham waited for 25 years right and as we went through in Hebrews 11 from verse 17 to 23 I'm not going to read the whole thing you know he talk about by faith Abraham it went on it say by faith Isaac by faith Jacob Joseph Moses and it goes on you ever take note that he didn't say by big Faith Abraham by average Faith Joseph by Alessa faith we look at Moses kind of had Faith but you know he had a little anger challenge he smoked the rock no when they made account of these guys they say listen in verse 17 by faith Abraham in verse 20 by faith Isaac 21 by faith Jacob 22 by faith Joseph 23 by faith Moses it made no distinction of the level of faith and the quality of faith and the the time it took to really test that faith and Joseph kind of waited kind of long not as long as but kind of so we will give him a a B+ and Abraham will get a because he no they all had their own trials their own challenges they operated in their own context their own circumstances and they had to be ready and give an account of their faith given their circumstances amen you see many times when called to account we find ourselves comparing to others right we didn't get the same test but we concerned about others we don't have the same ability but we're looking at other people we don't have the same weaknesses or strengths the same skills Etc God call you as an individual just like he called Abraham and said Abraham listen I want you come Gideon you come the littlest that's okay I want you I don't want your brother listen when he called David he say you you mining sheep I want you when Jesus wanted to choose disciples he didn't say listen let me go to this church you see the whole front through follow me everybody everybody come no he say listen Peter Matthew James John Andrew he called individuals you are so unique they say with the billions in the world you alone have that fingerprint imagine that because God chose you as an individual which as specialist Mission because he knew in the end time he needed Specialists it it's not it's not the masses he looking for he looking for people who could surrender to him that could throw away their will and adopt his own and be led by him so he could lead their path he could guide them because those are people he could use he he he you don't want he halfway thing he want you fully he surrendered to him the same the prophet say listen a preacher could be halfway but God go on that I know time is far spent but listen when God ready for you you could run you know he could allow you to run but you can't hide you see Jonah thought at some point he could run he thought he was real bright he was you say bolt boat Edition he could move real fast so in Jonah in the Book of Jonah he said in verse one now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amatti saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and I wouldn't read the whole thing and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me so guess what he didn't call Moses he didn't call David he called Jonah Jonah hear what that place is so wicked the wickedness come up to me I want you to go and deal with that you are the man for the job in verse three but Jonah rose up to flee unto tashes from the presence of the Lord and went down to joper and he found a ship going to tashes so he paid the fear thereof and he went down into it to go with them unto tashes from the presence of the Lord Joseph was running he was on the Run he was on the Move listen Joseph wasn't a sorry Jonah sorry he wasn't a prisoner no he didn't have a ankle bracelet that that GPS could monitor him as he go you know know he thought he gone God wants him go east he going west God wants him go up he going down he going far far far far far because in his mind he running he running he running not knowing that God always a few steps ahead that's right because listen when God call you he know all the mistakes you're going to make that's he know all your failures are in advance that's why he he put the test the way he structured the test that's right you don't take a six-year-old and give them University test that's right you give them test at their level because you know you might get a B+ here know but you will learn from that and you'll be matured enough to understand so by the time you reach your big test you're qualified for that amen so Jonah and we know this story he tried to run and he jump off he jump out into the water he say listen it's me is me is me right in verse 15 they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the Sea ceased from her raging because God said listen time up ready for you you run long enough you play yourself you had a good time you ly you believe you're in secret you believe you doing you do but I ready for now so I will shake up things around you I will turn your wife against you I will turn the church against you because it's you I want I call you and I have a job for you so you could only run so much you can't hide from me I seeing you still so he said listen the man feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows now the Lord had prepared because at this point overboard gone give up the ghost you know he believe that is the only answer throw me out now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights can you imagine that three days and three nights and remember brother BR give a St Story one time about a man and he said the man took a ball I believe and he stuck it in the mouth of of a fish and the fish almost choked you say you see look the fish almost died how Jonah could fit in a fish if a fish can even swallow a ball a hand could barely go in a fish mouth brother brand he heard that he said listen you didn't read you didn't read the Bible he said if you read the Bible and they went back and for he said if you read it correctly you would see that it was a prepared fish amen it wasn't the fish you you fish in the pond next door it wasn't the little bait you throw out and you find well I catch a a big bass or something real big super wasn't that no this was a special remember I told you God always a few steps ahead you God knew that when all was against the rops and his back was against the wall he knew Jonah was ending in the water you know so all he run Jonah ran and he thought he was real bright and he was fast God had a prepared fish for him and in a message scriptural sign of of the times verse uh paragraph 86 sorry he says now I've heard people say I was prayed for last night and my hand is no better I'm still crippled I still have a stomach ache my eyes I don't see good yet oh my then holl Jonah if anybody had a case of symptoms he ought to have it if he looked this way was whale belly that way was whale belly everywhere he looked was whale's belly his hands was tied behind him remember he was thrown overboard he was in a whales belly at the bottom of the sea probably 40 fathoms deep in the bottom of the sea now talk about symptoms then you call him backslid but you know what he said they are lying vanities I won't even look at them but once more I would look to the Holy Temple Lord paragraph 89 now Jonah knew when Solomon dedicated the temple he prayed and said Lord If thy people be in trouble anywhere and look unto this holy place they hear from heaven and he had that much confidence in the prayer of a man that backslid so imagine God listening to Jonah that made a prayer how much more there is none of us in that condition tonight there is none of of us with that kind of symptoms and then we look at our symptoms why why if he could have that much confidence in the prayer of a man that backslid when we asked to look to heaven where Jesus sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high in a temple not made with hands he is expected in there to intercede upon your confession how much more should we ignore our symptoms so you mean it don't matter how it look tonight it don't matter how you feel tonight you already healed you're already delivered you're already set free by your confession once more I look to thy holy promise Lord oh my when we see God on the scene now we find out that Jonah they said this whale carried him in there for three days and nights and took him all the way back down backtrack the course so he thought he was going well you going back amen wherever he thought he was going he was going back they said backtrack the course went over and now the people of Nineveh had become like they are in the rest of the world now their great commercial World their industry was fishing and all the man fished all the men fished and they worshiped idols and the whale was the sea god and one day about 11:00 while they were all out there fishing here come their sea in and licked out his tongue and the prophet walked off the Gangplank no wonder they repented uh-huh see there was a sign that was a sign so you tell me you think God didn't know they they worship idols you think God didn't know they had a sea god so God didn't prepare this F this probably was the biggest fish they had seen in their mind this is the greatest Idol they had ever seen this might have been the greatest life manifestation in front their eyes that they had witnessed and a prophet walking out and tell them repent they had no choice their time was up listen they had to be ready at this point and Jonah had to be ready after the running three days three nights in whale belly if you're not ready something wrong three days and three nights and you're not ready yet oh my blessed be his name I'm almost finished but endure a little bit more a little longer a little longer we often read the scripture of Elijah and we look at Elijah when they're calling for rain and the prophets of Baal would come and they would do their their thing they do their thing and they fail and we would look at the fact that he said rebuild the Altar and and pour water pour water again and fire would come down now in First Kings 18 after that scenario there is something I believe significant that takes place first Kings 18:36 and it says it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and I am thy servant that I have done all these things at Thy word this is when he set everything in motion he said hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and thou has turned their heart back again and then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god and listen to this part this is an instruction in verse 40 and Elijah said unto them listen take the prophets of Baal yes let not one of them Escape so you see these false prophets that was parading the self he said take all of them don't let any of recant and repent and turn back now because they had their time to shine they had their time to be on display he said let not one of them escape and took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook of Kishon and and slew them there all of them and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there's the sound of the abundance of rain so Ahab went up to eat and drink and Elijah went up to the top of caramel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees and he said to his servant go up now look towards the sea and he went up and looked and of course the servant said there is nothing he said go against seven times and in verse 44 it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up say unto Ahab same Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not and it came to pass remember there was no rain and in verse 45 it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was great rain and Ahab rot and went to jezel and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he GED up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of jezrael so in this scripture here it showed listen when it was time when it came time for rain to come after the slaughter of the false prophets nothing could stop this raining this rain was coming in abundance nothing could stop it the prophet had spoken already and the fire had fallen and the rain was coming he said go and warn them go in front because the rain will stop it's so much rain will stop you if you don't move now now it reminds me there's a scripture in Kings in Second Kings now this one was in first Kings Hallelujah in Second Kings and I'll paraphrase because I I say time is far spent there was three kings going into battle in Second Kings three from verse 9 and I will just just kind of skim down a little bit the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of of e Edom three of them and they fetch a compass of seven days journey so they planned their Trail and there was no water for the host for the cattle that followed them and I skipped down a little bit and they said listen find a prophet find a prophet in the land it's say in verse 11 is there not a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him and one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said here is Elisha the son of shaffat which poured water on the hands of Elijah so this is the linkage now so Elijah we saw is the one after the slaughter had the cloud like a man's hand and rain fell sorry and the water came down yes and Elisha being we could we could call call call this one he is the um he is the almost like the mentee he follow after he come as the young back on scene right and after this scenario he said call elishah because he we know he have a connection to Elijah and Elijah was a powerful man of God and when they call Elisha to their disappointment he said says what have I to do with thee you all want to wage war do have water how is that my problem how is that my isue what that have to do with me he tell them go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother the king of Israel said unto him nay for the Lord had called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab and elishah said as the Lord of hosts liveth before whom I stand surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I would not even look toward you I wouldn't even see you we wouldn't even be having the conversation now he said but you know what bring a ministrel play some music and they say and it came to pass when the Minal played the hand of the Lord came upon him and he said thus said the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus said the Lord ye shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast and this is but a light thing he said listen there's not a great or grand thing you know he said this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will also deliver the moabites into your hand and you shall Smite every fence City every choice City and shall fell every good tree and stop all Wells of water and Mark every every good piece of land with stones and in verse 20 and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came Water by the way of Edom and the country was filled with water so once again we see listen when the prophet speaks when thus said the Lord go forth when the Lord hand come upon him it doesn't matter what going on around here it doesn't matter if it's war time if it's battle listen just ask what your will you know because it going to happen ready or not it happening will you be ready for the outpouring that he's about to pour out would you be ready when he come to mark your papers would you be ready the musicians could get ready at this time just one more quote and and we're out in a message the flashing red light of the sign of his coming paragraph 177 he says are you still a church member have you done wrong look and search your life over tonight men women look at yourself look at your own faults what is your present State now if Christ was on Earth preaching this you say if he would have if I had heard him preach that I would have repented it's easy to say that if you would this is his own word tonight we not making this up you know this this is the word of God say you got to do it now if you're without God and you know you say I belong to a church I spoke in tongues I had an experience with the Lord lay that aside look at yourself you remember it doesn't matter what happened last year you know it doesn't matter what happened 10 years ago you
