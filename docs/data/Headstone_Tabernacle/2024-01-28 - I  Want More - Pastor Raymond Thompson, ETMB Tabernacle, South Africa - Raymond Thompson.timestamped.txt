[44:07] I one want to trade this for nothing in
[44:08] the world nothing in the
[44:12] world okay so I just want to read a
[44:15] scripture you don't have to stand this
[44:17] from Deuteronomy chapter 18 this is the
[44:20] prophecy concerning Jesus I will raise
[44:23] them up a prophet among their brethren
[44:26] like unto
[44:27] me and will put my words in his mouth
[44:30] and he shall speak unto them all that I
[44:33] shall command him and it shall come to
[44:36] pass that whosoever will not harken unto
[44:37] my words but he shall speak in my name
[44:40] I'll require it of him but the prophet
[44:44] which shall presume to speak in my name
[44:47] which I have not commanded him to speak
[44:50] Lord or that shall speak in the name of
[44:52] other gods Lord even that Prophet shall
[44:54] die and if thou see in thine heart how
[44:58] shall we know the word which the Lord
[45:00] hath not spoken ha not spoken come on
[45:03] now when a prophet speaketh in the name
[45:05] of the Lord if the thing follow not nor
[45:08] come to pass that is the thing which the
[45:11] Lord had not spoken but the prophet had
[45:14] spoken presumptuously Thou shalt not be
[45:17] afraid of him God has a Vindicated
[45:20] Prophet that God sent in his last day
[45:23] his name is William Mari and BR
[45:26] Vindicated Prophet that the word out of
[45:28] his mouth came to pass that means God
[45:31] sent him and the words out of his mouth
[45:33] is Spirit given or Spirit spoken word
[45:36] which is the Original Seed when the fire
[45:39] came on the Mountain of God the people
[45:41] told God don't let don't get tell Moses
[45:44] don't let God speak you speak and God
[45:46] said okay I'm come down I'm going to
[45:48] speak to the prophet and that's why the
[45:50] word command shall not vibrate alone but
[45:53] every word which proceeded out of the
[45:55] mouth of God and God put the prophets as
[45:58] his mouthpiece so if you want to hear
[46:00] from God you have to hear from a prophet
[46:03] and a prophet the God's mouthpiece and
[46:06] God said behold I send you Elijah the
[46:07] prophet when praise God before the
[46:10] terrible day of the Lord and he shall
[46:12] turn the hearts of the children back to
[46:14] the faith of the fathers so right now
[46:16] this morning you are sitting under a
[46:18] Vindicated message not a message to be
[46:21] Vindicated it's a Vindicated message by
[46:24] a Vindicated prophet he brought a
[46:25] Vindicated word to a bride who will be
[46:28] Vindicated oh give the Lord some
[46:31] Praises hallelujah praise God let's
[46:34] go now if God so loved the Jews and were
[46:38] his first chosen as a people he called
[46:41] the Jews out and they sowed and what
[46:44] they sow they had to reap what they
[46:45] sowed and were not expelled or were not
[46:49] immune from God's judgments all
[46:52] right when we disobey his commands
[46:55] that's right that goes for Nations or
[46:58] individuals or churches whatever it is
[47:03] do you understand that God is no respect
[47:05] to a persons he don't he's not respect
[47:08] to how long you're in the message he's
[47:09] not respecting how long you're in this
[47:10] Tabernacle he's not how long you're
[47:12] sitting on your Pew he doesn't who your
[47:14] husband is who your wife is who your
[47:16] father is whether if I is a pastor a
[47:18] Elder a deacon he doesn't study that he
[47:20] respects his word he told Adam the day
[47:22] you eat thereof that day you shall
[47:24] surely die that's the God we talking
[47:27] about that's the God we are serving you
[47:30] shall surely die keep my word and live
[47:33] keep my word and be blessed oh give the
[47:36] Lord some Praises this is God we talking
[47:38] about Hallelujah when we disobey God we
[47:42] receive judgments for it God is just and
[47:46] can't do nothing else one of his
[47:48] characteristics is just being just he
[47:51] sees the Justice he can't help it it's
[47:54] part of his nature you have to seek the
[47:56] interest of the widows you have to seek
[47:58] the interest of the poor you have to
[48:00] seek the of the struggling oh give the
[48:02] Lord a shout that's the God we serve he
[48:05] is just his judgments are righteous Oh
[48:08] Glory to God when God bring judgment is
[48:10] because they deserve it he said I take
[48:12] no pleasure in the debt of the wicked
[48:14] but I am trusting to come to repentance
[48:17] he trusting to come to Mercy he said go

[49:02] all right and the falling away of the
[49:05] Jews God permitted a heathen Nation to
[49:08] come over and carry away the
[49:11] chosen D into captivity because they had
[49:15] not served the Lord with a full heart
[49:18] very beautiful picture of the day we
[49:19] living in yet we have been chosen and a
[49:22] selected people a blessed people above
[49:24] all the rest of the world but when we
[49:26] forget God's Commandments and cause the
[49:28] great drinking and rting and divorce and
[49:30] adultery and things we are putting up
[49:32] and making it absolutely legal in this
[49:34] nation God has got Nations that can come
[49:37] and take it anytime he wants to he is
[49:39] saying to America God have Nations that
[49:42] can come and take them into captivity
[49:44] you heard that commentator the other day
[49:46] that just left Russia they said they had
[49:48] 10,000 jet bombers that could never stop
[49:50] to fuel and loaded in the hangers with
[49:53] atomic bombs that could fly over America
[49:55] return back without even fueling each
[49:57] plane carrying at least eight or 10
[49:59] Atomic hydrogen bombs that could put 150
[50:02] people to this nation in total
[50:05] annihilation in one hour time and we
[50:07] wait in sin corruption forsaking the
[50:10] Lord doing things contar will laughing
[50:13] making fun of those who are trying to do
[50:15] right what else could we expect but a
[50:17] repeat of the kind of way into Babylon
[50:20] just right remember America is already
[50:22] judged they're just waiting for
[50:24] sentencing now God will not repent on
[50:26] this judgment to America the vision is
[50:28] fixed the vision cannot change oh give
[50:31] the Lord some Praises when brother
[50:33] Brandon saw that Vision he saw America
[50:34] all over with smokes and crater and

[50:53] Prophet about 40 years old who was
[50:55] serving the Lord with all of his heart

[56:44] God have to
[56:45] [Music]
[56:51] say see over with other churches pastors
[56:53] who talk like that I know
[56:56] I
[56:57] know I
[57:00] know I know that I'm aware of
[57:03] that but God help me
[57:07] Jesus he said what because the nation
[57:09] had fell and he had to go into captivity
[57:11] with them but God was with him as an
[57:13] alien I love that though it be an alien
[57:16] god is still with you and God I'm almost
[57:19] God is always prepares his people for
[57:22] events just before it happened May I
[57:24] stop here minute and say I believe that
[57:26] the people are in preparation of the
[57:29] last great destruction this world will
[57:31] ever know I believe we are at the end
[57:34] you can speak to people you could put
[57:36] biligram in every city in United States
[57:37] they will drink whiskey smoke cigarettes
[57:39] laugh at you they are in the spirit of
[57:41] the last days now watch these words
[57:43] watch these last words now they are in
[57:45] the spirit of the last days and God
[57:47] cannot send destruction before the
[57:49] people are in the spirit of
[57:52] destruction Woo is a spirit thing then
[57:55] that's right that's why they have the
[57:56] gay agenda to bring on full blood full F
[58:00] Sodom and gomorra that's why the spirit
[58:02] of sodomy and the spirit of perversion
[58:05] sexual perversion is so
[58:09] preeminent because one of the cursed
[58:11] sins is adultery and
[58:14] fornication got that is sinning against
[58:16] your
[58:19] temple he said know you not you are the
[58:21] Temple of the Holy Ghost every sin is
[58:24] done without but that is with him so God
[58:27] sees it a certain
[58:29] way what you think God judging Rome for
[58:32] a fornications and
[58:35] adulteries all right let's go they are
[58:37] in the spirit of the last days and God
[58:40] cannot send destruction before the
[58:41] people are in the spirit of destruction
[58:44] God never did never destroyed anything
[58:46] man always destroy
[58:47] himself all right two more and we finish
[58:50] notice let's get back to Cain again
[58:53] let's get some faith in the beginning
[58:54] watch it now those Spirits as they begin
[58:56] to move it's the spirit of anything that
[59:00] does the work of it anyhow the people
[59:04] have to be in this kind of a spirit to
[59:06] bring the latter days the people in the
[59:09] spirit of the latter days the nations
[59:12] are in the spirit of the end time yes
[59:14] they got Atomic weapons and hydrogen all
[59:16] kind of things because it's the spirit
[59:17] of the day the people are in the spirit
[59:19] of the end time the church is moving
[59:21] together under the power and the impact
[59:24] of the Holy Spirit and the world is
[59:27] running out yonder making fun scuffing
[59:29] laughing and they are living like the
[59:31] devil every day it's the spirit of the
[59:34] thing so
[59:37] friends the foolish
[59:39] virgins they were good they were clean
[59:44] they were Sanctified they were not
[59:45] living contrary or or filthy but they
[59:49] wasn't have a burden for
[59:51] extra extra oil am is extra that you do
[59:56] the extra prayer the extra cry the extra
[59:58] sigh the extra burden you have to fight
[1:00:01] loudes
[1:00:04] here you have to fight the spirit of the
[1:00:06] age which is slothfulness laziness have
[1:00:08] need of nothing you have to actually
[1:00:09] fight that you
[1:00:11] know I'm going to leave here now I'm
[1:00:13] finished the
[1:00:14] quotes but bandam had a vision when he
[1:00:17] was young vision of Hell or S to hell
[1:00:19] and he saw when he came he saw woman
[1:00:22] with the mascara on and the makeup and
[1:00:23] so on when he came back years later
[1:00:26] years later he saw somebody with it and
[1:00:27] he couldn't believe it and then he said
[1:00:30] hell is on the earth yes so this mascara
[1:00:33] and all this makeup and all this thing
[1:00:34] that coming is not coming from Earthly
[1:00:38] you that coming from a spirit level that
[1:00:42] comes up from the earth and anoint
[1:00:44] people give them the wisdom long time
[1:00:46] the material they have for clut for wom
[1:00:48] didn't have that long time that kind of
[1:00:49] J like material that fit their form and
[1:00:51] shape somebody get inspired that's right
[1:00:54] understand and technology has become
[1:00:57] inspired and don't know maybe next week
[1:00:59] I preach but they have reached now where
[1:01:01] they reach with artificial intelligence
[1:01:03] that's right which is the final frontier
[1:01:06] of man this is man becoming like
[1:01:10] God because the total sum of all
[1:01:13] knowledge now is encapsulated in a
[1:01:16] m
[1:01:18] AI artificial intelligence and the bride
[1:01:22] will have the intelligence of Jesus
[1:01:25] Christ you have no other way to fight
[1:01:28] this thing but with the intelligence of
[1:01:30] God and the prophet prophec side The
[1:01:32] Pride will have the mind of Christ to
[1:01:34] know what to do with the word the mind
[1:01:36] of Christ is not pressing the tape and
[1:01:38] saying play the mind of Christ is to
[1:01:39] know exactly present tense Angels coming
[1:01:42] down to give Supernatural instructions
[1:01:44] and guidance Oh Glory to God every

[1:01:59] loved ones for your spirit for your
[1:02:01] heart for your mind for your soul you
[1:02:03] should come here knowing that this is
[1:02:05] the day for you to go free this is the
[1:02:07] day for the band of sin to be broken off
[1:02:09] for you you don't have to live in sin

[1:02:49] your human strength in your intellectual
[1:02:51] mind cannot find fight the demon powers

[1:03:09] being that devil Lucifer oh god oh glory

[1:03:15] perfect his
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:21] acts how about to wrap up nine into the
[1:03:25] tree but Bram saw a car like an
[1:03:28] egg that time had four big old truck big
[1:03:32] old
[1:03:35] engine this CES which is the we had the
[1:03:37] computer all display of all the latest
[1:03:39] technology is a company can't name of
[1:03:41] the company now has almost an exact
[1:03:44] thing the chairs in the vehicle face one
[1:03:47] another just said the profit saw it so
[1:03:50] they're not sitting down behind each
[1:03:51] other they're sitting facing each other
[1:03:52] because there's no need for steering
[1:03:53] there's no staring
[1:03:55] a app calls the vehicle you say where
[1:03:58] you want to go you step into it and it
[1:04:01] takes you there this is for the city now

[1:04:10] and it comes to you and you steping
[1:04:11] people and they using it already it is
[1:04:14] amazing it couldn't be it couldn't
[1:04:17] happen before time because they didn't
[1:04:19] have the technology before this time
[1:04:22] with all the sensors they have
[1:04:24] all the GPS they have and it's accurate
[1:04:28] this thing don't drink whiskey and rum
[1:04:29] so this thing are getting drunk to send
[1:04:31] you off the
[1:04:32] road this thing not getting sleepy so
[1:04:34] you're sure to go home and afterwards
[1:04:38] they will give the logic of why you
[1:04:40] should use it and you shouldn't drive
[1:04:44] because this doesn't make any mistakes
[1:04:46] this is Guided by
[1:04:48] AI artificial intelligence but you know
[1:04:51] who behind AI right it's Lucifer
[1:04:55] yeah yeah he he want to step into AI
[1:04:57] when you think you're talking to this
[1:04:58] one and talking to that one hey good

[1:11:05] beautiful Resurrection morning the Lord
[1:11:07] has given us and a privilege to come and
[1:11:10] serve him and worship him we want to
[1:11:13] dedicate this service it's a special
[1:11:15] service this morning to the Lord and I
[1:11:17] want us all to be dedicated I want us to
[1:11:20] be not just another service we don't
[1:11:23] want you to fall asleep there we don't
[1:11:25] want you we want you really to be
[1:11:27] consecrated because church is not just
[1:11:29] coming to church to be here but it's a
[1:11:32] place where brother man says we come to
[1:11:34] be right with God we come to fix up with
[1:11:37] God whatever is wrong in our lives we
[1:11:39] want God to fix it it's a new year
[1:11:42] 2024 so we see the signs of the coming
[1:11:45] of the Lord all around us we see the
[1:11:46] world falling apart we see Wars not
[1:11:50] rumors anymore we see Wars and the time
[1:11:53] is so so far spent we need to be right
[1:11:55] with God so we going to have a special
[1:11:57] prayer line after this but before we can
[1:12:00] pray we need to be
[1:12:01] dedicated we need to say Lord while the
[1:12:04] word is preached I'm dedicating myself
[1:12:06] I'm getting right I'm fixing up I'm not
[1:12:09] just sitting here and and going back and
[1:12:12] say it was a good service and nothing
[1:12:15] happens in my life brother B says every
[1:12:17] service you come to you go out better or
[1:12:20] worse and I've seen so many people go
[1:12:23] out worse wor until they don't even come
[1:12:25] back to church anymore we seen young
[1:12:27] girls sit in the benches hear the word
[1:12:29] of God walk right out and still go do
[1:12:32] their own thing and live in the world
[1:12:34] brother B says it comes a time where you
[1:12:36] cross the line and you can't come back
[1:12:39] so don't do that because we're living in
[1:12:41] such a serious time that you can't play
[1:12:43] around with the Lord anymore you can't
[1:12:45] take your chances anymore that time is
[1:12:48] pass even the married people we can't
[1:12:50] play around anymore why because the day
[1:12:54] of the Lord is upon us so we just pray
[1:12:56] that during this time that we
[1:13:00] listen uh deacons please keep the
[1:13:02] children from moving their parents also
[1:13:04] keep them and let us have a real
[1:13:07] dedication and a real consecrated
[1:13:11] service today and we believe that by the
[1:13:13] time we call the prayer line that God is
[1:13:16] going to do something for us who came
[1:13:18] for God to do something for them who
[1:13:21] came hungry who came thirsty thirsty who
[1:13:24] came

[1:24:45] word cast out demons so may it be so
[1:24:48] Lord that the anointing will break every
[1:24:50] yoke of the enemy take me out of the way
[1:24:53] may we see Jesus Christ Lord and we
[1:24:57] won't forget to give you all the honor
[1:25:00] the praise and the glory in Jesus name
[1:25:04] we ask it and the church shall say
[1:25:07] amen amen if you have your Bibles we in
[1:25:10] the Book of Matthew just two short
[1:25:12] scriptures Matthew 5 and then Matthew
[1:25:21] 13
[1:25:26] if you have it just say Amen
[1:25:29] am uh Matthew 5 and and verse 6 blessed
[1:25:34] are they which do hunger and thirst of
[1:25:38] the righteousness for they shall be
[1:25:41] filled amen amen and then Matthew
[1:25:46] 13:45 and verse
[1:25:50] 46 some of the the holy spirit said
[1:25:53] preach it from this
[1:25:55] scripture which we is very seldom read
[1:25:58] and yet is so
[1:26:01] striking if you have it amen amen he
[1:26:06] says again uh Jesus speaking of The
[1:26:08] Parables here again the Kingdom of
[1:26:11] Heaven is like unto a merchant man
[1:26:14] seeking goodly
[1:26:17] pears when he had found one pear of
[1:26:19] great price went and sold all that he
[1:26:23] had and bought it amen may the Lord add
[1:26:26] a blessing to the reading of his word
[1:26:28] you may be
[1:26:33] seated
[1:26:36] thanks so again what a privilege to be
[1:26:38] in the house of the Lord and there's
[1:26:41] some somehow Echo David on the speakers
[1:26:43] here and uh we looking forward for a
[1:26:47] blessing now the the pastor or the
[1:26:49] preacher don't have Revival the people
[1:26:51] brings the Revival
[1:26:53] so uh I believe you're going to sit
[1:26:55] there and uh preach with
[1:27:01] me and I'm going to try and talk today
[1:27:04] Lord help me amen so uh just to start
[1:27:09] off he says here in in
[1:27:11] expectation
[1:27:18] amen it
[1:27:20] says how many in years are believers in
[1:27:23] Divine
[1:27:25] Healing amen let's see your
[1:27:29] hands the power of God thank you look
[1:27:33] before there can be a creation there has
[1:27:35] to be a Creator to create that
[1:27:39] creation is that
[1:27:41] right well as long as you hungering for
[1:27:44] Divine Healing and the power of God
[1:27:47] there's got to be a fountain open
[1:27:49] somewhere so before you can hunger for
[1:27:51] that that's why I read that scripture
[1:27:53] there must be a fountain open somewhere
[1:27:56] before you could had that hunger the
[1:27:58] fountain was open he says yeah uh is
[1:28:02] that right is is is he says if there
[1:28:05] isn't healing you wouldn't have that in
[1:28:08] your heart the creator has to create
[1:28:11] that in your heart before you can even
[1:28:13] think of such a thing the process
[1:28:16] Hallelujah then you want more of God
[1:28:19] this is more or less where I got my uh
[1:28:21] my inspiration for the quote he says and
[1:28:24] if that is so he says then you want more
[1:28:27] of God cuz why there's something in you
[1:28:30] crying out but before you could cry out
[1:28:32] for more there had to be more amen isn't
[1:28:35] that beautiful it says then you want
[1:28:38] more of God you Hunger for More Of God
[1:28:40] and because that you do Hunger is very
[1:28:43] fine listen and because you that you
[1:28:47] hunger is a very fine
[1:28:50] evidence that there is some more of God
[1:28:54] to
[1:28:55] receive wow isn't that beautiful so
[1:28:58] before you could hunger he says that's a
[1:29:00] evidence that there is more of God to
[1:29:03] receive so if you came for more this
[1:29:05] morning then remember there's going to
[1:29:07] be more hallelujah praise the name of
[1:29:11] the Lord hallelujah praise God and if
[1:29:15] you crave for Divine Healing that shows
[1:29:18] that there is a fountain of Divine
[1:29:20] Healing somewhere that creation wouldn't
[1:29:23] be in your heart so that's why I say it
[1:29:26] depends how you came to church this
[1:29:28] morning hungry you came thirst and you
[1:29:30] want more of God well there had to be a
[1:29:33] fountain oh my goodness BR the song you
[1:29:36] sing I want more before there had to be
[1:29:39] more there had to be a fountain to get
[1:29:42] more amen Divine Healing somewhere that
[1:29:45] the creation wouldn't be in your it says
[1:29:48] uh for Divine Healing that shows that
[1:29:50] there is a fountain of div Divine
[1:29:53] Healing somewhere or that creation
[1:29:55] wouldn't be in your heart you get what I
[1:29:58] mean so it wouldn't be there and that's
[1:30:02] why we're here so it's a deep calling to
[1:30:04] a deep he says before there was a f on a
[1:30:08] fish back there had to be water for him
[1:30:10] to swim in before a tree could grow on
[1:30:13] the earth there had to be a Earth first
[1:30:16] so before you could hunger for healing
[1:30:18] there had to be a Healer first before
[1:30:20] you wanted a savior that
[1:30:22] you a sinner there had to be a savior
[1:30:24] first so before you could want more
[1:30:27] there had to be more
[1:30:30] [Applause]
[1:30:32] first my I see you spiritual so you got
[1:30:35] the message amen so he says here uh he
[1:30:39] cares for you now he says and Jesus so
[1:30:42] graciously taught us in the man buying
[1:30:44] pearls and he found the one great price
[1:30:48] and he sold all others to get it all the
[1:30:52] truths and everything that he had now
[1:30:53] watch he's he's making it he says truth
[1:30:56] so in other words this was a spiritual
[1:30:58] man so he had to let go of all that he
[1:31:02] knew so I hope you you CAU that n so
[1:31:05] it's not so much a natural things that
[1:31:07] he had but it was spiritual things and
[1:31:10] what he grew up with and who was his
[1:31:12] Pastor before and what he was taught and
[1:31:14] what church he had to let go of
[1:31:17] that Hallelujah he had to let go of that
[1:31:21] to and okay he says and he found the one
[1:31:25] great price he sold all the others that
[1:31:29] to get it all the truths and everything
[1:31:32] that he had though they were good
[1:31:34] BS this meant he says but this one meant
[1:31:38] all to him and when you find God's
[1:31:41] ultimate word watch a promise Upon A
[1:31:45] Certain thing you must know first that
[1:31:47] is God's word that the things that
[1:31:50] you've seen been done in God he says
[1:31:53] there there is no no no maybe so it
[1:31:58] could be so it looks like it might be so
[1:32:01] he says it is God then when you get to
[1:32:05] that spot that's when the P of great
[1:32:08] price must get away and you have to get
[1:32:10] away from everything so this is not a
[1:32:14] maybe so or a so so or I think so no
[1:32:17] this is the pearl of great price who is
[1:32:20] the pearl of great price Jesus Christ so
[1:32:23] you sell everything to get the pearl of
[1:32:26] great price you let go of the world you
[1:32:28] let go of your friends you let go of
[1:32:31] your family you let go why because you
[1:32:33] found
[1:32:35] Christ Christ is the PE of great price
[1:32:39] and you sell out brother it doesn't
[1:32:41] matter you let go no matter how precious
[1:32:44] it seems you had to leave church friends
[1:32:47] you had to leave your family but when
[1:32:50] you get Christ that means nothing
[1:32:52] because now you got everything hey come
[1:32:55] on once you have Christ you have
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:06] everything now when I drink more water
[1:33:08] you must keep the amens going okay so we
[1:33:11] don't want we don't want the anointing
[1:33:12] to drop and then I must build up just
[1:33:15] keep when I take water you say come you
[1:33:18] keep going out amen so that man that
[1:33:21] when he found the ultimate one he says
[1:33:24] then he says you might be it is God then
[1:33:27] you get to that spot that you know that
[1:33:30] the pearl of great price you get away
[1:33:33] from anything else and that's what we
[1:33:36] all did we were all in different
[1:33:37] denominations but when we found this
[1:33:40] message Hallelujah brother we found the
[1:33:43] pearl of great price he didn't care who
[1:33:46] said what he didn't care what the
[1:33:48] minister said when we found the pill and
[1:33:51] remember the message is Christ this
[1:33:54] message reveals Jesus
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:34:02] Christ
[1:34:04] Hallelujah my feel anointing
[1:34:07] here he says here and then anything is
[1:34:11] right he says price you must get away
[1:34:13] from everything that anybody else tells
[1:34:15] you contrary to it you must he says you
[1:34:17] get away so you get away from the ch ch
[1:34:20] ch ch and this one is doing that that
[1:34:22] one said that you get away hey I don't
[1:34:25] want to M my experience with Christ I
[1:34:28] got the pearl of great price and I don't
[1:34:29] want to lose it I don't want to lose it
[1:34:31] brother Frank so no matter who says what
[1:34:34] what who's doing what I don't want to
[1:34:36] hear that I got the pear of great price
[1:34:38] and I want to cherish it amen
[1:34:42] hallelujah you must not look to what man
[1:34:46] has achieved you must look to what God
[1:34:47] has said and what he promised and see
[1:34:50] him do it and that's your ultimate right
[1:34:53] there and then everything that you are
[1:34:55] everything that you was everything that
[1:34:57] you hope to be must be placed upon that
[1:35:00] and just as though it was death and life
[1:35:04] to you at that moment so this P of great
[1:35:06] price is so great it's between it's
[1:35:09] between life and death it's more than

[1:35:15] car it's more than your money it's more
[1:35:17] than listen it's more than anything you
[1:35:19] can gain because all that remains behind
[1:35:22] but Christ will be forever brother when
[1:35:25] there's no more Moon and there's no more
[1:35:27] stars Christ will still be there the
[1:35:30] pearl of great price will still be there

[1:47:17] and to your cities and go back to where

[1:49:58] and then they begin to glean in Boaz
[1:50:01] field and boas was the lord of the
[1:50:03] Harvest and when he came riding on his
[1:50:06] horse and he spotted as they were
[1:50:08] gleaning there he spotted Ruth and he
[1:50:11] wanted to know who's this girl Ruth was
[1:50:13] a
[1:50:16] gentile Bo was the lord of the Harvest I
[1:50:20] hope you got a revelation she was a
[1:50:23] gentile he was a Jew but when he saw her
[1:50:26] he told the Reapers don't let she glean
[1:50:29] in any other

[2:07:48] and papa don't speak to you that we
[2:07:50] we're not concerned about you we
[2:07:52] concerned but you know what we rebuking
[2:07:55] that devil that's got you bound it's a
[2:07:58] spirit it's only a spirit that's got you
[2:08:01] bound and you feel a little later a
[2:08:03] little later a little later one day he's
[2:08:05] going to say
[2:08:06] enough Hallelujah then the extras kick
[2:08:09] in hey hallelujah oh Hallelujah and the
[2:08:13] spirit that's in me is one with me and
[2:08:16] I'll speak the word for you and you're
[2:08:18] going to come child you're going to come
[2:08:21] daughter you're going to come brother
[2:08:22] amen
[2:08:24] son you see so when you ask more God
[2:08:27] gives you more we look at Jacob in
[2:08:29] Genesis 32 Jacob wanted more from the
[2:08:32] angel and he could not make it if this
[2:08:35] Angel didn't bless him Hallelujah so we
[2:08:38] know how he sent over everything all his
[2:08:40] money his wives his concubines his C and
[2:08:43] and and his brother Kan I mean uh Esau
[2:08:48] was still upset and wanted to kill him
[2:08:50] because he stole the birthright but
[2:08:52] you're going to see something that that
[2:08:55] that made Jacob
[2:08:56] special even though he was a
[2:09:00] Shyer something in his heart was right
[2:09:03] with a
[2:09:05] word his life wasn't but his heart was
[2:09:08] right with the word or there was a seed
[2:09:10] in
[2:09:12] him and you don't even know there's a
[2:09:15] seed in
[2:09:16] you and you running this way and you in
[2:09:18] that way and you don't want to give your
[2:09:19] life to Christ but listen one day the
[2:09:21] holy spirit is going to come and he's
[2:09:22] going to track you
[2:09:24] down so he says something more to meet
[2:09:28] the challenge because he realized he
[2:09:29] sent everything nothing we need to get
[2:09:32] alone with God and when he was alone
[2:09:34] with God tell him you need more you're
[2:09:37] not going to make it
[2:09:39] without getting
[2:09:42] more so no matter what he
[2:09:45] did no matter what he sent over it
[2:09:48] didn't stop the WTH and the
[2:09:50] judgments but you see God wanted to get
[2:09:53] him
[2:09:54] alone and that's our problem we too much
[2:09:56] in a click and a group and in this click
[2:09:58] and we don't talk to that we don't and
[2:10:00] that's your problem that's why God can't
[2:10:02] move God can't deal because we form
[2:10:04] Clicks in the church young people you
[2:10:05] don't do that you must be able to speak
[2:10:08] to everyone in this church fellowship
[2:10:09] with everyone there's people you don't
[2:10:12] even know their names there's people
[2:10:14] that come and visit that's why I I I
[2:10:16] asked the deacons what's the names
[2:10:17] because I want people to feel welcome
[2:10:20] but we run to our click and we just with
[2:10:21] our click and we forget these people
[2:10:24] visitors that come we leave them they
[2:10:25] need to be talking they need to feel
[2:10:27] welcome and what I want to tell you from
[2:10:30] me I like you mothers and you visitors
[2:10:32] I'm glad to see you when you're walking
[2:10:35] and I mention your name because I want
[2:10:36] you to feel welcome this is a church
[2:10:39] built on brotherly kindness not on
[2:10:42] scandalism and not on one side this and
[2:10:44] one no it's built on brotherly kindness
[2:10:48] even even if we don't have one Miracle
[2:10:50] but we have love for one
[2:10:52] another oh this one comes fresh man how
[2:10:56] can you say you love God but you didn't
[2:10:58] see
[2:10:59] him he said if you love me love my
[2:11:02] [Applause]
[2:11:09] children
[2:11:11] [Applause]
[2:11:13] my the Bible say you say you love God
[2:11:15] did you see
[2:11:17] God who saw God but we see his children
[2:11:22] now he said if you love me love my
[2:11:25] children so when I love you I'm loving
[2:11:28] God don't say oh Lord I love you and I
[2:11:31] treat my his children like nonsense like
[2:11:34] rubbish they don't even exist because I
[2:11:36] feel I'm higher than you and I'm more
[2:11:38] important you are nothing man I am
[2:11:41] nothing we all on the same level that's
[2:11:44] where we are that's where we are we on
[2:11:46] the same level brother k no one is Big
[2:11:49] me and small you we all the same whether
[2:11:52] you 30 years in the message whether you
[2:11:55] two days in the message we are the
[2:12:02] same
[2:12:04] Hallelujah and in this church there's no
[2:12:07] aparted here we are all the same amen we
[2:12:10] all the same we believe the same we
[2:12:14] stand the same Hallelujah man that's how
[2:12:18] it ought to be I love you my brother I
[2:12:21] love you my sister man no colard no
[2:12:24] Africans I don't see that where do I see
[2:12:26] that I see you as my brother I don't
[2:12:29] care where you come
[2:12:32] from and you old people you know me you
[2:12:35] know
[2:12:36] [Applause]
[2:12:38] me you know what I got a brown suit on
[2:12:47] today
[2:12:49] those who know me you know who I am and
[2:12:52] I got this year I'm not playing games
[2:12:54] with nobody I don't want any
[2:12:56] clannishness I don't want any among the
[2:12:59] children talks and stories and I don't
[2:13:01] speak to that one and I'm more higher
[2:13:04] there's no one Higher there's no one
[2:13:06] more important we're all the same we all
[2:13:09] need God all of us need
[2:13:13] God you see I can speak to anyone in
[2:13:16] this church did you see may do that
[2:13:19] anyone I'm friends with I don't have a
[2:13:21] special click I'm
[2:13:24] [Music]
[2:13:26] with so where did that come
[2:13:29] from
[2:13:31] Hallelujah God help us man I'm saying
[2:13:34] that because we want more and those type
[2:13:37] of spirits cut off the spirit of God so
[2:13:40] with anointing upon me I'm cutting off
[2:13:42] that Spirit chopping it off brother Ben
[2:13:46] says becomes a cancer in the church so
[2:13:48] cut it out before it be becomes a can as
[2:13:51] a whole
[2:13:56] church so you see sometime God wants you
[2:13:59] alone so he gets you away from those
[2:14:01] friends he wants you
[2:14:04] alone he can't deal with you because you
[2:14:06] were that click now God give you re but
[2:14:09] you must first bounce it off this one
[2:14:11] and hear what this one brother God is
[2:14:14] dealing with you as an
[2:14:16] individual it's not group Revelation
[2:14:19] it's an individual
[2:14:21] [Applause]
[2:14:22] Revelation okay in the church ages he
[2:14:25] says it's a word or receit that is way
[2:14:28] back there uh too far back for the human
[2:14:32] mind to grasp the Eternal god with
[2:14:34] eternal thoughts thought and decreed
[2:14:37] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[2:14:39] Romans 9:13 and neither was born neither
[2:14:42] had done good or evil see it was the
[2:14:45] thought and then that thought became
[2:14:47] expressed BL and God brought back Jacob
[2:14:51] because Jacob alone was
[2:14:54] seed
[2:14:56] yes you see why you are brought back
[2:14:58] because you alone are
[2:15:01] seed the you know I thought the whole
[2:15:03] world will Embrace this but they didn't
[2:15:05] only the seed can come back only the
[2:15:09] seed so you're not even the seed it's a
[2:15:12] seed of God in you and he's calling that
[2:15:14] seed oh prci God hallelujah
[2:15:19] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:15:22] hallelujah so only that seed Jacob alone
[2:15:25] had the seed that is why you had respect
[2:15:28] to the birthright and Covenant of God if
[2:15:30] you are true seed you will hear the word
[2:15:33] the spirit will baptize you into the
[2:15:35] body of Christ filling you empowering
[2:15:38] you and you will receive the word for
[2:15:40] your day and age oh my so you see
[2:15:44] because you see it you will receive it
[2:15:46] amen you're not going to be lost you
[2:15:49] can't go lost your name is there and
[2:15:51] there's a seed in
[2:15:54] you now watch so I said he needed more
[2:15:57] but here he says in the first seal and
[2:15:59] then there is coming forth seven
[2:16:01] mysterious Thunders that's not even
[2:16:03] written in at all that's right and I
[2:16:06] believe what the prophet now that
[2:16:08] through these seven Thunders will be
[2:16:10] revealed in the last days in order to
[2:16:13] get the bride together for rapturing
[2:16:15] Faith now listen because what we got
[2:16:19] now wouldn't be able to do it so you
[2:16:23] mean brother Raymond we need more to
[2:16:25] make it for the
[2:16:27] Rapture hey I hope you see that what we
[2:16:31] got now we can't do it we need a Rapture
[2:16:35] in
[2:16:37] faith yes so you mean brother I want
[2:16:41] more because what I got now I can't even
[2:16:43] have faith for healing but I need faith
[2:16:46] for this body to be changed so those
[2:16:49] seven Thunders will be revealed in the
[2:16:51] last days in order to get the bride
[2:16:53] together for Rapture in faith because
[2:16:55] what we got right now we wouldn't be
[2:16:57] able to do it there is something oh my
[2:17:00] goodness we got to step further we can't
[2:17:04] have enough faith for Divine Healing
[2:17:06] hardly we got to have enough Faith to be
[2:17:10] changed in a moment to we swep out of
[2:17:13] this Earth and we'll find that after a
[2:17:15] while where it is written so you mean
[2:17:18] brother Raymond what I have now I can't
[2:17:20] make it but listen those seven Thunders
[2:17:22] will be here in order to give you
[2:17:24] Rapture in faith you say I don't have it
[2:17:27] now I don't have it too but I know it's
[2:17:29] going to be here and when it's here it's
[2:17:31] going to change your body woo Hallelujah
[2:17:35] where's the scientist now they can't
[2:17:37] explain it but you know there will be a
[2:17:39] faith that will come on the earth amen
[2:17:43] hallelujah brother George that's going
[2:17:45] to change the
[2:17:46] bodies
[2:17:51] okay this is where I really also got
[2:17:54] inspiration and this is a double portion
[2:17:57] he says Elijah and Elisha and Elisha
[2:18:00] followed him all the way from gilgal
[2:18:03] then he says is the Lord sent me to
[2:18:05] bethl and he says stay behind he says no
[2:18:08] as my soul liveth in yours I'm not
[2:18:10] leaving you what did Elisha do that for
[2:18:14] he knew there's
[2:18:16] more woo
[2:18:18] Hallelujah and remember when Elijah got
[2:18:21] him he just took off the mantle and
[2:18:23] threw it over Elisha and Elisha felt
[2:18:26] that anointing he chopped up the ox he
[2:18:29] chopped up the car and the brother says
[2:18:32] he gave it to the poor to eat but he
[2:18:34] says as your soul liveth than my soul
[2:18:36] I'm not leaving you they went from
[2:18:38] gilgal to bethl from bethl to Jericho
[2:18:41] then they got the sons of the school of
[2:18:43] the prophets and he said no listen man
[2:18:45] you better stay here he has all your
[2:18:49] [Music]
[2:18:51] bodes he said I'm not leaving you he
[2:18:53] says well the Lord sent me to
[2:18:56] Jordan now that's where many people fall
[2:18:59] off because Jordan means dying

[2:19:12] brother M say you don't even have a
[2:19:14] thought coming he says it must be the
[2:19:16] word and then he went to Jordan now

[2:27:12] there was so much but we leave it
[2:27:14] brother George and and I'm just going to
[2:27:17] take this one instant he this voice that
[2:27:19] spoke to him all the years and he wanted
[2:27:21] to know who it is and what it is and he
[2:27:23] couldn't understand this Supernatural
[2:27:26] that spoke to him so he he told his wife
[2:27:28] listen I'm packing a bag he says a
[2:27:30] certain place there's a money if I don't
[2:27:33] come back use that money to raise your
[2:27:35] children so if I don't come back use
[2:27:38] that that's for you take care raise them
[2:27:39] up but I must find out he knew there's
[2:27:44] more he knew this voice is spoke to me
[2:27:47] to find out what it is oh brother Kevin
[2:27:50] yeah he goes to his cabin his cave and
[2:27:53] he's praying Lord what is all this about
[2:27:55] why am I in the message why do I believe
[2:27:58] like I believe why why do I feel the way
[2:28:00] I feel over this message and I see
[2:28:02] others don't and brother bam was
[2:28:04] concerned oh brother and can you imagine
[2:28:07] the desperation it's dark in the cave
[2:28:10] he's praying he's crying he he made sure
[2:28:13] he left his family you see what it is
[2:28:16] sometimes you have to separate God got
[2:28:17] him
[2:28:19] alone and when he was alone and praying
[2:28:23] and screaming and all of a sudden while
[2:28:25] he's praying he looks on the floor and
[2:28:27] there's a pillar of fire circling
[2:28:29] circling like that and as he looks he
[2:28:32] says and into that fire steps an angel
[2:28:35] and he stands there folded arms brother
[2:28:39] say over 6' tall he head to his shoulder
[2:28:42] a gown on and he said fear not I'm sent
[2:28:45] from the presence of God God to let you
[2:28:47] know your mysterious life is for a
[2:28:50] purpose that God has a Ministry for you
[2:28:53] to take a cross around the world why he
[2:28:56] knew this
[2:29:12] more I'm going to close with
[2:29:15] Samson I want us to
[2:29:20] stand Samson knew that he had failed God
[2:29:24] they pierc out his eyes and brother says
[2:29:26] that was a sign of the Prophet cuz the
[2:29:28] prophet is a sear he says but only the
[2:29:30] intelligence was left above the eyes
[2:29:34] tongues was Pentecost here was prophet
[2:29:36] and then here was
[2:29:40] Intelligence and they cut his hair
[2:29:42] off now watch how smart is God he
[2:29:45] blinded those Phil
[2:29:47] Ines not to see that his hair was
[2:29:51] growing
[2:29:52] again that's why God says I will restore
[2:29:56] the enemy eat that tree tree of life
[2:29:59] right down to a stump but God said don't
[2:30:02] worry I'm going to restore and then
[2:30:04] Luther came and then Wesley came and
[2:30:06] Pentecost and then Malachi 4 but now
[2:30:09] we're right back hey come on brother and
[2:30:12] Samson stood there and B says he kept
[2:30:14] feeling it's not there and he go another
[2:30:17] few years and he kept feeling it's not
[2:30:19] there but he knew it's coming and I hope
[2:30:22] you know that it's coming brother
[2:30:24] there's no blessing I was just speaking
[2:30:26] to brother car and I said you know what
[2:30:28] brother car there's no more Revival left
[2:30:30] that's why people is falling away but
[2:30:32] there's one Revival and that's a seven
[2:30:34] Thunder Revival nothing else is Promised
[2:30:37] but that Revival the 144 will have their
[2:30:40] Revival so I'm not interested in 144

[2:30:46] Revival

[3:11:11] and in examining it it was not a bumb as
[3:11:13] I thought but a bone that was beginning
[3:11:16] to push its way out had purpose not to
[3:11:19] go to the doctor my husband prayed about
[3:11:21] 3 weeks ago for my healing and the
[3:11:23] discomfort I was feeling I continued
[3:11:25] believing for the healing cuz I know God
[3:11:27] promised healing as a daughter of God
[3:11:30] and he's going to perfect that which
[3:11:31] concerneth me on Wednesday night brother
