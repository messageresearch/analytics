[27:54] from verse 1
[27:56] says
[27:57] and joshua the son of nun
[27:59] sent out of him to men to spy
[28:02] secretly saying
[28:03] go
[28:05] view the land even jericho
[28:07] and they went and came into an harlot's
[28:09] house named rehab
[28:11] and lodged there
[28:12] and it was told the king of jericho
[28:14] saying behold there came men in hitherto
[28:15] the night
[28:16] of the children of israel to search out
[28:18] the country
[28:20] and the king of jericho sent unto rehab

[28:24] to thee
[28:25] which are entered into thine house
[28:27] for they become to search out all the
[28:28] country and the woman took the two men
[28:31] and hit them and said thus
[28:33] they came men unto me but i wished not
[28:35] once they were
[28:37] and it came to pass about the time of
[28:38] the shutting of shutting of the gate
[28:41] when it was dark that the men went out
[28:43] whether the men went i uh that the men
[28:46] went out whether the men went i what not
[28:48] pursue after them quickly for ye shall
[28:50] overtake them

[28:53] of the house and hit them with the
[28:54] stacks of stalks of flax which she had
[28:57] laid in order
[28:58] upon the roof
[29:00] and the men proceeded after them and on
[29:01] the way to jordan onto the fords and as
[29:04] soon as they which were pursued after
[29:05] them were gone out they shut the gate
[29:07] and before they were laid down she came
[29:10] up onto them up onto up on upon the roof
[29:14] and she said unto the man i know
[29:16] that the lord had given you the land
[29:18] and that your terror is fallen upon us
[29:21] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[29:23] faint because of you

[35:08] on chapter one
[35:09] in jericho
[35:11] amen the great wall city of
[35:14] jericho jericho was a great wall city
[35:17] isn't that right
[35:18] bible spoke about jericho briefly in
[35:21] these scriptures
[35:22] and um
[35:24] to my knowledge a wall
[35:26] like the size that was around jericho
[35:29] it's not the kind of wall that you could
[35:30] build in a day
[35:32] it was a huge wall
[35:33] matter of fact that wall was there
[35:35] before joshua came on the scene
[35:37] it was always there
[35:39] it was there so long that people built
[35:40] houses in the walls
[35:43] so secure were they in their
[35:45] fortification
[35:46] amen isn't that right i'm gonna start
[35:49] real slow i'm just gonna take my time
[35:51] but you say man when the word strikes
[35:52] you
[35:54] don't be afraid praise god
[35:56] amen i'm not saying anything strange
[35:58] hallelujah but if you're at the book of
[36:00] joshua you know that these walls were
[36:01] there a long time
[36:04] and um
[36:06] i did a little research on jericho and
[36:08] so on and that city that dwelt so long
[36:10] ago and it was it was that when
[36:15] joshua had crossed this river of jordan
[36:17] isn't that right
[36:18] and they had come over into the land
[36:20] of promise
[36:21] that jericho was this first city that
[36:23] they had to encounter
[36:25] it was a great city it was a great
[36:27] powerful city amen isn't that right they
[36:29] had a military they had a government
[36:31] system they had money they had an
[36:34] economic system they had cars they had
[36:37] buildings they had fancy technology they
[36:39] had medical science they had everything
[36:41] that you could ever want
[36:43] hallelujah that was dwelling in jericho
[36:45] it was a real nice place to live if you
[36:48] had money and you had a good job it's a
[36:50] real nice place kind of like the
[36:51] condition of the world that that the
[36:53] world is in today
[36:55] oh hallelujah some people didn't want to
[36:57] leave
[36:58] hollywood some people want to stay isn't
[36:59] that right
[37:00] this great jericho city
[37:02] praise god hallelujah hallelujah are you
[37:04] with me this morning
[37:06] jericho lay in a low-lying area
[37:08] apparently in a geographical state
[37:11] so if you had to get anywhere into
[37:13] canaan
[37:14] the land of the jebusites or the
[37:15] hittites or the paris acts if you wanted
[37:17] to get there you had to pass through
[37:18] jericho
[37:20] amen it's not right
[37:21] joshua knew it so this was his first
[37:23] great campaign
[37:24] praise god to take jericho city
[37:26] amen but it was very big it was very
[37:29] great now it was a fortified structure
[37:31] behind those walls was their greatest uh
[37:35] defense isn't that right
[37:37] it was their probably their only line of
[37:38] defense was this great wall from behind
[37:41] that wall they would fight all their
[37:43] battles i guess and jericho stood for
[37:45] all those years because of that war
[37:47] that kept them hemmed in isn't that
[37:49] right i kept them fenced in isn't that
[37:51] right
[37:52] hallelujah that protected them from the
[37:53] outside world
[37:55] as far as the bible goes and history
[37:57] goes
[37:58] jericho is a place that did a lot of
[38:00] marketing they did a lot of trade and
[38:02] commerce people came from all over egypt
[38:05] different places to do trade and barton
[38:08] the different things and trading and
[38:09] money and expenses and so on in in
[38:11] jericho
[38:12] that's how come a babylonian garment
[38:14] ended up in jericho
[38:16] it wasn't made in jericho somebody
[38:17] brought that there paid money for it and
[38:19] so on
[38:20] so you're understanding the story now
[38:22] praise god amen amen hallelujah so this
[38:25] is jericho
[38:26] great rich place rich in agriculture
[38:28] rich in wealth witch and money
[38:30] hallelujah i have need of nothing
[38:32] praise god that was their condition that
[38:34] was jericho's condition
[38:36] praise god hallelujah they were the
[38:37] great gateway to the land of canaan
[38:40] however they they esteemed themselves in
[38:41] their position
[38:43] they felt pretty proud about who they
[38:44] were
[38:45] holly but not knowing that there was a
[38:46] joshua that was on the scene
[38:49] not knowing that god had already accused
[38:51] that city
[38:53] isn't that right he called it a cursed
[38:55] city and i guess after true trade and
[38:58] speaking and communicating with
[38:59] different nations different people
[39:01] brought their gods and their idols and
[39:03] their different ways and forms of
[39:04] worship after all the police came become
[39:06] corrupt
[39:07] hallelujah isn't that right the place
[39:09] got mixed up with all kind of funny
[39:11] interpretations
[39:12] there's my preaching on the street and
[39:13] that guy trying to do this here and all
[39:15] kind of weird religions was taking place
[39:17] in jericho is a it was a melting pot of
[39:19] societies and and religions and and what
[39:22] people thought and and and it built
[39:24] walls
[39:25] walls physical and world spiritual
[39:28] hallelujah all around jericho praise god
[39:30] amen isn't that right
[39:33] hallelujah
[39:34] amen amen but the people were afraid
[39:37] because of their financial position
[39:39] that jericho found themselves in they
[39:41] had to protect themselves
[39:42] from outside elements and outside forces
[39:45] so they built a wall
[39:47] to protect themselves from the outside
[39:49] to protect themselves from everything
[39:51] else isn't that right
[39:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[39:55] amen and i began to think about walls
[39:57] and that wall that jericho built
[40:00] and you know sometimes
[40:01] we in our lives we we feel pretty secure
[40:04] about who we are
[40:06] isn't that right
[40:07] we feel pretty secure we
[40:09] feel pretty good about what we've done
[40:11] what we've achieved
[40:13] what we've accomplished as individuals
[40:15] isn't that right some of us have great
[40:16] education some of us have gone to
[40:18] different schools and things some of us
[40:20] have good jobs and so on and sometimes
[40:22] you feel real secure about these things
[40:24] and sometimes these things these very
[40:26] things that we feel so secure about
[40:28] build a wall
[40:30] they tend to block people out
[40:32] sometimes we even block god out
[40:34] because we're building a wall
[40:36] a wall made of bricks
[40:38] and each brick is something that
[40:40] happened or something that took place
[40:41] some experience
[40:43] and it just keep building building brick
[40:45] after brick after brick
[40:46] and sometimes people come to church and
[40:48] they say amen and they shake hands but
[40:50] there's a wall there
[40:52] oh same and someone
[40:54] people come to church for years
[40:56] but that wall is still there
[40:59] i can't lock you in a prison more than
[41:01] the wall that you've built for your own
[41:02] self
[41:05] same and somebody
[41:07] hallelujah
[41:08] one time paul and silas was in prison
[41:10] isn't that right
[41:12] and they began to worship and praise god
[41:14] isn't that right hallelujah they were in
[41:16] a prison hallelujah but what the jails
[41:18] keepers didn't know what the people of
[41:20] that time didn't know hallelujah was
[41:22] that paul was already a prisoner of
[41:24] christ
[41:26] if you couldn't lock up a locked up man
[41:28] he was already locked up in car he was
[41:30] already wrapped up come on he was
[41:33] already tied up come on he was already
[41:35] tangled up in god
[41:37] you couldn't lock up a locked up man
[41:39] oh hallelujah just about midnight when
[41:42] he began to praise and worship god all
[41:44] of a sudden all of a sudden you'd began
[41:47] to shake something can be gonna happen
[41:49] somebody began to take place hallelujah
[41:52] that they did not expect all of a sudden
[41:54] those walls began to give way
[41:58] the bible said every door
[42:00] opened up
[42:02] it was a long jail was a door here a
[42:04] door here a door here a door here but
[42:06] that angel dropped down on the scene
[42:08] and when he began to praise and worship
[42:10] god when he began to thank him and
[42:12] praise him and get in the spirit
[42:14] something began to happen
[42:16] every door
[42:18] that they walked through
[42:20] was kicked wide open
[42:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[42:25] praise god this morning
[42:27] i don't care what toy's trying to keep
[42:29] you in i don't care what wall's trying
[42:31] to keep you in you stay in the spirit
[42:33] you stay in the atmosphere
[42:35] you keep praising god you stay in that
[42:37] atmosphere this morning and god will do
[42:39] something for you
[42:41] you watch god begin to open every door
[42:44] open every door in your life
[42:46] open every circumstance break everything
[42:48] down to make a way for you
[42:51] because you are his son same and
[42:53] somebody
[42:54] you are his daughter this morning
[42:56] oh hallelujah
[43:05] hallelujah hiding behind those walls
[43:08] that's what we do sometimes
[43:10] put a wall up hide behind it
[43:13] smile
[43:14] shake hands
[43:16] do all the nice things play ties
[43:19] hold the little babies and kiss them
[43:21] great walls
[43:22] standing there the pharisees
[43:25] sadducees were like walking walls
[43:27] jesus knew it
[43:29] said yo you're like you're like your
[43:31] father's
[43:32] uh you are you're like your forefathers
[43:34] you're a dead man
[43:36] he looked at them and he could see those
[43:38] walls standing there great tall and
[43:40] proud
[43:41] they were all studied up
[43:43] they knew everything in a scripture and
[43:44] yet they couldn't see god manifested in
[43:46] front of them
[43:47] because there was a wall
[43:49] blocking them from seeing the messiah in
[43:52] his trueness and his fullness and his
[43:54] sweetness and his humility they failed
[43:56] to see messiah
[43:58] why because there was a wall there
[44:00] a wall of the education
[44:03] a wall of their schooling and a
[44:05] doctrinal
[44:07] a wall that was built
[44:08] isn't that right
[44:14] just kind of touch and taste a little
[44:15] bit in
[44:16] move on
[44:18] my
[44:19] a wall isn't that right
[44:22] and i read in the bible we read in the
[44:24] bible just now that it was something
[44:26] called the shutting of the gate in the
[44:27] evening time isn't that right
[44:29] so i'm guessing at some point in time
[44:30] during the day the gates will be open
[44:32] and they would allow trade and commerce
[44:33] people to come and go as they please and
[44:36] of course there would be a time in the
[44:37] evening i don't know if it was six
[44:38] o'clock nine o'clock or whenever but
[44:40] there would be a shutting of the gate
[44:41] yeah
[44:42] the evening time they would shut the
[44:43] gate
[44:44] close the gates no one could go away no
[44:46] one could come out nothing could happen
[44:47] until i guess
[44:48] next morning isn't that right
[44:51] please go so that's my introduction this
[44:53] morning chapter one of the story
[44:55] praise god hallelujah jericho the great
[44:57] world city

[45:04] bride this morning
[45:06] he many many men now the bible describes
[45:09] rahab as a harlot
[45:10] she was a prostitute woman isn't that
[45:12] right

[45:15] i guess low level in society there were
[45:18] a lot of esteemed politicians in the day
[45:20] of jericho
[45:21] there were kings there were priests
[45:23] there were great men there were leaders
[45:25] there were great leaders in society they
[45:27] were great influential people great men
[45:29] politicians people would vote for
[45:31] congress and and commerce and people big
[45:34] business owners and so forth isn't that
[45:35] right people who drove fancy cars and
[45:37] lived in nice houses
[45:39] nice people rich people rich in goods
[45:42] have need of nothing
[45:44] they were good people wonderful people
[45:46] people he would put up there on a
[45:48] pedestal sure if god was to speak to
[45:50] anybody they would speak to that person
[45:53] but here was rehab a hard woman
[45:56] a prostitute woman

[45:59] very descriptive life

[46:15] you'd say no no no we wouldn't invite
[46:16] her to the party we would invite her to
[46:18] the social gathering
[46:20] when jericho looked at rehab they saw a
[46:22] harlot

[1:18:59] joseph 6.
[1:19:00] isn't that right
[1:19:02] the cause great still among the people
[1:19:04] what was it
[1:19:05] let's get to chapter 3 now of my story
[1:19:08] the two messengers
[1:19:11] so two messengers went into jericho
[1:19:12] isn't that right
[1:19:14] hallelujah honolulu went into jericho
[1:19:15] and actual joshua sent two spies out of
[1:19:19] to view jericho isn't that right to go
[1:19:21] undercover to go and talk to the people
[1:19:24] bring back some feedback
[1:19:26] bring me back some word gotta be on the
[1:19:28] right path holiday things are in its
[1:19:30] place hallelujah they were to bring back
[1:19:32] word to joshua
[1:19:33] but it got into a little bit of trouble
[1:19:35] these two messengers had to take refuge
[1:19:38] in rahab's house isn't that right
[1:19:40] of all the people that they could take
[1:19:42] refuge
[1:19:43] they were great prime ministers in those
[1:19:44] days they were great presidents in those
[1:19:46] days there were people at real nice
[1:19:48] houses but god chose these two men
[1:19:51] the bible said they lodged in rahab's
[1:19:53] camp
[1:19:54] they lodged in rahab's house the house
[1:19:57] that was upon the war
[1:19:58] and when they got in there i guess they
[1:20:00] spent a little while there and they were
[1:20:02] able to testify to rahab
[1:20:04] rahab knew those men were different she
[1:20:06] had met men from all over the world she
[1:20:08] had met men from in egypt and met men
[1:20:10] from babylon and this place and that
[1:20:12] place she knew what they looked like by
[1:20:14] their clothes and by their conversation
[1:20:16] and by their they
[1:20:18] words and so forth the dictation it was
[1:20:20] different but she knew that these men
[1:20:22] were different
[1:20:23] she could tell that these men were
[1:20:24] israelites and she knew the stories
[1:20:27] about the israelites
[1:20:28] and she put these two men to sit down
[1:20:31] and she said i want you to tell me
[1:20:32] all about what's been going on all about
[1:20:35] what's been taking place tell me about
[1:20:37] this great god that you serve

[1:20:58] how you walk tell me a little about how
[1:21:00] you talk praise i want to know i want to
[1:21:03] experience it
[1:21:05] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:09] oh my
[1:21:10] god we're going to testify i believe
[1:21:12] you're going to tell ray ham all about
[1:21:14] what they've seen and heard how they've
[1:21:16] seen jericho open up how they've seen it
[1:21:19] amen isn't that egypt and the plagues
[1:21:21] and this had happened and that had
[1:21:22] happened and all the stories that
[1:21:24] happened way back since the beginning
[1:21:26] since the books of genesis they began to
[1:21:28] tell her all about the history of the
[1:21:30] god that they serve
[1:21:31] and how that god was able to deliver
[1:21:33] them how that god had brought them
[1:21:35] through great triumph great pestilence
[1:21:37] and how the day was standing only
[1:21:39] because a generation after generation
[1:21:41] had sought the word of the lord and god
[1:21:43] had delivered them generation after
[1:21:45] generation and here they were standing
[1:21:47] as a testimony of all that god had done
[1:21:51] and they began to testify all about what
[1:21:53] was god i was going to do
[1:21:55] how god was going to take jericho how
[1:21:57] god was going to destroy the land and
[1:21:59] slay the land utterly isn't that right
[1:22:03] hallelujah
[1:22:05] she heard the testimony
[1:22:07] isn't that right
[1:22:08] it fellowshipped a little while
[1:22:10] hallelujah
[1:22:12] amen amen
[1:22:13] so advice it was by god's grace
[1:22:16] these two messengers came by to rehab a
[1:22:18] harlot a unknown person
[1:22:21] a jane doe as it was she was unknown to
[1:22:23] jericho not very uh
[1:22:26] person that would be you know what you
[1:22:27] would elevate
[1:22:29] but god saw it fit to send these two
[1:22:31] messengers her way
[1:22:33] this was the grace of god to her
[1:22:35] hallelujah and she began to realize how
[1:22:38] dark the situation was getting she began
[1:22:40] to get become concerned she began to
[1:22:42] become convinced
[1:22:44] she began to realize that there was
[1:22:45] something she had to do
[1:22:47] in order to escape the destruction that
[1:22:49] was coming upon jericho because if god
[1:22:51] could open a red sea if god could open a
[1:22:54] jordan river if god could cause flies
[1:22:56] and frogs and plagues to come upon egypt
[1:22:59] then she knew that jericho was nothing
[1:23:00] in god's hands
[1:23:02] god was going to spy jericho just as
[1:23:04] sure as he had smith in egypt just as
[1:23:06] sure as he had smoked smith and those
[1:23:08] two kings over the river of jordan she
[1:23:11] knew the situation was beginning to get
[1:23:13] dark
[1:23:14] she realized that time was getting short
[1:23:18] oh
[1:23:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:21] oh hallelujah
[1:23:23] the people knew it but she knew it more
[1:23:26] because she had a direct testimony
[1:23:28] from two witnesses who were sent to her
[1:23:31] at a point at a time of deliverance
[1:23:34] hallelujah this was her opportunity and
[1:23:37] she had to take it and i can't help but
[1:23:39] think that i was in a situation once
[1:23:42] i was like rahab once but then all of a
[1:23:44] sudden here come two messengers

[1:29:00] there was a longing in rehab's heart
[1:29:02] raham knew
[1:29:04] that in spite of the god that she had
[1:29:05] heard about
[1:29:07] she needed something from those men she

[1:29:39] there was something she required she
[1:29:41] knew that jericho was going to be
[1:29:42] destroyed

[1:41:10] only thing
[1:41:11] when i see the token i'll pass over you

[1:41:20] a token the blood was a token see the
[1:41:22] life

[1:41:25] that day you die and there had been a
[1:41:27] substitutionary life taken for the life
[1:41:29] of the believer
[1:41:30] god in mercy accepted a substitute for
[1:41:33] the life of the defiled person
[1:41:35] and when his child had defied himself
[1:41:37] with sin of disbelieving the word then
[1:41:39] god
[1:41:40] rich in mercy
[1:41:41] made a substitute
[1:41:43] and that was something that had to die
[1:41:46] in its place
[1:41:47] nothing else could work
[1:41:49] he said that's why canes apples and
[1:41:51] peaches and so forth
[1:41:53] it didn't work
[1:41:54] it had to be a life that had blood in it
[1:41:57] it had to be a literal life isn't that
[1:41:59] right to take place to take to take our
[1:42:01] place
[1:42:02] isn't that right he said and the life
[1:42:04] was gone from the sacrifice
[1:42:06] and now the blood was a token
[1:42:08] that god's order had been carried out
[1:42:11] now what did god require the life
[1:42:13] and the blood showed that there was a
[1:42:15] life gone
[1:42:16] so the blood was the token that the life
[1:42:18] had been given that something had to die
[1:42:21] god's requirements isn't that right that
[1:42:23] a life had been given and the blood had
[1:42:25] been shed and that blood stood for a
[1:42:28] token that the life was gone the life of
[1:42:29] the animals and so forth and so on isn't
[1:42:31] that right
[1:42:32] he goes on okay let me skip down here
[1:42:34] real quick i want to touch on this here

[1:42:40] hallelujah okay he said uh
[1:42:43] amen
[1:42:45] he said the blood was a token or
[1:42:46] identification
[1:42:48] the blood
[1:42:49] identified that the worshiper had slain
[1:42:51] the lamb
[1:42:52] and accepted the lamb and applied the
[1:42:55] token to himself
[1:42:56] and that he was not ashamed
[1:42:59] he didn't care who saw it
[1:43:01] he wanted everybody to see it
[1:43:04] and it was placed in such a position
[1:43:06] that everybody passing by
[1:43:09] could see that token
[1:43:11] oh hallelujah hallelujah and everybody
[1:43:13] could see rahab's token
[1:43:15] hanging out that window
[1:43:17] people might have laughed at her they

[1:43:22] about that she applied her token she did
[1:43:25] what call required of her
