summon upon my heart oh praise God we turn into the ancient landmark that the fathers have said there was something about history and about grandfather and great-grandfather and the fathers is it something about that hallelujah the old Tang ways the old pathways as well as Solomon escena preached holiest night in Ghana the old pathways it's something about that that is original no one awake wasn't a prophet he say he shall turn the hearts of the churn back to the face of the father's you can't go forward until you go back you have to pick up at the father's hat because what the father says original how about young people want to do the own thing and not taking advice or come from the father's the field father's old school well old school are moves more wisdom than new school yeah mathematics and an engineer and all kind of stuff but the fathers of the experience or chlorine of course of water bringing something new he bringing back what the father's had because far as our

though this wasn't the pastor's to be national ordinary believers you know what I Stella you not say my policy Paul said this ordinary believers busting them cut them buddy rosemary would challenge enough puzzles mighty man of God oh yeah let me hear what I in Chelsea cuz if that angel is saying what what what the prophets see that Angel has a Runyan Oh hallelujah got a presenter prophet to the generation for naught the Prophet is not another preacher another exhorter a kinda evangelist on a higher level that's not a professional approach this prophet we talking about here is one of these stars and the right hand of Almighty God and Allah knows that I'm little dialogue into our self and a half thousand oh it only has one star in every age and all of them seven stars in the right hand of God or guess I'll always shout so when their men speak then I speak any thoughts this weekend uh fear the Lord and we are resting on that we are resting under share the Lord we're not resting on a dream we're not wrestling or opinion we're not rest on your feeling we're not even resting on your prophecy because prophecies will fail but Buffy is a lot careful [Applause] [Music] [Applause] she said you helped my name I appreciate that like a menu for that I've seen your try them you see their puzzles and so forth from them last they don't cope with the word I appreciate all of that but it's something I got against you that is you left your first love but the Bible says charity covers a multitude of sins so when somebody running wrong it's awesome so I suppose this is one that no charity you try to see you better than that what caused the fire ICICI I am not like that man outside there you don't do this you I I doing this and I doing this you know and all that is great Lord you know between you and I how we does good on that man outside same Lord and I think waiter come in remember me Jesus said that man outside more righteous than that one that man is is closed I am don't you see money sponsored social but the man on the outside is more righteous so it sees a hot thing thanks my focus is Jakob Ammann or through my own hat Jake got no Japan went from the boot right Jacob not compromising but at that all he's a trickster for everything else we see that in Rome lead okay that that not that Matt nice a baptism of the Holy Ghost that is me rolling on his floor that is me carrying on that's me staggering like a drunk man don't play my back I want to be too holy and to be churchy I want to be a man I want to be in the spirit like John was under spirit I want a bill to move if the princess could move on you can move something wrong with you yes appreciate the dance and you get down something wrong with you mr. Shelton you can't shout something wrong with you because I leave in your show can I leave in your dancing I leave when you're praising my god the Saints of the come back to the first love for the old-fashioned type mittens for the Holy Ghost night mittens not dim nor taken meteors Holy Ghost Nathan you can always play back the tape and take all your nose home but your when you come here you're better come to worship I have been in convention by ministers don't wanna worship I won't do very say gonna stand up they don't want to praise the doornail but they're beatin the people to worship or give the Lord a show but we don't want to get split or water your boy split the water boy fire fire fire and the Manson put a little water away they know they'll fire man you real fireman is boss in the front you go in front with the fire hose jessamy fire or get the Lord a shout but I got a little warship I'm a cow worship I can't tell you they'll show to my cash out I can't tell if the priests quorum I can't praise God I have to be able to present my god told moses with all them others they all us and give God praise not a sista get the Lord a shoujo breath you men of God inside of here open your mouth I give [Applause] yes [Applause] [Music] maybe season as one of the baddest in Ghana when Abraham when a man was bought off of Isaac and the land was there he called the police you murderer is that God name if he call it and got appreciate what approve of his name has to go back IRA gotta be the name a spanner all them put is my inspiration reveal these seven company my Jehovah and God wrap it up in Jesus Christ these are banner these are healer these are love these are for either God [Applause] [Music] Jehovah all the old Jesus of the new by revelation of inspiration when things happened to prepare altar call a place pineal base of wrestle with God or Chloe the Gordon fellows name and things like Adam osmium intense portal Adam to name the animals and whatever Adam name was the name thereof I'm Adam a discernment and you have to have a resentment that will move on in a different cycle altogether they serve and the park is just Rises nothing the power go down okay the low - don't tell me no power come on now come on now no power going down not power going down [Applause] Libby season let's go this is gonna up boost my pretty good a long time yes straining all right here we go he said no something against you you left a full of you left that love that you once had for them good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meetings this is what I want to have dinner one stanza no see untuck the power prayer gonna drop a fasting on top of that to somebody see if he FRC with man oh yeah you know every way in there we going back to the land max dr. father's upset Paul talk about fasting often all that is part I didn't max I know the modern generation cattle from that do we know what I say some of them know we fastened again all right so you begin to kind of backside into that formal thing you know and people sit back and relax and they may be pastor bringing the bread and in manner and he have a stuff he what present a big creamy honey pulpit and he just pulled an old bread to and given her bread and bread it's an i precision let me say it again I do have a message on God said behold I send you the entire world Elijah the prophet and he will do something I like what he said that this you have to translate that when they say he he gone but he is his message as he conversion the people dismiss like we read something things Wednesday night about Ezekiel bone God brought Ezekiel to the valley a dry bone and such and these bones live question that's a scary thing you bring a man a bunch of bones the bones a team connected together only bones like bones little bones country and say can these bones live well in Ezekiel smart he didn't fresh and just run his mouth to say however live he said don't know it [Music] but but do you know then then because he can relax himself and say you know God tell them prophesy say unto these bones that you shall live I will cause breath to come into you watch breath commanded to be bones the de final product but it have a process to get the breath so when God say he shall turn the house of the churun back to the faith of the father's there's the process and how he will be back [Applause] so when God pronounced something over your life is the process to get to what is pronounced it doesn't change what he has pronounced let me give an example God pulled Samuel go to the house of Jesse and anoint me a king he didn't say boy he said King God seeing David mature on the throne God saw David King ship David is still a boy he had qualified to settle not shown yet but cause anoint him know he's anointed you have to go to the process to reach ready anointing us pleased him so going to pronounce things over you but then there's a process to get there in between where you are and where you are to be help me somebody where you are and where you're gonna be yes I'm the devil talking to you because you ready yet yep you're Irish dead yet but you're on your way [Applause] maybe seasoned guys I do whatever with one man saying because man didn't give the prophecy and I wouldn't let a man speak into my life who not authorized to speak in my life don't let nobody speak into your life what don't authorize to speak in their life they messed with the wrong thing into your life and they may happen to believe that person and that person could be a liar or God on a liar speak at their life and mess up you're like you don't want that you want the right person to speak into your life and that right word must be do must be the word that woman in the world what everybody telling she she did she that is talking about her she newspaper she invested oxygen whatsapp on Facebook all kind and stuff like that but Jesus was the one to speak into her life he's a woman if you know who speak to you you will ask me for water to drink under water I give you a spring up as a yeah everlasting life she said give me of that water or give me get the Lord a shout then she say he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so God always wanted to be personal and internal or Chloe does God let me say it again Paul always wanted to be personal and internal he never won no got to be a man he wanted the coordinates people or get the Lord a shout that man caught was Jesus word made flesh the multiply and bring on the sons or give the Lord a show you are not normal people you are sons and daughters of the Living God call to a higher order what about him says if God had that against this church he got it against that one too because you left your first love I've got it against you I've something against you that's my complaint you once had a great time you let the world begin to creep in you've got to act in a little formula you're still holding my name you're still doing things that is right you got a lot of patience and so forth your labor like a mule just labor and work you left grace and faith and power and swap it for labor and works I tell you about the banner I help every good woman I can that's a good thing I commend you for that but where is the first love he once had people said restore unto me the smile I once had no restore unto me the joy smile and joy is different things you could smile in your heart heavy has led but joy your car Hydra joy [Applause] never see a man will not run from it somebody get a gif of a new car and effects thanks you ever seen somebody get raised up really doing the p50 thanks not already talking that joy but Alessi had joy I will you think about that I know what smile and you know joy is joy have to be in your spirit joy have real joy is from within if that people who married and alive joy and the water that husband a long time to wonder life long time to get wife didn't happy because the CDs joy is not inside yet and they get the disappointment with this one and their behavior and the attitude and so on they get disappointed some people talk when

goodness baba says he wears them all night prohibitions on tears on your cheeks tears on your cheeks my goodness is the Bible even dusty and got cobwebs in it you read love stories and news and things the people who own more intuitive news number the Bible and the promises of God see and things that Orton the evening allowed to be published put out for the trash can and we Pentecostal people picked them up and just left over them like a bunch of flies and a garbage can he said what we need is back to our first love back to Pentecost and after FSS racy they lost the first love the next is a smiler and they were just gonna come from I'm built money bitterness root of bitterness coming into them this church the main church the big pat the majority name was hammering against the Holy Ghost ruling any church and they wanted to rule themselves they wanted to set up a priesthood they wanted to act by the Old Testament they wanted priests and how we classify ourselves we got our organization denomination standing class and we got grandchildren it's that then took in by adoption so forth we don't have business bad we don't have the old line of Pentecostals that used to die out and really come true with God that genuine feet so in those old days it wasn't complicated baptized and as a saint ain't a saint yet until that same preacher one prick true I'm window talk Amon don't casual prayer where you're listening to your own pray and listen to how your printer God not that you pray coming from your heart sign talk my name polish pray know and you know a clue you cutting or eating is going on to here and do you want water here you know but I had talking a mock win today God can come down on skipper you know he say you had too much teaching looking for new light like the problem in ethnicity people are too much at teaching and more teachers you know the Bible said they would be having itching ears because he prayers had died not just hard yes get them in the spirit that's hard listening to teachers and teaching like easy as long as you have a manatee our bringing some teaching how are they easy listen to him before God help you but when you understand this word is to become activated in your life call it wallet and the man or the teacher can activate it to you then your faith comes a little different because you recommend just to hear man you coming for the spirit to activate the way that the man is preaching you want that to come alive in your spirit in your heart in your soul so you reckon for later you come for a reality so I'm gonna skip skip a lot of stuff so it had left his first love leaving his first love of the word of God will reveal to us as haven't fallen from his own region which was Pentecost in plain English that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the religion of the Holy Spirit be control of the Spirit this was exactly what took place after Moses led Israel out of Egypt the way of God is to lead them by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance Merkel's and signs god-given wonders this was to be accomplished by God selected Gordon and Gord equipped sent men with the whole camp being dominated by a holy ghost move they rebelled they wanted a set of rules and creeps to go by and come like these people who don't have self-discipline to have in a discipline they like the pastors who could beat you whip on them because they need licks the comment Alain so the really kind of man that could put licks on them and then that the combative wallets it's almost like they're looking for abuse there's some people somehow they have a kind of sadistic thing about being abused but when you're motivated by love you care we have to come to church you can't wait to put you in other words because of the love for God you're serving God not because your father dragged inside here you're serving God because you love God if your father backside you are not gonna backslide if you're white backside you don't gonna backslide if your husband backs like you're not gonna backslide because of your love for God is not a man call you miss God call you is that man you serving as God your servant [Applause] did not serve in court because of the preacher because of God because of what he has done for you I believe in leadership but it's not watch watch watch but isn't but it's not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has set men in the church who men who are gifted by the Spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe also that the church is ruled by men that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the world so that is not men really ruling but it's the Spirit of God for the word and spirit is one that is why I bring the coat coat and top coat on this is how you know I could press play and play a tape for you you know those judges will be presently the pawn Baram tape and presently call empress amply on one message what am i started to do I must stick up how many different messages the hell - way I get this good show because not one message not one book so I have to hunt for these things I

hold and I was teaching that rulership my man was right so they could quote that scripture right it taught the beat that chills had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it God's Way this simply took authority invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between God and the people and they went right back to the old ironic system and I cor say you have one thing that I hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans every time you put a man like Mary or put a man between you and God a trouble it has to be you seeing that you have direct access it has to be you seeing now when you come to service every service that gets in a password and I use a name username as new the password is the word and it's given you the authority which is faith to approach God and pull down any blessing [Applause] so you kind of get on authorised Andrew you are authorized by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way to enter into

something that flash across to bring that thing to life the seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world so you are not now been recognized by God God put something in you and what in you is what responded to the gospel most times we can't even explain how we come to the Lord it's something move upon us something something told us we can't explain that something regardless if you're halfway a quarter way or no way a Backson that doesn't change that something inside of you it's still there I've taught many time woman of the well a condition though she was ill Fame door life was degraded she was in that condition because that traditions had never touched her and or when that light will struck her she recognized it and there was something there to respond and Moses was a born a prophet he was reasoning in the lecture school favors favors Paris Palace and so on Moses being born with this great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush to deliver gorgeous people you see what great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing and got a purpose in it and God got a purpose of you being here if you can only get to that place how much trouble you see if God on yourself - so stop talking why me and why me and why me stop that there's this foolishness I saved a whole of that trouble day right so stop that stop that why me and why I am this and how this happened to me stop that why I understand the shot just stop that that is foolishness God lack of a purpose behind it tell the devil stop it tell the devil don't bring back ever bring back that took you again you gonna get the will of God and the mind of God for why you are where you are how you are right now if God wanted me to be 16 years old no you were happy born long long after where I was born but one wanna mean he is I'm right now I can't wonder about young like a 16 years I'm not 16 years old I passed that hallelujah I'm heading down this way

here Oh hallelujah praise God Oh blow it up god I'll miss auntie every tico come back go have to eat or chlorine up gone or dentistry PA not none other side there be not dentist there there be no doctor there they had enough foot repair hun repair never repaired kidney repair there be no doctors over there trying to repair you across there the lamb will be the light or glory of God you're gonna sit down over your evil we are a grand time or get a lot some praises this gospel is real this cosplay is original we're not preaching fairytale maybe see that glory to God let's continue Moses born what notice the seal India with an intellectual conception this is the message right now see with all faiths he was born to delivers people it's inside no fear is the victory that overcomes the world and that citizen new to overcome everything that you have the overcoming yet I'm saying again the faith is already in you to overcome everything you have not overcome yet what has to happen in a watch so noses the Seelye india and when you when I'm preaching this you see you ever see yourself all right with an intellectual conception we'll all fit all with all the feet he was born to deliver his people and yet there we go it never come to life until that light from the Boonen bush flashed across it until he's seen not something he read about aha so they not read in a book no there's not readings for hold books now this is beyond readin know this is coming into a a reality that you know is God no man can't give you that no man can preach you that you got to encounter that okay the Lord a shout hallelujah what not something you read about but something is seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it and that bring the thing to life and I think a woman boy or girl I think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never have a false foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that would to a reality I warned that to be a burden upon your heart that you want that would to become a reality you know it is right you know it is true you know it is called speak it you know my button about the Prophet spoke it but you want beyond that you want the reality of it hallelujah so Thoth reality amen praise God so Moses know it intellectually the cedar was born in him was leaning his heart watch and he tried she was intellectual experience with the word like that but his intellectual today as an intellectual experience you could have with the word this is big to bring them all to deliver them knowing he was born for that purpose he note that time the scripture said on and so on and here the Prophet breaking you know we are coming to the rapture we have lived a time out at a time of the rapture is at hand we are looking for rapture and feet that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in and we see a chord that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God that can take a cancer that it Amanda shadow and raise him up and strong healthy man that ought to give rafter in feet T the people drop a bomb on you he said rapture and fate is leading a message but when you're translating that it has to have a manifestation of the deadly wisdom of a cancer case being corrected and that will give reference a to the people because the rapture is a glorified divine healing the rapture is your body being changed in a moment or twig of an eye and you have interfered that your body could be changed and when you see court to take a man from cancer debt and pull him back to life you could not go to change your body when you can see court to change humor and kidney trouble and diabetes and reverse back high blood pressure whatever it is you couldn't know about the change you transform you [Applause] so watch rough genfit leading the message but that's not just an intellectual quote to preach like not let the word let's continue oh my hallelujah so it's not just wrapped in feet missing so wrapped in faith Lane the message says the good part of it you would pass as a letter pad the man being raised on the floor dead man that's the manifestation pad the need boot good and spirit come on give the Lord a show some people have the knowledge of the world but they have no manifestation that brings the water life you have to want it you have to thirst for it you're not tasting from my word this is in for life let's continue could we take some more watch here Moses based on his great call upon the wood it was great this is big Moses base is called upon the wood until one day he met this light and the very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointed that anointed what he had in him that was on the inside I'm still reading so all this faith was on the inside what's the secret the word is in the bride and that's the secret is that outside the right is in the brain well that word in you has to be anointed [Applause] [Music] how could it be anointed when dynamics is the anointing for the word and the bride he said no other life could work in her so some Pentecostal anointed cannot you it will take dynamics itself that is not refreshing for you shall receive power when after the holy loss if I don't preach this how you will expect it how do I look for it if I don't preach this what you'll be looking for you have to know what you're looking for as a true believer you have to know what you're looking for you're looking for your portion you may be seated the mess is not complicated enough just show had two things to do take them over conquer the land and divide the line it's not no mathematics and rocket science cheating's take the people over you can't evaluate not conquered everybody in landing phase angle liquor she has to show them who's boss you have to show them that this

all that sadness just dissipate you know that but that don't even commute in the picture all of a sudden again super strict because fire will burn on your house and you nothing this hoax burden on businesses and God with priests or nose and nothing that so you look at the deal with that one time where there are certain things you have to divert one time because that terrible burner yells Thomas Amen somebody I will present to anybody at is morning [Applause] if we looking for apostolate blessings we have to expect apostolate conditions come on now come on a free pass away if we are looking for an apostolate Church I'm gonna have a postulate condition but the church has to be ready before they put lik some pizza on them the hata up room experience you may be seated when the Holy Ghost came on the upper room the devil thought that it was just excited and overexcited because he was not dear he didn't feel this pillar of fire he then see the pillar of fire he wasn't invited in the

prophet of Malachi for why we have a poll for that no Nora singing well that was so they sing they worship that come out starting up a room service finish then Peter born till you get caught beautiful and I see the man beckoned and Peter is a giver that whole keep spiritual for you when a stinking mean to keep money spread off of you you have to give see people who don't want to give that's problem you have to be able to give so Peter put his hand don't a give I when I reckon a pinion don't he do have and you can half way I don't you can't give way it will have some people do more to get the most energy they get they get greedy because they find that they have they don't want to give so they get tight and they get tight the pizza put his hands he says it's uncle I don't have number you know what I something happy the mini open room I don't let the same Peter denied Jesus I'm not the same man you see the same outside man right you know I didn't I am right but what I have you don't have what I have I could give what I have and power to give what I have I am anointed to give rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ listen that might have a leap and jump don't come the newspaper don't call me television cameras they taking pictures they printed it now his newest the whole a juicer and shook up because here is somebody of everybody knew was crippled he is walking and Jesus nothing wrong [Music] last time we heard about that Jesus was doing this thing But Here Come a disciple there come a son Jesus was a child of that day and they returned to the faith that Jesus had here come that faith manifested we all decide and we are turning back to the faith that the father's had you mean that same thing gonna happen but all that yes are you expressing it yes you expecting people the line downstairs coming up the church to replace all yes you expecting triple to walk yes blind to see yes get the demons up yes I am preaching my expectation [Music] wait on you expect miracles yes you may be seated where is the miracles I mean miracles I know I'm in the same God has turned water into wine you know one minute wine run out the next bit you have wine next minute you leave the best one for last that's a miracle we'll give the Lord a shout miracle miracle miracle or glory of God hallelujah my god a miracle in your life a miracle is coming to you today what a miracle is coming to you today Oh glory to God a miracle coming to you today we have a God is there miracles where the God is near miss Haynes we have a good as there is wonders Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus so we kind of expect God to come down to our level of thinking oh we cannot bring go bring down go to all I'll ever thinking we got a rise ourselves to his level of thinking and meet him on the grounds that he provided for us or glory to God so the scribes and Pharisees the Hutt's they had their Creed's they had their dogmas that their robes the long beard the long gong and the tall hats and there were the representative of Christianity or the law of that day because of the looks and the appearance and their dressing and so on people respected them Jesus had no long hacked had not look at nothing like them he was outside the system altogether and he busted them no listeners but about he said they had their Creed's Pharisees Sadducees Herodians what more all different forms and sexy religion each one had this his that he didn't believe in resurrection no angel or spirit the other one believed in boot resurrection angel and spirit one believe a certain way of washing hands the other way do it sucks in the day Christ could comment on sort of a thing like that but when he comes in his power of his resurrection Christ that is to make this this apart to make people live an act and behave themselves and to change the attitudes and to change their ways and to change their living they don't want nothing to do with that they want teachings they want doctrines they don't want something to influence their behavior and their life I am here not even on that and this is still the world where they say a man or not this is still the truth that's why people are comfortable to confess what they believe they feel proud so what they want to live just like they want to live they want to continue right on living the way they lived and yet be very religious and put the church and be a member there of they can go on a Sunday morning whatever time it is a 50 minute sermon walk with a pasta and walk away from there kind of half settles and go back to drift to be personally like Church okay I choose natural in this church II have this natural and cute spiritual so you can't believe every body is the body is actually naturally dr. spiritual you want to be Church spiritual Jacob was Church spiritual he was a scholar is a trickster but he was church spiritual Esau was a better man but he was just natural Oh glory to God since that battle man is what your hunger in for Jacob wanted he built right hallelujah and God said Jacob I loved Esau he alone let's continue Jesus brought caught the human lives Oh glory to God are you yelling at me no Jesus did what he brought God to human lives quad was made human when Jesus was born God became man that he might become fellowship with man and in men to do what to achieve one purpose to bring to man what God is not what a church is [Applause] so when somebody talking about more water church than a body would about Gordon are they off because Jesus had come to bring what church is he kind of resent what God is not what church is for what God is Jesus came that he might present God to man and man didn't want it and the Holy Spirit today like the manner to present God to man but the man wants to go to church it Jones his stinking he cannot fathom it we must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception this is not that you have a witness kingdom all we talking about the kingdom of God when John was preaching the kingdom of God is at hand is that hand up there yesterday yes a crazy statement a man seen I am the kingdom of God and I watching i watch in that character is silent about I am the kingdom of God and he seemed foolishness but I am the Holy Ghost or you go be the kingdom of God God are you ready is known by the new birth by the Holy Ghost not by any way and watch for the only way he reveals himself you are not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost the Bible said after Peter was saved and sanctified gave power to cast out unclean spirits to preach the gospel Jesus premier told him he was not converted until we see the Holy Ghost he said after you are converted striking the bredrin and Peter had a tree and ministry preaching of Jesus preached I was running Devils Peter was doing a lot of stuff along with Jesus and Peter Jesus Wallace after you converted shaking the bedroom Oh glory to God hallelujah originally some strength but your conversion coming the change coming Peter had the world open and he wasn't converted be the hadou he's under stalin open as he wasn't converted he got converted when the upper

claim to see the name on watch book which book some copy book the NCV same name or what book that John saw when John saw his name saw turns it all in heaven or it greatest thing you could get the create this revelation outside the revelation of Jesus Christ the greatest revelation you could get is your name is on that book when you know your name at no price I can rub it off no he cannot elder much trust in our church [Music] if you leave the church your name on the book Alleluia will leave this country your name still on the book if you hide in hell your stance terrible Oh give the Lord our show once you get a revelation on your name on that go that's it I don't know how I'm gonna get to reach me I want to reach Oh glory they're gone let's continue now the Holy Spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another so if one person is behaving another person behaving that one person whom is DeHaven I don't care what a teacher or their preaching or where they see him it's not the Holy Ghost and boot listen to how the Prophet brought here it will make each person come into its character because it's a spiritedly Jew it brings on makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to its nature like a brother see so now when you go buddy put on own accord to take that there's no funny talk Maria just because brother branham hard was to be tested with power oh look at the border punch God can give me a power because the behavior is so terrible they would cause a lot of trouble and confusion they would nickel in a bunch of myths that's what he have to with the character here it is brother Branham had power and got her to test him with the power I don't want to get far away room because God want to give him further so the people's are making love in church and he said go drop door and see if it's a blind if I said deaf whatever whatever you see you'll be done I said I forgive you with power to do that power to say what a brain he said I forgive you because he knew himself he saw himself he was authentic he was real he wasn't mechanical he was an intellectual he was for real and we have to become authentic real not mechanical original this is me I forgive you and the Holy Spirit pour out because husband was pleased he said the right thing Oh later on God told him my voice tongues and interpretation because thou has chosen this narrow path you have walked in your own chosen you have picked the precise and color decision it is mighty it's the hard way but he picked it he say you walked in your own chosen I didn't force you you choose to walk this Christian path where you choose the bloody footprints under sons of time you choose that hallelujah so watch it will bring you into its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject its nature the Holy Spirit makes you live and love to do it how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you and put a desire in you to follow him a thirst and a hunger for more of it just being yourself he brings realities who does that the Holy Spirit brings realities but a random said though in the early church they they have so much of the Holy Ghost and every opportunity they asking us for more more more when they beat them they come and say O God strictness and send give us more and they get that double portion they were filled with the Holy Ghost he said this age hardly have it and did not even asking for it but at early church the fathers and them or do only asking for more more Holy Ghost more Holy Ghost more power more love more witness and power Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God we believe it hallelujah when God place men here in the days of the Lord Jesus he give men a true roadmap to power to his power a roadmap is something that tells you where you were headed if you want to go and that's the way God wanted us to know he talked about he from California I've missed the time he could know where to go California I'm only driving time back and forth he said that's the way God want us to know his word we know it we have traveled it we have tested it we have tried it you know it leads to know his roadmap is his Bible the map is what there's not Google map or Apple map this is the Bible's a map this is a map to lead you to power or glory to God the Bible is the road map that leads to the power of God see it leads you to the power so seven thunders give faith to do what to lead you to the power and power produces the promise he said we need power so what's the word gets faith right unfit look the bottom there and right on top of it is one virtue and virtue is power that is what left Jesus right so the first thing God give you the revelation they give you faith and you expect with your feet know you move to put power hallelujah and willpower you could add the rest of the life because all these things are supernatural how many knows this is not natural you can make by a rainbow color clot undressing it does not it permitted inside of you that's a dress you're wearing so this is not at rainbow cloth the women in your fees and buy this seven color clothes and makeup a rainbow dress that's not working what you need is this inside of you it starts with feet feet is a revelation but you have to get power isn't that right power needs promise so okay now listen all right here was Baram says now Christ image of God reveal look Christ in you makes in the center of the revolution Christ life in you mix in the center of the revolution Christ and the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see is go what's God trying to do what is the new book name you say well but abandon what is in your book it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you oh this is a word the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you but that's not all next quote the new birth is an experience it's a gift of God it's the seal of your feet so if I preach new what is a revelation is a revelation is a revelation and don't tell you is also an experience you stock with revelation and you have no expectation for the experience the right question must be asked if you say in Revelation and experience the question is which one comes first then revelation comes first and experienced after boot is the truth the new boot is a revelation and the new virgin experience and you come right down the middle and you take both of them all glory to God you don't let nobody talk you out of experience hallelujah glory to God what you want is the revelation and the experience because faith is the substance of what you're hoping for you have to get experiences in reality but you have it by faith or give the Lord a shout Abraham at a revolution Isaac but he never saw Isaac for 25 years he hung in there with his revelation he could even show his wife the revelation he could talk it but he can show it it was inside of him and when it reveals to you it is yours or give the Lord a shout but is revealed to you it is yours Isaac was an Abraham Abraham knew it by revelation because Claude spoke to him or glory to God and that's what happened with Peter when Jesus the who do men say I am some say your distance to you that is who do you say I am he said Oh what the Christ then jesus said flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto you but my father or chlorine Accord that come from heaven that I come from text editors of Minister doctor from heaven and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell will never prevail against it so we are in a triumphant church this morning the Church of the ransom first born glory to God hallelujah because it's built upon the faith my god Rory hallelujah we have got a many many many men Oh Lord Jesus give them some praises people we are [Music] Alabam says Paul was dung in an actual rim with a specie he had intellectual feet he didn't have divine feet there's a quite a difference in me having an intellectual feet than a divine feet my Baptist friends feel to go on he said you get the intellectual feet by that but it must be a divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you and that just come out of the heart the intellectual faith is not enough good enough that's all right but only brings you but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is a personal experience of built a new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus he said Pentecost is an experience not an organization we experience Pentecost by the new bird now when I talk about panic when it's always hanger 1 if you visit Pentecostal they have no signs no wonders did we preach about the to join them if they do I feel first and I want is that is them your favorite I'm ready for the power of God I'm looking for the power every single service I'm under expectation for the power of God to come into the church that the minister came in center minister I have watched flying me up flat flat me out here and you on your own Oh glory to God hallelujah if you think I'm not looking for my portion I look my portion or glory to God you think I look like oh you think I look like my portion after the cross over the land and they fight and I still don't know and they come just welcome something like that kill em kill everyone it's a joke now Joshua you know you what Moses spoke about me Caleb a plain shy and bashful and saying look at who asking for something alone give me my Mountain I ain't no mo nobody else didn't my mom didn't know that tree chimes on today but if the Lord be with me then fellows sharp I shall be able to drive em out I could deal with that I

normalizes it down teman girl right - Pentecostal experience not an organization we experienced Pentecost by the new birth many constant experience that that a Methodist can have Baptist Catholic whosoever will can have a Pentecostal experience Oh glory to God why I say quad was God would will unfold in we must unfold as the Word of God on fools as times unfolds at science unfolds he said we are living in the last days we live in a time that God's great beautiful church ought to be standing on his feet shining like the lily of the valley well we are back there I belong to Presbyterian and Methodist and pretty girls around is that what it is grace we should be unfolding God's Spirit pouring out not just one little gosh' not one baptism baptism after baptism not a revelation or what revelation after revelation power after power glory after glory we ought to be this way up the road ready for translation so as we go forward we supposed to be unfolding revelation upon revelation power upon power glory upon glory where are we going to the translation we not going backward friends hallelujah all glory to God thank you lord hallelujah I'm still in the first minute I go second a minute I'm good so I could spend two two hours yeah so popular inside idea but one day I will run along you're lying Anna hallelujah no II think a plane and thing no I'll run it on in line you know alright let's continue you know the purpose of sending the Holy Ghost was for God to continue to a bunch of people to continually manifest God to the world that's not all not by a creed not by denomination but by the power of his resurrection by making his word real that is the purpose [Applause] sending the Holy Ghost do you see it down make it real by taking his promise by taking his promise and standing on this side of the minority which is where we are know and believe in God and watch the black skies move back and the power of God move in and take over so we define systems we define conditions we define we saying everything on side of the line we said this word is true there's going to be a super church there's gonna be a super race there's gonna be a power coming to the church and no coming in that the people restore be anointed that they're gonna speak the word we on our way to the rapture Oh glory to God hallelujah so watch sure the blood cell of Jesus came forth the Holy Ghost that had itself bombed up in the body called Jesus that blood sanctified away by feet to call the Redeem or the elected of God and when the Holy Spirit has taken all the meanness out of you he moves right in God himself to work his will no your meanness you have your behavior God and live in with that channel God come over some dynamite and some grenades and rip it off and blue

was sittin in pieces hat so when they lie in church he sayin he lied to me you like the Holy Ghost they fail to understand the Holy Ghost is operating in that man if you want to go back to his mind for some feeling that is your business but you'll be judged because Gorda have no lion coming inside a church you'll have a glorious church without spot or wrinkle that's the purpose of sending this message to have you right and a church that the devil car deceiver because this pie will not be like Eve this guy could be a different right altogether this rival your would break this bribery will

touched of the blessing what God blesses blessed call wordless anyone who will go back to the old landmark of the Bible and start from the Bible a lot of people know what but a balance a but I don't know what the Bible say what would happen I'm can reveal what the Bible say because this book was sealed there's Daniel Seco die wait Daniel to book a seal till the time of the end so the revelation of seven seals was to reveal the Bible so we have the authority to go back to the Bible back to the world back to the landmark that a file have set on the day of Pentecost they set it a certain way are we going back to that they had prayer dad fasting that crying that signed at prayer meetin they had all things in common nobody was Contin among them Oh glory to God and everything common

more gonna get back a church that he's gonna be proud of hallelujah a church he'll be proud identify himself with God the Bible studies when there were few you very few he suffer no man to do them

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] call her blessed anyone who will go back to the old landmark of the Bible and staff from the Bible not according to theology not some man meteorology but the troop ideology start from the old landmark and move up and core will move with you and I know if we in this church start with the old landmark that the fathers have set go go - move it us I will never leave you nor forsake you the Lord Himself went everywhere with them what's the proof what's the proof confirming the word to our show - knows let Israel give a show this is that we tryna thing is that we try something the Lord Himself went everywhere with them let me see them alright David say why why do hidden rage and the people imagine a vain thing they say where is your God where is your God what godless Aware's of God we going to prove that God hallelujah the core of Malachi 4 lives he said behold i send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers we're going to prove the fate of the father's has been restored that's the only way we could prove and confirm malachi 4:2 this world right now by going back to the face of the father's and pick it up what they had [Music] [Applause] no man could come no and explain to me this message I've outrun him hallelujah there's nothing in this world he could come and explain me now he's supposed to what I don't know what I want is the promise what I want in this power to produce the promise the promise is the Holy Ghost the promises that come upon you the fire come upon the bride Oh glory to God hallelujah some looking for when the press come don't look pretty press some looking for that we write home to pursue your group you'll be killed so I know look at my honda particular group when that time comes I will deal with it when the press come I will deal with it but my Bible tell me you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you and faith was given to pull down the Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost that was bombed by the ruler Freddy's this will be loosed by the evening time message to bring back God among the people because the world was invisible until the world became flesh and they confirmed the word become flesh omnipotence must speak and to confirm omnipotence being spoken the miraculous must act this player show the nose you can't tell me God is weakened and there is no miraculous because my omnipotence me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh aah go begin the bless he was a fatty and the first thing you know he began to push for him and he built up garrison so that all these uncircumcised could not come in that's what the church needs today is a garrison of the old-time apostolate teaching so this lukewarm formal in and out up and down doesn't get into our church one time I was wondering if they think anybody initiation a material testimony in the early years I had no interest whatsoever in anybody from any church and equipping this message because the behaviors was so horrible the ministers was teaching some crazy stuff I'm manipulating and controlling people's lives that I pledged to God I wouldn't do that I made a pledge to God and to this day I kept that pledge so he went on the fields in my arrow different places I saw a preacher sinners and win them to the Lord I didn't want nothing to do with their people out there
