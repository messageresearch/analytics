Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence this morning and we pray that you come down in a special way and have the preeminences and speak to our hearts. We are waiting upon you, Lord. We are waiting for a special touch from you, Father. We're not looking to man. You said, "Ask of me." And we come to ask of you this morning for healing, for deliverance, for breakthrough, for restoration, for forgiveness of sins, from cleansing of all unrighteousness, breaking the bands of wickedness, breaking the bands of evil, breaking the bands of unclean spirits.

[Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Glory. [Music] Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Jason, for the song service atmosphere we in. Amen. Praise the Lord. [Music] You know, Brother Isaac spoke some time ago, my brother Norris church about finding faith in the time of storm. And it's amazing the words that Jesus told them amidst the storm. He tell them, "Be of good cheer." And the hardest thing to find cheer is when you're going through the rough spot. When things are all cloudy, when things are dark and your home boat, financial boat, whatever boat is rocking, marital boat, health boat, whatever boat you're in, and it is shaking and rocking and Jesus come and say, "Be of good cheer." &gt;&gt; And your face is hard like a rock. You say, "No, Jesus, I can't share." But he said, &gt;&gt; "Be of good cheer." &gt;&gt; So, it's not you, it's what he said. At some point of in time, we have to begin to listen to what he said, &gt;&gt; not what you feel. People feeling too much. A feeling and a feeling. A feel. Stop feeling. &gt;&gt; Find out what God said &gt;&gt; and start to believe what God said &gt;&gt; because God is not a man that would lie. Your husband will lie to you. Your wife would lie. Your children will lie. Parents will lie. The boss will lie. But God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; Whatever God speaks, it got to come to pass. It must come to pass. If God say he'll heal you, he will heal you. If God say deliver you, he will deliver you. If God say will cast that devil out of you, that devil is on his way out. If God say going to multiply and add to you, he going to multiply and add to you. Because God is God. He's not your uncle. Praise God. Not your father or mother. He is God Almighty. And he cannot make a promise that he cannot keep. He is big enough to make the promise. He is big enough to keep it. And we big enough to say, "God, you said it and I believe it." And that settles it. You may be seated. So we believe that uh it's a special day today and a special time and we just under great expectation to see what the Lord will do and it's up to you, you know, &gt;&gt; to have that expectation. The preacher cannot do it. In the exhortation in the Zoom prayer meeting on Friday, I read about blind batimus. It's always a thrill for me to read that scripture, that text about blind Batimus. He was on one street begging and somebody tell him Jesus on the other side. So have mercy upon me. They say he can't he can't hear you. That didn't stop him. That when you're desperate, &gt;&gt; when you're you see some people, they're too comfort in their sickness. They're too comfortable in their disease. They're too comfortable in the way of life. They're too comfortable inside of that. &gt;&gt; Have mercy upon me. They say keep quiet. He start to make a lot of noise. So much noise that that noise, that emotion, that faith went up to heaven and stopped Jesus. Something come down and stopped Jesus and Jesus sent for him. &gt;&gt; Everybody know the man blind. You could see that &gt;&gt; he's a blind man. &gt;&gt; And look at Jesus words. What would you have me to do for you? If you're a diseascal, you will say, "Yes, he blind. [Music] But that is not the response Jesus wants. &gt;&gt; He wants you to speak. &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, that I might have my sight." &gt;&gt; You have to speak what you want. Whether for yourself, for your husband, for your wife, for your children, for your marriage, for your family, for whatever it is, you have to express and have a desire in your heart that God will answer your prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. That man received his sight because he asked for it. &gt;&gt; Jesus carried your mind. Is your mouth he want to hear? &gt;&gt; Because he sure if the man want his sight, he could want to win the lotto. &gt;&gt; He could want more money. &gt;&gt; He could want a white house, a big house. He want a swimming pool. He just don't know what he wants. So he's not assuming anything. He want to hear from you. &gt;&gt; May he hear from you this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Somebody through it all. True it all. True and all. True all to trust in Jesus. I learn to trust in God. Oh, through it all. Through it all. Hallelujah. I've learned to depend what is good. Yes, this morning. I thank God for the mountains. Thank God for the valleys. I thank God for the trials I've been through. [Music] If I never had a problem, I never knew that God could solve them. I never knew what thing this world can do. But hallelujah, true. [Music] Hallelujah. Well, I learn to trust in Jesus. I learn to trust in God. Oh, true. My Lord, my Lord, I've learned the word of his word. This morning, I want to call to the prophet to greet you all. Andrew Lulen from Living Word Healing and Deliverance Tabernacle. But Andrew, could you come and read the believers? Amen. Praise God. He's here with us this morning. Learn to trust in Jesus. Well, learn to trust in God. Oh, through it all. Through it all. I learn to depend on his word. [Music] Praise him. Thank God this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; I give God thanks to be here. My wife is just across here. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I forget his wife is here. God bless you, sister. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise him. I I I I just want to greet you and let you know that we serve a God of signs, wonders, and miracles. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, and miracles. &gt;&gt; And as a old Pentecostal sisters used to tell me, when you're down to nothing, God is up to something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And just yesterday, I was looking at the the sometime we we we read things in the scripture, but we don't understand the magnitude of the miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just read it now. Now for God to for Hezekiah say for God to turn for the clock to go forward is no problem because everything is going forward. &gt;&gt; Hezekiah say I want it to go backward. So you say I want it to go backward 10° and 10° is 40 minutes. Okay. One degree is 4 minutes. 10 degrees is 40 minutes. Okay, forget about the calculation. But just trust me. One degree is 4 minutes. 10 is 40 minutes. And that is not enough. Joshua said, "Well, Lord, just let it hold on. So time stop." &gt;&gt; That's the God we serving. &gt;&gt; Okay? And and if you never experience a miracle, today could be your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Today could be your day. And by by the grace of God, I've I've had many miracles in my life. There was a time when I couldn't walk. They used to carry me around in a in a little trolley, the little box cart or something. &gt;&gt; And as a little boy in eight, nine years, I believe in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. because I I I know what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; And I holding on to God until God raised me up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Signs, wonders, miracles. &gt;&gt; The the the the the prophet said the song that the angel loved to hear was only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Only believe all things are possible. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just want to let you know that God knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God feels the pain. He knows what you're going through. But he just says, "Just ask me. &gt;&gt; Just ask me." &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, do it today." &gt;&gt; Amen. So we talk about this Godself is a real God. &gt;&gt; He's a God of miracles. &gt;&gt; I can't go into all the different testimonies, but I just give you a little thing. Okay? &gt;&gt; God, the God of miracles. And today I want to say that I want to stand like Caleb here and say Joshua give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is it wasn't a matter if you want to give me no give me &gt;&gt; handmade. It belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I and you you today I believe you today sometime we we we we rub ourselves &gt;&gt; we sell ourselves short. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You tell that devil give me my son. &gt;&gt; Give me my daughter today. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Not tomorrow. Tomorrow could be too late. &gt;&gt; Today. Today is my day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he he he praise him. You know pastor pastor Theo talk about blind Batamus. &gt;&gt; Batimus. And you know what Batimus said in his heart? The Bible say and he casting away his garment. &gt;&gt; He casting away his garment. Ran to Jesus. Now that garment was the beggy garment that he had. He was saying today is my last day for begging. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise him. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he said I am going to receive my sight today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "For she said in her heart, not a mind. Faith bypasses the mind and human intellect and gets down in the spirit." He said, "Today, if I could only touch him, I shall be made whole. Forget the crowd. Forget the who pushing to anywhere I could pass. I passing but I'm going to touch and I shall be made whole. &gt;&gt; Praise him. &gt;&gt; Praise him. Praise him. &gt;&gt; Friends, today this God we serving is real. &gt;&gt; This is not a religion. &gt;&gt; This is not like the others. Amen. &gt;&gt; This God that we are serving is a God of signs. Keep it in your mind. Wonders and miracles. &gt;&gt; Praise him. That's the God we serving. For too long, the devil's back up the church in a corner. Back us up in a corner. And and and and with intimidation. &gt;&gt; It's time we step out like David and said, "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that defy the army of the Lord that defy the Holy Ghost that defy the power of miracles?" &gt;&gt; Oh, praise him this morning. &gt;&gt; So, I believe I'm trusting God to do great things among us. I want you to once you could believe for it, &gt;&gt; you will receive it now. Once you could believe, &gt;&gt; forget what's what's around you. Forget what's around you. Peter said, "Lord, uh, let me come." And Peter started to walk. &gt;&gt; But what happened? He went back into the reasoning and and the seeing and the senses and then he he he begin to doubt &gt;&gt; and the Bible say begin to sink. But even if you sink in, cry out. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, help me. Help thou my unbelief. [Applause] Cry." [Applause] &gt;&gt; And as the song as the song says, he is there all the time. &gt;&gt; He never leave us. He listen as brother Tio says and I always say it when God says something he said the word that I speak unto you shall not return unto me void. It shall accomplish that which he was sent to do and prosper in the think which I sent it. And as the word of God comes so much word is coming from this pullpit friends. We ought to prosper in that word. That worship was to change us from from from into his image, &gt;&gt; from faith to belly kindness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That word supposed to change us from faith to belly kindness. &gt;&gt; So that God could come down and seal off our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. And say, "This is my son." Hallelujah. Hear him. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise him. I thank God for the little opportunity. I give God thanks. I pray that these word would store your faith and and and and and raise you up inside. &gt;&gt; Raise up that lion inside of you. &gt;&gt; Raise up that warrior spirit inside of you. Hallelujah. Say, I am ready to fight again. 85 years old. I'm strong just like what when I was 40 years ago. have strong to go out and slay them giants. Oh, praise him. Thank you. God bless you. Hallelujah. [Music] That's all of them. [Music] He's there all the time. [Music] I know that he's there all the time. Oh, when it seems like my trles, I'm more you can bear. I know that he's there all the time. So brother Isaac will come to the pulpit this morning and speak to you Jesus. [Music] He's there all all the time. But when it seems like it seems like all your trouble, what the trouble they are more than you can. Hallelujah. I know that he's there. Hallelujah. Oh, [Music] can we sing it one more time all over the building? Oh, he's there. Oh my glory. [Music] He's there all [Music] [Applause] you can. I know I'm leaving there all the time. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise this morning? Bless his name. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning? You appreciate his presence. You appreciate his love. You appreciate his grace. You appreciate his mercy. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is the great shepherd. He's the great I am. He is the way. He is the truth. He is the light this morning. There's no sickness that can stand in his presence. There's no problem that can stand in his presence. There's no situation that he's not big enough to handle this morning. Can we give him the Lord a hand of praise? Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. You appreciate the Lord this morning. You appreciate the atmosphere. Amen. and blessed be the name of the Lord. Well, it's certainly great to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Uh to be in his presence and to be able to have this service together one more time. So, while you're standing, we can go straight to the word. I greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ. I want to read from three portions of scripture. I want to read from Romans 8, Romans 9, and from Hebrews 12 this morning by the grace of God. Reading Romans 8, reading from verse 28, a very familiar passage of scripture. And we know that all things work together for good. To them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that we might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them, he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. A reading Romans 9 and reading from verse 10. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works, but of him that calleth. And our last scripture reading from Hebrews, Hebrews uh 12, reading from verse 15. looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled, lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance. Listen carefully here. Though he sought it carefully with tears. I want to read this one more time. This last verse. For you know how that afterward when he realized his mistake. When he realized what he had done, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected. For he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. Can we bow our heads for the reading of uh for uh for bow our heads for the blessing of the word. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before your throne this morning, your throne of grace, your throne of mercy. Lord, we are so humbled to be in your presence on this Sunday morning. Lord, the psalmist David said, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into your house." And Lord, we come to this special service, Lord, on this independence day. This day our nation celebrates another year of independence, Lord. And Father, we are here to also declare our independence from the works of darkness. We are here to depend, Lord, to declare our independence for Lord, from our past and our failures and our mistakes and our doubts and our fears, Father. So Lord, we could step boldly, Lord, not only into your presence, Father, but into the promises of God and our inheritance that by right we have access to this morning. Any man could read the scriptures, but it takes the Holy Spirit to breathe life upon your people. So may you walk out the pages of the Bible and Lord, may you have the preeminence in the service this morning. We give it over to you. May you take me out of the way and speak lip to air to your people in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord. this morning. It's certainly a great privilege to see you all here and spending time among the things of God. There's no better place to be. So, I greet you one more time in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And I I know I haven't been here for a few services two weeks ago and I would have I think greeted in the Bible study. Um but greetings from France and we had a tremendous time in the in the meeting in France and certainly the Lord is blessing. And then uh how many appreciate the song service this morning? Brother Jason, God bless you. Certainly blessed. And then the special, how many you appreciate the special? Amen. And uh that special is from last Sunday where a small group of us would have uh been at Mispa Tabernacle to minister the word. And we thank God for his grace and his love. And uh it's certainly great to be called in such a time as this. You know, there's nothing that we could claim to have done on our own. There's nothing we could have achieved through works or effort. But it's the grace of God. We are all here trophies of the grace of almighty God. And that should take away all the pride. Take away all how we feel because God is the one who brought us all here. We didn't choose ourselves. We didn't bring ourselves. We didn't wake ourselves up this morning. I've said many times you take an alarm clock and put it in a morg. Nobody will wake up because it's not the alarm clock wake you up. But if God wake you up this morning, it's because there's still a purpose upon your life. Brother Brandon said when God is finished with you, then he could take you home. But the fact that you are here means God is not finished with you yet. And that is enough of a reason to shout. That's enough of a reason to praise God. God is not done with me yet. I'm not what I used to be. I'm not what I'm supposed to be. When I look back at the journey, I could see the Lord has been keeping me all the time. And it's been the Lord preserving me all the time. And the sovereign God we serve is more than able to pick you. You are here because God picked you. You didn't pick him. He picked you. And God is not now choosing. God is not waking up this morning and saying, "I pick you. I pick you." His fornowledge picked you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He predestinated you before you were here. You heard the scripture we read before Jacob and Esau were even born. Hallelujah. He said, "Jacob, I love Esau. I hate a decision was already made before they even did good or evil." So, you don't you think you're here by accident? Oh, somebody may have invited you, but you had no choice to be here this morning. You had no other place to go. Every other thing you try to do will have fallen down because God wanted you here this morning. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; You've got to be excited about your future. There's nothing you can do to change your past, but God holds your future. You are not holding it yourself. And I want to encourage you that the glory that's ahead of you is greater than anything you have ever experienced. The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. We are on our way to the rapture. We on our way to the resurrection. We on our way to the wedding supper. You on your way to your healing. Brother said, "How could you have faith for a rapture if you can't even have faith for divine healing?" You heard what brother Andrew said. Miracles belong to you. It's part of your heritage. It's part of your inheritance. If you're sick today, today you shall be healed. Hallelujah. Today your day for miracles. Today is your day for a transformation. You shall not leave the same way you came today. Can the church say amen? Glory to God. I'm just trying to get through my greeting to share a few words with you this morning by the grace of God. But I'm excited because God is in the deliverance business. He's in the resurrection business. He's in the mercy business. I'm not going to be too long with you. We have a lot happening today, but tomorrow is a public holiday. So you have to forgive me. We don't get much days like this where the next day is a public holiday. It's a independence day. So we breaking free. But the Brandon say when you lift your hands, you defy the laws of gravity. When you stand up, you defy the laws of nature because the world wants to keep you down. But little lily, press your way. Press your way into your inheritance. Press your way into your promise of God. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before we go further, let me just make it very clear. There is nothing you could do yesterday. &gt;&gt; There is nothing. The pastor said to say it again. When the pastor tell you There is nothing you could do about yesterday. It's gone. It's finished. But today is a new day. Watch out, devil. The moment the bride gets to know who she is, then the rapture could go. The greatest trick the devil tries to play on you is that you make this mistake and you're not worthy and you can't be counted. But I've got news for the devil. If God could take Jacob, who made all of his mistakes, if God could take Jacob, who was a shy, and say, "I love this man because I put his name on the book." Hallelujah. Before he made a mistake, his name was there. Before he fell, his name was there. Before he committed a sin, his name was there. That's why Jesus could tell the disciples, don't rejoice because you have power. But rejoice because your names are written. And if your name is not written in those stands, but if your name is written, oh, there's no devil in hell. There's no sickness. There's no principality. There's no power. There's nothing present. There's nothing past. There's nothing to come that could stop you from coming into your inheritance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are not crazy. This is joy unspeakable and full of glory. That's why when John saw his name, he said, "All in heaven, all on the earth, all under the earth heard him praising God because he got a revelation." You may be seated for a minute. Many people come to church and they don't have a revelation. They have information. They have knowledge. They have they see things. But when you get a revelation, you forget who's next to you. You forget who's behind you. You forget who's in the front of you. You forget around in your workplace, you praising God. You in your home, you praising God. Situations come and the stuff that used to bother you, they don't affect you anymore because you are anchored. Anchored in the word, anchored in the Lord because it's a revelation. It's revealed to you. You didn't get it from the pastor. You didn't get it from the minister. You didn't get from the deacon or the elder. But it's the Lord himself make himself known to you. That's why overnight you could see somebody change. Don't write off anybody. &gt;&gt; Don't write off anybody. In 5 minutes in the presence of God, God could raise up an apostle. Raise up a pastor. Take a wife who has been struggling. And in 5 minutes, she's changed. You can't judge it. God could say, "I love Jacob." Because he was not going to be Jacob all the time. He was going to become Israel. Oh, come on now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jacob was not going to stay Jacob. Hallelujah. Saul was not going to save Saul. Saul was going to come Paul. Is the power of transformation. And we are here to be transformed. We are here to be changed. We are here to be encouraged. We are here to recognize that this world is finished. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we are happy this morning &gt;&gt; and today by the grace of God we have a few things happening after the service. There are few situations we want to pray for and this is why we want to reinforce the faith &gt;&gt; and the conviction that God is real and that he's a healer. So we want to pray for some of the sick among us. And after that, we will pray for the school children going back out to school because all hell is against them. &gt;&gt; The lid of hell is uncovered. The prophet told us streams of demon powers, 200,000,000 devils. They're not loose against the world. They're loose against this end time bride. Loose against those who are trying to do something different. &gt;&gt; So, we want to fortify our young people with prayer. And then after that, we want to acknowledge those from the Sunday school program by the grace of God so that um we could really celebrate because friends, you have to know what ground you're standing on to be able to defend yourself. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was being tested in the wilderness, he could say, "It is written. It is written. It is also written." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Well, I think is this and I hope is this and my mother had told me some story and it was a phrase and the old people used to say this. It wasn't that it was it is written. It is written. It is also written. So his faith could have rested on the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you have to know in scripture why we do what we do and why we cannot do certain things. Because you are a royal priesthood. And because you are royal priesthood, there are things you can do and there are things you cannot do. Not that because God is restrictive, but because you are royalty. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Because you are royalty. There are conditions and parameters within which you could operate. In France, I shared with them that President Trump got a Tesla and he couldn't drive it. Why? Because the Secret Service policy is the president of the United States car in a car accident. Could could you imagine the headline the president drive and bomb something that they cannot allow for that to happen. So even if you gift him a car, he's not allowed to drive it. Not be. So imagine all the power the president has and the things he cannot do because the office requires a certain behavior, a certain conduct in the office. You ever see the queen of England drive a car? You wouldn't see it because you have trained drivers for that because of who she is. What do you think about you? I ain't telling you not to drive or no. I ain't saying don't drive. I'm just saying you are royalty. And because you are royalty, there are things that are allowed, there are things that are not allowed. There are things you could do and there things you cannot do. So don't feel bad when the world challenges how you dress and how you walk and how you speak. You are royalty. Your father is the king. Hallelujah. And you are born into a royal family. And because of this, your conduct is a certain way. That's why you could never come to the house of God looking sad and depressed because you know who your father is. Somebody preach back to me this morning. I'm not going to be too long with you. I'm but just making sure the temperature is right because I want to, you know, go bless Andrew. God bless you to you and your wife. So happy to have you here with us. You appreciate brother Andrew and his greetings to the church and he will join us in praying for some of the sick cases after the service as well. So this morning by the grace of God for a little encouragement to the church I have a title do not sell your birthright. &gt;&gt; Do not sell your birthright. &gt;&gt; And it's an inspiration the mystery of why God hated Esau. The mystery of why God hated Esau. I would have preached this as the mystery of go of why God hated Esau last week, but I wanted to bring it along a similar line, but also a bit different this morning along the lines of do not sell your birthight. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, let's get into it. The Bible said that in Proverbs 6:16, these six things that the Lord hate. The word hate is a powerful word. It's not dislike. It's not it bothers you. Hate is a strong word. These six things do the Lord hate. &gt;&gt; So if these things are found in us, it actually raises the hatred of God. &gt;&gt; And that's a very harsh or tough thing to one say and two to accept because we see God as love. &gt;&gt; We see God as mercy. We see all this side of God. But then there's a side of God where God can say, "I hate certain things." &gt;&gt; What are they? He says, "Yay, seven are an abomination unto him." A proud look. &gt;&gt; So it don't even mean the pride is manifest. It's just the look. &gt;&gt; You know, people who look proud, the moment you start to look proud, God start to hate it. &gt;&gt; This is why as a believer, we could never look proud because there's nothing we could have ever done. And you can't judge nobody because the grace of God, mercy. If you ever experience mercy and grace, this is why God has to allow so many of us to fall and fail and scattle on the ground so we can recognize there's nothing to be proud about. It is just the grace of almighty God. Can the church say amen? The moment we start to feel that it's us and you achieve and you do and God has a problem with it and we see it in scripture, God has an agenda against pride. &gt;&gt; So you can't be proud. Well, I proud of my car. I'm proud of my job. I got a degree. I'm proud of this. I'm proud of my testimony. Once the word pride gets injected in there because there's a look in there. You don't even have to say the word. You just look at you just come out the cast. You have a certain look. &gt;&gt; God hates it. And we're going to get a bit more into it. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; He hates a proud look. He hates a lying tongue. &gt;&gt; Hands that shed innocent blood and heart that devisth wicked imaginations. feet that be swift in running to mischief. &gt;&gt; The feet not swift to run in church, &gt;&gt; but where mischief is, they're looking for it and soon they see it. &gt;&gt; They're quick to run to mischief. &gt;&gt; This is the Bible says, "Don't hate. Don't shoot the messenger." &gt;&gt; Don't shoot the me. I'm just the messenger this morning. &gt;&gt; A false witness that speaketh lies and he that sweth discord among brethren. So these brother Clarence are the things that God hate. &gt;&gt; We know through the word God says things that he hate the deeds of the &gt;&gt; nicolatans. &gt;&gt; We understand these things but through scripture from Genesis to Revelation there's only one man that God say I hate that man. &gt;&gt; And that's a powerful statement to make to hate one man. &gt;&gt; So we have to begin to understand and we do it in the scripture and we're going to get a bit into it. Let me just switch my notes here. Wonderful. So as a background, we know that God started this whole foundation after man fell and all this stuff. He started a build on a foundation of faith and he called Abraham. He say leave your family, leave your background, leave your tribe, leave your nation and come follow me. And Abraham by revelation begin to seek a city whose build land maker was God. He wasn't looking for an earthly city. He was looking with the heavenly city built by the divine architect. There was a revelation in him that moved him forward. And as God began to deal with Abraham like he deals with many of us, we begin to see, wait a minute, Lord, I seeing this, I see this. And Abraham said to say, "Well, Lord, you're talking about I'm blessed, but see here, I have no children." So God say, "You have talk. No problem. Come go outside and count the stars." &gt;&gt; And Abraham began to count 1 2 3. And then he said, "I'll run out of numbers." He say, "Wait, you you're done. Count, so shall thy be. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And out of Abraham, God visited him. We know all of this. I'm building it a foundation. And through the baronness of Sarah, who could have no seed, Abraham had transformation of his own body being an old man. And Sarah, who was not only barren, but old, the angel come and do a work upon them, and they end up with Isaac, the seed of the promise, the son of the promise. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Just like his father, Isaac's wife, Rebecca, was also barren. &gt;&gt; And they went to the Lord. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And the Lord say, "Okay, I'm going to bless you." But within Rebecca, there was a war taking place. &gt;&gt; And she began to question the Lord and say, "Well, Lord, how come this thing have a war in me even though is your blessing?" Because she knew it was a miracle. And many times we ask God for something, but within the blessing, within what we asked for, within God giving us something, there's a war in there. Can the church say amen? And God told Rebecca in Genesis 25:23, "And the Lord said unto God, two nations are in thy womb, &gt;&gt; and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall be stronger than the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger." So even while they were in her womb, there was a war taking place. Jacob on Esau was fighting in the womb. &gt;&gt; There was a war in them. But the man says, "We have two natures in you fighting every day. There's a war in all of us. There's a war telling you go back. Go back to the world. And there's something in you saying keep on fighting. There's a voice saying you can make it and there's a voice saying you're not going to make it. And with the Brandom said whichever one you feed is the one that's going to take you where you need to go. You I'm preaching to you this morning. Right. So within Rebecca, Rebecca is also in that context a type of all of us. There's a if God is with me, why I having problem? That's what she was saying. But Lord, you abused you are the one give me the the child &gt;&gt; and within her is an issue and but that's how God will be because God is unfolding something. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And we know when the child Esau was born, he was red. He was hairy and that's how we got the name Esau. And then Jacob came also. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And as the boys grew, the Bible said Esau was a cunning hunter. He was a wise man. He was a man's man. He was a man of the field. And Jacob was a simple man dwelling in the tent almost like a mama's boy. And the Bible said that that that that Rebecca loved Jacob. But Isaac loved Esau. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of this we should know from Sunday school, right? &gt;&gt; This is why Sunday school. What if you don't know this? We need to do some more work. &gt;&gt; This is foundational stuff. Abraham, then Isaac, and then Jacob and Isra. So we are talking about Abraham's grandchildren. &gt;&gt; And we are talking about the fact that they grew up in church. It grew up in the message. It grew up in the belief. Can the church say amen? But within there, we see one line going after truth and one line going the wrong way. &gt;&gt; And we see it today in the church. There are those going along the truth and there are those going the wrong way. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Let's build a little bit. So in Genesis 25 29 the Bible said and Jacob saw pottage so he cooked he's a man of the house so he cooking a a nice meal and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee from that same red pottage for I am faint and therefore his name was called Edom. Now, I want us to notice something, friends, before we go further. To this point, there was nothing you could pick against Esau. There's nothing in scripture to say Esau had an issue. And I want to go back to the Bible study on King Saul. Many people think man is who picked King Saul. &gt;&gt; God is the one who picked King Saul. &gt;&gt; God told Samuel, "They didn't reject you. They rejected me. But I will choose." Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God makes a choice, he has an expectation of that choice. &gt;&gt; We read in the Bible study, Saul was hiding. This big big tall man hiding. They had to ask the Lord, "Lord, you sure you here?" He say, "Well, look him over there." &gt;&gt; Because he wasn't a man trying to be in the front and show and and say, "Look at me and my muscles." And no, he was a man who was not even interested in the position. &gt;&gt; So, what we have here is a situation of people who starting off good. Both Saul and Esau start off good &gt;&gt; to this point. There's no issue you could have against Esau. Let's go. &gt;&gt; And Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy birthright." Now, this is an offer. In other words, is a choice. If somebody say, "Sell me your pen. Sell me your phone." What? You could say, "No." &gt;&gt; You could say, "No, I'm not selling it." In other words, this thing is too important to me to sell. This thing is so valuable. This watch I have here is my grandfather watch because this is the birthright we talking about. This is the birthright. Can is anybody in the house here? What is this birthright we talking about? But Brandon said it's the Holy Ghost. And we're going to read more about it. But the reality is this church. This was all that God gave to Abraham. Can the church say amen was wrapped up into something called his birthright &gt;&gt; and Abraham had passed it on to Isaac. So thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy. That was part of the birthright. In blessing, I will bless thee was part of the birthright. Your line will be established forever was part of the birthright. Can the church say amen? In other words, there's a value to this thing. This wasn't a natural thing. This was not even supposed to be a thing that could be sold. Can the church say amen? Because it was an eternal thing. It was a spiritual thing. It was a prophecy thing. Don't ask me to sell my birthright. It is too valuable to me. There's too much in this thing. There's too much power in this thing. There's too much this birthright could do for me to even consider selling it. It's too valuable. Esau could have said, "Hear this now. I rather faint here today than sell this birthright. This birthright have too much preaching to bring it to me. My father, my grandfather Abraham went through too much for me to give up his birthright." Can the church say amen? Jesus died on the cross for his birthright. Oh, you don't hear me this morning? God sent a prophet because of this birthright. This message of Yahwa is because of the birthright. In the birthright is miracles. In the birthright is healing. The birthright is the Holy Ghost. In the birthright is every promise of God. It's too important to sell. You don't hear me this morning. There's rapture and faith in this birthright. There's adoption in the birthright. There's these signs shall follow them that believe. That's in the birthright. Somebody preach back to me. Joy, unspeakable, and full of glory is in the birthright. There's mercy in the birthright. This birthright has my protection. This birthright will take somebody to the rapture. This birthright will change your body from mortal to immortality. This birthright will make you stop your lying. This birthright will send the devil flying. This birthright, oh, come on now. This birthright has power in and of itself. Who has the birthright has the power? Who has the birthright has the authority? Who has the birthright has the kingdom. Who has the birthright has the access. Who has the birthright? Come on now. Somebody preach back to me. Do not sell your birthright. Come on now. Come on now. Come on now. Hallelujah. Do not sell your birthright. Birthright is the inheritance. You can't earn the birthright. You can't work for the birthright. There's nothing to do to achieve the birthright. You may be seated. I want us to appreciate something, church. Esau could never earn it. Brother Anthony, all he had to do was stay in the atmosphere, stay in the channel. He was the first born of his father, Isaac. It was going to come to him automatically. You don't hear me this morning. It was going to come to him automatically. He just had to wait until his change come. Wait until his time come. All that was in God, he pulled into Christ. All that was in Christ get pulled into the church. All that God gave to Abraham went on to Isaac. All that was in Isaac was now locked up, ready to be divided. Birthright and blessing. Two things Isaac had to pass on. Birthright and blessing. Can the church say, "Amen." Do not sell your birthright. Don't give it up that easy, church. Don't walk away from your inheritance. Don't walk away from your eternity. Don't walk away from your destiny. &gt;&gt; Somebody preach back to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I want to establish a few things here. Jacob said, "Sell me the birth tri." He didn't say, "Give it to me." You know, &gt;&gt; he says, "Sell it to me." &gt;&gt; So to say that Jacob tricked Esau is a lie. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In fact, Esau would tell his father Isaac later on twice Jacob tricked me. That's a lie. &gt;&gt; Because Jacob said, "Sell it to me." Amen. &gt;&gt; A sell is a trade or it's a transaction. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And if you go to KFC, you go to buy a Coca-Cola, you go to buy something, somebody is selling and there has to be a value of payment &gt;&gt; for the transaction to be closed. &gt;&gt; Now, if I say to you, hear this. I have a box of KFC and it's $1,000. Anybody here will buy it? &gt;&gt; Why not? But don't say it overpriced. In other words, but say it overpriced. But don't say overpriced. In other words, when people go into the market, instead of people going to the market, right, &gt;&gt; and you say, "Well, how much for the oranges?" You say, "That's not good value. there's too much value or somebody say well you have to pay me more because this is too valuable. Here we have a comparison because the question being asked to Jacob was uh Jacob asking Esau sell me the birthright. And what Jacob have to pay with &gt;&gt; is better upon say red beans. [Applause] What all he have to pay is a bowl of soup. Now imagine you go and try to buy a house and the man say the house is a million dollars and you say well here what you you'll you'll take a bowl of soup. This is I want you to see the picture. I want it to be clear to the young people to the children because there's a lot of information out there. It's as if they're going to buy a house because this was more than a house. &gt;&gt; This was more than land. &gt;&gt; This was more than property and money. This was the birthright of God's word to Abraham that was now being discussed into where it goes next. &gt;&gt; And Jacob say, "All I have is a little bowl of soup, &gt;&gt; but I want your house, your car, your land, your inheritance, your spiritual blessing." Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Verse 32. And Esau said, "Behold, I am at the point to die. You young people say I go dead. If I don't get to say I go dead. They want to go and go to a party. Oh god. My my is is my daughter upstairs. I have to be careful saying this because what this really is is very childlike behavior &gt;&gt; because Esau is saying if I don't eat this soup now I go dead. That is not true. This was a tantrum being shown. There are people say is my friend and if I don't go my whole life fall apart in a whole tantrum. &gt;&gt; If I look at this phone you don't love me. I want the phone. I go dead without the &gt;&gt; anybody ever see that? Is it anybody ever see that kind of behavior from anybody? &gt;&gt; It's not just children. Even grown-ups you know something and you want something so bad and if I don't get them my life go fall apart and So, Esau is not only not seeing the value of what he has, but his temporary carnal impatient &gt;&gt; position says I want to die. In other words, if I don't get this thing, I go dead. If I don't get if I don't get a car, I go dead. If I don't get a job, I go dead. If I don't get a phone, I go dead. If I don't get this outfit, if I don't get to go to this party, I go dead. &gt;&gt; I want to go by this friend. And if I don't go by this friend, I fell up and they see the child jumping and close the door. And then parents give up and say, "Well, all right, go go go go go." And 5, 10, 15 years later, you look back and you regret the decision because there's a lack of discipline. And there's a lack of not understanding the exchange of value. Because friends, whatever God say is valuable is valuable. It's not up to us to place value on things. Many of us are placing a value on spiritual things and God's value is different from ours. When you see the way God values things, how God values humility, &gt;&gt; how God values mercy, how God values forgiveness, that's not what the world values, the world has a different value system, but God's values, the value we're talking about this morning. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be too long with you. &gt;&gt; Behold, I'm at the point to die. And Esau responded, "What profit shall this birthright do to me?" In other words, if I don't get this simple, carnal, natural, temporary pleasure right now, what is the value of this birthright? pleasure &gt;&gt; a temporary situation &gt;&gt; and this here was the beginning the beginning of the problem with Esau because Esau problem was bigger than this you know &gt;&gt; but there's a beginning of problems we preach about Samson convention Timnat was the beginning Timnath led to Sorak Sorak led to Gaza &gt;&gt; it was a progression it was a decline and here it is this is the point the moment you don't realize what you have. The moment you begin to take this gospel lightly, the moment you begin to take the word lightly, the moment we begin to place a different value on what this message is, something is wrong with you. And God begins to look at you different because this message is the most powerful thing on the face of the earth. It will take you to the rapture. It'll change you in your moment of crisis. When the doctor has given up on you, this is what it will take to bring you healing. When the doctor don't know your answer and you have to come for prayer, it'll be the great physician that's locked up in the birthright. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? I can't afford to trade my birthright. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There are hard cases in the church. We need more than blessings. We need the birthright to be in operation because the birthright is everything. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come the church say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 33. And Jacob said, "Swear to me this day." And he swear unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob. &gt;&gt; Do not sell your birthright. We're going to build now. &gt;&gt; Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottish of lentils. Imagine that. You give up your old spiritual. People give up their spiritual thing for their job. For a girlfriend, for a boyfriend, for to for a party, for a cigarette, for to lime outside and and for a temporary 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, &gt;&gt; your whole spiritual destiny gets wrecked. &gt;&gt; And we read the scripture when Esau finally came to a spot to want to fix it, &gt;&gt; he couldn't fix it. There was no repentance found for him because he had gone too far. Years ago, I preached a message, do not cross the line. Brother Brandham said, "I see a day coming when people come to the altar to be prayed for, but they will get nothing because mercy is finished." That's why the Bible said, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found. Call ye upon him while he is near." You don't have all the time in the world. You don't even know what next week will hold. You don't know what tomorrow will hold. If you don't have the Holy Ghost today, I challenge you by the strength that's in here this morning. Be desperate to your spiritual inheritance. There is no substitute. Do not accept anything less than your birthright. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you came to church here for this morning, but we're not here to play games. Lives are at stake. Houses are in danger. [Applause] And decisions have consequences. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? People want to come into the house of God and go back and live any way they want. That's not how God operates. God is a God of love. He's a God of mercy. But he's a God of principles also. He's a God of his word. And if God don't keep his word, he's not God. He's a God of judgment. He's a God of mercy. He's a God of grace. He's a God of forgiveness. That's the God we serve. There are things he loves and there are things he hates. I want to be in the channel of what God loves. I don't want to have the things that God hate. I want to give value to the things that God gave value. And the thing that God said is no value. He said it's dung. It's filthiness. All of it is vanity. All of it is nothing. This world is finished. &gt;&gt; Give me liberty or give me debt. Give me the Holy Ghost or give me debt. Your degree when the time comes has no value. Come on now. I'm not saying don't go to school. I'm not saying don't have a degree. But understand the value equation. There's a value in the spiritual things. Your eternity has a value no amount of money could pay for. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Your testimony has a value, young sister. Your testimony, your virtue, your virginity has a value. Don't sell it for a pot of soup. Don't sell it for a box of KFC. Don't sell it for temporary. Oh, you don't hear me this morning. You are worth more than that. You are royalty. You are born for a purpose. You are worth something that Christ would leave glory, change form, take your sin, go to Calvary to die for you so you could have access to the birthright. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Let me say something, church. Even though Esau sold his birthright, that birthright could not have been affected until Isaac died. &gt;&gt; You heard what I said? Even though Esau sold a birthright to Jacob, that birthright was ineffective until Isaac died. Because only when Isaac died could it be passed on. Hallelujah. And for us in our day until Jesus came, the birthright could not have been effective to us. But when he died on the cross, the inheritance was now made available to those who had value for the birthright. This is why Christ dying is so important because him dying unlocked the flow of the birthright in the form of the Holy Ghost for a total complete redemption. [Applause] I cannot give up this eternity. Christ died and I want to give it up for a boyfriend, for a girlfriend, for a party, to wear a mini skirt, to wear a short dress, to wear a short pants, to live in the world. Come on, you got to be crazy. All that is soup. All that is soup. [Music] I like soup on but not that kind of soup. My butt it is not worth the soup that Jacob is cooking. It could be a good chef. It could be a good deal. It could be a good offer, a good presentation. It could have garlic and ginger and spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and I don't care what it have in it. My birthright is so important. Do not sell your birthright. I want the Holy Ghost and nothing less. Adoption and nothing less. perfection and nothing less. My whole family and nothing less. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. It's my right. Birth right. It's my right. It's my privilege. It's my inheritance. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't care where your son is. It's part of your birthright. I don't care where your daughter is. It's part of your birthright. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout of praise. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me drop this in here in the message of thinking man filter. Brother Brandham said, "Esau thought that the birthright didn't mean what God said it did." &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. Esau thought that that birthright didn't mean what God said it did. That was the difference between life and death. In other words, Esau had an interpretation of the &gt;&gt; birthright. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because when you don't take it, because you know God is his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; So when you don't take it the way God presented, then you have your view of it. Well, well, if we go to church, we'll be fine. If we in the message, we'll be fine. That's not the word, right? You know, &gt;&gt; and I want to make a distinction. We'll preach on it. But there's a difference between the blessing and the birthright. &gt;&gt; And many of us, we have the blessings of the message. &gt;&gt; The blessings of salvation, but that's not the birthright. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel were blessed in the wilderness. Their shoes never got messed up. They closed with they got manifest blessing. Birthright was the promised land. Only Joshua, Caleb, and the young people made it into the birthright. &gt;&gt; They had blessings. And many of us, we come to church, well, I'm blessed. I'm too blessed to be stressed. I'm not preaching with blessing. It's good to have a blessing, but I want the birthright because the birthright I could pass on the birthright to somebody else. Can the church say on Oh, come on now. That's a seed germ in the body. Oh, come on now. Somebody preach back to me. Peter had lived with the blessing. God gave him power. &gt;&gt; He gave the disciples power. That wasn't the birthright. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they were casting out devils. Even Judas was casting out devils. &gt;&gt; Read the Bible. Read the message. Judas was casting out devils, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Judas never made it to the birthright. &gt;&gt; He had blessings and God say listen don't rejoice because you have power over these things but rejoice because your name is in the book because you get name on the book it means you are on the list to get the birth right. That is the will he talking about &gt;&gt; because he knew death was coming and when he died the Holy Ghost would be released to those whose name on the book. Oh come on now. That's why God is not looking at you at your condition now. He's looking at what you could become because your name is on the book. Give the Lord a shout of praise. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to preach you're happy, you know. I'm not trying to tell you all is well and all going to be right because your name in the book. That's what I'm trying to teach you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a part to do. &gt;&gt; You have a choice to make. You have actions to take. Decisions have consequences. &gt;&gt; Look at walk because of the message you're going to make it the theme of every apostle. Acts 19. Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? &gt;&gt; I don't question that there are believers in here, but do you have something on top of your belief? &gt;&gt; Do you have the Holy Ghost since you believe? &gt;&gt; Somebody preach back to me this morning. &gt;&gt; So, I want to say that again. Esau thought the birthright meant did mean what God said it did. So he had an interpretation. &gt;&gt; He want a piece of it. In other words, he wanted to serve God the way he wanted to. So he said this thing this all this preaching and all this shouting and all this thing about holy living and thing. I don't think it really mean that. You know, &gt;&gt; I have friends who are Christians and and they not under this kind of pressure. I don't think this bird really mean what it is. Anybody with me this morning &gt;&gt; in the message? Hearing, recognizing, acting on the word of God. You could take some more. All right. Cuz we here for the we here for the day and we have food at the end of service. So nobody have any. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know one time Paul was preaching until somebody dead in the service. He's preaching so long. Somebody dead. He pray raise them dead and keep on preaching. He said just ignore that. You know he say just ignore that. Just stay focused because we have to we have a railroad to cut here this morning because when we finish here we have to pray for the sick and all them demons that have been trying to stress you out have a time limit. They have a expiry date. They have expiry date. You know if you know anything about me I'm very serious about when things expired. So if I get a yogurt or anything I be like where's the expiry date? So I always making an issue that the other day my daughter took some jam out the fridge and the first thing she came and say daddy this thing expired I say look how environment and things people see they start to reflect say no that that jam is good it's not expired but the demons trying to flick you expired &gt;&gt; they have expiry date on them no you have no expiry date or you eternal you come from God they going back to God you had no beginning how you can have an ending If you never had a beginning and you were part of the spirit that rotated off of God and part in the mind of God from the before there was a world before how could you have an ending when you never had a beginning? You are part of God. That's why the sickness upon your body has got to go because sickness is temporary. Sickness had a beginning. You can identify when it started and today we will define when it ends. [Music] [Applause] But you have no beginning. You have no ending because you are eternal creature. Come now on this earth to prove in this Eden, in Satan's Eden, that you could stand the test. You could stand the opposition. You could stand the pressure. Whatever the devil throws at you, you chest strap it. Lift up your head and say, "I know my redeemer live it. The Lord gives. The Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." Though the skinworm destroy this body, yet in my flesh I will see God. There's a resurrection. There's a promise. There's a power. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; So we back to our scripture. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way as if he didn't do anything. Imagine that. He eat and then went yes went away. And God, this is God's commentary on the transaction. Thus Esau despised &gt;&gt; his birthright. That word despise is a powerful word you know it's just like hate. It means reject. It means devalue. So when God saw that he say this man value I give him something and that's how we treat it. &gt;&gt; God looked at that. Esau say he he hated it. No he say I despised it. But when God saw his attitude towards the birthright, his attitude towards the things of God, his attitude to what God promised him, when God saw his attitude towards it, he say, "Nah, he don't want this thing." He despised the birthight. &gt;&gt; What is our attitude towards the house of God, towards the things of God, towards the people of God, towards the promises of God, towards the inheritance of God, towards the birthright, towards the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Will God look at us and say, "Boy, like you despise this thing, boy. Oh, will God be able to say no? &gt;&gt; He wants it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon &gt;&gt; in the message question and answers 1959. But there's one thing Jacob wanted and that was the birthright. Regardless of what come, how he had to get it, what level he had to come on, that birthright was all he cared for. And Esau, the Bible said, despise his birthright. The Bible said that. And the Bible said, "Except there come some vain fornicator among you, like that evil person, Esau, who despised his birthright and sold it for me or pottage." Now, what is a birthright? It's the right. That's what I'm trying to tell you. This Holy Spirit is your birthright. &gt;&gt; That's your birthright. That's your God-given right. Now, people say today, "I'll go to church. I'm just as good as the next fellow. But me, act like one of them holy rollers." Not me. Well, you see, Esau, so you say when you start to talk, so you see Esau, it's just the same thing. despising the birthright, &gt;&gt; he swapped it for a mess of pottage &gt;&gt; in hearing recognizing, acting on the word of God, Jacob, the reason that he chose to find that birthright regardless. He wanted to get it because he knowed that birthright held the blessings. It held life. He didn't care how it come. Just so he got it. That was the main thing. What plane it came on didn't matter. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He wanted it and he must have it and he got it. Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness. They shall be filled. He was on his own. He was after it and he received it. Can the church give the Lord a shout of praise? &gt;&gt; Could we say some more things, church? &gt;&gt; Anybody sleeping? Deacon, just check. &gt;&gt; If anybody sleeping, just point them out to me. Let's give him a friendly call to acknowledge him. So, let's go. So, it's easy to say that Esau despised the birthright and given the birthright. And that was all that there was to hate about Esau. What we have just discussed is what should be covered in Sunday school. &gt;&gt; Now, let's begin to push a little bit. Now at that time there were like three lines bloodlines or family lines. There was the descendants of Canaan. Canaan was Noah's grandson. So you had Noah, Ham, Canaan. From Canaan the Canaanites. Canaan had a son named Het. Out of Het come the Hittites. So all of these names have a generational origin. So from Israel became the Israelites. Are we together? &gt;&gt; All right. from Canaan who the grandson of Noah came the Canaanites. Kaan had a son named Het. Out of Het came the Hittites. So all of these out of Lot came Moab which was the Moabites. So each of these you could trace back the line and this is where it starts to get important &gt;&gt; to see how God sees things and why God treat things a certain way and why we have to be so careful and not not pull punches when it comes to what is what God sees as right and what is wrong. Can the church say amen? Esau despising the birthright was the beginning of the end because the moment he walked away, the moment he devalued the birthright, he began to value other things. &gt;&gt; Let me say that one more time. &gt;&gt; The moment you lose the value of God's word, his promise, his purpose, his plan, his destiny, what he's doing. The moment you say that is not important to me, other things become more important. &gt;&gt; How your friends feel become more important because you're basically saying what God wants is not important. So I need to go and meet my friends. Why not in church? Well, we're friends. &gt;&gt; The only way you could reach that spot is because you've already determined that what God says is valuable is no longer valuable. Can the church say amen? But the brand would say people miss Wednesday night church because they want to watch TV. &gt;&gt; For you to reach that point, it means you see God's word and value as not important and then TV become more valuable. &gt;&gt; Because everybody have the same 24 hours in a day. You know, &gt;&gt; nobody have 36, nobody have 12, same hours in a day. You have a choice with how you spend the time. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get to somewhere. So the question you have to ask yourself is, what do you value? Because for you to value worldly music, you have to give up the value God has on spiritual things. Can the church say amen? For you to value the boy in the world or the worldly style and fashion, you cannot just value it unless you give up what's more valuable. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now when I preach on Samson and I talk about Timnat, I say he'd have never end up with a girl in Timnat if he had stayed with his people. &gt;&gt; Anybody remember that? &gt;&gt; So after Esau despise the birthright and lose the value of the birthright in Genesis 26 verse 34. And the Bible says, "And Esau was 40 years old when he took to wife Judith." No offense to anybody named Judith. the daughter of Bry the Hitittite &gt;&gt; and Bashimat the daughter of Elon the Hitittite. &gt;&gt; So the moment he despised the birthright he went and marry a Hitittite &gt;&gt; and this begins to get important and we'll see why it begins getting important in a in a few minutes because the Bible goes on next verse which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebecca. In other words, this thing stress out Isaac and Rebecca &gt;&gt; in so much. And when it was Jacob time, the Bible said that that Rebecca said if Jacob only go after a daughter of Heth, which is the Hittites, &gt;&gt; it life not even worth living anymore. We can't get to all the scriptures, but I'm building into something. So, I want us to understand young people, especially you younger ones. Well, I want a boyfriend and I want a girlfriend and I want this. You have to know where you're standing &gt;&gt; because if you go after the birthright and after the spiritual things, God will take care of you. You know, but don't make Esau's mistake &gt;&gt; because we're building into a case of why God hated Esau. It was a sequence of things. In the case of King Saul, it's two things made Saul rejected. Not one, two things. &gt;&gt; The first was when he did what he was not supposed to do. When God through Samuel says, "I am going to perform the sacrifice. Wait seven days." And Saul took it upon himself to say, "Well, I don't need to wait on Samuel. I'm a king." He was not a priest. He was not a prophet. And he offered a sacrifice. And when Samuel came and say, "What have you done?" And God said, "Because you did this thing, I'm going to cut off the kingdom." &gt;&gt; So had s had Saul not done that, he would have had the kingdom. &gt;&gt; That was the first strike against King Saul. And the second was when he didn't kill King Aag. &gt;&gt; And we'll talk about that in a minute as well. But I wanted to see this. So to show you how God is viewing this thing. So the first thing, brother George, that Esau went to marry these Hittite girls &gt;&gt; which were a grief of mine to Isaac and Rebecca. And he not a fool. By the time we reach to Genesis 28 verse8, Genesis 28:8, I've given you the brothers back a little few minutes. And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan, talking about the ones he married, pleased not Isaac, his father. So you're not a fool. You don't know what pleased God. &gt;&gt; Nobody here is a fool. when he recognized that he made a out in his decision and it pleased not his father. Verse 9, then went Esau unto Ishmael. So there are three lines is the Canaanites, the Ishraelites and the descendants of Isaac. So Esau trying to fix the problem but he had gone from the Hittites to uh in his own tribe you know he going to the next one. &gt;&gt; So there's a still a level in him that can't come to the full truth. He give up the Hitittite but but oh God the compromise in him now because he why he already give up the birthright. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; So the Bible said and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father. &gt;&gt; Then Esau then went Esau unto Ishmael and took unto the wives which he had Mahalat the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son the sister of Nebajot to be his wife. So all is God building a strike, building a case against Esau. &gt;&gt; A word to the wise is sufficient in their church. &gt;&gt; This is why the prophet say under no circumstances a believer marry an unbeliever &gt;&gt; because we're trying to protect you from certain things. &gt;&gt; It is the word. All right. Good. Let's go. Esau in his heart. The Bible says because of what Jacob has done to me, &gt;&gt; I want to kill him. Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; In other words, because he do me, this is what he didn't say it audibly. It was in his heart. &gt;&gt; Rebecca picked up on it. Tell Jacob, "Go and hide." Eventually, they reconciled in Genesis 33. And the Bible said, "And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept." But that was only external punch because that hug and that shake hand and that God bless you things behind us. Let let bygones be bygones water under the bridge. It was just words because the problem was in his heart. And I want to show the moment you sell your birthright, you'll be you're just going down and down and down. And a root of bitterness was born in Esau's heart. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Everybody with me. &gt;&gt; Now, let's build to show how the decision start to have consequences. Now, now the Bible said Esau equal to Edom &gt;&gt; multiple times. &gt;&gt; And God still gives Esau a blessing. He doesn't have the birthright because you would recall when when Rebecca heard that Isaac was about to give the birthright and Isaac told Esau, "Go and kill her animal and cook a meal because I want to bless you." Rebecca, well, bless her heart. Rebecca said, "Jacob, come come." Esau, go on and go and hunt here. Let's go and get some kids. Let me cook a nice little stew to cook and you get the blessing. But Jacob said, "Don't fool." He said, "But listen, mom, my hand smooth, Esau handy." She said, "I will fix that. put this thing here. She wants to roll him in the dirt because we know when Isaac came to try to bless, he said, "Who is this?" He say, "Your son, Esau." He said, "But you're sing like Jacob. Let me feel your hand." Because Isaac was blind. Let me feel your hand. He said, "You're feeling like Esau. Let me smell you. You're smelling like Esau, but you're sing like Jacob." And at that point, Isaac pronounced the blessing upon him. &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen." And we learned that when God pronounced a blessing on you, he can't take it back. He can't take it back. So Jacob there, his hands raised, his father Isaac put his hand on him and said to pronounce a blessing that thy seed shall possess the gy and everything that was in Abraham that passed through him was now passing to his son Jacob. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Which was confirmation of the birthright blessing. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; We building into something. &gt;&gt; Esau now missed the surface. &gt;&gt; He was hunting. It was no fault of his at this point bear in mind he don't sell the bird any heart. So he going through the motion he reach with the nice animal and he cook the nice food and he bring the food for the father and the father say what is this I just eat who is this he say where is he? So he say who is just here &gt;&gt; he said but son I done I done the blessing done gone &gt;&gt; the birthright done gone I give blessing upon blessing upon blessing. Anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; And Esau said, "But wait now, you don't have anything left to give me. &gt;&gt; You don't have any can of blessing self." &gt;&gt; And and Isaac said, "Well, all right. I'll still bless you." And he pronounced a blessing upon him. Still, &gt;&gt; no birth, right? But he was blessed. &gt;&gt; And he said, "By the sword you shall live and all this stuff, but the reality is Esau still left with a blessing." &gt;&gt; Even though God hated him, oh, let me be careful. He still had a blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God can have a problem with somebody but a George &gt;&gt; and still bless them. Oh God help me this morning &gt;&gt; because before he was born God already determined he hate him. &gt;&gt; So God can have a problem with somebody and still bless them. This is why when David say how are these people blessed around me? God asks the question have you considered their end? Because what we preaching about is the end of the story, not the blessing, not who have the house and the car and this and that. Have you considered the end because many have run the race. The race is not for the swift, but for those who endure until the end. I've run my race. I've finished my course. I've kept the faith. &gt;&gt; Somebody give God a shout of praise. So I want to encourage you this morning. What blessing God pronounced upon your life could never be taken back. His blessing is permanent. His word, as brother Andrew said, could never return void. If God said you're going to be healed, healing has got to come to you. I believe it could happen today. I believe it could happen today. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So, Esau equals Edom. still having a blessing and God gave them land. He gave them land, Mount Sir. &gt;&gt; So when in scripture you see Esau or you see Edom or you see Mount Sir or you see Edomia, which is the Greek for Edom, is all the same thing he's talking about. &gt;&gt; True scripture, four words define this issue. Because when God speaks about Israel, he speaks about Israel the man, Israel the people, Israel the land, Israel the promise. It's all one. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, thus Esau in Genesis 36, thus dwelt Esau in Mount Sir. And we know Esau is equal to Edom. And God, because he knows it, he told Israel, I want us to understand this because this is wisdom. This is sibling rivalry in its highest form. &gt;&gt; Could his two brothers be speaking about? Yes. &gt;&gt; Good. God told the children of Israel in Deuteronomy, "Med meddle not with them, telling Israel, don't meddle with Saul, with with with Esau and Edom and Mount Serum, for I will not give you of their land." &gt;&gt; So God is telling Israel, the land I give to Esau, leave him with it. It's not yours. &gt;&gt; Respect the boundaries. There are some boundaries you have to respect &gt;&gt; because God could have a problem with somebody. It's not your problem. Could I say that again? &gt;&gt; Plenty of us like to take on God fights, you know. &gt;&gt; God have a problem. Is God have the problem with Esau? You know, so Jacob Carfield led to say, "Well, we taking all the land including that one because that one is a problem. We taking that too." &gt;&gt; Let me make the point clear. God could have a problem with somebody. It's not your problem. &gt;&gt; Because God still gave Esau that land. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "No, not so much as a foot breath because I have given Mount Seir unto Esau for opposition." &gt;&gt; In fact, God told Israel when you pass through their land, pay them for everything. &gt;&gt; Don't even have no expectation. Don't say, "Well, because it's my brother." Plenty of us have the same because well, it's my brother, he's supposed to give me. Yes. &gt;&gt; God said when you pass through that land, pay them. Walk with your money. Walk with your credit card. Don't don't don't have no expectation. You go into the house, carry food. pay them for it. I'm reading this. This is the This is the Bible, right? &gt;&gt; Because God was establishing boundaries because he was also seeing what Jacob couldn't even see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because when Jacob hugged Esau, he thought the reconciliation was real. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; He thought it was his tears. The Bible said they wept to know. &gt;&gt; Friends, if you have a come and hug you and crying and think, &gt;&gt; I would think it done. a punch. If you have beef with somebody for years and I see you hugging both all your crying and I say, "Well, they both delivered all dropped everything in the past." Hallelujah. Glory to God. But God seeing the heart &gt;&gt; and seeing that weeping day is a show. Is Oscars coming? Is the Oscars or Grammy? One of them is the Oscar is have a Oscar award &gt;&gt; for that weeping and hugging and there &gt;&gt; brother leave church. It look things make right and thing but between there is a root of bitterness. after the hug, after the crying and God seeing that root of bitterness. &gt;&gt; And the problem with a root of bitterness is root of bitterness to get hold of other people. &gt;&gt; So it passed from father to son to grandson. The root of bitterness and we'll see it in a second. All right, &gt;&gt; church say amen. &gt;&gt; Could you take some more? &gt;&gt; But pastor say cast up now. is normally brother Clarence that has hold me but the pastor say I cast off now I want to go to because we've preached about this brother but Terren know but Terren loves this kind of thing here in in in Genesis 36 verse let's go down to verse &gt;&gt; uh Genesis 36 verse 10 these Genesis 36:10 brothers I want to make sure the people see it with All right. Genesis 36:10. These are the names of Esau's sons. So, I want to start to show you now how this thing start to connect the dots. Elephas, the son of Adam, the wife of Esau. Ruel, the son of Bashimat, the wife of Esau. Let's go. And the sons of Elephas was Teman, Omar, Zeo, and Gatam, and Kenaz. Go on. And Temna was concubine to Eleif's Esau's son, and she bear to Elephaz Amalecch. Now, we preach about Amalcch plenty times. This is the father of the Amalachites. &gt;&gt; So when we preach, you should have killed all the Amalachites. &gt;&gt; Saul lost the kingdom because he didn't kill King A who was king of the Amalachites. So in other words, if Esau didn't be misbehave, he wouldn't have a grandson called Amalecch. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; So when God say I hate Esau, it's not just Esau the man. Esau grandson is Amalecch who was of the Amalachites who was one of the worst enemies of Israel from generation to generation in so much that God keep reminding them remember what Amalecch did. Remember what Amalcch did. Remember what Amalecch did. When you came out of Egypt and you had no army and you were weak and you were tired, Amalecch waited for you and punished you. What reason did Amalecch have to go after them? Israel had no beef with nobody. They were 400 years under Egyptian prison. &gt;&gt; But the root of bitterness from their great great great grandfather was sitting in the tribe all the generations. So when Israel came out of Egypt with no army, with no weapons, with no defense, they were tired. They were just happy to be free. The Bible said Amalecch was waiting for them. &gt;&gt; And God say, "I hate that thing, boy." because they &gt;&gt; Amalcch would become Israel's worst enemy all the way to Esther &gt;&gt; when Hmon Hmon was an Agagite &gt;&gt; which is of in other words Hmon was a so these are so what we show is the descendants of Esau so Esau is not a genesis story &gt;&gt; because Esau become Edom Edom is mount sir mount series Idomia the grandson is Amalcch who is all the Amalachites &gt;&gt; and what God saying had Esau kept the birthright no Amalcch would be there &gt;&gt; had he stayed in line because even listen even after he gave up the birthright he didn't have to go and marry the Mites he didn't have to go and do those things come on now somebody preach back to me because even even Cain and Abel without a revelation God told Cain listen Abel I the sacrifice. I know you'd have a revelation, but if you at least do what your brother do, I'll still bless you. &gt;&gt; So, no matter how far you go, you still have a choice. But people like to go down the slippery slide. Well, I don't mess up here, so I go worse. I don't mess up here, I go worse. Cut it today and start to reverse your steps. Repentance means to change your mind, change your way, change your behavior, change your attitude. Because if you don't change, it gets worse. Anybody in the house this morning? &gt;&gt; Exodus 17 was Amalecch's first attack on Israel. We're going to say a few things. They're trying to find a place to close off, but the pastor don't say go already. So &gt;&gt; Exodus 17:8, then came Amalecch and fought with Israel and referred him. And Moses said unto Joshua, so you see in this thing with Esau, now reach Moses table. &gt;&gt; You see how problems could move? Yes. &gt;&gt; So this is not a Jacob problem. Now it go now to Israel. Under Moses and Joshua. Now Esau to them now is now Amalecch. &gt;&gt; Which is the grandson of Esau. &gt;&gt; Moses said unto Joshua, choose out men and go out fight with Amalecch. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. Now we see the context of how these things begin to connect because God is seeing from Genesis to Revelation. He's seeing from eternity into time back into eternity. And Joshua discomforted Amalecch and his people with the edge of the sword. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Moses, "Write this." This is how important this is to God. &gt;&gt; Write this for a memorial in a book &gt;&gt; and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua. In other words, make sure Joshua have this clear, clear, clear. &gt;&gt; For I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalecch from under heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi. &gt;&gt; So when we talk about Jehovah Nissi, this was the context of even the establishing of that name. &gt;&gt; For he said, "Behold, the Lord had sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalecch from generation to generation." &gt;&gt; And we going on now. We talking about why God hate Esau &gt;&gt; and what happens when you choose to give up your birthright. Do not sell your birthright, church. Let's go in Deuteronomy 25:17. Remember what Amalecch did unto thee by the way &gt;&gt; when you were come forth out of Egypt. Imagine you now get a breakthrough. You now get delivered. You now get free. And the enemy they trying to punish you. God say listen you see when somebody getting free time is the time to give them the space to get free. &gt;&gt; Hear the demonic spirit because with a brand call it a Esau spirit. &gt;&gt; So I'm not preaching history. I'm preaching the spirit operating today. Brother Brandham say spirits don't die. We know this. &gt;&gt; Spirits move on. The spirit of Elijah rest on Elijah. God took the spirit of Moses and divided across seven 70 men. &gt;&gt; When Jesus met Legion, these spirits say don't cast us back into the bottomless pit, throw us into the pigs. Spirit's looking for some place. So the spirit of Esau is operating today. &gt;&gt; And if God sees it, he has an agenda against it because something he hates. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 25:17, remember what Amalecch did unto thee. By the way, when you were come forth out of Egypt, how he met thee, by the way, and smokeote behind most of the the weaker ones, they're always weaker ones. And God say that he went after the weaker ones, those that are struggling. &gt;&gt; And church, the enemy want to take out the weaker ones. The enemy want to come into your family and find all the weakness and destroy the weaker ones and put pressure on you and stress you out. &gt;&gt; The devil not trying to go after these strong ones. He want to take out the weaker ones. &gt;&gt; Those that now trying to get stabilized. The enemy is after you is a Esau spirit we dealing with. Can the church say amen? But we identifying it this morning and say not one shall be left behind. We will draw our swords and fight back to back soldier to soldier against the Amalachites under the against the Hittites, the Jebusite, the Canaanite. I don't care what kind of it is today. We serve all the itites. Notice every giant will fall. Every ite will fall. &gt;&gt; There's power in our birthright. We are not giving it up. We know what the birthright is. We are holding on to it. I mean the Bible will give us power over every spirit over doubt, fear, lust, unbelief, pornography, adultery, whatever it is. In the name of Jesus Christ, house of hell, give way to the name of Jesus, you shall be free. And who the son of man sets free is free indeed. Somebody say free indeed. &gt;&gt; Free indeed. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 25, we're still here. 17 Remember what Amalecch did unto thee by the way when you were come forth out of Egypt. How he met thee by the way and smoke behind most of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee. When thou was faint and weary, and he feared not God. So God looked at it. Friends, when somebody down, isn't it time to kick them down? &gt;&gt; How many time people struggling and instead of you giving an encouraging word, you you want to push them down? Amen. &gt;&gt; God is looking at the spirit of Esau and saying, "My people were in trouble. There were those weak and faint and weary." And God goes on, "Therefore, it shall be when the Lord thy God had given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the Lord thy God given thee for inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalecch from under heaven. Thou shalt not forget it." Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is what God brought to King Saul. He said, "Remember what Amalecch did? Wipe them out." &gt;&gt; And instead of Saul doing his job, he kept Aag and he kept animals and all this kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Helping keep the line alive. &gt;&gt; I'll skip a few things. &gt;&gt; I want to go to the book of &gt;&gt; Oadiah. How many people love the book of Oadiah? &gt;&gt; Half of you I read the book of Oaya. &gt;&gt; Obadia is one of those prophets. Most people not never spend time looking at it. Look at Ezekiel and Jeremiah and Malachi and Isaiah and and all these prophets. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, all these prophets prophesied to Israel, about Israel, for Israel. Their focus was Israel. &gt;&gt; Obadiah was the only prophet who had a dedicated ministry to deal with Esau. &gt;&gt; To deal with Edom and to deal with this issue. So, he's the Esau specialist among the prophets. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Obadiah 1 vers1. The vision of Obadiah, thus said the Lord God concerning Edom. He starts off calling out the spirit. &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord God concerning Edom. We have heard a rumor from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen. Arise he and let us rise up against her in battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen. Thou art greatly despised. &gt;&gt; So God is saying, Edom, you are greatly despised. &gt;&gt; And it's not just that they despis, you know, but he wants to give context about what about the Esau spirit, what God would like. Can we see a consistency? When we read about the six things God hate, he start with a proud look. &gt;&gt; Look at how he start to speak about what he doesn't like about Edom. &gt;&gt; Verse three, the pride of thine heartath. &gt;&gt; Thou that dwellest in the cliff of the rock. So he said, Edom, Esau, Mount Siri, the Edomians, all you have pride. You're in the cliff of the rock. You think you're untouchable. &gt;&gt; There are people who think you're untouchable. that we so we start to describe the Esau spirit. I'm not going to be too much longer with you, but I want you to see how the Esau spirit moving from age to age. &gt;&gt; Thou that dwellest in the cliff of the rock whose habitation is high and say it in his heart, who shall bring me down to the ground? &gt;&gt; So people who saying I can't fall, I can't make no mistake. I think I top of the world. I think this thing and this is what God saying. This is what he's saying in your heart. You're not telling anybody listen. the spirit of Esau. &gt;&gt; Listen to what God says through Oah. Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, &gt;&gt; and though thou set thy nest among the stars, then will I bring thee down, said the Lord. &gt;&gt; So God is saying the higher you try to go, if that spirit I will bring you down. &gt;&gt; So church, you don't have to bring no God watching the spirits and then you see people just fall fall because God say that pride you have, that thing you say you can't touch and and nobody could touch, God himself will bring you down. Can the church say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; And then God goes on in verse 10 of of of that same chapter to call out exactly and I want to deal with the spirit of Esau. Now we not going too much longer. Verse 10. For thy violence against thy brother Jacob. &gt;&gt; You see how God sees sibling rivalry and war between brothers and family. For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off forever. I want to repeat &gt;&gt; this narrative here. &gt;&gt; Listen to verse 11. In the day that thou stood us on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces. &gt;&gt; So in other words, while it taken away Israel into captivity, he's saying you were there and could have done something about it. &gt;&gt; But you stood there watching the carnage, watching the war. Brother George &gt;&gt; saying you're not getting involved when you could have come and help. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the spirit of Esau is seeing people in trouble and not doing nothing about it and saying well I just watch it. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; And foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon Jerusalem. Even thou was as one of them. So God is saying, Edom, not only did you stand aside and watch my anointed children get rams sacked, but when the ram sacking taking place, you was there picking up thing too. &gt;&gt; Now bear in mind, every time Israel got in trouble, it was God's will &gt;&gt; to bring them into subjection. But God is calling out the spirit that still say I are trying to help them and are trying to defend them and are trying to because there's a level of brotherly love that says if somebody in trouble he's supposed to help them. &gt;&gt; Anybody see this is the Esau spirit. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger. Neither should thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. So in other words, God saying, "Here's what not only did you not do anything, but when they get in trouble, you say it good for them. It it I know it is going to happen. I know that brother was going to fall." &gt;&gt; You see, wherever wherever he he he reaping his what he had sowed, that is the Easter spirit, you know, that's in the spirit of love &gt;&gt; cuz the Bible is saying is calling out the spirit. So when he say that thing happen in this church you know &gt;&gt; spirit &gt;&gt; this thing know &gt;&gt; spirit know because the moment we're going to talk like that that is not how God operates. &gt;&gt; Neither should thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. Neither should thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress. &gt;&gt; You see what happened there? That what happened here. You see what you see all of that kind of thing that comes across that way goes Esau spirit &gt;&gt; and God judged them for speaking that way when Jerusalem fell to show that these issues wasn't a temporary issue throughout multiple scriptures just to touch them quickly before we begin to wind down to see how God sees this true scripture in Isa uh in Isaiah 63 verse1 who is this that cometh from Edom. So even Isaiah pick up this this issue with dyed garments from Buzzra is that is glorious in his apparel traveling in the greatest of his strength. I'll skip through some of this and Buzzra Edom is all together. Jeremiah &gt;&gt; verse uh chapter 49:1 16 thy terribleness had deceived thee and the pride of thine heart oh thou that dwellest in the cliffs of the rock that holdst the height of the hill. Though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from then, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Also Edom shall be a desolation. Everyone that goeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at the plagues thereof. In Ezekiel verse uh chapter uh 25:12, thus sayeth the Lord God, because that Edom had dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and had greatly offended and revenged himself upon them. &gt;&gt; Therefore say the Lord God, I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it, and I will make it desolate from Taman, and they of shall fall by the sword. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a few more and we're done. Ezekiel 35. Ezekiel 35:2. Son of man, set thy face against Mount Syra and prophesy against it. So you see, God is not letting this issue rest. Because it's something that he sees from Genesis all the way through scripture, and say unto it, thus say the Lord God, behold, oh mount Sir, I am against thee, &gt;&gt; and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate. Thou shalt know that I am the Lord, because thou has had a perpetual hatred, and has shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in their time of their calabity, in the time that the iniquity had an end. &gt;&gt; Malachi, last one of this. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; We know Malachi 4:5 and 6. But Malachi's ministry started dealing with Esau. &gt;&gt; Malachi 1:2, I have loved thee, sayeth the Lord. Yet you say, wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Sayeth the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob. And I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Whereas, listen to the pro listen to Malachi's words. Edom said, "We are impoverished. We will return and build the desolate places." I want us to catch this. So Edom saying, "We in trouble and we will rebuild." Thus say the Lord of hosts, "They shall build, but I will throw down." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is saying, if the spirit of Esau is operating, every time he try to build back, he going to break it down again. &gt;&gt; You build, he break it down. You try to do it again, he will break it down. And you want to ask why is the people can't see the way? &gt;&gt; Because if the spirit of Esau either Mount Se Idomia is operating and God sees it there no matter what you try to build God will break it back down again &gt;&gt; because he set his face his heart his agenda against Esau against Edom against Mount B against Edomia. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; We are in poverty but we will return and build the desolate place. Thus say the Lord of hosts. They shall be but I will throw it down and they shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom the Lord hath indignation forever. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And of course we brought it now into the New Testament with the scripture we read in Romans and begin to wind out the musician can begin to get ready. Hebrews 12:15, "Looking diligently, lest any man fall of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness spring up trouble you, and thereby make and that thereby many be defiled, lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who for one moral of meat sold his birthight. For we know that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears." It's a warning to the believers &gt;&gt; because he had just gone too far. And for us who are in the message, the virtue of this age is brotherly kindness &gt;&gt; is the blood of this age. &gt;&gt; I ask a question of you this morning. What if Esau had just forgiven Jacob. How different the story would have been because Esau in his heart created an ought against Jacob that became a perpetual hatred. The ought that we thought was dropped when they met and they wept and they greeted wasn't really dropped. It was renewed annually, renewed from generation to generation. And God saw that ought never die and he saw the hatred there. What happens if you drop your oughts today? The Bible says that when you come to bring an offering to the Lord, if you have ought against your brother or sister, go make it right first before you even present your offering. &gt;&gt; We are being challenged here because if Esau had just done that one thing, what we would have talked about this morning may have been a very different story. But Esau held that in his heart and a root of bitterness was in his heart. &gt;&gt; Is there a root of bitterness in your heart this morning? Because if there is, you have to drop it. This is not just for those in church or your family. It's to everyone because brother Brandham said, "One ought puts you in danger of hellfire." &gt;&gt; One ought will prevent you from going to perfect love. &gt;&gt; So the message this morning, the true mystery of Esau is the fact that he held a passed on from generation to generation to generation. I want to encourage you church this morning, drop it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have a against your husband, drop it. &gt;&gt; You have a against your wife, drop it. &gt;&gt; You have a against your son, your neighbor, your school friend, I don't care who it is. I don't care who wrong you. There's no reason for you to hold her out this morning. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they did to you. Esau felt violated. He say, "Jacob robbed me. He took away what was mine." But he also had a choice. &gt;&gt; In the midst of it, they say, "I forgive you. &gt;&gt; I forgive you. I forgive you. &gt;&gt; And we are being challenged this morning to drop it &gt;&gt; to forgive your brother, to forgive your sister. And I said in a service last week, some of us we even need to forgive ourselves &gt;&gt; because God could forgive you and you could hold it against yourself. God don't even bring it up, but you there keeping yourself in your own prison, your prison of your own past because you haven't forgiven yourself. Some of us, the freedom we're looking for is freedom from our own selves. We could forgive others, but we still holding ourselves and in our own grip. &gt;&gt; You could begin to play something softly. &gt;&gt; But today is a day of forgiveness. Today is a day of restoration. &gt;&gt; Today is a day of reversing the effects of forgiveness, lack of forgiveness, and most importantly, giving up your birthight. There are many here this morning on this blessed Sunday morning. You've come to the house of God. I believe looking for a brand new touch, looking to see something different in your own life. I want to encourage shift your value equation. Don't value the things of the world because that will fade. Don't value what is temporary. What is eternal? Is is your heart right with God? &gt;&gt; Is there any ought any enmity, any desire that should not be there? Have you been valuing the wrong thing or holding and grudges in the wrong way? May today be a day that you are released and you release others. Even the Lord's prayer said, "Forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us." Every single person in this room has somebody who has done something to us. And many of us sometime we say we forgive and we let it go. And then something happened and it triggers back memories, feeling we realize the thing we thought we let go is already not let go. You know because something comes up and brings it up again. Have you really forgiven? &gt;&gt; Have you really dropped out? Have you really let it go and say it's not affecting me anymore? &gt;&gt; If that is not your position, there are children who need to forgive parents. There are parents who need to forgive children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] I want you to take a few minutes and search your heart. [Music] The Holy Spirit is here. God loves you. He wants all of you, not part of you. [Music] If you came in here this morning and you know you've not been living right, this is this is your day. I challenge you to not leave here the same way that you came, I challenge you to let everything go because we we have some hard cases to pray for this morning. And before we pray for the hard cases, before we pray for the children, before we go into all these things, is your heart right with God this morning? Do you really want to serve God? Do you really see the value of the birthright? Do you see the value of the Holy Ghost and say, "Lord, I want the Holy Ghost. I'm not leaving here." The prophet give a testimony say, "Lord, I'm not leaving here until I get it. I don't want to go home the same way I came. I'm tired of just living. I want a reality. I want a fresh experience. I want to experience what it is to have no ought, no grudges. Just to be free, to serve, to worship, to pray, to praise, to get to fall in love with Jesus all over again. He said, "Take me back to my first love." Is there anybody wants to go back to your first love? Many hands all over the building. Oh yes, yes, yes. Talk to him right now. If you need forgiveness, say, "Lord, forgive me." You need restoration, Lord, restore me. You need deliverance, Lord, deliver me. Pass me not, oh gentle savior. Oh, hallelujah. You can begin to sing softly. [Music] I want to worship you. Hallelujah. [Music] You can go free this morning if you want to go free because [Music] my heart Lord take the pride out of my heart.

But Lord, while there's time, Lord, I want to make things right. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go home the same way I came. I don't want to take chances. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, you can make your altar where you at? Lord, I rededicate my life to you. Lord, I've not been serving you as I should, but from this day on, Lord, I want to be a true Christian. Lord, I rededicate my life to you. Lord, take away the root of bitterness, Lord. You have held the root of bitterness for long enough. &gt;&gt; Forgive this morning. Forgive. Forgive yourself. Forgive your brother. Forgive your family. Forgive anyone whoever around you. Forgive this morning. Forgive this morning. Drop your odds. Drop it this morning. Drop it this morning. Yes. When you drop it, you can go free. When you forgive, you can go free. Drop it. I don't care who did it. I don't care what it was. Drop it this morning. And watch the Lord work on your soul. Come on, you are free. Forgive. Forgive. And watch God forgive you. Forgive your brother. Forgive your sister. Forgive your children. Forgive your boss. Forgive your neighbor. [Music] Don't let anything hinder you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All over the buildings. &gt;&gt; Get your heart pure. &gt;&gt; Get your heart pure. Surrender. Surrender. Give up this morning. Give up this morning. &gt;&gt; God will judge. God will deal with his situations. You don't have to fix it. Let him fix it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not for you to fix. Let him fix it this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe you made mistakes. &gt;&gt; Maybe you think that that you that that there's no hope for you. God has forgiven you. Forgive yourself this morning and say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm coming home. Lord, I'm coming home. Lord, I'm coming home. Restore unto me the joy of my salvation." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; Talk to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why are you doing this, preacher? We want to get the atmosphere right &gt;&gt; because we have some hard cases to pray for. We don't want anything holding it back. God is able this morning to take away the root of bitterness. Your yesterday, you can't change it, but from today, drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Hallelujah. God wants to forgive you. He has forgiven you, but you got to drop what's in your heart. Oh Jesus. Hello again. I want to ship you. [Music] Lord [Music] I belong to you. [Music] Hallelujah. Pass me not. Pass me not.
