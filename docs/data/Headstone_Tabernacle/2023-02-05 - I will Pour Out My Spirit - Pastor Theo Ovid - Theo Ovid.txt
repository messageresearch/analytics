Marine so we believe that he always here we see the Holy Spirit making manifest the same thing like he did when he was here before bless these dear people father I pray be down near them give them life eternal granted Lord I commit them down to thee in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ okay let's go the Holy Spirit was poured out in their Pentecost Acts 2 tell us about that when the day of Pentecost was fully come there with one mind one Accord and all of a sudden all of a sudden something happened a managed to take a book and break they see you saw them no no no Jesus already openly understanding already he openly you're with them already something happened Hallelujah the tongues of fire comma everybody get your portion something Came Upon them upon them it was not Minister explaining a revelation explaining a mystery something happened within them and they were filled come on that's the word that's they were hell still not with head knowledge fill not with understanding filled up with Mysteries they were filled with the Holy Ghost that means the Holy Ghost could fill if they can sell them it could fail me if they can sell them they can fail you if they call them they could sell whosoever will oh can the Lord I praise I hope God make it real to you this evening they were filled with it it was inside of them you ever fill a glass with milk over juice you pour it and you pour it and you pour it God pour something into them it was God above us in the form of the pillar of fire it was God With Us in the form of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost brought God into them Oh Glory the god you could never walk the same if God stepped inside of you or give the Lord a shout in the house so the Holy Ghost was poured out under their Pentecost 1906. holy ghost spot out because what God was bringing out the church from Luther after the Catholic Church killed 68 million Christians and the Christians went down to the ground and Satan thought it was Stone dead God took a priest named Martin Luther out of the Catholic church and God turned into his soul to just shall live by faith and God is going to bring the church out by justification true loser standing against you Wesley and 1906 the Pentecostal area was ripe for the open door age for the Holy Ghost to step into it no messenger no man is there no man controlling this thing no 1906 had no man inside of it it had a man who was a rocket but there was no man into that age it was the open door the Holy Ghost came through that door nobody was controlling that door no pork man no message man no interpretation man no intellectual man it was the age of the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost season about a break God was waiting for Luther Wesley and then come the Holy Ghost because they take a spirit atmosphere where they release a prophet up in the word o Give the Lord a shout now the people that receive Holy Ghost 1906 they were not seed they were shocked that was the Pentecostal age because the world have to make a seed and the prophet didn't come yet so our age was bloated by Spirit but not by word okay the Lord I shout did you get what I'm saying now a whole age was builted by Spirit but not by word 1946 God called a prophet Angel of the Lord met him as John the Baptist isn't that right angel of God met him and God give him a message and that Mercy was to bring the seed to bring a bride or give the Lord a shout that is where you come in somebody had was to receive this bright call somebody had to receive this message and you are here today because you responded to this oh give the Lord I shout glory to God you may be seated now once you say seed you have to look at sower once you see sore you have to know who has to come back son of man son of man is the sword of the good seed look something that is reveals that even though shall be in the day that the son of man is revealed so God make sure the promise of son of man has to be in this time to reveal the seed and the seed after the Bible has to be the Bible in you which is the Original Seed which is the spoken word itself so God revealed to a prophet a son of man the son of man with your original seed to bring forth a bride do you believe that so therefore that Pentecostal was the shock because they rejected the Malachi for Prophet that have the seed oh my here we go are you ready now what about him we cannot have the last day until people get in the spirit of the last day so the last day have a last day spirit and when the people get into the last day Spirit we know we're living over the last day so we have lasted by prophecy last day by word and lasted by spirit here we go we cannot have hidden service here until the people gets in the spirit of a healing service we cannot have a feeling of the Holy Ghost until people get in that kind of atmosphere and the people was in the atmosphere in the day to bring judgment upon the Earth Oh Glory to God hallelujah oh glory to God could we take some more so therefore the feeling so if the preacher is not preaching about the Holy Ghost and the fellow goes how on Earth could the people get the Holy Ghost the bunch of dead intellectuals sitting down thousands and thousands in this message no wonder the bride had not Revival yet no one that will take the seven Thunders to wake up the pride because the seven donors have to have the Holy Ghost bring the Holy Ghost right back into the church we'll give the Lord Our Praise Give the Lord a shout the devil's a liar oh God we will preach done us more than ever before now Beat the Devil with them Thunders live voice actor shake the devil praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God Destiny is a bright thing you know another church thing you know church can I preach this you know it's not the bride have to bring this little because the pride of the money says this you know your word had to become flesh in you you know for the world to become invisible to become visible the world had to become flesh inside of you you know fire to come and brand that word inside of you foreign Commandments when they had it the visuals Fire coming and said Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt men steal and fire was right in the words in the Rock but that fire the right inside of you oh Chloe the cord right inside of your heart and when God right inside you no devil could that's your written word Oh Glory to call your cat oh glory to God the Holy Ghost is the unwritten word look on this Oh Glory to God be not moving from this we're not moving from this or when a church is believing that the same holy ghost that they had it in their Pentecost is just as real we don't want a new Holy Ghost we wanted the Holy Ghost and silence we don't all acquired Holy Ghost whatever Holy Ghost he had back there we want that same kind that staggering one that shaken one oh that look one Higher looking drunk acting drunk we want that time okay the Lord has shout in all glory to God we want that I know Holy Ghost all right let's go watch bilan bilham at seven Alters seven rounds both have altars Moses altars as fundamental as one was the other one was also but who did God vindicate you see the one that was in his word fundamental doesn't mean too much is the revelation of God so the books doesn't mean much if you have no Revelation it are people listening and reading and what are listening they're in the word there's no revelation they are clueless they have passed the clueless and and they have the conversation congression through let's do it totally clueless preaching topics and interests and regarding no vision no real divine revelation nobody could shake you off in your divine revelation you hear something I'll show you off it was off long time yes waiting to get tilt because Jesus said Upon This Rock I not some money I will build my church and the case of Hell God called me when I was 17 years old and everybody my family was Catholic and nobody could change even a rock that God revealed to me that was a revelation I went against the grain of family everything to stay with this word and get baptized in Jesus name I'm not Devon hell could take me over this path he didn't put me on he can't take me off he didn't call me come on call me he didn't anoint me Captain I don't care about no management I'd say no man out the trainers have nothing to do with what they say I have to do with what God Said and then God coming to preach the gospel I'm going to preach it Oh Glory to God I'm gonna preach it till fire hit the camp until the Holy Ghost pour out until the Revival in the church I'm gonna preach it praise God I'll lose my teeth I've used my gums my whole preach it oh God help me if I lose all my black hair and I get bald and then I will still preach it oh God I have to hear God damn man oh Gloria who don't like it that is the business who leave leave who gone gone who God sent God's hand but there is gonna be a bunch of people that are going to catch Revelation or glory to God they have a bunch of people upon whom we're gonna put his Spirit somebody have to be here to receive his Spirit he said I will pour out oh glory to God no man doing nothing I will pour out my spirit okay the Lord I shout what if it's today what it is now what if it's you whatever is here okay the Lord I shout in the house Oh Glory to God glory God young men shall see Visions all men child dream dreams oh dear the Lord I shout them young men not Escape him God going after them somebody got to see Vision somebody got a dream dreams someday Court Glory Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] don't think these men why was they calling put in this condition these Pharisees by Jesus he said in vain you worship me you worship genuine worship through worship from the heart but in vain teaching for Doctrine the tradition of men therefore you make the Commandments of God on no effect that's what I'm saying God tell him when he says in the message meeting I said I ain't coming this message I hear a man preach your own thoughts I am wondered for me and I am one of my people I don't care about your Revelation if you care preach what the prophet preached and you he use his message as a flavoring for your Revelation away with you I have nothing to do with that this world has to become effective [Applause] without the flavor of the pepper sauce but nothing this would have everything in it the only reason and some people stuck at reverse intensive and it is before it is the voice yeah the voice said no go to the angel and say what give me what the book do what with it watch it eat it and then what it shall be sweet in your mouth bit on your belly because Thomas prophesy every service and brother Anthony was inspired this morning he said that is what we have been doing my God I love it I love it I love it we have been prophesying every service is prophecy over ahead the devil is finished over your life you have a prophecy hanging over your head Wednesday night Sunday every time you come it's prophecy everybody it's you to believe it and anointed is you to believe it and claim it if you don't believe it and walk in it but prophecy hanging over your head may be seated praise God what do you mean problems are going to help like see me go tell him you shall I see death Tennessee Lord Christ there's a prophecy hanging over here they gave my old richer to rock on to stay home that they don't come to church it was too far you say you say God revealed to me Temple so every Sunday even if he come late he's still coming if he comes slow he's still coming he's still coming because you know Messiah to come inside there one day God will feel like the Simeon all Simeon see man wasn't coming speeding speeding no he crawling into church but he comes still because he under expectation God promised the power of His Spirit and the last day I'll poured my spirit he no other Spirit gonna come you know one day we'll be talking standing and love will come in the building and all the evil will be taken out that's a prophecy hanging over the church I don't care what's inside your heart love with the drop down one of these days and take all the evil out love shall cover and mold you the sins oh give the Lord a praise I don't know what any heart what kind of devils might be the anger hatred malice lust meanness stinginess all kind of crazy stuff inside of you I don't care to know what's inside of you I want to know what's getting out okay the Lord I shout out to go out and go out and go out and go has to go out jealousy Envy hatred praise God praise God Hallelujah I thought I was a nice loving caring good believer so I never know I love enemies but I have I didn't make them they become that Hallelujah so I'm not so nice as I thought but praise God if you follow Jesus the devil could be mad but that's a must have somebody who don't like you I'll hate you they they hate Jews without a cause you know the only cause was no cause it doesn't put them something is one thing but I do that and die why you hate me but I can't do anything and you have a spirit of dislike there's that evil spirit history Without a Cause I don't know why I don't like him but I don't like him but he's brought you God love him cheerfulness means love of God friend of God so so be careful with God's friend praise the name of the Lord all right so watch this hear this bum if I taught you a metal this message it would take no effect on you this is bright time if Moses taught a message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because yeah why the predestinated seed laying dear that will only be watered by the type of water that is good for that seed so the seed inside of you when he was in Baptist when he was playing pan when he was feeling wrong there was a season side of you and he only watered the water that wasn't Baptist Methodist your witness Hindu Muslim Buddha it wasn't that it was this word that way when they would hit you something you have to respond because this and your seed connect Oh Glory to God the first message I heard I think was why Christ speak that when I listened the whole message but that's me do you believe this question I say yes I do the first message I fly spirit I just flap I mean listen their mother chickens couldn't couldn't hold me back as soon as I hear the voice and I heard that word I fly straight to the Catholic Church couldn't help it tell my mother I said I want to go with them she said can't I Cry literally cry and then that was insult then they got opportunity to go Johnny to do electrical engineering technician and I zoom up to go Jandy and that was World wanted me separate from down there I call him and tell him I get my pleasure in Jesus name I was completely separated from mother from family praise God praise God you talking about the call of God when God put a call upon your life like something else touched by God [Applause] so when you see her get that connection man shrinks in front of you because man don't have a heaven or hell they have grumpy voice yeah attracting and try to bring fair but you don't have a Heavenly over hell because God put a call upon you and the one that started the working you started started started a couple of servers are back we broke but Anchor Point it's when you're slipping and sliding you have to be an anchor make it put back your hand your foot and say you know what God did for me here sometimes your mind fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy but when you go all back fall back you have a fallback position that's the Anchor Point I remember that night when God spoke to me I remember when God revealed me I remember and when you look back and died did everything that moved back now because they were trying to move forward and if God did that yeah he could do this here if God could that yeah he could do this here if God moved my finger he could move my hand he called me with my hand he could move my foot Oh Glory the God if God opened this door he could open another door because he is still away maker who give the Lord I shout if God help her to pay one bill he can never pay more bills and bigger bills or give the Lord some Praises Glory the court so watch the predestinated seed I lay in there that will only be watered by the type of water that's given for that seed it won't grow any other conditions it must be the condition that it grows in then you talk about the chicken an egg hatch under anything the atmosphere and something like that then it comes to Pentecost 1906. no the Pentecostal that brother I believe one of his eyes was out a colored brother who really started the Pentecostal message in California all Azusa Street he was laughed at because he was a negro and in them days had racism big time so the races are wrong you're black one eye somebody say pressure that is true that was plenty pressure he was made fun of but he bought a message that age just a little buddy a fellow could hardly sign his own name but the Lord here we go have revealed to him that this was the age of the restoration of those gifts so it couldn't come on the Luther inspiration or Wesley inspiration this is the spirit is about a break this is the open door about a break and therefore somebody get a revelation hey gifts coming back you know speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues wisdom healing it coming back pressure and I believe it coming back God give me a Revolution coming back what did he do just talking coming back listen what he did but the Lord revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of those gifts and they come no matter what said it come but are you ready everybody got in the atmosphere of it and seen it was the age and seeing God Vindicated that those people could speak in tongues and so forth then it happened what they do they got in the atmosphere of it and if there's a Dynamics promise it is a latter rain promise if it is I will put my spirit promise we have to get in the atmosphere that's why brother Anthony wasn't Amber Anthony it was the Holy Ghost say worship give God praise oh it wasn't him it was God he said worship precedes the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's correct and students sanctification and worship oh give the Lord Our Praise glory to God you live Sanctified and you come here and open your mouth not to feel it's a sacrifice when you say hallelujah praise God you're doing something that you will not normally do [Applause] let me see if God just hit something here with a brown the terribility of the Lord shall come remember Malachi for the message come to the terrible day of the Lord shall come burn up the whole earth and the righteous shall walk up to me as of the wicked that never happened after John no we got two thousand years since then the world hasn't burned since not at all neither is the righteous walking on the ashes of the wicked but we are still waiting are you ready for that something that's going to take the faith and restore the faith of the children back to the original Pentecostal tree that they can't go and eat up all their denomination create please eat up go outside I'll restore it again and it will be restored it will be restored how how God shall send the Holy Ghost in such a way upon planted word that it will restore God will send holios upon planted work so that is what the ministers were supposed to do plant this red Oh Glory to God because the secret is what the word is in the bread then somebody must have been pumping that word to plant it into you and then God now I will Port it shall come to pass afterwards I will pour out Oh Glory the god part my spirit upon what upon planted wood okay the Lord I pray they'll never praise God before this is the time to praise him Glory Glory Glory do you see it do you see it now we are going to be the Harvest of Williams branham's message we are going to vindicate Malachi for

was five years he was married and she was 10 years it was always married it is always you able to cut if that don't make you shout today I don't know what will foreign [Applause] so when the angel when the time was right the angel came as a Hail Mary that was highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are tall among women you are going to manifest Messiah you're gonna pray for the Christ you're gonna pray for the anointed okay the Lord I shout in the house for Glory love God hallelujah hallelujah watch this Mary is in the spirit because when Mary heard it she knew Isaiah scripture she had no idea nine six she said be it done unto me unto me not unto my neighbor unto me oh God help me it's the individual it's not for this one and that one you have to say be it done unto me according to Thy Word Mario after that what after that you see little I thought she only had one question not to not three just one how shall this thing be and the only one answer for that the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost oh we've written on brother so I saw no no Holy Ghost oh oh we have a prophet no no Holy Ghost oh we have a man of the hour no no Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee oh give the Lord a shout and I am prophesying this evening the Holy Ghost has gone to overshadow you for Glory to God and quick enough where inside of you that we're gonna be made fresh [Music] all right [Applause] Peter said under the appendix he said this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel shall come the Pastor said God I put my spirit Upon Our flesh and when he preached under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and the people were shouting and making demonstration they were pricked in their hearts that the Jews understand the Bible said men and breaded what shall we do to be saved and Peter said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you unto your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord of God shall call Ing and then he said what did he mean in case it have some Pastor whoever explanation different from that you have the answer for this year he said what did he mean then he answers the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was poured out under their Pentacles that was what does he want me to talk about it no other one the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was poured out under Pentecost was to be to you and to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call if that change knowledge interchange no time it is the same all glory to God let's continue the best witness that we have that we got the Holy Ghost is when our spirit Bears record with the word if we call ourselves Christians and say we are filled with the spirit and we see that the baptism of the holy spirit is poured out on the Believers for all ages for what for what for all ages and our spirit tell us that's for another age he said you're wrong so those baptism messages wrong when you believe it you receive it they're wrong it has to be poured out no intellectual knowledge will pull you away from it but the holy spirit will say Amen to his own weight he certainly will and he is seeking and hunting and trying to find someone that he can put himself into as long as you find it oh my Hallelujah oh my almost done all right yeah doing a good time all right so then all right shark was just getting in me okay now there are lots of times when many of us Pentecostals has made a mistake and think well the Holy Ghost is put upon me glory to God has only have to have no sin you are just then getting started it's your test and your trial watch this character is not a gift correct is a victory that's why after this day Pentecostal said backslidden yeah with gifts and all kinds of things like that they still saw and begging for money they can't change right now nothing die Holier watch this but if they had received the word like how we saw I received the word the word will bring you to your place of trying that should be tested and the testing on the trance is what brings on character formation blessings don't change people if the wicked and they get blessed are still Wicked if the stingy and me and they get blessed they still singing me with all the blessing God they kept running over the systems if they're selfish they're still so trials change people heart attack change people fire change people disappointments tells people obsess and problems change people not blessings amen it's really true you can say bless I'm blessed to be stressed you're getting stressed to get blessed [Music] now if your spirit pulling back on this word here you know what then you need God here oh yes everybody want the easy way oh yes easy way but Jesus lent obedience by the thing that he suffered Jesus suffer you know you don't want to suffer but he suffered he suffered be suffered he paid a price and he suffered us expect the warfree almost done missions to get ready to come you cannot make a holy church and people like to know the church we better than them in every church have three kinds of one kind they know what kind is they have a higher temperature oh this is bright non-brite bright bright bright God didn't put the power of that in men that way it take God to choose if Peter if Peter was given the choice to choose disciples for Jesus you know who he called all your friends and family you know he wasn't called Mercury tax collector who beat him for attacks Peter was going to call his friends and family but then Jesus passing wrong said Matthew come and Peter look at that he said good Lord is he the taxman yeah the taxman Jesus called who he wanted or when he just said turn around greet somebody he's either turn wrong behind him they'll think twice but Jesus Hallelujah Glory he doesn't want to look Matthew I Hallelujah Glory but you can't think so shaking hands and Jesus showing that I am doing the calling you are to do the loving and forgiven [Applause] I think that word saying again they call him but you have to do the loving and forgiven so by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when when when when you have loved one for another I can't make you love your brother but I'm telling you how you're going to be my disciple Oh Glory to God the disciple must be with your love you're watching what kind of love is that that's what I love let me finish you don't want to get to you cannot make a holy church beat him with legalism you can't make it here's why there is no such a thing as a holy church the Holy Spirit can be preached in it but in there you find God I'm bad and renegades in different and everything else so an organization cannot hold the Holy Ghost are you ready the holy spirit is poured out on individuals if that don't make you listen I will come hang on shot for you you know you know what that means nobody could stop you from getting the Holy Ghost come on to me now I know certain things in order what God wants us to rule them everyone together and have our old-fashioned Holy Ghost pouring out on the whole church everywhere a gathering a meeting I get them together I have an old-fashioned Holy Ghost point out he said what we need today brother is to bring every believer together the gospel don't hold back anything back but preach the full gospel of Christ until until the baptism of the Holy Ghost is poured out upon all the church [Applause] bring your Mysteries but when you bring it bring the Holy Ghost with it too oh Gloria but I've taken a message with the Holy Ghost I'm taking the word with the Holy Ghost I'm taking all your preaching and teaching if you want to press play Break pressure play and bring your Holy Ghost too but if you press and play don't stop me from bringing the Holy Ghost when I'm preaching the gospel because Jesus commissioned his disciples go into all the world I'm not press play preach the gospel the every creature oh give the Lord a shout in the house preach the full gospel of Christ until the baptism of Holy Ghost is pour out upon all the church and that's the only way to have a Revival I'm almost done here now you see Jesus had proven to God that he had been the right kind of a son and God took him up into the mountain and brought Witnesses out there Heavenly Witnesses that's dead and what a supernatural something taking place his garments glisten like the sun in the middle of the day and as white as they could be God placed on him the Rope of immortality showed that he had received him are you ready now that's the thing that God will do to his son see on Earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it and he he will place into the church when before the coming of Jesus Christ he will place into the church then he breaks in here all the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God was he poured into Jesus all that Jesus was he pours into the church God wanting his work done he sent it into his son his son wanted the work done he sent it into the church at that day you will know I'm in the Father the father in me I in you you and me at that day because the same power same power of God that was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ and the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest in the placed sons in the body of Christ Oh Glory to God praise another son take him out a certain place have a ceremony before Angels place them positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority then you begin to prophesy let me say this if you called me to be a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in now now I have to believe it I have to claim it I have to walk in it there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit will soar anoint the people [Applause] you just said to pass there you know anoint the people they will speak the word and it'll create they said right there we haven't seen power like coming to church now spirit [Music] Oh Glory to God say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt any heart but believe what you said that shall come to pass you can have what you said the placing of the church in position what position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church damn critics mode will be shot it will be a short time Jesus Christ come right off the mountain when shita Calvary notice it won't last long but it will be here forget the critics don't even criticize them and I take we here to the final quote begin to play something final quote on Jesus but Obama's praying father so it is now at the near coming of Jesus again just like the vine if the vine puts forth uh the Holy Ghost and signs and wonders of fruits follow that branch and if that vine ever put another Branch it would be the same kind of Branch we know that father by Nature itself but we do know that you can graft any fruit that's pertained into that into the vine it will live by Divine and we know we can take orange tree and grow citrus fruits of different kinds segment we can put lemons in it it'll grow right on it's such as fruit it's grow grapefruit any other tangerine and so but if that tree brings forth a branch its own Branch again it will be orange Lord it'll be like the first one was here we go prophecy and we believe that there is to be a church in these last days that will receive both former and laterine it will be scattered throughout the world in this loud recent age it will be a church that's called back to the original faith in God it will be a church that I have Jesus Christ walking in it manifesting himself the shout of the king will be in it let's all stand and give us some Praises I'm finishes even father God I pray that
