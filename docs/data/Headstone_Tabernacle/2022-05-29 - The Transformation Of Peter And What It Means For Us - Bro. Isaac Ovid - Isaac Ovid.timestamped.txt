[58:00] thank you brother anthony i'd like to
[58:01] greet you this morning
[58:03] in the precious name of our lord jesus
[58:05] christ certainly a great privilege
[58:07] to be gathered one more time in his
[58:09] presence it's not something we could
[58:11] ever take for granted and we know that
[58:14] this will one day come to an end
[58:16] and there will be a last service
[58:18] there'll be a last song there'll be a
[58:20] last opening of the scriptures
[58:23] because churches will be shut down and
[58:25] worship as we know it will no longer be
[58:28] available so while we have this
[58:29] opportunity
[58:31] and while there's still a time for a
[58:33] transformation of your heart and your
[58:35] soul we want to redeem the time as it
[58:38] were and take full advantage for the
[58:40] moment that we have together in his
[58:42] presence and for the grace that he has
[58:44] given to us so we could be honed and
[58:46] shaped
[58:47] into
[58:48] fit into this great image that he is
[58:50] creating is that how you feel this
[58:52] morning
[58:53] so if you have your bibles i'd like to
[58:54] go to
[58:55] first peter and second peter for
[58:57] scripture readings this morning
[58:58] certainly want to appreciate but over it
[59:00] for the prayer meeting on friday night
[59:03] and last sunday's service and how the
[59:05] world has been unfolding uh brother
[59:07] anthony before that such a tremendous
[59:09] time in the presence
[59:11] amen
[59:12] so first peter uh chapter two and
[59:15] reading from verse five
[59:19] he also as lively stones are built up
[59:23] a spiritual house
[59:25] and holy priesthood to offer up
[59:27] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god
[59:30] by jesus christ
[59:32] wherefore also it is contained in the
[59:35] scripture behold i lay in zion a chief
[59:38] cornerstone elect
[59:40] precious and he that believeth on him
[59:42] shall not be
[59:44] confounded
[59:45] unto you therefore which believe he is
[59:48] precious is he precious to you this
[59:49] morning but unto them which be
[59:51] disobedient the stone which the builders
[59:53] disallow the same is made the head of
[59:55] the corner and a stone of stumbling and
[59:59] a stone and a rock of offense
[1:00:01] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:00:03] being disobedient whereunto also they
[1:00:06] were appointed
[1:00:07] but ye are a chosen generation
[1:00:10] a royal priesthood and holy nation a
[1:00:13] peculiar people that you should show for
[1:00:15] the praise of him
[1:00:17] who had called you out of darkness into
[1:00:19] his marvelous light which in time passed
[1:00:21] to another people but are now the people
[1:00:23] of god which had not obtained mercy but
[1:00:26] now have obtained mercy but anthony you
[1:00:28] could have them just lower the volume in
[1:00:30] the monitors that's where the feedback
[1:00:32] is coming from thank you
[1:00:34] let's go to second peter one
[1:00:36] and reading from verse one
[1:00:39] simon peter a servant
[1:00:42] and an apostle of jesus christ to them
[1:00:44] that have obtained light precious faith
[1:00:46] with us
[1:00:47] through the righteousness of god and our
[1:00:50] savior jesus christ
[1:00:52] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:00:54] through the knowledge of god and of
[1:00:55] jesus our lord according as his divine
[1:00:58] power have given unto us all things that
[1:01:01] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:01:05] the knowledge of him that had called us
[1:01:06] to glory and virtue
[1:01:08] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:01:11] great and precious promises that by
[1:01:13] these he might be partakers of the
[1:01:15] divine nature having escaped the
[1:01:17] corruption that is in the world through
[1:01:19] lust and besides this giving all
[1:01:21] diligence out to your fate virtue and to
[1:01:24] virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:01:26] temperance and to temperance patience
[1:01:28] and to patience godliness and to
[1:01:30] godliness broadly kindness and to
[1:01:32] broadly kindness charity for if these
[1:01:34] things be in you and abound they make
[1:01:37] you that he shall neither be barren nor
[1:01:39] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[1:01:41] jesus christ but he that lacketh these
[1:01:44] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[1:01:47] and had forgotten that he was purged
[1:01:49] from his old sins
[1:01:50] wherefore the rather brethren give
[1:01:52] diligence to make your calling and
[1:01:54] election sure
[1:01:56] for if you do these things ye shall
[1:01:58] never fall what a statement never fall
[1:02:02] for so an intron shall be ministered
[1:02:04] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:02:06] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[1:02:09] christ wherefore i will not be negligent
[1:02:12] and that's how i feel this morning to
[1:02:14] put you always in remembrance of these
[1:02:16] things
[1:02:17] though we know them though ye know them
[1:02:20] and be established in the present truth
[1:02:22] so we are having a reminder service this
[1:02:25] morning yeah i think it meet
[1:02:28] peter is saying yeah i think it is fit i
[1:02:30] think it is right that word meet means
[1:02:32] fit or right or correct or appropriate
[1:02:34] or relevant or accurate yeah i think it
[1:02:37] meet as long as i am in this tabernacle
[1:02:40] as long as i am in this flesh as long as
[1:02:42] i am present with you to stir you up by
[1:02:45] putting you in remembrance
[1:02:47] knowing that shortly i must put off this
[1:02:49] my tabernacle in other words i'm going
[1:02:51] to transfer houses soon
[1:02:53] even as our lord jesus christ had showed
[1:02:55] me moreover i will endeavor that he may
[1:02:59] be able after my decease
[1:03:01] to have these things always in
[1:03:03] remembrance for we have not followed
[1:03:05] cunningly devised fables when we made
[1:03:07] known unto you the power and coming of
[1:03:10] our lord jesus christ but were
[1:03:12] eyewitnesses of his majesty may the lord
[1:03:15] at a blessing to the reading of his word
[1:03:17] you may be seated this morning
[1:03:19] in the presence of the lord and we thank
[1:03:21] god to be here
[1:03:24] in fellowship
[1:03:26] tomorrow is a holiday
[1:03:28] a national holiday so we could relax
[1:03:32] we could get into the spirit
[1:03:35] we don't have to rush and do anything at
[1:03:37] all
[1:03:38] you could delay thinking about work till
[1:03:40] tomorrow evening
[1:03:41] you don't have to do it this evening go
[1:03:43] there's no work tomorrow everybody
[1:03:45] feeling fine
[1:03:47] so i have a title this morning
[1:03:49] the transformation of peter
[1:03:52] and what it means for us
[1:03:55] the transformation of peter
[1:03:58] and what it means for us and an
[1:04:00] inspiration the shaping of a stone
[1:04:03] and the prophecy of lively stones
[1:04:07] the transformation of peter and what it
[1:04:10] means for us i truly believe that
[1:04:13] scripture and the word
[1:04:15] is supposed to be relevant
[1:04:18] to us
[1:04:20] it is not just scripture in a context of
[1:04:22] it is there to be just studied or
[1:04:25] learned or understood or known it must
[1:04:28] be relevant to us
[1:04:30] the scripture is for a purpose to help
[1:04:33] us
[1:04:34] the scriptures and the word is for a
[1:04:36] purpose to change us
[1:04:38] and you have to see every time you come
[1:04:40] to service it is because a change is
[1:04:43] part of the program so the
[1:04:45] transformation of peter it's important
[1:04:47] to know it understand it appreciate it
[1:04:50] celebrate it acknowledge it dig into it
[1:04:52] but it must have a relevance to us so i
[1:04:55] just didn't want to speak on the
[1:04:56] transformation of peter but what does it
[1:04:59] mean for us is that how you feel this
[1:05:01] morning
[1:05:02] because we just read two scriptures in
[1:05:05] the books of peter the letters of peter
[1:05:07] from first peter and second peter and
[1:05:10] they both speak of a certain kind of
[1:05:12] quality of a man who is speaking there
[1:05:15] in eight chapters through first peter
[1:05:18] and second peter five in this first
[1:05:20] letter and three in the second letter
[1:05:22] the peter who is speaking there is a
[1:05:23] changed man
[1:05:25] he's a different man he has been through
[1:05:27] some stuff that allows him to speak a
[1:05:30] certain way
[1:05:31] he has been through some stuff to make
[1:05:34] him an authority to speak to wives and
[1:05:36] to speak to children and to speak to
[1:05:38] elders and to speak to the church and to
[1:05:40] speak to those who are weak and speak to
[1:05:42] those who are strong and to remind them
[1:05:45] whether they be jews or gentiles in
[1:05:47] first peter he opens by saying peter an
[1:05:50] apostle of jesus christ to the strangers
[1:05:53] scattered through pontus galatia
[1:05:55] cappadocia asia and pistoner elect
[1:05:58] according to the full knowledge of god
[1:06:00] the father he knew what he was speaking
[1:06:02] about because he knew he was elected
[1:06:05] he knows what being elected feels like
[1:06:08] he knows what being elected looks like
[1:06:11] he can recognize somebody who is elected
[1:06:14] so don't tell me when you look at me or
[1:06:16] you look at your brother you look at
[1:06:17] your sister you cannot acknowledge that
[1:06:19] there's something about them and the
[1:06:21] hand of god is upon them
[1:06:25] so peter was clear in his delivery in
[1:06:28] his writing in his communication in what
[1:06:31] he was sending out that this gospel is
[1:06:33] not for everybody oh if it would be for
[1:06:36] everybody that's wonderful but then
[1:06:38] everybody will receive it because this
[1:06:40] stone this rejected stone is a stumbling
[1:06:43] block for some people it's an offense
[1:06:46] for some people some people can handle
[1:06:48] it but there's an elect group of people
[1:06:51] that this is everything to them it is
[1:06:53] their truth it is their comfort it is
[1:06:56] their joy it is their foundation it is
[1:06:59] their goal it is their objective it is
[1:07:01] their desire it is their zeal it is
[1:07:04] their passion it is their enthusiasm
[1:07:06] it's what woke them up this morning it's
[1:07:09] what keeps them alive it's what change
[1:07:11] your work change your talk it's what
[1:07:13] makes you worship it what make you
[1:07:15] overlook your issues and overlook the
[1:07:17] problems and overlook the stresses
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:22] this rejected stone this headstone this
[1:07:26] stone that man couldn't put in place
[1:07:28] that became the cornerstone the chief
[1:07:30] stone chief shepherd that peter would
[1:07:33] speak about anybody feeling fine this
[1:07:35] morning
[1:07:35] [Applause]
[1:07:38] if i get just a little more in the
[1:07:39] monitors that will be great
[1:07:41] so we're building into something and
[1:07:42] we're gonna have a little time this
[1:07:44] morning as we go through the world this
[1:07:45] morning so buckle your seats belt in not
[1:07:48] to sit and relax well we're gonna be in
[1:07:50] for a ride because we came to experience
[1:07:52] a journey whenever god met somebody it
[1:07:55] was on a journey he was on the way to
[1:07:57] somewhere he was on the way to somewhere
[1:07:59] somebody was in a way to somewhere and
[1:08:01] somehow it was the encounter of a
[1:08:03] journey so you're on your way to your
[1:08:05] next step in your journey and on the way
[1:08:07] god is meeting you this morning can the
[1:08:10] church say man
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:18] the transformation of peter and what it
[1:08:20] means for us
[1:08:21] i find this to be very encouraging as a
[1:08:23] subject as a thought as a theme i've
[1:08:26] always said it's very difficult to
[1:08:27] identify in scripture a favorite
[1:08:30] character it is very difficult to find
[1:08:32] somebody who you can say that's my
[1:08:34] favorite it's because everyone has their
[1:08:36] place
[1:08:36] even if it's for one minute
[1:08:38] even if there's a one second in
[1:08:40] scripture like that man who carried a
[1:08:42] cross of jesus when jesus couldn't carry
[1:08:44] it no more his role may not have been
[1:08:46] five years or five months it was for a
[1:08:49] few moments but he carried the cross of
[1:08:52] jesus
[1:08:54] how could you place his role above
[1:08:56] someone else's each person's role in
[1:08:59] this journey in this story is so
[1:09:01] important so relevant so necessary you
[1:09:04] have no idea the impact of different
[1:09:06] people who touch your life
[1:09:08] in a simple way maybe your word maybe an
[1:09:10] encouragement maybe a note maybe you're
[1:09:13] just a god bless you was enough and you
[1:09:15] are here today because all of these
[1:09:17] things worked together for good work
[1:09:20] together because behind the scenes
[1:09:22] there's a author a designer a conductor
[1:09:26] an architect
[1:09:29] bringing the pieces
[1:09:32] together
[1:09:35] but the reality is there are some
[1:09:37] characters in scripture for whom we have
[1:09:39] more information than others
[1:09:42] so i've always said for me
[1:09:44] in the old testament david speaks out to
[1:09:46] me
[1:09:47] i just love david because we see him as
[1:09:49] a boy we see him as a shepherd we see
[1:09:52] him as a king we see him in depression
[1:09:54] we see him in frustration we see him in
[1:09:56] anger we see him crying we see him
[1:09:58] stressed out we see him overwhelmed
[1:10:02] and god can say that's a man after my
[1:10:04] own heart
[1:10:06] because i know i have my struggles and i
[1:10:08] know you do too and we can identify in
[1:10:10] the life of david moments in our lives
[1:10:13] when we feel weak and we feel down and
[1:10:15] we feel rejected and we feel upset and
[1:10:17] we feel like giving up but when we look
[1:10:19] into the scripture and see the life of
[1:10:21] david we could say oh as the heart
[1:10:23] punted after the water brook so my soul
[1:10:25] turns after me many a day that rise up
[1:10:28] against me we can find something in
[1:10:30] there
[1:10:32] that can remind us
[1:10:35] to keep pushing
[1:10:36] to keep pressing
[1:10:38] to keep fighting to keep holding on to
[1:10:40] keep the flag flying to not look back to
[1:10:43] not give up and even if you stumble you
[1:10:45] could get back up
[1:10:47] again
[1:10:49] can the church say amen
[1:10:52] for me in the new testament it is peter
[1:10:56] because peter is all over the new
[1:10:58] testament
[1:11:00] jesus had different disciples and some
[1:11:02] you don't hear much about but peter
[1:11:04] oh my brother peter
[1:11:07] first to respond
[1:11:09] first to do this first to do that and
[1:11:12] peter is very open with his issues
[1:11:15] i can identify with peter peter was
[1:11:17] excitable peter would boldly make
[1:11:20] mistakes there was a time and i'll get
[1:11:21] it when jesus just ignore him
[1:11:23] because that's just peter can the church
[1:11:26] say amen
[1:11:27] but i want to just
[1:11:30] paint a picture and then we want to go
[1:11:32] back into history a bit and kind of
[1:11:33] connect the dots
[1:11:35] i want to dramatize the way the prophet
[1:11:37] would that time so
[1:11:39] it was a long night
[1:11:42] a difficult night
[1:11:46] peter felt overwhelmed
[1:11:48] there was a lot he didn't understand
[1:11:51] there was a lot he was trying to figure
[1:11:52] out
[1:11:53] he just couldn't make sense of it all
[1:11:56] things that he thought was
[1:11:58] real suddenly seemed to have fallen
[1:12:00] apart
[1:12:02] a few moments before a few hours before
[1:12:04] he invited a few of his friends to go
[1:12:07] with him to go fishing
[1:12:09] seven of them
[1:12:11] went fishing that night
[1:12:13] as a way maybe to pass the time
[1:12:16] maybe it was just a comfort zone maybe
[1:12:18] for him it was just a way to try to get
[1:12:20] back to familiar ground
[1:12:22] it had been maybe three and a half years
[1:12:24] since he had gone fishing
[1:12:27] it was not something he did yesterday or
[1:12:28] last week or last month or last year
[1:12:30] because he had left that life
[1:12:33] and the purpose he had left at life had
[1:12:35] suddenly felt like it crumbled apart
[1:12:38] not only that in his ascension in his
[1:12:40] growing and in his maturity
[1:12:43] he had made a great mistake
[1:12:46] i can imagine peter's there maybe we
[1:12:48] don't know what thought he had that
[1:12:50] night
[1:12:50] but a whole night is a long time to not
[1:12:53] sleep
[1:12:54] and when you're going through a night of
[1:12:56] not sleeping your mind will bring back
[1:12:59] things to you that are bothering you
[1:13:01] anybody ever had a night where stuff
[1:13:03] bothering you and as you struggle to
[1:13:05] sleep it's not the irrelevant stuff that
[1:13:08] comes to your mind it's what's important
[1:13:10] to you
[1:13:12] i wonder if peter reflected to the
[1:13:14] moment when they asked him do you know
[1:13:16] jesus
[1:13:19] and against his very best effort
[1:13:22] to say the right thing he said no
[1:13:26] and it was not just a lie
[1:13:28] it was deeper than a lie because it was
[1:13:30] a denial
[1:13:32] to lie is the twisted truth or mistell
[1:13:34] the truth
[1:13:36] but the denial brother clarence was
[1:13:39] not only am i not with that but i am not
[1:13:42] with it
[1:13:44] it is not just the untruth of i don't
[1:13:46] know what gospel is talking about but it
[1:13:48] is i'm not identified i am denying my
[1:13:51] association with this thing
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:13:56] and the bible said peter wept
[1:13:58] bitterly
[1:14:00] the bible could have said he wept
[1:14:02] but you see when descriptive words are
[1:14:04] added
[1:14:06] it brings clarity and magnitude to the
[1:14:08] deepest elements of the emotion of the
[1:14:11] man called peter
[1:14:14] because he was a man just like you and i
[1:14:16] many times and this is the fallacy with
[1:14:18] us we see scriptural characters as
[1:14:21] untouchables
[1:14:23] but god in his grace and mercy pains
[1:14:25] peter as a broken man
[1:14:28] a man who has made him mistaken as he
[1:14:30] weeps bitterly he's showing the fact
[1:14:33] that there was still part of him that
[1:14:35] was real that although he denied him
[1:14:37] there was part of him that said this is
[1:14:39] that right
[1:14:40] i know better than this i've been to too
[1:14:42] many services i saw too many miracles
[1:14:46] i've seen too much truth in this thing
[1:14:48] for me to give it all up how do i find
[1:14:51] myself in this spot
[1:14:57] i can imagine mr george during that
[1:14:59] night peter is asking himself why am i
[1:15:02] here
[1:15:02] because he had given up vision
[1:15:06] he had left it all behind
[1:15:09] and sometimes just sometimes it feels
[1:15:12] like you're back where you started
[1:15:15] and here it was peter
[1:15:16] was back in the spot as if he had just
[1:15:19] started
[1:15:20] the thing he had left three and a half
[1:15:22] years ago he found himself back there
[1:15:24] because the anchor that had propped him
[1:15:26] up and helped him and help
[1:15:29] was no longer there
[1:15:33] i don't know how many thoughts that
[1:15:34] peter had that night
[1:15:36] but maybe he started to recall
[1:15:39] amber branham did this when he was
[1:15:41] preaching what manner of man is this
[1:15:42] when they were on the boat he said maybe
[1:15:44] they were fellowshipping around what
[1:15:46] jesus preached and they were
[1:15:47] fellowshipping around the miracles that
[1:15:48] happened
[1:15:50] anybody with me
[1:15:55] peter for three and a half years
[1:15:59] he had disconnected from his occupation
[1:16:03] as a fisherman
[1:16:05] today and even more so then it's a rough
[1:16:07] profession
[1:16:09] it is not a profession run by ignorant
[1:16:11] people don't get it mixed up you have to
[1:16:13] be sharp
[1:16:14] you have to be brave
[1:16:17] the sea of galilee where peter spent
[1:16:19] most of his life fishing was a rough sea
[1:16:22] it was common to have storms
[1:16:24] it was common for your boat to turn over
[1:16:28] so as a fisherman you have to be used to
[1:16:30] the risk of going out there not sure not
[1:16:33] only if they're coming back but what
[1:16:34] you're coming back with
[1:16:37] it was
[1:16:38] used you used to be able to deal with
[1:16:39] disappointment
[1:16:43] because you could go and fish all night
[1:16:46] and not catch anything
[1:16:49] anybody with me
[1:16:51] it had been a long time peter had
[1:16:53] experienced that kind of disappointment
[1:16:56] because as each hour passed through the
[1:16:58] night brother punch and it became closer
[1:17:00] to morning
[1:17:04] it was just one hour less one hour less
[1:17:06] before light broke and when light broke
[1:17:08] it had only one thing to do you have to
[1:17:10] pack up
[1:17:12] go home
[1:17:13] and acknowledge the fact
[1:17:15] that it didn't work that night
[1:17:18] anybody with me this morning
[1:17:20] i'm painting this picture because we're
[1:17:22] at an interesting point in peter's life
[1:17:26] we are between him having three and a
[1:17:28] half years with jesus and him about to
[1:17:31] complete a transformation process that
[1:17:33] he didn't even understand
[1:17:36] but i just want to pee in this picture
[1:17:38] here before we go back to where it
[1:17:39] started
[1:17:44] this is in sin john 21
[1:17:48] verse 4
[1:17:50] but when the morning was now come jesus
[1:17:52] stood on the shore
[1:17:55] but the disciples knew not
[1:17:57] that it was jesus
[1:18:00] then jesus said unto them children have
[1:18:02] you any meat
[1:18:04] they answered him no one would think
[1:18:06] brother eccles that after three and a
[1:18:08] half years with jesus you'll recognize
[1:18:09] his voice
[1:18:14] they're people who call you without them
[1:18:15] even signaling who they are you know who
[1:18:17] they are because you know their voice
[1:18:19] you would think that after three and a
[1:18:20] half years they would say wait a minute
[1:18:22] that voice sounds familiar
[1:18:25] they answered no
[1:18:26] and he said unto them cast the net on
[1:18:28] the right side of the ship and you shall
[1:18:30] find
[1:18:32] they cast therefore and now they were
[1:18:34] not able to draw it for the multitude of
[1:18:36] fishes now this is after the crucifixion
[1:18:38] this is after the resurrection we deal
[1:18:40] with right
[1:18:41] therefore that disciple whom jesus loves
[1:18:44] say it unto peter it is the lord
[1:18:47] it took somebody to tell peter
[1:18:51] peter was dealing with so much stuff it
[1:18:53] took the disciple whom jesus loved to
[1:18:56] tell peter it is the lord
[1:18:58] no
[1:18:59] it still didn't say that peter
[1:19:01] recognized the voice he said now when
[1:19:03] simon peter heard that it was the lord
[1:19:07] it was not an individual this is the
[1:19:09] same peter who said that with the christ
[1:19:12] if it was any disciple but a stephen who
[1:19:14] could recognize peter it should be
[1:19:16] recognized jesus should be peter
[1:19:19] but peter was in a in a state
[1:19:23] anybody somebody feel like they're in a
[1:19:24] state
[1:19:28] hallelujah
[1:19:31] and that state is by design you know
[1:19:34] it's part of your transformation
[1:19:36] now when simon peter heard that it was
[1:19:39] the lord
[1:19:40] he girt his fischer's quota unto him for
[1:19:42] he was naked
[1:19:44] and i want you to just process this for
[1:19:46] a minute
[1:19:47] and did cast himself into the sea
[1:19:51] you ever you ever read this
[1:19:53] i want you to picture the drama here
[1:19:54] jesus is on the show
[1:19:56] the disciples in the boat it's already
[1:19:58] morning time
[1:20:00] jesus talking but peter don't want to
[1:20:02] think it's jesus he's not processing as
[1:20:04] jesus
[1:20:05] when john recognized and see it is the
[1:20:07] lord
[1:20:08] peter looked twice
[1:20:10] peter didn't say let's wait till the
[1:20:11] boat go in
[1:20:13] peter
[1:20:14] jumped off the boat
[1:20:16] to swim to jesus because the next verse
[1:20:18] says the other disciples came in a
[1:20:20] little ship in other words the other
[1:20:21] disciples
[1:20:22] didn't do like peter you know they say
[1:20:24] well when he both go in we'll we know
[1:20:26] he's the lord but but peter was
[1:20:28] different
[1:20:31] he raced to meet the lord because there
[1:20:33] was something in him was desiring the
[1:20:35] connection and the relationship he had
[1:20:37] with jesus
[1:20:38] so when he heard that jesus is on the
[1:20:40] show he moved like a different kind of
[1:20:42] man characteristic of peter he was
[1:20:45] impulsive
[1:20:46] he did what was in his heart he did what
[1:20:48] he felt was right there was nothing to
[1:20:50] stop and he wore his emotions on the on
[1:20:53] the cuff
[1:20:54] but god was not finished with him yet
[1:20:56] can the church say amen
[1:21:03] it had taken a long time and a number of
[1:21:06] experiences to bring peter to that spot
[1:21:08] are you with me this morning
[1:21:16] maybe peter taught to where it all began
[1:21:18] and let's just go back to the beginning
[1:21:22] in jewish custom by around age 12 or so
[1:21:25] you'd finish your basic schooling
[1:21:27] so many would start to work by age 13.
[1:21:32] the part where peter grew up in was
[1:21:34] official village
[1:21:36] so it was not uncommon for that to be
[1:21:38] the career of choice
[1:21:40] fishermen in those days they were a
[1:21:42] rough bunch as much as they observed
[1:21:44] jewish tradition they were a rough bunch
[1:21:47] traditionally uneducated but they were
[1:21:48] skilled because not only had you to go
[1:21:50] out there and find fish but you had to
[1:21:52] come and sell it in the marketplace
[1:21:55] so you have to both understand the
[1:21:56] acquisition of your resource as well as
[1:21:58] the distribution of your resource the
[1:22:00] pricing of your resource it was a lot
[1:22:01] that peter had that was going for him
[1:22:04] as a young man growing up he got hooked
[1:22:06] on to hearing about this man called john
[1:22:08] because he was actually listening to
[1:22:10] john's messages
[1:22:13] anybody with me read the bible he was
[1:22:15] married
[1:22:17] his mother-in-law lived with him
[1:22:19] and peter was living life as a young man
[1:22:22] we don't know his exact age when jesus
[1:22:24] called him but but it would have been a
[1:22:25] very young man maybe early twenties or
[1:22:27] thereabouts or and somewhere around
[1:22:29] there anybody with me this morning
[1:22:32] but this simple fisherman
[1:22:34] was on a journey that he didn't know to
[1:22:37] be transformed from an official boy who
[1:22:39] grew up right there
[1:22:40] into an apostle
[1:22:43] grew up as official manager a
[1:22:44] spokesperson for the church grew up as a
[1:22:46] man who wasn't even a biblical scholar
[1:22:48] or of a tribe that would study the word
[1:22:51] in that way so when you read in the
[1:22:53] first letter and the second letter of
[1:22:55] peter what peter brought out you'll
[1:22:57] realize that he had already passed
[1:22:59] everybody who went to school for this
[1:23:00] thing
[1:23:01] anybody with me this morning
[1:23:04] let's go
[1:23:09] it's hard to sum up
[1:23:10] peter's life
[1:23:12] but the first experience with peter or
[1:23:15] one of the first experiences with peter
[1:23:18] could be found in scene john 1 42
[1:23:25] and he brought him to jesus
[1:23:27] and when jesus beheld him
[1:23:30] he said thou art simon
[1:23:33] the son of jonah
[1:23:35] thou shall be called cephas
[1:23:38] which is by interpretation a stone
[1:23:41] so the moment jesus saw peter
[1:23:44] he saw his destiny
[1:23:47] he saw his purpose
[1:23:48] he saw what he would become
[1:23:50] he saw the role he would play
[1:23:53] and before his transformation he called
[1:23:55] it as he saw it
[1:23:57] [Applause]
[1:24:02] in front of jesus was a stone
[1:24:05] an unshaped stone
[1:24:07] an uncut stone
[1:24:09] a stone that didn't know he was a stone
[1:24:11] that was to fit in us or anybody hear me
[1:24:13] this morning
[1:24:17] a stone that's what one day prison was
[1:24:19] lively stones
[1:24:21] a store that would one day identify the
[1:24:23] chief stone the corner stone that stone
[1:24:26] stood there
[1:24:27] didn't hear a message preached yet
[1:24:30] what he was being identified that thou
[1:24:32] shalt be called short is prophetic
[1:24:36] one day they're gonna look at you and
[1:24:38] see that you are shaped a certain way
[1:24:40] but for me to shape you you must be made
[1:24:42] out of a certain kind of material
[1:24:44] anybody with me this morning
[1:24:47] and that's why i said this morning peter
[1:24:49] knew how to identify it because he was
[1:24:51] identified before he was shaped he was a
[1:24:54] stone and before you could be shaped you
[1:24:56] have to be a stone before you can become
[1:24:58] this image
[1:25:00] you have to be the material that could
[1:25:02] be shaped into this image oh come on
[1:25:04] somebody help me this morning
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:10] there in front of jesus and i want us to
[1:25:13] understand why every service is
[1:25:15] important every prayer meeting is
[1:25:17] important every scripture you read is
[1:25:19] important every tape you listen to is
[1:25:20] important every book you read is
[1:25:22] important every time you meet a brother
[1:25:24] it's important every time you meet a
[1:25:26] sister it's important because it's all
[1:25:28] part of your transformation every
[1:25:30] miracle you see every prophecy you hear
[1:25:34] you may be seated
[1:25:37] there standing in front of jesus without
[1:25:40] him even recognizing a stone without
[1:25:43] shape was beginning to take shape
[1:25:45] a stone that didn't know where he was
[1:25:47] coming from and where he was going just
[1:25:50] that one encounter by identifying who he
[1:25:52] will become change had already started
[1:25:55] just by identifying what he would be
[1:25:58] called just by saying you are the bride
[1:26:01] change
[1:26:02] just by identifying you are wife of the
[1:26:04] lamb change just by
[1:26:06] identifying you predestinated for a
[1:26:08] purpose change
[1:26:11] change
[1:26:12] change
[1:26:13] your molecules begin to respond your dna
[1:26:16] begins to respond your vocal cords begin
[1:26:18] to respond
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:21] [Music]
[1:26:23] come on now
[1:26:24] anybody with me this morning come on
[1:26:26] ride with me a little bit because i'm
[1:26:28] not just telling peter's story i'm also
[1:26:30] telling my story i'm telling you a story
[1:26:33] because when god saw you just like when
[1:26:35] adam saw eve he said flesh of my flesh
[1:26:38] born of my bone you shall be called the
[1:26:41] same spirit was the only earth when he
[1:26:43] saw peter he said flesh of my flesh born
[1:26:46] of my bone you shall be called the
[1:26:49] mighty stone the headstone was on the
[1:26:52] earth and he said you are stoned also
[1:26:55] you shall be called headstock come on
[1:26:58] now anybody with me this morning
[1:27:02] [Applause]
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:06] and a stone without sheep
[1:27:09] was starting to take shape
[1:27:11] every experience
[1:27:12] every encounter
[1:27:14] god was revealing himself
[1:27:16] on an individual basis with a pop well
[1:27:19] don't underestimate every word spoken
[1:27:22] over your life don't underestimate the
[1:27:25] you being dedicated in the house of god
[1:27:27] don't underestimate what god has taken
[1:27:30] you through it's all for a purpose
[1:27:33] and that purpose cannot be defeated
[1:27:36] and what i love about this we're going
[1:27:38] to get to it
[1:27:39] god
[1:27:40] cannot change his mind
[1:27:42] when he declares who you are he cannot
[1:27:44] undo it because we're going to see how
[1:27:46] much mistakes peter made and peter is

[1:27:58] to you and about you and your great
[1:28:01] purpose in god that the devil wished he
[1:28:03] could stop but no depression no
[1:28:05] frustration nothing present nothing
[1:28:08] passed
[1:28:10] [Applause]
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:19] [Applause]
[1:28:21] ride with me this morning it's a little
[1:28:23] sunday school
[1:28:24] let's send this school message this
[1:28:26] morning
[1:28:28] a stone without shape
[1:28:31] starting to take shape
[1:28:33] friends
[1:28:34] whether i don't know what peter went
[1:28:35] home i tell his wife
[1:28:37] you know what is the come on tell your
[1:28:38] wife i met this man called jesus
[1:28:40] and he tell me my name
[1:28:42] but you also tell me i shall be called
[1:28:44] something else
[1:28:45] baby you want to start to call me first
[1:28:47] baby you want to become a peter because
[1:28:49] this man called jesus tell me my name is
[1:28:52] simon but i really have another name i
[1:28:54] don't understand what it means but
[1:28:56] there's something about this man
[1:28:58] he called me something else he's showing
[1:29:01] me something else he's identifying
[1:29:04] something else
[1:29:06] friends there's some people who came in
[1:29:08] here one way this morning
[1:29:10] you might call them a certain thing when
[1:29:11] they came in but when you walk out you
[1:29:13] get their bet ready to call them
[1:29:15] something else because when you hear
[1:29:16] your name on that day peter hood
[1:29:20] his name oh oh come on you don't hear me
[1:29:23] this morning no wonder when god told
[1:29:26] them jesus told them go you have power
[1:29:27] through all these things he said don't
[1:29:28] rejoice but i don't know rejoice because
[1:29:30] your name is written in heaven rejoice
[1:29:32] because you have a new name rejoice
[1:29:33] because they have oh come on now
[1:29:34] somebody preached back to me this
[1:29:36] morning
[1:29:41] you may be seated
[1:29:44] a stone
[1:29:45] without shape
[1:29:48] we all came to church without sheep
[1:29:52] born in this world without sheep
[1:29:55] can't fit in nowhere
[1:29:59] to fit in you have to be
[1:30:01] shipped
[1:30:03] the devil has a job to share people too
[1:30:05] you know
[1:30:07] because you're born here without shape
[1:30:11] and experience in life does make you
[1:30:13] adjust people learn behaviors you know
[1:30:21] in many studies
[1:30:23] they take children of different races
[1:30:25] white chinese black and put them in a
[1:30:27] room as kids and they all play normal
[1:30:30] because the biases of their parents and
[1:30:32] grandparents have not been taught
[1:30:34] to them
[1:30:36] but as they get older
[1:30:37] and they learn
[1:30:39] things
[1:30:40] now it requires conversation like
[1:30:42] whether you be jews or gentiles because
[1:30:44] the jews are the gentiles ready is it
[1:30:48] but that's the behavior you're born to
[1:30:49] it you're born without sheep
[1:30:53] and your parents have a responsibility
[1:30:55] to help sheep
[1:30:57] the preacher have a job to help sheep
[1:30:59] the world has a job to help sheep the
[1:31:02] ministry of the great prophet elijah
[1:31:04] malachi 4 was a shaping message
[1:31:07] to shape
[1:31:08] stones
[1:31:10] to connect with this head
[1:31:13] anybody with me this morning
[1:31:19] so this is why the transformation of
[1:31:22] peter is so important because peter is
[1:31:24] the only way you could find at your feet
[1:31:27] virtue
[1:31:28] and knowledge and it's only peter is
[1:31:30] doing peter talk about that you know or
[1:31:31] you don't hear me this morning so peter
[1:31:34] understood this shape and thing
[1:31:36] peter could look back from where he came
[1:31:38] from
[1:31:38] and say if you don't add to this fitting
[1:31:40] some virtue and out of virtue knowledge
[1:31:43] and out of knowledge temperance and
[1:31:45] outer temperance patience and attitude
[1:31:48] godliness and add broadly kindness and
[1:31:52] and when these things are added is
[1:31:54] charity and if these things are in you
[1:31:55] and abound oh you don't hear me this
[1:31:57] morning only peter could preach that in
[1:32:00] the whole bible only peter could preach
[1:32:02] that message because he understood what
[1:32:05] shaping of a stone
[1:32:07] felt like looked like oh come on
[1:32:09] somebody help me this morning
[1:32:20] trinis fly to america
[1:32:23] and
[1:32:24] the language
[1:32:28] i don't want to finish it
[1:32:31] the church finishing with sentences
[1:32:34] the language takes shape
[1:32:36] some people don't have to reach new york
[1:32:38] they reach the
[1:32:39] ramp of the plane
[1:32:42] and before the scary seat
[1:32:45] can i have some uh
[1:32:48] before they even the first time flying
[1:32:50] over moving there their lead is the
[1:32:51] first trip you know
[1:32:53] but they adjust shape
[1:32:58] change their behavior
[1:33:00] change their words their language your
[1:33:02] choice of words now there's nothing
[1:33:03] wrong with changing you know
[1:33:06] it's what shape you're going into
[1:33:09] because in shape and reform
[1:33:11] this world was without form and void
[1:33:13] it's scripture
[1:33:15] until god had to make it into a shape
[1:33:18] let there be light structure let me
[1:33:20] separate it from a mentally structure
[1:33:23] shape design let there be let there be
[1:33:26] the great architect designing
[1:33:28] and when he's done he was like let me
[1:33:30] put a piece to finish this thing off and
[1:33:32] drop something to complete this design
[1:33:34] he said let us make man
[1:33:37] in our image and now like this i put
[1:33:39] that man there what he was doing putting
[1:33:41] things in order
[1:33:45] so you have to see every service every
[1:33:47] encounter listen if you go to school and
[1:33:49] you're listening to school work you
[1:33:50] wouldn't take shape to be employable
[1:33:55] maybe your role is not to go to school
[1:33:57] but you need to get shape somehow maybe
[1:33:59] an apprenticeship program
[1:34:02] but it doesn't happen overnight peter's
[1:34:04] journey started somewhere in that
[1:34:06] scripture that we read in john 1 42 when
[1:34:09] he met jesus can we can we go on a
[1:34:11] little bit
[1:34:14] a stone without sheep saturday take
[1:34:16] shape
[1:34:19] say luke 4
[1:34:21] 38.
[1:34:25] simon peter has another encounter
[1:34:28] all of this is shaping him his elements
[1:34:30] it's it's remembering our service in
[1:34:33] kaiwal a service in border speed now
[1:34:35] service in saguanos it's a convention
[1:34:38] you went to it's a message you heard a
[1:34:40] tape you listen you could talk to
[1:34:41] somebody remember the first book i read
[1:34:44] written by the prophet go talk to about
[1:34:46] the parents go talk to her go talk to
[1:34:48] them and ask them what what was the
[1:34:50] experience like
[1:34:52] that changed your life and that was a
[1:34:54] point that was part of the shaping
[1:34:56] because nobody dropped them overnight
[1:34:58] and look anywhere they look you now
[1:35:01] go out with a punch go fellowship that's
[1:35:03] why on the other side you're relating
[1:35:04] with fellowship because i want to know
[1:35:05] how your story was because we could
[1:35:07] spend time talking about peter sorry
[1:35:09] about everybody have their story
[1:35:10] how sister nicolas came to love the lord
[1:35:12] so much
[1:35:13] and through her ups and downs and her
[1:35:15] child and attested you can't move you
[1:35:17] rock a revelation in her soul because as
[1:35:19] much as a rock in her soul she also is a
[1:35:21] rock
[1:35:24] anybody i could do that with everybody
[1:35:26] you know even the backslider because
[1:35:28] peterbox right
[1:35:29] but that didn't change the fact that you
[1:35:31] shall be called cfos
[1:35:34] your temporary mistake doesn't change
[1:35:36] the fact that your name is going to be
[1:35:38] changed your temporary situation it's
[1:35:41] not going to change the fact that he who
[1:35:44] started to work in you is more than able
[1:35:46] to finish it and bring it to pass
[1:35:49] can the church give the lord a big
[1:35:51] hallelujah
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:35:59] so the early part of jesus ministry we
[1:36:01] in luke 4 luke 4 is when he opened his
[1:36:03] scroll and said the spirit of lords upon
[1:36:05] me later down in that same chapter in
[1:36:08] luke 4 38 he arose out of the synagogue
[1:36:12] and entered into simon's house
[1:36:14] you could see he was on a mission to get
[1:36:16] simon's attention he didn't want simon
[1:36:18] to wonder when he had to talk to him who
[1:36:20] was talking to him and simon's wife's
[1:36:22] mother
[1:36:24] that's what i told you he was living
[1:36:26] with his mother-in-law
[1:36:29] there's no secret in
[1:36:30] and he and someone said my wife's mother
[1:36:33] was sticking with a great fever
[1:36:35] and they besought him for her
[1:36:37] and he stood over her and rebuked a
[1:36:39] fever and it left her and immediately
[1:36:42] she arose and ministered unto them you
[1:36:44] know what that minister mean
[1:36:46] in this context
[1:36:47] she was had a fever by a punch jesus
[1:36:49] rebuked the fever she gets a person to
[1:36:51] make juice and kick and said the
[1:36:53] minister to them listen
[1:36:56] imagine one million lie no next minute
[1:36:58] your guests can rebuke i would say
[1:37:00] let me get some flour let me put
[1:37:02] together what you want to eat a minister
[1:37:04] to them make them feel comfortable make
[1:37:05] them feel
[1:37:07] and there's peter watching that
[1:37:08] interesting different way
[1:37:10] i hear john preaching but this thing
[1:37:13] this thing different anybody with me
[1:37:15] this morning
[1:37:17] the next chapter luke 5.
[1:37:20] and it came to pass
[1:37:22] as the people press under him to hear
[1:37:23] the word of god he stood by the lake of
[1:37:26] gennazaret and saw two ships standing by
[1:37:29] the lake but the fishermen were gone out
[1:37:31] of them and were washing their nets
[1:37:36] you wash your neck in the morning when
[1:37:38] you finish work okay walking in the
[1:37:39] night so these men had finished work and
[1:37:42] they finished work and said well i go
[1:37:44] fling me net and just go miss i just vex
[1:37:46] i get nothing they still have a
[1:37:47] discipline
[1:37:50] anybody with me this morning
[1:37:52] so they were washing their nets
[1:37:54] and he entered into one of the ships
[1:37:56] which was simon's
[1:38:00] he didn't say he asked permission
[1:38:03] i want you to picture simon there
[1:38:05] washing his net
[1:38:07] and then she'll just walk on in the boat
[1:38:12] and when he was in the boat he said say
[1:38:15] trust out and liquor from the land
[1:38:18] and he sat down and taught the people
[1:38:20] out of the ship
[1:38:24] what ship do you have this morning
[1:38:27] that jesus could just walk into your
[1:38:28] ship
[1:38:30] sit down until you drive
[1:38:34] could he sit down on your porch could
[1:38:35] jesus just walk into your house and come
[1:38:36] into the living room and say
[1:38:39] inviting neighbors to come
[1:38:42] because peter at that point in time was
[1:38:43] no minister he wasn't no he wasn't even
[1:38:45] fully called yet all peter would have
[1:38:48] known is that my name gone changed my
[1:38:50] mother-in-law get healed and here's this
[1:38:52] man called jesus just sitting on my boot
[1:38:54] with what you have seen me cut through
[1:38:55] him on the boat
[1:38:58] so peter died in a service that morning
[1:39:00] he didn't plan to be in he was washing
[1:39:02] his nets after a whole night fishing he
[1:39:03] was tired
[1:39:05] but he get caught in church
[1:39:07] they can't leave jesus jesus he pulled
[1:39:08] my audible you know what jesus you have
[1:39:10] to
[1:39:10] keep because every boat stay at george
[1:39:13] well peter got to say well jesus when
[1:39:15] you're finished just lock up the keys
[1:39:16] now
[1:39:18] but peter had to take the boat a little
[1:39:20] bit out of the water and stay with his
[1:39:22] boat and save you and sit along in
[1:39:23] church when he didn't really plan it
[1:39:25] wasn't like it was on his schedule
[1:39:26] anybody watch me this morning have you
[1:39:28] been caught in a service that i didn't
[1:39:30] plan to be in
[1:39:34] any young brother young sister here this
[1:39:36] morning you're caught in church
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:41] peter found himself caught in service
[1:39:49] and when jesus finished the teaching
[1:39:52] verse four he said when he had left
[1:39:53] speaking when he finished preaching he
[1:39:55] said to simon launch alternately deep
[1:39:59] and i will let me go out more in the
[1:40:00] water then
[1:40:01] let me go deep in the water
[1:40:03] i just give you some natural fish
[1:40:07] some spiritual fish
[1:40:09] let me get your real fish in
[1:40:11] and let down your nets for a catch
[1:40:15] now look at simon and i want us to
[1:40:17] appreciate
[1:40:18] the transformation by the punch the
[1:40:20] growth the maturity the understanding
[1:40:23] up until this point simon had been told
[1:40:26] his name was going to be changed he has
[1:40:28] seen his mother-in-law healed he has
[1:40:30] witnessed a service and listen if there
[1:40:32] was anybody who could preach jesus
[1:40:36] jesus feelings preaching
[1:40:38] or what it would be like to sit in a
[1:40:40] service when jesus preached himself
[1:40:42] friends i got preaching
[1:40:43] you see jesus
[1:40:45] oh my he could preach
[1:40:48] and after the service brother pop well
[1:40:50] when did time come for action
[1:40:52] listen to the response
[1:40:54] and simon answering said unto him master
[1:40:58] we have told all the night
[1:41:00] and i've taken nothing
[1:41:04] nevertheless
[1:41:05] at thy word
[1:41:08] i will let only that
[1:41:10] only because it's you
[1:41:12] only if you said you would
[1:41:14] can we have enough trust in god
[1:41:17] after all you've been true to say lord
[1:41:19] if you just say the word this morning of
[1:41:21] what i have to do with my house with my
[1:41:23] job with my marriage but just say the
[1:41:26] word whatever it is
[1:41:27] i'm telling you my experience so far has
[1:41:29] not been a pleasant one because all
[1:41:31] night we tried and we caught nothing but
[1:41:33] if you tell me to do it i'm willing to
[1:41:35] try one
[1:41:37] more
[1:41:38] time
[1:41:39] is there anybody willing this morning to
[1:41:42] try one
[1:41:44] more
[1:41:45] time
[1:41:47] i don't know if this is helping anybody
[1:41:48] it's a simple message it's not this is
[1:41:50] not complicated deep mystery messenger
[1:41:54] but the mysteries come out of this man
[1:41:56] here
[1:41:58] because if you're ever talking about
[1:41:59] this image here this is peter's man this
[1:42:01] is peter's legacy here you know
[1:42:04] this year's peter legacy every time he
[1:42:06] talked about slipping voices and stuff
[1:42:08] is peter is the man who preached this
[1:42:10] sinner
[1:42:11] so i want to understand what he went
[1:42:13] through for him to have such confidence
[1:42:15] to uneducated man to be the righteous
[1:42:17] thing so eloquently under the leadership
[1:42:19] of the holy spirit
[1:42:25] and when they had
[1:42:27] this done they enclosed a great
[1:42:30] multitude of fishes and their net break
[1:42:33] it was so much fish in that brick
[1:42:37] now there's a subtle thing in scripture
[1:42:38] here
[1:42:41] listen it's a very subtle thing i
[1:42:42] preached it before in verse four it said
[1:42:44] let down your nets plural for a draw or
[1:42:47] a catch
[1:42:48] peter's response was a mixed response he
[1:42:51] said i would i will let down the net
[1:42:53] singular
[1:42:55] the command by the point was like all
[1:42:57] your nets because god telling you what
[1:42:59] about to happen
[1:43:00] peter he believe in it but is that silly
[1:43:03] instead of doing all of his nets brother
[1:43:04] pop well he put on one net singular
[1:43:08] this is very subtle but nothing is
[1:43:10] accidental to me in scripture
[1:43:11] jesus said nets if i had one knit i want
[1:43:14] to know where's the other one because if
[1:43:15] he say plural it had to be something
[1:43:17] behind it
[1:43:18] jesus said letting a net plural and
[1:43:20] peter led on one net singular and he ned
[1:43:23] brooke
[1:43:25] and now verse seven they had to back it
[1:43:27] under the apartments which were in the
[1:43:28] other ship and they should come and help
[1:43:30] them and they came and phil pull the
[1:43:32] ship so that they began to sink
[1:43:36] no safety osha all kind of thing going
[1:43:39] on here boats so much fish
[1:43:43] anybody with me this morning
[1:43:46] and when simon peter saw it
[1:43:48] he fell down and jesus this thing depart
[1:43:50] from me from a simple sinful man
[1:43:53] in his in his very slight way he was not
[1:43:56] fully obedient
[1:43:58] so he's recognizing the magnitude of god
[1:44:01] before his eyes and what full obedience
[1:44:04] to the word how important that really is
[1:44:11] anybody with me
[1:44:12] we preaching through these scriptures
[1:44:14] here right
[1:44:16] verse nine for he was astonished and all
[1:44:18] that were with him at the draw for the
[1:44:20] catch of fishes
[1:44:22] which they taken
[1:44:23] and so also was james and john the sons
[1:44:26] of zebedee which were partners with
[1:44:28] simon and jesus said unto simon fear not
[1:44:32] from henceforth thou shalt catch men
[1:44:35] and when they brought their ships to
[1:44:37] land they forsook all
[1:44:39] and followed him
[1:44:41] they left everything the boat the
[1:44:43] accessories the degree the training the
[1:44:46] account the creditors the debtors they
[1:44:49] just walk away and follow jesus
[1:44:52] are you willing to leave everything this
[1:44:53] morning and just follow jesus
[1:45:01] can we take a little more
[1:45:04] but obviously continue stop stop saying
[1:45:06] a little more you think a lot more
[1:45:09] tomorrow's holiday
[1:45:12] and this peter start of that journey and
[1:45:15] i want us to appreciate friends he had
[1:45:17] no idea the ups and downs he would go
[1:45:19] through
[1:45:21] and friends when you go through life you
[1:45:23] recognize and i think i said this in a
[1:45:25] bible study or something that at any
[1:45:27] point in time the decisions you make at
[1:45:29] that point in time to your best
[1:45:31] understanding is the best you have at
[1:45:32] that point in time
[1:45:36] your examiner board
[1:45:39] as a parent as a as a worker as a
[1:45:42] husband as a wife for the most part
[1:45:44] unless you just
[1:45:46] what less as you say here
[1:45:48] for the most part you're doing the best
[1:45:50] you know how to do
[1:45:52] you're trying to manage your budget
[1:45:53] they're trying to see if money you're
[1:45:54] trying to pay the bills you're
[1:45:55] understanding you're into school each
[1:45:56] and they make breakfast you're cooking
[1:45:58] the best way you know how sometimes you
[1:45:59] bundy food when it now start it tastes
[1:46:02] good when it all start
[1:46:05] you're doing the best the best food
[1:46:07] anybody with me
[1:46:08] the best dish you make that way when
[1:46:09] your guests come you cook the best thing
[1:46:10] you know to make
[1:46:13] because your best foot forward
[1:46:16] but that's at that particular point in
[1:46:18] time
[1:46:19] it's only as time progresses you can
[1:46:21] look back and recognize how much you
[1:46:22] have grown
[1:46:24] how much you didn't know was inside of
[1:46:27] you
[1:46:28] all along
[1:46:29] good or bad because for peter he was
[1:46:31] going to discover what in him was good
[1:46:33] as well as what in him was bad but it
[1:46:35] only takes time for that to unfold and
[1:46:38] that's why god puts time on people
[1:46:42] to see what's really in you
[1:46:44] in a natural we give you probation
[1:46:47] we're gonna get a new job to give
[1:46:48] probation
[1:46:49] i've learned through this process
[1:46:51] years ago my manager told me new brooms
[1:46:54] always sweep clean
[1:46:58] when they hire somebody
[1:47:00] that first day that first week that
[1:47:02] first month watch now when i tell your
[1:47:04] work
[1:47:05] most people if you really watch up
[1:47:08] most people not after day or two they
[1:47:09] say well to fire you but that first week
[1:47:11] that first two weeks my your future
[1:47:13] promote them
[1:47:17] but after the next month
[1:47:20] and then the next month
[1:47:21] and the next month
[1:47:22] uh but where you come from boy
[1:47:26] other teachers said i'm working
[1:47:32] you have to push him you have to beg him
[1:47:36] you're scraping him you'll be everyday i
[1:47:38] have a new excuse violet
[1:47:40] i met him and he said listen abysman he
[1:47:42] had 150 employees in my first meeting
[1:47:45] with him he said see this book right
[1:47:46] here he pulled it out of me the namely
[1:47:48] book brother terence was called the book
[1:47:49] of excuses
[1:47:52] he said i showed this to all my
[1:47:53] employees he said this book have every
[1:47:56] excuse you come up with
[1:48:00] so because i've read them all don't try
[1:48:03] not with me
[1:48:07] but probation is really put in time to
[1:48:10] see if what you start off with
[1:48:13] is a consistent thing
[1:48:15] because you make a real effort in that
[1:48:17] first date on first week that first
[1:48:19] month but my month five
[1:48:20] do you really use that to show up
[1:48:23] do you really know that don't say good
[1:48:24] morning when i go to work
[1:48:27] what's in your past people straight
[1:48:32] yeah clean me 10 years all kind of thing
[1:48:34] you do because the radio comes up
[1:48:36] so too god puts time much people were in
[1:48:38] this message years ago and you can't
[1:48:39] smell them now you can't see them you
[1:48:41] can't find them
[1:48:44] and it takes tickets even meet them i
[1:48:45] met
[1:48:46] somebody recently
[1:48:49] but hasn't been in church in years
[1:48:51] and as a talk he said you are eager
[1:48:56] i say yeah
[1:48:58] he say you're talking about the thing in
[1:48:59] your thing
[1:49:01] from the cleft of the rock
[1:49:05] and the amount of references in the
[1:49:07] message i heard in five minutes
[1:49:10] for somebody who hasn't been in church
[1:49:12] for a while
[1:49:13] i said look at eating it really inside
[1:49:14] and don't eat anything
[1:49:19] you can't get all the thing anything you
[1:49:20] know
[1:49:23] and you have to pray for the grace of
[1:49:24] god to restore everyone because this
[1:49:26] message not in vain some god allowed to
[1:49:29] go to orkin experiences but when god
[1:49:31] ready for them that thing anything does
[1:49:33] wake up in him
[1:49:36] that seed in his soul began to speak and
[1:49:39] because he responded he rained and he
[1:49:41] seized on the lettering you know anybody
[1:49:43] with me this morning
[1:49:44] somebody say man
[1:49:49] so we're talking about transformation
[1:49:51] because the reality is this gospel puts
[1:49:53] you on notice
[1:49:54] that the way you came into church
[1:49:57] a year ago five years ago 10 years ago
[1:49:59] 20 years ago it's always a work in
[1:50:02] progress
[1:50:04] and you can never say you have attend
[1:50:06] at the best guest you could speak like
[1:50:09] paul as he have run maurice
[1:50:11] i've kept defeat
[1:50:13] i've finished my course but i'm still
[1:50:15] running
[1:50:16] and every day you're looking to become
[1:50:19] more like him
[1:50:21] that's the process of transformation so
[1:50:23] i want to highlight and i have it
[1:50:24] written on my notes i kind of all over
[1:50:26] the place now but i wanted to say that
[1:50:28] peter's transformation was not a
[1:50:30] singular event
[1:50:32] we could attribute a major part of the
[1:50:34] upper room but the reality is every
[1:50:37] situation and tests he went through was
[1:50:39] making him into the man he became
[1:50:44] do not underestimate what you're going
[1:50:46] through the trials and the testing and
[1:50:48] the situations yes you're going to get
[1:50:50] the holy ghost but what you're going
[1:50:52] through now is actually shaping you and
[1:50:53] shaping you and shaping you and cutting
[1:50:55] and cutting and cutting kind of cheat
[1:50:57] say amen
[1:51:03] this brother called peter
[1:51:05] i was going to highlight a few
[1:51:07] in in different order i'm not really
[1:51:08] going to go in in chronological order as
[1:51:10] such but let's just show you this man
[1:51:12] called peter you remember the time
[1:51:15] that they were in the boat and they were
[1:51:16] having trouble
[1:51:18] and jesus appeared to them
[1:51:20] and peter said lord it dies you bid me
[1:51:22] come on
[1:51:24] guys i like that repeater you know
[1:51:26] peter what's up at that point his fate
[1:51:28] was at 100.
[1:51:29] he said lord that you bit me come then
[1:51:31] disciples know other disciples try to
[1:51:33] know then what does everybody say well
[1:51:34] let me do what peter do peter jump out
[1:51:36] there start to walk on the water peter
[1:51:38] look back thumbs up and he look at the
[1:51:41] water
[1:51:42] and that hundred feet such as the dive
[1:51:45] because when jesus saved him jesus
[1:51:47] talked about his faith you know
[1:51:49] is his faith jesus accused at that point
[1:51:52] you know anybody with me
[1:51:54] he said your faith why i have so little
[1:51:56] faith
[1:51:57] go read it
[1:52:00] no wonder jesus could tell peter peter
[1:52:02] the devil want to say feel like wheat
[1:52:04] but i've prayed for you that your
[1:52:07] your feet don't fail
[1:52:12] because you gotta go into the situation
[1:52:13] with your feet high you know but then as
[1:52:15] you see trouble
[1:52:16] your feet
[1:52:20] it's not that you don't have faith it's
[1:52:22] just that your feet come under pressure
[1:52:24] but jesus has a comfort to us through
[1:52:26] peter's through this life of peter and
[1:52:29] this transformed man called peter say i
[1:52:31] prayed for you that your faith
[1:52:33] feel not
[1:52:38] peter
[1:52:40] ends up in the inner circle
[1:52:47] just let me give you that one script it
[1:52:49] is in matthew 14 i was referencing with
[1:52:52] walking on the water
[1:52:54] and the
[1:52:55] exact words in verse
[1:52:57] uh i wonder we just read verse 29 to 31
[1:53:00] and he said come this is when peter said
[1:53:03] lord if that you biblically come and
[1:53:04] peter was come down i'll keep you walk
[1:53:06] in the water to go to jesus and when he
[1:53:08] saw the wind boisterous he was afraid
[1:53:11] and began to sink he cried saying lord
[1:53:13] save me and immediately jesus stretched
[1:53:16] fought his hand and caught him and said
[1:53:18] unto him listen to the words carefully
[1:53:20] oh thou of little feet
[1:53:22] wherefore did this doubt doubt
[1:53:25] so i want you to understand this man of
[1:53:27] faith and you having a walk of faith and
[1:53:30] boisterous wins
[1:53:32] situations in your life affect you and
[1:53:35] and doubt creeps in and fear creeps in
[1:53:37] all right
[1:53:39] let's go
[1:53:40] in matthew 16 we preach this all the
[1:53:42] time jesus asked the question who the
[1:53:44] men say that i am
[1:53:46] and it is very easy to bring what other
[1:53:48] people's interpretation or revelation or
[1:53:50] explanation or thought is some say you
[1:53:51] are this i'm so you are that you i'm
[1:53:53] saying and when they were finished
[1:53:55] calling all of the major prophets who by
[1:53:58] virtue of them raising these names they
[1:54:00] were also attributing some level of
[1:54:02] speculation into if jesus could be one
[1:54:04] of these jesus said now who do you say i
[1:54:06] am
[1:54:07] and silence in the church
[1:54:09] this is after having seen so many things
[1:54:12] and nobody had a word
[1:54:14] until peter says the word of christ
[1:54:17] and we know it so we know for sure peter
[1:54:19] had a revelation
[1:54:22] but in that same scripture just a little
[1:54:24] lower down when jesus began to explain
[1:54:26] what would happen jesus tell peter peter
[1:54:28] get behind me satan
[1:54:30] because peter was still able to be
[1:54:32] influenced
[1:54:35] by factors outside of him
[1:54:38] and what was coming through peter at
[1:54:39] that time was a word from the devil
[1:54:41] that's why jesus could say get behind me
[1:54:43] satan
[1:54:44] peter i know you talking you know
[1:54:47] anybody with me this morning
[1:54:49] we're talking about this man called
[1:54:50] peter so i want us to appreciate as and
[1:54:54] and i want you to appreciate us where
[1:54:55] the ministry peter was under
[1:54:58] so you cannot say well it's it's because
[1:55:00] the pastor is why this happened or peter
[1:55:03] is under jesus ministry
[1:55:06] and jesus has the ability to identify
[1:55:08] the spirit working through peter and say
[1:55:10] get me behind me satan
[1:55:12] jesus again complex and say oh gosh boy
[1:55:15] have somebody in church but the devil
[1:55:16] just used them
[1:55:18] is that an indictment in my ministry no
[1:55:20] jesus i want you to understand friends
[1:55:23] the three kind of believers in the
[1:55:24] church i want you to understand these
[1:55:26] spiritual attacks i want you to
[1:55:27] understand the forces
[1:55:29] because jesus is opening up himself and
[1:55:31] the devil is still trying to infiltrate
[1:55:34] his church
[1:55:36] until jesus himself had to rebuke in his
[1:55:38] own church peter who will become the
[1:55:40] spokesperson i want us to understand how
[1:55:42] many moving pieces are here
[1:55:44] we still talking about peter
[1:55:46] by hmong transfiguration matthew 17
[1:55:50] peter's party in a circle when peter see
[1:55:54] moses and elijah and jesus when you read
[1:55:57] that scripture you recognize
[1:55:59] peter said lord if you give any word we
[1:56:01] built three tabernacles
[1:56:03] do you read that scripture jesus never
[1:56:05] even respond to him
[1:56:06] jesus acts if peter never even say that
[1:56:13] jesus haven dignified with the response
[1:56:18] dare peter goes again
[1:56:20] but i want us to appreciate the
[1:56:21] confidence
[1:56:23] that god had in peter
[1:56:26] because what he saw there is reflected
[1:56:29] in his letters in peter of what he
[1:56:31] actually witnessed
[1:56:33] and the glory that he saw
[1:56:35] it was part of his testimony it was part
[1:56:37] of his transformation you cannot tell
[1:56:39] the story if he wasn't there
[1:56:44] can the church say man
[1:56:48] let's go on
[1:56:52] i'm gonna skip through quite a bit
[1:57:00] peter was there for almost every single
[1:57:02] miracle watching
[1:57:04] learning
[1:57:06] studying the timeline is filled with
[1:57:08] peter
[1:57:09] being true out all his experiences
[1:57:12] it was evident that he was
[1:57:14] called the informal leader of the
[1:57:16] disciples
[1:57:26] and as it came down to
[1:57:29] him let's touch us a bit
[1:57:31] as part of the whole transformation
[1:57:35] jesus told peter peter you're going to
[1:57:37] deny me
[1:57:40] and peter's response
[1:57:42] was in a way that peter couldn't even
[1:57:45] believe it was possible
[1:57:47] peter didn't believe he could deny jesus
[1:57:49] no
[1:57:51] because peter didn't know what the
[1:57:52] experience was going to be like that was
[1:57:54] going to require him to give a response
[1:57:57] i hope this is helping somebody
[1:57:59] none of the experiences peter went
[1:58:01] through had prepared him for this
[1:58:02] encounter when jesus died
[1:58:06] and when they come and say
[1:58:08] want you there in service
[1:58:10] want you aren't you a disciple
[1:58:12] and you are part of this thing
[1:58:14] and he denied it three times and we said
[1:58:16] it before he wept bitterly
[1:58:20] and all this was part of that building
[1:58:23] up
[1:58:23] of the transformation of peter
[1:58:27] that leads to this great apostle as it
[1:58:30] were
[1:58:34] peter was so reckless so
[1:58:38] responsive to how we was led that
[1:58:40] imagine when they come to take jesus he
[1:58:42] draws sword
[1:58:44] this is after all of the blessed
[1:58:46] messages and turn the other cheek and
[1:58:50] after all these great teachings buddhist
[1:58:52] even
[1:58:54] peter responded in his default factory
[1:58:56] settings as if somebody had come on his
[1:58:58] boat and take a bag of fish
[1:59:00] and chop off the man is
[1:59:03] and jesus had to go and restore it
[1:59:06] and tell peter if you live by the sword
[1:59:09] you die by the sword
[1:59:11] that was a message he was dealing with
[1:59:13] peter personally
[1:59:18] warrior peter in the garden of
[1:59:20] gethsemane
[1:59:23] jesus at the challenge peter peter you
[1:59:24] can't pray with me for one hour
[1:59:26] you can't tarry with me for one hour so
[1:59:30] you see why a revelation or the pastor
[1:59:32] or the church you're in
[1:59:34] is different from a personal walk and a
[1:59:36] personal maturing and a personal
[1:59:37] maturity as a christian
[1:59:44] when jesus rose from the dead he said go
[1:59:46] tell my disciples and peter
[1:59:50] because peter was going through a lot
[1:59:53] friends it's not easy to make a mistake
[1:59:57] and try to work your way back to
[1:59:58] fellowship
[2:00:01] it's not easy
[2:00:03] it takes a lot of effort
[2:00:06] it takes you having to die out even more
[2:00:09] peter didn't feel welcome i want you to
[2:00:12] process it
[2:00:14] because not only he wasn't this acquired
[2:00:15] brother this was a front runner brother
[2:00:17] so when do you hear peter deny jesus
[2:00:20] the brothers couldn't believe it
[2:00:22] and peter is still feeling guilty
[2:00:28] and friends
[2:00:29] jesus was dealing with that by saying i
[2:00:32] still want peter to come
[2:00:34] so go tell me and go and make sure and
[2:00:37] find peter
[2:00:39] because peter is still part of this
[2:00:40] thing
[2:00:41] he may have made a mistake if that is
[2:00:43] any encouragement to backstarted this
[2:00:45] morning take that as a as someone to run
[2:00:47] with
[2:00:50] [Applause]
[2:00:54] nothing peter did was changing god's
[2:00:57] mind about peter being part of this
[2:01:00] great purpose and plan
[2:01:02] if it was us we say tell peter he can't
[2:01:04] come
[2:01:06] peter finished
[2:01:08] he went out from us because he was not
[2:01:10] of us
[2:01:13] he believed in revelation now we don't
[2:01:14] believe because he deny it
[2:01:16] not once it's three messages he preached
[2:01:20] and in all three messages with
[2:01:22] occurrence you see i know not the man
[2:01:24] i know not the revelation
[2:01:27] finished
[2:01:31] thank god
[2:01:32] god is a redeemer
[2:01:34] thank god he sees beyond what man sees
[2:01:38] and he knew what was in peter's heart
[2:01:40] from that first time he met peter and he
[2:01:43] said come
[2:01:44] your name is going to be different
[2:01:48] and when peter couldn't speak for
[2:01:50] himself that rock in his soul was
[2:01:52] speaking for him
[2:01:54] and when peter couldn't pick himself the
[2:01:56] resurrected christ there was no blood
[2:01:58] that could speak for peter or you don't
[2:02:00] hear me this morning
[2:02:02] so the blood was speaking better things
[2:02:04] and peter could have even expressed
[2:02:08] thank god for the blood
[2:02:10] if it wasn't for the blood where would
[2:02:12] we be peter's own mouth put him in
[2:02:14] trouble but
[2:02:16] at that same time jesus on the cross it
[2:02:19] is finished and now there was blood that
[2:02:21] could speak for peter that peter didn't
[2:02:24] even fully understand but that blood
[2:02:26] spoke better for peter than he could
[2:02:28] speak himself he said go find
[2:02:31] my son peter
[2:02:33] i wonder if there's somebody here this
[2:02:35] morning who is backslidden who is
[2:02:36] struggling who
[2:02:40] this is for you
[2:02:42] this is a message of restoration of
[2:02:44] redemption of transformation
[2:02:55] and in that scripture we started with
[2:02:59] when jesus was having a conversation in
[2:03:01] john 21
[2:03:03] when peter jumped out the boat
[2:03:06] and swim to jesus and the disciples came
[2:03:09] in their boats afterwards
[2:03:10] jesus has a conversation with peter
[2:03:12] peter do you love me
[2:03:16] because at the end of it i really want
[2:03:18] to understand what's in your heart peter
[2:03:20] and it's not just that
[2:03:22] it's not that jesus didn't know you know
[2:03:24] he wanted peter to confess it
[2:03:29] he wants him to confess and and he asks
[2:03:31] peter the question three times
[2:03:37] peter denied jesus three times
[2:03:39] but here jesus said let me help you undo
[2:03:42] that
[2:03:44] do you love me
[2:03:47] do you love me
[2:03:49] do you love me
[2:03:50] and jesus put on record
[2:03:53] peter's identification with his ministry
[2:03:56] so when the devil want to pull a tape
[2:03:58] and say well have the tape when you deny

[2:06:22] oil and all kind of thing brothers was
[2:06:25] you you had to know where standing
[2:06:27] but peter wasn't there yet at that time
[2:06:29] he wasn't there yet
[2:06:33] but by the time he go into his process
[2:06:35] of transformation i want us to
[2:06:37] understand transformation and change and
[2:06:39] the person who we were yesterday and
[2:06:41] last year not dc person today and even
[2:06:43] after this service you'll be a different
[2:06:45] person
[2:06:47] by the time we read acts five now
[2:06:50] now this is after the holy ghost pour
[2:06:52] out right
[2:06:53] we reach and and and and and
[2:06:56] the the disciples this is acts 5 verse
[2:06:58] 17.
[2:06:59] and the high priest rose up this is
[2:07:01] after let me just read back a little bit
[2:07:03] again
[2:07:04] and by the hands of the apostles this is
[2:07:05] acts 5 verse 12 were many signs and
[2:07:08] wonders wrought among the people and
[2:07:10] they were all at one according solomon's
[2:07:11] porch and the rest there's no man
[2:07:14] joining himself to them but the people
[2:07:15] magnified them and believers were the
[2:07:17] more added to the lord multitudes both
[2:07:20] men and women in so much that they
[2:07:22] brought forth the sick into the streets
[2:07:25] and laid them on beds and couches that
[2:07:27] at the least the shadow of peter
[2:07:30] look at this transformed man called
[2:07:32] peter peter do you even have to pray for
[2:07:34] them no more just the shadow of peter
[2:07:36] passing by might overshadow them oh come
[2:07:39] on somebody help me
[2:07:42] the same man who denied jesus they say
[2:07:44] man who made mistakes they say man they
[2:07:47] just wanted to be near peter because
[2:07:49] when the lights shine on peter and the
[2:07:51] shadow of peter dropped
[2:07:56] there came also a multitude out of the
[2:07:58] cities round about jerusalem bringing
[2:08:00] sick folks
[2:08:01] with them which were vexed with unclean
[2:08:03] spirits and they were healed everyone
[2:08:08] go on
[2:08:09] then the high priest rose up
[2:08:12] and all they that were with him which is
[2:08:14] the sack of the sadducees so they round
[2:08:17] up every side you see
[2:08:19] and were filled with indignation
[2:08:21] and laid their hands on the apostles and
[2:08:24] put them in the common prison the common
[2:08:26] prison is not the special prison the
[2:08:29] common prison is where the bandits and
[2:08:31] where the heart and seasoned criminals i
[2:08:33] want you to see polish rem them brothers
[2:08:35] now and everybody says yes they give up
[2:08:36] that hard life in them
[2:08:40] and fellas they're fishing they know
[2:08:41] they are used to that thing and they put
[2:08:42] them in the common prison
[2:08:44] anybody with me this morning
[2:08:46] hallelujah but the angel of the lord by
[2:08:48] night open the prison doors and brought
[2:08:52] them foot and said go stand and speak in
[2:08:55] the temple
[2:08:57] to the people all the words of this life
[2:09:00] and when they heard that
[2:09:02] they entered into the temple early in
[2:09:03] the morning and taught but the high
[2:09:05] priest came and deal with with him and
[2:09:07] called the council together and all
[2:09:09] these senators of the children of vision
[2:09:11] and sent to the prison to have them
[2:09:13] brought
[2:09:14] but when the officers came
[2:09:16] and found them not in the prison they
[2:09:18] returned and told saying the prison
[2:09:21] truly found we shot with all safety
[2:09:24] we didn't find a lock broken
[2:09:26] we didn't find our window broken
[2:09:28] the security guards stealing in front
[2:09:31] nobody open the door
[2:09:33] and they keep us standing without before
[2:09:35] the door so the guards right outside the
[2:09:37] building
[2:09:41] but when we open dsl
[2:09:46] we found no man with him
[2:09:48] now when the high priest and the captain
[2:09:50] of the temple and the chief priests
[2:09:52] heard these things they doubted of them
[2:09:55] where unto this would grow they say if
[2:09:56] people hear about this
[2:09:58] this thing is even worse than before
[2:10:00] it's better we didn't lock them up
[2:10:02] because if they heard we locked them up
[2:10:04] and they know outside the prison and the
[2:10:06] cameras here picked them up the guys
[2:10:08] here picked them up they lock air brake
[2:10:11] the guards say he stand up there all
[2:10:13] night here you know how they went out we
[2:10:15] can't let this get out there
[2:10:18] you may be seated
[2:10:20] then came one i want to show the
[2:10:22] challenge but this is peter who say i
[2:10:24] know this gospel
[2:10:25] then came one until him saying behold
[2:10:27] the men whom you put in prison are
[2:10:29] standing in the temple and teaching the
[2:10:31] people
[2:10:32] then when they captained with the
[2:10:33] officers and brought them listen the
[2:10:36] bible was very impossible without
[2:10:38] violence
[2:10:39] never let's say we want to be gentle
[2:10:41] with them because we already know this
[2:10:42] the empowerment fellows working with
[2:10:43] these days we already want to push them
[2:10:46] and next thing the next thing something
[2:10:47] happened to us so they brought them they
[2:10:48] say brother peter can you kindly
[2:10:51] make your way to the high priest and the
[2:10:53] captain if you would just allow us to
[2:10:55] take you in we don't want to touch here
[2:10:57] we don't want to hold here we don't want
[2:10:58] to use any handcuffs we don't want to
[2:10:59] hit you we don't want to prod thanks for
[2:11:01] other people but the thing only working
[2:11:02] with the thing anything
[2:11:04] we already want to mess with that thing
[2:11:06] so can you come anybody with me this
[2:11:08] morning
[2:11:13] then when the captain will be off them
[2:11:15] brought him with all violence listen for
[2:11:17] they fear the people
[2:11:19] so all the people now do people have an
[2:11:21] attitude
[2:11:22] know the whole believers changing over a
[2:11:25] punch they don't know scaredy believers
[2:11:27] you know all them scared people like you
[2:11:28] know gideon days he said if you're
[2:11:29] afraid go home and sleep if you're
[2:11:31] afraid go back go back go back but these
[2:11:33] disciples who follow him between them
[2:11:35] now they're afraid nothing they're
[2:11:36] afraid nobody they don't care who it is
[2:11:38] who say what the god they serve they
[2:11:41] know they've been healed they know
[2:11:42] they've been changed they know one day i
[2:11:44] was blind but now i see
[2:11:46] where you going where peter
[2:11:52] for they fear the people lest they
[2:11:54] should have been stoned
[2:11:56] so the gods
[2:11:57] frightened if they gone get no no no
[2:12:00] let's go on
[2:12:01] and when they brought them they set them
[2:12:04] before the council and the high priest
[2:12:06] asked them saying did not we straightly
[2:12:09] command you did we not in other words we
[2:12:11] have men's words didn't we directly
[2:12:13] clearly specifically
[2:12:17] direct
[2:12:18] you that you should not teach in this
[2:12:21] name
[2:12:22] and be all you are filled jerusalem with
[2:12:24] your doctrine i read any bible
[2:12:27] and intend to mean this man's blood upon
[2:12:30] us
[2:12:31] and then peter
[2:12:32] and the other apostles answered and said
[2:12:34] we ought to obey god
[2:12:36] rather than men
[2:12:38] so this man peter who a little while ago
[2:12:41] by the terence was i know this thing
[2:12:43] afraid to die afraid prison afraid this
[2:12:46] dinner he said listen listen listen we
[2:12:48] ought to obey god rather than man
[2:12:50] the god of our fathers raised up jesus
[2:12:52] whom you slew and hung on a tree him had
[2:12:55] god exalted with his right hand to be a
[2:12:58] prince and a savior fought to give
[2:13:00] repentance to israel and forgiveness of
[2:13:02] sins and we are his witnesses
[2:13:05] you see how it matters now
[2:13:07] peter could not recall every experience
[2:13:09] he had he said we are his witnesses the
[2:13:12] stuff i've seen you can't beat it
[2:13:14] ultimate this stuff i've seen you can't
[2:13:17] shut me up this stuff i've seen i can't
[2:13:20] backslide
[2:13:21] no more i've been changed i've been
[2:13:24] transformed
[2:13:27] we are his witnesses of these things
[2:13:31] and so is also the holy ghost whom god
[2:13:34] had given to them that obey him
[2:13:36] when they heard that
[2:13:38] they were cut to the heart and took
[2:13:40] counsel to slay them
[2:13:52] i don't i don't want to read all of it
[2:13:54] but there's the last verse of that
[2:13:55] chapter says and they departed from the
[2:13:57] presence of the council rejoicing that
[2:14:00] they were counted worthy to suffer
[2:14:03] shame for his name
[2:14:04] and daily
[2:14:06] in the temple and in every house they
[2:14:08] ceased not to teach and preach jesus
[2:14:11] christ give us some christians like that
[2:14:13] again
[2:14:14] who by virtue of your experience and by
[2:14:16] what you have witnessed and what that
[2:14:18] you have heard and the glory that has
[2:14:20] come upon you nothing will stop you from
[2:14:23] climbing this pyramid
[2:14:27] oh
[2:14:28] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:14:33] peter's transformation
[2:14:35] i'm going to be wrapping up shortly
[2:14:37] peter's transformation was at a singular
[2:14:39] event friends although the upper room
[2:14:41] plays the most significant role it is
[2:14:43] undeniable that multiple experiences
[2:14:46] contributed to peter's transformation
[2:14:48] how could you say you trust god and you
[2:14:50] know to trust him when he never had to
[2:14:52] have to depend on him
[2:14:55] and had to walk with i don't know how
[2:14:57] i'm going to pay this bill i don't know
[2:14:58] how we're going to do this i don't know
[2:14:59] how this thing going to work out
[2:15:01] i never see where the lord worked it out
[2:15:03] for me
[2:15:04] now you could tell people listen you
[2:15:06] could trust him it worked for me it will
[2:15:08] work for you too
[2:15:10] i know him as my jehovah jireh i know
[2:15:12] him as my jehovah sharma i know him
[2:15:14] mario van nisi maybe you only knew him
[2:15:16] as one or two of these things but he's
[2:15:17] seven compound redemptive names i want
[2:15:19] to know him in all of his power and what
[2:15:21] your name as my priest as my shepherd as
[2:15:23] my shield as my buckler as my reward as
[2:15:25] my defense
[2:15:26] can the church say man
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:33] and in the great i call it the great
[2:15:35] convention that started after the
[2:15:37] ministry of christ in the day of
[2:15:38] pentecost peter preached the first
[2:15:40] service
[2:15:41] he was also the first one to openly
[2:15:43] declare the gospel of christ being
[2:15:46] available and accessible to the
[2:15:48] gentiles paul would be the one to carry
[2:15:51] this forward but peter was the one who
[2:15:52] said it don't matter where you come from
[2:15:54] this thing is available to everybody can
[2:15:56] the church say man
[2:16:03] hallelujah
[2:16:05] and because of peter's transformation
[2:16:08] and we read it that's why i read that
[2:16:09] scripture
[2:16:10] peter was able to pick up
[2:16:12] from the old testament
[2:16:14] something that nobody had touched
[2:16:17] until he addressed it in the way he did
[2:16:20] peter was able to pick back up from
[2:16:23] exodus 19 and i've preached this before
[2:16:25] when moses spoke something that for
[2:16:27] years hovered over them that they
[2:16:29] couldn't reconcile
[2:16:31] because under the law
[2:16:33] the line of the kings
[2:16:35] the lines of the priests were separate
[2:16:37] lines there was nowhere to mix it in
[2:16:40] fact god was so serious about that that
[2:16:42] king uzziah was killed for trying to be
[2:16:45] a priest when he was a king
[2:16:47] so moses had declared in exodus 19
[2:16:51] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[2:16:53] indeed
[2:16:54] and keep my commandment and he's
[2:16:55] speaking for god then he shall be a
[2:16:58] peculiar treasure unto me for all people
[2:17:01] for all the earth is mine and ye shall
[2:17:03] be unto me a kingdom of priests
[2:17:07] for years that word and that phrase hung
[2:17:09] over them they didn't know how to
[2:17:10] reconcile it
[2:17:12] and a holy nation these are the words
[2:17:14] which thou shalt speak unto the children
[2:17:16] of israel can the church say amen and
[2:17:18] then peter as a transformed man could
[2:17:21] reach back into the book of exodus
[2:17:25] and bring it present tense and he said
[2:17:27] but yeah chosen generation
[2:17:29] a royal priesthood
[2:17:32] because with this man called christ
[2:17:33] jesus who was a king and a priest he has
[2:17:36] now opened up a new line of priestly
[2:17:39] kings and kingly priests kingdom of
[2:17:42] priests
[2:17:43] royal priesthood holy nation peculiar
[2:17:46] people
[2:17:50] that he should show forth the praises of
[2:17:52] him
[2:17:53] who had called you out of darkness into
[2:17:55] this marvelous light but more than that
[2:17:57] he goes on he said which in times past
[2:17:59] were not a people in other words you
[2:18:01] don't even have to be jewish
[2:18:03] and be able to say i'm from which i
[2:18:04] believe i in the past you were not a
[2:18:06] people but i know the people of god
[2:18:09] grafting in the gentile dispensation oh
[2:18:13] come on somebody preached back to me
[2:18:15] which had not obtained mercy but no have
[2:18:18] obtained mercy
[2:18:20] can the church say man the musician
[2:18:22] could get ready i'm looking to wind down
[2:18:25] and this stone
[2:18:27] cephas
[2:18:28] peter petra rock stone is the first one
[2:18:31] to preach a message about stones he said
[2:18:34] he also has lively stones
[2:18:36] this is peter preaching his message i
[2:18:38] want you to understand that peter's
[2:18:40] books was his testimony you know oh you
[2:18:43] don't hear me this morning peter was
[2:18:45] preaching from first hand personal
[2:18:48] experience
[2:18:49] oh hallelujah built up a special house
[2:18:52] a holy priesthood to offer spiritual
[2:18:55] sacrifices and he lay that promise
[2:18:58] and that's why i have that inspiration a
[2:19:00] stone a shape stone a chainstone a
[2:19:04] transformed stone and the prophecy of
[2:19:07] lively stones because we have to follow
[2:19:09] in that same footsteps of a man and a
[2:19:12] woman whom we have made mistakes we have
[2:19:14] struggled we didn't know our identity we
[2:19:16] had this career we had this job we had
[2:19:18] this family this lineage but one day god
[2:19:21] found you he called you he met you he
[2:19:24] said you're going to be somebody else
[2:19:25] you're going to have a new walk you're
[2:19:27] going to have a new talk you're going to
[2:19:28] have a new life you're going to have a
[2:19:29] new word you're going to have a reason
[2:19:31] to shout yes you're going to make
[2:19:32] mistakes yes there might be times you
[2:19:34] deny me yes there are times you don't
[2:19:36] know where you're going but that
[2:19:37] prophecy that word that seed that
[2:19:40] predestination in your soul will speak
[2:19:43] for you when you can't speak for
[2:19:44] yourself just hold on
[2:19:47] because the upper room coming hold on
[2:19:49] there's a prophecy coming hold on
[2:19:51] there's a great transformation coming
[2:19:53] all of your trials and your ups and
[2:19:55] downs is to prepare you for that upper
[2:19:57] room experience because the peter
[2:19:59] even though he was in the upper room he
[2:20:01] was still afraid he was still petrified
[2:20:04] but all of a sudden there came a sound
[2:20:06] from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[2:20:09] and it filled the whole house and the
[2:20:10] peter who went into that room brother
[2:20:12] terrence was a different peter who came
[2:20:14] out of that room oh you want to tell me
[2:20:17] there's no such thing as the holy ghost
[2:20:19] brother sister the promise of the holy
[2:20:21] ghost is just as real as it was in a day
[2:20:24] of
[2:20:28] pentecost and when that holy ghost
[2:20:31] filled peter's heart peter couldn't go
[2:20:33] back to the old version of himself you
[2:20:35] couldn't find the file he couldn't find
[2:20:37] your record he couldn't find the history
[2:20:39] peter could stand boldly anywhere and
[2:20:41] preach the gospel it didn't matter what
[2:20:43] you trapped him with
[2:20:48] and in fact when it was time for peter
[2:20:49] to die
[2:20:50] he said i don't mind crucifixion
[2:20:52] but oh gosh don't do it don't do me like
[2:20:54] don't do me like my lord i'm not even
[2:20:56] worthy to be crucified like jesus
[2:20:59] crucify me upside down make sure and
[2:21:01] make me properly upside down because i'm
[2:21:03] not worthy because if i like him because
[2:21:05] i'm ready to go because i know when i go
[2:21:07] i'm gonna see him oh god i know i wonder
[2:21:10] when i give up this body and i give him
[2:21:12] this tabernacle i know we have a next
[2:21:14] one waiting for me it's just waiting for
[2:21:16] me any minute now send me quickly
[2:21:18] because i know where i'm going i know
[2:21:20] where i've come from i know who called
[2:21:22] me i know my name is written
[2:21:26] i've been shaped
[2:21:29] shaped as a stone
[2:21:31] character-shaped
[2:21:33] royal priesthood
[2:21:35] friends as we get ready to close out
[2:21:38] that is your promise
[2:21:40] to be part of this royal priesthood to
[2:21:43] be part of this holy nation to be part
[2:21:46] of this peculiar people and being a
[2:21:48] priest
[2:21:49] is a duty
[2:21:53] it is not a feeling to be a priest today
[2:21:57] it's not just a title
[2:21:59] being a priest is a responsibility
[2:22:02] whether you feel like it or don't feel
[2:22:04] like it
[2:22:04] you can't be a priest and say well i
[2:22:06] have feeling to do the duties today
[2:22:10] it's a duty
[2:22:12] it's a responsibility
[2:22:16] has nothing to do with your feeling
[2:22:19] well i had a bad night
[2:22:21] nothing to do with it you're a priest
[2:22:23] you accepted this challenge
[2:22:25] you accepted this responsibility walk in
[2:22:28] it own it claim it speak it live it
[2:22:33] but abraham and preaching seven church
[2:22:35] ages
[2:22:37] he said well i don't feel like going to
[2:22:39] church he said but you're a priest
[2:22:41] it's your duty
[2:22:43] he said you've got to be there
[2:22:45] so i'm not talking to church members
[2:22:47] nowhere
[2:22:48] i'm talking about duty-bound kingly
[2:22:50] priests because you're both a king and
[2:22:53] you're a priest that's that's what this
[2:22:54] royal priesthood thing is hallelujah
[2:22:58] this is but random well i just don't
[2:23:00] feel like taking a part in this service
[2:23:01] i'll be there but already not there
[2:23:04] really he said you're a priest
[2:23:06] making a sacrifice
[2:23:08] and he's sacrificing when you don't feel
[2:23:10] like lifting your hand but
[2:23:13] when you lift your hand it's a sacrifice
[2:23:15] it takes some effort
[2:23:17] anybody wanted to make a effort
[2:23:19] i don't know if you raise your hand for
[2:23:21] this service but i want everybody to
[2:23:22] raise your hand for this service because
[2:23:24] that's a sacrifice but a brandon said
[2:23:26] when you raise your hand you defy the
[2:23:27] laws of nature the laws of gravity
[2:23:30] you're acknowledging the fact that
[2:23:32] you're reaching to somebody higher than
[2:23:33] yourself hallelujah come on you kingly
[2:23:36] priests
[2:23:46] you believe in the vine healing oh i
[2:23:48] don't know you better ask our pastor
[2:23:49] that's the prophet what do you think
[2:23:50] about it you're the priest now
[2:23:54] you had a priest in your home
[2:23:56] when you're driving in a car you are the
[2:23:58] priest in your car
[2:23:59] when he marks you at the prison in maxi
[2:24:02] when you're having a family altar you
[2:24:03] are the priest there anybody with me
[2:24:06] do you understand that as a priest their
[2:24:07] duties you do every single day
[2:24:12] have you been abandoning your priestly
[2:24:15] duties
[2:24:19] we preaching peter's messenger
[2:24:24] i'm almost done
[2:24:26] we are kingdom of priests
[2:24:28] because jesus is the great priest king
[2:24:31] lion
[2:24:32] and the lamb
[2:24:34] warned of victory for us peter got a
[2:24:36] clear revelation and understanding
[2:24:39] of this
[2:24:40] hallelujah you could begin to play
[2:24:41] something softly
[2:24:44] friends
[2:24:46] the great transformation that peter went
[2:24:48] through
[2:24:49] was by virtue
[2:24:51] of his upper room
[2:24:53] experience
[2:24:57] three and a half years under jesus
[2:24:59] ministry
[2:25:01] was powerful
[2:25:04] but it was not enough
[2:25:08] it was not enough to say i was in church
[2:25:11] i was there when he fed five thousand
[2:25:14] it was not enough to say i walked on
[2:25:16] water
[2:25:16] do you know that i was the one when they
[2:25:18] talked but he brought a walk on water
[2:25:20] that was me
[2:25:21] that was not enough to keep peter
[2:25:23] standing
[2:25:25] he was still afraid
[2:25:28] there in the upper room
[2:25:29] afraid of the persecution
[2:25:32] afraid of being
[2:25:34] just like jesus crucified undying
[2:25:38] until
[2:25:39] the promise that he had been
[2:25:42] had been breathed over him
[2:25:44] of receiving the holy ghost
[2:25:47] became a reality
[2:25:49] in front of his very eyes
[2:25:51] and then all of a sudden there was a
[2:25:53] sound from heaven
[2:25:54] as of a rushing mighty wind
[2:25:57] fill the whole house
[2:25:59] and then that pillar of fire
[2:26:01] began to divide itself
[2:26:03] and peter standing there
[2:26:06] got his own personal liquor fire
[2:26:10] he wasn't looking at anybody else it was
[2:26:12] him and his fire
[2:26:14] it was him and his experience like moses
[2:26:16] at the burning bush it was just peter
[2:26:19] and god alone
[2:26:20] and everybody in there 120 in the upper
[2:26:23] room had their personal experience with
[2:26:26] god
[2:26:27] that changed them permanently
[2:26:29] it was more than a sermon it was more
[2:26:31] than words but it was a desire in their
[2:26:34] soul and on promise that they were
[2:26:36] building their feet on that combined
[2:26:39] into a reality to them when the holy
[2:26:41] spirit moved in
[2:26:42] friends i want to encourage you
[2:26:44] this is what peter went through was his
[2:26:46] transformation to have the bones and the
[2:26:49] confidence to say by these promises
[2:26:52] these promises
[2:26:54] we become partakers
[2:26:56] of the divine nature it's a nature that
[2:26:59] we can access the very nature of god the
[2:27:01] very attributes of god the love of god
[2:27:03] the virtue of god the the living word of
[2:27:06] god has
[2:27:08] seven manifestations of one perfect holy
[2:27:11] spirit that is our promise
[2:27:13] friends
[2:27:15] i challenge you now
[2:27:21] in a messenger token
[2:27:24] but the random said i'm trying to press
[2:27:26] upon your mind's friend that the owl has
[2:27:28] struck
[2:27:29] that something's got to be done by it
[2:27:30] i'm done
[2:27:31] we must do something it's either in or
[2:27:33] out
[2:27:37] the hour has come where the token must
[2:27:38] be there
[2:27:41] peter come to his crossroads
[2:27:43] he needed something more
[2:27:45] he needed more than a tape more than a
[2:27:46] book more than a message more than a
[2:27:48] service he wanted something on the
[2:27:49] inside
[2:27:51] and they were in one minor one accord
[2:27:53] god help us to get into one minor one
[2:27:54] accord but the brandon said he would get
[2:27:56] in one minor one accord in five minutes
[2:27:59] there'd be not a sick person in this
[2:28:00] building
[2:28:02] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[2:28:03] prayer
[2:28:06] heavenly father a simple message
[2:28:09] about a transformation of peter lord and
[2:28:12] what it means for us
[2:28:14] lord in so many ways peter depicts so
[2:28:17] much of our lives
[2:28:18] lord the uncertainty that not knowing
[2:28:20] who we were and being caught from a life
[2:28:23] that we may have planned or stumbled
[2:28:25] upon into a new walk a new talk
[2:28:27] being confronted with truths that we did
[2:28:29] not know and we would learn and come to
[2:28:31] understand and being confronted by
[2:28:33] situations that challenge us to the very
[2:28:36] core where we even disappoint ourselves
[2:28:38] and we fall short
[2:28:40] of what even we expected of ourselves
[2:28:43] peter never thought he would deny
[2:28:45] peter never thought it was in him
[2:28:47] he thought he was stronger
[2:28:49] but the situation of life
[2:28:52] was too much for him and he gave up just
[2:28:54] as he did when he walked in the water
[2:28:56] the fate he started with dwindled when
[2:28:59] he
[2:29:00] saw the winds and the environment change
[2:29:03] and he looked away from jesus father
[2:29:07] lord in my heart my burden is to help
[2:29:09] somebody this morning who has looked
[2:29:11] away from you
[2:29:13] looked away from you to situations to
[2:29:15] challenges to problems and they have
[2:29:17] lost their way and they are sinking this
[2:29:19] morning in the water
[2:29:21] lord your word said that when peter
[2:29:22] began to sink immediately you reached
[2:29:24] out and grabbed his hands
[2:29:27] and lord to help peter after he denied
[2:29:30] you three times you presented yourself
[2:29:32] to him to
[2:29:34] almost undo that experience there peter
[2:29:36] you love me
[2:29:37] declare with your own lips the same lips
[2:29:40] that declared
[2:29:41] that you're not with me i want you to
[2:29:43] declare your love for me
[2:29:45] to give peter our fate that he could
[2:29:47] stand because the devil comes as a
[2:29:49] roaring lion peter wrote that in his
[2:29:51] letter
[2:29:52] seeking whom he may devour peter knew
[2:29:54] what that meant because he went through
[2:29:56] it
[2:29:57] he went through the attack spiritual
[2:29:58] attack mental attack
[2:30:01] he went through it but he went through
[2:30:03] his transformation
[2:30:05] and the process of his transformation
[2:30:07] was greater
[2:30:08] than his failures
[2:30:10] the process of his transformation was
[2:30:12] greater than his mistakes
[2:30:14] the process of his transformation was
[2:30:16] greater than his denial
[2:30:18] and his
[2:30:20] processor transformation stood the test
[2:30:22] of time
[2:30:24] to give him the boldness for the lord we
[2:30:26] need young people with boldness
[2:30:28] we need parents with boldness we need
[2:30:30] fathers with boldness we need mothers
[2:30:32] with boldness we need children with
[2:30:34] boldness
[2:30:36] the boldness peter had to say we obey
[2:30:40] god and not man
[2:30:42] take my life do what you want to be
[2:30:44] throw me in prison it doesn't matter
[2:30:47] this means more to me than anything else
[2:30:49] father help your children today
[2:30:52] lord restore change transform deliver
[2:30:55] break shackles lord and
[2:30:57] create a burden in the heart of your
[2:30:58] people for an upper room experience
[2:31:00] because that is what matters the most
[2:31:02] lord we can preach too much we can sing
[2:31:05] too much we can never pray too much we
[2:31:07] can never seek your face too much our
[2:31:09] young people are in need father the
[2:31:11] world is falling apart lord may you put
[2:31:14] a sigh and cry in our hearts
[2:31:17] peter wept
[2:31:19] bitterly
[2:31:22] that weeping that cry is he knew he
[2:31:25] messed up
[2:31:26] and he was trying to find a reconnection
[2:31:29] he knew he wasn't living right at that
[2:31:31] time he knew what he said was not right
[2:31:32] lord help us to see our ways to see all
[2:31:35] our words our actions lord what we have
[2:31:37] said and done that lord is not right
[2:31:39] lord we repent father lord we come back
[2:31:42] to you this morning
[2:31:43] lord father to reconnect with you
[2:31:46] father if there's any back slide in our
[2:31:47] midst anyone who is struggling lord may
