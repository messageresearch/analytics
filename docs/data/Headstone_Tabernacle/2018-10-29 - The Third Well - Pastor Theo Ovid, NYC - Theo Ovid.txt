that is taking place in our country today and in the world in general uh and I can only say even so come Lord Jesus that's my prayer amen because you see brother Branham said that God does not have to destroy man man will destroy himself right you see and we see the destruction that has taken place but at the same time is just the sign to us all that the bride is getting herself ready amen I remember a bishop a Pentecostal bishop with a very thundering voice friend of brother Coleman Amen he spoke a few words in the old church and was Becky was it on behalf of grandma home the funeral and he was just saying if pure words and he said well bless God goodbye world and good morning glory and and it's just the way he said dad a man who just kind of took me over to the other side and we're saying goodbye world amen good morning glory amen again Omegas dark shore is getting darker and darker and darker we all know that but you know just before the rising of the Sun amen we know how brother Branham spoke that it gets dark darker and darker but there's a new day coming amen that is why I'm so happy amen amen if you're not happy to be a Christian today I feel sorry if your if your

Ghost [Music] [Music] be seated praise me amen let us enter into his courts with praise and by this a Manx giving Amen and that's the reason we are here we're so happy to be back I mean this morning and I'm so anxious for part two amen amen hallelujah how many were blessed last night praise is wonderful name you know I the Bible says in Proverbs you see a word and due season how good it is amen anyone can speak a word you know and is open but in due season how good it is amen and this is why I feel good because a word was spoken in season last night amen so therefore if you have any word in you you've got to feel good how good it is amen I appreciate my good friend brother feel open [Applause] hallelujah as I said last night he has taken time to from his very busy schedule to drop in and be a blessing to us from which we are so thankful for him too you know he leaves his family he leaves his church and just trying to be a blessing to God's people everywhere no one really knows really what a minister goes through there's a lot of mountains is a valley but when a man of God is called God call man very different than just men God corn brother Bram said he cannot even send a revival unless he has men right ready to carry out that reviving and so therefore as sure as he has promised a revival he's preparing men to carry it out amen amen and we all know this so much has been spoken about the Fife own ministry and who was this and who was that brother Graham said if you love me call me brother man you see the fivefold ministry is a business of God amen God has put in a church some apostles teachers evangelists and so forth and you know he will anoint his men with a certain anointing that it will speak for itself amen I remember I had a very interesting conversation with with a another brother one time and I we were debating whether this person should be called this and that they say you know if I said he is but he's not it doesn't make him any less I said my word doesn't make him bad amen god that's nice put in a church amen and it'll speak for itself yes say Amen so we see the revival and the the move of the Holy Spirit around the world is because God has trained his men a man through the fire through the struggle through the battles and that is all to mold character because he wants one day to put his men in position and we realize without you no power without character what would we do look like Joseph Amen he come out finally out of the prison and who he was even we see him in the next scene on the right hand of Pharaoh he had power but he had to meet his brethren he could have now if he acted any other way the history of the Bible certainly would have been very different today but I believe with all my heart he went through all that he had to go through for a purpose - main character amen amen before because he could have done great damage to his family but when he recognized his family you know what he saw and he cried and he saw how can I have anything against you I mean I mean the whole thing was a plan anyway you didn't know it was a plan I didn't even know it was a plan but God purpose will be fulfilled Amen even there are many things that we don't even know I'm gonna tell you something God is leading us somewhere but before we arrived we've got to go through certain things we've got to go through certain problems we've got to go through certain fiery trials and we wonder why why why is because Amen well Joseph remain in jail not one day longer a one day earlier until God knew that he was ready so don't try to rush God out of your trial he knows when to take one when to call you out Amen praise God so I appreciate these God called men and I wanna on behalf of the church here apologize for I think we had some technical difficulties with the streaming online I think the sound I went off about 3/4 into the message or so but we got the entirety but we copied the DVD so it's I'm going to send it to brother Isaac to have them put about put it up on the on YouTube and we are committed now to really upgrade our system to make sure that these things don't don't happen again because the world is dying the world is longing for reality for so long we have heard so many is it so many wonderful messages you know it's blessed us but at the end of the day the life is in you and I I was so blessed when brother Theo was sharing with me about a message that was preached by Minister about power power and for the very beginning in Genesis as long as God was in the human heart and that man was given power over the elements over whatever you see but today everybody wants power but what is lacking is that man on the throne that's the only way anything outside of that is is control its control control control you control this control this church control enter you can't go you know people become members of church and they they check in and they can't get out that's not God's church a man the Church of the Living God is free amen with one body praise the Lord we love one another so with that revelation you see the power will be there I believe in the church and in the manifest manifests as sons of God but we must remember the key thing you'll have authority and you'll have power and you'll have control as long as he is in your throne that's the way it was in the beginning anything else outside of that was not so from the beginning praise this wonderful name amen god bless you richly so I want to welcome you off to the original faith Gospel Tabernacle we are a small Church here in New York where we love the Lord Jesus and doing our best to hold the banner up high of his endtime message this is a big city and we all know that people often say here we live to work and work to live very a few moments to really take a breath and pull aside and to just think about the things of God and things like that but we New Yorkers we're tongue we have to be tough if not then the devil really will take advantage and I think the bride today we have got to have an attitude Devlin I'm sick of you that's right I mean the devil bombard you with thoughts mind battles all kinds of and we don't say anything back hey man I like what brother a brother from Nigeria told me one time their favorite saying in Nigeria do you know who I am perhaps hey Do You Know Who I am they may not be anybody but Do You Know Who I am amen Do You Know Who I am and that death question right there just like makes the other person a man but you have to tell the devil Do You Know Who I am I am a son of a king a head not only you're saying that BAE men but you're manifesting their glory be to God and he should be more afraid of you than you are of him so we're so thankful I didn't get a chance to get all the names and so forth that were here yesterday and but I want to I want to greet for the Nick Edmonds god bless you richly from Pennsylvania Femi penny and sister virtue god bless you from Nigeria and brother are you the one from Ohio yes and you ivory calls you live in Ohio you took about bus about ten hours or so God richly bless you family in the back there god bless you richly you're welcome Amen I see my friend I have I can't say my good old friend brother Mike mail he's really hot trying to hide behind by the Isley yeah thank you I see him clearly mouthing amen been around a long time brother Dean Julian Walker policy is in the house it's just the Porsche god bless you welcome we love it each and every one of you and I'm ready for the word are you hey man I'm ready for the word and I told her a Pheo over this pulpit is his pulpit let I mean speak whatever is on your heart amen he was speaking yesterday regarding a kingdom but there's a quote that come to my mind and I just want to read it real quick before we have our brother because in the seat of discrepancy brother Branham says here now now we live through Luther's age Wesley's age the Methodist age all down through the ages and the Pentecostal age and each age is given a promise of the word each age is given a promise of the word seeing they have to come up to that promise of that word even though it may be a lot lower than what our word is of course it was and the people of that age that manifests it that promise word is the sea of that age Amen so remember the people that manifested amen the seed of that age amen the promise were for that age is a seat at a do you want to know who is C well it's not just saying I'm C amen it'd have to be manifested amen and those that manifest that word is the seed of that age oh it's manifesting time I better not start singing I like to sing amen the seed of that age according to what Jesus said right here they are all children of the kingdom that's right I listen this is it the manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seeds of the kingdom at that age so whenever you see the Holy Spirit operating Amen among his people those are the seeds of the kingdom glory be to God so don't don't question or a wonder why are people shouting and glorifying God and why the Spirit of God is moving we're manifesting the seed of our age glory be to God I don't thankful Haman I will never be ashamed of this gospel amen because it's the power of God unto salvation call me crazy amen amen it's too late amen hallelujah listen I think criticize ostracize everything light upon it doesn't matter those things don't affect me no more because you know why I have my eyes on the prize a man let me manifest the Holy Spirit amen and I want to be a part of this seed of that kingdom it meant that brother auger was preaching about let's stand to our feet everybody every man as we welcome the man of God a real man of God who has really been a real blessing as I said it's not many people that I really have confidence not men I don't say that there's as many good friends of mine and I do have confidence in but there's a unique confidence and brother feel of it because I see the hand of the Lord upon him and not only that I see where the Holy Spirit is trying to get his people amen he spoke about a vision last night amen we know the vision without a vision people perish that's right you'd have to have a vision a man and not only that then then there's got to be a road map how to get to the vision see and eventually we'll be living in division amen you see so therefore I believe very shortly amen that God by His grace amen will help us enter into that place where we can dash into the Holy Spirit amen into that presence of God amen and every promise everything that we desire we can go in and that I remember it's Ephesians when they crossed over the Jordan brother branham said that the miracles and things could not be made it wasn't it was couldn't be done in the wilderness Israel didn't possess anything in the wilderness couldn't be done in Egypt but as soon as Joshua crossed over who did he's meet amen he let the angel of the Lord even he could do those things things that he could never do in the wilderness son stand still a man he didn't have that premeditated in his mind he had a need amen the enemy was running and he knew that if the enemy would would run away they had a chance to regroup and he had a knee and he just spoke it son stand still amen amen and that's where Amen you'll see the miracles take place is in Ephesians which is the message of the out amen amen do you love him Amazing Grace how sweet the sound will get the preacher on to the pulpit and take your time he asked me how long do I preach typically on the Sunday that's a mystery but he can take us liberty today man I know I always ask people I'm just gonna introduce it I mean it'll come now I always ask people where are you going I know people who are travelling ok I see that I understand if you need to leave you leave but people you know ho yes I have to shop after Sunday I have to do this I have to do all the house clean after do this let me just tell you something that was spoken to me now again I can just repeat this but I heard that brother Branham would not permit his life to do any kind of laborious work cleaning the house washing the the clothing on Sunday that was Lord's Day amen so therefore we're many times we're in a rush we were just want to do nothing we rush home we wait we rush to preach a rush to preacher worship people oh and you know you have what I believe in the message of the hour oh yeah I I believe that too sure but when you're in heavenly places a bag listen I believe in the message of the hour but what time clock are you keeping God's time or your human time I believe in the message of the hour of God sign which means that amazing grace how many love brother feel of it we love him with all our heart Amazing Grace how sweet the sound [Music] [Music] if not worker where would I be like you see [Music] [Applause] [Music] please where would we be this morning Lord without your blood my sister Rebecca beautifully Sun Lord the blood Lord o written in red that is where the price was meted it was this opportunity for

for this cause I bow my knees in to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ from whom the whole family in heaven and I just mean that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might in his spirit in the inner man saying as the inner man his auto man but he want you to be strengthened in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by feet and that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length the depth the height and a little love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with the fullness of God filled with the fullness of God praise God and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge and oh my my knowledge have increased but we have to get into the love

of the loudest and last message of the church age and these seven mysteries several misshapen left off he said no watch he's a looter previous on my feet and come Wesley sonification but we are promised a correlation 10 according to Malachi 4 Luke 22 17 and so forth that has got a common other Ephesians to this this is promised friends not groups Ephesians and we find Ephesians is a parallel of Joshua so the previsions with a bit Joshua and there's more land to be taken some people figure this satisfied with a couple of books and tapes on the prophet and ice plenty like books and tips there's more land to be taken you see other warm water spirit now from profession to possession real and to be taken the only problem is the other cross Jordan they take it so doesn't make sense don't use it binoculars and same way looking real good let's check the map okay let's check these books and these tips on modern technology is zooming in and zooming out the bigger picture closer to you but you're not cross enjoy because there's a way to cross Jonah there's a spirit atmosphere across drive yeah there's something that will kill you controlling represents husband your wife your chair and your family the minutes 30 past or whatever you have to drop that's not a football thing we're talking about dropping and you had to drop this off all of these woods it's dropped when the spirit of

why brotherly kindness you could feel with that but but the chemist is the platform for charge it come upon you because faith is based upon forgiveness so all this tune your heart back to the faith of the fathers and you're grumpy mean and nasty on earth that could be defeated under the seat that can't be before the woman have a baby a sweet spirit comes over her regardless if she's a prostitute that's God's operation a man that sweet spirit that's properly kindness supposed to come upon the bride before the charge is splitted into a manifestation because the son support have to be born into manifestation did you hear that yes Jesus born grew up and he came to maturity and he came at the manifestation by coming to identify the book and say the Spirit is upon me any bit of duty words of God what sons of God have to be born as a manifestation so we are promised another Ephesians the spirit here in the scripture and if I believe we are living and Ephesians again back again we are living in what was left off in estate agents so Alpha and Omega that's what it's all about so that God hid from the devil and put it under the seventh seal this unfolding of this Ephesians and put the thunders to make the bridge to unfold that Oh hallelujah praise God listen Tommy said Maria in the last days we are given to understanding by the word we are going to understand it because it will come on Ephesians to it so you would not in ours you're not supposed to be confused by any promise it's too late for that if over 40 plus years William Branham of come on the earth there should be no

great place now for juncture divided to the people the inheritance that God left them Joshua have to take three things to do cross over Jordan fight conquer the land and divine you cannot be valid in dranzer conquered it is already apportioned come and take it up you can't do that you have to literally conquer the land and then is that people just cautious cautious and then King that common in

of the Holy Ghost into the land of the millennium Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah three steps even forgot his rod Insider the most holy please overnight it potted blossom and produce our months oh my when a man is anointed it goes inside a deer the rule is brought for the perfume and I run on the plumb to Aaron's beard and it went before him at blood drop there in the kitchen the world couldn't see him no more and every man woman or girl that ever is anointed of God walks behind that veil of God the Holy Ghost is in a secret place and look on the wolf drop behind him then he said here now looter the blood spirit justification what watch spirit water blood spirit no this last great step must come into perfection doc the holy spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it'll make the head on buddy unite together this last great step Oh glory to God let's continue a little bit talk about adoption the tutor brought bullet to the father that there was to be a placing of a son and we have we have seen one and the same son that was born into the family could be adopted into the same family or placed in the same family or give up position in the family was born into and I do believe that is what the work of the Holy Spirit today among the church is trying trying to place in the trench positionally apostles and and teachers and prophets before and we have seen here we go many false alarms go forth among the people which only vindicated indicated real genuine adoption wasn't have not before salon for adoption listen listen no what we wish last night about royalty and so listen up around words he was taken out in the public place and he was robbed on a robe past purple or some color of royalty royal Roop - those sons all mine and was set up to the whole city they could look and he was here oh my the next move of the church is for God after your scene for Salaam but no God will please in His Church correctly God will do that not a man picking man man has choosen man God sets in the church not some man set in the church okay so God replacing is just correctly apostles prophets teachers evangelists not man-made cemetery important important but calmly please into the church not theology removers and Coover Knights but go away please attitude as God has chosen as the Holy Ghost has tutored oh my please Pizza Jesus Oh hallelujah oh my mind there are traces of the journey we went good pitch 1302 30 just has something on peaches nori all right there are three states of the genie and their teacher that is Jenny but we are justified by faith believing on the Lord Jesus and so then in Israel in the wilderness Joonas no place of rest traveling night and day fallen a pillar of fire but finally they come to the promised land where they settle down Israel had not received their promise but they were on their journey so what can't give you inheritance on your journey the journey is like a wilderness walk talk like you could only get your inheritance in the land that is white jewelry could tell them when you point to the lamp take my boots with you don't leave it here put it in that land oh praise God in a hallelujah you love it please cross the bottom says but the believers and the killer was just an outfit that was going on to the promise they move over into the land and took the land as a possession let's not go on to the back to the Holy Spirit let's not stop believing Lord Jesus being baptized but we go on to the promise of the Holy Ghost itself how God has set in the church to labor pains they get tremendous sometimes I wonder church has grown in this one of my favorite quotes if you're hearing my similar might hear me cuttin it over and over and over say policy always equal same thing because it's uh it's so real to me I thought when you scored a set some in the church to deliver pains they get tremendous um time I when the change is groaning under the persecution of the outside world believe in our Lord Jesus yet if we have ego that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was to the Pentecost how they groan and cry under lima beans but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom then god has set in a church apostles and prophets on son like that oh praise the name of the Lord glory dog or demon God is trying to please his church and position to manifest himself manifest himself so all these sermons and teaching like you know people like to talk about teachers and teachers and their preachers you know the speechless sinner and evangelist to talk to the sinner and teachers does positionally please the believer and I ask myself what are the believers being pleased for you have to be pleased for power so it comes right back to the spirit it's not just teaching to

woman and he was saying Lord why don't you destroy this place why are you doing - and he was talking about negative old woman I want to read a part of a part of it barometer come behind the door she's my vision of himself sins coming black spot coming and blood she had a bumper bumping it off and so on in order to me I could see I'd like you to see him in the picture and the crown on him and blood in his eyes and face he looked at me and looked like tears all Methodist there's beer together spoken vision of Jesus he looked at me and I'm blood stains all over his face I said did my sins do that to you he nodded his head to me I said God forgive me I wouldn't I wouldn't hood to hurt you like that what I love with all my heart he took his side cut it with his hand he took his finger like this and wrote on my old dirty book pardoned I took it and threw it behind him like this in the sea of forgetfulness and laid out a new book I said lord I thank you I never tried to do anything wrong he said no speaking this is Jesus thinking now I freely forgive you I freely forgive you and then you want to destroy her now this was a woman at Barnum's casting judgment on he doesn't know he doesn't know story he does nothing about this is just eyes and the environment that he is looking at and this so the vision speaks interpreting hope of mana mercy in there he said know what I feel I forgive you and you want to destroy him and by that time the door come back and I was looking right at the woman sitting there I wanted to destroy her music on please and I was I want to destroy after I was pretty forgiving I just pulled it all back together we have been moving my arms while the vision was on I pulled it all back and I said father forgive me go right to her and I apologized you could play something you know playing softly I stepped out the door I want to do is oil drunk man see me there with her say you think there any was hurt the robot they got up excuse themselves and walk home to the rest of the room kind of stroll over that way and this policeman still playing a slot machine I walked over kind where she was at I said how do you do the pole thing look up and said oh hello I said could I sit down she said thank you I have company I said he didn't mean it like that I just want to say a word to you I want to ask you to forgive me and she said what did I what did you ever do to me I said wait just you wait a minute let me tell you she said yes and I I said I stood at the door and I pulled in a story I said right back behind there he showed me I was wrong she looked up she looked like it's about her she looked up she said are you brother branham I said I am she said you would have administered on there she's yes ma'am I'm ashamed for you to see me like this I said will you forgive me she says certainly she said said no I said thank you i sat down with a little boot with her and she said I want to tell you something but a brown and she said I passed by and seen your meters I seen it advertised and I went in I'm simply a shame of myself she said what would you believe if I told you my father was a Methodist minister I got two daughters would of them are Sonny's who teaches I said what happened she told me about a letter from a husband he run off with another woman she's got to drink started off she said I know I'm path redemption strictly illegal as you see I'm Pat Redemption I said no you're not she no you're not she started crying she said brother branham you think I'm not past Redemption I said why did he say that to me a few minutes ago I looked took her by the hand knelt down on the floor and there she gave her life to Jesus Christ you talk about slot machines stopping everything else everybody in there was she was crying and praying she got up went out to go home to a new life listen to this God showed me that my own heart wasn't right I want to see that again God showed me that my own hand wasn't right because I was trying to condemn her I'm not looking at what I come from - so we can always remember look back to the bit where we was huge from things will look a lot different we don't want to condemn no one love everybody whenever you lose that genuine love that's in your heart you've lost everything don't forget that when you lose love it's all gone remember that the love this little brother had all for you you remember the love of the Brethren I am NOT saying listen I am NOT saying all you organization break up an equalization I'll never it'll never be that way you will never do it just go through life just to same old mangling and first man's doing that's wrong keep your organization stay in there if you can that's all right but reach out an arm and love everybody else and have respect give him a little blanket too because he wants to get covered also it stretched far enough for all of us room there is plenty of room there's room for all of us there's a fountain for me there's a fun day for all of us who remember that if I could see our clothes this is a final code if I could see every Pentecostal Church the Foursquare blue open Bible standard Pentacles assembly United Pentecostal church and all the rest of them put the answer on one another and forget the differences just fell upon one another I will still let by so many paths and peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation are you ready for the closing words as long as Seaton got you shooting at one another he's just sits back and take a vacation you don't have to do more for him I pray I'll live to see that day and if you don't do it within yourself if you don't do it within yourself some kind of persecution will hit this nation one of these days you would long for one another then brothers of like precious faith so why go to this punishment when you can have a little piece of heaven on earth right now God be with you and I say God be with you god bless you but it just let's all stand up give them some presents [Music] praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand to pray did you appreciate that message I feel such a wonderful anointing in the place here in this moment we were encouraged to begin to dig Amen that third well amen before over the first and the second but the third well is this room for everybody there's plenty for everybody the spirited debry say come amen and I trust and pray that from this meeting not only intellectually we have been blessed and understood words that were preached but is very different when a revelation strikes you Damon a revelation puts you into action that's right to practice that which you have heard amen amen because there's no longer here amen I've heard so many over the years yes this is okay we need to drop our office and yet we've never dropped them see only the Holy Spirit can bring a real unity of the faith and as feared as you but we've got to get started brother Berman said if we can only get started God will do the rest amen and let us also remember there are some that cannot forgive and will never be able to forgive because only the seed of God amen this is why John said beloved let us love one another for love is of God and every one that loveth no one he that loveth not for God you may know the Scriptures you may know this quotes you may know the Bible from cover to cover but you don't know God because God is love amen and that we need to stop just talking about and we need to begin to practice it and I trust and pray that brother open had expressed to me that he is willing to come by every three four months as the Lord will lead him I wish he was coming back next week actually I certainly would appreciate that myself we're fighting we need all the help that we can that's right and but I am so happy that when any man of God points people back to the god I mean there's so many people pointing to different things and but we need to get back to the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus amen to think what the whole mystery of this entire Bible Paul wraps it up into one thing Christ in you the hope of glory that's the entire mystery all that God was he poured it into Christ that's right and as brother Ovid saying oh what a mighty God that created the universe I mean two spaces there is no beginning no end in the universes and listen you would think that his son would come in a way that would it be impressive to everyone and everyone would recognize supernaturally oh yes he is a son of God I know they come down and condescending it to God the form of you and I soorma are the former sinful flesh because he had to do that in order to be a kinsman redeemer he had a job to do he had to be human he was total human and he was total that's what's beautiful about that how God could be so great and yet make himself man and yet still be God going around with a little beard and everything else has brother brought his brother Theo was speaking about it's a healing to sink raising the dead and everything else and there's some people that today you hear them saying oh if I was living in the days of Christ I would have recognized them no you would not have because if you don't recognize this you won't you would have never recognized what Amen praise the Lord because this is the word and the word is Christ amen so therefore thank you brother Ovid for taking your time I appreciate you and may God bless you bless your ministry bless your church and give you strength to do what God has called you to do amen and to travel and in different places you go and it's difficult friends to to do what you know what a preacher does and getting on planes and traveling through time zones and things like that arriving jet lag and then your preaching the next morning and you just don't know where you're at actually but I'm so thankful for the sacrifice my brother has made a man amen and I want to sing this song and we all sing us in worship I Love You Lord amen and I lift my voice to worship you oh I want my worship to be a sweet sound in his ear let's all sing this song with all our hearts and all our souls and our minds if that's the way we feel and I live my war [Music] worship you owe my soup we Joel take my key [Music] what you be let it be a sweet sound [Music] do you love him let him know why [Music] my [Music] oh my son [Music] or take [Music] you nice me it's me [Music] whoa [Music] [Applause] where she you [Music] my [Music] or take [Music] my key [Music] and what you let it be a sweet it's me in your ear while the musician is playing let's lift our hands and worship Him in your own [Music] and I live my boy to worship oh my read your Oh take your Mikey [Music] let it be a Smith Smith [Music] hallelujah to the lamb hallelujah do you love him praise this wonderful name you know the word goes forth and it's time he meant that we express our thanks to God we can never thank him enough for what we have heard today and this weekend has been glorious and I trust as the beginning of many more I am speechless I moved I am inspired and I have often said this in my heart this message is they'll say of the Lord [Music] as many distractions in the world today we were speaking to the church not too long ago on it may have mentioned it last night I'm not sure but Peter was wondering about John the one that Jesus loved who leaned on Christ marasmus chest and he asks Peter asked what shall this man do and you know sometimes we just looking at what others are doing and yet [Music] Jesus said what is it to you if he should tear it till I come and then we're not a saying an interpretation it wasn't correct that's not what he said he said but what is it what is it to you if he should tarry till I come and yet it was spiritual because John did see the coming of the Lord amen so many times Jesus may say something in the Bible we think it's natural and so forth but his spiritual meaning but the main thing what is that to be follow about me and I was reading a quote how brother Branham said this is why we are holding back the adoption of children because we're so busy trying to figure out what shall this man do why shall desk this one do but if you're focused on he said follow thou me Amon and he is a word hallelujah and I'm so thankful that we need to get refocused there's been a lot of distractions here and there we need to get refocused follow thou me let's get back to the middle of the road amen and I don't care what you see on the internet what you read and how many defections and so forth and how many people on the internet want to disprove this message I say to you what is that to thee just follow thou me because if you have a genuine revelation you'll be like Peter who said when Jesus asks them will you leave - Peter said where can I go you alone have the words of eternal life amen and I say today amen this is the best I know this is the very best I know you alone have the words of eternal life amen and to think that God would take me out of oh I'm out of Harlem out of a place that I don't know if God didn't express his mercy to me and take me out of that place I may be in prison I may have been dead may have been whatever because many of my friends ended up in prison dead whatever and I was so shy growing up never ever that I ever in my wildest dream expected to be a witness for his name [Music] but is not your choice it's his choice a mana be an abyss his choice he's got to give you what it takes I know God loves me I know why he took me from and I always tell the church and don't forget where you come from a man we like to judge somebody else and so forth oh no but we've come from many many hard things and we like to judge but no no this is what makes God so beautiful amen we love him because he first loved us the relator you always speak about love oh I love love God is love amen amen and I want to always make sure that I express my gratitude to him we try to sing this song yesterday I said we tried I but I didn't have all the words and I was mumbling amen above all can we sing that above all one more time because it's such a beautiful song above all of all Kings above all nature in all created things above all wisdom and all the ways of man you were here before the world above bah bah terminal create a thing [Music] and man [Music] we're here before but you were crucified laid behind stall lifted I reject it [Music] you took [Applause] [Music] [Music] like trampled on the ground of me [Music] listen [Music] bulky above only urinal above all wisdom and all man you were here before [Music] down above water wrong there's the world has ever known above all wealth and treasures all there's no way to your watch [Music] crucified laid behind stop live rejected and alone like a rose trampled on the ground [Music]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] shouting I shout to the Lord [Music] and I like what brother Neil said seven seals half seals whatever they think men amen you know the time has come for character that's the main thing amen and character God you know you realize that God cannot give you care that's right character is not a gift see that character see is a victory amen and we have a challenge we have a test we have something to overcome and that is what will develop the character that Jesus is looking for in our life amen so therefore that's what we're striving for to strive to be positioning please [Music] god bless you thank you all for coming I appreciate you anytime you're in this area amen you're more than welcome to come and join in fellowship with us Amen we people ask what do we believe we believe everything we meant what Amen what's in the Bible what brother Graham says we've been there as long as it lines up perfectly with what brother Graham said that's what we believe that's right so God richly bless you [Music] just one there is just one announcement that I want to make after this service after the service we're going to Venice and it's typical of what we do we will be meeting or rather gathering so people wanted to know I want to know where we'll be afterwards it is lunchtime there is an island buffet the Chinese buffet it's located at 1874 Grand Avenue Baldwin so that is where we will be having lunch and I wish it was within our means to pay for everyone here but we certainly cannot do that but if you want to come and join us that's where we will be and it's moderately priced there's a Chinese buffet or you can eat those that like to eat oh that's this is your place so god bless you richly amen and let's have Heavenly Father is truly we can truly say from the bottom of our hearts like those dear God that there was a man that come by these two disciples didn't recognize this man but this man joined them on their journey and begin to speak precious words and they were astonished first of all because this man appeared not to know what was going on in Jerusalem and the current events of that day but sometimes you like to sneak up one our fellowships your God and to manifest yourself in such a way until we recognize and it's the presence of the Lord among us and they had a testimony after it was all over did not a heart burn within us as he spoke to us along the way I have to say the same thing did not our hearts burn within us today yesterday today yes as the Holy Spirit ministered to our hearts amen a heart of burning law would fire and we realize that the revival starts in the individual heart of every person father may this weekend start a revival father god and may it spread out there God to different places father for the glory of God because we realized their God that there is coming a revival and the only revival that there remains there's an exclusive revival is to Brys revival but the Branham referred to it as the brides revival denominations they've had their revivals they've had their healing campaigns they've had their dance and that but oh but this revival Oh we'll bring a translation faith your God in so much dear God that oh it'll give us that faith dear God to walk like Enoch walked and take a walk with you Lord and be found not one day people be looking for us looking on the job looking whatever it is to our homes and we are found not oh we have taken a walk with Jesus hallelujah that sounds like a fairy tale to some but that's thus saith the Lord a man there's going to be a bride it's going to be a rapture and we're so thankful that we are part and we are elected to that group there god that's gonna be not only called out Laura predestinated Laura because brother Bram said that this bride will not be like the first one she cannot be the seed the word is in the bride already so therefore there can be no other strange seed that can enter in that bride their God we cannot be deceived Amen because the word is already in us father I pray that you would give your people traveling mercies whether they're traveling far or or locally father may you bless each and every one on of them on their journey and may they think on these things they're gone the things that were spoken this weekend what a beautiful weekend it was and if it be your will we would love to do this again father perhaps at another location if to be your will and Oh we'd love to have brother if you all would come every three whatever two months every two months or three months as his schedule permits may God bless each and every one and bless those that are on the Internet I pray dear God that you this weekend would have been a blessing to those that were listening the father and if they have not if they don't know you as a personal Savior father God may they realize that what they have heard what they have heard amen is a call a man to come and make right with God because we cannot sit and listen and say that's a good message good sermon we have got to react to the Word of God and make our lives correct with God we ask these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen may you be with your people we ask it in Jesus precious amen praise Allah okay man god bless you you may be seated thank you for coming amen may God be with you is my prayer once again if you want to for the Xavier can you I just
