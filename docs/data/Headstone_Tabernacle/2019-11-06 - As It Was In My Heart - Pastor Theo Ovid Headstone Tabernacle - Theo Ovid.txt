want to read Joshua chapter 14 one refund was 6 to 14 Ezekiel chapter 36 we want to read from verse 24 to 27 I'm proverbs 23 one or even Bustillos verse 7 reading from Joshua chapter 14 we have of the six then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and giggle and Caleb the son of Jephunneh Achilles quezon I said unto him don't know it's the thing that Moses said unto me that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God considered me and D in Kennish Pinilla forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from commish Pinilla they spelled the land and I brought him wood again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me meet the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed Lord my god Moses sway on that day saying surely the land where I died feet of cotton shall be dying inheritance and thy children's forever because that was holy father the Lord my God now behold the Lord had kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the Lord speak this word of the Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and five years old an army yet I'm strong as the other I wasn't the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war were to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord speak in that day for our who distint that day or the Anakin's were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said I'm Joshua blessed him give unto killer the son of Jephunneh Hebron for inheritance he burned therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the kiss tonight under this day because he wholly faulted the Lord God Ezekiel chapter 36 reading from verse 24 or 227 and I will take you from among the hidden and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land you can underline own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your idols and will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes you shall keep my judgment and do that scripture from proverbs chapter 23 one verse verse 7 for as he thinketh in his heart so is he that is pretty father we thank you for your word interpreted us tonight and bless it and Lord may fire fall upon your people tonight that it'll be stilled in feet and your law weaken them to righteousness granted Lord in Jesus name I ask that a man and a man may be seated welcome tonight tour Wednesday night service thanks for coming out it's good to see all of you here tonight are we looking to see what the Lord will do tonight amen praise God appetite of the night as it was in my heart as it was in my heart this is Joshua's this is Caleb's testimony he brought word as it was in his heart okay let's go leave submitted Exodus for a man the spiritual man had looked on in Egypt and see persecution rise and see Joseph taken away in order that prosecution could rise the Prophet said that and this here referring to is there reasonable fear who knew not Joseph now remember Joseph save Egypt by his vision an interpretation of the vision that that if hero had he actually see Egypt and his family came and God bless and everything else no Joseph was thinking now that he puts the aggression could rise hallelujah and Joseph will be removed and Berta banham type Joseph as freedom of religion and all this America which is relation to team she was founded on freedom of religion isn't that right and we know that the B's system going to be activated where the scenes going to become persecuted or pressed this is our promise that we're gonna have a press come down and at that time you're gonna see the table in effect and burn around give testimony what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in its fullness so there's our money physician to come but I want you to notice what God did when they came out of Egypt he gave testimony to them go into the land these twelve brothers these twelve ministers these twelve whatever you want to call them of the twelve tribes go into the land and bring back evidence to the people of what I promised so your car just this pop this thing it has to have evidence of this thing you have to taste this thing you have to experience this thing you have to feel this thing it's not a book thing a talking a written thing it's a manifested thing it's real grapes hallelujah when God tell them the land full of milk and honey he wasn't imagination it was a reality so these brothers had a testimony the land is the good land but it's just we can't take it because I have too much a chance in the land or glory to God but Caleb out something in his hand and tonight you I found something in your heart or glory to God he said I wholly follow the Lord he wasn't thinking about a Giants he wasn't thinking about his condition he wasn't even thinking about his sickness he wasn't thinking about nothing wrong him hallelujah all he was thinking about it what God promised and friends we have to come to that spot or glory Nick what I was a young man coming to this message and look I'm green and getting old and then over here some time or glory to court but listen to this Caleb said I was young no glory not gonna just as strong as when I first started out and this promise is so real we just are stronger when you first be aware able to possess that land this land the promise or glory of God and these back certain people these circles God said I'm gonna call you out from and bring it a own land and I will clean you or Chloe the Corps because you have God's people that's why you find you you know the FI you leave your dirty and filthy he bring you all to clean you he said a new heart out of you but you have to care agree with this one you can agree with that one your blood can take this one your blood I'll give you a new heart I'll give me a new spirit I'll give you a heart to watch me I'll give me your spirit that's you're gonna agree with the would all glory to God that rebellious heart you angry we're not near like what the preacher say yeah yeah fight way the preacher fight for this one and fight that your own old spirit but I'll give you a spirit that took a liquid peaceably with your neighbor that you could be here yourself and then I'll put my spirit inside your spirit and then you're gonna walk like me they're gonna talk like me they're gonna act like me because I'm gonna be in you get the Lord a show this is your promise you are you born in same shared with me pretty but he promised you a new heart you promised you a new spirit you promise you his spirit so don't feel bad tonight he promised let's think oh she ate but your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as wool white as snow come on let's let's talk about that let's let's discuss this thing Oh hallelujah so I want to see that now watch so for persecution to rise he said Joseph had to be taken away in order that the position arise something has to take place because Barham says they're gonna close down these kinda churches now I know I know we hear in that here but overnight you were so things just change sir overnight these know gaming this is prophecy remember the devil controlling all nations including Trinidad all all the laws this settin up mister come against the Christians and only will you know the devil is a judge Daniel Baram says they're waiting for dynamics and United Nations to enforce the law so Dale Whitman dynamics of Vietnam dynamics dynamics will bring me fat all things because I'm a makes the spirit to bring the seats the life Los Angeles sinking as a seed that was spoke not of a prophet but that spirit coming behind that seat to make a manifest and it sees none time you being filled with the Holy Ghost is a seed your deliverance is a seed your healer is the seed and the spirit come behind the seed to make it manifest in your life the question is if you believe it because sin is unbelief is if you believe it because sin is not smoke and I'm drinkin send his unbelief because according speaking on you believe it that's it you could have it tonight let me say it again if you here receive it and believe it you can have it so Balaram says how we can see the wheels and the wheels moving go trip and everything back after this Exodus to this time when he would call his people back into the land again back in the place in position where he could bless them and place among them the one he had promised they had to be in their land remember that to come out of the land they were in to get into the land of the promise before the promised Messiah could ever come so you've seen that Messiah Jesus can come back Egypt we can come in the wilderness dr. King on land that is the promised land and the bride after coming to her lon to see the promise of the hour that God promised you know we have a lander go to you know God call you the Baptist Methodist assay I come out come on come on come on come on yes they come on no no what what you going into we got redemptions in two pots coming out of and going into you've come out you come on you

in through Oh glory to God hallelujah and the journey was just a journey through the promised land so yeah battles you have site you have upset that is part of the journey but you reach yes hallelujah to get into your land into your promise into your anointed mr. your blessing is your inheritance your individual inheritance because Caleb was readable anybody else he wasn't give me my individual inheritance I ain't asking for nobody I'm talking about no child or no group or no family give me my mountain or glory to God have a revelation this motion is made and when you come to that support when you see what is yours you fight for it you're not looking if citizens are taking it or brotherbrother taking it no your mother sister sister or brother brother you want to know what is yours and you're determined [Music] rabbana they have to be in the land remember that I come with the land that they were in to get into Lana promise before the promised Messiah could ever come and a church has to do the same thing get out the bunch group of rejected people rejected me sovereign Syria reach a consent under which I can invite my promises because I come out of that because God had meeting him and that foolishness goddess and a prophet to openness talk all seven seas for people to be in unbelief all seven sins open the end time sees the Seventh Seal and underneath you have seven thunders that is the Kazakh right to get back that just by exclusive by promise only the price responsive study by invitation then only break and hold that ticket exclusive by promise seven thunders Oh glory to God hallelujah let's continue he said no watch and the church as do the same thing get out that Cooper rejecters over into the promised before Messiah can everybody manifested you see it converging say Amen then here this balmy drop the life of the Messiah manifested making a church ready a bride yes you know teacher teaching that yes alone mistress revealing that he has no explanation talking that he said the life of the Messiah manifested is going to make a church ready not talk he tested manifested these are not talking this is this got to come to pass life of the Messiah then what is the life of the Messiah is fit its virtue its knowledge is temperance its patience is godliness it's probably canis that is the life of the Messiah [Applause] or give the Lord a shot on that these were Jews here this is the life of the Messiah that hasn't been manifested or glory to God as masane the rapture is not outside in the Raptors inside out you have to be Raptor in you okay the Lord a show that's a powerful thing you know when you see that you will understand you cut bribe to gonna rapture you can't pay somebody to the rapture you've got hold on to me pastor Han and go in the rapture and have to have it inside and no man that's inside of you but in Ezekiel he said I'll give you a new heart I want to give you a new spirit I will put my spirit inside a deer or glory to God hallelujah something after stop within you or give the Lord a shout it has to stop within you have to have a testimony from within you have to be no word like Caleb as it was in my heart give the Lord some praises or glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah quarter won't your head that's why what mom says the woman of the well she had five money one shell event was this UHN and burn said she was clean and insane and dirty outside the Pharisees was clean outside and beauty inside and God reject one which is a Pharisee and accept the other which is we wanna do well because she had on his heart when he said Coco your husband she said none he he spoke the truth yet these devious yeah coming up on the hunting halle-loo that's my god up shake up what were you the angel who are you I mean I because I am a smart man that's true people I just rip people I'm a ripoff man I'm a con man J was a con man y'know or smarten anybody family friend relative you name it it doesn't matter you ripping them off but he came to his Waterloo he came to his cross he came where you have to be change and he didn't want no kind of oh I'm coming up listen as they get less he wanted a change walk hallelujah changed talk a change life he didn't want some show as a blessing hit him he wanted a transformation I know yet the Russell with the angel I mean wrestle all night long it was not

tonight until you give me a you all and he talked then you could go but I will not let you go until you bless me or glory to God and Jacob Russell so much he name and all change hallelujah haha he said to Israel then he had ten sons then they get the Israel the nation of Israel because a man wrestle with God and the blessing began to floss from oak of his loins or give the Lord a shock I feel good tonight all glory to God hallelujah praise God amen you may be seated he said a woman marrying a man disagree with him it will be first continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend his expose I mean perfect harmony like once one-on-one man because they're going to be one flesh then so he's making a reference and coming back to the church then when the church can get in such harmony with God until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because there won't be one praise God I don't want to hear about wisdom being the greatest gift we had that for 350 years that is not like not know scripture creatures give us the fifty would together oh yeah they would fit in to get a long time we fitted so we fit this so we fit this so we for this so it's no the harmony but God until until what more revelations more mysteries until the manifestation of the bridegroom began to start to work into the bride he even said with the thunders he said then you are worshipping the Living Christ when them thunders begin to roared and manifest among the people then your worship and the Living Christ him moving in and out or glory naquadah giving you the promises this is your promise your promise and no matter how I'm telling a promise if I did any morning this is still true this is what you have to look for there are three stages of the journey and there are three stages of the journey we are justified by faith believe in our Lord Jesus Christ forsaken land of Egypt come out sanctified by the orphan of his blood wash from our sins and so and then we are seeking a land a city that's coming or a promise sordid Israel in the wilderness they were just types so Jana is no place to rest traveling night after night following a pillar of fire whatever Springs aware after a past rejoice when you come to church and a water well just break up upon you oh my god your soul get refreshed the coal get revived you're going to a journey it's a personal journey it's not a church thing you know nothing is not teaching and we teach everybody who is receive the you age they not video you know there's not that tender this is individual honor you go into your own stages but you under promise Oh hallelujah praise God so watch new police arrests traveling night after night watch following the pillar of fire but finally come down to the promised land where they settle down that is where the believers comes you first have to recognize the sinner then he is separated by the waters the washing of the water by the blood and by the would rather believe in the Lord Jesus being justified by faith and then what he become a Cetina he's on a journey to what a promise God made Israel had not yet received the promise and they were on their journey please do understand that is where you Nazarene and permanence of what fell because Israel when they come to a spot of chemists Benina when the spies when lumen said the land is great some of them come and say we can't take it because the cities are walled up and so forth but just one Caleb stood out he said we are more than able to take it now all I mean anything but spilling on all I mean the same talk from prophet Moses you know but these guys these just one killer guys them saying them talking different from the rest of the ministers all them fellas in one man and one Accord we can take it didn't egative up all the promises of God hallelujah take the easy road of mechanics mechanics until the mechanical be spirit let me say it again this easy to do now when I talk about the Prophet that will produce the before the doctors on touching my wife which will go down and this and that I'm done on this historic history because they are free to believe what God promised I don't want to false manifestation I won't no impersonation I wanna false manifestation I want to really promise that listen listen them guys could have said it taken it by faith no but he said Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high he tell them that after mysteries open after understanding open but a torch after the world open here leave nothing on open you know everything was open enough he said we either wait for this thing my father have to send this thing holily if I know God be comfortable not come so I can't give this to you this is cord have to bring this down or glory to God I never went in the upper room and it was praising and blessing God continually every service they worship and because they know what they promised didn't know what they believe didn't know what to expect and only quad cuts and dynamics no man could bring dong dynamics in that sense it take God to send them he said to all that you can do get your heart right get your mechanics right and if you get your heart right get the mechanics in order then only he can set all the dynamics or Chloe that God one should catch that your top is the sanctified your job is to stay in to worship your topic to stay in the word and you come to church and worship and Firefall upon your life or glory to god this is your promise because you creates an atmosphere sitting in the upper room you gotta do it here you can't sit here and expect the preacher to bring some wafer there's no Catholic priests preaching to you or tip the Lord a shout oh you have to fight like Caleb I am just as strong as I was before wise virgins saw something that he fully first did not see the wise version was willing to do something the freshman was not willing to do the foolish virgins was willing to be ordinary Christians ordinary church members or believers the white version wanting something extra make it be hold on in church they said give me more your more that yeah more where that come from make up feeling empty tonight I wanted to film a cup of blood poured at him lit up wooden I want power and my job I want to see the power when I see when I talk about poor I'm not on with second one is you know I'm done with power of life lies that you could see you overcoming you don't need to see no miracle a No we want to know you're overcoming the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life our power to have life [Applause] maybe season like you are what you are waiting by yourself when your church a coupla holy can play righteous you can real long time a long dress is if when you leave churches doing the same thing and behaving yourself thanks buddy tomes Kimoto it's how you live after you leave the church so the power I talking about his power to live a holy life power to say I am sorry power to say that's power you know some people carry Penticton say I'm sorry I was wrong it easier to say no mistakes were made and all things work together yeah but when you're wrong you're wrong when you're wrong you can be right and wrong at the same time we were all wrong we were all born in sin ship iniquity that's why have you all needed blood try spirit cross pipe razor covering so I am fighting for more doctor no more teaching my mom miss reason I want the mysteries and additionally doctrine but I find it for life there is something amico never something that I know both have that deep in me calling for something that God have man can supply that apostle prophet teacher pastor can supply that we think about that [Music] when you realize that the man can't supply that then you record with a minute the man is a channel by which the word comes to me to go and get what God promised oh not even Moses cross in Finland Moses carry on I'm going to listen watch and don't touch me am I gonna cross shuttin down behind that because his behavior was kinda troublesome to God and Musa was prophet I'm gonna say as is you okay moves is it a fabulous ofany a crossover a crossover we just wanna we just offer one verse one Moses my servant is dead not let me have some mourning for Moses you know Moses my servant is dead no Joshua we have to go into visions no Joshua you have to manifest and tight because of the New Testament we'll have a book called Ephesians no Joshua no a fear of the breach nor fear in the bridge hallelujah because Joshua was type in the book of Ephesians and Ephesians is ready faith was anchored manifested Ephesian was the standard the standard error of the age of Ephesians where the light I feel like we're the original apostle it was that and we come to the last age reversal of profit is there no heart of the father will give the Lord a shout so the faith is to come right back to Joshua okay the Lord a show right back to this Caleb just roll fit just give me my Mountain [Music] how much pastors have a church fighting with next judges minutes of fighting model groups I said we have no favorite new church my fight and wrestle with the promise you think I will let some other children somebody where all the crazy stuff and touching the devil stop me from getting my promise on it only hindering that I have is me nobody can hinder you is you hindering you if you want to keep us fight for it you could pass for it it Jacob or me we could say you see I pray half warily I ain't pray like English maybe angelic call me up the dannika cesium thing to keep rain looking for brittle Danica cell you know what I've done has done my keep on fighting so to come to Daniel mom said if Daniel stop praying Indians upcoming think about the ancient almost reached you and you give up the injured a cannonball good Lord all that distance I have the cover boy for this man believers ready believe when Daniels had a whole lot in prayer so here stopping real good news doc thanks over there you know he's caught up you know he's building you know you see time running out you see revelation 10 shall be no more and people leave back just as prophesied people get them cool off just as prophesied people falling away just as prophesied and he's getting desperate because he see things closing in Oh glory that God God already say who put the hook and goddamnit dog and pull him down Oh glory to God or Russia get pull come to Syria Oh Holland up close to Israel is war going on hello oh it's wise next and then two hundred thousand thousand loose against the bride trying to cut you off in the resurrection by trying to cut your from perfection and professions going back to that spirit or glory of God which was before the word ojala in the beginning was the word but before the beginning was the spirit found in our spirit we have to go back to that oh give the Lord a shout I know I know what I'm looking for I'm nobody and get my eyes off of that they can preach whatever the preach some no seen in Joseon dis have this engine and deeper than my kind of stuff crazy stuff have nothing to do with a promise of the power or glory things in my imagination or anything like that they're making the god of their own pots I want the core of this world God SN a prophet for me to roll dice and say could it be what if it is could it be could it be this what is come out in Sagittarius I don't want to be couldn't be lucky I want to see the Lord nothing else I don't want my own dream I won't toss ideas I want what God said mama said a dream does me perfect so Donald retire you dreamed this regime this is the dying by Anita interpreter for the dream a dream is not accurate unless the director said a lot thing but he said a dream you need that's like when two people come to tell around the dream he will tell them what they leave out and tell them fellows tell let me dream I remember say no man can do that he say listen of all ahead all the play Nolan's wise men and all the controllers Sumida me honor can all have better or less meet him better with this Daniel because this Remos terrible and I can't remember it you see which man could do that remember Daniel I'm intrusive send for Joseph you see God let me talk to me God let me talk to me Lord and when he come back he could tell him exactly what you dream and this is the dream and this is the interpretation you can't fight that this is a dream this interpretation goes to be whole and same year Elijah by scripture when brother Branham come - interpretation of Malachi he fulfill that some character wanna say is not that it's not that Oh glory to God them chokers the tool no back sitting people gonna say that profit Falls and this falls on me Falls and decision Falls and this Falls it too late we already pregnant with Messiah hallelujah hallelujah we already pregnant with God what were you go produce we go it must produce God you pregnant with god

grace justification sonification that I'm punch and they could move any further listen that whole generation perish in the wilderness but true that when evented promised land and put back evidence that was a good deal and so God let them fellas taste it and then they couldn't go further Church them with 40 years making turns in the wilderness hallelujah then instead of the people going on

pillar fire come and this pack it in the corner after when you come out standing you want your on a week with whatever you look at you know when Moses with a consciousness of his colon with an awareness from an intellectual conception that he's called for deliver when he kill him and so you will feel like you know what early age of 40 years he's a bang eating newspapers you know no text no

God finishing Moses Moses was done not even white could stop him change mañana so we say eyebrows a ask my way boy he's alone Egypt way to take over in my recession but he know even take over you know why because he had the word we say who shall i sir sent me because he want to know who will sell me the people already a motorized himself then we would run amok when he said tell I am saying when he gonna say I am that I am no you can just talk as if I am saying you and there's no manifestation I so many proof so when Moses started rock miracles so they know him send him because the non-bank are do that even Pharaoh thought he was just man doing the technical favor and customary simile me the low will be a business Dante so they're cuttin a candle and they do the business and doing the business turn second a snake to you see the snake contest which Moses Nick Anderson did he started if you forgot him in the meeting let me go to the next room Alan boys had a peppermint wrongs after wrongs and fleas and flies and frogs and when he started hit him so hard who here say take your people take your flocks to take your place take everything on go let's just get out and God could put such heat upon that demon that devil that was over you that caught pepper him so much that you say release it black I can't I go on i gon let you go let your family go let your house go that's what we talkin about man that steam with the Word of God don't give up oh my hallelujah all glory to God amen how God how God has set some in the church to deliver pains or they get tremendous some time when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just too real to us I wanna I don't want no less the Holy Ghost you see in the upper room they fulfill three steps they were justified they were sanctified they receive the Holy Ghost and they were adopted in the upper room when come to us we get four steps luta justification where's the certification Pentecost the baptismal Holy Ghost and Burma or the world but once the fullness of the word be restored we are gonna go back to three steps while Peter yet spake these words Oh God yeah yes sounds probably kingdom and after sons born into the kingdom place positionally then through their mouth life gonna be speaking out from the amount of sons of God you talk about a genuine fight for ministry it will be Christ in these men Christ and the following a posture Christ in the former prophet Christ and former pastor Christ in the form of a teacher Christ informal evangelist caught Phil Gore corner not politicians not message Pope's Britain for the kingdom he say you will hear from them and yesterday we'll take over you will hear from the pastor you would hear from the prophet you would hear four evangelists so no group could go up on a corn on top what eyes bright that's cold you know what I say no man could take note it aside and say it's not a promise coca-cola to decide a but lies that man wife must be that my group no no that men working you know there's one buddy and by one spirit we are baptized into one body there's gonna be one church which will be the body of Christ that's the mystical body of Jesus Christ and no man could control that no man can hit that no man could govern that you could be working in that but you can't control that Christ is the head of the body called the church or cuz the Lord I shout and I said again Christ is the head of the body called the church not some ministry somewhere Christ is the head of the body the cap coming to the pyramid the coming of the headstone oh mighty could take a little more tell the truth tonight and get started yet he said when a church is groaning under the persecution of those side world believing in Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost just is real to us and was a Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born one and positionally born to into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he gave in to their to speaking with tones interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom gives even or can Americans said what package is included the whole package five for ministry and the gifts of the Spirit isn't that right Oh glory to God now what is the land of promise to the New Testament believer the promise is this home adoption the Holy Spirit for shall come to pass I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh your son and all shall prophesy of our missionaries and so on then left Egypt was the world did you notice before they cut in a promise kept up nothing no all right now these some question answers today the church has come to justification to looter unto salvation to the method known to the light no isn't to the time of the promised looter Wesley and now the time of the promise the promise is the baptism of the Spirit now he's not talking about Pentecost 1906 he's not my dad let's continue now watch the promise is the baptism of the Spirit which is promised all to the old testament and new to the promise is behold I send the promise of my father upon you Peter said that on the day of Pentecost this that that is the promise the promised land here we go is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit church is out this is the Holy Spirit now this is not coming to church this is living which husband living with your wife living with your children living on the street living and running water the groceries living in this land of the Holy Spirit listen that is God's promise for the church is to live here we go in the power of the Spirit it's another world I love that the first thing is another world it's another land you have to come out of the condition you're being in to come out and live in this form it's lamb hallelujah so just as the promised land was promised in the Old Testament to the children Israel which was Kenan and we have a promise also which is the land of the Holy Spirit so what did he send some angels from eternity for what he says Senate for some angels he said the gada all the scattered world to tie it back into the world to do what to bring down the holy spirit let me say it again he sent some angels takara all the scattered word that tied back into the word to bring non holy spirit because with a restoration of this word comes a restoration of the spirit because the word and spirit is one and the word was capped at two seven ages so we're at the brinda scattered word to bring back the fullness of the Holy Ghost in this hour to produce the ministry of the sons of God but the manifestation the sons of God when born son fill son speak and the word is created just like that or tell the Lord I show glory to God and the Holy Ghost being loosed in the last days because he released the word in the last days so God will loose the Holy Ghost in the form of by your promises and when you receive them by the promises we receive the Holy Ghost it would form or give the Lord a shout you receive the mechanics of the pyramid in you it would form because the secret is the word is in the bride the word the night is in you the mechanics already in you Oh glory to God and the mind of crisis charity the Holy Spirit hello here I'm the capstone coming upon you to quicken and make it alive Oh hallelujah praise God could we get there go some praises Oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord Lauri it's another world it's another land you have to come with the Commission you have been in to come to live in this land up under receive the promise remember you shall receive power from on high after this the Holy Ghost upon you after when that's not looter that's not Wesley dice not Pentecost that is the position of the Holy Ghost himself which came in the evening time the program came to introduce the person of Christ because the Pentecostal they don't have him okay the Lord of praise offering do you see that now so power is promised when after the Holy Ghost is come upon you what's this he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to be come it doesn't mean you're adopted its power to become its power to claim its power to grow its power to move the ladder of this pyramid well glory to God some little miracle and some little miracle and you're feelin tops among in some way you don't get them started that's what the public in the tender Pentecostal all these tongues and speaking in tongues you know getting started but you want to be Co placed in a place of trying to be tested to be a prove as a son the right kind of a son or cancel or - Oh hallelujah there's gonna be sons please positionally into a position of power because of the tractor full of their life oh my all right drop of what I wanted to see tonight I just need Curtin know Oh hallelujah Jesus is not going to ask me if I was a Methodist Lutheran Baptists he's going to judge me to what I was in my heart that's right that is what he will judge us all by so you see after all these shows any men you have to know what's in your heart because from the abundance of the heart the mode speak if any hot corrupt color franklamacchia mode if you have evil evil come watch em out oh he said out of the heart proceed adultery and fornication all things inside comes out of a man hat that's why often you heart tonight new spirit of his spirit hallelujah now don't think is just one church we represent all the churches and many of the people have come into the line that is a Methodist Baptist metallic I have never seen one that come but what was healed when they come upon the basis of faith so it was like a flip not been healed Methodist not been here no no no let's continue I wouldn't corner I have seen people come that were renown Christians and stand there and be told the reason that they couldn't be healed and I see streetwalkers prostitutes people of in in Fame come off the street and be healed of crippled blindness and everything else sinners no you don't have to be a Christian to be healed it's a big one [Music] like that is Jude you don't have to be a Christian to be healed but you have to be a Christian to stay healed because from the Bible Jesus said go and sin no more Lisa words that come upon you so to keep the healing to become a Christian but God heal everybody who are faint to receive it they get it so he's not mean and angry God in that way he just let the Sun Shine let the Sun of righteousness arise he was raised but Abraham he's in the prayer line and I believe my dear friend my name in come like a flood God raised the stand against it you release magazines and things how seats on a rampage God a reasoner stand that don't worry we believe he's always on the right side he's always above the enemy all the time do you believe that lady sitting right here yes you had more faith than you thought you had feet is a subconscious thing lady faith is not a mental act it is something that you could sub consciously do it people try to look to the intellectual faith when faith doesn't lay in there reason Lee is their faith lies in the soul and I said that's what penicillin is it kills the few germs but it doesn't touch the cells that I've been taught on God has to do that so he is the only healer God is the healer and then it's your faith in God and many people have faith subconsciously and doesn't know it you mean you could be sitting here with a whole big bunch of faith tonight and do you even know it yeah yeah because it's subconscious let's continue you talking about a woman there was a little German woman she got instructions and a little prick Lord thank you script it says he had to call in your friends or your pasta if you can if not one of your neighbors confess all your wrongs and ask God to heal you and places on you and then believe that was the instruction on e Pretlow the little German woman it was amazing she put it on underneath garment like it was instructed she had the neighbors come in and three she confessed all her wrongs and when she got it on there she put her hand over her hat and said no old man devil you get over me and right up she got and went walking across the floor after being in a wheelchair for 20-some odd years it is that simple you know there are many times we try to reach out for something for a certain kind of a fate and you don't have to have some kind of super feat to be healed the only thing you have to have is just the feet that you got now you know in the Bible the blood was applied and adores by hyssop and it was ordinary you don't have to have a super feet how did you come here how do you know you want to leave how can you drive your car how do you move your hand you do it subconsciously because you believe it you can do it that's the way you believe for your healing it's just settled it doesn't take some higher education some super duper something it takes common faith and God just believe it like you would if your mother would said to you some to get something just believe it like that they took blood ordinary healy hyssop they put on blood and pass it on the door but a Branham yes I will take the Stoney heart give you a new heart the heart is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit I will give you a new spirit I want you to watch the order many people get mixed up here they think they got the Holy Ghost but it just gets a new spirit I'll give you a new heart a new spirit then I will put my spirit no the new spirit go give you a new spirit and that new spirit God give you so you could get along with the Holy Ghost that's good that's good that's good that's good the new spirit is for you to get along with the Holy Ghost we go without a new spirit you from fact the Holy Ghost will you all just favorite you could even get along with your neighbour you couldn't get along with yourself so you're no you couldn't get along with God so God give you a new spirit and many times on the enthusiasm if you'll watch the light that appears I hope I'm not Newton but I hope I'm uncovering a lot of times you dink you have the Holy Spirit you said I sung I spoke in tongues certainly being that closer it might do all that but that is not ready yet the Holy Spirit bears record of Jesus Christ he gives you a new heart give you a new spirit then he puts his spirit his spirit in you it's like you don't have to go around pretending you a Christian man the new spirit brings new life the holy spirit and your new heart your new heart new spirit and the holy spirit was right in the center of your new spirit how o clock and your new spirit grows in the center of your new heart new heart in a new heart new spirit in your newest worth his spirit that's the mainspring when you receive the Holy Spirit is goes into the middle of the dispensed dispositions of yours you say I quit drinkin I quit smoking I feel like a different person oops wait a minute you just got a new spirit but the Holy Spirit come in the middle of that spirit and when he come he make every main motion every intellectual everything agreeing right into this middle of the wheel God says if the days of miracles if Jesus is in yesterday forever the Holy Ghost will be a record and say Amen or do you believe that when you have the little temper fits on your flyout and your tell lies and your press alike and your job senses and you're so selfish with your organization and your song I reminded you can only hear you cannot hear another minister you mean that here buddy yeah let me read it again when you're so selfish with your organization that you're so narrow-minded you couldn't hear another minister just remember the holy spring isn't ticking inside of you every time somebody's looking down man looking at only my ambassador here they messed up big time because your spirit holy space and you wanna hear the world all glory Allah God so the Holy Spirit will make every movement like Christ it will make you Christ like the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience fit all those things are hold on to that holy spirit so you can say we don't know what we're known but you and this person long time long time it is important grudge you gotta drop it that's a forgiving hope the person and move on yes yes you have to do that you have to love you have to love enemies have to look God has a blessed evade enemies the love let me say it again going to bless you with enemies that you could love I hate teaching that Jesus teach that love your enemies if only have Christian believers we are no enemy challenge the enemy coming a few most original everybody else because it's not in your group or not in your circle or Nothing your kind love your enemies mean trust that so that means you hand suppose they gonna fight with nobodies are you our emotions is not so much as jumping up and down you could do that a shindig will bring that to you a little pizza I rap music or some pixel cookie somebody get it up in the foot just like the music in church I shouldn't think we'll do pearl to you well he already saying here is Indiana but the Holy Spirit brings you into operation or in control of God that you walk in peace and in love and joy with long-suffering and gentleness you see it isn't something you do it is something the Holy Spirit does in you remember you can stop smoking and stop drinking that what you stop doing but when you get the operation of God that takes it out that's different because if you can stop everything you don't need Holy Spirit you just need to be you need to be the stopper you stop talking in here you stop smoking you're stop drinking you stop lying in your stop taking little smaller wine I decide and fun things and stop all other stuff somehow you manuscript Yahweh's wine good for you buddy or something and have a drink on a mountain underneath that disease you stop all of that see so therefore your recognizes God's operation in your life then you want more of him you worship Him the grid first and him praise God Amen so what you see it is no longer intellectual thought of your own it's yo-yo it's a subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit yeah but around I wish I could show the praises of God around the world to that you say you wish she could shout the principal a little more game there are many times we are put emphasis too much on I think on one citizen thing we put too much emphasis on emotions because the group of yes here tonight I feel very much at home in this pulpit I'm very welcome and I know I love you and that's why I see those things we have put too much emphasis on our emotions perhaps maybe we feel as long as we are shouting and praising the Lord that's fine I think that's good you say but in this Philadelphian church just received me as God's servant let me you would like to know what I think is it greatest need of the church today what I think what I think is lacking is no salt reveal the people are not broke up enough there is no burden seemingly you give me someone that so talk about lost souls they just cry want and a revival so bad they could hardly eat people are so selfish they wouldn't even testify the people about the Lord they really invite somebody service as far the concern they say man dies it is like the hell there's no travel of soul but when you're broken right now I have my sons and grandchildren and so on like that and I as a grandparent will want the children to be filled with the Holy Ghost because I'm sure to be filled with the Holy Ghost I have to pray for them I have to be concerned about them I just say well you know because they are my children or grandchildren because what what what they mean I can't give them God alone could give them so then we have to pray with a burden and unsafe same thing with the church if I could I give it to ya give it a already while holding about for every service I come hold me back at about a bank I do want a share a feeling selfish no the Bible said the kingdom is preached and everyone [Music] this continued every man who taught me preach upbringing bringing bringing bringing because he said no minutes I could bring a revival we have for 45 years on wave arrival he said the people after bring it so I always understood the vision have to be transferred to the people and when you see the vision nobody could stop you know pass the cost of your worship and no nobody can stop you I'm approaching your board like we said the president of America even Prime Minister trailing that dead children when the children come they got a wheat wheat in our region thank you man child everybody know that a man child how come you see daddy that oppa don't know yet son is here to you your daughter's here to you so when you in your condition go to the father in general say like a son come in looking back soon as ever we come in she life life terrible but she coming thanks you're right thanks your father going to he could be President in the country he can be CEO he could be whatever it is he coming I'm meeting he said daddy I want to talk to you sign a meetin this is emergency okay he will stop the meeting because I have a son now your daughter so that having us that's almost shut down for one sinner [Applause] when I say welcome to repent any holy rejoicing they say Allah here at look she repentant only here at look a repentant he will leave the 99 to go after one thanks heavens behavior and Brabham said when the last name come and holy not know your neighbors not the last one boy shut everything is fixed after that you have to keep reaching up today I got up I was sharing my wife you were seeing people see some experiment with thousands of all people help you over 60 those who give money and do the gift service and I said the people that give service to others live longer than those who just give money those that help in each helping this one and they go into this home helping this wanna help in other words the joy of being selfless the joy of Sylvane the joy of doing this extended life than just passing the box is a science come with a thing you know what bombs eternal life is living for others so when you are you you yourself for myself and I you know what we don't it you're like shortening no I know gospel a I just see all right let's go wrong because a little more tonight let me stretch a little bit just a little bit if you notice this subconscious is where you live that is where you yourself live and that's the reason it's hard for them to have feet they say yes I could fit but don't hear somebody tell me it's not for you you hear any would say you can go free yeah because of a conscious and ever subconscious your conscious you're in the word and the contents want to agree with the word your conscious want to receive the word you can't just want to agree and work with the word but there's some god I've seen something else but you don't know what going true watch that's it friends many times in a meeting I noticed in a meeting watching these tapes they'll come back to the lines for the of discernment the people will be sitting there look like they are million miles away they don't think they're not even thinking about healing it's not their intellect is this subconscious working then he said your subconscious is your soul buddy spirit so that is why when somebody dies the human spirit breaks up not human spirit is we have CX CGC Doctor degree CEO all the position your nice house a nice car or Latin say that spirit when that breaks up now this soul comes up what you really are at the subconscious level three subconscious is really you subconscious is really very hot is that another man tink in his heart or his subconscious who is he see if we think he can't make it you can't if a teacher could make it you could make it because in your heart hallelujah killings I brought wood as it was in my heart so those other ministers couldn't deceive him because he had awareness and a consciousness of the promise of God that was more powerful of any enemy any giant David also had the same thing he never met Goliath before he said cut your head off even without a sword he was so convinced because he was operating at the subconscious level I [Music] mean subconscious level already know victory all glory to God I just love it tonight they had no one stone will do what he take up five I'm here and Tamika liya just one he needs a nobody took a five but he ran to meet Goliath he was operating on a subconscious level we can endure something Oh glory to God hallelujah where the bottom says no look not long ago to show PUFA quadword is the Bible said as a man taking his heart is that right the old-time infidel user say no isn't that crazy there is no mental faculties in a manner is a little blood blood but last year he said a big hand and science found this listen to this as found in the human heart there's a compartment that does Eve my blood cells in it it isn't in the animal it's only in the human it's the occupant of the soul so when a man distinct from his hat God was right Oh glory to God so therefore the other cometh consciousness I'm gonna be healed I'm gonna deliver tonight is my night this is amazing and this is of conscience he says take a walk from where I live the ARIMA to go up the drive in a sin a walk think about twenty minutes not walking on walking I want to walk up and I want to walk down so I walk up into the bank come back then when I started green cell phone I hadn't seen the rings on I wonder fulfil the complete to go back to back as a reinforcer I reach in his taxi stand away I could take an axe and go home I had a choice take a taxi and go home or keep walking keep walking I ain't boy like any ring and after I passed I gave him around a Noreen I said look at that now boy what if I jump in that car I break the whole spirit I want to do this thing because my body needed I feel good I said look at that in life sometimes these choices you make other choice the taxi Sun is there rain is falling wasn't falling hard but that's why I come here you know rain drizzling oh come here you know but I forget that I decide I want to walk I gonna keep on walking and I just walk straight to that you know what to induct is the level of this subconscious at work there if you're consciously watching arenal god we go for my body I'm gonna open up and what that I am and walking many things that happen you've got past your consciousness it's not what you see it's what it is healing from what I see so what you're here is what you deserve I will talk about Delilah what Samson didn't see is holy devil you see Lila she knows she good she look pretty everything else here you know and she's a nice person of good intention but the demon behind she is a no good intention he intend to strip Samson and the demon seed is a channel he could use so keep on fellowship and keep on going he will cut your head off befooling would what she didn't the hill okay so watch the right all right so we almost done thank you lord beginning economy I think we almost done no tomorrow night you know you come and listen a while cause you want to take our time and leave that would also close that the devil would deem up a little speck a room to move and when you let your feet run out to its kin till hear this you begin to believe and let your subconscious go to actin then the fate of God we'll back it up come here your lecture fate run out until they come to the place where you begin to believe like I love the words he uses it when Abram came to the fullness of believe them so there are different degrees of believing you come into the fullness of belief and this promise is yours now when you understand you not a serpent seed you not a devil child then you are son your daughter and you cannot be denied it even your backside you cannot be denied even if your fall your cannot be denied you have to understand that by revelation so when you say father coming home me you're coming home alone because you know who your father is cause your faith won't do too much he say your subconscious has to move in the direction your faith is moving and then God move faith moves behind him and confirms it the reason of a lie detector is because man wasn't made a lying so when they put the instrument on you and ask a question and what Tanya I need much inside what kind of tongues because your body wasn't metal lying why because it picking up it at the level of your subconscious here this one are the city lies you know that subconscious is where faith lies so then you can see different intellectual feet I'm spirit feet hallelujah somebody made a message and the only under intellectual but the subconscious is rather real feet lies oh my I have to cut it down oh my lord Oh hallelujah I want to ask you was there many times that you people in here many of you have seen times where you just know something's going to happen it looked like it was impossible to but you just know and we're going to happen did you ever had that that is feed that is a pun just working when you go past your own feelings and explanation you're not going to work out Oh hallelujah it settles you Oh glory to God hallelujah I am done please something for me Gideon hallelujah if you want to receive the Holy Ghost let me tell you something my dear sister I don't remember that Meisel he said he said now what must I do for my family use the same feet that you're using for yourself for your family commit them to the Lord believe with all your heart that you want to be saved don't let it come down from your natural thinking here let it drop down read on inside subconscious a lot of stuff about getting in harmony with God and not even you have any Holy Ghost but Holy Ghost having you and you surrender into the spirit it takes us to another level of the consciousness of God and you're witness of his presence or on your life he promises and his angels are wrong you think comfor wrong you lose that fear him he loves you tonight cares about you tonight he cares about your life and your needs tonight don't be afraid don't be ashamed let's all stand up
