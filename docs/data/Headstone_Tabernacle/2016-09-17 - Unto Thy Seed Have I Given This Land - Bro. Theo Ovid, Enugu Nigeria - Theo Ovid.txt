Bram ration 107 that angel that seven Angel messenger he came to that church Revelation 3:14 isn't that right to call a bunch of people out of L because the bride had to be called completely out of the church age that's was a hidden Mystery if the devil Read The Bible you only read up Le this year but there is a priday that you are called out of Leia to fit into a supernatural that the devil

vindicate the word hallelujah praise God give the Lord shout in the house notice this last messenger before the coming of Christ the messenger voice Noti when he give his voice on Earth there was a voice Heaven M you God until he spoke on Earth in heaven watch watch so in tune with God whatever he spoken God Echo Heaven you know what Echo is s if a man hear from Heaven he's going to say what the Prophet said because the spirit and the prophet and the say the same show oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God what's that fourth verse translation God's voice speak his predestinated people Bon come back in the message organization spirit because the spirit man Spirit from Luther and Wesley bring it right back so we are fighting inside outside but we going to win this fight because this fight on

somebody say Amen oh hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah come out of her be not partak of her sin out of Dogman Creed to the word made spirit and life praise God what's the last call come out of babyon what's babon confusion you may be seated praise God say write the vision and make it plain we can run after 40 plus years nobody supposed to be confused in this message if somebody's confused that's bonus what we everything is De praise God Jesus a blind man cry out to Jesus and Jesus ask a blind man what it is you want me to do for you Jesus know the man is blind but the man have to speak it suppose he didn't want his sight suppose he want his daughter healed suppose he want his right delivered Jesus here specifics not General bless me Lord you don't know what you're talking about when every was talking to God he said how you going to bless me see I got tieless and God answered him back he said no come outside and cl the Stars so shall I see Hallelujah he said I am God and I brought you out to inherit a land and he said how shall I know he said I tell you what to do sacrifice get things line up just right and when Abraham made that sacrifice that bright light pass through the pieces and the I'm explain it God was separating himself oh making a covenant with Abraham and in the D like we make a covenant we shake hands we say right we agree on this and we hands God made a covenant by by light oh Hallelujah through the pieces making sure he understand when Jesus died in Calvary his body went up and his Spirit came down there's going to be a reconnection that spirit that has come down is to fill a bright body so you come here to be f up with the spirit that was released oh blessed be the the name of the Lord praise God be seated he said watch my brethren that's the reason I'm against it organization it's unscriptural it's unorthodox it has proven to be false I'm not seeing there's not people in this organ but where the church has made up but as long as you stay in that system you are part of it if I stay in the United States I'm an American as long I'm a citizen of of United States Cy I am Amer a citizen of that system you are showing what you are and in this last God calling hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelu God is calling be to Plum out of it there's going to be one more ride as as God call a nation out of a Nation Jesus is Calling a bride out of a church you hear what I said he's calling a bride out of a church glory god he said now watch hallelujah praise God when the baptism of the spirit is from church handshake Church em church instead of there we go the virt and so on the presence camps not groups not special ministerial Wars into presence of Jesus Christ praise God to us the prophet says and here we are promised last days Cann change of by The Works of of Jes is it's not what I seing I'm just your brother God proven prise God the M age the reformer age and now the call interpret life in a different kind of a way there's only one waytt know prise God hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus amen amen amen amen prise go to William you can only open six seals because Christ is a seven seal right we find out 10 hallu you see that when Christ came down like a lion Ro it and s t the voices who was that that was a man that was Jesus Christ only Jesus Christ The Covenant Angel the voices Oh and he praise God you believe that hallelujah praise be to Jesus the church field that don't need the Holy Spirit the churches will tell you that men can turn up and give intellectual talk and almost make you believe intellectual talks would be so smooth that it would deceive the people gospel it is man who can handle the word and such a way that he can take any intellectual person if they're trusting the intellect would condemn the I want to talk about who we are he said he said I want to speak ofen realiz up the street father father where are you God holling and if you notice what caused this in the beginning God and he made a covenant with man equ you do this do that do that when God man made be just like me on the earth I am God over the universe and you will be a minor God on the earth Dominion myant with you don't touch that tree because the day you eat surely die so watch so man breaks the Covenant man just can't keep his promise there's only one man cannot breaks the Covenant every time oh Hallelujah hallu glory to God oh Hallelujah so in Genesis he found a man named Abraham ID worshiper not a better man call him by electioned Hallelujah called that man whether he spoken drinking running around come out of a country come out of your people come out of your church and I'll bless you I'll multiply you I'll give you didn't ask God anything God was speaking God was blessing in life made a cant with Adam broke his and when God man man always breaks for there has to be some preparation God made Covenant with Abraham unconditional he said I have already done it and have I given already aded Hallelujah already filled with the Holy Ghost already walk in the head of devil already conquering already the SE the Lord sh in [Applause] [Music] am he made Adam was if you will I will but with the Abram cant you may be sit down Abraham Covenant watch it was given unconditionally I have already done it God is determined to save man he just couldn't accept you being a sinner so he the promise of Virgin conceive promise to rede to to bring so you're not sitting down here as a sinner go deeper than you are sinner not because of your fault you are sinner because if Adam did not fall you were son because Adam was to speak for other Sons but because we fell Adam fell one man and whole creation fell but then one man came and Resto you may be seated so when Adam fell we all fell with Adam say come and pay the price and say I'm going to have a process of redemption I'm no longer going to bring back man as it was in the beginning let man because Adam had no character training or character development or pain or pressure or tears he was just spoken Let There Be and there was so God said I'm not going to do that no more Amen brother I'm going to send you
