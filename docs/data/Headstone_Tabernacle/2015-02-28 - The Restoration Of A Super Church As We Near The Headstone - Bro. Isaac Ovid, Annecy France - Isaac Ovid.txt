salute all the Believers who have come from the East come from the West come from the north north come from the south because where the carcass is the Eagles gather together so we have gathered this weekend around the bleeding around the bleeding bloody word of the message of this hour how many appreciate the message this morning the unsealing of the vision and prophecy for full Redemption the unsealing of the vision and prophecy for full Redemption God bless you brother amen you may be seated I want to greet you once again on behalf of my wife and behalf of the church back at home we are proud to be identified with you you brother bam said he's identified where the people who know that God is unveiled the spirit of God is moving and I'm identified with you tonight because you are a church on fire the final Church the final Church the final voice to the final age will be individuals who have taken a stand who have taken a stand for this message of Mal can the church say Amen so are you ready for the word tonight if we can stand to our feet we're going to read uh three portions of scripture tonight and tonight we'll have a prayer line and we are under great expectation for God to confirm his word tonight so we are going to read uh from The Book of Joel The Book of Judges and the Book of St Mark reading from The Book of Joel reading uh chapter two and reading verse 23 and the Bible says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer my great Army which I sent among you and shall we go to the Book of Judges uh 16 and reading from vers 27 now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samson made sport and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes and the last scripture reading from the book of St Mark 16 verse 17 Mark 16 and verse 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not H them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preach everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen amen shall we bow our hands in a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your holy word any man could read the scripture but it takes the Holy Spirit to bring it to life may you speak to your people tonight may you take me completely out of the way Lord and may the word be prayed with such power Lord that the sick would be healed the Holy Ghost would pour out the chains would be broken lives would be restored Lord and great Deliverance would come to your people Lord you promised a Revival and we are under expectation tonight you promised deliverance and we are under expectation tonight you promised to pour out your spirit we are under expectation tonight Lord may you speak to your people tonight take me out of the way bless the word to the hearts of the people in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise amen well you may be seated tonight amen so I have a title tonight the restoration of a super church as we near The Headstone the restoration of a super church as we near The Headstone my inspiration once more Lord once more Lord is that your prayer tonight once more Lord and we read that scripture in the Book of Judges now the house was full of men and wom and all the Philistines were there they were having a celebration because they had finally caught Samson and brother brandham said it's all right to have celebrations it's okay to have a celebration but not this type of Celebration because a Son of God had been broken a Son of God had been trapped a Son of God was in prison Samson was born for a purpose Samson was born for an objective but on this day it wasn't looking good for Samson the Bible says the whole house was full there were 3,000 people in the VIP section who were looking down at Samson and brother Bram said they must have had some preliminary events different things to entertain the people but the main event was going to be Samson all of the Philistines they had heard about Samson at the very name Samson they All Shook and trembled those in the VIP section they were happy to be in the VIP section because they did not want to be too close to Samson because Samson had a reputation wherever Samson went wherever Samson went something was going to go wrong for the Philistines so those in the VIP section they were happy to be there but they were very nervous because they told them they caught Samson but they didn't really want they did not really want to be close to Samson because Samson was a dangerous man Samson was like a nuclear weapon that they did not want to explode and I say tonight the devil is playing with explosives is playing with explosives because in this room tonight we have some explosives we have some weapons tonight that God is going to use you may be [Applause] seated I'm just building a foundation tonight you see Samson had stepped had moved moved from behind the word and because he moved from behind the word that's how he got caught if he had stayed behind the word his hair would have never been cut strength would have never left him but what Samson did not know his mistakes and his failures what he did wrong had pushed him into his Destiny it actually pushed him right where God wanted him because God wanted to put Samson in the middle of the enemy's Camp so he can do Maximum Destruction so God allowed situation in Samson's life situation he could could not understand situations he could not explain and he found himself surrounded by the Philistines he didn't know what was about to happen but in God's mind God said he is right where I want him he is right where I need him he is right where he is supposed to be and tonight you are right where you are supposed to be oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody say amen God doesn't make mistakes God doesn't make mistakes there is no accident with God you are not an accident it is not by chance that you are here tonight you are here tonight and Satan's Eden to be a weapon to tear down the works of the devil for a long time for a long time God has waited to bring you to this spot and it looks as if you are weak looks as if you are defeated it looks as if you're backsliding you may be [Applause] seated blessed be the name of the Lord this was the same Samson one time they sent a whole team to get Samson five men not 10 men over maybe a thousand men and they say we got enough men to get Samson Samson looked around him he didn't have a sword he didn't have a shield I don't know where he was but there was a dead donkey somewhere and my Bible tells me he picked up the Jawbone of a donkey and when he looked at the Jawbone and he looked at the man and the men looked at him they started to laugh at Samson because the mathematics was not going to add up it was not going to add up it was supposed to be impossible for him to win this fight but when the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Samson something happened to that ja the little thing he had took on a different power and he began to kill men who had swords men who had weapons Samson began to swing to the left he began to swing to the right because the spirit of the Lord had come upon Samson what do you think is going to happen when the spirit of the Lord comes upon this group comes upon this church you may be seated you may be seated when Samson was in the spirit Samson was a super church when Samson was in the spirit Samson was a super race when Samson was behind the word no devil could stop him devil could defeat him they tried to C Samson in move the gate because nothing can stop you when the spirit is upon you when you have the word in you you may be seated can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah I'm just building a foundation God has always been interested in doing something beyond the ordinary he loves to do things that's just different in the beginning there was just darkness there was just chaos there was just confusion and God looked at it and said let there be light and there was light out of nothing he made something God loves to come into the middle of a situation when everything looks all messed up change things around and God had to have certain people at certain times represent him but the problem was every Super church had to come to an end because God had to unfold a certain picture so Samson a type of a super church he ended up being broken he ended up broken ended up weak Samson needed to be restored he needed his strength to come back he needed the same power that he had before so he said lead me to the pillars me to the Post lead me to what's holding up this world system and a young boy let Samson right where he was supposed to be and Samson began to pray and he said Lord Lord I messed up but avenge me of my two eyes in other words I made mistakes but the devil had no right to take out my eyes I failed you but the devil had no right take out my eyes the devil didn't give me these eyes the devil not supposed to take his eyes so he said Lord avenge me my two eyes and that prayer hit heaven and Samson cried out once more Lord and that prayer brought a restoration to Samson and tonight I am preaching tonight that there will be a restoration of a super church as we near head Church Say Amen you may be seated Hallelujah he may be seated so let me get to my message tonight Jesus came to have a super church and that super church was formed on the day of Pentecost but before the spirit could even pour out they had to have a word Revival and that's what we're doing this weekend having a Revival around the word because in the upper room they were in a word Revival they were praising God continually nobody had to tell them to shout nobody had to tell them to worship because the word was open to them the word was real to them the word made sense to them the word was present tense to them the same word that they had all along was more positive they were sealed by the word and the devil he hated them for it but he wasn't bothered he wasn't worried when they had the word but when the spirit fell on the day of Pentecost and connected with that word that's when the problem the devil's Kingdom started again because Jesus was the biggest problem that the devil ever had when Jesus died the devil was like on the day of Pentecost Satan wasn't even too worried because he did not understand what was going on but when Peter walk by the gate called beautiful and he said silver and gold I don't have but such as I have I give unto you Peter was represented the super church can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated but that church it fell into the ground that church had to die and understand this friends the devil cannot attack the spirit his only means of attack is against the word because Satan knows that when word and Spirit come together he is powerless Satan knows that when mechanics and Dynamics come together he is powerless so when that Alpha church when that super Church fell to the ground Satan he was rejoicing because the word was lost brother Bram taught us that the word is the conductor of the spirit so the conductor was damaged broken when the church fell but we thank God for the seventh angel Malachi 4 Revelation 107 Luke 17 because his ministry was to gather the scattered words and rebuild the conductor so that once more the spirit you didn't hear me tonight once more the spirit can move through the conductor so God had to wait for a people who would be the Omega word bride who would be the Omega word Bride for that people a super Church you may be seated Hallelujah why are you saying all of this brother Isaac I'm saying this tonight because the devil has no problems if you go to church the devil has no problem if you stand up the devil has no problem if you Clap the problem the devil has is when you have the same signs the same wonders the same power The Same Spirit the same anointed the devil has no problem if you lift your hands but there's coming a day when you will speak and what you say will come to pass there will come a day when you will lay hands on the sick they will recover there's coming a day butam said right now we lay hands on the sick when we have a super Church you command the demons you will command the demons get out get out get out that's the super church I'm talking [Applause] about Hallelujah Glory you don't hear me tonight you may be seated the devil has no problem when we have a convention but if you leave this convention with the bapti of the Holy Ghost then it will be a problem we are here this weekend we are here tonight to create a problem for the kingdom of the devil hallelujah hallelujah this is what came for amen seated oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah Hallelujah you may be seated let me nail this down again the devil has no problem but you shouting he has no problem if you reading the books listening to tapes if it stays just there but there's coming a day when it's going to change the ministry of the word to the ministry of the spirit when the spirit connects to the word something happen happen something has to happen something has to happen you may se you may SE I feel like I'm in Nigeria today why it's the same Spirit there's an anointing here may be SE hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God you may be seated move the you may be seated Mo the please simp hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory you may be seated just for two minutes Glory listen young people I don't care what you have going on right now one's the word one's the word is in your heart the devil is in trouble I don't care what clothes you have in your closet I don't care what's going on in your school the fact that you are here tonight makes you dangerous because once the word is in you the spirit connects with the word said the Holy Ghost comes to give you power the Holy Ghost gives you power to overcome the Holy Ghost is going to give you power over what you are struggling with over what you are fighting be [Applause] seated the mistake the the mistake the devil made was to let you come to this convention the mistake the devil made was to let you come to this meeting because the word is being preached and the word has a seed the word is a seed it can only bring forth after its kind so the seed word you have received this weekend only produce the same life could only produce the same sign could only produce the same wonders could only produce the same Miracles and the devil cannot stop it somebody say amen he may be seated hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah I've already left my notes Let me say something tonight you may be seated the devil has proven that he is not as smart he's not as intelligent as he thinks he is he keeps making the same mistakes if the devil knew what was going to happen if he put Samson in the middle of the Philistines the devil would have left Samson in the prison but the devil messed up he brought Samson in the middle of Satan's and he started to laugh at him if the devil only knew what was going to happen when Jesus died he was never going to let one drop of his blood [Music] spill he was never going to let no blood spill he would have kept Jesus alive and I say t if the devil only knew what would happen after this weekend if the devil only knew the power the Dynamics the spirit that was going to follow you because the spirit has to follow the word the spirit must follow the word hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated that is why it is so important to say what the tapes say that is why the devil fights a word so much you may be seated that's why I love what brother oid said this morning all of the tests and all of the trials and all of the problems and all of the situations are to do one thing take you away from the word so if you you can make it through whatever you are going through if you can make it through whatever you're going through and stay on the word you'll be all right so I want to encourage you don't look at the problem don't look at the situation don't look at your husband don't look at your wife don't look at your son don't look at your daughter because there's a power coming into the church you will be able to speak and your son will have to come you will speak and your daughter will have to come you will speak and the sickness will have to go there will be there will be a restoration of a super church as we near the head you may be seated Hallelujah you may be seated tonight we're going to get to the quote but I love this quote as we near The Headstone students of brother brandom's [Music] message would know that we are to Unite with the headstone we have to connect with the headstone but what is powerful but theam said we would be a super Church near The Headstone in other words before we Unite with the headstone there's a special power in the church in other words every day that passes brings me closer to the so every day that passes I'm getting more powerful so Satan should have killed me yesterday should have killed me yesterday because today I'm more powerful than yesterday and tomorrow I'll be closer to the headstone and next week be closer to the head I can almost feel it I feel it calling me why we are magnetized to The Headstone and we are getting closer we are getting closer we are getting more powerful glory to God you may be seated pleas just [Applause] one everybody feeling fine in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Bram said we are living in the end time and I believe it's time for the restoration of the church that was promised that God would send in this last day and I believe that this is the day that when the word has been preached and the day is getting dark and so evil till according to God's word he was going to restore all that the caterpillar had eaten the Palmer worm had eaten will be restored back again in the message the restoration of the Bride tree brother Bram said now that's the tree that Joel spoke about he said it cannot die the worms eat it down but it couldn't die it root in its root it had the predestinated truth in other words no matter what the devil did he eat away everything but he couldn't kill the tree it looked broken but it was not dead can the church say Amen am hallelujah amen in the church age book brother Bram said now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation W age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word brother Bram said this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to the Pentecost of the beginning the church say Amen all these years of being in the message was to prepare a people to be a super church just as it was in the day of Pentecost but this time was going to be different because the church the first church already went into the ground this church is the same church it's the same grain it's the same seed it's not going to go down again this church is the church to give the devil the final knockout punch you didn't hear me tonight this is the church to give the devil the final knockout punch in other words when this church takes its place the devil is finished can the church say Amen you may be seated [Applause] from with the ROM said in the same quote now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration said the [Music] Locust the can the caterpillar and the pmer worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem thank you and a small bit of the stem uh um now we are told that all these insects uh are all one and the same in different stages they are the Antichrist spirit manifested and listen to what brother Brom said in organization denomination and false Doctrine through the the ages so listen to what the brother Bram is saying these four insects are the all the same in different stages it's the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization now listen he's not talking about in the world he's talking about in the church manifested manifest in organization organ denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor little root and St is going to be restored but BR said God isn't going to plant a new church but is going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed doing it by the teaching of former rain next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing fate amen next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing can the church say Amen now there are only two influences they are not three influences they are not five influences there are only two Inu there's God there's the devil there's the Holy Ghost and there's the Antichrist Spirit can the church say Amen so when you walk and you wake up every day to know what's influencing you because what is influencing you will manifest itself a certain way so if whatever you're doing is leading to false Doctrine holding ons no forgiveness jealousy Envy that's the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost has a certain Behavior and the Holy Ghost in one person operates the same way another person the Holy Ghost cannot fight itself the Holy Ghost doesn't cause confusion the Holy Ghost does not break up families the Holy Ghost [Applause] doesn't can the church say amen amen only two influences in the message taken sides with Jesus M brother Bram say said that this message would fall into the hands of the predestinated so you didn't find this message this message found you you didn't walk into this church tonight you were called into this church tonight because Jesus said all that the father has given me they must come so if you belong to him tonight you didn't have a choice I don't care what you were doing last week what you were doing last month something on the inside just kept pulling you just pulling you what was that it's the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will never lead you to do the wrong thing you may be seated can the church say Amen am everybody feeling fine just let me kneel down a few things and I'll be out of here but the brandom said four enemy agents attack the tree the P but theam said the Palmer attacks the fruit brother Bram said the first thing the first fruit he took off uh was brotherly love that's the first thing that's the one thing butam said that kills the church right there in the message the restoration of the Bride tree butam said here now the first he got to eating on the fruit of the tree and Bram said let's picture a big tree of God's tree it's bearing nine spiritual gifts they're Healing The Sick they're speaking in tongues they're casting out Devils they're doing great works and preaching the unadulterated word of God no denomination to tie them down they are free doing a great work butam said so in come this little old devil setting up with his two [Music] horns out in front like a grasshopper and with his little old greedy teeth that's the Palmer wor he come to eat off the brotherly love then brother Bram goes on he says he wanted to eat the fruit of Faith then he eat the fruit of the joy of Salvation brother Bram said that's when they say sh you making too much noise is the Palmer that has churches dead in the message the Palmer worm has the churches dead in the message because there's no joy there's no fruit can the church say Amen so the Palmer wor eats out the fruit then brother Bram said the Locust he eats out the leaves and the leaves represent Fellowship but Bram said that the Locust breaks up the fellow ship among the church you can't you can't talk to this one you can't talk to that one you can't greet this one you're not supposed to talk to this one if you want to know who is responsible for breaking up the fellowship the Locust form of the Antichrist Spirit who tells you that you can't shake a Brother's hand that's a locust and you could tell them I said so but I didn't say it but the Bram said it can the church say Amen the Locust loc destroys the fellowship breaks up Fellowship breaks up the communion can the church say Amen brother Bram said when there's Fellowship he said the leaves they make it cool make it comfortable nice atmosphere he say it makes somebody who is Simple anybody it doesn't matter where you come from the spirit is so beautiful you shake anybody's hand they don't have to agree with you but the atmosphere is just right you can shake anybody's hand because there's Fellowship can the church say Amen but I'm saying tonight God is going to restore all that the Palmer eat all that the Locust eat God is going to restore the God is going to restore the fellowship you may be [Music] seated he may be seated then the next one is the cankerworm and the cankerworm attacks the covering of the tree or the bark of the tree and when the covering is removed it results in dogmas and Creeds and organization wrong teaching so if you want to understand where the wrong teaching come from that's a cankerworm spirit canor form of the Antichrist Spirit and the church say amen and the last one is the caterpillar but also said woman take away the baptism of the Holy Ghost because brother Bram said as long as you're going to have the Holy Ghost it's going to shed light on that wood so the devil had to attack the Holy Ghost because the church with the Holy Ghost always shine light on the word could find the promises could always find the seed can the church say amen and the last one is the caterpillar it attacks the life it takes the life out the church the church say Amen brother and why I am a Holy Roller he said I could imagine that Jo took a binoculars and he looked into the future and he looked and seen every insect eating down the tree but he preached out I will restore say the Lord Jo he saw the church at Jerusalem he saw the Holy Ghost pour out he seen the Dark Ages he seen the tree come down to a stump he seen a tree come down but he prophesied I will restore butam said you might be able to kill the branches but the life is still there can the church say amen and brother Bram said in Mary's belief that he promised in the last days that the church would grow so close from the days of Luther to the days of Wesley to the day of Pentecost right into the headstone and we'll be getting closer to unite with the headstone so tonight if the stump had a voice that voice would speak tonight and say I don't have my branches yet but I will restore say of the Lord I don't have my leaves yet but I will restore say the Lord I don't have my yet but I will restore is there anybody feels that way tonight the church [Applause] amen hallelujah and this is where I got my title tonight from the message of spoken word is your Original Seed brother Bram said these last days true church Bride Comes To The Headstone will be the Super Church a super race as they near the great headstone they will be much so much like him they will be in his very image in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations could never produce this went on then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride and I believe tonight the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word to know what he once done with the word can the church say amen amen so God has waited a long time for a super Church why a super Church would have to do what no other people could do all through the Bible every Prophet every judge the alpha Church even when brother Bram was here the devil was Waging War the devil was fighting a battle and the battle has been going on and on and on and on but God has reached a spot where is no be no more war the war is going to come to an end and a mighty conqueror it's going to be veil in the people can the church say amen God has waited a long time to finish the devil once and for all this time there will be no recovery for the devil this time the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more this time the darkness you see today you see no more can the church say Amen this super church will pull back the backsliders this super Church you cannot stay sick in a super Church you cannot stay dead in a super Church in a super Church Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you may be seated what are you saying brother Isaac this is the kind of church that God is coming for not a powerless Church a church without power God is coming for a church with power God is coming for a church signs with wonders with Miracles God is coming for a church where someone could walk into the door and they don't know Jesus and they feel the power in the church God is coming for a church that's another Ephesians that's a super Church another book of Acts a super Church wait till them seven Thunders after their voices that group that group will be the Super church the church say Amen Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory you may be seated tonight so all that we have seen over all these years have just been signs and indications to us when brother PR said sister hat you right I give you your two boys remember the said little fish I give you back your life all these were signs of what was manifested in a temporary way coming a season where it will no longer be temporary it will be permanent because the church is getting ready for a short quick message shake the whole nation this country is going to shake France is going to shake Germany is going to shake Africa is going to shake America is going to shake a super Church a super Church coming into Power you may be seated when it looked when it looked like Samson was knocked out when it looked as if Samson had no strength you may be seated what the devil didn't realize that Samson's here have been growing back all along but I want you to understand something the power was not in Samson's here what Samson's here represented Nazarite vow and the Nazarite vow was a vow to stay with the word because the Nazarite vow was a vow to maintain a certain practice or discipline we have a certain practice and we have a certain discipline Samson because he flirted with the world Samson lost his discipline instead of staying with the word Samson began to mix up the quotes he to mix up the teaching Samson lost his eyes he couldn't see with the natural eyes anymore he was forced to look with spiritual eyes all of a sudden the courts began to line back up because he couldn't look at the world no more he couldn't look at the Styles anymore he couldn't look at the Fashions anymore he couldn't look at what this preacher was preaching was locked up in prison he didn't know what was going on on the outside knew is what he heard a long time ago before he messed up before he made mistakes all Samson could have remembered was the old time religion Samson could have remembered old time Holy Ghost could remember old time Revival so while Samson was in prison the devil thought being in prison was going to stop the power whenever a man connects with the word the devil cannot stop the power because the spirit will always follow the word you may be seated while Samson was in prison here begin to grow back out while Samson was in prison he began to take back the shape the condition that he was in in his original condition you may be seated for a minute you don't hear me tonight you may be seated I want to make it real simple Samson at the beginning of his ministry brother brandom said Samson didn't have big muscles because God likes to be glorified when the odds are against you when the odds are against you so God likes to take a nobody and use his power make that nobody into somebody all samon had to do was obey the word don't cut your ha amen don't cut your ha all Samson had to do was stay with the word all Samson had to do was say what the tapes say all Samson had to do was stay with the [Applause] word you may seated for one Samson wasn't supposed to have his own interpretation was not supposed to have his own own idea how does a man who God used so mightily God used so powerfully reached the point where he could go against God's covenant and cut his ha if you took a picture of Samson at the beginning of his ministry he had his long here if you took a picture of Samson when he was messing with the world when he was with the world with his picture was a different picture he had a different Facebook profile he changed it to one mature he didn't look the same he didn't worship the same he didn't feel the same he end up in prison but while he was in prison he started to look like his original profile picture and the devil didn't understand that when you look like how you're supposed to look God is going to do something about it can the church say Amen so there is [Applause] Samson you may be seated he lost his eyesight he can't see the world no more he doesn't see the worldly music he doesn't see the worldly Temptation he doesn't see what the young people are wearing he doesn't see what the young people are doing he's not worried about what another church is doing he is just focused take me to the pillars take me to the spot I don't want to be just anywhere but take me to the spot and what the devil didn't realize butam said everything was there and all he needed to do was pray once more Lord and Samson said he saw the possibility that he could have the same power that he had before and tonight I see the possibility that the Church of the Living God could have the power cend day of Pentecost tonight I see the possibility that the cripples could walk tonight I see the possibilities that the blind eyes could be open tonight I see the possibility that the backsliders could be restored tonight I see the possibility that you could receive the Holy Ghost tonight I see the possibility that you could have the prophecy of God manifest hallelujah hallelujah somebody say amen I believe tonight I believe tonight the same God the same God the same God the same God who wrote the word is more than able bring it to pass you may be seated God could not have a super Church in Paul Martin arus in those ages because the word had been lost so God had to send a prophet to make sure that the right people were in the right place at the right time words no matter how bad the situation was Samson could could not go to see the Philistines until God allowed his hair to grow out the church so for all these years what we've been waiting for is for the hair to grow up but I look at you tonight and I see all things are ready Lord Let the Fire Fall all things are ready you are in your place the pope is in his place the governments are in their place the VIP lounge is in its place the devil is right where he's supposed to be let's tear the devil's Kingdom down tonight can the church say Amen s is this the time for that great outpouring is this the time for the Dynamics to connect with the mechanics had the mechanics but he needed Dynamics we have mechanics we have all the work every mystery has been revealed every promise is Over You Lord let the fire can the church say amen amen hallelujah hallelujah oh I'm getting ready to close [Applause] out musicians can get ready you may be seated for a few minutes hallelujah hallelujah in the message of revelation of Jesus Christ brother Bram said let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church listen carefully he knows that Satan he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever now I want you to catch something friends the devil knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday he's the same today and he's the same forever so the devil is nervous and we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the same today and the same forever and we are excited because if God did something a certain way the first time he has to do it the same way the second time because God does not change if you meet the requirements for what your need is God has to meet your need Church Say [Applause] Amen you may be seated he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and he changes not brother Bram said he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians um he knows that since God is immutable in his nature that he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God St Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false in other words the true church the super Church would have seen Mark 16 in action in the true church in the super Church the sick cannot stay sick in the true church you will see miracles you will see signs you will see wonders listen carefully brother Brandon was so troubled that he blasted the preachers spoke against the preachers who did not preach about signs and wonders and miracles and brother Bram was troubled because prostitutes people who were not even Christians would walk in into his meetings and they would be healed and people who sat in the church were not healed and brother brought out that healing that being healed healing is not a merit of your salvation healing is a merit of your Fai if you have faith tonight you could be healed tonight you f God can restore you tonight I don't care what condition you came in here tonight you may be seated I don't care if this is the first time you are in church in 5 years if you have faith that this word is real and Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday the same today the same forever God could give you a new heart God can heal you tonight of whatever sickness disase I don't care what it is you may be [Applause] seated listen friends I will close with this I believe that when God took brother Bram home Jesus never left I believe when God took his Prophet home Angel never left I believe that when that great Elijah went home the one with the swep back Wings he never left I believe that when our Elijah left that the spirit of Elijah rest upon Elisha and I believe tonight that the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel and he is here tonight to give you whatever you need he is here tonight to heal the sick to raise the dead you the Holy Ghost Church there will be there will be there must be a restoration of the super Church once more Lord tonight I ask a question where is the Lord God of el where is the Lord God of elij
