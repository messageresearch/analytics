Alana was said to me she wanted to apologize that behind me for permitting and that she was worried she was making too much noise and disturbing me I told her to be honest I don't remember I didn't hear thing as I was in my own prayer closet I said don't worry you go right ahead well words can't express what happened at yesterday's Friday night prayer meeting I know I feel a little sewer all I could see is that something got ahold of me I entered my prayer closet again and said it's just you and me Lord I wanted to go a little higher out of this natural realm and it's like I was locked in and just poured out my soul so much so that at the start of the service I was on the left end of the Pew or if I don't know how or when I move somewhere in between I heard you say greet somebody I'll open my eyes I was on the right of the Pew and I tried to grease it so Williams and we broke apart I was a bit dazed close still talking to God I felt myself like I was being sued I'm wrong and I wrong never felt like that anything like that I remember thinking what happened and the thought that I couldn't pull up anymore took a while to catch myself and by the time I was downstairs while in the washer once it's a blended greeted me I felt myself drifting as I was drunk on new wine I felt I was drunk couldn't walk in a straight line for anything and what an experience whoa if that permiten wasn't the power of God working in a church I don't know what is amen I know it's a push but I'm looking forward to another permitting we will continue to pray until something happened as in our own Upper Room experience Azusa Street revival I believe it already started or crazily the Lord there's no wonderful glory hallelujah amen and and we have a testimony from sister Alana Utley she say but first I wanted to say thank you very much for everything that was said and done to make last night permitting the success of words I like to share you to you my experience although I know words would only explain so much but still I try my best at the beginning of but of the permian I find myself just repeating words I would start praying and before long I'd hear myself saying the same thing again and I decided to try a different approach I visualized God as being next to me I began telling him how happy I was just to be here knowing he said where the truths and trees I got it in his name there he is I told him how excited I was this whole week waiting for this night I know it's like word just been repeated I told him I can't go back home the same way I came with all my feelings and weaknesses I don't want to leave this permitted after traveling all these miles to go back home and say well it was nice being here I need more than that I need a change I needed livers the more I talk to God exposing my failures and weaknesses the more I wanted to let him know I remember repenting and praising and thanking him I was repentant because I know I'm not good I was worshipping because of who he is and then I began to thank him for all that he has done and was about to do and I started doing this I can't remember when I had stopped repeating the same words but I had reached the point where I had no control over my repentance or my worshipping there was an atmosphere of being so broken and at the same time being made whole I was so totally caught up in the atmosphere to me right here is where I wanted to stay I cannot help but repeat myself again I had absolutely no control over what was happening but over the best I can describe this experience was we've every wrong got higher and higher every time I repent and praise there was something taking place within me I just wish I had words to fully explain this entire experience and we want to sing that song again waves of glory I mean ways of his glory fill your soul this morning let's horse town you wanna sing it again amen freeze alone [Music] [Music] hallelujah somebody Jesus name [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we want to go into the word wanna go in the scriptures Joshua chapter 5 justice chapter 5 we didn't verse 1 to 12 Sam's 42 we didn't verse 1 2 3 and Matthew five one verse we want to read verse six just up to five and I came to pass when all the kings of the amorite switch won the sight of John and Westwood and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the see here that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the chin of Israel until we were passed over that they had melted it neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the cheerin of Israel and at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives uncircumcised again the cheerin of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcise the chin of Israel and the heel of the foreskin and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people are came out of Egypt that were meals even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out was circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt they had not circumcised for the chin of Israel walk forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came Elizabeth consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the land which the Lord swear their fathers that he would give them a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he had raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they was uncircumcised because they have not succumb sized them by the way and it came to pass when they had uncircumcised in all the people in their board in their places in the camp till they were made whole and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I roll away the report of Egypt from off of you wherefore the name of this place is called giggle under this theme and the chin of Israel and camped and giggle and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month and even in the plains of Jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the self-same day and the manna ceased on the morrow after they are eaten of the old corn the land Nina had the cherry Israel manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Kenan that here Sam's 42 I want to read from who's one two three as the heart panted after the water Brooks so parted my soul after the O God my soul too stood for God for the Living God when shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day a night while they continually say unto me where is thy God a last scripture taken from Matthew chapter 5 verse 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled the rest bore heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your divine love and presence and repent now you come Lord and create the atmosphere that your would could go forth in power granted father pour your spirit upon your people this morning bless the hearers of the word and bless take me out of the way and speak lip the air to your people in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen prison you may be seated or praise the Lord it's good to be in his presence this morning good to see you making the effort to come out and come on early to pick up the service and once you make that sacrifice go gonna bless you for the sacrifice yes god bless his sacrifice amen just to come here to get something from the Lord see what is your expectation this morning to get what you expect this more of a title blessed the day that hunger and thirst after righteousness blessed the day that hunger thirst after righteousness and I've an inspiration to stand for God to stand for God hallelujah praise God and but a Branham I had used this message and he read this you a descriptor rather and preached a measure called taste Brisco okay he said I think David and writing in the somme must have been in distress and it usually take distress to bring the best out of a man you see when things going smooth and easy gotta watch it just how to watch it usually take distress to bring out what's in a man and it's usually when God gets down to when we fast many a times to get ourselves in a position outside of the way and I think when David got in those places he began to meditate on the Lord and think about these things and many times God get us in tight corners where we have to look up sometimes we have to be on our back in the hospital or bed somewhere so we could look up to see where the great blessings of God comes from and that's why I say you have to have an attitude of gratitude and stop complaining because complaining the sweetened and hinder your feet hallelujah the man complaining you have no shoes he stopped complaining because so somebody with no feet have a attitude of gratitude how many happy to be here this morning how many creat feel that you lied this morning God give you strength in your body you have a hand to prison or glory to God you come here to get a word from the Lord hallelujah praise God amen no he said no I he's talking about testing for life and he said I was looking in a dictionary for the word test and Webster's say it's a painful desire it's painful when you want something so bad that it becomes painful to you it's not an unnatural thing to test it's a natural thing God put that in us and it's something God put in you to get the control different desires and this test is the control tower this control tower that sets in man hearts is something that God give him to warn him of the desires that is needful for him and that's why when somebody really thirsty and they're really tasty they will drink for anything because you're really thirsty and if your doctor is by putting things up on you that you don't have that hunger in until enough for for God so God David said my soul thirsts for God not for scriptures and quotes for God he identified for the Living God not an intellectual understanding for the Living God hallelujah and my enemies and people say where is your God what what is powerful and mighty declare that God manifests that God brought back down you know because he is able to keep his word he go back down on him no he is able to fulfill his word he is able to prove today that he's I am he's still open the blind eye Oh glory to God he still calls the Deaf to hear the dumb to speak the crippled to walk or glory to God he still could reverse your disease your condition could be reversed your your condition can be canceled the assignment the devil have on your life can be canceled I don't care what sickness and the body I don't care what family heritage I don't care if your mother had it your mother mother had it I don't know who had it in your generation that could be canceled this morning or chlorine evolved in a season and time but we could have a divine right and I've access to all our redemptive rights or get a lot some praises this morning you may be seated the proposed our message about deep call to the deep you can't have a deep and there's no deeply respond once there's a deep in your soul there has to be a deeply respond you can feel it I'm testing for juice and there's no juice no recently listing for juice and have to have juice on it if your person for God have to have aguado there if you're thirsting for miracles and say the oneness it has to have miracles saying them wonders oh there if you're testing for revival there has a very viable out there before you tell us where it had to be there before you test for it or give the Lord some praises what about a breakthrough what about deliverance what about a breakthrough before you twist a breakthrough the vibration for you before God made the fish he made water for the fish to swim in or get a lot of shout my hallelujah please God not some historical God he said Living God hallelujah and God put that to stop this run to come to the control tower and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking some are natural to stand a spiritual truth the control tower and the body and in the soul and the control tower and the body that tells you you need it for what for the body it's brought to you by a kiss and there is a contralto in your soul the past lunchtime is a let's say I feel hungry I don't feel hungry and one lie down I say if you're hungry you looking for food you want something to eat yeah I work to do but they say when I come back when I get I'm going as imma eat then I coming back because your body is saying hungry hungry hungry hungry must have food out there that's what he buddy callin for and if your soul said hungry hungry thirsty hungry a hungry non-system for God a hunger in and testify higher order a higher life 104 more power more blessing more the anointing praise God I'm hungry Oh glory to God hallelujah and if that is inside of you it has to have it Oh glory to God amen we believe that so the flesh test to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desire for the things that are in the soul and sometimes the desire many times these are war against one thought with the other we find that the true that's where the trouble is too many people try to live between those two those two desires for one of them desires the things of the earth and the other desires the things of heaven so you know warfare getting a battle but you have to fight this is not this is not picnic no this is a battle between the flesh and spirit hallelujah he that's in the flesh cannot please God or glory to go because God is a spirit so you have to get in the spirit to catch the mind of God in order to please God so you are wrestling with your flesh we know that because there's a law in your members there's a law in your system it's the law of sin and death but there's a law in your spirit the spirit of life that is the higher law and that higher local business flesh body in subjection or give the law some prisons people or glory to God hallelujah [Applause] somebody born in sin sheep iniquity do you have one kind of behavior sinful behavior you can expect the legislature purchases on a sinner you have to hunger thirst after righteousness you have born with righteousness Russia never come upon your life so you catch right your own righteousness like a precious as yours but you pay for righteousness you have the huntresses is his righteousness is not you do and don't know that you do and don't his righteousness is when something happened to you when you do that's you do if you stop smoking that's you what you do you stop drinking that's what you do but when you see he doesn't work in you that is his work that is his righteousness that is his power that you artista knows Oprah is gone if of your buyers I gotta turn with me to first Corinthians of the ten just read some verses you from Lewis Corinthians chapter 10 inscription I don't know how come to me to put this in but I just kind of tried to move by leaving the spirit to put it in and then when I went to food and study in it I saw brother Branham break into the scripture because you say we have a revival coming and a warning have to go out indirect line of this revival full screen chapter 10 greed in verse 1 and Paul execs 14 the Corinthians church and the Brethren and the Corinthians church moreover brethren I would not that he would be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea did all eat the same spiritual meat did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but was fine with many of them God was not well pleased for they will overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted needed neither be at lattice as was some of them as it were written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happened unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall they had no temptation taken you such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it may God bless his word and I trust this be edifying to you because these happen to these believers believers as examples upon whom the ends of the wool are come that we could learn from that that we could understand the same God that saved them from Egypt is the same God that judge them the same God that pull them out is the same God that destroy them so don't think God is a good God all the time those are like fries people I can see understand this sport in support of the world so we have to line up with his requirement or we will be judged doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter what you do you think you are it doesn't matter what dress you have it doesn't matter what time have it is god hallelujah in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God the word is still got today so this is a brother branham this message this morning and this was corinthians book of correction is preaching this message this morning as it come to my heart in hee there is a message of warning and i thought maybe if we could get this warning to the people as paul warning these corinthians if we could get this warning to the people knowing we are facing a revival now and an examining time when we must be examined and he was given an understanding that when God brought Israel out of the wilderness into this to serve Him take to take them to the promised land he is setting an example that we are brought out all our material things and the rituals and orders were the same we found a little further that they were overthrown because here we go because they could do these rituals and all the orders and everything that God require and still the hearts wasn't right with God so it's not coming to church it's not saying you believe it's getting your heart right with God it's not much mystery tional and how much revelations you claim is getting your heart right with God now we can do many things we can take communion we can be baptized we can come to church we can have our names on the book they just has respect on me Reverend as we can and still be lost I want to read it again I want to read that again because you see this is the wit now this is not just trying to impress you in not coming really impressive you know we're not here to say things that you want to hear you know we have to speak what you need to know we have to speak what gall want to speak Weber when I find you're saying things like a trained words no no no no you in the human Instagram we don't yet the trouble is you know this is the word cut by a man on that this is the word hallelujah and always have to cut your feelings or from it politicians that have feelings and emotions and they want to get they do the people and this and that and that Gordon's a politician you know he told Adam and Eve the day you eat thereof that day you die he's not a politician he's a Kauravas well if you keep his word he gonna bless you if your breakfast will you repay the penalty or breaking this word could be I am and Church this is another club you join this is God you serve or give the Lord some princes hallelujah hallelujah remember when Moses met the pillar of fire Moses asked God who shall I say send me because I'm people are easy I can't this I just tell them God

a meeting where the world was being preached on your soul would just rejoice with the world and still be lost the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same rain that makes the wheat grow makes the weed grow it's the nature of the product it's the nature of it that tells what we are therefore it's the nature that's in us that tell us what we are oh my so when ELISA came and he came and he

so the same pay that Peter had Paul had that's why I wanted to be I wanna short me I want to sit on a no church band and say I'm a Christian no science no one does not miracles no life no nothing believe in some book dice Peter Peter couldn't writing him I'm Peter was man of God servant of God son of God I was sitting on his age and because I could read through three books because we have reading writing and arithmetic be so educated with no power that can work you know same pay same power hallelujah people drop down dead raise them from the dead the blind come inside I add you have to see the capital coming here they have to walk not not not not not if maybe perhaps no he is walking she is seeing you are being delivered don't you want that [Applause] let's go quickly now Wow so the holy spirit will fall but by their fruits they are known because some Samedi spirits and demon allergy need the atmosphere of the holy spirit they live under that false period that's why all Israel is on Israel all the people in the Christians are not Christians see so Christian is Christian and heart and spirit and mind it's Christian and life not Christian become the church but Christian because you have that Christianity in your heart hallelujah so he said I understood there it is the Holy Spirit will form but by their fruits they are known see at the Lord Jesus not by the reaction of the spirit whether heal the sick or whether they speak in tongues or whether they sang in the spirit whether it rejoice this way that way they can do all of that and instead be lost it's your life within you are born again experience and Paul was trying to get that to the Corinthians Christianity's I go over to the church I know it's my duty to go that's not Christianity I want him stink-eye back sitting a mystery for services or coming today so I do know they still think I say all wrong I know Christianity Christianity it is something that God has done I will see it again Christianity is something that God has done so you could be a crook you could be a thief you could be whatever and God come and do something for you [Applause] is not what you are is what one has done come on now do you get that we focus so much on what we have done but what God has done has fought done it for you if he hasn't done it he will do it deliver you for you forgive you restore you rescue you liberate you open the prison bars for you if you could do it you don't need God if you could save yourself you need a savior when you recognize that you are no good you are nothing you need him and he loves you you care about you or glory the glory coming down this morning the envy men to come into your life all right so it's something that God has done God has chose you in Christ and presented you as a love gift to Christ it is God's calling an election hallelujah praise God so watch the the all were baptized into the sea they all drank of the same rock and so on what they all came in and baptized and the Christ took on Christ outwardly he said professionally I take them on intellectually had accepted him they come back receiving a message outwardly informally not inwardly and willingly they come like if you receive me outwardly and formally as your pasta and not inwardly and willingly for me to tell you what you need to know so you're running your own show and you're not getting guidance and instruction you're doing your own thing then you are on your own Road because the foolish virgins listen is part of the same court that the Y's version was cut off from the same court virgin is declawed but when God put the pattern hallelujah he cut only wives piece the rice pieces were of extra oils so if you don't want to subject yourself to the word and the order of the church then you know what you are that's judge member behavior those foolish version behavior because what I put a ministry here for not let me say that they ain't gonna put a ministry here for not yes for a purpose even sure the faithful ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints the work of the ministry the every sign of the body till we all come in the unity of the faith and not a son of God so those people that came out of Egypt they know God they can so okay so watch watch Moses up the mountain they find Moses in too long they see Aaron Aaron Micah's our God didn't who God is an errand smokin on the place making God when your jewelry he make a calf a golden calf I mean people said this is our God they are no internet the Dan Salinas the Karen over the nonsense when God fills Moses he said here I hear Evelyn down they couldn't unsee when people do nominate people dance in the patting the drinkin they have got that God they have don't see you know that God has have got judge you know that is the god of their mind that's not equality well you know that's the core of their creation they'll make that golden calf I can tell commas when Moses who only Lord side here and drop IP smoke and everything else here on chopped everything around the Moses Oh Aaron no he and foolishness even know he won't do any wrong thing but when push come to shove Iran shavon corneas arena you can catch any run in that with them unbelieving people there they asked him to make it he make us for them but here I'm no better than that you know better than that you know better than them or get the lord of gives a lot of shelter knows [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's a lot more than intellectual as Boram says it goes beyond that it's a genuine bit not a mental conception or emotional workup but a built an experience something that goes plumb down deep into the heart and changes the innermost bein that makes you do things that you would not have done in other words it makes you makes you that change makes you love those who are unlovable so if you want to test the Christianity test it with people who give in your trouble testing love to momenta when you see them see if you love them or you want to give them bad ion cation whatever whatever else so you see this thing is real now it have a real clinical test general when you go to the dr. pol Oh ah my grandchildren I put it to medium or temperature no the body not lying you know the body I hide our plane low-temperature know that dr.mohammed lying if you have a fever fever remember that kind of life it builds the tested temperature well this think a lie even a dog knows eleven a dog called me dog so you don't wanna meet you you shall love your dog I'm just stamping he talked watching you saw that I love you he want to run me yes you hear what I'm saying so listen love is powerful your enemy must know they can feel it you know they will feel shame of the behavior because you are expressing love they want to curse you but you blessing them for their curse you give them a blessed if you could win them kiss curse fall back on you just fall back on them but when you bless when they trace the blessing will fall back on you and because before that on them so Jesus I bless those that bless you come on get the Lord hallelujah Jesus bless them that curse you you stare right you're living right you're acting right you're speaking right you must come out right you're thinking right you have to come out right oh boy I write it for you [Applause] it makes you love those who unlovable it makes you act different than you ever thought you would act and when situation arise it's your uncle you don't have to wonder will I make it no it's whether I'll make it it's already made for me Christ in me has made it himself and I just trust in his Anka oh praise the name of the Lord do you get it he said no or look at this solemn warning and Tabernacle folks get that wrong we don't deep remember it's your eternal destination hangs right there don't pass it by like a little flutter this is something we have to come to respective of it some that means what I believe hereafter or not they were all baptized analogous to the Red Sea they all follow the same spirit being the cloud a pillar of fact they were all led by the same angel they all come on by the same posture he's seeing it he said they all had a presidency they all each spiritual manner the MANOWAR's christ christ coming on the manna every night from heaven and perished yet to sustain the people journey but christ come from heaven and give his life he whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and Christ come down and became all manner they eat the same spiritual blessing therefore the Holy Spirit can fall right in amongst the people on both Christian and lukewarm and half believers and borderline believers will eat the same but that doesn't mean that yet oh I wish I had words that I could drive this dong and cinch it in every hat every person to see what a deep thing it is it isn't something to be played with it isn't going to church he said listen he said I know this I felt the power go to me I did this that might be exactly the truth and still you are lost and then he went to the first Corinthians 13 though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I become a song than brass and a tinkling cymbal and do I have the gift of prophecy understand all mysteries know all knowledge and though I have all faith so I can move mountains and have not charity and I am nothing listen to that Stern all apostle drive it into this sensational Church who was based in the hopes of sensation Oh glory to God and do I bestow all my goods to feed the poor doing good works right and have not charity it profiteth me nothing see all your good works all your good deeds all this britannians you have all the gifts you have all the sensation you have all the joy you have all the peace you have has nothing to do with it to begin with think of that for a moment so it's not what you have and what you do is what God has done [Music] think of the churches today great churches Presbyterian methodist baptist and put their name on the book though I speak what the what I feed the poor I have a good hat about me he's a charity suffereth long charity envieth not charity vaunteth itself does not behave itself unseemly so the Holy Spirit cannot behave in one person and miss me even one person is one Lord one spirit one Holy Spirit if the Holy Spirit believe in this one it could be even that one too or do you believe that or praise God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I put my name on the book what then the things that you did that's the things that your faith produce but unless God has that something to you to a new bit that's is what it is a transformation in your life he is warning those Corinthians be careful what you're doing when I come among you one of us am one of a tongue one of this one of our prophecy what a revelation don't think of their place they caught their place in the church but don't never be so salvation on that if your life doesn't tally up to God's Word it's time to get right with God so what you want to see is a life glory to God hallelujah doesn't what they want to see you want to see their life hallelujah praise God you want to see your life not to see our angel you want their life not to see a rainbow you want to see a life God not coming down yet the pause for Instagram you want to see a life or get the Lord a shout you see I like you see a dish you see a table look at what you see what's living out of you Oh glory to God hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you lord could we go the money a little more with many of them God was not pleased his people my people who I come not to call out he not breathe they fornicate in the adultery but I'd live in idolatry his people live in contrary how could he be pleased you see he permitted them to be baptized he permitted them to either wouldn't believe it he permitted them to get rich i blessings he permitted them to drink from the spiritual rock all attacked by his Greece yet God was not pleased they were overthrown in the wilderness after all these experiences after all our great healing services we have seen after all the great miracles we have seen perform after all the great feeling we have had shouting and praising God seen from the rock all the good sermons we have enjoyed and yet to be over true this is not skim milk this morning this is real because we come into a revival and your mind have to change if the mind don't change you won't change you have to change the way you think about what is being done right inside of here it has to change you cannot working in the same way or glory of God judgment begins in the house of God or give the Lord some praise his people hallelujah these things happen for examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted oh praise the name of the Lord Alleluia and here is balm he said the Holy Ghost really falls in our church that's good what difference does it make to you if you are not at the right kind of vessel it is fallen air or glory to God so God want the right kind of vessel prepared for the spirit of the Living God or give the Lord some praises hallelujah [Applause] so he said do I speak with tongues and even known that I am nothing till love comes in which is Greece God has to do it see you can do all these signals that we lost it is Greece that seems you so therefore you don't have to make no style or nobody like if like if you because I want you to it's the grace I stand here by grace you are what you are I am what I am by the grace let me say it differently if the Lord that had been on my side where would I be if wasn't for His grace I would surely fall but for the grace of God or get a lot some praises people turn to somebody and tell them but for the grace of God [Applause] [Applause] His grace King Solomon the wise man said time and chance happen to all men a gravedigger work very hard but he's not getting the P as an engineer or doctor but he workin have you had big in Greece every day so your blessings is the Greece of God family going sent you choose the grace of God you your family could have been very very rich but not you're not in Genesis what sets it up that we did you could get the gospel that's the main thing here is not a likeness in a family you can rock back on that alone is just the grace of God to get this word to you where the balance said the word will fall in the hands of the predestinated so listen you could have been a a child of the neighbor next door but they are not saved God put you in our family that that that the pathway of that family going to bring you to salvation [Applause] [Music] so you can't complain your father give you this your mother gave you that they wasn't supposed to give it those things do what they give us an opportunity to receive Christ and when you have Christ you have everything you are possessor of all things [Applause] you have more than your mother honey you are more than your father heart your grandfather your great-grandfather you have more than them you are power to be changed in a moment in a Twitter when I there's gonna be a rupture that's gonna
