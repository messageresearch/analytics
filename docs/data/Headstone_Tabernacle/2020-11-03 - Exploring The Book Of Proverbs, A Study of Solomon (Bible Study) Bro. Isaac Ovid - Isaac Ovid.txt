day this day that lord that you have made and you have ordered and give us this great privilege to come together lord to sit and have a conversation around your word lord that you couldn't find a better way to leave your thoughts for us lord you put it in writing lord as the written word and you put it to lord and we could see the mountains and the stars and see all these things to see expressions of your thinking expressions of your thoughts and lord how you put it in such a way that we could actually step into your mind at any point in time lord and lord not like the rest of the world who may have exposure to the bible but because lord you choose to send a prophet to us we can go into the book and see what others cannot see father because this prophet was given the insight to shine light on the written word so that we could see the reveal word that was based on scripture so we thank you for your grace we thank you for your great mysteries that we lord have come to understand and to realize that this great prophet was to lord reveal every mystery and we thank you for lord every scripture every book every chapter every verse every line and we get comfort and courage in this so may you bless us tonight as we approach your scriptures may you take complete control lord of everyone that's in this room those that will join and lord perhaps somebody may even listen to this at some point may it all be a blessing and lord uh as we look at what's happening lord even beyond this meeting to see the the the global realm the the political realm the natural realm to see that even now uh the united states is going through their own period of of a time of decision lord to see the whole world is waiting on a decision lord of what would unfold and to see that all these are pieces of this great puzzle this great plan that you have designed and ordered a certain way to bring about a certain outcome so father we submit ourselves to your plan for tonight that the plan you have for us knowing that there's a certain outcome lord the bible speaks of an expected end lord away how things will turn out lord may each person tonight leave this meeting tonight with a resolution with a commitment with a desire to be better christians lord may we each leave with a desire to be different lord may lord our thinking be renewed you said that we ought to be transformed by the renewing of our minds so may our minds be reset tonight lord and lord even as the word and the conversation will go forth if there's anyone lord that desiring a touch and encouragement or law whatever it may be you are more than able to do it tonight so father we commit the service into your hands and we committed time into your hands in the precious thing of jesus christ amen and amen and amen well certainly a great privilege to be here tonight and um thanking god that uh through our different trials our different experiences our our ups our downs uh and every step of the way that god is in control we thank god for his control and uh i was saying to my wife abigail uh know yesterday the announce that um there were no new uh coronavirus cases in in trinidad and i know a few people were jubilant about that and then today they announced 50 new cases you know so um and and you see in people swinging back and forth and this this this experience of uncertainty and and and you know it's it's quite it's quite a time that the world is living in and uh of course on a on a big macro level um we have the election uh decisions and there are those who are pro this and prove that i am pro the lord tonight um the outcome of of this this vote is something no matter what the outcome is we have to deal with it um and it really i am i'm trying to operate above that level because i believe that i come from a different uh plane of existence i come from a different order you know i come from a different you know where i come from these systems operate very differently you know so you don't want to be trapped into these natural these natural things and and i see a lot of people get heated about these things and i really try to live above that you know so but i want to encourage you tonight uh to keep pressing the battle i want to encourage you uh to keep focused on the race the race that we are all in uh we are all in the race whether you're 15 years old or you're 95 years old you're still in the race you know and we know the race is not really swift but it's a race of endurance for those who could endure those who could stand the test of time so um you would have heard me say oftentimes that our bible study is really a conversation uh look into scripture to inspire to encourage um maybe it'll be something you heard before maybe it'll be something you heard for the first time maybe uh you see another perspective of it and your understanding opens up in such a way that it gets you to a reset and to to to take courage to be able to step out you know um so tonight uh i think it was three weeks ago i did uh uh study on introducing solomon it was a study of solomon part one and i know um during the last few months i've had a lot of part ones um i never really got into part two of of things because i i try to wait until i get a nudge with how to go but i do want to continue um along the vein of solomon so tonight it'll be a study of solomon part two exploring the book of proverbs uh that's that's that's the study tonight a study of solomon part 2 exploring the book of proverbs because there is no way we could get into the whole book tonight there's a lot of wisdom in there and just to put things in context a study of solomon uh exploring the book of proverbs is specific because solomon is credited um with with writing three books um he wrote proverbs he wrote ecclesiastes and where we find there's a time and a season he also wrote the song of solomon we know proverbs to be the book of wisdom ecclesiastes is called by theologians the book of folly uh and song of solomon the book of love and when you look at proverbs a lot of people look at the proverbs as a very disjointed uh disconnected just a lot of different points but it's more than points because as you go above the book and you go in and you come back out you start to see certain patterns in the book and you would begin to realize that there's a certain thread that repeats and you will realize that as you go through the book of proverbs really the bulk of the book of verbs really speak about three people you know it doesn't call them by name but it's still three people that the book focuses on and it focuses also on three mean i want to use the word qualities you know um and the three qualities or characteristics or or or key messaging of proverbs is about wisdom understanding and knowledge there are three things here wisdom understanding and knowledge and the three main characters in the book of proverbs although they are not named we know them we know them in others and at times we know them in ourselves one is called the wise one is called the simple and one is called the fool you would see multiple references as in addressing the wise this character called wise you'll see a lot of references of speaking about the simple and you'll see a lot of references about the fool and this might sound very simple to start but it but it it builds and i want us to really take heed because many times in life we i'll put it like this most of the problems we end up in life is because we have failed to probably to properly understand the role and application of knowledge understanding and wisdom and we also don't really pay enough attention to understand when we are being a fool where we are being simple and our failure at times to be wise i'm sure if you reflect on your decisions in life and with the way you did things and the way you approach situations and the way you approach conversations and every time you find that the you know i could have done it a better way it is you come into an appreciation and a recognition that there is a better way and that in that particular situation at that particular point in time you may have either lacked your knowledge you may have lacked the understanding or me you may have lacked your wisdom and the more you spend time on these things as a believer it is about your maturity so as a father you could lack all of the knowledge as a father you could lack the understanding of being a father you can lack the wisdom of being a father you could lack the knowledge of being a mother you could lack the understanding of being a mother you can lack the wisdom of being a mother and i could run that through every single situation you go into the workplace there are some people who you know have the knowledge of the working of but they are not wise with how they operate within the work you see so let me give you an example and we'll get the description a bit but we're having a conversation tonight take a doctor for example you talk about a doctor with good bedside manner and good bedside manner is not something that is really taught because a doctor by training is taught to clinically analyze a particular situation and be able to provide a diagnosis but there are some who are better than others at being able to present the situation to you so they say the way that doctor relates to you is called his bedside manner the way he says things to you you know and i can just relate my own personal experience today to today i was sharing with my wife a meeting that i was in and i was brought in as a consultant to analyze a certain situation and the person who was working on the project before we were invited in was in a meeting as well now in that situation um when the person who was on the project before is also there you have to be very careful with how you deal with it you could have the knowledge of what to fix but if you walk in there and say well you have to fix this fix this fix is that wrong that wrong not wrong you will totally destroy the person who in the room who has been caring for this project all along you see so as believers and the applications here that we see in the book of proverbs is about us maturing as christians it's about us operating a certain way and i want to just read this reference here so when we speak about the wise the fool and the simple and i and i and i said it we know people who we could consider wise and it could be situational wisdom so there are people you may go to because they're wise about a certain thing they're things that that i'm not aware of if i want to go and hunt i want to find somebody who wise who has wisdom about hunting because i don't know enough i like the knowledge of hunting i like it i like the understanding of hunting and i certainly don't have the wisdom because wisdom is about application wisdom is is about skillful use of something all right so again i want to make the point that this applies in a natural it applies in business it applies in your education it applies in your marriage it applies in your conversation and yes god is interested in it and we will see through his scripture how much interest he has in you having knowledge so in other words i'm challenging you tonight to stop saying i don't know i'm pushing you tonight to say i don't you can't keep saying i don't understand because we'll see this scripture makes it clear in all that getting get understanding anybody with me tonight the scripture is pushing us to get wisdom you can't forever say well because my father didn't show me or because i didn't go to school or because i didn't those become now non-issues and they really are crutches that you need to drop and if there's a gap to be closed we have to close the gap so this is tonight is like almost like a motivational bible study if i could use that too and quite honestly i've reached a point in my own maturity where under inspiration i'm not moved by people's interpretation of how we operate as a sovereign church so i am very big on us being the best we can be for the kingdom of god i see nowhere in scripture where we supposed to be living under our privileges i see nowhere in scripture that says we're supposed to be frustrated and depressed and we supposed to i can't find it in scripture i can't find scriptures that say this journey supposed to be licks all the time there are scriptures that speak to god taking us through experiences for an objective god is not chastising because he feeling chastise to quote but over and over that's it you know it's not like you want to chastise so he chastising it is all to an objective and the objective is our maturity so this teaching is about wisdom solomon as we would have taught three weeks ago was principle when it comes to wisdom and and and the bible said he who win it a soul is wise so it means that if you have the testimony of bringing somebody to the lord god is saying that is that is wisdom on display when you can bring someone into contact with the experience of the supernatural and an encounter with god and you're actually winning a soul and it should be a testimony for all of us to actually bring someone to the lord because that's that's a that is the great commission and if it is that is one of the reflections of being wise and i want to pass that exam i want to fulfill every scripture every promise every everything any word that applies to me i want to accomplish it and believe you me it's not always easy it's tough time is being snatched by the news and by the newspaper and by different commitments and by traffic and all these things and it is becoming increasingly difficult to be able to navigate this world as a christian but at the same time this is where wisdom comes in this is where knowledge comes in this is where understanding comes in because the more complex things become it is more that wisdom shines out anybody with me tonight it is under crisis that equalities of knowledge wisdom and understanding are even more valuable if there is no pressure you can operate anyhow you know all right so i'm just saying i'm getting the scripture but i just feel into kind of have a conversation tonight if that's okay with you so i i saw a conversation recently at the beginning of this pandemic that was looking at businesses and it was saying that because of the pandemic a lot of businesses spent more of their time focusing on their internal issues than what the competition was doing because of the pressure they were forced to address the internal issues that they were facing they were forced to look at cost they were forced to look at their business model they were forced to look at the economic situation they were forced to look at the the industry analysis and the speaker who was bringing this out was saying the pressure brought a focus of introspection that when things are casual you have more time to look at what other people doing but under pressure you actually find yourself asking the question am i operating at my full potential am i selling everything i should be selling am i spending too much money and i want us tonight as we go into this journey for as long as the lord will allow us to venture tonight to really take a uh internal reflection of our lives let us check our inventory let us check what is our stock levels on on our level of understanding and i want to go a little deeper tonight so before we get into to say we don't know what we don't know i'll say it again you do not know what you do not know and and to bring an example uh i'm sure you have been in a situation where you heard something for the first time whenever you hear something for the first time you now come to a realization you know i never knew that but before that person pointed that out to you you didn't know he didn't know it you know it is only after you find out the thing you didn't know is when you realize you didn't know and that's a scary place to be so you find yourself as a parent there are things you don't know and it's not just that you don't know sometimes you didn't know that you didn't know it's one thing to say i don't know how to change the the i don't know how to fix the transmission on the car you i know personally i don't know the return mission but as i said next thing if i didn't know that there was something on the reach not knowing what you don't know is a big issue for us so let us get to the scripture tonight i don't know who that would help how it would encourage but just understand where i'm coming from tonight i believe in the practical application of the gospel i am not into super spiritual people who can live and navigate this world as a christian if god called us to live on a mountain and not talk to people that's one thing but that's not our reality the reality of our lives is we have to interact with family we have to interact with the public we have to interact with co-workers we have to interact with neighbors we have to interact with people who like us people who don't like us people who love us people who hate us and god has made it so wonderful that he has given us access to the tools to deal with every single situation as peter would say all things pertaining to life and godliness so all of that half past tense given to us so it's available to us and it's for us to put these things into use tonight so i want to start tonight uh because we would have introduced proverbs in our last teaching but i want to start from proverbs 1 and from verse 20 tonight and we'll just kind of take some aspects of it a bit slower than others and some uh we'll kind of kind of go a little faster tonight and i don't intend to take up too much of your time but i i want you to picture this young man named solomon you know and god using him as a voice to you tonight to encourage you all right so let's start with proverbs uh chapter 1 and verse 20. wisdom cry it without so the first thing we realize is that solomon personifies these things he doesn't speak about wisdom as a topic i want to be clear on this he doesn't introduce wisdom as an idea he speaks of wisdom as a person so we would say in in english or in descriptive that he personifies wisdom so he puts flesh on wisdom wisdom is this is this is this person almost that you could interact with so wisdom because it's the person can now have a voice so wisdom cries without and if you go to the amplified or the esv it will say this means wisdom cries with a loud voice or cries aloud in the street she utter it her voice in the street she cry it and the fact that it's crying and wants to pay attention is because wisdom as a person is trying to get people's attention in other words wisdom saying people not trying to be wise you know i want this to get this to get people attention people are living like robots people are not trying to get above their level so wisdom is trying to catch your attention trying to cut to say listen there is a better way there's a there's a perfect way because this is this is not man's wisdom we're talking about you know this is god's wisdom so wisdom is screaming trying to get your attention cries allowed in the street in the markets or we could say even in the business places she raises her voice all right verse 21 she cried in the chief place of concourse so that really means at the head of the noisy street she cries out in the openings of the gates that's like the in the entrance of the city she uttered her words so this is solomon painting wisdom in front of your house trying to get your attention wisdom on the highway trying to get your attention wisdom in city gate trying to get your attention wherever you go wisdom is saying to you there's a better way and listen to what he says look into what wisdom is saying how long ye simple ones will you love simplicity there are people who there are many scriptures that people misapply because they don't want to do work can i say that one more time there are many scriptures people apply because they don't want to do work so they take these scriptures that are convenient so there's a scripture that speaks about in and policy and all these things i was i'm content and they don't really hold context of paul's narrative and they say well i'm content so i want to study i want to work harder i don't want to do anything so they they they they take a piece of scripture to justify but but here is wisdom crying and saying how long these simple ones will he love simplicity in another translation it says how long or simple once will you love being simple now when i bring this from the scripture there are people who have criticized and say um i i want to live a simple life and brother is like trying to get people to become sophisticated i'm not speaking about becoming sophisticated no no i'm talking about there are three characters that are being described defined in the book of proverbs it is the wise it is the full and it is a simple you have to decide in your life in your marriage in your business and as a christian are you trying to be wise do you want to stay a fool or be a fool or do you want to be simple and let me just before continuing just kind of give a further definition so the wise if you read the description that is given of why is in the scriptural context is somebody who embraces god's covenant and learns the skill of living out the covenant in everyday situations to put it simply the wise character shows the skill in the art of godly living this is the person who continues to work hard at applying the grace of god the story of the gospel to everyday situations he is not yet perfect at it but over months and years he sees more and more how the promises of god apply to every square inch of his life that's that's the wise all right so even in my king james bible here the book of proverbs is introduced you know there's a little description before the book starts the key word in proverbs is wisdom the ability to live life skillfully a godly life in an ungodly world however is no simple assignment proverbs provides god's detailed instructions for his people to deal successfully with the practical affairs of everyday life how to relate to god parents children neighbors and government solomon the principal author uses a combination of poetry parables petey questions short stories and wise maxims to give in strikable memorable form the common sense and divine perspective necessary to handle life's issues and make no mistake about it there are issues of life that we all have to deal with they are decisions we have to make every day why not take counsel from the godly inspired wisest man who ever lived isn't that something people are trying to go to all kind of guru and self help people and all kind of thing and you have the wisdom that was only surpassed by jesus christ himself who was able to say are greater than solomon is here so we have access to the words of solomon and we have access to the words of the lord jesus christ who was the only one greater than solomon when it comes to wisdom anybody with me tonight what a place solomon solomon plays in scripture when jesus comparison of of greatness is is much against that of solomon so we are going through solomon's description for us because there has to come a time in your life when you realize simplicity cannot be the answer and you cannot keep doing foolishness it may sound cause it may sound rough but something we have to hear it that god expects more from us and he expects us to have knowledge and grow in knowledge he expects us to have understanding and he expects us to have wisdom there has to be a better way so let's go on we at verse 22 i reach anywhere yet how long his simple ones really love simplicity so he said simple people love simplicity you know and these corners delight in their scorning scorners exquall scuffers so you have people who coughing so for example you have people who going wrong painting this coronavirus is a fake they're painting on the wall they're laughing at virus some people say i wear no mask because this thing are real it's a conspiracy listen i have noticed confirmed no conspiracy by just defining what a scoffer is i'm just defining so you get a perspective of what solomon is referring to a scuffer or a scorner is somebody who seeing something happening and either don't believe it and mocking it scoring it's coughing laughing in it right scone is delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge so so we begin to see a formation of the character of full wise and simple because one of the attributes of a fool is hate and knowledge now i remember preaching about this a while back i say listen i am not making this thing up you have to look at the scripture and realize if you hate knowledge if you don't want anybody to talk to you if you're not trying to learn you have to know from this who is being described because by the time solomon finishes proverbs he has perfectly described the fool he has perfectly described your eyes and he is perfectly defined and described simple let's go on turn you at my reproof this is verse 23 all right behold i will pour out my spirit upon you so lucky brings his spirit in i will make known my words unto you turn you at my reproof means turn to my call meaning i'm trying to catch your attention so if you turn to my attention so wisdom this is wisdom speaking wisdom trying to catch your attention and wisdom sing if you want to be wise and if you respond to my call about wisdom i'm going to pour my spirit unto you and make known and make known is about knowledge making known so he will give or he will god will give you the knowledge of his words unto you and here's why here's why verse 24 because i have called and you refused you kind of wisdom now bringing it out here i have called and you have refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded so this is wisdom put it in a formal complete wisdom is saying i have called and he refused i have stretched my hand and no man regarded but he upset at not all my counsel in other words wisdom say i try to give you advice and your true my advice away and with none of my reproof would not let my reproof means you ignored what i'm saying i also so wisdom saying because you didn't respond to my hand to my gesture to my call to my advice i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction commit as a whirlwind when distress and anguish commit upon you listen then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall seek me early which is scripture but they shall not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord and the fear of the lord we know is the beginning of wisdom so i want us to understand now when you have to read these scriptures it makes you reassess how you spend your time it makes you weigh decisions differently because if wisdom according to the scripture is always there screaming saying there's a wise way but don't pass me don't pass man go and do your own thing in other words is a message about seeking wisdom and wisdom is trying to catch our attention i hope everybody seen that verse 30 they were with none of my counsel they despite all my reproof therefore and that's why i say there are consequences shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices in other words wisdom is saying if you ignore my advice if i try to get your attention if i try to to pull you from the wrong path that you go into then you have to live with your choices and this is why when you read the prophet's message and you read scripture there's so much to be said about getting good advice we tell people in marriage don't get into this thing unadvisedly we are saying to them get counsel check get advice make sure i'm praying talk to the pastor because listen because after you go on this road if you didn't talk to wisdom before you come up this road when wisdom was calling you when wisdom put on a hand to you you're making business decision and wisdom saying right now stop and talk to me before you continue now but you fly past wisdom and where some say but there he goes again there she goes again you come back and wisdom say hold on not i want to know but you pass under your own thing we talk about godly wisdom now we're talking about waiting on the lord we're talking about understanding that god's wisdom is available to us and he wants us to have it he's not trying to keep it from us you know i want to make it as clear as possible god not saying you have to do something no no he said wisdom is crying on the streets i want you to see a picture of it wisdom is not you hunting for wisdom wisdom is trying to come to you so when you make bad decisions is you actually ignoring wisdom can we push a little bit i don't know if anybody ever saw this like this before but i'm trying to put flesh on this thing flesh on wisdom flesh on understanding flesh and knowledge and for us to move from and and when you define it you have on one hand wise on the other hand is full and then simple is right in the middle let me just drop this true encouragement and clarity there so we talk about the why is already fool is the person steadily opposed to god's covenant he's the one who rejects forgiveness he is the one and we see he he ate knowledge the interesting one is the simple and i've found i can't put labels in anybody but this category of simple is is the category that we really comment against because i don't want to believe any fools are here tonight because fools hate knowledge fools wouldn't find themselves in a in a on a tuesday night when they have things to do fools ready no no no make the effort to to to be in a meeting like this that's not fools oppose god so i don't believe tonight i don't want to believe tonight that that there are foods in hiding and it's it doesn't they might already add up so so it is either we're speaking to the wise who who want to become wiser and those who are turning to wisdom or we're addressing the the simple and let me kind of put definition to these simple before we continue tonight the simple is described in proverbs as one not firmly committed to wisdom or foolishness lord help us today so the simple not committed to wisdom or foolishness or for anything that matters he is easily misled he easily falls into believing the majority opinion of the crowd he can be religious when surrounded by religious people he could be sinful when surrounded by sinners he can be lazy when surrounded by slackers he is not actively opposed to god but he really doesn't care that much either the simple is not as far gone as the fool but he tends to be the guy when in the presence of wise teaching remains unaffected it whistles right through his head now i am reading from a theologian who wrote hallelujah so i hope you're being blessed tonight i i i i i don't know when last year i had a conversation about wise the fools and the simple but i want us to to kind of understand that we're trying to go somewhere we are not mind you i'm not talking about education i'm not talking about a degree i'm not talking about mathematics i'm not talking about science i'm talking about godly knowledge godly wisdom and godly understanding with the recognition that god has a source of the knowledge that you need for every situation that you ever have to encounter he has what he has the knowledge and he wants to make it available to you the understanding to to understand how to speak to people to understand how to talk to your wife when when there are five ways to talk to her you know you might know what the problem is you're trying to address but do you have the understanding of of of how to say it do you have the wisdom to put it across in the in the right way so that when you're you're finished say it that that that that that your point actually went up in and your point didn't go down anybody with me tonight are trying to make this thing as tangible for us as possible because i'm dealing with the realities of life friends people come to church on sundays driving the car not talking to one another you know that is not doctrine that is a failure of knowledge wisdom and understanding people could be on the job co-workers you spend a significant amount of your time in your workplace you need wisdom you need understanding it makes no sense you live your life with that stress you need to get wisdom and understanding to reduce your stress you have to have wisdom to know what to even include on your list of things to even stress about and i could go deeper into why i shouldn't have a list at all but even if you have to think about something you have to have any wisdom to know what to put on that list anybody with me tonight i know this is not a bible story we into tonight this is not a character in the book of kings but this is we deal with the issues of life and emerging tomorrow with fresh perspective a fresh authority with understanding what god has for you what he called you for and most importantly called you to do all right so we have verse 31 the rate i'm going i will not reach my destination i have enough understanding to realize that at the rate that i'm going i will not reach my destination tonight so we at verse 31 this is the consequence of when wisdom screaming and crying you choose to ignore wisdom do you know there's somebody tonight we'll ignore words said tonight and there's someone in his room tonight will take this to heart and reflect on how they can become a better christian a better son a better daughter a better husband a better wife may that be you tonight my friend therefore verse 31 shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices for the turning away of the simple shall slay them i want you to catch that so the simple the turning away is is almost ignoring and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them the prosperity of fools is their destruction but who so hacking it unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil and i felt this is powerful because as a believer as a son as a christian you are supposed to sleep good at night you shouldn't have to worry about fear and evil you still have to worry about about this and that and have that stress because you have confidence in how you live confidence on the source of your strength confidence that if you haven't seen something yet it doesn't mean that the solution is not there it just means you need to go to god and say lord give me the wisdom give me the knowledge give me the understanding of how to resolve this situation how to approach this situation how to make the next step anybody with me tonight chapter 2 my son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments with me so that thou inclined an air unto wisdom this is what we're doing tonight we are inclining our ear to wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding when you hear somebody say their heart into it your heart into something is more than your mind being into it there are people who come to church and they head in into them but they have not in it you see the difference there you see the the distinction and and why solomon is placing things a certain way all right so that though incline the air unto wisdom you're listening for it and applied and heart understanding and many times through proverbs you'll see him begin to interchange because he's pressing the buttons to make sure you understand what he's pushing for yeah if thou criest after knowledge and lifted up thy voice for understanding you have to understand your role in god you have to understand your role as a christian you have to understand your role as a husband as a son as a daughter if you don't understand your role if you don't understand it you will end up into failure so if you don't understand he say listen listen lift up your voice for understanding if thou seek is her listen verse four are silver in other words you're out there trying to make money but you're not seeking knowledge you're not seeking understanding you're not seeking wisdom so he's giving you a comparison if you take the same effort you're trying to give towards making money if thou seeks her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures then thou then shall understand the fear of the lord and finding knowledge of god now can i dig all of it yeah people listen you don't need to wake them up to go to work or not you don't need to wake them up because they need that money they gain up but to get them to come to a prayer meeting you have to wind up you have to start to wind up days in advance because the tenacity and the drive and the enthusiasm for the prayer meeting or for the wisdom of god huh they don't have it but they say they want to go into the rapture or they want to make it or they and they don't understand what is really valuable and we'll dig into it god wants you to be blessed financially he wants you to be blessed and healthy whatever but there's an approach to god and if you are under the covenant of god there's only his approach is the approach because he said he fool his prosperity is his destruction so you have fools who will make money and that is their destruction but you are on that different covenant so you can't operate like the fool or the simple you need to operate with wisdom chapter 2 verse 5 then shall thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god for the lord listen give it wisdom so it's not something you need to buy he giveth the wisdom earlier on he say wisdom crying to get your attention now he's saying he given the wisdom so if you don't have it why you don't have it okay for the lord give it wisdom out of his mouth commit knowledge and understanding i'm praying that tonight that's why you heard something that that pushes you to a deeper level of understanding or knowledge or you're you're you're getting some wisdom out of this to even go back into these things and go back to the word go back to the prophet message sit down and analyze your life meditate on this word day and night and and and see listen tomorrow i want it better than today maybe i didn't operate at my best capacity today how can i be better tomorrow how much effort did i make in prayer did i did i get an art or a grudge that i that is that is how you live right amen let's continue verse seven chapter two verse seven he lay it up sound wisdom for the righteous so so solomon is now going into into god's role in this thing right he said from verse 5 then shallow understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god for the lord verse 6 give it wisdom out of his mouth commit knowledge and understanding he's pushing he lay it up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly can the church say amen he keeping the path of judgment and preserving the way of his sins then shall thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity ye every good path isn't this don't you want this to be your testimony don't you want to be a beneficiary of this when wisdom enter it into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul the sentence is not ending there discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee you see what keeping me truth this pandemic discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee to deliver listen verse 12 be from the way of the evil man the evil man has his way if you spend too much time watching the news and this and all these things happen and who are invasions and all these different things god is saying listen when you follow my statutes all of this stuff puts you in a position to keep you from these things to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh forward things anybody with me tonight who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness who rejoice to do evil this is what he's keeping you from and the light and the frowitness of the wicked whose ways are crooked and they frowned in their parts to deliver thee from the strange woman even the stranger which flutter it with her words which forsaken the guide of her youth and forgetted the covenant of her god for her house inclined it unto death and her parts unto the dead none that go unto her return again neither take their whole of the parts of life this is a whole message a whole sermon when you find out how people end up in the trouble what how much stop signs you run to end up in this position anybody with me tonight let us see your scripture you know none that go under her return again there are a one-way street okay down the street you can't come out be careful friends tonight get knowledge get understanding get wisdom understand the red lights whatever i'm saying god don't send anybody to hell on them he said you run all the red lights anybody remember that quote you say you run the red light god is screaming trying to stop you from doing foolishness that thou mayest walk in the way of good men verse 20 and keep the path of the righteous for the upright shall dwell in the land and perfect shall remain in it but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth and the transgression shall be rooted out of it let's keep going chapter three my son forget not my law sometimes we read that and we read it but how do people not forget things if you want to remember something so i want you to think if you have an exam what is your approach to remember something if you have something to do in work and you need to remember it if you have a password into your email and you need to remember it what do you do some people use a sticky note some people sit on and regurgitate it repeat it until they remember it and we'll have our notepads and we'll use our mobile device so people have found over time ways to try to remember or keep at hand things that are important to them so i want us to understand now that my son forget not my law means this must be so important to you that the law of god the word of god the things of god must be so easily accessible to you more than that it must be ingrained in you that it is not something that you could forget and if there is a command this is something that pushes us now to really kind of reassess because and i've shared it multiple times about things that i can remember from primary school that i drill and drill and drill till to this day i can't take it out my head i can't forget it no you can't remember everything in life but it's a focus here towards how much diligence attention and care you place to remembering the law of god and not forgetting his things all right my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments and it's not descendant is not complete there's a there's a call on there which means this is this is going on now there's a consequence of this for length of days so this is long life and long life lengthening and long life and peace shall they add to thee so automatically when you forget not the law and you keep his commandments you actually extending your life you know that's what the scripture is saying that is how god how much value he places on his word that's how much value he placed in his word you could extend you talk about you want the extension focus on his learner you want you want length of days and long life and not just that and peace because you don't want a long life and stress you know people living long and stressed out the grumpy grumpy grumpy he is saying that here you say length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee all right let's go on verse 3 left not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart mercy and truth mercy and truth so your value truth and you also value mercy because that's how god is how could he be a christian and you do have no mercy it might sound simple callous but god will test you on these things you know you are you are you are merciless christian really nobody can ever get a second time you are you are one chance christian you know much chance god gave you and and you have no mercy your wife burned the food and for days she hear about it no mercy is any simple things you know you have to realize friends every action you take could either escalate or de-escalate situations that's in your marriage in your business in your job every action every word every emotion and sometimes it's simple enough because sometimes we say a word but our body language saying something else you know you say ah sorry but you know that wasn't necessary that wasn't sorry and you're watching this and you see any smoke you see anybody language it's not lining up all right verse 4 social so shall thou find favor and good understanding in this in the sight of god and man so there's such a thing as finding favor and good understanding in sight of both god and man that's a powerful place in you know where because you keep the law of god a certain way you find favor with both god and man oh that's powerful verse five trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding so again i would have said earlier we're not talking about your knowledge your wisdom your understanding we're talking about us coming to an appreciation of god's understanding and god's knowledge and god's wisdom so he is now further clarifying and making it clear to you trust in the law with all that heart and lean not unto dying own understanding because you don't understand everything so you have to get his understanding on the matter you only understand so much right now but you look now at your life 20 years ago for those who could rewind that much 30 years ago for those who could remind remind that much 40 years ago for those who rewind that much what you understand now is very different to what you understood 40 years ago so the comparison that you can make with what you understood at 20 years old and at 60 years old imagine the gap between your understanding at six years old and causing understanding anybody with me tonight all right in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy parts i think i mentioned this and i referenced in the last teaching that everything is about the lord your success is because of the lord yes you study hard and you work hard and you put in the hours but if the lord didn't give you the strength to work hard and put in hours you wouldn't be able to do it so it's not your it's not ever your ability i want to make that point you say when i work hard and i study late at night so if god didn't allow it to to not be able to be up at night now what they want to study the things you wanted their credit for you can't take credit for nothing i want to make that point very clear there is nothing we could take credit for will i really study i have a degree i you know i push and i walk to work and i had no money to go and i real sacrifice and i didn't do whatever you're talking that whole sentence i can show you god and everyone i don't mind to go to school i walk to school what happened if you had no foot now are you going to work out well i went to school and i got done kind of where you get from if you load in a lot of canon cat you and they can find every single situation that you want to be credit for god is responsible so in all thy ways acknowledge him most of us do not put acknowledging god as part of our daily statement our daily life somebody message me just this week and say i'm so impressed with something i did i say all the glory to god i don't care if he's a christian a non-christian what they believe i i am telling you where my strength is coming from i tell you what bank i am withdrawing from if the bank up in the sky if you're blessing what i say it's not my ability this is not my knowledge i'm not speaking for my knowledge here i'm tapping into a source where this thing comes from i want to get in mind of the order of this thing because he could bring it out better than i could ever could anybody would be tonight in all thy ways not some not some of your ways we take credit for things we are not we did not do it i wanted to to get that point in all thy ways when lies did you acknowledge god in what you do you think you can cook no you can't cook acknowledge the lord everything i want us to bring it simple to us to understand these skills you have it's because of the lord give him the credit and watch him bless you with more come on now whatever skill that you think you have whatever ability whatever you do acknowledge him as his source and see him because he loves that he's a jealous god and the more you you left him higher the more you rise because that's how he is anybody with me tonight nailing it down in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy parts so he's saying in acknowledging me now i'm going to tell you what to do next because i like the fact that you're putting me in my place i like the fact that you're putting me first i like the fact that so i'm going to tell you make that move next make that move next and you keep saying is the lord is he lord is he lord i thank the lord if it wasn't for the lord who was at my side and as you live that way he said next step is here go here and your competition they don't know how you navigate in this world they don't know how you know where to be what to do how to go how to speak anybody with me tonight be not wise in their own eyes who is seven so he is now digging into this understanding issue let me say be not wise in your own eyes well that's a scary one the people who sit down and they come to the conclusion after they analyze the situation that they're actually wise when you mark your own papers and come to the conclusion that you wise you say well you know i made a really wise decision you see where you talk so and you mark your own papers solomon said that is not what i want to know be not wise in their own eyes fear the lord so look how we connect you being wise so he's saying you making that statement you need to to actually have fear of the lord because fear of the lord you can't talk so fear the lord and depart from evil it shall be held to thy navel and marrow to thy bones anybody with me tonight what are we doing for time who's track of all right we might we might we might reach not much full destination but close all right honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all that and increase well this year is direct to those who don't want to pay tithes and they don't want to put god first and there's a whole teaching by itself if you don't understand the principle of this thing you you negate verse 10 this is not about punishment this is about honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase listen to why verse 10 so shall thy bands be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine so if that is important to you then you will do verse 9. that's scripture this shouldn't take explanation but we're dealing with why is we dealing with fool we dealing with simple you have to understand how god places this law he said put me first in your heart put me first in your mind put me first with your substance in all your ways acknowledge me and watch me bless you verse 11 my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be wary of his con of his correction where he is tired of his correction so god is saying don't ever get tired of coming to a church service don't ever get tired or commit a meeting and hear anything that you need to fix in your life don't get exhausted about it don't feel aware about it we are coming here to be edified i am reading this and i'm looking at the word of my life and i want to compare with isn't it i am trying to see lord am i living up to every single verse because the prophet taught us if you don't see jesus in every verse read it again in other words see the strength in every single verse of scripture most of us don't invest the time to go through these things and look at our lives and slow down and i turn god through this experience we have been able to come together like this and say oh wow i didn't really see it so i didn't really process it so i know two little verses yet a little verse yeah but this is much more than that this is about me growing to be a son that he could say this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased he has understanding he has knowledge he has wisdom but ibrahim said he could sign the father's check he could run the business you can run the business if you don't know you can't run just if you don't understand he currently business if you have wisdom anybody with me how can god give you power in his kingdom how he lay things out and you coming out there where i know i know i understand i know i that is not that's not this thing anybody with me my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be wary of his correction so this speaks about your attitude your attitude to being corrected your attitude to being chastened and chasing is not punishment chasing in this context is not already punishment it's it's get back in line get back in line get back in step you're not where you're supposed to be you could do better and and you know whenever somebody said you could do better you know in your heart is it true to know if i come tonight and say everything is good with you everything is good with you you have to do nothing why are you coming but when they come in here listen i need a little more seating that mercy thing i need to put a little more a little more focus on that because you're being encouraged now to dig a little deeper to go a little higher you know anybody with me let's go for whom the lord loveth verse 12 he corrected even as a father the son in whom he delighted so he's saying a good father delight in correcting a son who could do better who could improve because god is about improvement this gospel and this is the challenge i have with people saying i've been in a message for 20 years and your behavior is the same as it was 20 years ago you have no improvement verse 13 happy is the man that find it wisdom and the man that get it understanding so as as this as all the pieces begin to connect in your life there's a happiness that comes did you ever think of it there's a happiness that comes a happy is the man that find it wisdom and the man that get it understanding there's a happiness what's what have you been happy about lately because this is a reason to be happy you know i i i when i said i already think about it i wish i could swallow i could spend a whole hour yesterday's one verse happy is the man that find it wisdom when god say happy happy you know like you don't know happiness like you say you don't know what i don't know you know this happens here you ain't notice happiness if you understand this thing enough you are limited you are not one percent happy and god is saying the happiness i talk about if you understand how happy you will be when you find this thing called wisdom and the man that gets understanding if you understand why god take you through your experience and you understand why he put you in the house you're in and why he put you in your family and why you went to that school you went to if you could ever understand why he he didn't let this thing work out because he really knew that he went down that road you would have never come to know him if you really understand that that that that your your first choice school that you wanted to get you didn't get it because he really wanted you to go down a different path to come to know him a certain way when he really understand the things that you're disappointed about was really for your betterment that if you didn't get that disappointment it wouldn't have driven you to where you're at today to be in this room oh my how happy you become when you get a deeper understanding of how you didn't find the message but the message had to find you but what you didn't know was was your journey and your child and your experience if you only understood then what you understand no oh you would have been happier then but you can be happy now and i could go on and on about looking at it another way tonight how happy happy is the man that find it wisdom and the man that gets it understanding verse 14 for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain or the profit thereof than fine gold so so there's there's a profit there's a value to this understanding there's a value to this wisdom that is better there's more profit in what we doing tonight oh gosh if you can catch this there is more profit in what happened right now than the time you can spend in your business and the prophet of this meeting will have an impact on your business how god is so good that the more time you spend with him is the more results you have in your life oh help us tonight let me give you an example them brothers fish all night and catch nothing and just a few minutes with jesus was more profit in that few minutes that when he said cast your net on the next side they find fish they didn't all the all night god put a beacon a gps tracker until fish show up right here all the business did you trying to find and it's been hours hours always hours this meeting is the key to unlocking those or helping tonight anybody with me tonight the things you're trying to do i try to figure out this here's the key to it it has more profit in this more profit in the world more profit in understanding how god operates how he thinks hallelujah it sounds simple but this is life here this is this is encouragement this is encouragement to us tonight she is more precious than rubies who and all the things thou can't desire and not to be compared unto her so he's in everything you could ever want you can't even compare to this thing here length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honor so look how look up salon make it clear he said when you find this understanding and i find this wisdom on the one hand oh hallelujah anybody with me verse 16 length of days is in your right hand and in the left hand riches and honor so people are trying to pay bills and and they're looking to get you riches but if you find wisdom and understanding with rhythm and understanding in the left hand command which is an honor and in your right hand is long life you you see this thing you know what that means people were spending their time with searching for the wrong thing all the time you know hallelujah her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her parts are peace oh gosh listen this thing is always like this thing again better and better is that is that your experience she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is everyone that repeated her isn't this your desire tonight isn't this the experience you want to have is this not the approach is this how you want to live every single day of your life the lord by wisdom have founded the earth so so now solomon is bringing into context the practicality of the application of these three things we're talking about knowledge understanding and wisdom so he said if you want to understand how this thing is applied in a display way in a demonstrative way how these things could be used in other words he said in verse 19 the lord by wisdom have founded the earth by understanding that he established the heavens by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the view so you're saying it was these three things at work to see oh my i don't know if you i i think i have my own services so then solomon brings it back to you now bring it back to speaking father the son as it were my son let them not depart from thine eyes so he's saying keep it in your eyes keep focus on this thing where where are your eyes focus on what are you looking for what are you trying to achieve where is your because what you focus on is what you will live out anybody with me tonight what you spend your time doing is what you will be known for find the right balance we're gonna we're gonna get right to close now so shall so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck then shall thou walk in thy way safely is there anybody want to want to walk safely will he give you the key knowledge understanding wisdom you want to walk safely and thy foot shall not stumble and these are open statements which means he is not qualifying these statements so thy foot shall not stumble in scripture and in studying you can extend this therefore child not stumble in business like foot shall not stumble in marriage like for child not stubborn in your relations yo because he's saying if you operate this way as you move as you walk he wants god wants you to walk with the confidence of knowing that you're part of his economy and you're part of his family that you're walking with angels to this patch to protect you window lies down and i said it i said it look at scripture when thou lie is down thou shalt not be afraid ye thou shall lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet i don't know that there's a difference that is a day that alone is a revival it have people in the message jumping and sorting at mystery and they sleep not sweeten find that reconciliation in scripture you know mystery and your sleep now tweet something wrong because this great god wants you to be able to lie down at night and know that your name is written in the book know that the price has been paid know that no weapon formed against you could prosper know that you're going out is blessed you're coming in is blessed knowing that your step is ordered by god knowing you're the car even stumble what an assurance how your sleep can be sweet so if it is you know mystery and they could you could break seals and it took and you can't sleep at night that making sense that might be much have to add up you have to have a life and live in such a way and understand that this word come that you could sleep beautiful sleep let me read it again that one when thou lies down though shall not be afraid yay thou shalt lie down and i sleep shall be sweet then he goes on to make sure you understand be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh for the lord shall be thy confidence this is my declaration to you tonight may the lord be thy confidence you're going for a loan may the lord be like confidence you got to open a business may the lord be like confidence you go and venture where you haven't gone before may the lord be thy confidence you go and speak where you haven't spoken before may the lord be thy confidence you're gonna apply for a promotion may the lord be like confidence you're gonna ask for a raise in the pandemic may the lord be thy confidence hallelujah let me get ready to close out and shall keep thy foot from being taken i will choose to end there tonight because if i keep going we'll keep going but my by the grace of god there's a lot in here and that i want to kind of continue on and take my time with and i wouldn't believe i'll do it justice tonight so let's just bow our heads for word of prayer heavenly father we thank you tonight that we could look into this book of wisdom lord of the application of your thoughts your thinking your mind on how we should live in our everyday lives how we should live to navigate lord the journeys that you and your in your great wisdom have mapped out
