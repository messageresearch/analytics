[18:48] morning you are grateful to the lord
[18:51] this morning
[18:53] amen amen
[18:56] you can keep playing soft leaders let's
[18:58] pray
[19:00] our gracious heavenly father we thank
[19:02] you this morning that we could have the
[19:04] opportunity to gather
[19:07] the last time we were able to do this
[19:09] was on april the 18th
[19:13] it's been a while that we have been able
[19:14] to come together
[19:16] lord as your word commands us to do
[19:20] lord is said to forsake not the
[19:22] assembling and
[19:23] this whole evolution of this world and
[19:26] the situation of this world have
[19:29] blindsided so many different things
[19:32] but we are grateful this morning to be
[19:34] here
[19:35] lord for those that could make it out
[19:37] and for those that are connected on the
[19:39] internet
[19:40] lord we are so grateful for this moment
[19:43] lord as we see the
[19:45] clock
[19:46] that times this
[19:48] world and how long it will exist is
[19:50] counting down to close a completion
[19:54] man cannot stop it
[19:56] governments cannot stop it
[19:58] nobody could stop it because god has
[20:00] ordered it to be this way
[20:02] but lord we have broken out of our
[20:05] comfort zone as it were
[20:07] lord to come and put you in your place
[20:10] in our lives you told us in your word to
[20:12] seek you first
[20:14] above everything else lord and
[20:15] everything else will fall in its place
[20:18] lord has been so easy over time for
[20:21] people to lose sight of what's important
[20:23] so we thank you this morning that
[20:26] lord we can gather one more time lord
[20:28] and we don't know what will unfold in
[20:30] the next few months or how long we are
[20:32] here but for the moment we have together
[20:35] we are so grateful so may you bless your
[20:37] people may your anointing even the
[20:40] shekinah glory the august presence will
[20:43] fall upon your people both here and
[20:45] those that are in their homes
[20:47] lord may you prick our hearts as it were
[20:49] lord may you stir our hearts lord in a
[20:53] new way father we commit the service
[20:55] into your hands and the reading of the
[20:57] word
[20:58] in the precious theme of jesus christ
[21:00] and the church says
[21:02] amen and amen so i'd like to welcome you
[21:05] as you know we are on a restricted time
[21:08] so
[21:08] all protocols and formalities observed
[21:12] uh we do have another praise
[21:14] i want to address this before i get in
[21:16] uh from sister rajkumar she called this
[21:19] morning she would have put in a request
[21:21] or prayer request i believe it was true
[21:23] but ovid to three of her sisters in law
[21:25] who had come down with a virus and she's
[21:28] thanking god for answering prayer two of
[21:30] them are 90 percent recovered and one is
[21:32] 80 recovered so she wants to thank god
[21:34] so we really want to
[21:36] praise god for that in addition we do
[21:38] want to remember the knights family in
[21:40] prayer
[21:41] uh in a special way i think most of you
[21:45] were in the zoom meeting and certainly
[21:47] the services there on the channel so you
[21:49] could see it if you missed it
[21:50] and we do have uh
[21:52] an announcement with respect to the
[21:54] funeral arrangements as of this moment
[21:56] what we do know is that the service will
[21:58] be held
[21:59] here at the tabernacle this coming
[22:01] thursday at 1 pm
[22:03] further details will follow so
[22:05] may the lord reach you bless you so i'd
[22:07] like to go straight to the wood
[22:09] this morning
[22:10] for a short time in the present a short
[22:13] quick message
[22:15] amen
[22:16] so reading from saint john 6
[22:19] and reading from verse 53 seen john 6
[22:23] and reading from verse 53.
[22:28] thank you brother anthony thank you
[22:29] musicians
[22:31] i want to keep track of time
[22:38] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[22:40] i say unto you except you eat the flesh
[22:43] of the son of man
[22:45] and drink his blood
[22:47] ye have no life in you
[22:50] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[22:53] blood hath eternal life and i will raise
[22:56] him up at the last day
[22:59] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[23:02] is drink indeed
[23:05] he that eateth my flesh and drink it my
[23:08] blood dwelleth in me
[23:09] and i in him
[23:12] as the living father hath sent me and i
[23:15] live by the father so he that eateth me
[23:17] even he shall live by me
[23:21] this is that bread which came down from
[23:24] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[23:27] and are dead he that eateth of this
[23:29] bread shall live forever
[23:32] these things said he in the synagogue
[23:35] as he taught in capernaum
[23:38] many therefore of his disciples when
[23:41] they had heard this said this is a hard
[23:44] saying who can hear it
[23:47] when jesus knew in himself that his
[23:49] disciples murmured at it
[23:52] he said unto them doug this offend you
[23:56] what and if you shall see the son of man
[23:59] ascend up where he was before
[24:02] it is the spirit that quicken it the
[24:04] flesh profited nothing the words that i
[24:07] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[24:10] are life
[24:11] but there are some of you that believe
[24:13] not
[24:14] for jesus knew from the beginning who
[24:16] they were that believe not and who
[24:19] should betray him
[24:22] and he said therefore
[24:24] said i unto you that no man can come
[24:26] unto me except it were given unto him of
[24:29] my father from that time many of his
[24:32] disciples went back and walked no more
[24:34] with him
[24:36] then said jesus unto the twelve will he
[24:38] also go away
[24:40] then peter answered him lord to whom
[24:42] shall we go thou has the words of
[24:44] eternal life
[24:45] and we believe and are sure that thou
[24:47] art that christ the son of the living
[24:49] god jesus answered them have i not
[24:51] chosen you twelve and one of you is a
[24:53] devil
[24:54] he spake of julius iscariot the son of
[24:57] simon for he it was that should betray
[25:00] him being one of the twelve may the lord
[25:02] at a blessing to the reading of his word
[25:04] you may be seated this morning
[25:07] amen it's such a great privilege to be
[25:09] able to speak to somebody
[25:12] in the church
[25:13] is really really wonderful
[25:15] amen so i have a title this morning and
[25:18] the title is a question
[25:20] a burden on my heart what kind of
[25:23] believer are you
[25:25] it's a question this morning what kind
[25:27] of believer are you with a subject
[25:30] separating the word bride from the
[25:32] church members and an inspiration only
[25:35] the elect have the ability to hear from
[25:38] god
[25:40] what kind of believer
[25:42] are you
[25:44] and we know it that brother branham many
[25:46] times he would mention that there are
[25:49] three kinds of believers
[25:52] and it was in november on november 24
[25:55] 1963
[25:56] he decided to actually preach on it
[25:59] and in his comments
[26:01] before he started to preach on it he
[26:03] mentioned i've said it so many times but
[26:05] i decided to actually take time to
[26:08] preach on this subject of three kinds of
[26:11] believers
[26:12] he said the first is believers
[26:16] make believers
[26:17] and unbelievers
[26:19] he said no that is quite a subject but
[26:21] as sure as we sit here tonight and i say
[26:24] as so as we sit here today that group is
[26:27] always gathered together
[26:29] now this is a shaking statement to make
[26:32] because it means as little as we may be
[26:34] today because of the pandemic there are
[26:37] three kinds of believers in the room
[26:38] this morning
[26:42] if you believe the scripture and you
[26:44] believe the word of god it is impossible
[26:47] for you to assume or believe that
[26:49] everyone that sits in a church are true
[26:51] believers
[26:52] because that's not what the bible
[26:53] teaches it's not what the prophet
[26:55] teaches in every church there's no
[26:58] exception to this statement but there
[27:00] branham said in every church there are
[27:02] three kinds of believers i don't care
[27:04] how clear the teacher is i don't care
[27:06] how powerful the preaching is i don't
[27:08] care how much time you spend in the
[27:10] world in every kind of church there are
[27:12] three kinds of believers
[27:14] what kind of believer are you
[27:17] hallelujah can the church say amen i was
[27:20] saying but over a few minutes ago i said
[27:22] this was in jesus's church
[27:25] jesus had three kinds of believers in
[27:27] his church there is no way i could
[27:29] preach like jesus there's no way i could
[27:32] teach like jesus i can't explain like
[27:34] jesus i can't go into your heart the way
[27:37] jesus did but in jesus church there were
[27:40] three kinds of believers so we are not
[27:42] kidding around this morning with knowing
[27:44] that there are three kinds of believers
[27:46] the mission this morning
[27:48] is to shake a believer who is an
[27:51] unbeliever in the church into position
[27:53] the mission this morning is to shake a
[27:56] make believer who is supposed to be a
[27:58] true believer back into their position
[28:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[28:06] i know i want to make a distinction
[28:08] we're not going to be here too long but
[28:09] this is a burden on my heart
[28:11] three kinds of believers in the church
[28:14] true believers make believers and
[28:17] unbelievers the unbelievers that brother
[28:20] branham is speaking about is not the
[28:21] worldly unbeliever
[28:24] let's be clear on this now this is an
[28:26] unbeliever who comes to church this is
[28:28] an unbeliever who worships this is the
[28:31] unbeliever who goes to prayer meetings
[28:33] this is the unbeliever who has spoken
[28:35] word books this is an unbeliever who
[28:37] says amen but deep down in their heart
[28:40] they don't really believe
[28:41] somebody helped me this morning in the
[28:44] church three kinds of believers oh when
[28:47] i saw this it started to shake me a
[28:48] little bit because i want to be sure who
[28:51] am i i want to be sure i'm the right
[28:54] kind of believer because in the church
[28:57] there are three kinds of believers this
[28:59] has nothing to do with how long you're
[29:00] in the message it has nothing to do with
[29:03] believing because it's believers but
[29:05] it's quality of believers it's the
[29:08] caliber of the believers it's the
[29:10] characteristics of the believers
[29:14] anybody help me this morning whether
[29:17] madame said and i want to lay it here
[29:19] but i'm saying this is 1963 in november
[29:22] of 1963 he said wherever the people
[29:25] gather we find this group so he said
[29:27] wherever there's a gathering whether
[29:29] it's a convention whether it's a meeting
[29:31] whether it's a zoom room whether it's a
[29:33] prayer meeting well i don't care where
[29:35] is this
[29:36] once people gather together you're gonna
[29:38] find three kinds of people in there oh
[29:41] can the church say amen
[29:43] oh hallelujah he said wherever the
[29:45] people gather we find this group and
[29:48] always have found them and we probably
[29:51] always will have them until the coming
[29:54] of the lord
[29:56] so according to this he said until the
[29:59] coming of the lord so people will be
[30:01] walking together until there come a road
[30:03] that they cannot pass people will walk
[30:05] together until they meet your spot that
[30:08] all the colors will have to show who you
[30:10] really are if you really a true believer
[30:13] or if you're just a make-believer or if
[30:15] you're really an unbeliever oh come on
[30:18] now somebody help me this morning
[30:23] the kind of believer you are determines
[30:25] the kind of man you are the kind of
[30:28] believer you are determines the kind of
[30:30] woman you are the kind of believer you
[30:33] are determines the kind of father you
[30:35] are the kind of believer you are
[30:38] determines the kind of mother you are
[30:40] the kind of believer you are determines
[30:42] the kind of son you are the kind of
[30:45] believer you are determines the kind of
[30:47] husband you are the kind of believer you
[30:50] are determines the kind of wife you are
[30:52] the kind of believer you are determines
[30:55] the kind of deacon you are yes a deacon
[30:58] could be a make-believer yes a deacon
[31:01] could be an unbeliever and yes a deacon
[31:03] could be a true believer
[31:07] somebody preached back to me
[31:09] what kind of believer
[31:12] are you
[31:13] hallelujah
[31:15] it's a deep question
[31:17] it's not how long you're in the message
[31:19] it's not have you connected to all the
[31:21] services it's that how many books you
[31:23] read or what you understand
[31:27] what kind
[31:29] of believer
[31:31] are you
[31:33] brother branham said here
[31:35] i'm in the same court and we probably
[31:37] always will have them until the coming
[31:39] of the lord
[31:41] and i want us tonight to picture
[31:43] ourselves as i speak
[31:45] of these three groups and see what group
[31:48] that we are in
[31:50] so when were ibrahimos preaching this it
[31:52] was to shake the people so that they
[31:54] could see
[31:56] what group
[31:58] you're really in
[32:04] i said it
[32:05] on friday night
[32:07] i said it when i spoke at brother
[32:09] monda's house
[32:10] i said when a loved one a brother passes
[32:13] on
[32:14] it's a snap it's a reminder of the
[32:17] reality
[32:18] because we make plans for tomorrow
[32:21] we have things we want to do
[32:23] we have all these things that we think
[32:25] we have control over and then god puts
[32:28] the line that we cannot pass
[32:31] and then we have to give an answer we
[32:33] have to give a count
[32:38] at that point there's no room to change
[32:40] there's no room to make things right
[32:42] there's no room to say what should have
[32:44] been said or
[32:48] so i prefer to ask today
[32:51] while you have the time to fix things
[32:54] what kind of believer are you
[32:59] i have a burden
[33:00] i have nose but i want to speak to you a
[33:02] little bit i'm troubled friends
[33:05] i was saying about over this pandemic
[33:07] has been a
[33:09] a filtering
[33:11] no prefect
[33:13] no police over your shoulder
[33:16] nobody watching how you're living in
[33:17] your home and if you're connecting to
[33:20] this service and if you're praying every
[33:22] day and and how you're living your life
[33:24] and how you're talking to your husband
[33:26] and talking to your wife and dealing
[33:28] with your co-workers and are you really
[33:30] a christian it's just you and the tutor
[33:33] now
[33:35] and you can fool the tutor what kind of
[33:39] believer are you
[33:42] your behavior
[33:44] your attitude your words your actions
[33:47] makes it very clear to god what you
[33:50] are the challenge is many of us we
[33:53] deceive ourselves that's bible
[33:56] deceive ourselves
[33:57] i said about over i said so many people
[33:59] feel that just being in the message is
[34:02] enough
[34:04] it's true you know
[34:07] i believe i believe
[34:09] so you don't think those who were jesus
[34:11] were believers
[34:16] but when they came to a crossroad and
[34:18] jesus said something to them they could
[34:20] not understand
[34:23] they started the murmur
[34:26] murmuring is me talking about saying hey
[34:29] are you ready with this i'm not sure you
[34:30] know already not i don't know it's hard
[34:33] scene but i don't know if i could ready
[34:35] i'm not sure already
[34:38] and before you know it 70
[34:40] the majority of jesus's church
[34:44] left the church
[34:48] 70 walked away they were the unbelievers
[34:52] in the church
[34:53] they believed up to a point
[34:56] they would have stayed in the church had
[34:57] jesus not said what he said
[35:02] anybody with me
[35:03] had jesus not confronted them with a
[35:06] higher truth that they did not yet
[35:08] understand they would have still been
[35:09] there saying come on preacher come on
[35:12] jesus
[35:13] say it
[35:14] jesus but the opening of the truth
[35:18] revealed what was really in them
[35:21] hallelujah when they were called to a
[35:23] higher level
[35:25] suddenly they felt the water that they
[35:27] were in was too much water to swim and
[35:29] they had to get out of water
[35:34] and in this whole season that we're
[35:36] living in
[35:37] i'm hearing there young people who don't
[35:39] connect to the services
[35:41] you don't have to travel to church
[35:44] during the pandemic you had to spend no
[35:46] money to come to service
[35:48] uh anybody with me this morning
[35:50] how do you explain that not to me you
[35:53] don't owe me an explanation you owe god
[35:55] an explanation and you tell me you are a
[35:57] believer what kind of believer are you
[36:01] anybody with me this morning not just
[36:04] young people all kinds of calabs all
[36:07] people young people
[36:12] i came this morning to hit the reset
[36:14] button
[36:15] because jesus wasn't playing games his
[36:17] ministry changed and he wasn't he wasn't
[36:20] playing around no he said listen listen
[36:23] i hear all your talking i hear oh you're
[36:24] talking and he said you wrestle who here
[36:27] you better be sure you want to be here
[36:29] you know he said will you go also he
[36:31] wasn't trying to beg them or persuade
[36:34] them he said listen if you want to go
[36:36] also you're free to go also but there's
[36:38] truth that i'm preaching is to take you
[36:40] to where you need to oh you don't hear
[36:42] me this morning you is there anybody in
[36:44] the house this morning so i'm not here
[36:47] to take prisoners this morning i'm here
[36:49] to knock the devil out i'm here to
[36:51] destroy the works of darkness and went
[36:54] on an assignment because the devil has
[36:56] not been playing games he's been
[36:58] infiltrating homes infiltrating lives
[37:05] oh you don't hear me this morning
[37:07] i'm not going to be
[37:09] too much longer
[37:10] hallelujah but if it's one thing we want
[37:13] to do tonight one thing we want to do
[37:15] today is shake you
[37:17] back into a realization that it's that
[37:20] that listen listen i have a job to do
[37:22] brother over there's a job to do and you
[37:24] have a job to do the ministers the ls we
[37:26] have a job to do i want you to sleep
[37:28] tonight by the grace of god knowing i
[37:31] said what the lord told me to say let
[37:33] the chips fall away lie i want to be
[37:36] able to stand like jesus and say if you
[37:38] want to go you could go if you want to
[37:40] serve god you could serve god you want
[37:42] to go and play the fool with the world
[37:44] that's your choice if you want to leave
[37:46] with your limited belief and your
[37:48] limited understanding and do what you
[37:50] want to do i'm not even going to try to
[37:51] stop you you do that we have come too
[37:54] far to turn back now
[37:56] we are moving to a season where true
[37:58] believers born sons filled sons inspired
[38:03] sons want to go all the way to adoption
[38:06] all the way to perfection
[38:10] and nothing is going to move me
[38:12] nothing's going to shake me
[38:14] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[38:17] lord hallelujah
[38:22] now let's go a little deeper for a few
[38:24] minutes brother branham said a believer
[38:27] i'm reading from the message three kinds
[38:29] of believers just one message but amanda
[38:32] preached on this topic
[38:35] three kinds of believers
[38:37] you should study it this week in fact
[38:39] that's your homework
[38:42] that's your homework i'm officially
[38:43] brought over is that all right that is
[38:45] your home but over just co-signed it
[38:48] listen to the tips three kinds of
[38:50] believers
[38:56] true believers in the church it's hard
[38:59] to really conceptualize you know because
[39:01] you would think people who come in the
[39:02] church are all true believers make
[39:04] believers in the church what are the
[39:05] make believers
[39:06] in fact let me start from the but
[39:08] rebellion started and i'm going to get
[39:10] it in a second on the believer's side i
[39:11] want to i want to go to the unbeliever
[39:13] then come back to the believer and then
[39:14] take it from there
[39:15] the unbeliever is the one who come into
[39:17] church and they believe you know
[39:19] but they just don't believe everything
[39:23] that's how bitter branham brought it out
[39:24] they don't believe everything they
[39:25] believe a lot of stuff
[39:28] they believe a lot
[39:30] but not everything
[39:33] they are believers
[39:35] but they have some unbelief
[39:39] they are believers
[39:41] but they just can't see something
[39:44] the way you would see it
[39:46] so the world has certain requirements
[39:50] let me bring it
[39:52] context you want to the home and the
[39:53] family wives who reverence your husband
[39:55] you know that's an instruction right
[39:58] that's not a debate that's not a
[39:59] suggestion that's not a recommendation
[40:01] is that uh
[40:02] oh you hear me this morning so so so the
[40:05] the believers
[40:07] when the holy ghost move in
[40:09] see them
[40:10] but in their house
[40:12] no reference for their husband
[40:15] because they don't believe their husband
[40:17] is deserving of reverence
[40:22] and the scripture didn't qualify whether
[40:24] your husband is deserving a reference or
[40:26] not that's a reference to your husband
[40:30] and right there unbelief
[40:32] inside the heart can we can we dig down
[40:35] a little bit can we perform surgery a
[40:37] little bit
[40:39] so the unbeliever have an issue with it
[40:42] because they really don't believe they
[40:43] should be reversing their husband the
[40:45] make believer
[40:49] they understand it you know they believe
[40:52] this was a revenue husband you know but
[40:54] no it's not a genuine reverence
[40:57] this is where is the oscars is the one
[40:59] for the acton
[41:00] the oscars
[41:01] this is where the the acting starts up
[41:04] because he the make-believer could
[41:05] perform
[41:07] the make-believer they're not openly
[41:09] saying i don't believe it
[41:11] they believe it but
[41:13] it's a kind of put-on thing they they're
[41:15] slipping in the cracks
[41:18] they're serving the food nice you know
[41:19] but behind that food is oh god this man
[41:21] is not easy
[41:25] i'm trying to use simple examples
[41:27] features in the heart because behind
[41:29] this what god is looking at his heart
[41:33] do you truly believe my word my
[41:35] instruction or are you make believing
[41:37] this piece you're kind of you're
[41:38] believing that they're putting on a show
[41:39] for me to think you believe it because i
[41:41] can really see what's going on in your
[41:42] heart or do you not believe it
[41:45] i'm your in church
[41:48] [Music]
[41:53] honor
[41:54] your father and mother
[41:58] the true believer accepts that
[42:00] you don't qualify that god blessed you
[42:03] as a christian this is it's a perplexing
[42:05] to me i'm hoping this helps you and you
[42:07] will understand what god is looking at
[42:09] the lord open your eyes to this great
[42:11] message
[42:13] as a believer
[42:14] how could you dis disrespect your
[42:16] unbelieving father
[42:21] wouldn't it be that the revelation that
[42:23] god give you make you so magnanimous
[42:26] so generous so giving that you can
[42:28] overlook the falls of your father
[42:32] when they're especially when they're not
[42:33] able you could overlook that because god
[42:35] overlooked your false is it
[42:40] and suddenly you are so spiritual that
[42:42] you have the right to now disrespect
[42:44] your mother and your father because
[42:45] they're not in church
[42:48] what kind how do you think god looking
[42:50] at that kind of believer when you they
[42:52] are lifting your hands thank you and god
[42:54] saying but look at you you just talk to
[42:56] your father so disrespectful how could i
[42:58] bless that
[43:02] i wanted to be in a home it must be in
[43:04] your life remember this gospel is not
[43:06] our letter things that are working
[43:07] inside the conference it's a life change
[43:10] that people must know they must take
[43:12] note that you have been with jesus i
[43:14] don't know if it's just helping anybody
[43:15] have somebody
[43:22] the virtue of this age is forgiveness
[43:24] broadly kindness
[43:26] the true believers could forgive
[43:31] the unbeliever in the church
[43:33] they're not sure they really don't know
[43:35] if they should forgive for this thing
[43:38] i'm not sure because i feel i want them
[43:40] to feel the brunt of what they did to me
[43:42] they need to suffer a little bit i could
[43:43] forgive them in time but but you're
[43:45] you're already a believer
[43:47] you're in church you know by your
[43:48] unbelieving church because you believe
[43:50] in a true believer would drop it right
[43:52] away
[43:53] how many times 70 times seven you just
[43:55] forgiven you're forgiven you're forgiven
[43:59] and if you can't do it for yourself for
[44:00] christ's sake you're just forgiven
[44:02] because that's a true believer the
[44:04] unbeliever in church but i remember when
[44:07] brother so-and-so put me on that seat
[44:09] boy and i didn't really like it up to no
[44:11] we can't shake your hand because of that
[44:14] is that true believer
[44:17] the make-believer is different the
[44:18] make-believer knows that this thing is
[44:20] intruder but they ride in with it
[44:23] everybody drop odds drop oats drop oats
[44:26] close your eyes go to your neighbor and
[44:28] drop oats and people will walk to you
[44:29] and say i forgive you
[44:31] the unbeliever can't come up to you and
[44:33] tell you that
[44:35] the unbeliever will sit there in church
[44:37] and say and go if you you have
[44:38] experiences
[44:40] go to somebody offended and make it
[44:42] right
[44:43] the unbeliever can't even reach that
[44:45] point to go make it right
[44:47] but the make believer now could come up
[44:49] to you
[44:50] and say brother anthony
[44:52] please forgive me
[44:54] i'm so sorry
[44:56] but in the heart by the currents
[44:58] watch now the gun still locked and
[45:01] loaded
[45:02] it is forgiveness with a loaded gun
[45:05] please i forgive you already not holding
[45:08] it against you but the gun under the
[45:10] jacket
[45:12] if you slip up again it's just bullets
[45:18] in the church
[45:20] listen it's not that they don't know
[45:22] forgiveness is requirement you know
[45:25] but the condition of the heart
[45:28] and you can't see it because it's not
[45:29] visible it's it's locked up envy and
[45:32] jealousy and the acting god bless you
[45:35] and behind it brother branham said it
[45:37] bothered him he said he used to go and
[45:39] haunt to get away from the people
[45:41] because they were saying things to him
[45:42] and he was seeing the spirit behind them
[45:51] now you may not have the prophetic eye
[45:53] to be able to see the spirit of somebody
[45:55] talking to you but rest assured from
[45:57] this teaching there are three kinds of
[45:59] believers
[46:03] and we have no control over what's the
[46:06] kind of believer somebody else is but
[46:09] for me
[46:10] i have to know what kind of believer am
[46:14] i
[46:14] and you have to know what kind of
[46:17] believer are you with i hope this helps
[46:19] somebody this morning
[46:26] mr branham said a believer doesn't have
[46:27] to be a smart person
[46:31] he doesn't have to be an educated person
[46:33] but obama wasn't educated i remember the
[46:35] banner was teaching this he was speaking
[46:36] about peter showing that peter in fact
[46:39] brother branham said this man had made
[46:41] this statement the bible itself said he
[46:43] was both ignorant and unlearned
[46:46] peter he was not a really considered an
[46:48] intelligent person i'm quoting the
[46:50] prophet
[46:51] but peter was a believer
[46:53] who could have explained at the time
[46:55] when jesus said to them except you eat
[46:57] my flesh and drink my blood who could
[46:59] have explained what jesus was really
[47:01] talking about
[47:02] not one of them had a clue
[47:09] but they believed
[47:12] can the church say amen
[47:14] so i trust this is helping you this
[47:16] morning
[47:17] to look at yourself a little way and
[47:19] your attitude towards the word of god
[47:22] and to understand is why the prophet
[47:23] would say full obedience to the entire
[47:26] word of god is what entitles you to the
[47:28] token said differently only to true
[47:31] believers because the only true
[47:33] believers could go into full obedience
[47:35] because they believe all of the word
[47:38] it's it's not it's not a buffet and
[47:40] you're taking what you want i only feel
[47:41] i want this this morning uh ready to
[47:43] come to church not already get this one
[47:45] already come to already jump and be any
[47:47] presence and i'm happy we back out but
[47:48] oh gosh yeah but eyes are coming and
[47:50] coming
[47:53] i come for that
[47:57] hallelujah believers make believers
[48:00] unbelievers three kinds of believers
[48:02] what kind of believer are you
[48:05] i don't want to touch a few things but
[48:06] ibrahim said noah you know what he was a
[48:09] true believer and you know what this
[48:10] thing about true believers
[48:12] many times what they believe don't make
[48:14] sense you know and that is why i realize
[48:16] more and more it is the grace of god to
[48:18] us to see it and you have to protect the
[48:21] seed of god in your soul
[48:23] noah went home and google if this thing
[48:26] could really rain and every report he
[48:27] gets anything can happen
[48:31] the fellas who were studying meteorology
[48:33] and the meteorologist that he did
[48:35] say this rain thing can happen
[48:38] no as a madman message no one that's
[48:40] making sense nowhere crazy how noah
[48:42] could say go and reign we have no
[48:43] evidence we have no data we look back in
[48:46] all the records empirical evidence
[48:48] suggests that noah is a madman but when
[48:50] god speaks to your heart you don't care
[48:53] if they call you a madman you don't care
[48:56] what anybody else says you don't care
[48:59] what or you don't hear me this morning
[49:01] it's revealed to you not from me not
[49:04] from the preacher but from god himself
[49:07] and noah if you call it a madman noah
[49:10] crazy noah no evidence noah listen i
[49:13] want you to understand this this is not
[49:15] like saying this person was healed and i
[49:18] could get healed too this is not saying
[49:19] this person was delivered and i get to
[49:21] get delivered too god gave noah a task
[49:24] to build a boat for something that never
[49:27] happened before and god gave this bride
[49:29] a task to make a church to make a
[49:32] revival to do what no other church ever
[49:35] did before so call me crazy if i dare to
[49:40] believe that we could do the impossible
[49:43] call me crazy if i have faith to believe
[49:46] that missing limbs in my day will be
[49:49] restored call me crazy if i dare to
[49:53] believe that we can make a revival
[49:57] [Applause]
[49:59] you may be seated
[50:03] nothing could move me
[50:04] nothing could shape me nothing could
[50:07] deter me
[50:08] me listen my faith and confidence is not
[50:10] in man no no
[50:14] my faith and confidence rest in the lord
[50:17] jesus christ
[50:18] because he is the perfect he's the
[50:20] perfect one
[50:21] i'm not leaning on my understanding i'm
[50:23] negan any man
[50:27] and paul who was the gold standard
[50:30] cleared up us for me that was my
[50:32] liberation
[50:34] then paul said follow me as i follow
[50:36] christ
[50:38] in other words i'm going to teach you
[50:40] like by the night set to the best i can
[50:45] follow me as i go down this road
[50:48] as you follow christ
[50:52] if you see me deviate keep following
[50:54] christ
[50:55] you see me move keep following christ
[50:57] you see this brother falls away keep
[50:58] following christ you don't understand
[51:00] something keep following christ
[51:06] can the church say man
[51:08] so noah
[51:09] he was a true believer
[51:11] friends quite honestly it is easier to
[51:14] believe now than before you know
[51:17] because we are not being challenged to
[51:20] believe what never took place in a real
[51:23] sense we saw elijah caught up in a
[51:25] chariot of fire oh come on now we see oh
[51:28] you you don't hear me this morning you
[51:30] saw enoch walking and one day oh his
[51:32] foot connected with the king's highway
[51:35] and enoch you couldn't find him no more
[51:37] so it is not like nobody ever did this
[51:39] before and one day i'm looking for the
[51:42] current so when i'll walk and my foot
[51:44] will connect
[51:45] with the king's highway and they're not
[51:47] going to see me no more because i'll be
[51:49] caught up in the rapture yes i believe
[51:51] there's going to be a rapture yes i
[51:54] believe that is what the true believers
[51:55] believe
[51:56] oh hallelujah that we are going to be
[51:59] changed that is mortal will put on
[52:01] immortality and no weapon formed against
[52:03] you is going to prosper i am a believer
[52:06] and i believe there are true believers
[52:07] this morning who believe your family is
[52:10] going to be delivered i don't care where
[52:12] they are this morning i don't care what
[52:14] they're doing this morning i don't care
[52:16] what condition they are in the god we
[52:19] serve is more than able to deliver them
[52:22] to break the chains to break the power
[52:25] of satan and who the son of man set free
[52:28] is free indeed there's no power present
[52:31] past to come that could stop the
[52:33] anointed sons of god from being oh come
[52:36] on now
[52:38] somebody help me
[52:40] somebody give god a shout out praise oh
[52:42] let's remind the devil whose side we are
[52:45] on let's remind the devil that we
[52:48] believe
[52:49] yes i believe i believe in miracles i
[52:53] believe in the outpouring of the holy
[52:54] ghost i believe seven thunders give
[52:57] faith i believe god sent a prophet to
[53:00] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[53:02] fathers
[53:04] [Music]
[53:08] you may be seated
[53:09] and you know what
[53:11] listen you know the crazy crazy crazy
[53:13] thing is
[53:14] the bible said that even the devil
[53:16] believes
[53:17] and the devil tremble him and people
[53:19] walking around church with a half a
[53:21] belief and a quarter belief and the
[53:23] devil knows that there's a power that he
[53:26] can't challenge the devil knows that
[53:28] when he met jesus dear in the wilderness
[53:31] he was no match with jesus the devil
[53:33] knows that if god ever gets his hand up
[53:36] on somebody that man becomes invincible
[53:39] the devil knows
[53:42] oh somebody help me this morning or
[53:45] sickness is being challenged this
[53:46] morning by the truth of who we are of
[53:49] who god is and what you are called to do
[53:52] and the devil cannot stop it the devil
[53:54] cannot change it
[53:57] hallelujah
[53:59] give the lord a shout out praise
[54:01] somebody
[54:02] oh hallelujah in your homes wherever you
[54:05] are this morning give the lord a shout
[54:07] out praise
[54:11] [Music]
[54:16] hallelujah
[54:18] hallelujah
[54:20] noah
[54:21] a true believer
[54:23] david
[54:24] a true believer
[54:26] belief has nothing to do with your
[54:28] ability
[54:31] to believe brother mikey has nothing to
[54:33] do with your ability
[54:35] because when david came to meet his
[54:37] brothers
[54:38] hallelujah they were all in the same
[54:41] church
[54:42] because at that day the church was the
[54:44] tribes as that church at that day the
[54:46] church was the sons of israel so they
[54:48] were all in the church
[54:49] but when david got there all he met was
[54:53] make believers and unbelievers the whole
[54:55] army didn't have one believer oh come on
[54:57] now somebody help me this morning not
[54:59] one person believed
[55:03] so it's only when david arrived
[55:06] the church was really complete
[55:08] because in every church you have to have
[55:10] three kinds of believers so when david
[55:12] got there no they could have church oh
[55:15] come on help me somebody
[55:16] kiss saul he make believer he said work
[55:19] on a shield now he put he had to put he
[55:22] had to do a performance prepare ammo for
[55:24] me so at least when i'm going out there
[55:26] i go look good
[55:28] make believer you know and don't forget
[55:30] them so there's them fellas any barracks
[55:32] their training and his unbelief i don't
[55:35] have the gun go work i do never saw it
[55:37] sharp all the training they took nobody
[55:40] want to challenge goliath but when david
[55:43] came and completed the church now three
[55:46] kinds of believers though they're having
[55:48] a conversation and david as he was about
[55:51] to leave he hear the challenge send me a
[55:54] man to fight me and david say wait a
[55:56] minute are we having church this morning
[55:59] are we having church this morning who is
[56:02] this uncircumcised phillies time that
[56:04] dare defy the army of the living god can
[56:08] we have church this morning
[56:12] somehow david knew that one could put a
[56:14] thousand to flight two could put ten
[56:16] thousand to flight david asks who is he
[56:19] i want his name i want to know how to
[56:22] address him i want to know his pedigree
[56:24] i want to know where he come from
[56:26] because every demon has a name and i
[56:28] want to fight in a vacuum i don't want
[56:30] to shoot an under normal target i want
[56:32] to know what i'm going after
[56:39] and his belief
[56:40] as a true believer was based on his
[56:43] experience with god when nobody else was
[56:46] there in the pandemic when nobody else
[56:49] was there he was faithful he was
[56:51] diligent he still had his own prayer
[56:53] meeting he's still connected to the
[56:55] service he still made it his business to
[56:58] do what god required of him
[57:01] anybody in the house this morning
[57:09] i'm trying to find a place to
[57:14] one day we're gonna not have to have a
[57:16] time limit but eclipse we're gonna
[57:18] fellowship on the other side when we let
[57:20] me meet up with nobody again now we see
[57:21] novi you remember we're talking about
[57:24] this thing couldn't know this thing
[57:25] could this thing could we had to get
[57:26] ready so that we could come and connect
[57:28] back with you because this bride has got
[57:30] to come to perfection if i cannot
[57:33] believe that i might as well pack up now
[57:36] if i can't believe this i had a better
[57:38] pack up now but i have to believe sister
[57:41] kangali that this church has to come to
[57:44] perfection to bring on the resurrection
[57:47] i have to believe that there are some
[57:49] true davids there are some true
[57:51] believers who despite the opposition who
[57:54] despite what the devil says who despite
[57:56] what the world says who despite the
[57:58] pressures in life
[58:00] could still say our god is more than
[58:02] able
[58:04] the god who delivered me from the lion
[58:07] the god that delivered me from the bear
[58:09] the god that delivered me from this
[58:10] pandemic the lord that delivered me that
[58:12] kept food on my table i may have lost my
[58:15] job but it was the lord who made a way
[58:17] he made a way i may have had a loss in
[58:20] income but god made it away i may have
[58:22] struggled during the pandemic but god
[58:25] made a way and if he made away from me
[58:28] he could keep on doing it because i'm
[58:30] his child and i'm a true believer i
[58:32] don't want to believe some things and be
[58:34] an unbeliever i don't want to pretend
[58:37] i'm a believer i want to go all the way
[58:39] and be a true believer come to church
[58:42] amen
[58:47] hallelujah
[58:49] my my
[58:51] the musician could begin to get ready
[58:52] we're not finished yet almost but
[58:54] you can begin to get ready
[58:57] short quick message
[58:58] i remember years ago
[59:01] one of my brothers i wouldn't name which
[59:02] one
[59:03] said what happened to these short picked
[59:05] messages
[59:06] to shake the whole nation he said
[59:08] services will be long sometimes
[59:11] that's it brother
[59:14] today is one of them short quick
[59:15] messages
[59:18] hallelujah but that's what i promised
[59:20] you know because this gospel is nothing
[59:21] word only
[59:22] this is our preparation to leave this
[59:24] place this preaching that we in now is a
[59:27] means to an end no no the end is you go
[59:30] into your family and say get off that
[59:32] sick bed oh that is the end the end is
[59:34] you go into your loved one and saying
[59:36] demon let her go come
[59:38] come come short quick message because
[59:42] his gospel is not in word only but it's
[59:43] in power and demonstration and only the
[59:46] true believers can be the ones who will
[59:48] demonstrate it somebody say amen
[59:53] oh hallelujah
[59:57] in the same
[59:58] message three kinds of believers
[1:00:02] but ibrahim said here i just want to
[1:00:03] drop this in so late here he said that
[1:00:06] ought to be the achievement of every
[1:00:09] believer this afternoon
[1:00:10] god is able to keep every word that he
[1:00:14] said he would do
[1:00:15] i don't care what the denomination says
[1:00:17] they say the days of miracles has passed
[1:00:19] and all this telepathy and all its
[1:00:21] fortune telling it doesn't matter to me
[1:00:23] what they say i still believe
[1:00:25] if that gun is zero to the target it
[1:00:28] will hit the target and i believe if a
[1:00:30] believer is zeroed with the word of god
[1:00:33] you see that's a problem people's
[1:00:34] zeroing on all other things except the
[1:00:36] word of god
[1:00:38] what this wasn't saying what this person
[1:00:40] say how it was explain explained but
[1:00:41] look at the condition this is the
[1:00:43] believer
[1:00:44] if that gun is zeroed in to the target
[1:00:47] it'll hit the target and i believe if a
[1:00:50] believer is zeroed with the word of god
[1:00:53] it'll hit the same thing if the word of
[1:00:56] god ever promised it it'll do it again
[1:00:59] i'm fully persuaded of that that when we
[1:01:01] see we're in this age when it's supposed
[1:01:04] to be here it's supposed to be here
[1:01:05] these things are supposed to take place
[1:01:07] that's the reason but randomly said i do
[1:01:10] believe that when the bride is called
[1:01:12] out and elected and set in the book of
[1:01:15] life there will come a sound from heaven
[1:01:18] that will take such a baptism of the
[1:01:21] holy spirit into that pride
[1:01:25] that will take her from the earth in a
[1:01:27] rapture in grace tell me who else
[1:01:29] preaches like this except this prophet
[1:01:32] god promised it don't care how much
[1:01:35] science and how much astronauts they
[1:01:37] signed up on everything else how many
[1:01:39] million miles they can see i don't care
[1:01:41] nothing about it there is a heaven and
[1:01:43] there is a literal jesus christ there
[1:01:45] that will come in a body form to receive
[1:01:48] his church to himself no matter listen
[1:01:50] to this no matter how old the story
[1:01:54] seems it's still the truth god said so
[1:01:57] that's what believers believe are there
[1:01:59] any believers this morning we believe
[1:02:01] that
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:04] final few quotes i'm not going to be the
[1:02:06] finishers today but
[1:02:08] by the grace of god we will
[1:02:10] but ivan am i talking about joe being a
[1:02:11] believer but it's a court that he he
[1:02:14] wrote here in the same message that
[1:02:16] that
[1:02:17] i really blessed me he's speaking about
[1:02:18] joseph
[1:02:20] you could begin to play something softly
[1:02:23] joseph another believer
[1:02:25] he couldn't help being
[1:02:27] what he was
[1:02:30] friends that's powerful
[1:02:32] couldn't help being what he was
[1:02:35] and i love god so much
[1:02:37] because every time i fall
[1:02:39] and get back up it's not just me getting
[1:02:42] back up you know it's because i can't
[1:02:44] help
[1:02:45] being what i am
[1:02:47] because a true believer is not that you
[1:02:49] wouldn't slip but a true believer always
[1:02:51] finds a way by the eclipse to get back
[1:02:54] up again
[1:02:57] but the man said he was a prophet god
[1:03:00] made him a prophet and god made you a
[1:03:03] son god made you a daughter and don't
[1:03:06] let the devil rob you of that
[1:03:10] you are not being shaped into it in that
[1:03:12] kind of sense god made you that way
[1:03:14] you've been hold but it's now god now
[1:03:16] now saying let me see if if no
[1:03:19] god made him that way
[1:03:22] listen to the prophet
[1:03:24] speaking about joseph he didn't want to
[1:03:26] be different from his brothers
[1:03:29] but he was different
[1:03:31] you didn't want to be different from
[1:03:32] your family
[1:03:34] but you are different
[1:03:37] you didn't choose this walk
[1:03:39] this walk chose you
[1:03:41] now what kind of believer are you
[1:03:44] as you respond to this call
[1:03:48] listen to the prophet god made him what
[1:03:50] he is
[1:03:51] and listen nobody else could take his
[1:03:54] place
[1:03:55] oh i was listening to the prophet seeing
[1:03:57] this this morning i was driving up us
[1:03:58] listening to the tape
[1:04:00] and he was speaking to me nobody could
[1:04:02] take my place
[1:04:03] nobody could take my place and nobody
[1:04:06] could take your place
[1:04:09] god wrote your
[1:04:10] name not as a formality
[1:04:14] he wrote your name and blood
[1:04:16] out of love
[1:04:18] out of his heart
[1:04:19] out of a desire to be able to reconcile
[1:04:22] you back to himself
[1:04:26] nobody else could take his place
[1:04:29] and the prophet said that now nobody can
[1:04:31] take your place no matter how little
[1:04:35] you say i'm just a housewife nobody can
[1:04:39] take your place
[1:04:40] god in his great economy has so set so
[1:04:44] the body of christ in order till there
[1:04:47] is no one can take your place so i
[1:04:50] challenge you this morning church as i
[1:04:52] close out this first message as we come
[1:04:55] back into the house of god don't you
[1:04:57] lose your place there's nobody else to
[1:04:59] take your place god called you he
[1:05:02] predestinated you and he will fill you
[1:05:05] with a wonderful glorious baptism of the
[1:05:07] holy ghost all the way to adoption
