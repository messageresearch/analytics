a blessing it is to be gathered together once more under his Banner of love amen Blessed Be His holy name amen [Music] so just as a beginner I want to start over though prayer from the prophet in Massachusetts Church of the Living God and he says and father your humble servant tonight I pray not that these people hear me but I am speaking to thee oh God May the angel that has guided me sent from you and fed me the days of my life may he stand by me tonight to confirm the words that I have said that the people might believe on thee and be saved and healed and may after the going of this meeting when the people wake up to the consciousness of what just happened May there be a Revival in every Church in the city may this city all be all together on us too for the Lord Jesus May every clergy man of the city Be Inspired Lord when he sees his church filling up and the people coming making their confession and wanted to join church and to live for Christ when he sees the sick that was one sick then healed and giving testimony on thousands of others Lord believing granted Lord tonight that something may happen that will stir them amen you feel that way tonight amen that something will steal us tonight that will have such an outpouring of his presence and his spirits and that his holy spirit will dwell Among Us and his presence will be with us and open his worthy man thank you Lamb of God you may have your seats what a time we've been having over the last few weeks what a convention I mean someone said this has been the greatest convention that we've had for a long long long time having a live convention like this what a blessing it has been to have the Brethren and the ministers from all around the world come and preach message after message amen and you appreciate brother Anthony on Sunday um amen thank you Jesus forgive me I I always say I've never I'm never a customer never ready but God is always in control he's always ready he's always prepared he's always on time amen bless the name of the Lord and you know oftentimes we we may go to a convention or in this case where we hosted the convention and we we come back to service and it might be okay to be to be a little overwhelmed and tired but we must never forget what the prize is and keep your eye on the prize despite what come what go who say what no matter what was done what was said we have to ensure that we continue pressing the battle to fight the good fight of Faith onto the resurrection amen so there's no time to sit down and just relax and and live normal and that's one of what I want to share about a little bit you know it's so customary it's so ordinary it's so normal it's almost habitual it's almost cultural that at times we we feel you know a little lethargic and we feel laid back and we feel like we could just take it easy and Float a little bit but before I even move into the scripture I want to give you my title and inspiration the title for tonight is Nester in time again Nest stirring time again and as an inspiration let's have a Revival amen so just as a background as referring to living normal and you know it's it's so customary to come to church and go back home and enter to to pray and and to to fast from time to time and after a while it becomes the norm after a while it becomes comfortable and I want to share something that that I discovered and and I know many of us might be aware of it but I just want to share it um for the benefit of those who may not be so familiar there's something called Stockholm Syndrome by definition it's a psychological response to being held captive psychological so it's in the mind that Battleground dangerous place to be but it's a psychological response to being held captive people with Stockholm syndrome form a psychological connection with their captors and begins sympathizing with them right so so these are the victims or they would be victims feeling almost sorry and feeling a part of the struggle and the journey although they are being held captive in addition to the original kidnapper hostage situation Stockholm syndrome now includes other types of trauma in which there's a bond between the abuser and the person being abused many medical professionals consider the victim's positive feelings towards the abuser a psychological response A coping mechanism that he used to survive the days weeks or even years of trauma or abuse I know some some may wonder what is significance of this what's the purpose of all this how does this relate to having a Revival and and and necessary in time again you see oftentimes we are held captive we are held in bondage and sometimes it becomes so normal that we fail to realize we are really being held captive and tonight we're here to outline to to to outline it and identify the devices of the enemy so we can break free and break past that kind of bondage so we can have a Revival because you can't be bound and have a Revival you can't be struggling and and and you're afraid and you're timid and you don't want to raise your hand and you don't want to worship and you don't want to praise God and have a Revival right so you need to understand the devices of the enemy how he tries to do things for you to feel sorry for your scenario so sorry if it doesn't sound familiar I will use some biblical examples when the children of Israel were in bondage there came a point in which they say listen why don't we go back because it was so normal it was so familiar it was so so they were conditioned culturally so much so that they felt you know what is a real challenge to live in with a real challenge to break free is a real challenge to break loose when you think about it in the early days when they were now in bondage I'm sure there might have been some Escape attempts I'm sure the passion was there the fire was there the bill was there to know listen somebody we were free all along but look what's going on the same thing would have happened in slavery days in more modern times where where the first group of Slayers may have felt what is this this is this is unjust this kind of unjustice kind of thing I want to ensure that I could Escape I want to ensure that I could get away until think about it after 40 years after 100 years keep in mind was 400 years right so after 200 years it became normal and ordinary that I grew up born I walk around I've been told I've been sold everybody has told me this is my destiny that it has become so accustomed it became accustomed to them they now develop habits or coping mechanisms that they they they almost resigned themselves to slavery that I'm going to work for the Taskmaster all my life and there's no coming out but tonight I'm here to say it's Nestor in time again Something's Gonna Shake something has to break something has to change for you to realize that this is not normal it is not normal to go to church and come back home it is not normal to sit down and and hope that something is going to happen it's not normal to sit down and pray that sometimes we'll have a Revival yes no no no no no no no something has to strike something has to change to ensure that on the inside inside that little button inside that little feet inside could be stirred up enough that you could have a Revival as an individual amen when you consider Noah Noah Noah's day and I'll read it in a second might have been the epitome of normal living right the Bible actually said you know they multiplied it they you know they took unto themselves wives and they they just expanded I just live and then they were evil and they were doing so many things that God repented that he created man that was the days of Noah you see it had become so normal every day day in day out you know what I got a wife here a family expander open my business and do things it became so normal that they forgot the boss himself they forgot their purpose they forgot that they were called until purpose right even when we look at a lot God revealed himself to Abraham and told him what was going to take place the the the the Abomination I was in Sodom and Gomorrah and lots being accustomed to this type of Lifestyle being accustomed to his way of living thought it normal to live in Sodom and Gomorrah it it became so familiar to him that he didn't even see listen what what is really going on just like slavery we're done wait a minute wait a minute similar to to to the prodigal's son you know normal living here just doing you're just going day after day month after me month year after year until something strikes sometimes it takes something drastic or dramatic to really impact your life and cause you to to take account cause you to check yourself and say listen wait wait wait wait wait wait a minute hold on like that guy who said listen I know way back in Africa I'm the child of a king so he had to sit on and say wait a minute even these servants in My Father's House have food they get paid they have place to live they're not living among the pigs they're not eating pig food so just like that sometimes it takes something with that I want to just ask you to stand as we read the scripture as you tune with me to the Book of Luke reading from chapter 17. this verses 26 to 29 when you find it say Amen Luke chapter 17 26-29 and as it was in the day of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man did it eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot did it eat they drunk they bought their soul they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all Legends Bar heads oh Heavenly Father tonight we deem it such a privilege to be gathered together Lord Lord I pray that you would take me Lord that you would take my words Lord that you would speak lip to air to your people Lord Lord we've read your word Lord but you have the ability to breed life into it you have the ability to bring it to life and make it real right now in this our Lord Lord you predestinated this group of people that that act uh uh uh right here live Lord those are connected on the internet Lord those that may see this afterwards Lord I pray that to be a blessing to them Lord Lord I pray that you anoint my lips Take Me Out to the way Lord I pray that you use me as a vessel to speak to your people and bless them tonight Lord I pray that you meet their every need and every expectation and every desire tonight Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen you love the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen let's just buy heads once more as we have a prayer request at this point we want to pray for brother uh Alexander Henry who's in hospital at this time presently getting nebulize may God heal him totally in Jesus name O Heavenly Father we pause once more to bring Alexander Henry before you Lord Lord you know you've got he's gone through so much Lord and even as he is in hospital right now I pray that you meet him wherever he is Lord we're down to bed on a chair wherever he is with it whichever Hospital you know your hands are not too short Lord you said healing is your children's bread Lord I pray that you will touch him from the crown of his head to the soul of his feet and if there's anybody else sick right now Lord I pray that you'll touch them and you will raise them up Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen amen you love him you know I just want to start from uh is a message Israel and the church number one in 1953 uh paragraph 159 it says and we started off with Ephesus and ended up in laodicea the lukewarm Church age where we are now having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof going to church and having people come in and saying accept Christ and puts in the name of the on a book but denying the baptism of the Holy ghosts and power and miracles and signs and wonders making fun of it in laodicean Church age which is spewed from God's mouth and the electric nap oh hallelujah oh something gets in my soul when I think about it friends or the world is in a condition today so we've already identified that this is not us no no we identify this because sometimes it's important to to identify what you don't want to be where you don't want to be where you shouldn't be so when I talk about slavery and when I talk about people in bondage and when we talk about Stockholm syndrome we don't want to be there we don't want to accept or become normal we don't want the norm be you know the devil you know the devil fighting me today you know struggling because this is what I am resigned to this this is this is his job and you start to pick up for him that's not what we want to do we identify that because we want to come against that we want to resist that we want to fight against that so you see this definition here this is an age we don't want that we want to accept the power of the Holy Ghost to come and heal and deliver and seal and baptize and set free and break bonds and loose that's what we want to anoint that's what we want to see in the church [Applause] all right no in a message super sign 63 paragraph 25 forgive me for quoting so much tonight and it says I know we find just about the same thing existing today when we know that we're living in the hour that gross darknesses cover Youth and the people and we find that all these modern achievements of super age and so forth that we're living in is only a sign of gross darkness in the spiritual realm we're in laodicea's church age where they're just lukewarm they could go to church and people does and seems to have a Zeal to go to church but to know anything about your spirits the time that they're living in some of them they are blind as they prove by his words still they just can't see it I wonder if it isn't just about like what he said we have eyes where we can't see we ought to look around and see all these things that happens our sign that the end is at hand because these are the things that was predicted to be at that time I want you to notice the unchanging continuity of God's word and his work see he never changes his program he never changes his ways just as perfectly the scripture is in perfect continuity everything that God does is in continuity with what he what what he done see what he did first that's he'll do it the second time the same way and just to prove it to you he has made laws in the earth and he's always given his people a sign before the event happens now he has always done it and he will always do it because he's at the unchangeable god I am God he says I change not the way he sets this program at the beginning that's the way he is at each age he never changes it when he puts the world to turn on 24-hour basis we might have Daylight Saving Times and all kinds of times but it never changes tuning of the world we make a complete circle every 24 hours turns around never changes his season God has spring summer winter just exactly like it always was that's the way he done it first that's the way he does it every time the continuity of his laws and of his word and of his works and all just perfectly Blends together therefore if we look what was he can know what is and what will be you can base your thoughts upon that for the scripture says he's the same yesterday today and forever so I ask you if he's the same yesterday today and forever and he took the children of Israel out of bondage and he took a lot out of Sodom and he took Noah and put him in an ark and shut the door and put a hedge of safety a wrong job what more will he do for us he's obligated to do the same thing every age he doesn't change he sees the continuity and is obligated to do that every time he did it yesterday he'll do it today and he'll do it again tomorrow because that's just the God we serve the same yesterday today and forever amen not never changes [Applause] [Music] you know when I said Nester in time brother Branham preached many many messages on Eagles and and still around and the nests and stuff many many messages various titles and it reminded me when when I looked at the eagle and look at some of these stories he gave some of the illustrations and and analogies he always referenced the fact that the eaglets would be in the nest they would be there and the mother Eagle would come and feed them they would feed them I assume would teach them guide them direct them until they reach a certain level of maturity right similar to our Pilots now somebody with ambitions to be a pilot doesn't wake up a day and say I want to be a pilot I'm going to fly a plane it has happened that way they need to go to training have tutors Governors ensure the Richer position in which the trainer has the the confidence and faith and knows that they are able and even then they don't send them out alone right so just like the mother Eagle they have them in the nurse they feed them they train them they guide them they prep them but you know what the in an environment that's comfortable that has become the norm that has become accustomed to them so they have habits in which is soft they know mother Eagle will bring food from a particular time in a particular way they will always be be fed and dealt with in a particular way until the mother Eagle as the teens or decides or figures out that they mature enough it was it is it is almost illegal for for the mother Eagle to take the the eaglet too young and throw it out in US similar to Children you can't take a child your child is a baby and you say walk down the road no it doesn't happen like you protect them and you form a hedge around them and they guide them until they're mature enough to be able to make decisions and be responsible and they could follow instructions amen so just like the pilot the pilot after training whether months or years or whatever period it takes they have something called inaugural flight or your first flight it's the first time you're going to go into the air right when they certainly cockpit there and they are about to take off they have to remember they have to go through they have to recall all the lessons only the solid training all the advice only recommendations right because they want to have a successful flight same way when the mother Eagle comes where isn't going to take place something does change the mother Eagle will look at them and start to make some noises that they never heard before but they know that's mother Eagle when that point comes the mother Eagle knows the mature enough to take the next step to take the inaugural flight the first flight they never fly before no First Flight is one of the most important and spectacular experiences because you've never done it before you know the kind of trust confidence and fate you need to take that first flight mother ego comes and before the flight mother Eagle shakes happiness to move all you lose things because you take them on the Fly holding on to the internet and holding on to Egypt and holding on to what was there before no you're gonna take them to another level you're gonna raise up above your circumstance above your custom above your habits above what you see as normal because what you think is normal is not normal anymore normal living cannot take into the Rapture you cannot go day in day out you come to church and you go back home and you go to church and you go back home and no change there has to come a point in which you get stirred up things change so sometimes you're forced to make that change and I'm gonna read it for you I'm gonna read it for you an eagle the eagle in her nest 57. right and just in the middle of paragraph 16 he said and God does the same thing in his church when we have all when we have got all settled down on something what shall we settled when you're subtle and you're comfortable and you feel like you know what I've got this I just go back and forth and God will bless me and things will happen and my family and you know everything will work out and everything is smooth no he said then God steals in us again he don't want it remain normal he says he brought Martin Luther from Catholicism and then they got so starchy that he stood the nest and sent Wesleyan then Wesley got so starchy he stood in essence and Pentecost sin it's Nester in time again because we got so settled down we got so comfortable we got so laid back we got to a level of acceptance where we thought like Stockholm syndrome that this is where we supposed to be and this is what we accustomed to and and you know we got a little chance now and again and we like it and that's fine but no no no no no God has way better in store for you so it goes on and he said this old mother eagle flies into the nest one day all unexpected unexpectedly little eaglets and as she comes into as she comes and oh how I've laid and watched them and weep like a baby with my binoculars trained on them my horse tied off somewhere watching them and she'll fly into the nest and she'll take those great wings and she'll give them a great shower of wind chicken things up a little bit you're not coming in quiet and smooth you're coming in with a shower of wind that's not what they're accustomed to it shakes every loose feather out to them so even if the eaglets have loose there's a shake North nothing else going on this trip nothing else taking this flight nothing loose because she's fixing to give them their first little solo flight you can't have loose feathers when you're solo flying for the Lord she flies in and they have a mighty Russian wind they never felt it before because they were born in the cleft of the rock why they are eagles but God changes it he gives them something new as the church was born in the as at the top of the rock we cannot be satisfied there God stirs up the nest sometimes this is not a pastor saying of the nest this is not a preacher's saying of the nest but God says happiness because he won that shaken to pray take place it's not because he vexed with you no he wants more for you he wants better for you so he has to shake you from wherever you are to take her to the next step amen now listen God stirs up the nest sometimes comes in with a mighty Russian wind like he did on the day of Pentecost and all the old worldly loose feathers fly out he sends a Pentecostal Revival and shakes up the nest then he gives a certain scream oh all the little eaglets know something is fixing to happen when that scream goes out you gotta take notice that something is fixing to happen you can't sit sit dead you gotta raise your hands you've got to open your mouth you've got to clap you gotta move your feet You Gotta Dance a little bit because something is fixed in to happen he gives a certain scream oh all the little eaglets know something is fixing to happen they're Eagles that's the reason when you see a shaken time come Eagles are ready for a blessing the church is ready for something the True Church of God when the sea are shaken time coming the old mother then throws her wings out and those little baby eagle at somehow they know by Nature Because of Who You Are by Nature they know just like a little calf he knows when he's born to get up and go nurse the mother nothing there to tell him but it's God that tells him those little Eagles know just how to place their little feet in her wings and take their little beak and hold on to a big strong feather God tells them and the Church of the Living God knows how to take whole of the word of God those Strong Winds of his deliverance and hold on to his Divine promise when a mighty shaken strikes the place they know how to hold something just tells them the world might say fanaticism but they take a hole of the wing and they hold on because the nature is eagles they know what to do amen my my my my blessed be the name of the Lord you see he's looking for people who have a passion to know the word to hold on to every promise a cry to get in the spirit and a fervent desire to please him that's what he's looking for you know in a message just one more time lord paragraph 52 he said did you ever think talking about Samson while those Philistines were wondering about Samson did you ever think what was going through Samson's mind what do you think was going on through that mind's mind I believe he was thinking while he was there yet totally blind never to have a sight again he was thinking about all the great victories that God had given there he was thinking of the days that was what they used to do and that's just about the way man is as I said here some time ago man is always thinking back what God did and looking forward to what God will do but ignoring what God is doing see look what he's doing now we know what he has done and he's sending to us and trying to stir us up again trying to bring us back to the path to his word and proving it by his Vindicated word and we just sit sleep go home say what did he say I hate to go hear them carry on so long that was coming in his mind but what we would call his Haiti back when he was in the spirit of the Lord still talking about Samson when the Lord answered his prayer even before he prayed as long as he lived for God God was right on time he didn't have to think about well no I gotta pray through now and see if these thousand Philistines you know what's going on happen here boy because I really didn't anticipate so many of them no no no no no he know that God was with him there was no condemnation so he just grabbed the first thing he had in his hand and went to beat him that's right he didn't wait until he gets a bachelor's of art or learn how to do well with this thing no no no he just took what was in his hand and started slugging with it so this eliminate the excuse about you know I I read enough you know I have studied enough I have reached that quote in the in the message I read in no no no use what you have use the words use these seeds that planted in your soul and Slug and fight because the devil not waiting the adversary fight is not waiting to say listen I'll wait until you finish school get a degree and a job because I really want you to be positioned in a way that we could be on an equal footing before we could strike and face the battle he not waiting on that you heard the prayer requests from Alex the night he wish he could snuff him out tonight you understand he's not waiting on on if you read the scripture last night no no no no no you need to be empowered you need to be inspired you need to take action tonight don't wait for tomorrow take action tonight when he faced you on the road when you meet him going down by the traffic light wherever you go you have to be able to meet him anywhere any place anytime under any condition you have to be able to to challenge him wherever he is and back him up not just challenge him but conquer and overcome and get the victory come on I said it before but we want to shift to Revival what is Revival thing about this fella come to talk Revival tonight you don't know we just come out a convention and and we're still going through some of the tips and hearing fresh things every time what Revival talk is this you know but there's a message called expectation yeah and in that message it's about Revival and we know it very very familiar paragraph five he said no a minister cannot bring a Revival there's no preacher can bring a Revival he doesn't pack it with him the only thing he can do is just be loyal to God and his word and the Revival listen to this the Revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now Revival isn't adding new members to the church it's Reviving what we've already got to revive means to bring back so a Revival and he went on to say I stood here some years ago for my first time by a large body of water which was Lake Michigan I was about just had been ordained in the Missouri Baptist Church I was about 20 or 21 years old and I went up there and when they had the great Easter Sunrise Service out on the Lakeside and I was acquainted with Paul radar and he was supposed to speak at that meeting and I wanted to visit the Tabernacle while I was in Chicago and it was my first time to see that large body of water Michigan and I went out on Lake Shore Drive and I stood out there a little while and I noticed all of them weaves jumping up and down just splashing around I thought what's it so excited about what's all the excitement and the little waves would start and then run out and be big great big great big waves and bumps into each other and break apart and the form would fly up and it it come back in and and then I see the big waves coming again breaking on the bank like they used to hear but that was something new for me because he's never experienced that before a landlocked seven so I noticed how it would and I said well what it must be that legs having a Revival that must be what it is it's having a big time just jumping up and down I thought that's good that's fine but you know I thought well wonder if it got a lot extra water when it's having a Revival it is it revived because you're pouring a lot of water perhaps it have rain he said I thought that but he said no there isn't one drop more in it right now than if it will perfectly come not one bit it's the same water but just having a Revival jumping up and down I thought well what good does that do come to find out when it's having Revival and jumping up and down like that it washes all the trash out of it up on the shore let me read that one more time come to find out when it's having Revival and jumping up and down like that it washes all the trash out of it up on the shore so that's what the church needs it's a Revival getting all the world and the things of the world washed out so it can look clear be pretty again when it all comes down it's got the same amounts of water but what causes the sea to do that is because there is a wind comes that wind again when the eagle came there was a wind with the water here they say there's a wind that comes begins to blow against the waves blow against the body of water and pick it up well that's what the church needs tonight it's a mighty Russian wind coming down upon it again and Reviving it and getting all the world out and the things of the world out and that way then it starts a Revival and then when it settles down the church is all in condition then to start off to receive spiritual gifts and blessings from God and that's what we want amen oh my my my it's necessary in time again [Music] Nest here in time again in a message as the Eagles Stir It Up her nest in that message paragraph 76. you said my speaking about a lost eaglet he said my he kept looking up looking up and after a while the old mother was searching for him God's not going to leave you know he looking for you when you think you're hiding like Jonah when you think you go in somewhere you're not going anywhere you know he looking for you the mother Eagle not giving up you know looking for you he said he kept looking up looking up and after a while the old mother was searching for him he has she come she swooped down she's seen him oh I'm so glad oh my she screamed darling you're not a chicken you're mine oh I remember when I first heard about the baptism of the Holy Ghost he screamed in my heart it's for you I call you oh you're not a chick in your mind oh he heard that cry what did she say when she come back across again she said not clock clock clock she said Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord that sounded good to him amen that's what he that's what he's he was born for that's why his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world my sheep know my voice when they heard that it's just like honey on a rock for a bear he will lick it all night see coming he knows that there's something you're mine honey you're not a chicken you're an eagle oh that's what it is mama look at them big wings Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I am that I am amen that some good yes what can I do Mama listen to this amen just jump as instructions just jump as high as you can jump and start flopping I'll get you so you gotta do something to cause something to happen you can't just sit down and say mama I'm here I'm here mama said listen jump as high as I can start flopping do something I'm gonna get you right amen hallelujah he made a big jump on the four or five flops and hit right on top of a post right in the middle of an organization she come back across again she said honey you gotta do better than that oh I can't even pick you up yeah you have to fast you have to pray you have to cry out you have to lift your hands you have to stand up you have to do something so I could pick you up I can't cause you to to come to a higher level if you're not doing anything you gotta do something right so it says what we need today is a nester in time what we need today is a power of the Holy Ghost what we need today is Eagle food preaching that Jesus Christ still heals he's the same The Works that I do shall you do also aren't you glad to know tonight that Jehovah has his big wings across here waving his Spirit back and forth the angel of the Lord having his picture taken same Pillar of Fire that was in the wilderness and the the Old Testament now in the last days yesterday today and forever people being healed filled with the Holy Ghost speaking with tongues interpretations power of God coming the Lord drawing now God getting his church together aren't you glad to be in such a thing with God happy amen my I I I don't know where he go much longer or not this seemed like if I take off right now this feels good to me to know that it's the truth it's not a Santa Claus story this is not a Mickey Mouse thing this is the truth of the Living God do you believe it yeah with all your heart do you believe we need a necessary in time do you need need a holy ghost again do you believe we need a fresh pouring out of his Spirit do you believe the church need re-baptize and again do you believe it with all your heart let's start something right now will you are you ready to get under the wind are you ready to do it do you believe amen amen thank you Jesus Blessed Be His Marvelous name I want to shift slightly as we begin to wind down and and and head to the Seal of God because why we want our Revival anyway why you want to boil the trash out why we want to go to a higher level why we want God to sit up the nest why because there are other things for us to do we call to a higher level in the Seal of God paragraph 166 he says no what does ceiling mean ceiling is a sign of completion is that right well did you ever see a real ruler loading the cars and I did some research on this you know it's something else because they sometimes travel long long distances sometimes they go through all sorts of of adversities so it actually says before you fill this car you have to ensure that the sides are sung you have to ensure the flaw is sound the roof must be sound everything must be able to seal inside out it must be solid because as it travels at a pace you want to ensure nothing could become loose nothing could move so he goes on to say he'll go out and he'll set so much here and so much here the inspector comes by he looks in and if this is a little loose he shakes it shakes it shakes because it can't be loose so you shake a little bit and make sure your knuckles it must be solid right so that's what he's shaking does at times it tests the Integrity of The Boxcar you want to ensure you're solid the inspector comes by he looks in and if it's a little loose it shakes nope I won't seal it got to tear it out and do it over again next thing you'll try to load it again he'll get this wrong the inspector come by wrong do it over again do it over as long as it takes to get it right because only Solid box cars move moving forward no loose no shaking nothing out of place everything must be in position I'll be gone do it again and that's what God has been doing with his church for a long time you load up and you go into heaven you're taking everything with you your card games huh every other thing that you can load into the church you're trying to take it with you God just condemns it ain't ready for ceiling but when God sees a man contrite broken Spirit sincere and heart down at the altar God closes the door of the world to him and seals him in there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it lasts until Jesus comes not from one Revival to the other but until the day of your Redemption when that boxcar the door is closed and the government seal is put on it it cannot be opened no more until it reaches its final destination foreign to come forward you know in a message adoption number two this has a close he said the church is supposed to be predestinated onto the adoption of children we are man God can take a man and adopt him in his family now this is the process we're going through so you're accustomed to adversity you're custom to to bondage accustomed to the slavery of the world you're accustomed to what Satan has to offer but God has come to shake you up a little bit to stir you up a little bit to challenge status quo to move you beyond what you're accustomed to to bring it to a higher level and in this case why he said the church is supposed to be predestinated unto the adoption of children that's where you're supposed to be well man God can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something that first try that and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirit this man claims a certain thing try it and see if it's right not accepting any old thing you're not just looking for a new Revolution a new idea something that some interesting no no no you try it and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirit this man claims a certain thing try it and see if it's right if it's as right move right with it then say Lord send us something else keep moving listen keep moving not standing where you are not standing still he wants you to be stood up he wants you to move with a cloud he wants you to keep moving just keep moving why tell every fellow take his place then you're gonna see the Church of God begin to get its place then when the Philistines will go backing up the shorts will go off here will go down faces will be washed cigars will be missing that's right when the church begins to get in its Mighty power when we have an anayas and Sapphire and a few of them yes sir you'll see when that Holy Ghost stands when that Holy Holy Church stands together in his power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God powerful Church standing there in his glory oh that's what he's coming for he's not coming for church friends he's not coming to see you sitting on a Pew and to see you go home and come to church and go back home he's coming for adopted Sons he sent a Vindicated message
