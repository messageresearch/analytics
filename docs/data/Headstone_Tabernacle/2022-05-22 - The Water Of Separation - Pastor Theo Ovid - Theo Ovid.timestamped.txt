[35:19] musicians if you have your bibles i'd
[35:21] like to turn to two portion scriptures
[35:23] numbers chapter 19.
[35:24] we want to read verse 1 to 4 and then
[35:27] verse 9.
[35:28] and we want to read ephesians 5
[35:30] we want to read verse 20 to 27
[35:33] this morning
[35:35] reading from numbers chapter 19 verse 1
[35:38] and the lord speak unto moses and under
[35:41] aransan
[35:43] this
[35:44] is the ordinance of the law which the
[35:46] lord had commanded saying speak unto the
[35:49] chain of israel
[35:51] that they bring thee a red heifer
[35:53] without spot
[35:54] wherein is no blemish
[35:56] and upon which never came yoke
[35:59] and he shall give her
[36:01] unto the elias of the priest
[36:03] that he may bring forth
[36:05] her bring her forth without the camp
[36:07] and one shall slay her before his face
[36:10] and here it is that the priest shall
[36:12] take off her blood with his finger
[36:15] and sprinkle of her blood directly
[36:18] before the tabernacle
[36:20] of the congregation
[36:21] seven times
[36:23] verse nine
[36:25] and a man that is clean
[36:27] shall gather up the ashes of the heifer
[36:30] and lay them up without the camp in a
[36:33] clean place
[36:35] it shall be kept
[36:37] for the congregation of the children of
[36:38] israel for a water of separation
[36:43] it is a purification
[36:45] for sin
[36:47] our next scripture is from ephesians 5
[36:49] reading verse 20
[36:51] given thanks always for all things unto
[36:53] god the father in the name of our lord
[36:55] jesus christ
[36:57] submitting yourselves one to another in
[36:59] the fear of god
[37:00] why you submit yourselves unto your own
[37:02] husbands as unto the lord
[37:04] for the husband is the head of the wife
[37:05] even as christ is that heather church
[37:07] and he's the safe of the body
[37:09] therefore as the church is subject unto
[37:11] christ so let the wise be
[37:14] to their own husbands in everything
[37:16] husband love your wives even as christ
[37:19] also love the church
[37:20] and give himself to it and this is the
[37:23] verse we want to get to that he might
[37:24] sanctify
[37:26] and cleanse it
[37:27] with the washing of the water by the
[37:30] word
[37:31] that he might present it to himself
[37:33] a glorious church not having spot or
[37:36] wrinkle or any such thing that it should
[37:38] be holy without blemish let's pray one
[37:40] more time father we thank you for the
[37:42] scriptures lord and here are believers

[37:51] your minister to every condition here
[37:53] today if there's anybody's sick in our
[37:55] midst heal them anybody baxter didn't
[37:57] restore them anybody in bondage and

[49:25] amen
[49:27] to be separated is to be another right
[49:29] unto the lord like samson was he was

[49:37] he says that total separation
[49:39] total
[49:40] we're not to go back into the world no
[49:42] more

[49:44] but cleave only unto god
[49:46] jesus is coming for a bride a woman a
[49:48] church that is separated from the things
[49:50] of the world
[49:52] or the cares of the world she's separate
[49:54] from the fashions of this modern age we
[49:55] live in she separated from the cares
[49:58] and the traditions of churches she's
[50:01] separated only to god and god is the
[50:03] word and as husband and wife is one so
[50:06] does the bride and the word becomes one
[50:08] for the world is living through the
[50:10] bride
[50:11] that's the credentials that's the
[50:13] identification
[50:14] if the police stop here and said drivers
[50:17] permit please they want to see if you
[50:18] are the person driving that car your
[50:20] identification and so on but the bright
[50:22] identification is the word living
[50:24] not not who your pastor is
[50:27] not where you go to church
[50:28] the bride's identification where the
[50:30] police stop you every step here you pull
[50:31] out you would live in
[50:33] get behind me satan

[50:48] was no place for him or wrong and he
[50:50] fell on the earth the earth door
[50:52] belonged to no devil the earth belonged

[56:47] and prepare a place for you take you out
[56:49] of this pest house and deliver you into
[56:51] my father's house so this house you're
[56:53] putting up on different things it's a
[56:54] pest house you might not find it so no
[56:56] because they're young but put 50 years
[56:58] on that you will see you're talking
[56:59] about all right so what she said now
[57:01] he's going to repay a place a perfect
[57:03] place where no evil exists no sickness
[57:05] exists no old age exists no debt exists
[57:08] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[57:10] perfection amen and you have to be
[57:12] perfect to get there
[57:14] the bible says so jesus said be there
[57:15] for perfect even as your father and him
[57:17] is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it
[57:19] must be perfect people come because you
[57:21] have to be stand and marry to a perfect
[57:23] son of god you must be a perfect brain
[57:26] so how can you do it to anything else
[57:29] but the perfect word of god
[57:31] which is the waters of separation
[57:34] that watches us from our sins
[57:37] so you're not trying to be perfect in
[57:38] yourself perfect shoes perfect type of
[57:41] facebook no no this is not that
[57:43] perfection doesn't lie within us
[57:45] perfection is in christ jesus
[57:47] and that is why a message like this this
[57:49] morning is so very important for you to
[57:51] catch it and catch it by revelation
[57:53] because you don't have perfection
[57:55] perfection is not in you you can access
[57:57] that
[57:57] god has to release that and he has done
[58:00] so
[58:01] by his word
[58:02] and all he comes for you to receive the
[58:04] word and be washed by it you can be
[58:07] watched by psychology you can't watch
[58:09] all these characters
[58:10] hallelujah all joel olsen but god have
[58:13] mercy
[58:14] god is a good god i am strong i am good
[58:18] i am highly favored that's not god's
[58:20] plan that's foolishness
[58:22] that is really making inspired sinners
[58:24] because the people sitting down here in
[58:26] that is not saved
[58:27] we are not here to be inspired in our
[58:29] condition we're here to be delivered
[58:32] that's what salvation really is
[58:34] praise god deliverance
[58:36] oh glory to god so you can't be
[58:37] listening to all kind of foolishness you
[58:39] have to hear the word
[58:40] because the word is what gave the water
[58:42] hey
[58:43] the waters have separated to wash you
[58:46] glory to god hallelujah amen
[58:49] amen
[58:50] let somebody say amen
[58:52] so you have to hear the word the
[58:54] scriptures the bible the message of the
[58:56] hour
[58:57] let's continue he washes us from our
[58:59] sins isn't it right the blood of jesus
[59:01] think of it dripping bloody word amen
[59:03] the word of god bleeding blood to wash
[59:06] the bride
[59:07] she stands perfect
[59:09] virgin unadulterated she never sinned
[59:11] friends
[59:12] there are so many things that we could
[59:13] say tonight about perfection
[59:15] we are always trying to gorge the eyes
[59:18] out of somebody else to make ourselves
[59:21] just a little holier than they are
[59:24] but if we only look at the picture
[59:26] it's only god's grace
[59:28] that we are
[59:30] what we are
[59:31] and if there is anything that i can do
[59:34] to make myself perfect in the presence
[59:36] of god then christ did not have to die
[59:38] for me
[59:39] if there is one thing that you can do
[59:41] that would merit anything in the
[59:42] presence of god then christ died in vain
[59:45] no law keeping
[59:47] no legalistic ideas of yours
[59:49] none of your own holiness
[59:51] no things that you could quit doing
[59:54] quit lying quit stealing quit smoking
[59:57] tobacco quit going to picture shows you
[59:59] are still lost
[1:00:03] nothing can do it joining churches
[1:00:06] rituals ceremonies baptisms orders of
[1:00:08] church reading of creeds saying her
[1:00:10] prayers all those things could come
[1:00:11] nothing you are lost not one thing you
[1:00:13] could do in yourself
[1:00:15] you are a sinner under condemnation and
[1:00:18] there is no way within yourself or any
[1:00:20] creed or anything that you could do or
[1:00:21] think of yourself that can merit wanting
[1:00:23] in the presence of god because you are
[1:00:26] sinner to start with a lot of people
[1:00:28] don't understand that they are sinners
[1:00:29] to start with they commented the message
[1:00:31] and they got injection in their head
[1:00:33] and they believe their son and this and
[1:00:34] that you are kind of crazy and they
[1:00:35] still sound is that broken so you know
[1:00:37] people just go to hell too you know
[1:00:39] it doesn't preach much but people go to
[1:00:40] hell you know you understand what i'm
[1:00:42] saying nice people you know good people
[1:00:44] you know hallelujah is not going to
[1:00:46] heaven by your goodness you know you're
[1:00:48] going to heaven by your blood
[1:00:50] jesus died to save you
[1:00:52] oh glory to god you're needed for your
[1:00:54] children so you can sit back for
[1:00:56] yourself immediately for your family
[1:00:57] blood
[1:00:58] oh glory to god isn't that right
[1:01:01] god require perfection we want to be
[1:01:03] that in mind and there's nothing just
[1:01:05] part we can go into the presence of god
[1:01:07] it must be perfect our worship
[1:01:09] everything what is it god requires
[1:01:11] perfection he requires your repentance
[1:01:14] he requires your loyalty to him but he's
[1:01:17] looking tonight no matter here we go are
[1:01:18] you ready no matter how much you have
[1:01:20] sinned
[1:01:21] how little or how much you are still a
[1:01:23] sinner
[1:01:25] and cannot get in no other way but by
[1:01:27] jesus christ
[1:01:28] called all sufficient sacrifice and in
[1:01:30] him you're perfected forever
[1:01:32] think of it it's nothing you do
[1:01:35] it is not
[1:01:37] new pages you turn
[1:01:38] it is not a new life you start
[1:01:41] it's a confession of your wrong
[1:01:44] and god's grace to you
[1:01:46] that brings you to perfection
[1:01:48] then you are perfected in jesus christ
[1:01:51] why stake a substitute why try to get
[1:01:54] back by your church why try to come in
[1:01:56] because you quit drinking or quit lying
[1:01:58] come by the way of perfection for by one
[1:02:01] sacrifice he has perfected for
[1:02:03] everything that are sanctified how do i
[1:02:05] get sanctified confess your sins in the
[1:02:07] presence of the blood of jesus and the
[1:02:09] light that come from the blood comes
[1:02:11] into the worshipper
[1:02:12] and sanctifies him from the desire of
[1:02:14] the things of the world
[1:02:15] now there is no condemnation to them
[1:02:17] that are in christ jesus the devil walk
[1:02:19] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:02:22] so for you to walk after the spirit you
[1:02:24] have to get the word of the spirit
[1:02:26] because you don't know god's will
[1:02:27] you don't know god's plan and program
[1:02:29] and when israel came out of egypt they
[1:02:31] didn't know who god was the only he and
[1:02:33] moses see and flies and freeze and flock
[1:02:36] god said bring them to this mountain i
[1:02:37] wanted to tell them more of myself he
[1:02:39] wanted to give them his word
[1:02:41] before moses couldn't come down the
[1:02:42] camera a bunch of foolishness then
[1:02:44] parting and fetting have their own
[1:02:45] carnival isn't that right because only
[1:02:48] flesh put something down there but they
[1:02:49] all came out
[1:02:51] and i want to see it in type of
[1:02:52] reference all came out into this message
[1:02:54] and there's a bunch of mixed multitudes
[1:02:56] come out
[1:02:57] so not all come out as bright
[1:02:59] people come out but they have to have to
[1:03:01] come out and go in
[1:03:03] it's not coming out is a little more
[1:03:05] than coming out you come out here church
[1:03:07] your baptist methodist whatever it is
[1:03:08] but you have to go in now
[1:03:10] to just land the promise
[1:03:12] praise god and i'm read this scripture
[1:03:14] we read this morning
[1:03:15] about this ordinance about getting this
[1:03:17] heifer
[1:03:19] a specific detailed a red heifer
[1:03:23] not any heifer
[1:03:24] a red heifer isn't that right no yoke
[1:03:27] upon that heifer
[1:03:28] hallelujah praise god isn't that right
[1:03:31] and after it is killed the priests have
[1:03:33] to take it the blood and sprinkles seven
[1:03:35] times
[1:03:36] oh glory to god then a man that is clean
[1:03:38] how to take up the ashes and lay them
[1:03:40] without the camp in a clean place and
[1:03:43] they shall be kept for the congregation
[1:03:45] of israel for water of separation and he
[1:03:48] preached a message started a world of
[1:03:49] separation and he was talking about in
[1:03:51] the old testament they had to get this
[1:03:52] water of separation and always you have
[1:03:55] to have debt before you can have life
[1:03:57] life come by debt
[1:03:59] so he's showing that this life that was
[1:04:01] to come by the water separation our
[1:04:03] animal had to die
[1:04:05] which was the heifer isn't that right
[1:04:06] in the resurrection that's why i get it
[1:04:08] thought from that that did to you will
[1:04:10] not be allowed in resurrection
[1:04:12] god grow you up to be young strong man
[1:04:14] and woman then death come and take you
[1:04:16] out all that dead to you wither you down
[1:04:19] it will never have no effect in the
[1:04:20] resurrection
[1:04:22] because you only resurrected what you
[1:04:23] was at perfection
[1:04:25] oh that's a wonderful thing
[1:04:27] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:04:29] notice
[1:04:30] you're talking about okay we know we
[1:04:32] live by dead things right by the chicken
[1:04:34] by the whatever it is have to die for us
[1:04:37] to live okay he said no you've got to
[1:04:39] die not only that but you've got to die
[1:04:40] to yourself you've got to die to every
[1:04:42] thought of the flesh so you can receive
[1:04:44] the mind of christ and walk from
[1:04:45] henceforth not your own but his mind the
[1:04:48] mind of christ being in you he was
[1:04:50] tempted jesus was by his appetite he
[1:04:52] said men shall never let alone but by
[1:04:54] every will out of the mouth of god
[1:04:56] because a physical man hasn't lived by
[1:04:58] bread so does the spiritual man have to
[1:05:00] live by the spirit
[1:05:01] before this physical man can eat bread
[1:05:03] wheat has to die barley corn and whatnot
[1:05:06] isn't that right so therefore the
[1:05:08] congregation brought the heifer for the
[1:05:10] sacrifice for the killing and the
[1:05:12] congregation bought jesus the cavalry
[1:05:14] which was a type and they condemned him
[1:05:16] and brought him the calvary that he
[1:05:17] could slay him notice he must be killed
[1:05:20] in the sight of elias and the company
[1:05:21] and christ was killing the prisoners of
[1:05:23] the high priest and all the company of
[1:05:25] israel notice that they died the heifer
[1:05:28] died the renova was killed they were
[1:05:30] taking a blood on the fingers of the
[1:05:31] high priest and walked before the
[1:05:33] congregation before the doors of the
[1:05:34] congregation and struck it seven times
[1:05:37] seven times with blood as a public
[1:05:39] testimony to the public
[1:05:40] seven different times it was struck
[1:05:42] there showing it would be seven
[1:05:43] different dispensations that the blood
[1:05:45] of jesus christ is still a public
[1:05:47] testimony oh glory seventeen changes
[1:05:50] sprinkle blood seven times oh glory to
[1:05:52] god and when you come to the waters of
[1:05:54] separation there are seven drops of
[1:05:55] blood to be sprinkled upon you to take
[1:05:58] it to the next step which is the
[1:06:00] kind of glory
[1:06:01] where you can have true fellowship with
[1:06:03] your lord and master after the heaven
[1:06:06] was burned which is a brass altar
[1:06:08] speaking about divine judgment and there
[1:06:09] was to be made a water separation that
[1:06:11] was to put cedar wood scarlet wood and
[1:06:14] hyssop speaking of the cross and the
[1:06:16] hyssop meaning christ on the cross and
[1:06:18] somewhere the prophet was talking about
[1:06:19] that lintel and the post was to form a
[1:06:22] cross i didn't never even saw that
[1:06:23] before when i said when i see the blood
[1:06:25] i'm going to pass to you it wasn't just
[1:06:27] over you know the lintel under post
[1:06:29] hallelujah was forming a cross in every
[1:06:31] house but when i see the blood i'm going
[1:06:33] to pass over you oh glory to god
[1:06:36] hallelujah praise god now want you to
[1:06:38] notice quickly this his subset and so
[1:06:40] forth was thrown in with the red heifer
[1:06:42] was burned and made a water separation
[1:06:45] when an unclean person that had defiled
[1:06:47] had to come through the water separation
[1:06:49] would separate them from their
[1:06:51] uncleanness and made them
[1:06:53] holy
[1:06:54] to enter into fellowship again with the
[1:06:57] rest of the
[1:06:58] congregation oh i see
[1:07:01] what a beautiful picture that separation
[1:07:03] the word of separation separated guilty
[1:07:06] made them holy and brought them back
[1:07:08] into fellowship again notice
[1:07:10] the water of separation was the type of
[1:07:12] the word of god
[1:07:13] and then he tied in with the next
[1:07:15] scripture we read ephesians he said over
[1:07:18] ephesians the fifth chapter that he
[1:07:20] might sanctify
[1:07:22] and cleanse us with the washing of the
[1:07:24] water
[1:07:25] by the word
[1:07:27] so when you really take the word it have
[1:07:28] an effect upon you
[1:07:30] a washing effect
[1:07:31] a cleansing effect a purification effect
[1:07:35] when you accept it
[1:07:37] if you don't accept it it's just a mind
[1:07:39] thing you come and you hear stuff but
[1:07:42] it's not really effectively applied
[1:07:44] to you
[1:07:45] are you ready
[1:07:47] the separation of the water separation
[1:07:48] separates you from sin
[1:07:50] if you are wary apply the water of the
[1:07:52] word if you are sick apply the water of
[1:07:54] the word for it separated some sickness
[1:07:57] it separated some sin it separated some
[1:07:59] weary oh my talk about weary that friday
[1:08:02] exhortation i was so tired

[1:19:28] oh hallelujah hallelujah before my wife

[1:19:36] range dress covering the knees and no
[1:19:38] earrings and cleaned face and whatever
[1:19:40] she just loved the principles that was
[1:19:42] behind it
[1:19:46] then she found out about the word
[1:19:49] that god come and take us out of
[1:19:50] catholic and methodist and baptist and
[1:19:52] bring us the deliverance and shine light
[1:19:53] upon the on the word so we are no longer
[1:19:56] methodist or baptist we are sons of god
[1:19:58] and daughters of god we are no longer
[1:20:01] sinners
[1:20:02] but we are saints
[1:20:04] in the catholic church you have to die
[1:20:05] to be our saint but this is living
[1:20:07] saints now
[1:20:08] and means sanctified
[1:20:10] by the waters of separation
[1:20:12] by the blood sanctified by the washing
[1:20:15] of the water of the world
[1:20:17] hallelujah
[1:20:18] they sanctified you will talk to your
[1:20:20] son you will talk to your daughter and
[1:20:21] tell them what is right you wouldn't
[1:20:23] leave them onto their own devices
[1:20:25] as long as they're under your roof you
[1:20:27] will tell them the truth because only
[1:20:29] the truth going to set them free
[1:20:31] when they're on their own they're on
[1:20:32] their own but once they're under your
[1:20:34] roof they have to hear truth
[1:20:37] oh glory to god they have to hear what
[1:20:38] is principles and what is right oh
[1:20:41] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:20:42] separatism and sins of the world nothing
[1:20:44] we could do we were dead in ceiling
[1:20:46] trespasses without hope without god in
[1:20:48] the world aliens had cut off going to
[1:20:50] the devil's hell in a sinner's grave and
[1:20:53] in due season christ died for us
[1:20:55] producing and giving us the waters of
[1:20:57] separation
[1:20:58] and god by his grace call us to his
[1:21:00] waters
[1:21:01] separating it from sins and brought us
[1:21:03] unto himself a peculiar people a holy
[1:21:06] nation a royal priesthood offer him
[1:21:08] spiritual sacrifices
[1:21:10] oh my hallelujah so under the old
[1:21:13] testament when the blood was put in the
[1:21:15] little of the door it was put with a
[1:21:16] hyssop bush see that can be hewed out
[1:21:19] separated chips away from it but hyssop
[1:21:21] was not separate at any time they took
[1:21:24] and dipped the blood in it so he was
[1:21:25] showing you why hyssop was part of this
[1:21:28] mixture to make the water of separation
[1:21:31] it wasn't any anything you know it was
[1:21:33] the heifer it was the cedar was the
[1:21:35] hyssop all that come together he's
[1:21:37] typing it back they took his stuff to
[1:21:39] dip the blood and hyssop was something
[1:21:41] you find anywhere and he called up
[1:21:43] common weeds it was common faith
[1:21:45] no fancy faith just common faith
[1:21:47] god i'm applying your word today i am
[1:21:50] taking what is spoken from the pulpit as
[1:21:52] your word and apply it to my heart and
[1:21:54] i'm expecting a change in my life and my
[1:21:56] walk and talk oh glory to god so after
[1:22:00] being dipped praise god sprinkle bone
[1:22:03] with this water of separation he said
[1:22:04] then a believer coming now that's out of
[1:22:07] fellowship
[1:22:08] away from god are we from the mean
[1:22:10] fellowship what does he do he comes to
[1:22:12] the outer court first into this clean
[1:22:14] place where the water of separation was
[1:22:16] waiting for him a type of the church
[1:22:18] today and the waters of separation today
[1:22:21] is the word
[1:22:22] isn't that right and the preaching of
[1:22:24] the word is
[1:22:26] the water
[1:22:27] of separation
[1:22:29] now listen we know according to hebrews
[1:22:32] that all heard the word under moses but
[1:22:34] some didn't have the word mixed with
[1:22:35] faith
[1:22:36] so they perish so only those with real
[1:22:39] faith
[1:22:40] get that mixture or get that application
[1:22:43] of the word to their lives
[1:22:45] so even though the word is being
[1:22:46] preached not everybody receiving it as
[1:22:48] the word
[1:22:49] people here there's a thought because
[1:22:51] maybe what you're trying to say this
[1:22:52] morning and you know we're trying to say
[1:22:53] this you should say something some
[1:22:55] people say are you saying something to
[1:22:56] me and they can train words for them you
[1:22:58] see they're not taking it as the word
[1:23:00] from god
[1:23:01] you see if you take it as a word from
[1:23:02] god it doesn't matter who we've fallen
[1:23:04] it's for all of us
[1:23:06] it's not right none righteous no not one
[1:23:08] it's not this one better than this one
[1:23:10] you know if i was not a minister and a
[1:23:12] preacher or called to do this thing i'll
[1:23:13] be shouting down there
[1:23:17] i don't have to be a minister to shout
[1:23:18] you know i just shout anyway i just
[1:23:20] praise god anyhow you know oh glory to
[1:23:23] god i don't have to be a minister to be
[1:23:24] a christian you know ministry doesn't
[1:23:26] make me a christian you know i was a
[1:23:27] christian before i become a preacher
[1:23:29] but give the lord some praises
[1:23:31] you don't have to have a position to be
[1:23:33] a dick no usher or somebody to be a
[1:23:35] christian you know you'll be a christian
[1:23:36] because you have christ in you you have
[1:23:38] the spirit of god upon your life that
[1:23:40] will make you a christian you know you
[1:23:42] must have your officer in the church
[1:23:43] officer doesn't mean nothing if you have
[1:23:45] christianity inside of you you're just a
[1:23:47] man walking there in some pose operating
[1:23:49] but you still need christ you still need
[1:23:51] blood you're still in the water of
[1:23:53] separation you see me they're cleansing
[1:23:55] we need cleansing every day it's not
[1:23:57] just sunday new cleansing everyday
[1:23:58] cleansing every day it's more it's me oh
[1:24:01] glory to give the lord a praise
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:08] i went by hard way with muslims and so
[1:24:10] on i tell my brother i'm going to pray
[1:24:13] you say your name is pray five times a
[1:24:14] day
[1:24:15] you know i cannot forget that
[1:24:17] i almost wonder if they preach on that
[1:24:18] yeah
[1:24:20] if they could play five times how many
[1:24:21] times you pray
[1:24:23] because they pray in fact they and they
[1:24:24] still have their business running
[1:24:26] fight time a day and god bless them they
[1:24:28] seem good blessing them three five times
[1:24:29] a day what if you started three five
[1:24:31] times a day
[1:24:32] that doesn't make you a muslim
[1:24:34] would that make me an inspired christian
[1:24:37] could the devil whispering in your ear
[1:24:39] don't pray
[1:24:40] don't call do ask
[1:24:42] especially when you do something wrong
[1:24:43] you know he said didn't you go up in
[1:24:45] here you know
[1:24:46] are you saying that because you never
[1:24:47] catch me that yes
[1:24:49] in the early christian experience he
[1:24:50] said god really you know
[1:24:52] afterwards i think about it i think i
[1:24:54] was going to think about doing anything
[1:24:54] about it say god i'm coming to you
[1:24:57] [Music]
[1:24:59] after that devil come and tell me god
[1:25:00] wouldn't hear me if i repent god must
[1:25:02] hear me
[1:25:04] you hear what i said
[1:25:05] if i repent if you repent god must hear
[1:25:07] you yeah repentance sinner here
[1:25:09] repentance soul hear somebody you want
[1:25:11] to get this right you want somebody want
[1:25:13] to make it right god will hear you
[1:25:15] i am the high and lofty one with him
[1:25:17] that is of a contrite heart and a broken
[1:25:20] spirit or give the lord some praises
[1:25:23] oh glory to god
[1:25:24] hallelujah me see i could hit the home
[1:25:26] stretch here wow
[1:25:28] he said now watch that's the matter with
[1:25:29] people today you come to church the
[1:25:31] water separation hear the word that's
[1:25:32] good you get separated from your sin but
[1:25:34] you go out with an intellectual fate
[1:25:36] that's the reason you can't believe
[1:25:38] that's the reason you go back out and
[1:25:40] sin the way you do the reason you can't
[1:25:42] hold it from one revival to another if
[1:25:44] you let that intellectual fit move down
[1:25:46] to your brains into your heart
[1:25:48] then it becomes a reality with a new bit
[1:25:51] did you hear how he said that
[1:25:52] if you let that faith move from your
[1:25:54] brain into your heart
[1:25:56] then
[1:25:57] it becomes a reality with a newborn it
[1:25:59] will stay there anchored forever god
[1:26:01] sealed you in by the holy spirit it set
[1:26:04] this forever get away from the
[1:26:05] intellectual faith intellectual fear is
[1:26:07] all right but as far as nominal
[1:26:09] christian goes he hears the word he
[1:26:11] believes he has another conception of it
[1:26:13] that's fine we believe that but notice
[1:26:15] when the man come to the waters of
[1:26:17] separation which was word feet come by
[1:26:19] hearing carrying the word we believe god
[1:26:21] wants us to believe it that's part of it
[1:26:22] that's so far as he ever gets he never
[1:26:25] gets into fellowship yonder he just come
[1:26:27] through the water of separation and when
[1:26:29] he comes to that part he finds a mental
[1:26:31] conception yes i believe it thinks it's
[1:26:33] in his mind raise up his hands accept it
[1:26:36] and 20 days from there he's back in the
[1:26:37] same marat he was in the first place
[1:26:39] because he never went any further than
[1:26:41] his head
[1:26:42] why do we set and linger knowing that
[1:26:44] someday we got to stand in his presence
[1:26:46] this very night our heart makers
[1:26:49] may make his last beat our soulmate
[1:26:51] takes this journey and we don't have to
[1:26:53] be judged we already judge when god said
[1:26:55] in the garden even the day you eat
[1:26:56] thereof that day you die
[1:26:58] so the word that christ died in your
[1:27:00] stead was made
[1:27:02] waters of separation for you
[1:27:05] was made a blood of cleansing for you
[1:27:08] was made a seal to seal you by the holy
[1:27:12] spirit
[1:27:13] but you'll be recognized in the presence
[1:27:15] of god when you walk over the top of it
[1:27:17] and feel or refuse it or fail refuse it
[1:27:20] to receive it then you are judge
[1:27:22] yourself a sinner
[1:27:23] now he said the heaven was killed in the
[1:27:25] evening time before the congregation
[1:27:28] isn't that right praise the name of the
[1:27:30] lord blessed be the middle and the god
[1:27:33] only meets today in one place that's in
[1:27:35] christ jesus and he is the word the
[1:27:36] water of separation and this blood was
[1:27:38] shed for all seven church ages and by
[1:27:40] the holy spirit we enter into fellowship
[1:27:42] which is over given to the church oh
[1:27:44] blessed be the name of the lord the
[1:27:46] church will judge you here whether
[1:27:48] you're a good member or not they will
[1:27:49] give you a good funeral a half-mast the
[1:27:51] flag of your debt send great wreaths of
[1:27:53] flowers and do everything for you when
[1:27:55] it comes down to your soul face in god
[1:27:57] it's got to have it in your life
[1:28:00] hallelujah praise god
[1:28:02] so first john 1
[1:28:05] says
[1:28:06] that which was in the beginning
[1:28:08] which we have heard
[1:28:10] which we have seen with our eyes which
[1:28:12] we have looked upon our hands have
[1:28:13] handled of the word of life for the life
[1:28:16] was manifested and we seen it
[1:28:19] and be a witness and showed unto you
[1:28:22] that eternal life which was with the
[1:28:23] father was manifested unto us that's
[1:28:26] which we have seen on her declare we
[1:28:27] unto you that we may also have
[1:28:29] fellowship with us and truly our
[1:28:31] fellowship is with the father and his
[1:28:33] son jesus christ
[1:28:35] i write these things unto you that your
[1:28:38] joy
[1:28:39] might be full
[1:28:40] so we're gonna get something on his joy
[1:28:42] team because i'm disturbed now with
[1:28:43] people who are really not
[1:28:45] having the joy
[1:28:46] in their hearts and life
[1:28:48] they're dissatisfied they're not even
[1:28:50] content with what god blessed them with
[1:28:52] actually
[1:28:53] as i spoke some time ago god promised to
[1:28:55] meet you need not agreed
[1:28:57] actually the lust that is leading them
[1:29:00] see
[1:29:01] because the devil moves the goal post of
[1:29:03] happiness and success
[1:29:05] they will tell you when you get this
[1:29:06] you'll be happy when you get it you're
[1:29:08] still unhappy you shift it to something
[1:29:09] else you keep shifting it
[1:29:11] somebody i was saying yesterday at the
[1:29:14] service my sister judy you get a
[1:29:15] thousand dollars and you won 10.
[1:29:17] because when they get that doesn't mean
[1:29:18] happy when they get 10 you'll be happy
[1:29:19] when they study somebody have a hundred
[1:29:21] thousand you know i mean you try to get
[1:29:23] worried no you're not so happy or when
[1:29:24] he had a hundred thousand dollars no you
[1:29:26] have to be placed night because you know
[1:29:26] somebody every million and when they
[1:29:28] have a million no you can't sleep
[1:29:30] because somebody have 10 million dollars
[1:29:32] so you see did you ever keep shifting
[1:29:33] things around
[1:29:35] see but if you have to be happy is now
[1:29:40] happiness can be based upon external
[1:29:42] things whether you get a new shoe suit
[1:29:44] or even this suit you have on your back
[1:29:45] for your last ten services
[1:29:47] that's fine come with that same suit
[1:29:50] either somebody help you with a new suit
[1:29:51] or they just laugh
[1:29:53] leave them alone but you come as you are
[1:29:56] because you have to be happy no i want
[1:29:57] to be a happy christian right now
[1:29:59] i had to wait after service to be happy
[1:30:02] wait for some kind of thing wait for
[1:30:03] somebody to shake my hand
[1:30:05] you were shaking my hand go take away my
[1:30:06] joy you on your own
[1:30:09] praise god i will never allow another
[1:30:10] human being to be
[1:30:12] responsible for my joy
[1:30:15] this joy i have
[1:30:17] you want to take it away
[1:30:18] oh glory god don't don't let no other
[1:30:20] human being be responsible for your
[1:30:22] happiness
[1:30:23] if they didn't talk to me so if they
[1:30:25] didn't say this if they didn't do this
[1:30:27] then then then then excuses
[1:30:30] let the joy be the joy of god in your
[1:30:32] life
[1:30:33] let it be no hallelujah praise god when
[1:30:36] somebody asks you are you happy you
[1:30:37] should be saying yes i am happy
[1:30:39] jesus made me happy you put something in
[1:30:41] my soul

[1:30:53] own self oh glory to god and somebody
[1:30:56] else don't have half of what you have
[1:30:58] and they're happy and the bells and them
[1:31:00] ringing the joint belt singing the birch
[1:31:02] singing oh glory to god i want to be a
[1:31:05] happy man worship and praise and god
[1:31:08] hallelujah i'm talking about a story
[1:31:10] about a colored man in slavery he went
[1:31:12] to a service and he got saved and he
[1:31:14] come back and say jesus set me free i am
[1:31:17] free i am free and all the mother slave
[1:31:19] watching this old man talking
[1:31:22] about i am free and the master came out
[1:31:24] and said i hear you're talking about
[1:31:25] freedom there he said yes master
[1:31:27] hallelujah winter service and jesus came
[1:31:30] and set me free oh glory to god i am
[1:31:32] free and the master say if you love him
[1:31:34] with all your heart mind and soul i will
[1:31:36] set you free and the master went and
[1:31:38] signed the papers if jesus could set you
[1:31:39] free i have to set you free oh give the
[1:31:42] lord some praises how many want to be
[1:31:44] free this morning god want to be free oh
[1:31:47] glory to god and who the son of man set
[1:31:49] free
[1:31:49] he is free indeed glory to god god won't
[1:31:52] you have the liberty to save him and to
[1:31:54] love him not trying to escape hell oh
[1:31:56] glory to god he brought me under murray
[1:31:58] clay he set my feet on a rock to stay
[1:32:01] oh my hallelujah praise god
[1:32:05] there we go
[1:32:06] watch this thing directing to you that
[1:32:08] your drama before
[1:32:10] this then is the message which we have
[1:32:12] heard of him
[1:32:13] he's always seen him we handle him
[1:32:15] watch and declare unto you that god is
[1:32:18] light
[1:32:19] god is what
[1:32:20] and in him is no darkness at all
[1:32:23] are you ready now
[1:32:24] if we say we are fellowship with him
[1:32:28] and walk in darkness
[1:32:30] we lie
[1:32:31] and do not the truth
[1:32:33] but if we walk in the light
[1:32:35] as he is in the light
[1:32:37] we have
[1:32:39] fellowship
[1:32:40] one with another
[1:32:42] and the blood of jesus christ
[1:32:45] his son
[1:32:46] cleanses us
[1:32:47] from all sin
[1:32:49] so the only reason why we can't have
[1:32:51] fellowship is because something wrong
[1:32:55] somebody not walking in the light
[1:32:57] because if we walk in the light
[1:32:59] as he is in the light then we are
[1:33:01] fellowship
[1:33:03] one with another
[1:33:04] we don't even have to be in the same
[1:33:06] church we don't even have to believe the
[1:33:08] same thing but we are walking in the
[1:33:10] light
[1:33:11] the light as what has been revealed to
[1:33:13] us
[1:33:14] and that light say love your brother
[1:33:17] oh give the lord a praise offering
[1:33:19] love your sister
[1:33:21] come on now that's what the lights say
[1:33:23] isn't that right
[1:33:25] here we go
[1:33:26] if we say
[1:33:28] we have no sin
[1:33:31] we deceive ourselves
[1:33:32] the devil is evil
[1:33:35] this is because self-deception
[1:33:37] you deceive yourself so the devil will
[1:33:39] leave you alone
[1:33:41] because you see them fix up already
[1:33:43] i hit them a virus there already and
[1:33:45] they just have the day
[1:33:48] they chin up on the boundaries them chin
[1:33:50] up he said if we say we have no sin we
[1:33:53] deceive ourselves
[1:33:54] and the truth is not in us
[1:33:56] but if we confess our sins
[1:33:58] he is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:34:01] all sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:34:03] unrighteousness if we say we have not
[1:34:05] sinned we make him a liar
[1:34:09] and his word is nothing else
[1:34:11] so if you understand this how come he's
[1:34:13] judging this one and that one
[1:34:15] how come you're writing off this one and
[1:34:17] that one
[1:34:18] hallelujah
[1:34:20] let's hear it amplified from verse five
[1:34:22] this is a message the message of promise
[1:34:24] which you have heard from him are now
[1:34:26] reporting to you god is light there's no
[1:34:28] darkness in him at all no not in any way
[1:34:31] so if we are partakers together and
[1:34:33] enjoy fellowship with him when we live
[1:34:35] and move and are walking about in
[1:34:37] darkness we are speaking falsely and do
[1:34:40] not live and practice the truth which
[1:34:42] the gospel presents
[1:34:43] if we really are living and walking in
[1:34:45] the light as he himself is in the light
[1:34:47] we have true unbroken fellowship with
[1:34:50] one another
[1:34:51] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:34:52] cleanses and removes us from all sin and
[1:34:55] guilt and keep us cleansed from sin in
[1:34:58] all forms and manifestations
[1:35:01] if we say we have no sin refusing to
[1:35:03] admit that we are sinners
[1:35:07] we delude and lead ourselves astray
[1:35:10] and the truth which the gospel presents
[1:35:12] is not in us
[1:35:13] does not dwell in our hearts
[1:35:15] if we freely admit that we have sinned
[1:35:18] and confessed our sins he is faithful
[1:35:21] and just true to his own nature and
[1:35:23] promises and will forgive our sins
[1:35:25] dismiss our lawlessness and continuously
[1:35:29] cleanse us i like that word continuously
[1:35:32] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:35:34] everything not in conformity to his will
[1:35:37] in purpose thought and action
[1:35:40] if we scream that we have not sinned we
[1:35:42] contradict his word and make him out to
[1:35:45] be false and a liar his word is not in
[1:35:47] us and the divine messenger of the
[1:35:49] gospel is not in our hearts let's
[1:35:51] continue quickly now
[1:35:53] i have a lot of stuff here you'll
[1:35:54] forgive me you know
[1:35:55] when this talk came to me i didn't know
[1:35:57] how to approach it
[1:35:59] so i just trust the lord to help fit
[1:36:01] this whole thing together that you can
[1:36:03] leave here understanding the effect of
[1:36:05] this water this wood coming to you
[1:36:07] watch this here now so notice when a man
[1:36:10] come back justification
[1:36:12] right for justification he comes to the
[1:36:13] water of separation the man live in
[1:36:15] adultery the woman is not living right
[1:36:17] the boy's girl is not even right they
[1:36:19] come to the courts through the preaching
[1:36:20] of the word
[1:36:21] then true they are washed by the waters
[1:36:23] of the word hearing the word they
[1:36:25] receive intellectual fate
[1:36:27] intellectual faith that's just about as
[1:36:28] far as half the church gets intellectual
[1:36:31] freedoms i believe but wait there's more
[1:36:33] to it yet before redemption is completed
[1:36:36] you have to go to something else
[1:36:38] so now in the courts but the next thing
[1:36:40] is to enter into the fellowship with the
[1:36:42] believers on common grounds
[1:36:45] now after believers hearing the word
[1:36:47] then they get sprinkled blood on the
[1:36:49] door seven stripes of blood we're
[1:36:51] talking about seven churches and so on
[1:36:53] he said now they had to come to the
[1:36:55] tabernacle and the tabernacle
[1:36:56] represented christ for in the temple the
[1:36:59] lamb was slain the blood was shed the
[1:37:01] only in the basis of the shed blood will
[1:37:04] god made the believer all your dry-cut
[1:37:07] theology will never please god till you
[1:37:09] come into the blood of jesus christ he
[1:37:11] said pretty strong only in the blood is
[1:37:13] fellowship
[1:37:14] i want you to repeat after me only in
[1:37:16] the blood
[1:37:18] is the fellowship
[1:37:20] say it again only in the blood
[1:37:23] is the fellowship
[1:37:25] watch something now they try to bring
[1:37:26] people together by
[1:37:28] doctrine
[1:37:29] by theology by christianity it has
[1:37:31] failed
[1:37:33] it will continue to feel because man
[1:37:35] bring them doctrines
[1:37:37] but you see the blood
[1:37:40] when that blood cleanses you
[1:37:42] that have nothing with doctrine you know
[1:37:44] god free you
[1:37:46] what doctrine not to do with anything
[1:37:48] god free you god free me both of us free
[1:37:51] glory to god

[1:38:16] but there were some young strong men
[1:38:18] that climbed to the top of the mountain

[1:53:21] the gospel and beat the goal he said
[1:53:23] that is what he used to do to get juice
[1:53:25] out of the gold these have beat it until
[1:53:27] they see the only reflection in it and
[1:53:28] that's what the holy spirit does by the
[1:53:30] word it beats all the world out of the
[1:53:32] church until the reflection of jesus
[1:53:34] christ appears in the church in the
[1:53:35] people
[1:53:37] blows until jesus sees his reflection
[1:53:39] inside of you

[1:53:54] pull it out of the king
[1:53:56] and come back under the fellowship of
[1:53:58] the blood again into this chicano glory
[1:54:00] and a pentecostal experience like it had
[1:54:02] back there many many years ago
[1:54:04] that's what the church need
[1:54:06] not more explainers more revelators
[1:54:08] hallelujah more apostles and prophets
[1:54:10] and pastors not more that but more of
[1:54:12] the holy ghost that cleanse the church

[1:54:28] so i'm barely halfway through but i will
[1:54:31] tie out this morning
[1:54:34] i see in that all right
[1:54:37] so the heifer had to be burnt
[1:54:39] with her was to be burnt his sub cedar
[1:54:41] scarlet burned together by the heifer
[1:54:44] the scarlet is rum's wool dyed in blood
[1:54:47] his suppose weeds this is what applied
[1:54:50] the blood by is not right now my baptist
[1:54:53] brother i want to ask you something if
[1:54:54] justification is all god required i'd
[1:54:56] like to ask you when a man was separated
[1:54:58] by the water of separation and sprinkled
[1:54:59] then he could not yet enter into the
[1:55:01] worship of the glory of the lord he
[1:55:04] could not do it because he was only
[1:55:05] sprinkled from his sins
[1:55:07] it separated him from his sins but he
[1:55:10] had his part but it did not put him into
[1:55:12] fellowship amen so god forgive your sins
[1:55:16] god separated you from your sins but
[1:55:18] that still doesn't put you into
[1:55:19] fellowship
[1:55:20] he said now watch next it's he said what
[1:55:23] it's several says no ephesians says we
[1:55:25] are watched by watching the word now
[1:55:26] hearing the word you could be just
[1:55:27] religious and so on the next thing what
[1:55:30] you have to look for is seven strips of
[1:55:32] blood
[1:55:33] seven churches
[1:55:35] so after you get several of your sins
[1:55:38] you come and get sprinkled with seven
[1:55:39] drops of blood
[1:55:40] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[1:55:42] temperance and patience
[1:55:44] seven thunders the blood of jesus christ
[1:55:48] the water of separation
[1:55:50] hallelujah
[1:55:51] cleansing you and purifying you to
[1:55:54] prepare you to enter the charity
[1:55:56] l-o-v-e
[1:55:58] oh glory to god into shekinah into
[1:56:00] presence
[1:56:01] oh glory to god because that is what
[1:56:02] you're being called to to enter into
[1:56:04] presence isn't that right
[1:56:06] hallelujah praise god another thing the
[1:56:08] believer had to recognize this the
[1:56:10] believer coming in no he's not in
[1:56:12] fellowship yet he's separated from his
[1:56:14] sins but he's not in fellowship he had
[1:56:16] to recognize the blood before him so
[1:56:19] when god forgive you and you tell your
[1:56:20] body i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved then
[1:56:23] you have to get the blood now the blood
[1:56:24] is not your power the blood is not your
[1:56:26] operation the blood is not you doing
[1:56:28] anything it is god doing thing for you
[1:56:31] you are cleansed by god you are cleansed
[1:56:34] by the word you are cleansed by the
[1:56:36] blood
[1:56:36] nothing you could do you could put your
[1:56:39] smoking you could quit your lying you
[1:56:41] could quit your adultery and quit your
[1:56:42] fornication and quit quit quick quick
[1:56:44] quit everything you still need blood
[1:56:46] or give the lord some praises
[1:56:48] is not what you stop is not what you
[1:56:50] quit is what is applied to you
[1:56:53] oh glory to god when the blessings apply
[1:56:55] to you it becomes effective
[1:56:58] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:57:01] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god
[1:57:03] hallelujah so he said the high priest
[1:57:05] had to own once a year and he had to
[1:57:07] make a noise and the only way the
[1:57:09] congregation could tell he wasn't dead
[1:57:11] is because they could hear that noise
[1:57:12] and i tell you when a church get off
[1:57:14] it's noise there's something happen
[1:57:16] so when you're here church quiet quiet

[1:57:34] behind the pulpit by wrong teachers and
[1:57:36] false teachings and wrong doctrines and
[1:57:38] wrong inspiration and wrong revelation
[1:57:41] and parading the beef and portion itself

[1:58:07] god's son he broke down the middle wall
[1:58:09] of partition he taught on the clearing

[2:01:09] biggest church in tongue i don't care if
[2:01:11] it's a mission on the corner if it's a
[2:01:13] brush album somewhere a thinking man
[2:01:14] knows that he's got to meet god
[2:01:17] and regardless of what did you say or
[2:01:20] anybody else he's got to come on god's
[2:01:22] tomb and god's term is god's word
[2:01:25] you are standing completely justified
[2:01:28] are you ready
[2:01:29] oh here we go
[2:01:31] when when you are separated from your
[2:01:32] first union by spiritual debt you are
[2:01:35] born again or remarried again to a new
[2:01:37] spiritual union
[2:01:39] of your not of your natural life but of
[2:01:42] eternal life
[2:01:43] that germ that was in you at the
[2:01:45] beginning found you
[2:01:46] your old book is gone your old union
[2:01:49] your name is not old it has been
[2:01:51] transferred do you mean to tell me that
[2:01:54] my old book god put it in the sea of
[2:01:55] forgetfulness you stand perfectly before
[2:01:58] god
[2:01:59] your name is now in the new book
[2:02:01] not in the book of life but the lamb's
[2:02:03] book of life what the lamb redeemed not
[2:02:06] the book of your old natural union but
[2:02:08] your new bride hallelujah your new life
[2:02:10] is in the lamb's book of life your
[2:02:12] marriage certificate hallelujah he said
[2:02:14] you are not only forgiven but you are
[2:02:16] justified
[2:02:17] unbearable glory justified romans 5 1
[2:02:20] therefore being justified by faith look
[2:02:23] up the word the word don't mean forgiven
[2:02:26] the word means justified it don't mean
[2:02:29] you're forgiven
[2:02:30] you said if you heard i got drunk and
[2:02:32] done some evil things and everything
[2:02:33] then you come around and say you found
[2:02:35] out i didn't do it then you come around
[2:02:36] and say brother brown and forgive me
[2:02:38] forgive me but i didn't do it in the
[2:02:39] first place how if i did do it i'm
[2:02:42] guilty but you could forgive me but i
[2:02:44] wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm not
[2:02:45] justified because i actually done it but
[2:02:47] the word justified is though you've
[2:02:49] never done it
[2:02:51] so when god justify you a rank sinner
[2:02:55] is as if you've never done it so not
[2:02:57] even satan could plead your case before
[2:02:59] god
[2:03:00] he gotta come and bring a point she did
[2:03:02] he said did what
[2:03:04] they are justified
[2:03:05] i don't see it what are you talking
[2:03:07] about
[2:03:08] because they see the blood
[2:03:10] the blood is over them
[2:03:11] satan looking and can't see you looking
[2:03:13] and seeing your sins your past your
[2:03:15] failures your faults your mystic but
[2:03:18] when your father looked down you see in
[2:03:19] blood you said that is my own blood
[2:03:22] that is better my son
[2:03:24] my blood covers them my blood is what i
[2:03:26] see they are perfect they are perfect
[2:03:28] through the blood
[2:03:29] oh glory to god hallelujah now the word
[2:03:32] justified is though you've never done it
[2:03:35] it's not even regarded at all
[2:03:37] it's done in the fear of forgetfulness
[2:03:40] you don't have that kind of mind but god
[2:03:41] have it he has something called the sea
[2:03:43] of forgetfulness when it has dropped yet
[2:03:45] he and all this forget
