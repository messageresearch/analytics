[46:22] and we also have Omega Castillo Shaniqua
[46:27] he'd Shana he'd Ciera he'd and Xavier
[46:30] he'd invited by with a Mike Blackmon
[46:31] where you at god bless you welcome to
[46:34] Hester tavern after we're happy to have
[46:35] you with us amen so I have a title this
[46:39] morning and the title is recognizing
[46:43] your day and your message and an
[46:46] inspiration return unto the Lord you
[46:51] know and it's so powerful coming off of
[46:55] the convention and the inspiration and
[46:57] seeing that you know but the Branham
[46:59] said the evening time message is to
[47:01] apply the token and when you really look
[47:03] at that scripture just to me
[47:06] find quickly here in Exodus chapter 12
[47:11] when I just place it in context and it's
[47:15] so refreshing when you're in the wood
[47:17] isn't around
[47:17] I trust you in the word this week amen
[47:25] and the Lord Exodus 12 verse 1 and the
[47:29] Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the
[47:31] land of Egypt seeing this month shall be
[47:34] unto you the beginning of months it
[47:36] shall be the first month of the year to
[47:39] you and it was after that that the Lord
[47:42] gave the instructions of how to get the
[47:44] lamb for the house and but what struck
[47:47] me is that at this point when God was
[47:50] bringing to them this first concept of
[47:53] the talk and he said forget everything
[47:55] in the past this month shall be unto you
[47:59] the beginning of months it doesn't
[48:01] matter what month you're in what day it
[48:03] is where what happened in your life
[48:05] forget everything else I'm having this
[48:07] conversation with you today and this
[48:09] month is a new beginning to you this
[48:12] month is a new day to you yesterday is
[48:15] over last month is over last year is
[48:18] over the last five years is over your
[48:21] problems your past your mistake whether
[48:23] you went to church last week or not this
[48:26] month from this word power is the
[48:29] beginning of a new dispensation for you
[48:31] it's the beginning of a new season for
[48:34] you it's a beginning of a new
[48:36] opportunity for you it's a beginning of
[48:38] a new ministry for you it's a beginning
[48:41] of a new understanding for you is a
[48:42] beginning of a new talk for you it's a
[48:45] beginning of the new walk free
[48:47] because after you to enter your what I'm
[48:49] about to tell you things will look
[48:50] different things work sound different
[48:52] things will feel different it's
[48:55] refreshing to know that God is a God of
[48:57] renewal he's a God of starting over he's
[49:01] a God of new beginnings and every time
[49:04] the Sun Goes Down and the moon appears
[49:07] night comes and the dawn appears it's a
[49:10] reminder when the Sun rises again that
[49:13] it's an EP every day we are reminded
[49:16] that it's a mutate that God is willing
[49:20] to stop over for you to pick up the
[49:22] pieces and a movement a new day a new
[49:27] Sun make when that Sun is how many years
[49:30] ago and Jesus rose from the dead it was
[49:33] the beginning of a new dispensation it
[49:36] was beginning of the new season and each
[49:39] of us in our Christian journey there's a
[49:42] new month for us there's a new day for
[49:44] us there's a new week for us can the
[49:47] church say man hallelujah
[49:50] so I feel that coming into this month of
[49:53] July for us coming off of the convention
[49:56] with an inspiration of the token that
[49:59] this is a beginning of months for us
[50:03] it's a new season for this church I'm
[50:05] speaking to this local church here so
[50:07] it's a new time for us it's a new season
[50:10] in our lives it's a new season in my
[50:13] life and and the reality is as as Moses
[50:18] would have been sharing this to the
[50:20] people it would have been up to each of
[50:22] the individuals Patchett for themselves
[50:31] everybody doesn't catch it all at the
[50:33] same time and God was speaking to Moses
[50:42] and Aaron he wasn't speaking to
[50:44] everybody but it was up to Moses and
[50:47] Aaron to convey to the people that hey
[50:49] this is a new beginning we have not
[50:53] walked this way before and they would be
[50:55] in for a series of new beginnings
[50:57] because even when Joshua took over he
[51:00] would say we have not been this way
[51:01] before and many times along your life's
[51:05] journey you will meet situations and
[51:07] challenges and opportunities that you
[51:09] have never met before and every time you
[51:12] meet something you have not met before
[51:14] it's a new beginning to you
[51:16] [Music]
[51:18] because something has to happen on the
[51:20] inside to meet the challenge of the hour
[51:23] to meet the obstacle of the hour and
[51:26] throughout scripture throughout every
[51:30] Patriot throughout every prophet
[51:32] throughout every King and every priests
[51:34] and every leader every time they met a
[51:37] new situation or they met a problem or
[51:40] they're met and obstacle God has always
[51:42] been faithful to raise up somebody with
[51:47] a word with a sign with a miracle with a
[51:52] testimony with an inspiration to prove
[51:56] that he's the same yesterday to prove
[51:58] he's the same today to prove he the same
[52:01] forever it could be one person it could
[52:04] be five people but whether Branham
[52:06] taught us God will always have a witness
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:11] God will always have a witness you know
[52:18] so many times and I now get to preaching
[52:21] but sometimes I just want to share a few
[52:22] things you know and remember when David
[52:27] had the great victory and after the
[52:31] victory let me see if I get it quickly
[52:35] mighty Ministry of David you appreciate
[52:39] the Avis ministry
[52:43] [Applause]
[52:50] we cannot be gonna take our time this
[52:53] woman keep your seatbelts buckled
[53:04] keep your seatbelt buckle amen so you
[53:44] find it in in in first Sammy well fitty
[53:51] this one and it came to pass that when
[53:57] David and his men will come to Ziggler
[54:00] you familiar with the scripture on the
[54:03] third day that the Amalekites had
[54:05] invaded the south and Ziggler and
[54:09] smitten Ziggler and burnt it with fire
[54:13] and I've taken the woman captives that
[54:17] with aaron is soon on any either great
[54:19] or small but carried em away and went on
[54:22] the way so David and his men came to the
[54:25] city and behold it was burn with fire
[54:27] you imagine you come home and see your
[54:30] home burn with fire and their wives and
[54:33] their sons and their daughters were
[54:34] taken captives and then David and the
[54:38] people I were with him lifted up their
[54:39] voice and wept until they had no more
[54:42] power to weep you know as a cry until
[54:46] you came in crying no more they wept but
[54:49] I am trying until they couldn't even
[54:50] weapon you couldn't weep no more you cry
[54:53] daily have no more tears the criteria
[54:56] lost your voice that's how sorrowful
[54:59] they were and David wise were taken
[55:03] captive and David was greatly distressed
[55:07] listen to this for the people speak of
[55:10] stoning him this is the same David who
[55:15] when everybody was scared was the only
[55:17] man to face Goliath
[55:19] this was his same David who had led them
[55:22] into numerous battles and had numerous
[55:25] victories and here is something we're
[55:29] wrong and all after all he we pin and
[55:32] nobody up their voice they still have
[55:33] enough voice to say let's let's store
[55:38] him because the soul of the people were
[55:44] grieved every man for his sons and for
[55:48] his daughters but David what did the
[55:52] Bible say encouraged himself and you
[55:59] know when the Prophet says he could turn
[56:01] your wife against you he could turn your
[56:04] children against you he could turn the
[56:07] church against you this is when you have
[56:10] to now the challenge is but ask me it's
[56:20] easy to preach this you know but when
[56:26] you hear these stones have been picked
[56:28] up and these storms are being prepared
[56:31] to be thrown you have to have a true
[56:35] revelation of encouraging yourself in
[56:44] the Lord
[56:47] and I believe God will allow situations
[56:50] that come to us for us I have to
[56:53] encourage our cell in the law because
[56:55] our spiritual type is Eagles and what
[57:00] distinguishes Eagles from other birds is
[57:03] two main things the Eagle is you only
[57:07] put a look at the storm and flames it
[57:10] other birds when his storm coming they
[57:13] say let's go away from the storm but the
[57:16] ego could look at these torments they
[57:18] are looking at finding sauce the ID
[57:20] middle of it because my wings could take
[57:23] me there
[57:24] so our girl isn't afraid of challenges
[57:27] and opposition and and problems that
[57:30] that that wasn't seen an eagle and the
[57:33] other thing about the eagle is an ego
[57:35] could fly alone and Eagan doesn't need
[57:38] validation an ego doesn't need
[57:41] permission to worship and eager doesn't
[57:43] need permission to pray for mission to
[57:46] qualifier permission to see Lord and in
[57:50] a miracle in this house eager to even
[57:52] attach the posture to pray for their
[57:54] children because an eagle understands
[57:57] that it's an eagle and an eagle does
[58:02] what an eagle is built to - an eagle is
[58:05] built to overcoming evil is not dentist
[58:09] in the bunny out of depression and the
[58:12] Pawnee out of confusion and the money
[58:15] out of situation and either could raise
[58:17] above the obstacles and encourage
[58:20] themselves the third attribute of the
[58:26] eagle and there are few of them number
[58:29] three whenever there's food
[58:32] the Eagles come together because once
[58:36] there's good food Eagles come together
[58:39] to eat cod food
[58:41] so this morning it's a and you know what
[58:43] a a convocation is a convocation by
[58:49] definition is a gathering of eagles
[58:52] it's a flock of birds there's a
[58:54] convocation of Eagles Eagles get your
[58:57] own category because when they come
[58:59] together it's a different story
[59:01] Eagles come together to share their
[59:03] testimony of how they meet it over and
[59:07] how it all hell was against him how they
[59:10] encourage themselves in the Lord when
[59:12] their wife didn't encourage them their
[59:14] husband didn't encourage them they have
[59:17] no money to pay the bills but he
[59:19] encouraged himself in the Lord because
[59:22] though you may receive it the Lord is
[59:27] his word and the word is the Lord so
[59:31] when you encourage yourself in the Lord
[59:32] it means you can reach into the
[59:34] scripture and follow us relevant to your
[59:37] situation at that particular point in
[59:39] time so when you have no money you can
[59:42] share and reach into the Lord and say
[59:45] the Bible should have never seen the
[59:47] righteous back read order oh come on
[59:50] somebody help somebody helped me this
[59:53] morning so I'm here to encourage you to
[59:58] encourage yourself in the Lord because
[1:00:00] Sunday's is just one day of the week but
[1:00:03] on Monday when the past is not around
[1:00:05] when the deacon is not around you have
[1:00:08] to be able to encourage yourself in the
[1:00:12] Lord when your boss thoughts mean to you
[1:00:15] and you feel like answering back you
[1:00:17] encourage yourself in the Lord and you
[1:00:22] bridle your tongue because mark the
[1:00:25] perfect manicured bridle his tongue and
[1:00:28] and you encourage yourself in the Lord
[1:00:30] or come on somebody help me somebody
[1:00:33] help me
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:39] [Applause]
[1:00:41] may the service be a new beginning to us
[1:00:45] because the word has to have an effect I
[1:00:48] don't want any lives it must have an
[1:00:51] effect in our homes it must have an
[1:00:53] effect within our families it was have
[1:00:56] an effect in our neighborhoods it must
[1:00:59] have an effect when we go on the bus or
[1:01:01] we drive the car if the world is that
[1:01:03] having an effect beyond your presence in
[1:01:05] church you are doing a disservice to the
[1:01:08] effectiveness of the way because the
[1:01:10] world has an objective and Jesus the
[1:01:13] words headed this way my word cannot
[1:01:14] return void so once the word is this
[1:01:17] scratch it is designed with the purpose
[1:01:18] and that purpose is to bring forth what
[1:01:22] it was designed for and when you leave
[1:01:24] this Tabernacle this morning it must be
[1:01:27] designed that you are Monday you
[1:01:29] overcome on Tuesday you overcome on

[1:02:34] hallelujah every situation but the wall
[1:02:38] it's different but for you it's an
[1:02:40] opportunity to overcome the damage
[1:02:42] different for you it's an opportunity to
[1:02:45] worship hallelujah hallelujah it's not
[1:02:50] our place to understand all that God
[1:02:53] wants to do for us when we want him to
[1:02:56] explain it he said my thoughts are not
[1:02:59] your thoughts my ways are not my ways as
[1:03:01] they happens a higher than the earth so
[1:03:03] my toes higher and your toes he allows
[1:03:07] us to understand what he wants us to
[1:03:09] understand but outside of that in the
[1:03:12] midst of your trial worship in the midst
[1:03:15] of your problem worship when you have no
[1:03:17] money worship when you are tired worship
[1:03:20] when all hell is against you worship

[1:03:25] tired worship when you are pressed under
[1:03:28] pressure worship worship we are born to

[1:03:37] proceeds a practice of the Holy Ghost

[1:03:48] we have any worshipers worshipers in
[1:03:50] their house hallelujah oh so many you go
[1:03:54] to sorrow praise
[1:03:56] [Applause]
[1:03:59] listen you may be seated
[1:04:01] we worship not because of what he has
[1:04:05] done or what he will do oh no no no no
[1:04:09] no no no no worship it's based on who he
[1:04:11] is that's the reason we worship because
[1:04:15] He is God every other religion every
[1:04:18] other belief they have all kind of
[1:04:20] reasons to do what they do but us we
[1:04:22] worship because He is God we worship
[1:04:25] because he is the creator
[1:04:26] we worship because he's a healer we can
[1:04:30] heal when he wants to heal but he is a
[1:04:32] healer and that's why we worship Him we
[1:04:36] worship because he's a restorer and he
[1:04:39] promised missing limbs will be restored
[1:04:41] but we worship Him anyhow we pray we
[1:04:45] sigh Atari but he still deserves worship
[1:04:50] you may be seated
[1:04:54] your spiritual condition has nothing to
[1:04:59] do with God is evolution let me say that
[1:05:07] again your spiritual condition has
[1:05:11] nothing to do with God deserving worship
[1:05:13] [Applause]
[1:05:16] you could come on up I in the morning
[1:05:18] and he still deserves worship has
[1:05:22] nothing to do with your spiritual
[1:05:23] condition this is an outside-in
[1:05:28] experience and some of you your bodies
[1:05:31] don't know what seat is on the inside
[1:05:33] that's why the Bible said bring your
[1:05:35] body under subjection that seed has to
[1:05:39] come in the right environment and get
[1:05:41] food to begin to pulse it to let your
[1:05:44] spirit know and let your body know that
[1:05:47] there's a seed German your soul that you
[1:05:50] didn't put there you didn't earn it he
[1:05:52] did nothing to deserve it but God rich
[1:05:55] in mercy before there was a moon before
[1:05:58] there was a stop before there was a
[1:06:00] molecule before there was let there be
[1:06:02] anything that sure was prepared with the
[1:06:06] mystery of who you are
[1:06:08] [Applause]
[1:06:16] he may be seated and that's why the
[1:06:19] devil is jealous of you
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:25] he's jealous of you where am i King
[1:06:27] because he had a beginning and because
[1:06:32] he had a beginning he must have an
[1:06:35] ending because anything that had a
[1:06:37] beginning has to have an ending hatred
[1:06:41] had a beginning it will not always exist
[1:06:43] hatred has an ending but love never had
[1:06:47] a beginning because God is love and God
[1:06:50] never had a beginning so love will
[1:06:53] conquer a multitude of sins multitude of
[1:06:56] problems and to know that you are an
[1:06:59] attribute of the eternal God you are an
[1:07:02] attribute of the eternal spirit then
[1:07:04] nothing past present future because all
[1:07:08] of this is subject to time your
[1:07:10] instructions your influence comes from
[1:07:13] above your instructions your influence
[1:07:17] he may be seated
[1:07:18] that's why no matter what you go through
[1:07:21] when you come to church you feel
[1:07:24] something I've said it before when you
[1:07:36] when you put Wi-Fi on your phone and you
[1:07:40] connect your network when you leave the
[1:07:44] location of a network because network is
[1:07:47] specific to location so it is Wi-Fi in
[1:07:50] this building and you're here you're
[1:07:52] connected to the network when you data
[1:07:54] drive away from the church the moment
[1:07:56] you get past a certain boundary you will
[1:07:59] automatically disconnect
[1:08:03] and then when you get maybe to your
[1:08:05] house you're connected a network over
[1:08:07] there
[1:08:09] well that Wi-Fi has a user name and has
[1:08:12] a password and the thing is your genetic
[1:08:19] coding God has that username and
[1:08:21] password so the very first time you came
[1:08:25] in contact with this message
[1:08:27] there was a Wi-Fi connection automatic
[1:08:32] and then the word start to make sense to
[1:08:35] you and the thing of it is this is why
[1:08:40] when people black slider make mistake
[1:08:42] and it come for a while but of course
[1:08:43] when they come back into the process all
[1:08:45] of a sudden you start to remember things
[1:08:48] and because we are on the same network
[1:08:53] when you meet a brother on the road and
[1:08:55] and maybe didn't turn and shake his hand
[1:08:58] as a there's a connection because we are
[1:09:00] part of the same or you don't get me
[1:09:02] this morning you don't hear me this
[1:09:04] morning or you know hear me this morning
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:16] you incident that's why I encourage you
[1:09:19] no matter how you're feeling come
[1:09:21] together and fellowship the Bible said
[1:09:24] forsake not the assembling of ourselves
[1:09:26] together especially as the Day
[1:09:29] approaching
[1:09:29] a lot a Wi-Fi interference or kind of
[1:09:37] distraction trying to interrupt the
[1:09:39] connection because this connection is
[1:09:41] not designed for when you're in the
[1:09:42] tablet because when the same network
[1:09:45] that's why Philip could be in a meeting
[1:09:47] and Crocket say there's somebody else
[1:09:49] just connected to the network and Philip
[1:09:52] at the leaf was translated to the
[1:09:55] Ethiopian eunuch will somehow figure out
[1:09:57] how to connect to the network
[1:09:59] oh you know give me this
[1:10:08] you have to understand the maps it has
[1:10:12] nothing new Under the Sun and all that
[1:10:14] man is trying to do has already existed
[1:10:17] Paul and Silas in prison we want
[1:10:21] automatic door automatic heat automatic
[1:10:23] coffee automatic this automatic that
[1:10:26] Paul and Silas in prison where Terrence
[1:10:29] and I just had to worship I just had to
[1:10:31] pray the first official 24 hours before
[1:10:34] we get to that but it was automatic door
[1:10:36] gets opened people get in trouble to
[1:10:40] sleep those guards were sleeping they
[1:10:44] get an instant sleep remedy when the
[1:10:47] angel came for Paul and Silas never had
[1:10:49] a good night rest Roberto they couldn't
[1:10:51] explain where Paul and Silas went but
[1:10:55] Horace has an automatic heat those men
[1:10:57] gotta sleep remedy and Paul and Silas
[1:11:00] come out shouting and worshipping
[1:11:02] because they were on the same network
[1:11:09] you were visited and a network is about
[1:11:16] connections and the human body is
[1:11:20] connections because at the atomic
[1:11:23] subatomic level all of our nerves and
[1:11:28] everything is connected and scientists
[1:11:31] will tell you the reason you can get an
[1:11:32] electric shock is because your body
[1:11:34] actually conducts electricity you are
[1:11:37] your own power generator when your heart
[1:11:40] pumps and your body takes in oxygen you
[1:11:42] actually generating electricity so your
[1:11:48] fingers are connected to your brain and
[1:11:51] somebody tell you if you got a pain in
[1:11:53] your jaw is gonna get to your heart it's
[1:11:54] going to the disk because it's all
[1:11:56] connected
[1:11:56] so this Wi-Fi thing is not a doctrine
[1:11:59] you know because when you're baptized in
[1:12:01] the body or part of the body
[1:12:03] and as part of the body you
[1:12:05] automatically connected Michael Jones
[1:12:09] that's why there can be no schism in the
[1:12:14] body a copy jealousy in the body how can
[1:12:19] he big to look at he Hannah's hair
[1:12:20] jealous his hand and I wish I could eat
[1:12:23] all and nihon have two different
[1:12:25] purposes and you know what if you have a
[1:12:28] missing finger your whole body feels it
[1:12:31] it is appealing a little finger your
[1:12:33] whole body fuses because it's one buddy
[1:12:36] quad isn't coming no for you for Han
[1:12:40] here and I hand on that side and he head
[1:12:42] over there and he foot on that side is
[1:12:44] one buddy and the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:12:46] unite us as one buddy have you been
[1:12:49] baptized into de that's why we ought to
[1:12:57] encourage one another pray for one
[1:13:00] another look out for one another
[1:13:05] we had such wonderful fellowship over
[1:13:08] the convention and believers came here
[1:13:10] who never came before me so happy with
[1:13:11] that and in fellowship with some of the
[1:13:13] young people who came they're like you
[1:13:14] know it's true to know in heaven have no
[1:13:16] sections for anybody is the family of
[1:13:20] God is the body of God and God was
[1:13:24] influenced his world before the terribly
[1:13:27] the terrible plague strike there has to
[1:13:29] be somebody who could damage your love
[1:13:31] and demonstrate forgiveness and
[1:13:34] demonstrate mercy and demonstrate
[1:13:36] charity that has nothing to do with your
[1:13:40] local church Allen has all to do with
[1:13:42] the body of Christ because he's coming
[1:13:45] back for our people United as a party
[1:13:50] come to church say Amen these are still
[1:13:56] the comments haven't started a message
[1:13:57] yet but George with the Clarence when I
[1:14:03] started speaking years ago I said be a
[1:14:05] short short which really short in height
[1:14:08] and shortened message length but as I'm
[1:14:12] getting older the heights really seem
[1:14:16] but he'll entity messages get it longer
[1:14:22] because it's too much good food he can't
[1:14:27] walk in double fear and just take
[1:14:28] appetizer and say I good you do at this
[1:14:32] service it's amazing when you gotta be
[1:14:34] fair to get your money's woods
[1:14:39] that's a weird some people out there
[1:14:42] bill I said you need to go you need to
[1:14:46] leave now
[1:14:51] but when it come to the house of God you
[1:14:53] come to get ammunition as much
[1:14:56] ammunition as you can carry
[1:14:58] you know I saw something yesterday and a
[1:15:00] guy said he thought he had seen it all
[1:15:02] until he saw this musician and it's this
[1:15:05] video of this young man he's putting on
[1:15:07] something on his back and it's a drum
[1:15:09] set and he takes a cord and he touches
[1:15:12] it to his foot he takes the next chord
[1:15:14] and put his next foot then he takes like
[1:15:16] guitar attached the next chord to a
[1:15:19] party drum behind and when I thought he
[1:15:21] was done he put something aside with an
[1:15:22] accordion and this one-man band start to
[1:15:27] play and stomp on him and his guitar its
[1:15:32] drum it's accordion and then you stopped
[1:15:34] pretty accordance after singing I
[1:15:35] stabilize it
[1:15:38] and as some people can play one
[1:15:41] instrument but here you have this man
[1:15:42] clean all these instruments as one and
[1:15:44] I'm seeing to see when you come to the
[1:15:46] house of God you have to come to get as
[1:15:49] much weapons as you could carry it have
[1:15:52] some people will just take another knife
[1:15:53] I'm going to say well this is what I
[1:15:55] want to fight with this week but I feel
[1:15:56] when I come to the house of God if I
[1:15:58] could fit a bazooka five grenades
[1:16:00] a rocket launcher and nice if it's a
[1:16:04] rubberband as much robanukah gets but
[1:16:07] whatever is a bullet its rubberband and
[1:16:10] shooting whatever it is but I am going
[1:16:12] down fighting ever going down because
[1:16:15] this earth belongs our
[1:16:16] and the devil is a rubber he's a thief
[1:16:19] he comes to destroy homes and families
[1:16:21] he affect our houses our marriages our
[1:16:24] lives and we have to reach us what to
[1:16:26] say enough is enough
[1:16:28] sickness is that my Porsche depression
[1:16:31] is that my portion being sad is that my
[1:16:33] promise look what am under Stalin a wee
[1:16:36] bit of madness could sign up everybody
[1:16:37] should be signing up he may be seen it
[1:16:44] when they cut off part of our mothers
[1:16:47] foot and when I - came to say without
[1:16:49] first day I said only were the mothers
[1:16:51] that come over some I like this he said
[1:16:53] but I Isaac the devil is under my feet
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:58] [Applause]
[1:17:02] [Music]
[1:17:04] I said look at perspective look at
[1:17:08] perspective and you know what'd he give
[1:17:10] any devil or a run for his money because
[1:17:12] he is still anyhow oh god he's still
[1:17:15] signing up he's still worshiping and he
[1:17:17] has a promise to meet a pillar of fire
[1:17:20] that will transform its water into
[1:17:23] immortality but the bottom said how
[1:17:25] could we have safer a rapture I'm not
[1:17:27] have feet for divine healing it means on
[1:17:29] the road to the rapture divine healing
[1:17:32] must be yeah must be here even missing
[1:17:39] limbs to be restored because the Prophet
[1:17:41] said it I believe it so shall it be let
[1:17:45] the devil take that and smoke it come
[1:17:51] the church say man Oh hallelujah
[1:17:57] so I want to touch on a thought this
[1:17:59] morning because we have to grow in grace
[1:18:02] we have to grow in life our lives must
[1:18:05] buzz see it's something the purpose of
[1:18:07] the Bible the purpose of the gospel the
[1:18:10] purpose of the message is not to stay in
[1:18:12] written form there are too many people
[1:18:17] walking around with the written form of
[1:18:19] the word but that was not the purpose of
[1:18:23] the written word the written word was to
[1:18:25] hold a key of mystery until a life can
[1:18:28] limit to what the New Testament refers
[1:18:35] to as written epistles that's the
[1:18:40] mission written epistles not you walking
[1:18:43] around with the Bible or the spoken word
[1:18:44] book that's a temporary halt in place
[1:18:47] for the word to become flesh so the
[1:18:54] whole mission of coming to service and
[1:18:56] reading the books and listen to the
[1:18:58] tapes is for something to happen to
[1:19:01] convert the tapes and the books into a
[1:19:03] life and that life is the Thunder that
[1:19:06] shakes the devil
[1:19:10] in the written form it was there but
[1:19:13] when Jesus could now bring it out from
[1:19:15] written and speak it and live it he said
[1:19:17] it is written and then it became spoken
[1:19:20] that's when the devil had to back up God
[1:19:25] doesn't want to taint us poor world book
[1:19:26] I'm slinging that the devil as a weapon
[1:19:28] but when the word is in you you can
[1:19:30] speak when the word is inner you can
[1:19:33] live whenever there's any fear
[1:19:34] demonstrate so whenever you forgive
[1:19:37] that's the word living you know or
[1:19:40] somebody preached back to me when you
[1:19:43] drop your odds that's no longer written
[1:19:46] word that's living with when a young
[1:19:50] person references the appearance that's
[1:19:52] not written the Bible says children obey
[1:19:55] appearance but when you obey you are
[1:19:57] living the wood when the purposive
[1:20:01] husband love your wives that's word but
[1:20:04] when you demonstrate it passed on living
[1:20:06] wood and right now we know in part we
[1:20:09] prophesy in part
[1:20:10] so we pick scriptures in part and we
[1:20:12] live it in part but it's coming a time
[1:20:14] when all of the world will be manifested
[1:20:17] through us then we become a true
[1:20:19] reflection because she becomes him and
[1:20:24] by an experience our identity crisis get
[1:20:28] solved because he he has to identify you
[1:20:35] just as in Genesis when Eve came she
[1:20:39] didn't know she was but Adam had to say
[1:20:43] you are woman you are flesh of my flesh
[1:20:47] you are born of my body and then all of
[1:20:50] a sudden she recognized that she is part
[1:20:52] of him it was no long it's not it was
[1:20:55] not just her being identified with him
[1:20:56] it was he identifying huh and right on
[1:20:59] we identified with the message but when
[1:21:01] the message because identify with us and
[1:21:04] God can say there is my spirit through
[1:21:08] him really because when a spirit of love
[1:21:10] really
[1:21:11] the word is the conductor of the spirit
[1:21:13] right now though the spirit is trying to
[1:21:16] flow but it can't flow fully because in
[1:21:21] our individual lives even though the
[1:21:23] fullness of the world has been restored
[1:21:25] individually you know that's why I hear
[1:21:27] I'll pass wire here but when you have as
[1:21:36] well a dealer said a balanced diet and
[1:21:38] you're feasting on the wood the wood is
[1:21:40] your breakfast
[1:21:41] the wood is your lunch the word is your
[1:21:43] dinner you retries to know that your
[1:21:45] father is the Creator URI tries to know
[1:21:47] who you are in the world no weapon from
[1:21:50] the kids you can prosper you begin to
[1:21:52] live an act and not worry you don't
[1:21:54] worry sister what the time you say fear
[1:21:56] not fear not fear not fear not and then
[1:21:59] you are in a process of bringing your
[1:22:02] spirit and your body under subjection to
[1:22:04] the see Jim that's trying to be built up
[1:22:07] to the control tower of your soul our
[1:22:11] natural Birds brought a delusion of who
[1:22:16] we are like I saw recently and I share
[1:22:19] it in my facebook I was actually shocked
[1:22:20] but if I mean you can say things
[1:22:22] shouldn't really shock you when you know
[1:22:24] what's what's happened but there's a
[1:22:25] movement in the u.s. to call babies
[1:22:28] babies to call them babies th ey bie a
[1:22:34] VB and there's a movement of parents who
[1:22:38] are of the view that you should not when
[1:22:40] a child is from the age of zero to four
[1:22:42] address them with any gender specific
[1:22:45] nicknames so don't call a boy tiger or
[1:22:49] tough for don't address him like that
[1:22:51] because he has to decide if he wants to
[1:22:53] be a boy or a girl and the movement says
[1:22:59] don't tell a young girl don't call a
[1:23:01] princess so beautiful because she has to
[1:23:03] decide if she wants to be a boy or a
[1:23:05] girl so don't call our boy or good call
[1:23:07] it a baby until they decide what they
[1:23:12] want to be
[1:23:16] and when you see these things happening
[1:23:18] around and these movements and all these
[1:23:20] stuff going on this is what will bring
[1:23:22] the squeeze and the press because when
[1:23:25] you speak against it you are now a rebel
[1:23:29] it's now call here speech it's now call
[1:23:33] a problem because you are speaking
[1:23:34] against this movement of free choice and
[1:23:37] and that's the free will that is going
[1:23:39] extreme because God gives us all a
[1:23:41] choice
[1:23:43] but even choice has its limits and
[1:23:49] that's the world we are living in and if
[1:23:52] you don't take a stand for something
[1:23:54] you'll be standing for nothing
[1:23:59] so this war this spiritual war because
[1:24:03] the natural war the same way we have
[1:24:05] services and we have preaching and we
[1:24:07] have the word the devil has its
[1:24:09] ministers and by the Branum identifying
[1:24:12] them through Elvis Presley and these one
[1:24:14] truly ages and those were the ones that
[1:24:16] were there what he could have identified
[1:24:18] with sins were profit left those guys
[1:24:21] have been promoted into new forms of
[1:24:24] ministries and new technologies but the
[1:24:28] brown said shoot the TV now your phone
[1:24:35] forget it is worse than a TV should we
[1:24:40] say shorty
[1:24:44] but but if Brandon was seeing something
[1:24:46] coming against and they'll take
[1:24:51] something to withstand it
[1:24:53] that's not human effort because if it's
[1:24:58] human effort it will feel but if it
[1:25:03] comes from the soul and the fire of the
[1:25:05] Holy Ghost that is what will stand so by
[1:25:16] the brand is fixable getting desperate
[1:25:18] to be positionally pleased in the body
[1:25:21] before the terrible plague strike
[1:25:24] because God is obligated and the prophet
[1:25:27] said if God does not judge this world in
[1:25:31] its Sodom condition he will have to
[1:25:32] repent the Sodom and Gomorrah and bring
[1:25:35] them back up again so judgment is
[1:25:37] guaranteed and the rapture is guaranteed
[1:25:41] and before there could be touch when
[1:25:44] there is always warning can the church
[1:25:50] say man
[1:25:53] so there are two things I want to speak
[1:25:55] on this morning we touch the message now
[1:25:58] of my comments are over recognized in
[1:26:00] your day and your message there's two
[1:26:02] things it's recognizing your D and it's
[1:26:05] recognized in your message recognized in
[1:26:09] your deed at times season recognizing
[1:26:12] the signs recognizing the conditions
[1:26:15] recognizing the challenges recognizing
[1:26:18] the opposition but a random speaks about
[1:26:21] recognizing the two spirits working
[1:26:23] within the framework of the church
[1:26:26] recognizing a different inner spiritual
[1:26:29] believer and the carnal believer
[1:26:32] recognizing people who want to sacrifice
[1:26:35] for spiritual things or sacrifice for
[1:26:37] natural things and many people depend
[1:26:42] eco Souls the evangelicals D recognize
[1:26:45] it D they speak about the end is nearly
[1:26:48] understand
[1:26:49] and everybody talks that so that means
[1:26:52] not a surprise to us about recognizing
[1:26:55] the day because the hour is late
[1:26:58] everything around the world a political
[1:27:00] system the religious system the economic
[1:27:03] systems the academic systems the
[1:27:05] educational systems the criminal systems
[1:27:08] everything is pointing to the end means
[1:27:13] hard to Babbitt's that feeling for fear
[1:27:15] he was afraid to go out at night people
[1:27:17] afraid to stuff that didn't exist 40 50
[1:27:20] 60 70 years ago you speaking somebody
[1:27:23] six years ago this head into even lock
[1:27:25] my door neighbors gonna come in and out
[1:27:28] know is when you're looking up his
[1:27:30] clacks clacks bang dog loose T dogs put
[1:27:34] on the alarm when you have to go any
[1:27:37] morning Kevin Rodney host clacks flat
[1:27:39] thing because the oil has changed and
[1:27:47] the spirits that started and operated in
[1:27:50] Genesis are still here
[1:27:54] seeds of keen brute beasts the Bible
[1:27:57] talks about that sink in who the New
[1:28:02] Testament is capsules of his father the
[1:28:04] devil so there are people who walk
[1:28:08] around who have no connection to God
[1:28:11] they are of their father the devil
[1:28:13] that's what Jesus said this generation
[1:28:15] of vipers so when you go to your job on
[1:28:20] your school and you treat everybody the
[1:28:22] same it's not that way because everyone
[1:28:26] has an influence they're only two
[1:28:28] influences but the brendham tortoise is
[1:28:31] either influence or impart an influence
[1:28:33] from below so every day we have to die
[1:28:37] to ourselves to make sure we know what's
[1:28:41] influencing us
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:47] and the influence friends it's not just
[1:28:52] somebody talking to you it's the
[1:28:55] influence of what your eyes see the
[1:28:59] atmosphere that you're in the influence
[1:29:03] of your job the influence of your family
[1:29:05] it could be the influence of people even
[1:29:07] within your house because Peter was with
[1:29:11] Jesus just had a revelation in Matthew
[1:29:14] 16 don't utter Christ and when Jesus
[1:29:18] opened their understanding to what was
[1:29:20] about to happen
[1:29:20] Peter said know-it-alls you can't die
[1:29:23] and Jesus said get behind me Satan to
[1:29:27] identify that even though he had a
[1:29:30] revelation he just missed the unfolding
[1:29:32] of what Jesus said no Jesus gotta be
[1:29:35] careful and Capt Lima pull your side
[1:29:37] delay it kind of tell he brothers this
[1:29:41] but he rebuked him openly
[1:29:43] I wonder how Peter felt but Jesus was
[1:29:47] not dealing with Peter as a man he was
[1:29:49] dealing with the spiritual world and
[1:29:51] what was happening and he also knew that
[1:29:56] Peter still had a journey to go through
[1:29:59] to an upper room experience Jesus
[1:30:02] already knew he was 14 I am Jesus
[1:30:04] already knew he is gonna Forge everybody
[1:30:05] knew all this so don't think he things
[1:30:11] lightly God your heart God your eyes you
[1:30:17] are spiritual Levites you are called to
[1:30:22] be priests and kings are chosen people
[1:30:24] are peculiar people a royal priesthood
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:33] recognized in your day but the Branham
[1:30:36] City let of hell is open and their
[1:30:38] streams of demon powers loose
[1:30:45] how could you risk walking out your
[1:30:47] house without praying
[1:30:52] how can you risk going to work without
[1:30:54] praying
[1:30:55] how could you work how could you risk
[1:30:58] taking transport without praying how
[1:31:02] could you spend your whole day in
[1:31:04] conversation with your friends and
[1:31:05] family and you don't even talk to God
[1:31:08] your son rightly said I must tell Jesus
[1:31:11] all of my troubles how many of your
[1:31:16] troubles you tell him and do you even
[1:31:18] tell him at all or do you tell everybody
[1:31:20] else and forget about him this sounds
[1:31:24] simple but these are the issues of life
[1:31:26] but as a people we forget it in the week
[1:31:29] and we all allows you to get as angry
[1:31:32] and we upset on you you get emotional
[1:31:34] and and it's a work up to come to
[1:31:36] service for next Sunday because your
[1:31:38] week is are it's an upside-down week now
[1:31:43] it's different if you're in the spirit
[1:31:44] it's different if you're praying and
[1:31:47] your tarrying and you're sighing and you
[1:31:49] play the songs of Zion and and before
[1:31:52] you wake up at we're gonna pass nineteen
[1:31:54] the spirit any a dream better and then
[1:31:56] you are going to the promises and who
[1:32:04] there's the time and the season and
[1:32:07] there is a message in Noah's day there
[1:32:10] was a message it will rain and Moses day
[1:32:13] was a message applied a token in Daniels
[1:32:15] day there was a message in what about
[1:32:17] our day but the Branham said in a
[1:32:20] message recognizing your day and it's
[1:32:21] message of reason people in Noah's day
[1:32:23] did not go into the ark is because they
[1:32:26] never recognized the message nor the
[1:32:28] messenger that's the only reason they
[1:32:30] perish is because they didn't recognize
[1:32:32] the hour that they were living they
[1:32:35] didn't recognize that God would deal
[1:32:37] with sin as he promised he would he
[1:32:40] would destroy man from the face of the
[1:32:42] earth he had prophesied it and he meant
[1:32:44] it and he means it to be the same as he
[1:32:47] did then they didn't recognize the hour
[1:32:49] it recognized the day they didn't
[1:32:51] recognize the sign
[1:32:53] didn't recognize the message they didn't
[1:32:56] recognize the messenger but put him from
[1:32:58] there miss and laughed at him and Jesus
[1:33:01] said as it was in the days of Noah
[1:33:05] every Sunday we should be so desperate
[1:33:08] to be in the house of God
[1:33:10] we can't wait to come and worship we
[1:33:13] can't wait to come to the altar the sigh
[1:33:15] and cry for the abomination in the city
[1:33:20] because the angel is moving around
[1:33:22] looking to put a mark upon those who
[1:33:24] sigh and cry god help us to get our
[1:33:29] priorities right the focus and attention
[1:33:33] that people pay to their business or
[1:33:36] their job doesn't even come close to
[1:33:38] half of some of what we do for the
[1:33:39] kingdom of God with Israel in the land
[1:33:45] and everything setting now and the
[1:33:47] message is just perfectly moving in what
[1:33:49] idea are we living in brother way over
[1:33:51] yet they didn't know that they didn't
[1:33:54] know it that's the reason they missed it
[1:33:56] is because they didn't recognize it they
[1:34:00] were like today alot someone like the
[1:34:01] people to be blinded by scientific
[1:34:04] proofs by educational systems by
[1:34:07] geological seminaries and things that
[1:34:09] blinded them in that day it's done the
[1:34:11] same things today is blinding them again
[1:34:14] and also the simplicity of the message
[1:34:16] and the messenger Noah wasn't scientific
[1:34:19] he was an educated man he was a poor
[1:34:21] farmer humble with a simple message and
[1:34:23] it was too simple for the high living
[1:34:27] the same way the Prophet came with a
[1:34:30] message he had no education and it was
[1:34:34] simple and in those days the Pentecost
[1:34:37] has came and heard it and they walked
[1:34:39] away and people have come true the
[1:34:43] message through the ears have heard it
[1:34:44] and they have walked away not
[1:34:47] necessarily walk out the message but
[1:34:49] they walk into their own ideas their
[1:34:50] world interpretation they are all
[1:34:51] feeling their own perception their own
[1:34:53] interpretation and when the message is
[1:34:56] really one thing alive
[1:34:58] to bring us to a life a life of love
[1:35:02] what do I have all mysteries and do I
[1:35:05] know warm nor do I give my body to be
[1:35:06] burned and have not charity I am nothing
[1:35:11] and when the brennaman said if the
[1:35:13] churches today would only recognize if
[1:35:16] the churches who only recognize the Word
[1:35:19] of God that made this promise when it's
[1:35:21] our to the people they wouldn't perish
[1:35:24] and if ever burden this morning to see
[1:35:27] us recognize that not only the hour is
[1:35:30] late but we have something to do we have
[1:35:34] to live out something something on the
[1:35:36] inside must begin to express itself on
[1:35:39] the outside there must be no doubt in
[1:35:42] your mind or the world's mind if you are
[1:35:45] son or daughter of God the world
[1:35:49] shouldn't be wondering if you're a
[1:35:51] Christian let me say that again the
[1:35:54] world should not be wondering if you're
[1:35:57] a Christian if you want to be a
[1:35:59] Christian be a Christian if you do want
[1:36:02] to be a Christian that's your choice to
[1:36:03] but if you want to be a Christian do it
[1:36:05] 100% when a parent said quote don't make
[1:36:09] half way preacher with a preacher to be
[1:36:11] half way goal don't make half a
[1:36:13] Christian and a Christian could be half
[1:36:15] way but whatever you do do it 100% but
[1:36:22] the Brenham said if I want to be a bum
[1:36:23] if I want to be a garbageman be the best
[1:36:26] garbageman if I supposed to be a vagrant
[1:36:29] I want to be the best vagrant but
[1:36:32] whatever you do be the best I think you
[1:36:36] want to be a Christian young people be a
[1:36:38] real Christian a Christian in your
[1:36:40] conversation a Christian on your job a
[1:36:44] Christian at your home what are you
[1:36:47] speaking about as a consistency of
[1:36:49] character a consistency of behavior
[1:36:53] people must a blab so I never know he
[1:36:55] has go to church is he's gorgeous no I
[1:37:03] have been as I remember situation I say
[1:37:05] yeah daddy are you oh you know so so
[1:37:07] yeah he might say in your church
[1:37:12] another believer should have to defend
[1:37:14] your position you know he inches nobody
[1:37:17] struggling so yeah if they're trying to
[1:37:20] explain you know no we and we know we
[1:37:23] all have our ups and downs and right now
[1:37:25] he um
[1:37:31] if you want to be a Christian be a real
[1:37:34] Christian and the thing is people are
[1:37:41] passionate about what they want to be
[1:37:43] passionate about become passionate about
[1:37:47] this this is life
[1:37:48] I share didn't think about him some time
[1:37:52] ago God spoke to Noah he never spoke to
[1:37:55] Noah's children he never spoke to Noah's
[1:37:58] wife it was up to Noah to bring this out
[1:38:01] of his family it would have been had
[1:38:04] because they were the only ones
[1:38:06] listen it's easy for us here no because
[1:38:08] you could look at somebody next to you
[1:38:09] and say okay we are traveling on the
[1:38:11] right Road but if you're the only person
[1:38:12] in the building and I'm telling you you
[1:38:14] are the one and that's what God is
[1:38:18] saying you anyone by George forget
[1:38:20] everywhere that's right no you already
[1:38:21] would but lxs you anyone if nobody isn't
[1:38:26] on the island has to make it you have to
[1:38:29] be the one to make it that's how you're
[1:38:33] gonna see this thing because too much of
[1:38:36] us and that's why all these gangs and
[1:38:39] these groups exist go people want to be
[1:38:40] part of something and this ridiculous
[1:38:44] thing they want to call peer pressure so
[1:38:46] you know in work and say you have to do
[1:38:49] this and what what
[1:39:00] we had a one Supporter see young some
[1:39:07] young people saying we are the ones that
[1:39:11] would buy our life our testimony not to
[1:39:16] make people feel embarrassed or bad
[1:39:17] that's not the objective
[1:39:19] but as to show them that there are still
[1:39:21] Christians and I've never seen a
[1:39:23] situation where somebody would look to
[1:39:25] the Christian saw it and wasn't like
[1:39:28] wait I didn't even know it had people
[1:39:30] who still live like that you know that's
[1:39:32] what you hear people say because this
[1:39:35] role is a hard road this is the high
[1:39:36] road
[1:39:37] this is he had a choice and you should
[1:39:41] be so happy to know that you have the
[1:39:43] opportunity you know any people who have
[1:39:47] never heard the gospel they have never
[1:39:51] been to church and some of you here are
[1:39:54] so ungrateful because your parent Ellie
[1:39:55] you have to come you have to come you
[1:39:57] have to come and you even know the
[1:39:58] saving your life
[1:40:00] that they are making short that you are
[1:40:03] in the environment to hear something but
[1:40:09] everyone said no may have slammed the
[1:40:12] window down on his child hands because I
[1:40:14] wanted to get out and say what daddy my
[1:40:17] friends think the thing they my friends
[1:40:19] outside react
[1:40:19] move why I quote whack and cut it all
[1:40:21] didn't understand but what happened when
[1:40:26] the rains came the moment or in scheme
[1:40:31] they were in the act and then the
[1:40:33] emotion changed from being safe to
[1:40:37] realizing that their friends would never
[1:40:39] make it and that's the pain that's a
[1:40:44] greater burden in your soul because the
[1:40:49] rapture has come in judgment is coming
[1:40:51] and we have to do all we can do no no
[1:40:57] not tomorrow now have prayer meetings
[1:41:01] reach out to people telling you have to
[1:41:04] come to church
[1:41:05] you have to read your Bible forget the
[1:41:08] news forget the politics it's only gonna
[1:41:10] get worse and worse come the church say
[1:41:15] Amen
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:20] but the Branham said the church has
[1:41:24] forgotten their prophets you don't need
[1:41:27] them anymore they kill him but God knows
[1:41:30] he's got to have them he hews his people
[1:41:33] by his word and and God sent a prophet
[1:41:35] to us we are so blessed to have a
[1:41:39] prophetic message that could point us to
[1:41:42] a way of escape without this there was
[1:41:45] no escape for us
[1:41:49] so this message is hope for families yes
[1:41:53] hope our lives can the church same
[1:41:57] that's a reason they're naked miserable
[1:42:00] blind Richard and don't know it because
[1:42:01] they don't recognize the hour that we're
[1:42:03] living in they don't notice it can the
[1:42:07] church seem Oh hallelujah what time is
[1:42:11] it brother
[1:42:12] but around I said what time is it
[1:42:14] minister do you see the time of the day
[1:42:16] and a sign you're living under can you
[1:42:18] understand it can you see it Oh
[1:42:21] hallelujah oh my this message is
[1:42:25] supposed to meet the challenge of the
[1:42:27] hour hallelujah Oh glory glory glory
[1:42:32] glory glory hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:35] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:42] now the first seal to the fourth seal
[1:42:47] identifies how Satan infiltrated the
[1:42:50] church by the Antichrist spirit with the
[1:42:55] four riders white horse red horse black
[1:42:58] horse and the pale horse but while all
[1:43:01] this is happening God would not allow
[1:43:03] the church to be infiltrated like that
[1:43:06] without having somebody along the way so
[1:43:09] even though Satan caused havoc through
[1:43:12] the ages God still was always doing a
[1:43:15] work of redemption and he would have
[1:43:18] messengers connected to each of these
[1:43:20] phases and we know that God sent the
[1:43:23] lion ox man and a eagle because this
[1:43:25] great drama was being unfolded now we
[1:43:29] know I think we're talking now about our
[1:43:31] message when he opened the fifth seal is
[1:43:34] the work of redemption for the Jews the
[1:43:37] sixth seal we know is the judgment seal
[1:43:39] the seventh seal silence under the
[1:43:46] silence visible yet invisible the core
[1:43:49] that was once invisible was become
[1:43:52] invisible
[1:43:54] the car that was one silence beginning
[1:43:56] to speak which is Jesus Christ as seen
[1:44:00] yesterday today and forever under the
[1:44:03] Seventh Seal he had once again changed
[1:44:06] form for a great work of redemption and
[1:44:09] Satan is mad because he doesn't
[1:44:12] understand what's happening the devil
[1:44:16] can understand the natural and what's
[1:44:18] happening but the spiritual things once
[1:44:21] he doesn't see a sign he has no clue
[1:44:24] every other seal had a symbol the first
[1:44:28] the second the third the fourth the
[1:44:30] fifth or sixth but not the seven seals
[1:44:34] because the Seventh Seal is Christ the
[1:44:37] Lord Himself descended with a shout and
[1:44:41] could it be that what would come under
[1:44:44] that seventh seal would be a living
[1:44:46] symbol that is a connection with going
[1:44:53] back to Eve back to the spoken word each
[1:44:57] seal had a word had a history had an age
[1:45:00] and a vision other people can we talk
[1:45:03] about the message can we talk about our
[1:45:06] TN our message and what your promise is
[1:45:09] the first four seals represented the
[1:45:15] church ages the fifth seal is the Jews
[1:45:18] the sixth seal is a judgment Co time to
[1:45:21] tribulation but the seventh seal has its
[1:45:28] own age has its own people has its own
[1:45:32] message hidden on the silence and I
[1:45:35] accident is it time for this silence to
[1:45:38] be broken
[1:45:40] because it has to be broken because from
[1:45:45] under the Seventh Seal is a power that
[1:45:47] will restore all things a power that
[1:45:51] will bring forth a manifestation of
[1:45:54] every mystery that the Prophet came to
[1:45:57] tyre that had to wait until a different
[1:46:00] people were on the earth different from
[1:46:02] Abraham different from Paul different
[1:46:05] from Iranians differ from Elijah even
[1:46:07] different than the Prophet himself a
[1:46:10] people with a power that the world had
[1:46:12] never seen before
[1:46:13] oh come on now what are you talking
[1:46:17] about Richard Adam lost the book it was
[1:46:21] the book of redemption it was the book
[1:46:23] of authority it was the book of power
[1:46:25] because Adam had his book in his
[1:46:27] possession he could speak and the
[1:46:29] mountains moved it was because of his
[1:46:32] authority he could see him out to be
[1:46:34] moved and he knew it had to happen
[1:46:36] because he had the signet ring he had
[1:46:38] the role he had the anointed he had the
[1:46:41] power he had the authority when he
[1:46:43] signed the check it was as good as a
[1:46:44] father signing the check when the banks
[1:46:46] for the check didn't couldn't tell him
[1:46:49] his Adam sign or of course and become
[1:46:50] what he signed as when you see me as he
[1:46:53] Nevada it was a shame check the same
[1:46:55] signet when an authority came with his
[1:47:00] book and when Adam fell that book went
[1:47:05] back into the hands of the the original
[1:47:08] owner because that book had biometrics
[1:47:11] nobody could just open the book that
[1:47:13] book was not just for anybody to open
[1:47:15] the book whether Papa socarrat to wait
[1:47:18] until somebody came along we could open
[1:47:21] the book and that book in the hands of
[1:47:23] your original owner John wept because he
[1:47:26] was waiting in another realm to see who
[1:47:28] was worried to open the book and then
[1:47:31] went oh come on now I went the breathing
[1:47:33] body lamb step thought
[1:47:35] tore the seals of the book because
[1:47:38] without this book be it open because out
[1:47:41] this message this reveal world of
[1:47:43] Malachi 4 in its fullness we didn't
[1:47:45] stand a chance that's why we have hope
[1:47:49] that's why we're not a Pentecostal
[1:47:51] Church that's why we are not just
[1:47:53] believers but we are hidden secret
[1:47:56] agents from under the seventh seal that
[1:47:59] brought before there was time please us
[1:48:02] in this slot to manifest something that
[1:48:06] D without us should not be made perfect
[1:48:08] Oh
[1:48:09] so come on now David is rooting for you
[1:48:12] Elijah is rooting for you
[1:48:14] but the Planum is rooting for you think
[1:48:16] come on bride come to perfection come to
[1:48:19] adoption come to manifestation come to
[1:48:22] the Holy Ghost come to power take your
[1:48:25] place take your position
[1:48:28] take your authority hallelujah
[1:48:36] hallelujah that's what your family is
[1:48:40] waiting for not for book they are
[1:48:45] waiting for somebody to speak Oh
[1:48:47] hallelujah
[1:48:49] and when the Prophet was here give a
[1:48:51] demonstration he access I had you right
[1:48:53] what can I do for you what do you want
[1:48:55] God to do for you
[1:48:56] he didn't say give your two boys these
[1:48:58] books when she said I need my two boys
[1:49:01] say I give them unto you and those
[1:49:04] brothers were delivered the moment that
[1:49:06] word went out and that's what your
[1:49:08] children need is not two three books
[1:49:11] it's a spoken word power that when you
[1:49:14] speak this is not just a pastor speaking
[1:49:16] now this is when you speak you can say
[1:49:19] bread I need bread and bread has to come
[1:49:21] because you have the authority Adamic
[1:49:24] Authority the power and Adam lost that's
[1:49:28] your promise that's your message the
[1:49:30] same scientists same oneness that the
[1:49:33] Alpha Church had that's your message
[1:49:35] that's your promise but the premise that
[1:49:38] we haven't seen it yet but it's coming
[1:49:40] in the right season at the right time
[1:49:44] when we meet it when the press comes
[1:49:46] watch the Philip pretend when the enemy
[1:49:49] comes like a flood watch the Spirit of
[1:49:52] God raise up a standard Oh nature is

[1:50:07] way he did when he walk the earth not
[1:50:09] the way it was when the Prophet was here
[1:50:10] but the master will multiply himself in
[1:50:14] individuals in this last day and Jesus
[1:50:18] will walk the earth once more he'll walk
[1:50:20] Patrick Street he'll walk Meredith in

[1:55:08] a job probably I'm pretty light bill
[1:55:14] you never know because if it's not
[1:55:16] labeled we do we have enough candles not
[1:55:20] to go wrong with that
[1:55:21] but at least I need to know because if I
[1:55:24] sell enough for this permanent thing I
[1:55:26] need to have a permanent understanding
[1:55:29] of this might be how we started but it
[1:55:31] do have to be how we finish but let me
[1:55:34] know what to expect because if I'm
[1:55:36] making this commitment I want to know
[1:55:38] and what BSS because love conquers all
[1:55:41] candle light bill power gone guys love
[1:55:44] koala but at least let me know how much
[1:55:46] love I need to have to conquer it so God
[1:55:54] who is rich in grace and mercy waited
[1:55:57] all these years these centuries is
[1:55:59] generational I get married to a lady
[1:56:01] when he saw Adam and Eve he's a
[1:56:04] workhorse I love it
[1:56:05] he's a core of the family so when he saw
[1:56:07] that he looked for the tea when he could
[1:56:10] also say this is born of my born as his
[1:56:14] spirit of my spirit and the whole type
[1:56:18] of the message speaks of this bride
[1:56:20] coming into view this bride coming into
[1:56:22] her places bride getting to know who she
[1:56:24] is
[1:56:25] this bracket already but card rich and
[1:56:28] grace the mercy wanted this bride to be
[1:56:30] this beets raw because but the Branham
[1:56:32] said you were engaged when for those who
[1:56:39] may have forgotten it with a random said
[1:56:41] you were the wedding band of and B
[1:56:42] engagement ring was slipped on your
[1:56:45] finger before the foundation of the
[1:56:47] world so you were born and gift
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:53] [Applause]
[1:56:58] and God is not breaking all this
[1:57:01] engagement because when he chose you he
[1:57:04] took its time and went through everybody
[1:57:06] and pick you and before you even bother
[1:57:09] make a mistake he slipped the ring on as
[1:57:11] his commitment because an engagement is
[1:57:14] a commitment it's a promise to marry at
[1:57:18] a date in the future when things are
[1:57:20] ready so when Jesus left the earth when
[1:57:23] he walked he said I go to prepare a
[1:57:25] place in my father's house are many
[1:57:27] mansions because a pride is has to come
[1:57:30] and live somewhere but brother branham
[1:57:38] brought all the type of the living bride
[1:57:41] and asleep in a bride so trod all the
[1:57:43] engine pause here to have bright there
[1:57:45] too and Martin Asian type right here too
[1:57:47] so in every age he always found out with
[1:57:50] the 7 love letter young we don't know
[1:57:54] what I'm taking anyone too much whatsapp
[1:57:57] too much face book telenovela love
[1:57:59] letter and he write the letter anyway
[1:58:00] two weeks later reach and you hoping you
[1:58:02] have two weeks so with me to come back
[1:58:04] you wait in the city reply to see if you
[1:58:08] find favor and take the time and crafty
[1:58:10] perfect would man get help hunting
[1:58:25] but short every age God send a messenger
[1:58:29] and that's why but the Branham said he
[1:58:32] didn't come to build a denomination he
[1:58:34] didn't come the bell of following
[1:58:36] because it was never about him it was
[1:58:39] about who sent the message so that's why
[1:58:44] the inspiration of my message this
[1:58:46] morning is return unto the Lord because
[1:58:49] it was the Lord sent a prophet messenger
[1:58:52] to give the message to his bride and
[1:58:55] once the bride receives the message it
[1:58:57] becomes her message because the message
[1:59:00] is addressed to you the message was not
[1:59:04] dressed to the Prophet the message with
[1:59:06] a dress to you he had a job to deliver
[1:59:09] the message as was given him by the
[1:59:12] father to deliver to the bride that's
[1:59:16] why the Prophet could not have injected
[1:59:18] his own thoughts into the message
[1:59:20] because he was not the source of the
[1:59:22] message and that's why the Ministry and
[1:59:25] the pastors and ministers have to say
[1:59:28] what the tip said because if you see
[1:59:30] anything else you are placing yourself
[1:59:32] in the hearts of the people and in the
[1:59:36] hearts of the people there's only room
[1:59:38] for the groom it's only room for the
[1:59:40] father
[1:59:41] somebody preached back to me
[1:59:43] [Music]
[1:59:44] [Applause]
[1:59:50] now for those of you maple remember it
[1:59:54] is 50 years ago when I get a love letter
[1:59:58] did you know people don't know but is
[2:00:00] virtually what is gross I could read any
[2:00:03] first paragraph I'm putting it on unless
[2:00:05] it has taken it induces but because they
[2:00:12] are matter time you're waiting for this
[2:00:13] thing it's not like email and text
[2:00:15] message it have too much things now
[2:00:16] where loves that come and you can't wait
[2:00:19] listen you rip the envelope every time
[2:00:20] find envelope without something loves to
[2:00:22] lick on you really want to see every
[2:00:24] envelope are on however you approaches
[2:00:27] that I love that super Jewish every word
[2:00:30] in a love letter has a sense of meaning
[2:00:33] and purpose and that's the sacredness we
[2:00:41] ought to have with this message we can
[2:00:44] take you know what I just lightly feel
[2:00:46] is far enough I got fairly second
[2:00:48] paragraph or fury to the paragraph
[2:00:50] no we have to take all because in this
[2:00:56] love letter is I promise you your family
[2:00:58] I promise I'll take care of you I
[2:01:01] promise our fee viewer promise I'll
[2:01:04] provide for you I promise I'll Helia
[2:01:07] this is the only love letter that can
[2:01:09] have causes like this I promise to Helia
[2:01:13] when I get sick when they get tired to
[2:01:15] lift you up when you cry or wipe your
[2:01:18] tears away somebody help me and as you
[2:01:22] come closer to the end of your love
[2:01:24] letter you say I've even better news for
[2:01:26] you because this life you're in is
[2:01:29] temporary there's a better place for you
[2:01:31] that I'm preparing for you where there
[2:01:34] will be no more crying
[2:01:36] there'll be no sign I kind of splinter
[2:01:39] in and fullest because you ain't
[2:01:41] understand it now but when you see it
[2:01:43] Daniel get it right boy again all up but
[2:01:47] it'll come a time when you'll never get
[2:01:49] old
[2:01:50] that's the beauty of this marriage no
[2:01:54] other love could do this for you come on
[2:01:57] now somebody please back to me that's
[2:01:59] the message
[2:02:01] [Applause]
[2:02:06] hopefully somebody gets this this
[2:02:08] morning so the mighty conqueror the Lord
[2:02:16] Himself because in our own human efforts
[2:02:19] we can never win the battle in all only
[2:02:21] malevolence
[2:02:22] so the Lord and septim mighty Conqueror
[2:02:24] hid himself as the word that's the
[2:02:27] message the revealed word every mystery
[2:02:31] revealed as a seventh under seven seal
[2:02:35] would cede message so that he could
[2:02:38] place himself in you please himself in
[2:02:43] the bride a secret mission and it was
[2:02:47] hidden under the Seventh Seal waiting
[2:02:49] for the right season the brannom said
[2:02:52] the notable angel the one with the
[2:02:54] shopback wings flew into him
[2:02:56] the mighty conqueror to reveal your
[2:03:00] redemptive rites
[2:03:02] so when the prophet said before the
[2:03:04] doctors hand touches my wife the tumor
[2:03:08] will go down that was not the Prophet
[2:03:10] that was the mighty Conqueror who had
[2:03:14] tabernacled himself in the Prophet when
[2:03:18] the Prophet says son come with an shine
[2:03:19] for days that was the mighty Conqueror
[2:03:21] at Tabernacle himself in the Prophet
[2:03:25] when he said let there be a squirrel
[2:03:28] that wasn't the Prophet that was the
[2:03:30] mighty Conqueror v-lin the Prophet when
[2:03:33] he said little fish I give you back your
[2:03:35] life that was on the Prophet that was
[2:03:37] the mighty Conqueror field in the
[2:03:40] Prophet since the haughty right they
[2:03:42] give you your two boys token would
[2:03:45] salvation
[2:03:46] that wasn't a profit that was the mighty
[2:03:49] conqueror feel in the profit and in this
[2:03:53] season God is once again looking for
[2:03:55] individuals not one man but many
[2:03:59] individuals to mail himself in a bride
[2:04:03] in the people that's your message 700
[2:04:09] ival another Ephesians new name every
[2:04:13] mystery finished present-tense
[2:04:15] Redemption a new army rising up led by
[2:04:19] the mighty Conqueror with a fivefold
[2:04:22] ministry all with the baptism of the
[2:04:24] Holy Ghost all adopted all with a mighty
[2:04:28] Conqueror in them as his commanding
[2:04:31] officers leading a Bride of Christ with
[2:04:34] the mighty Conqueror building them but
[2:04:37] the Branham said has been churches
[2:04:39] churches Brides write churches rise rise
[2:04:41] but there must come one there has to
[2:04:44] come a real bride they must come one
[2:04:46] that's not only good mechanics but the
[2:04:49] dynamics of it makes a church live
[2:04:51] moving the power of his resurrection Oh
[2:04:55] [Applause]
[2:04:57] until we come to that place until we
[2:04:59] find that place what good does it do to
[2:05:02] polish the hubs what good does it do to
[2:05:04] give her a fleas facelift or simonize
[2:05:06] job when there's no dynamics in it no
[2:05:09] matter how much the mechanics proves me
[2:05:11] right he has got to be dynamics to make
[2:05:14] it work again that's my expectation
[2:05:17] looking for the power of God to strike
[2:05:20] the church to strike your souls to
[2:05:22] strike your home to strike your life
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:28] that is our message and we will
[2:05:31] recognize our team and recognize our
[2:05:34] message can we give the Lord a shout of
[2:05:36] praise Oh hallelujah
[2:05:39] Oh My yes a few more minutes
[2:05:45] Alleluia few more minutes in eternity
[2:05:48] time
[2:05:56] but the brand I'm in the rising of the
[2:05:58] Sun he said that's what Easter proved
[2:05:59] and he was an old leader would and
[2:06:02] that's why we have to make that leap
[2:06:04] friends from our intellectual
[2:06:07] understanding of the message - the
[2:06:09] message becoming a reality and a
[2:06:11] manifestation in our lives that is
[2:06:13] something that live it out when Jesus
[2:06:15] came across the sea into the land of the
[2:06:17] gadarenes the devil's took note
[2:06:20] automatically without a word being said
[2:06:22] of who he was because the life was
[2:06:26] pulsating the virtues were pulsated the
[2:06:30] power was pulsating hallelujah and that
[2:06:33] germ that life in you that seed in your
[2:06:35] soul has the virtues has the power has
[2:06:37] it because you have a germ of life on
[2:06:39] God so Indians everything in there not
[2:06:42] seen but we are here this morning to
[2:06:44] give you a balanced diet some food to
[2:06:46] feed that seed in this right atmosphere
[2:06:48] so that the sea will bring forth what is
[2:06:51] already in there that's why I said I
[2:06:53] will not leave you comfortless but I
[2:06:55] will send the comforter even a Spirit of
[2:06:57] Truth and he the Spirit of Truth will
[2:06:59] guide you you could only be guided
[2:07:02] because there's something in you that
[2:07:03] can be guided if there was nothing in
[2:07:05] you then the can the church say Amen
[2:07:13] hallelujah that's why I always say the
[2:07:16] purpose of the fivefold ministry has its
[2:07:19] limits because it's until we all come to
[2:07:21] the unity of the faith and after we come
[2:07:24] there then you are in perfect harmony
[2:07:25] not with the five whole minutes you
[2:07:27] won't be good that's the objective the
[2:07:30] objective is not the church the pastor
[2:07:31] the objective is to return unto the Lord
[2:07:34] want a relationship with establish
[2:07:36] there's no more need for pastors and
[2:07:38] teachers because you you have been
[2:07:40] connected to your husband
[2:07:42] once you are connected to your husband
[2:07:45] no man have no place and who God joined
[2:07:47] together let no man put
[2:07:53] that's the message bride and bridegroom
[2:07:58] husband and wife see in science team
[2:08:01] oneness seeing miracles
[2:08:03] that's the message see if this man can
[2:08:06] be moved
[2:08:06] don't doubt in your heart whatever you
[2:08:09] say is gonna happen
[2:08:10] your reason river you'll have to ask if
[2:08:12] it is walk on the water that's your
[2:08:16] message walking on water you need food
[2:08:19] the only up two scoops of rice and one
[2:08:21] scoop apiece keep on scooping that's
[2:08:25] your message that's the power but a
[2:08:31] pelham said when that time comes it will
[2:08:34] need me praying in Jesus name it'll be
[2:08:36] to command the devil to come out that's
[2:08:38] your message we haven't seen that yet

[2:09:24] to go it's a message for our families
[2:09:26] it's a message for our children it's a
[2:09:29] message for our yiling it's a message
[2:09:31] that's vindicated it's a message that
[2:09:33] overcame it overcame in Paul's day it
[2:09:37] overcame an Iranian state it overcame
[2:09:39] and Martin Colombo Lutra Wesley the
[2:09:42] Pentecostals when the Prophet was here
[2:09:45] and this message could never fail it's
[2:09:47] Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same
[2:09:51] today
[2:09:52] and the same forever give the Lord a
[2:09:55] shot appraised
[2:09:56] [Applause]
[2:10:01] do you recognize your day do you
[2:10:04] recognize your message but the Branham
[2:10:06] said rapture and feet is laying in this
[2:10:09] message all you need to get raptured
[2:10:12] it's sitting on the books and the tapes
[2:10:14] someone's gonna pick it up but if Alan
[2:10:20] said one name the right word will be
[2:10:22] spoken the right thing will be sent for
[2:10:25] us to dash into the presence of God
[2:10:27] brother actually like having a service
[2:10:30] with a pterence when we say everything
[2:10:31] we don't stop bitching until we hit
[2:10:34] every promise until the right thing is
[2:10:37] said under the right thing is spoken you
[2:10:39] know we could dash into the presence of
[2:10:41] God Oh give him worship give him praise
[2:10:51] will make the devil uncomfortable will
[2:10:54] make being sin and sickness
[2:10:55] uncomfortable because in this atmosphere
[2:10:58] light and darkness kind of live in the
[2:11:00] same house oh we are going to have a
[2:11:02] revival we're gonna have a break troop
[2:11:04] we are gonna have a testimony that we
[2:11:07] overcame we're gonna have a testimony
[2:11:10] that we made it against all odds against
[2:11:16] all odds we made it but I knew your
[2:11:20] family is coming you better believe it
[2:11:23] you better claim it you better prophesy
[2:11:26] it you better declare it but as for your
[2:11:29] family is coming Oh hallelujah
[2:11:32] I don't care where your children are
[2:11:35] this morning this is our message this is
[2:11:38] our team this is our time this is our
[2:11:41] service this is our season now this
[2:11:48] message can never fail it can never fail
[2:11:51] impossible but this message to fail
[2:11:54] impossible for this message of Paul
[2:12:02] you may be seated
[2:12:05] no one the Prophet said he said when he
[2:12:09] Enzo come
[2:12:10] I check what the Angels said against the
[2:12:14] scriptures
[2:12:15] to make sure that what the angel was
[2:12:18] seeing was connected to the scripture so
[2:12:21] even the Prophet will understand this
[2:12:24] friends the Prophet put the angel on the
[2:12:27] question because he understood that he
[2:12:34] was just a messenger and the objective
[2:12:40] was to get the message to you so he had
[2:12:43] to make sure that whatever he
[2:12:44] transmitted the books and tapes have to
[2:12:46] be what you needed to hear that's why I
[2:12:49] can say I already told you how to make
[2:12:50] the rapture one day you're gonna see it
[2:12:54] I'm gonna send men who are gonna make
[2:12:55] more sense of it but I'm putting it in
[2:12:57] there because it's not for my time now
[2:13:01] but when you need to understand it the
[2:13:03] Spirit of Truth will Caillou - where's
[2:13:06] written and but the Branham said they
[2:13:09] will see what the messenger said how to
[2:13:12] spirit the Prophet and the bride will
[2:13:14] see the same thing and what they have
[2:13:16] said will have already been said in the
[2:13:19] wood so if I come to you with something
[2:13:23] new some some new way of putting it
[2:13:25] together you know this thing is not the
[2:13:28] way the Prophet said it and that the
[2:13:30] Providence did I don't want to get it
[2:13:32] because I want to get every word that
[2:13:35] the Prophet brought that came from my
[2:13:37] father came from my husband because I'm
[2:13:40] not taking chances I got to make the

[2:13:57] devil and his eyes shift you like wheat
[2:13:59] Jesus told Peter that listen he has
[2:14:01] desire to shift you he has given you the
[2:14:04] notice of what the devil wants to do I'm
[2:14:08] gonna night she said but I prayed for

[2:14:19] I prayed that you wouldn't be sifted he
[2:14:21] said I prayed that your feet feel not
[2:14:25] because trials will come situations will
[2:14:28] come problems will come but once you can
[2:14:34] hold on to your feet
[2:14:37] Buddha's skin won't destroy my body yet

[2:15:54] [Applause]
[2:15:56] that's why better Brenham said you
[2:15:59] didn't come to this this found you he
[2:16:02] said the message will fall into the
[2:16:06] hands of the predestinated it was not by
[2:16:10] your choosing it was not by your efforts
[2:16:13] it was not by your ability it was not by
[2:16:16] your study it was not by your meditation
[2:16:19] but God with destinated you for such a
[2:16:22] time as this he we destinated you for
[2:16:25] this our weary destinated you for this
[2:16:28] season he protects you to be here today
[2:16:31] you couldn't even mr. this service if
[2:16:33] you wanted to your whole life has
[2:16:36] brought you to this service on this day
[2:16:39] for you to recognize your day and
[2:16:41] recognize your message you may be seated
[2:16:49] and if you could catch a revelation of
[2:16:52] your message then you could do what the
[2:16:55] Prophet said time to say boo right back
[2:17:02] but the balancer when the devil comes
[2:17:04] and says stuff to you and say boo push
[2:17:06] ring back and take it and I said it many
[2:17:10] times
[2:17:10] my back pain it's not your back send it
[2:17:17] back
[2:17:19] the same way the message came to the
[2:17:22] Prophet for you it's your message it's
[2:17:23] not your back beam this one you can
[2:17:26] return to sender
[2:17:27] every time I back them come say that I
[2:17:30] Sentinel back to you and begin to speak
[2:17:40] positive begin to speak positive about
[2:17:43] your Christian walk begin to speak
[2:17:46] positive about your life begin to speak
[2:17:48] positive about what God will do and
[2:17:50] watch God act because your words are
[2:17:53] creative your words have power and that
[2:18:01] is what you are born to do if you shall
[2:18:04] see it to this mountain that's to tell
[2:18:09] you how powerful words are God said let
[2:18:12] there be and there was so not because
[2:18:14] your life is contrary doesn't mean you
[2:18:18] can speak for you it's qualit practice
[2:18:24] Mountain be moved straight Mountain D
[2:18:27] move Mountain be moved
[2:18:29] what did the Prophet say that that guy
[2:18:31] was selling the newspaper by Georgia
[2:18:33] extra extra read all about it he said
[2:18:36] that man didn't have heat for his even
[2:18:38] so after he prayed for him he came back
[2:18:40] in the prayer line and but I said I
[2:18:43] already prayed for you already healed if
[2:18:45] you already prayed for and already
[2:18:47] healed and it has not been physically
[2:18:49] manifested it's not to come back to get
[2:18:51] pray again the prayer is already going
[2:18:52] for that word carotenoid it's no longer
[2:18:55] on the prayer it's now on the feed side
[2:18:59] to transform the word of promise that
[2:19:01] has already been spoken into
[2:19:03] manifestation so I say to the parents in
[2:19:05] the church when your child's in trouble
[2:19:07] hand them over to the Lord pray for them
[2:19:10] commit them to the Lord and worship
[2:19:12] harder and you'll ever worship before
[2:19:14] and trust God to take care of the rest
[2:19:18] of it because they've already been
[2:19:19] prayed for and build your feet because
[2:19:22] as your feet build you can have feet
[2:19:25] beyond your circumstance to have feet
[2:19:27] activate
[2:19:28] yes situation also for somebody
[2:19:32] [Applause]
[2:19:35] give me a reference a man who was not
[2:19:40] even a Jew come to Jesus and say hey my
[2:19:44] servant is sick is it by making wood if
[2:19:51] you could come to my house I'm a man
[2:19:54] under Authority when I say to one come
[2:19:56] he comes when I say to one go he goes if
[2:19:59] you could just see the wood I have faith
[2:20:02] we have no evidence in Scripture of 87
[2:20:06] even knew this was going on but he has a
[2:20:09] man who is standing with an
[2:20:11] understanding of authority and an
[2:20:13] understanding of it see I know if you
[2:20:16] speak as I would my servant shall be
[2:20:20] healed
[2:20:21] Jesus mine was blown in fact he
[2:20:24] commented I haven't seen faith like this
[2:20:28] inside of his room so when your feet
[2:20:37] begins to reach the muscular level ya
[2:20:44] young with the German thing I want to
[2:20:46] you know build muscle then feed my soul
[2:20:48] can even lift up a pencil but when your
[2:20:51] feets had to come to be muscular level
[2:20:53] that you could say I'd I would have a
[2:20:56] dolt in so much that when the Centurion
[2:20:59] reach home yes even ask if he was here
[2:21:04] he's at what time
[2:21:09] what time was he healed because this
[2:21:13] this Jesus is different and that's
[2:21:16] coming to you look at the Prophet before
[2:21:18] he ducked his hand he was in in the
[2:21:20] country before he thought his answer to
[2:21:23] my wife do you want go down I wonder
[2:21:27] what he prophets say when he came back
[2:21:29] or he made a phone call about what time
[2:21:37] so let us begin to exercise our faith
[2:21:40] and begin this because that's our
[2:21:41] message because seven thunders gives a
[2:21:48] better Brandon taught us that perfect
[2:21:51] fit not intellectual fit now but perfect
[2:21:55] fit is based on your it's based on your
[2:21:59] position' faith is based on forgiveness
[2:22:01] but perfect fit is peace and your
[2:22:04] position is authoritative it so as you
[2:22:07] step into your position in Christ or
[2:22:10] come on now as you step into your
[2:22:13] position your feet becomes positional
[2:22:15] feet or what is called perfect feet so
[2:22:18] you could speak when you are on your
[2:22:20] property but a kanga lean you are on
[2:22:22] your house and somebody comes into your
[2:22:24] house you can say get out of my house my
[2:22:29] authority is based on the fact that this
[2:22:30] is my house I don't care what you say if
[2:22:33] and it's more so in the US if you draw
[2:22:35] somebody out of your house physically
[2:22:37] that's on demeanor because it's your
[2:22:40] house now if you and somebody else host
[2:22:43] and you draw somebody out you have no
[2:22:46] ground sistent because it's not your
[2:22:48] house but if it's your house every most
[2:22:54] miserable sign management reserves your
[2:22:56] right to refuse admissions
[2:22:57] because they understand that this
[2:22:59] business is my business and I can allow
[2:23:02] in who I want to exclude who I don't
[2:23:03] want that's positional Authority because
[2:23:07] many of us in our Christian walk are not
[2:23:09] in position we dwell in his realm of
[2:23:11] intellectual feet which has its powers
[2:23:15] but a bad amoeba referred the dingy fate
[2:23:16] if we stay here we die if we go we die
[2:23:19] if we wear the odds of it is better
[2:23:21] let's go there that he says the lowest
[2:23:23] level of it nice feet just be some pure
[2:23:26] mental reasoning and I fellas when they
[2:23:28] cause I know it's noise common victory
[2:23:31] and that was it but I'm ever gonna dingy
[2:23:36] feet and then tails dingy fit in this
[2:23:39] intellectual fear because we had come by
[2:23:41] hearing and hearing it and and that
[2:23:42] activates something but there's
[2:23:44] something else when you get into your
[2:23:45] position your police in Christ because
[2:23:49] you know police in Christ and you could
[2:23:50] speak in your place when a father gets
[2:23:52] in his place as father as head of his
[2:23:55] home he is an authority and I said you
[2:23:57] feed that comes with that because that's
[2:23:59] a couple into position when a wife is in
[2:24:02] her place it's an authority enough feet
[2:24:03] for that position because that is how
[2:24:06] that's a reflection of the relationship
[2:24:09] between Christ in His Church
[2:24:10] so God honors the structure that exists
[2:24:13] once it's in line with his word but over
[2:24:23] it we don't spend enough time yeah I
[2:24:27] want to see some five or six or seven
[2:24:29] services the devil beat up the devil
[2:24:35] until all the doubts fears unbelief
[2:24:38] afterwards let us save it now what devil
[2:24:40] what whatever you talking about
[2:24:42] right Tammy waters finish your connect
[2:24:44] with Nadi backbend and go already
[2:24:46] we had it gone no pink one because
[2:24:51] sinners unbelief and faith comes by
[2:24:53] hearing and as you hear the word you
[2:24:55] receive the world you Amanda word all of
[2:24:58] us endeavor I cried a I have to let go
[2:24:59] yes because I want to go before you
[2:25:01] speak let me leave before he ready
[2:25:05] recognize he could speak because even
[2:25:08] speak he could send me anywhere let me
[2:25:10] go I choose me I want to go yes I do
[2:25:12] need ever say seventy picks in a place
[2:25:13] just a mess any place because Jesus was
[2:25:17] in his position
[2:25:18] never has plead for mercy and please 770
[2:25:22] picks please because I didn't want you
[2:25:24] to set him somewhere else for a teacher
[2:25:28] feet and by the ground so ladies he said
[2:25:30] a moment the bride gets to know she is
[2:25:32] sit down Shelby Romo and that's what we
[2:25:38] are striving for to get a true
[2:25:39] revelation of who we are to get an
[2:25:43] understanding of who we are and how we
[2:25:45] can begin to walk in feet and
[2:25:47] demonstrate love and demonstrate
[2:25:49] forgiveness that's our message it's a
[2:25:52] life it's a testimony it's a live voice
[2:25:56] the musician Gary to come now when you
[2:26:01] recognize your day and your message then
[2:26:04] you can truly return unto the Lord we
[2:26:07] read in Scripture in Hosea return to the
[2:26:09] Lord remember he said that they would be
[2:26:11] scattered and they were but they'll
[2:26:12] return to the Lord after had they had
[2:26:15] been scattered Ezekiel saw the dry bones
[2:26:18] and he said can these bones live again
[2:26:21] now revived by the venom said doesn't
[2:26:24] mean resurrection he said I will revive
[2:26:26] as a measure of Iowa in the today he
[2:26:29] will revive us again after he scattered
[2:26:31] us so we are promised her revival Moses
[2:26:36] but a madam said he recognized his Dan
[2:26:38] is calling when he saw the promise of
[2:26:40] God's word for that they've indicated he
[2:26:42] knew them and realized what he was and
[2:26:45] what he was to do by the promise would
[2:26:47] and that's what we are looking for
[2:26:48] friends as Moses realized what he was
[2:26:52] and what he was to do by the woman he
[2:26:54] didn't fear what anybody said that's a
[2:26:57] prophets would he wasn't ashamed of his
[2:26:59] message though every priest and every
[2:27:02] fear Oh everything every authority
[2:27:04] disagreed with him but he recognized
[2:27:06] when he saw that light that pillar of
[2:27:08] fire hanging in that bush and spoke to
[2:27:11] him the wood that was promised for that
[2:27:13] day and said I've called you to do it he
[2:27:15] feared not the great threats of the King
[2:27:17] he went down to bring those people turn
[2:27:19] Exodus like the Word of God promised if
[2:27:25] the Jews only had recognized the
[2:27:27] promised sign of their Messiah according
[2:27:29] to their last prophet behold I send my
[2:27:31] messenger before my face and they
[2:27:34] claimed they were looking for him but it
[2:27:35] didn't recognize them what exactly are
[2:27:37] parallel till today they claim they are
[2:27:40] looking for something to happen the
[2:27:42] churches are all fasting and praying and
[2:27:44] now let us pray let us get together
[2:27:45] we've got to have an greeting happen he
[2:27:48] said we know there's something greater
[2:27:49] happened the church has got to get ready
[2:27:51] that's what they're praying about and I
[2:27:52] thought it was praying about there but
[2:27:54] he says you have to recognize it
[2:27:56] hallelujah they were looking for him by
[2:27:59] the bottom said and he was right there
[2:28:01] among them and friends he is here right
[2:28:04] now no need to look for him he is here
[2:28:09] he came to his prophet came to the world
[2:28:11] and his word is presented to you this
[2:28:13] morning with the words of the Prophet
[2:28:15] because we want to make sure and see it
[2:28:18] away the Prophet said it so it will not
[2:28:20] be an injection of man towards or ideas
[2:28:22] or coalition or trying to manipulate
[2:28:24] your mind be free to see plainly that
[2:28:27] this message is your message and it's a
[2:28:29] bring you to perfection to bring your
[2:28:31] family in to bring deliverance to you to
[2:28:34] give you hope to give you courage to
[2:28:36] give you confidence for you to be a
[2:28:37] conqueror in every area of your life
[2:28:40] we're gonna play something softly
[2:28:44] blessed be the name of the Lord the
[2:28:52] woman in the well recognize her but a
[2:28:55] sign of the Messiah she was in a bad
[2:28:58] shape she didn't want to fool with I'm
[2:29:00] all churches
[2:29:04] and to reveal to her the secret of a
[2:29:06] heart
[2:29:08] told her the sin that she was living him
[2:29:10] she said aye sir I perceive that your
[2:29:12] prophet now this is powerful friend
[2:29:14] because the Pharisees didn't recognize
[2:29:16] him
[2:29:16] the Sadducees didn't recognize him and a
[2:29:19] woman who the prophet said was living in
[2:29:21] a bad ship
[2:29:23] bad ship she was the one who recognized
[2:29:28] him the high priest didn't recognize him
[2:29:30] but the woman who had lived a messed-up
[2:29:33] life saw the word for the message of a
[2:29:39] day not just of her day but the message
[2:29:41] of every day because it was Jesus Christ
[2:29:43] Himself said I perceive that your
[2:29:46] prophet she had more revelation on the
[2:29:49] high priest he had more revelation and
[2:29:51] the pharisees and the sadducees and the
[2:29:52] e seams and the spiritual all of the day
[2:29:55] it had nothing to do with her spiritual
[2:29:57] condition it had to do all about that
[2:30:00] seed that was in her soul to see who
[2:30:04] Jesus was to recognize who she was and
[2:30:08] maybe there's somebody in here to be
[2:30:10] maybe you've been living all maybe
[2:30:13] wondering who you are and what you're
[2:30:15] supposed to do me this semester they
[2:30:16] give you a fresh vision of Calvary and
[2:30:19] of this message and who you are in God
[2:30:21] and may you fight for your portion like
[2:30:25] you have never done before let's all
[2:30:26] stand to our feet let me just bow our

[2:31:15] message the magnitude of the message
[2:31:17] that it's their message you send a
[2:31:20] prophet to deliver a powerful message
[2:31:22] the greatest message that the world has
[2:31:24] ever seen that tied up all the loose
[2:31:27] ends and brings us to this final climax
[2:31:30] this final showdown Lord and the enemy
[2:31:33] would fight any would try all he can to
[2:31:36] create distraction and create confusion
