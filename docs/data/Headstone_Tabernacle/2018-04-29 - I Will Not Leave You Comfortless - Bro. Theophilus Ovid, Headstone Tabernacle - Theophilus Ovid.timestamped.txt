[1:03:41] first John to region fools 1517 love not
[1:03:53] the world neither the things that are in
[1:03:56] the world
[1:03:57] If any man love the world the love of
[1:03:59] the father is not in him for all that is
[1:04:02] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[1:04:05] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:04:07] is not of the Father but is of the world
[1:04:11] and the world passeth away and the lust
[1:04:14] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[1:04:17] God abideth forever in our last
[1:04:21] scriptures from Hebrews chapter 10 for
[1:04:24] the law having a shadow of good things
[1:04:25] to come and not the very image of the
[1:04:27] things can never with do sacrifices
[1:04:30] which they offered year by year
[1:04:32] continually make the comers they aren't
[1:04:35] too perfect for then would they not have
[1:04:38] ceased to be offered because the
[1:04:40] worshipper once purged should have had
[1:04:42] no more conscious of sins but in those
[1:04:45] sacrifices dear is a remembrance again
[1:04:47] made of sins every year for it is not
[1:04:50] possible that the blood of bulls and
[1:04:51] goats should take of his sins wherefore

[1:20:27] God there's no burden faced were to be
[1:20:29] sewn still doing the work revival the
[1:20:45] people could get off their ships with a
[1:20:47] torn ass horn and they'd come and see a
[1:20:49] policeman swinging his club around on
[1:20:50] our own Ida and Swiss Lynne they say my
[1:20:52] good man could you tell me where the
[1:20:54] referee rival is you say yes sir you're
[1:20:56] starting in the middle of it because the
[1:21:00] Welsh revival is it me or glory that God
[1:21:03] or was that Englishman revival inside of
[1:21:06] him you must stand in the middle of it
[1:21:08] but that's what everyone are you ought
[1:21:10] to be
[1:21:12] opposed
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:17] yeah and come here just to get charged
[1:21:19] up you're coming to be a powerhouse when
[1:21:21] you leave earlier power I want to pray
[1:21:24] for the sick power the Casso devil's
[1:21:26] power to raise the dead power to
[1:21:29] overcome power to forgive volatile
[1:21:31] victory what a run endeavours and cast
[1:21:34] them out power way and stand in the
[1:21:36] street the devil said get out who is
[1:21:39] coming
[1:21:39] Oh glory to God you thought about that
[1:21:42] church on the match
[1:21:48] my that is sovereign that's what God
[1:21:51] does he alone has a right to sell a
[1:21:54] revival not get the mechanics together
[1:21:56] it is a pray for quarters and the
[1:21:58] dynamics oh man when the gospel the
[1:22:01] messages when you see the messages are
[1:22:03] nothing else matters
[1:22:06] the rest is just filler material you
[1:22:09] have to see the vision when you see it
[1:22:11] no man could fool you look bloody
[1:22:13] Couture up it's like an open vision open
[1:22:16] up to you you know what you're looking
[1:22:17] for
[1:22:18] praise God Jesus in His resurrection
[1:22:20] ministry appear to his disciples in a
[1:22:24] private ministry to his elect it was not
[1:22:27] among this among that among the other
[1:22:29] everybody wasn't seeing him caught my
[1:22:33] god I feel like shouting praise God
[1:22:35] hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord a
[1:22:38] show give the Lord a show that
[1:22:41] resurrection ministry wasn't for
[1:22:44] everybody
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:53] you may be seasoned because Jesus was
[1:22:56] gone in seed on the resurrection to them
[1:22:58] so watch before they had faith but when
[1:23:02] they raised from the dead was a
[1:23:03] different kind of faith it was a
[1:23:04] resurrection fate now they know this man
[1:23:06] that we believe in he is not dead he's
[1:23:08] rarely a life now he's not feeding the
[1:23:10] multitude and raising the dead he's not
[1:23:12] doing that he's come to tell these guys
[1:23:14] who they are he come to listen he come
[1:23:16] to teach them and positionally place
[1:23:18] them into what they supposed to receive
[1:23:21] how they're supposed to receive it and
[1:23:23] they knew exactly what they were
[1:23:25] supposed to receive so when he finished
[1:23:27] with him open it understanding and open
[1:23:30] the scriptures they were properly
[1:23:31] empowered by vision marry all of them
[1:23:34] all the brethren they had revelation so
[1:23:38] they returned to Jerusalem with great

[1:35:08] because if he cannot touch us he ever
[1:35:10] touches a long time ago when we break a
[1:35:12] certain barrier no you want to hit the
[1:35:14] strong barrier or glow in a god you may
[1:35:16] be seated
[1:35:17] you see when God was moving in power
[1:35:19] sands was woman in power so when God
[1:35:21] made one move science made the motorcar
[1:35:24] that was one power isn't that right Sam
[1:35:27] Ephraim horse and buggy to motorcar
[1:35:29] so hands was increasing in power there's
[1:35:32] a motorcar they went to aeroplane but
[1:35:34] then from airplane to rent astronaut so
[1:35:36] as SAS was increasing quad was
[1:35:38] increasing from luta to Wesley the
[1:35:41] Pentecost and then bringing Branham come
[1:35:43] and take us home out in space
[1:35:47] or glory to God no the aeroplane you can
[1:35:49] see it put your eyes but when you're
[1:35:52] blasting dismiss all it is you smoke
[1:35:55] I'm tell you something up there and that
[1:35:58] is what gonna happen to us this morning
[1:35:59] just smoke we didn't wait to see this
[1:36:12] morning
[1:36:13] hallelujah breathe so when Noah coops Oi
[1:36:18] nothing else matter when John Cooper saw
[1:36:21] it nothing else matter when Jesus group
[1:36:23] saw it nothing mattered watch and they
[1:36:26] pull away from everything why the
[1:36:28] foreknowledge HEPA destiny things to
[1:36:29] happen he chooses his person by his
[1:36:32] foreknowledge he said in Romans that the
[1:36:35] election of God might stand ensure that
[1:36:37] Esau and Jacob both born of holy parents
[1:36:39] twins and his election might stand true
[1:36:41] onshore is a hate Esau and I loved Jacob
[1:36:44] before either the boy was born so this
[1:36:52] kink in eternity coltain that give God
[1:36:58] the opportunity to display service
[1:37:00] actually she could not have displayed in
[1:37:03] this thing called time time of a
[1:37:06] beginning therefore time has an ending
[1:37:08] this thing called time
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:14] it's a deception I'll call it the timed
[1:37:17] assumption and I think you have time and
[1:37:20] you don't have it and time runs out
[1:37:24] so Jesus God brought himself couldn't
[1:37:27] stay in eternity he had to come down on
[1:37:28] a body called time that body called
[1:37:30] Jesus sat down on the earth because
[1:37:32] there are the Kingsmen to redeem us one
[1:37:34] like us so I could call it an angel
[1:37:37] angel ascend all that I said the others
[1:37:39] get kicked out them is trouble guys
[1:37:41] and them trouble guys fall upon the
[1:37:43] earth but injured becoming battle of men
[1:37:45] so we have issues here needed no because
[1:37:47] of them for ninjas and those that did
[1:37:52] not fall represented us because we were
[1:37:55] nothing back there yet we were just in
[1:37:57] that gene thought inside earlier and
[1:37:59] that gene thought is what inside of you
[1:38:01] has a seed so what put that in your soul
[1:38:04] so I don't care where you were he had to
[1:38:06] find you
[1:38:06] you could be Hindu Muslim Baptist
[1:38:08] Methodist your witness it doesn't matter
[1:38:09] once that seal insider they're gone at
[1:38:12] the final because all that the father
[1:38:14] had past tense given me will come so go
[1:38:17] and have to give you to him before when
[1:38:19] I had a child who I had trouble before
[1:38:22] the foundation of the world you were
[1:38:23] chosen in him you don't hear me respond
[1:38:27] when when you chose me before when were
[1:38:30] you chosen before this wasn't we're in
[1:38:32] him to be in him they were chosen before
[1:38:36] you have to go back into him Oh glory of
[1:38:39] God you are going to go back into him
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:45] boy so because of the sin because of the
[1:38:48] fall we felt trapped to five senses lost

[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:08] Stephen give a trim bonus leaving about
[1:50:10] tremendous of rotation and permission
[1:50:11] until tonight we had a scripture of
[1:50:14] Jesus going and a widowed woman lost her
[1:50:16] only Son
[1:50:17] her son was dead and Jesus the Bible
[1:50:20] said had compassion compassion and he
[1:50:24] went on touch the power and present the
[1:50:26] son back to the widow woman and I just
[1:50:32] discover something about IQ and EQ IQ is
[1:50:36] what intelligent Kushan to dinner cornet
[1:50:38] eq's emotional quotient IQ people up in
[1:50:42] the IQ dive high the brains high they
[1:50:44] get calculator sort of stuff or whatnot
[1:50:45] but sometimes happy with high IQ and low
[1:50:47] EQ low an emotional response low an
[1:50:55] emotional compassion their self-centered
[1:50:58] and selfish because having compassion
[1:51:01] means that you could actually step into
[1:51:03] somebody's shoes when Berlin was in
[1:51:06] India and they was worshipping his son
[1:51:08] and so on and Ellen came up to him and
[1:51:10] he's blind and he had no shoes on the
[1:51:12] first thing my mom did was to measure
[1:51:14] his shoes to see if he could get the
[1:51:15] money shoes so he are a high EQ to feel
[1:51:23] for people
[1:51:27] he said that's why you have to
[1:51:28] end-to-end so I recognize people with
[1:51:29] low tech morning it will not even get
[1:51:31] for that you have no compassion or
[1:51:34] healing and Jesus a name and next like
[1:51:39] you say you've heard some kind of
[1:51:41] machine where you know have to have that
[1:51:47] compassion there's a woman we talk this
[1:51:50] story before she was sitting next to a
[1:51:51] woman and she had a child that was sick
[1:51:53] and the woman next door just felt let
[1:51:55] the pray for the baby she they can I
[1:51:56] prefer a child you know I should pray
[1:51:59] for the child she had a prayer card she
[1:52:01] came up to the platform to butter brown
[1:52:03] and Balram says a woman next to you pray
[1:52:07] for your child I was healed he said God
[1:52:09] saw that won't have more compassion than
[1:52:10] me God saw you had more compassion and
[1:52:16] put it upon that woman to pray you see
[1:52:18] what it is being able to put yourself in
[1:52:21] the person's please on the matter
[1:52:26] [Applause]
[1:52:32] Jesus what is widow woman she already
[1:52:35] lost her husband no she lost her only
[1:52:37] Son he had compassion not talk did you
[1:52:42] drink last night woman all this kind of
[1:52:48] thing people try no and with purposes
[1:52:50] and I never see just interview people do
[1:52:51] OB neelanand
[1:52:53] all he said i feit had me dijo look the
[1:52:57] lepers God know whatever I was doing all
[1:52:59] the time
[1:53:03] he said go on shoes of the priests good
[1:53:06] thing good thing they're comin silly
[1:53:07] hands you don't touch my purse he says
[1:53:10] he said go a choice of the degrees
[1:53:11] keep on walking brothers keep on walking
[1:53:14] while they were going directly they were
[1:53:17] healed
[1:53:18] simple they never reach the priests one
[1:53:21] came back hotel now you see where the
[1:53:24] rest he said your feet meet you who
[1:53:27] that's why there are people with seeds
[1:53:29] in them and they are the one going on a
[1:53:31] baptize but the Holy Ghost because they
[1:53:35] have something in them you see the rest
[1:53:37] the money went on and clean to celebrate
[1:53:38] that they get healed but this one come
[1:53:40] back to worship this one come back to
[1:53:42] give God praise this one had something
[1:53:45] inside of them and I'm telling if you
[1:53:46] are something inside of you you won't
[1:53:47] give the right response
[1:53:49] [Applause]
[1:53:51] the woman at the well she has something
[1:53:54] in her that she didn't even know her
[1:53:56] neighbors didn't even know she was doing
[1:53:59] a prostitution business and live in all
[1:54:00] kind of life why because when I'm said
[1:54:02] listen isn't the profit by vision I
[1:54:04] believe he said the woman had nobody as
[1:54:06] the head to feed her family she was
[1:54:08] living a certain way to magnet children
[1:54:10] so he went in a three-room he could see
[1:54:13] that but watch or something beyond that
[1:54:15] he saw a season that woman that needed
[1:54:18] to be unfolded that one was at genuine
[1:54:20] daughter of God we got so we didn't
[1:54:22] leave us and the people say if you go by
[1:54:24] what the people say you wouldn't see or
[1:54:25] feel this way in that way but when jesus
[1:54:27] what a woman hallelujah

[1:56:12] that they got somebody to replace Judas
[1:56:14] on the church by the turning their key
[1:56:16] they went then choose a man called
[1:56:18] Matias and that was the elected one I
[1:56:20] guess the body cast votes symbol metas
[1:56:22] fine brother but God choose a little
[1:56:25] hope no sarcastic high-tempered Jew
[1:56:27] named Paul to be number 12
[1:56:31] oh praise the name of the Lord isn't
[1:56:35] that right that man Paul that was sold
[1:56:38] to Interpol he wasn't easy you know that
[1:56:41] tough guy persecuting Christians right
[1:56:43] so long the five senses you said not
[1:56:45] that man he can get confused I can
[1:56:47] change he finished sharp that people
[1:56:52] like to see shocked it is it is love I
[1:56:55] give them a shock experts are giving it
[1:56:57] exposed who shot Lucy but Paul was a
[1:57:00] seed Oh hallelujah
[1:57:03] disguise in whatever formulas in the
[1:57:06] church so you cannot know what God is
[1:57:08] guys as see does she have to treat
[1:57:11] people with respect son treat people
[1:57:12] with dignity on chipping or kindest you
[1:57:15] don't know what seed is behind me
[1:57:17] see people like all of them are seeds of
[1:57:19] God because you don't know but soar
[1:57:21] became Paul an apostle my prophet he's
[1:57:24] done right so he's talking about David
[1:57:26] and David now got excited to bring back
[1:57:28] the ark and he consult his men and
[1:57:31] consult the people everything else but
[1:57:33] Nathan was a profit on each and the
[1:57:35] revelation didn't come to David
[1:57:36] derivation come to David but David never
[1:57:38] consulted neat and isn't that right so
[1:57:41] then he wasn't or team to do that
[1:57:44] David been inspired watch and the spirit
[1:57:47] come and anoint the person and still
[1:57:49] it's out of the will of God
[1:57:50] so it's proved we have to be we have to
[1:57:52] go to God's ways not our way it is God's
[1:57:55] Way of doing it
[1:57:56] here is why watch now how close it gets
[1:58:01] that reason H now between right and
[1:58:02] wrong remember it will fall on one or
[1:58:05] the other side did it come down to a
[1:58:07] honed razor wind if insane
[1:58:11] and wrong it's got to be every word Oh
[1:58:15] hallelujah praise God we are not living
[1:58:18] in a Pentecostal age now we're living in
[1:58:21] a wood age where everything had to be
[1:58:23] examined by the word so when you hear me
[1:58:25] say we check it out man an angel be
[1:58:27] serious about that men could claim
[1:58:29] whoever they want to clean let me say
[1:58:31] bring it on come let me check it out
[1:58:33] hindi backing out see because this has
[1:58:35] to be the world
[1:58:36] so listen sin is rejecting the revealed
[1:58:41] will of God
[1:58:42] that's what sinners rejecting the
[1:58:46] reveals will of God as we say we are
[1:58:49] born in sin we are sinners so when we
[1:58:50] sin that was in us do sinasohn that is
[1:58:54] not the issue with God because we were
[1:58:56] born in sin shape iniquity we weren't
[1:58:58] contaminated that is what we will do
[1:59:00] that's that's normal the the thing that
[1:59:03] God is feeling to come out of your sin
[1:59:06] or feeling sakamoto that unbelief
[1:59:08] when our way is made for you that's the
[1:59:11] difference your behavior is
[1:59:12] understandable because of your how you
[1:59:15] were born but when the word comes to say
[1:59:17] listen this away forever you know
[1:59:19] it's clear you need to repent you need
[1:59:21] to get things in order and workman does
[1:59:23] truly bless you he read this fast
[1:59:25] angel to escort you he would help you he
[1:59:27] would minister to you and you
[1:59:29] turn that down that is in the truest
[1:59:32] sense so sin is rejecting the reveal
[1:59:34] will have God sin in this initial form
[1:59:36] is to reject the revealed Word of God
[1:59:39] God's will the will of God when God
[1:59:42] reveals something on his will to reject
[1:59:44] that is to blaspheme or to reject God
[1:59:48] and a church would feel but I never will
[1:59:51] a church field never will a program feel
[1:59:53] as long as those who are in charge stay
[1:59:56] in the center of God's will God will is
[2:00:00] perfect and everything will fall right
[2:00:02] into its place if you see in God's will
[2:00:05] but get out of their will if you're sure
[2:00:07] the whole program off remember
[2:00:09] Ekans wedge you have to move out of one
[2:00:11] place and praise the name of the Lord
[2:00:13] let's continue from adoption the mystery
[2:00:16] of Israel now remember no it is not just
[2:00:19] a little thing it's a mystery
[2:00:22] God's will is a mystery and each man
[2:00:26] here we go has to seek out the will of
[2:00:29] God for his or her yourself so when you
[2:00:32] see that out then you get a sense of
[2:00:33] purpose then you don't want to commit
[2:00:35] suicide you don't want to give up you
[2:00:37] don't want to let go cut off your info
[2:00:39] frustrated and I fed up I can't take it
[2:00:41] no more you will come on that act
[2:00:43] because you'll connect the Romans 8:28
[2:00:45] all things work together for good
[2:00:47] yeah I wonder what heaven to escape your
[2:00:50] trials down here Oh God
[2:00:51] bring heaven quick heaven quick that'd
[2:00:56] be my mid-90s me7 in a minister's
[2:00:59] conference and brothers and thing like
[2:01:00] that I better stop and say you know he
[2:01:02] was taught we all know so in a
[2:01:04] millennium and I watching this little
[2:01:05] brothers and I was astonished that time
[2:01:08] I'm a daddy vote maybe 18 to 19 years
[2:01:10] old and I ask myself what is he talking
[2:01:13] about because it books I read so far has
[2:01:16] so much promises that has not yet been
[2:01:18] fulfilled
[2:01:19] millennium I don't wanna millennium yet
[2:01:21] come on this interval Philip
[2:01:24] I remember and schoolteachers tears
[2:01:26] tears tears teachers used to tell me is
[2:01:28] it over
[2:01:29] you said I'm you know Christian and I'm
[2:01:31] the only one to just go to heaven with
[2:01:32] him I said no I wanna go to hell - stay
[2:01:34] here and be a testimony the field we
[2:01:38] want to escape escape this and escape
[2:01:41] that no we want to be here to live won't
[2:01:43] you have to be a witness at genuine
[2:01:46] witness of God hallelujah
[2:01:49] so each man have to seek out the will of
[2:01:52] God for this life no you have to be
[2:01:55] persistent to achieve something and all
[2:01:57] men through the ages has been persistent
[2:01:59] and Noor was persistent after he had
[2:02:02] from the will of God so when you find a
[2:02:05] will of God then you could Jam things
[2:02:07] then you can say devil you can't stop
[2:02:09] you from going there because this is
[2:02:11] God's will

[2:02:14] mountain you will climb it there's a sea

[2:02:20] God's will for your life it's cause will
[2:02:23] that you be in good health

[2:04:04] people to bring his church together to
[2:04:06] bring a church to a place far beyond the
[2:04:09] Lutheran far beyond the Methodist family
[2:04:11] on the Pentecostal into a place of
[2:04:13] adoption and rapture in Greece oh my oh
[2:04:17] my oh my you see the Pentecostals they
[2:04:21] will preach too blessed to be stressed
[2:04:22] food or whatever I say all the

[2:04:25] things to bless the distress and the
[2:04:27] money gospel and and blessings of God
[2:04:29] and God multiplying on what none area

[2:08:14] what happened here our human spirit
[2:08:16] breaks up and her soul is coming forward
[2:08:18] down and the soul is subconscious to

[2:23:13] if you become born in a
[2:23:14] your family you are son and part of your
[2:23:17] father and when sin came in we found out
[2:23:20] that man caused the chasm and the blood
[2:23:22] of bulls and goats covered but did not
[2:23:23] remit until the rich bleached under it
[2:23:26] until the real bleach came that could
[2:23:28] take the stain of sin and brick
[2:23:29] completed pieces when it got back to
[2:23:31] Satan he wastes his time of eternal
[2:23:33] inhalation no I believe here we go that
[2:23:37] sin will be broke up and when it's
[2:23:40] confessed upon the basis of the blood of
[2:23:43] Jesus it's like dropping a blood of
[2:23:44] black ink in a bunch of Clorox bleach it
[2:23:47] just breaks it into the chemicals and
[2:23:49] sends it plumb back the way it comes
[2:23:51] from and that's the way the blood of
[2:23:53] Jesus does that sets a man across the
[2:23:56] chasm again as a son of God Oh glory to
[2:23:59] God you get what you see in here when
[2:24:02] your sin is broken up it sets you back
[2:24:05] as a son of God that's why bronzer you
[2:24:08] had a sinless with yours bride of Jesus
[2:24:10] Christ because the blood of Jesus breaks
[2:24:13] up that thing towards sin
[2:24:15] [Applause]
[2:24:18] and frees you from the prison of the
[2:24:23] fall from the prison of salvation from
[2:24:25] that and bring you back into glorious
[2:24:27] sonship that you have access to the
[2:24:30] Father hope with the Lord a show when
[2:24:36] Adam fell angels was God in the access
[2:24:39] angel was got in the Tree of Life
[2:24:41] but no the Prophet said engine up
[2:24:44] driving the sons back to have access Oh
[2:24:47] glory to God let me finish this off here
[2:24:50] watch then a man sets across this chasm
[2:24:53] again a son of God then he becomes watch
[2:24:55] the creative power of God is in him and
[2:24:58] at least whenever God can command it to
[2:25:01] be done it will be done and we get back
[2:25:03] and when Moses here we go under the
[2:25:06] blood of bulls when he met that light
[2:25:08] that pillar of fire in the burning bush
[2:25:09] he stood there on the commission go
[2:25:12] ahead give him and he was a prophet and
[2:25:14] when the world Lord came to him he spoke
[2:25:16] and even things were created by the word
[2:25:18] know if it will do that under the blood
[2:25:23] of bulls what about the blood of Jesus
[2:25:25] not only covered but remit this all
[2:25:28] together you stand in the presence of
[2:25:32] God as a redeemed son or glory no God we
[2:25:35] see the churches far beyond this planet
[2:25:38] of little you can live higher than that
[2:25:41] you can be better than that you cannot
[2:25:43] do better
[2:25:50] [Applause]
[2:25:54] what am i said 'mom but I have sophiana
[2:25:59] so don't think I'm trying to escape and
[2:26:03] go home I have stuff here we could spend
[2:26:06] two more was it I always have stuff I'm
[2:26:09] a loaded all right we try to make all
[2:26:15] witnesses excuses we want to tell how
[2:26:17] big we are how great we are so that is
[2:26:19] why some people kinda laugh at they
[2:26:20] oneself there is to embarrass I like
[2:26:23] when you can laugh at yourself if you
[2:26:25] can't laugh at yourself you have a
[2:26:26] problem no I'm sorry I don't mean to
[2:26:31] offend anybody laugh at me system
[2:26:39] laughing we are human Oh mine is the
[2:26:44] grace of God we are here and we are
[2:26:46] grateful to God amen
[2:26:49] so watch we want to tell how big we are
[2:26:51] how great we are
[2:26:52] I think that's one of the things that I
[2:26:53] go out give me this text for was to get
[2:26:56] that out of our mind these little things
[2:26:59] that we do and that is what we come to
[2:27:01] church for is the final way of forges
[2:27:04] and the things that we might better
[2:27:05] ourselves fine if we come to church for
[2:27:07] any other purpose I'm afraid we won't
[2:27:09] get too much I'm afraid you won't get
[2:27:11] too much coming to church we come to
[2:27:13] find our weaknesses
[2:27:14] final bad places whole Co little BR and
[2:27:17] put our trust and somewhere that strong
[2:27:19] there's so many of us like a testify or
[2:27:22] like the thing that we are insufficient
[2:27:24] and therefore we make this an excuse I
[2:27:25] have no education I have no ability
[2:27:27] unable to do this if you key that up to
[2:27:30] do that way keep going like that then
[2:27:32] you'll won't amount anything but the
[2:27:34] very thing that we make excuses by our
[2:27:36] weaknesses
[2:27:37] God uses that's everything to tackle the
[2:27:41] job wait he waits for us to get to that
[2:27:44] condition so he can use us so what have
[2:27:47] a way of Sandler's true stuff two
[2:27:49] strippers and stripping us I call it a
[2:27:52] kink or brick in your human spirit
[2:27:55] - given we forgot to break inside of you
[2:27:58] because in your human spirit you are
[2:28:00] strong God made you that way you could
[2:28:03] achieve you could do a switch stuff
[2:28:05] without God so forgot to come in
[2:28:07] something else to kind of get messed up
[2:28:09] tripped up laptop whatever it is and in
[2:28:12] that messed up thing where you get
[2:28:15] broken I am broken in that way God could
[2:28:19] actually come in and do something for
[2:28:22] you then you know oh my it's God this is
[2:28:25] not me no more praise God is the Lord
[2:28:29] Oh hallelujah we find the excuses I
[2:28:33] can't do this
[2:28:34] I'm insufficient I can't do that that's
[2:28:36] the reason he chooses us because we are
[2:28:38] in that condition I know that sounds
[2:28:41] strange but we find out as we read in
[2:28:44] that weaknesses and rejections we find
[2:28:47] that those people are the weakest and
[2:28:49] rejected by the outside world is God
[2:28:51] heroes that's conquer
[2:28:53] that's why brother man says Samson
[2:28:55] wasn't this big muscular man that popped
[2:28:57] up in the gym he was a little freaking
[2:28:59] fella it's prickly guy so that's it what
[2:29:02] make it more supernatural
[2:29:03] how come a small guy with all the big
[2:29:05] muscle impression on fellas when they
[2:29:06] pump up the elevators Uzi so surely must
[2:29:08] resolve they do how do pump up and I'm
[2:29:10] not sure in his out Samson had none to
[2:29:12] show go he wasn't pop up but the state
[2:29:15] would come upon him and this spirit is
[2:29:18] strong so we're not on the more you know
[2:29:22] that's why it's not you're you're weak
[2:29:24] and that that you know is you need the
[2:29:26] spirit I want to speak up on you Hannah
[2:29:29] weak talk or glory to God the cast
[2:29:32] Daniel them Lions then lion hungry lions
[2:29:35] if that lands just get fed under they
[2:29:38] ignore human lunch he's hungry land and
[2:29:42] hungry lion they can handle fire so fire
[2:29:45] was a wrong Daniel he said what was
[2:29:47] inside and came out so fire was he was
[2:29:50] fire protective
[2:29:51] lion is afraid of fire trying to go
[2:29:53] hungry is this matter than that
[2:29:56] keep your hunger at bay brother Hogue
[2:29:58] Lord is inspire here
[2:30:00] the cab bites not mine fire is here or
[2:30:03] glory of God these guys decide the five
[2:30:06] senses and if you have to get anywhere
[2:30:08] with God you have to define your
[2:30:10] feelings your senses your emotions
[2:30:13] oh poor Enoch God hallelujah glory glory
[2:30:16] man praise God
[2:30:19] so there was a Methodist brother three
[2:30:21] of them come to this church they said to
[2:30:22] me Nadal go brother Branham we just
[2:30:24] received the Holy Ghost no do we see
[2:30:26] gifts for the ministry I said don't do
[2:30:27] it
[2:30:27] let it alone he's telling me I read a
[2:30:29] certain brother told us that we after we
[2:30:31] see the Holy Ghost we just see gifts
[2:30:32] he's ambach and I said become a stuffed
[2:30:34] shirt if you notice it's always those
[2:30:37] who trying to get away from it is who
[2:30:38] God uses as long as a man wants to do
[2:30:41] something and thinks he got enough
[2:30:42] ability can do the job over God can't
[2:30:44] use that man don't see nothing
[2:30:46] God's cutting me for you he give it to
[2:30:48] you oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:30:50] hallelujah now we take the weakened son
[2:30:54] rejected practi every hero of God in the
[2:30:56] front line having that have a person a
[2:30:58] president rejected opposing the thought
[2:31:00] he was insufficient a person who had no
[2:31:02] ability then that's supposing just in
[2:31:04] good shape for God to stop using them
[2:31:05] then they feel like they cut they have
[2:31:08] nothing anyone all right so just so
[2:31:10] watch when we are insufficient ourselves
[2:31:12] then we subject to yield to go out
[2:31:14] spirit as long as we think we can do it
[2:31:16] then we can't do it but when we get to a
[2:31:18] place where we know we can't do it then
[2:31:20] we yield ourselves to God and he does it
[2:31:23] so then it was a strength we will feel
[2:31:25] but if we give ourselves to God then God
[2:31:28] cannot feel Oh glory to God hallelujah
[2:31:32] there's the power I wanna get to our
[2:31:34] clothes the important thing one of the
[2:31:38] important things we must master and
[2:31:42] especially you young preachers
[2:31:43] lead members alike there's one thing we
[2:31:46] have got to master if we expect the
[2:31:48] fulfill God's design our life is the
[2:31:50] master a sort of human ability if we
[2:31:52] ever get to a spot we think we can do it
[2:31:55] with our own intelligence own abilities
[2:31:58] we've got the master in such a way that
[2:32:00] we can get rid of the thing later side
[2:32:02] so go I can use us and make a complete
[2:32:05] surrender we cannot use one ability we
[2:32:08] cannot you make we got to make a
[2:32:10] complete surrender that
[2:32:11] come to God you've got the surrender to
[2:32:13] him body soul and spirit everything you

[2:54:58] standard raising time when it will not
[2:55:01] be your efforts it would not be your
[2:55:03] ability but will be God Himself raising
[2:55:05] the standard by taking the same word
[2:55:08] that we have had for all of these years
[2:55:10] and making it more positive making it
[2:55:12] more present answers we never saw it

[2:57:40] be a special two services come under
[2:57:43] great expectations and we are rapidly
[2:57:47] closing in on the convention friends
[2:57:50] this is the end of April we just have
[2:57:52] two months May June and the convention
[2:57:55] is at hand just a reminder of two things
[2:57:58] one is we continue to solicit your
[2:58:00] support for the convention and also very
[2:58:03] important this year will be different we
[2:58:06] are looking to have seven services for
[2:58:08] this convention so on Friday there'll
[2:58:10] actually be three services on Friday so
[2:58:13] we want to encourage you to make every
[2:58:15] effort if you need to apply for your
[2:58:18] vacation now we advise you to do so but
[2:58:21] we do not want you to miss the blessing
[2:58:23] and the opportunity as believers we'll
[2:58:25] be flying in from far and wide to be
[2:58:28] here for this great Jubilee revival and
[2:58:31] I believe in my heart friends that we
[2:58:33] don't have much time left I don't know
[2:58:35] how you feel but I really don't believe
[2:58:37] we have much time left overnight the
[2:58:42] world will change overnight you know and
[2:58:46] in looking at the news and recent
[2:58:48] developments we see North Korea and
[2:58:50] South Korea coming together and having
[2:58:52] meetings and I said you know the world
[2:58:54] is rapidly getting into place where the
[2:58:57] kings of the earth would make peace and
[2:58:59] they'll come into the World Order and
[2:59:02] the World Council of Churches love
[2:59:03] everybody peace with everybody and and
[2:59:06] everybody will come together and then
[2:59:08] the world will unite against Israel and
[2:59:10] that's the last battle that has to come
[2:59:12] everything is already coming into place
[2:59:15] with that great battle but before that
[2:59:17] can unfold the bride has to be caught up
[2:59:20] in a rapture
[2:59:21] we are not supposed to be witnesses of
[2:59:23] that great battle we are supposed to be
[2:59:25] gone before that great battle so the
[2:59:27] world is moving things into position
[2:59:29] news is following it and but that's not
[2:59:31] our sign our sign is the word and our
[2:59:33] sign is a vindicated prophet that walk
[2:59:37] this earth that brought a message of
[2:59:38] life truth and clarity and don't let the
[2:59:41] devil your bills your problems your
[2:59:43] commitments your education your studies
[2:59:46] it doesn't matter it's all key to go to
[2:59:47] school and study and get qualified but
[2:59:50] don't miss the purpose the great purpose
[2:59:52] in God that he placed you here to prove
[2:59:55] to the devil that you will not be like
[2:59:58] Eve you will not be distracted you will
[3:00:01] not be deceived but we are brought to
[3:00:03] such a time as this to give the devil a
[3:00:06] knockout punch before we leave here I
[3:00:09] always believe we're not gonna leave who
[3:00:11] glad I made it that's not gonna be your
[3:00:14] testimony I'm gonna leave knowing I put
[3:00:16] dismissed in the devil's face because
[3:00:19] I'm a son of God and for every person
[3:00:22] who was sick defeated oppressed we will
[3:00:25] take that back and way to warn every
[3:00:27] demon on every Philistine on every
[3:00:30] Hittite champion side whatever it is
[3:00:32] that's my promise
[3:00:34] that's your promise that's your
[3:00:35] testimony can the church same in
[3:00:39] Oh hallelujah one of these things we try
[3:00:43] to close out and have another surface
[3:00:45] I'm warming up get ready for it it's
[3:00:49] going to happen because one day we're
[3:00:51] gonna break from time is eternity and
[3:00:54] the bank will look for your mortgage
[3:00:55] payment but you'll be gone they could
[3:00:57] take the mortgage and the house but
[3:00:59] we'll be gone and the doctor will look
[3:01:01] for you for your regular appointment but
[3:01:04] you won't be there because you would
[3:01:05] have been changed from water to
[3:01:07] immortality no more pills no more
[3:01:10] doctor's visit no more high blood
[3:01:13] pressure normal low blood pressure but
[3:01:15] you'll be in the image of God sons and
[3:01:18] daughters of God restored back to
[3:01:21] fellowship with God and the church amen
[3:01:25] can we get a shout of praise can we give
[3:01:28] God a shout of praise no more sickness
[3:01:31] no more sadness no more depression no
[3:01:35] more frustration no more sins no more
[3:01:37] temptation
[3:01:41] you may be seated
[3:01:44] [Applause]
[3:01:46] closing announcements we close another
[3:01:48] little different today Redis even I let
[3:01:50] somebody say this week God will test
[3:01:53] every claim that you made so when you
[3:01:56] say I'm a Christian he has to tested
[3:01:58] because a lot of stalkers out there so
[3:02:00] when you say I'm a believer he has a
[3:02:02] right to test it to test how much you
[3:02:04] believe so he draws something your way
[3:02:07] to see if your declaration will be
[3:02:09] backed up by your actions somebody help
[3:02:11] me this morning
[3:02:12] you say you got in the rapture heels
[3:02:15] just stuff your way the test to see if
[3:02:17] your declaration lines up with your
[3:02:20] testimony
[3:02:22] so the sufferings of this time I'm not
[3:02:26] worthy to be compared with the glory
[3:02:29] that shall be revealed in us there's a
[3:02:32] coming glory that is whatever reveal in
[3:02:34] you there's a glory over your head a
[3:02:37] glory over your house a glory for your
[3:02:41] life a glory will be revealed in you
[3:02:44] [Applause]
[3:02:47] we're still closing
[3:02:49] when I can't wait for the dealer we
[3:02:51] don't have to close no more oh god help
[3:02:53] us
[3:02:55] you may be seated I'll leave one one
[3:02:59] last note with you the Bible said that
[3:03:01] Jesus died for the propitiation and that
[3:03:06] word predation has a double meaning
[3:03:12] [Music]
[3:03:13] it means to restore but they're two
[3:03:16] sides of it
[3:03:17] if Gideon lends me a glass bowl and I go
[3:03:23] with the ball and the ball breaks I
[3:03:27] could choose to buy back the ball and
[3:03:30] return it to him but that only restores
[3:03:33] the ball
[3:03:35] many times when stuff happens not only
[3:03:39] the ball was damaged but if it was a
[3:03:41] special ball to him the relationship
[3:03:44] could have also been damaged because the
[3:03:47] ball is a special ball so even though I
[3:03:49] give him back the ball the relationship
[3:03:52] we had before it broke needs to be
[3:03:54] restored also so when Jesus died he
[3:03:57] didn't just try to clean up your sins
[3:04:00] and to bring back the pieces of your
[3:04:02] life the relationship that you were born
[3:04:06] to have by his blood by his blood he
[3:04:12] destroyed your family he destroyed your
[3:04:14] house here is sodium fellowship he was
[3:04:17] told you access to the spiritual things
[3:04:20] of God
[3:04:23] give the Lord a shout of praise Mira
[3:04:26] Lord bless you God rejoice in this week
[3:04:29] knowing you are born to put your foot on
[3:04:32] the devil's neck give the Lord a shout
[3:04:35] of praise you may be seated us as
[3:04:39] deacons hallelujah we saw the Living God
[3:04:53] [Applause]
[3:05:09] [Music]
[3:05:10] rusty Kelly maybe seasons
[3:05:13] I will praise
[3:05:17] [Music]
[3:05:31] we'll bring
[3:05:34] I know that through the trials our
[3:05:41] bracelet
[3:05:45] wanna say
[3:05:47] like you
[3:05:56] grace that
[3:06:00] heaven ours
[3:06:04] I can't repay
