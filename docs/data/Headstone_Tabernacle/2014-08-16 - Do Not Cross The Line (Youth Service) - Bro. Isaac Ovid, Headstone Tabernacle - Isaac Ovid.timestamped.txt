[2:26] to have the energy to have something on
[2:28] the inside and brought you here tonight
[2:32] to hear from God Amen blessed be the
[2:35] name of the Lord how many appreciate
[2:36] brother Andrew amen how many appreciate
[2:40] brother stepen with the
[2:41] music amen wonderful what I like to
[2:45] welcome you all in the precious name of
[2:48] the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated
[2:50] for a
[2:51] minute it's certainly a great honor to
[2:53] be in the house of God tonight for this
[2:56] special youth service and I believe it's
[3:00] truly a special service for all of us
[3:02] and I know that God is going to do
[3:04] something tremendous in the lives of the
[3:07] young people here tonight you know and
[3:10] uh some of you may already have seen it
[3:12] on our Facebook account but I put up the
[3:16] inspiration for this hug service so that
[3:19] you can meditate on it even before you
[3:21] reach here you know and in this world
[3:24] that we're living in the enemy is on the
[3:27] attack and we have a choice we allow the
[3:30] enemy to gain ground or we push the
[3:32] enemy back and we gain ground so I
[3:34] believe that the time has come for us to
[3:36] gain ground and do whatever is in our
[3:39] power to make a difference to make a
[3:41] change I'm tired of seeing young people
[3:44] just backslide I'm tired of seeing young
[3:46] people just give up hope I'm tired of
[3:48] seeing young people just move wherever
[3:50] the wind blows them and I believe the
[3:52] time has come for us to fight and for us
[3:54] to fight back so I encourage you for a
[3:57] long time I am also guilty in a sense of
[4:01] blasting Facebook and there are many
[4:03] things about Facebook that I don't like
[4:05] there are many things about Facebook
[4:06] that I still want to blast but there are
[4:08] also some positive State as well I
[4:11] always say a knife can be used to cut
[4:14] piece of meat or cut bread and but the
[4:16] bread that same knife could be used to
[4:17] kill somebody so in a certain sense is
[4:20] about how you use the tools that are
[4:22] available to us and I believe that our
[4:26] Facebook page is a way for us
[4:28] particularly the young people to be kept
[4:30] a breast of what's going on and to have
[4:32] the opportunity to express yourself some
[4:34] of you are too afraid to testify and
[4:36] stand up and talk about Jesus but at
[4:38] least you could put a comment and say I
[4:39] love Jesus somebody say Amen am amen so
[4:45] um everybody feeling fine amen everybody
[4:48] feeling on fire amen everybody come to
[4:51] give the devil
[4:52] problems no matter what situation you
[4:55] came through how you felt this week what
[4:57] happened all of that doesn't matter
[4:58] right now we come to to to to do what we
[5:01] need to do for us to be where we need to
[5:03] be can the church say Amen so I'd like
[5:05] to take this opportunity to welcome all
[5:07] the visitors in our midst Welcome to The
[5:09] Headstone Tabernacle all who are here
[5:10] for the first time we love you we
[5:13] appreciate you thank you for making it
[5:16] out special welcome to everyone here and
[5:18] special greetings to all of you young
[5:20] people who came out today it it is it is
[5:22] a sacrifice it is an effort but I
[5:25] believe God will bless you for that
[5:26] sacrifice and that effort somebody say
[5:28] amen amen amen so before we even get to
[5:31] the message
[5:32] tonight I found this quote and I thought
[5:35] I'd read it even before I read the
[5:37] scripture and I want you to think on
[5:39] this in a message making the valley full
[5:42] of ditches but the brandom said show me
[5:44] your
[5:46] company and I'll tell you who you are
[5:49] let me walk into your house let me see
[5:52] what's laying over on the table let me
[5:55] see how the Bible's marked up let me see
[5:58] where it's all true two stories let me
[6:01] listen to what kind of music you're
[6:03] playing on your radio let me see what
[6:06] kind of pictures you got in your house
[6:09] I'll tell you what you're made out
[6:12] of yes sir that's what your Soul's
[6:16] that's what your soul is feeding on
[6:18] regardless of what your testimony is
[6:21] your fruits prove what you are that's
[6:24] right oh it's the truth your soul feeds
[6:27] on something and whatever the
[6:30] characteristic of your soul is that is
[6:32] what it'll show forth that's the reason
[6:34] Jesus said by their fruit you shall know
[6:37] them somebody say amen
[6:44] amen and if tonight you think I'm going
[6:46] to do all the work you got to twist it
[6:50] tonight you have to be on fire tonight
[6:53] you have to
[6:54] worship I am becoming more radical about
[6:58] Jesus I have a problem where the world
[7:01] is becoming more expressive of what they
[7:03] stand for and what they believe and we
[7:05] as Christians we want to be quiet and
[7:07] hide when we have the gold when we have
[7:10] the precious elements when we have the
[7:13] best thing that there is we can't hide
[7:15] it under Abell this light has got to
[7:17] shine out can the church say Amen so
[7:19] let's stand to our feet and let's go to
[7:21] the scripture this
[7:28] evening
[7:30] let's go to one scripture tonight
[7:32] reading from Isaiah
[7:35] 55 reading verse
[7:41] 6 and the Bible says seek ye the Lord
[7:45] while he may be
[7:47] found call ye upon him while he is
[7:51] near let the wicked forsake his way and
[7:54] the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[7:58] him return unto the the Lord and He will
[8:00] have mercy upon him and to our God for
[8:04] he will abundantly pardon shall we bow
[8:07] our heads for word of prayer our
[8:09] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[8:11] for your grace your love your mercy Lord
[8:13] that has been extended to us as young
[8:15] people and Lord God as we pause father
[8:18] from the routine of life from the hustle
[8:20] and the bustle from working to pay the
[8:23] bills from working to to to accomplish
[8:25] the dreams and the vision that we might
[8:27] have Lord from going to school trying to
[8:30] learn from doing whatever it is we do
[8:32] during the time in the week we have
[8:34] taken this pause this saah this rest
[8:37] Lord to commune with you to hear a word
[8:39] that could bring transformation to our
[8:41] lives to wake us up to a true
[8:43] realization of what we are born for what
[8:46] we are called to do Lord any man could
[8:48] read a scripture but it takes the Holy
[8:50] Spirit to breathe life upon it may you
[8:52] speak to your people here tonight and
[8:54] bring permanent change in their lives we
[8:56] are a needy people tonight father we
[8:59] have so many conditions in this room
[9:01] this evening father people who are bound
[9:03] Lord with lust father bound with Lord
[9:06] evil bound with lying and jealousy and
[9:08] and envy and Malice and hatred and
[9:10] strife father Lord we come against it
[9:13] all tonight Lord in the name of Jesus
[9:15] Christ father Lord Lord may you lift the
[9:18] weariness the tiredness the depression

[9:22] being lost and confused father and may
[9:25] you build a faith father Lord as we hear
[9:27] the word May the faith Banks Eyes Lord
[9:30] until the people can leave here shouting
[9:32] and rejoicing knowing that they are born
[9:35] for such a time as this may you speak to
[9:37] your people Lord may you break the
[9:39] chains of sin May the house of Hell give
[9:42] way to the name of Jesus father may you

[9:53] word and bless your people in the name
[9:55] of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be
[9:58] seated
[10:01] so for a title
[10:03] tonight my title is do not cross the
[10:09] line that's my title tonight do not
[10:13] cross the line my subject seek ye the
[10:17] Lord while he may be found and my
[10:21] inspiration time no longer and I took my
[10:26] title from a quote at brother brandham
[10:30] uh in a message but brandom spoke called
[10:32] the deity of Jesus Christ and I want you
[10:34] to listen carefully I'm not going to be
[10:35] too long with you tonight but it's to
[10:37] pay close attention but the brandom said
[10:40] father we come this morning and I say
[10:43] this evening as your humble children I
[10:45] realize that we are living in the last
[10:47] hour closing time something can happen
[10:50] at any time men women boys or girls here
[10:55] are without God and I pray thee father
[10:58] you be merciful
[10:59] I pray thee to be merciful to those who
[11:02] have received and now realize that you
[11:05] are near in their hearts and I re and
[11:08] realizing that little things of the
[11:10] world through cares I pray God that
[11:13] every one of them this morning will be
[11:16] really consecrated to you for the coming
[11:20] days to come and how much longer we are
[11:23] going to wait before your coming we
[11:24] believe it's right at hand now and after
[11:27] a while listen carefully they're going
[11:29] to try to get saved and listen this is
[11:33] where I get it from and this is brother
[11:34] brandom man it it struck me it it it it
[11:37] interrupted my sleep last night and
[11:40] brother Bram said I'm thinking of those
[11:43] young people that night down there at
[11:46] the altar trying to be saved but had
[11:50] crossed the line No Redemption for them
[11:54] they were gone could not be saved I'll
[11:57] read it again I'm thinking of those
[12:00] young people that night down there at
[12:03] the altar trying to be saved but had
[12:07] crossed the line No Redemption for them
[12:11] they were gone could not be saved and
[12:14] from that I took a title do not
[12:19] cross the
[12:21] line my heart is heavy tonight it's
[12:24] burdened by what's happening all around
[12:26] us but the brandham said in a message
[12:29] influence what we see happen should put
[12:32] every soul into action it should make a
[12:35] church that would make a Revival young
[12:38] people that Revival is up to us every
[12:41] single one of us here tonight and I'm
[12:44] troubled tonight because there's a great
[12:46] Falling Away Hallelujah there are people
[12:49] who were once rejoicing and you can't
[12:51] find them anymore people who were once
[12:53] happy about being with the Lord and you
[12:55] can't find them anymore there's a great
[12:57] Falling Away HJ
[13:00] it comes as no surprise to us because
[13:03] brother brandham told us this was going
[13:05] to happen he spoke of a thinning out of
[13:08] a falling away of people walking away
[13:10] from their first love but even though we
[13:13] know that this was supposed to happen it
[13:16] still doesn't take away the pain when
[13:18] you see your young brother or young
[13:20] sister suffer under the task under the
[13:23] whip of the Taskmaster somebody say
[13:26] amen and I know that they are young
[13:29] people here who are on fire for God
[13:31] you're pressing on you're giving it your
[13:33] all you're doing your best you're trying
[13:35] your best you have made it in your mind
[13:37] that you're going to serve God no matter
[13:39] what I know there have some young people
[13:41] here who are holding on you might have
[13:43] your ups and downs you might have your
[13:45] questions and you're wondering but
[13:47] there's something on the inside that
[13:48] that brings you and I salute you and I
[13:50] give glory to God for keeping you give
[13:53] the Lord a hand of
[13:56] Praise I know there are some young
[13:58] people here who are willing to fight a
[14:00] good fight they're willing to leave it
[14:02] all behind and forsake all they want to
[14:05] serve Jesus
[14:08] amen but I also know that there are some
[14:10] young people here tonight and some young
[14:12] people who would hear this tape who are
[14:15] living on the
[14:17] edge they are standing on the edge of a
[14:20] line that they don't even know
[14:24] exists wake up tonight friends standing
[14:28] on the edge of a line that you don't
[14:30] even realize is even
[14:33] there tonight we're going to speak about
[14:36] that
[14:37] line and if it's five words that you
[14:40] remember from this service is do not
[14:42] cross the
[14:44] line a line is used to divide an area of
[14:48] space a line helps you to understand
[14:51] boundaries and limitations Aline helps
[14:55] maintain balance and Order almighty God
[14:58] created a heavens and the Earth and he
[15:00] put a line between them to separate them
[15:02] somebody help me this evening amen a
[15:05] line does not always have to be visible
[15:09] countries go to war because of a line
[15:11] that separates one country from another
[15:14] sometime that line you can see it but
[15:16] they go to war because they feel you
[15:18] crossed into their territory because you
[15:20] cross a line that maybe you didn't even
[15:22] realize was there somebody help
[15:25] me people die because of lines that they
[15:29] cannot even see how many young men go to
[15:31] war for a country because they crossed a
[15:33] territory and they didn't even know that
[15:35] line was there young people tonight
[15:38] there are some lines that are safe to
[15:41] cross amen but there are also some lines
[15:45] that are not safe to cross Whenever
[15:47] there is a nuclear meltdown Whenever
[15:50] there is chemical exposure Whenever
[15:52] there is a viral outbreak a line is set
[15:55] up listen carefully to keep those who
[15:58] have been not affected from becoming
[16:03] affected everybody with me that's the
[16:06] line I'm speaking about tonight Young
[16:08] Brother young sister because I believe a
[16:10] line has been set up to keep those who
[16:13] have not been affected from becoming
[16:17] affected amen it's very serious tonight
[16:20] friends because if you cross that line
[16:23] there is no cure amen if you cross the
[16:26] line there is no hope if you cross the
[16:28] line line there is no coming back
[16:30] friends Young Brother young sister do
[16:33] not cross the line Amen in brother
[16:36] bram's words he said for those who cross
[16:38] the line No Redemption for them they
[16:42] were gone could not be saved where are
[16:45] you standing tonight amen if you are
[16:49] trying to live on the edge make sure
[16:52] that you do not cross the
[16:57] line this line we are speaking about
[17:02] church separates the Lord's Side from
[17:06] the devil sides yes there are only two
[17:08] sides tonight and you must know where
[17:12] you are standing tonight
[17:14] friends you might be surprised young
[17:17] people how many other young people have
[17:19] already sold their souls to the
[17:22] devil if you don't know it witchcraft is
[17:25] in high schools in junior high schools
[17:27] in the kindergarten
[17:29] and young people have already sold their
[17:31] soul to the devil because they want to
[17:33] be successful and they want to pass an
[17:35] examination and they want to get into
[17:37] this University there is Darkness all
[17:40] over the world it might surprise you to
[17:43] know how many of the entertainers and
[17:45] the singers and the
[17:47] musicians have sold their souls to the
[17:50] devil they have crossed that line they
[17:54] have already crossed a line and there is
[17:56] no salvation for them there is no mercy
[17:59] for
[18:00] them this is definitely not one of those
[18:03] shout for Joy Services
[18:06] friends it is a message of
[18:09] warning that you do not cross the line
[18:13] the Bible tells us in second Peter 3 the
[18:16] Lord is not slack concerning his
[18:18] promises as some men count slackness but
[18:22] is long suffering to us in other words
[18:24] he'll wait for us not willing that any
[18:27] should perish but that all should come
[18:29] to repentance so God is waiting hoping
[18:32] that every single person here tonight
[18:35] would come to repent come to turn their
[18:38] lives around come to change the way you
[18:41] walk change the way you talk change the
[18:43] way you
[18:44] act but then the Bible goes on but the
[18:47] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[18:49] the
[18:50] night you don't know it's coming cuz if
[18:53] you know the thief is coming you look
[18:55] out for him but it'll come as a thief in
[18:56] the night in which the Heavens will pass
[18:59] away with a great noise and the elements
[19:02] shall melt with fervent heat the Earth
[19:04] also and the works that are therein
[19:06] shall be burned up listen
[19:09] carefully seeing then that all these
[19:12] things shall be dissolved everything
[19:14] around you will be dissolved amen
[19:17] everybody paying attention everybody
[19:19] listening carefully everybody focused on
[19:22] what is being said
[19:24] tonight seeing then that all these
[19:26] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[19:29] persons ought ye to be in all holy
[19:34] conversation and
[19:37] godliness what do you spend your time
[19:39] talking about how do you spend your time
[19:42] expressing yourself where is the bulk of
[19:46] your time spent that's why I opened with
[19:48] that quote where brother brandham says
[19:50] show me what you listen to show me who
[19:53] your friends are show me what you're
[19:55] doing and I'll see how close you are to
[19:57] that line amen amen the closer you are
[20:00] to the edge the further you are from
[20:04] God too many of us we walking along the
[20:07] edge of that line and we are in danger
[20:10] of crossing the line tonight but we are
[20:12] seeing do not cross that line
[20:14] tonight run away from the line and run
[20:17] back into the safe territory run back to
[20:20] God run to Jesus Christ tonight somebody
[20:24] say
[20:27] Amen I believe that this message tonight
[20:30] is a final warning to those who will
[20:32] hear it there is no excuse
[20:35] tonight you know there are some people
[20:37] who just like to do what they want to do
[20:41] you know they might see a no entry sign
[20:44] on the street and maybe it's a street
[20:45] you lived your entire life and maybe you
[20:47] went out for the weekend perhaps and you
[20:49] went and spent a couple days in too and
[20:52] Monday morning you're driving back home
[20:54] and you come to your street you live
[20:56] there you know this street you know the
[20:57] neighborhood you come back home and you
[21:00] come to your street and you see a no
[21:02] entry
[21:03] sign and instead of you ask why it's
[21:06] there you say who put this sign here and
[21:10] because you feel you know it's your
[21:12] street you just drive down the street
[21:14] because in your mind you tell yourself
[21:16] somebody made a mistake and put the no
[21:18] entry sign on the
[21:20] street and you didn't realize that
[21:22] earlier that
[21:24] morning some virus broke out on that
[21:27] street and and that sign was a warning
[21:30] to you to keep you off of the
[21:34] street anybody with me tonight do not
[21:39] cross the line don't do your own thing
[21:42] tonight I'm not talking about the line
[21:45] that separates families and churches and
[21:47] friends I'm talking about the line that
[21:50] is a separation between worshiping God
[21:53] and worshiping the
[21:55] devil because if you're not worshiping
[21:58] God you
[21:59] automatically worshiping the devil and
[22:02] brother brandham taught us you could
[22:04] worship anything because God is the
[22:06] object of worship and whatever you spend
[22:09] your time doing becomes your God you
[22:12] could worship your car you could worship
[22:13] your house you could worship your job
[22:15] you could worship your neighbor you
[22:17] could worship anything because that's
[22:18] where you spend your time and your
[22:21] effort but the God I serve is a jealous
[22:24] God he doesn't want anybody to share
[22:26] worship with him he wants all your
[22:28] worship all your praise all the honor
[22:31] all the glory because you couldn't even
[22:33] be here tonight if it wasn't for his
[22:35] grace if it wasn't for his love if it
[22:37] wasn't for his Mercy can the church say
[22:40] Amen Give the Lord a hand of praise

[22:48] world
[22:49] tonight it's to change the way you live
[22:51] it's to change the way you talk it it
[22:53] change the way you act because I'm I've
[22:56] said it so many times when I read a
[22:58] quote a couple weeks ago where brother
[23:00] brandham was saying people keep telling
[23:02] him they're tired of hearing him say
[23:04] certain things and brother bram's
[23:06] response was I'm tired of seeing you do
[23:08] the same
[23:09] things because the moment you stop doing
[23:12] these things I'll have a reason to stop
[23:14] saying it but if you keep doing the
[23:17] wrong thing I'm going to keep saying it
[23:19] until it sticks or you decide you want
[23:21] to cross the line
[23:23] permanently but we are going to have a
[23:25] perfect Church we're going to have a
[23:26] church full of the Holy Ghost going to
[23:28] have a church that sin cannot stay in
[23:31] that
[23:32] church somebody say Amen you may not
[23:36] understand everything tonight and I'm
[23:38] trying to bring it as simple as possible
[23:40] that a two-year-old could understand
[23:42] amen amen and preach it back
[23:53] amen tonight I say unto you do not cross
[23:57] the line
[23:59] on this side friends where we at right
[24:01] now on this side in this presence in the
[24:04] word of God there's joy there's peace
[24:06] there's a holy ghost but on that other
[24:08] side of this line that we're talking
[24:10] about is weeping wailing and nashing of
[24:12] teeth amen what side do you want to be
[24:15] on Young Brother young sister how long
[24:17] will you play with God and entertain the
[24:20] enemy we're going to say some hard
[24:23] things tonight but it is to bring
[24:24] Deliverance to you so that you can
[24:26] receive the Holy Ghost that's what this
[24:28] servic is for for you to clean up your
[24:31] house so that the baptism of the Holy
[24:33] Ghost and Fire can come into your
[24:36] heart the Holy Ghost is not going to
[24:39] come and sit down on the snake in your
[24:40] heart we're here to fire bom the snake
[24:43] with the word of God tonight somebody
[24:45] say
[24:48] Amen I'm trying to preach as hard as I
[24:51] could I said in maraval a couple weeks
[24:53] ago I'm guilty of not preaching hard
[24:55] enough
[24:57] Hallelujah and he to preach harder you
[24:59] need to shake things up some more
[25:01] because the enemy is not holding back
[25:04] the devil is not playing games he wants
[25:06] your soul he wants to kill you so we
[25:08] have a reason tonight to fight for every
[25:10] Young Brother fight for every young
[25:13] sister so you could be delivered and

[26:44] Bible on your back and and try to hold
[26:46] five Bibles so you could prove a point

[26:51] life don't be ashamed of this
[26:53] gospel the people in the world they do
[26:56] what they want to do amen
[27:00] Hallelujah they identify with what they
[27:02] want to identify
[27:06] with all the time I spent in prison I
[27:09] saw young people who had their
[27:11] identification around them all the time
[27:14] if they're in a gang all their colors
[27:16] show the gang colors all the gang
[27:18] symbols everything to identify that's
[27:20] where their heart was
[27:22] at and you don't want to be identified
[27:25] with eternal life and you don't want to
[27:27] be identified with the baptism of the
[27:29] Holy Ghost you want to please some boy
[27:31] some girl some friend some neighbor with
[27:34] their foolishness when they're going to
[27:35] hell and play games with this Gospel of
[27:38] Jesus Christ what's wrong with you do

[27:50] to you what your teacher never said to
[27:52] you and I'm speaking for heaven tonight
[27:55] do not make the mistake and cross the
[27:57] line because you'll be
[28:04] finished if I'm not making it clear
[28:07] enough you help me wave your hand and
[28:09] let me know make it harder make it
[28:11] tougher make it rougher so now I'm
[28:13] clearing yeah so that when I see you
[28:15] doing your nonsense I could say weren't
[28:17] you in church don't you know better than
[28:20] them how long the Bible says will you be
[28:23] slack concerning the
[28:25] promises how long will you live
[28:29] double-minded some of you in here
[28:30] tonight you are wasting your time I'm
[28:32] telling you straight because you plan to
[28:34] go and do some foolishness tonight or
[28:36] tomorrow or the next day don't waste my
[28:39] time don't waste God's time I'm not here
[28:41] for
[28:45] that I want to talk to people who want
[28:48] God who want reality who want to see
[28:51] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[28:53] and forever is there anybody in the
[28:55] house who wants to see the same God
[28:58] wrote the word manifest the word in your
[29:01] life if that's how you feel stand to
[29:03] your feet right
[29:12] now you may be seated we had a full
[29:16] house that's wonderful so I'm preaching
[29:18] to the right group tonight everybody
[29:20] stood up if somebody kept sitting now
[29:22] was going to call the deacons right away
[29:23] clear them out they don't belong here
[29:25] amen hallelujah Glory
[29:29] we going to have church or no church at
[29:31] all can the church say amen amen amen
[29:34] that's why the scripture we read said
[29:36] seek ye the Lord while he may be found
[29:40] in other words it's coming a time when
[29:41] you'll be looking for God and you'll be
[29:43] knocking and crying out but he will not
[29:45] answer because time will be up friends
[29:49] we are running out of
[29:51] time why because eternity is getting
[29:54] ready to take over time is temporary
[29:58] only eternity is eternal amen can the
[30:00] church say amen
[30:04] amen
[30:06] friends the fact that you are here
[30:08] tonight means that you have come too far
[30:11] to
[30:12] backslide Hallelujah you have come too
[30:15] far to give up amen you have come too
[30:18] far to quit amen it's the devil's job to
[30:21] tell you to quit and you know what the
[30:23] problem is friends you see this line
[30:25] we're preaching about tonight if you
[30:28] spend too much of your time living on
[30:29] the edge you're going to hear all the
[30:31] voices from on the other side of this
[30:34] line right but if you come away from the
[30:36] line you're going to hear a whole
[30:38] different kind of conversation because
[30:39] behind you is a host of the angels and
[30:42] the Lord himself and there's power and
[30:44] the word and the anointing when you step
[30:46] away from this line into the presence of
[30:48] God every day gets deeper the more you
[30:51] in the word the more you in prayer the
[30:53] more in the spirit as you come away from
[30:54] the line your walk begins to change your
[30:57] talk begins to change can the church say
[30:59] amen hallelujah
[31:02] hallelujah so if you want to shut up the
[31:05] negative voices what do you got to do
[31:08] come away from the line there are some
[31:10] friends you must never talk to again
[31:13] that's right is that clear enough am no
[31:16] conversation no explanation just don't
[31:19] answer the phone is that rude
[31:21] no cut them off amen because if that
[31:25] voice is not driving you to heaven it's
[31:28] going to drive it to hell it's only two
[31:30] options amen is that clear enough but I
[31:33] want to tell them nicely that I can't
[31:35] talk to them to tell them what to give
[31:37] them the opportunity to get you to try
[31:39] to explain yourself you know who you are
[31:41] you don't need to explain yourself your
[31:42] father is the king your father owns a
[31:45] cattle in a thousand hills when your
[31:47] father snaps his fingers the clouds
[31:49] begin to move the sky begins to roll
[31:51] back somebody say Amen do you know who
[31:53] you are do you know where you come from
[31:56] do you know where you're going do you
[31:58] know what your promise is do you know
[31:59] what you are born to do in such a time
[32:02] as
[32:04] this somebody say Amen maybe you never
[32:08] heard preaching like this before we're
[32:09] not
[32:10] crazy they already tested me I
[32:20] passed I am crazy about God you got to
[32:24] be crazy about something yes you got to
[32:27] be crazy about something something you
[32:28] might as well be crazy about God cuz
[32:31] this world brother Bram said is going
[32:33] totally insane so if the whole world is
[32:35] going insane I want to go insane for
[32:38] Jesus let me talk about Jesus let me
[32:41] laugh about Jesus let me walk in the
[32:42] street talking to myself seeing the Lord
[32:45] is good his Mercy is Everlasting his
[32:47] goodness endureth forever surely
[32:49] goodness and mercy shall follow me let
[32:52] me be called crazy for being identified
[32:55] with the God who made Heaven and the
[32:56] Earth somebody's say amen
[33:02] amen how we doing tonight am trying to
[33:06] find
[33:07] myself
[33:10] so H I already went ahead of my
[33:14] notes I have you yes and no you've been
[33:17] coming to church and you've listened to
[33:19] all the services and the ministers but
[33:21] the reality is too many of us are
[33:25] hearing the voices from the other side
[33:28] of the line more than on this side of
[33:31] the
[33:32] line friends you come to church on a
[33:37] Sunday a few hours maybe you come in the
[33:40] midweek
[33:42] service I understand maybe you finish
[33:44] work so late by the time you get your
[33:46] service is over okay but that's why
[33:49] there is a
[33:50] library that's why there's a website
[33:54] that's why there are resources so that
[33:56] you have no excuse to miss a service it
[33:59] is your responsibility when you can be
[34:02] here to be here there is no excuse for
[34:05] not being here when you physically could
[34:07] be here if you physically cannot be here
[34:10] that's what the website and the library
[34:12] and all the other things are
[34:15] foren because if it's two Services a
[34:17] week maybe three services and a prayer
[34:20] meeting maybe you spend all the other
[34:23] hours of your day hearing these
[34:26] voices why don't change CH your shoes
[34:28] why don't cut your hair why don't wear
[34:31] this chain why don't try this drink why
[34:33] I don't do this listen you hear the new
[34:35] Beyonce song you didn't hear it well I
[34:38] not really supposed to listen to No I
[34:40] know you're not really supposed to
[34:41] listen to No but just just listen like 2
[34:43] minutes and before you know it by let me
[34:46] resume that song still in your
[34:48] head isn't that right the voes of the
[34:52] world is all around you you're driving
[34:55] your car you see the sign on the street
[34:57] bum
[34:59] bed the music the fashion the style is
[35:03] all around you but you are not from this
[35:06] world so you have to shield and protect
[35:09] yourself by doing what stepping away
[35:12] from that line the problem is when you
[35:15] live on the edge and you want to please
[35:17] the people in your circle that's why
[35:19] brother brandham said you want the Holy
[35:21] Ghost spend time with people who have
[35:23] the Holy
[35:24] Ghost because your conversation will be
[35:27] different your behavior will be
[35:28] different your attitude and
[35:30] action this life is not about what you
[35:33] do when you're in
[35:34] service everybody here looking Christian
[35:36] right
[35:37] now everybody here looking looking very
[35:40] very holy very Sanctified I can't look
[35:44] at you and see anything else the problem
[35:47] happens when you leave this place and
[35:49] you in the workplace and all of a sudden
[35:52] forget it your words change you know you
[35:55] know here you say bless Jesus God bless
[35:57] bless you I'm blessed that's highly
[35:59] favored you have all these you know
[36:01] these phrases this too blessed to be
[36:04] stressed you have all these nice phrases
[36:06] when somebody ask you how are you doing
[36:07] I'm too blessed to be stressed really
[36:09] when they get to work and they ask you
[36:11] how you doing that's not what they
[36:16] saying I'm challenging you tonight step
[36:20] away from the edge because if you spend
[36:22] too much time on the edge you are at the
[36:24] risk of crossing the line
[36:29] somebody say
[36:31] Amen this message friends is a call to
[36:34] action let these five words be your
[36:37] Anthem if anybody asks you about this
[36:40] youth service you have five words to
[36:42] give them do not cross the line let
[36:47] these five words be your battlecry let
[36:49] these five words be your inspiration do
[36:52] not cross the line listen to brother
[36:55] brandham in a message beginning and
[36:58] ending of the the Gentile dispensation
[37:01] but the brandom said here now a man is
[37:03] permitted to travel so far but there's a
[37:07] separating line between life and death
[37:10] he must never cross that see you can go
[37:14] on with your little foolishness for a
[37:16] while but you better know where the line
[37:19] is can the church say amen and we are
[37:23] making clear tonight that this line is
[37:26] being drawn out so that you know that
[37:29] you got to change your walk change your
[37:31] talk but brandom goes on did the Lord
[37:34] ever check you on anything he does all
[37:36] of us pull the check reins
[37:40] say say that's fine enough now then you
[37:44] had better watch what you're doing from
[37:46] then on if you're stepping across
[37:49] towards that
[37:51] line so don't take this light friends
[37:53] don't take this light today August 16th
[37:57] is the most important day of your life I
[38:01] read a statement this week the two most
[38:04] important days in your life are the days
[38:08] one that you were born and the second
[38:11] the day you find out
[38:13] why and I pray that today is the day you
[38:16] find out why you were born what your
[38:18] purpose is what you are called to do and
[38:21] that you have to be in the presence of
[38:23] God for the word of God to be manifested
[38:25] in your life that you could live this
[38:27] thing
[38:28] out what good do it do to gain the whole
[38:31] world and lose your soul I see so many
[38:33] young people I have it written my later
[38:35] who go to university and they go to
[38:36] school and they try to become this or
[38:38] that and they lose their salvation they
[38:40] lose their soul they lose their desire
[38:42] for God they were on fire and they allow
[38:44] a little degree a little certificate a
[38:46] little education to turn them away
[38:48] completely a little job they pray Lord
[38:50] give me a job help me get a job Lord
[38:52] give me a job when they get a job you
[38:54] can't see them in
[38:55] church Lord give me a car give me a car
[38:58] so I can drive to church when they get
[38:59] the car they by the
[39:01] beach can't see them in church is the
[39:04] truth why they were always living too
[39:07] close to the edge friends the only way
[39:10] you could backslide is to be on the edge
[39:11] you
[39:12] know that's why brother over always says
[39:15] when you backslide it's not because
[39:17] yesterday something happened it's all
[39:19] along you were just walking towards the
[39:21] line until one day you just kept doing
[39:23] what you were doing and you end up
[39:25] crossing the line and when you cross
[39:26] that line
[39:28] there's no way back right can the church
[39:30] say Amen so tonight we're saying that's
[39:34] far enough if you've been moving towards
[39:36] the line August 16 2014 is the day you
[39:40] realize that you were doing the wrong
[39:41] thing and it's time to back up it's time
[39:43] to come away from the line can the
[39:45] church say
[39:48] Amen Give the Lord a hand of praise
[39:56] tonight
[39:58] when your friends in school call you to
[39:59] hang
[40:00] out do not cross the
[40:03] line when your friends tell to wear this
[40:06] wear that try this try that do
[40:09] not cross the line when your friends
[40:13] send you a picture to put up as your
[40:15] profile on
[40:17] Facebook do
[40:19] not cross the
[40:22] line when you go to the mall do not
[40:27] cross the line friends you have to know
[40:30] what your weakness is there was a
[40:32] brother many years ago he was delivered
[40:34] from alcohol he was a
[40:37] drinker but whenever he drove you know
[40:40] around Barataria or M around they have
[40:42] the brewery whenever he drove
[40:46] there like the scent of it the memories
[40:49] just hit him and for a while he had to
[40:51] like catch
[40:53] himself because that was his weakness
[40:56] that's why the message said you got to
[40:57] die and rot die is when you you you just
[41:01] you know you get control of not doing it
[41:03] but rot is when the desire comes
[41:05] completely out of you so he died out to
[41:08] he because able to resist it but it
[41:09] didn't rot completely because when he
[41:11] came into the environment if you leave
[41:13] him too long you have to drive there
[41:15] fast if you have a traffic jam you have
[41:16] a
[41:17] problem if you have a traffic jam you
[41:20] might lose
[41:22] him so you have to know what if I could
[41:25] use the word your Kryptonite is is they
[41:28] say Superman have a cryptonite well this
[41:29] is service tonight boy read
[41:33] Superman if you know Superman had
[41:35] Kryptonite which is his weakness the
[41:38] thing that affected him you have to know
[41:40] what your Kryptonite is some of us we
[41:43] have different cryptonite some of us is
[41:45] the music forget it when did he release
[41:47] a
[41:49] track WKA flocker I know all of
[41:53] them two chains you name it
[41:57] when the new mixtape come out forget it
[42:00] you can't find you in church for two
[42:05] weeks when it's the Grammys or the Oscar
[42:07] and you watch the outfit that's it you
[42:09] there losting after the outfit you wish
[42:10] you could wear that dress know if your
[42:12] mother only go away for a week you're
[42:13] wearing
[42:15] it the hair side everybody have their
[42:18] own cryp Tonight the music the fashion
[42:21] did this did that whatever it is the
[42:24] movies the shows the books whatever it
[42:26] is you you have to know how to protect
[42:28] yourself from it because that's what
[42:30] keeps you on the edge of the line and
[42:33] listen but the brandom says the devil is
[42:36] entitled to that punch you know so if he
[42:39] knows what your weakness is you don't
[42:41] you have to understand the devil will
[42:42] inspire Beyond to sing a song just for
[42:44] you you know when she trying to make a
[42:47] platinum record for the world is you are
[42:49] the
[42:50] target you want you yes
[42:56] you so if you know you're Kryptonite but
[42:59] the brandom said it like this the devil
[43:00] will only attack your weak spot that's
[43:02] right so if you know it's your weak spot
[43:04] you have to close all the gaps in your
[43:07] life to protect you somebody say
[43:11] amen and the safest thing to do is come
[43:14] away from that
[43:16] line that's why I says some of you need
[43:19] to take your cell phone tonight and
[43:20] either throw it in the trash or delete
[43:23] all the contacts of people who know you
[43:25] change your phone number defriend people
[43:28] on Facebook I learned that this
[43:31] week because you don't want them to be a
[43:33] friend
[43:36] anymore this is rough no this is not
[43:39] rough this is you protecting your soul
[43:42] someone that's precious to you why you
[43:45] do not want to cross the line somebody
[43:48] say amen amen everybody getting this
[43:52] tonight well I'm talking about lying so
[43:56] many by the grace of God tonight when
[43:58] you see any kind of line you'll remember
[44:00] this message I wrote it in my notes when
[44:02] you see a Clos line you say do cross the
[44:05] line I wanted to be so real to you that
[44:08] you say I ain't crossing any kind of
[44:13] line so tangible this must become to you
[44:19] tonight forgive me tonight if I don't
[44:21] sound too deep or too spiritual I could
[44:24] have brought a message tonight a deep
[44:27] message but I thank God for the ministry
[44:30] of the spirit to rightly divide a word
[44:32] we need to hear tonight because I've
[44:34] come to the realization we have a lot of
[44:36] people in the message who are not really
[44:40] saved they are not saved because if they
[44:42] were saved they wouldn't be behaving how
[44:44] they behave they would not be acting how
[44:47] they act their only claim is they're in
[44:49] the message that's why you can't judge a
[44:51] group or a church by the
[44:53] Believers you have to judge it by the
[44:55] word you have to judge how the ministers
[44:58] stay with the word as revealed by God's
[45:01] Prophet can the church say amen
[45:03] amen you know this quote from a message
[45:06] angels of the Covenant brother kman in
[45:09] 1981 said and you young people the devil
[45:12] is telling you that you didn't taste the
[45:14] world yet wait a little longer and you
[45:17] keep waiting and you're going to wind up
[45:19] in the tribulation period in hell
[45:21] because there ain't no more time yet no
[45:24] more time left time no longer the day
[45:27] you hear my voice hard or not your young
[45:29] hearts I'm not going to be too much
[45:31] longer with you friends if you cross the
[45:34] line you can't get the Holy Ghost if you
[45:37] cross the line you can be adopted if you
[45:40] cross the line there's no Rapture for
[45:43] you so many people have allowed
[45:46] situations in their lives to lead them
[45:48] to doubt God to doubt the prophit to
[45:52] doubt the Bible to doubt the message of
[45:54] the hour don't make that mistake friends
[45:58] do not cross the line Daniel had a
[46:02] choice he prayed so much that they say
[46:05] let's make a
[46:06] law that whoever
[46:09] pray in whatever way that's not how we
[46:12] want them
[46:13] to we'll thr them in the Lions then he
[46:16] had a choice he could have crossed that
[46:19] line in his day and given up on what he
[46:21] believed but he held his ground the
[46:24] three Hebrew boys had a choice they
[46:26] could have crossed the line like
[46:27] everybody else but it said we will not
[46:29] bow down God give us some more young
[46:31] people who will not cross the line and
[46:33] give up what is the truth and what is
[46:38] Right friends crossing the line is a
[46:42] choice you have a choice tonight brother
[46:45] brandom in the message God's provided
[46:47] way and I had put this up on our
[46:50] Facebook page earlier this week but the
[46:52] bandam said it's not necessary that any
[46:55] man would go to hell
[46:57] and God don't send no one to hell he
[47:01] said you send yourself to Hell God's
[47:04] done everything in the world he can to
[47:07] put you from going to keep you from
[47:10] going to hell and yet you determined to
[47:12] go to hell you fight over every
[47:15] barricade God puts in your way you just
[47:18] go right on over it I don't believe in
[47:20] this I don't believe in this I don't
[47:22] believe in this I don't believe a car
[47:24] cut me here I don't believe a car wear
[47:25] this pants I don't I do this I don't
[47:28] believe I listen to the music is a tan
[47:30] going through why I listen love song I
[47:32] don't
[47:37] believe but the BAM said now there's a
[47:40] red light here in the city and it turns
[47:42] red and green that tells you when you
[47:45] can stop and go if you run it well don't
[47:48] blame the city they put the light up
[47:51] there for your protection but if you run
[47:53] on through it that's up to you it's you
[47:56] you you you brought your own
[47:58] judgment friends today come back into
[48:02] the presence of God come away from that
[48:05] line tonight it's always a choice it is
[48:08] a choice tonight God is not going to
[48:10] choose for you young brother young
[48:12] sister brother brandham taught us that
[48:15] in the Year of Jubilee you could go free
[48:18] if you want to go free anybody knows
[48:20] that in the Year of Jubilee what was
[48:23] yours had to come back to you in the
[48:26] year of the devil had to let you go we
[48:28] know this but brother brandham also
[48:31] taught us that there was a choice there
[48:33] was a line if you cross that line you
[48:36] were saying to the slave owner you don't
[48:39] want to be free your air was pierced as
[48:43] a sign that you had crossed the line
[48:47] there was no Redemption for you you were
[48:50] gone you could not be saved the Jubilee
[48:53] trumpet could be sounding right next to
[48:56] you
[48:57] but you had crossed the line it no
[49:00] longer apply to you I warn you tonight
[49:03] in the name of Jesus Christ do not cross
[49:07] the
[49:08] line we always preach about the Jubilee
[49:11] about being free but what about those
[49:14] who crossed the line it was said that
[49:17] the slave owners tried different ways to
[49:20] encourage the slaves to
[49:22] stay and I can't help but wonder if
[49:26] those those who crossed the line those
[49:29] who chose to stay I wonder if they had
[49:32] any
[49:33] regrets imagine for all their lives they
[49:37] lived knowing a jubilee was coming they
[49:40] lived knowing that there was hope they
[49:42] lived knowing that there was a
[49:44] possibility that they could be free and
[49:46] Friends it is the possibilities and the
[49:49] hopes that give us a reason to
[49:51] live it is the possibility that this
[49:54] Mortal could put on immortality
[49:57] that keeps us coming to church it is the
[50:00] possibility that you don't have to be
[50:02] sick anymore that keeps you coming here
[50:04] but the brandom said missing limbs will
[50:06] be restored there's a possibility if
[50:09] you're missing a hand or missing a leg
[50:11] it could be restored because that's the
[50:14] God we
[50:16] serve it is the possibilities and hopes
[50:19] that keeps us going and the greatest
[50:22] hope which is Christ in you the hope of
[50:24] glory so friends the slaves for their
[50:27] entire lives they had lived with the
[50:30] purpose that could only come with
[50:32] knowing that one day they could be free
[50:35] but as the so far the trumpet of the
[50:37] Jubilee is sounded now they have a
[50:39] choice and I believe the trumpet is
[50:41] sounding tonight for some of you young
[50:44] people and you have the same
[50:46] choice friends as I was meditating on
[50:49] this message I'm writing I say it is
[50:52] difficult to understand it is difficult
[50:55] why after being forced to be a slave you
[50:58] would now choose willingly to be
[51:02] one and friends in our case it is
[51:05] because Adam fell in sin that we were
[51:07] born in sin we had no control over our
[51:11] birth but why would you willingly choose
[51:14] to stay in sin when you could be born
[51:17] again why would you willingly want to do
[51:20] the same thing keep the same on life
[51:23] when there's power in the name of Jesus
[51:25] to break Every Chain to take that evil
[51:28] out of you to give you the Holy Ghost
[51:30] and Fire to give you a new walk a new
[51:32] talk a new life a living faith virtue
[51:35] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[51:37] brotherly kindness and
[51:43] charity I can't figure
[51:46] out but after being a slave for their
[51:49] entire lives when Freedom was now made
[51:52] available without money without price
[51:55] they would choose to continue to live
[51:57] the same way they had been living by
[52:01] doing what by crossing the
[52:03] line from Life unto death but the
[52:08] brandham said in the message the 10
[52:10] virgin and the
[52:11] 144,000 brother the brandham said what
[52:14] do you mean brother the brandham listen
[52:16] carefully if you hear the gospel truth
[52:19] and you refuse to walk in it then God
[52:23] marks your air where you'll never hear
[52:26] it no more more you have crossed the
[52:28] line between life and death then you'll
[52:31] go on with your organization your
[52:33] denomination the rest of your days
[52:35] forever so friends it's a warning to
[52:38] every one of us to change how we live
[52:42] not what we talk but change how we live
[52:46] for message this day the scripture is
[52:48] fulfilled brother brand said what a
[52:50] perfect example it is of the Gospel of
[52:53] Jesus Christ when it's preached the
[52:55] acceptable time and the time of Jubilee
[52:58] anybody no matter who you are what color
[53:00] you are what denomination you belong to
[53:03] how far you have stooped in sin or
[53:06] what's wrong with you you can go free
[53:08] when you hear the gospel trumpet sound
[53:11] out you are free but listen but if you
[53:14] turn your back upon the message and
[53:18] refuse to hear it notice you are Bor in
[53:21] your air with an oil that means to say
[53:24] that you have crossed the line between
[53:26] grace and judgment and you will never
[53:28] hear the gospel again you'll never get
[53:30] any further you must be a slave to the
[53:33] system you're in the rest of your days
[53:36] if you refuse to hear the acceptable
[53:38] year friends tonight the holy spirit is
[53:42] speaking tonight you know brother oid
[53:45] spoke to me I believe early this
[53:47] morning and he was asking me what type
[53:49] of response I expect to get from the
[53:50] young people and I said to him brother
[53:53] if it's one person comes tonight
[53:57] I will preach as hard as I can to that
[53:59] one person because I believe that
[54:01] there's one person here there's always
[54:03] one person who God is going to speak and
[54:06] arrest your lives you make sure you be
[54:09] that one person tonight you make sure
[54:12] you are that one person if there's one
[54:14] person to make their calling and
[54:16] election sure you be that one person
[54:19] tonight to make the choice I have
[54:22] decided to follow Jesus no turning back
[54:25] no turning back
[54:28] the holy spirit is speaking tonight the
[54:30] holy spirit is doing something
[54:33] tonight listen to what brother bam said
[54:35] listen carefully because for you to grow
[54:38] in God you have to know exactly what the
[54:40] word says but Bram says in a message
[54:43] greater than Solomon is here and when
[54:45] you see the Holy Spirit doing something
[54:47] like he's doing right now and you make
[54:49] fun of it you play games with it you
[54:52] take it lightly you take it for granted
[54:54] listen you have crossed the line
[54:57] that you'll never cross back again it'll
[55:00] never be forgiven you so friends this is
[55:03] very serious tonight it's a time of
[55:06] decision for every single one of us here
[55:09] I'm about to close I'm on my last page
[55:11] but this even can get ready to come
[55:13] up in a message God's power to
[55:17] transform brother the brandham said
[55:19] that's thus sayth God's holy
[55:23] word if we disbelieve willfully in other
[55:28] words you make a choice after what you
[55:30] heard
[55:31] tonight if you choose after this message
[55:35] tonight if we disbelieve willfully after
[55:40] we have seen it and heard it then we are
[55:43] cross the line there'll be never no more
[55:45] forgiveness for it you have crossed the
[55:47] line oh you say God still blesses me
[55:51] butam said oh
[55:53] yeah but the BAM said remember Israel
[55:56] the Border Lines when God gave them a
[55:59] promise over in the Holy Land in the
[56:01] land it was good of milk and honey when
[56:03] Moses sent out Caleb and Joshua and the
[56:05] spies to go and spy the land and brought
[56:08] back the Vindicated evidence and 10 of
[56:10] them said we cannot do it we're unable
[56:13] look at how difficult it is and Joshua
[56:16] and Caleb said we are more than unable
[56:18] to do it God made the promise he said
[56:22] and remember they turned back that was
[56:24] kades Baria and they turned back and
[56:26] become Wanderers in the wilderness and
[56:28] every one of them died lost eternally
[56:31] Jesus said so don't cross that
[56:34] separating line see listen carefully
[56:36] when you know to do good and do it it
[56:39] not to you it's a
[56:41] sin friends the time has come for Action
[56:45] the time has come to believe or don't
[56:49] believe that separating line comes to
[56:52] every man and woman it comes to every
[56:55] child
[56:58] sometimes when you pass that line
[57:00] there's only one thing left that's
[57:02] judgment when you pass between mercy and
[57:04] judgment when you pass that line friends
[57:09] move away from that line tonight let's
[57:11] stand to our
[57:25] feet
[57:29] you have a choice tonight
[57:33] friends like I said some of us we're not
[57:36] doing too badly we're fighting with all
[57:39] that we got but there are too many of us
[57:42] we've been living on the
[57:44] edge some of us we are pushing our foot
[57:46] so close to the edge we're just on the
[57:48] line right
[57:50] now maybe you're one of them tonight
[57:52] you're on the line you know your
[57:53] situation you know your
[57:55] condition
[57:57] I'm challenging every one of you
[57:59] tonight to make a declaration to God
[58:03] lord tonight is my night today is my day
[58:09] I'm coming home I'm coming back to my
[58:11] first love I'm willing to do whatever it
[58:14] takes to do Lord but I don't want to
[58:17] cross the line Lord I don't want to
[58:20] cross the line I could imagine how
[58:21] painful it was for brother brandham as
[58:24] he said I'm thinking of those young
[58:25] people people on that night down there
[58:29] at the
[58:30] altar trying to be saved but had crossed
[58:33] the line God help us No Redemption for
[58:36] them they were gone could not be saved
[58:39] and I and I think of Noah when God shut
[58:42] the door and Noah was in the ark and for
[58:44] years he had preached that it was going
[58:46] to rain but nobody really believed him
[58:48] but then all of a sudden the rain began
[58:50] to fall and the people who were outside
[58:53] the ark they screamed out Noah open the
[58:56] door so we could get saved but it was
[58:59] too late they could not be
[59:02] saved the time of Grace the time of
[59:06] Mercy the time of Salvation was over
[59:09] friends time is running
[59:13] out today could be your last day your
[59:16] last day your very last day I'm not even
[59:19] reaching tomorrow yet today could be
[59:21] your last day to make things right today
[59:25] could be your very last day to move away
[59:28] from that line before judgment strikes
[59:30] you but brandham said when you cross the
[59:33] line you could still be in church and
[59:35] you don't even know that you're finished
[59:37] still come to church every Sunday and
[59:40] you could never make it because you
[59:41] already crossed the line friends where
[59:44] are you standing
[59:46] tonight maybe you've been living in sin
[59:49] but you don't you don't need to live in
[59:50] sin anymore maybe you have been living
[59:53] and you know what's right you don't need
[59:54] a preacher to tell you that that's right
[59:56] and that's wrong you know it you've
[59:57] heard it long
[59:59] enough everyone in here you know what's
[1:00:01] the truth you know what's right maybe
[1:00:04] you haven't been studying the message as
[1:00:06] you should or reading the Bible as you
[1:00:08] should or praying as you should you've
[1:00:10] been living so long in the edge you know
[1:00:13] more worldly songs than church songs you
[1:00:16] have more worldly friends than church
[1:00:18] friends you have more worldly clothes
[1:00:20] and church clothes you have more worldly
[1:00:22] desires than desires for God
[1:00:27] check yourself tonight come away from
[1:00:30] the edge tonight and come back to
[1:00:34] God because you do not want to cross the
[1:00:39] line I'm going to challenge you tonight
[1:00:42] every head bound every eye
[1:00:46] closed the holy spirit is already
[1:00:49] here don't make fun of him don't play
[1:00:52] games with him he said if you play games
[1:00:55] you make fun of this thing you you
[1:00:57] already crossed the line I'm going to
[1:00:59] challenge every one of
[1:01:01] you if you have been living on the
[1:01:04] edge and you want to make your life
[1:01:06] right with God you begin to talk to God
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:10] now and I want to challenge you because
[1:01:13] I believe as brother brandham said you
[1:01:14] have to do something for something to
[1:01:16] happen you have to take a stand because
[1:01:19] if you stand for God He he'll stand for
[1:01:21] you Hallelujah and I don't like to
[1:01:24] preach a message like this who had given
[1:01:26] people the opportunity to come to the
[1:01:28] altar because brother bam spoke about
[1:01:31] young people down there at the altar
[1:01:33] trying to be saved but they had crossed
[1:01:35] the line but I believe
[1:01:37] tonight
[1:01:39] tonight you could come to the Altar and
[1:01:42] you could be saved you could come to the
[1:01:45] Altar and you could be restored you
[1:01:48] could come to the Altar and you could be
[1:01:50] delivered you could come to the Altar
[1:01:52] and the peace that you lost could be
[1:01:54] restored you might have come in here
[1:01:57] backsliding you're in church but you're
[1:02:00] backslid you're out of church and you're
[1:02:01] backsliding but you don't need to leave

[1:02:08] for such a time as this is there anybody
[1:02:12] here tonight you've been living on the
[1:02:14] edge and you want to say Lord take me
[1:02:17] back lord if that's how you feel I want
[1:02:19] you to come to the altar right now as a
[1:02:22] declaration of coming home I don't care
[1:02:24] where you at I don't care where you at
[1:02:26] you come to the altar right now you're

[1:02:37] don't lie to the Holy Ghost he knows who
[1:02:39] needs to be up here right now he knows
[1:02:42] who needs to be here because if you go
[1:02:44] home without making it right and you
[1:02:46] know there are things to be made right

[1:03:46] found he's here tonight but God is a
[1:03:51] gentleman he's not going to knock on
[1:03:53] your heart forever he said I stand at
[1:03:55] the door and knock
[1:03:56] and if any man here you open the door to
[1:03:58] him it's your choice to open the door
[1:04:01] some people want to hear a good service
[1:04:03] they want to hear a good sermon to
[1:04:04] fulfill that desire in their heart to be
[1:04:08] in church I'm not talking about that
[1:04:10] tonight I'm not talking about you coming
[1:04:12] to
[1:04:13] church I'm talking about your soul

[1:04:19] you coming back returning to your first
[1:04:22] love I'm talking about you being trans
