really special and during that time the Lord brought something to me that I put into the form of a poem that I'd like to share with you hope gives me the grace to do justice to it as I received it and I hope that it will help some weary Soldier some weary traveler along the way it's called The Blessing but it's a poem with a subtitle the subtitle is no cross no Crown they see your glory but they don't know your story they see your gain but they don't know the cost in pain they say look how you are blessed but do they know about the stress fighting to live yet willing to to give to any in need sowing a charity seed yay my cup cup ha overflowed but do you know or do you remember the rough roads that I rode into darkness dark tunnels of depression and fight to steer through the dark to the beckoning light no cross no Crown the way up is down down on your knees for Satan trembles when he sees when he sees that that most powerful place where we seek God's face oh we see the victory but are we blind to the Garden of Gethsemane before the Battle of obedience Was Won by that great example son before we could be washed by the Crimson flood his anguish and his agony had to turn his sweat into drops of blood many won the cross many won the crown but not the cross not knowing that there can be no gain without loss loss of self passion Pride the three that make the enemy's threefold cord and lead us to Hell's Gates which are open wide no cross no Crown the way up is down we have to be shaped we have to be molded on the road to Emos even in their distress he scolded we have to be tempted we have to be tried on that very Road he rebuked them oh fools and slow of heart ought not Christ to have suffered and died so never forget the master key to unlock Untold treasures and victory one musty on bended knee this oh Lord help us to see and let not these verses be just entertainment for you and for me sa oh Hallelujah you appreciate that this morning oh glory to God

Serious injury and uh my vehicle is in bad shape but glory to God except for a few body EGS I am fine praise God Amen and on on Friday the prayer meeting after the Fast and the prayer meeting she sent me this I didn't ask her to read it but I feel it was a powerful thing to read she said good evening brother ID this is Friday after the prayer meeting I just want to say thank you for the exhortation you brought tonight you said you were excited to bring it to us but I was excited to hear it was a Vindication to me when you spoke of the role of the seraphin I usually spend a few moments during my lunch break at work to pray for a few minutes I read a scripture it could under line this and take this as an example this is where you could find your space I want to read it again I usually this what habits come in repeated the right thing doing the right thing I usually spend a few moments during my lunch break at work to pray for a few minutes and read a scripture you know what she's doing there she's actually building an altar amen a place where you can pray you could do that on the job you could do that in the bathroom you could do that before you eat you could do that in the kitchen wherever you could make a place a consistent time the past two days I read the same scripture Isaiah 6 and I especially highlighted verses 5 to 7 and read it over and over to get into my spirit the meaning of what I was reading now I usually go on to a new scripture each day this is great I certainly appreciate the testimony because some people had a hold Bible and had to blow the dust off the Bible to see when last it was turned uh I usually go onto a new scripture each day as I mention something kept me from moving from this scripture yesterday and today you could imagine my excitement when you started speaking about it tonight I so got it additionally during my morning devotion I hear that again do do we have that do you have that during my morning devotion one of the things I asked God for is that he would help me to be mindful of his presence as I go through the day what a prayer this is this had to be read this morning I know I was checking about all these different ones uh different Brothers different uh men of God in the in the Old Testament all of them built altars Noah and and and and Jacob and and and Isaac all them built altars but you know one man who didn't build any altar lot lot after came out of Sodom he didn't me alter he got drunk I wouldn't say no more on that he didn't even make an altar of Thanksgiving sometime God bless us and God do so much for us and like the pig the the apples falling on the pig and grunt grunt grunt grunt only eating never look up and say thank you Lord or you always have a complaint you always have something to negative you have something to to to to to to to to to bring down or pull down you wouldn't say thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord your ey longing what others have and what in said Thank You Lord some people have things but no peace let's continue additionally during my morning devotion one of the things I ask God for is that he helped me to be mindful of his presence as I go through the day call practice in his presence I have found that my days are filled with Songs of Praise In My Heart and even though I have some challenging days at work I deal with the challenges differently now one such example I don't know if you have heard I was in a bad vehicle accident early this week someone fell asleep at the wheel and ran into me at full speed pushing my vehicle on the car in front of me the gentleman who ran into me got out of the vehicle and came and apologized to me for falling asleep on the weel my previous reaction would have been anger towards him but I was so calm and literally compassionate to him I felt sorry for him this demonstrated to myself a change that I wasn't aware has occurred but for this situation could we give the Lord some praises and you see many times God do a work in you and you don't even know until something happen and you see your reaction and behavior that demonstrated is a work of God that's in your life we give the Lord some Praises I could go on with lots more but this is the gist of what I had on my heart thank you my dear pastor and may God bless you and your family praise the Lord and this is the scripture she had from Isaiah 65 then I said who is me from an i am UND done note is didn't say who is you some people like that you you you you always blaming someone always have a reason to justify their foolishness and their behavior by casting is the teacher is the mother is the uncle is the husband not me is he is she is them a liar I'm calling you out this morning you know who I talking to I ain't talking to nobody else but you you have no excuses deal with your issues deal with you Hallelujah war is me I'm a man I'm undone because I am a man of unclean lips I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tong of the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this had touch thy lips that iniquity is taken away and thy s s sin is purged oh may give God some Praises here what a testimony thank you sister June for sharing this with us I believe it a blessing to the people so could we stand as we want to go into the word this morning we have one service today there's no communion service just one service so not be because I have one service I'll take advantage of you and pay for 5 hours I could maybe just be for three praise the Lord I know you love okay so we want to read Mark chapter 7 reading from verse 14 and this is Jesus after the scribes and the Pharisees came to ask him why his disciples are not following traditions in the message of the yah that time washing pots and pans and so like that and and and whatnot because they believe that when you do this clean axe you know like washing pans and and peeling potatoes and so like that that they are fine so Jesus in Mark 7 verse4 I want to skip down and when he had called the people unto him he said unto them Heen unto me every one of you and understand there is nothing from within a man without a man that enter into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man if any man have ears to hear here let him hear and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable and he said unto them are ye not without understanding also do you not perceive that whatsoever thing from without enter a man it cannot defile him because it enter into his heart it entered not into his heart but into his belly and go it out into the draw and purchase all Meats he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man for from within not outside from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lishness an evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness all these evil things come from within and defile the man and let's go now to John chapter 14 I'm excited about the scripture sorry John 14 verse 28 and Jesus speaks you have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you if you love me you will rejoice because I I go unto my the father for the father is greater than I and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it come to pass he might believe Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and had nothing in me let's pray heavenly father I pray Jesus that your holy spirit will take the words tonight and open us up Lord like Revelation inspiration I have no idea which way this will go but I pray you bless Lord what's what you place upon my heart and may you uh release spirit's given words Spirit spoken words to your people to bring light and life granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen amen you may be seated Oh Praise godj I have a a context scripture I'd like to read and that's Romans 13:12 to4 it says the night is fast spent the days at hand let us therefore cast off the work of Darkness so so this is an exaltation here let us cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly so that's something you have to do by choice like forgiveness is not a feeling waiting to see if they repent first you you not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not serious forgiveness is a choice certain things is it's a choice to be honest to to do right it's a choice you choose that you don't have to feel nothing to do that you know you do what is right you will come out right the night is fast spent the days at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness let us put on the arm of light let us walk honestly in as in the day not in rioting drunkenness not in chambering wanness not in strife and envying I want to get to but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof what he is saying we could make provision for the flesh to Rob to steal to fornicate to adultery we could make that that's your choice amen but the Bible exal us make not provision in other words don't create the environment for the flesh to be misbehave and act up oh give the Lord some Praises all right so this verse we read this last scripture we read in John 14 and the Amplified Jesus was saying this here in verse 13 He Amplified I will not talk with you much more for the prince Evil Genius ruler of the world is coming and he has no claim on me he has nothing in common with me there is nothing in me that belongs to him and he has no power over me oh give the Lord hallelujah oh I feel good this morning just reading that this morning Hallelujah so I have a title out of the heart of men and I have an inspiration and it's from the Amplified of Jesus words there is nothing in me that belongs to him and that him is Satan so this is the goal this is the Target that you must have there must be nothing in you that belongs to the devil because if it is in you the devil coming for it [Laughter] oh give the Lord a praise if you have something that the devil that belongs to the Devil he's coming for it whether it be temper anger evil whatever whatever in the heart of man he coming for it Oh Glory but Jesus said Hallelujah he has nothing in common with me there is nothing in me that belongs to him and he has no power over me Oh Glory to God you have to have a desire to smoke to get to the smoke you have to have a desire to L to get to fornicate and adultery it has to be in you but if God get if you get that out to you the devil had no power over you because what you're subject to you are slave of oh give the Lord some Praises this morning Hallelujah Romans 13:14 and he Amplified but clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ and make no Provisions or indulge in the flesh put a stop to thinking about the evil Cravings of your physical nature to gratify his desire and lust oh praise the name of the Lord praise God praise God you can't stop them naked woman from walking the streets but you could turn your head from them you can't stop all the tattoo and all the na outside and all the hot pants and all the Min you can't stop that that is their business they're supposed to wear that because the devil is upon them but God supposed to be upon you oh give the Lord a shout you could turn your head you could say no you can't catch me in that oh glory to God Hal hallelujah praise God why hallelujah it's all taken out of you oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God so we devil hunting this morning we Satan chasing this morning we demon exposing this morning we are in for a fine time oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the first battle ever fought beginning heaven when Michael and his Angel fought against Lucifer and his angels his first Ed in Heaven Sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven it was thrown down from heaven and cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings that means whatever was up there was not human beings it fell on on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan here we go come to destroy God's creation he not come to shake hand and discuss you have a cup of coffee with you he come to destroy you he come to steal to Rob and to destroy don't play with him oh give the Lord a shout the devil of a job he come to steal to rub and to destroy you want to steal your joy steal your peace rub your Hallelujah give you frustration depression give you anger temper bad attitude that's the devil we talking about oh give the Lord some Praises Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this and D what his purpose was to destroy it then the battle begin here on Earth and begin in us and has been RIS ever since and I have this here the battle is not for money that's right houses cars my house better than your house you have a good house that your business know what devil is inside a good house you have is God inside your big house or what are not interested in your big house or your big car that not the battle let's go the battle is not for money houses lands cars my children bright than your children I am more than you the battle is not natural the battle is not against flesh and blood the battle is for The Souls of men [Applause] Satan is trading in Souls he's a soul Trader not a so year he is trading in Souls his object is to lead Souls astray and take them to hell when you take from this perspective you will see how Petty your thinking is and how small and Petty in your attit you are towards things that you go through and to trials and testing that you face why all these false prophets and teachers why they have so many of them to have a guy he said God spoke to him something happened June the 6th then he come back again June the 12th then right now I think July the 1st then July the 4th I see him I check check it on him such a liar I wish they could talk to that man you know so why you lying to these people he said I'm he said he said July the 24th now and the clongs and the the Dum Dum heads still making nice comments and yes he said this this the biggest this is the time for the biggest wealth transfer you'll find you have no stocks you'll find stocks somewhere you'll find money somewhere this is Satan send them you know why why to lead souls to Hell let's go he does not care what job you have he does not care what money you make if he can get you off the word that's it if he could mess up your family cut them off from God cut them off from church cut them off he get you you know what people lost lives as collateral damage of church Wass you know Souls got damaged because of ministers and what they teach and preach and what they share outside the pulpit let's go Ephesians 2 verse one said and you had he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin wherein in time pass ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the aall the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience Satan have many titles he no one title man this title for him here is the prince of the power of the air and this power Works where in Children of Disobedience so that Spirit have access to disobedient Hearts disobedient people people that wouldn't listen because God I wonder if I could find that see Dey think J 28 Give the Lord some [Applause] Praises jomy 28 I find it quickly it shall come to pass if thou shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command the this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee Thou shalt Heen if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God and then he said blessed thou sh be in the city blessed shalt thou be in the field blessed in thy basket thy store and so on but in he Amplified I want to just get a few words on top the verse one here says if you would listen diligently to the voice of the Lord your God being watchful to do all his Commandments which I command you this day the Lord your God will set you on high above all nations of the earth if you what listen in other words you have to read the word you have to listen to the word you have to listen to what God say coming to church and coming to three hours in a Sunday is not enough the devil have you 24/7 7 days a week and you're coming for a few time a few little [Applause] shap you cannot be a part-time Christian dealing with a full-time devil oh praise the Lord us give the Lord a shout you have to be serious about this battle it's coming to you it's coming to your house it's coming to your marriage it's coming to your job it's coming to your home home it's coming to a relationship oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises now Satan is not under the altar the Saints are there when the saints pass on they go under the altar is that right so he is in this atmosphere the prince of the power of the a as someone say for Dimension all right but Abraham from future home he say Satan is still here so he's not in hell that's right did you hear that the devil not in hell you know he is alive and well and not in hell I sound like a poem there

some shouts in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God let's go did you know the Bible said that he ascended up on high far above everything through Heaven yes this Earth belong to the devil through the fall this Earth was given to the devil because Adam give up his territorial rights to the Earth his legal rights to the Earth was given up when he fell every Kingdom of this world is governed by the devil that including TR United States and UK along with Germany France and the whole rest of them when he say every he means every do you believe that so if you fight to some place and you migrate and what not still devil charge he have a structure you know he he not running a pal you know he not say selling newspaper you know get extra extra real all about it he not doing nothing he has set up a rival Kingdom to rival with God he was one at the top Echelon of God's structure and Power he know what singing worship he was up there right he know what hierar he got a lust in his heart I will be like the most high I will sit in the congregation of the north Hallelujah he had pride inside of him go give the Lord some praises and he was able to convince some other fells like

by the devil listen we here to think that but the Bible say it is well I like this President and like that President you keep liking we hate to think that but the Bible says it is that's the reason we have wars and shooting and fighting and trouble is because the kingdom of this world is the kingdoms of the devil the Bible said so and in the great Millennium which is to come the Bible said Rejoice all the heavens and you holy prophets of the Earth for the kingdom of this Earth have become the kingdoms of Our Lord so it will change it will change and he shall ruin and Reign forever oh give the Lord some Praises that is what we will become we'll have no more war when he comes no more sickness no more trouble oh give the Lord a praise it's one of the greatest days when he ascended he call all Hallelujah Hallelujah all heaven was shut off of mankind Satan is the prince of the power of the air why at thou fallen from heaven or Lucifer no man could see the into Glory no man could understand because the power is just above us Heaven means atmosphere above then all of these Powers were shut off for mankind because of sin Let me just make a quick sis pointer here so Satan climax is to get a Superman that he can use so that the whole world will bow to him he has not canceled his desire to be like the most high and to be worshiped he has not canceled that if you think he canel that he he canel that the body of this Superman will be titled the Antichrist Spirit then the false prophet and then the Beast Satan is going to Incarnate in himself yes sir in a man see the spirits as beings without bodies beings without houses being looking for bodies that they can use but brand here we find out that Satan after being kicked out of heaven incarnates incarnates himself into the Beast now he's Beast he's Antichrist false prophet and now Beast given the name of death on the Earth he is Satan's representative on the earth so now you'll understand the importance of we heading towards a one world government or how all the nations of the bow under the Beast structure that will be built with technology and Satan himself so Satan was waiting for this Advanced technological age to establish his system on the Earth that is where artificial intelligence come right in and then he could step into it it going to be artificial no more you know he will be the intelligence behind them he is Satan represent on Earth and he is now the head of the kingdom of the world the very same Kingdom he offered to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4 Satan now becomes a full King oh Hallelujah so watch something now he's in heaven he want to be like the most high he got kicked out fell on the earth he has no body he could use so it's just roaming Spirits roaman Spirits roaming Spirits he can't going into the dinosaur and the and and all them creatures that they had before the fall and whatnot he can't go into them things they waiting to see what going on go said let us make man in our image he can't touch Adam because Adam is original God gave adam some time to learn work and word he introduce woman to Adam yet these nowadays they have it mixed up have it kind of tired so Adam working in the garden and Eden working laboring toiling there was no man to tell the soil Adam was that man one man Adam man and then God his word eat eat of every tree and was cool with that problem he AR with the tree he AR with nobody then God say it's not good for man dwell alone people out Eve Satan saw opportunity aha Adam going to work here's Eve sat pull table coffee chair and coffee and what talk things invite Eve to the table and tell you be like God God knows God know something he didn't tell all Now Eve wasn't there when God spoke to Adam Eve heard from Adam God spoke to Adam Eve should have said hold on hold it hold it wait till my husband come home that's right she didn't do that man fell so now the devil get an opportunity or he gets a doorway to enter in oh give the Lord some Praises he get somebody he could use he had to find somebody you know if everybody he had clear and clean and pure and have right objective and motive no devil have nobody to use you know but once that people with corrupt and all kind of things he have somebody could use they I seen K they I seen this they seen that they feel this and they feel that and they feel the passage should Mo and I feel that and they don't like that and all kind of foolishness all that is Satan inside have nothing to do with the word of God you know the word of God is pure when God found me I was a rank Sinner and God called me and I Repent of my sins I have to repent I wasn't say too I was a sinner oh G God rich and mercy come to me do something with my heart that I have to repent of my sins Oh Glory to God and His Mercy kept me all these years through and I am pressing on and I am still in a battle and I am still fighting and we are fighting this morning oh give the Lord a shout I hope this wake you up that you could become a Christian Soldier marching on to war it's a war that is going on glory to God we fighting for healing we fighting for Revival we are fighting for breakthrough we are fighting for people to come out their prison and to snap out of what you're in [Applause] Hallelujah Satan has not changed his original agenda to be as the most high and to be worshiped this he will achieve temporarily with full complete World dominating political power and I can read the scripture from you from Luke chapter 4 uh verse 5 and this is and the devil take Jesus to high mountain showed him all the kingdom of the world in a moment of time so he have technology all these screens come on the devil said unto him he this all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it so this is not a devil without power now he is conscious of his position he is conscious of what he have to give and what he don't have to give let's continue he said if thou therefore will worship me all shall be n just give me some praise just give me some worship that's why it's so great to be here this morning and he you worshiping the Lord oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah now the devil know if Jesus did that and the people worship Jesus is ready worshiping the devil because the devil would have been behind Jesus did you get it he said devil he said you worship me and you will be in charge and Jesus answerto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve the prophet said this now is an age he said fear Little Flock do not fear the AG is closing fast closing as it does those tears will be bound together and as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they will have tremendous three-fold strength of political physical and spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure amen fear not those things that are coming upon the Earth for he who love his own love them unto the end so on Earth this guy he is Satan's representative on the earth he is now head of the kingdoms of the world the very same Kingdom he offered to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4 Satan become full King he is false prophet now he will become the Beast after a while when he breaks his Covenant with the Jews no he will be given a heart of the beast at that time so now the man will be a nice man a good man a loved man a respected man an educated man but then at that time he'd be given the heart of the Beast oh give the Lord a praise now all what is to come has already been you know Hitler was anointed with Devils you know Hitler killed so much Jews Stalin and mus Anointed with Devils you know hois and tootsies Spirit of Slaughter is already on the earth you know it's not coming it's already here you know they don't demonstrate what they can do already oh glory to God men with no heart men with no soul praise God men from hell oh give the Lord some Praises we are in the greatest battle ever fought there's the greatest message God could have sent to the Earth is only to a 20th century Prophet that we could see what we see and you could hear what you hear we have a lot to thank God for this morning oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God at that time you may be seated he will be given a heart of a beast let me just say this here I just hear a lot of people calling for Biden to step down and withdraw he say he not join he going through but you know what every man everybody know he's a dead man walking except him who is behind him who is shadowing him who's behind the whole system behind there oh we going through some we going to have a Time coming here Jesus Jesus described these are the beginning of Sorrows right now I don't know if you know it have so much of floods in China in Switzerland in Germany all wrong is just a set of natural disasters going on right now it will intensif all right let's continue I skip this okay I'll read this he has three powers three jurisdiction Earth Heaven Purgatory he himself have a trinity and he writes the Trinity is powers in the Trinity is CR in the Trinity all three stages of this his ministry makes him one person Satan incarnate Antichrist false prophet and Beast same person Antichrist is the spirit Spirit waiting to inhabit a body and holy spirit is here waiting to inhabit your body amen am Jesus is with them and told them I'll be in you it wasn't physical Jesus in them was Spirit are you with me now Antichrist false prophet and Beast tree typing and then he said watch God make himself known too in water blood and spirit it makes a Christian a Son of God by the word of God these three powers makes him a devil and here is water blood and Spirit which makes you a Son of God isn't that right political religion and Demon power mixed together makes him the devil rians 13:4 says and they worshiped the dragon which give power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him that time the beast on top of his game in the amplifier it says they fell down and paid homage to the dragon because he had bestowed on the Beast all his Dominion now you know who the dragon is dragon is Satan Satan is that Dragon he bestowed unto the Beast all his dominion and Authority they also praise and worship the Beast exclaiming who is much for the Beast who can make war against them Russian 137 says and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him here's the Beast now over all kindreds and tongs and Nations you mean I'm not just reading a text no you mean this going to happen yes you're sitting there watching me and this is real this is not newspaper there's not some magazine this is word of God that can't return void power given to him over all Kindred and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him all all that means the prime ministers the teachers the professors the doctors the lawyers who have subjects who do have subjects who have passes who do have passes who have money who High who low who poor who Rich who B who free all all will worship all will worship him except those whose names are not written lamb Book of Life if you know by Revelation that God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you should be ever grateful just when whether you could pay your mortgage or not whether you lose your house or not whether you lose your roof you lose your car you lose your job it doesn't matter he put your name on the Lamb's Book of [Applause] Life Glory all right Matthew 12 Hallelujah 22-30 and this is one of the core Parts we're going to go into this evening Matthew 12:22 to 38 says then was brought unto him for Jesus one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him in so much that the Blind and the dumb both spake and saw and all the people were amazed and said is not this this the son of God David and when the Pharisees heard it so the people saying this had to be the son of David right that's positive when the Pharisees heard that testimony they said this fellow do not cast out Devils but by B the prince of devils let's continue verse 45 and Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them listen to Jesus words now every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to Desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself then how shall his kingdom stand let's pull two or three things out of that number one Satan's kingdom is not divided and number two he has a kingdom and Jesus acknowledged that let me read it again for you if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand so Satan's kingdom is standed because it's not divided he said every house divided will fall all and if I by belb cast out Devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come unto you what is he saying all these years nobody never seek Devil's cast out the closest to it was David playing the H and an evil spirit giv saw a break but they never saw that so this deaf and dumb person give Jesus an opportunity to demonstrate to the world and to the people there's another Kingdom at work because I free the dumb and deaf from their condition showing you there is a different level there's a supernatural there's another level that you're not see with your eyes and I am from this Kingdom of Light and that is the kingdom of darkness oh give the Lord some praises glory to God blind kingdom of darkness affecting blindness and dff and Demon whatever it is and he came from the kingdom of light and releasing them from that and what he did that he exposed Satan Kingdom Hallelujah by the words that they were sa he said no no no no no no no no no I a coming through belzebub is this is the spirit of God oh give the Lord a shout in the house and one day maybe today I don't know one day his kingdom will be exposed by the kingdom of of Light by the manifestation of the sons of God they will come forth they will declare God they will Express God they will show God they will show what is hiding behind the scenes what is hiding behind individuals oh give the Lord I shout you have not light a man the light to the Holy Ghost oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises Jesus vers 28 says if I cast all Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God Has Come unto you amen but then Jesus went down a little further and deeper he says this or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house he's talking about a strong man a strong man having a stronghold a strong man the home well protected EB proof he have other agents inside of there and he say how could you spoil that man go except you bind the strong man the little people running around the house and that they not they no influence is The Man Behind that and beond everything have a spirit you know there a man behind that Spirits just be affecting homes individuals churches families countries Spirit strong men then he said he that is not with me is against me and he that GTH not with me scattered abroad I want to take that first part there he that's not with me is against me in other words Jesus makes sure there there is no neutral grounds it's either you're for or you're against if the devil and your husband you can't stand by your husband with that devil on him you have to stand with the word if I see you standing with your husband and you have a devil and him you are not for Jesus because he said I come to bring a sword father against son mother against daughter I bring a sword for the word's sake we come compromise with our children we are not standing by the word if you stand by the word you will tell them the truth because Jesus said you you shall know the truth and the truth going to set you free not when you compromise when you tell them the truth oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises my God help me Jesus we have no communion this evening so I as well take this three [Applause] hours Romans 5 let's see you get from there I have so much scriptures so much stuff here but it's solid stuff that you could think about and meditate on and I'm hoping and trusting that this word will bring Clarity in your spirit that the battle truly is not flesh and blood why you fighting me because you seen my flesh you're not listen to the word that you're hearing verse 17 of Romans 5 for If by one man offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men in the justification of life here we go for as by one man Disobedience many were made Sinners here we go by one Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound and where sin abound here we go Grace did much more abound that as Sin had reigned unto death even so might grace Reign unto righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord could we give the Lord some Praises where sin AB Grace much more bound chapter 6 Paul went on and Paul pressing the word what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May AB because he's saying people can take that script and run with it you know more grace more sin as you sin you get more Grace with he sin it's not working so you know that man thoughts and ideas so Paul Paul answered that and said shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound he said God forbid how shall we that de to sin live any longer know ye not that so many of us that were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized unto his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism andto death and like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life it's a walk in the newness of life you're going back to your old friends well back in school days now who upon them in school is the didn't know them you know better now but you're going back and you're talking and you know your I'm your friend your friend and when the friend to off mask sat p is a friend mask he is trading in souls he would use a friend a cousin a husband a wife whoever he could use to get you off track amen knowing this verse six our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin not how he bring his words he that is dead is so if you put a cof on a manide is supposed to be dead and when you look so g a wink ey not only when you get frightened you know but you know that man cing his ey like I saw a few recently and a man talking to the dead I tell myself dead can hear nothing but you can see giving some warnings and I don't know what he's giving there that's how Christians are sometime you know they supposed to be dead but his hand going up God put hand now head go push on the head footstep Pi up get him out the C from man Not Dead Alive wrong burial you can't bury that what God want is death and we have to understand this is required to deal with this devil we have to deal with for that he died he died un verse 10 sin once that he liveth liveth unto God verse 11 likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead inde deed not to sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin reign in your mortal body he is saying sin could reain in you let not sin reain in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God so this ties in with your body as a Living Sacrifice this ties in with you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost this time with you are Tabernacle of God you are a house that God want to dwell in and when you accept that and grasp that and meditate on that and think about that you would want your body to be in subject to the very word of God and you will see in Clarity the Rapture is not outside in the Rapture is inside out what you have on the inside will change what you have on the outside oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God the secret is what the word is in the bride it's in the bride heart hallelujah praise God she'll have something the inside and just as what as in the inside defile a man what the inside could purify a man God put something on the inside of you to purify You by his Spirit by by the power of God coming inside you oh glory to God what transformed Peter from a coward denying Christ into a land of tribe of Judah it was the spirit of God coming upon Him is was his inheritance being divided to him it was he getting his portion oh give the Lord some praises today Hallelujah but uh Paul ver said but thank but God be thanked that we were Servants of sin he you were Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine that was delivered you being then made free from sin you became Servants of righteousness and that's what I want to challenge you to become become a servant of righteousness I speak after the man of men because of the infirmity of your flesh as he have yielded your members and servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto Holiness for when you were Servants of sin ye were free from righteousness what fruit had ye when you those things thereof you're now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit unto Holiness and the end end eternal life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord this scripture I remember these scriptures we to learn it by heart you know guess what remember testifying to people wages of sin is death your Bible a lot of scriptures you just know by heart you know you know where to find them the W of sin is death but the gift of God eternal life through Jesus Christ now we come back to this text we talk about Jesus say I will not talk much with you for the prince The Evil Genius rule of the world is coming he has no claim on me he has nothing in common with me there is nothing in me that belongs to him he has no power over me when God told the prophet uh you have been given power to bind a m but be more sincere it was something that God was seeing not man everybody was seeing that's a prophet that's God's servants and everything else now note what God did he didn't tell him if you be more say you will get power note what happened to Jesus he didn't went into willingness to get power the power came on him and he was filled with the fullness of the Holy Ghost and he was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness so he didn't go fasting to get power he had power and went into fasting so the prophet was given power and then he went and fast because God says Be more sincere and he wanted to do something to show God he get the message and he want to apply something to his heart and life he didn't just say oh you say be more say all right Lord thank you Lord hallelujah Glory Glory more sincere and do nothing no if God speak you act on it if God speak you do something about it you don't let God word be wasted because he is God that's why God hate people going to other gods going to some kind of Voodoo or necromancy or some kind of funny business and burn candle left backward and all kind like that because what you're doing you're replacing him for that like that you're showing that you have more confidence in that foolishness and that Idol or whatever it is that's what you have confidence in and he hates that you got a curse come upon you for doing that he said have no other gods before me I am the Lord thy God have no other gods before me don't bring your grandfather God and your grandmother God and whatever Godly family have don't bring that burn it destroy it have no other gods before me oh give the Lord some Praises don't try nothing that apply to horoscope and think to you people reading to see what what the horoscope you know which word in know you I'm I'm April I'm this and Sagittarius I'm the crab cers get upset for them things all right so Jesus saying he has nothing common in with me there's nothing in me that belongs to him he has no power over me there was nothing the devil could pull in Jesus there's nothing there he can't put money and pull him he can't put popularity and pull him he can't put woman and pull him because there's nothing in there for him to pull there is nothing in me that belongs to the devil oh give the Lord some praises and the bride going to strike that give the Lord a shout the bride going to strike that it are some people who know you and they know to

okay that's okay that's okay every devil have to go every Spirit have to leave come up into his presence come up into the anointing r [Applause] [Music] [Applause] aned may be seated so Satan doesn't have any legal rights the bride by the revealing of the seals and by the open book have now have legal rights The Voice told John which typed the Brin go to the angel not go to jville no didn't say that it said go to the angel not go to some man in Trinidad it didn't say that it said go to the and says give me the book that's personal I took it I eat it amen and he said as he eat it you could prophesy you could prophesy because the time is not yet you prophesy until the time comes when the time comes you can say like Jesus this day this scripture is fulfilled in the hearing of your air until that time prophesy your healing prophesy your breakthrough prophesy your deliverance prophesy all what your family had in the linage it broken prophesy that too prophesy no weapon form against you go Prosper prophesy Oh Glory to God the Lord himself went everywhere with there prophesy you will be delivered you're going to go free [Applause] prophesy and we have been doing it for years and now we have the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy Let's Go hallu part of Satan's Advantage is our ignorance or lack of knowledge as to the operation of his kingdom which is not divided ignorance of the enemy's Kingdom strategies and operations so the Scribe and phes bear in mind D put and and ritual and all kind of ceremony and Stuff This Man Called Jesus is like a rebel he is stressing them out he is doing stuff that they never saw them before but when this dumb and deaf man SC they couldn't handle it because Jesus pull out the WRA over Satan's kingdom and showing that this dumb and deaf and all these things is from another real and I have power over that real all the strong men that was binding death on them I binding them so the death could go free the dumb could go free the blind could go free whatever was binding upon them the strong man upon the life are binding that so he exposed them for trying to accuse him of dealing with the devil he was showing he had a better Kingdom a greater Kingdom a more powerful Kingdom light will always overcome Darkness truth will always overcome ignorance oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises let me continue here the activities of the enemy has intensified against the body of Christ two forces two kingdoms and the human being are at the intersection of this battle remember this battle did not start on Earth but we are in the middle of it God want you and the devil want you you are a Target 40% say Amen let me say it again so you wouldn't miss who we're talking to you are a Target of the enemy two Realms of authority two forces two kingdoms the Kingdom of Light versus the kingdom of darkness the kingdom of righteousness versus the kingdom of wickedness Jesus said he that is not with me is against me who is with me with me is the word you cannot be neutral you either with the word or you're not with the word I a sure I a no no no no no you're a liar there is no neutrality he said that he that is not with me is against me there's a line to draw and be drawing that line today so I don't have no problem who want to leave the church I say bye-bye see ministers have the heart hurting who leave and and who that a child and what I don't have that problem sorry and Min and and and conation P husband to the conation sorry I'm husband to and Mar not three kind of Believers sorry I one wife her name is anir a woman that I love one wife you understand that so this line that we drawing it's a line you know oh yeah Jesus said he that not with me is against me the Bible exal us Mark those who cause division among us as I said everybody lights up a room some when they come in and some when they go out but everybody do light up a room too many of us here we go are casual about this battle it's a great conflict it's a spiritual war that is going on it is dangerous it is deadly many Souls have been lost many Souls have this written here fell from the collateral damage of children was and the ministers don't care many children are out of fellowship and the parents don't care it's the devil upon the parents they don't care over the years I observed religious Spirits one thing I have seen with religious spirit they don't care about the family they care about their conviction they care about what they see in the word and what the Lord showing them and they care about their dream but it's to hell with the family family go to hell do here because my attitude is this if I can't make it I want my children to make [Applause] it I have seen it for myself I know religious Spirits they think they spiritual but they're not they're religious and they are the worst Sinners to ever encounter because they they are message folks and they could quach your track stuff but they are in hell in their Church in the message it have sisters who figure they're so spiritual they wouldn't even listen to their husband no respect and the words say know husband love your wife wife reference your husband but they not giv no reference no respect they don't care is a religious spirit they can't stay home that why they had to come to church because that is what the feed off of they feed off of that they feeding off of what they have woman in is a religious spirit Satan not caring about who part and dancing he have them already a that's that different section then of his band what he cares about is church folks what did the Bible talk about the adulterous woman the adulterous woman hunts the precious Soul she hunting an adulterous man you know looking for church folks precious Souls that we are to protect and we have to present the word I share with you already that how how provos was my key book that kept me as a young man and when I see early 17 years old when I see his money woman popular I said see them three things I I focus on them Tre things I put a magnifying glass I see if to watch myself to make sure that that air throw me down I to fight for my life fight on the job one time one woman push a move I ring she said nothing I ring she she said nothing they B you know and men getting more timid timid timid timid and women walking like they conquerors how look left and right before they pray for the meal in your office watching there's an agenda of Satan to emasculate men there's an agenda of Satan to make man more sissified all of that is part of the agenda of Satan Hallelujah number 13 America woman woman Prophet Prophet long time one day they go woman give him the vote and they go vote the wrong man and everything else he say a woman Nation well he prophesied one day a woman will sit down right on top that Throne whether Catholic church or a physical woman but he he prophesied that all we have to say I can't interpret the prophecy I just wait to see if the prophecy will come to pass whoever going sit on that Throne is not them it's who going behind them doesn't matter who they are you know it's one Brotherhood up there one Brotherhood you know all right you cannot see the enemy with your eyes or smell this enemy with your nose you cannot use your physical senses the enemy is not imaginary the enemy is real and the enemy is after your soul the enemy is after your walk with God your consecration your dedication this enemy is spiritual this enemy is deceptive is brother and sister over your enemy if you see it so then you are deceived and the devil is upon you I have this written here I ain't talking to my mind you know you some people who has drink and when they drink then they talk they talk what they talk normal they drink and they they say it and if you come back to them and tell you say so I was I was drinking I was drinking we not drinking is brother and sister over your enemy if you see it so then you are deceived and the devil is upon you white fight everything we do cuz Satan is the resistor just push resistant hard brother that people you're meeting with them and everybody talking a certain way in harmony what not and there always somebody who have a opposing kind of thing meet some one brother say he like to he like to provoke he like to well I a not looking for provocation I look in one mind one Accord I looking coming against everybody say blue and blue and blue and blue looking nice and you well red red red I see red six people five say blue and you B in red I standing with my red standing with your red paint your house red but if the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister say Lord yes don't let me never have a root of business and spring up it will affect him it will take Christ out of my life so somebody love the Lord and I remember my wife when we travel early years there's a sister I think I tell this already sister came and tell my wife so much of stories and about what happening up there in New York and things when my wife came back to me she had a FR when I say she FR like she had stick out then with all the stuff I say an Mar you see all that you he there dump it just drop that like a hot potato so I had to protect my wife I said just drop it because we don't know we are in Ministry and we don't know what challenges we would have so I can't judge the operations of another church another group and she listen she just dump it and she press on now if I tell her it's so that is what they doing now you see where going now I'm feeding what I have not confirmed verified or whatever it is I am feeding and then we go end up in a kind of and then watching things going of cook ah ahuh and you know when the devil Tres to anoint your head he make you

something that she didn't even know in her reaction something has happened within her that is a discovery and brother brandham says when you feed on the word old leaves fall off new leaves coming and

you can get free some you bang by Bong by Sin from years ago from family environment and whatnot and upset and it's still hanging over you it's still hanging I know it but you could go free today we don't want to play with the little imps in front of the yard guard in the gate we want to get to this strong man that's the man you to bind but take a stronger man to bind that strong man it's not a weak man and it's a strong man you know that strong man have the ground fortified you know fool you have a garage might open anybody can come in no it's fortified you have Gs you have Lookouts real tactic to get to this strong man but then you go and spoil his Goods all right brother BR the PO that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle it will kill the spirit of God and drive it away from here and hurt your pastor we fight for the worship because we fight for the atmosphere we fight to keep a certain quality of spirit in the church if the anointed is not here we as well closeup shop I am not going to sit down and talk like talking to Jehovah Witness and a dry as a biscuit and you dry and I dry all of us dry we just try out it can't work so it has to be an atmosphere that we know we in the presence of God and we come here to worship we are come here to sweat and spit spit and sweat and sing and woke up and woke up we not here for that we here to bring you the word of God that you could receive and grasp that could inspire you and anoint you because we can be emotional does don't mean we are saved because we go to church don't mean we are saved don't believe those enticing Spirits a real spirit of God a real word of God is the truth of God which is the seed of God will produce God in your life you'll be Godly saintly holy amongst a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth become tattling and back bitings and all kind of Godly things brother that is sulfuric acid in the church it is demon power Spirit of men and women who get among one another and try to push off and say this one is not right that one is not right that's one not right and if you chase it down nine times out of 10 is the very person making this thir that is not right God hates Discord among Brethren not he dislike it or you have less love for it he that's why the Bible say mark them that cause division among you stand by him and as long as you know your life is diving up with the spirit the Bible with purity of heart purity of thought love towards your brother try your best to build the kingdom of God doing those things and dressing right living right talking right going right places you can have all the emotions you want and everybody will believe you amen I'll close Okay so I have 16 pages and I reach page 11 and I guess maybe I'll continue when I'll see what the Lord will do but this is the part a key part we want to get to Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle here we go not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of D World against spiritual high places four four things identify principalities one Powers two rules of Darkness three and spiritual wickedness for so Satan's kingdom has structure it have a hierarchy it have an order principalities Powers rulers of darkness and wickedness principalities rulers rulers spirits that rule over Nations over cities every nation have a ruling Spirit but said way every nation of a spirit is a national Spirit a spirit a culture France have a spirit Germany have a spirit that spirit not the Holy Spirit train of a spirit Jamaica of a spirit it is not the Holy Spirit that's why I told the brothers say if we don't get rid of the train Spirit how could we get to the Holy Spirit you're not trying to conform train is the message trying to get Train Kill in other words you want to get rid of your train that spirit and get in the Holy Spirit I saw the ho Spirit fell in India and when I saw how they acted I say it's one Holy Spirit it makes you behave the same way whether it fall in Russia Germany Poland it doesn't matter once the Holy Spirit come and make it be a certain way I'll wrap up here ruling Spirits ruling over United States Russia China Trinidad and these ruler Spirits is all to carry out Satan's plan hey could could you bear with me tonight hallu say press on the ruling spirit is what is what inspires unrighteous laws remember hmon hmon get a personal fight you know he's under the king and he get fight with modai modai Bo and all kind of like next minute hmon craftily come to make this King right a law to kill the Jews that's what those Spirits are for they bringing laws that will endanger the Bride come against the church San have his men already in places oh my I almost kept that a little bit praise God right principalities powers Powers come to influence you spend more time more time on social media more time on YouTube than the word more time in not praying more time on WhatsApp more time talking on your phone when talk and Y on your phone you can't talk to God at all you're tired your mouth tired not talking to God talking to family friends relatives wherever it is bringing fion and choose and the vision in the home Powers begin to get offended powers and in under day you get all kind of working going on that get the um what you call it the mother law from Hell Hing over the children that supposed to be on their own standing Powers spiritual wickedness then have rulers of Darkness witchcraft occult horoscope astrology false Vision then is of wickedness lawlessness homosexuality lesbianism incest the strong man strong man over people's lives amen golad was the golad of Gat he was the champion of G in other words he was the champion of a territory they bring him like a outside man to challenge Israel this was the mighty challenge of gol got but David was going to show that gol God he's not golat of Israel wrong territory because when God start to appoint power and authority is over territory when Satan start to move he moving over territory and we have to understand what is our territory and when you recognize your family is your territory and God give that to you then you have to make claims on your territory what is to be oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah don't sit down and let the devil run through your territory he is a territorial being all these kingdoms are Ms and I will give it to that's how we talking when you have to know what is yours and you can fight for what you know is yours that's why you come to get a revelation of what you know is yours and if you know it's yours fight for it glory to God what are you fighting for brother over I'm fighting for a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle I'm fighting for a Revival I'm fighting for an outpouring I am fighting to S Mark 16 St John [Applause] 14:12 oh my [Applause] never see me drink water when you see when you see me drink water you know when you know I take any second get now all right James 1 2 to 4 says my brethren come all joy when you fall into divers Temptations doing this TR your faith with at patience that patience have a perfect work that he may perfect in time one in nothing James 12 1:12 blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them that love him let no man say when he's tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempted he any man but every man is tempted how how when he is drawn away by his own lust that lust is not outside that lust is inside drawn away by his own lust and enticed when lust had conceived L get pregnant it bringeth forth sin and When sin is finished it bringeth forth death so this whole thing about lust whole thing about Temptation it starts within whatever is in the heart of man it starts right there and you could change by what you say and believe in your own heart that today is your day and you are going to be delivered you have to want to be delivered I have encountered people that do not want to be delivered they want to be in church they want to argue they want to fight they don't want Deliverance when you want Deliverance you have no time with nobody else and their worries it's you want Deliverance that woman with the blood isue she said if I could just Touch the Hem of His G and she pressed away and she was delivered oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah now James said here now in the ified every person is tempted when he's drawn away enticed and baited by his own evil desire lust and passion and then the evil desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin and sin when it's fully matured bring forth death do not be misled my brethren and then 1 Corinthians 10 oh we going quickly here to talk about all bapti to Moses all e spiritual meet and something like that verse 7 says neither verse 8 neither let us commit fornication some of them committed fell in one day three and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ nether M verse 11 verse 11 now all these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admission upon whom the ends of the world have come wherefore let him that take he stand that take heedlessly fall there's a part they had no temptation taken you but such as is come to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that he are able now you have to believe this here now they want to do it I see the P there but no was a teeth but the devil made me do it the devil make you do it you wanted to do it P is on your purse what your hand do inside the purse didn't want to my hand your hand not moving on his own you know you see you see get we have choices to make friends if you want to get your prayer time if you want to get that turple closet if you want to get that all alar that place it don't have to be long nobody tell you go and spend 2 hours going to Bush somewhere and hide away for four five 6 hours no you could spend 5 minutes 10 minutes wherever consistent regular with God the scriptures with the word and you say Lord I Want Your Presence to go before me because we right Final Friday in God's presence you can't sin in God's presence there's no sin when people think God is not around they doing all kind of crazy stuff what you got is Bel drinking wine in the in in in the the cups and the Garment all them fellowshiping laughing DJ rocking the music and with

word you have been weighed and found in the band found wanting your kingdom is lost me and Pion right outside they finish right there and then so that's all the foolish we can overcome and you can't do and get fight and all that nonsense when P come all that done you know John fell as one dead is a different thing you know because it's not man you dealing with it's God when that power came down on the M SI they said don't let God speak let Moses speak and people stood have far off them s the back off one time he M shaken did you see the picture of the storm the barrel when was moving that

shaken right towards my imagination I say my mind that time is the Earth shaking a good thing I was lying up all right I'm going to close but the Amplified of this is powerful for no temptation no trial regarded as enticing to sin no matter how it comes or where it leades has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man so the test and the trial is common to man it is common to man that is is no temptation or trial come to you that is beyond human resistant that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to the human experience as such as can beer but God is faithful to his word and to his compassionate nature and he can be trusted not to let you be tempted and tried and assayed beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure but with the Temptation he will always provide the way the means of Escape or a landing place oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God God Will Make A Way God Will Make A Way you have a heart for Him He will make a way Joseph did not give him the poyer's wife he ran for his life oh give the Lord a shout in the house it was a choice that he made was the right choice oh my mus come please Bible talk about the time will come that they will not endure song Doctrine but after their own lust they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears the Amplified says heral and preach the word keep your sense of urgency stand and be at hand and ready whether the opportunity seems to be favorable or unfavorable whether it is convenient or inconvenient whether it is welcome or unwelcome you as a preacher of the word are to show people in the way that their lives are wrong and convince them rebuking and correcting warning and urging and encouraging them for the time will come here we go about the close when people will not tolerate or endure song and wholesome instruction but having itching ears for something pleasing and gratifying they will Garner to themselves one teacher after another in considerable number chosen to satisfy their own liking hear this part and to Foster the errors that they hold so these people that Len after these teaching the itching ears the teachers confirming what in them you know so Paul exposed the church to Christ and then he had to rebuke them have you receed another man have you received another Spirit what kind of seeu in spirit that you're allow to Slick you away from the word of God praise God I'm going to close begin to play something but was praying a prayer and he was challenging the devil as I'm going to
