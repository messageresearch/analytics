join us and we want to appreciate it we're not going to tear for granted we want to thank you so much for being in this room with us so tonight i i'll be taking a study tonight and i have something i'd like to share with you let's go you cannot defeat a full-time devil being a part-time christian there are so many just want to do the minimum to get by eat at school at home [Music] in a marriage or on the job taking enough of the word to make you feel comfortable but not convicted not convicted of anything the desire to be an excellent worker excellent student excellent silver in order to strive to the mark or move to a higher level it will take something and that is what i want to speak on tonight this has been the backbone of my life my ministry my marriage this part of my core is not something you're born with it is something that you can develop by the grace of god not your feelings not your emotions not your thoughts but your commitment and that is what i want to title this bible study tonight just one small word commitment and if you have your bible i'd like to turn to luke chapter 9 and we want to read from verse 56 to 62. it's a bible study you should have your bible nearby and try to follow with us with the scriptures because in it as life and this is jesus luke 9 verse 56 jesus speaking he said for the son of man is not come to destroy men's lines but to save them and they went to another village and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee with us over thou goeth and jesus said unto him foxes are holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man had not where the layers here and he said unto another follow me this is jesus tell us follow me he said lord suffer me first the one bury my father and jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go down and preach the kingdom of god and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at whom at my house and look listen to jesus words here in verse 62 and jesus said unto him no man having put his hands to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god you know by this scripture here you can see jesus was practical jesus was real he spoke truth he didn't fool them or tried to play a game with word games with them he said it plainly no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god in other words if you see it run with it if you see it hold it being committed meaning pledged or born to a certain course or policy abraham was committed elijah was committed let's turn to the book of root and look at chapter one we want to look at the book of root it's a beautiful book i just some time um you know we could get down in that book but it's that and i want to appreciate but isaac at this time i want to know sometimes he's weary and tired but you want to appreciate him and right where you are could give him a little applause he can't hear you but we certainly want to appreciate and he has is the one that had this burden for his bible class a long time not way before we had the pandemic way before we had all resumed he had that burden and said then like if we could get something with the bible a bible study so we certainly appreciate that it has been his burden and god has tremendously blessed it root chapter one read verse one now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land the citizen man of bethlehem judah went to journal in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons first thing is supposed to stay where god put you but they leave the land and they went to moa and the name of the man was amalek the name of his wife naomi the name of his two sons malone chilean ephratites of bethlehem judah and they came into the country of moab and continued there and mlx naomi husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives the woman of moa the name of the one was offer the other name of the other was ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years marlon chilean died also both of them and woman was left of her two sons and a husband then she arose with her daughter-in-laws that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard here we go in the country of moab oh that the lord has visited his people and given them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return to the land of judah and naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the lord be kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me the lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them they lifted up their voice and went and they said until surely we will return with thee unto thy people and no naomi said turn again my daughters why will he go with me are there any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands tell them again my daughters go away if i'm too old to have a husband and if i should have i have hope if i should have a husband also tonight should also be a sons would you tarry for them till they are grown would you stay for them having husbands me my daughters for it grievously much for your sakes that the hand of the lord has gone out against me and they lifted up the voice and ripped again an offer kissed her mother-in-law and root clave unto her she said behold my sister-in-law is going back unto her people unto her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law and root said entreat me not to leave thee or return from following after thee for whether thou goest i will go where thou lodges i will lodge thy people shall be my people and my and thy god my god where thou diest will i die where will i and dear will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but that part d and me and when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking with her isn't that a beautiful scripture tonight two daughter-in-laws one went back and once stood there and says your god with my god where are you who i go are you losing a lodge my people shall be my people and thy god shall be my god she was steadfast she was she made up her mind she made a clear and clean decision and her commitment to go all the way to the point where she could see where thou diest will i die and where will i be there will i be buried the lord do so to me and most this word commitment and this is like a dictionary of meaning of it the state or quality of being dedicated to a cause activity the cinnamon synonym loyalty faithfulness responsibility obligation duty burden an agreement a pledge to do something in the future a commitment to improve the definition of a commitment is a promise or agreement to do something that is what a commitment not to talk to do an example of commitment is marriage or go into business with someone a state of being emotionally or intellectually devoted as to a belief a cause or action or another person we want to look at commitment to god and i want to read from deuteronomy chapter 27 of your bibles verse 7 deuteronomy chapter 27 verse 7 and this is being spoken to israel and thou shalt offer peace offerings and shall eat there and rejoice before the lord thy god this is verse 7 of deuteronomy 27 and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly now let me pause a minute holy bible right there now remember these people were 400 plus years in egypt they were familiar with egyptian food stars gods and everything else ghosts and a prophet moses to bring them out to bring them to this mountain of god to give them lords to give them words to give them truths because they didn't know this god that's why moses asked god who shall i say send me because this kind of people not easy you can't just say god send me they're not going to just take that you have to have backup you have to have vindication so understand this this word is not a game this word is a revelation of course nature operation desires what he wants from us what he deserves what he expects that he himself has a commitment to his word actually he and his word is the same he has to keep his word in order to be god verse nine and moses and the priests the levites speak unto all israel saying take heed and or israel this day though i become the people of the lord thy god so he's introducing them this day the what become the people of the lord thy god thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god and do his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day amen let's look at joshua chapter 24 and verse 14. and then we go back to deuteronomy 10 let's go to joshua chapter 24 verse 14 and now therefore fear the lord serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and still be the lord and on a pausing minute some time ago i was thinking and i didn't i haven't really worked on it but it was coming to me about idolatry about god something brother isaac struck it on sunday you could make this a god a kya god and whatnot and if there was ever age of gods is this age facebook is like a god social media is like a god don't talk about the phone you know i it's almost like it's a worship with this thing called this cell phone this this phone you know long time it had no pictures it had no screen long time you stand up with a coin there was a dial up you had to wait in line to put your coin to make dials up to talk to somebody and then you had the phone where you had no pictures you're pressing and you just put your ears on your top but now it's it's like a tv neon it's everything that is right there in the palm of your hand like a god people use it for everything and it could become an idol you have to glance at it you have to look at it you have to look at what's up who sent me a message you have to look at this and look at that and it takes away it takes time to do all of that deuteronomy chapter 10 we want to go into it so sometimes i'm going to go into it because they have gods and um gods you have not a god before you so you can't quit social media you can't put cell phone you can't put anything before god it has to be stripped and i trust them that this come in a reality that this these scriptures we are reading tonight is not like old kind words or old time scripture this is the god of the bible joshua chapter 24 dr chapter running chapter 10 rather deuteronomy chapter 10 reading from verse 12. we will do 11 13. not jump and jump in here but we will jump jump with me you can read chapter 10 verses 12 13. and now israel what does the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord i go with all thy heart and all thy soul to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command you this day for thy good for thy good so that is all god required to fear the lord walk in his ways to love him to serve him with all your heart not some all with all thy soul and keep the command joshua 22 5 says but take take diligent heed to do the commandments of the law which moses the servants of the lord charge you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to his keep his commandments and the cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and soul you'd have to find this one but i'll just read it through from judges chapter 6 9-10 judges chapter 6 9-10 and this is god speaking and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and you know i think brother isaac was preaching sometimes this is a bible study and talking about people's attitude after god blessed them and so on the attitude how it troubles god and when god started sending manna and so on they complain about the manner with the lord is like bread and it taste tastes like whatever it is and you know they have an attitude of things that didn't create of things that they didn't started and this is god saying here and and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians out of the hand of all that oppress you and drave them out from before you and give you dear land and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice now god had to remind this people one he delivered them he brought him out out oppression and you see when the attitude is why why are we here through this wilderness why are we going through what we are going through we as we are we may as well have stayed in egypt that is enough to make god furious because god went through all these years wait and tyrion to lose moses to get them out and when they get them out they get them come out they have attitudes you see so he said i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites and i could say this fear not the gods of anything out there if you are want to save the lord because he's going to protect you think about these things think about how much things you have been through and you're still alive you're still alive and kicking you're still you don't have a roof over your head you have some place to sleep you still have a me on your table we have a lot to praise god about amen now let's look the first samuel chapter seven one verse there verse three after the first samuel we want to hit first chronicles chapter 28. so you just run through subscriptions tonight i'm exhorting you for samuel 7 3 and samuel speak unto all the hosts of israel saying if ye do return unto the lord with all your hearts now you notice that they're talking about all your heart all your soul in other words i don't think god is of prayer i don't think god is of shallow i don't think god is this halfway attitude in christianity i think it has to come to uh like elijah say if god be god save him if bl is god serbia but let the golden answer by fire let's make god notice so far in all what we're talking about thus far in commitment we're not talking about church they're talking about the lord we're not talking about your boss you're not talking about your neighbor your husband your wife we're talking about the lord what if every husband serves the lord with all their hearts do as for the kingdom of god in their home and house what every wife is concerned about oh god sees an attitude and a behavior and a word what if the children want to please the lord you see how different the home going to be but it starts with this commitment i'm going to serve him i'm going to walk in his word i'm going to keep his word i'm going to walk in the light of his righteousness i'm going to get out of that commitment to the word right now we're just going through to god and samuel speak this verse three first samuel seven three samuel is speaking to all the hogs of israel saying if you do return unto the lord with all your hearts then then then put away the strange gods and asteroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the lord and serve him only and here we go and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines now we know the story when israel backside there's some philistine there's some king of babylon somebody taking them in captivity until they turn to the lord notice the process here if you return to the lord with all your hearts then you have something to do put away these strange gods that's what i'm saying people want to be comfortable enough to hear the word with the church here singing and specials and so on like that but they don't want to hear enough that would convict them to change and sometimes people stuck in the pain of their lives and the pain of what has happened to them or what they have done and it's not painful enough as to effect change because that is what god released all these trials and pressures to do not for you to be under pressure and under pain no for it to effect change i want you to think about that it's not god want to punish you god wanted to adjust your behavior first chronicles chapter 28 we want to read from eight and nine this is david speaking to his son just before that he says verse eight now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek this is uh first chronicles chapter 28 verse 8 to 9. now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek for all the commandments of the lord your god that he may possess this good land and leave it for inheritance for your children after you forever endow solomon my son who now this is david he's about to leave he's talking to his son and thou solomon my son no doubt the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind no no these words are and as but isaac will say when you're driving slow when you're slow down you see more things serve him with a perfect heart and a what a willing mind for the lord searched all hearts you could fool me but you careful him why for the lord sutured all hearts and understand it all imaginations of the thoughts if you seek him so he wasn't telling solomon you are entitled to be blessed the way i was blessed you're entitled to the throne you are my son and god you're highly favored and and i always say look you're too blessed to be stressed he's not telling david that netanyahu he said if thou seek him he will be fond of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off forever so this is real this is the god of the bible this is not playing games this is david talking to solomon his son david is anointed david is called david was king this is his son it's all about commissioned the temple david leave the drawings everything is dear everything is set but yet this would have portioned if thou seek him he will be fond of thee but if they'll forsake him he will cast the old forever jump into the new testament romans 6 17 i'll say it quickly but god be thanked all that he was servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you let me read it again but god be typed that you were servants of sin but you have what obeyed from that that means you could hear what you don't have to be you could be instructed but you do have to follow instructions that's why proverbs because solomon we're talking about here my instructions your son listen to my instructions hide seek after wisdom get knowledge get understanding why that you may know how to do how to act right so that is why the words are so perfect the bible is a perfect book thank god be thanked that he was servants of sin but he have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you oh my and we want to look at jeremiah chapter 42 say we this is scriptures tonight yeah it's a bible bible study jeremiah chapter 42 i want to read verse 46 hallelujah you love him tonight you've got some praises oh thank you lord thank you all for your word jeremiah 42 verse 4 then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatever thing the lord shall answer you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you then be said to jeremiah the lord be true and faithful witness between us if we do not even according to all things for which the lord thy god shall send me to us whether it be good whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee and it will be well with us when we obey the voice of the lord of our god give the lord a humble praise for the scripture give the lord a hundred priests wherever you are this is the people saying jeremiah they must say i hold nothing back for me okay whatever god say i'm going to tell you i'm going to let you know what god said and they say whether it be good people whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it will be well with us when we obey the voice of the lord oh god saints isn't that a beautiful thing isn't it an assurant thing to know in obeying god's voice the blessings is guaranteed isn't that a tremendous thing note we're not talking about church we're not talking about church we're talking about the lord thy god now remember what abram says they were the people of god and when they got called out they became the church of god and they were figurative and tight of us coming out you see to become god's church and remember holy church was built jesus said hold on he's upon this rock i will build my church so it's a church that jesus built and this church is built of course by revelation and revelations come by the word being revealed to you revelation come by the spirit of bringing the word strong to your heart so therefore god are to send preachers ministers pastors prophets whatever to deliver the word to you and by the medium of the word the spirit could pick it up and reveal to you his thoughts not time magazine not the trinidad guardian not some american or european magazine not thoughts from that you'll catch what i'm saying so so this revelation is not knowledge and information of humans or give the lord some praise this revelation is the mind of god i see people believing things on the internet as if it does say the lord all kind of liars crooks all kind of evil spirits they don't know what behind them people but they're sharing videos and sharing clips they're sharing what is in their heart is it negative they were running at the shade look at it they want the confusion they wanting to fall apart like people looking for the press to come down they want the person to come up with no power all kind of crazy crankpot crackpots it doesn't even make sense the bible said as much as is possible live peacefully with all men you are looking for fight you are looking to cause no confusion and erection and the government come down and tend to fight us and close us down we'll fight back and i'm quoting daniel's scripture we shall not bow down and go and it's not sorry for us these are fairies for this they're not even gonna lie doesn't look very you know fiery furnace big okay people trying to make the one fire yes we try to make their own furnace but i am saying to you if we as a people here tonight would appreciate and value the word of god the voice of god then we could cherish it we could say i am resting on it because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed on the mount of god that is why you hear me emphasize the spirit prophet and the bride will say the same thing i ain't know what facebook i know about social media i know about that and what they say will already be said in the word so my strength is not for information on facebook or social media or what the government doing in america or europe or wherever else my strength and confidence is industry it's in what come out the amount of god's profit so don't lust for knowledge don't lust for information desire revelation is not the same don't it's too much knowledge out there and sometimes it's it could it could cook your mind doesn't people go on cuckoo you know it's a lot of knowledge just hitting people back and forth a lot of knowledge and and because of social media and whatsapp and sharing and the person and what something like that information just flies overnight some people like to know uh the things i've viewed a million times two million times 10 million times and they've gone viral they've gone very well what gone viral a lag on that something negative going viral it's not god word going viral why god will come over here think about it now how come we are not here industrial on fire all over the world people speaking dust in the lord look a prophet said this the word said this the bible said no but all the things out there going viral friends forget viral study what god has said study that we are dealing with the god of this evil age is a god of destruction and commitment brings focus let me say it again commitment brings focus i believe in being committed commissioned in marriage committed to be finally committed to the lord committed to god's people all this is part of commitment now because you got committed on your mountain by yourself imagine to what by this shall all men know that you are my disciples you see that's the word now uh beloved let us love one another for love is of god and anyone who loves born of god and with god okay this is a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another but that's the word right now when you by yourself you should win and you wear body with no body and you hitting no body and whatnot that's not what the bible is saying this love carry loving yourself you're not self-loves this is love that has to go to the brethren so this is a commitment of the word to go to depression to love and to care and to be concerned and to be burdened and to treat them right because if you cannot treat your own brothers and sisters right how could you treat god right when the brothers and sisters who you see amen so i trust that this will help somebody tonight i i trust it will help you tonight jeremiah 42 verse 4. okay no sorry you want to look at chronicles uh second chronicles 16 verse nine for the eyes of the lord running to and fro throughout the whole earth second chronicles 16 verse nine the eyes of the lord run two and four throw the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him hearing though has done foolishly therefore from henceforth though shall have war so god has looked over his people god doesn't look in the heart of his people that have a heart towards him with a heart wasn't protected covering them all right let us look at first kings chapter two wanna read verse one before first king chapter two verse one the four first king chapter two was wonderful now the days of david junior that he shall die and he charged solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be those strong therefore and shoot myself a man and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways now you see why i'm reading this here you have to take this as if god telling you this like you are solomon and to keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses what for what for that dharmius prosper in all that thou doest and witness whoever doubting us thyself that the lord may continue his word which he speak considering me saying if thy children not a guarantee it's not like it's better if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart with all their soul they shall not feel thee a man on the throne of israel or give the lord a hand of praise tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah that is your commitment to god so let's kind of dig a bit uh about commitment to god's people and we want to go to acts chapter 2 verse 42 familiar scripture then we go to romans 12. so acts chapter 2 verse 42 and look what god requires us and what has happened in the old testament in the alpha church and see how we compare with it now acts chapter 2 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine one and fellowship to and in breaking of bread tree and praise it is it is defined in the scripture it continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine they had doctrine one they had fellowship two they had breaking of bread and they had praying this is what we have to see not people doctrine alone no fellowship you see they had doctrine they had fellowship they had breaking bread they had prayer romans 12 universe 4 and this is called unto the church now for us we have many members in one body talk about our physical body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ so know this scripture take you away from seeing just individuals and i see and he and no no no he's nobody body of christ now four first five so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another having them gifts different according to the grace that is given to us with a prophecy that is prophesying according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering or either teach it on teaching either exhort it on exhortation either give it let them do it with simplicity either rule it with diligence he that show it mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimilation abhor that which is evil please that that which is good be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor referring one another you know some people they they like to be complimented but they do with compliments they like to be appreciated but they don't show appreciation to others they are all about themselves what comes to them what they want what they want to have what they want to get but not what they want to give let's look at first corinthians this is new testament now verse 12. exciting about this scripture first corinthians chapter 12 i trust them that are you excited tonight about this word about being committed to god's people first corinthians 12 verse 12 for as the body is one and have many members and all members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we bond or free and have been all made a drink of that one spirit for the body is not one member but many and if the foot shall save because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall see because i'm not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body will an eye where would the hearing if the whole body were hearing where would they smell it now god had but god had set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him and if they were all one member where would the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot see under the hand i have no need of thee no again the head to the feet i have no need of thee nay more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary there's a big one those members of the body which seem seem as wordier to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant commonness for our commonly parts have no need but god had tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacked that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care glory hallelujah one for another could we give the lord a hand the praise for this scripture here that the members will have the same care it's not you came for your family and that church down there did you land on me no no no no no no no no you not even in christianity that is not christianity because anybody could care for the family anybody could see by their own house in their own world and their own life and their own family and what anybody that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have same care right where you are say same care same care one for another and here we go and when one member suffer all the members suffer with it when one member be honored all the members rejoice with it and if you can't rejoice with a member being honored you have problems with jealousy problems envy problems hard problems you have problems because this what i shared here is the word so see you have to know when you see somebody blessed glory hallelujah i should have got my brother thank you for my sister not oh god you raise your hand about thank god lord when i get in that you forget me so long await you can't go dear you have to respect the eye you lose and that is where you value people oh gosh you know you ever get your nail ever split your fingernail if i split that a little split you're not that hard just you know the edge of your nail there have a little small part here and listen that button like if somebody holding you up in like a gun you know it's rocking you a little something something sticking your finger and it's miserable but you're not looking for a knife to cut off your finger you want your finger to be right there you want this to change you want it to cure you want it to be healed there are too many people on the ceiling and part of the underserving undergiven under sharing under caring they're not they're just barely doing the minimum they won't volunteer they went off of themselves you ask them to do something they will do it you know yeah they will do it but the bottom said god is rewarded for the extra what you're not even asked to do he said what is your duty is not a reward because your duty he said when you go beyond your duty that is where the blessings are developed by the interests that is where they get the ice cream on the kick when you go beyond the duty it might be your duty and you know not if um i will scratch you back for you to scratch mines not that when you go beyond all of that and then you know the blessings is assured my lord can we call further here now so watch and the last one so when one member suffer all the members suffer with it verse 26 and when one number be honored all the members rejoice with it now ye are body of christ and members in particular and that is why it brings it easier now when you see somebody off track and you see somebody out of sync you could say but why that behavior quite that attitude and you provoke them okay until love and good works yeah some of them need to be provoked because their behavior is the fall back position of the human element the former position of the flesh they fall back position of the khana life remember we were born and said shape iniquity and we still in this body so so in other words once you break out of the spirit realm your default position could be back to the flesh but the canality back to natural but the bible forces us to adjust our thinking and have the attitude of god towards you by the word of god that's why he said love one another when jesus i went to do defeat washing and je and peter said no don't watch me don't watch me just say you're not part with me and my life jesus and i like what jesus told he has been very straightforward he had beaten around the bush if he said no no no he said you have no part of me he said then then he wonder about now he wants you want full worship jesus tell them i do this and i'm your lord and master i do this as an example not to show just to show you but i want you to do this to one another i want you to show humility i want you to show being a seasoned i wanted to show how you could humble to each other by washing one another's feet this feet washing have more powerful things to it and it might appear now when you it's like oh the defeat is one of the worst part center that is where they they kicking us at that that's the sun reservation or to dust and you market place something and you're going on to wash you know that was the lowest job on our feet watching flanking so jesus said oh there will be funky foreign treat each other with grace with humility because we are all called by god's grace my lord delivered daniel amen all right john 13 34 and 35 is the scripture remember are familiar with john 13 a new commandment is jesus is in red and you command i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that you love one another now remember i said in the beginning before i started the scriptures that it's not something you're born with commitment you're not born with that something you learn something you can acquire being dedicated to being committed um we as in ministry we have to be a certain way in our hearts in order to get the job done whether we feel sick or we don't feel sick um we strive to get it delivered because we see ourselves as as servants for your sake so if i go by my feelings then a lot of things might be done or accomplished but because we feel that this is something that would edify benefit strengthen and help you your commitment to marriage your commitment on the job you know some people on the job they they ratchet all they want is the paid the minimum they could do for that pay they do it nothing extra they don't stand out they are not highlighted the boys care principle wow this was excellent that person needed a razor peak nothing like that they are content to be mediocre they are content to do because they finally bought this and finally bosses and they remind me the scripture of the talents and the man gave 150 and 100 and he went away from five countries and he gave one one good thing you have these real men to know who to give one the one with a hundred produce a hundred you 150 make fifty more and he won't come and save her one he he bury it he's because no you're a hard man you know what i mean i know i know it's pressure but i know you're not easy so i bury it what you give me look it back he said you gotta put me back you guys i'm wicked seven and then jesus made a powerful statement that type the little that they have will be taken from them so when you see people in certain conditions and wonder how they dear you gotta watch that channel because sometimes is a level of lack of a commitment lack of ambition lack of passion lack of let me say lack of laziness sometimes it is lazy to pray lazy too fast easy to worship lazy they really want a priest so some of these people in love with the priesthood because the priesthood saves them from doing what they're supposed to do as long as that is my father up there or my bishop or the man of the man of god out of the hour and they were worshiping and the fellowship of the man and the off they're safe they could do whatever they want to do they don't want any money because god doesn't see it so not in this age remember the nicolaitan the true out and take the anointing off the people of the lady put it on a man and we fell the whole thing collapsed this christian church that start via pentecost collapsed because number six got a troll and when you see man sit down and throw you know they don't want to leave it you see them all over the world they want to leave you know they want four more years five more years ten more years they want to live there forever as man without character on controls so god put it now that his power would only be released to those people that have character and character thank you jesus is not a gift so god so god can't feed anybody to the back door all right come on come on come okay come quick yeah you know i like you i love you no no it doesn't work every son that committed god must be tested tried so when you see somebody come true in character in life in spirit and purpose note this that they have come true they have been thoroughly tested and approved oh glory to god so when god dropped down and said this is my beloved son if i'm pleased you know that man went through stuff that bring him to the place where he got god's approval so ultimately friends your commitment on your job your commitment in your home your commitment in the church your commitment to the word your commitment to god the word to prayer to god's people has nothing to do with anybody else let me see it again your commitment to god to word his people to pray to christ has nothing to do with anybody else not your wife but your father but your mother but your husband it is your commitment i remember when i got my certificate to marry mary i said i'm hungry i marry you because i love you and i accept you as you are i didn't even know how powerful those words were accept the commitment the word spoken i didn't know her we didn't 10 years courting or anything like that was just a few months we got engaged we got married samia but i was saying to her i love you i am committed to you i don't know you but i accept you as you are all your faults weakness fears whatever it is i accept it i accept responsibility for it and i could see god having his commitment to his people that's why you see if my people that's called by my name shall i will heal their land i would lower the pestilence i will do this i will do that we we can't get in trouble unless god allows it oh give the lord some praises because roman 8 is a guarantee roman is like a contract and we know all things work together for good to them that love god they don't really call you you can't break god over that he pulled us to make it work for our good we can't save ourselves wrong sinners like us we can't redeem ourselves we were in the pit we was in the mud somebody had on us somebody more powerfulness had to pull us up i know he is encouraging us not just to be out but to help another brother help another sister testify to some sinner witnesses somebody out here because somebody written for word which is oh my lord father god thank you jesus okay so jesus said a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another and by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one for another first peter 1 22 i cannot run you now so i wouldn't pull back first peter 1 22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfain love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently so now he's not talking about love he's not about equality i love love one another fervently i talk about no um oh wow i talk about unseek love but you genuinely want to demonstrate you want to support you want to give you want to share you want to help you want to bless you want to encourage you want to inspire at the funeral of sister christine and it was amazing and this is the family knew it also says a christian came give a heart to the lord god baptized and she graduated from just a believer normal coming out to somebody that encourages others in other words she went past herself she went past her condition she went past her diabetes she went past all her to encourage others and what i'm seeing in life is living for others forgive the lord a hand of praise i love it tonight this is a word what what what what eternal life is living for others do you live for others have you experienced going beyond your family circle or not just your family circle the present circle that you are in because you are limited by the sick that you are in if all you are hearing is on that same circle all along that's all you're gonna get that's all you're gonna hear you're limited by that but if you prepare to go beyond that and be a son and daughter disconnected from the affairs of men and the fears of the world and number six and humanistic realm god could bless you tremendously and take care of places all right let me see if it gets from here all right romans 12 10 it says here be i think i read this before be kindly affection one to another with bloody love in honor referring one another but in the amplified it says here love one another with broadly affection as members of one family given precedence and showing honor to one another oh man you want to honor your brother you want to honor your sister galatians 5 this is what you should find galatians 5 13-16 right this is a this is important one relations five galatians 5 15 to 16. i want you to find this one for brethren we want to take it slow you have been called unto liberty one two only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but to love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself verse 15 if he bite and devour one another take heed that he be not consumed one of another this i say then walk in the spirit and he shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh now let's take that in the amplified galatians five same same scripture let's read the number five for you brethren were indeed called to freedom only do not let your freedom be an incentive to your flesh and an opportunity or excuse for selfishness i just love oh this is pleased because in a regular one it says you have been called to liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by loves of one another but the amplified says for you brethren are indeed called to freedom only do not let your freedom be an incentive to your flesh and an opportunity or excuse for selfishness but through love you should serve one another who's 14 amplified for the whole law concerning human relationships is complied with in the one precept you shall love your neighbor as you do yourself but if you bite and evolve one another in partition strife be careful that you and your whole fellowship are not consumed by one another but i say walk and live habitually in the holy spirit responsive to and controlled and guided by the spirit then you will certainly not gratify the cravings and desires of the flesh of human nature without god okay amen second thessalonians one verse three and four second thessalonians verse three and four i see this army right here next to me here speaking the bible and getting these scriptures that is such and such an exciting thing hallelujah trust i will even find your scriptures blessed be the name of the lord so second thessalonians 1 verse 3 and 4 says we are bound to thank god always for you rhetoric as this is meat because that your faith grew at exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all to watch each other abundant abundant so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your prosecutions and tribulations that you endure at the second telus thessalonians one three and four and this is at the amplified we ought and indeed are obligated as those in debt to give thanks always to god for you brethren and this is fitting because your fate is growing exceedingly and the love of every one of you each towards the other is increasing and upon and this is a accords for mentioning you with pride among the churches of god for your steadfastness your confliction endurance and patience and your firm feet in the midst of all the persecution and crushing the stresses and afflictions under which you order my first john 4 7 beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that love it is born of god unknown god and i'm going to share something with you from the prophet he's saying we have a sacred trust you know what our trust is we have an inheritance i believe in children it's the sacred trust and that sacred trust and our sacred heritage is the word of god so this is the commitment to the word and here we say now that's the reason i am so dogmatic as i would call it on standing on the word no matter what anything else say if it is not with the word then i don't believe it see you want to believe it all right but to me it takes the word because heaven will pass away but my word shall never fear therefore it takes the word i live by the word okay so he said the deepness of it it's all privilege it's the sacred trust that god has put to his church and god give the word to his church and that sacred heritage is ours it's a gift from god not to compromise on this or cut this out or two days out add this in or suit our taste but to preach the full word the whole gospel we are dutiful as christians that take it and believe it now this sacred trust that god has put to his church god gave his word to his church and that sacred heritage is ours it's a gift from god not to just compromise this or that he said now watch when we know we are bypassing something that some great heritage that belongs to us when we bypass it because our church said they don't believe it for this day it isn't for our day if we bypass that then we spoil our heritage so nobody branham is separated what it should say and what he would say if the word say and the church is saying forget what it should say you gotta take the word see now he said god help me god help you as christians never to compromise one word of god's word for this sacred trust was handed to the church and it's a glorious thing to have this gospel the full gospel to preach it without compromising any way preach it just as this is written live it just as it is written that's a sacred trust and if we ever expect this word to come to pass if we ever expect god to keep his word you've got to stay with it just the way god wrote it and that's the reason if you stay with it the way god wrote it there will be all kind of things happening among you every word will be fulfilled a woman is entrusted with certain characters she must not disagree fire a woman is trusted to that there's not a creature in it like a woman there's no female dog there's no female of any kind entrusted with the character that a woman has yes a woman wasn't even the beginning of creation because god knew that she got four all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that can commit adultery if she had been made at the original that would have been this complementary to god's great wisdom she was made a byproduct of a man and because she was cast over in that side she has also been given a secret charge from god for redemption she has got character she must not define a body is given to her a sacred trust from god no female dog no bird no other animal not a creature like that she is the only one and the reason it is so sacred she is to bring forth life into the earth a body is a bedding rung of life therefore that's the reason she's given that sacred trust now we find that our body is the bedding ground all right and i'm speaking now bringing this illustration to show you where the church stands i'm not speaking of you woman whatever you are that's between you and god and you men i'm speaking of the church and christ now this she has been given to bring forth life and only god himself can give her husband might be the gym bearer but god has to produce the life that's right now she has a sacred trust of virtue that's been given to her trusted to her by the lord god gave her the virtue just as it was in the garden of eden she can say yes or no she has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to her that she must not be the womanhood i'm speaking out here is her conduct a character around men notice that's committed to her secret virtue secret womanhood sacred motherhood on her husband now we find out she has been given this sacred trust that she must not break of womanhood and act her character raise their children the honorable husband and here what what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman you see why she's a type of the church he says she has a sacred which has the same responsibility as a woman as a sacred responsibility a motherhood to her virtues and her husband the church has here we go a sacred responsibility to prayer and the word and to the word and the christ just as the same as the woman so saints church you have that responsibility to pray unto the word and the christ you have to make that come that commitment that commitment you have to want to improve as a father as a husband as a wife as a mother you have to want to improve as a worker this this is nobody could do it for you you have to want that and brahma talk about what there's shows that there's got to come a spirit that that's on john he introduced messiah what and how will the messiah the people that believe in him know it unless they are constantly in the word to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise they wouldn't know they shall know their god but now he shall appear in the last days and to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband noah made the reveal word so your husband is not me your husband is the revealed word oh my blessed be the name of the lord so whatever i'm gonna wrap up here now let me out okay so but talk about offer offer she was a type of a lucom church that once started and she kissed a mother-in-law returned back and that's the type of lukewarm believer who will believe jesus to be christ and then turn around and go back to the thing to come out of my she returned back to our gods and many times we returned back to gods of our beginning because eyes of lust after the wrong thing we turn back to lusting again we got idols of drinking idols of smoking idols of lion hours of stealing idols and then professor and be baptized the lukewarm church and luke unbelievers each believer represents the church every watch power the lukewarm church here we go wow the lukewarm believer as each believer represents the church every american represents america every german represent germany and every christian represent christ and here she turned her back go back to the same thing and she come out of how that men even preachers sometimes will take the way of the lord and when you speak to them about the baptism the holy spirit is in nonsense that's offer tell them what the name of jesus christ and so on like that all right let's finish off here well how i like likely to root she had to make a decision i had to make a decision you have got to make a decision you will never walk on these doors this morning without some kind of decision you'll never leave this room today either being a you either leave this room today you're a better man or more or worse my woman to reject it you'll be worse it's harder the next time for you to get to it or you'll go all better it comes to our children in our lives it comes to a short on everybody's life and root had to make a decision so the bible said that a mother-in-law told her go back to your gods like your sister go back at the lukewarm why don't you go on the gospel preacher if you want to go go on a real truthful preacher that will put before the class of people you make your decision you stand on your feet lukewarm wishy-washy you don't know but a real servant of god be laid on your lap make your decision root said i will go where you go your people my people you're going to be my god where you live i live where you died will you very happy bury that is a real decision and i'm going to close with these scriptures from christ our commitment to him matthew 10 37 he that love it father mother this is jesus speaking more than me is not worthy of me no this is the brass that he's not pastor t teaching he's not prophet or apostle this is jesus he that loved father mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loved his son or daughter more than me is that worthy of me i need to take it not his cross and follow it after me is not worthy of me so he is putting on you to follow after he's putting on us to be committed to him he's not saying i fallen after you and you have to follow me be worthy of me matthew 16 24 then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me luke 14 26 and 27 if any man come to me and hate not his father mother wife and children and prison and sisters yea his own life force who cannot be my disciple and who is whosoever doubt not bears cross and come after me cannot be my disciples bear his cross and come after john 12. that loved his life he was 25 and 26 shall lose it that hated his life in this world shall keep it under life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me that way i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor just what two more scriptures are really close what is the last scripture in john 66 63-68 jesus speaking it is the spirit that quickness the flesh prophet said nothing the words that i speak unto you their spirit in their life jesus and discernment here but there are some of you that believe not jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who would betray him he said therefore i said unto you that no man can come unto me except it will give him unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said jesus unto the twelve would you go also were we then simon peters answered him lord to whom shall we go thou alone as the words of eternal life final scriptures in john 8 31 says then said jesus to those jews who believe in him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed so jesus said if you continue not start not stay stagnant but continue because the word is always unfolding remember the seed you have in your hand if your plant is in the ground start to grow when you start to grow you don't see a seed you see a stalk it grows through possesses until they come back to seed again but god planned the season the early church the alpha church that went through processes the processes is what we call the church ages and you and i are here tonight we represent back to seed back to the harvest back to the dream will you be committed tonight will you repent of your lack of commitment would you be pen tonight of the mediocrity would you repent the night of your half-heartedness or just barely be indeed because let's face it the foolish virgins they are the people that just get by they were lazy sanctified they believe they fall in christ in church but they're not burdened about the extra oil they were not committed to be stocked up for the journey with this oil with this word because it's worth in the spirit let us borrow his tonight thank you jesus heavenly father i thank you tonight and um for this one word commitment god uh you want us to be committed the first thing i said was we can't defeat a full-time devil being a part-time christian there's some way and you know there are people the testimony they work more than they deserve more than being paid for and eventually things turn around that they get paid for more than one it's amazing and those people skimping on the job they just remain at a certain level father help us lord because your word taught us that they who strive for the mastery will be temperature in all things and we strive after that price you don't run just to run we want to win we run after something father tonight you call us to be committed soldiers committed people lord when job had his stripping he said the lord give the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord he was committed to worship he was committed to surrender by the time he finished with job he was a better man god make us better men tonight better women more better sons better daughters we want to be better we want to do better we want to live better we want to see better we want to be genuine authentic original father bless bless your son as well as tonight blessed brother isaac in the special way tonight and he was the one that was stuck in the burden of his bible study quite some time now and we see the fruit of it we see the interest in it and i just love it father because what the prophet come to reveal was the scripture itself it's the word that we have to connect back with this word and we have to reveal wood that slides straight into the world are we thank you for these people here tonight anyone sick may you heal them anyone backs in me restore it anyone need a touch and revive them you refight it god may they not leave you the same way they came but may they be blessed and jesus amen amen god bless you thanks again for being here we love you and we certainly appreciate we're looking forward to the next session and we have uh tape one for tomorrow night and i trust will be a tremendous blessing to you and we look forward for uh permitting on friday try so god bless you have a good night
