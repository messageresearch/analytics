[29:40] good morning to everyone greetings to
[29:42] pastor solomon joseph nachina hope i got
[29:45] it right and to the saints at life
[29:47] tamanna tamale ghana
[29:50] as you celebrate with the bride of
[29:52] christ around the world in a virtual
[29:54] setting i am honored to bring you
[29:56] greeting
[29:57] at such a time like this when the world
[30:00] has been brought to a false halt
[30:02] with adjustments being made that are
[30:04] deeply affecting one and all including
[30:06] the little bride of christ before i
[30:08] continue let me read a scripture exodus
[30:10] 12 12
[30:12] for i will pass through the land of
[30:13] egypt this night and i will smite all
[30:15] the firstborn in the land of egypt both
[30:17] man and beast
[30:18] against all the gods of egypt i will
[30:20] execute judgment for i am the lord and
[30:23] the blood shall be to you for a token
[30:24] upon the house where you are and when i
[30:26] see the blood i will pass over you and
[30:28] the plague shall not be upon you to
[30:30] destroy you when i smite the land of
[30:32] egypt notes carefully
[30:34] that he says he was going to smite the
[30:36] land but this mightin was with a plague
[30:39] as we have displayed going on now
[30:41] now we must remember and i'm sending
[30:43] this message especially to those of us
[30:46] who have been in the message for some
[30:47] time
[30:48] and are yet to identify with the token
[30:51] let me just send this little
[30:54] friendly warning to you we must remember
[30:56] that no matter what we do or how
[30:58] successful we are in life without christ
[31:01] without christ we are totally lost
[31:04] everything
[31:06] why if he is that if he is all that
[31:09] there is to look forward to then it will
[31:11] be most foolish not to accept it like
[31:13] the foolish virgins
[31:15] and cherish it not only to accept it but
[31:17] you you come to something greater than
[31:19] that after you've got it don't take it
[31:21] on late on the shelf it has to be put
[31:24] into use
[31:27] now obviously we are talking about the
[31:29] blood of the lamb is a token for you
[31:32] and when i see the blood i will pass
[31:35] over you
[31:36] it's the same as being ready
[31:38] as the wise virgin who had oil in the
[31:41] lamb
[31:42] christianity is about displaying the
[31:44] token publicly
[31:46] in public life at the office on the
[31:48] street when trouble is around
[31:51] anything at the church for the blood is
[31:53] the token and the token must be applied
[31:57] if it's ever going to be done it has to
[31:58] be done now because we can see that the
[32:01] rat
[32:02] is not a boat but the rat is already
[32:05] on display
[32:06] throughout the land throughout the world
[32:08] everything that is not under the token
[32:10] will perish
[32:11] and the blood identifies us
[32:15] remember
[32:16] the rat is on the ready over the world
[32:19] you know in the early days and the
[32:20] message we would have said well you have
[32:22] to kill the lamb and then put it on the
[32:25] doorpost well it seems to me the time is
[32:27] not killing the lamb but the time is to
[32:28] display
[32:29] the token there's a time for killing and
[32:32] there's a time for this plane once the
[32:34] deaths start to pass through there's a
[32:36] time for this plane seems to me it's not
[32:38] a time for killing
[32:40] now
[32:41] we are living in the shadows and the rat
[32:43] is striking and god has required a token
[32:46] that you yourself have received this
[32:48] token which is the holy ghost is the
[32:50] only way and the only sign that god will
[32:53] ever pass
[32:54] why it is the literal life of jesus
[32:56] christ returned back
[32:59] upon
[33:00] the believer
[33:01] it is the literal life of jesus christ
[33:04] else how else are we going to in his
[33:06] name cast those devils and see signs and
[33:09] wonders it's not going to be done unless
[33:11] the token is on on display
[33:13] the holy ghost is our identification
[33:15] it's what identifies us as christians
[33:18] not our membership in churches not our
[33:20] standing of the bible and mysteries or
[33:22] how much you know about the bible it's
[33:24] about how much you know about the altar
[33:26] how much the author is living in us
[33:28] it's your old self gone dead you are no
[33:31] more you wrecking yourself dead not just
[33:33] a reckon you are dead if you touch a
[33:35] dead man he doesn't move but my god
[33:38] these days you don't have to touch you
[33:39] just have to look
[33:41] and you get this tears back and you get
[33:43] the words back and you know they're not
[33:45] dead angers are bringing have brought us
[33:47] into places that we have never been
[33:49] before
[33:50] offense has become the normal sea
[33:53] he that is born of god does not commit
[33:55] sin for he cannot sin for the seed of
[33:57] god remains in him how can he sin when
[34:00] the sinless god is in him when he's a
[34:02] sinner's god how can he sin no matter
[34:04] what he's done the blood has covered him
[34:06] so does a man or woman who is full of
[34:08] the holy ghost he is sealed away secured
[34:10] from harm and danger his whole life
[34:12] displays what he is wherever he walks
[34:15] whatever business he does whoever he
[34:17] talks to when he comes in contact with
[34:19] woman when he comes in contact with the
[34:21] associates when he comes in contact with
[34:23] everything the token is lying there
[34:26] praise god let the token be seen not all
[34:29] not our personality not to curse the
[34:32] risks not our anger not to see how long
[34:34] we could stay vexed
[34:36] without that quote took that covenant
[34:38] the rat of god is upon us
[34:40] it's caught up with you your sins will
[34:42] find you out what is sin unbelief you
[34:45] have disbelieved the message you have
[34:47] disbelieved the word you have
[34:48] disbelieved the witness of the token
[34:50] itself when it's identified itself in
[34:52] the midst of us all these years my
[34:54] brother they always here when the token
[34:56] itself is identifying himself right
[34:59] among us proving he's the same yesterday
[35:01] today and forever
[35:04] because if you say you believe and you
[35:06] don't follow the instructions of the
[35:08] word then you do not believe it's as
[35:10] simple as that this you don't have to be
[35:11] a rocket scientist to understand this
[35:13] message you know you just have to be
[35:15] obedient and have your hearts change and
[35:17] your ears in tune i always pray really
[35:20] circumcise my heart and circumcise my
[35:22] ass so i can hear what god is saying
[35:25] because if we're using the ears and the
[35:26] heart of the old nature
[35:28] you're dead into the things of god
[35:31] though you be circumcised do you join
[35:33] until you are baptized you've done all
[35:35] these things that's still in the token
[35:37] so when you're circumcised then you are
[35:39] putting yourself in a place for the
[35:41] token to be on display you're putting
[35:43] yourself in a place for god to begin
[35:45] walking on us
[35:47] because it's a process justification
[35:50] sanctification but we've got to finish
[35:53] the baptism of the holy ghost now
[35:56] you cannot imagine it but you got to
[35:58] stay there until you know the token is
[35:59] implied
[36:01] until your whole mind the mind that was
[36:03] in christ
[36:04] is in you
[36:05] and when that is done then you know your
[36:07] life is done you are dead your life is
[36:09] dead you are hidden christ you are
[36:11] hidden god and sealed in there by the
[36:13] holy ghost then
[36:15] when the cry comes behold the bridegroom
[36:16] comment go yell to meet him you will be
[36:19] one of them
[36:20] for wise virgin and not the foolish may
[36:23] god bless you i greet you in jesus name
[36:25] amen
[36:27] dear brothers and sisters
[36:29] it is again my pleasure to have been
[36:32] invited for a short greeting my brother
[36:35] solomon
[36:37] it is precious to have fellowship in the
[36:39] revealed world of this hour and to dig
[36:42] together and enjoy the glorious
[36:44] blessings of our savior
[36:47] the topic for this conference is a very
[36:51] serious one
[36:52] and it brings us to the point of
[36:54] questioning ourselves and finding out if
[36:58] we are walking in a straight line in the
[37:01] right direction
[37:03] we have understood that there are two
[37:05] groups two kinds of virgins the wise
[37:09] virgins and the foolish virgins and that
[37:11] ultimately only one group emerged as
[37:14] overcomers
[37:16] so the bible calls us to be wise
[37:20] this cannot be our human limited wisdom
[37:25] it can only be the wisdom of god which
[37:28] we can ask from him
[37:32] if you look very closely
[37:34] we see that both the wise virgins and
[37:38] the foolish virgins had a lamp
[37:41] both lamps shown in the beginning
[37:44] both went through the process
[37:47] of
[37:48] justification sanctification and baptism
[37:52] of the holy spirit so that their lamb
[37:54] was lit
[37:57] they were both virgins pure and holy
[38:01] but at the end of time we are promised
[38:03] that there will be a difference between
[38:06] wise and foolish
[38:08] but
[38:09] we also have the promise
[38:11] that the holy spirit will guide us into
[38:14] all truth
[38:15] this holy spirit guides us to the one
[38:20] who is the truth our head jesus christ
[38:23] this great person
[38:26] this little addition
[38:28] wise to oil in their vessels is the
[38:31] crucial difference
[38:34] there is a
[38:35] great multitude of believers who testify
[38:38] that they are born again and had
[38:40] received the holy spirit and that they
[38:44] have experienced signs and wonders in
[38:46] their lives
[38:48] they are
[38:49] also
[38:51] not married to a system
[38:54] they are virgins
[38:56] and this group of believers
[38:58] are sure that they are christians sons
[39:01] and daughters of god
[39:03] therefore
[39:04] at the end of time they will say lord
[39:07] lord
[39:08] did we not do all these things in your
[39:11] name
[39:13] and these
[39:14] great things
[39:15] such as healing the sick
[39:18] deliverance
[39:20] raising the dead
[39:22] and so on comes from god
[39:26] but they elect oil
[39:28] in their vessels
[39:30] we see from this very clearly that today
[39:34] it is no longer a matter of the
[39:36] foundation of justification
[39:39] sanctification and baptism of the holy
[39:42] spirit alone
[39:43] which every christian
[39:45] if he calls himself by his name must
[39:48] have experienced
[39:50] what we need now in addition
[39:54] is to experience what jean experienced
[39:58] on the isle of patmos
[40:02] take the little book and eat it up
[40:06] that which makes
[40:07] our light shine today
[40:10] is a revelation of who he is
[40:14] who i am as a son or daughter who my
[40:18] brother sister is next to me
[40:21] and a revelation of the promises for
[40:24] this day and hour so that we can come
[40:27] forth as overcomers in the rapture
[40:32] but we also see very clearly
[40:34] that even those who love and heard the
[40:37] message of this hour need grace
[40:40] that the fire of love and joy does not
[40:43] go out
[40:45] yes
[40:46] there is something more that we need in
[40:49] our vessels
[40:52] as it is written in the third seal
[41:01] here he comes in as the antichrist
[41:05] as a false prophet than the beast then
[41:08] in dark age
[41:10] then the church ages
[41:12] out of the dark age
[41:14] justification sanctification baptism of
[41:18] the holy ghost
[41:19] incarnate word the way now
[41:23] and he goes down he goes down the church
[41:26] goes up
[41:27] it's just as perfect as it can be oh
[41:30] it's beautiful i just love it
[41:36] two things have become very important to
[41:40] me in this regard
[41:42] the first thing that we certainly all
[41:45] need to clean our lamps is
[41:51] now it's my time for consecration to god
[41:55] god's time to speak to me see i must
[41:58] just have a little change in my own life
[42:02] not as i think that i am wicked
[42:04] but i want to feel a little more closer
[42:08] to people see
[42:11] let us
[42:12] take a closer look at this saying of the
[42:15] prophet
[42:16] he said in the message
[42:18] humble thyself
[42:29] as i
[42:30] brought this statement this morning
[42:34] the people was laying in the shadow of
[42:37] peter
[42:38] they never even asked for prayer
[42:43] we know
[42:44] this is the climax in the third pool
[42:49] i've went into many homes watching this
[42:52] pray before i go just go in there with
[42:56] the anointing
[42:57] and don't even pray for the people
[43:00] walk out and they are healed see see
[43:04] that's right i've seen it done so many
[43:08] times
[43:09] see
[43:10] you have got to have
[43:12] somewhere to place your faith see
[43:16] you have got to believe it and i believe
[43:19] that the hour is approaching and now is
[43:26] is on the way and something is already
[43:29] given
[43:31] and we know he is the same yesterday
[43:33] today and forever
[43:35] and when i can really see and grasp what
[43:38] is given to us
[43:40] then we can place our faith in it
[43:44] and we know there is nothing outside the
[43:47] world our rock of salvation
[43:50] that we can lay our faith in it
[43:56] and i realized that this is not a tape
[43:58] service they might make a little one for
[44:01] themselves but this is not a tape that
[44:04] goes out across the
[44:07] blessed be the name of the lord today
[44:10] these words are in our hands
[44:15] this what i was speaking of this morning
[44:18] has brought us right up to a climax and
[44:22] that's the reason
[44:24] that i'm going
[44:26] to take next sunday for a healing
[44:28] service
[44:30] because since i've been home i've told
[44:33] you about the visions and what's
[44:36] happened and everything and brought it
[44:38] right up
[44:40] why i've done all these things
[44:43] and then this morning bringing it right
[44:46] up now to that last pull
[44:51] and while we live in the time of that
[44:54] last pull
[44:55] because the seals are broken and the
[44:57] word is revealed to us we need something
[45:00] more so that the glory of the lord can
[45:02] shine through us in this end time we
[45:05] need something more
[45:07] as what the foolish virgin said
[45:12] now
[45:14] it's my time
[45:15] for consecration to god
[45:20] god's time to speak to me
[45:23] see
[45:24] i must just have a little change in my
[45:28] own life
[45:29] not as i think that i am wicked
[45:32] but i want to feel a little more closer
[45:36] to people see
[45:40] that is what the wise virgin have
[45:44] a vessel filled with oil
[45:47] this oil
[45:48] that only the wise virgin can receive
[45:51] as it is written heard not the oil and
[45:54] the wine in revelation 6 4 6.
[46:01] brothers and sisters
[46:03] why is this deep longing
[46:06] in us
[46:07] to walk closer with him
[46:12] there is a marvelous promise given to us
[46:15] and this is the second fact i like to
[46:18] express to you and i want to close with
[46:20] this deep quote
[46:23] it is written
[46:24] in
[46:25] modern events may clear by prophecy
[46:31] notice now
[46:33] they had done
[46:36] to him just exactly
[46:38] what the prophet said they would do just
[46:42] as they are doing to this
[46:45] very same day in the laodicean age
[46:49] if you want to look at it read
[46:51] revelation 3
[46:53] blind
[46:54] naked
[46:55] and don't know it
[46:57] turning christ
[47:00] when he begins to reveal himself into
[47:04] the seed form again
[47:07] the same one that went into the ground
[47:10] come back to be the bride
[47:13] just the bride and the groom is the same
[47:16] flesh and blood
[47:18] the same ministry the same things doing
[47:22] just exactly what he done the spirit
[47:25] and here they are impersonating
[47:29] and doing everything else and each
[47:32] one has got his book and
[47:36] running and this and oh you never heard
[47:39] such sensations
[47:41] and i smell a devil and all this that
[47:45] just as unscriptural as it can be
[47:49] and the gene thing laying right there
[47:52] before them they walk away
[47:55] they don't belong to my organization i
[47:58] see just blind leading the blind
[48:02] won't they all fall in the ditch
[48:06] blinded by men's denominational
[48:09] traditions they put him out of that
[48:12] church as god said they would do in
[48:14] revelation 3
[48:16] as usual as prophesied
[48:20] notice how jesus made himself known to
[48:23] these disciples
[48:25] now and and we'll close
[48:28] these two disciples
[48:30] cafes
[48:31] cleopas
[48:33] rather and his friend
[48:36] now we are in the resurrection the
[48:38] morning after the resurrection the first
[48:41] resurrection
[48:42] what a beautiful morning jesus is up
[48:45] from the dead and living among his
[48:47] people
[48:48] what a beautiful thought
[48:51] he is here the same today as he was on
[48:54] that day because he's the same yesterday
[48:57] today and forever
[48:59] and revealing himself
[49:02] more today
[49:04] than he has in any other age since that
[49:08] day
[49:09] come through the weed and stalk and
[49:12] shuck
[49:14] is all past now
[49:17] we are into the wheat again
[49:19] see
[49:20] we are back into the grain
[49:25] back
[49:26] into the seed
[49:28] from
[49:29] into the seed form
[49:32] again
[49:34] that brings the
[49:36] life germ
[49:37] the powerful life back
[49:40] in the seed
[49:42] every seed will bring forth after his
[49:45] kind
[49:46] and we know
[49:48] he is risen hallelujah god bless you all

[56:22] just maybe to start the greeting
[56:25] to the virtual convention
[56:27] a special greeting to brother solomon
[56:29] nachina is from life tabernacle to mali
[56:33] in ghana
[56:35] as the host pastor of the virtual
[56:36] convention on behalf of the pastor
[56:39] so i'm not standing here in my own
[56:40] capacity but i'm standing on behalf of
[56:43] pastor raymond thompson
[56:45] of etmb johannesburg south africa
[56:49] so
[56:49] i'm here just to stand in the gap on
[56:51] behalf of our pastor and to greet the
[56:53] convention
[56:55] at the same time also to appreciate the
[56:57] ministers that will be preaching this
[56:58] virtual convention
[57:00] we want to thank god for them and the
[57:02] different ministries
[57:04] and how their ministries has blessed the
[57:06] pride of christ around the world
[57:09] let's just give lord and praise for that
[57:12] for these powerful ministers that we're
[57:14] going to be hearing at this virtual
[57:15] convention
[57:15] [Music]
[57:17] and a tremendous blessing i mean even
[57:19] looking at the the inspiration for the
[57:21] convention that brother solomon had
[57:23] behold the bridegroom cometh it's lamb
[57:25] trimming time
[57:28] and if you go back 20 30 40 plus years
[57:32] all of these ministers had preached on
[57:34] this inspiration before
[57:35] so even what you're going to hear this
[57:37] morning is nothing new
[57:39] these ministers had preached on this
[57:40] before
[57:41] and why because they've preached from
[57:43] the vindicated word
[57:45] of a prophet that the prophet had
[57:47] brought himself
[57:49] at the same time also just to appreciate
[57:51] headstone tabernacle we know that they
[57:53] provide the platform
[57:55] to stream these conventions let's just
[57:57] give the lord and a praise for for
[57:59] headstone
[58:00] what a tremendous blessing they've been
[58:02] around the world
[58:04] and to the bride of christ
[58:05] for providing the platform also
[58:09] again like i said uh
[58:11] i'm just here standing in the gap
[58:13] for our pastor
[58:15] this is the second time around and i
[58:17] believe that
[58:19] you'll preach with me
[58:21] and i believe that the message is going
[58:22] to be a blessing
[58:23] [Music]
[58:25] so let's go into the word you may be
[58:27] just please stand so we can do the
[58:29] scripture reading and then
[58:31] we'll go into the word
[58:36] so this morning i've got three portions
[58:38] of scripture
[58:40] the first one is uh found in first
[58:42] thessalonians
[58:43] from uh chapter four and then we'll read
[58:46] from 16 to 18
[58:48] and at the same time if you want to just
[58:50] hold on to first thessalonians 5
[58:53] we'll read from verses 1 to 6
[58:57] and then the third one will be from
[58:59] revelations 19 verse 7 to 10.
[59:18] if you find it we'll start with first
[59:19] thessalonians 4 16
[59:24] it reads as follows
[59:26] for the lord himself shall descend from
[59:29] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[59:31] the archangel with the trump of god
[59:34] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[59:36] then we which are alive and remain shall
[59:39] be caught up together
[59:41] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[59:43] in the air
[59:44] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[59:48] wherefore comfort one another with these
[59:51] words
[59:53] we'll go to first thessalonians 5 it's
[59:55] just the next chapter
[59:57] reading from verse 1
[59:59] but of the times and the seasons
[1:00:01] brethren
[1:00:02] you have no need that i write unto you
[1:00:05] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:00:07] day of the lord so cometh as a thief in
[1:00:09] the night
[1:00:10] for when they shall say peace and safety
[1:00:13] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:00:16] as travail upon a woman with a child and
[1:00:18] they shall not escape
[1:00:21] but ye brethren are not in darkness
[1:00:25] that that day should overtake you as a
[1:00:27] thief
[1:00:29] we are all the children of light
[1:00:31] and the children of the day
[1:00:33] we are not of the night
[1:00:36] nor of darkness
[1:00:37] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[1:00:41] but let us watch
[1:00:42] and be sober
[1:00:44] we go to revelations 19
[1:00:50] from verses 7
[1:00:54] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:00:57] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:00:59] lamb is come
[1:01:01] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:01:05] and to her was granted that she should
[1:01:07] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:01:11] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:01:13] of the saints
[1:01:15] and he sayeth unto me right blessed are
[1:01:18] they which are called
[1:01:19] unto the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:01:22] so blessed are those that is called unto
[1:01:25] the meristep of the lamb and he sayeth
[1:01:27] unto me these are the true sayings of
[1:01:29] god
[1:01:30] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[1:01:33] and he said unto me see thou do it not
[1:01:37] i am thy fellow servant
[1:01:39] and of thy brethren
[1:01:41] that have the testimony of jesus
[1:01:44] worship god
[1:01:46] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[1:01:49] of prophecy let's just bow our heads for
[1:01:51] the word of prayer
[1:01:52] almighty god eternal father we come to
[1:01:54] your throne of grace and mercy
[1:01:57] thanking you lord just for this
[1:01:58] opportunity that we have oh father to be

[1:02:48] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:02:51] and at the same time also just to greet
[1:02:53] the rest of the bride around the world
[1:02:55] that will be watching this service when
[1:02:57] it's played
[1:02:58] may the lord richly bless you and i pray
[1:03:00] that this message will be a blessing
[1:03:03] so just to come back to the inspiration
[1:03:05] for the convention brother solomon gave
[1:03:07] it through as behold
[1:03:09] the bridegroom cometh
[1:03:11] lamp trimming time
[1:03:14] now we know that the inspiration is also
[1:03:16] based on matthew 25 where
[1:03:18] it speaks about the ten virgins the five
[1:03:21] wise the five foolish
[1:03:24] and the bridegroom coming
[1:03:27] now the prophet preaches a message on
[1:03:29] the 10 virgins in 144 000
[1:03:32] and if you allow me i wanted to really
[1:03:35] look at this
[1:03:36] from a different angle
[1:03:39] because looking at that scripture
[1:03:42] it talks about the 144 000
[1:03:46] then we know there's the five foolish
[1:03:48] and we know there's five wise
[1:03:51] we know the 144 000 has their place
[1:03:55] and they will have their two witnesses
[1:03:58] we know that the the the five foolish is
[1:04:01] the remnant
[1:04:04] but i wanna address really looking at
[1:04:07] the wise virgins
[1:04:11] and because out of that story if you
[1:04:13] understand it
[1:04:15] she must be a special lady
[1:04:18] and so this morning my message is is
[1:04:21] really to the bride
[1:04:24] and if i would title the message i would
[1:04:26] call it a message for the wise virgins
[1:04:29] or you could say a message to the wise
[1:04:31] ones
[1:04:33] because somewhere along the line their
[1:04:34] prophet says there is there's churches
[1:04:36] churches
[1:04:38] brides brides but there's only one
[1:04:40] special lady
[1:04:42] that is chosen
[1:04:45] and there's no ifs and buts when it
[1:04:47] comes to that
[1:04:48] the prophet says that he had chosen a
[1:04:50] bride out of his own choosing the very
[1:04:53] same way that you and i when we had
[1:04:55] chosen our wives
[1:04:56] or our brides it doesn't matter who else
[1:04:59] was there
[1:05:00] but she is that special lady
[1:05:03] that was chosen
[1:05:05] so this morning i want to address the
[1:05:07] message to this special lady
[1:05:10] because that's who he's coming for
[1:05:12] behold the bridegroom comes who's he
[1:05:14] coming for he's coming for the one
[1:05:17] that he chose
[1:05:19] so there's no misgivings there's no
[1:05:20] misunderstandings
[1:05:22] there's only one special lady
[1:05:25] and this is who i want to address the
[1:05:27] the message to
[1:05:29] the inspiration is the bride has made
[1:05:31] itself ready
[1:05:32] by the message of the hour
[1:05:35] because if the message of the hour
[1:05:36] didn't come
[1:05:38] she wouldn't have known that she was the
[1:05:39] chosen bride
[1:05:41] and if you and and i want you to take
[1:05:44] the the ministry of eliezer
[1:05:46] as the bottom line or the underlying
[1:05:49] theme for this message why because
[1:05:52] elaiza was sent to get a bride for isaac
[1:05:57] and if eleazar didn't come the bride
[1:05:59] would not have known that she's the
[1:06:01] chosen one
[1:06:02] and if she didn't accept the proposal
[1:06:06] the marriage would not have happened
[1:06:12] so so you and i are living in the most
[1:06:14] glorious time of all ages
[1:06:17] the prophet says why because it's the
[1:06:19] coming of the lord we're living in the
[1:06:21] age of the coming of the lord
[1:06:26] and if the church only recognizes who
[1:06:29] she is
[1:06:30] the prophet says the rapture will go
[1:06:33] so the message came to identify you
[1:06:36] as the bride of christ
[1:06:38] so that the rapture would go
[1:06:43] now the prophet says we've come through
[1:06:44] all the ages he says we've come through
[1:06:46] the reformers and he's talking about the
[1:06:48] church ages we've come through
[1:06:49] justification sanctification he says the
[1:06:52] restoration of the gifts but we are
[1:06:54] right now at the top of the tree
[1:06:57] and this is the age when the fruit is
[1:06:59] now being made manifest in other words
[1:07:01] it was the restoration of god himself
[1:07:04] appearing amongst us
[1:07:06] and that's basically what i want to take
[1:07:08] as a theme
[1:07:12] and if you look at it if you look at
[1:07:14] through the ages we know that god has
[1:07:15] chosen a bride
[1:07:17] through the church ages
[1:07:19] he says there was an elected seat for
[1:07:21] each and every age that came
[1:07:23] but now we come right up to where we are
[1:07:26] now
[1:07:27] and if you look back through the church
[1:07:29] ages the way the prophet will say he
[1:07:31] says they without us
[1:07:33] is not going to be made perfect
[1:07:35] so in other words they are depending on
[1:07:37] you
[1:07:38] the last church age bride
[1:07:40] to come to perfection so that you can
[1:07:43] call the resurrection
[1:07:47] and so that's what i want to do now
[1:07:50] just to set the theme
[1:07:52] the prophet in a message called ashamed
[1:07:58] he says he was
[1:08:00] troubled at some stage he said lord
[1:08:03] show me
[1:08:04] a character in the bible
[1:08:07] that my ministry ties into
[1:08:11] and in that message the prophet explains
[1:08:13] he's talking about when he was working
[1:08:15] for the public service company
[1:08:17] and and he you know he had he was just
[1:08:19] troubled and he says at that stage he
[1:08:21] says the
[1:08:22] he was led to just open up his bible
[1:08:25] he says and he opened up his bible and
[1:08:27] he opened it up right on to genesis 24.
[1:08:32] and on genesis 24 in genesis 24 abraham
[1:08:37] instructed his servant eliza
[1:08:40] to go and fetch a bride
[1:08:43] for my son isaac
[1:08:46] now that was the perfect identification
[1:08:48] of the ministry of malachi 4
[1:08:50] to show exactly he asked the lord show
[1:08:53] me a character
[1:08:54] in the bible that my ministry
[1:08:57] fits in with
[1:08:59] and god allowed him to open up to
[1:09:00] genesis 24.
[1:09:02] now if you listen to the account of
[1:09:04] genesis 24
[1:09:06] abraham extracts
[1:09:08] and he makes him swear
[1:09:11] that you're gonna go get a bride from my
[1:09:12] people
[1:09:15] and eliza says but what if she doesn't
[1:09:17] want to come he says but don't worry
[1:09:19] jehovah will send an angel before you
[1:09:24] he says but you're the one that's going
[1:09:25] to carry the message to her
[1:09:28] and you are the one that will bring her
[1:09:30] an introducer
[1:09:32] to my son
[1:09:35] and and and that's the underlying theme
[1:09:38] that i want to bring
[1:09:41] now
[1:09:43] mrs jesus christ is who will be
[1:09:45] preaching to
[1:09:48] in a message proving his word
[1:09:52] according to malachi
[1:09:53] according to malachi 4 luke 17 30
[1:09:56] revelations 10 7
[1:09:59] luke 17 30 specifically speaks about in
[1:10:02] the day when the son of man is to be
[1:10:04] revealed
[1:10:06] now in that message proving his word the
[1:10:08] prophet puts it this way he says
[1:10:11] what is the reason why
[1:10:13] the son of man is to be revealed he says
[1:10:16] is to join the church to its head
[1:10:18] then he says in that message it's to
[1:10:20] unite the marriage of the bride
[1:10:23] so in other words when we go to the
[1:10:25] marriage supper of the lamb
[1:10:27] the marriage ceremony has to take place
[1:10:29] why because the marriage supper is this
[1:10:31] is the celebration
[1:10:33] why because the two has already now been
[1:10:35] declared one
[1:10:37] they know are no longer twin but they
[1:10:39] are now one flesh
[1:10:42] and then they go to the wedding supper
[1:10:44] of the lamb
[1:10:45] so we're looking at the
[1:10:47] at the sequence of events before he
[1:10:50] comes and takes her away
[1:10:52] now the prophet says the bridegroom ko
[1:10:56] will come right through this
[1:10:59] and when he refers to that in a quote he
[1:11:01] says when the son of man
[1:11:03] comes down
[1:11:05] from heaven
[1:11:07] in flesh
[1:11:08] he says to unite the two together
[1:11:12] and the church itself has to be the word
[1:11:14] why because she is being joined to the
[1:11:17] word
[1:11:18] and we've preached on this before
[1:11:21] then he turns around he says the
[1:11:22] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:11:25] son of man
[1:11:27] is to bring that uniting
[1:11:31] now can we clap our hands and thank god
[1:11:35] that he said an elohees a ministry
[1:11:38] to unite the bride with the bridegroom
[1:11:44] because rebecca did not know that she
[1:11:46] was the chosen one
[1:11:48] eliezer told her he chose you
[1:11:52] as the bride
[1:11:53] so there's no misgivings there's no
[1:11:55] misunderstandings there's only one bride
[1:11:58] there's only one rebecca that was chosen
[1:12:02] and the day that he comes back
[1:12:05] she is the one that he's coming for
[1:12:08] let's give the lord and a praise for
[1:12:09] that amen
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:14] he says and he took the very
[1:12:15] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:12:18] son of man to
[1:12:20] identify her as the bride
[1:12:23] now he says who is the son of man he
[1:12:26] says it's jesus christ it's jesus christ
[1:12:29] himself that came down in human flesh
[1:12:32] amongst us he says to make his word so
[1:12:35] real
[1:12:36] that it unites the church and him as one
[1:12:40] and then he says the bride
[1:12:43] he says and then they will go to the
[1:12:46] wedding supper
[1:12:48] now he says the rapture is only going to
[1:12:50] the wedding supper
[1:12:52] he says but the word is here to unite
[1:12:54] the person
[1:12:56] now we've spoken on this before now when
[1:12:58] he says the person is referring to an
[1:13:01] individual
[1:13:03] is to unite the person and that is when
[1:13:06] the two becomes one
[1:13:09] now the prophet says at that time with
[1:13:11] the uniting time he says that is going
[1:13:14] to be the bride coming of christ
[1:13:17] so in other words it's the individual
[1:13:20] that is united with the word
[1:13:23] so it's not your denomination it's not
[1:13:26] your church it's not your group in the
[1:13:28] message or your denomination in the
[1:13:31] message
[1:13:32] it's about the individual that is united
[1:13:35] with the world and that is the person
[1:13:38] that makes part of the bride body
[1:13:54] in this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:13:57] now we know that the manifestation of
[1:13:58] the ministry of the son of man is the
[1:14:01] bridegroom
[1:14:02] because improving is what the prophet
[1:14:03] says this
[1:14:06] now in this day the scripture is
[1:14:07] fulfilled he turns around and he says i
[1:14:10] say to you
[1:14:11] tonight this was preached in 1965
[1:14:15] again that this day the scripture is
[1:14:17] fulfilled in your sight
[1:14:19] you in tucson you in in california you
[1:14:21] in new york
[1:14:22] you on the telephone hookups i say this
[1:14:25] day
[1:14:26] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:14:28] in your sight
[1:14:30] then he turns around in in that quote he
[1:14:32] says let us be glad
[1:14:35] let us be merry
[1:14:37] why for the marriage of the lamb is at
[1:14:40] hand and his bride has made herself
[1:14:44] ready
[1:14:45] so there's the marriage taking place
[1:14:53] it's mind-blowing
[1:14:55] and that's why we can thank god for
[1:14:56] sending this
[1:14:58] a ministry
[1:15:00] because i didn't know before the message
[1:15:02] came i didn't know that i'm bride
[1:15:03] material i didn't know that i was
[1:15:06] elected before the foundation of the
[1:15:07] world to make a part of his bride body
[1:15:10] for this age
[1:15:12] and they without me
[1:15:14] cannot be made perfect
[1:15:16] why because she will come to the perfect
[1:15:18] perfection to call up the resurrection
[1:15:21] my my my let's give the lord and a
[1:15:23] praise for that
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:32] [Music]
[1:15:33] now in exposition of the church the
[1:15:35] prophet says
[1:15:36] with the restoration of the word comes
[1:15:38] the restoration of the power
[1:15:40] he says but also it is a fact that the
[1:15:42] prophet of this last age must
[1:15:45] be bringing forth a message
[1:15:47] from god that will forerun the second
[1:15:50] coming
[1:15:51] so that was his ministry it was to
[1:15:53] forerun the second coming
[1:15:55] for by his message will the hearts of
[1:15:59] the children be turned back to the
[1:16:01] pentecostal fathers
[1:16:03] and with the restoration of the word
[1:16:06] welcome the restoration of the power
[1:16:11] now jesus said in that day when the son
[1:16:14] of man is going to be revealed from
[1:16:15] heaven
[1:16:17] in a message the called out the prophet
[1:16:20] says this he says let me close
[1:16:23] by saying this
[1:16:25] that the son of man is now being
[1:16:26] revealed from heaven
[1:16:29] now that was the appearing of the son of
[1:16:31] man
[1:16:32] what was it it was a son of man
[1:16:34] revealing the son of man
[1:16:37] and then in that message called out he
[1:16:39] says it was the very same way that he
[1:16:41] revealed himself to abraham
[1:16:45] he says and the revealing comes just
[1:16:47] before the destruction
[1:16:50] and that also comes just before the
[1:16:52] changing of the body
[1:16:53] why because he visited abraham just
[1:16:56] before
[1:16:57] the body change
[1:17:00] and so if he does it that way he's
[1:17:02] always going to do it in the same way
[1:17:08] now he says in that day they missed it
[1:17:11] only abram recognized this man in flesh
[1:17:16] was
[1:17:17] the son of man
[1:17:19] why because by a revelation he had
[1:17:21] dressed him as my lord
[1:17:24] because behind that flesh was filled the
[1:17:27] son of man
[1:17:31] then in perfect faith he says this
[1:17:34] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:17:36] and the intents of the heart
[1:17:38] but the word was failed in flesh when he
[1:17:42] done that
[1:17:43] so in other words the word was filled in
[1:17:45] flesh
[1:17:47] he stood with his back turned to the
[1:17:49] tent
[1:17:50] and he discerned what was in sarah's
[1:17:52] heart
[1:17:53] the word comes back
[1:17:56] in jeffersonville in our age
[1:18:00] the word was veiled behind flesh
[1:18:03] the word turned around and i'm going to
[1:18:05] read a quote
[1:18:07] where he says that very same angel that
[1:18:10] was sitting with abraham
[1:18:12] was now veiled behind flesh
[1:18:15] and is doing the very same thing
[1:18:17] that he did back then
[1:18:19] now abram recognized it
[1:18:21] and if you are the seed of abraham you
[1:18:24] too will recognize
[1:18:27] the appearing of the son of man behind
[1:18:31] human flesh
[1:18:33] and the identification is
[1:18:36] the discern of the thoughts and the
[1:18:38] intents of the heart
[1:18:41] now
[1:18:42] in a message the mark of the beast
[1:18:44] the prophet turns around in that message
[1:18:46] he turns his back to the audience
[1:18:49] and i'm going to read the quote he says
[1:18:50] this now there's many praying
[1:18:53] if i can if somebody like the little
[1:18:55] woman that can touch his garment he says
[1:18:58] yes right before me now is coming a
[1:19:01] vision
[1:19:02] it happens to be a woman she's sitting
[1:19:04] there now remember
[1:19:06] he's got his back down to the audience
[1:19:08] as he's speaking
[1:19:09] i'm reading the quote
[1:19:11] he says she has heart trouble
[1:19:14] also with my back turned
[1:19:16] if i call her name maybe she'd
[1:19:19] understand
[1:19:20] then he says mrs hudson mrs hansen
[1:19:23] stand up and receive your healing
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:29] now i've never looked around yet
[1:19:32] he says now do you believe
[1:19:34] he says just have faith
[1:19:36] where was the lady
[1:19:38] she's back this way somewhere
[1:19:41] he says right there then he says was
[1:19:44] those things true lady
[1:19:47] are we strange to one another
[1:19:51] it is wave your hand like this
[1:19:54] was all true was it question mark
[1:19:57] then he turns around and he says this
[1:20:00] then the same angel of god that was
[1:20:03] sitting there at sodom
[1:20:05] and gomorrah to give a sign to abraham
[1:20:09] that hour was that the hour was drawing
[1:20:12] close for the burning of sodom is here
[1:20:16] tonight
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:28] now to you and i
[1:20:30] we were not there that night
[1:20:32] that he preached that message
[1:20:35] that he demonstrated the sign
[1:20:38] now blessed are you
[1:20:40] who has not seen
[1:20:42] but yet believed it
[1:20:45] why because you receive the prophet
[1:20:48] in the name of a prophet
[1:20:50] and you are the one that will receive
[1:20:52] the prophet's reward
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:20:58] my
[1:20:59] [Applause]
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:07] now he says in convince then concerned
[1:21:10] he says there's a great difference
[1:21:12] between the sign of jesus appearing
[1:21:15] and then jesus coming
[1:21:18] in in that message he says now the
[1:21:20] appearing of the lord is now
[1:21:23] this is in his own monastery
[1:21:26] he says and he's appearing in his people
[1:21:29] so in other words there was a ministry
[1:21:30] of the son of man in the wave chief
[1:21:32] there's going to be a ministry in the
[1:21:34] son of man in his people
[1:21:37] that will be the bride coming of christ
[1:21:40] and when we say the lord is coming
[1:21:44] what the prophet was saying the lord is
[1:21:46] coming is it's a bride coming why
[1:21:49] because he's going to be reflecting
[1:21:50] himself
[1:21:51] at this day through his bright body
[1:21:56] and when that happens that is the
[1:21:58] kickoff to the resurrection because they
[1:22:00] meet him in the air the next time that
[1:22:03] jesus comes back would be uh it would be
[1:22:05] with the millennium
[1:22:07] so they won't see him
[1:22:10] in other words it's a sudden secret
[1:22:12] going away
[1:22:13] it's an invisible union of the
[1:22:15] bridegroom and the bride
[1:22:18] they won't even know that he's come to
[1:22:20] snatch her away
[1:22:23] they won't even know that the marriage
[1:22:24] of the lamb has already taken place
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:22:34] now he says it's a spirit that's working
[1:22:36] among them proving that it's him
[1:22:39] with them
[1:22:40] what will it be he says it's to get them
[1:22:42] ready for the rapture
[1:22:44] for the coming of the lord and to catch
[1:22:46] away his pride
[1:22:48] he says now that's the appearing and
[1:22:50] then he's coming now paul in the message
[1:22:53] a sudden secret going away of the church
[1:22:55] he says notice what paul said in second
[1:22:58] timothy 4 8.
[1:23:00] he says paul said there is a crown of
[1:23:02] righteousness laid up for me that the
[1:23:04] lord
[1:23:05] the righteous judge will give to me on
[1:23:08] that day
[1:23:09] he says then paul stopped notice why he
[1:23:12] paused
[1:23:13] he says did you notice why he paused and
[1:23:15] what did he say next he says but not
[1:23:17] only to me
[1:23:18] he says but to all of them that love is
[1:23:21] appearing
[1:23:23] all of them that love is appearing you
[1:23:25] and i love his appearing why because we
[1:23:27] recognized that this was god himself
[1:23:30] that had come down
[1:23:31] behind flesh
[1:23:34] and came to call you
[1:23:36] bride now when the prophet preached i
[1:23:38] don't know if you honest if you remember
[1:23:39] i think it was an exposition where he
[1:23:41] says for you to understand what i'm
[1:23:44] saying now i'm gonna call you pride
[1:23:48] this is what the prophet said
[1:23:50] he says for you to get the revelation
[1:23:51] i'm calling you bride
[1:23:53] why is he calling me bride
[1:23:55] when he preached what did he do he only
[1:23:57] preached the the opening of the word it
[1:24:00] was the revelation of the seals it was
[1:24:02] the mysteries being revealed but all of
[1:24:04] a sudden you recognize your name
[1:24:07] he says it was an oman evil only veil
[1:24:10] he just preached the mystery he preached
[1:24:12] the unfolding you are showing jesus
[1:24:15] christ he was unfolding your bridegroom
[1:24:18] to you and you recognized but that's me
[1:24:22] that's my name
[1:24:24] and that is you
[1:24:26] in the bride part of the bride you are
[1:24:29] the brain there's no misgivings there's
[1:24:31] no misconceptions when he comes he's
[1:24:33] coming for you
[1:24:35] there's no other lady that he's coming
[1:24:37] for
[1:24:39] my man
[1:24:47] now if you notice this is unquote
[1:24:49] is coming
[1:24:51] is set in motion
[1:24:53] by is appearing
[1:24:56] so he comes down and he appears behind
[1:24:58] the son of man
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:02] that was the shout ministry
[1:25:06] but that appearing was setting into
[1:25:08] motion he's coming
[1:25:13] now
[1:25:15] if we look at this lady
[1:25:17] she must be someone very special
[1:25:20] for for the god of the universe
[1:25:24] for the god that created all of what we
[1:25:26] see and what we don't see to have chosen
[1:25:30] she must be someone special
[1:25:32] i wonder who this lady is
[1:25:35] the prophet says and if you take it and
[1:25:37] you tie now
[1:25:38] into the story of the ranch
[1:25:40] the ranch's son
[1:25:43] her cousins was like when she said you
[1:25:45] know what
[1:25:47] he said he's coming back for me
[1:25:49] they couldn't believe her
[1:25:51] that can't be when did you get to speak
[1:25:53] to you
[1:25:54] no do you remember the time that he
[1:25:56] appeared he came to visit
[1:25:59] that was when he spoke to me
[1:26:01] why because he had in between that time
[1:26:04] when they were celebrating and making us
[1:26:06] she was the one that was in the back
[1:26:08] parts
[1:26:09] she was the one that had a dirty apron
[1:26:12] he started he decided the ranch's wife
[1:26:15] the ranch's son to walk behind the
[1:26:17] building and all of a sudden he sees
[1:26:19] this virtuous girl
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:23] and he spoke to her
[1:26:25] and he recognized in her very character
[1:26:28] that he wanted he recognized in her that
[1:26:31] she will be the very reflection of his
[1:26:33] nature
[1:26:34] and they can't understand but now when
[1:26:36] did he speak to you there was an
[1:26:38] appearance
[1:26:40] and he said he's coming back to for me
[1:26:44] they couldn't believe it why because it
[1:26:46] can't be
[1:26:47] you dirty
[1:26:52] you don't have your earrings on all you
[1:26:54] producing and all you're showing is the
[1:26:56] virtue
[1:26:57] but that is the character that he was
[1:26:59] looking for
[1:27:00] and so what happened is she's the one
[1:27:02] that he made the promise to so in other
[1:27:04] words it didn't matter how many suitors
[1:27:08] was there
[1:27:10] there's only one that he made a promise
[1:27:11] to
[1:27:12] there's only one that he comes back for
[1:27:16] and when the cry goes out
[1:27:18] behold
[1:27:19] the bridegroom cometh he's only coming
[1:27:22] for one elected lady
[1:27:25] and she is the one that he made a
[1:27:27] promise to
[1:27:29] that i'm coming
[1:27:30] and the prophet says he came that call
[1:27:32] went out in the seventh watch
[1:27:35] now the seventh watch is the hour just
[1:27:37] between twelve and three
[1:27:39] and he says the seventh watch is the
[1:27:40] seventh age
[1:27:42] and and and and the ministry of malachi
[1:27:45] 4 is that 7th watch
[1:27:46] so that shout message was behold the
[1:27:49] bridegroom is coming
[1:27:51] rise
[1:27:52] from your lamps
[1:27:53] and make yourself ready
[1:27:55] for him
[1:27:57] let's give a lot and a place let me get
[1:27:59] back to my notes
[1:28:01] bye
[1:28:05] [Applause]
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:17] amen
[1:28:19] my my my
[1:28:20] special lady
[1:28:22] she's a special lady
[1:28:24] here's a portion of this bright body
[1:28:27] on the live stream she's probably she's
[1:28:29] all over individuals
[1:28:31] making up this bright body
[1:28:33] that he had chosen from before the
[1:28:35] foundation of the world
[1:28:37] now in who is this melchizedek the
[1:28:38] prophet says according to malachi 4 luke
[1:28:40] 17. he would appear again in human form
[1:28:43] amongst his people he's going to be
[1:28:45] doing the same things that he did you
[1:28:48] will be revealing the same things
[1:28:50] and he says you will be showing the same
[1:28:51] messianic sign
[1:28:55] now
[1:28:57] they missed it
[1:28:59] because they didn't see it coming in the
[1:29:01] way they thought it should come
[1:29:05] now if you look at the coming of the son
[1:29:06] of man
[1:29:08] when christ himself was made flesh when
[1:29:10] god himself was made flesh
[1:29:12] he says he didn't come as a theologian
[1:29:16] he didn't come as a priest
[1:29:19] he didn't come as the king the way the
[1:29:21] jews would have wanted him to come why
[1:29:23] because he will come and he will
[1:29:24] establish the kingdom of israel
[1:29:27] but the prophet says he came
[1:29:29] according to scripture
[1:29:32] and yet they failed to see it
[1:29:34] why because moses himself told them he
[1:29:36] prophesied and he said that god
[1:29:39] jehovah will rise up a prophet like unto
[1:29:42] me
[1:29:43] and in that message he says he came the
[1:29:45] way it was prophesied of him
[1:29:48] and in this very same day he came the
[1:29:50] way the scriptures foretold
[1:29:53] he came as a prophet
[1:29:55] he came veiled behind the prophet
[1:29:58] and as they did in that day they missed
[1:30:00] the coming or the appearing
[1:30:02] this is how they must be appearing but
[1:30:04] there's one special lady that did not
[1:30:06] miss it
[1:30:07] why because the message came
[1:30:09] specifically for her
[1:30:12] amen
[1:30:15] now as it was in the days of noah and in
[1:30:17] the days of lot
[1:30:19] it be in the coming of the son of man
[1:30:21] again
[1:30:23] he says just before the days of the
[1:30:24] anti-deluvian destructions this is in
[1:30:26] the called out
[1:30:28] he sent a prophet to the earth
[1:30:31] enoch
[1:30:32] he sent an angel
[1:30:35] he sent a message
[1:30:37] he done the supernatural
[1:30:40] he says but what did they do in that day
[1:30:42] they ate
[1:30:44] they drank
[1:30:45] they married they planted but they
[1:30:48] rejected the message that came
[1:30:51] and he says the very same thing he does
[1:30:53] in this day and in this age
[1:30:56] he sent an angel
[1:30:58] he sent a message
[1:31:00] he sent a messenger with the message he
[1:31:03] done the supernatural
[1:31:05] but what did they do
[1:31:06] they did eat
[1:31:08] they drink they marry they continue to
[1:31:11] plant
[1:31:12] but they missed the message
[1:31:14] that was brought
[1:31:17] then in called out he says what did that
[1:31:18] message consist of
[1:31:20] he says it consisted of grace mercy and
[1:31:23] deliverance
[1:31:26] now we know what enoch represented enoch
[1:31:28] represented the bride going
[1:31:30] and noah representing the the the
[1:31:33] remnant
[1:31:35] now he says in recognizing your day in
[1:31:37] his message the reason why the people he
[1:31:39] knows they did not go into the ark was
[1:31:41] because they never recognized the
[1:31:42] message or the messenger
[1:31:45] why because it was too simple
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:49] for their scientific age
[1:31:52] so the simplicity of the message and the
[1:31:55] messenger is why they missed it
[1:31:59] he says noah wasn't scientific he wasn't
[1:32:01] even educated so in other words he might
[1:32:03] not even be able to articulate himself
[1:32:07] as well educated as they were in that
[1:32:09] day
[1:32:11] but he had a message
[1:32:13] from god
[1:32:15] it will reign
[1:32:17] and he preached that message to whoever
[1:32:20] was to be identified
[1:32:23] or for whoever that message was meant
[1:32:25] for
[1:32:27] and so because of the simplicity of that
[1:32:31] is why they missed it
[1:32:36] so we know that he came for an elected
[1:32:37] lady
[1:32:39] now just looking at who this bride is
[1:32:43] when did that election happen when did
[1:32:46] he
[1:32:48] say
[1:32:49] it's you
[1:32:53] now it took the message of the hour to
[1:32:55] come identify you as bride
[1:32:58] and you may ask yourself the question
[1:33:00] well when did he elect me
[1:33:02] to be part of this bride
[1:33:05] and we know we spoke about this in the
[1:33:06] first seal the prophet says do you know
[1:33:08] that he put the wedding band of
[1:33:10] predestinated unmerited grace
[1:33:13] on you before the foundation of the
[1:33:15] world
[1:33:16] so so so he chose you as his bride even
[1:33:19] before he decided to form a molecule
[1:33:22] even before he decided to talk like to
[1:33:25] speak right into existence
[1:33:27] that is when he chose you now he says in
[1:33:29] that spoken word he says that
[1:33:31] he he put the wedding band
[1:33:34] of pre-destiny
[1:33:36] unmerited grace
[1:33:39] he slipped it on you
[1:33:42] that time already
[1:33:44] so in in this age or whenever you were
[1:33:46] born now you come into existence
[1:33:51] but you come from there
[1:33:55] [Applause]
[1:33:57] and he took the message of the owl to
[1:33:59] identify you
[1:34:01] to allow you now now i heard a preacher
[1:34:03] say before he says spiritual amnesia
[1:34:06] only means that you you you had
[1:34:12] the knowledge of something
[1:34:14] or the consciousness of something
[1:34:16] all it is is that you just forgot it
[1:34:19] so it only took that messenger to come
[1:34:20] and bring to your remembrance spiritual
[1:34:22] remembrance
[1:34:24] where were you
[1:34:26] when the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:34:30] you were there before the foundation of
[1:34:32] the world
[1:34:33] so he took this alley he's a ministry
[1:34:36] to come bring to you
[1:34:38] your remembrance
[1:34:40] do you know when he chose you
[1:34:43] do you know when he slipped the wedding
[1:34:44] band of predestinated unmerited grace on
[1:34:47] your finger
[1:34:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:34:52] so now you realize yes he is special
[1:34:55] wow
[1:34:56] if he done that
[1:34:58] that was the attribute and now you the
[1:35:00] expression
[1:35:02] of that attribute so the very same you
[1:35:04] and i decide this is going to be my
[1:35:07] bride he says he took a brian out of his
[1:35:09] own choosing the prophet says he created
[1:35:13] his own bride
[1:35:15] and that's you and i
[1:35:16] that had come into manifestation
[1:35:19] and so that's the reason why i'm saying
[1:35:21] this message is for that special lady
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:26] the 144th has got their
[1:35:29] their time
[1:35:30] but it's about the special lady that it
[1:35:32] takes
[1:35:33] before that
[1:35:37] now he's now in the first seal
[1:35:42] he says the antichrist in that they will
[1:35:44] deceive all
[1:35:46] on the face of the earth whose names
[1:35:47] were not written
[1:35:49] under those seals from the foundation of
[1:35:51] the world
[1:35:53] and so therefore then we recognize and
[1:35:54] we realize that this is his perfect
[1:35:56] redemption plan
[1:35:58] when he took the book
[1:36:00] from the original owner
[1:36:03] that was his pride
[1:36:06] that was the redemption
[1:36:08] he says and the prophet puts it this way
[1:36:09] he says and that was him redeeming her
[1:36:13] comes down and he dies and he pays the
[1:36:15] price
[1:36:16] he goes up and he intercedes for each
[1:36:19] and every name as they come about
[1:36:21] in the designated decreed season
[1:36:25] he says but now we are talking about the
[1:36:27] time
[1:36:28] when he comes to redeemer so in other
[1:36:31] words to receiver
[1:36:33] because he's already come to redeem and
[1:36:35] he's coming to receive
[1:36:37] unto himself
[1:36:39] and the third time he comes with her as
[1:36:41] king and queen
[1:36:43] let's give the lord a hand of praise for
[1:36:44] that
[1:36:46] that's the reason why i'm saying she's a
[1:36:47] special special lady
[1:36:55] now talking about this election now in
[1:36:57] other words when was she elected
[1:36:59] in the first seal
[1:37:01] he says see now that's the elect
[1:37:04] when the sound come the bridegroom
[1:37:06] cometh then every one of those that slip
[1:37:09] down through those ages awakened
[1:37:11] he says everyone see it isn't god as we
[1:37:14] would think just going to hunt him out a
[1:37:17] few thousand people of this age and take
[1:37:20] them
[1:37:22] so it wasn't a haphazard choosing
[1:37:25] he says it's the very elected out of
[1:37:28] every age and that's the reason that
[1:37:30] christ has to stay on the meritorial
[1:37:32] seat back here as an intercessor until
[1:37:36] that last one comes in at the last age
[1:37:42] and the prophet turns around he says and
[1:37:43] these revelations then
[1:37:46] of what it has been breaks forth
[1:37:49] upon the people
[1:37:51] and they see what's happened
[1:37:53] so he took the message of the hour
[1:37:55] the shout message for to reveal to you
[1:37:58] to open it unto you it was the revealing
[1:38:01] of christ
[1:38:02] to show to you who you are
[1:38:04] because then we came to the realization
[1:38:06] that okay that's my name he says the
[1:38:08] very same way that john recognized his
[1:38:10] name when those seals was broken he saw
[1:38:13] himself
[1:38:15] and he saw himself as a bride he saw
[1:38:17] himself as a member of the bright body
[1:38:19] and when the mystery was preached you
[1:38:21] saw yourself
[1:38:22] and that's the reason why you rejoice
[1:38:25] the very same way that john rejoiced
[1:38:27] why because the opening of the seals
[1:38:31] showed me who i am
[1:38:33] it showed me who god is
[1:38:36] it showed me that he's elected me to be
[1:38:39] a part of his bride and that's why like
[1:38:41] john
[1:38:42] if we can only scream so that all of
[1:38:44] heaven everyone on the earth
[1:38:47] everyone beneath the earth will hear
[1:38:51] this rejoicing
[1:38:53] why because he has redeemed us
[1:38:56] from before the foundation of the world
[1:38:59] and he is the one that was found worthy
[1:39:02] to take the book to lose the seals and
[1:39:04] to redeemer
[1:39:06] and because he's redeemed he's the one
[1:39:09] that's coming to receiver
[1:39:11] to himself
[1:39:13] and that's the bride
[1:39:15] let's give the lord a praise amy
[1:39:30] now he says it's god that's calling the
[1:39:31] elected
[1:39:33] it's god that's calling a virtuous bride
[1:39:37] and she is the elected lady
[1:39:40] this is in the invisible union
[1:39:43] then the bride is always a part of the
[1:39:45] bridegroom
[1:39:46] why because we spoke about this before
[1:39:48] when when eve was taken from
[1:39:51] adam
[1:39:52] she was made from his body
[1:39:57] so this bride is a part of the
[1:39:59] bridegroom because she was taken out
[1:40:01] from him
[1:40:03] he says and it will have to be the word
[1:40:05] manifested to be the bride of christ
[1:40:08] now the prophet says he does this in
[1:40:10] every time he says by the same pattern
[1:40:13] he does it again he's calling out his
[1:40:15] virtuous bride in the last day
[1:40:17] then he says the lovely rebecca
[1:40:19] waiting for isaac he says oh what a
[1:40:23] beautiful time
[1:40:25] what a beautiful time
[1:40:27] why because she's got no misgiving she
[1:40:29] knows that she is the bride
[1:40:36] let's move on
[1:40:40] now the prophet in 10 virgins and 144
[1:40:43] 000 speaks about this seamstress
[1:40:47] and this is also just to show you the
[1:40:48] election
[1:40:50] he says there's a seamstress or a tailor
[1:40:52] cuts out the pattern
[1:40:57] she is the one that takes the scissor
[1:41:00] and cuts out
[1:41:03] of this pattern
[1:41:06] which part of the pattern
[1:41:08] will form a part of the garment that she
[1:41:11] makes
[1:41:13] then there's another part that is the
[1:41:15] remnant
[1:41:17] now the remnant is like the offcut
[1:41:20] but it's the same material
[1:41:23] then in in that message he says now
[1:41:26] what is this pattern
[1:41:29] how was it known
[1:41:31] he says by the one that placed the he
[1:41:34] says it's by the the part where the lady
[1:41:37] elected to cut
[1:41:40] so it's just a scissor cut
[1:41:42] that decides which part becomes a part
[1:41:45] of the garment which part becomes the
[1:41:47] remnant
[1:41:49] then he turns around he says now god
[1:41:51] before the foundation of the world who
[1:41:53] knew the end from the beginning
[1:41:55] buys for knowledge
[1:41:57] he elected where to cut
[1:42:01] my
[1:42:03] so if if you recognize this message
[1:42:06] and you accepted the appearing
[1:42:08] [Applause]
[1:42:10] you are the one
[1:42:13] that he elected where to cut
[1:42:17] then he turns around he says it's only
[1:42:18] he knew
[1:42:20] the difference between jacob and esau
[1:42:24] now look at how how
[1:42:28] marvelous this election was
[1:42:30] he says it's only god who knew before
[1:42:33] the foundation of the world but because
[1:42:35] he knew the end from the beginning
[1:42:37] by his four knowledge he says he elected
[1:42:40] where to cut
[1:42:42] then he turns around and he says our
[1:42:44] names were put on the book
[1:42:47] he says now listen to this he says our
[1:42:49] names was put on the book
[1:42:51] when he elected
[1:42:53] him
[1:42:54] to be the lamb that was going to be
[1:42:56] slain
[1:42:58] then he says then he elected you to be
[1:43:01] the one that the lamb is going to be
[1:43:03] slain for
[1:43:08] wow
[1:43:11] he says he elected you
[1:43:13] [Applause]
[1:43:18] he elected you
[1:43:20] to be associated with that lamb that was
[1:43:22] to be asleep
[1:43:24] then he says now what is the remnant he
[1:43:27] says that's the cut that's the piece
[1:43:29] that's cut and it's left
[1:43:31] but it's the same kind of goods he said
[1:43:33] but he didn't make the cut
[1:43:36] then he says now look at god's election
[1:43:39] look at god's predestination
[1:43:41] look at god's ordination
[1:43:44] he says it's him
[1:43:46] that decides
[1:43:47] and it's him that takes the church
[1:43:50] out
[1:43:51] of that
[1:43:53] he turns around and he says it's the
[1:43:54] remnant that will be left
[1:43:56] to go into the tribulation period
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:04] in the rapture message
[1:44:08] so there's nothing but the bride
[1:44:11] the elected ones that was four known by
[1:44:13] god from the beginning
[1:44:15] he says the father's spiritual genes
[1:44:20] so in other words
[1:44:21] she was that attribute in the father
[1:44:24] and she is nothing but the bride
[1:44:27] so in other words you come from god
[1:44:29] and you're going back to god
[1:44:32] now as god brought the nation out of a
[1:44:34] nation god will bring the pride out of a
[1:44:36] church the bride will be called from all
[1:44:39] the churches it will be the elected of
[1:44:41] god will be brought out and we're on the
[1:44:44] verge of that exodus right now for we
[1:44:47] have every scriptural proof
[1:44:50] that we're standing there
[1:44:52] now
[1:44:53] he says i know that that that's been
[1:44:55] said a lot of times but my friend
[1:44:58] one time it will be said for the very
[1:45:00] last time
[1:45:02] [Applause]
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:06] he says time will fade into eternity
[1:45:09] then
[1:45:10] he's coming to take a bride out of the
[1:45:12] church
[1:45:13] my my am i let's give the lord a praise
[1:45:24] now in the marriage ceremony
[1:45:26] at some stage the two is declared one
[1:45:29] so in other words i present to you must
[1:45:32] and misses
[1:45:33] jesus christ
[1:45:35] in other words she is now her
[1:45:37] identification is now in the bridegroom
[1:45:41] why because she takes on his name
[1:45:44] and so the two is now one
[1:45:48] in the marriage of the lamb he says as
[1:45:49] the feminist spirit was taken from adam
[1:45:53] and was put into the woman
[1:45:55] and when that happened he said then she
[1:45:58] was both
[1:46:00] or they were both in spirit and in body
[1:46:04] they were one
[1:46:07] then in marriage of the lamb he says now
[1:46:10] it was a beautiful type of what god did
[1:46:13] at calvary
[1:46:14] he took christ
[1:46:16] and he connected him with the church
[1:46:18] through a riven side
[1:46:21] he says he brought the blood that cleans
[1:46:23] the person
[1:46:25] that sanctifies the flesh of the church
[1:46:28] and puts the spirit of the living god
[1:46:30] that he took off the cross there
[1:46:34] he says out of christ
[1:46:36] he took the spirit out of christ and he
[1:46:39] puts it into the individual
[1:46:43] again it's not your church
[1:46:45] now we're talking about the individuals
[1:46:46] that makes up the bright body
[1:46:48] he says and when he does that he says
[1:46:51] then the two becomes one he says they
[1:46:54] become one why because it will be christ
[1:46:57] in you
[1:46:58] the hope of glory
[1:47:04] now he says then another thing is as
[1:47:06] soon as she takes a vows
[1:47:09] so she takes a vows
[1:47:10] she takes on her husband's name
[1:47:14] and then they are declared
[1:47:16] mister and misses
[1:47:19] jesus christ
[1:47:22] my wife is mrs thompson
[1:47:26] why because she took on my name
[1:47:29] and the two has now become one
[1:47:33] and he says when she does that then what
[1:47:35] does that make her
[1:47:37] she is now a
[1:47:40] of everything that he possesses
[1:47:43] [Applause]
[1:47:47] because when you see the bridegroom you
[1:47:49] see the bride
[1:47:51] she is a of all
[1:47:53] that he possesses
[1:47:55] why because she is misses jesus christ
[1:47:59] there's no other one that was that was
[1:48:02] joined to him
[1:48:03] but her
[1:48:05] a little while in the world will see me
[1:48:07] no more
[1:48:08] but you
[1:48:10] bride will see me why because i will be
[1:48:13] with you
[1:48:14] even in you
[1:48:16] until the end of the world
[1:48:18] what is that that is christ in you
[1:48:21] the hope of glory the two
[1:48:24] has become one
[1:48:29] and so now all we're waiting for is
[1:48:31] we're waiting the prophet says in
[1:48:32] uniting time and sign he says there's a
[1:48:35] uniting right on now he says what is she
[1:48:38] uniting for she's uniting for the
[1:48:40] rapture
[1:48:42] he says and who is she uniting with she
[1:48:45] is united with the word
[1:48:48] why because the bridegroom is the word
[1:48:51] now as the bride is a part of the
[1:48:53] bridegroom the woman is a part of her
[1:48:55] husband
[1:48:56] and then he takes the same type this is
[1:48:58] in rapture message the same type as when
[1:49:00] he says now if you look at eve
[1:49:02] was taken from adam
[1:49:04] so eve's mechanics was adam's mechanics
[1:49:08] the the feminist spirit of adam
[1:49:11] the first created man
[1:49:13] was put into that body
[1:49:16] so she was flesh of his flesh she was
[1:49:19] born of his bone she was spirit of his
[1:49:21] spirit
[1:49:23] and then he turns around in that message
[1:49:24] he said now the very same way this bride
[1:49:27] is taken from the bosom
[1:49:29] of the word of god for this day
[1:49:33] if she is taken from the bosom of the
[1:49:35] word of god for this day
[1:49:37] then she is word of his word why because
[1:49:40] he is the word that was made flesh
[1:49:43] and as soon as the uh his spirit comes
[1:49:46] into it to quicken that word to make it
[1:49:48] to life
[1:49:49] that's the bright body that comes to
[1:49:51] life
[1:49:52] so then she is word of his word flesh of
[1:49:55] his flesh bone of his bone she is spirit
[1:49:57] of his spirit
[1:49:59] and that is what makes her bride
[1:50:02] [Applause]
[1:50:10] so let's move on to the oil
[1:50:15] [Music]
[1:50:18] [Applause]
[1:50:23] in marriage of the lamb
[1:50:25] the prophet says now we know the oil is
[1:50:28] spirit
[1:50:29] and that's what the representation of
[1:50:30] the oil in the lamp was its spirit
[1:50:33] it says the marriage of the lamb christ
[1:50:34] injects into her
[1:50:37] his own spirit
[1:50:38] he says it's his own life
[1:50:41] and as the bible said to adam and eve
[1:50:44] that you are no longer two
[1:50:46] or you are no longer twin but you are
[1:50:48] now one he says when this woman the
[1:50:51] church
[1:50:52] is married to christ
[1:50:54] they too are no longer two
[1:50:57] but they are one because it will be
[1:50:59] christ in you
[1:51:01] then he turns around and says it's his
[1:51:03] life that has been brought
[1:51:05] into you
[1:51:07] so he sanctifies her so that he can
[1:51:09] bring his own life
[1:51:11] into her the prophet turns around he
[1:51:13] says then you become
[1:51:15] pride
[1:51:18] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:51:21] pokemon church age
[1:51:24] now from a little group of the true seed
[1:51:26] of the word god will present christ with
[1:51:28] a beloved bride she is virgin of his
[1:51:31] word she is a virgin because she knows
[1:51:33] no man made creeds or dogmas
[1:51:36] by and through the members of this bride
[1:51:38] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:51:41] of god to be made manifest in the virgin
[1:51:45] now the word of promise came to the
[1:51:46] virgin mary
[1:51:48] but that word of promise was ye
[1:51:51] himself
[1:51:52] to be made manifest
[1:51:54] in other words when the angel appeared
[1:51:56] the angel brought the message of good
[1:51:59] tidings to this virgin
[1:52:01] and he said to her the blessed are you
[1:52:05] amongst
[1:52:07] many virgins
[1:52:09] [Applause]
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:11] but you are the one that he chose
[1:52:14] and because she accepted the angel
[1:52:16] visitation
[1:52:18] she accepted the message that the angel
[1:52:20] brought the prophet says what was that
[1:52:23] manifestation it was he himself to be
[1:52:26] made manifest in her
[1:52:28] and through her that was eternal life he
[1:52:31] says because she believed
[1:52:33] the angel's message
[1:52:36] he says
[1:52:37] through her
[1:52:38] he was able to fulfill the prophecy of
[1:52:40] isaiah 9
[1:52:42] 6. why because she believed
[1:52:48] blessed are you
[1:52:50] amongst all the other virgins
[1:52:54] now notice the harmony of the father and
[1:52:56] the son jesus never did anything until
[1:52:58] it was first showed to him by the father
[1:53:01] then he goes to saint john 5 19 he says
[1:53:03] now this harmony is also to exist
[1:53:06] between the groom and his bride
[1:53:08] he shows her his word of life she
[1:53:10] receives it
[1:53:12] she never doubts it
[1:53:14] the word is in the bride
[1:53:16] as it was in mary
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:20] in other words she is pretty impregnated
[1:53:23] with the word
[1:53:25] and the bride has the mind of christ for
[1:53:27] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:53:30] word she performs the command of the
[1:53:32] word in his name for she has thus saith
[1:53:36] the lord
[1:53:38] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:53:40] and it comes to pass
[1:53:42] like a seed that is planted and watered
[1:53:45] it comes to fulfill it comes to full
[1:53:47] harvest
[1:53:49] to serve its purpose
[1:53:57] now he says that my word is spirit
[1:54:01] are we doing well with time
[1:54:04] then he refers to the wise virgin he
[1:54:06] says the wise virgin had oil in a lamp
[1:54:09] she trimmed the lamp
[1:54:11] when she heard the call
[1:54:15] and then he turns around and he says now
[1:54:16] we know that god is the word and we know
[1:54:18] that the oil is the spirit
[1:54:21] in conflict between god and satan he
[1:54:22] says god said that my word is spirit
[1:54:26] he says that's right then the true bride
[1:54:28] must be united by the word
[1:54:32] if she is a part of christ she has to be
[1:54:35] the word of christ
[1:54:37] in other words in both mechanics and
[1:54:38] dynamics and he says it in that quote
[1:54:42] that there has to become more there has
[1:54:44] to come one that will have both
[1:54:45] mechanics and dynamics
[1:54:47] and with the restoration of the word
[1:54:49] came the restoration of the power
[1:54:53] so that he can fulfill
[1:54:55] in her
[1:54:57] the bright coming of christ
[1:55:01] now if the oil is spirit then by one
[1:55:03] spirit are we all
[1:55:06] baptized into the body
[1:55:08] according to matthew 25 which is the
[1:55:10] kingdom and according to first
[1:55:12] corinthians 12 13
[1:55:14] in a sudden secret going away of the
[1:55:16] church
[1:55:17] he says keep oil in your lamp
[1:55:20] he says the oil is the spirit
[1:55:22] the holy spirit when you feel your love
[1:55:25] dying away
[1:55:27] and your sincerity towards christ he
[1:55:29] says go quickly to him who is the
[1:55:32] fountain of that oil
[1:55:35] so in other words this is what we know
[1:55:37] what the oil is we know that the oil is
[1:55:39] the holy spirit that's why according to
[1:55:41] ephesians 4 30 we grieve not the holy
[1:55:44] spirit
[1:55:45] because it's by that spirit that we are
[1:55:47] baptized that we are sealed
[1:55:50] until the day of our redemption
[1:55:52] until he comes and gets her
[1:55:55] now he says when she when he comes at
[1:55:57] that day he is coming for his holy
[1:55:59] spirit character
[1:56:01] he's coming because he wants to see his
[1:56:03] own nature reflected
[1:56:06] through her
[1:56:13] and so that's why ephesians 4 30 is so
[1:56:15] important to us
[1:56:17] as the bride because we don't want to
[1:56:19] grieve that spirit this is what we want
[1:56:21] he says in that quote he says keep oil
[1:56:23] in your lamp
[1:56:25] now remember we're addressing the wise
[1:56:26] virgins keep oil in your lamp he says if
[1:56:29] you feel it dying out go quickly
[1:56:32] and replenish
[1:56:33] he says why go to the fountain
[1:56:36] of that oil
[1:56:38] he is the fountain
[1:56:40] of that oil
[1:56:42] [Applause]
[1:56:46] now in mark of the best seal of god he
[1:56:48] says now there's a difference between
[1:56:50] the seal
[1:56:51] and a mark
[1:56:53] he says notice in genesis cane
[1:56:56] was marked
[1:56:58] but the marking of cain
[1:57:00] meant
[1:57:01] a distinction
[1:57:04] in other words it was a distinction and
[1:57:06] it was also brought about separation
[1:57:09] because as soon as cain was marked
[1:57:13] he went out from the presence of god
[1:57:16] so the mark was a separation to him
[1:57:19] then the prophet says he says i can show
[1:57:21] you and i can show you that the mark and
[1:57:23] the seal
[1:57:24] all the way from genesis and i'll run it
[1:57:26] right through to revelations
[1:57:29] he says but look at the difference
[1:57:31] between the two the one is to separate
[1:57:34] but the other one is a sign of ownership
[1:57:40] in other words if the church is sealed
[1:57:41] by the holy spirit
[1:57:43] it's showing that she is owned
[1:57:46] by him
[1:57:48] and that's the reason why the scripture
[1:57:50] says you are sealed until the day of
[1:57:52] your redemption
[1:57:54] until the day that you reach your
[1:57:56] destination so that ceiling shows
[1:57:59] ownership
[1:57:59] [Applause]
[1:58:01] so we don't want the mark because the
[1:58:03] mark is a separator depart from me
[1:58:05] because i never knew you
[1:58:11] you want the ceiling
[1:58:13] why because the ceiling shows that i
[1:58:15] belong to the bridegroom
[1:58:17] i am his
[1:58:18] she is him
[1:58:23] and you are sealed
[1:58:25] until the day
[1:58:28] of your destination
[1:58:30] why am i that is a beautiful one that
[1:58:32] one bless me
[1:58:33] let's give the lord another praise
[1:58:34] [Applause]
[1:58:44] 10 virgins 144
[1:58:48] he says what is the seal of god
[1:58:50] the holy ghost
[1:58:52] sure all right now he that has not the
[1:58:55] spirit of god is none of mine
[1:58:58] if you have the holy spirit you are part
[1:59:00] of god because you
[1:59:02] he is
[1:59:04] he's sealed you and he's in you he's
[1:59:07] working in you and the signs that he
[1:59:09] does you do also
[1:59:12] now does everybody understand that
[1:59:15] he says you class
[1:59:17] it takes the holy spirit to be gods
[1:59:22] so if you want to be a part of that
[1:59:24] ownership it takes the holy spirit to be
[1:59:27] gods
[1:59:29] and this is in 10 virgins
[1:59:32] amen we're getting there
[1:59:36] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:59:40] now
[1:59:41] in this message really it's to identify
[1:59:43] the bride
[1:59:44] the bright body
[1:59:46] he says his body will do the works that
[1:59:48] he promised
[1:59:50] like in mark 16 and so forth his body
[1:59:52] was not held in the grave
[1:59:56] but it was recognized with him in the
[1:59:58] resurrection
[1:59:59] now in this message the prophet speaks
[2:00:00] about when he was lying in the tomb
[2:00:04] he saw went down to hell to preach to
[2:00:06] the to the to the lost
[2:00:09] and his body was a representation of his
[2:00:14] bright body
[2:00:15] he says if that body was recognized with
[2:00:18] him in the resurrection
[2:00:20] then he turns around and he says then
[2:00:22] the
[2:00:22] the body of his believing children will
[2:00:26] not be held in the grave when he comes
[2:00:30] why because they will be recognized with
[2:00:32] him
[2:00:33] so in other words his bride body of his
[2:00:35] believing children the very same way
[2:00:37] that that body was a representation
[2:00:41] and that body was raised
[2:00:43] when he came up
[2:00:45] he says then all of those believing
[2:00:47] children
[2:00:48] that had died in christ
[2:00:51] his bride body that was represented
[2:00:53] through the church ages
[2:00:55] he says they come up
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:58] because they are represented with him in
[2:01:00] the resurrection when he comes
[2:01:04] and he says it's for that purpose that
[2:01:05] he went to go and die so he died so that
[2:01:08] he can resurrect his bride
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:15] so his body is recognized with him why
[2:01:18] because
[2:01:19] the body is is the word because she was
[2:01:22] made from him
[2:01:24] flesh of his flesh word of his word
[2:01:26] spirit of his spirit
[2:01:29] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[2:01:30] says now do you see the seals
[2:01:34] when he's in his meritorial work back
[2:01:36] there
[2:01:37] redeeming
[2:01:39] but someday he's coming forth to get
[2:01:41] this book
[2:01:42] that is redeemed
[2:01:44] so in other words in revelations 5 he
[2:01:45] went to go and take the book
[2:01:49] so he does his editorial work
[2:01:51] but there's a day coming that is coming
[2:01:53] to come and receiver
[2:01:56] he says and all that's in this book
[2:01:58] would be him
[2:02:00] so in other words she is him the names
[2:02:02] that was in the book is him
[2:02:04] for that's the believer the words in the
[2:02:07] book and the word is him and all that's
[2:02:10] in that he come forth for this book of
[2:02:12] redemption whose names are written on
[2:02:15] the book before the foundation of the
[2:02:16] world when you are slain as a lamb
[2:02:21] now as long as them names have not been
[2:02:23] manifested on the earth he stays
[2:02:27] at the intercessory
[2:02:29] so in other words if you or if there's
[2:02:32] an elected seed
[2:02:33] that was not yet made manifest on the
[2:02:35] earth
[2:02:38] he stays there for that name because
[2:02:40] that name was in the book
[2:02:42] [Music]
[2:02:44] he'll stay there because that is the
[2:02:46] reason why he died it was for god and
[2:02:49] all day he stays there for those that
[2:02:52] god had ordained to eternal life
[2:03:03] invisible union
[2:03:05] now your name is now in the new book
[2:03:08] he says it's not the book of life but
[2:03:10] the lamb's book of life
[2:03:12] he says it's what the lamb redeemed not
[2:03:14] the old book of your natural union
[2:03:17] he says but you're new
[2:03:20] and then he just says pride
[2:03:22] then he turns around and he says your
[2:03:24] new life
[2:03:25] is in
[2:03:26] the lamb's book of life
[2:03:30] then he turns around and he says your
[2:03:32] marriage certificate
[2:03:38] that's your marriage certificate
[2:03:52] [Applause]
[2:03:54] beautiful so the lamb's book of life is
[2:03:57] my marriage certificate
[2:03:59] to show that i'm married to the
[2:04:00] bridegroom
[2:04:09] let's move on
[2:04:10] invisible union he says
[2:04:12] now you are the pure virtuous sinless
[2:04:14] bride of the son of the living god
[2:04:16] the prophet turns around in invisible
[2:04:18] union he says oh that spiritual union
[2:04:21] of christ and his church
[2:04:23] when the flesh is becoming word
[2:04:26] and the word is becoming flesh
[2:04:28] manifested and vindicated
[2:04:31] he says now we're nearing the coming of
[2:04:33] the lord jesus to be united with his
[2:04:35] church where the word becomes word
[2:04:38] why because she is a word bride
[2:04:43] and then when i want to move on to the
[2:04:44] coming of the lord
[2:04:47] now we know how the prophet preaches
[2:04:48] this he says the coming of the lord is a
[2:04:50] process
[2:04:53] and as we read the scripture in first
[2:04:54] thessalonians he says he comes in a
[2:04:56] shout voice and a trump
[2:04:58] and christ jesus christ himself does all
[2:05:01] three
[2:05:03] he says he had to send a shout message
[2:05:05] to get the people ready
[2:05:08] and with the shout message he came and
[2:05:11] he that brought back the person of jesus
[2:05:13] christ
[2:05:15] it was a son of man revealing the son of
[2:05:17] man but it was god himself that had come
[2:05:20] since 1963
[2:05:23] it was that angel the mighty angel
[2:05:26] that had come down himself the seventh
[2:05:28] seal himself had come down in that shout
[2:05:31] message
[2:05:32] and that was already the coming of the
[2:05:35] lord
[2:05:36] so we've been living in the coming of
[2:05:37] the lord
[2:05:38] [Applause]
[2:05:40] and that's been the process
[2:05:42] the prophet says as he descends
[2:05:46] he comes in a shout in a voice and a
[2:05:48] trumpet
[2:05:50] so he comes in a shout message
[2:05:53] he says the second part will be the
[2:05:55] voice of the resurrection
[2:05:57] the voice of the resurrection will be he
[2:06:00] himself
[2:06:01] in the bride
[2:06:03] that's the reason why she will be the
[2:06:06] final voice to the final age
[2:06:09] but she will be that under messenger why
[2:06:13] because the shout message had to come
[2:06:14] first become an identifier
[2:06:19] and then he himself steps into her
[2:06:22] as the voice of the resurrection
[2:06:26] then the third step is the trumpet of
[2:06:29] god he says to call israel to the feast
[2:06:31] of the trumpets and to call her to the
[2:06:33] marriage supper
[2:06:36] now do you see this coming
[2:06:39] he says and now we also understand the
[2:06:41] process of redemption
[2:06:44] which is linked into that why because he
[2:06:47] came to redeem
[2:06:48] and the second time he comes to receive
[2:06:51] and shout voice trump is in the
[2:06:53] receiving
[2:06:55] and the third time he's coming with her
[2:06:57] as king and queen
[2:07:01] now that's the process of his coming
[2:07:09] let's give lord and praise
[2:07:18] we're almost there
[2:07:20] now looking at this process the first
[2:07:22] thing he comes he comes in a shout out
[2:07:25] now what was the south he says it was
[2:07:27] the message that went forth
[2:07:30] that screamed out behold
[2:07:32] the bridegroom is coming
[2:07:34] rise
[2:07:35] trim your lamps
[2:07:37] he says then they all rose and tramly
[2:07:39] lambs but some found out that they had
[2:07:41] no oil
[2:07:42] and then it turns around it says but we
[2:07:44] are we are right now in lamp trimming
[2:07:47] time
[2:07:50] then the second process is talks about
[2:07:52] he says it is the voice of the
[2:07:54] resurrection
[2:07:55] now we know that the voice of the
[2:07:56] resurrection he says and the
[2:07:57] resurrection is the person of jesus
[2:07:59] christ and it's also an event
[2:08:02] he says but it's that same loud voice
[2:08:05] he says the same voice i've seen john 11
[2:08:08] 38
[2:08:09] and since john 11 38 it was jesus christ
[2:08:12] him stand in standing in the front of
[2:08:14] the grave of lazarus saying to martha
[2:08:17] roll away the stone
[2:08:19] and called lazarus from the dead
[2:08:22] he says now that very same voice will be
[2:08:25] failed in her
[2:08:27] to call the dead saints
[2:08:29] from the grave
[2:08:31] [Applause]
[2:08:36] so the first process is get the bride
[2:08:38] together
[2:08:39] the second thing is call up the dead
[2:08:42] he says and together they we're going to
[2:08:43] meet him in the air
[2:08:46] and in that is the body change
[2:08:49] to meet the lord
[2:08:50] in the a
[2:08:52] but it's only to a special lady
[2:08:58] we're almost there
[2:09:01] so the third process is the trumpet of
[2:09:03] god he says and we know that the the
[2:09:06] feast of trumpets is always to call the
[2:09:08] people to the feast
[2:09:11] and what is that now in in in feast of
[2:09:14] the trumpets he says that was always a
[2:09:15] sign for israel to come
[2:09:19] to the feast
[2:09:21] he says and that is we'll be calling the
[2:09:22] bride to the supper
[2:09:24] he says the the lamb supper with the
[2:09:27] bride
[2:09:28] so in other words the marriage has
[2:09:30] already taken place she's already been
[2:09:32] declared mrs jesus christ
[2:09:35] now she goes to the wedding supper
[2:09:37] of the lamb
[2:09:43] now his wife has made herself ready
[2:09:47] she's laid aside all things
[2:09:51] just like esther
[2:09:53] because esther was the only one that was
[2:09:55] chosen among all of the maidens
[2:09:58] but she chose to avail herself in a
[2:10:00] virtue only
[2:10:02] she laid aside all other things
[2:10:05] and that is why the king chose her
[2:10:10] he says and at that day the way paul had
[2:10:12] spoken
[2:10:14] he will crown
[2:10:16] he says it's a crown of glory
[2:10:18] with a crown of righteousness to crown
[2:10:21] his queen
[2:10:24] at that day
[2:10:26] now conflict between god and satan when
[2:10:28] esther was to be chosen to stand before
[2:10:31] the king she didn't adorn herself with
[2:10:34] all the things
[2:10:35] but she adorned herself with a sweet
[2:10:38] meek spirit
[2:10:40] he says that's what the bride is
[2:10:41] adorning herself with
[2:10:43] with all of the fruits of the spirit
[2:10:46] following it
[2:10:47] he says what she got she's assembling
[2:10:49] together in the fellowship of the word
[2:10:51] he says amen fellowship of the word
[2:10:53] that's right she's fellowshipping she's
[2:10:55] sitting together in heavenly places in
[2:10:56] christ jesus tonight
[2:10:59] in one accord in one place
[2:11:01] one spirit one mind one hope one god
[2:11:06] one
[2:11:07] purpose
[2:11:08] [Applause]
[2:11:10] and there's your type
[2:11:14] now even though they were all sanctified
[2:11:16] talking about the versions
[2:11:18] he says there was only five that was
[2:11:20] wise enough
[2:11:23] to have the wisdom of revelation
[2:11:26] to catch
[2:11:28] the door
[2:11:32] only five that was wise enough
[2:11:35] to have the wisdom of revelation to
[2:11:37] catch
[2:11:38] that open door
[2:11:41] he says see what was it to be filled
[2:11:45] with the spirit so in other words when
[2:11:47] the when the core went out
[2:11:50] she was wise enough to have that extra
[2:11:53] oil
[2:11:56] so that when the bridegroom came she was
[2:11:58] able to catch the open door
[2:12:01] now that's a quote in the philadelphia
[2:12:03] church age
[2:12:04] now we almost there
[2:12:07] then in a message perfect faith
[2:12:10] he says talking about this bride now
[2:12:13] you have to have substance faith
[2:12:16] to be
[2:12:19] or rather substance faith has to be in
[2:12:22] the bride
[2:12:24] for her to be bribed material
[2:12:27] and to get to her into a rapturing
[2:12:30] condition
[2:12:32] i'm reading the quote
[2:12:35] so when a man lives by faith and he
[2:12:36] walks by faith
[2:12:38] the prophet says i mean substance faith
[2:12:42] he is so isolated from the entire world
[2:12:45] and he becomes a new creature in christ
[2:12:49] he says there now you're getting into
[2:12:51] bright material
[2:12:54] see see
[2:12:55] you're getting into a rapturing
[2:12:57] condition now
[2:12:59] that means for each one of us
[2:13:02] not just the pastor
[2:13:04] the deacons the trustees
[2:13:06] he says that means for the laity
[2:13:08] every individual
[2:13:10] walks in the world with god alone
[2:13:15] god taking
[2:13:16] his rightful place
[2:13:18] in our hearts
[2:13:20] he says then you're baptized into the
[2:13:22] kingdom
[2:13:24] now he's giving the secret now
[2:13:27] he says there's nobody in there but you
[2:13:30] and god
[2:13:33] he gives the orders and you pack them
[2:13:35] out
[2:13:36] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[2:13:38] a doubt no way you walk right on if the
[2:13:41] lord says this
[2:13:43] there's nobody in the world that can
[2:13:45] talk you out of it
[2:13:47] in other words this is my husband
[2:13:50] nobody in the world is going to be able
[2:13:52] to talk me out of this
[2:13:55] he says you go right on just the same
[2:13:58] he says now you're coming into perfect
[2:14:02] faith
[2:14:03] a perfect
[2:14:05] perfection
[2:14:07] that cannot fail
[2:14:09] that faith never fails he says yes he
[2:14:12] was a mystic to them
[2:14:14] with his perfect faith and so it is now
[2:14:17] with those who have perfect faith are
[2:14:20] mystic to the others
[2:14:22] and he's talking about you now
[2:14:25] [Applause]
[2:14:27] so we're coming now to the perfection he
[2:14:30] says why because the people has to come
[2:14:32] to this
[2:14:33] in order
[2:14:35] to go into the rapture
[2:14:37] now he says
[2:14:40] the church has to come into a perfect
[2:14:42] raptured faith
[2:14:45] then in in perfect faith he says now
[2:14:47] that means a lot of shaving down for me
[2:14:51] and he says it means a lot for you he
[2:14:54] says but together we're gonna make it
[2:14:56] by the grace of god
[2:14:59] that's our lamp trimming time why
[2:15:01] because the prophet of our age
[2:15:03] under our messenger
[2:15:05] [Music]
[2:15:07] that said
[2:15:08] together
[2:15:09] we going to make it
[2:15:13] by the grace of god it will mean a lot
[2:15:14] of shaving down so in other words we all
[2:15:17] will need to trim our lamps why because
[2:15:19] we know the bridegroom is coming so it
[2:15:22] will take a lot of shaving down for me
[2:15:24] it will take a lot of shaving down for
[2:15:25] you
[2:15:26] but by the grace of god
[2:15:28] we're gonna make it by the grace of god
[2:15:32] he sent a message
[2:15:34] for you to catch that open door
[2:15:41] first seal he says now god help me
[2:15:43] tonight to show you
[2:15:44] that through this
[2:15:46] we are to receive a messenger that's
[2:15:48] going to tie up the loose ends
[2:15:52] you may rise to your feet i'm actually
[2:15:53] coming to a close
[2:15:56] the musicians can come
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:02] and this is where i want to strike
[2:16:04] rapturing faith
[2:16:11] god help me tonight to show you through
[2:16:13] here
[2:16:15] that we are to receive a messenger
[2:16:17] that's going to come and tie up the
[2:16:18] loose ends
[2:16:20] and is going to reveal the whole secret
[2:16:23] of god
[2:16:25] for what purpose
[2:16:27] is it come to reveal the whole secret of
[2:16:29] god
[2:16:30] you can play something
[2:16:33] he says it's for the rapturing of the
[2:16:35] church
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:37] then in first seal now in paragraph 75
[2:16:40] he says this
[2:16:41] [Music]
[2:16:42] and then there is coming forth seven
[2:16:44] mysterious thunders
[2:16:46] that's not even written at all
[2:16:50] and i believe
[2:16:52] now this is the prophet that spoke now
[2:16:54] remember we
[2:16:55] we preaching to the wise virgins
[2:16:59] because they
[2:17:00] they had a revelation of something that
[2:17:02] the others did not have
[2:17:04] they had wisdom of revelation to catch
[2:17:07] the open door
[2:17:08] but to have the extra will
[2:17:11] now he says i believe
[2:17:14] and this is the prophet that said this
[2:17:16] this is a quote
[2:17:18] it's no man's doctrine
[2:17:21] that through those seven thunders
[2:17:24] will be revealed in the last days in
[2:17:27] order
[2:17:28] to get the pride together for
[2:17:31] rapturing faith
[2:17:34] and if he's tied the thunders into
[2:17:36] rapturing faith
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:41] then we know what that extra oil was
[2:17:45] that those wise virgins had
[2:17:48] and that's the reason why the pastor has
[2:17:50] been preaching this
[2:17:51] inspiration all his life
[2:17:56] because we know what that extra oil is
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:18:03] in statue of a perfect man he says now
[2:18:05] if you embalm a man
[2:18:07] in other words you take the blood out of
[2:18:09] that man he is gone
[2:18:11] he says the only way to bring him back
[2:18:13] he says if you pour another blood into
[2:18:15] him
[2:18:17] now if you pour in the blood of jesus
[2:18:19] christ
[2:18:20] he says what will it bring
[2:18:21] it brings the faith of jesus christ
[2:18:25] it brings the virtue of jesus christ it
[2:18:28] brings the knowledge
[2:18:30] of jesus christ
[2:18:32] it brings the temperance
[2:18:34] of jesus christ
[2:18:36] it brings the patience of jesus christ
[2:18:39] it brings the godliness
[2:18:41] of jesus christ the brotherly kindness
[2:18:44] of jesus christ and then he says finally
[2:18:47] the love of god
[2:18:49] which
[2:18:50] is jesus christ
[2:18:53] the love of god at the top of the
[2:18:55] pyramid which is
[2:18:57] jesus christ
[2:18:59] now that's the oil
[2:19:02] that the wise ones
[2:19:04] had let's give the lord another praise
[2:19:07] [Music]
[2:19:09] [Applause]
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:17] there's absolutely no mistake
[2:19:20] there's absolutely no misunderstanding
[2:19:22] who she is
[2:19:25] because he sent the eliezer ministry
[2:19:29] to identify who she is
[2:19:32] she accepted
[2:19:36] when when rebecca was asked
[2:19:39] let the maiden speak for herself
[2:19:41] [Music]
[2:19:44] it didn't matter what mommy said it
[2:19:46] didn't matter what the uncle said
[2:19:49] elijah said what do you say
[2:19:53] she said i will
[2:19:55] go
[2:19:57] and as soon as she was on a road
[2:20:00] to meet isaac isaac metter halfway the
[2:20:03] prophet says in the field
[2:20:05] and how he recognized her was he
[2:20:07] recognized her
[2:20:09] by the dress
[2:20:10] the garments that he sent with eliza now
[2:20:14] the prophet says he says
[2:20:16] lord crown my ministry
[2:20:19] by allowing me
[2:20:22] this dispensational prophet eloisa
[2:20:25] ministry sent for this last age
[2:20:28] to dress your pride
[2:20:30] in the righteousness
[2:20:32] of your word
[2:20:34] and when he comes he recognizes
[2:20:37] that that's the gift that he sent with
[2:20:38] eliza
[2:20:40] and he recognizes that's my pride
[2:20:44] isaac ran out to the field he met in the
[2:20:46] middle
[2:20:47] he didn't meet her at home
[2:20:49] before he took her home he met her
[2:20:51] halfway in the field
[2:20:53] and that is what we're looking for to

[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:25] what shall i do with jesus call christ
[2:21:28] let me say something too
[2:21:30] this uniting time to see churches
[2:21:32] uniting
[2:21:33] nations uniting
[2:21:35] it's a uniting time of god and his bride
[2:21:39] too
[2:21:40] and i say this with reverence and
[2:21:42] respect
[2:21:44] i believe that the bride of christ is
[2:21:46] called
[2:21:48] i believe she is sealed
[2:21:50] in the kingdom of god
[2:21:52] i believe that the mechanics is
[2:21:55] there
[2:21:57] they're waiting for the dynamics
[2:22:00] that will take her off the earth
[2:22:02] into glory
[2:22:04] in the rapture
[2:22:06] i believe it with all my heart
[2:22:09] this is the prophet
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:11] he says yes sir we don't know how he's
[2:22:14] going to do it but he shall do it
[2:22:20] and we know how we typed the changing of
[2:22:22] sarah's body he says with that he says
[2:22:24] and that was it it was the word himself
[2:22:26] that formed
[2:22:28] a new person from the inside out
[2:22:31] to change
[2:22:33] to be able to receive the promised son
[2:22:38] perfect strand by perfect weakness
[2:22:41] come lord jesus
[2:22:43] catch away your church
[2:22:45] and if it be your will lord

[2:23:06] but show your power lord
[2:23:08] fill those vessels and shake this world
[2:23:10] like it's never been shook before

[2:23:34] amnesia

[2:23:39] that he chose
[2:23:41] among all of the maidens

[2:23:46] and when the bridegroom goal goes out
[2:23:50] behold the bridegroom comes
[2:23:52] he's coming for the one that he
[2:23:55] had chosen
[2:23:57] there is no misunderstandings about that
[2:24:01] they might laugh at like the rancher's
[2:24:03] son coming to the maiden
[2:24:06] they don't know when did he speak to you
[2:24:09] when did he propose to you
[2:24:12] he's coming for me they might not
[2:24:14] believe it
