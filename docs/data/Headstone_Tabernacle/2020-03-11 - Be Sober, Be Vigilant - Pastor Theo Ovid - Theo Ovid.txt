[Music] hallelujah [Music] amen superb su thanks for coming out tonight is so good to be here we want to turn the tree portion of Scripture tonight first one is of Exodus chapter 23 it was 22 23 the next scripture is from first Peter chapter 5 wanna read from with 8 to 9 the last scripture from first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 1 tonight so read an excerpt 23 from verse 20 be halt I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared the way of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him and if though Wilk shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the ammonites and the hittites and the perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites and I will cut them off 1st Peter chapter 8 universe 8 or 9 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world our last scripture from first Thessalonians chapter 5 reading from verse 1 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but he Bergeron are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a night as a teeth here all the churn of light and the churn of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night didn't be trunking a drunken in the night but let us wha of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and when helmet the hope of salvation for God had not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ may God bless his word you may be seated or praised I want to take a title from first Peter 5:8 be sober be vigilant that's the title tonight be sober be vigilant supposed to be serious vigilance is keeping careful watch for possible danger and difficulties not the happy-go-lucky anything goes no but be sober be vigilant you have to be watchful for your own soul o praise the name of the Lord we believe that all right looking forward to see what the Lord will do tonight and only amplify that full script I read first Peter 5:8 o 9 it says be well-balanced temperate super in mind be vigilant and cautious at all times for that enemy of yours the devil roams around like a roaring lion in fierce anger seeking someone to seize upon and devour withstand him be firm in faith against his onset rooted established strong a movable and determined knowing that the same identical sufferings are pointed to your Brotherhood the whole body of Christians throughout the world Oh hallelujah hallelujah the Prophet a devil is almost harmless unless he had have something to work in you remember those Devils that were cast out of Legion he said they want to do more mischievousness so they wanted to go into the hugs so Devils must have something to work in and somebody to work through and that's the way God does - he has to have us he is depending on us to work through us all glory to God so God is dependent on you he's looking to you really that or glory to God to powers and there are two kingdoms and do you know we have had wars after wars and rumors of wars but if the earth stands we love plenty more wars and do

greater than them leading them he hung the pillar fire above them for the understand there was a supernatural oversight over their lives over there coming out and going in so he tell them my angel will go before you or glory to obey his voice listen to him I am releasing supernatural in front of you to bring you to the land Hittites and their genocides and if you obey my voice your enemy will

Colossians 2 3 Paul was seen be wave lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of our bodily nice Colossians chapter 2 this eat all right I just take a look Colossians up to to see let's see what they say the amplified see to it that no one carries you off us spoil or make you yourself captive by so-called philosophy and intellectualism and then the seat which is idle fantasies fancies and plain nonsense following human traditions which is men's ideas of material rather than the spiritual world just crude notions following the rudimentary and elemental teaching of universe and disregarding the teachings of Christ the Messiah I know man was philosophically years ago they love the same thing the Prophet did not say the same as in their own way so we know how we didn't rain that we talked about corn we talked about fig we do not we we do ask no injury that so because every that we cut about so we say very tipsy because in that God given direct reference they see what they didn't understand these spoken word promises is das see the Lord so you don't need me to explain this and go down a philosophical world or talk about universal principles it's what kind of values do want the others you like and do unto you but you know that Hindu Muslim Buddha everybody knows there's not the gospel teaches if you looking at nice behavior when she's taking the belt inside a be the Modi temple the other one is the Messiah until equal to

he's got is a perverted power of God it's a provision of God's power everything season has debt is a polluted life a lie is a treatment schooled adultery is a righteous act misused everything the season has got is something that was perfect but it's a power so you can say he had no power it's a power but the polluted power so Satan dwells in the realm of pavilion whenever you find a provision perverted thoughts mind attitude and behavior it's satanic because that is where he realm when he dwells oh my / Gideon hallelujah and this is where Bromstad sin did not originate in it it originated in heaven and it was thrown down from heaven cast out to heaven to the earth and fell on human pinions then the battle from angels became human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself Satan come to destroy this and that is what his purpose was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in US and has been region ever since this great battle that started on it they had to be a mutual meeting place they had to be a play selected for the battle to begin and for the back of the range and the battleground beginner the human mind that is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because decisions are made from the mind the head it never start from some organization they never started in some mechanical affair oh my Oh glory to God something has to happen on the inside he says your mind accepts it the world it grasp it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the wood of God and that's the thing that but life in it it brings the life into your brother what takes place then the life come Tom's in that channeling to you the Word of God is manifested in you and that's why the Prophet said we're gonna play something he says when the invisible become visible then God is manifested so this battle of angels that has become human battle you will begin to see this war fear in the physical realm so when Jesus cast the devil out the people saw a supernatural power being defeated by the power of God when Jesus opened the blind eye that was Jesus uncovering blindness that belong to Satan and bring insight when Jesus brought Lazarus from the grave that was the power of God conquering debt ensuring that life is more powerful than dead and even though Satan could snatch that young girl and bring it the death Jesus could snatch it back or glory of God the man that was crippled he could tell the man Street now look
