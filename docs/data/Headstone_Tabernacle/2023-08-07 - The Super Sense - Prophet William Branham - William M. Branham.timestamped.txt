[16:57] just as they put the tape on Amen we're
[16:59] going to open up the precious word now
[17:01] okay okay
[17:04] as he reads the Bible and the 11th
[17:06] chapter just for a a short message
[17:10] being a little hoarse but
[17:13] I had a wonderful afternoon with
[17:16] Brethren and sisters
[17:17] and never got into almost six o'clock
[17:22] and I just run into the room and knelt
[17:25] down at the side of the bed at the
[17:26] bedroom and prayed for a few moments got
[17:29] up and picked up my Bible and
[17:31] started to read and I've seen a magazine
[17:34] laying there and I picked it up and it
[17:36] was wrote an apricot so I couldn't read
[17:39] that and sometimes in the reading you'll
[17:41] strike a word and that word becomes
[17:44] alive to you that's where a minister
[17:46] gets his his message just start reading
[17:49] reading the Bible something first thing
[17:52] you know you strike something then
[17:54] something adds to that something
[17:55] something adds to that something then
[17:57] underline it and just go to the pulpit
[18:00] and read it God will do the rest of it
[18:02] you'll take care of the rest
[18:04] now
[18:06] sometimes you get so carried away to you
[18:09] make little thoughts of what little
[18:11] notes of thoughts that you thought of
[18:12] sometimes in a meeting where you have to
[18:15] come quickly to the platform
[18:17] that is read over them little thoughts
[18:19] that you had made the Holy Spirit equip
[18:20] them to you again done that many at a
[18:23] time
[18:24] now Hebrews 11 let's read the first
[18:28] verse
[18:29] beginning and we'll read
[18:32] quite a few verses
[18:35] now Faith is the substance of things
[18:38] hoped for
[18:40] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[18:43] for by it the elders obtained a good
[18:46] report
[18:47] through faith we understand that the
[18:50] worlds were framed by the word of God
[18:55] so that things which are seen were not
[18:59] made of things which do appear
[19:02] isn't that rich
[19:05] let me read that third verse again
[19:07] listen closely
[19:09] through faith we understand that the
[19:12] worlds were framed by the word of God
[19:17] so the things which are seen were not
[19:22] made of things which do appear as a word
[19:25] of God
[19:27] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[19:30] excellent sacrifice than
[19:34] Cain
[19:35] by which he obtained witness that he was
[19:38] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[19:43] and by it being dead yet spake
[19:48] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[19:52] should not see dead
[19:54] and was not found because God translated
[19:57] him
[19:58] far before his translation he had a
[20:02] testimony that he pleased God
[20:06] 500 years of life too
[20:11] but without faith it is impossible to
[20:14] please him
[20:16] for he that cometh to God must believe
[20:19] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[20:24] those that diligently seek him
[20:28] by faith nor being warned of God of
[20:32] things not seen as yet
[20:34] moved with fear prepared an ark to the
[20:38] saving of his house
[20:41] by which he condemned the world and
[20:44] became heir of righteousness which is by
[20:49] which is by faith
[20:54] now let us pray just a moment and bow
[20:57] our heads
[21:02] Lord our most gracious God and Father
[21:09] we come now into thy presence again with
[21:14] Thanksgiving
[21:16] and not only are we now feeling that we
[21:20] are in thy presence because that we have
[21:23] bowed our heads to pray but we believe
[21:26] that we are constantly in thy presence
[21:32] because at the eyes of the Lord run to
[21:36] and fro through the Earth
[21:38] and you know all things
[21:42] and you know the thoughts of the heart
[21:46] therefore Lord the reason we bow our
[21:49] heads is to ask this petition
[21:52] that you would forgive us for all of our
[21:55] trespasses and transgressions against
[21:58] thee
[21:59] and that thy mercy once more would be
[22:02] extended to us in so much that you'd
[22:06] open our lips to speak and our ears to
[22:09] hear and if that word might become real
[22:12] to us tonight
[22:14] that these few verses that we have
[22:17] chosen to read might become a great help
[22:21] to every member of God
[22:23] a mythical body on the earth thus
[22:27] spiritual church the church of the
[22:30] firstborn
[22:32] that church that's been bought by the
[22:35] blood of Jesus
[22:37] that's been washed and has been
[22:39] Sanctified and will be presented to God
[22:43] that day without a blemish or a wrinkle
[22:49] how we thank thee to have faith to
[22:52] believe that we are partakers of this
[22:55] goodness of God through the
[22:57] righteousness and mercy of our Lord
[22:59] Jesus
[23:01] praying now that you'll heal all the
[23:04] sickness
[23:05] thanking you for touching that little
[23:07] girl
[23:08] just a few moments ago they ain't
[23:10] doubled in the room in there from pain
[23:14] see her walk out that little childlike
[23:17] faith and accepting you and your mercy
[23:22] and we thank thee for this and pray that
[23:25] you remember a sister Baker's little
[23:28] loved one over in Kentucky and the ones
[23:32] that brother Neville spoke of and oh God
[23:35] the innumerable Camp of the sick
[23:40] everywhere
[23:42] and especially Lord those that are
[23:45] unsaved and Know Thee not if they should
[23:48] die in their sins they cannot come where
[23:51] you are
[23:52] we pray that you'll give us witness and
[23:55] power bone is to speak the word and
[23:58] wisdom to know when to speak it
[24:01] and then speak to us when we have said
[24:04] enough
[24:06] that we might walk away and leave the
[24:08] people in the amazement wandering of the
[24:12] great Holy Spirit in his work
[24:14] Grant it Lord hear us now we pray in
[24:18] Jesus name we ask that amen
[24:25] I would like to speak just for a short
[24:28] time upon the subject of
[24:32] senses
[24:35] we are taught that the natural man has
[24:40] five senses and those five senses
[24:43] control his
[24:45] is
[24:47] or give God gave him these five senses
[24:50] to contact
[24:52] his Earthly home
[24:56] and those senses are known as see tastes
[25:00] feel smell here
[25:03] those five senses which are known to the
[25:06] Natural man
[25:09] and they are good
[25:12] and we cannot operate or live a normal
[25:17] life
[25:18] when one of these senses fail to act
[25:22] your sight hearing feelings smelling or
[25:25] tasting
[25:27] we cannot be normal without them
[25:30] there's something missing
[25:33] some potion of life that we cannot
[25:36] contact without that sense acting
[25:41] and they're good and they're useful
[25:44] and they were given to us by God
[25:49] gave those senses
[25:53] but they're given to you as a gift
[25:58] and it depends on how you watch you
[26:03] yield these senses to
[26:05] will be the way that your life is
[26:08] controlled
[26:10] the way you yield those five senses your
[26:14] what you see
[26:16] what you hear
[26:18] what you taste smell our field
[26:22] whatever those senses are yielded to
[26:26] they will dominate you
[26:30] and we are grateful to God that we have
[26:33] the five senses
[26:36] but
[26:37] by no means was these five senses given
[26:42] to you to guide you
[26:46] they were given to you for Earthly
[26:49] contact
[26:52] but there was giving you the Sixth Sense
[26:57] and that's Sixth Sense
[26:59] is belongs only to the Christian
[27:05] and you cannot have this Sixth Sense
[27:09] until you become a Christian
[27:14] is the only way that you could ever have
[27:17] any more than the five natural senses
[27:21] for the natural person
[27:24] but Sixth Sense is better known to the
[27:27] Christian as faith
[27:30] it's the one that governs and guides you
[27:35] and it is superior to all the other
[27:39] senses
[27:42] it's a superior
[27:44] to all of the senses the other five
[27:48] senses
[27:50] now I would not say that because that we
[27:54] receive the Sixth Sense
[27:57] that the five senses are no good no more
[28:01] yes they are
[28:03] those five senses were given to you by
[28:06] God
[28:07] and they are to be used
[28:10] but
[28:12] when the five senses
[28:15] act contrary to the word of God than
[28:19] they are lying
[28:24] Now The Sixth Sense cannot lie
[28:28] it's a super sense
[28:31] and that's what I want to speak about
[28:34] this morning I spoke on a super sign
[28:37] and tonight on a super sense
[28:42] and the super sense is the Holy Spirit
[28:47] the faith of God that dwells in you
[28:52] and if you let
[28:55] the five senses be yielded to The Sixth
[29:00] Sense it'll guide you and bring all the
[29:03] other five senses under control of that
[29:07] super sense
[29:09] for it's so far above the natural sense
[29:13] as a spiritual man is above the natural
[29:17] it's as far as high as the heavens is
[29:20] above the natural man and his five
[29:24] senses
[29:27] it makes you believe things that you
[29:30] cannot see
[29:31] it makes you act or you do not think the
[29:35] five senses would ever think about it
[29:39] the devil can get into these five senses
[29:42] and lie to you
[29:44] but he cannot touch that super sense
[29:49] that's far beyond his reach
[29:53] that come from God
[29:57] it's called faith
[30:01] faith is that great thing
[30:05] and
[30:08] the five senses does not control the
[30:11] sixth sense but the Sixth Sense controls
[30:14] the five senses
[30:16] the super sense
[30:18] controls the natural senses
[30:22] and the
[30:24] these five senses is see tasty of smell
[30:28] here and the supersense is something
[30:31] that will make you believe God's word
[30:33] well that's the only thing it'll speak
[30:35] about
[30:37] and it'll make you believe for things
[30:39] that you can't see tasty you'll smell it
[30:41] here
[30:43] because it'll take God's word
[30:46] and it will deliver that word to you and
[30:50] make you walk contrary to any other
[30:54] thing there is but God's word
[30:57] by faith Faith does it
[31:01] now
[31:03] in giving this illustration
[31:05] of the senses the natural man is born
[31:09] with these senses so they are nature
[31:12] given senses
[31:15] and that's really only thing he'll ever
[31:17] know about it in his intellectual
[31:20] thinking
[31:21] he can only think as the man
[31:24] you can see as a man
[31:26] he can understand as a man
[31:29] here is an end
[31:31] but when it becomes govern or
[31:35] regenerated
[31:37] or we would call it born again
[31:42] then that six Super sense takes a hold
[31:45] of him
[31:48] doing so that's super sense raises him
[31:53] up into a spot
[31:54] nowhere yes Faith to believe things that
[31:58] he could not hear things that he could
[32:00] not see understandings that he could not
[32:03] understand he believes in anyhow because
[32:05] he's governed by that Sixth Sense
[32:09] that super sense
[32:12] oh how marvelous it is
[32:16] to know it
[32:18] and to think how simple it is
[32:23] to believe it
[32:24] now you cannot believe it until you are
[32:27] regenerated
[32:30] the Bible said that no man can call
[32:32] Jesus a Christ only by the Holy Ghost
[32:36] we went through that this last week
[32:40] and it's been such a stumbling block
[32:42] especially to the Pentecostal believing
[32:45] people
[32:47] when they hear me say that Jesus said
[32:49] and Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my
[32:53] word and believeth on him it sent me has
[32:56] eternal life
[32:58] eternal life comes from God Alone
[33:03] and no man can say Jesus is the Christ
[33:06] only by the Holy Ghost
[33:08] you're only taking what somebody else
[33:11] said what you learned by intellectual
[33:14] what you learn by the natural five
[33:16] senses
[33:17] but when the Sixth Sense comes in the
[33:20] Holy Spirit it takes away all the
[33:23] reasonings of these six senses and five
[33:25] senses and lifts you up into that sixth
[33:28] sense to make you believe things that
[33:30] you can't eat taste do you smell
[33:32] anything
[33:34] does something to you
[33:36] then you can say Jesus is the Christ
[33:38] because you have witnessed it
[33:41] not what intellectual teaching has
[33:43] taught you but what you've experienced
[33:49] what is the sixth sense to do then
[33:51] brother Branham why did The Sixth Sense
[33:53] come
[33:54] The Sixth Sense come for this reason now
[33:58] six senses of Faith the super sins
[34:01] now
[34:03] get the Sixth Sense come for this reason
[34:06] only that was to make the five senses in
[34:10] you deny anything that's contrary to
[34:14] God's word
[34:16] that's what the sixth senses are
[34:19] the scripture speaks of casting down
[34:21] reasons
[34:23] the the fear five senses will you can
[34:27] reason well now why should this man why
[34:31] should but the Sixth Sense doesn't see
[34:34] that at all
[34:35] it's so far beyond it
[34:37] it's so much higher than it is
[34:41] until it don't even have any reasons at
[34:44] all with it we believe it
[34:48] far beyond anything that the five senses
[34:52] would have to say about it
[34:54] now
[34:56] get ready for a healing service
[34:59] see
[35:00] we believe it
[35:02] you walk for that Sixth Sense
[35:05] you talk for that Sixth Sense
[35:09] you live for that Sixth Sense
[35:13] God by that Sixth Sense and rise for
[35:16] that sixth sense that's super sense
[35:20] something that's in you that's different
[35:22] from what the natural man is
[35:24] the natural man only has these and
[35:27] they're all right if they can be brought
[35:29] in submission to The Sixth Sense
[35:33] if the natural mind says read the order
[35:35] of God and says that is the word of God
[35:37] is speaking the truth but if it reads it
[35:40] says it's not all the word of God or or
[35:42] it's uh was something it was one time
[35:45] but it isn't now then that Sixth Sense
[35:47] comes in and says he's the same
[35:49] yesterday today and forever
[35:51] man
[35:52] see that's the difference
[35:55] that's why that so many people fail to
[35:58] be healed
[36:00] they're trying to come with an
[36:04] intellectual conception
[36:06] they say oh I um I do this or I believe
[36:10] this and so forth but if that Sixth
[36:14] Sense is saying that
[36:15] then there's nothing you'll ever shake
[36:17] them from that Sixth Sense
[36:22] the Sixth Sense is come upon the human
[36:25] being to make them deny anything that's
[36:29] contrary to the word of God
[36:31] any symptom
[36:34] any sin is sent contrary to God's
[36:37] promise the sixth sense as it is now
[36:43] if the Christian that's born again
[36:47] and the first thing you know some
[36:48] Infidel unbeliever gets around to the
[36:51] Christian and said now look here there's
[36:54] no such a thing as that Holy Ghost
[36:55] you're just mistaken in that you're
[36:58] crazy if you believe such stuff as that
[37:01] there's no such a thing as it that
[37:03] success goes right straight to work
[37:07] let me show you in the Bible where you
[37:09] can't receive the Holy Ghost you see I
[37:12] can show you where the disciples are got
[37:14] it but uh but yeah well you say look at
[37:16] the sixth sense of point you always say
[37:18] but he said the promise isn't to you to
[37:20] your children well that meant their
[37:22] children there that didn't mean for you
[37:23] it isn't for you but that Sixth Sense
[37:25] knows better
[37:27] why it's already in you
[37:30] they've said it too late you've already
[37:32] received it
[37:37] people who talked that there is no such
[37:39] thing as the Holy Spirit don't know what
[37:41] they're talking about
[37:43] like a boy once beating an apple and was
[37:47] asked by the Infidel debating a meeting
[37:50] he said why do you want what do you want
[37:53] up here he said I want to ask you a
[37:54] question while he was eating the apple
[37:56] and enjoying it a very simple sort of a
[38:00] look like a delinquent person with the
[38:03] hair hanging in his face in one tooth
[38:05] out in front of an old dirty overhaul
[38:07] jacket on he said just one question I
[38:10] want to ask you
[38:12] the infidelity just said there is no
[38:14] such a thing as God it's all emotion
[38:18] there's nonsense to it is all it is
[38:21] and the boy said I want to ask you a
[38:23] question Mister is this apple sweet or
[38:25] sour
[38:27] is that a hard-on or I'm not eating it
[38:29] he said that's just what I thought walk
[38:31] right back
[38:33] no when you haven't tasted the Lord how
[38:37] do you know when you've never received
[38:39] the Holy Ghost whether he's real or
[38:40] whether he is not
[38:42] yeah how do you know where there's faith
[38:44] and power how do you know there's not
[38:47] giant unspeakable and full of Glory when
[38:49] you've never tasted to see it
[38:52] The Sixth Sense leads you to them
[38:55] The Sixth Sense declares that to you
[38:59] there's no intellectual Powers at all
[39:01] I'll ever bring that to you the
[39:03] intellectual Powers will reason and say
[39:04] well it's psychology it's something this
[39:07] way it's emotion with the people but
[39:09] when the Sixth Sense comes in it denies
[39:12] all of those things and moves a person
[39:14] straight into the bosoms of God
[39:18] either come into God must believe that
[39:20] he is and rewarder those that diligently
[39:23] seek him
[39:25] our faith by faith
[39:28] Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob
[39:32] all by faith
[39:34] it's a sixth sense
[39:36] that does it Sixth Sense denies all
[39:39] Simpsons all symptoms
[39:41] anything contrary to God's word any
[39:44] feeling emotion somebody say oh well I
[39:48] was prayed for but I just don't feel any
[39:51] better
[39:53] Sixth Sense would never stand still for
[39:56] that
[39:58] Sixth Sense and say it's a lot
[40:01] I feel better I'm getting well
[40:04] God said so that settles it up
[40:08] amen
[40:11] God said so
[40:13] Sixth Sense only feeds on the word of
[40:15] God that's super sense
[40:17] it's super above the senses it's a
[40:20] greater sense it's a faith it's a power
[40:24] that stairs and drives
[40:27] Hallelujah
[40:30] something that makes you do things that
[40:33] you never thought you would do
[40:35] it's the Sixth Sense the super Sansa
[40:39] you get prayed for it say you got I got
[40:42] a hand you get prayed for your
[40:43] hand
[40:44] you come up there and you believe in
[40:46] God's going to heal you the pastor prays
[40:48] for you you go back the old natural man
[40:51] will say this you don't feel any
[40:53] different in that hand you're no better
[40:55] than what she ever was but the Sixth
[40:57] Sense comes along and said that's a lie
[41:00] you've been prayed for that settles it
[41:04] amen
[41:06] amen like a woman to come to a meeting
[41:08] one time and she come to your meeting
[41:11] two of them they crossed the platform
[41:13] they'd seen the discernments
[41:15] them women were just
[41:18] just swallowed up they were both real
[41:21] Christians
[41:23] one come up in the spirit came and said
[41:26] you are suffering with a stomach trouble
[41:31] at her face lit up she said that's true
[41:35] ah and the Holy Spirit said to you and
[41:38] he said and it's an ulcer it's caused
[41:41] from a nervous condition you've been
[41:43] examined by a certain Doctrine he said
[41:46] that you could not have that I had to
[41:49] have an operation to have it cut out
[41:51] she said every word of that is the truth
[41:54] and then seen she's such a great
[41:56] believer that is that your name is Miss
[41:59] so and so you come from so and so in
[42:01] such and such a place he said that is
[42:04] the truth
[42:06] what was it the Sixth Sense catching it
[42:09] amen the sixth sense in the Holy Spirit
[42:12] was standing side by side
[42:14] the Holy Spirit was speaking The Sixth
[42:16] Sense for saying amen
[42:18] something has to
[42:24] happen when Martha
[42:26] run out to find Jesus
[42:30] I watch he said Lord what's the sixth
[42:33] sense
[42:34] if thou would have been here my brother
[42:36] would not have died
[42:38] but even now whatever you ask God God
[42:41] will give it to you
[42:43] there's the Sixth Sense
[42:46] Jesus pulled himself together and said I
[42:48] am the resurrection in life
[42:51] he that believeth in need though he
[42:53] worked dead yet shall he live
[42:58] whosoever live with them believeth in me
[42:59] shall never die believe us thou this
[43:03] what are you going to say reasoning
[43:04] there's a man laying on a dead and the
[43:06] worms is crawling through him
[43:09] but he's just got through saying he was
[43:11] the resurrection and the life
[43:14] that's God's word
[43:16] that's Sixth Sense beyond the doctor's
[43:19] care beyond the thoughts of scientific
[43:22] research they found
[43:24] final reasonings and pass them down what
[43:28] it's witnessing to God's word I am
[43:32] another will be I was I am now
[43:35] that direction in life
[43:38] amen
[43:40] he that believeth in me though he were
[43:42] dead
[43:43] yet he shall live in whosoever liveth
[43:45] and believeth in me shall never die
[43:47] leave a style of this he said you
[43:50] know Sixth Sense
[43:52] I believe that you are the Son of God
[43:55] that should come into the world
[43:59] my brother shall rise again
[44:03] home
[44:05] to the Grave they went
[44:08] them two together something had to
[44:11] happen
[44:12] that was a super sense with god-standing
[44:15] presence something had to take place
[44:19] the sense was super sense was God there
[44:22] was something telling Martha that
[44:25] she'd seen him she knowed him she didn't
[44:28] recognize him to be the very Messiah and
[44:31] she knows if she could only get to him
[44:34] if she could only get close to him and
[44:36] present the case
[44:38] yeah
[44:39] just hear one promise come from him
[44:42] that's all she wanted
[44:45] when he said I am the resurrection of
[44:47] life
[44:48] ye that believeth in me though he were
[44:50] dead that's all Martha wanted to hear
[44:53] oh she wanted because of sixth sense to
[44:56] Super sense her faith was moving her to
[44:59] confessing
[45:00] believing
[45:03] this woman when she left the platform it
[45:06] was thus saith the Lord
[45:08] go home and eat Jesus Christ makes you
[45:12] well
[45:14] she went home
[45:16] that night
[45:18] a friend of hers living in the
[45:20] neighborhood was third or fourth behind
[45:22] her she had a big knot on her neck
[45:27] and here she come all thrilled about
[45:30] their our neighbor was going to be
[45:33] healed that ulcer that had bothered her
[45:34] so much
[45:35] this is one of the hundreds of cases
[45:37] thousands of them
[45:39] and this thing not sticking out on her
[45:41] neck
[45:42] and she come up I said no one would have
[45:44] to discern that
[45:46] but you're happy about something you've
[45:49] been thrilled because that woman sitting
[45:51] over Yonder is a neighbor of yours
[45:54] Holy Spirit she thought how in the world
[45:57] could that man know that
[45:58] it has to be something to reveal it to
[46:01] him
[46:03] so when that was said
[46:05] he said you're thinking about your neck
[46:07] yes
[46:09] do you believe it'll leave I believe it
[46:11] she stepped with all my heart I said
[46:15] thus saith the Lord
[46:18] go home and you will receive your
[46:20] healing
[46:22] the natural man looked around and
[46:24] couldn't see no
[46:26] sign
[46:28] the woman with the ulcer went home and
[46:30] tried to eat in my she like to died
[46:34] all the natural man the natural sense of
[46:37] feeling
[46:38] still declared the officer there
[46:42] so after about a week or two had passed
[46:46] she went to the neighborhood through all
[46:48] of her people in the church testifying
[46:51] the Lord has healed me
[46:54] and they said are you eating now
[46:57] no not exactly everything I want but she
[47:00] said I'm already healed
[47:02] for biased Stripes I am healed
[47:07] no matter what well she's healed anyhow
[47:11] one morning the children had gone to
[47:13] school
[47:15] and she got real hungry she was standing
[47:18] washing the dishes by the window she
[47:20] came to the meeting another meeting
[47:22] about a year later
[47:23] and she was washing the dishes
[47:26] and when she first thing she felt a real
[47:29] funny feeling go over
[47:33] and she thought what was that
[47:35] felt like I wanted to scream
[47:39] and her husband had told her said honey
[47:41] you quit talking about that healing that
[47:45] because although he was a Christian said
[47:47] you're bringing a reproach upon the
[47:50] calls how
[47:54] has his word
[47:57] you'll bring a reproach if you don't
[47:59] testify
[48:02] that if you were healed you were healed
[48:04] she said that man stood and looked me in
[48:07] the eye and told me my conditions and
[48:10] the things that I had done and who I was
[48:12] and where I come from
[48:15] she said I hadn't been in the building
[48:16] 15 minutes when he come to the platform
[48:19] how in the world could this man know
[48:22] that I never saw him in my life and he
[48:25] told me thus saith the Lord
[48:30] you're healed and she said
[48:32] I'll believe it until I'm dead
[48:36] he said I don't believe it anyhow
[48:40] so her and her sister blow our friend
[48:43] had Covenant to God that they'd hold
[48:46] that faith that morning she felt real
[48:48] funny
[48:50] and a few minutes she got hungry
[48:53] so the children had left some oats in a
[48:55] plate a little dish and said oh it's
[48:59] always this burner up if anybody ever
[49:01] had an ulcer you know what it is so she
[49:04] reached down and took a couple of bites
[49:06] of those oats
[49:07] oh my she said I have to pay for it I
[49:10] suppose but one of these days I'll be
[49:12] all right but she noticed she was still
[49:15] hungry
[49:16] so she just finished up the dish
[49:19] she waited a few minutes
[49:21] see what happened nothing happened felt
[49:24] good still hungry she fried her a couple
[49:26] eggs and poured her a cup of coffee and
[49:28] got some toast and had her real Jubilee
[49:30] she just eat all she could eat
[49:33] you want to head washing the dishes and
[49:36] about a half hour later she was hungry
[49:38] again
[49:39] no ill effects she put on her little
[49:42] Bonnet and down the street she went into
[49:45] this neighbor's house and when she got
[49:46] there she heard she thought they'd been
[49:48] a death baby in a family they were
[49:50] screaming and shouting and walking
[49:52] around the woman had slept late that
[49:54] morning and got up
[49:56] looking for the goat that was on her
[49:59] neck and it had disappeared during the
[50:01] night
[50:01] [Applause]
[50:03] what was it
[50:06] God at work
[50:08] up here at tato Tabernacle when we had
[50:11] that meeting
[50:12] that crippled boy that come in there was
[50:14] prayed for
[50:16] many of us are deceiving
[50:20] they brought him back in that emergency
[50:22] room Billy led me to him
[50:24] they had him on a platform for three
[50:26] four nights or on the in the building he
[50:29] didn't get a prayer card so they put him
[50:30] in the emergency room I went in and
[50:32] prayed for him looked at him he said Mr
[50:35] Branham
[50:36] can you tell me some consolation I said
[50:39] yes sir son
[50:40] polio got you this way he said that's
[50:43] right I said your name is such and such
[50:45] and come from a certain place that's
[50:47] right he said he said what about my
[50:49] healing I said by his stripes you were
[50:52] healed
[50:54] yeah he went home testifying giving God
[50:57] praise
[50:58] and he brought such a reproach they
[51:00] claim in the neighborhood until one
[51:03] Sunday a group of ministers come in and
[51:04] sit down by him
[51:06] and said you must stop doing that
[51:10] you're bringing a reproach upon the
[51:12] calls and the young man sitting there
[51:14] said Mr if you were sitting where I am
[51:18] if you were in the chair that I'm
[51:21] sitting in you would try to rob me of
[51:24] the last hope I got in Christ
[51:27] that by his stripes I am healed and you
[51:32] know lord said that sitting there
[51:33] paralyzed
[51:36] hands body back and no more than he said
[51:40] that and out of the chair he went
[51:42] glorifying God
[51:46] his natural sense he said he'll sit
[51:49] there the doctor said he'll be there
[51:51] forever or as long as he lives but the
[51:54] sixth sense says by his strength I am
[51:58] healed
[51:59] and he wouldn't have nothing to do it's
[52:01] casting away everything contrary to what
[52:04] God said
[52:05] that's what the Sixth Sense is for
[52:09] old John Ryan
[52:11] not the r-y-n-r-h-y-n
[52:15] that was a blind beggar in Fort Wayne
[52:19] there where we went that day and he was
[52:22] prayed for in the meeting
[52:25] that was the night before the piano
[52:27] played the great position now he's near
[52:29] without anybody behind
[52:31] and when he was blind
[52:33] is Catholic by faith and he he stopped
[52:36] in the line and I looked at him and I
[52:38] said your name is so and so John Ryan
[52:41] yes you're a beggar on the corner you've
[52:44] been blind for years yes that's right
[52:46] you're Catholic by faith that's right I
[52:49] said thus saith the Lord you receive
[52:52] your healing
[52:54] said thank you sir I said thank the Lord
[52:57] he said but I can't see also that has
[52:59] nothing to do with it
[53:01] you are healed
[53:03] and he said he went down along the
[53:07] helped him off the platform the natural
[53:09] man couldn't see nothing
[53:11] they couldn't see no results from that
[53:13] at all
[53:14] well I said he's just as blind as he
[53:16] ever was
[53:17] so two of his friends brought him back
[53:19] and put him in the prayer line again and
[53:21] running through again hard let him pass
[53:23] through
[53:24] when he come back again he said mister
[53:26] you told me I was healed I said you told
[53:30] me you believe me
[53:33] he said I do believe you
[53:35] I have no reasons not to believe you
[53:38] said you've told me all things in my
[53:40] life
[53:42] and he said I don't know what to do said
[53:44] there was a woman back there testifying
[53:46] and she had a daughter a few minutes ago
[53:48] and it's gone away
[53:50] I said then if you believe me why are
[53:52] you questioning me I'm telling you the
[53:55] word of God
[53:56] he said what must I do sir knowing he
[53:59] was Catholic and had to have something
[54:00] physical and he could hold you I said
[54:03] just keep testifying by Stripes I
[54:06] remember you and giving praise
[54:09] the old man for the next two weeks or
[54:12] three he stood on the corner and he sold
[54:15] papers he would haul her extreme extreme
[54:18] praise the Lord and healed X3 X3 praise
[54:21] the Lord I'm Healed
[54:24] when he come back to the meeting the
[54:25] next night I couldn't hardly preach for
[54:27] him he'd raised another everybody keep
[54:29] quiet praise the Lord for healing me
[54:32] praise the Lord for healing me
[54:35] as a Catholic he didn't know how to take
[54:37] a hold of Faith but even though if he
[54:39] kept on saying it kept on kept on kept
[54:41] on until that Sixth Sense would go to
[54:44] work
[54:45] that's right
[54:47] praise the Lord for healing me

[55:09] or three weeks later from the meeting
[55:11] and that Barbara put him up in the chair
[55:13] and lathered his face and he said John

[55:44] the barber trying to catch him in the
[55:46] razor in his hand and down the street

[55:56] little Georgie Carter laying down you
[55:58] know what you all know some people share
[56:01] close
[56:02] laid there for nine years and eight
[56:04] months couldn't even nothing but pull a
[56:06] draw sheet from under
[56:08] from the kidneys and bowels
[56:10] she weighed some 35 pounds
[56:13] laying out at Middletown Indiana
[56:15] and our people belong to a church that
[56:18] when I went to hold a meeting there at
[56:19] the Milltown Baptist church and praying
[56:21] for the sick
[56:22] that church said of any member of this
[56:25] congregation attends that fanatic will
[56:28] excommunicate him and her father was a
[56:30] deacon
[56:32] but she got my little book called Jesus
[56:34] the same yesterday and forever
[56:36] brother Hall take me to her one
[56:38] afternoon her mother run out of the
[56:39] house wouldn't have nothing to do with
[56:41] it
[56:41] I went in prayed for her said well how
[56:43] about that nail girl
[56:45] she'd know about the vision I said that
[56:47] was a vision sister I can only pray you
[56:50] have faith the poor little thing had
[56:51] been taught against it a few days and
[56:54] then I was standing up there baptizing
[56:56] she was down there crying but she'd
[56:59] promised that she'd come and be
[57:00] re-baptized again in the name of Jesus
[57:02] Christ if God would only heal her
[57:04] there's your little old legs just about
[57:07] size of a broomstick
[57:09] they couldn't even put her on a bedpan
[57:11] her mother yet a young woman sit there
[57:13] broke with policy gray-headed from
[57:15] watching her daughter laying there dying
[57:18] the inches
[57:19] to work for the female glands and went
[57:21] all the way through her
[57:22] she weighed some 37 pounds I think it
[57:25] was they judged her
[57:26] couldn't raise her up how to put the
[57:28] bedpan on her had to pull her draw sheet
[57:30] from under a rubber one
[57:31] nine years and eight months should lay
[57:33] there not even able to raise her head to
[57:35] see a tree that was by the window one
[57:38] day spinning back up on top of the
[57:40] hillside at George writes
[57:42] the holy spirit said to me rise to your
[57:45] feet thou looking there's a light
[57:47] shining onto a dogwood tree said go over
[57:49] the way of Rights or go by the way of
[57:51] Carter's when I got there the Lord Jesus
[57:54] had showed her mother a sign that I was
[57:56] coming walked into that girl laying down
[58:00] that bed
[58:01] so weak that she couldn't even raise a
[58:04] sputumen cup her mother would hold it
[58:06] trying to spit in the speed him and cuff
[58:08] with the TV I said sister Georgie Jesus
[58:12] Christ the son of God let me honor in
[58:15] the wilderness about a half hour go and
[58:17] told me to cut my hands on you the saith
[58:20] the Lord stand on your feet
[58:22] The Sixth Sense went to work a power
[58:25] struck that girl for the first time in
[58:28] three years or nine years and and eight
[58:31] months she'd ever been on her feet
[58:32] jumped to her feet run into the yards
[58:34] and blessing the trees and the grass and
[58:37] everything and went in and set out the
[58:39] piano began to play there in the
[58:41] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[58:43] Emmanuel's veins
[58:45] why
[58:46] reasons were to cast down she couldn't
[58:48] do it I don't know now I'll never know
[58:52] only the power of God that held her up
[58:54] her legs wasn't that big around up here
[58:56] at the joints
[58:58] nothing I just like Broomsticks that's
[59:01] been some 12 years ago or 14 and today
[59:05] she's strong and healthy going for the
[59:08] Lord Jesus what was it the first time
[59:11] there wasn't nothing seemed to happen
[59:13] but reasoning would have said it
[59:15] couldn't happen but brother she held on
[59:17] to that word if God could take that
[59:19] triple girl at that Salem that nail
[59:21] girly be crippled and paralyze her arms

[1:01:45] different but he believed that he held
[1:01:47] on to it there was no difference seemed
[1:01:49] like a day past no difference the second
[1:01:51] day no difference about the third day it
[1:01:54] started and here he is a living today
[1:01:56] after years and years
[1:01:58] yeah man noticed sitting right here miss
[1:02:00] Weaver but I'm not mistaken when her
[1:02:03] daughter came after helium Margie Morgan
[1:02:05] I went down there and there wasn't
[1:02:07] nothing that woman could do should be
[1:02:09] dead within the next few hours
[1:02:11] they had a shot or two they could give
[1:02:13] her and that was all
[1:02:14] it had a female operation cancer rubbed
[1:02:17] through her spine they scattered it when
[1:02:19] they operated it there was nothing to do
[1:02:22] for the woman
[1:02:23] I want to talk to her about healing but
[1:02:25] she said sir you are a minister of the
[1:02:28] Lord God and I'm not
[1:02:31] that you would come into my house
[1:02:34] counting herself unworthy for a minister
[1:02:36] come she said I'll live the life I've
[1:02:38] danced and I've done things that I
[1:02:41] should not have done I've used bad
[1:02:43] language or whatever more she told me
[1:02:45] her sins and she said I'm not worthy of
[1:02:47] it a scene she was hitting the right
[1:02:49] line she'd have to get Christ in here
[1:02:52] before that six Super sense that ever go
[1:02:54] to work
[1:02:56] we knelt down I talked to her about
[1:02:58] though your sins be a Scarlet she gave
[1:03:01] her life to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:03:03] when she did she said oh oh I feel so
[1:03:07] different Something's Happened to me
[1:03:10] something's happened to me I want to
[1:03:12] shake hands with all of you just then I
[1:03:15] looked out and I seen her in a vision
[1:03:16] going back behind the house to a chicken
[1:03:18] coop I said Mrs Weaver the saith the
[1:03:22] Lord God you'll make a trip to that
[1:03:24] chicken coop and you'll live
[1:03:27] she couldn't go over the way she felt
[1:03:30] cancer eat her up she couldn't go before
[1:03:32] what the doctor said she was dying and
[1:03:35] that's been I guess 14 15 years ago Miss
[1:03:38] Weaver
[1:03:39] 14 years ago she staggered up to this
[1:03:43] Tabernacle when she simply didn't look
[1:03:45] like she's able to get out of the bed
[1:03:48] little old bony arms because she
[1:03:50] promised God she'd come and be baptized
[1:03:53] in the name of Jesus we picked her up
[1:03:55] out of the wheelchair almost there a
[1:03:57] chair took her down in the pool and
[1:03:58] baptized her in the name of Jesus and
[1:04:00] there she sets tonight look at her if
[1:04:03] you want to see a specie of hell wow
[1:04:06] casting down reasonings and scientific
[1:04:10] researches and everything else am I
[1:04:13] because the Sixth Sense went to work
[1:04:16] that's it
[1:04:18] look let me say this again just for a
[1:04:20] minute
[1:04:22] Jesus passed by a tree one time
[1:04:26] and it was a fig tree
[1:04:28] and he looked at the fig tree
[1:04:31] now please don't miss this
[1:04:35] he looked at the fig tree
[1:04:38] and there was no figs on it
[1:04:41] and he said
[1:04:42] he cursed the tree
[1:04:45] and said no man eat from thee
[1:04:48] the disciples looked around she looked
[1:04:51] like it always did
[1:04:52] an hour from that is still looked the
[1:04:55] same
[1:04:56] God never opened up the Earth and
[1:04:58] swallowed it up
[1:05:00] God never set a fork and lightning out
[1:05:03] of the skies and burned it to a charcoal
[1:05:04] he could have done it
[1:05:07] sure he could
[1:05:10] he never did those things
[1:05:14] what did happen the tree had been cursed
[1:05:19] the faith of God replaced against that
[1:05:22] tree's life
[1:05:23] there was nothing physical you could see
[1:05:25] but weighed down beneath the Earth
[1:05:29] down in the roots of the tree death was
[1:05:31] set in
[1:05:34] it had been cursed
[1:05:37] The Sixth Sense had come against it
[1:05:41] it had to die
[1:05:44] started dying from The Roots that's the
[1:05:47] same thing takes place with the cancer
[1:05:48] that's the same thing takes place with a
[1:05:51] tumor that's your pain take place with
[1:05:53] any disease
[1:05:55] finding that sixth sense of power of the
[1:05:58] Lord God raises up against it but Satan
[1:06:02] come out of there you might not see no
[1:06:05] physical condition happen right away but
[1:06:07] that Faith holds there just the same
[1:06:09] it's been cursed
[1:06:12] that Sixth Sense won't that super sense
[1:06:14] won't let it go it won't pay attention
[1:06:16] to how you feel how you look how you act
[1:06:19] it won't have one thing to do with it
[1:06:21] God's word's been applied
[1:06:24] The Sixth Sense takes a hold of it
[1:06:26] that's all she goes to work the cancer
[1:06:29] of the goodness adrenal away it dies
[1:06:32] from the roots and it's gone
[1:06:35] certainly
[1:06:37] by the same forceful Sixth Sense
[1:06:41] kingdoms has crumbled
[1:06:43] lap one wall against another
[1:06:48] about this Sixth Sense
[1:06:51] the Red Sea pushed back
[1:06:55] on a dry ground Made A Way
[1:06:58] for our children of God to escape on
[1:07:02] by this Sixth Sense Mighty Miracles has
[1:07:05] been performed the most powerful force
[1:07:08] that ever hit the Earth
[1:07:10] is that super sense
[1:07:13] call The Sixth Sense
[1:07:15] has nothing to do with this down here if
[1:07:17] this down here declares it it says Amen
[1:07:19] to it all right you're moving on but
[1:07:22] regardless of what this does bleed that
[1:07:25] there's where the power
[1:07:27] if you believe in your heart
[1:07:30] your fifth sense of thinking lays within
[1:07:33] your brain
[1:07:35] but your Sixth Sense lays in your heart
[1:07:39] you believe with your heart
[1:07:42] confession is made by the mouth
[1:07:45] you believe with your heart
[1:07:47] yes sir
[1:07:49] that sixth sense that powerful force
[1:07:53] was that sixth sense that raised Jesus
[1:07:55] Christ from the dead
[1:07:56] after you laid in the ground because he
[1:07:59] believed the word of God
[1:08:01] said destroy this body and I'll raise it
[1:08:04] up again on the third day where David
[1:08:06] said I'll not leave my Holy One see
[1:08:08] corruption neither will I leave his soul
[1:08:10] in hell
[1:08:12] is that super Saints
[1:08:14] cast down the reasonings of these senses
[1:08:17] believe the super Saints
[1:08:19] the sense of faith that Jesus Christ
[1:08:22] gives by that same sense God spoke when
[1:08:27] there was nothing
[1:08:29] what is that sense
[1:08:31] that supersense is God
[1:08:34] the faith of God
[1:08:37] in you
[1:08:38] the part of God that comes into you
[1:08:42] gives you the Super Saiyan
[1:08:44] but that same super sense God framed the
[1:08:48] world together with things which was not
[1:08:52] and did not appear he spoke his word and
[1:08:55] believed his word
[1:08:57] and a world shocked into existence
[1:09:01] Hallelujah
[1:09:04] The Sixth Sense the super sense
[1:09:08] oh God pour it out on me yeah man give
[1:09:12] it to me and everyone who needs it
[1:09:16] pour the sixth sense into me Lord I'm
[1:09:20] willing to surrender these five my own
[1:09:22] knowledge thoughts casting out all
[1:09:25] reasons Lord let Thy word be true in
[1:09:28] every man's Word of Life
[1:09:29] every reason you ever doubt be Cast Away
[1:09:32] and let me walk by the super sense
[1:09:36] the sense of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:39] don't you want that
[1:09:41] that's the thing that we want
[1:09:43] God bless you friends
[1:09:45] that's what you need
[1:09:47] that's super sensual ask for something
[1:09:51] and it knows
[1:09:53] that he'll give it it's persuaded for he
[1:09:58] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:10:00] is and a rewarder of those that
[1:10:02] diligently seek him
[1:10:04] if the sixth sense says God keeps his
[1:10:08] word I give myself to him I surrender
[1:10:11] all I got to him my sense says this will
[1:10:14] bring it to pass my faith in God's word
[1:10:16] then call anything else contrary to it
[1:10:18] as though it wasn't
[1:10:21] Abraham that God and God said you're
[1:10:24] going to have a baby by Sarah and him 75
[1:10:26] and her 65. Abraham called everything
[1:10:29] that wasn't God was contrary to that as
[1:10:32] though it wasn't
[1:10:33] he walked as if he seen God and he he
[1:10:37] believed he'd call anything that said
[1:10:39] that it wasn't any reasonings anything
[1:10:40] else that the doctor might have said
[1:10:42] well Abraham you're too old to do that
[1:10:44] that don't make a bit of difference what
[1:10:46] the doctor said what anybody else said
[1:10:48] what his own mind said what anything
[1:10:50] else said God was right
[1:10:53] stayed with it
[1:10:54] that's the Sixth Sense the super Sans
[1:10:59] God give it to me
[1:11:02] God let me have more of it
[1:11:04] to minister to his people is my prayer
[1:11:07] this morning when that mother brought
[1:11:09] that little red-headed baby standing
[1:11:11] here the tears running down our cheeks
[1:11:14] I said what's the matter sister
[1:11:16] you said brother Brandon it's got
[1:11:17] leukemia

[1:11:21] amen oh he's a very present help in a
[1:11:25] time of trouble
[1:11:26] you're not long gone
[1:11:29] billing I was going down the road
[1:11:30] driving
[1:11:32] some colored boys come down the road and
[1:11:34] they were driving past and they'd
[1:11:36] swiping the car and turned around and
[1:11:37] around and around and told boys all over
[1:11:39] the road and one little fellow was
[1:11:41] pinned under the car with his back
[1:11:43] leaning against the car
[1:11:46] the boy jumped out and started to raise
[1:11:47] it up and said oh please
[1:11:50] please Franken would you kill me you'll
[1:11:52] kill me
[1:11:54] and they said oh we got to get it off if
[1:11:56] he's catching a fire

[1:12:01] me to death don't do it don't do it

[1:12:08] he said no sir
[1:12:10] I said you better pray
[1:12:13] he said yes sir
[1:12:15] The Sixth Sense went to work
[1:12:18] walked right around behind the car and
[1:12:20] I'll never go to the Judgment but all of
[1:12:22] a sudden that car flicked over and was
[1:12:24] off of him and he jumped up and was all
[1:12:26] right what was it a present help in a
[1:12:29] time of trouble
[1:12:30] and God
[1:12:34] we were coming down from a young colored
[1:12:37] lady was driving a car in a Road New
[1:12:40] Plymouth about 400 miles on it she'd
[1:12:42] been driving a pretty good speed I've
[1:12:44] seen the car drove its crank past chap
[1:12:47] all the way into the tree but then I
[1:12:49] stopped them in a snowy slick road ahead
[1:12:52] of us but it was dry there and the girl
[1:12:54] that winds blowing so hard up in
[1:12:55] Minnesota thought it blowed the car off
[1:12:57] you remember Billy I run down there to
[1:13:00] her and there she's sitting there she
[1:13:01] said oh I'm dying I'm dying they'd call
[1:13:04] the endless animals come and they had a
[1:13:06] dead man laying in the back of the
[1:13:07] animals said I can't take her and so the
[1:13:10] farmer said well send somebody else
[1:13:11] quick the woman to dying I walked up
[1:13:14] there and I said lady just a minute she
[1:13:16] said oh don't touch me sir don't touch
[1:13:19] me in my back I said lady are you a

[1:30:23] thank you Jesus
[1:30:26] through the blood pressure
[1:30:32] Heavenly Father we we pause to read a
[1:30:35] word at this time I pray a blessed and
[1:30:37] simplified and inspired your hearts
[1:30:40] Jesus name amen
[1:30:44] verse 23 for I have received of the Lord
[1:30:47] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:30:50] for the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:30:53] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:30:57] and when he had given thanks broke it
[1:30:59] and said take eat this is my buddy which
[1:31:04] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:31:07] of me
[1:31:09] after the same manner also he took the
[1:31:11] cup when he had stopped to say
[1:31:14] this copies the New Testament in my
[1:31:16] blood
[1:31:17] this Duty as often as he drink it in
[1:31:19] remembrance of me
[1:31:21] for as often as you eat his bread and
[1:31:23] drink this cup he do show the Lord's
[1:31:26] death till he comes
[1:31:29] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:31:32] and drink this cup of the Lord unworldly
[1:31:34] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:31:37] the Lord
[1:31:37] let a man examine himself
[1:31:40] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:31:42] of that cup
[1:31:44] fajita eateth and drink it unworthily
[1:31:47] eateth and drink of damnation to himself

[1:32:06] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:32:09] to the world it's just bow our heads and
