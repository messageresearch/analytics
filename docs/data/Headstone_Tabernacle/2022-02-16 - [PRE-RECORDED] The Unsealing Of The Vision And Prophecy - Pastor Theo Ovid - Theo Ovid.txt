ask it amen so you continue to praying for us and uh i do have something that i want to share with you this morning so we understand uh we want to go into the word uh habakkuk chapter two reading one verse one two three revelation chapter ten reading from verse 8 to 11 and revelation chapter 22 reading from verse 7 to 12. i want to welcome each and every one of you here this morning in the blessed name of jesus i want to also welcome all those who are connected live with us over the internet i want to say welcome amen to this beautiful sunshiny day amen sunshine here our place is cool but we have that shine and real shininess god shining in your heart so let's read habakkuk chapter two i will stand up on my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see see what he will say unto me and shall i answ and answer when i am reproved and the lord answered and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie do it tarry wait for it because it will not it will surely come it will not tarry reading from revelation chapter 10 i want to read from verse 8. and the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again said go and take the little book which is open the hand of the angel which standeth upon the scene upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be my mouth sweetest honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey as soon as i'd eaten it my belly was bitter he said unto me though must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings represent chapter 22 reading from verse 7. behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sins of the prophecy of this book and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then said he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and are thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the saints of this book worship god he said unto me seal not the saiyans of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he doesn't just let him be unjust still he was just filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according and his work shall be let's bow our heads almighty god we thank you for your word and i pray dear god that you take me out of the way speak to our hearts may our lives be transformed by this word this morning made break upon us like a vision lord and inspiration granted father in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you may be seated this morning i have a title the unsealing of the vision and prophecy the unsealing of the vision and prophecy i have a taught inspiration making the vision plane something we shared last sunday i want to connect back to it god's behavior is his person what he is in his behavior declares his person and that's what you are in your behavior tells you what you are not what you say so much what not what you intend to be but what you are isn't that right so if god acted one time in a certain circumstance and that circumstance arise he has to act the same way because he's the same yesterday today and forever if god healed in a certain condition in time past he has to heal today because he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that oh blessed be the name of the lord praise this wonderful name hallelujah so therefore from a prophet like moses he said now first apostles and prophets teachers evangelists and pastors five spiritual officers in the church to set the church in order apostles prophets teachers pastors then the local congregation have nine spiritual gifts but these offices and places is the offices you hear from the apostle his ministry you hear from the prophet his ministry from the evangelist from the teacher from the pastor each has a separate ministry and their ministries is of god and god has set them in the church for a purpose so the ministries that god sets in the church is for a purpose now no to whatever you say what god sets not what man put himself in but what god says and what god says he says and he will vindicate what he says isn't that right now what was the holy ghost given for here what is to give unction to the preacher it's to give holiness to the group it's to set the church in order so in other words it's not man to set the church in order it's the holy spirit that's why the holy spirit was given to set the church in order give unction to the preacher give holiness to the group it is to unite us together with power it is to unite us together with broadly love what's the holy ghost given for to unite us man can't unite us the holy ghost was given to unite us isn't that right and watch is to unite us together with brotherly love i don't care if you're methodist baptist presbyterian catholic in all inner rain altering no rain it doesn't matter you you're united by brotherly love by the spirit of forgiveness i love you praise god you love me i forgive you you forgive me we forgive one another and the honey sticks to god we will always do something in the flesh to offend somebody upset somebody trap somebody whatever it is but because i could repent and say forgive me my brother you could repent forgive me my sister and whatever it is we could forgive one another and we could be free isn't that right that is what the holy ghost was given for because all have sinned and come short of the glory of god there is none righteous no not one so you can't have anything to boast about you always have something that you could confess and repent about could we give the lord some praises this morning oh we're in church this morning hallelujah glory so whatever you are we have all been by one holy spirit baptized into one body and become members of the body of jesus christ it's glorious thing to become a member of the body of jesus christ once you're in that body nobody can pull you out you're in his body you are part of him oh glory to god he can't move without you or glory wherever he moves you're moving also you are in him you are part of him isn't that right could you get tangled up for that this morning oh are you ready for the word this morning now notice when judas fell the apostles handpicked by jesus chose matthias to replace judas but the pillar of fire choose paul who was not even amongst their group one was man's chosen the other was god's chosen by pillar of fire and god has promised to take the church or return the church to her homeland which is back to pentecost the holy spirit was sent to take the people back to the word and the angel is on the earth to do just that to take the people back to the world because god could only vindicate the word the angel's manifestation which is the holy spirit coming into the church through the voice of the archangel to make the prophetic vision plain superbanam against organization organized religion he said the church rejected christ the only church is we have christ on the outside knocking trying to get in and this angel's message messenger from god was echoing his message on the earth to come out of babylon the holy spirit today here we go the manifestation of the holy spirit the holy spirit come in all kind of manifestation but he's speaking about a specific move the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word not back to church back to the world millions going to church this sunday morning but that's not what we are talking about we are talking about where you want to line up with the word oh hallelujah cause the reason why the holy spirit will only vindicate the word it can't vindicate dogmas there is no life in them this is what we're standing for and that is what we believe but what did the word say hallelujah because god going to confirm his word so if you have your his word in you he will confirm you could we give the lord a shout so he said the church the real believer he's oh let me back up a little bit he said now some great theologian might come to the city that maybe had a lot of education could speak their words really good and plain and perhaps every church in the city would fully cooperate it would be a kind of honor to go out and hear the man which might be a marvelous speaker but that's not what the church is looking for the church isn't looking for marvelous speakers he said the church the real believer here we go it's looking for the manifestation of the holy spirit something moving in their heart oh glory to god not your head your heart isn't that right back to the word back to the principles that was laid out in the alpha church notice the purpose of god said in malachi 4 our elijah a 20th century prophet is to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers it's not just a modern thing will be modern times no they had something that we had to go and connect back with he didn't say god send you elijah to move you forward you can't move forward until you go backward and pick up what they had because they had the faith [Applause] and you need the faith to connect with the power and then the power and lead to the promise to manifest the promise oh could we give the lord some praises people you know we see that no fear come by what hearing the word therefore the word are to be preached and the word preached correctly rightly divided will bring faith to the people and the faith in the people will pull down what the power of the living god that's why you can drop the promise you shall receive power after the holy ghost come upon you glory so god sent the purpose of elijah was sent eternal hearts back to the fate of the fathers the fate the resurrection fate the original fate it will take faith based on forgiveness to receive the power that is promised faith is the leaders the power power is to take us to the promise to manifest the promise first thessalonians 4 16 the lord himself descends of heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel are with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air jesus does all three the shout the voice the trump jesus did the shout in true and by the prophet of malachi 4 bringing the bread the word the message hallelujah jesus already did that hallelujah elias has already come and a message went out throughout the whole earth to get the seeds predestinated seats a dragnet was thrown out a big fishing net was thrown out an income to elect along with crabs snakes worms turtles and whatever else but amidst all of that there is an elect and the elect will not be deceived oh give the lord some praises people over here this shout message was sent out to get three kind of believers true believers amen make believers on unbelievers all got caught up in the net isn't that right here we go jesus did they shout in the prophet are you ready jesus is now doing the voice in the brain first to identify a fifo ministry divinely appointed to rightly divide the world this can only be done by the voice of the archangel this voice not the angel but the voice of the angel that voice will speak the word amen and remember the spirit the prophet and the pride will be saying the same thing amen oh glory from hebrews he said leaving let's go on to perfection oh my i wish i had the voice of an archangel now to bring this to a place where you could see it so in other words the voice of the archangel is to bring clarity of the vision that came even the prophetic vision and that's why habakkuk says write division and make it plain so the voice of the archangel is to bring it to a place where you could see what you are promised and no demon could rub you or cheat you out of what you are going after [Applause] i'll bring it down further if an earthquake hit trinidad and this church falls flat you supposed to have a vision in your soul as to what you going after if this place is divided up into 50 pieces and we cannot have church like we know church on your little piece of island you supposed to have a vision if you don't have that you may as well prepare your tribulation backpack how to survive this tribulation for three and a half years you gotta get a book in a manual called that now they get a backpack because this is what we're talking about this is real gospel this is going back to the days of the apostles yeah they were hiding in the upper room there wasn't out open just waving their hands no they were hiding for fear of the what was going on around they were hiding from the authorities waiting on their promise yes they were in tribulation time they were under pressure but they was on the promise under pressure and on the promise under pressure and on the promise under stress under pension on the bills to pay but on the promise all the same it is wonderful to be under a promise of god how how many in here know that they are under a promise of god [Applause] i am not talking about your failures and your shortcomings and your wickedness and your attitude i'm not talking about that i'm talking about a promise of god you didn't ask for the promise he gave the promise [Applause] he he didn't even i promise in the last days it shall come to pass i will pour out my spirit and don't [Applause] that's why albacore said the vision is from a point of time oh don't get worried don't get fed up don't get frustrated don't act yeah yeah don't act miserable don't lack that god is not in charge and god is under control he give a promise be satisfied but the promise of god and worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy and if you take the book my god praise if you take the book and you eat the book you're gonna prophesy from the book [Applause] glory the book the book will empower you to prophesy some of you not eating a book i know because there's no bitterness in the belly the eating of the book have a result the eating of the book have an effect you don't eat the book and say eating nice it's honey in the mouth it's honey to talk about it it's hard to speak it it's only to share it it's honey to fellowship about it but when it go down in the belly when it got down to the part that got seeped when you have to stand and said no gossiping when you have to sign and say come on the phone with that foolishness when you have to stand and face those ministers to their face come on now your friends [Applause] when you have to take a stand with your family with your loved ones with your husband with your wife with your children with your neighbor with the pastor with the elder with a deacon with so-called bishop with poops and potentials and would-be apostles when you have to take his time with all of them it's peter in the belly but if john who typed the pride he took the book he eat the pork and it was sweet in the mouth it was spit in the belly and the voice said though must prophesy again and the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of jesus so when you prophesy under the spirit of prophecy it's the voice of the archangel anoint him to produce the testimony of jesus let them laugh but the testimony of jesus is prophesying that the word will be fulfilled in your life oh give the lord some praise people [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory praise god hallelujah blessed be the lord jesus told his disciples he that receiveth you receives me and he that receives me receive him that sent me and the prophet said in spoken word you can only serve god as you do and believe the servants that god sends you can only serve god on earth as god's servants that send on earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you so in other words god going to have to raise up men that will have to correctly divide the world not by intellectual study and so forth but by divine watch that word divine divine means there is no uh facts about it there is no emails about it there is no discussion about it divine is just that divine divinely revealed inspired from heaven how many know their sons and daughters of god [Applause] how many know you have a father and if you want to talk to you he could talk to you he he don't have to talk to you talk to a pastor uh he don't have to talk to you to a bishop you don't need a priest for him to tell the priest something to tell you he reveals to whomsoever he will that that is enough to make a baptist shout out divinely reveal so the promise of the voice of the archangel is here in the form of the spirit of prophecy to prophesy from the open book two things happen before dynamics is poured out two main things luke 24 27 and beginning at moses on all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself in other words jesus unlocked the word or opened the word or brought a turtle to reveal the word to his elect this was a private opening it wasn't on the mountain it wasn't with the five thousand with eaten bread eaten five thousand it wasn't with the seven thousand bred looking people it was private resurrection faith resurrection ministry the opening of the word to these elected people that was about to be have a promise because the vision had to be made plain to them as to what really unfolded from genesis come on home so the bible said begin at moses he began to break the scriptures to them and luke 24 45 then open he the understanding amen that they might understand the scriptures word open understanding open what's the sense god trying to show you something and you're blind first he open your eyes then he could say see oh hallelujah before the fish could swim he'd have to have sea to swim in so before god could bring to reveal to you you have to have the ability to receive a divine revelation and the pride the elect has the ability here we go to hear from god oh i want a bigger shout on that one i want to make a shout out on that one i want to make a shout on that one you don't have to wait for your husband you don't have to wait for your wife or the minister to elect us the ability to hear from god and once more the world will hear direct from god because the voice gonna be in a bride oh blessed be the lord hallelujah genesis 18 17 you may be seated and the lord said shall i hide from abraham the things which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a mighty and great nation and all the nation of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him and he will command his children and his household after him that they keep the way of the lord and to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abram that which was spoken to him what is this about abraham a of the earth abraham father of faith abraham son of god heir of the earth father of faith son of god heir of the earth father of faith a son of god and god can hold back from his son he was about to unveil the sick seal of judgment over sodom sodom was finished and didn't know it sarah was judged about to be sentenced and god began to break the seals into abraham and abraham's in judgment but abraham or he has family there so he wanted to see the seventh seal gonna drop down with names in it to call his family and he's been to beg god if there is 50. he begin to beg god if there is 25 will you destroy this wicked place if there is 50 oh righteous he said no not for 50 then what about 40 then what about teddy then what about 25 they couldn't find it judgment hanging over the earth judgment oh my hanging over the world and hear you sit call from under the seventh seal and some of you want to be stingy with your praise and some of you want to be easy with your voice and when john saw his name john said all under the heaven all all above the earth when you when you understand man [Applause] right now state by state america is legislating sodom and gomorrah judges say it is okay they will have to summon god and ask god to apologize to son among them if he's not going to judge them but if the god we serve is the same yesterday today and wherever there's a mister heading for america oh glory to god fire judgment but the bottom saw it he call it the vision before the coming of the lord ways of america bummed up all over you sit in church and you think we are only talking words but we are prophesying again because it will surely come to pass for the baby paul walking down los angeles and what a brand new where are you standing outside of me what's penny or jake macy oh penny store whatever jc penny and he said billy you won't be an old man until you see sharks swimming where you are standing he warned them to know right where you are standing you would live to see sharks swim in that place and always the judgment already set it's set for los angeles an adoption is set deliverance is set your breakthrough is set your healing is set your revival is set don't sit and watch at least [Applause] that's right my mom says love look at you desperate which which you're supposed to see the love of god because you're one in a million right now the the fighting isis the fighting this and that problem and that problem and everybody tense and russia and ukraine and whatnot and by the way i was to get it the plague has returned 44 people died i think it's madagascar philippines somewhere back there the plague that killed millions in the 14th century has come back terry the black plague yeah it has retained fleas coming off of rats and infecting people and they said the fleas are now resistant to spray so these are mutants fleas and what did the prophet said we are striving to enter the kingdom of god before this horrible plague strike now ebola is still wrong science is still a wrong hiv is still wrong cancer is still wrong and the play is coming one by one because i saw an angel full of the last plagues but the vial said come here i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife the angel having the plagues it is judgment about the strike the earth him that is filthy gonna be filthy still oh him that is righteous gonna be righteous still the judgment gonna distract the earth we didn't come here to be entertained you come here to hear the word of the lord you committed yet don't say the lord that is what you come here for [Applause] hallelujah praise god praise god praise the name of our lord hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory i feel the holy spirit here right now the holy spirit is upon the word [Applause] you sisters have to find your spirit in the word you have no scripture from a bullet woman you have none and bulls come in all forms long horn short horn obvious bull quiet bull symbol all kinds but the spirit is not right because god have a spirit for a woman and a spiritual man that's why he's separated in the beginning that's why all this homosexual foolishness is so against scripture and word and god god said man this way woman this way for a purpose [Applause] jesus will not marry no bullhead bride i will say it again the lord jesus sweet lord jesus our lord jesus hadn't some lord jesus none like him lord jesus he is not going to marry he will not say i do he said i don't and i won't oh growing up god say him and somebody do you take no i am not going to take that i wait too long for this his wife had lived his wife had made herself ready [Applause] in other words you may be seated divine revelation being made plain to you would give you the ability to make yourself ready the church member you had to work him up scream up wake him up dirty him up encourage him up hold him up shake his head up but the bride knows who she is she knows she is loved she knows she is chosen come on i feel religious now she know she is elected and the elected will be the perfected come on come on now the elected will be the perfected [Applause] something inside of you you know it could bring that excuse you know i was going to be bright but then you know i feel the cough and fight back and i become non-bright no no no that's what we're talking about we're talking about your desire to be like jesus in in every situation sometime you're talking to a wife and she want to talk about the husband talking to a husband he wants a body wife because he wants somebody to blame it's because she i am behaving so it because i he but no you have to begin to deal with you what about me and when you look in the mirror are you lining up with what god requires of you you see it appease the gray matter it makes you feel at peace when you meet you want to drink and you see other people drinking too when you drink you don't feel convicted because you have the boys with you so you know all the way that's why misery looks for company mystery you don't like to be alone no misery look for assistance help support fellowship counsel misery talking come come come amy let's fellowship my misery talking to you be careful about the invitations don't go and fellowship by misery become miserable drop the misery on you and then you come home miserable and your husband don't know what happened your wife don't know what happened you're cheering or you're all in a miserable atmosphere it's not the atmosphere of the world it's best to go and pray quietly somewhere it's better to stand up and praise tell them before you accept that i want to pray a little bit i want to ask the lord if i should go this way or go that way praise god because you want your footsteps to be order of the lord this is too late to just go anywhere you got to know how you're being led because as many as are led by the spirit and if there ever was an hour to be led by the spirit is this power because the devil is a liar he's a deceiver he's deceitful he wants to rob you of your joy rub you of your blessing rob you of your inheritance he is abandoned [Applause] and the police looking for him [Applause] the devil is abandoned wanted hallelujah looking for him oh hallelujah but i'm saying you'll see the philistines go to backing up when some adopted sons listen the devil no listen the devil know what he can he faced before you know he faced christ oh hallelujah without knowing fully who christ is because christ said i you know i am i'm jesus i'm the messiah i am this i am that look my card jesus gave the devil a call god jesus didn't do that he never tell him who he was he just said it is written it is written it is written because the word is unveiled to me it's revealed to him so he knows every one of the devil's tricks that is the only way he could really overcome to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks his main trick in this age is to get you off the wood [Music] [Applause] not catching not to blame us no not that easy you know the devil is out there but it's to keep you in church and take you off the wood tell you you could hate somebody and say about hallelujah glory hello [Music] you of the word you're miserable in your own house and you're playing nice and church oh yeah you're off the word you have to die you have to humble yourself you know what homework has to defer you have to give in you have to subject yourself you have to be submissive to christ [Applause] i can't say i wish i was a teacher you know my fine teacher very easy boy he could just teach you word and he he does have a burden for for nothing just teach the mysteries and teach break it down and the poor pastor comes here trying to teach something and you've got a thing this year until you say i was telling somebody that's a secret that's why i don't know some people lining up in front of my office trying to see me a lot of answers are answered by the word i gotta help by doing the preaching and so on you get ministered to so there's no need to line up from my office i want to see you see you for what you really have to want to see me yeah i have something serious because i trying to deal with this stuff your stuff spirit pick up your stuff whatever your stuff they're going through their people get invited to our service here and then they get vex afterwards they say they push to invite them tell the pastor about them i personally know who they are but the spirit pick up their stuff and when the holy spirit deals with their stuff they get messed up who don't like it too much but i can't help that there's something moving here that angel angels drop down because you see it's not about me it's about you that's where a lot of these ministers get tied up they think it's about them and their ministry like it's a power building bodybuilding contest or something and they're trying to display the ministry and stuff god are they choosing that foolishness couldn't pray that flesh business one god wanted some dead men because listen the fightful ministry is for your perfection not for the minister's glorification i i am the bishop is that right of what [Applause] you may be seated so the fightful ministry the preachers they are your they are supposed to be servants to bring the waiter to bring the trail ah and serve you one you supposed to take up the glass oh my jesus sent me that glass and and somebody get a plate and you get the food seven course menu this morning freshly picked hallelujah the pie is there the salad is there the rice is there the meat is there and they have a choice of turkey or chicken come on what put the one better than that or give the lord some praise as people oh hallelujah and when that menu is presented you have food for your soul something you're eating slow somebody eaten fast some of you looking for another plate god love the whole thing my people shall eat and be satisfied praise the name of the lord dead god my people shall never be ashamed glory glory hallelujah my god and if you know where you are it don't have fallen if you know where you are you have grain if you know where you are and have food or food and due season you have a reason to shout you have a reason to dance you have a reason to scream [Applause] from paradox but imam says we are promised according 10 malachi 4 that we have to come to ephesians to this where these 74 measure the word of god must be unfolded must be unfolded it's talking about seven thunders in the back of the book sinful mystery of the word of god has to be unfolded and i believe just as joshua before his ephesians raise up john the baptist raised up before the next ephesians we have promised another ephesians again he said no in the last days we are given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it say it again i'm going to say it again we are given an understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because there will come an efficient age to it in other words the word will remain clear and plain no more questions watch after jesus open it understanding open the world what happened after that they went in the upper room and they were praising them blessing god continually amen nobody got that left eh you can't go there again you know they can't hear that their minds are sealed their wound is sealed by the word that was revealed to them no other interpretation could come to them they were locked into a channel of the promise of dynamics he said behold i send the promise of my father my father my father sent a promise to you tarry in the city of jerusalem until until stay in the wood until stay still in your forehead until sealed by the word until [Applause] listen listen they were frightened that didn't change the promise they were scared mary was nervous they were trembling they couldn't get the normal drink they would normally get and eat the doors were locked they were not going out like that but they were waiting because god said so i will return unto thee according to the time of life at the same time at the appointed time they knew the hack was to wait and the bible said when the day of pentecost was fully come i like that word fully come not just come fully come they were in one mind they were in one accord and all of a sudden first there was a song oh there's a noise when god come in they have to have a noise got to have some kind of noise can't have this quiet sit-down you just yeah no we have to have a noise noise noise a shout a rumbling a roar a thunder voices [Applause] a song from a heavy muffler of a car outside no no no no no no no yeah that causes replenishing this song come from heaven hallelujah there ain't no money making that noise a heavenly noise and pillar of fire pillar fires had to cut up itself cut up itself just divide itself everybody get their portion man you ain't watching how much portion you get how much water do you get i can't flex with your portion no no no everybody you only have time with your porsche you you're liquor fire your liquor that's what you come to church for you come for yo who am i preaching to this morning you see you see you sit there wondering if i'm gonna get it i'm not worthy i i i'm not even sure i belong here and you're struggling the backslash did this god not talking about that he's talking about his promise he's talking about what he gonna give you oh hallelujah he's talking about his love to you if god had to talk about that talk he don't talk long time he fed up with man a long time he said i would i've angry at man that i've made look how we be even so sinful but then noah from grace somebody must find grace in the eyes of the lord your hollow is his blood that's why we're here this morning you know why i'm preaching this way is this blood i don't have no special something it's just blood blood dripping all over me when god look at me don't see my sins and feelings and shortcomings blood i am all bloodied up this morning what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me whole again oh precious is the flow that makes me fight the snow no other fault i know nothing but the blood of jesus and once there is blood there is presence glory glory [Applause] that's what abel brought abram brought alarm everybody blood came by the flowers of his own understanding and interpretation but abram border blood offering a blood sacrifice confirming that something must die for us to live and we have to be grateful to god oh hallelujah praise god amen remember see then remember for mauritian booker symbols as daniel hear the seven thunders and utter their voices remember daniel grabbed the pen started to write and john heard the same thing watch but on the backs of the bible the revelation was shown to daniel and say that there are seven voices to be uttered that no man could open no man know what it was but the bible said and told daniel told john in these last days these seven voices will be made known by the real true church you get it you can see where the falls and counterfeit is trying to keep great men from places like that so therefore to you the elect what's about to come forth you are going to understand it it will not fly over the heads of god elect the thing of it is this god was so mysterious that the people couldn't understand him or comprehend he was just too mysterious by the jerome and he wanted to reveal himself so it pushed god to the point where he became one of us to be touched to be handled and john beautifully said it this way in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us so god made it so plain not even a fool should owe therein no you cannot separate in the church the natural from the spiritual because they were ordained to be together isn't that right in the church bad good renegade rebellious but the elected is the full known of god chosen from the foundation of the world and here we go are you ready and vindicated by the process that he god in his wisdom takes them through i want to hear beginning on that one the elected is the full known of god and they are vindicated by the process that god in his wisdom takes them through by their place of trying wilderness testings trials whatever else to prove to these sons and daughters that they are not like eve [Music] example pillow fire hangover brown is a baby somebody take a camera clicks looks good but that pillow fire over that baby is a sign that that is elected predestinated for ordained gift to the earth now let's talk process you see people like the lights they like the picture they like posing with engine and lights and rain monsters all that is fine but let's talk about process you see this is the point a young man want to drive a car you see people driving i want to drive too but there's a process you have to get a license you have to be tested on the road if you don't get that you are illegally driving your father's car people want to get big jobs but they don't want to get the big results and the papers of the exams but to go and get this big job you have to get some big qualifications to get the big qualification you got to get some big studies and you have to pass these big exams then you can get this big job it is called the process there's also something called the process of character [Applause] development of course of course preach people don't like to talk about that god i'm going to bless you god i'm going to bless you oh yeah i feel blessed to be stressed oh yeah all kind of catchphrases and stuff god i'm gonna do with that channel like them inventing in your own mind god say abraham you are blessed abraham say oh i bless i have no children go say plain rude come outside let me show you the stars start the count ibrahim i wrote all the numbers he said social you'll see me now go back and worship god i'm not only latino holy promise and he don't tell them how long they look for and abram didn't even know he's 25 years old and you know what i've ever said here this beauty he staggered at the promise of god true unbelief but was strong come on now strong let me hear you give a shout you don't be seated better of it are you saying that the stronger i get in faith is the more i will get in praise of course of course because the day god gave you a promise every day is closer to it the problem the problem is when you don't have a promise that is pressure hallelujah that is pressure when you go over promise when you promise delivering inferior time moses coming 400 years of people in bondage and their money passing general suggestion from deliver coming deliverer coming somebody saying i'm tired of that you have to hit it again it's prophecy delivery is coming listen to the testimony of jesus spirit of prophecy moses is coming somebody coming you're saying that it's small you're a long beard you all know it's still coming [Applause] well a hundred years passed you said that away 300 more and after 150 250 150 more but what about when it's 375 280 295 five more years 391 399 nine months baby moses born nine months and delivered not mature yet not ready to speak no flies yet be able to deliver in baby form be deliver in in seed form god love this seating you know when you want to whip up the enemy just throw a seed [Applause] that's why when he broke the seven seal silence silence but only for half an hour because god won't be silent for too long the silence has to be broken and when the seed is seated silent it's all locked up waiting for rain if i could only get rain the seed is dry but he promised lot of rain it's all come to pass i'll pour out pour oh [Applause] and the devil job is to make sure he put the umbrella over your seed [Music] don't let that rain touch don't let that water touch that you know because every time that water hits your seed you're gonna have to break up you're gonna have to cry you're gonna start the ball you'll start to groan all the shell around you will break out you cannot be the same when the water of his mercy water of his blessing the water of his spirit [Applause] balaam you let me praise you a little bit when you praise and worship you are actually watering the seed so the devil job is to kill your praise [Applause] why you think sin is so important to the devil not just for you to sin you know you may be seated let me just say this here the devil know you are sons and daughters he can't deny that right but he could make you lose your joy of salvation and he could cut you off from your access right because if you get your messed up it comes like you lose your channel to approach your god so his job is to trick you trap you mess you up but when you come you're heavy why are my people heavy heavy leading booting down say praise god your hand how to do so i give you gotta take exercise to reach it up like that yeah and get the swinging mode because it can't go up normally come on no you can make it you can you can make it up you can make it happen you're not sure how long it will stay up because you can make it up that's not what god wants that's that kind of stingy praise when jesus come on that donkey you know when kings come in they have healed out and whatnot kings kings kings with the crown and all the village and the whole city come out when jesus come on the donkey that was their king the bible said you king come lowly he had no crown on him but that was the king and and they began to trouble branches that you rolled the carpet they were all worked after all they didn't have catholic they had branches and they dropped the branches on jesus king moving slowly on that donkey the king coming lonely according to scriptures [Applause] hallelujah what what a sight to behold when king herod coming big trumpet song bringing all kind of confetties falling all right continue showing up but this king different king different king now he's the king of kings the lord of lords not a white stallion all pumped up and so on a little donkey on sat no no jesus told him to find it not not any donkey there's a special one no man sat on that one before this is king king this is kingdom king and where are we going no other church went before where this pride is going oh hallelujah we shall reign on the air [Applause] i see the sense of empowerment when truth comes to you you could feel truth you could connect with truth you can't even explain anything and they they follow jesus and i mean they couldn't understand everything he's saying but he just said thou alone has the words of eternal life your words touch me your word redeem me your word reach me your word does something to me they knew it was god the word is god and that was god made flesh and blood among us the word itself oh hallelujah so god vindicates you by the process he takes it through god did not say because william branham you are my son pillar fire hang over your baby your therefore you're going to raise up a prophet all be well with you i will bless you multiply you the world will be smooth before you you'll have dust said the lord's son nobody will stand before you all the days of your life in jesus name amen now that sounds good but let's check the process and let's check the reality he lost his wife he lost his daughter that's part of the process he lost the anointing he didn't listen to god and obey god and god discipline him twenty percent saying amen they hear it with discipline but you know that is what the word disciple come from i thought you want to be a disciple a disciple is a disciplined one one that is following in order you want to be a disciple you have to become disciplined and god luckily god thankfully have no spoiled children we spoil our children we spoil all wise we spoil this one and that one but god don't have he have none of it he's straight not noah he straight god moses he said now joshua come on now he said now david and he will straighten you out amen i can tell you the ice cream pan it says soft boy i'll keep turning some more i'm gonna get hard hallelujah hey man amen i wanna hear a manly airmen but there's no chicken on nose hey man let me have a break in the house here man [Applause] jacob was doing fine ripping off this one ripping off that one he was feeling good with more flocks than ever more business than ever i just said i remember brother they come it's that man when he up he's go something they go to china and have services and so on you see so many chinese come and get baptized and they get baptized and they baptize looking for business if they have business in the west so they get baptized today and say it's a while and they recognize that they're working out they're gone their future is an opportunity to get more business looking for business people come with different objectives and motives god help me and my family in jesus name amen no that's fine you could pray that and god had mercy upon you because god not in that kind of private business god in his divine will divine purpose and you have to be interested in his kingdom in his plans that you could be part of it and feel part of it so when god went to find you he could find you god can't say oh go another call a bit there's nobody could find that this was troubled i want to trouble and he he plenty dropper so i'm not calling him at all this one here i could call he would listen so the spirit could drop on that one look at brother man i'm going to take a plane and the holy spirit tell him walk and he's walking he's walking he don't know when he's walking keep on walking turn left turn right you're walking down to a colored village you keep walking keep on walking he's led by the spirit spiritual walk he's walking you're asking the bishop should i walk down here i've never walked them before is there bandits down here is there robbers down here is there drug addicts wrong here he's not talking about that he's not using fear newspaper have breakprint people get killed in that street diamond with him the spirit tell him walk it doesn't matter if there's a lion in the street the spirit tell him walk when you walk alongside a woman outside in a banister morning person say oh you know i'm a person he said well i was praying for my son who was sick and i said lord i am your shunammite where is your elijah and god told me to wait out here i will send my elijah to you come on give the lord some praises people porter brown went in pray the man was healed and when he went back the plane was still there waiting for him god made sure he arranged everything that the plane whatever system whatever didn't get troubled should have gone reach it was ready to go god could stop planes god to stop the boss from giving this person the job and give you the job i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you we are talking about almighty god we talk about omnipotent god we talk about all-powerful god [Applause] and the neighbor giving you trouble god can make him go bankrupt unless somebody buy him out get off the pedestal line neighbor house god can move him too god has moved people to you know yeah man i read the scripture anthony and isabella isaac we're going to talk about breaking the arms of a pharaoh king of egypt i'm against spirit he said broke his arms one arm and he said how he bandages up he said he still had no strength in it but you know what i'm going to do tell him dustin i'll break both arms the weak one and the strong one that this sword will follow his hands he said i will put my sword in the hands of the king of babylon and he was stretched over the land of egypt you know why god told egypt how can i like you like a tree like a big bow one might the river you're so tall all the other trees envy you but because you get puffed up thinking because you're so tall and the others you are somebody and ghost i'm gonna cut you down because i made you beautiful god said i made you beautiful i put you by the river that is why you're so tall that is why you're so blessed stop complaining you see you can understand why am i going here you can understand why but imam says god looking for somebody the more he blesses is the more humble they become most of the time when people get blessed to get puffed up but god looking for a humble heart that was your humble heart i would not despise find me somebody that want to be nobody find me somebody that wanted me nothing find me somebody that want to come out of the way that god could be glorified [Applause] are we going to answer the question why would god choose a brightness evil age answer to try her [Music] i thought i heard a bigger than that i'm not begging for him and said the amends i am different i'll preach whether you say amen or not by just letting you know how your amen sung in god have a meeker up here temperature so there's no when i hit in this spot so if i got hit in it i will know i'm like a doctor then open them out and then read the temperature we call it the amen temperature temperature of which you confirm the word because when you say a man you say that that that's mine am i mean so be it to me i want it got something something so anointed something killing beer something getting lying something like anything beat them for instance one time they catch them in a city and they close the gate lock the gate up and say we have him now so i can take the gate and he posts i'm over with it not just the gate you know i like that baguette and post that means they kind of hung up a gate now they'll post hang it upon not to build pause and then pop gate something they bought because the spirit come upon him i went house and feel that anointed when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart i could run to a troop i could leap i could walk on the water when the spirit of the lord comes upon my heart some of your husbands need the spirit of the lord you're too dead in your house you need the spirit of the lord alex you need to be inspired that's a problem some of you are not inspired me to inspire inspire husbands inspired fathers inspired mothers inspired wives hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god people people packing their own inspiration and they figure that is god lord show me the old question to me yeah but in the big broad scope is it really god or if it's you cloudy with your own mind and thoughts and ideas we need to be free good jesus was free you know this didn't work up i like that and that is that is the joy of being authentic i find it's hard to be not yourself it's a difficult thing to impersonate you know you know he come and say hello you gotta do so and this one like blue so you wear a blue hat and when you're beating this one she's like pink so you switch your blue hair to pop a pink hat because they're what you like and you don't want to get vexed at her because she hates blue so you take out your blue heart and you go and meet miss pink and you know you conform yourself to everybody else afterwards you don't know who you are now you thought you were hurry no you john no you're acting like schmidt and you become friendship along with zechariah then you meet hanaya somewhere else and you're lost you're not yourself you have to wait for somebody to answer for you to answer too you do you you like that yeah i ain't sure you like it yeah i like it too not that that no revelation you either like it you don't like it you want it you don't want it you're free and who the man nobody the public stand up and shout you on the stand up everybody else sit down you're wearing a fusion it sounds good shout it feels good shout you want to stand up shout you backslidden and you are the shelf you could show pool glory glory oh i love this jesus gospel man oh jesus he's all right what do you think about jesus this morning he's all right he's all right oh hallelujah hallelujah oh i love freedom i love liberty i love to see people empowered yes i love this people are inspired [Music] there's some people are inspired cooks they could just take anything and make up a meal oh this just right and there's some people not so very inspired in the cooking area we're not going to touch that there's people are inspired musicians just touch the key and they know they're inspired touch the board touch the getter they're inspired there are some people who are inspired singers so as to hold the microphone and start you know there's a gift behind it there's some who they're better in poetry but they make a good effort but they try their very best but they are people that are inspired and so in in whatever there's an inspiration that connects to your life and in that anointing there's a faith that nobody could change and replace and that's why jesus ah his faith was based upon who he was not the anointing upon him and that's perfect faith when you come one with the inside when you're one with god one with the word when there's no conflict within you and your words are true and genuine you're not in hypocrisy you're not saying one thing with your lips and thinking one another god bless you and your mind saying i hate you if i could let you have it i'll let you have it but god bless you you're hearing about me and people houses and they may always breaking dishes they're always slipping out they made mad as hell and that's why i keep slipping out like that that's what automatically happened every time they watch something something breaking and they don't know why it's slippery it slipped out the slipper but he paid too small if they increased the pay i saw nothing i could break after that but the master mean so it lives out babies as a man thinking his heart two years it's what's inside of here your head's saying one thing heart seeing something just have to connect there's no disagreement then you're authentic you for real hallelujah hallelujah blind bartimaeus he was real he was authentic you're custom begging man always getting his stuff hunting like that it's quiet nothing moving nothing past and he said what's going on they said jesus on the other street so the crowd not passing here go wherever jesus is without the people passing yes have mercy upon me now son of david but he must cried out somebody say he can't hear you have mercy upon me now son of david you're praying too loud he still can't hear you but he must never bother with them he stayed on their street and jesus couldn't hear him with the voice you know what happened he threw faith behind it and faith hit heaven heaven hit jesus did you hear what i said his cry went up with fate knock heaven door and heaven hit jesus and move jesus like albert obama on the platform he'd be talking this way and just move somebody move him pillow fire moving he want to go with somebody move him that's what i'm talking about you could move the pillar of fire you could bring god to you yeah yeah yeah you could get what you have need of you could get that richer you could get that deliverance now watch jesus came to him ever moved him on your strange thing jesus asked him the blind man what is it you want me to do for you jesus knew he was blind you could see it but jesus wanted to hear from his mouth his desire he said lord i want to receive my sight that's what god wants from you you can't sit down mm-hmm no say what you want i want my daughter delivered yeah yeah i want the husband get some wisdom boom [Applause] i want my husband inspired he's not inspired he's fine lord no don't scream out here nowhere that no no we don't mean it too everybody going to know you okay we don't want that this morning not this morning please don't don't cry no doubt god is found in life they put but i'm saying jesus met that man and says what you want me to do young man what you want god do for you this morning what you want the spirit of god to do there's so much people going to churches have nice pastors have nice churches and groups but what is the lord doing for your life amen hallelujah do you want to be a better husband why not be a great husband do you want to be a better father why not be a great dad a great mom a great sister a great believer great worshiper why not be excellent in what you do daniel without without any help and assistance save god correctly can i bend they go without elders caretakers builders and so forth save god correctly why you can't serve god in your area correctly without people looking over you without people busting you why can't you get contact with the supernatural lord i love you i love you too much to feel you know i want to serve with all my heart hallelujah why can't it become a living testimony and so much it comes out of your mouth you tell your friends you tell your enemies you tell everybody you love god and you want us to win all your heart hallelujah help me love jesus help me serve jesus help me praise jesus help me glorify jesus oh he is worthy of all our praise oh my oh my oh my so we have to answer that question why would god choose a bride and it's evil age this is a rare evil age so on steve a woman plead guilty for killing six children six babies is an evil age it cannot condition it's horrible why would i want to be in the tribulation period getting a tribulation backpack could you imagine missing a rapture i'm trying to figure out how you're going to survive three and a half years you can't buy or sell except you take the mark of the beast and you know if you take the mark of the beast that's it oh hallelujah all dwell in the earth worshiping oh hallelujah everything is set you know the bombs are already set listen when they invented slingshot they use it bow and arrow they use it one bullet gun stuff it boom they use it one bullet at a time cannon fire boom they use it every weapon man made he has used it man you should see the kind of weapons that russia have and missile and bomb could destroy so much and they only belong more and improving now they have one that if it glyph off it it's selling six dummies and one is immediate one so you try to shoot it down you don't know which one you're shooting them that is how keen children reach very smart very intelligent we can't fight up with key insurance you can study how to make an underground bunker to protect you from these guys out there it makes no sense i'm not looking for on the bank i'm looking to go on the rapture and i know it will take rapture and faith i know it will take the life of jesus so theo have to die i'm not hearing you we have to die no excuse this have to live [Applause] and if god put your wife like moses on to be hot tempered that you could get tempers patience godliness are you any scissors anymore any brother's not saying anymore i hope that another confirmation that you know but but i'm talking about so i'm talking about whatever god put in order to hone your life for for to get his character and his nature because you see correcting as a gift that's why giving your children money doesn't help them it will just spend giving them car hall what not until you help them help them it's not helping them they have to go through that's why they get all the human because you're feeling sorry for them that is not god sarian that's not god's compassion god's compassion is doing the will of god sometimes they have to pain sometimes they have to strain you crack the egg of the chicken you will kill it you could smother your children with the wrong kind of a love hug them so tight they lose their breath and they die right in your arms because they love them so much that is not love that's foolishness actually because our example is not our appearance our example is god [Applause] the bible says love your wife as christ love your church not as your father love your mother okay if i didn't know everybody know they trouble so not using that as the example using the word as the example as christ loved the church so odd men to love their wives so what you have no excuse well i come to this and i come to that look at the bible look at the word that's how we're coming back to the word as christ loved the church and give himself for it [Applause] so mister you have to step up [Applause] and take responsibility oh my lord hallelujah where because we came from taught the flesh and bypass or tiopony we are here to reconnect to our theophany by way of the word do you believe that the seed the thought that we are in god could now be expressed because the word is sort of expressed and therefore by the word the forming of the word image this word back to the word the unveiling of god the word the revealing of the son of man was revealed in the word the land the promises these promises are the word the word is coming to you by way of the third pull which is the opening of the word the word truly have to open to you that you as an individual bride member could see your promises and your inheritance you've got to see it you have to go beyond salvation it's not good just to be saved you must want your inheritance because that is what jesus died for adam lost the book jesus died to pay the price to get back to book revelation 10 to book him on the earth version 10 8 the voice said take the book and eat it before there is a further manifestation that got to be the spirit of prophecy hallelujah and the prophecy must be upon you how could you prophesy over your own life and act negative how could you prophesy over your wife and don't have the expectation for the fulfillment in her life jesus when the report came man said lord my daughter is sick somebody come and say forget about it don't ask him again she's dead he said i go wake her hallelujah she wasn't awoke right away but jesus said i go to wake he comes walking the crowd is around him he said get them out get them out get them out just just bring a few elected believing people around me is the little girl rise up and walk give us something to eat and jesus walked out that was normal to him he has a dull little girl and also the drama he didn't don't need for that he was the world rise up and walk that's how you gonna become [Applause] so stop pretending stop acting you're angry you're angry be angry and sin not when you take your anger into a fight there's a different business you're angry you could let god cool the temper down anger down hastiness whatever it is that is where you get things to pray about and that's why god has turned up the heat sometime of tryouts because we're not broken enough yeah yeah we content satisfied you see and you think things looking kind of cool you're not all way away i want to be but it's so cool that usf get cool you're walking in a cocoon of coolness and goes to the people too cool hallelujah then god had to come and you're you in your big balloon and got them a nice pin then all the air come out your balloon and they said oh from that time from that day from this happened this happened that happened you start to hit the deck from that but god wants you to be like a man when he burst the cocoon he must say the lord give the lord take it away blessed be lord then god can lead over the air do you hear that do you hear my son talking no my son talking just like me he would know all things work together for good hallelujah hallelujah why i think joseph had such power to forgive his brothers he was delivered he was free he was fair right and man isn't that right he was the man handling all fear of business in egypt so he had no fights with his brethren he said brothers come close to me it is me your brother whom your soul [Applause] hallelujah but everything is all right brothers everything is fine we grow up now we mature now you understand the vision now vision was for a point in time you have to understand division is what put me where you didn't have that vision but god gave me that vision it was for a purpose to accomplish his will oh glory to god no brethren come and eat come and take in plenty come and camp and feed and choose his ban but not as bad as

powerful ministry ahead a powerful third-party ministry is ahead almighty a lot of stuff listen to this oh glory to god so what's something this word coming to you by way of the temple the only thing to call and pull the bride notice brahmana the first pull second pull through first pull signs and wonders and healing second pull prophecy to it for the opening of the word and that word being open is what called the brain the word watch being made plain by a fifo ministry under the anointing of the voice of the archangel will call a bride out of the shout to shout call three kind of believers but as we step to the next level as we go to the next phase an elected bunch going to be called out but call it a holy ghost bunch to be honed not everybody there's going to be a holy ghost bunch that is going to be honed out stones cut out by revelation because you have to be have a revelation to become a stone a rock that is what makes you a stone a rock confession divine revelation and when you

marital issues family issues is to be settled by the word not by emotions feelings what you think but what does the word speak about the matter oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah praise be to jesus you love him this morning hallelujah can you take a little more daniel 8 15 and it came to pass that i even daniels had seen the vision and sought for the meaning and behold they stood before me the appearance of a man and i heard a man's voice between the banks of ulai which called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision so he came near where i stood or when he came i was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of man for at the time of the end shall be division daniel 9 20 and while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presented my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god yeah while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i've seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about a time of the even oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh daniel i am now come forth to give these skill and understanding at the beginning of i suffocation the commandment came forth and i come to show thee for our greater beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision seventy weeks i determine upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression to make up end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness and this is the power i wanna get up here and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now but abraham and the sinful purpose of gabriel he was highlighting that part to seal up the vision and prophecy because the vision and prophecy was sealed but we have promised that that vision will be unsealed isn't that right because god told us to danielle go ahead danielle the book is sealed till the time of the end daniel 12 michael shall stand up the great prince notice watch and many of them that sleep in the dust of the eagle shall awake something everlasting life some to everlasting shame and contempt and those that turn away turn to many to righteousness as a stance forever but daniel o'donnell showed the words sealed the book even to the time of the end what is it do you see it class here we go this revelation of jesus christ and of his power there we go of his coming of the end time was sealed up until this time that is what he come to do it's hid from the scholars seal it up until the time of the end close up the words what did he do to seal up the vision and prophecy daniel had prophesied these things he saw it in a vision and the angel came down to seal the vision and to seal the prophecy that they can read it but cannot understand it until the end time oh could be here getting bigger what is the end time the end of the century week when the prince the antichrist will be revealed making himself god oh hallelujah so in other words this on ceiling the time is now but when the seven seal broke something was hidden under there you know what was under there you on the deal you were sealed on the deer you were hidden on the deer so therefore unsealing the vision and prophecy also means unsealing you oh glory to god to bring you out into a manifestation oh hallelujah as many as receive him to them give the power to become the sons of god so we're not coming back our sons saved sons salvation no our sonship is romans 8 the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god this is how adam was before the fall that means the book have to come back on the earth and the book came back god gave it to the prophet mighty angel seven thunders out in their voices oh hallelujah oh my god oh glory to god amen i'm saying if this is the third pearl then there's a great ministry line ahead first little birds then bigger birds than
