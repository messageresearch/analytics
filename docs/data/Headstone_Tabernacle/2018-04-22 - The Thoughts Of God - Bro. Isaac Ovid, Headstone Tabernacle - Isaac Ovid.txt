what a blessing when a ministry what an inspiration to us let me salute you hallelujah and after service today we'd have a celebration with him after the service so this morning I'd like to go straight to the word this morning thanking musicians appreciate a special as well thank you for the Anthony and reading from three portions of scripture reading from the book of Isaiah chapter 55 and reading from verse 6 reading Malachi 3 and reading from Hebrews 13 reading Isaiah 55 and verse 6 Sikhi the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the LORD for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain coming down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but water it and make it it bring foot and but that it may give see to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it and reading Malachi chapter 3 and reading of his six malachite up to three and reading verse six for I am the Lord and I change not and reading Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever middle or add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning amen and I have a title this morning the thoughts of God a subject I am Lord and I change not and an inspiration breaking the silence and I call it an a character Peter I want to touch on it a little bit this morning so the title of thoughts of God subject I am the Lord and I change not and inspiration breaking the silence and a character Peter and we read the scripture in Isaiah where God is saying for my thoughts and not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord and he makes a clear distinction about the way he thinks and the way that we think and we all have our thoughts we have our own thoughts about ourselves we have our thoughts about our ambitions we have our thoughts of what we'd like to do and what we would like to be and what we'd like to accomplish we have our thoughts and the economy we have our thoughts on what's happening in our neighborhood we have our thoughts with what's happening with our family we have our thoughts with what's happening with the economy we have our thoughts with everything and God also has his thoughts he has thoughts about nature the way nature should be here thoughts about how animals should operate he has thoughts about plant life he has thoughts about his family he has thoughts about his legacy he has thoughts about reproducing himself he has thoughts about how this world is how it was and how it will be here sports that are from the past what we call past present and future that's all in his thoughts and the challenges his thoughts are so far above our thoughts that just a glimpse into his world makes our world a different place because we are limited in our thinking we are limited in our efforts we are limited in our abilities if we stand on our own but when we stand on his word and we connect his thoughts it changes our existence completely so this morning I want to talk about the thoughts of God because before you can express a word you have to have thought it before you could speak it so before God could have said let there be light he had to have thought about the light before he could say led to be a son he had to think about the son and what the son would do and the role that it would play and before God could say let there be animals he had thoughts about the animals and before calkins here let us make man he had to have thoughts about that man and before God could put the garden of Weeden and please he had to have thoughts about what was supposed to happen and whenever God spoke it was the expression of his pots and when man tell God didn't stop thinking when you made a mistake or didn't stop thinking he is always thinking he has always been thinking and brother branham said his thoughts are eternal we could forget something that we thought about the Bible says that there was a king and he had a dream and he forgot his dream and he said listen I forgot the dream and but it was a troubling dream and he forgot about it he said I needed to remember the dream and give me the interpretation and if you cannot remember the dream and give me the interpretation I'm gonna cut your head off that's the nature of man we cannot remember everything we cannot keep everything in our minds but the mind of God is different he cannot forget his thoughts are eternal he cannot have thought about you and forgot that he thought about you he cannot have thought about calling you and forgot that he called you he cannot progestin ate you and forget that he did retest innate in you he cannot die for you and forgot who he died for because when he was walking to Calvary you were on his mind when he was being beaten by the whip you were on his mind you were his thinking and this morning you are the very expression of the thoughts of God everything you see around you is as a result of the expression of the thoughts of God the trees that you see an expression of the thoughts of God the animals you see are an expression of the thoughts of God if you ever want to wonder about if God is real just look up at the heavens look up at the stars look at the Sun look at the moon [Applause] the thoughts of God hallelujah and his thoughts I eternal his thoughts cannot be destroyed and once his thoughts become word it becomes permanent because he said for my word cannot return for it and it will accomplish that which I please there are certain things that please God and in order to bring it to pass up he has to live by his own law because he said I am God and I changed not so he cannot change he cannot know start to change if he called you and he spoke you into existence he cannot even change his mind so if God said you gonna be healed he cannot even change his mind and not only did he think it but he already spoke it he already spoke it he said I am the God that healeth thee he already spoke it somebody helped me this morning hallelujah somebody help me give God praise this morning Oh hallelujah you may be seated I pray this helps you this morning because sometimes you'll even thinking about yourself but when you're not thinking about yourself he's still thinking about you when you don't feel good about yourself he's still thinking about you Gideon was just minding his own business and he didn't have no great thoughts about himself he wasn't thinking of anybody but God walks up to Gideon and say Gideon the mighty man of Valor and there was a difference between Gideon's thinking and God sinking and God had a mission to change Gideon's thinking because Gideon had power but didn't know it Gideon was anointed but didn't know it Gideon had a prophesy over his head but he didn't know it Gideon had a ministry but did not know it he didn't had a purpose but he did not know it but for you to step in to your purpose you need to change your thinking he did such a thing different so course a Gideon the mighty man of Valor and Gideon did what we always do you may be seated you're talking about me no not me I'm not the one that's not how I see myself I'm a nobody my tribe is the smallest tribe my family is the smallest family I'm the smallest one in the family I didn't go to school I'm not a great place sir I don't pray a lot and you have all the reasons why the you are not the one that's chosen but God said that doesn't matter how you think about yourself that's temporary what matters is my thoughts concerning you you may be seated thoughts of God from a court brother branham said the exposition of seven churches is he said the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God attendants he said if you can see this you will see many things and this morning I want us to see many things he said God is unchangeable in both his essence which is his Constitution and the behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now living he already knows it he's not now learning there's nothing that you could do this morning that could surprise him your ups and down is not a shock to him he already saw all of that and still cause or you don't hear me this morning he saw all you I'm gonna talk about pizza and still call you and still thought about you and still send a prophet and still send a word to you because you were in his thinking if he is omniscient if he is all-knowing then he is not not learning no is he taking counsel he's not consulting anybody about you he's not trying to get a recommendation you know in your pi/4 job you need to bring referrals so that somebody can verify you are who you see you all you could or how you work in your last place of import anybody with me that's called taken counsel but because God is omniscient he is nor is he taking counsel even with himself in other words he can't second-guess himself he can say I know I choose him and I wonder if I made the right choice that can't even happen [Applause] but the random said no is he at anytime adding to his knowledge so it means everything there is to know about you he already knows it he cannot add to his knowledge he got the prophets words if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could see is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because He is God thus the thoughts of God are eternal they are real and they are real this morning [Applause] so let's just talk about that a little bit so it means when Jesus was at the Garden of Gethsemane and he was weeping he took sin upon him even though he never sinned he took pain upon him even though he never or you don't hear me this morning but he was thinking about something he said Lord if it is possible let this cup pass but then his mind went all the way to 2018 and he saw people he said what nevertheless Lord not my will but I will be done because I'm thinking about our people I'm thinking your thoughts he is thinking the thoughts of God and you are the expression of the thoughts of God Oh hallelujah Oh glory hallelujah hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah maybe this will help somebody this morning and cause thoughts become his strategy when got things of something he wants to put things in place to make sure his thoughts come to pass till you want Jesus to be born in Bethlehem so God doesn't just say go to Bethlehem he works all around he has the laws to change to pass a law that mary has to go to the place of her family's Fortin so that she has to go to get Jesus to where he is supposed to be that's God's Way of doing things he plans everything out he planned it from before there was a moon and before there was a star before you had a problem before you had a trial before you have no money before you felt sick before you were wondering if you're gonna make it before you had your ups and downs before you got married before you had children before you went to work before you went to school before you cried before you came out your mother's womb he already saw he saw you victorious huh he saw you overcoming he saw you in Reviver he saw you a son a daughter of God in full dominion in full power and his thoughts cannot change his thoughts will never change there's nothing you could do that could separate you from the love of God his love is his thoughts it's because of love he had the thoughts about you when you were no good love reached out and mercy reached out and grace reach out hallelujah Oh can the church see men somebody you've got a shout of praise Oh hallelujah you may be seated God existed by himself for the Congolese there was nobody for him to heal there was nobody for him to deliver there was no crying there was no tears up for him to wipe away the tears so God thought about people who he would wipe their tears away he thought of a people who would have their struggles who would have their ups and downs up but his mercy and grace and his favor would wipe their tears away he wanted to heal the brokenhearted and his portable healing have never changed her his thoughts about giving the baptism of the Holy Ghost has never changed he cannot change he will never fail you he said my word cannot return unto me void so today I believe in I declare that's it is your deal to claim your position based on what God thought about you it's time like Gideon you try your shoulders back and see the sword of the Lord and of Gideon the sword of the Lord and the bride the sword of the Lord and the Elector you were born for such a time as this [Applause] [Music] hallelujah he may be seated hallelujah hallelujah oh my somebody give him worship his thoughts about you his thought went beyond your sins he didn't he was not just thinking about your sins he covered that in the blood when he died on Calvary it's because he thought about your sins that's why he made a way oh there's no therefore no condemnation what are you talking about what mistake what failure are you talking about this morning he already thought up he already saw you fall he saw you may your mistake he saw you in the depths of sin and he said I'm gonna die I'm gonna put blood this blood for your sin there's blood for your deliverance there is blood for their protection oh nothing but the blood of Jesus up yes power in the blood this morning [Applause] but you don't hear me this morning I'm still warming up I'm still warming up sister Gloria I'm still warming I'm sister Jana I'm still warming up since I Candice I'm still warming up because somebody's gonna break free if you could change your thinking if you can tip it you know what go to all the profit if you could just get the people to believe not even cancer would stand in your way it has to be a change of your mind a change of you've got to see the possibility that you can get the Holy Ghost you have got to see the possibility it has to become your thinking [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah you may be seated hallelujah someone's gonna go free and God what I feel safe he put a feel safe in the world because the battleground is the mind the seed is already in your soul and the devil cannot take it out so you're gonna make it no matter what you are gonna oh you don't hear me this morning that scene is in your soul and no devil to take it out [Applause] so listen to me you may be seated so the devil he can touch your soul but it's an agreement that your mind is a battleground so all the devil's tactics and strategies comes down to how you think how you think about yourself how you think about the revival how you think about your healing that's why when the man came to the prophet and he prayed for him and he have no feet he told him go and say my stripes I'm healed because that scripture let the weak say I am strong you see the way to silence the mind is when you begin to speak you can't you know there's some people you may babysit it you tell em stop talking and think take before you're talking because there's an ability of people to speak without thinking so you're thinking I'm weak and God's a year when you when when you're weak say I am strong and start a war with your mind [Applause] so this man was seen by stripes I'm healed his mind he didn't even have mental feet to believe that but when he said as if I stripes I'm healed his mind would say I don't know but by some healed by stripes I'm healed by stripes I'm healed by his stripes I'm healed by his stripes I'm healed the woman whose son died and she was on her way to see Elijah they see what's going on is everything okay she had a choice she said I see my boy dead but she's here all as well no she had a fear to see all as well she don't know exactly how it's gonna play out what she had to silence the doubt silence the negativity oh you know hear me this morning let the weak say I am strong something happens when you begin to speak there begins to get a connection you actually bring your mind into subjection because you know speaking the word so you connect to the word that's your father's wood so you bring your mind your body under subjection I'm gonna be healed I'm gonna be delivered I'm gonna have a revival and we're gonna have a break true my son is coming that's how you you in the Maxie and they send your crazy but I'm gonna have a revival I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost this joy that I have you know you have feel joy in a long time but you still seeing it this joy that I have the world didn't give it to me and after a while you start to feel joy in your fingers joy in your toes joy on your head and joy on your nose just make that up but it's joy unspeakable and full of glory because you are taking charge somebody you're gonna shout appraised that's 60% somebody give God a shout of praise who you may be seated hallelujah oh my the thoughts of God [Applause] because his thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts go out had to find a delivery mechanism to bring his thoughts through yet he couldn't use anybody and everybody so he instituted an office called the Prophet and the job of the Prophet was to enter into the mind of God and see what was relevant for his day his age his people and his message and when the prophets woke he was speaking the thoughts of God for his day for his time for his people and his message and anybody who listened to that prophet got the Prophet's reward got the blessing of that prophet because that prophet once he stayed true to what he heard was speaking the mind of God so Moses he spoke the thoughts of God and when he spoke it was not Moses his thoughts it was God's thoughts so when Moses spoke it was not Moses his words it was God's Word because God has to use somebody and I thank God that an hour day he could have a prophet who can catch the mind of God because I couldn't catch it but yet the place our prophet to catch the mind of God and that prophet had to speak it and when's he spooky it becames mine it became yours and now we have authority to rest on the thoughts of God and to claim every promise claim our children claim on healing claim our deliverance claim our Dominion claim our power claim a redemptive rights you may receive it hallelujah I think we spoke about this over the Easter weekend about jurisdiction that this belongs to us we have jurisdiction heaven is not our domain but is it the Bible says we shall reign on the earth so the devil himself understand that this is not his home he is cotton initiative and God as weights in the whole creation is groaning for the sons and daughters of God to take their position that's why the Bible said a whole creation groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God when born sons filled sons would speak and they would move mountains it wouldn't even be praying in Jesus name because Jesus would be feeling the people it'll be just like pizza nobody was healing Jesus shadow but when Peter walked the earth the Bible said they were healing Peters shadow because the light of God was shining through Pizza brother you haven't seen power yet you haven't seen manifestation yet [Applause] you maybe see this can I talk about pizza a little bit I don't want to type it side to the thoughts of God the way this thing works friends is that there's no accident with God he doesn't make any mistakes so everything you went through in life anything you are going through in life anything you will go through in life there is no such thing as a mistake because the Bible says all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose so if you are connected to his purpose there is nothing like a mistake God is not accidental home you grew up in you may not understand why you grew up there but God pleased you there for a purpose Joseph was in prison and he didn't understand why he was there but that was part of the purpose when his brothers threw him in the well he didn't know what was being unfolded that yes down the road he would have been king he would have been a ruler he would have made a way for his family how you think Joseph felt when he was in the well you ever thought about it you see when you read scripture you must put yourself in that position put yourself in in in in in Joseph's shoes put yourself in Daniel shoes kneel and then see some people say that not sure by that one now I'll take me take me well but naughty lions then no but really put yourself in lines then my une lion some of you fraid spider put it any line then but Danny was there for a purpose and everything is for a purpose so go I had a purpose for Peter we read Pizza saying after your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and and that's pizza that's the pizza that is on top of his game as it were that's the pizza who is in this position but Peter was not always he wasn't always that way Peter had his struggles Peter had his doubts Peter had his failures and the Bible said that Peters first encounter if you when you read a scripture would have been hearing about Jesus and being there with the first miracle and the first miracle at the wedding wasn't enough for pizza to follow and then we read the scripture later on Peters mother-in-law was healed by Jesus and all of this was Peters experiences that was building up to God get you ready to call Peter but the only reason he can call pizza is because he had been thinking about Peter [Music] his mind was on Peter let me read a story of when Peter and his brethren had finished fishing one night and they caught nothing you remember right and the Bible said they were washing their nets they were packing up shop after a hard night of work where they caught nothing and the Bible said that Jesus came down and he sat in Peters boat he didn't even ask permission Peter was packing up to go home and Peter end up when acharyas leave a boat so Peter end up in a church service and Jesus is preaching on Peters boat Jesus uses Peters boat as his pulpit and Pizza is the unwilling participant in that service because it was not a service invitation nor had he planned to be there Jesus just appeared and had a service and at the end of the service Jesus tells Peter throw your net plural nets into the water into the deep lobos's and Peter say well a fish all night and caught nothing nevertheless because I hear what happened at the wedding because I see my mother-in-law healed but the Bible said he cast on his net singular as if to say I'll give it a shot but I'm not a hundred percent going through all minutes I've seen enough to convince me but I'm not a hundred percent convinced because I didn't have a personal experience I've heard what happened at the wedding that wasn't me I heard what happened with my mother-in-law but I wasn't me but I'm willing to give it a try I wanted to try it one more time but God was thinking about pizza because pizza had a purpose that he had to accomplish I didn't know what the next day was gonna be like or the next month was gonna be like or the next year it's gonna be like but he started to trust and the batteries every throw the net into the water that got so much fish that the net Brook and the baby set up it's a marveled and his response was he fell and started to repent because he recognized that he was in the presence of something she clicked that he recognized that he was a sinner because he said it Lord I'm a sinner and that was the experience that was Peters turning point and Jesus said follow me and I said to the young people Peter left the boat he left the fishes he left everything and he followed Jesus and that sounds like a wonderful testimony and it is and there are many people who have never had an experience with God so they they come they have some level of belief but it's not deep rooted in their source and Peter he's coming on he's believing more and more his faith is going Jesus doing miracles he gets v lo2 fishes the disciples to Peter among them what these are so many he sees a miracle this is Peter Jesus walking on the water Peter said Lord if that's you pin me come we know the story here we find Peter again walking underwater without the Holy Ghost walking underwater until you recognize that he wasn't too comfortable and he started to sink he said lord save me st. Peter but God is thinking about pizza he's not thinking of his ups and downs and his mistakes and failures he's thinking of where pizza is going to be [Applause] now to show you how God things differently from us if we know something bad about somebody most of us can deal with it most of us can deal with stuff that's bad about somebody it troubles us and yet Jesus knew every mistake Peter would make jesus said who do men say that I am Matthew 16 and the brothers I will remember this terribly well some say you are Elias something you are Jeremiah Simon Peter said Oh at a price it's not eleven go up it is the only one he said flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father in heaven I want you to understand like a man I wonder how Peter felt when he heard that Peter would have felt good he would have felt special and then I later down that same chapter jesus knows how to introduce to them I'm going to die I'm going to be crucified and Peter's like no not so not no no no and Jesus a caddy beyond me Satan I wanna help Peter felt but God is still thinking about Peter through his mistakes through his failures through his ups and downs Peter is still unguarded because God knew that pizza had a destination with the pillar of fire he had a destination with the upper room and that's what I want to strike on but even before that God to a pizza he said pizza before the crow you go to deny me you remember then Peter said no I'll never deny you you know what I did study my Christ the Bible said if you stand for me I'll stand 15 I mean you're on your own and in the moment of Jesus's greatest need as it were Peter stood there and deny Christ and God knew he was gonna do it and still didn't even change his mind about Peter because he had a certain thought about Peter and it really struck me because we just came through Eastern when you read a scripture about the woman who went to annoying the body of Jesus brother Clarence when they met the angel the angel said to them and I always it never really hit me so much until a few years ago and the ages of them go tell his disciples and Peter God was thinking of my Peter so much he knew pizza would have been feeling down after three and a half years you deny the ministry that walked on water that fed 5,000 them Jesus had Peter on his torch so much that when he angel spoke to them he said go tell my disciples and Peter Peter might be down in the dumps right now go find Peter and tell him that I'm not dead it's hard to understand what Peter would have gone through to know that God says you're gonna deny me you know you're gonna feel like this is no Lana I'm gonna be strong I'm gonna make it and then Peter find himself victim or falling to the very thing he said he would not fall to deny Christ deny your testimony Peter would have gone into hiding as it will we don't even know how the other disciples looked at Peter in so much where the currents of the Angels have gone tell my disciples and Peter [Music] you don't know what anybody is going through this morning you don't know what pain what struggle what valley but pizza I don't know what I'm thinking he would have been in some type of Valley because he felt that he failed God but God's thoughts was on him that Gordon said Peter you finished he said go tell my disciples and pizza telling all my life tell him the promise is real tell him the promise is true tell him I'm still thinking about him tell him when I was walking up Calvary he was on my mind when I stood on the cross he was on my mind he may have messed up what he is on my mind [Applause] three times fifteen I cried but when Jesus met him he said Peter love is down me he has him three times so he could undo what you're done lord I love you lord i love you lord i love you and that's what i feel this morning lord i love you lord i love you lord i love you i've made mistakes i have not stood as strong as i should have stood all the time in small ways we have denied this gospel we have denied this christ but the thing that his thoughts are telling us that he can see past our mistakes see past our failures see past our falling she passed our valley and say you're gonna make it you're gonna overcome you're gonna get the Holy Ghost you're gonna be delivered you wanna be set free [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah somebody give God praise because God's thoughts it's not limited by time his thoughts are eternal so in the black part of God's minor God always saw pizza on the day of Pentecost he always saw pizza silver and gold have I not but such as I have I'm gonna give it unto you everything before was the processor to bring pizza to that's what up and everything before today has been the process to bring you to the service to bring you to this moment to bring you to this Oh hallelujah oh my Oh glory glory glory oh my total not your thoughts my ways are not your ways but I see heavens are higher than the earth so are my higher than your torture and so are my ways higher than your ways up when you get trouble to forgive it's easy for God to forgive when you have to hold on and struggle to let go God lets it go and drops it into the sea of forgetfulness when you remember what you did God can't even remember what you did oh you know hear me respond it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah our thoughts are not like his thoughts our thoughts of the nature of our thoughts are evil the nature of our thoughts is jealousy and envy and strife and malleson but his tortoise Pisa and goodness and meekness and gentleness and the Bible says of let the mind it was in Christ be in you that is a promise of let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus God wants to give you a chance phantom of your thinking that you can begin to think like him that you could love like him that you could forgive like him but you could have his power you could have his character you could have his nature you can have his being you can have his attributes Oh somebody give him praise Oh hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when you're thinking changes it changes your walk it changes your thought you have to know when your thinking is not enough when your intelligence is not enough just were realize that he had ran out of ideas and how to Road the enemy so he entered into the mind of God he didn't even know what he was saying but he said son stand still that was not his thinking anymore when David looked at Goliath her without a sword he could not have been thinking like an ordinary person when he said I'll cut your head off he had gone to a higher level of thinking he I could Wendy whether the mind of God and if you go to the mind of God today you can see your family restored you can see your house restored you can see you on fire you can see her in Fievel in your soul [Applause] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's why the word says

deal with greater challenges your thinking must change oh let's sit P the name of the Lord there's a wolf here going on friends it's a wolf in the mind it's a wolf in the spiritual realm and in the message put on the whole armour of God or he said you know this warfare between nations he said it's a great warfare going on be to be on that it's a warfare between God and Satan we know this already is the first warfare it's still raging and I'm so glad the Prophet said it'll soon come to an end then it will be over and Satan as his agents out everywhere watching spying out on God's people and God's moves and the enemy is setting everywhere watching to see what he can do and God's got some hour to so we find that these secret agents of the enemy each nation now will equip its men you know the quote with the latest equipment the very latest and in study and they do everything they're trying to counteract the other fellows weapons they get a little more modern weapon something a little more punch to it from the bore an arrow to a musket from a musket to a modern rifle and from that anatomic they just keep on building it keeps them busy all the time and if they want to survive they want to equip their soldiers with the best equipment that there is with the Vanuatu well-core you know he's infinite see he don't have to think anything better he just got the best to begin with so you cannot improve on it nothing to be done about it he just gives us the best that's his word that's right that's his word the best that can be given God gives his people the very best that's what he chose for his children the very very best I'm so glad of that can the church team and when you watch the natural world you have countries for years they call it the arms race different countries wanted to get better weapons they wanted to get nuclear weapons just recently there's rumors going around with Syria and Russia and China and this nuclear war and that and that's in the natural around it took years for countries to develop the weapons they have but in the Church of the Living God the Prophet said God give us the best weapon up front while natural man was improving we always had a very best weapon they have to do tests and study and the trial is rocket to see if it will work we don't wonder if it will work it does work every single time when just one needed it to work it will tend when Talia needed it to work it worked then when the Hebrew boys needed a tool they didn't need a better weapon they said our God is able to deliver us and he did when Moses looked at the Egyptian they had swears they had straws they had chariots Moses had a word he said the Egyptians you see today he will see them no more all these fears shields chariots they had was irrelevant

I'm not willing I'm not willing to let them go I'm not willing I don't know about you but I'm not willing to see the devil take our young people and I'm not willing I'm not willing I'm ready to fight back is anybody with me that's ready to fight back the preacher cannot bring a revival it takes a burden I'm not willing to see any more brothers and sisters suffer in sickness but the Branham said if you could get the church in one mind and one Accord in five minutes there'd be not one sick person in the building my desire this morning God helped me is to see the church get into one mind get into one accord get into one hope get into one expectations oh I'm tired this morning I'm seeing people come to church and see them go back with their problems today today today we serve notice I'm tired of the up and down I'm tired this is not an ordinary service the thoughts of mind of God has dropped down this morning to make a way for you to reach out little Lily push your way out of the muck this morning push your way out of the mire this morning come on young people come on young people come on mama come on Papa set an example set an example for your house as for me and my house we will serve

blessed be the name of the Lord oh my the Holy Ghost is here the angel of the Lord is here he is not finished yet this is not about this is not about me this morning this is about God himself he didn't come to him man this morning but make you me of a soul experience [Applause] halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah friends we don't think about him enough we don't meditate on him enough oh that song let's forget about ourselves and concentrate on something happens when you are thinking about him and he's thinking about you oh but the random and the message the world became flesh he said what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you saw embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's Spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be what kind of people would it be this morning if this Branum tabernacle and I say if this headstone tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God when you didn't even use your own mind didn't even use your own thoughts you didn't even have no ultimate of your own but just to be led by the spirit our thoughts run different a lot of times we walk up and say how you do brother and you don't mean it in your heart but when you become so dead to the things of the world this is the prophets word that crisis first Christ is all that's a powerful statement Christ is first Christ is all then your entire make up is of the spirit he has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean your thoughts with me pure can the church say Amen Oh hallelujah friends the world is preparing for a funeral service how do you the musicians can get ready friends God has a way of approach and I believe that everyone is here this morning not because of formality or because we just want to be in church this morning because we want to get something from the Lord there's a need in your heart is a desire in your heart there's a cry there's a fist you know David lost the joy of his salvation he didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of it and he prayed a prayer Lord restore and to me the joy of my salvation renew a right spirit in me when we have problems we have struggles it consumes our mind it consumes our thinking what is the bills whether it's sickness whether it's stress on the job or in your marriage or family or whatever it consumes your thinking and it becomes very difficult to focus as it will it takes a pull and a pressure to do anything there are people who can function in a work because they are just overwhelming they can function in marriage because they are overwhelmed they can't cope with life because they are overwhelmed and and if people are going to that level of being overwhelm is even hard to enter into presence of God because your mind is you come to church and you're thinking about the bill or the project or whatever it is and something has to arrest you to make that separation between this natural world and the things of God and if you ever want to approach God there's a way to approach God but the random said if you don't know how to approach God we'll never get an audience with God you could have the desire to get the audience but if you have the wrong approach he will not receive you friends I want that reconnection of the relationship with God that when you approach God he hears you but a Branham said it's not even man that seeks God it's God at six men his nature is holy his nature is high and man the fall is low and degraded that's a Prophet's wood but the man said a man without God he's not mentally right Butler Adam said a man without cord is no more than a brute he said now that sounds very deep but I can prove it to you and the only reason that we have a civilization today is because of Jesus Christ people says that the religion of Jesus Christ runs you crazy the Rev Adam said it gives you your right mind he says you're not right till you find him notice he didn't say a fine Church he said find him but the man said I don't mean to hurt your feelings Brad you know gentlemen I don't mean to do that but I mean to actually put the thing just the way it is Christ never makes you lose your mind he gives you your mind after you lost it it's the devil that makes you lose your mind and but the Branham talks about Legion how he was out of his mind until Jesus came to restore his mind his right mind and a man with all his rights might not matter how much in the leg he has he still not seen yet without knowing Christ now a lot of people know Church they know the Bible they know about God but they don't know Christ but the Branham said he doesn't know any different you've got to become born again and to the world when you're born again it may look foolish but in the sight of God you become blessed and no matter how much the world tries to say anything about it you know then have you a pass from death into life so just polishing and joining church and reading a whole lot and knowing a lot of books and authors and so forth doesn't mean that you're converted because you have an intellectual mind that means you have a mental conception that is a God somewhere you're not a Christian yet until you become personal in contact with Christ that changes your heart and nature then you become God's child and all things is passed away and all things become new again and many of us we convinced ourselves mentally that we are okay and when you find yourself in a situation you realize that you need more of God you know fresh experience with God a deeper experience with God to meet the challenge of the hour because the challenge is not getting easier it's getting harder and you will require a deeper relationship with God to face the challenge of the hour on one level it troubles me when people come to church and then during the week they live a different life you dress one way for church you speak one way for church you act one way if a church but the moment is service is over or you are out of contact from believers it's like you a whole different person the words you use change the way you dress change do you speak to your family changes and that's the hypocrisy that God hates he's in a rally your heart or your call but this middle-of-the-road business I'll throw you out of my mouth but the brand said the Holy Spirit has to call us first or we'll never think nothing of it he said churches all right I believe that's okay with the real touch God has to do it is there anybody this morning looking for a real touch a real touch from God not too fulfilled you know I press Maria to come to church really it's a real touch how could you come to service and and and leave with your cup with room in it trying to close up [Music] hmm with the brown them said without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin but the bottom said Adam had his own approach when he took the fig leaves to cover up his shame and by the ban I'm tagged a terrifically used to your own interpretation your own ideas and there are a lot of people here this morning who quite honestly really think they're okay and today if man things now help mrs. Jones over here she's a widow woman she needs some coal I'll give it to the Red Cross or some charity out of my abundance I would join the church you only make in yourself an approach that God will refuse there's only one approach to God God refused Adams approach and then God went and made an approach for Adam he made Adam and approach to himself and by doing that he slayed some sheep or something and get them some skins and shoo the blood brought the first approach to the world to God for sin and that was God's first method and it has been from that day till this day the same thing true the shedding of the blood brings the approach to God and in every season and every time because when Jesus died up until that time he still use goats and sheep oh and Jesus that he was the perfect sacrifice ran the field from top to bottom to allow individuals to access or have access and then he typed it through the word that the same blood that was applied as the token for them to come out of Egypt it's the same blood that must be applied in the spiritual in our day to come out of this Egypt that we're living in and the word says when I see the blood I'll pass over you the true Passover when I see the token I'll pass over you when I see the life I'll pass over you when I see the Holy Ghost I'll pass over you when I see the word manifested I'll pass over you I'm gonna Branham said this token must be displayed it can be hidden it must be displayed to the public so that people can know this is your testimony people can walk outside your house and says that's a Christian the people on your job can see that's a real Christian who Lord help us that's the thoughts of God that he has concerning you that you become his advertisement board that you become his display that you become his expression when people see you they see him Friends of Jesus that this world will see will be him living through individuals in such a timelessness so maybe you have been come he could be gonna play something softly maybe you're here this morning and I don't know what you're going through this morning but his thoughts were you are the same and he's not ready to give up on you maybe you are sick this morning his thoughts for you off for healing maybe you are backslidden this morning his thoughts for you are for deliverance and if you are looking for the Holy Ghost this morning his source for you how to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire can we all stand to our feet this morning [Music] can we bow our heads from little friend [Music] is anybody this morning wants to
