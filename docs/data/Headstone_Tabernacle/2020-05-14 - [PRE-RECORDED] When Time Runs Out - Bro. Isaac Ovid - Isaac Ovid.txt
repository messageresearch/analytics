name of the Lord amen amen and amen welcome to the house of the Lord this morning certainly good to be here you appreciate the Lord this morning amen so before you take your seats alight to get to the Scriptures reading two portions of Scripture both in the book of Revelation reading revelation 10 and reading from Revelation chapter 22 for scripture reading this morning looking for God to do something special for us in this season revelation 10 and reading from verse 1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head that his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had it his hand little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cry with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and he enjoyed which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and reading revelation 22 and reading verse 10 and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still metre Lord at a blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this morning so I have a title this morning and I believe I told buddy Hugh on Wednesday night that is about true but over two weeks or so ago that the Lord gave me this thought this message for today and when we're over preached two weeks ago the last message the last Commission the last name I spoke with him and I said I know what I have is to follow the message and then he continued along the same vein last Sunday whereas I was with Moses so shall I be with thee but within that message he has a theme of the last message the last Commission the last name because the Prophet says one of these days a last name would be called dolby shot and it'll be all over similar to noah's d that god shut the door noah had no control over god shutting the door and last wednesday we had an exhortation and pre-meeting and we spoken come thou and thy house into the ark and we see the signs we see the political science II the economic signs we see the signs in disguise I believe later tonight or so there should be a total lunar eclipse call it a Blood Moon and they have different names for it I could take an hour and talk about that but the signs in the skies that's that's we have a we have the sign of the wood and we know that those signs in the skies because we're Branum taught us that there are three Bibles the heavens the pyramids and the written word and we want to feast on the Word of God because that is what prepares us we could spend a lot of time talking about the political situation and yes brother Branham preached on modern events made clear by prophecy but the word that has gone forth for us is not for us to labor on what's happening around us it's for us to labor and what's happening inside of us because we could have all knowledge of what's happening around us what's happening in the political realm what's happening in the ecclesiastical realm and still miss what is most important that is a change on the inside of us and for some reason or the other and it's something I believe I said on Wednesday night that the whole purpose of coming to church is for us to change for us to mature and the maturity that comes with this God saw and has an order for how it's supposed to take place so for you to even manifest the virtue of the age of brotherly kindness you have to be around people who can test you for that virtue to be manifested you can hide on a mountain and be in solitary confinement or self-imposed solitary confinement and get brotherly kindness because there's nobody testing you so God made it in such a way that you have to interact with people good people nice people Christian people wonderful people but they invariably have to rub you the wrong way God designed it that way so that the virtue could be manifested so hiding and having problem with people and when problems arise with people having positions and things to say about it you are actually going around away instead of going through the path that God ordained for you for your own perfection for your own maturity for your own growth and when you look back at your life you must be able to see that you are graduating from stage to stage to seed you must be making progress you cannot stay in standard one for all of your life after standard one should be standard to understand the two so take you all the way up to Common Entrance or what what do they call it now I see eight and then he's was a possum that's teacher another stage when I was a child I speak as a child but when I became a man I put away the childish things there's a time limit to the stages of your life and time is something that we will not have all the time Oh help me so what I encourage you this morning when I push you and prod you unto good works that's what became the church form and people want to bypass the process and the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even as they approach him so when we come together it's not by accident it's not by chances not because we want to do something but because we are compelled to do something because God not only has something to say to us here's an experience that we have when we come into an upper room like environment because God wants a dispute his Holy Ghost so different individuals different gifts different gifts and every gift master find its place and every member of the body has something to do and if you don't know what you have to do yet wait until your change comes because when the Holy Spirit comes it comes to activate the mechanics the purpose the call of God upon your life that the devil has brought all these years to thwart the devlins flood all these years to distract you and not that you realize that you have a high calling that you may not understand but is still a high calling that you may not realize but it's still a high calling in Christ Jesus not for your own agenda not based on your own interpretation not based on your own ambition but based on what God wrote about you we are living out what God has written about us we can live nothing else but what God has written about us and what God has written about us must stand up what God has written about us must be accomplished so when the doctor says something contrary to what the doctor to what God wrote about us then that becomes a lie when our school teacher says something to us that's not what God said about us then the teacher is a lie [Applause] [Music] and the church amen hallelujah my you may be seated we send the pulpit to get miss time I'm missing I'm missing my space here but Anthony break free this is where we break free this is this is where we we did this is where we are real sell this is where who we are you know this is this is what we come for this is what we come to do when we come to church we are reminded of our high calling we are reminded that we are a royal priesthood we as a people a royal priesthood each one of us why a priesthood we are of the tribe of Levites we are royal priests doctor enter into the Holies of Holies before Jesus came only the high priest could go in there but when Jesus came the sailors rent from top to bottom giving everyone of us access into the goodness of God giving us access to ask what we will whatever it is what we will and see it come to pass and in my name they will cast out devils in my name is speaking new tones in my name there lay hands on the sick and these signs shall follow them that believe do we have believers here this morning who believe all of God's would not just for your children but for you not just for the pastor but for you not just for the person next to you but for you [Applause] hallelujah we don't follow signs but signs follow the believers wherever the believers walk signs are following you even if you don't recognize it signs are following you and the church amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we have something to thank God for and you know something friends it's time to stop putting a cover on your praises there are many reasons you should give praises this morning some people have this thing about you know something could happen and you don't want to tell nobody about it because they want to live a secret in life this is why we are Church because we can rejoice when you rejoice we can celebrate when you celebrate when you feel pain we feel free because that's how our body operates somebody preached back to me hallelujah and if you don't have a reason the shouts out for the person next to you or somebody helped me because we are one body hallelujah by love United Blood Ties another body by one spirit hallelujah you may be seated and this relationship between Christ and His Church who God joined together let no man put asunder the relationship are the Branham said the engagement ring of predestination that he pleased upon your finger who caught joined together let no man put asunder that's what has been keeping you because the the engagement ring the promissory ring for this marriage is about to come one slipped on your finger before you even born it was already on your finger he said it's the engagement ring of predestination before your mother was born it was on your finger before your Papa was born it was on your finger you could not miss this marriage if you wanted to oh god help me this morning and you want to tell me core can't hear you you want to tell me girl can't deliver you you want to tell me core can't take away the stony heart and give you a new heart and give you a new spirit and put your spirit inside it here we can restore your mind we can restore your joy we can restore your victory we're gonna have an old-fashioned church old-fashioned sin killin sky blue Holy Ghost filled you are washed anointed the devil can move that's the kind of trust we're gonna have you may be seated hallelujah I don't know what's gonna happen today I haven't even gotten to my title yet brother pop well but the Holy Ghost is in the house the angel of the Lord is already here the ministering angel is already in our camp this morning he's not here for me he's yet to deliver us he's here for all of us you didn't come to hear man this morning you can't take a direct from God may he speak to us this morning to show us how to go to show us how to leave this place you may be seated [Applause] God has done so much for us and it's doing so much for us you are blessed we are blessed this has nothing to do on the street or any other church or group I'm speaking to the sovereign local church God has blessed us that's the truth I can deny it I can be embarrassed about it he has blessed us he has preserved us he has kept us it's His grace has kept us and that's why you have to have a revelation why you're in this church there are many churches I'm not against any Church there are many wonderful children this morning and we identify with any Church and we preach the message of Malachi 4 without interpretation without applying pins without applying colouring and washing it in the full word we identify with the full word because we're the panum said there your name is not written all my neville or leave me l or whatever in there the name is the mystery of who you are it's all of the world identifier that's my identity so we see our names in the world we see our names in the structure we cannot help ourselves our room has been Sheela we have been impregnated with the revealed word of Malachi for in its entirety you cannot take it out we cannot take a man cheat at it somebody helped me preach this morning um you see the young people that's why when you go to a job and you go to different situations you can never be happy in the world because the scene has already been shown and that C can only produce itself so even when you fall and you make mistake that C cannot produce a carnal church that she produces temple church that C cannot introduce one of the Ephesians that C can only produce our Holy Ghost revival so even when you're covered in the mud and the devil thinks you're finished you might Oh shucks done finish that scene that was there before you were born and screaming out out coming out coming out [Applause] maybe see them [Music] I feel good this morning I feel good this morning you supposed to feel good too [Applause] the promise of restoration of this church is not to have it was 10 years ago not how it was 20 years ago not how it was in 19 or the 80s the restoration of this church it's not even to when the Prophet was here the restoration of this church is to the Alpha Church the original Church the original Pentecost the original Church where Peter said these men are not drunk as you suppose since that time every age has been pointed back to that age can the church shame and let me say bring back the old time there you don't even know what I'm talking about because we were not there but when you read the scriptures about what was there that was a different kind of Church god help us get that kind of a church lesson kind of stay in the church where you walk him and your sinners expose you you have to pray before him you don't want to leave your house without brand because you know the Holy Ghost will uncover whatever is in darkness will come to light because the season change can the church say men [Applause] everybody feeling fine Oh mine put on your seatbelts don't don't take a seatbelt off I told the Deacons a couple weeks ago make sure nobody just walking around aimlessly and no doubt poopers down sales and stuff make sure people keep their seatbelts on you don't want to miss the destination you want to miss way why you come to trade this isn't a social gathering you know this is not a club is not a community you know this is an army and every man must take his rock every man must be nurse please every man must be nez perce ition the maturing and the growth for us is the bring us to be well established in opposition can the church say men and something in growth because even my own walk and I'm looking at things and I'm I'm seeing a certain way and that's a challenge because but the Branum said God don't make halfway preachers but a preacher could be halfway God don't make half make Christian but a Christian could be halfway and I realize where a lot of people missed it because God give gifts but gifts our doubt repentance so men for years and the message that rely on just their gift and you can have a mighty ministry on just a gift but there's more than just a gift because Paul wouldn't tell Timothy to study to show yourself approved so even with the gift you have to study to see spend the time to get into the secret things of God and spend time in a secret closet them and you could have a gift you could have knowledge you could study and still miss the anointing because where the balance had got to be annoying thing from him for five years but when you get the gift with the study with the anointing with the grace of God with the seasoned the spiritually put together the word spiritual food in due season then the chains could break off of your life because God is a present and God it's not a conscious of yesterday yes he is that he's not just a corner tomorrow but chains are being broken today demons are shaking in your life and they have to let you go because the world is not just comment that's the port the waters with power and to have a real demonstration in your life and the church amen [Applause] everybody feeling fine and because of this week we have now understood clearer than before that God has an order there's a way that court operates and there's a way we have to operate in this army of the Lord because God doesn't break his order for anybody I'm the church say Amen [Applause] so just talk a little bit today is that fine from a message of blushing prophets and for my title this morning before I get to that my tattle is when time runs out when time runs out when time runs out sometimes we live life as if we have all the time in the world some of us we have an appointment to be at a certain place at a certain time and we act as if we have all the time in the world and that's why we're late when you have an exam to do there's a time given to an exam sometime it's 90 minutes two hours it depends on the examination but after a while time begins to run out powerful thought huh time did not always exists because God is eternal so time has a beginning and because it has a beginning but the random taught us anything that has a beginning has to have an ending and we read the scripture that she a mighty angel come down from heaven and later on in verse 6 he said declare that time no longer no more time no more time friends time is coming to an end and when you look through history every single thing you thought he was gonna be Primus forever you know when you hit premier school that was world but that time run out and I said to somebody yesterday I said no matter what comes in your life you cannot ignore the challenges the situation that come you can't ignore them because when you close your eye and wake up in the morning if you don't deal with it it's still there what you do the ostrich is the animal that when it sees a problem you know what the ostriches it digs in a small hole puts his head into the hole and tries to will the problem a week and I don't know how to describe if it has a heart or what but if the ocean has a heart he's praying then when he lifts his head back up the problem will not be there and invariably when you raise the head back up the problem is still there anybody with me this morning so let me get it to my techs and then I'll hit my title later on right so in a blessing profits it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the Christian I heard somebody speaker miss a couple days ago and he said you know the problem is we have too many Christians who cannot inspire anybody because your head scrape any floor you sure look like something on your shoulder and you will wonder what experience you had with God because you're not smiling and and listen swelling is not based on your current situation smiling is based on your relationship with God smiling is peace on your perspective of your situation and we give the story of the person was complaining because he had no shoes and he stopped complaining when he saw the person with no feet his perspective change because he saw things a bit differently but many times our eyes are not fixed on God and our eyes and a pixel are calling so we look around us and we are influenced by these things and we miss the blessings that God has carried us through and because God is not obligated to explain to us all that he's doing for us can I steal it again God is not obligated to tell us all he's doing for us so when you miss the accident on the road and Court is who diverted the captain I'll hit you and you did reading your papers you missed her and you don't know ain't just working overtime and you and you wanna walk sad you wanna walk depressed you may be seated there are many stories I've heard there's one of a young lady she was walking through some area and that area there are some guys who are robbing the people in the area and she walked through and when she got to the other side and so on so people were asking well how come didn't rob you and when they asked the guys who were doing the robbing why all he didn't rob that little girl who was vulnerable is it she was not alone she was walking with she was walking with two other people I saw two big strong fellows walking with her we're not shopping why we will go and mess with her when she have two people with her wieners shopping we looking for easier targets listen you are not a easy target nothing could come your way unless God allows it you are like job unless God give the devil permission he cannot come to your house you may be seated so if the devil has come on your street to come to your house it means that God says it's okay to give him a shot but I know that that's my boy I know that's my daughter I know he was and I know she would have a testimony you can take his job you can take his family but he was still worship me you may be seated [Music] I pray you maybe see that this morning God opens your spiritual eyes when your carnal and it looked me in flesh you see everything in the flesh you see a bank account in the flesh you look at it doctor's report in the flesh listen there are more zeros on your account and you see but I say never believe man they don't believe me there are more zeros on your account and you can see because he promises supply all of your needs a quality his riches in glory forget what the banker telling you you have a bigger bank account you don't need a big set of money to go to the doctor you don't need a big settlement no because you have access to the best doctor you have access to do you know how much money it is to get the best doctor you initiative you much money it is the Heidi best lawyer when a situation come your way and you have enough money on your account because you have a ring of predestination to get the best lawyer somebody help me this morning to get me best doctor when you have a situation with your child is because you in your flesh that you try to get into the mix of it instead of letting God settled his beliefs you may be seated or somebody that's the confidence that will make the men of all said the battle is not it's not mine the battle is the Lord's and you know why he does it for his namesake because his name is important to him and he don't want the enemy to ever think that he can't keep his word he keeps his what about you even when you don't deserve it he keeps his word for his name sake he will bless you for his name sake he will deliver you for his name's sake because he is a deal to it unconditional covenant that's what unconditional me it's not based on your actions it's based on what he said he will keep he may be seated hallelujah you may be seated that's why the headstone will come with sodium's client grace grace grace because Adam proved that when it was a two sided relationship God didn't ban the corded man did man field and God said you know what must be an unconditional relationship his love is unconditional his love doesn't cheap when you make mistakes his love for you is just calling you back to repentance calling you back to Greece calling you back to make things right calling you back to say that I'm sorry he's not gonna allow you now and don't mix up his grace with you doing foolishness his grace is to deal with you when you fall when you couldn't help yourself not when you deliberate you walk in the show business can the church say man you can set some time ago I said listen even the devil game blame for stuff you didn't do you choose to eat hamburger when I hosted a papaya tree mne morning wake up Sunday morning your stomach hurts in the city devil Tiger Beat ever did not tell you up you have to know wisdom you have to know what the devil might try to get you to eat and know they say well I'm not eating that tonight because tomorrow is but the fast some of you do you even know what fasteners because you want to be ready for war you want to be ready for actually I want to be ready because you realize we're in a spiritual world or rest or war it's not carnal it's not it's not flesh and blood so when your wife acha by your husband occupied sure now it's not flesh on blood go and pray come on pray and what's got you in the situation around what go out do something your default response to the prayer you are automatic your default setting should be prayer when you reset to default prayer when you feel upset pray when you feel tired pray when you feel very pretty when you feel sick pray so I'm taking my time this morning go here in the presence of the Lord so I just want to lay a foundation and get to my thoughts and see what God will do today but in my heart the Lord knows my heart I don't want to see anybody leave here today deceive me that he came there must be a change there must be a call to something to move on the inside first accreta revival and revival is not started in the church it's in your homes but you cannot get desperate by the Branson until God speaks to you so may God speak to your heart today so that you could do more to see your family deliver to see your situation change because the word has compelled you not motivation not jumping out shouting but a real introspection let every man examine himself and see am i living up to the expectation as set by the Prophet we have a standard we're not trying to create a standard we already have a standard but abandone brought a standard and God does not change so this standard has not been lowered or dropped it's the same standard the standard of holiness the standard of righteousness it's a standard of purity it's a standard of love it's a standard of living the right way can the church say Amen it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the Christian times are going to change the all's going to become young oh my dad's gonna feet away sickness will be no more no more prayer meetings for the sick no more prayer meetings for the loss but God shall come and take the elect from the four winds of the it and shall gather them under his own wings and we live and reign with him forever in his heaven oh brother sister friend of mine if you're not prepared tonight if you're not prepared to deal may you prepared at this hour I give you an invitation to come to Christ Jesus tonight and receive you that's been different you're not the way you used to be enough yet has consecrated as dedicated you are yet a demon but you know that you're not living at the standard but you're supposed to be at but the man said you don't know that you're not where he should be with God and if you know you're not where you should be with God what you gonna do about it I invite you to the altar with myself I invite every one of you to come here and not only see but to stay here until God has cleansed your soul from everything that's unlike him and I was speaking about over before he left to Mexico and he was talking about the Azusa Street revival how Seymour you surprised almost five hours d if it's for a year or something like that or two years or five hours every day five hours in them I want you to think about it and people come to service on a Sunday and say well once it past hour and I have to all be we into overtime no we know that in certain five hours a day because he was looking for something are you looking for something or you want to with another crisis come to run to the church and see where the elders have oscillate hands and pray this is not semantics we are looking to leave here I am NOT taking chances with my destination I kind of for to take chances I want to be a hundred percent sure that I'm going to make it and the church amen but to stay here until God has cleanse your soul from everything that's unlike him until you can go out of here a new person not with a corn plaster or not covering up the situation but go out a with a blood transfusion that purifies your blood and gives you new life and a new hope anybody looking for a new hope a new life and you walk and you talk and you perspective a new a fresh anointing listen to the Prophet go out with a baptism of the holy spirit go out not shouting not dancing so much dem tings are all right they all belong in the church you all belong in the Bible but I'm talking about is the Holy Spirit God's love that's what we're looking for God's love come to church see him him but I Brandon in a mighty golden veil I'm identify with a group that feels of Spirit of God I'm identified with a group that knows he's unfilled that knows he's a seen yesterday today and forever and know that this is not fanaticism it's Jesus Christ is him yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group here tonight he had they're called a bunch of heretics yet a bunch of fanaticism on account of the Word of God but I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ but it's the power of God unto salvation what are we looking for this is our promise a church that Jesus don't walk in a kind of church that God's prophet longed to see a church full of power I chose that with unite with the head stoner sous-chef know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I believe it all my heart and we will have that kind of a cheat can the church say Amen so for such a time as this we have been raised up God overlooked Abraham God overlooked even God overlooked Joshua God went and searched true and he saw you like Johnny said no they can't deal with this age their mission their purpose their ministry is for their time I need to find a different group of people who can deal with this age of the Internet and this interferes book and this age of technology and it's and still have a testimony and still in this it be able to tell the devil no I'm not gonna report to you I'm not gonna answer to you I don't have to explain myself to you somebody please back to me and they'll be conscious that time is short you cannot come to church like you have all the time you cannot come to church like every time any would but if I said one day be the last song song will have the last service and I preach the message a long time I go to the young people do not cross the line and but I'm and I'm talked about young people coming to the altar when I read this quote it had me spinning in fact let me see if I could pull it up quickly for you is that okay he was it a message that deity of Jesus Christ but the madam said I'm thinking of those young people that night down there at the altar listen friends at the altar trying to be saved but have crossed the line no redemption for them they were gone could not be saved and people come to church acting as if this salvation and this mercy and this Redemption is an indefinite thing the Cabrera brand said this each we are blending from time into eternity salvation is not required in eternity redemptions are required in eternity you need to be scenery team to get there so when we blend into eternity and as we are blending in there'll be a line that is drawn as we read the scripture in revelation 22 he let his filthy filthy still he that is righteous righteous still and people on ascended off time to come to church when the prophet screamer is later than we think it's got me scared have I done enough are you ready are you ready are you ready to give an account are you ready to have a testimony are you ready to answer for all the years you have sat in church under the greatest ministry of the Prophet message of Malachi 4 can we give an account for what this message has done to bring us to Christ the mess was not to bring us to the Prophet the Prophet was a sign pointing us to Jesus Christ and how desperate are we to live this before our time runs out because make no mistake about it time is running out can the church say Amen I'll take my time this morning I want is to get home but Ibrahim said in a message is your life will be to reject the day of visitation when God is making a visit to the church and to the people receive it then don't put it off till next year or the next revival that's the hour today is the day of salvation when time runs out time is running out on the economy but the Branham for toll of economic collapse economic ruin and we have had different points from history and the Great Depression and different things but this whole economic system has to crumble because it's not God's order politics has to crumble and as great as every Empire thought they would they had an end the Greeks came to the end didn't realize that time was gonna run out on them they thought it would have been ruling forever Egypt in Pharaohs they went Moses was there Pharaoh control the entire world they talked about going to be forever but time was running out when Moses came down to Egypt he came because time was running out he came to enforce the fact that time was running on Moses was the instrument Moses was what was ticking the time down or God help me this morning so when Moses hit Egypt the clock was just Pharaoh didn't know that every day Moses was in Egypt he had one day less but that time Moses was walking through Egypt to say let my people go Moses didn't come just to bring plagues and yesterday liberation of Israel it was to put an end to the king of Egypt Egypt never recovered when Moses walked out Moses ministry declared the end of Egypt and our ministry will declare the end of this world the fact that we are here this war has taken taken there's a cow known because of us this accountant who had to wait until a ministry like unto Moses like hunter Elijah a people he can wrap all of his word in in this age or somebody preached back to me Moses put the end of a political economic system but this right this elect lady will put an end not just to the political system not just to the economic system but the whole spiritual system is run by the core of this evil each Moses couldn't do it Elijah couldn't do it Jesus didn't want to do it because he knew there was a people that would come after him who were who would be equipped to put an end you may be seated you don't hear me this morning time is running out for sickness oh god help me this morning when Jesus left when Jesus left his ministry had healing in it but when Jesus left people still got sick but describer put an end the sickness itself when this brackets into action yes top cancer yes top diseases that's the prophecy [Applause] [Music] [Applause] number the random said how do we have feet for the rapture if we can't even have feet for divine healing but this bride will not just have fee for divine healing his bride will have power to send cancer we walk into the hospital room shake things up because we're gonna let the devil know all these ages he operated since Adam self this is the group that will be the Vengeance of the Lord right and Satan's Eden right when the lid of Hell opened up in this age with all the filth with all the sin with all the sex Devils with all the pornography with all the evil cholera raise up a generation of people who will preach this gospel because this gospel must be preached and then the end will come and the preaching of the gospel is nothing word only but it's empower and demonstration

tectonic plates knows is happening that's why they are earthquakes they can heal the countdown they can heal the blending some time into eternity they know we are going back to who we were before the fall the earth knows the trees nor the plans nor the animals know that once war sons of God will walk the earth like our until the earth knows that it's master is about to take position what can time

this season we call it as our [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you may be seated we're not done yet No no we are blending in right now we're blending in we are blending in we are blending him you are feeling the effects of activity because eternity wants to step in his rightful place hallelujah hallelujah in the beginning in the midst of the chaos in the midst of the darkness God said let there be light and there was light and time started to tick because God had a plan to reveal certain things from himself he longed to share certain things and when he tried with the Angels they couldn't appreciate it because they couldn't sing amazing grace he always had in his heart we hear the song amazing grace but that song but not Vince all on it that song could not have been seen in eternity at that time if we could place a sliver of time in eternity at that time but eternally nobody could've sing amazing grace but this time when time blends into eternity and we take our position we can walk with Jesus and we can walk with Moses and we can shake amazing grace up any time because we know what it is [Applause] you may be seated no one the Bible will see they'll sing a new song a new song the Angels could only sing a certain kind of song but this routine group of people who tasted time and returned back to God they will sing a new song they will sing of the goodness of Jesus they were singer of who hours long but I was now all I've never seen the righteous forsaken they could think back to that time you may be seated [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody with me everybody feelin fine [Music] [Applause] you'll be up energy for another five hours [Applause] let me give you an illustration in a marathon a marathon runner I'm not speaking here by experience speaking my study has to practice and train together in certain rhythm set momentum and typically what happens is this marathon runner gets into a rhythm in the race some say the average about ten or so come to the mass power and they get into this rhythm because it's a long distance someone's 20 miles or whatever it is you can be speeded up in the middle of this long distance but but no matter how long you've been running in a marathon when you see the finish line come into view something happens from somewhere deep within no matter how long you were running and not matter the rhythm of the piece all of a sudden the sight of the finish line allows you to train another gear that you didn't want to use before because if we use that gear too soon you will run out the energy before you reach the finish line so a good marathon runner knows to conserve that topo to hold back that until the finish line is in view and when you need it because he said a third pole will be there when you need it when the finish line is there then the oh god help me there's a pose of the line where you don't worry about who's next to you you don't worry about who's at the side of you you don't worry about how long the journey was you don't think back to where you even started you just want to make it over [Applause] [Music] you may be seated and the sight of the finish line brings a level of energy and an acceleration of ripening salvation of speeded can we type it in the message and when you push over there something you don't even know who else was around you because your hours on the finish line but even if your first second or tilde this race is not for the Swift it's for those who could cross over no wonder the Prophet says when you make it there and you finally lift your head up you'll be surprised at who has made it you'd be surprised who has a turtle brought over the finish line when your strength is done the turtle comes to make sure that you can run all the way somebody give out a shout of praise [Applause] everybody feeling fine so time is running out time is running out on the economy time is running out on the education system [Music] time is running out on the medical system because when the random told us to get in before the terrible horrible plague strike the judgement pleased that the doctors don't know nothing about men rotting in their flesh and all the terrible judgment is that where the balancing will come from watching TV and from women who cut their hair and the judgment would come because of that that's what we are preparing for that's what the world is preparing for friends only the bride that elected lady makes the rapture there will be many in the message who don't make the rapture and they have a three-and-a-half-year still within time tribulation period and in that time cannot buy or sell unless they take the mark there's a mark that identifies that they are part of the system that they are part of this economy that's run by the devil that the systems and the laws and the legislation already moving into that gear and people still want to come to church as if it's an ordinary of fear when whether Brown said the bride will be a hunted persecuted hunted persecuted group if it can handle that no easy time fetus a are not ice and every because that is how it was over the ages are you a

there they've got to come [Music] [Applause] time is running out when time runs out you may be seated could we talk some more can we fellowship some more just have a few examples just how the Prophet would do it just take a few examples God was so sick of the sin in Sodom and Gomorrah that he hit the clock himself poop inside a cone known to destroy that abomination that was Sodom and Gomorrah God is no respecter of person so the sin the stench of it disturbed him he couldn't leave it the way it was he had to do something about it the same way like in the days of Noah God repented he made man because they're very thinking he said was evil continually except for this man called Noah who found favor grace in the eyes of God so God came down and hit the stop watch on Signum they didn't know that they were going to come to an end but judgment was already on the earth judgment was already walked into them and they didn't know it I think of people sometimes who leave their homes and they never make it back home they did not know that day was their deed he left that do you think it would be like any other day but their time run out normal living going about their business as it was in the taste of Noah's it wasn't it is a lot people not realizing that their number has been called they're studying they're in school they're teaching their work and they're traveling they're driving worried about this worried about that worried about the other worried about the ambitions their careers how people see them their status worried about how people see them in their families how people see them in their neighborhoods have people seen them in the church and they miss that time has run out and it's a knocking for answer their call to answer their call to give an account and God comes down to Abraham's Abram you are my man only it and because man has dominion over the edge this is our jurisdiction I will let you know what's about to happen once there's a Sun in place on the earth God speaks to that Sun I will let you know what's about to happen just like when the Prophet was here and a young girl was about to die and God could have stopped her if he wanted to he is sovereign he's omnipotent but there's a man only it who isn't pleased who's in position she said brother Branham if you pray if you pray I need to be activated by your prayers I have the power but I need somebody to make a request how'd the check have the account but somebody got a sign and I put here for a purpose if you pray she could get the help that she needs and welcome to have a conversation without with with Abraham around letting you know I've come down to judge and Abraham as a true son Abraham you may be see they're gonna be like is he that worthless lot tell em you know tell him who elephant stupidness he is not listening and you know what I'm born is born that he did give him downs already you make your bed you lie in it and that's how some of us are lost the burden lost the love we forget how God delivered us and we quick to judge other people [Music] some of us so selfish we don't even testify on somebody testify to you Abraham had a choice we always have a choice god never takes away the ability to choose from us because it's part of what makes us who we are anyone say but lord if there be 50 because I have family there this wasn't even this wasn't even Abraham's son honor this is a an area relative fitness some of us Cassie beyond archeron we can't seize uuu anyone to China it forget the body forget the extension forget the fact that listen God come in to read in my hand and I use the body coming for some of us are so selfish we don't keep what anybody else nobody's talking you don't have an individual Buddha video a desire for your own walk with God that's that's necessary but oh gosh reach out to somebody now pray for somebody else Allah why don't you pray for somebody else lord I coming to you again you know I need money you know I need a guy I don't need a host you know I need healing you know I'm your daddy hold pray pray for one wasn't it but but ever said real Christianity is living for who others would Jesus tell pizza boy pizza watch nah RRL pray for myself you know Peter I pray for you that your feet don't feel you say anybody can say you're not praying for you know that God will take it a next level I've trained figure that that whatever you're dealing with right now board this one it's not that I'm not gonna be up a preen for you you know I know we're talking about I am praying for you and for me to be praying for you know they have to be something wrong with you that's not what I'm talking about then what out of love whatever Budin out of hearing or to be insensitive to what somebody else is going true you catch up button to pray for somebody because you want them to make it you don't want your family alone you want as many as possible to make it can the church say Amen [Applause] is this helping anybody this morning so Sodom ran out of time and they didn't even know it this issue of time running out I'm not gonna be too much longer with you the manor the Pool of Bethesda for 38 years he had been coming there looking for change at a certain season abhava said the angel would stir the waters and whoever jumped in first would get a healing you know that my about this brother he didn't even have a chance to get into the pool because when Jesus interviewed him he said I have no man to put me in so even if he wanted to go and he couldn't go in himself but he didn't stop coming but the time for his sickness and his disease have come to an end when Jesus stepped in there that take his hits for 38 years had reached to heaven and Jesus couldn't come for everybody him to read to him will Darby meet her and the time for his suffering and he was delivered come to church Samer running out of time [Applause] can you take some more Jesus tired so tired the Bible said they had to carry him to the boat that character the board was not Jesus let's go we carry me three both know the word carry in the original translation literally meant to lift I want you to picture this sight Almighty God and flesh so tired they had to lift him into the boat that he was sleeping so tired I when the storm came he was still sleeping some of us the moment we hear a snap we wake up storm coming you'd ever saw something out of the ordinary but the devil didn't understand that there was a man on the other side time had run out for the demon that were chaining him time had run out for that spirit upon him and when they made it to the other side you know the story Jesus stepped on the shore on t minus minutes Jesus walked to that man and cast those Devils out and that man was never the same again because his time had come the papper said he got in his right mind he was so convinced that he wanted to follow Jesus you said no don't follow me go testify go tell somebody what happened to you because they will believe your report because they knew how messed up you were but your time of deliverance has come and through your life god knows what will unveil because he knew it has to be good to take you out of that situation go preach the gospel or tell somebody time I'm not gonna be too much longer this morning but Abraham said now remember one word from him will mean more than I could speak in a hundred lives and I pray this morning one word from God will touch your heart and a real permanent weight and you could see that there's no more time to play Church there's no more time to play games is only time for you to get the Holy Ghost there's only time for you to repent there's only time for to make things right there's only time to to come to the altar to see a Lord I don't want to go home the seamer that I came in the message expectation believe I said friend without the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm afraid we haven't got very much time left I'm afraid of always near won't you come now and be save and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost won't you do it right now this afternoon while we have plenty of time can the church say in the message the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride but the Branham said now in Ephesians 1:10 and it's just a later context in there it's called now if you're putting it down Ephesians 1:10 is call not a dispensation not the 7-day it's called the fullness of time when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled so time itself is on a mission time itself has a limit time cannot go beyond what has been allocated for it because God already knows the exact point that time will blend into eternity in fact the Bible says here to cut to work short let's not be saved so he is watching time very closely to make sure that some individuals make it and he's prepared to cut the work short to ensure that you get the Holy Ghost that's the definition for the pride of making it now holy goes all the way to adoption time the church savor the Pentecost ribbon of messages we have an expectation God has laid for us and when the fullness of time has come and that's when time has been fulfilled when there's normal time then you go into eternity after the seven church it is over and it is but a plan I'm already taught what it is finish the blending has already started that's why when God drops the anointing in here eternity dropping down to give you a taste of what you will experience that's why every day that come in by the Bremen said as we near the head storm it should be a super Church a super Ray's as we near the head storm because we are planning into eternity where does that put your career what does it put your job where does that put your fussing on you're stewing and your arguments and your deep beats when he turned into you suppose that Hannah time is finished can the church seem and looters it is over as a prophet Methodist ages over Pentecostal ages over and now you go into what eternity no more sevens no more threes no more other very eternity where there is no such time as numbers and things and times you see it now tell the church say Amen everybody with me now after time has been fulfilled listen carefully all sin is gone so as time runs out it means sin also runs out somebody preach back to me when time runs out sin is finished all sin is gone taken away at the Millennium at the great white throne judgment a type by Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost after the world is on fire and baptize its baptism of holy fire from heaven all sinners gone listen to the prophet or germs is gone all devils is gone all temptations is gone all evil is gone then what does God do he can sit upon the earth see because all sin is gone so only when all sin is gone could God sit upon the earth everybody with me this morning we're not eating cereal this morning we chopped in some meteor this morning we cut in some meat and some steak here this morning because we know what we are called to do we understand where we're going with understanding our expectations so that's the same now so better been finished explaining what's happening with now God wants to have preeminence he wants a sit on the earth but he can't sit because the earth is not holy he is a holy God yes it's a holy throne he was suspended with the holy people so something has happened to transform it against the holy it that His Majesty his glory can sit comfortably so before he can sit sin must be finished sickness must be finished germs must be finished disease must be finished lying but we finished Holly his son must be finished adultery must be finished political systems finish economic systems finish only one economic system that's his system run by the currency of fate somebody help me this mornin no more politics our kingdom no more president of Prime Minister our king a king of kings a lot of lords what he says goes he is king we are sons we are royalty we are getting back to that somebody in war a shout of praise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] dear you are solely assumptions you are sons who are soldiers angels are also silver soldiers but you are some soldiers you our commanders in just obey your instructions or come on now somebody tweets back to me you are so less than you are sons you are princess we and I wasn't lead the charge of angels oh come on somebody help me this morning here in its mighty men come on somebody happy this morning no wonder the Devils are afraid of you because you are not angels angels are servants and angels have power but you here on this earth this is over 2 million this is our jurisdiction [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated that's why the spiritual realm they recognize who you they don't understand who we are but once you get into position they know you they know you so when the sons of sceva trying to do change they say who Paul I know pizza we know about it who are you because these songs were in position here reputation that word is different we respect those guys we listen to the scouts when they tell us move remove because they have influence on the earth in the spiritual realm the spiritual things of God and that's what we are striving for because builders were placed in their season and time and we are striving to be placed in our season before a terrible plague strike because when they strike it will take sons of God to instruct those Devils get out of that house pants a demon get out of my wife get out of my children get out of my family [Applause] some soldiers just like their father behave like their father talk like their father you may be seated what's the context everybody with me this morning if you want an anointed I'm anointed my energy work I like feeling strong I when I started but asked me did I go to 6:00 p.m. today how could even call me up blending from time into eternity only gonna wait to knit it feels like oh is it a tea instead it feels good enough because of eternity restore my tiredness because someone is too much in time you feeling tired but come on a tyrant is eternity where time is no more joy unspeakable no more crying no more pills no more mortgage no more traffic to move by a thought where you need to be a thinker than your there because taxi that's how eternity is like listen you ever seen it with a brand-new wife said to him when you got think until you say you preach about it but you don't even know what it is so even the Prophet with all of his revelation didn't even catch some magnitude of what eternity is like oh god help us your prints are powders we have no idea how good it is and we are blending from time into eternity [Music] [Applause] you may be seated [Music] when Jesus was here he was in a physical body living in time but it was eternity trapped in time because God is eternal he was using a body but it was eternity God him shall shaft in a time body but it was eternity nonetheless somebody help me this morning and God once again it's about to step into individuals who will be eternity trapped in time because that's how the rapture can take place because one eternity could be in the rapture or claw help us that's why it'll be on the inside coming out eternity has to be in you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and the church team and the Ministry of the fivefold ministry will be taking part eternal life that's the greatest gift that even ever get because eternal life means you are truly connected to who you were in the thoughts of God never had a beginning never has been evening you are creature from eternity just like Jesus you committed time to prove to the devil that there could be more like him come unto the earth and take the test of time the test of time because time itself is a test you may be seated Oh hallelujah this helps somebody to break free now you can understand why true worship comes not from the things of this temporal claim but it comes from your eternal destiny an eternal calling an eternal position and no wonder pork has hit death where is your sting grave where is your victory because it opened up to him that even though he was born in that time he was really come from eternity and that awareness made him realize that if I drop this physical body that's not the end of me if I drop this physical body that's not who I am I'm inside his house God chose this house as a temporary holding place as a temporary house [Applause] you may be seated but with sin and time came the senses of the mind imagination in reasoning conscience affection these emotions and The Devil's playground was allow in your mind to try to distract you with the education and the politics and the news and the dissonant that and every time you come to church it's a reminder of your eternal call your eternal destination and the fact that you are here to restore the balance as it were because Satan in heaven The Herald but we were represented there and we kicked him out there and because we were represented they were hooking them on their core dispatch us here to finish the work that was kicked out in heaven he take the same agents that were represented by angelic beings in heaven Oh somebody help me responded who had experience fightin with Michael their belt experienced fightin with Michael to take the dragon out you may be seasoned [Applause] you may be seated but because the devil fell from that existence he cannot recall the agents who fought with Michael he cannot identify them and he has been on the lookout ever since because he understands the realm of this world and he understand the realm of the natural so when Jesus was here if thou be the Son of God a commission of inquiry started to find out if this was one of them who had kicked him out in heaven and Jesus never gave him the privilege Jesus yes was that obligated to answer he just took Scripture and responded with Scripture because our Authority we don't answer to Devils we command Devils we don't order devil an answer we command him you may be seated you may be seated [Applause] [Music] you'd be seated this plan was so articulate this plan verse what defined that you know when the US Army that was a step into an area the center reconnaissance team an investigative team the land usually is the Marines would go first to mix one set up because the ships have to come this guy just pull up on the shore yes so they got to secure the area so jesus said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the gospel to open the eyes of the brighter comforter that morning and he stopped just before the acceptable year of the Lord because he was the first part of the mission the acceptable year of the Lord was the Royal Army the whole pride the people who were called by his name that he would multiply himself in when they arrived it will not the ending of time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated I love this being said this morning gonna have to listen to the tape again and rejoice because I'm identifying by Scripture and by the prophets message who you are and why you kind of live in a can around you kind of live in the realm of sin and openness and gossip and backbiting you are more than that you're bigger than that you know cause for that kind of nonsense you are sons you are tortoise you are kings you are priests you [Applause] [Music] you may be seated we preach this before my oh we really need to attain our demons have no power unless they get people to work through angels have no power unless I get people to operate through that's why the Holy Ghost is looking for vessels just as the devil is looking for vessels there's a dimensional distinction that exists between the realm of heaven earth and underneath and we preach about an Easter last year I believe said God Almighty God wanted to intervene in the affairs of Man so he sent representatives that's what Abraham was just what was who's because the effect the affairs of men it has to be a kinsman it must be a man to affect the affairs of men because man was given Dominion jurisdiction power authority control over the earth the angels - that have that God Himself controls the heaven and everything Sharon but he gives man this earth you may be seated sort of affected affairs of man when God was comfortable with the Ministry of every prophet of every judge of every leader he said this in another manner but this man will not be like those men this man will not be like Joshua this man will not be like David this man will not make a mistake this man will not sin this man will not be born through sin is gonna be born through sex this man has to be a brother to my children he must be a father to my children he must be a king to my people you may be seated and to intervene in the affairs of Man God had to end morphe himself change himself transform himself in the realms of heaven you walked into the secret chamber and when he changed himself he found himself in the womb of Mary to go to the process because Adam had bypass the process but this brother to us this kinsman to us could not bypass the process you may be seated anybody sleeping everybody with me this morning you've ever seen it uh it's one the devil didn't know he was there I did too the devil didn't know he was there and it's 10 the devil didn't know he was there so secretive was this mission so perfect was this plan so ordain was this operation that when Jesus finally stepped out it was so subtle you may be seated that John the Baptist whose primary purpose was to identify this Messiah had to ask himself are you the one or should we look for another so secretive was this intervention that Jesus still didn't answer him he said tell John that the sicker healed tell John that the blind eyes are open tell John he will know what I mean that the limo walking tell John that the Thomas speaking John will know what that means he will know that a greater than Solomon is here he will know that Messiah is on the earth even though that the one who will baptize with fire just calm down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated and all the while this is going on from since Genesis to this time the devil is thinking he has one he has the upper hand but God's great clock is counting down God's great clock is just ticking it's just ticking it's just ticking just take him and even when Jesus was here we preached this before he had yet another mystery another ministry because Adam was not supposed to die Adam was not supposed to get sick Adam as a creature of eternity place here on this earth was never sick never weak never tired never depressed God himself had to fix that situation but he couldn't go in a form he was in heaven he couldn't go as Jesus the only entry into the lower realms was true death [Music] so in Jesus in Matthew 16 when he was having this great conversation it was the first time he was revealing with clarity with distinction without hesitation with a loofa interpretation who he was he started with a question who do men say I am because he wants to reveal something to them but he wants to settle their questions you want to make sure he knew where they were he said what do men say I am and his brothers pull out their notepads some cui lies because we know your noisette son see you are like Jeremiah some and The Herald of good things to say you may be seated and then Jesus checked him he said I'm a Mac your papers no it's easy to give somebody else testimony but who do you say you've been with me all along you've been in the message all along you've been here and you've been seeing you've been tasting you been experiencing but who do you say I am and those brothers couldn't move and then Peter see throw out the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus still to him and say you didn't figure that out young man you didn't figure that out son blood nobody told it is but my father in heaven give you a revelation and upon that rock of Revelation that's what I build my church on I call you by revelation I call your name by revelation you may be seasoned could you take someone everybody feeling fine the Deacons have things under control along says anybody sleeping it's a simple let me know somebody's getting delivered today you know I don't doubt it one minute doubt it for one second today's a day your time has come that time for the Devon hauling you has run out we are declaring time has run out time has run out this is revival time manifestation time right time seed time adoption time you may be seated [Applause] [Music] and when Jesus died the last part of his mission because time is running out Jesus transformed himself to be able to enter into Satan's headquarters all the Devils who were sent up to investigate who this Jesus was have returned back to base because the problem seemingly had been eliminated Jesus was dead but a band said the bride the messing with her like it's washed up the mess it will look like it's finished the mess will look all messed up brother Adam said that and it's within that time God is really performing a work that was hidden under the Seventh Seal because it say I will cannot know what it is but the Branham taught us well you may be said the devil couldn't push did anything but he see the Seventh Seal he doesn't even know what it is he cannot figure it out this is beyond his education level is intellectual gymnastics he does not know what's under there the seven scene himself I drop down and knock on the door and when he entered there with a pop well those brothers you see what that looks like the wheel in the middle of the wheel that's what a prophet said that looked like the rock we need to rock that will look like the Greek Shepherd that looks like who kept Mina and the devil took and Jesus rather took the keys of death and hell you know what it is you may be seated to be in charge of a jail and it all the keys you ready have to have a second self of self wood to wake up every morning and go to work the minor prison and you ready keys you walk around town as you say scare people to keep them there you can keep them there at any point in time you could somebody could kick it open and you have no power to stop them you have no power and you know anything is when one person go free and the other people recognize her with now hold on [Applause] he out where we live and when I next one come out you see with them brothers and sisters you can come out to them you can come at their prisoner you can walk out of it today no today today today today house of hell give way to the name of Jesus that's why the prophets that you can go free if you want to go free and who the Son of man set free is what is one get another soda praise somebody give God a shout of praise I'm almost finished musicians get ready we are carry to leave this place I'm still excited I've here we are planning some time and eternity I believe that catching a revelation of who we are where we come from where we are going [Applause] [Music] hallelujah my give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion give me that all-time preaching hallelujah you may be seasoned hito was so anointed but because listen time was not yet fulfilled he couldn't go to the rapture that's the power of time because to everything there's a timed every purposes a time is a season every time so nothing happened before it's time we preached before the people in the days of Wesley was so sanctified that the Holy Ghost wanted to pour out upon them because the sanctified life attracts the Holy Ghost so the Deacons were the Reimann and that they had a bucket of water right next to them and they were on the lookout so now whenever somebody got so anointed because of our chat in the Holy Ghost their mission was a true water on them to calm them down because the season was not yet it will be a years afterwards in God's clock ticking down that when Seymour would come and see the season has arrived I believe the seasons arrive and then the Holy Ghost poured out in the losers revival because a season unchanged somebody please back to me he may be seated God is counting now he is taken out time is running out and all of a sudden God said I can't restore it all yet because I have to send a prophet because over the years they lost certain things but I want to send not pack power I want to send all the power all that God was he put it to Christ and all that Christ was he pours into the church but in order listen carefully forgot to pull all of the spirit all of the wood has to be restored because the word is the conductor of the Spirit now depending on how big the conductor is is how much power could go through that conductor if the wire is this small only that much power to come through and over the years they had the wire or hoe because all the worries that restored so I said when a power would come and they would have an anointing but it was not sustainable but when the prophet came it was a line upon line precept upon precept all the loose ends from Genesis to Revelation in the written word was now being tied up by the Ministry of the revealed word because these son of man himself had stepped into his son of man so it was not brother Branham tying up the loose ends but it was Jesus Christ himself in another time the Lord himself had descended with a shout to allow his power he wasn't taking chances Holloman to do this somebody please back to me why you will receive him because through the Old Testament he had talked about I will be their God and He will be my people that was a different type of relationship this relationship was not people and God this was husband and wife thing [Applause] this was man and wife thing so God is not this is not court and people think this is relationship thing I'm going to say I a taking chances with no man to man having my wife I am coming on myself I was slipping here and there the whisper loves secrets to her to let her know that I love her let's unknown shoulda woulda slipped something in there so when the Prophet come good evening friends it was caught himself slipping in secrets for his bride who only she could understand what he was saying people were sitting there in Indiana sitting there in Arizona sitting there in New York sitting there in California but he was speaking to one person his bride he was speaking to one person his lady come to church say man everybody feelin fine do you know who you are you may be seated in the meantime time is Compton now 65 prophet leaves have seen and this is the age the season the time go to the reason for because when the Prophet left the angel did not leave the angel is here but I ran up said fixing these around for the coming of the Lord so the angel in 65 66 67 68 69 all these years moving things around shifting things around hunting down people some people were just to get you to know who you are they won't even part of who the bride was they were just there to carry the message the way the Prophet said it so that you would be here we were not here when the Prophet was here but thank God but those who he used to get to usher because the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready I'm trying to close out but as soon you get ready I Got News for you there's a wedding did you ever hear what a wedding without a date it's only mad people getting married without it the way people are not winning in my gamer so you want to tell me Almighty God who put the Stars in place and the sun and please any move to know when your wedding is he knows the exact time when the bridesmaids will walk up because butter bombs talk about it he said those who will be the outer part of the city nice bridesmaid but is he inside the city that is bright inside the city thanks Brian he knows exactly when the bride will walk up and that wedding will take place and the wedding supper will take place as we plan from Tim into eternity friends the hour is at hand time is running out you're gonna play something softly [Music] I'm finished I want to leave you with something there's something softly in a message lifting him out of history as you get ready to close out but the band said we are standing tonight upon the brim and watching come to pass and unfold to great scenes and both to great scenes are these one of them is the ending of history and by the ending of history he means a closing of the pages of the written word what has been foretold and the other one is the ending of time and many great men through the ages has longed to see this power that we are now approaching and as we live in this glorious setting of mortal Sun and the breaking of the eternal light I do feel as we are living in one of the grandest ages that ever man has been permitted to live because it's a closing out of time and the blending in of eternity history only tells us what we have read what has been and what's in the future is in the hand of God or Pentecostal or Pentecostal in the messages once more Lord run for your life there's just a little time left it's later than you think if I never see another word from this pulpit and that's how I feel this morning remember run for your life it's later than you think I feel

it's gotten and these brittle threads that you're walking on talking about your life it's gonna break honey and your poor helpless soul what's gonna happen to you time shall be no more time will then blend into eternity the handwriting on the wall a scientific proof they're trying to get to the more like they didn't babble on everything is repeating the God of heaven can't hold his peace any longer it's time when I don't know but it's time it's later than you think won't you just know under conviction if you feel that you've been wrong I don't care how long you belong to this Tabernacle I don't care how long you've belonged to your church how many times just poking with tongues how many times you dance in the spirit if you could still see the world hanging on you come here just a
