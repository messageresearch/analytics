this is what the devil wanted you know this is what Lucy Coe wanted he wanted to be worshipped that's what he want he wants in worship oh my if he couldn't handle not be worship but the worship was the god that's what God put in her heart so moist and three it was all about worship amen so before we the scriptures this morning our testimony I'd like to share with you what I came back from the funeral there was a message on the answering machine a church machine and somebody called and they wanted to share testimony about what I don't know a person and so on and they wanted to share the discovers on the Internet and I began to connect and God bless them and it was talking about the Ghana meetings or the presence of God came into their home I just wanted to read this year god bless you but over after speaking with you you asked me to speak so I asked the person to write give a testimony write it out write it to the church so they wrote that ministry at his hometown Minako and she said after sticking with you you asked me to speak of the goodness of God in my life and I was thinking of how best to do that since after close examination God's grace his love his tenderness and gentleness and leadership has become more and more expansive in retrospect how to summarize the grace of God how to truly tell of his love for me I didn't realize how much God loved me until I had to do this thank you for moving with God's inspiration to encourage me to testify as I had fallen more in love with Christ I grew up with a message my life had his usual ups and down I was on my mary secured christian life I got married had my kids was holding on a job just waitin for the Lord to come however in 2012 God move in a sovereign hand creating the right atmosphere for the first time in my life I knew I met the Living Christ my life changed completely God was so real to me and I become so hungry spiritually although I knew the message Church took a new meaning its service I would go to here was a new discovery of Christ I could find out I started to get loads of the sermons to study on a week not knowing that God was forming a habit in me that would later all become so critical the Lord encouraged me and my family for the next few years by spiritual experiences dreams and even sending songs of deliverance I mean lyrics as well as the melody well whoa I thought surely this is the correct path soon the baptism of the Holy Ghost will fall this is what she sponsored in a heart okay then remote 2015 while examining the sermon notes I started to note a deviance from the truth of the message what it must be human error mistakes again and again not in proper context with what the Prophet was saying church began to become a chore a very very difficult chore the only conclusion was an ester in time was upon me and my family to me this was confirmed by a dream which I believe came from the Lord of how I was outside of the church I was attending eaten juicy rich foods in East because I had to join a powerful move of God that was about to take place in East of Trinidad this is a dream that she had and I had to be do in the dream the feeling was urgent well God made that place of worship so uncomfortable my family with many small prickles so much my husband got fed up that not even the ABCs of the church order was being followed he stopped going to church period he became bitter as not even the pastor was concerned enough to go after a fallen sheep well I was to learn that this was the norm I had kids still went until October 2016 when we just couldn't take it no more I heard a sermon which in my opinion put the Ministry of the bride in the tribulation period enough no one must trampled or mishandle or dislocate the Word of God Wow whoever sisters arrived at as good he had suffered enough no one is carrying me to the jubilation that is totally against the voice of God when I was a child which told me that with such conviction and so audibly D without us canna be made perfect I know I have a part to play in this endtime work of God so we left that congregation no looking back of course my dear parents couldn't understand I tried to explain as the best as I could I am loyal to wanting and wanting only the word of God not any man or Church love that kind of believer I want to be under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and him alone I don't want any man's inspiration or so-called ministry a pastor can be deceived what ministry the only vindicated ministry was brother branham's and I can't and I won't believe that only place that truth mine you're a hundred percent truth was being preached was the church I no longer want any part of I know I was moving with the Holy Spirit and was not as the pastor put it having a lack of revelation because I was leaving the place of life that is where the seven thunders was being preached I refuse to believe that the old point of the Holy Ghost adoption will happen in that church since that church alone is looking for adoption then go out to the rest of the bride ensuring that I can't believe that a pastor canonical mistake and I won't ignore the Mystics against the word and follow his ministry I am seeing seducing spirits boluses in Jezebel Legion Nicollet ISM and denomination this is a sister they not even a minister Wow of course this is this was blasphemy to them I guess I was scared yes timid a big coward yes but God had established listen listen God had established his love in my heart and I just couldn't say no to his leading the assistant pastor visited and tried to find out our grievances and promised to sort things out he tried the voice of God was calling us to totally different direction than when we were heading we stepped out in blind faith no was our time of trying where to go the fellowship what to do now what about tithing and communion how to guide the family since my husband not even going to church I practically give up his spiritual role as head of the family but God is faithful we as a family had to go to this backside of the desert time we rested not realize how drained malnourished equipped we were spiritually we prayed and filled we fasted and filled we had no choice but to rely on God alone from the time we left the church till now God has been leading us to different resources every clue dewitt Bible based teaching Rabbi Jonathan Cahn with Messiah Jewish teaching the message of the Prophet William Branham with fresh new eyes and the Word of God my kids and I visited other message churches when we felt so starved of lack of fellowship during this time we all knew it was wasn't satisfying enough my sister was so supportive at this time we both experienced the same life-changing events but she hadn't left the church we used to call each other almost every day excited to share what manner will receive from the Lord we were removed from the shaky foundation we were on our established and our solid rock got trained us to examine on every side what we heard dreamt experienced and felt with the Word of God I love that train to examine every single thing by the Word of God and I used to tell her girls time to pluck up some of some feathers and we would change by the Word of God last year she sent me this sermon preached in India named there's a fivefold ministry yet and brother that set our souls on fire since God was showing us the same thing sometime before talk about confirmation and God was leading us right we felt so excited that a message preached I was preaching these things who is this person so during 2017 we started to listen to sermons preached by a brother Tieh ovid examining what he said with the Bible we would go up on message search find the coach he used making sure he was seen exactly what the Prophet said ensuring the context was current we couldn't chance our souls and the soldier or kids I love that this a person examine was been preached not even a church and they're going to him he amen that's a true believer for me that's all I want you in the word hallelujah praise God so so far my sister and I have found your teaching strong and steady on the message on the world we have learned from the Simmons we heard many times we got the answers to questions we had or more light was shed on doctrine that we were not quite sure of remember I had no one to ask no husband to guide me and cheering looking for guidance isn't our God great he has truly provided something happened with the two summers I listened to you that you preached and Gannon last month I felt the anointing of the meetings came through the computer screen and was in my home I was rejoicing with the congregation as if I was dear my god this is all church is supposed to be my family life has definitely changed since that sermon played it's as if a corner has turned the other sermon drove me to my knees and I called out the Lord what is the next step for this answer - keep praying and I do believe it was sent when you said you are from the tribe of Judah as I am from the tribe of Issachar and two of these drives make up the first wave of the army of God that good fought into the battles in numbers 10 I am sure I want to share the lyrics of one of the songs of deliverance that Lord sent and hope this message a heart a lovely melody fit but these are the words the army of the lion I feel the noise the noise of marching feet the noise of marching feet on the horizon I hear the song a mighty trumpet song the song of the army of the lion roar lion roar Thunder out your voice turned out your voice before you army I feel the wind rushing wind going before the army of the Lamb I see them dressed in clothes of righteousness shining with the armor of the lion the enemy is afraid the uname is afraid of the little army of the land the enemy is afraid the enemy is afraid of the marching of the army of the lion I see them run like mighty horses run the way the Eden's garden I hear them speak the language of the Lord are two it sort of cuts them all the nations I watch them climb like arrows of the Lord if it is walls and not a barrier prisoners cry out because they have been set free by the mighty power of the Lamb I see them stand upon the wood of God standing with the land of the army I see them rise high above the world sought shouting out the victory of the lion go reach the best of you your sister in Christ she sister Joanna oh praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning there are people listening there are people blessed and if there's anyone listened this morning and you want to send a test on my test we appreciate it and we be honored know that oh I give up the right to cut people off I give up my right you know people to cut people off cut them off and whatnot we have no username we have no password if Pope Francis want to take a listen you know can listeners and it's testimony but anybody who's ever will could listen and be blessed isn't that wonderful but one thing I know this fivefold ministry but a Branham says the elect gonna hear from the pasta from the teacher from the Evangelist that ministry will be international it wouldn't just be a local ministry it will be speaking to the entire world the bright buddy is not wonderful and what it will be it will be the ministry of Jesus Christ so let's all stand as we want to change the order of service and let's say God is so good because he is that's me just [Music] won't God his song God our God with so yes Olga too I love him so oh and now so so [Music] son for his soul amen this morning if every Bible I can return to Colossians chapter 1 we want to read from verse 16 to 19 first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 1 verse dear and Mark 16:15 to 20 read in Colossians chapter 1 verse 16 to 19 god bless you again and welcome welcome to all there's some prayer questions stuff we'll deal with after the service for by him all things for by him we're all things created that on heaven and earth on it is visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit our last scripture is from st. mark ridden from sin mark 16 ridden from verse 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up in the air and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following email let's pray father we thank you for your Holy Word Lord come now and breed fire upon it Lord make it alive and may the word become flesh among us that the invisible can become visible in Jesus and we ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise the Lord well this morning our title it's like a prophecy but it's it's the word when the power of discharge Rises that's the title when the power of this church Rises I have a subject the head of the body the church I have an inspiration and I want you to ponder it in your heart because this is what we want to say to God Lord you promised it that's all Lord you promised it you promised Eiland you promised deliverance you put mr. Brasher don't forget how you feel just remind god of what he promised because God is not a manner with life he can't promise you healing and o'healey oh he got probably deliverance under deliver you he kept promised the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not giving the Holy Ghost he kept promises his children coming back and they're not coming back he can't like what you promised it or give the Lord a shout that's my inspiration is morning Lord you promised it hallelujah so we see how it go relax yourself in the presence of God in the house of God will even look at your clock if you see me looking at - don't look at yours sometimes just a habit could be a bad habit sometimes is a habit forget it alright from blushin prophets vertebra is pray our Heavenly Father I bought his altar upon this altar uh knocks forgiveness for my sin I asked forgiveness of the sins of duels that are on the altar I ask forgiveness for this church for the body of believers nationally and internationally I ask for mercy for us being so dilatory and that word dilatory is being slow unhurried Toddie unpunctual lacks slack sluggish sluzzle slugga be sneer like taught us like Lisl idle thoughtful I said what that word means he said concerning the things of the kingdom I asked that you pardon us of our sins and take away our transgression forgive us for being so stupid for the stupidity of the people how we have come short how we have taken body exercise how we have done things that we ought not to have done how we have sinned before you what a prayer who is praying that a prophet not not faithful not some pasta in some place somewhere a prophet asking God for mercy asking for forgiveness not even just which church but even internationally because he knew he was sent to call out a bride not an American bride a bride from around the world behold I send you Elijah to the entire world and he will turn your hearts back to the feet of the Father Lord you promised it I want you to say it Lord Rama said oh poor glory to God and this is what I get here he said bring your song lead an altar need a song fall fresh on me Holy Spirit say brother Branham no and never service I know we in the beginning but we started by the end away yet right here now he said bring your song leader to lead a song for fresh on me Holy sprit don't care I do I'm going to stand right here Lord I'm on your hand

may they put the house in order right now may everything be set there maybe there are Christians but it just they have lived under this so long seeing so many things they lost the value of it they take it lightly instead of with deep sincerity Oh God let us check up tonight grant it knowing that these great things are only warning us of the soon rapture in church and if we are laden with sin with unbelief and with struffolis we shall not make that rapture we know it Lord we pray that you will burn into us the Holy Ghost daang into our hearts well God set our souls on fire how many want

this way ever since I so wanted to see what the tape says I'm not my preaching and a preacher model potent but I couldn't to him you might know that because I didn't want anybody to challenge me ever on something that why you see that no has to be in a word I remember but a Judith calm I gave a testimony of going to the brown on top on aqua I'm gonna bad I'm tell the ministers to tell the people how to receive the Holy Ghost and they had a meeting to tell the minister that unbroken went to it and the ministers was telling people when you believe the message you have the Holy Ghost : tell them that nobody prophecy man tell about come on stay along you boy to learn something now is he and buy a hunt who eating to believe a bus driver and a meal man they believe they never they believe them guys was over on the Prophet and here the point I want to make you know you could find where it is written he said that he said when you believe the message you have the Holy Ghost so people could call that as they call in God but what is the context of him saying that though that is where you have whole truth full truth he was saying that any context of these Pentecostals that claim to have an experience so he was saying to them if you claim to have the Holy Ghost the world that I'm preaching is from the Holy Ghost so to confirm you have the Holy Ghost received with a time preaching so I see the evidence of having the holy ghost is to believe and receive the message so you take that and run that you know people saying well I believe message so I have the Holy Ghost oh yeah next dude and jihad see the new birth is a revelation that is true you could find that but you also find the new boot is an experience not the one emphasized the experience because the experience is too complex

condition is over your depression is over your frustration is over because power is here now the power that in the church is rising powers coming into the church but what this time Paulito prayer powerful in a holy life powered overcome power does he forgive me power does he I'm sorry power to be sanctified I haven't reached half the message here what we're gonna plan on Oh glory to God so butter bottom says I'll prove the Antichrist spirit tries to take a people and call him from organization to organization organizing them together which never was the will of God people has always first at me because I struck so hard at organization it isn't the people in there I am try cannot it's that here we go it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think we are the people that is the arrogance we are right and you are wrong no better tell me he in front your head on me I said brother I'm coming as fast as I could I'm gonna get there now you see he said well we appreciate car take us in a rapture I say taught the virtues have to take you say I didn't know it was a Brigitte if if what we preach and supposedly rapture we should we'll have to all know is 50 years you're not tired but what the prophecy is this being when it's completed is the servant of God and the Church of God that's going the rapture if his preaching then he found a dose and a chance because in that region he is famine talk word uneducated he mushy smile miss his friend overhead soup because God has done he had to collect mysteries Christ is the mystery of God we see well whatever being revealed has to produce Christ he say after season his Sam's in the books whatever it has to produce Christ Paula Lewis as I said in mysteries has to be converted to virtues debugger anyhow you're still a width linear Abbott Hall Robert going on a holy other weight writer he's spinning around spin around here come right order we inferences I know brother years you show me season his soul there's no need for the baptism of Holy Ghost now forget I listening a spiritual yeah because he will pop the word and he's in season his soul and what he dropping up on the people's a quarter gram said you could have the button while he goes and be lost you could have it for 24 hours a day and still be lost okay that's what the Prophet said but what is the context he could get baptized in your body you could get baptized in your spirit you could get baptized in your soul just like the new body is a revelation I knew was an experience I will ask which one comes is not revelation only know which one comes first revelation comes first that's why Jesus opening understand to the Scriptures to give them a revelation of what it was going to experience so when they kept the experience because said this is that [Applause] 20 hours out in the house when they get the experience because it this is that that the profits make up so then they have a powerful group of powerful church and so on like that but they don't have the Holy Ghost and the people don't even know that I'm the same spirit of a common end cut and encounter in justin ville saying when they receive it to have it no they come and see it seems very come and say you are Holy Ghost so now you don't have to receive it so then people beamed to the tribulation because them a good looking for no oil because the added oil and the convinced I'm different because they are now so I'm not trying to convince anybody who you know have the own revelation whatnot because I my wife as if I'd sing a lot of violence is a cone funeral the heaters were still gonna hate wasn't gonna change nothing that's right so all we had to do is speak what God put up on our hearts and where the chips fall at for amen praise God hallelujah praise God so this brother now bring a whole church under the new bodies a revelation and you know yeah it season in a certain sense is like a new age teaching because the city new HC you are suffering from ignorance you need to be enlightened you are a God so you don't need to repent you just need to come to understand into who you are but that is without the spirit that's impersonation the Spirit of God supposed to go work to bring you to repentance at the cross and you could see at the cross where you died and they could put you on the cross and then go take you off the cross to walk with the cross on your back pick up your cross and follow me dearly that is what this is about a real debt a real dining out to kept the life of Christ inside of you because that is the important thing [Applause] or glory to God and it's so simple because Paul explained that like in my body to be burned do I have all knowledge do I know all mysteries I don't have charity I am nothing and they get charity you have to climb up the steps and Charlie come to seal the whole building because if charity is not there is have leaks and temperance leaks boram's is have leaks where all charity it will leak out patients the our patient's know Allah code the patient's run out but when charity call me call poor quality bond of perfectness it's the cement that cement the whole thing in that's why it has to be tested he said

when you leave it with your family that is where the tests really are and that is where you have to get victory that is where you overcome poor glory to God a nice that was real a calculation hold percent they come into service 1.7 percent of the time you spend in church for the entire week they not even my tenth nineteen that takes to God you're not even spending 1/10 almost 1/10 of design 17 hours give God a Tyson of 17 hours of your time with prayer with listening to the Prophet listen to messages reading the book try that and see how much I could put hours and see how you always go in but at Facebook or whatever to YouTube whatever it is is killing time and set an all-call kind of thing often on your whatsapp so sometime I I didn't watch it it is too much have nothing Oh hallelujah I want to be ready and the only way I can be ready is to get ready by the word okay so is a dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the people so that must never be here you must always walk with that humility to things and wanted to see me know by what George remember it respects and humility two things why because train another issue it respects and I know that and I want to be able to be humble because you don't know who God would use so that's why never be will anyone or kneel anyone or see this about this one and that Minister know what because you see I can't do it alone there's a vision that came years ago about seenin and I didn't know what that really was the scene in the fishermen go into the sea and drop the net big boat drop the nets on a wide arc area come back to the land it will pull and pull and pull and pull and the vision was we were seen in and we had to pull and something big was coming out and what came up was a pyramid I knew the spiritual dream pyramid came onto the sea we know how many scriptures the season multitude on people but one man CAD was in I went up to me our to understand what's in earnest and I participate in one they dropped in Ethel and I was pulling and pulling pulling pulling and they come in closer or that side that side we didn't have much fish I got a fish caught that is the trap all the fishes inside and you're pulling somebody quite down the road maybe two miles and they pullin and you're pulling and pulling and I was pulling to its net you're pulling you know and you're pulling me pulling pulling I wanna come out porting anybody get another one fish one fish one fish you didn't much but in the vision in the spiritual realm is a big pyramid going to pull one man kept pulled it will take men of God men you understand that they are part of God's program not D quad not D God's program part of it amen so we are part of one buddy and this is what I'm trying to bring to you today the bride is a body and by one spirit you are baptized into that body and once God put you into that body no man no bishop no Minister could fish you out God put you into his body you become a bright member I don't have in China Japan in Australia where there's no church God put you into his body by the spirit you are in the body or give the Lord a show if God baptize you into that body and you never come back in this church you are still in the body you don't have to be in this church to be in the body you have to be in Christ come on say Amen somebody give the Lord a shout this is important because some people say hello here hello dear come here come dear as if the Messiah is dear it's not scripted for that listen well Ram says he said God's people is his caller people they are in every denomination they could be Catholic they could be Protestant they could be Jewish there could be any kind of a church but the real church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ and you cannot organize the mystical body of Christ so that is why he says 700 guarded a bride but that really have a deeper meaning it means people in that gathering would be in the body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost not a bunch of people because we got in for years I have the people all born so that was gathering people but the bride which is the church that Christ is dead is that spiritual body that no man could put you in and you have to hunger and thirst and this is what this service is about just fill you up the hunger and thirst for righteousness that want to fill you with the Holy Ghost this is what this is about I want to be filled yes you promised it I want to be seen Lord yes you promised it you're not telling God you did this I did that and you feeling oh you said Lord you promised it so brother Branham says

that body and you are brought into this church call out and baptize it is mystical but you get it not Methodist not Baptists not Pentecostal not Nazarene so I can t write off anybody right or somebody

calls and those who were able to visit me I would like to share with the church my experience with Jesus through my situation when I arrived at the Coover Hospital I was gasping for breath when they took me to see the doctor they immediately put me on oxygen at this point I was sitting on the bed I wanted to sit at the edge of the bed but the doctor told me no I was feeling as if the oxygen mask was stifling me I asked her to remove it and she said no because the oxygen level in my body was very low I felt as if I needed help and no one was helping me at this point I stopped hearing any stone and was looking around the room I saw people moving around and felt as if no one was helping me I started to see somebody help me somebody help me but as soon as I said god help me him instantly a calm came over me and all fear left me I can't remember if I shut my eyes but it was as if no one else was there except Jesus and I I started to speak to Jesus in my mind and told him I would hold on to his promise that he would never leave me or forsake me I said Lord let your will be done and you are in control and my life is in your hands at this point I surrendered all to him I was very calm and all fear left me I felt the president the Lord with me and I knew in my heart that he was and still is with me I don't know how long this was for because the next thing I knew I was lying in the bed and I could hear myself saying Jesus Jesus Jesus and the next thing I heard that doctor telling me yes say your prayers and relax then I heard that news telling a doctor that my blood pressure which had been extremely high and wasn't going down was in fact going down the doctor then told me that she would send me to San Fernando General Hospital because I had a mild heart attack fluid in the lungs and the oxygen level in my body was low I still felt no fear and was very calm because I knew Jesus was with me at San Fernando Lee removed a fluid from my lungs they did the echo on my heart on Monday and on Wednesday the doctor to marine heart was damaged and the heart cannot repair itself while he was speaking to me I was smiling because I was telling myself I know who can repair it give me a new one he also tore my heart was weak and I said to myself no it is strong he said my heart is beating slow and they have to run some more tests and according to the results it may end up having to do heart surgery I was smiling because I still have no fear and I said let God's will be done all this weighs honor and glory every time the devil touches me it just confirms to me more and more Who I am because I know he kind of touched me without permission from my lord god bless you all and I love you sister Christian god bless you sister Christine what a testimony what of meat

sisters and once again soliciting your prayers for my daughter Felicia who will be once again undergoing surgery on Monday the 1st of February 2018 at the Mount Hope Women's Hospital since her last surgery Felicia's condition has progressively gotten worst the injections and medication she had to be given proved to be useless and many of the side effects from the drugs only added to further cause deterioration of her body the fibroid which the injection was supposed to shrink has grown larger and the endometrial stage 4 is now staged for frozen pelvis and remi Tia's as it has since fused itself to many of her organs therefore now putting her life at risk the doctors informed her that this high-risk surgery may not be the end of a medical condition as the Ender Matias may return however the surgery is crucial for them to remove as much of the N demetrius as possible which itself until removing many of her female reproductive organs and mozzie felicia continues to be in good spirits even after signing the forms at the hospital informing her of the many many things that can go wrong the biggest one being death since I stand in faith with my daughter as we trust a great physician to do a complete work in the situation once and for all please stand with us I will be in prayer and fasting on the day of the surgery next Thursday I'm asking for anyone who will also like
