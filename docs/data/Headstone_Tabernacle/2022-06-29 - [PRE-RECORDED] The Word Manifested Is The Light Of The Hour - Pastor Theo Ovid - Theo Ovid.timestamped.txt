[10:46] generation shall not pass away
[10:48] till lord be fulfilled
[10:54] heavenly shall pass away but my words

[10:58] yourselves least at any time your hearts
[11:01] be overcharged with the fighting and
[11:03] drunkness and cares of this life
[11:06] and so that they come upon you unawares
[11:09] for as a snare
[11:11] shall it come on all them that dwell on
[11:13] the face of the whole earth
[11:16] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[11:19] even we are counted worthy
[11:21] to escape all these things
[11:23] that shall come to pass
[11:25] and to stand before the son of man
[11:28] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[11:31] praise his holy name and let's go to
[11:33] isaac chapter 60
[11:35] praise be to jesus
[12:01] arise and shine for the light is come
[12:03] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[12:05] thee for behold the darkness shall cover
[12:08] the earth and gross darkness to people
[12:10] but the lord
[12:12] shall rise upon thee and his glory shall
[12:14] be seen upon him he god the blessed
[12:16] reign of his word you may be seated o
[12:18] praise the name of the lord
[12:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[12:22] praise god what a time this morning
[12:25] in the word and what a contrast
[12:28] of that good shepherd from ezekiel 34
[12:30] where god says son of man prophesy
[12:32] against the shepherds of israel prophesy
[12:35] and say unto them thus hear the lord god
[12:37] unto the shepherds would be to the
[12:38] shepherds of israel that feed themselves
[12:42] should not the shepherds feed the flock
[12:45] you eat the fat they clothe you with the
[12:47] wool you kill them that are fed but you
[12:50] feed not the flock the disease have you
[12:52] not strengthened neither have you healed
[12:54] that which was sick neither have you
[12:56] burned up that which was broken neither
[12:58] have you brought again that which was
[13:00] driven away neither have you sought that
[13:02] which was lost but with force i would
[13:05] cruelty have you ruled them and they
[13:08] were scattered because there is no
[13:10] shepherd and they became meat to all the
[13:12] beasts of the field when they were
[13:14] scattered my sheep wandered through all
[13:16] the mountains upon every high heel year
[13:19] my flock was scattered upon all the
[13:20] earth and none did search or seek after
[13:23] them therefore these shepherds hear the
[13:26] word of the lord as i live saith the
[13:28] lord god surely because my flock became
[13:30] a prayer my flock you see what god keeps
[13:33] it my flock my flock my flock this is
[13:35] not meant churches the people don't
[13:37] belong to men it's my flock it's my
[13:39] people
[13:40] my people that's called by my name
[13:42] praise god holly in the last days true
[13:45] shepherds will be a hidden mystery and
[13:47] barbara and preach a message called why
[13:49] it had to be shepherds and reveal a
[13:51] hidden mystery that goku would have true
[13:53] shepherds in the last day born to the
[13:55] false shepherds hallelujah so what the
[13:58] shepherd's supposed to do is the healed
[14:00] broken-hearted to restore those that are
[14:03] lost to go after them in other words
[14:05] they're supposed to have a heart of a
[14:07] shepherd a true shepherd that will lay
[14:09] down his life for the sheep and stand
[14:11] for what is right and stand for what is
[14:14] true and stands for what is righteous
[14:16] that is the kind of heart that god gonna
[14:19] put in the last days oh hallelujah
[14:22] hallelujah glory to god amen
[14:25] listen to this as i live to say the lord
[14:27] god surely because my flock became a
[14:29] prey and my flock became me to every
[14:32] piece of the field because there was no
[14:33] shepherd neither did my shepherd search
[14:35] for my flock but the shepherds fed
[14:37] themselves and fed not my flock
[14:39] therefore o shepherds hear the word of
[14:41] the lord dost say the lord god behold i
[14:44] am against the shepherds i will require
[14:46] my flock at their hand and cause them to
[14:49] cease from sending the flock neither
[14:51] shall the shepherds feed themselves
[14:52] anymore but i will deliver them from
[14:55] their mouth for thus here the lord i
[14:58] even i will both search my sheep and
[15:01] seek them out god promised the lord
[15:03] himself to descend from heaven with a
[15:06] shout to come and seek his own sheep out
[15:10] so you don't belong to no man
[15:12] you don't belong to no system you belong
[15:15] to the lord god almighty
[15:21] oh glory to her praise god do you
[15:23] believe that tonight
[15:24] hallelujah so you have to ignore who
[15:27] find you
[15:29] god himself
[15:30] push back this one push back that one he
[15:34] don't care if he was in a bar he don't
[15:36] care if he wasn't adultery if it wasn't
[15:38] fornication either kevin was drunk and
[15:40] drinking god himself he said i myself
[15:44] going to come down and find my sheep
[15:47] glory to god hallelujah he is the good
[15:51] shepherd
[15:52] oh glory to god hallelujah all that the
[15:55] father had given me
[15:57] will come glory to god and i will raise
[16:00] them up so no devil could hold you back
[16:03] you are going to come out you are going
[16:05] to be free you're going to be anointed
[16:08] with god
[16:09] oh hallelujah
[16:11] glory to god amen didn't either
[16:13] praise the name of the lord
[16:15] so this morning this evening

[16:19] the word manifested is the light of the
[16:22] hour
[16:23] that's the title and the word manifested
[16:25] is the light of the hour from search is
[16:28] the time of the branham it might be

[16:40] it's already in the scriptures and the
[16:41] time shall be no more we'll be talking
[16:43] about this and that and all we want to
[16:45] plan time shall be no more
[16:47] russian position isn't that right the
[16:49] sodomites in position is not right
[16:51] everything is getting into position what
[16:53] about that bride
[16:55] that right has to get in position
[16:57] glory to god i'm going to prove it to
[16:59] you before judgment struck egypt they
[17:02] had a ghost shell

[17:08] have to get the goshen if there's one
[17:10] place it got to go and hide is in kosher
[17:13] and kosher had the blood and moses to
[17:15] kill the lamb it caught they apply
[17:18] because the angel told moses to tell the
[17:21] people when i see the blood i'm going to
[17:23] pass over you praise god that is time
[17:26] they had a prophet they had prophetic
[17:28] utterance they had a word from the lord
[17:31] and if ever there was a time to get a
[17:33] word from the lord it's a time like this
[17:36] because the bible said there's gonna
[17:38] become a famine in the last days all
[17:40] glory not for books and tips we have a
[17:42] lot of that not for preachers we have
[17:44] lots of that but for hearing the true
[17:46] word of god they're gonna run to the
[17:48] east they're gonna run to the west
[17:50] they're gonna run to the north they're
[17:51] gonna run to the south they can't find
[17:53] it but there's gonna be a people that
[17:55] are gonna be well fed my people shall
[17:58] eat and be satisfied and praise the name

[18:05] good shepherd going to feed his flock

[18:14] and the manner that the sheep is gonna

[18:48] seriously think
[18:49] if it is then the pyramid here we go
[18:53] it's capped

[19:14] holy spirit and the seven thunders is
[19:17] the capstone

[19:31] jesus
[19:32] jesus said my words
[19:34] they are spirit
[19:36] and they are life
[19:37] what he did not say is the process for
[19:39] it to turn from word
[19:41] into spirit because any time god about
[19:43] to do something he doesn't give you the
[19:45] full fulfillment of it if you want a
[19:48] savior he said hold a baby
[19:50] [Music]

[21:06] but watch this when samuel came a boy
[21:09] was coming
[21:10] but god saw a king
[21:12] you see god
[21:13] loves to see the seed unfold itself
[21:18] you see god knows that once the word
[21:20] goes thought the word is a seed and the
[21:23] word just can't return void god knows
[21:27] when that
[21:30] when that word
[21:32] is spoken
[21:33] [Applause]
[21:37] that word have power in itself
[21:41] come on now
[21:42] come on now
[21:43] let's go down to genesis
[21:45] let's let every seed bring forth after
[21:49] it's kind
[21:51] god i don't have enough
[21:53] this church is too small for me today
[21:56] oh glory to god is too small
[21:57] [Applause]
[22:08] [Music]
[22:08] [Applause]
[22:13] that's why remember
[22:15] that's why the devil is always
[22:16] interested in killing babies
[22:18] [Applause]
[22:20] because the babies have the potential
[22:23] you see a little eagle is a big one in
[22:25] small form
[22:26] [Applause]
[22:28] i'll say it again a little eagle is a
[22:30] big one in small form
[22:32] or if you only get big if the church
[22:35] only get to know who he is if they get
[22:36] to know who you are if you get to know
[22:38] your potential you will see why the
[22:40] devil is fighting you two-time nail
[22:43] every single day of your life
[22:46] because he knows that if you come into
[22:50] an understanding and a revelation of who
[22:52] you are and you can do the greater works
[23:01] you let me see
[23:03] adam

[23:42] there
[23:43] that's okay
[23:45] you are surprised of what i'm saying
[23:51] that's why jesus didn't get no fight
[23:52] with the one as well
[23:54] he's so cool
[23:57] he's five man
[23:58] [Music]
[23:59] oh

[26:56] we are dangerous people
[26:59] we are atomic bombs
[27:01] we are god's weapon of warfare we are
[27:04] god's judgment sword on the earth
[27:08] the spirit is upon me for he has
[27:11] anointed me to bring a word to you
[27:14] today

[27:36] remember caesar
[27:38] hallelujah
[27:40] hallelujah
[27:42] we speak to you
[27:44] because we don't want the day
[27:46] to take you unaware like a snail
[27:49] that will trap people
[27:51] upon the earth those that are unguarded
[27:54] those who are not vigilant it will catch
[27:57] them
[27:58] like a trap set for an animal
[28:00] like a snare to gather all men on the
[28:02] earth but you are not one of those
[28:05] you are escaped once you escape the pope
[28:09] you escape rome you accept the
[28:11] nomination you escape false prophets you
[28:15] escaped interpretation you escaped man's
[28:17] idea and now you are in the holy ghost
[28:22] of the seven thunders to utter their
[28:24] voices
[28:26] to you
[28:34] you will be seated
[28:35] if it is
[28:37] then the pyramid is capped
[28:38] by the servant thunders you remember the
[28:41] previous message it's a caption
[28:43] what did it do
[28:44] the holy spirit
[28:46] capped off the individual
[28:49] and sealed it
[28:51] when we have added faith righteousness
[28:54] godliness and so forth we kept adding
[28:57] until we got seven things and the
[28:58] seventh one was love
[29:00] watch and then watch
[29:02] that's how he makes the individual he
[29:04] caps him and seals him with the holy
[29:07] spirit then if that be so
[29:10] if this individual is kept and sealed
[29:14] with the holy ghost what does this
[29:15] individual have if that be so then he
[29:19] has got seven church ages that he had
[29:21] seven mysteries that have been sung it
[29:23] away and they fought to bring them back
[29:26] and the heads don't come the cap of the
[29:27] church does the thunders mean that my
[29:29] brethren
[29:30] serves where we are at
[29:32] so we find out the seven thunders
[29:35] cap the pyramid is not right
[29:37] praise god
[29:39] god talked to moses chicago listen to
[29:40] this
[29:42] and i believe
[29:44] that the age has come now
[29:46] the miraculous
[29:48] the phenomenal
[29:50] the baptism of the spirit
[29:52] and power
[29:53] and signs
[29:54] and wonders this great outpouring of
[29:58] god's spirit in the last days
[30:00] that's the thing
[30:02] that will bring faith into the people
[30:04] that will take a rapturing fate
[30:07] that will take the church into glory
[30:09] you heard what he says the baptism of
[30:12] the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost
[30:15] that's the thing to bring faith into the
[30:17] people and seven thunders gives faith so
[30:21] seven thunders is the holy spirit
[30:24] [Applause]
[30:27] i am not hearing you
[30:29] i'm not hearing you
[30:31] then the same seven thunders that caps
[30:33] the pyramid that's the thing to bring
[30:35] the faith
[30:41] so the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[30:43] thing to bring to faith in the people
[30:44] therefore the seventh thunders must be
[30:46] the holy spirit
[30:48] because the seven things get fate and
[30:50] the holy spirit gains fate
[30:51] so therefore the thunders is the
[30:53] dynamics
[30:54] in mechanic form
[30:56] in word form super saiyan that whenever
[30:58] the light struck rebecca she knew
[31:00] something within her that brought her to
[31:02] isaac she veiled the face she wanted no
[31:05] more to do with her own thinking isaac
[31:07] was the thinking from then on and the
[31:08] church itself here we go when it strikes
[31:11] the power of god the baptism of the holy
[31:13] ghost out of the national churches out
[31:16] of the catholic church wherever it is
[31:18] when the baptism of the holy ghost is
[31:21] made real to the people
[31:24] damn that's predestination like you
[31:25] people here to life sees it and walks in
[31:28] it what's it a super sign
[31:30] and you possess the gates of the enemy
[31:32] so the baptism of the holy ghost has to
[31:34] be made real to the people rising of the
[31:37] sun he came to redeem or to bring to
[31:40] life those predestinated seed of god
[31:42] that he's seen before the foundation of
[31:44] the world and put their names in the
[31:45] book of life so he put their names in
[31:47] the book of life he come down on the
[31:48] earth and looking for those seeds he's a
[31:50] great shepherd looking for the seas
[31:52] looking for sheep he had sheep in
[31:54] trinidad so the great shepherd had to
[31:56] bring the seven thunders from under the
[31:58] seventh seal and throw it over this
[32:00] island to see them seven thunders pick
[32:03] up the seed because the seventeen are
[32:04] gonna gather the bright together the
[32:06] seven dollar will give the bride fate
[32:08] seven are gonna utter the voices of that
[32:10] group the seven thunder to show how to
[32:11] prepare those seven thunders have to be
[32:14] loose
[32:15] seven perfect spirits across the whole
[32:17] earth to get every pedestrian of the
[32:19] seed it's the great shepherd it's the
[32:22] great holy spirit it's the great elohim
[32:25] moving brooding like it was in the
[32:27] garden of eden when cross darkness
[32:29] covered the earth and the spirit of god
[32:32] move upon the face of the water and god
[32:34] said let there be light oh come on now
[32:38] come on now god said let there be light
[32:41] it was dark
[32:47] i want you to notice
[32:49] the darkness didn't intimidate god
[32:51] god didn't hide this person but it's so
[32:52] dark i can't see anything that god that
[32:55] wasn't intimidated by the darkness and
[32:57] isaiah isaiah said close darkness cover
[33:00] the earth gross darkness cover the
[33:02] people but the light gonna come the
[33:04] light going to shine when god saw the
[33:07] darkness the bible said darkness was
[33:09] upon the face of the deep but the spirit
[33:12] of god move upon the face of the water
[33:14] the spirit of god and the waters which
[33:17] those source at the multitude of the
[33:19] people the spirit of god begin to move
[33:22] upon the waters or when the spirit begin
[33:24] to move upon you you're gonna hear the
[33:27] voice of god that's why you've got to
[33:29] get in the spirit that's why you've got
[33:31] to worship that's why you've got to
[33:32] honor his name that's why you got to
[33:34] press your way you can't just watch and
[33:37] stare you got to watch and praise
[33:39] [Applause]
[33:45] listen to brother branham
[33:47] he not only come to be a blessing but to
[33:50] share the blessing with every
[33:52] predestinated seed
[33:54] oh hallelujah
[33:56] now the mystery was the seed was always
[33:58] in the earth
[34:03] you hear what i said
[34:05] in genesis the seed was already there
[34:07] that was a hidden mystery darkness was
[34:10] covered in it and once darkness covered
[34:12] the seed it can come to life
[34:14] ethnic light
[34:15] to bring it into a manifestation
[34:18] so the word manifested brings light
[34:21] to bring forth the seed as long as
[34:23] darkness is covering the seed they can't
[34:26] produce anything but when god rolled
[34:28] back to darkness when god rolled back
[34:32] the darkness when god
[34:34] rolls back the darkness you're gonna
[34:36] hear let there be light
[34:38] [Applause]
[34:44] and that light going to strike that seed
[34:47] inside of you oh hallelujah
[34:50] listen to this
[34:51] jesus he was god's first corner wheat
[34:54] that had been raised from the dead
[34:56] the first corner wheat by god's
[34:58] quickening power god has quickness life
[35:01] raised him from the dead and he was the
[35:03] first fruits of those that slept the
[35:06] first sample
[35:08] the first taste of others that come to
[35:10] raise he was the first fruits of them
[35:13] that slept and that's why they had to
[35:15] waive that chief
[35:17] because it was the first one that come
[35:19] to maturity it was wave as a memorial of
[35:23] thanksgiving to god believing that the
[35:25] rest of them would come so in the old
[35:27] testament when you plant your crop and
[35:30] you get the first chief come to maturity
[35:31] you take it and wave it before the lord
[35:34] and like a wave offering lord more is
[35:36] coming
[35:37] yes they are ready yet but they're
[35:38] coming they have all the potential but
[35:40] they're coming they're in bondage but
[35:42] they're coming they're looking for a
[35:43] breakthrough but they're coming they
[35:45] fall here they fall there but they're
[35:47] coming because this is the first one
[35:50] that comes to maturity and if this one
[35:52] can make it all the rest could make it
[35:54] if this one could overcome all the rest
[35:57] could overcome if this one could have
[35:59] power all the rest would get power or
[36:01] the first one come to maturity was waved
[36:05] [Applause]
[36:10] how many see
[36:12] the power of love
[36:14] [Music]
[36:15] god with him
[36:16] see that's why
[36:18] oh this is good that's why jesus had no
[36:20] fight to tell disciples what they need
[36:22] to know
[36:22] and what they're not prepared to handle
[36:24] as yet
[36:25] he watched them and said the same works
[36:26] i do shall you also and these guys have
[36:29] all kinds of spirits on them
[36:30] they don't even know what spirit of
[36:35] jesus told them this
[36:37] if you shall say this mountain be moved
[36:39] and don't doubt their heart you can have
[36:40] what you say
[36:41] they can't touch that yet
[36:43] but he hit it in the promises
[36:45] he's just hitting them with it that's
[36:47] like algebra you're beating them with it
[36:50] and they're doing no mathematics
[36:52] and they give them algebra because it
[36:54] belongs to them
[36:55] [Applause]
[36:57] you see all what god is he poured into
[37:00] christ
[37:02] and all his christ he put into the

[47:37] amen
[47:42] for proving his word in the last days
[47:44] there's got to be a place prepared for

[52:06] oh my
[52:08] my my my my
[52:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[52:12] oh glory to god
[52:14] so jesus was the first fruit of them
[52:16] that slept he was waved over the
[52:19] promised sea doesn't have life yes and
[52:21] watch he was waved on the day of
[52:22] pentecost and there came a song from
[52:24] heaven so the son of man came
[52:27] and then the spirit came
[52:28] and waved over them and each one got the
[52:31] pillar of fire
[52:32] they wasn't just in the atmosphere the
[52:35] tongues of fire settle upon each one of
[52:37] them so each one of them had their
[52:40] kingdom had the fire had their portion
[52:43] had god failed and that is what this
[52:46] promise
[52:47] pillow fire back in the church
[52:49] who is the church you are the church
[52:51] till the fire back in you and when you
[52:54] are fire and he has fire and she has
[52:57] fire and i have fire and that fire come
[52:59] together that's the pillar of fire
[53:02] that's the bride
[53:03] [Music]
[53:06] so what about him says anderson wave
[53:09] again we realized they look something
[53:11] in the sunday again the sun will be
[53:13] revealed now watch who is the son of man
[53:15] in the beginning was the word the word
[53:17] was with god and the word was god and
[53:19] the word was made flesh and well among
[53:21] us watch and that word again is wave
[53:24] over the people here we go that the dead
[53:27] tradition of man is dead and the son of
[53:29] god is alive again with the baptism of
[53:32] the holy spirit right among us and is
[53:34] giving us life
[53:36] so i'm sure when you're right true and
[53:37] true praise god that the baptism of the
[53:40] holy ghost is what is promised
[53:42] judgment was fallen all over egypt and
[53:45] if you notice no ministers you must
[53:46] disagree with me on this but before the
[53:48] judgment started hitting egypt god sent
[53:50] israel to goshen they were in goshen no
[53:53] plague fell on them a perfect time of
[53:55] the church carried over through the
[53:57] tribulation and the last enemy
[54:00] the last plague that struck the earth
[54:02] was death
[54:04] now this is something we may overlook
[54:05] listen to these words and the last enemy
[54:08] that going to strike the church is depth
[54:12] spiritually speaking
[54:14] those who will not follow christ
[54:17] in the baptism of the holy spirit will
[54:20] spiritually dry up and die
[54:24] and that is why i am against any
[54:26] teaching any doctrine that quenched the
[54:29] desire for the holy ghost in the people
[54:33] any doctrine any teaching that quenched
[54:36] the desire for the holy ghost and the
[54:38] people is antichrist
[54:40] it is false it is demonic
[54:43] because any church that don't follow you
[54:46] with the holy ghost will spiritually die
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:53] why do you say that because isaiah
[54:55] prophesied that god's dark discovery
[54:57] earth gross darkness covered the people
[55:00] darkness taken over homes
[55:02] darkness taken over ministers darkness
[55:05] taken over churches take darkness they
[55:08] are blind leaders of the blind they are
[55:11] not seeing they can't lead the people
[55:14] because the light is not there when you
[55:16] turn on the word you walk into darkness
[55:20] oh hallelujah but arise and shine
[55:24] thy light is come
[55:26] and the glory
[55:27] shall be seen upon you
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:33] isaiah didn't talk no glory hidden in
[55:35] you
[55:36] the glory gonna be seen
[55:38] they're gonna have seen you see your
[55:39] glory
[55:40] your cop gonna run over god could be a
[55:43] table in the prison of your enemies you
[55:44] didn't know your enemies right of course
[55:46] you have enemies you're thinking that
[55:47] you think you're nice
[55:51] to me
[55:52] is that right
[55:53] then you don't belong to god you belong
[55:55] to the enemy if you don't know enemies
[55:57] but once you have son of god every devil
[55:59] in hell
[56:00] is against you the devil will drop on
[56:03] your son on your husband on your wife on
[56:05] your uncle on your aunt on your neighbor
[56:08] on the boss on whoever god ever will
[56:10] jump on them try to mess you and tie you
[56:13] up
[56:16] the devil job he come to steal to rob
[56:18] and destroy he's a dog
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:24] he's a highway robber
[56:35] some accident happen in your home this
[56:37] happened you're breaking up you're
[56:38] broken up you're in tears and you say
[56:40] good good good that is where i want you
[56:42] like when you're messed up like that
[56:43] you're in your human spirit
[56:45] but jesus and brother branham seem to
[56:47] have the mind of christ for every
[56:48] situation
[56:50] so nobody could show them off because
[56:52] they're dealing with the intelligence
[56:54] you see i caught something when samuel
[56:56] went to anoint david
[56:58] when samuel went to anoint david
[57:01] he didn't know was david
[57:03] god says one of the sons of jesse that's
[57:06] how god does think what can i tell him
[57:07] david is a man
[57:08] just go down there and pour you all on
[57:10] him
[57:10] before
[57:13] [Music]
[57:24] to go at all because he saw here that's
[57:26] what would kill him
[57:29] god tell him listen just tell him to
[57:30] come to prepare feast
[57:32] and invite the house of jesse
[57:35] so go around the whole thing just just
[57:37] make a spin around
[57:39] so when the first man come when them
[57:41] adamant bible whatever his name is man
[57:43] he's put his cologne on forget it he
[57:46] checks the mirror and fix his tie
[57:48] say good lord the anointing coming for
[57:50] the prideless time and then walk out
[57:53] there with a little punks
[57:54] and samuel himself saying this had to be
[57:56] he
[57:59] so is the harmony going on there he
[58:01] feeling like he and samuel think is he
[58:04] but when the intelligence dropped down
[58:06] god said no that's not him
[58:08] because god doesn't see us mansi
[58:14] god
[58:15] but this is the problem
[58:16] because man sees a certain way
[58:20] so he was teaching the prophet samuel
[58:22] you have to have a dissent
[58:24] don't go by outward appearance and holy
[58:26] cologne smelling and how his tie is well
[58:28] fixed matching his shoes and mashing his
[58:30] socks don't go by that but go by the
[58:32] inward part of the heart and you've got
[58:34] to be in the spirit to discern that so
[58:37] when when when samuel caught it he said
[58:39] i checked him out now on the inner man
[58:41] not him not him not him keep on walking
[58:44] keep on walking next
[58:46] next
[58:47] next
[58:48] next when the last one passes wait a
[58:51] minute all done
[58:53] he said i ain't got no witness he said
[58:55] you have any more
[58:57] where is god they say yeah
[58:59] we are one he gave everybody
[59:02] he's a little shepherd
[59:05] [Applause]
[59:07] he's seen about sheep he says sign for
[59:09] david i wouldn't sit down until david
[59:10] come
[59:11] when they will come david stink up
[59:14] david smelly david they have no cologne
[59:17] david young
[59:19] david looking so out of it
[59:22] hallelujah god said this is he
[59:27] no no these other guys know
[59:29] their passing tests they know they pass
[59:31] through they they know they failed
[59:33] they know they didn't make it so they
[59:35] can't flex with what god has to do now
[59:37] so they got a he
[59:38] man samuel take the hold on and just
[59:40] pour it and leave it
[59:41] we call it that oil long he just get the
[59:43] whole oil or just go right down
[59:45] hallelujah just oil him down
[59:47] david do you even know what's going on
[59:49] david just oh what what is this they may
[59:52] come back to the sheep david is no
[59:54] anointed king
[59:55] [Applause]
[59:57] now watch
[59:58] what is happening in the spirit realm

[1:00:16] upset and his problem they say we know

[1:00:45] you see this is what the devil didn't
[1:00:47] cater for he thought he we could cut off
[1:00:49] in the 70s but george he thought we're
[1:00:51] going to finish in the 80s when the 90s

[1:01:30] hallelujah praise god praise god
[1:01:33] god
[1:01:34] provided a place called goshel
[1:01:37] and there is coming a spirit of death
[1:01:39] upon the land
[1:01:40] that's what i was scared of all along
[1:01:42] to be caught up in a spirit of death
[1:01:44] where people going to church in
[1:01:46] formality they're going to church
[1:01:47] because they have no place else to go it
[1:01:49] can't be that jesus i come that you
[1:01:51] might have life and have it more
[1:01:53] abundantly not come to you to exist and

[1:02:05] church to be sharper
[1:02:07] this is what the house of god is for
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:12] praise god
[1:02:15] not a bunch of confusion
[1:02:17] when you finish from the house of god
[1:02:19] you're supposed to feel empowered as a
[1:02:22] father when you go home to your children
[1:02:24] as a husband when you go back to your
[1:02:26] wife as a wife when you go back to your
[1:02:28] husband you're supposed to feel
[1:02:30] empowered as a daughter of sarah
[1:02:32] as a son of abraham
[1:02:36] as a priest of the most high god
[1:02:39] [Applause]
[1:02:42] having the ability to bring your
[1:02:45] sacrifice
[1:02:46] [Applause]
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:02:52] or some elder or some deacon you
[1:02:55] understand by revelation that he didn't
[1:02:57] come to be a blessing he come to share
[1:02:59] the blessing you understand by
[1:03:01] revelation when the lamb took the book
[1:03:04] he didn't take it for himself he wasn't
[1:03:06] feeling bookish he wasn't going to hold
[1:03:08] a book he liked book he liked to read
[1:03:10] books it wasn't about that it had names
[1:03:12] in the book he wanted to release those
[1:03:14] names those names were in captivity
[1:03:17] those people didn't know who they were
[1:03:19] you had to have to release who you are
[1:03:21] and you are the word
[1:03:24] you are the german
[1:03:26] you are to be released from the thoughts
[1:03:28] of god
[1:03:29] by the word of god
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:37] i don't know
[1:03:38] i want to finish off listen to this a
[1:03:40] word
[1:03:41] had to be created
[1:03:43] a thought
[1:03:44] is in the mind of god a word had to
[1:03:46] create it
[1:03:47] god said let there be light was a word
[1:03:50] seed and that word could have remained a
[1:03:52] thousand years but all of a sudden that
[1:03:55] word have life in itself all of a sudden
[1:03:58] that word manifests itself and the word
[1:04:01] produce light that's the word being
[1:04:04] vindicated that's the word being
[1:04:06] manifested the word have to be
[1:04:07] vindicated in order to be light
[1:04:10] people could say what they want but when
[1:04:12] the light is made manifest when the word
[1:04:15] is made manifest that is the light
[1:04:19] [Applause]
[1:04:22] see it again
[1:04:23] the word itself is not the light the
[1:04:26] word manifested
[1:04:28] that is the light
[1:04:29] so when god speak a word to you that's a
[1:04:32] word to you
[1:04:33] but when that word is manifested
[1:04:37] [Applause]
[1:04:39] that's the light
[1:04:41] that's the light
[1:04:42] oh hallelujah
[1:04:44] oh glory to god
[1:04:46] watch god provide a place called goshen
[1:04:49] there's coming a spirit of death upon
[1:04:50] the land death is the reason we die
[1:04:53] israel had to have something to keep
[1:04:55] them from dying and it was the blood
[1:04:58] over the door
[1:04:59] that god could remove the debt it was
[1:05:01] sentenced it was the penalty it was
[1:05:04] released the angel itself was released
[1:05:07] by the gerald to take out
[1:05:09] anyone who's not under the blood
[1:05:12] god had no jurisdiction upon anyone who
[1:05:16] was not under the blood he said when i
[1:05:18] see the blood i'm gonna pass over he
[1:05:20] released that angel to knuckle to kill
[1:05:23] everyone who was not under the blood and
[1:05:26] the seven thunders is the blood of jesus
[1:05:29] the seven thunders is the blood that god
[1:05:32] has covered all these years that's why
[1:05:35] we are alive
[1:05:37] [Applause]
[1:05:43] do you understand
[1:05:45] without the seven thunders we'll be
[1:05:46] reaching six seals on our way to the
[1:05:49] tribulation i know it did not
[1:05:55] but because we have a blood
[1:05:57] because of the fullness of the atonement
[1:05:59] not just the atonement but the atonement
[1:06:02] in its fullness
[1:06:09] no blood no anointing no blood no power
[1:06:13] no blood no authority the blood give us
[1:06:15] authority right now we don't need more
[1:06:17] power but we have authority by the blood
[1:06:20] we have confidence that when we speak we
[1:06:23] speak through the blood there is no sin
[1:06:25] when the blood is dear because the blood
[1:06:28] speaks better things than the blood the
[1:06:31] blood of god speaks faith in your doubt
[1:06:34] speak weak virtue in your weakness speak
[1:06:37] knowledge in your ignorance it's the
[1:06:39] blood of god over your life it's a
[1:06:42] pyramid in your soul
[1:06:44] it's the word pyramid in mechanic form
[1:06:48] let me try to finish off here
[1:06:50] oh hallelujah
[1:06:52] oh glory to god
[1:06:53] but listen to this bomb
[1:06:55] when spiritual darkness gets upon the
[1:06:58] earth it is time for the enemy to attack
[1:07:01] the devil is born
[1:07:04] when the spiritual darkness come upon
[1:07:07] the earth it's time for the enemy to
[1:07:09] attack
[1:07:10] watch we see fearful sights earthquakes
[1:07:12] tidal waves falling away gross darkness
[1:07:16] heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures
[1:07:18] watch that's what the world is pointing
[1:07:20] to but the church has another sign a
[1:07:22] blessed call outside he promised here we
[1:07:25] go he promised you want to hear your
[1:07:26] sign you want to hear your sign
[1:07:29] he promised that there will be laterin
[1:07:31] in the church the church spiritual in
[1:07:34] the last days he will pour out put the
[1:07:37] former and the lattering the former
[1:07:39] income first the lateran comes second
[1:07:42] both former and later in in the same
[1:07:45] season he promised it
[1:07:49] so what i'm supposed to look for
[1:07:52] some man coming no man could pick a
[1:07:54] revival if man could i bring it we had
[1:07:57] it already it takes the people to bring
[1:08:00] the revival you got to know who you are
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:10] oh my god well here we go
[1:08:12] the sun is the word of god yes in the
[1:08:15] beginning was to let it be light and
[1:08:17] when the manifested word here we go
[1:08:19] when the word of god was manifested
[1:08:22] there was light first god spoke it what
[1:08:26] if it didn't manifest that it wasn't
[1:08:27] like yet but when he spoke it and then
[1:08:30] it was manifested or vindicated his word
[1:08:33] was vindicated light come to existence
[1:08:36] and that's the only way it can be done
[1:08:38] now is when the word is vindicated god's
[1:08:41] written word vindicated it shows light
[1:08:45] oh blessed be the name of the lord do
[1:08:47] you believe that
[1:08:48] hallelujah
[1:08:49] gross darkness blinding of israel was
[1:08:52] for the lightning of the gentiles not
[1:08:54] the blind of the gentiles it's the
[1:08:56] lightning of israel
[1:08:57] god blind the jews that the gentiles
[1:09:00] might see no quarters about the blind
[1:09:02] the gentiles that the jews might see
[1:09:04] cross doctors
[1:09:07] but i miss all of that darkness there's
[1:09:09] going to be light
[1:09:10] oh hallelujah light in your life because
[1:09:13] the spoken word manifest is the light
[1:09:16] coming to your life
[1:09:18] oh hallelujah praise god praise god
[1:09:22] good people caught up sincere people
[1:09:24] watch like mary and joseph they were
[1:09:26] sincere they were presuming jesus was
[1:09:28] with them but they missed jesus isn't
[1:09:30] that right and there are many preachers
[1:09:32] people put their names on the book many
[1:09:34] thought they were sprinkled and
[1:09:35] confirmed baptism fires on holy ghost
[1:09:37] but the fact is that he wasn't there
[1:09:40] what is light question the vindicated
[1:09:43] spoken word of god outside of that
[1:09:45] there's no light it takes god word made
[1:09:47] manifest how can there be darkness and
[1:09:50] light it can't be dark and light
[1:09:51] together they can't fellowship together
[1:09:53] and the bible said and god separated the
[1:09:56] light from the darkness and the lackness
[1:09:59] he called night and the light he called
[1:10:01] thee so god has separate the light from
[1:10:03] the darkness he don't want to mix up
[1:10:05] light and darkness he does separate the
[1:10:07] light from the darkness so once light
[1:10:09] start to come he'll have to separate it
[1:10:12] and light just push back darkness that's
[1:10:14] why the darkness of a revival the
[1:10:16] attackers have to be pushed together
[1:10:17] when the lights have to come something
[1:10:19] got to move people will never come
[1:10:21] together they have to come together
[1:10:23] because light is pushing light is coming
[1:10:25] as the light coming the doctors have to
[1:10:27] gather together
[1:10:29] and somebody because the light is coming
[1:10:32] oh hallelujah what's that like that's
[1:10:34] the morning starlight that's the light
[1:10:36] of the uncommon sun reflecting upon the
[1:10:38] stars of god him not overcome it will
[1:10:41] like bring the morning star and that
[1:10:43] star gonna reflect the light and as the
[1:10:45] sunlight hit that star you are that star
[1:10:48] and at the sunlight at you you're gonna
[1:10:50] reflect the uncommon sun you're gonna
[1:10:52] reflect the coming of the lord oh give
[1:10:55] the lord some praise people
[1:10:59] oh hallelujah
[1:11:01] glory the darkness is separating itself
[1:11:04] from the light god is causing it
[1:11:07] the light is doing it
[1:11:09] god is causing it the light is doing it
[1:11:13] the light is pressing itself in such a
[1:11:16] way until the darkness has to congregate
[1:11:18] together they had a chance to accept it
[1:11:21] and they won't do it so it condenses
[1:11:23] itself
[1:11:24] so today we are now living god has to
[1:11:26] come on the scene here we go now ah let
[1:11:28] me hope stretch god
[1:11:30] has to come on the scene to vindicate
[1:11:33] and prove his promises it's the light of
[1:11:36] the hour so we can rise and shine the
[1:11:38] light shines upon us today the world is
[1:11:41] being manifest that is the light
[1:11:43] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah just a few
[1:11:47] more minutes again and we'll be done
[1:11:48] this is important
[1:11:50] the world had to unite
[1:11:52] titus
[1:11:53] this roman general half the united
[1:11:55] armies together
[1:11:57] after these jews
[1:11:59] rejected the god-given sign to them
[1:12:05] that's the time titus united his army
[1:12:08] together and come to take the city
[1:12:10] they have to be a uniting of god's
[1:12:12] people so-called
[1:12:13] against the word of god
[1:12:15] so listen before national force come in
[1:12:17] effect
[1:12:18] before the press come down it has to
[1:12:20] have the people in this message
[1:12:23] fight the true word in this message
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:29] everything is hinged upon the inner
[1:12:31] battle
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:34] let me read it for you oh hallelujah
[1:12:37] watch this
[1:12:39] they rejected him
[1:12:40] turn him out
[1:12:42] crucify him
[1:12:43] when they rejected the salvation that
[1:12:46] was sent to them
[1:12:47] they united themselves together all that
[1:12:49] in mind
[1:12:50] united themselves together to reject the
[1:12:53] message of the hour
[1:12:54] they had to do that and when they did
[1:12:57] that then the national sign come in
[1:13:03] what did baran says
[1:13:04] national force
[1:13:06] will put the world forces in the church
[1:13:09] and the welcomes are churches but the
[1:13:10] power of god will put the people in the
[1:13:12] bride
[1:13:15] you understand what national force
[1:13:17] government edict
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:22] and how do they have all these southern
[1:13:23] mice in america right now
[1:13:25] if they pass that as a national law
[1:13:26] federal law it means to say you cannot
[1:13:29] deny marrying those characters
[1:13:34] because i will be contrary to federal
[1:13:35] law
[1:13:36] then they could shut down the churches
[1:13:38] they could close that down
[1:13:40] that because that would be the law
[1:13:42] that i'm going with god's law that's
[1:13:43] man's stuff amen and god see that as sad
[1:13:46] among the more repeat
[1:13:50] thank you just that brother martin
[1:13:51] luther king had a community spirit upon
[1:13:53] him i will cause what he writes all to
[1:13:55] die and people to die and stuff but
[1:13:57] wrong talk about that or what happened
[1:13:59] now that seed was so in the 60s look at
[1:14:01] coming to harvest today
[1:14:02] it's a spirit so therefore all the riots
[1:14:05] whatever it is in the spirit coming to a
[1:14:07] harvest the sodomite is the spirit
[1:14:09] coming to harvest what about the bride
[1:14:14] every seed

[1:14:36] last quote
[1:14:37] from ephesians 2 and i'm done
[1:14:40] but receiving could come to the side
[1:14:42] here and let them hear what the spirit
[1:14:43] said in the churches
[1:14:45] how tragic it is
[1:14:47] that this first age
[1:14:48] did not listen to the spirit
[1:14:50] instead of listening to man
[1:14:52] but thank god
[1:14:54] in the last age there will be a group
[1:14:56] rise up
[1:14:57] the true bride of the last day she would
[1:14:59] listen to the spirit
[1:15:01] in the day of gross darkness the light
[1:15:04] will return
[1:15:05] by the pure world
[1:15:07] and we will return to the power of
