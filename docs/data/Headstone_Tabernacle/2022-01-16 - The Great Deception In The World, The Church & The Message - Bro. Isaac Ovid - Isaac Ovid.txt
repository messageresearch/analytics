us through the weak and you have kept us through this year thus far lord i've found myself lord saying over and over you are faithful lord it's it's my lord it's my it's what's keeping me going father your faithfulness the songwriter said great is thy faithfulness lord even when we don't understand lord you are faithful lord when we can go on you are faithful even when we are not faithful you are faithful how great is your faithfulness father lord you are faithful to your word you are faithful to your promises you are faithful to your presence you are faithful to your children you are faithful to us this morning and father we are reporting for duty this morning in the house of the lord lord father under great expectation for what you're about to do father may you speak to us this morning may you get glory to your holy name father we are not here lord to get glory for ourselves but father we are here to lift the name jesus higher lord we sing that song live jesus higher for the world to see father so we are here to give you praise this morning we are here to worship you father because you are our god you are our lord you are our king you are our rock you are our shield you are our sustenance you are our source you are our life you are the way you are the truth you are our peace you made a way where there seem to be no way you send prophets you send messengers up you send the word you send ministers you send lord so many along the way to bring us to 2022 and father we don't have enough words to thank you we don't have enough words to praise you it has nothing to do with how we feel but it is all to do with who you are and the fact that you called us up you wrote our names in the book and no devil could take it out of no demon can take it out of nothing present nothing passive nothing to come he'll separate us from the love of god father may you bless the service today may you bless the word to our hearts may you open our understanding for these few moments lord may you be glorified and may the power of satan be broken father we come against every sickness this morning in the mighty name of jesus christ lord so many conditions and situations we say house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ there's power in the church of the living god over every sickness of every disease over every condition over depression over frustration over thinking about giving up and backsliding we come against it tonight we come against it today in the mighty name of jesus christ may you bring great power and deliverance to your people in the mighty name of jesus christ may you bless the reading of the word as we approach it in the name of jesus amen and amen everybody feeling fine you appreciate the songs this morning the worship the singing the presence you appreciate what god has been doing for us in this year thus far are you blessed what a year 2022 never knew we'd be here but we are here and we are here because god wants us to be here and the devil is mad but we are so glad no devil no demon no principality no power no situation no challenge no stress will stop us from becoming what we are supposed to be in this day and this season oh the devil is not going to take my joy he's not going to take my worship he's not going to take the the the peace in my soul hallelujah david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord we are here in the house of the lord those who are connected on the internet you make this your house of the lord this morning oh i wish you were here but if you can't be here then you declare that ground to be holy ground and get into the spirit create an atmosphere create an atmosphere of worship he loves when we worship he loves when we lift our hands oh hallelujah oh my the lord loves i want you to see like this he loves to collect worship he loves to collect praise praises belong to him worship belongs to him thanksgiving belongs to him so he's here today to collect and as he collects from you your praise and your worship and your thanksgiving he also feels compelled to give because he is a giver he gives joy he gives peace he collects thanks he collects praise he collects worship but he's giving peace he's giving joy and he's given the holy ghost can the church say amen so can we give the lord a big a big shout out praise can we give him some thanks this morning somebody say hallelujah somebody say thank you jesus oh blessing and honor might and power be unto the lamb that was slain forever and ever by his blood he had redeemed us and because of this we are kings and priests unto god soldiers in the army of the living god oh hallelujah amen he may be seated for a few minutes if i read the scripture i think it's the first time i'm in this capacity for this year so we are still in the middle of january so we certainly want to extend all of god's blessings for this year how many appreciated services thus far but over the first two sundays of this year back to the cross and by one spirit you're baptized into the body making a straight line to what a great apostles preach paul would reference we come to preach christ on christ alone we come to preach the truth of the cross on the cross alone and the great theme of every apostle have you received the holy ghost since you believe that's anybody who wants to line up with this great mystery and this good revelation these are the things you preach have you received a holy ghost since you believe that's apostolic teaching it's teaching to set your heart on fire to create a desire in your soul that lifts you above the world lifts you above church and lifts you above the message because there are all kinds of people in the message but there's an elect in the message can i say that one more time there are all kinds of people in the message but there is an elect in the message oh hallelujah this shout message called all kind of people all kind of religious spirits all kind of people with all kind of ideas but in there make no mistake about it there is an elect lady who is not going to be moved by ideas not moved by all kind of winds of doctrine not moved by suggestions and and delusions and illusions but their eyes are fixed on the cross and fixed on a transformation not on the outside in but on the inside out up because there'll be the holy ghost life up we spoke about it in bible study they who walk after the flesh after the flesh but they that are of the spirit and as many as a leader who allow the holy ghost the holy spirit to lead them [Applause] until that police man can move from on the outside and come inside and then there's the holy ghost sitting on the tower of your heart or when you look left you know what to do when you look right you know what to do can the church say amen oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i feel good this morning i'm trusting him this morning because i know he wants something to be said this morning hallelujah and i must say i was blown away on wednesday night anybody see wednesday night service the presence of joseph 1999 i sat there in shock and i don't know if you recognize me but i was in that meeting i almost didn't recognize myself so that's why i have to that's many years ago but i was telling red overhead watching that message in 1999 that message song as we preached last week preaching the same way the same approach the same focus the same anointing the same presence hallelujah over 20 years ago you could pull any tape and you can't find well he went this way you went this way it's the same thing so i salute you but over for staying with the vision of this great prophetic ministry and what it has called us to hallelujah my my my my we are gonna have a grand time god has called us for a great time in his presence oh hallelujah we know they'll be rough time but we're gonna have a grand time also we know that all that follow christ will suffer persecution but my promise is not persecution he suffered so he could be glorified and the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us so hold on mama hold on papa oh that artist will be under your feet diabetes will be under your feet high blood pressure will be under your feet oh come on now female condition under your feet your child outside the church that will be under your feet because they're gonna come back there's a power that's coming in it's now coming in for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation that's what we are born for that's what we are called for not to be religious spirits not to be church members but that elect lady is there anybody in the house this morning who is identified among the elect lady hallelujah somebody gave god a shout out i feel religious i don't know what kind of service we're gonna have today but oh my give me your old time religion old time holy ghost old time moving all the time i hear the rustle in the mulberry tree i don't know when last you've been here but if you haven't been here for a while the angel is here he's stirring the water you could step into the water this morning whatever you have need of you may be seated [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah god loves to confuse people it's through the foolishness of preaching he loves to confuse people just to think to god he loves it you know simon invited jesus to his home did not wash his feet and they used the opportunity when that woman came to wash his feet to make the accusation that if jesus only knew the kind of woman that had come to him or if he only knew what she was he would have sent her outside the church he would have thrown her out and jesus sat there he sat there quietly because he doesn't see the way man sees all those religious spirits that was sitting around jesus listen they were criticizing jesus and when you study it listen the amount of criticism jesus had to deal with how are you feeling bad when you get criticized they call jesus the devil in them they say these things you're doing is because you're part of the hobbyist above you and he said but a kingdom that's divided against itself cannot stand the devil smart enough to not break up your own army listen the devil is organizing him he's moving together you know is we have to come and see the unity of the fate or no not organized religion no no but one mind one accord one purpose one mission blessed be the name of the lord so i'm blessed by the services thus far for this year and uh knowing that god has something planned for us and we want to be connected to his plan and to his purpose so i have a message this morning by the grace of god and i have three scriptures that i want to read but we'll do two of them standing and then when we take our seats we'll grow through the third by the grace of god so can we get to our feet if you have your bibles would you tune with me we're going to go to the book of saint matthew 24. thank you musicians matthew 24 verse 3. and as he sat upon the mount of olives this is speaking about jesus the disciples came under him privately by this time in jesus ministry there would have been many people around jesus and the disciples being more and more exposed to the greater truths about jesus's ministry would have exercised wisdom and come to him when nobody else was there saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you we have read this many times but i want to amplify this statement take heed that no man deceive you so before jesus goes into any kind of explanation he first gives them a warning take heed that no man deceive you because jesus understood the power of deception and many of us we don't really understand the power of deception and how deception works and how deception slips in and the father and the author of deception so jesus goes on for many shall come in my name now the thing is deception is designed to deceive so deception is not obvious let me make a distinction that deception cannot be obvious to be deception deep understanding of the deception which would lead us to the scripture we will read about deceive the very elect if it were possible meaning it is so close that it's not as if you're seeing well he is off he is off you almost will not know that somebody is off and it challenges us by the word to be really careful to understand what is right and what is wrong and what guidance we have through the scripture and to the message of this great elijah prophet to discern what is truth from what is falsehood anybody with me this morning for many shall come in my name so they're not coming in a name that is not his name they're not coming and openly presenting something to you that you could say you know that's off no because they're coming in his name and and the lord jesus and they're saying certain things even quoting the prophet not a few will come you know many will come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that he be not troubled so the wars and the rumors of wars is not supposed to affect us for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginnings of sorrows not the ending that's how the sorrows begin then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many will wax cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved and this really resonates with me because many have started but you see that enduring to the end and this is why when we were preaching on lam trim in time we keep referring it's not about what happened years ago for you it's not about what happened 10 years ago 15 years ago god isn't looking at that experience back then because many started and many were there and many went through that but you see the enduring to the end part the holding faster that which is good part the persevering against all odds part that if everybody else walk away you can hold on pat he that challenge you're to the end so there's a distinction that's being made from those who start the journey you know that song i started on this journey many years ago but i'm going all the way how many want to go all the way this morning i care less what you may do or say but i've made the lord a promise hallelujah but anthony i don't even get seen that at the end that if he will lead away i told him i'll follow and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come i'm going down to verse 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and they shall show great signs and oneness in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect lord may you add a blessing to the reading of the word and may you speak to us today in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen you may be seated i know i said i had three scriptures but we'll take them while we're seated i want us to approach [Music] second thessalonians chapter two i'm just laying a background to the message this morning now i want us to appreciate that in paul's ministry paul is exhorting the church and in fact thessalonians the letter to the thessalonians he would not have written himself i would have taught this he would have written it yes but he wrote it he wrote it along with timothy and silas and there would have been a difference in time actually between when first thessalonians was written and second thessalonians some historians say would have been about a period of about two to three weeks or maybe three to four weeks between the two letters reaching into the hands of the believers now if you recall before we read it in first thessalonians we reference very often first thessalonians 4 16 for then the lord shall descend so when you read true first thessalonians a lot of what paul was presenting is about leaving this place about the coming of the lord the first three chapters or so was about the fellowship and so happy he was to see that it was still standing for the fate and all these things and he was kind of just touching bases with them and then by the time he gets to to verse four to chapter four rather he gives a little encouragement and gets down into the coming of the lord and he sort of closes off there somewhere between that letter it is said and and the second some questions kind of arose and this is what led to the position of second thessalonians and when we read chapter two verse one so paul is now addressing a situation now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor my word nor by letter as from us so paul is saying listen i don't want to get spooked by a word by spirit or even the letter i may have sent to you anybody with me as that the day of the cry of christ is at hand so when people read for the lord shall descend and read these things in that first thessalonians i'm wondering did it happen yet did i miss it you know what it is to wake up one morning and wonder if you missed it because people missing and people say did the rapture take place so paul was beginning to exhort them don't get spooked about if the rapture took place yet and again paul is starting to speak just like jesus in matthew 24 because he starts with the same line in verse 3 let no man deceive you so we see jesus addressed that issue of no man deceiving in matthew and now paul is picking it up again let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there be a falling away first paul is saying listen don't talk about rapture yet until you see your falling away first what is falling away mean people who once believed no longer believe people who were once faithful no longer faithful people who were once holding on decide to let go of the rope and say i'm not sure this is worth it that they shall not come except they come up falling away first and that man of sin be revealed that son of perdition we know who that is listen to the description of that man of sin the son of perdition who oppose it and by definition here this is the antichrist we're talking about an anti in the greek alt it means to oppose and replace we're getting somewhere this morning a little teaching message who oppose it which has come against and exalted himself above all that is called god so the objective of lucifer's mission his plan is purpose is to oppose and replace so the devil is not just satisfied to come against what you stand for and what you want to be the you know he wants to replace it because this was his whole plan all along he was jealous of the worship that god got anybody with me this morning i'm reading the scriptures who oppose it and exalted himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitted in the temple of god showing himself that he is god so you see what the devil the devil's job is that to run governments and to run companies and that's that that's the petty thing that's the simple machinery but you see worship you see the spiritual side of it and you can see why jesus was talking about let no man deceive you because they were going to come in my name but they're coming in my name but they are not belonging to me so whose name are they really coming in if they're coming in my name but they don't belong to me and here we see the bible talking about except the kind of falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition we're getting somewhere verse 5 remember he not that when i was yet with you i told you these things so paul is again reminding them of previous conversations and now you know what would hold it that he might be revealed in his time in other words now you're clearing about clearing up to you what we're waiting for for the mystery of iniquity dot already work there's already iniquity that's working already the devil has already infiltrated he has deceived all except those names on the book everyone will be deceived you know in the world in the church even in the message and i'm gonna heading for that that's where my end game is today down to the deceived in the message who have failed to reproduce the life of jesus christ or are not trying to produce that life and sit along in a message because if you because i have books i have tapes i said you're not going to message church that all is well and when the bible is clear that something must be produced for you to be identified as the elect can the church say amen i'm building to something we're stepping for the mystery of iniquity that already work only he who out of the downloaded and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and sins and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved in other words there's a truth that allows you to be saved but people don't want to receive it and they want to accept deceit for this cause god shall send them and this is a warning here a strong delusion sitting in the message with a strong delusion sitting in church with a strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word and i have one scripture that we're going to go to before i share a few things with you this is things that we know but it's bringing back to your remembrance and if you don't know it it's an opportunity for you to sharpen your sword because but imam taught us everything must be scripturally proven brother branham's ministry had to be captured in scripture and you must know the scriptures that pertain to you to your message to your ministry to your purpose because outside of that you will fail you understand whether branham couldn't come outside of the bible we can't come outside of the bible and but ibraheem would say the angel will come and when the angel came i had to check what he said against the scripture dream check against scripture ideas checked against scripture your thoughts checked against scripture and if it can't line up with scripture throw it out last scripture reading second timothy now timothy is the only book that paul wrote that's not written to a church he writes it to his closest confident we would have done a study a bible study on timothy to identify that paul would have said there was nobody in his ministry like timothy he almost adopted timothy as his son timothy we would have discussed should not have made the cut because he was offer a sort of mixed marriage as it were he was not of the pedigree and there was so much against him and he was a nervous boy and and all that is captured in there so this conversation or this letter between paul and timothy now bearing mind that book we read from thessalonians timothy would have been party to that letter being written so this letter being written that timothy is different because this is somebody who is in in the loop as it were so it's it's it's as if a minister is speaking to another minister and sharing something and we are getting privy to that communication between the messenger of the age the star of the age the apostle of the age this great messenger paul who is the gold standard upon which every messenger could be measured everybody with me this morning and he is speaking to his apprentice as it were the young minister who would be the first pastor of the ephesians church that's who timothy was anybody with me this morning and he's encouraging timothy and he's sharing something that is for our day second timothy three verse one this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come dangerous times will come time of stress and trouble is not what we're living in now has there been any age as stressful as this age as much trouble as this age as much perplexity and information as this age verse 2 for men shall be lovers of their own cells in the amplified narcissistic self-focused and technology and social media has pushed the world into this concept but if it says it casually but it's true selfies and these things lovers of themselves self focus selfish we're going somewhere we're in the scriptures now men shall be lovers of their own selves they don't care about nobody else they love themselves more than their children more than their families love themselves more than god loves themselves more than the environment that's why they could litter and throw things into the seas because they about themselves selfish covetous lovers of money impelled by greed that's what it means boasters boastful and this is in the message now where is this in the church you find it here because this is part of this last day thing bosses you're boasting about your achievement when you achieve nothing because without god you could do nothing the moment you take credit for it you miss the whole thing there's nothing we could take credit for because god didn't have to wake you up this morning he didn't have to give you a hand a musician could take no credit because god give you a hand to play if you had no hand how you could be a musician what credit could you take for anything [Applause] but in the last days boosters i me my my achievement it's a simple message you know we're gonna get to something boastful arrogant that's proud proud they don't want to be guided proud they don't want nobody tell them and they're proud they're proud of their achievements because of pride they don't ask for help because of pride they don't seek guidance because they don't want anybody to perceive them less than their station they keep themselves trapped and limited by limiting beliefs anybody this morning we're gonna build into something proud blasphemous disobedient to parents how you could ever tell me you and the bride and you can't be your parents where are you going with that is either this thing is real to you or if it is not then you're really living in deception you know outside of this truth you're living in deception unthankful people can't say thank you they're just unappreciative you know what the opposite of unthankful really is is entitlement you know because when you understand gratefulness and thankfulness it makes you a thankful person when you're entitled somebody or or feel entitled you feel because you deserve it you're going to be thankful for it you know because it's mine so you don't acknowledge anybody else because you're supposed to have it you ask your parents to something and they give you because you know why they're supposed to give you that's how you feel and because they did not give you you're upset and when they do give you you're not thankful because they're supposed to do it and people walk around life ungrateful unthankful because they think they deserve it so they can't say thank you because you're supposed to give it to them and you feel a kind of way when things don't work out because you're really ungrateful and you're unthankful and you don't understand you're living with a spirit of entitlement and you're upset with god because you feel god's supposed to do it on your time in your way and you carry the foolishness from god to your home to school to work and we live with a culture of ungrateful un entitled people who can't say thank you that's why i said this morning god collects thanks that's why the bible say in all things in everything give them tongues everything everything do have you practice and learn to thank god for everything i work hard for this job i suppose i have it no you just have to thank god for the job i i work hard for you and how much hours i put in studying i don't care how much of what you're putting you're supposed to do that but in fact you pass the exam you have to thank god [Applause] i hope this helps somebody could have some spiritual some religious spirit in the message of behaviors that cannot go over there that's what i want to get at you cannot go over there you could know the mysteries he could understand the vials he plays he was he sees women under his son you understand all of that but if you cannot give thanks how he can enter into his presence we say enter his gates with thanksgiving and he's caught with praise you not praising you're not thankful because you know you know so much already you're already thankful you you know and your attitude is all twisted and god cannot bless you he cannot use you because you're not even approaching him the right way [Applause] help us this morning i don't know what's going to happen this morning trying to watch the time to see but i want you to get some help i'm i'm not preaching to you and i'm preaching to us because i have to check myself lovers of their own selves people want to to build this whole nonsense about the church you go to and and the pastor and people liked it this and they like that listen without god everything is nothing you know people have almost bypassed god and look at it but it's because the man studies so much or he prays so much that has nothing to do with it that is supposed to be done but unless god bless and unless god open the door and open the windows of heaven that is nothing without the favor of god you are going nowhere [Applause] this scripture this this conversation as it were between paul anthony is not a speculative conversation this is for declaring it as it shall be men shall be lovers of themselves how many fathers love themselves more than their children in so much that they miss the opportunity to truly be your father years ago you'd hear of the days of father sacrificing for their children you don't hear much more now mothers for their daughters even children sacrificing for their parents oh it goes both ways now because you love yourself so much you don't care you don't care about your parents you cut away from the dead no i'm not saying that lightly you know it's a spirit you know it's a spirit because if it's the spirit of god is the spirit of lucifer is he spiritually deceiver the spirit has the behavior has a source and that's why you have to know who your influence is because if whatever it is is not pushing you to the life of jesus christ it's from the devil notice i didn't say pushing the church i said push of the literal life of jesus christ outside of that is he devil or no because he talk in itself the life itself that's the only thing that matters you know all roads that god is calling for is leading to that life in them to perfect love you know to charity you know because that's the only thing we'll make it over there only perfect love [Applause] you maybe and sadly no matter how much we teach it's not about the church it's not about the pastor people still hooked because they want to rest their confidence on a man it is easier to rest your confidence in a man saying well because i'm a man right i i i want to follow that man and where's your life and he's struggling paul was so conscious of this that's why in humility he said if an angel or even me because i can't speak what god will do or what will happen to my life but if they bring another gospel from the gospel i present to you no let that be a curse because paul was so convinced of that teaching he said if i come back to you with something different and change what i say the first time curse me because the angel kills everything else because this is the truth because this is what christ brought us for any other gospel there are many other gospels that are circling right now but we come against every other gospel and this gospel that takes us through calvary through the cross to the wonderful glorious baptism of the holy ghost with an experience in your soul that burns that snake out of your heart and brings you to forgiveness brings you to love brings you to the ministry of reconciliation where seven living voices the fun that shakes the devil could be pulsating out of you in sweetness and humility [Music] [Applause] too much religious people in the message too much church people in the message give me real christians who want the life of jesus christ it'll change your marriage it'll change your home it'll change your family it'll change your finances it'll change your health because it is the power of god unto salvation [Applause] [Music] i haven't even gotten my title yet this is just the scriptures the layer foundation we'll see this might be part one men shall be lovers of their own selves covet us covetous is loving money i've said it before if your job hear me and hear me well if your job takes you away from god get out of that job let me say it one more time if that job is taking you away from god get out of that job because god is faithful if you do it for the right reason to open up doors i don't care who hiring or who not hiring if you do it for the right reason your resume could be at the bottom of the pile god will anoint the person to pull your resume and say this is the man i want to hire this is the young lady i want to hire because they are doing it because of god he said seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and everything else would be added don't try to do what god could do oh come on let me help you don't try to fix what god could fix he could fix your employment he could fix your marriage he can fix your finances put god first and let god do the rest [Applause] i hope this helped somebody this morning you know men shall be lovers of their own cells don't care about nobody some people can't see but they always say when somebody can't see beyond their family where you're going to go in heaven and have you and your three people in one corner of heaven you can't be see see you on be on your own click this is this is your click on it in the church any message it all over beyond your two three people that is it that is your world your world needs to expand you know i have to break it to you you want me to get bigger than that you have to expand your borders selfish you're only looking at yourself what you could get what can you give what can you give how can you help how can you advance the kingdom and i'm talking about the genders now how can you what have you done for this year that's what i advanced the kingdom we still need scripture no help us lord for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemous disobedient appearance unthankful unholy verse 3 without natural affection any amplified as devoid of natural human affection callous and inhumane i was having a conversation yesterday you see the kind of crime taking place now how painful you see a mother holding a child and the bag and abandoned knocked and grabbed the bag and a child in danger what kind of hat and the sad thing is this mother is going to work for a living for the child and that bozo don't want to work don't want to take a day's work well wait for her to come home to grab the handbag that is demonic that is demons at work and you want to walk the streets without the holy ghost you want to walk outside the covering and trust in what i tell you you apply the blood over your house today you apply the blood over your family you apply the blood when you're going to the maxi you drive your car [Applause] because satan know his time is short and he's trying to pull souls into his kingdom and the same time god is trying to raise his elect out of this sodom and gomorrah we're living in god help us this morning to preach heaven high and hell hot to have a church that's without spot or wrinkle [Applause] without natural affection truth breakers breaking agreements irreconcilable they're not trying to to find a middle ground false accusers there's liars incontinent malicious gossip in the amplified devoid of self-control in temporary losing control they have enough they have a they're quick to explode that's the world and you want to live in this world without the holy ghost you want to risk trying to navigate this hell we're walking through with all the holy ghost you think your intellectual can navigate spirits at work when jesus was on the earth the man who they call legion one man can hold him down no no because his spirits upon him made him so strong you want to intellectually have a conversation with that or you want to get your life right with god that the holy ghost could be pulsating to you and the holy ghost is your guide is your defense you tell you no don't walk down the street no just turn left just turn left and you don't even know why eternal life you're about to leave your home and somebody said not yet and then you'll leave now and you'll even walk you say leave early today you don't know why you're leaving early today but god knows what he protecting you true and what he guided you through because you are the elect [Applause] touch not my anointed the devil knows he can't touch the anointed he knows he can't touch the elect of god but you need to make your calling and election show today this morning [Applause] this will have to be part one because i'm still in the scripture but a popular i read you quoted despises of those that are good what kind of person despise people who are good you understand a spiritual limit and spiritual forces your son is demonology spiritual wickedness in high places and you want to walk and say with irony message and that is enough this is not to scare you know it's to get you to run into the arms of god run into the act of safety and not depend on your ability and your strength and all of these things verse 4 traitors heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god pleasures they love friendship and lyman and movies and games and all kind of just old talk more than lovers of god they find all other things that give them pleasure and they can't find pleasure in god something is wrong with your journey friends if you find more pleasure in other things than in the kingdom of god if that is the condition of your soul this morning would you repent would you make it right today would you come back in order today verse five having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof that in the amplified says holding to a form of outward godliness or religion although they have denied its power for their conduct nullifies their claim of faith so it's a form on the outside it's an expression of it but on the inside it's not lining up with it but denying the power of the error from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away by divers lust or different lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth i want us to pause there a little bit information coming to you you're learning new things but never coming to the knowledge of the truth seeking information get it but you're never coming to the truth you know you know more than last month you know but you're nowhere closer to the truth because the knowledge you're going after what you're learning is all kind of other knowledge that's not the truth of what you need to know are you spending time any word are you spending time in the scripture are you listening back to tapes or sharpening up your sword i'm almost done we're going to read this scripture here now as jonathan jamboree's withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the fate so this is talking about people who going around doing this dunk forth they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was and paul is saying for dao has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose fate long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch and iconium at lystrom what persecutions i endured but out of them all the law delivered me hallelujah ye and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution but verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall watch worse and worse and listen to this deceiving and being deceived now this is this is a mind-blowing statement so not only are evil men deceiving others but they themselves are being received so you know what it means somebody is deceived deceiving others and do you even know that they themselves deceived you see how horrible that is but continue though in the things which job has learned and has been a short of knowing of whom thou has learned and made a lot of the blessing to the reading of his word so everybody feeling fine wonderful so just for a few minutes i have a title the great deception in the world the church and the message the great deception in the world the church and the message with a subject discerning the two spirits working in the framework of the message and an inspiration the elect cannot be deceived hallelujah so just by way of background deception is the act of causing someone to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid that's what deception is and the devil we know it in the garden of eden came down to ask but he couldn't reach adam because adam was a son in position original creation merely the image and likeness of god his desire the devil's desire was to take control he couldn't get to adam he could not deceive adam he couldn't penetrate the wall of the world because brother branham told us adam was behind the world he said eve had stayed behind the world she would not have been deceived so we know the fact that the devil could not get to adam meant that adam still behind the word at no point in time did adam step out from behind the word he stayed behind the word and this is an encouragement to us once you stay behind the world the devil cannot get you the devil cannot touch you but when eve came eve as the by-product of eve god did not address eve until after the fall adam's responsibility was to tell eve what god told him and adam did tell her but when adam was not around the devil came and he had to get the information first he said what did god say because he didn't know god never spoke with him he said what did god say and when he revealed it there is where deception began eve said we could eat out of every tree but accept that tree there we cannot eat because if we eat there we will die and the devil created the first deception he said no no no no no if you eat of that tree it's okay you know you wouldn't die and the deception was you could disobey god with no consequences you could disobey god with no retaliation from god as it were and eve was deceived and fell and the deceiver throughout every age has continued to deceive going after age after age after age until the whole world is deceived it's his job to deceive because deceit is how he pulls your attention away from god the act of causing someone to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid and this whole world we live in is deceived but abraham in the message of god of this evil is says the world seems to be the most evil age it ever was never in any age that women act like that never but just before the time has god lost control or is he permitting another agency to control i wonder the true answer to this question is there's two opposing spirits in the world today at work but everybody say there can be no more than two two heads one of them is the holy spirit the other one is the spirit of the devil in the last days in deception so the spirit of the devil is in deception hallelujah now i'm going to base my torch right on here for the rest of the text our message the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil spirit working in deception the people of the earth are now making their choice you see this the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise of her for this age showing that it is christ the devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by error so god is calling to the holy ghost but the devil is also calling through the unholy spirit by the spirit of error by perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning and i'm sharing these friends because there are many people in here today and there are many who in new mexico are different stages because there are three levels of deception there's deception of the world deception of the church deception in the message so there are people who are in church and they're deceived by the stuff in the world cylinder and the people who are in church and they're received by churches and what's happening in the religious realm and it doesn't matter to deceive any message i don't think i have time to get into all of it today but just a layer foundation the first level of deception of the world is you don't need god that's the first reception in the world on the world level you don't need god and we have a world now where people depend on science and technology and computers and information and money and success and these things where people go after and people say i don't need god they don't want to hear about god as far as they're concerned if they work hard and do what he's supposed to do and they go down that road in fake success fake success and because some have money and they can pay a doctor they don't need to come and pray to god because they can pay the doctor they live with a mindset you only live once which is also a lie that's a great deception because after this there's another accounting you have to account for [Applause] so do everything you could do because you only live once and enjoy life and they don't know they are digging their goals straight to hell god not in the picture they don't quote a god for nothing you know when people have never been to church never entered a church building have no place for god in their lives have no consideration that's where these brute beasts who walk the earth they have no connection to god they don't acknowledge god whenever i say the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom but that's the world that we in the world is deceived and they trust in all their machinery and their project technology and science and all these things education and university how many young people went to school and get messed up grew up in church grew up knowing the word and gone and here two courses and messed up [Music] they can't definitely lose their anchor with god they want you to prove god they want you to do this this is this what change is deception they have just been deceived into a delusion to accept what is fake as is as if it's real and the devil is just happy because those are not the ones you worried about because if you're not trying to go after god you just lost you just haven't you the devil already put you you he didn't even pay attention because the devil is a religious being he's a spiritual being he really want to sit in the temple of god so once he gets you to discount god completely and live your life without god he can leave you in a bucket as brood beast walking around the earth let me police until you let it thing i knew you he not even business with you he doesn't have to bring false doctrine to somebody who don't know about god anybody with me there's no great deceit with somebody you don't want to hear about god there are people who just don't want to know about god and i have to say you know because i know people who are in the message who don't believe in god now it's true so they have fallen for the receipt of away from god completely they don't hear anything nothing about any spiritual being they believe in nature and the universe any planets and they spend all the time in that living in scientific realm and now you have the metaverse and all these new things pulling your attention but you realize it's either moving closer to god or away from god [Applause] but i brought him in the message a thinking man's filter he said has come to the whole world has become a great deception of what is really true and what's right in politics in social affairs in school in everything it becomes a deceitfulness we all have family members loved ones they tell them come to church what church i want to go to church tell people jesus is coming they don't want to accept it but that's the majority of the world we live in over the last few years every religious group has recorded a decrease in people who believe this is not just christianity nowhere this is the nature of the world as satan is making in rules and receiving people because if you're not worshipping the true god you worship the devil you might call it technology you might call it science you might call it philosophy you might call it psychology you might call it new age you might call it nature you might call it meditation you might call it all kind of different memes because while he can go by all those names there's only one way to worship the true living god and the overcomet and now is to worship the father in spirit and in truth [Applause] i hope you get it this way but if branham can say you can make anything your god so for some people it's their business is the gardener and the true god not nowhere in the picture you haven't even prayed to god but he's spending all your time trying to build it in your business god go nowhere and then you have those who they have big success millionaires billionaires but what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and to lose his soul that's in the world they do acknowledge god it's their achievement and they have all of the books and all the guidance and if you don't balance these things as a believer you get tied up out there because you are under a different covenant once you hear this gospel you're you're on a different covenant you know your life i'm here to break it to you or i'm happy to break you your life could never be the same once you hear this truth you have been exposed to too much to go to the world and do foolishness [Applause] and god help me i've seen too many young people go to school get two certificates and feel they don't need god anymore and they're born and grew up in the message they get so qualified they educate themselves out of god that is why the prophet took the position he did you know he wasn't against education but if two or three degrees will take away from god is best is best yeah you have none because if god is not the focus of your life you're wasting time you are wasting time so you have to know your balance young people if you do not put god first everything you do will crumble and fail and that law is not one for the world this is for you and here i'm talking to you because you know better you know the truth you know what god expects from you you move god from number one place you will find years to get back in place until you put him back where he's supposed to be but i can guarantee you with everything that's in me if god is put in his place forget it no weapon no power nothing could come against you [Applause] so friends don't get caught up in the deception of the world living in church and still in the world you know by the receptioning world what is that the music the worldly styles and fashion because you're not you're not all the way in church i'm painting a picture of three levels of deception deception in the world any church and any message people receive in the world and then now they're coming to church and there are people in all kind of church you cannot compare this to any other thing friends this is not a pentecostal church it's in the mediterranean baptist church and people have come into the message with the baptist ways with the methodist ways with the pentecostal ways with the catholic ways with the worldly ways and hoping that the message could conform to these ways well the message is not designed like that friends this message is to bring us closer to christ than the world has ever gotten before outside of jesus walking on the earth and that alpha church is to produce an omega word pride through a prophet messenger that unlocks scriptures that were there all along you cannot find this in the catholic church you cannot find this in a bible study you cannot find this in a methodist church i don't care how learning the theologian is [Applause] hallelujah go to his grace found an imperfect vessel to bring a perfect message oh you don't hear me this morning [Applause] i thank god for the clarity of his word you know because elijah wasn't perfect moses wasn't perfect david wasn't perfect paul wasn't perfect irene has paul martical number brother branham wasn't perfect but i brought him you want me to return the phone call came by the man i'm around outside the house and said tell them i'm not here and god said oh you could do that what kind of behavior is that go to the property to be more sincere an imperfect man with a perfect message hallelujah so i can't be focused any man i want to focus any message when jesus came i set a heal on his sabbath day they say hold this market healing but any spiritual man would know what to do on his sabbath it had people red sabbath field for people say i can't follow jesus you know because we do on the sabbath day and god i said it at the beginning god loves to confuse people because only the elect cannot be deceived god loves to present things to people so that you could understand truth can the church say amen so not only is there deception in the world but a deception in the church with people who actually think that you could be uh you could come the church and that's okay i can't tell you how much people tell me you you know i'm a born again you're born again well we born again and here it's not you the party on friday we go in i said well the cannabinoid again i am it's not that kind of bone again i'm not sure what kind of bone again you are but my kind of bone again is not that kind of born again it's not that i'm better than nobody else but it kinda born again i am prevents me from going into that kind of place if you're kind of born again let's go then that's a different kind the can i want is the old-fashioned kind of dogo party that don't drink that anybody with me this morning maybe you and version two or version three are they born again but the one i want is the original version one the one that felony they are pentecost that original version i don't want to upgrade it he improved the modified the altered the water down the hybrid and one of the original that make peter stagger out of the upper room and they want to know if peter drunk because it was too early on a sunday morning for peter to be drunk anybody with me this morning [Applause] so message believers get pressured by people in other i don't know what to call them denominations groups beliefs why you do this why are you dressed so why you're thinking and how this message and it's when you feel earlier and it's a thing as an organizing and you can't defend it because you can't go into the scripture to find out how this thing unfolds friends is a warfare you know jesus defense in the wilderness wasn't spiritual you know it was the order no it was scripture you know it was a man shall not live it was it is written it is written it is written can you pass the it is written exam can you defend your work but it is written [Applause] i was driving the car yesterday and he taught coming to me i say you know what the devil is a better believer than plenty believers in him because the bible said he devil believe and he trembling and people here have believed and it's hard to trim tribulation the devil there's studying scripture and reading and trying to find believing and he doesn't believe in and you there you you want to believe is that three kind of believers we have trick at the never totally believe we are unbelievers make believers and true believers the devil has been true enough all your doubts he don't have it in him the devil had doubting what you are supposed to get you know when you doubt that's a the devil is out you know because he know but eventually when he encountered that that that that wilderness experience it was like votes of electricity that knocked him out you know when jesus came jesus was the greatest headache he ever had on him because he saw when adam fell he saw david fall he saw joshua fall he saw elijah fall but when jesus come and he waited for jesus to fall he waiting he waiting he waiting he waiting he waiting and he's still waiting he's still waiting because jesus we said it on bible study he conquered sin in his flesh brought sin under subjection tempted as we were but never fell did ever say this is different this is different let's kill him because we don't know what this is you know whatever you see something you don't understand you want to kill it he said let's kill this thing because we don't know what it is and when he killed jesus oh my it was the biggest mistake he made because that is what god was waiting for to reproduce himself he said take me to calvary before that you see my always not yet come but when it was time he can't wait he said put a nail in my hand it hurt him but it's a bigger picture i need to reproduce myself i need to multiply myself and now we can declare because i live you are going to live also [Applause] can the church say amen hallelujah give the lord a shout of praise so i am not gonna let nobody deceive me if this is not that i'll keep this until that comes can the church say amen there's no other truth on the earth outside of this great message brought by malachi 4 god orchestrated everything to bring this message to us [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated there are many things i will never understand and there's some things i don't want to try to understand because quite frankly it's not important it's not important you know how much things but the brand i'm taught but there are certain seeds that are for the bride only for the elect there's certain promises but a punch that are tied to my body being changed you see them kind of thing that is the kind of thing i like because i could know about rome and the ecclesiastical council and i could spend all kind of time with that but that is not connected to this bodyguaran you see missing limbs getting back restored and them damn kind of thing i'm talking like a trini right now you see damn kind of thing it's the thing i want because if this body fall down i want to get back up again the world cultural churches have nothing to do with me being transformed but give me the promises of my family being restored that's what i want oh come on now because the devil the world council of churches none of them can stop your son from coming out to the grips of the hands of the devil give me the promises of god [Applause] by these promises we become partakers not by the knowledge or the information we become partakers but by these promises we become partakers of his divine nature it's his promise for your family it's his promise for your health it's his promise for a new body is his promise for the holy ghost his promise of adoption his promise of perfection his promise of a wonderful glorious baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] [Music] the elect cannot be received so the deception in the world can't touch the elect anybody thanks god that they have been chosen to not be deceived by the technology and the systems and the education and the degrees you may be seated i have my degree you know but it couldn't take the god i was in my heart when i went to the university i operate a certain way the god i was in my heart took me through my degree i pick up my paper i woke up with my paper but the jesus in my heart he is still there and then lose my joy lose my testimony no no no no no no no and it's not me keeping myself it was his grace his grace his grace was greater his grace was greater than my strength his grace was greater than my understanding his grace was greater and he is able to preserve you in your school in your job you may be seated i've seen too many people get a job they say lord bless me with a job and they get a job and they can't find them in church you know what that means is the world receive them you know it's not doctrine it's not it's not false teaching years in a message and they can't find themselves back in church so foundational deception got them they have no time there's only time they're caught up working hard they're working hard they're working hard they're working hard they're working out they're working hard for what for what to what end to what purpose but i thank god for you who are here because you are here you're in church immediately to this spot we're gonna go a little deeper but we made it to this spot you made it to a spot where you recognize that without god you can't do nothing am i right that without god you can't make it am i right is there anybody who feels that way without god you have no hope without god you can't go to work tomorrow without god you don't know how to start your day without god you know how we are going to make it so we have moved past the deception in the world and we are contending for the deception in the church and moving now to the deception in the message [Music] you may be seated a few more minutes not every teaching is for the elector there are nice christians out there in nice churches what can an evangelical church of god in christ and all kind of wonderful behaviors and listen the thing is we can't elect nobody i can't elect you you can elect me god does the election so i cannot get upset with somebody because they're not elected it is not my place to judge your election i just have to preach you word that speaks to those who are the elect because they elect like a certain kind of food [Music] the elect like to eat a certain kind of food and are working on me because i'm an expert at food so i woke up but i understand the difference between good food and bad food it's a different between a little rice and peas but when you add a little salad add a little a little meat and a little pie and a little i like christmas he had a pastel and he added a little potato salad and a scalloped potato and what else is there will it have some little smoke ribs i wonder too what else is there because nothing shall pass by the punch nothing nothing i have to do all the work but nothing shall pass even on the menu i want it even if it isn't good i want it come on now because if this is prepared at the table for me by the heavenly father who is the master chef put out a whole food course [Applause] [Music] why settle you maybe see that for some people is is peace and rice one day then rice and peas and the third is peace with rice next year's peace and rice but you see the elect the food that has been sorted for this age is the food brother pop well that they cooked in the first age that kind of food plus the food from the second age plus the money from the turret age plus the money from the fourth age plus the menu and in this great banquet we can eat from anywhere eat at any time every sunday we come we can take some addition take some of that fat some family virtue knowledge temperance don't leave this morning without tasting everything don't leave this morning without tasting and see that the lord is good oh come on now somebody help me preach this morning [Applause] listen [Applause] this is a controversial statement but i'm not sure about dieting in the bible because the bible said they shall eat and plenty and be satisfied so i'm telling you you could eat this morning without fear without restriction you could get on anything you could eat good you could eat enough food today and you could get some new food tomorrow and they get food and you can take home to your children take over your wife take home for your husband take home oh god help me this morning carry someone work tomorrow let them see your joy unspeakable your cup running over you're bubbling on the inside [Applause] [Music] we saw like a crazy bunch of people but that's okay hallelujah but eclipse [Applause] i was saying this morning as i get ready i say lord oh you take us through it i was watching my robin message and i said by the grace of god last year somewhere is 25 years the lord take me through ministry all kind of thing i've seen i used to be like a new kid in a block but now i'm feeling like i'm getting on a little older side a little bit i feel like for five years i was a 16 year old preacher but as i getting a little older now i can start to say like david i was young and now i'm old but i've never seen the righteous forsaken this thing's still eating good it is all over me it is keeping me alive it is joy unspeakable and this thing has room for your family for your children for those that are around you because it promises unto you and your children and to them that are far off as many as the lord shall call and you are the supposed to be the witnesses unto me [Applause] oh i'm trying to get out of the pulpit but god help me this morning oh give me the old-fashioned sin killing sky blue holy ghost revival [Music] [Applause] i can't judge nobody because i made my full share of mistakes not my fair share you know no full share of mistakes i make my full of mistakes but god's grace has kept me i didn't keep myself i couldn't bring myself to church i have to repent daily as we all have to repent dearly but god knows my heart i'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is god i'm looking for perfection i'm looking for oh come on now i'm waiting for those seven thunders to utter their voices to that group and i believe i'm part of that group i believe i'm part of that [Applause] you may be seated [Music] abraham wasn't perfect david wasn't perfect joshua wasn't perfect elijah wasn't perfect isaiah wasn't perfect peter wasn't perfect john wasn't perfect paul wasn't perfect but abram wasn't perfect but jesus was perfect and he says beep therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect and the bible says they who have gone before without us listen in that sentence structure they cannot come to perfection without asana we become the perfection that they could not achieve oh god help me this morning when this pride comes to perfection it'll be so perfect it'll be so close that it'll be enough perfection to cover for they who are without us cannot be made perfect so when we connect to the whole body all the loose gaps in the body will be sealed off by this end time pride by a perfect message oh help me help me this morning somebody give god a shout our praise come on brian lift your head up square your shoulders come on you for such a time as this this is your time this is your season this is your hour this is what we have been waiting for [Applause] [Applause] you have escaped the great deception in the world you have escaped the deception in the church the message has to be rejected christ had to be rejected but a brand of message has to be rejected even people in the message have to reject it because that's falling away that has happened first before god could come people have been exposed to the truth and they can't see the truth no more when in reality is they don't want to live up to the life standard remember branham says things like so sweet and humble so sweet so humble so gentle attractive holy ghost you at your behavior without a transformation could produce that that's not intellectual that's not figuring it out that is you getting so much into the spirit and yielding to the spirit and the holy ghost taking control your vessel your lamb so filled that your way of doing things which has failed no longer is even necessary because the holy ghost does the work all god wants is for us to get out of the way you know you driving i got your god let me take over the connor right now some of us have jesus as a backseat driver and he want to drive the car he wants you to come out of the driver's seat and you sit down and shut up and just worship and thank god you want to tell god turn here turn here no attorney i want this job i want this job i don't have ex oh my god say but i don't want you have that job you see god talks to us without using these words you know by allowing things to happen that you want to happen and by shutting down things you don't want to happen god always talking to us let me say that one more time god had to come audibly and say my son don't take that job no but when your job gets rejected there's god saying that wasn't for you so whenever something don't happen that you want to happen you should be the first person to be jumping and shouting you trying to buy a car and you're getting through the bank saying no watch now started jumping because the car you're trying to buy is too small god wants to get a bigger one oh you you need to reframe your thinking you know who your father is so don't get depressed when things don't work out when i was trying to get a loan i was trying to get at this and i'm so depressed because my church is your vex you're just getting even it taking your 47 minutes to get in the spirit the preacher has to walk punch and punch punching punching punching for you to finally snap out what happened last week for you to say well thank god jesus died for me all that work because you can't separate the voice of god in your life every day by allowing things you know nothing is accident with god nothing could come your way unless god allow it it's time we act more mature there's no mistake with god what you're supposed to have you will have it and what you're not supposed to have you're not going to get it thank god in everything give him thanks i don't know who this helping this morning i'm trying to close out [Music] so we have moved past the deception of the world and the school and the education and my professor i remember when i was in primary school i said come back home and every time i was very pleased with my standard five teacher and for those who don't know me i was a very good student so i would come home and the first thing i would say is cersei every day was cersei seriously and tell my parents he just don't even come here without saying anything a little bit again still become the gospel yes because we're looking at this everything cersei said to cersei distance this is anything with life and he was a very good teacher really really fantastic and he was so good ever and he was a christian so he was he was inclined to listen to him but something he was saying was wrong not scriptural but cersei and cersei that's he better stop that seriously better put it down right away pick it up it's so easy if you're not being guided to fall into a trapping because listen that's how deceptive it's so logical it does make sense it if it don't make sense you wouldn't go for it look i hear somebody do a whole long teaching on joseph this is mary and joseph and jesus a whole teaching on joseph stuff that not written know any bible and somebody who was there say you hear what you say i say he filling in blanks they're not even there because you know i'm a student of scripture so i'm like i don't know where you find that and he said yeah but i hope called us that i say yeah you're right but what he said so nice it sounds real nice you know he do a whole analysis of joseph and analyze joseph and i say but that is not nowhere in the bible but it sounded very nice and if you don't take the time to study and listen to the word and take over the tv and take off the netflix and take out the radio and you know the same radio listen to a good point like an audio team funding right or i know all the technology you could play any profit message you could play all i know these things right i just making sure because some people did somehow they call it somebody listen to everything else it's two hours of cnn and they can tell me all the things in gaza strip and the ching and the this tsunami and thing and what's not chronological order tell me two scriptures you read this week well i ain't nothing too much reading or i was really listening listen well listen to the bible this age is really easier in many ways you know i was driving this morning to church listening to these scriptures these same scriptures that i read this morning i kept playing these three scriptures over and over any card that's all i did whole trip up to the church i played matthew 24 i played this christian the whole trip that's what i'm doing playing it over and over and over if not i didn't read it before but i want this thing to be in me every word i want it to be in me i can listen to the news i can listen to music you have choices that's how i i'm not telling you that's what you do all the time but you have choices people load music on their phone and they're there with a headphone and and they had fun on the ting and thing and thinking what you listen to and work how do you want to grow i want to stay in spirit because i said it before i could guarantee you you kind of been listening to a spoken word tape or a song and then end up casting out your next door position any work it is too big of a leap the leap is too big you have to already be holy spirit to reach that level if you're up here you would just look at them and just feel sad and pray for them because your in your spirit but you dear you listening to conscious music you want to be conscious or i don't know what i don't know what they call it now out three loop on these things but whatever it is now that you want to listen to that keep you positive this is your workout you you walk in and people walk people walk in and exercise exercising great exercise but what are you listening to because what you eat is what you becoming now i heard somebody say recently i really like it because i like stuff that helps you live life we have too much spiritual religious people who don't know how to balance it for every life and he says jesus says man shall not eat by bread alone but by every word that we said ultimately god no this is not scripture i've given you what i want to say no but this makes sense and i like it because i see i will do it for myself he said how much time he'd have spent eating when he did come he says you might eat breakfast you might smell like eating lunch you might isn't it he said if you spend time in a day eating and you're spiritual what you consume spiritually is not at least that's something wrong because you eat to live so jesus imagine not live by bread alone so what you consume alone but by the words so he said god was typing eaten naturally with your spiritual sustenance so you need your natural sustenance to live what about your spiritual sustenance so you spend 10 minutes on breakfast 50 minutes in breakfast half an hour on lunch half an hour on think so it just been a hour and a half in eaton could you commit a hour and a half in eating spiritual food could you have the discipline because everybody as far as i know discipline breakfast up breakfast ready at lunch what time is lunch what time is lunch lunch already yet discipline you've got to push them to get disciplined but who can say let me go and time to pray let us let us pray time to read the bible can we become that discipline so what you consume that drives your life becomes both natural because you need bread god wasn't saying don't eat bread you say man shall not live by bread alone so you need the bread but you need a word that proceed out in the mouth of god as well but where's the balance especially in this day that trying to take away your time your time you're going to work your time you're working at home your time you're doing this and and you don't make people don't want to make time to pray they don't want time to make to read the bible but they get to be first thing on facebook or youtube or tech talk or instagram and the list will keep going on and on because the devil have a factory manufacturing time waste and tools all of them have one agenda you know it's not entertainment it's time to take away your time for worship god that's what it really is i'm not saying at all that please they purpose the objective you know but if you can't find time for god that helps you censor by bringing a policeman on the inside what you're doing with the rest of your time then you're out of control [Applause] and that's a deception i'm trying to bring a place to a close here so the deception in the message now the musician can begin to come people now have their own message and because they have the books and the tapes they are comfortable that that is what it takes to make it you know you'd be surprised how many people just believe because i in the message i'm making it and that's the reception and it gets worse now and i want to address a few things with this especially not doing this pandemic because a lot of people know who they they they want to connect here connect here connect these are connectors it's like the old tfct connection board thing they plug in here they plug in here they plug in here they plug in here no accountability they under no pastor which rapture you go into when god say i'll give you pastors to feed you i'm addressing the church here but i'm also bringing to a level of consciousness of the deception in the message because the five-fold ministry has a purpose for the perfecting of these sins so you cannot be perfected by listening to a tip a tape is a tool it's an element it's a transfer device but god has a plan that's why you have ministers now i cannot be held responsible for ministers who doing craziness so you kind of put a blanket statement that we supposed to listen to tapes and i see only way to do it because everybody wrong that cannot that car cut it because whether god have one two three five around the world ten fifteen twenty that's for him to know because my job is not to evaluate any other minister my accountability is to my heavenly father let me anybody with anybody with me this morning the connection we have as a local sovereign church is vertical in them our accountability is a gardener so once god is pleased brother didn't know what i'm gonna preach today you know he has confidence in the vertical connection that i getting fed from above because if i do have my own plug then we're in trouble and you know you have to get your own plug aha you know you have to get your own connection i am the vine you are the branches oh oh so there comes a point where the ministry is until we all come there's a limit on the ministry you know but the ministry has a purpose so i want to challenge you know of the deception and the message with people who said i'm saying well i hear play any profit tapes home that take anywhere it's important to pay the profit tax but what church are you in and who is your pastor because you have to be held to account so people sit along at home deceived for years not under any accountability not no they don't want the discipline of being held to account by the ministry that god put in place they're not paying tithes to nowhere they have no home church but any message and they're quick to say well they should be playing tapes every sunday too and comedy pulpit really deception and the message and then you have those who when you go through the message the empire king buildings that believe you already have one if it will shoot this one man this one chill just one group at telling your church friends don't follow me you know you see the holy ghost but obviously this is not to over church you know this is the lord's church and if by his grace i'm standing here follow me only as i follow christ because i i want to be clear you have you have deception any message but but if it's not true that church or you're not connected to this one or this one that you can't make it where is that in the word you remember that brandon said any church that claimed that it false that's any prophet message and they have people walking around saying well because i am in this church or i'm in that church oh i believe this and this person is my apostle or my pastor or whatever friends brother branham was a messenger of this age just as paul was a message of his age but ibrahim was not in the fightful ministry he was above the father ministry he was a star in the right hand of god the prophet that is describing the five well it's not messenger status we're talking about you know god but it brought me to the work of me and of an evangelist until he was operating as prophet but he was a star he was a messenger he was above the fivefold but it's only fivefold it's held to account to god you know there's no between the prophet and the ministry you know and these are the deceptions in the message that this brother so and so or that brother so and so or this version or this doctrine or this teaching and everybody believe it this way and this mystery that needs to be unfolded what was brother branham message to do not unfold every mystery and when god finished with somebody doesn't he take them off the earth so if brother branham wasn't finished wouldn't god have left him to finish it so isn't it the fact that byron is gone meant his job is over so isn't every mystery laying any books and tapes and don't we all have access by the spirit to go into the books and tapes and find out what's applicable to us [Applause] so i'm challenging us and as paul taught his followers at the time he said follow me as i follow christ you know in other words hold me to account by going to the same book the same scriptures and fortifying yourself by the word per adventure i say something and they could come to me and have a conversation around it so we can make sure we say any right thing and brother branham taught us how to address all these things you see if something is said to understand then let's have a conversation around the world but in the message we have people who are comfortable that well are connected or in this church and they have no worship remember the brandon taught us if there's no worship there's no god no opening of the world relevant to that specific local church at a particular point in time there's nothing wrong with playing a team there's nothing wrong with listening to somebody that's not the issue but the reality is i better offer the ministry but anthony but it's even we have a responsibility to this local church i'm not being measured by the success of any other group we have a responsibility to preach heaven high and hell hot and for you to understand the levels of deception in the world so you can be driven to the holy ghost not to hesitate tabernacle but to god himself because that is your husband i'm not your husband he is your husband and by the branham was like eliezer just to catch the attention of a bride to introduce her to her husband is he waiting for you you know anna waiting for you know is he waiting for you and every message every service is to bring us closer to preparation to being able to leave this place can we change same man [Applause] deceived in the message being comfortable to know but not prepared to live so we know about broadly kindness you know but we are doing it we have oats we have grudges believers in the message what's not the message has the the award for the most amount of people who can't shake hands in the message itself we win the award worldwide this is not true nanotechnology worldwide because he don't believe it so and she believes so on this doctrine and this teaching and this teaching and this teaching and and people cannot agree on the same one message well i hate to break it to you everybody cannot be right if they read it from the same as you'll not have a different interpretation it cannot be better punch everybody right because there can be 15 weeks for this thing and only god is the interpreter of his word there has to be one way that we leave in this place and we have to all fight for that one way and i made it clear he said perfect love you say the holy ghost itself the person of christ it can't be true me a cabbage from minister it has to be your relationship with god that's the truth [Applause] people are deceived and comfortable they have made local church history bright history and that is a pattern around the world this is an around the world thing made local church history bright history every church has its own history i could spend a whole set of time here talking about from kai well to grandi to think to when he was in marrow and he went to go martin and we went on to maraval and but how would that bring you any closer to you leaving here [Music] but over two minutes this morning he found the first message i preached in 1997. so i can spend a whole set of time now talking about what i said in that first mention how we're tied to the great going home of the church i'm happy if only you know but that is local choice history people make a whole doctrine and teaching in this message around this is what happened here and this one and if you're not part of this you're out of out of what and this is why we operate a certain way in this church bright history is is a global thing and it affects all the locations in a different way i don't have to be part of your church issues or your student story to make it because god is dealing with us differently the same way paul had to write to the thessalonians and the ephesians and the colossians and the hebrews and the romans we all have to have our personal testimony our personal experience and because i don't spend five hours talking about my experience doesn't negate my experience and because you spent five hours talking about yours doesn't make yours mine but we all have to come into the unity of the faith we all have to come into our preparation to leave this place and go to the rapture i'm trying to close but i just want this it was on my heart because i'm tired of seeing people being manipulated and deceived into all kind of stuff from the world from the church system from the message that we're the angel in this church in whose church is he injured in exactly which church because brother branham said one time he said i saw the angel he came to my room i didn't see him for six months he just looked in and walked away so i want to know how brother branham wasn't locking the angel neck and put him under the bed and say cargo because if not i can't tell him that you're not with me but abraham said he hidden he hadn't heard from the angel for six months so if the prophet hadn't heard from it for six months when they say the angel is in this church or they find a way to lock him but if you don't know the message and the scriptures i know how god operates you will fall for that and then it is used to build faith and confidence in people because outside of that they have no faith and confidence because our faith and conviction should rest on the word itself jesus said it paul said it be not deceived let no man deceive you this gospel is real the revelation of the word is real this word will bring us to perfection if we put aside our differences but aside our personal issues and yield to god god will bless you for the effort i challenge you to spend more time with you but i challenge you to spend more time in prayer i challenge you to spend more time consecrated i challenge you above all else because what separates now in this bride i have been called but i'm not going to read it but but i'm but but about speaking only two spirits working in the framework of the church one is our unholy spirit and one is the holy spirit itself that brings us into relationship with god brings us into communion with god brings us to fellowship with god brings us into the presence of god bring it into a condition of perfect love that we can enter into that place and that's what's important friends family differences begin to fade away these issues begin to fade away the distractions begin to fade away and it becomes just you and god alone lord it's me lord i thank you that i escaped the deception of the world i thank you i escaped the deception of the church and reception in the message that i'm all right when i believe but lord i need the holy ghost and i'm clear that i have to get it since i believe i want to change on the inside i want to change my walk in my talk that's what god is fighting for you and him not the group on him but you and him as an individual where he could see himself in you and he can say there's my spirit flowing freely that's when you reach a position of not seeing anything outside of what god wants you to see and that's what god has fought for to bring relationship with him listen friends god is no respecter of persons god is a jealous god people have built up kingdoms and god is also very good at breaking down kingdoms any church any group any system that comes together that tries to replace what he is god will shut it down and he's very good at doing it because he's about his relationship with his people so we thank god we have escaped all the corruption escape false christ escape force teaching escape false doctrine and our singular focus is the baptism of the holy ghost our singular focus is a perfect church our singular purpose is an adopted church our singular purpose is a church where the holy ghost moving in it may the lord richly bless you [Applause] thank you father give him praise today hallelujah lift up your hands oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah yay man i will go let's sing it oh you have called me and i will answer oh lead me lord who and i will go oh lead me along oh lean me along oh when i will follow oh lead me along oh and i
