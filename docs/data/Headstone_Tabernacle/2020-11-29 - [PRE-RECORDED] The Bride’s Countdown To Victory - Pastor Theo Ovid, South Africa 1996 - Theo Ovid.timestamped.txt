[32:26] faith who is he that overcometh the
[32:29] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[32:31] is the son of God this is he that came
[32:34] by water and blood even Jesus Christ not
[32:37] by water only but by water and blood and
[32:40] it is the spirit that beareth witness
[32:43] because the spirit is truth for there
[32:45] are tree that bear record in heaven the
[32:47] Father the word and the Holy Ghost and
[32:49] these three are one and there are tree
[32:51] that bear witness in Earth the spirit
[32:53] the water and the blood and these three
[32:55] agree in one may God a blessing to
[32:57] reading of his word you may be
[33:01] seated amen hallelujah if our
[33:07] title the brides come down to
[33:15] Victory and an inspiration Pioneers to
[33:18] achieve oh then said the brid come to
[33:22] defeat but the Bride come down to
[33:24] Victory because the bride will have
[33:26] victory do you believe that for message
[33:30] faces of Victory but was saying and
[33:32] anyone and he read this scripture and he
[33:35] said anyone of you know that in Olympics
[33:37] or any other athleticals is no matter if
[33:40] you arrive first in the race but if you
[33:42] haven't played the game according to the
[33:43] rules you are
[33:46] disqualified so you have to play the
[33:48] rule
[33:49] right praise God it say not who have the
[33:52] biggest church who have the biggest
[33:53] Ministry or who have the biggest gift
[33:54] who have the biggest this who have
[33:56] biggest whatever that's not the point we
[33:59] got to play it according to the
[34:01] rules oh do you believe that you may be
[34:05] seated so if you haven't played the game
[34:08] ACC the rules you're disqualified you
[34:10] have to play the rule right and that's
[34:12] the way it is with human life you can't
[34:14] play the rules of the game of Life wrong
[34:17] and expect to win you have got to play
[34:19] it according to God's word and the
[34:22] purpose that you were brought here for
[34:25] now there are so many people that
[34:26] doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose
[34:28] in life especially in this day that we
[34:31] now live in praise God he said let me
[34:34] say this that there ought to be higher
[34:36] Ambitions in the human life and
[34:38] Christians should set the affection on
[34:40] higher Ambitions so as a Christian we
[34:42] have to have ambition we have to have
[34:45] purpose we have to have a sense of
[34:47] Destiny as brother Blair was talking
[34:50] about this morning we have to feel that
[34:52] we going somewhere we have to feel that
[34:54] we going to achieve something do you
[34:57] believe that
[34:58] amen praise God Amen you may be seated
[35:02] so the Christians should set their
[35:03] affections and high Ambitions and I
[35:05] think it would pay us all to sit down
[35:07] and wonder why we are here in the first
[35:08] place andever who is kind enough to
[35:10] bring us here we ought to consider it
[35:12] and ask him what he would have us to do
[35:15] the purpose of Us coming to fulfill what
[35:18] he has purpose for us but we seem to
[35:21] just wanted to keep up with the world so
[35:23] the Bible said that we could overcome
[35:26] the world
[35:27] [Applause]
[35:29] no he didn't say your feelings tell you
[35:31] that he said the Bible
[35:34] [Applause]
[35:35] [Music]
[35:36] said and the Bible is the
[35:39] word and if the Bible said we can
[35:42] overcome the world we can overcome
[35:45] it
[35:47] Hallelujah my I feel the countown is
[35:51] on praise God you know you're going to
[35:53] get the
[35:54] victory Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[35:58] amen hallelujah you may be seated so how
[36:01] do we do it not by keeping with the
[36:03] Fashions of the world but the Bible said
[36:06] that
[36:07] faith is the
[36:14] victory oh
[36:16] Hallelujah that overcomes the world and
[36:20] you know what give Fai seven

[36:25] Thunders praise God praise God in other
[36:30] words the kind of faith that the seventh
[36:32] tunder is given it is going to be
[36:34] defeated it's
[36:36] Unstoppable oh Hallelujah do you believe
[36:40] that oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[36:45] you may be seated he's talking about

[40:32] Craftsman make out of you that which he
[40:36] could use and that which he could
[40:39] control and that which he could power if
[40:42] this certain little craft that has been
[40:45] made different and been craft out by the
[40:47] Master's Hand should ever stick into
[40:50] some weeds along in Shallow Waters
[40:53] there's a power behind it a little boat
[40:55] that the master can turn on and push it
[40:58] into deep Waters again God wants to mle
[41:03] and make us what he wants us to be but
[41:07] how can we do that or how can God do
[41:10] that when we won't even stand still for
[41:12] him to do it we want to be our own
[41:15] Master we want to think our own way of
[41:18] thinking and many people come into the
[41:20] church and join the church and put their
[41:23] name on the book and doesn't even
[41:25] consider what the Church believes and
[41:29] check up with that church how they
[41:31] preach the word of God whether they
[41:33] stand for Full Gospel or not they just
[41:35] pick out a portion at a Creed floating
[41:39] drifting never among to
[41:42] anything huj oh hallelujah hallelujah
[41:45] but let me tell you something tonight
[41:47] you on the in and outside of this
[41:49] building you're going to wind up at the
[41:51] destination one of these days that's
[41:53] going to be in the Valley of the Shadows
[41:54] of death I would advise you this hour to
[41:56] prepare to meet the god that will have
[41:59] to meet you at that hour you'll either
[42:01] meet him as a
[42:03] masterpiece that he has worked on or a
[42:06] floating piece of
[42:07] Driftwood to your final destination so
[42:11] don't you just drift along and Float
[42:13] around just for a better job or better
[42:16] dress or better television or a new car
[42:19] oh Hallelujah Don't Drift around for
[42:21] that when you join Church you should
[42:23] first seek out find out what that church
[42:26] stand
[42:27] for my God if it bringing Discord get
[42:30] out if it's sowing see the Discord get
[42:33] out because this is a message of
[42:35] Brotherly kindness this is a message of
[42:38] the love of God
[42:41] [Applause]
[42:44] hallelujah so is it just a Mia place
[42:47] that people go to fellowship or is it
[42:49] the place that preaches the word of God
[42:51] that stands for every principle that
[42:53] Jesus died for you should do that just
[42:55] don't float in and go with the tide
[42:57] because straight is the gate and narrow
[42:58] is the way that lead to eternal life oh
[43:02] blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:05] hallelujah praise God so don't be a d
[43:09] word be

[43:13] with defeat it's hard to think about
[43:16] Victory you may be seated it come like
[43:18] you never taste victory before you see
[43:21] like a box in a ring let's say never
[43:24] taste victory before every time he go in
[43:25] that ring he keep studying the the last
[43:27] fight he
[43:28] had he was defeated so the next time he
[43:32] go in the ring 50% in his mind saying I
[43:34] might lose this next one I will give him
[43:36] a best shot but that's not good enough
[43:39] you take that same boxer and give him a
[43:42] new trainer that could blow the
[43:44] negatives out his
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:49] mind he start to talk different I'll
[43:52] knock him out in the seventh round

[43:58] he become
[43:59] positive Hallelujah his own attitude
[44:02] changes oh praise God Amen Hallelujah

[44:30] enemy because Jesus said the same works
[44:32] I do shall you do my God to come down is
[44:37] on we are going to do the same thing he
[44:40] did oh do you believe
[44:43] that oh blessed be the name of the Lord

[45:03] [Applause]
[45:09] overcome
[45:11] [Applause]
[45:15] Hallelujah you may be
[45:18] seated now that may just hit your
[45:20] conscious
[45:21] mind that you will
[45:23] overcome it got to go down
[45:25] deeper subconscious mind you mean I have
[45:29] to overcome I can I will I do
[45:33] believe because the Bible said to him
[45:35] and overcome it and before the Bible
[45:38] could say that God must
[45:41] predestinate God must elect somebody to
[45:46] overcome in other words God knew every
[45:49] condition here in South Africa he know
[45:52] just the family you will come true he
[45:54] know just where you'll be broken know
[45:57] who your husband going to be who your
[45:58] wife is going to be and he put you still
[46:02] and tell the devil look at them they are
[46:04] going to come to
[46:09] Victory
[46:11] Hallelujah don't you know he put half an
[46:13] hour
[46:14] silence to let the devil do all that he
[46:17] can do but when that silence is
[46:20] broken The Works of the devil is
[46:23] finished a
[46:25] jubilee trumpet is sound
[46:30] [Music]
[46:32] it oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh
[46:38] hallelujah praise be to Jesus so when
[46:41] all those negatives go out then you
[46:44] could say I know I'm going to get the
[46:45] Holy Ghost I know I'm going to be healed
[46:48] I know I'm going to be delivered I know
[46:49] I'm going to get a Revival I know I'm
[46:51] going to get a breakthrough praise God
[46:54] Amen and amen and amen
[46:57] oh you may be seated praise
[46:59] God
[47:01] Daniel when he was going down into
[47:03] Babylon he was going away from his home
[47:07] he was going to have to be a slave to
[47:08] another nation of people but Daniel
[47:11] purpose in his heart no matter what they
[47:14] did to him he wasn't going to defile
[47:17] himself with the Babylonian sin and if
[47:20] we had more Gallant men like that that
[47:23] with purpose in your heart if I'm a
[47:25] Christian I'm going to find out every
[47:29] divine blessing that belongs to me and
[47:32] claim
[47:35] it listen to this if the Bible teaches
[47:39] that I can receive the Holy Spirit I'm
[47:41] going to stay on my knees till God gives
[47:45] me the Holy Spirit and just not
[47:50] dri oh do you believe that he said the
[47:54] Bible teaches I can receive the Holy
[47:56] Spirit
[47:57] I'm going to stay on my knees I'm going
[48:00] to stay on my
[48:02] knees oh Hallelujah because God's
[48:05] promise it oh blessed be the name of the
[48:08] Lord do you believe
[48:10] that you may be seated I was reading all
[48:13] Uncle Buddy Robinson life story some
[48:15] time ago he was such a great man and
[48:17] loving man a man of faith and he got to
[48:20] hungering for the holy spirit because
[48:22] the Bible taught it and it says that one
[48:25] day he was plowing corn and he stopped
[48:27] his old mule ell and got down in the
[48:29] corner he said God if you don't give me
[48:32] the baptism of the Holy Spirit when you
[48:34] come back to earth you will find my
[48:36] bones laying right here that's purposing
[48:39] in your heart that is really getting
[48:42] into business and when you get that kind
[48:45] of a purpose in your heart God is going
[48:48] to open the windows of Heaven something
[48:51] has to take place but you have got to
[48:54] get to business with God
[48:57] and have a purpose
[48:59] [Applause]
[49:02] hallelujah oh my you may be seated when
[49:06] Daniel had purpose in his heart and the
[49:08] devil made him prove it oh my so once
[49:11] you have a purpose the devil say Okay a
[49:13] purpose now I'm going to make you prove
[49:15] it do you really want the Holy Ghost do
[49:18] you really want that Revival do you
[49:20] really want that breakthrough or you
[49:22] only saying so because others saying so
[49:25] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah my God
[49:29] hallelujah but once that purpose is
[49:31] there then you are going to get that
[49:33] breakthrough you are going to get the
[49:34] Holy Ghost not just a emotion not just a
[49:38] sensation but the deity of God veil in
[49:43] [Applause]
[49:50] you so when Daniel had purpose oh yes
[49:54] and you find out that it stood good in
[49:56] the face of the hungry land and a man
[49:58] that ever come to God and ready down in
[50:00] his heart finds a settle fate it will
[50:03] stand good in the mouth of death or in
[50:05] the mou of sickness in the mouth of
[50:06] Sorrow will stand good for faith is the
[50:09] victory you have overcome by your faith
[50:11] and Abraham just a man with no certain
[50:14] purpose in life with his father and
[50:16] friends and so forth and Abraham praying
[50:18] no doubt he prayed through till he
[50:20] struck the hand of God how did he do it
[50:22] perhaps he thought like this if there's
[50:24] a God who made the ark and let Noah flow
[50:27] through he still lives today somewhere
[50:30] in the land of the heathens where he was
[50:32] sojourning he touched the hand of God
[50:35] and in there God gave him a revelation
[50:37] that there was a city and maker whose
[50:40] build and maker was God so Abraham
[50:43] wasn't just a Drifter looking for he
[50:47] don't know what he looking for he had a
[50:50] revelation that there's a city whose
[50:52] maker and Piller is God hallelujah
[50:57] oh and when you have that Revelation you
[50:59] could walk by faith my God you got
[51:02] married you keep on pressing on you pick
[51:05] up two three children you keep on
[51:06] pressing on but you're seeking a city oh
[51:10] hallelujah amen you may be seated and we
[51:13] read all Abraham's life he was a pilgrim
[51:17] and a stranger to the world for his one
[51:19] ambition was to find that City whose
[51:21] build and maker was God he struck
[51:24] something he caught God and a faith in
[51:26] that God and he fora the New Jerusalem
[51:29] and he put his back on his on his back
[51:31] and became a wonderer not just floating
[51:33] about without any purpose he had faith
[51:35] that there was a city he had a purpose
[51:38] in life to find a place and may I say
[51:40] here that one day when the battle was
[51:42] over he met the king of that City and he
[51:44] gave him communion bread and wine MDC
[51:47] and you can't listen you can't purpose
[51:50] anything of God's promise in your heart
[51:52] without finding a reality to
[51:55] it
[51:57] he said you can't purpose anything of
[52:01] God's promise in your heart without
[52:03] finding the
[52:05] reality and if there's a deep deep
[52:08] calling him there's got to be a deep to
[52:15] respond
[52:16] Hallelujah because God is a
[52:22] reality oh my you may be seated so if
[52:26] your Soul has been tormented by sins and
[52:30] doubts and ups and downs and frustration
[52:33] and there's something down in you that's
[52:35] telling you that there's somewhere you
[52:36] can overcome
[52:42] that why do you float around from church
[52:45] to
[52:46] church from place to
[52:49] place just kneel
[52:52] down till you strike
[52:55] heaven
[52:58] [Applause]
[53:01] Hallelujah just kneel down till you
[53:04] strike Heaven as I said last night go
[53:07] beyond the song barriers and then you
[53:10] have a purpose in life you have a
[53:12] purpose in belonging to the church you
[53:14] have a purpose in being baptized you
[53:16] have a purpose in what you are seeking
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:23] for
[53:24] oh my
[53:28] Hallelujah so God is Not setting up a
[53:32] bride to be ashamed of
[53:37] her he not set up a bride to be
[53:40] embarrassed by that
[53:43] bride no you may be

[59:52] seated so
[59:54] this Hallelujah
[59:57] the
[59:59] chickens have never been
[1:00:02] there so therefore it's easy for them to
[1:00:06] criticize the
[1:00:08] Eagles because they have never been
[1:00:13] there why you flying so high what you
[1:00:17] doing up there there's no boundaries to
[1:00:20] your faith there's no limit to what you
[1:00:22] can believe we can believe all things we
[1:00:26] can hope all things we can D enjoy all
[1:00:29] things put us anywhere anytime any place
[1:00:32] under any condition we going to
[1:00:35] stand oh you know what I said anywhere
[1:00:41] anytime any place you are going to stand
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:54] brother
[1:00:59] [Applause]
[1:01:06] you may be
[1:01:08] seated they say the chickens there's no
[1:01:12] such thing as the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:15] Ghost how can he say it in a chicken's
[1:01:17] Nest he's not an eagle to begin
[1:01:20] with he don't know nothing about it he
[1:01:24] never saw where the eagle has sword he
[1:01:28] never put God to a test he's never been
[1:01:31] healed by the power of almighty God
[1:01:35] therefore he doesn't know nothing about
[1:01:37] what he's talking about he don't know
[1:01:39] the Cry of the
[1:01:41] [Applause]
[1:01:46] eagle oh
[1:01:48] hallelujah oh
[1:01:50] my oh my you may be
[1:01:54] seated so God liken his Eagles his
[1:01:57] Heritage of eagles let's take the eagle
[1:01:59] what the eagle does he builds his nest
[1:02:02] way high I've watch them when they get
[1:02:05] to the highest point that they can get
[1:02:07] to build their nest that's lightened
[1:02:09] unto the Church of the Living God it
[1:02:10] makes it stand for the highest Ambitions
[1:02:13] the highest thoughts the holiest things
[1:02:17] away from the earth
[1:02:19] Mountain that is where the church takes
[1:02:21] her stand on the highest Pinnacle that
[1:02:24] she can stand
[1:02:26] oh my so there's a big difference
[1:02:29] between the eagle and the chicken both
[1:02:31] are birds but one is Earth M and the
[1:02:34] other one is
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:40] heavenbound so listen if the chicken
[1:02:44] can't get his feet off the ground don't
[1:02:45] worry he was a chicken to begin
[1:02:50] with he will never get up there and know
[1:02:53] what an eagle knows you may be seated so
[1:02:58] I watched this fellow as he was sitting
[1:02:59] there with his great big gray looking
[1:03:01] eyes watching me and I thought well
[1:03:03] there's one thing I admire about him
[1:03:05] he's not
[1:03:07] afraid and I hate a
[1:03:09] coward and God does
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:24] too
[1:03:28] Hallelujah so don't be
[1:03:31] scared
[1:03:33] Hallelujah he says now I hate a coward
[1:03:36] God us too so a man that's afraid after
[1:03:38] he's been healed to testify about it a
[1:03:41] man that God has saved and then he's
[1:03:43] ashamed to tell somebody that he's Sav
[1:03:45] and fill with the Holy Ghost I haven't
[1:03:47] got much confidence in his salvation so
[1:03:49] when you are really listen listen so
[1:03:52] when you really get it you want to tell
[1:03:58] everybody you just can't keep
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:12] still what the church needs is some more
[1:04:15] Holy
[1:04:18] Spirit the church don't need more
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:24] ministers the church don't need more
[1:04:28] explanations more deep deep deep deep
[1:04:30] deep
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:35] Revelation you may be
[1:04:37] seated Minister preach so deep you don't
[1:04:40] even know what he's talking about just
[1:04:42] wonder if he know what he talking about
[1:04:44] it's so deep you don't even understand
[1:04:45] it too deep but it needs more Holy
[1:04:49] Spirit and fire to make it
[1:04:54] move that's why the churches today are
[1:04:56] dead because there is no
[1:04:59] fire and the Holy Spirit brings
[1:05:02] [Applause]
[1:05:05] fire look it right here he say it takes
[1:05:08] fire to move the church not explanation
[1:05:13] not deep Revelation it takes the Holy
[1:05:16] Ghost and
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:20] Fire oh my Hallelujah you may be seated
[1:05:25] oh my from returning Jubilee said yes

[1:05:47] how to accept Divine Healing you can
[1:05:50] talk to them and they bre like a mule

[1:06:29] your
[1:06:31] confession he could only intercede based
[1:06:33] upon what you
[1:06:34] confess so if you have no confession he
[1:06:37] cannot do anything with what you're

[1:07:43] about the book was
[1:07:46] sealed with our Redemptive

[1:07:52] in here so you cannot claim what you

[1:08:08] released then
[1:08:11] every Redemptive
[1:08:13] blessing belongs to
[1:08:15] [Applause]
[1:08:20] you and the devil didn't want the people
[1:08:23] to see that so the ministers try to set
[1:08:27] themselves up as God between the people
[1:08:31] and the
[1:08:32] book but the seventh T of Revelation BST

[1:11:07] here but the days of the
[1:11:14] voice the voice is here on books and
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:19] tips now the spirit of Prophecy is the
[1:11:22] testimony of Jesus so the prophet left
[1:11:25] back the testimony of Jesus which is the
[1:11:27] spirit of Prophecy so he know there will
[1:11:30] come Faithful Men that will pick up the
[1:11:32] spirit of Prophecy and prophesy the same
