you feel nothing feel in my hands I we feel Victorious vibrations from Heaven this morning Jesus walking in it and the shout of the king will be in the camp so this morning before you take a sea sister in our Bibles the Psalms 1 we want to read verse one to six verse one scripture this morning Psalms one one to six it's a long time I'm trying to get to this hand blessed is the man that wokeeth not in the Council of June Godly who stands it in the way of sinners nor Sitters in the seat of this confirm but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law that he meditate day and night hear about this man what he shall be like and he shall be like a tree planted not not a sea drop planted by the rivers of water that bringing forth his fruit in his season his leave he about his Leaf notion also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper the ungodly and not so but like the chaff wish to dwind drive it away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment no sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord nor the way of the righteous but the way of the in God they Shall Perish one more time let's pray father we thank you for the scriptures we love the word we love to hear your word Lord and we pre-interpreted our hearts bless it in Jesus amen you may be seated o praise the name of the Lord thank you musicians thank you for the song service praise God but Anthony we certainly appreciate all of you coming out this morning we are open for business the Lord's business Jesus said this way I must be about my father's business okay let's go I have a title Conformity to God's will in thought purpose and action that's the title this morning Conformity to God's will in thought in purpose and action I trusted being blessed by the Bible studies and being blessed by the weekly Services Services being played and the Bible study we talk about surrender and and so on like that and I hope that it really strikes you that that God really means this because we're getting somewhere with it all right now this will conform as a verb it's to comply with rules standards or laws it is to be similar to or the same as something it is to do what other people do to be obedient or compliant usually used with two to conform to other wishes in other words they would say the building doesn't conform to local regulations as an example that's what conform is another explanation of it to act in accordance or Harmony to comply usually followed by two to conform to rules if you conform you behave in the way that you are expected or supposed to behave he did not feel obliged to conform to the rules that apply to ordinary men that's a context of using that word conform so that is a a rebel he did not feel obliged to conform to the rules that apply to ordinary men synonyms of this word conform is to fit in to follow to yield to adjust now when Keenan Abel was asked to offer up a sacrifice to God there were children they come to Asia maturity God said let me see what you your concept of me how you see me we know the story April bought a lamb slate and God respected Cain bought fruits God rejected it and God gave King offer do like a brother and I bless you too if you do it I'll I'll I let's conform let's just follow you don't even need a revelation he did that and was blessed you do that he got blessed too you don't even need a revelation to do it just do it and people fight conforming they don't want to be similar to now we know the story with the wedding when you're in the Old Testament the wedding and I kind of saw it in Africa but it was kind of blowing my mind um it was in hotel and when I looked down there was a wedding in hotel we were staying in and everybody was wearing the same garment uh maybe different style but the same color material and the first time I'm seeing this and it kind of brings a light what the prophet shared of how it was in those days in those days when you come to the wedding you will give him a garment so you were just walking no when you get at the door at the door you get a garment to put on so everybody looks similar everybody look the same so when the Master of the House came he saw somebody not looking similar or the same he saw somebody with a different he said friend how are you coming here because every time he passed through the door everybody get the Garment at the door they said buying him hand and foot now he called him friends so he know who it was but he said but where is he garment because badnam says that is what the baptism of the Holy Ghost does it make us all the same it make us all similar it make us all like one we dress in the same garment [Applause] so you see when you have the same government nobody can storm the wedding um crash wedding crashes they can't crashing with it so tell Emily I say when I see the food down there I said I know garment s everybody who had the clothes because they were invited they may have been given the claw to what to buy or whatever it is make it however you want to make it but come dress the same way little you so Cain didn't want to comply or conform and there are a lot of people like that they don't like orders they don't like to be pushed around when you understand you want to be pushed around because they want to be right as I said in the Bible study some people like to ask questions because they don't want people to know that they don't know and what they don't know is what gonna get your blues and you don't know what you don't know say I better find out Oh Glory to God let me say it again what you know you know you and this is where you come to the service for to get the mind of God to get the mind of Christ to get things that you don't know Hallelujah that needs to be revealed to you by the spirit oh blessed be the name of the Lord our next scripture contact scripture Romans 8 28 we know it and we know that all things not some work together for good to them that love God the them are who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreign Destiny to be conformed to the image of his son here we get the next the word again whom he did predestined homie for no he also did predestinated to be conformed that means to be influenced to change transform conform line up with what is required of you that is what you are predestinated unto not do your own thing but to be conformed Oh Glory to God hallelujah and we say conform is to comply with rules that you will be the rule breaker of God laws yes they are time to break rules like man rules but they can't break God rules you will pay for that oh glory to God hallelujah God have his rules God have no spoiled children they're all every son that committed God gonna be disciplined every son that committed God [Music] the gods spoil his children he straightened out Noah he straightened on Moses he said now Joshua he will straighten you out what your father into you God's gonna do you what's your mother didn't do you know God's gonna do you your husband don't want to stretch me out God go straight me out oh glory to God is going to straighten you out because every stride and you don't set the exam paper or give the Lord a shout you don't tell God what can I test to give you oh God stop complaining because companion weakens your faith we have a scripture we just gave you and we know that all things will take care of for good God put it up front [Applause] yeah Rapture you'd rather work but nothing you know just believe it past and you're safe but you're heading straight for the tribulation with that foolishness straight to the tribulation not in my landing pad like a direct ticket to the tribulation and we know first thing you see nothing is so he put that up front and we know that all things work together for good to them not love God to make quality purpose and so on like that right all right now watch for whom we did foreign [Music] foreign to the image of his son oh glory Lord God not conform to church not conformed to some Doctrine conformed to the image of his son therefore the image has to be projected that you could see it and as we behold the image we are changed from glory to glory as by the spirit of the Lord okay the Lord I shout in the house [Applause] that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren or this is one of the greatest scriptures we could think about identifying what you're predestinated unto to be conformed and when you get confirmed you become similar to Jesus and you identify Jesus as your big brother the firstborn among many Brethren you are just a little one below him coming up coming up oh give the Lord a shout that's God's purpose that's God's plan go get the Lord when you confront His Image then he become the

Lord and on his law the precepts the instructions the teachings of God he habitually meditates wonders and studied day and night day and night it's in his heart it started getting his thinking and when he started getting your thinking it is getting your mouth because I'm from the abundance of the heart the mouth that speak Hallelujah glory of God is have to come out your mouth thought s action and he shall be like a tree planted and tended by the streams of water ready to bring forth its fruits in its season a leaf also shall not fade over the everything he does shall prosper and come to maturity not show the wicked does disobedient and living with all God are not sure so when you disobeying the wicked here you know the Bible say Rebellion is a listener witchcraft fighting the past

feel like you write me Hallelujah they're not conforming doesn't follow me no oh yes as we say uh uh when God say uh walk around Jericho so much at times it's not a matter of that train only world it's a matter of following in instructions to see follow instruction s Go and show yourself to the priests in lepers he know the original priest he just said go watch yourself to the priest all were healed in obedience so what God tests enforcement is no you'd rather you come to church but but you come the church to hear the word the word is bring instructions that you may act on it [Music] no you could hear it and say you know what he A good sermon but in what you're hearing have things for you to act on if you don't act on act or in stage and therefore you ain't changing at all like a woman at times you say she said my husband dead he never changed me she proud of that never change me then I'm going to change me yeah but life have a way of doing some stuff oh man if you are part of this bright body God going to arrange certain things that coming your way that you will not be able to stop that will change you we cannot continue the way we are going you have to have a design you have to be changed to be transformed I am challenging you not to remain as you are tell yourself this morning God give me a fresh infusion of thoughts reveal your purpose to my life that I can get into action [Applause] [Music] because what you're getting here by the word is God's will God will is his word do you believe that Hallelujah you're going to skip all the rest amen second Timothy 3 almost like a Bible study second Timothy 3 16-17 and this is where I get a title from all scripture all shout out all all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly finished unto all good works in the Amplified every scripture is God breathe given by inspiration and profitable for instruction for reproof and conviction of sin for correction of error and discipline in obedience and there we go for training in righteousness training and what in righteousness in holy living in Conformity to God's will in thought purpose and action so that the man of God may be complete and proficient well-fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work so this scripture or the scriptures is for training in righteousness in holy living in Conformity that God's will in thought purpose and action remember something I keep saying over and over when Israel came out they didn't know who God is Moses was smart enough to say them people is trouble telling me who shall I see send me because they go ask Israel is a stiff neck they're not easy you know God tell them tell them I am anybody asked them I am that I am so Moses was to bring them to the mountain for them to get instructions for the get caught laws for they get all God things and Fields remember is what we're talking about even if you go on a job you have to find out you can't just go and jump okay uh I'm gonna move that I go and do that I'm feeling LED I'm feeling LED you feel like sit down and shut up you're happy let nothing you have to find out what the boss want you have to find out what the company wants and you have to confirm your action and operation for what's the company vision is you can come and bring your own Vision I have a bigger Vision than he bought my company get out of here they will put you out yeah you understand me you got to hold your vision down keep that for yourself because you sign up for our next company we sign up to watch company and he has a vision that he wants his church and his people he wants another book of Acts he wants a super Church a super race he won the same life same action he won the Holy Ghost come down and have the preeminances that's what is his eyes he went along and look short for that for for hundreds of years we are two changes so so people are accustomed being in church building and pews and steeple and all that they like church and a priest long gone Crossing front his chests on different things that is where their customers so God come now to to shake that whole thing up by sending a prophet to bring dust here the Lord the same God of the Old Testament Jesus of the new and by bringing the world you got the understanding of who God really is how he keeps his word so this someone read here blessed is the man that man is not one man you know where the amends that blessed is the man that worketh not in the Council of the ungodly no stand in the way of saying look at your life if you're not that way yet walk in it now this is a chapter for you this morning then you will see it will prosperous whatever you do shall prosper all of a sudden your hands get anointed all your choices get anointed your decisions get anointed Oh Glory to control the plant here not drop your plant here when you're planting something you dig it down deep you drop it down you put some soil you stabilize it you put money on it you'll fix it right you settle a tongue and your brother will have water around it you don't have to wait for rain to fall because you're by the river or give the Lord a shout come on get the Lord and show God pointing you by the river you'll have to wait for rain to fall God set you up just right oh give the Lord a shout that's the Bride of Jesus Christ she'll get set up just right in the presence of my enemies my cup run it over [Applause] foreign represents the entire Christian Nation did you know that you in your behavior in the way you act what you do you represent the entire body of Christ it's a big one so when you leave here tonight this morning today living here as a representative foreign no sorry of the body of Christ let's continue you said but I'm just a remember that doesn't matter that doesn't matter only remember that doesn't matter I just read that for you here when you take on the name of Christian you represent Christ and his church and you should live like that [Music] that's a different thinking now so you never taught that before you thought he was you and you're doing your own thing all the little tricks and everything else but know that you're hearing what you represent are you going to continue how you have been going or you want to adjust and conform and fit in and line up with Hallelujah are you going to line up with the thoughts of God here because this has to come into your heart you know Caleb and them say I bought what as it was in my heart you know if this is not in your heart you can't speak it you can act on it it has to be in your heart when it's in your heart to come out your emotional it has to be in your heart first when you want to do right and do good it has to be in your heart first Jesus said it's not what goes into a man that defiles him so the injection can be failure is what comes out of the man [Applause] [Applause] that's why I'm so happy that's why I could be so excited God chose me I am what I am by the grace of almighty God oh glory to God that's what we are oh not because we told we sure be fat weekend but the grace of God gave us this provision [Applause] God my God my God hallelujah hallelujah it will be such a blessed time when disaster strikes and all kind of things all around you and you praise the name blessing god with joy hey that way you're Blue Mountain you know you're defying your own system of re of your human Spirit you rejoicing them and more you're praising God every man ever more you're blessing God ever more Oh Glory to banking bless God anymore glory to God hallelujah you should live like that you should live like gentlemen like ladies don't never do things of the world because the whole Eyes Of Heaven and Earth is cast on you to represent that one thing no matter how weak you are how little you are hold your head right cause you are Christian now brother Brown God doesn't deal with the church as an organization he doesn't deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the church as individuals individual in the church and when a man proves it's no secret we all see it see it when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself dear in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up there in the presence of God gives him fills him and sets him out that's the age we live in what kind of man is that a sounds one man Oh Glory to God that's the Psalms one's man a man walking in God a man marries in the world day and night a man that God has planted by the rivers of water because he choose to catch God's purpose God's mind God's thoughts God's will he choose that and God will take him aside and bless that man to let the world know let your neighbor know let your family know let your enemy know that his hand is upon you forget them please God [Applause] don't try to please your family please God [Music] I hear you Give the Lord a shout on that go please abandon you they go do whatever they want but please God first [Applause] can we go a little deeper now we're coming to you now I like but as I was he coming to your home when I come into home I'm coming to you Jesus said who taken toward Canada would give it to his statue you can't make her here black or white you are what you are by the grace of God God had did this not what you've done and when you try to make yourself something different I like to make myself a Billy Graham but it won't do me no good I like to make myself a better Mitchell stand up and preach like that earn back so I didn't do no good I must be William Branham I often thought about brother robots and those who pray for the sick and the way they did and how those Brethren go out and pray for great hosts and they never know no Kickbacks if they didn't pray for this or that I can't be an all robots God made me or or God made all of us what he is I have to be William Branham and always candy William Branham so we are what we are by the grace of God is all set together in the church for the Perfection of the church they're working together of the good for those who love God so I am who I am by God's grace God made me thus God Made You with us God don't want you to be like this one and that one God wants you to be you but he wants you to be conformed to the image all of us going to be confirmed to the image it had 10 images as one image Faith virtue knowledge Temperance is that's the answer to every situation patience godliness Godly kindness the answer to everything Oh Glory to go to the ungodly it's have godliness to the impatient is our patience to the unbelief without faith to those who are weakers are virtue or get the Lord I shout and those on odds and grudges is our brotherly kindness oh get the Lord I shout how much time must I forget my brother Seventy Times Seven a day all right no watch here we go you know a lie detector right but you're in a machine and ask system questions and if you like the machine has started to do something so like like when you're talking normal first they ask a question there's actually a question that is you know it's true your name is so and so that's right machine going straight going straight through did you steal they take on the job no I did not because the machine not recording your words you know your pressure your pulse your heart because man wasn't made to lie God set it up that way God God said to the way so you say I did not you could say it's soft emotions foreign [Music] now listen to this this is powerful the lie detector will not work on your mind it work on your soul [Music] so what he's saying it is working at the subconscious level [Music] not your conscious because some people when the line with auto light detector that the light to cover of the first line and the light of the second light that's even more relaxed there's plenty working it better it's one truth coming out but when you're lying and you'll come up lie lie after what you had a measure done that's how police that's fine emotion when they do stuff they still tell your story they take notes and three months after they come let me hear this story again and they hear different thing come out because you see your yeah the current memory is it so far out all right let's continue they can impersonate yet it being a lie and can impression it until they can receive like anything now Satan is the best that there is there for he deceive Eve okay now this person what if you could get this Soul on the inside so in harmony with God that your soul and God could be one together then you could ask what you will and it shall be given to you oh he's going deeper many people come to me many times in the prayer line and stand here and say oh brother Branham I have plenty feet I've got faith like to move mountains and yet they haven't any feet they hardly have enough Faith to get to the platform but they are conscious of wanting they do believe they are believing intellectually with their mind now take take this not as I am preaching something but take this as brother Branham here explaining what has happened with people and you could see what will happen be happening with you and with us all right he said now watch they are conscious of one thing they do believe they are believing intellectually with their mind and their mind will never bring them to God your mind is reasoning and God has no reason so that's why you hear people give a testimony they went to our service and they don't know how they wish they alter there wasn't a bakade Pew and when the preachers had to preach something moved them and they finally altered tears in the eye and they want to save the Lord or whatnot that is not mine you know that is the spirit of God do something to the heart and pull them to the that's not mine his head that is the one that do last you see because that ain't not a hard conviction okay so you're watching the operation of the spirit now let's continue now if you can reason out your mind will tell you no look here doctors say I can't get it over it's impossible the doctor with his intellects with his intelligence with his knowledge of Medical Science he has told you the best of the travel of his mind and you take in your mind and using the same thing the doctors told you God can never touch that line as long as you reason let's put down reason God never made us to live by our intellect we live by the Holy Spirit that's in our soul and that says no to any reason that is contrary to God's word then what when God would say this so there is nothing in the world standing its way and when you do that you are getting down on the right side of God you are getting down till you can ask what you want to it will be given to you because there's nothing between there there's no reason they stand in your way get your mind out of the way you don't have to say what your reason what you see what you think say what God say to be truth that can only come from inside from the heart not from your intellects then he went on to this year there is where so many people today is going to be terribly disappointed at the day of judgment to know that they lived in church to know that they have gone done good deeds to know they have treated their neighbor right to know that they have lowered the people loyal to the church and in their mind have believed that Jesus Christ the son of God and be condemned at the day of judgment Jesus said many are called and few are chosen straight is the gate now is the way that leads to life but few there be that find it no as I was saying a few days ago I want you to pay close attention put a lie detector on you and you could try to impersonate the truth try to say it's the truth but darling inside of you in the subconscious leaves a place called The Soul and this intellectual mind here we go does not govern the vibration of the system the mind is only a director it will direct you but it is very incapable of bring you to God your mind you cannot know God by your mind intellectual is one of the resources or the channels that you could lead to it here we go but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by your soul that's a defining statement not by your house and land it have crooked people of house Lanka airplane boats and everything else and they crooked as their teeth Liars one of the children and all kind of stuff like that but you are what you are by your Soul or give the Lord some praises so [Music] conscious and conscious lining up together to get your soul lined up with the word to get your heart and mind line up with your word isn't that right as a man thinks in his heart so is he now when you come and I think we said it a couple of years ago we are preaching about when somebody born to the British royal family uh a little child born Prince Harry Prince this Prince that Prince is this or whatever it is then they're born into royalty they don't know as babies they are royal if you put them on the train appearance they'll be trinidadians they will go to school they will run around they would they will do just what train Adams do but because they lack environment they are being taught they are being trained they are being told they have shown history they assure the history of the lineage of woman's Queen and who was the queen queen and who was the master and all of that and that gave him a Consciousness when they begin to walk the streets cameras picking on them

they can't have that they have the right tutor and God have a distributor also they treat us the Holy Ghost God said in truth attitude to you because you are loyalty you're coming unto something you're predestinated under something you have to be conformed to something so go to the first day with your thought oh give the Lord a praise her for him so first your Consciousness you are a sinner you know nothing about God so then God have introduced you his thoughts he said my to us are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways as hard the heavens above the Earth so are my thoughts above
