[13:29] Lord, we thank you for your servant
[13:31] speaking your word to remember, Father.
[13:33] And Lord, there was a certain scripture
[13:35] that was read where you spoke and say
[13:37] when you are multiplied, when you get
[13:39] your house, when this work out and you
[13:41] get your goal and whatn not, don't get
[13:44] puffed up and lifted up that you would
