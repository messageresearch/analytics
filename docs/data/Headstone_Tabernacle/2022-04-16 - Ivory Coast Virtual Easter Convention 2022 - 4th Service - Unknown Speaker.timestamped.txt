[37:33] greetings in the name of our lord jesus
[37:36] christ
[37:38] to where paul and the saints
[37:40] from pastor albert greene of bethlehem
[37:43] tabernacle trinidad and tobago
[37:46] i do give thanks to our lord for this
[37:49] opportunity through precious brotherhood
[37:52] to bring greetings to your virtual
[37:55] easter convention
[37:58] the team
[37:59] the life of christ in you
[38:02] is the vindication
[38:04] of the rapture
[38:07] precious brother paul plays for us
[38:10] in the invitation
[38:12] numerous scriptures and quotations
[38:16] from god's prophet giving a great
[38:19] insight
[38:20] to the team
[38:22] the life of christ
[38:25] the vindication
[38:27] of the rapture
[38:29] vindication speaks of proof
[38:34] that someone
[38:35] or something
[38:37] is right
[38:39] in the message
[38:41] you must be born again
[38:44] god's prophet tells us
[38:46] when you are born again
[38:50] god
[38:51] vindicates you
[38:54] that's how
[38:56] god vindicates all his media
[39:00] what
[39:01] by the fruits
[39:03] and that's the way he vindicates his
[39:07] ministry
[39:08] that's right
[39:10] all of his servants are vindicated the
[39:13] same way
[39:15] he
[39:16] vindicates nature
[39:18] how do you know
[39:20] it is a peach tree
[39:23] cause it brings peaches
[39:26] how do you know
[39:27] it is an apple tree
[39:30] bearing apples
[39:32] how do you know it is a christian
[39:35] a christian signs beer from it
[39:40] christian life comes out of it
[39:44] so church
[39:46] to vindicate
[39:48] it means to make plane
[39:51] to make manifest
[39:54] to verify
[39:56] our lord said
[39:58] i am the vine
[40:01] he
[40:02] are the branches
[40:04] so the vine
[40:06] can only produce
[40:09] what the life of the vine is
[40:13] the question
[40:16] how is a christian
[40:18] vindicated
[40:21] how is a christian known
[40:25] if christ lived in you
[40:28] the life of christ
[40:31] would be lived through you
[40:34] amen
[40:35] so if our lives
[40:38] are not vindicating
[40:42] what we are professing
[40:45] we have not got it
[40:48] think about that
[40:49] if our lives because if christ lived in
[40:53] you
[40:55] the life of christ
[40:57] will be lived through you
[41:01] if our lives
[41:04] whatever is your hour in your country
[41:07] it is night here with us but if our
[41:09] lives are not vindicating
[41:12] what we are professing
[41:15] then we can know without a shadow of a
[41:18] doubt
[41:19] we have not got it
[41:22] because
[41:24] the vine
[41:25] will only produce
[41:29] the life of the vine
[41:32] church the fruits of the tree
[41:36] vindicates the tree
[41:39] how do we know
[41:42] a christian
[41:43] a christian is vindicated
[41:47] by the life
[41:49] lived
[41:51] in the message is your life worthy of
[41:54] the gospel
[41:56] one of the quotations
[41:58] or precious brother paul used for these
[42:01] meetings
[42:02] a christian is not a tool
[42:06] or some kind of mechanical wrench
[42:10] to a great religious regime
[42:14] that's right a christian
[42:17] is not some kind of tool
[42:20] that keeps a religious
[42:22] organization moving
[42:25] a christian
[42:27] that is not a christian
[42:32] a christian
[42:33] is to be christ-like
[42:37] and a christian cannot be christ-like
[42:41] until christ comes into the man
[42:44] hallelujah
[42:45] a christian is to be christ-like
[42:48] so this christ-likeness
[42:51] of the christian
[42:53] it cannot come to pass
[42:56] until but christ
[42:58] comes into the man
[43:01] then
[43:02] it produces
[43:05] even the life that christ lived
[43:08] we are speaking about a vindication
[43:11] the life the theme of the meetings amen
[43:15] the life of jesus christ
[43:18] vindication of the rapture amen a
[43:21] christian cannot be a christian until
[43:23] christ comes to the man
[43:25] the life of christ in him
[43:27] then it produces
[43:30] the christ the life that christ lives
[43:35] hallelujah
[43:37] amen and you do the things
[43:41] that christ did
[43:44] oh glory and praise and honor be to
[43:47] almighty god
[43:49] amen
[43:51] so we
[43:53] message believers
[43:55] we are prone
[43:57] to speak in the light
[44:00] of the fact
[44:01] that the word
[44:04] has been
[44:05] revealed
[44:07] to us
[44:09] we all speak in glowing terms
[44:13] in glowing terms that the word the
[44:17] message
[44:18] we are under that inspiration
[44:21] of the word
[44:23] being revealed to us
[44:28] but you know in the message
[44:30] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[44:35] god's prophet asked this question
[44:38] how you know
[44:40] it's revealed
[44:42] amen
[44:43] so come on church this is not an hour of
[44:47] intellectual conception
[44:50] no no is not the time for intellectual
[44:54] ideas and in this intellectual age and
[44:57] all of us can talk about amen that we
[45:01] are inspired and the word is revealed to
[45:04] us but here we are told how to know
[45:08] it's revealed
[45:09] and how to know it's revealed
[45:12] is that it lives itself
[45:16] and expresses
[45:18] itself
[45:19] through you
[45:21] and god's prophet cried out oh
[45:24] so the word
[45:26] leaves itself
[45:28] the word
[45:30] expresses itself
[45:32] through you
[45:34] it's like faith without works is dead
[45:37] amen if we say it is revealed to us we
[45:41] got to know it is revealed
[45:43] and we are blessed through god's prophet
[45:46] to not only tells us or amen god used
[45:49] him to bring the word to us it shows us
[45:52] whether we are just having knowledge or
[45:54] if we get a revelation
[45:56] if it is revealed to us
[45:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[46:01] amen in the hebrews chapter 5
[46:04] and 6 series
[46:06] god's prophet will tell us yay
[46:09] we all go to church
[46:12] amen we all we all go to church
[46:16] but there is some
[46:18] that has got life
[46:21] come on church
[46:23] we all
[46:24] go to church
[46:27] amen but everybody don't have life
[46:32] amen the ones that got the revelation of
[46:36] jesus christ in your heart
[46:39] those are the ones that got life amen so
[46:43] it's not by shaking
[46:45] not by jumping
[46:47] not by joining church
[46:50] but revelation
[46:52] god has revealed it to them and the
[46:56] doors who it has been revealed to
[47:00] to such a people by the grace of god
[47:04] such a people are the ones that has
[47:08] life oh blessed be the name of the lord
[47:13] so it is it is to us to know
[47:16] how it is we could identify
[47:20] it is revealed
[47:22] the call precious brethren
[47:26] is for the life
[47:29] amen
[47:30] the great message is that christ
[47:34] living his life
[47:36] in me
[47:38] just
[47:40] just i see
[47:42] like he lived it here on the earth
[47:46] our lord
[47:48] not i live in the life
[47:49] it's our lord living his own life
[47:53] in you and i
[47:55] that we
[47:57] just being vessels
[48:00] the life
[48:01] that
[48:02] he would live
[48:04] we are living it here by the grace of
[48:07] almighty god
[48:08] so in closing
[48:10] at my 10 minutes is about up
[48:14] and we pray god's richest blessings
[48:18] on his servants
[48:19] as they continue to expound

[54:17] the revelation
[54:19] by

[54:23] amen
[54:25] praise god so reading from ezekiel
[54:27] chapter 37 the hand of the lord was upon
[54:29] me and carried me out in the spirit of
[54:31] the lord and set me down
[54:34] in the midst of the valley which was
[54:35] full of bones
[54:36] and caused me to pass by them round
[54:38] about and behold there were very
[54:41] many
[54:42] and in the open valley and lord they
[54:44] were very dry
[54:46] and he said unto me son of man can these
[54:48] bones live
[54:49] and i answered oh lord don't know us and
[54:51] again he said unto me prophesy
[54:53] upon these bones and certainly dry bones
[54:56] hear the word of the lord thus saith the
[54:58] lord god unto these bones behold i will
[55:00] cause bread to enter into you and he
[55:02] shall live
[55:04] i would lay sinews upon you and will
[55:06] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[55:07] with skin and put bread in you
[55:10] and he shall live and ye shall know that
[55:12] i am the lord
[55:13] so i prophesied as i was commanded and
[55:16] as i prophesied
[55:17] there was a noise
[55:19] and behold a shaken
[55:21] and the bones come together
[55:23] bone to his bone and when i beheld the
[55:26] sinews and the flesh came upon them and
[55:28] the skin covered them above and there
[55:30] was no breath in them then he said unto
[55:32] me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son
[55:34] of man say to the wind thus here the
[55:37] lord god come from the four winds of
[55:39] bread and breathe upon thee slain that
[55:42] they may live
[55:43] so i prophesied as he commanded me and
[55:45] the bread came into them and they lived
[55:48] and stood upon their feet an exceeding
[55:51] great army
[55:52] i read from john
[55:54] chapter one
[55:56] and the beginning was the word
[55:57] the word was with god and the word was
[56:00] god the same was in the beginning with
[56:02] god all things were made by him and
[56:04] without him was not anything mean that
[56:06] was made in him was life and the life
[56:09] was the light of men
[56:13] in him was life and life the light of
[56:14] men and the light shines in the darkness
[56:16] and the darkness comprehended it not we
[56:19] go down to verse 10 he was in the world
[56:21] and the world was made by him and the
[56:23] world knew him not he came unto his own
[56:25] his own receive him not but as many as
[56:28] receive him to them give me power to
[56:30] become the sons of god even to them we
[56:33] have believed on his name which were
[56:35] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[56:37] flesh nor of the will of man
[56:39] but of god and the word was made flesh

[1:14:17] what about this bride
[1:14:19] we will need supernatural strength

[1:14:30] you need supernatural strength
[1:14:32] supernatural power and no man have that
[1:14:36] that comes from god
[1:14:38] all glory to god when they were in the
[1:14:40] upper room suddenly praised god they
[1:14:42] were in one mind one accord and suddenly
[1:14:45] there was a wind a russian mighty wind
[1:14:48] that come down from heaven no five full
[1:14:50] minutes that was bringing that no pastor
[1:14:53] man and bishop man and an evangelist man
[1:14:55] no man was bringing that that was the
[1:14:57] lord himself descended upon them and
[1:15:00] they were staggering like drunk men oh
[1:15:03] glory to god they couldn't keep up
[1:15:04] straight mary was walking praise god
[1:15:07] like how drunk people let's walk oh
[1:15:09] glory to god it was staggering
[1:15:11] hallelujah they were so staggering that
[1:15:13] the people on the outside said these men
[1:15:15] are drunk look at the time of the early
[1:15:18] day you don't drink so early and peter
[1:15:20] staggered and said these men are not
[1:15:23] drunk as we suppose but this is that
[1:15:26] that the prophet william branham speak
[1:15:28] of oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:15:31] that is what we're going to say
[1:15:33] oh give the lord a shout the bad corner
[1:15:36] of a revival a holy ghost revival a
[1:15:39] seven thunder revival
[1:15:41] oh my
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:45] that is what
[1:15:47] she's waiting for
[1:15:49] now here the bomb
[1:15:51] no
[1:15:52] other life
[1:15:54] will work in her
[1:16:00] you know
[1:16:01] this is their self-help
[1:16:04] books on self self have to do this to do
[1:16:06] that
[1:16:07] you can't self-help the status lighting
[1:16:09] because this bride have a
[1:16:11] what's it here
[1:16:12] a big
[1:16:14] a
[1:16:15] seven-cylinder
[1:16:16] i know we do have that seven-cylinder
[1:16:18] engine
[1:16:19] i never took wool that you joined his
[1:16:21] pocket to get it started
[1:16:23] sparking like a spark
[1:16:26] that can't start
[1:16:28] that engine
[1:16:30] it will take
[1:16:32] charity
[1:16:36] it will take
[1:16:38] l-o-v-e
[1:16:42] you have a lot of pressing to do
[1:16:44] because it will take the
[1:16:46] life no other life
[1:16:49] will work in her
[1:16:50] yet a bomb she can't
[1:16:53] come to life
[1:16:54] any other way
[1:16:57] yet she feeds it out there
[1:16:59] so that's why brother branham says a
[1:17:01] minister cannot bring a revival
[1:17:03] so why all these ministers parading the
[1:17:05] beef as if they could do so much with
[1:17:07] the people
[1:17:08] as if they love the people more than
[1:17:09] jesus
[1:17:11] is that the minister's wife
[1:17:13] is the lamb's wife
[1:17:18] he love us enough to send us the books
[1:17:20] send us a message to send us the word to
[1:17:22] send us the anointing that's god's love
[1:17:24] to us he loves enough this in our fight
[1:17:26] for ministry to echo what was in the
[1:17:28] books because the spirit the prophets
[1:17:30] and the bride will be saying the same
[1:17:31] thing
[1:17:32] what we preach here you supposed to go
[1:17:33] back and read back in your books when
[1:17:35] you press play at home you can
[1:17:37] supposedly hear about what we say in
[1:17:38] here that i am we are preaching this and
[1:17:41] preaching that we preaching the word
[1:17:43] glory to god that's what you want to get
[1:17:45] the word
[1:17:46] isn't that right
[1:17:48] no other life can work in her
[1:17:50] she can't come to life any other way yet
[1:17:52] she feeds it out there
[1:17:54] she knows it's going to happen and then
[1:17:56] it happens
[1:17:57] she wakes up
[1:17:59] oh hallelujah she know it going to
[1:18:01] happen a sense of faith in your soul
[1:18:04] know it's going to happen
[1:18:06] oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god
[1:18:10] let's continue praise god
[1:18:13] he says now watch he said now it is we
[1:18:16] don't believe in same hell
[1:18:17] praise god he says now oh mercy we need
[1:18:21] men of god men who won't hold back not
[1:18:23] everybody can't be a preacher
[1:18:24] but you've got a voice and if you can't
[1:18:26] preach the people of simon if you're a
[1:18:28] preacher you're called to the pulpit to
[1:18:30] preach if you're not you're still a
[1:18:32] preacher but live the people of sermon
[1:18:35] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[1:18:37] voice of god
[1:18:38] that will bring reproach to them who
[1:18:40] reject it
[1:18:42] oh you mean the word is the voice and
[1:18:44] the life is a voice
[1:18:48] you mean if you don't know what that
[1:18:49] seed is
[1:18:51] the contents of that seed all you have
[1:18:52] to do is to plant it
[1:18:54] and let the life unfold
[1:18:56] and the fruit will speak a voice
[1:18:58] of what that
[1:19:00] seed is
[1:19:01] so if it's a pumpkin seed you don't know
[1:19:03] if it's a watermelon or pumpkin seed
[1:19:04] you plant it because both run and vine
[1:19:07] both similar but when the light began to
[1:19:09] unfold
[1:19:10] flower fruit then you said this is a
[1:19:13] watermelon or this is a pumpkin now the
[1:19:15] only thing to identify it is the
[1:19:17] unfolding of the life
[1:19:19] so the seed is very important but then
[1:19:21] the life on the seed
[1:19:23] has to unfold
[1:19:25] well god put a bright seed
[1:19:27] and that bright seed is the bible
[1:19:29] that by seed is the pyramid
[1:19:31] add to your faith virtue and knowledge
[1:19:32] and temperance and patience and
[1:19:34] godliness and brotherly kindness
[1:19:35] and that life will unfold
[1:19:37] and identify the bride of jesus christ
[1:19:39] and second timothy 1 4 7 30 and minded
[1:19:42] will identify the church seed
[1:19:44] oh glory to god but we talk about bright
[1:19:45] sea this morning glory to god hallelujah
[1:19:49] don't try to preach it if you're not
[1:19:50] called to be a preacher you get mixed up
[1:19:52] and messed up get people tangled up
[1:19:54] praise god the preachers call the
[1:19:55] preachers and deliver true if they can't
[1:19:58] live it then stop preaching it
[1:19:59] but you're supposed to live your simmers

[1:20:27] without a blemish real questions
[1:20:30] that's the thunder against the enemy
[1:20:33] then he drills down deeper the devil
[1:20:35] don't care how loud you holla the devil
[1:20:37] don't care how much you jump how much
[1:20:39] you can do this or shout but what hurts
[1:20:42] the devil
[1:20:43] is to see that sanctified holy life
[1:20:47] consecrated to god say anything to him
[1:20:50] call him anything just as sweet as it
[1:20:51] can be move right on that throws him
[1:20:54] away
[1:20:55] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:20:58] you say well if he could preach like
[1:21:00] billy graham or about some great
[1:21:02] influential speaker no
[1:21:04] sometimes the devil just laughs at that

[1:21:08] no more attention that that nothing
[1:21:10] you get all the theology you want
[1:21:12] all the seminary training and the devil

[1:21:17] sees that life
[1:21:19] oh give the lord some praises
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:23] then he went on to talk about his
[1:21:24] disciples
[1:21:25] he said look at the disciples with a
[1:21:27] maniac child
[1:21:28] with epilepsy a disciple saying come out
[1:21:30] of him devil come on from the devil come
[1:21:32] on devil and the devil sitting there

[1:21:48] one come walking quietly he didn't have
[1:21:51] to say nothing no words
[1:21:53] that devil was scared right then he know
[1:21:56] he had to leave
[1:21:57] without jesus saying a word
[1:21:59] so as jesus coming down the devil sat in
[1:22:01] the back up shop already getting all
[1:22:02] these things together
[1:22:04] he said he's living there long enough
[1:22:06] he's got to move up with his wares and

[1:22:10] built up there like he resident there
[1:22:12] he's at the pack up shop because our
[1:22:14] life's coming no
[1:22:15] he getting ready to hear the word to
[1:22:16] leave he only reached into the voice he
[1:22:19] said get out
[1:22:20] oh give the lord some praises
[1:22:22] hallelujah praise god he know he had to
[1:22:25] leave cause here come a life
[1:22:28] not only a sermon

[1:22:31] come out of him that done it quietly he
[1:22:34] knowed what he was talking about he
[1:22:36] knowed what he was doing isn't that
[1:22:38] something
[1:22:39] this life of jesus christ hallelujah
[1:22:42] praise god and the prophets are speaking
[1:22:45] about the spiritual mind down in egypt
[1:22:47] and see what the persecution rise see
[1:22:49] joseph take no way in order that
[1:22:50] persecution could rise and see god with
[1:22:53] his wheel
[1:22:54] moving around perfectly potiphar reject
[1:22:56] joseph the lie toll see joseph in prison
[1:22:59] his beard grown out excommunicated from
[1:23:01] his brethren and then all of a sudden
[1:23:03] god move in
[1:23:04] so it looked like god abandoned joseph
[1:23:07] but a prophecy hanging over him
[1:23:10] so when the brothers taught that jamming
[1:23:11] joseph and killing joseph and getting
[1:23:13] rid of joseph they're actually flinging
[1:23:15] him into his prophecy
[1:23:18] all the holla and crying loud grinders
[1:23:21] what about my brethren my brethren look
[1:23:22] good
[1:23:23] all of that
[1:23:25] joseph didn't understand goddess see
[1:23:28] god has played what i call the long
[1:23:32] game when you're looking at this week
[1:23:35] and this month god see him 10 years from
[1:23:36] now
[1:23:37] 15 years from now so god knew you were
[1:23:40] going to be here

[1:23:44] on the earth in 2022.
[1:23:46] god knew you'd come to coronavirus come
[1:23:48] through all kind of atmospheres and so
[1:23:50] on and still have a love for him to save
[1:23:52] him
[1:23:53] god knows all about it god know that
[1:23:55] there will be no giving up in you
[1:23:57] so when you were back said no when you
[1:23:58] was in the world god was conquering you
[1:24:00] you could have boasted you see that
[1:24:01] child of mine
[1:24:02] that child coming through
[1:24:04] because child that child is a seed
[1:24:06] and every seed that i bring forth after
[1:24:08] is kind
[1:24:09] that is my seed and my son that is my
[1:24:12] seed and my daughter
[1:24:13] glory to god though devil to twist what
[1:24:16] is original
[1:24:17] hallelujah
[1:24:19] never gotta change the original seed
[1:24:21] hallelujah
[1:24:23] all of a sudden god move in now we can
[1:24:25] see the wheels moving god's great plan
[1:24:27] moving everything up to this exodus
[1:24:29] watch
[1:24:30] to this time
[1:24:31] when he would call his people back in
[1:24:33] the line again
[1:24:34] back in the place in position where he
[1:24:37] could bless them one
[1:24:39] two place among them the one he promised
[1:24:42] he would place among them
[1:24:43] they had to be in their land
[1:24:46] and remember they had to come out of the
[1:24:48] land that they were in
[1:24:50] and get into the terminology the land of
[1:24:53] promise
[1:24:54] before the promised messiah would ever
[1:24:57] come and the church has to do the same
[1:24:59] thing
[1:25:00] get out of that group of rejecters over
[1:25:03] into the promise before messiah can ever
[1:25:05] be manifested before them so you mean
[1:25:07] they have rejections in the message of
[1:25:09] course they have unbelievers in this
[1:25:11] message it have maybe given this message
[1:25:13] and it's absolutely business message
[1:25:15] in the message
[1:25:16] believe in gods and a prophet
[1:25:19] all are not believers
[1:25:22] make and
[1:25:24] true
[1:25:27] church has to do the same thing here it
[1:25:29] is and the church has to do the same
[1:25:31] thing get out of that group of rejecters
[1:25:33] over into the promise before messiah can
[1:25:35] never be manifested before them
[1:25:38] hear the bomb now the life of the
[1:25:40] messiah
[1:25:42] manifested
[1:25:44] making a church ready a bride
[1:25:47] oh my give the lord some praises on that
[1:25:48] one
[1:25:50] [Applause]
[1:25:52] i want to put up all inspiration the
[1:25:54] revelation by the lies
[1:25:56] you mean
[1:25:57] that this life
[1:25:59] of virtues have to be manifested
[1:26:03] not taught
[1:26:06] manifested
[1:26:07] to make a bride ready
[1:26:09] you see a woman marrying a man and
[1:26:10] disagreeing with him it would be fussed
[1:26:13] continually but when a man and his wife
[1:26:15] his girlfriend is exposed when they're
[1:26:17] in perfect harmony like one soul one
[1:26:19] mind because they're going to be one
[1:26:21] flesh
[1:26:22] then when the church can get in such
[1:26:24] harmony with god here we go
[1:26:27] until
[1:26:28] the manifestation of the bridegroom
[1:26:31] is manifested in the bride
[1:26:34] because they're going to be one
[1:26:36] so all the seals word message teachings
[1:26:40] revelation inspiration seeds
[1:26:42] is to bring
[1:26:43] a manifestation
[1:26:45] of the bridegroom
[1:26:47] in the bride
[1:26:48] vindicating that they are one
[1:26:50] that's the only way you could know
[1:26:53] hallelujah it has to be the same works
[1:26:55] same life hallelujah
[1:26:58] are you sure of that yes i am listen to
[1:27:00] what he said here we lift you luta's age
[1:27:02] wesley age all along to the ages
[1:27:04] pentecostal age and each age is given a
[1:27:07] promise of the word
[1:27:09] and the people of that age that manifest
[1:27:12] that promised word
[1:27:13] is the seed of that age
[1:27:16] not people that believe people that
[1:27:18] manifest
[1:27:19] the promise just as the promise of
[1:27:21] brotherly kindness is for this age that
[1:27:23] the brain has the blood upon a chest of
[1:27:25] brotherly love
[1:27:26] that has to be manifested that can't be
[1:27:28] explained away on top
[1:27:30] of very love no no it has to be
[1:27:31] manifested look how to be displayed
[1:27:34] somebody must cross your wrong somebody
[1:27:36] must lie on you somebody must bring
[1:27:39] offense to you and you have to say i
[1:27:41] forgive you
[1:27:43] oh glory to god you have to drop it wait
[1:27:46] when you stand praying for l-o-v-e you
[1:27:48] have to drop it you have to let it go
[1:27:50] somebody did you evil you have to give
[1:27:52] it away
[1:27:53] glory to god because you're going to a
[1:27:55] higher place you're looking for a
[1:27:57] supernatural strength to change your
[1:27:59] body if you have one horse you're not
[1:28:01] leaving here if you have one ought to go
[1:28:03] into the tribulation if you have one
[1:28:05] ought you're not going to make it you've
[1:28:07] got to be light
[1:28:08] you're going to be disconnected from
[1:28:10] odds and grudge and hurts and pains and
[1:28:13] what people do you and what they didn't
[1:28:15] do you know what they should have done
[1:28:16] you have to forget about it let it go
[1:28:19] glory to god you have to let your own
[1:28:21] sins go glory to god you have to forgive
[1:28:23] yourself too after god forgive you have
[1:28:26] you forgiven yourself or give the lord
[1:28:28] some praises
[1:28:29] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory
[1:28:35] and the people of that age
[1:28:37] that manifest the promised word is the
[1:28:39] seed of that age according to what jesus
[1:28:42] said right here they are the children of
[1:28:45] the kingdom
[1:28:46] he said that's right the manifestation
[1:28:49] of the holy spirit
[1:28:51] operating through his children
[1:28:53] is
[1:28:54] those seeds of the kingdom at that age
[1:28:58] oh my hallelujah
[1:29:00] oh glory to god the manifestation of the
[1:29:03] holy spirit operating in his children oh
[1:29:06] it's the seed of the age so god going to
[1:29:09] be identifying he's into their own seed
[1:29:11] oh glory to god remember you're another
[1:29:13] believer they believe that's the word in
[1:29:14] you come on now come on now don't just
[1:29:16] praise god the believer is the word in
[1:29:18] you you're not the believer god puts
[1:29:20] something in you to believe his own word
[1:29:22] glory to god you can tell satan how do
[1:29:24] you consider my saving job because he
[1:29:25] know what he put in job that can't come
[1:29:27] against god that can't curse god and
[1:29:30] what god put into you that understand
[1:29:32] oh glory to god i don't care what your
[1:29:34] flesh has done it go understand
[1:29:37] you will come forth you will come forth
[1:29:40] you will be delivered you will be free
[1:29:42] oh glory to god god gonna break the
[1:29:44] bands off for you
[1:29:46] break wickedness over you break evil oh
[1:29:48] for you
[1:29:49] glory to god hallelujah
[1:29:52] praise god praise god
[1:29:54] so the original grain
[1:29:56] of the bright church
[1:29:57] fellaini rome isn't that right
[1:30:00] and the life began to come out to luton
[1:30:02] wesley isn't that right
[1:30:04] the life that come out of the original
[1:30:05] seed came through different processes
[1:30:08] and then turned back to its original
[1:30:09] condition so the revelation of the seed
[1:30:12] is the revelation of the seven two
[1:30:13] changes the seven church ages what's
[1:30:16] really the unfolding of god's own seed
[1:30:19] through processes
[1:30:20] the life moving on producing stalk
[1:30:23] producing tassel producing husk then
[1:30:26] coming back to see it again it's the
[1:30:28] life doing that or give the lord a shout
[1:30:31] you are hearing words being preached but
[1:30:33] there's a life behind that it's the life
[1:30:36] of the word
[1:30:37] that is doing that oh give the lord some
[1:30:40] praises
[1:30:41] the life here we go that was in the husk
[1:30:44] in this talk and in the tassel all
[1:30:47] gathered up in the seed
[1:30:49] so all these seven seals all these
[1:30:51] mysteries all they got in the scattered
[1:30:53] word and tying it back in the word
[1:30:56] that's the life
[1:30:57] from all the shock and all that got in
[1:30:59] together to reveal every mystery and put
[1:31:02] it inside of you as a seed
[1:31:05] as a word so when the angel come he said
[1:31:08] the secret is
[1:31:10] the word
[1:31:12] is in the bride
[1:31:14] that's the secret oh my hallelujah
[1:31:17] notice
[1:31:18] the light that was in the stalk
[1:31:21] went to make another justification made
[1:31:24] away for sanctification signification
[1:31:26] made away from the battle of the holy
[1:31:27] ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:31:29] made a way for the holy ghost itself to
[1:31:32] come down in perfection and back to the
[1:31:34] word again oh glory the true word of
[1:31:36] life on it was on its way to the
[1:31:39] original grain through these stages
[1:31:42] through this talk and so on now watch
[1:31:44] hallelujah
[1:31:47] dare produce the early revival a holder
[1:31:50] of a certain portion of the seed life
[1:31:52] but when they organized the life moved
[1:31:54] out
[1:31:55] oh my as soon as they organize it
[1:31:57] they're going dead
[1:31:58] notice the life is traveling or now it
[1:32:02] is moving on that's why people like to
[1:32:03] go back into church history because they
[1:32:05] like dead
[1:32:06] so now they go back the history
[1:32:09] of when god was used to be with them
[1:32:11] what god used to do
[1:32:13] and how god did that 50 years ago 100
[1:32:15] years ago and 30 years ago but they
[1:32:17] can't talk about what we're doing now
[1:32:19] the only talking now
[1:32:23] because your life move on
[1:32:25] you see the churches held a portion of
[1:32:26] life
[1:32:27] but as it pushing on and they die
[1:32:30] and you know why
[1:32:31] their life couldn't come back to revive
[1:32:33] them he says because they nominate and
[1:32:35] god can't go back in nomination
[1:32:37] actually they kick him out
[1:32:39] they boot him out with their creeds
[1:32:41] because god can only sit on the word
[1:32:43] once the word is dear he could sit on it
[1:32:46] hallelujah he could abide on it but once
[1:32:49] the word is removed he gone
[1:32:51] he is with his word
[1:32:53] anytime he have an interpretation on it
[1:32:55] he's gone he's gone glory to god
[1:32:57] hallelujah most people start off right
[1:32:59] and enough wrong it's not who run it's
[1:33:01] who finish the race
[1:33:03] oh glory to god is that him who starts
[1:33:06] you have to finish so the life
[1:33:08] leave the stalk
[1:33:10] oh no
[1:33:12] no i missed something here
[1:33:14] i did miss something here
[1:33:17] he said justification made a way for
[1:33:18] signification signification made away
[1:33:20] for the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:33:22] the baptism of isaiah
[1:33:24] of the holy spirit couldn't mess this up
[1:33:26] and the baptism of the holy ghost made a
[1:33:28] way for the holy ghost itself
[1:33:31] to come down in perfection and back to
[1:33:33] the word so we're not talking about 1906
[1:33:36] we don't want the baptism made away for
[1:33:38] the holy ghost itself so what the
[1:33:40] prophet introduced was the person of the
[1:33:41] holy ghost
[1:33:43] to come back again amongst the bride
[1:33:45] him moving in and out among us
[1:33:48] oh glory to god
[1:33:49] glory to god amen
[1:33:52] do you believe it so the life
[1:33:54] leaves the stalk to make the tassel from
[1:33:57] the tassel that makes the husk from the
[1:33:59] husk it goes into the original grain
[1:34:01] notice never again to be useful of him
[1:34:04] my my don't you see why he never used an
[1:34:07] organization he can't
[1:34:09] get back in it again
[1:34:11] it is dead
[1:34:13] the life passes on from one to the other
[1:34:15] they put crease and inject and whosoever
[1:34:18] shall add one word or take one without
[1:34:20] he is blocked off from it it must be the
[1:34:22] live sea traveling on
[1:34:24] so that's why the seven ages is like a
[1:34:26] history of the seed life
[1:34:28] god's own life
[1:34:30] passing through processes
[1:34:33] coming back at the end time back to
[1:34:35] original
[1:34:36] and that is what brother branham brought
[1:34:38] original seed
[1:34:40] so any man tamper with that is perverted
[1:34:43] it has to be what the tapes say
[1:34:45] that's why he says say what the tapes
[1:34:46] say because these are promises
[1:34:49] that is why you tell john eat the book
[1:34:52] not another book eat this book
[1:34:54] which book the open book
[1:34:56] hallelujah the one that the mighty angel
[1:34:58] brought don't eat that book and from
[1:35:00] that book you prophesy
[1:35:02] though must prophesy again
[1:35:04] and that's what we are doing we are
[1:35:06] prophesying of a revival we are
[1:35:07] prophesying of lattering we are
[1:35:09] prophesying of a resurrection power we
[1:35:11] are prophesying of a prize revival we
[1:35:13] are prophesying of a super church a
[1:35:15] super race adoption of sons we are
[1:35:17] prophesying that your family will be
[1:35:19] delivered we are prophesying that you're
[1:35:20] gonna be healed we are prophesying that
[1:35:22] you're gonna be set free we have to
[1:35:24] prophesy from the book or give the lord
[1:35:26] some praises that your condition now is
[1:35:29] not your condition in the future we are
[1:35:31] prophesying that you're going to get a
[1:35:33] breakthrough i know i could stop it oh
[1:35:36] glory to god hallelujah do you believe
[1:35:39] that
[1:35:40] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:35:44] let's continue the all we are living
[1:35:47] the ecclesiastes
[1:35:48] spirits
[1:35:50] uniting together now
[1:35:52] bringing them to one big slaughter to
[1:35:54] blot out it's already in writing here in
[1:35:57] this nation that these churches has to
[1:35:59] be closed
[1:36:00] unless you are with an organization it's
[1:36:03] a union it's a boycott just like the
[1:36:06] mark of the beast
[1:36:07] now do you see what this beast is don't

[1:37:28] cries to make it manifest to us
[1:37:31] they are supernatural devils unseen to
[1:37:34] the eye but you can see what they are
[1:37:36] doing
[1:37:37] notice that this group is riding
[1:37:40] making themselves ready to stomp out
[1:37:42] everything that won't agree with them
[1:37:43] but there's another group
[1:37:45] being made ready in revelation 19 the
[1:37:48] next time the church is heard she comes
[1:37:50] not upon exactly horses he's on a white
[1:37:52] horse and with the horse and heaven was
[1:37:54] following up on white horses while this
[1:37:56] group down here has got 2000 bong at the
[1:37:59] river euphrates has been bombed for 2000
[1:38:02] years also the church has bound the holy
[1:38:04] ghost the church has spun the holy oak
[1:38:07] for nearly two thousand years on the
[1:38:09] martyrdom back there under the church
[1:38:11] ages it's been born not at the real
[1:38:14] euphrates but at the door of queens and
[1:38:16] dogmas that the holy spirit can't work
[1:38:19] in the church because of man-made
[1:38:21] systems but she is going to be liberated
[1:38:24] that's the prophecy she's going to be
[1:38:25] liberated from man-made systems that the
[1:38:29] holy ghost would start to work in the
[1:38:31] church she's going to be liberated
[1:38:34] oh that's a prophecy the bride will be
[1:38:36] liberated god will bust them out from
[1:38:38] here possible from there they're going
[1:38:40] to be liberated
[1:38:42] hallelujah she is coming back
[1:38:45] that's what the bible said those two
[1:38:47] meet one another in the battleground
[1:38:49] lucifer and michael again like the
[1:38:50] beginning they have been bound for 2000
[1:38:52] years almost 2000 years they heard the
[1:38:54] bomb now the holy spirit has been bombed
[1:38:57] by these international rivers for almost
[1:38:58] two thousand years but it's to be loosed
[1:39:02] in the evening time
[1:39:04] by the event time message
[1:39:06] oh
[1:39:07] oh
[1:39:08] oh
[1:39:09] you mean the holy spirit is to be loosed
[1:39:13] by the evil time message yes
[1:39:15] oh glory to god is loose today first he
[1:39:18] loose it with books and tapes but then
[1:39:20] he's going to lose it by spirit because
[1:39:22] the word and spirit is the same
[1:39:24] oh blessed being of the lord
[1:39:27] the holy spirit back again
[1:39:29] christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:39:33] in the evening time he promised it
[1:39:35] there's three stages the matter age
[1:39:38] the stage of reformers are now recalling
[1:39:40] all time
[1:39:41] when finished at the loud reason asia
[1:39:43] conversion 10 the mystery of the bible
[1:39:45] remain known to the bride revelation 10
[1:39:49] called out by the word christ himself
[1:39:52] calling out the bride not some man
[1:39:54] christ himself the lord himself
[1:39:57] descended with a shout seven thunders to
[1:39:59] get the bride threw them voices out to
[1:40:01] catch that lady that lady waiting for
[1:40:04] all these years a special lady a lady

[1:40:52] one there's got to become a real bride
[1:40:54] there's got to come one not only as the
[1:40:56] mechanics but the dynamics of it to make
[1:40:59] the church live and move in the power of
[1:41:01] the resurrection oh you mean this is
[1:41:03] what god wants the church to do live and
[1:41:05] move and operate in the power of his
[1:41:07] resurrection
[1:41:08] oh glory to every service god confirmed
[1:41:10] in the word every service the bible said
[1:41:12] the lord himself went everywhere with
[1:41:14] them anywhere they're going to go into
[1:41:17] everywhere everywhere ever devil know
[1:41:20] not to touch that church oh god i
[1:41:23] suffered no man to do them wrong same

[1:41:27] ham oh give the lord i shall the angel
[1:41:29] of the lord and camp
[1:41:30] [Music]

[1:41:48] glory to god
[1:41:50] watch until we come to that place until
[1:41:53] we get to that place what good does it
[1:41:55] do to polish the hubs what could it do
[1:41:57] to give a facelift
[1:41:59] if there's no dynamics in it you have a
[1:42:01] nice guy you're rubbing it down you're
[1:42:02] taking pictures by it but it can't start
[1:42:06] there's like an instagram car
[1:42:08] there's a picture
[1:42:09] a bicycle passing you and you
[1:42:11] you're a nice guy and a little boy that
[1:42:13] bicycle riding passing you and you stand
[1:42:15] up there because your car can't move
[1:42:19] when there's no dynamics in it
[1:42:22] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[1:42:23] to be right
[1:42:24] there's got to have a dynamics
[1:42:27] to make it work
[1:42:28] that's what he proved
[1:42:30] that's what easter proved
[1:42:31] he wasn't only the word
[1:42:33] but he was god himself the dynamics in
[1:42:36] the word
[1:42:37] so jesus said destroy this body and
[1:42:38] treat his idol rises up
[1:42:40] no you're saying i destroyed his body
[1:42:41] and tree i really like his mechanics
[1:42:43] but when he raised like dynamics
[1:42:46] hallelujah
[1:42:48] any man can talk he's talking you know
[1:42:50] but when jesus rushed from the dead he
[1:42:51] proved he wasn't just talking
[1:42:53] he was walking the dog
[1:42:55] he rose from the dead
[1:42:56] quickening power he went down with an
[1:42:58] alarm clock in him
[1:43:00] hallelujah when he said
[1:43:02] after three minutes he'll make a noise
[1:43:04] but he went on the grave with an alarm
[1:43:06] in him on the three days when jesus
[1:43:08] stated hit so glory to god earthquake
[1:43:12] rolled away the stone the man god in the
[1:43:14] tomb fell as one death oh glory to god
[1:43:17] because here come christ
[1:43:19] triumphant
[1:43:20] after being dead
[1:43:22] what about this bride of jesus christ
[1:43:24] after they reckon you dead after the
[1:43:26] world say you can't make it after this
[1:43:28] one write you off and that one write you
[1:43:30] off after you come dry dry dry like dry
[1:43:33] bones can these bones live
[1:43:35] is the bride gonna live are you going to
[1:43:38] live i say yes sir you're going to live.
[1:43:42] [Applause]
[1:43:46] that that made the body of jesus told
[1:43:48] watch coal stiff and dead in the grave
[1:43:50] shaking to life and rise again roll away
[1:43:52] the stone i am he that was dead so dead
[1:43:55] till the sun said he was dead the moon
[1:43:57] said he was dead the star said he was
[1:43:59] dead all nature said he was dead and now
[1:44:01] the whole world has to recognize that
[1:44:03] he's alive again he is not only
[1:44:05] mechanics god's word but he's the
[1:44:07] dynamics to prove it so that's what we
[1:44:10] have to come to preach the gospel not
[1:44:11] only the word but the dynamics the proof
[1:44:15] the word itself
[1:44:16] and he being the groom the bride has to
[1:44:18] come forth because it's part of him and
[1:44:21] it can only be here we go
[1:44:22] you don't know what a bride is it can
[1:44:24] only be the manifestation of the
[1:44:26] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[1:44:29] other has spoken of the bride so the
[1:44:31] pride will be a manifestation of god
[1:44:32] himself oh glory to god
[1:44:36] hallelujah
[1:44:37] no wonder when jesus took the book he
[1:44:39] could leave off that bat
[1:44:41] to declare the day of vengeance of our
[1:44:42] god because he know mrs jesus christ
[1:44:45] would go into the temple and pick up
[1:44:46] them very same scripture and read a book
[1:44:49] declare jubilee and then vengeance
[1:44:52] declare jubilee to free your family
[1:44:54] declare jubilee and then judgment to the
[1:44:57] world or give the lord a shout there
[1:45:00] will be one more ride i'll ride this
[1:45:02] trail once more
[1:45:04] oh glory to god
[1:45:06] here we go if it does something from the
[1:45:08] groom it isn't the bride
[1:45:10] because she is flesh of his flesh boon
[1:45:13] of his bone life of his life power is
[1:45:16] power she is him as one and woman are
[1:45:19] one the woman thinking from his side she
[1:45:21] had taken a spirit feminist pray from
[1:45:23] him the flesh from his side made more
[1:45:25] mechanics and dynamics the wife
[1:45:28] the spirit of him the flesh of him put
[1:45:30] it together made mechanics and dynamics
[1:45:33] oh glory to god so when you're talking
[1:45:35] about these sons manifested i know
[1:45:37] people like to talk about a scripture a
[1:45:39] quote bring bringing up the hidden

[1:47:44] about the coming and rapture
[1:47:47] he said we have lived time
[1:47:49] the time of the raptors at hand

[1:47:56] pull the church together
[1:47:59] oh you mean the church can stay as it is
[1:48:02] all them mighty message popes
[1:48:05] um running the kingdoms
[1:48:08] something had to pull it together you
[1:48:09] mean all them bones

[1:48:17] on some foot bone
[1:48:20] they're not a man like a foot bone foot
[1:48:22] bone had a finally ankle bone
[1:48:24] and ankle bone had to find a
[1:48:26] hip bone everything they get connected

[1:48:30] the man's still there you know but he's
[1:48:32] standing
[1:48:33] it coming closer
[1:48:35] it's almost as if god formed man again

[1:50:37] glory
[1:50:38] watch
[1:50:39] we are looking for a rapture and fate
[1:50:41] that can pull the church together
[1:50:44] and give it some supernatural strength
[1:50:47] that can change these bodies that we
[1:50:49] live in
[1:50:50] oh glory to god
[1:50:52] when the church get together it brings
[1:50:54] power
[1:50:58] that's why god hates division
[1:50:59] god hates separation god hit man's
[1:51:02] system and ideas and he would bless it
[1:51:05] oh glory to god you remove ministers if
[1:51:07] you have to move take them out

[1:52:52] me a man they will say who is he where
[1:52:54] he come from
[1:52:56] he is
[1:52:57] he don't belong here he's not one of us
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:04] there is a how long this thing going on
[1:53:06] how long only been
[1:53:08] how you long in this condition
[1:53:11] [Applause]
[1:53:14] glory
[1:53:16] david let me see it did he start going
[1:53:18] then
[1:53:18] they said he decided to give a testimony
[1:53:22] he said you know what one day i was
[1:53:23] seeing a sheep
[1:53:25] land come and i kill him
[1:53:27] yeah come and kill him
[1:53:29] and the god
[1:53:30] see so you do that i kill him i kill him
[1:53:33] but he god that deliver me
[1:53:34] or did he handle the beer and land
[1:53:37] see that dude there
[1:53:39] i'll take him out to him
[1:53:41] brother
[1:53:42] if you see that shoulder run to tell
[1:53:43] soul
[1:53:44] there's a brother in the camp he give a
[1:53:46] testimony
[1:53:48] so i said bring it bring bring fast
[1:53:50] they're feeling shame
[1:53:52] because after all these days nobody ever
[1:53:54] never gone telling her so they hear
[1:53:55] about some fella anybody he was really
[1:53:57] taking anybody if you raise up your hand
[1:53:58] you say i'll give him my daughter i'll
[1:54:00] give you money
[1:54:02] he's always right i i i ain't going for
[1:54:04] that terrorist you see that dude
[1:54:08] in the wrong position
[1:54:10] david was so confident the bible said he
[1:54:13] ran to meet him
[1:54:14] [Applause]
[1:54:16] you see if you're not sure
[1:54:18] it's a wonderful evil with that boy that
[1:54:20] giant a giant you know or could
[1:54:23] because we have been there before
[1:54:25] yeah them ten spies them ten ministers
[1:54:27] who went and see the land and eat grapes
[1:54:29] and everything else they said we can't
[1:54:30] take it because we see jazz
[1:54:32] they said did they see you no
[1:54:34] in our own eyes we felt so small
[1:54:39] so david went to meet him and david just
[1:54:41] started this thing and we know this
[1:54:42] story
[1:54:44] so what we need is supernatural strength
[1:54:45] listen to obama drill down deeper
[1:54:48] when we see a god
[1:54:50] see
[1:54:52] see
[1:54:54] when we see a god
[1:54:56] that can raise the dead
[1:54:58] off the floor
[1:55:00] or out in the yard
[1:55:02] and bring him back to life again
[1:55:04] and present him before us
[1:55:07] when we see a god that could take cancer
[1:55:10] that eat a manta shadow and raise him up
[1:55:13] strong healthy man that ought to give
[1:55:16] rapture and fear to the people
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:21] so i'll say it this way
[1:55:23] no divine healing no rapture
[1:55:27] that's something like a sting in it
[1:55:29] let me phrase it differently let me say
[1:55:31] how he said it he said how can we have
[1:55:33] faith
[1:55:34] for the rapture
[1:55:36] when we can't even feed
[1:55:38] for divine healing because the rapture
[1:55:40] is a glorified divine healing what a
[1:55:42] rapture doing is changing your bodies
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:46] into a glorified condition
[1:55:49] so you have to have a higher fit
[1:55:51] than you have right now
[1:55:53] so he put it to a dead being raised
[1:55:56] cancer being cured and when you
[1:55:58] understand that your faith gone higher
[1:56:00] and higher
[1:56:01] higher and higher
[1:56:03] in brahman meetings of faith going so he
[1:56:04] says milky white anything could happen
[1:56:07] oh how anything can happen
[1:56:10] all things are possible
[1:56:12] [Applause]
[1:56:19] you said when presented you before when
[1:56:21] we see a god we're going to take a
[1:56:22] cancer
[1:56:24] wash your time
[1:56:25] and eat a man to a shadow and raise him
[1:56:27] up to a strong healthy man that ought to
[1:56:29] give wrapped in faith to the people when
[1:56:30] that light flashes from the sky and the
[1:56:33] trumpet songs the body of christ will
[1:56:35] quickly be gathered together and change
[1:56:37] in a moment taken into the heavens
[1:56:39] there'll be something like that happen
[1:56:41] and our school of theology can never
[1:56:43] produce that yet they intellectually are
[1:56:46] all right
[1:56:47] but you've got to meet that light
[1:56:50] you've got to find out something
[1:56:52] my god let me get the whole flesh here
[1:56:54] now
[1:56:55] four roman messengers of death death
[1:56:58] took down god's tree four messengers of
[1:57:01] death killed the tree four missions of
[1:57:03] life restored the tree
[1:57:05] by four death messengers killed it then
[1:57:07] four life messengers were restored what
[1:57:08] was it first martin luther justification
[1:57:11] second generation vacation third
[1:57:13] pentecost with the restoration of the
[1:57:15] gifts the holy ghost baptism holy ghost
[1:57:17] what was the thought the word
[1:57:22] and that's what god gave the prophet the
[1:57:23] word right
[1:57:24] in the last days of malachi 4 elijah is
[1:57:27] to come but the very word
[1:57:29] the word of the lord came to the prophet
[1:57:31] in the evening light is to come to
[1:57:33] restore and bring back what turn the
[1:57:35] heart of the turin
[1:57:36] back to the feet of the fathers
[1:57:38] fought light
[1:57:40] so the fought light is to bring a
[1:57:41] restoration
[1:57:42] to what
[1:57:44] to the fate of the fathers
[1:57:46] what's the four stages of the coming of
[1:57:47] the church then
[1:57:49] and this is where he tied into the
[1:57:50] ezekiel scripture we read because we
[1:57:51] know that's pertaining to the jews but
[1:57:52] listen to this
[1:57:54] watch the four stages of that come and
[1:57:55] thought of the church was the four
[1:57:57] stages of ezekiel dry bones coming forth
[1:58:00] but the life only come
[1:58:02] not when the sinews skin was on them
[1:58:05] but when the wind blew in them
[1:58:07] and that is when come back the fourth
[1:58:10] message of life
[1:58:12] so listen how am i
[1:58:15] when ezekiel was asked can these bones
[1:58:18] live and he said don't know us
[1:58:20] god prophesied and said they shall live
[1:58:23] and i will cause life to come into them
[1:58:26] now god didn't tell ezekiel yet the
[1:58:28] process
[1:58:30] but god gave him the end game
[1:58:33] life will come into that
[1:58:39] so he give the end
[1:58:41] and then come back this way to work it
[1:58:44] suddenly there's a noise prophecy
[1:58:46] bone to bone hallelujah prophesy flesh
[1:58:50] come upon bone
[1:58:51] oh glory to god skin come upon flesh
[1:58:54] and then there's one another prophecy
[1:58:56] prophesied to the wind
[1:58:58] oh glory to god the four winds
[1:58:59] prophesied to the will
[1:59:01] there's a prophecy for life to come in
[1:59:03] that fought move
[1:59:05] was life coming in
[1:59:06] hallelujah and the end of it a mighty
[1:59:09] army
[1:59:10] oh blessed be the name of the lord sign
[1:59:13] vacation brought back the back
[1:59:15] doctrine of holiness pentecostal brought
[1:59:16] back rejoicing pray what was the thought
[1:59:19] the word
[1:59:20] the word made flesh
[1:59:22] fruits of the proof of his resurrection
[1:59:24] that christ has finally here we go after
[1:59:27] justification implanted sun vacation
[1:59:29] implanted back in the holy ghost
[1:59:31] organization died or christ has again
[1:59:33] centered himself like the cap of the
[1:59:34] pyramid first line justification
[1:59:37] signification
[1:59:38] baptism holy ghost then what the coming
[1:59:40] of the camp
[1:59:42] what is it that holy ghost bunch that's
[1:59:44] the bride
[1:59:45] being honed out to fit with that same
[1:59:47] kind of ministry god had cut in europe
[1:59:49] at church
[1:59:50] this church cut you to fit a ministry
[1:59:53] which is the ministry of jesus christ
[1:59:55] hear what it is for
[1:59:57] a ministry he had when he went away when
[1:59:59] he comes back it will catch the whole
[2:00:00] thing in the rapture
[2:00:02] where she is justified sanctified
[2:00:04] baptist that premier stand again the
[2:00:07] house of god will live again the tree of
[2:00:09] life is growing again oh blessed be the
[2:00:11] name of the lord hallelujah i'm on the
[2:00:14] home stretch here now praise god
[2:00:16] hallelujah praise peter jesus how do we
[2:00:19] get into the body by one spirit first
[2:00:22] corinthians 12 we are baptized into one
[2:00:24] body by one spirit we are baptized and
[2:00:27] the spirit is the life of christ
[2:00:29] isn't that right the life of christ and
[2:00:30] the life of any seed he was the word
[2:00:33] seed brings the sea to life you get it
[2:00:35] i told you in phoenix so long ago i was
[2:00:37] talking to a brother i talked about the
[2:00:39] citrus tree and it's an orange tree but
[2:00:41] it was lemon and tangerine and angelo
[2:00:43] and grapefruit it's all citrus isn't
[2:00:45] that right and many of you growers know
[2:00:47] in citrus valley it will be its own each
[2:00:49] one being its own but if that tree
[2:00:52] ever puts forth an original branch it
[2:00:54] will bring forth oranges and if god ever
[2:00:56] does anything again in the church it
[2:00:59] will be original back to the word again
[2:01:02] oh hallelujah praise god
[2:01:05] hallelujah are you with me
[2:01:07] therefore the word or nothing
[2:01:09] he the word is vindicated
[2:01:11] he the word properly vindicated is the
[2:01:14] headship the head of the church he is
[2:01:16] the word the headship he is properly
[2:01:19] identified vindicated by his own spirit
[2:01:22] being in the church the person showing
[2:01:24] himself vindication is direct proof to
[2:01:27] the entire body
[2:01:28] so when the holy spirit god almighty was
[2:01:30] veiling that prophet
[2:01:32] he was showing to the world that he is
[2:01:34] not dead he was jesus christ the same
[2:01:37] yesterday he then ever manifested
[2:01:39] himself through the flesh of a 20th
[2:01:41] century prophet
[2:01:42] now he's about a man even himself
[2:01:44] through the flesh of a bride
[2:01:46] oh glory to god that's why he said the
[2:01:48] ministry has reached perfection when
[2:01:50] christ is reproduced in the natural
[2:01:52] that is beyond talk that's beyond sermon
[2:01:55] that's beyond a good message oh glory to
[2:01:57] god hallelujah then we are united under
[2:02:00] one vindicated headship
[2:02:02] wow
[2:02:03] one vindicated headship not one pastor
[2:02:05] not one group not one church all one
[2:02:07] inspiration and this one had the
[2:02:09] inspiration this underworld inspiration
[2:02:10] not that
[2:02:11] united under one phoenix headship that
[2:02:14] is christ the word of god then here we
[2:02:16] go he switch it our headship is a
[2:02:18] kingdom
[2:02:20] all you mean we don't have headquarters
[2:02:21] no our headship now becomes a kingdom
[2:02:24] and the kingdom of god is within you
[2:02:27] so you can understand now why you say
[2:02:28] when they say low here go here go here
[2:02:29] forget them behold the kingdom is within
[2:02:31] you and the kingdom is what the word in
[2:02:33] you turn into power
[2:02:38] so that's why i say the rapture is not
[2:02:40] outside in it's inside out you will have
[2:02:42] the rapture in you
[2:02:44] because you have the kingdom in you
[2:02:46] nobody can see it touch it interfere
[2:02:47] with it they can't transform it they
[2:02:49] can't boil it out they had to boil out
[2:02:51] john in the alopacmos they couldn't boil
[2:02:52] him in hot water they couldn't burn it
[2:02:54] out in the fiery furnace they can't kill
[2:02:56] it it's the holy ghost it's the holy
[2:02:58] ghost and power it's keeping me alive
[2:03:00] hallelujah praise god you shall come up
[2:03:02] please oh glory to god it's all over me
[2:03:05] it's keeping me alive it's the holy
[2:03:07] ghost on fire holy ocean power keeping
[2:03:10] me alive here we go watch we belong to a
[2:03:13] kingdom
[2:03:14] and the kingdom is the word of god made
[2:03:17] spirit and life in our own life
[2:03:20] bringing the past every promise in this
[2:03:22] day as the day the day when god in the
[2:03:24] wood was one
[2:03:26] so if the headship of the body that is
[2:03:28] redeemed to bring the message of the
[2:03:30] last day and in the last day has come
[2:03:32] down in like manner vindicating himself
[2:03:35] his body he's talking about you the
[2:03:37] bride
[2:03:38] will do the works that he promised
[2:03:40] like in sin mark 16 his body was not
[2:03:42] held in the grave but was recognized
[2:03:45] with him in a resurrection do you get it
[2:03:47] then the body of his believing children
[2:03:49] will not be held in the grave
[2:03:51] when he comes
[2:03:53] but will be recognized with him
[2:03:55] no grave
[2:03:57] god hold this body down
[2:03:59] hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't hold
[2:04:01] christ's body down
[2:04:04] and the pride is part of christ
[2:04:06] they can't hold you down either
[2:04:08] glory to god because he died here we go
[2:04:10] for the purpose to resurrect his pride
[2:04:14] the body recognized because it is his
[2:04:16] body
[2:04:17] because it is his word
[2:04:19] so completely even from the nomination
[2:04:21] him to think that he is the word oh here
[2:04:24] we go his body was not held in the grave
[2:04:26] hallelujah and the word was done through
[2:04:28] the age of luther wesley has begun to
[2:04:30] raise up its power it began to move it
[2:04:33] moved a little more now it's coming up
[2:04:35] identification now here we go
[2:04:37] this is about paul's inspiration now the
[2:04:39] life in the body
[2:04:41] is of indication
[2:04:43] that the rapture is at hand
[2:04:46] when you see
[2:04:47] the headship and the body becoming one
[2:04:49] and the fullness of the measure of his
[2:04:51] manifestation shows that the body is
[2:04:53] about to receive the headship
[2:04:56] this has nothing to do with press coming
[2:04:58] down
[2:04:59] oh give the lord a shout is that none
[2:05:01] with us close being closed down this
[2:05:03] have to do with you
[2:05:05] recognize the life coming into the body
[2:05:08] is evidence
[2:05:09] the raptors trust around the corner
[2:05:11] because i'm acting like christ i am
[2:05:13] talking like christ i am living like
[2:05:16] christ i am doing what jesus did
[2:05:19] oh my
[2:05:20] he began to bring life to his body all
[2:05:22] right here we go
[2:05:25] justified in his sight why are we
[2:05:27] justified
[2:05:29] you know what justified me right
[2:05:30] not forgiven
[2:05:32] but as if you never did it why are we
[2:05:34] justified we are his victory
[2:05:37] the church is his victory
[2:05:39] we come forth in his last days with this
[2:05:42] glorious gospel
[2:05:43] showing his victory he died for this
[2:05:46] purpose and we are proof of his victory
[2:05:49] when we see him coming down and living
[2:05:51] among the church that is his victory it
[2:05:54] shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[2:05:55] grave neither can they keep us
[2:05:58] that's right we are already potentially
[2:06:00] raised
[2:06:01] because we are raised from the dead
[2:06:03] from unbelief in his word
[2:06:05] to an eternal word of god which is him
[2:06:08] himself working through us
[2:06:10] manifesting himself that he is the same
[2:06:12] yesterday today and forever
[2:06:14] there we go i'm almost finished
[2:06:16] when the word moves on dung into the
[2:06:18] body
[2:06:19] from the head what is it
[2:06:20] the same word
[2:06:22] moves from the head
[2:06:23] as the day come close
[2:06:25] dung into the body
[2:06:27] indicating that they are one
[2:06:29] so let's say the rapture is here as you
[2:06:31] get in the era
[2:06:32] the word
[2:06:33] from the head
[2:06:34] it's coming under the body
[2:06:36] the very life of christ is being
[2:06:38] reproduced
[2:06:39] back into the church you have nothing to
[2:06:41] do with what putin doing you have to do
[2:06:43] with what america is doing what the
[2:06:45] world is doing because there'll be two
[2:06:47] in a bed one taking one left
[2:06:49] glory the god
[2:06:51] here we go notice the vindicated word
[2:06:54] in his body is his very victory and
[2:06:58] reason of his death
[2:07:00] hallelujah see
[2:07:02] the death not in the spirit when he died
[2:07:04] you only die in the flesh his spirit
[2:07:05] went to hell and preached the souls in
[2:07:07] prison he only died when he raised up
[2:07:09] again and quick and quick and means made
[2:07:10] me the life his flesh which was his body
[2:07:13] that was the word i'd been laying dead
[2:07:14] for years but gradually through the
[2:07:16] reserve reformation she is standing up
[2:07:18] on her feet
[2:07:19] and he tying back to ezekiel again he
[2:07:21] said oh i wish i had time to go back to
[2:07:23] ezekiel and pull of them dry bones he
[2:07:26] said can these bone lives he said
[2:07:28] prophesy how can prophecy come but only

[2:07:39] start to play something
[2:07:40] how can the prophecy come
[2:07:42] except you a prophet we are prophesying
[2:07:44] the same prophecy
[2:07:46] it's a fresh prophecy of the same
[2:07:48] prophecy may the lord bless you thank
