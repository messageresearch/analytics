[32:34] like you to turn to your Bibles to three
[32:36] portion of scriptures tonight Matthew 16
[32:39] want to read from 13 to 18 Mark 11 20-
[32:43] 26 and Luke
[32:45] 15 8-9 reading Matthew
[32:49] 16 reading from verse
[32:54] 13 when Jesus came into the course of
[32:57] cesaria for Philippi asked his disciples
[32:59] saying whom men say I son of man am they
[33:02] said some say John the Baptist some
[33:05] Elias others Jeremiah or one of the
[33:08] prophets he said unto them but whom say
[33:10] ye that I am and Simon Peter answered
[33:12] and said thou the Christ the son of the
[33:15] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[33:17] unto him blessed are thou Simon B Jonah
[33:21] for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it
[33:22] unto thee but my Father which is in
[33:25] heaven and I say unto you the th Peter
[33:28] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[33:30] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[33:33] Prevail against it in Mark 11 reading
[33:37] from verse
[33:38] 22 Jesus has cursed the thick trees
[33:41] disciples saw it dried up by the roots
[33:44] verse 2122 says and Jesus answering said
[33:47] unto them have faith in God they saw a
[33:50] manifestation that blow their minds
[33:53] Jesus
[33:54] said uh have faith in God
[33:58] for verely I said to you that whosoever
[34:00] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[34:03] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[34:05] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[34:07] shall believe that those things which he
[34:09] sayth shall come to pass he shall have
[34:12] whatsoever he say therefore I said unto
[34:15] you what things soever you desire When
[34:19] you pray believe that you receive them
[34:23] and he shall have them and when you
[34:25] stand praying forgive if you have ought
[34:28] against any and your that your father
[34:31] which also in heaven May forgive you of
[34:33] your trespasses but if you do not
[34:36] forgive neither will your father which
[34:39] is in heaven forgive your trespasses
[34:43] final scripture from Luke chapter
[34:45] 15 verse 8 and9 either what woman having
[34:49] 10 pieces of silver if she lose one
[34:52] piece do not light a candle and sweep
[34:55] the house and seek diligence till she
[34:58] find it and when she had found it she
[35:01] called her friends and her neighbors
[35:04] together saying Rejoice with me for I
[35:07] found the peace which I had lost let's
[35:10] pray father we thank you for your word
[35:12] tonight and I pray that your presence
[35:14] will come into your word and Speak Life
[35:16] into your people we are needy people
[35:18] tonight and we our hearts open before
[35:21] you in Jesus name we pray amen you may
[35:23] be seated praise God thanks for coming
[35:25] out tonight it's a blessing to have you
[35:27] here tonight tonight and those that
[35:28] connected online God bless you pray that
[35:31] God be with you and inspire
[35:35] you before I start tonight I have a poem
[35:38] I like to read from you for to you uh
[35:41] someone share this with me this whole
[35:42] thing that I'm going to read and I
[35:44] thought it would be a blessing to the
[35:46] church the title of it is yourself to
[35:49] blame by Mimi white Miller that's the
[35:54] point if things go bad for you and make
[35:58] you a bit
[35:59] ashamed often you would find out that
[36:02] you have yourself to
[36:05] blame swiftly we ran to mischief and
[36:09] then the Bad Luck came why do we fault
[36:13] others we have
[36:15] ourselves to
[36:17] blame whatever happened to us here is
[36:20] what we say had it not been for so and
[36:23] so things wouldn't have gone that way
[36:27] and if you are short of friends I'll
[36:31] tell you what to do make an
[36:34] examination you'll find the faults in
[36:38] you you are the captain of your ship so
[36:42] agree with the same if you travel
[36:46] downward you have yourself to blame and
[36:50] this is some words after this far too
[36:53] often we find ourselves complaining
[36:56] about our situation or environment
[36:59] rather than taking the appropriate next
[37:02] action necessary to create the life we
[37:05] want to live it is very easy to fall
[37:10] into the Trap of blaming others or
[37:13] routinely feeling
[37:15] victimized the next time you find
[37:18] yourself heading in that direction
[37:20] reflect on this poem make an
[37:25] examination and see what you find fine
[37:28] no excuses you are the captain of your
[37:32] ship you can do it upon reflection make
[37:36] an examination you would find that
[37:39] there's an appropriate next action that
[37:42] you can take and you already have
[37:45] everything you need including permission
[37:48] act now take the appropriate next action
[37:53] that will move you closer to your
[37:55] objective only those who act will
[37:58] Triumph praise the Lord so I trust that
[38:00] this was a blessing to you I was a
[38:02] blessing to me and I trust that will
[38:03] edify you praise be to
[38:07] Jesus
[38:08] Hallelujah okay so I have a title
[38:13] unconscious subconscious fate that's the
[38:15] title have tonight
[38:18] unconscious subconscious fate and the
[38:21] definition of the unconscious is the
[38:24] part of the
[38:25] mind which is inaccessible to the
[38:29] conscious mind but which affects
[38:33] behavior and
[38:35] emotions I'll read it again the
[38:38] unconscious the part of the mind which
[38:41] is
[38:42] inaccessible to the conscious mind but
[38:46] which affects behavior and
[38:50] emotions let's go
[38:52] what it's the lady with the glasses on
[38:55] here she stands right here before me
[38:57] there she years amen virus isn't it
[38:59] sister right there you got a virus isn't
[39:02] that right they don't even know what to
[39:03] call it that's just an excuse the doctor
[39:05] give you that's all but it don't do no
[39:07] good now it's over you can go ahead and
[39:10] be well your faith made you well lot of
[39:14] Fai sits a lot of faith is sitting in
[39:16] the corner here what's the matter people
[39:18] start believing I don't know those
[39:21] people I have never seen them I don't
[39:24] know you but I challenge you in Christ's
[39:27] name to believe the Bible is true and
[39:31] Jesus is raised from the dead forget
[39:33] about those Church Creed and things and
[39:34] serve the Lord believe on him he raised
[39:36] from the dead you serve him in a measure
[39:38] that's right but my dear friend when the
[39:41] enemy come like a flood God raises a
[39:43] standard against it you read all these
[39:45] magazines and things how Satan is on a
[39:46] rampage God is raising a standard
[39:48] against it don't worry he's always on
[39:50] the right side he's always above the
[39:52] enemy all the time do you believe that
[39:54] lady sitting right there yes
[39:58] had more faith than you thought you
[40:01] had so he's telling a lady you do you
[40:04] believe that lady sitting there you had
[40:06] more faith than you thought you had
[40:09] faith is a subconscious Thing
[40:12] lady faith is not a mental act it is
[40:16] something that you subconsciously do it
[40:20] people try to look to the intellects for
[40:23] Faith When Faith doesn't lay there the
[40:26] reasons laid there Faith lays in the
[40:32] soul we give the Lord some Praises
[40:36] Hallelujah faith livs in the soul now if
[40:40] you notice the subconscious is where you
[40:45] live you yourself live there there's a
[40:48] conscious and there's a subconscious so
[40:51] the some subconscious say I believe the
[40:54] conscious say I believe the say you sure
[40:58] now what you really believe is you you
[40:59] know because that's where you really
[41:01] live not the mental part not the front
[41:04] part but the deep inside part if you
[41:07] notice the subconscious is where you
[41:09] live that's where you yourself live
[41:12] that's the reason it is hard for them to
[41:15] have faith up here first they say yes I
[41:18] got faith but down here it's not for
[41:22] me when the storms are raging the little
[41:25] little boat about to sink
[41:28] talking about Jesus he walked out just
[41:30] as cool as he could be and put his foot
[41:32] on the brail of the boat and looked up
[41:34] and said
[41:36] Peace look upon the ocean he said be
[41:39] still and he walked back and lay down
[41:42] and the wave was just as scam that was
[41:45] him Never Scared never excited never
[41:50] fussy they said we know who he is he is
[41:53] Bab we know he does this by the prince
[41:55] of devils he said if sat sat cast out
[41:58] Satan his kingdom is

[50:29] looked like he just believed God he had
[50:32] no explanation as to how that will be
[50:34] what he knew is God said so that was the
[50:37] original faith that was the faith in

[51:34] were in the message but not in the
[51:35] message you know who was sure they was

[51:43] and a half years he act them own
[51:45] disciples they in church they hearing

[52:06] say and they couldn't say because they
[52:10] didn't have a
[52:13] [Music]
[52:16] revelation Revelation the greatest thing
[52:18] could strike you tonight is the holy
[52:21] spirit revealing this word to you not
[52:24] revealing the church to you or the
[52:26] Pastor to you the reading the word to
[52:28] you because the word is God and the word
[52:31] could defeat the Devil anywhere any time
[52:33] any place under any condition you can't
[52:36] defeat the Devil but the word can and if
[52:38] the word can defeat the Devil the word
[52:39] in you make you a champion over what the
[52:43] devil could offer oh give the Lord a
[52:45] shout the word by itself could defeat
[52:48] the Devil but take the word and put it
[52:50] in you then you are more than oh go get
[52:52] me started tonight you are more than a
[52:54] conqueror I don't care if the whole
[52:56] world is against you I don't care if
[52:57] your roof fall off and your house burned
[52:59] down it doesn't matter the word is God
[53:01] he'll make a way for you oh glory to God
[53:04] hallelujah he would make a way for you
[53:08] hallelujah
[53:09] hallelujah let's
[53:11] go Abraham fullness of believing but
[53:14] hear this when you let your faith run
[53:18] out to its
[53:20] end till you begin to believe we could
[53:24] say that that but but it seem holding
[53:27] myself you did you hear that when your
[53:30] faith run out to the end till you begin
[53:34] to believe afterwards this impossibility
[53:37] start to become possible because God
[53:39] said so Hallelujah first it starts as a
[53:42] seed like God said that this is going to
[53:46] happen Hallelujah is this is the word
[53:48] but then you start to believe what think
[53:50] I'm Mary she know the scriptures a
[53:53] virgin shall conceive she know she was
[53:55] virtuous when the Angel spoke to her she
[53:57] had a question the question was a very
[54:00] important question how this going to be
[54:03] the angel released the answer the Holy
[54:05] Spirit and when when that when that was
[54:07] spoken that was all the that was the
[54:09] last straw of any questions or doubts
[54:11] you know she ran Elizabeth not to
[54:13] explain not to repeat what the angel
[54:16] says but to confess her Revelation that
[54:19] she going to have a son without emotions
[54:22] without feelings without sensation with
[54:25] no experience at all this little virgin
[54:28] giving a testimony of her confession of
[54:31] a revelation that the angel appeared to
[54:33] her oh can the Lord I shout no other
[54:36] virgin had that testimony no other one
[54:38] heard the voice of God no other one but
[54:42] Mary and Mary represent that bright
[54:44] tonight she has the ability to hear from
[54:47] God oh give the Lord I shout did you get
[54:49] that tonight they should make you run
[54:51] and jump and and spin and go around the
[54:53] church and come back up the bride have
[54:55] the ability to hear from God no man
[54:59] could take that ability from you oh give
[55:02] the Lord a shout in the house the bride
[55:05] has the ability to hear from God that
[55:09] mean God can speak to you oh glory to
[55:12] God you don't have to speak to you true
[55:13] anybody he can speak true to you just
[55:16] like he spoke to
[55:21] Peter so let's dissect this a bit when
[55:25] you let your faith run out to its end
[55:29] till you begin to
[55:30] believe then let your subconscious go to
[55:36] acting then the faith of God will back
[55:38] it
[55:44] up cuz your faith won't do too
[55:48] much your
[55:51] subconscious has to move in the
[55:55] direction that your faith is moving and
[55:58] then God's faith moves in behind and
[56:02] confirms it all oh give the Lord a shout
[56:08] hallelujah my my my my
[56:12] myoo hallelujah hallelujah your
[56:16] subconscious have to move in the
[56:19] direction that your faith is moving Oh
[56:22] Glory your subconscious have to move in
[56:25] the dire direction that your faith is
[56:28] moving let me say it again your
[56:29] subconscious have to move in the
[56:32] direction that your faith is moving your
[56:34] subconscious have to move in the
[56:36] direction that your faith is moving and
[56:39] then God's faith comes behind that the
[56:42] backs that up because your conscious and
[56:45] your subconscious line up together it's
[56:47] an alignment and when God sees that
[56:49] alignment he drops down behind it and
[56:52] back up the whole thing oh give the Lord
[56:54] a shout by faith Abraham by Fai Fai
[56:56] Isaac by faith jeffi the conscious and
[56:59] the conscious line up together and God's
[57:01] faith dropped down behind it those
[57:03] Hebrew boys Oh Glory if you pray we're
[57:06] going to hot that fire seven times
[57:08] hotter they say our God is able to
[57:09] deliver if he doesn't Deliver us we
[57:11] still not going to bow down and we going
[57:13] be dead anyhow so they died out to
[57:16] themselves and they align their
[57:18] subconscious with their conscience so
[57:19] glory of God isn't that right they start
[57:22] to move in the direction our God is able
[57:24] to deliver us hallelujah and their faith
[57:26] was so thundering that heaven start to R
[57:29] Rumble with that kind of Fai the angel
[57:32] want to have water want to out it this
[57:34] one want to partake this one want to

[1:00:27] to let it go to show he was mature to
[1:00:31] show he was right so the church has come

[1:00:37] brother brandham put as the Lost coin
[1:00:39] that this woman lost and she swept
[1:00:42] diligently to find what she had lost
[1:00:44] this thing about forgiveness is so
[1:00:46] powerful because this thing about
[1:00:48] forgiveness open up a channel that that
[1:00:51] Mark 11:22 could be manifested whatever
[1:00:54] you say and don't doubt in your heart
[1:00:58] let me switch it whatever you say with
[1:00:59] your conscious mouth mind and don't
[1:01:01] doubt in your subconscious you can have
[1:01:04] what you say with your mouth conscious

[1:01:20] have what you say and to practice When
[1:01:23] you pray
[1:01:27] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:01:31] and you shall have what you ask for but
[1:01:34] before that when you stand praying oh

[1:01:41] forgive you cut yourself off if you
[1:01:43] don't forgive you finish and you have a
[1:01:46] Book and Tape of the message Hallelujah
[1:01:48] if you don't forgive you're not a
[1:01:50] believer
[1:01:59] much people the message not ready the
[1:02:03] message because Jesus was saying
[1:02:06] that when you stand praying because you
[1:02:09] can't just jump into speak to the
[1:02:13] mountain David got lion and

[1:02:33] number two When you pray ask then you
[1:02:36] give number one when you stand praying
[1:02:38] forgive so let's reverse it let's start
[1:02:41] from
[1:02:44] forgiveness the word influences men but
[1:02:47] prayer influences
[1:02:50] God so even though we have the word
[1:02:53] believe the word we need to access God
[1:02:55] by this Spirit that's why God hates the
[1:02:57] intellectual part in this
[1:03:00] message because the intellectual part
[1:03:02] don't need the spirit they don't need
[1:03:04] God because they know
[1:03:08] stuff but you know in
[1:03:11] part but when that which is perfect has
[1:03:14] come which is charity and charity the pr
[1:03:17] absolute could only come to a Channel of
[1:03:19] Brotherly kindness that's why brotherly
[1:03:21] kindness is dear and then the holy
[1:03:23] spirit is right on top of that to seal
[1:03:25] the Hol thing if there's no channel of
[1:03:27] Brotherly kindness the Holy Spirit can't
[1:03:29] sweep through and the Holy Spirit have
[1:03:31] to sweep through and when we were in Kwa
[1:03:32] 1981 the spirit spoke and said where is
[1:03:35] the honey where is the brotherly
[1:03:38] kindness the spirit want to seal the
[1:03:40] whole thing oh glory to God but where is
[1:03:42] the spirit of forgiveness oh give the
[1:03:44] Lord I shout in the house my my my do
[1:03:47] you get that tonight glory to God truth
[1:03:50] is not truth unless it's connected to
[1:03:52] the spirit of Truth a man giving
[1:03:54] information giving knowledge and all and
[1:03:55] that's that that's knowledge and
[1:03:57] information and word that's not the
[1:03:58] truth unless the spirit of Truth is
[1:04:00] behind that oh glory to God the spirit
[1:04:02] of truth the truth is a person the truth
[1:04:04] really is Jesus Christ so be behind the
[1:04:07] real truth there's a spirit of Truth
[1:04:09] bringing truth not just a man talking
[1:04:12] the top of your head oh give the Lord
[1:04:14] some Praises so in KYW the Holy Spirit
[1:04:16] spoke out 1981 where is the brotherly
[1:04:19] kindness where is the Honey Hallelujah
[1:04:22] where is that
[1:04:23] coin Hallelujah so now my God something
[1:04:28] struck me what going
[1:04:30] message men not
[1:04:32] mature that why the animosity and the
[1:04:34] divisiveness that is why continue and
[1:04:37] man open him mouth and saying the wrong
[1:04:38] thing and God hates that God hates
[1:04:42] Discord the Bible you know you to be the
[1:04:44] message to see that you know just read
[1:04:46] the scripture he hates it when God hates
[1:04:49] something God hate something in know I
[1:04:51] hate it he hate this cord and man
[1:04:54] throwing seeds where they get from
[1:04:56] the the AR
[1:04:57] store where they get seeds from these
[1:05:00] hateful seeds as talk about somebody to
[1:05:03] stab it to kill you they just have to
[1:05:05] say evil about the ministry and kill
[1:05:08] your influence and that's murder because
[1:05:11] you're no longer effective to the people
[1:05:14] like if a parent said talk against the
[1:05:16] ministry it killed the effect upon the
[1:05:17] children and they ruined the children
[1:05:20] ruin the family and then they want to
[1:05:22] know why why this happen in the house
[1:05:24] who is to blame read the poem again oh
[1:05:27] give the Lord some Praises who's the
[1:05:30] blame but T do that and the church do
[1:05:33] that and he say like me what kind of
[1:05:35] foolishness who's the
[1:05:37] blame I no friends who's the
[1:05:43] blame what did the prophet said how they
[1:05:45] get closer to the love of God how they
[1:05:46] get closer to God read your Bible and
[1:05:47] pray monthly pray yearly half no read
[1:05:51] your Bible and pray every day if if you
[1:05:53] do that it's something must happen
[1:05:55] inside your heart
[1:05:56] you think the devil want you to be
[1:05:57] repeating this
[1:06:02] thing when you let your faith run out to
[1:06:04] its end till you begin to believe then
[1:06:08] you let your subconscious go to acting
[1:06:11] then the faith of God will back it up
[1:06:13] cuse your faith won't do too much your
[1:06:17] subconscious has to move in the
[1:06:20] direction that your faith is moving and
[1:06:22] then God's faith moves in behind let's
[1:06:25] look at that woman with the daughter Vex
[1:06:28] with the
[1:06:29] devil she is not a
[1:06:32] Jew she come to the disciples and said I
[1:06:34] want to see the master my daughter devil
[1:06:35] help help help help help help she's
[1:06:38] going for
[1:06:39] help she walking be disciples them
[1:06:42] brothers trying to pmer off them know
[1:06:44] what laying hands they know what casting
[1:06:46] our Devils but this is different the
[1:06:49] daughter is not there they can't lay No
[1:06:51] Hands they can't speak no word this is a
[1:06:54] new realm for them together so they went
[1:06:57] to Jesus said Jesus just talk to that
[1:06:59] woman behind us there because she's
[1:07:02] talking she keep following us Jesus
[1:07:06] didn't even look at the woman he just
[1:07:08] said it's not fit to take the children's
[1:07:10] bread and cast it to
[1:07:11] dogs the woman heard that it was
[1:07:14] deliberate words it was words that was
[1:07:17] designed for her to hear to see how
[1:07:20] she'll react now Fai is what brought her
[1:07:23] there she wasn't going to come if she
[1:07:25] didn't have Faith because she believed
[1:07:27] Jesus could help her so Faith brought
[1:07:29] her there but a word came to question
[1:07:33] and challenge the faith that she had to
[1:07:35] bring her there and when that word came
[1:07:38] she stood her ground so now what
[1:07:40] subconscious have to move now should I
[1:07:42] move and go to Facebook and complain she

[1:14:23] with stuff when they have weak they
[1:14:25] always come to touch just get them out
[1:14:28] thieves included get your unbelievers
[1:14:30] out and she get some disciples in get
[1:14:33] some suppor in all them having to back
[1:14:35] up the fate and whatnot and talita arise
[1:14:39] give us something to eat end the
[1:14:42] story Oh My My My you can take some more
[1:14:45] let's go let's
[1:14:47] go they said to me why brother Bram the
[1:14:51] reason it doesn't because the life is
[1:14:53] gone out of you
[1:14:55] then which is the Healer the medicine or
[1:14:57] the Life Life Is A Healer then God is
[1:15:01] life life does the healing medicine
[1:15:05] doesn't build tissue medicine doesn't
[1:15:07] develop cells medicine only keeps clean
[1:15:12] while God develops cells grows and Men
[1:15:16] your arm heals up the cut place so
[1:15:19] medicine doesn't heal medicine is an
[1:15:23] assistant someone said to me long go
[1:15:25] then what about pneumonia if you got
[1:15:27] pneumonia the doctor give you penisin so
[1:15:29] what does penisin do I said if you had a
[1:15:31] house full of rats and they were eating
[1:15:33] holes to the plaster all over the floor
[1:15:35] rats and you put out rat poison and kill
[1:15:37] all the rats it might kill the rats but
[1:15:40] it won't patch the holes that they eat I
[1:15:42] said that's what penon is it kills the
[1:15:44] flu germs but it doesn't patch the cells
[1:15:47] that been tore down God has to do that
[1:15:49] so he is the only healer God is the
[1:15:52] Healer and then it's your faith in God
[1:15:56] and many people have faith
[1:15:58] subconsciously and doesn't know
[1:16:03] it so God do expect you to be hearing
[1:16:05] this and you're watching me like
[1:16:08] if I'm ET or something some kind of
[1:16:12] extraterrestrial you do you don't want
[1:16:13] to believe what what we saying do you
[1:16:16] get that because I share with you
[1:16:18] already but told a woman you have more
[1:16:20] faith than your think didn't you in
[1:16:22] other words you didn't expect that did
[1:16:23] you because her faith pop up she had
[1:16:27] more faith he could see it what what
[1:16:29] Peter the the man at the gate he said I
[1:16:32] perceive you are fa to be
[1:16:38] healed I'm feeling inspired tonight not
[1:16:41] a jump up sh service but but G Peter
[1:16:43] said I perceive you have faith to be
[1:16:45] healed rise up and walk in the name of
[1:16:47] Jesus
[1:16:51] Christ the the woman with the blood
[1:16:53] issue she told herself
[1:16:55] that told herself wasn't in her head in
[1:16:56] know because her husband tell her don't
[1:16:58] go to that small church thing don't go
[1:16:59] to that Jesus thing and she know the
[1:17:01] money run out paying doctors and the
[1:17:03] doctors can help nothing so she told
[1:17:05] herself that herself is subconscious
[1:17:07] subconscious level you know that is why
[1:17:09] the crowd Around Jesus didn't throw her
[1:17:11] off you know but you know some people
[1:17:13] like that you know when they see the
[1:17:14] crowd they tomorrow for me yes I will
[1:17:16] take the next service not
[1:17:20] tonight but she told herself if I could
[1:17:23] touch him of His Garment yes sir so her
[1:17:26] job was to get to this garment and the
[1:17:28] crowd was there to hinder her hardfaced
[1:17:32] men tall pareses welld designed clothes
[1:17:35] and whatnot men with big ring and all
[1:17:37] kind of stuff and staff and whatnot
[1:17:39] looking real religious and powerful men
[1:17:41] that you wouldn't want to go close by
[1:17:42] she had to BN them and press your way
[1:17:45] through and when she touched the Hem of
[1:17:47] Jesus G she knew she was healed and
[1:17:50] Jesus knew virtue left him a power left
[1:17:53] him something left him somebody made a
[1:17:56] withdrawal is only Faith could do that
[1:17:59] she wasn't baptized in Jesus name and
[1:18:00] she wasn't in the message oh give the
[1:18:02] Lord some Praises me started tonight oh
[1:18:05] glory to God but she had Faith where
[1:18:07] that Faith come from that wasn't an
[1:18:09] external fi that was a Faith from within
[1:18:12] Jesus confirmed it by saying thy faith
[1:18:15] had made thee whole Give the Lord some
[1:18:17] Praises tonight so don't tell me people
[1:18:19] don't have faith faith is
[1:18:22] subconscious and to prove it you know
[1:18:25] there are many times that we try to
[1:18:27] reach for something for a certain kind
[1:18:29] of a fate and you don't have to have
[1:18:31] some kind of super fate to be healed the
[1:18:34] only thing you have to have is just the
[1:18:36] faith that you got you know the Bible
[1:18:39] the blood was applied to the doors by
[1:18:41] his up our Cy Brothers know hup is
[1:18:44] common weed what is it the people today
[1:18:47] are trying to find an orchid to apply
[1:18:50] the blood with it's not even applied by
[1:18:52] an orchid it's applied by by his up
[1:18:56] common everyday Fai you don't have to
[1:19:00] have a super fate how did you come here
[1:19:02] how did you know you're going to leave
[1:19:04] how can you drive your car how do you
[1:19:06] know you can move your hand you just
[1:19:08] subconsciously do it because you believe
[1:19:10] you can do it and that's the reason you
[1:19:12] believe for your healing it's just
[1:19:14] settled and that's just all it doesn't
[1:19:16] take some higher education it doesn't
[1:19:18] take some super duper something it takes
[1:19:20] common faith in God and faith is common
[1:19:25] just like his up just common reads all
[1:19:30] over and brother
[1:19:32] Bram stretch here I had this inside of
[1:19:35] here about rock confession He said Each
[1:19:37] age has had his Rock confession and and
[1:19:40] up to this rock confession of the laia
[1:19:43] then he said you cannot make a holy
[1:19:44] church there's no such thing as a holy
[1:19:46] church the Holy Spirit can be preached
[1:19:47] in it but in there you find good and bad
[1:19:50] Renegade indifferent than everything
[1:19:51] else so an organization wasn't hold it
[1:19:53] and he's talking about Shepherd dream in
[1:19:55] which a man poured his water into this
[1:19:59] big rock box and it leaked right out run
[1:20:02] down the hill and then he came and
[1:20:03] poured his bucket of honey and it looked
[1:20:06] like it would break but it didn't break
[1:20:09] it looked like it wasn't to but the
[1:20:11] honey held so he was interpreting the
[1:20:13] dream and so like that he said this is
[1:20:16] he said this Tabernacle is not a holy
[1:20:17] ghost Tabernacle there's no such a thing
[1:20:19] as that individuals that come into this
[1:20:21] church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they
[1:20:23] are Tabernacles that contain the Holy
[1:20:26] Ghost but not the church as a group but
[1:20:28] this man who was pouring the water The
[1:20:30] Messengers to the church pouring the
[1:20:32] message to the church what was the water
[1:20:34] doing it was boiling out the trash that
[1:20:36] was in it and that is what the Holy
[1:20:38] Spirit does now the honey here we go
[1:20:41] represented Brotherly Love brotherly
[1:20:44] kindness which is this age so this
[1:20:47] brotherly kindness has to come on
[1:20:49] display not just as a revelation but as
[1:20:51] a manifestation that God can see so when
[1:20:54] God told the prophet be careful what you
[1:20:57] see and the people come in church making
[1:21:00] love and carrying on what not and he
[1:21:01] begged him talking to them and God said
[1:21:02] whatever you say it would happen to them
[1:21:05] then he said I forgive you and then the
[1:21:07] Holy Spirit fell upon that to confirm
[1:21:09] that was God In Action forgiven them
[1:21:12] because he had failed he had sinned he
[1:21:14] had backslid and whatever it is and God
[1:21:16] forgive him he forgiv them not only that
[1:21:18] God take him when he was in the
[1:21:19] restaurant and condemning the woman and
[1:21:21] condemning all the place and with my
[1:21:22] daughter going to raise in this place
[1:21:24] and God put him aside show him his sins
[1:21:26] show him the blood bumper show him his
[1:21:28] put all his sins and see forgetfulness
[1:21:30] he said I forgive you and you condemn
[1:21:31] her what is God doing there he's
[1:21:34] teaching the prophet to how to go to the
[1:21:36] next level and to go to the next level
[1:21:38] you can't be
[1:21:39] self-righteous you can't be
[1:21:42] legalistic come on now you can't sit
[1:21:44] down on Moses seat to go into the next
[1:21:46] level you can't judge me skirt and pant
[1:21:48] woman and cut them off and say well they
[1:21:50] finished they're not in it you can't say
[1:21:52] that because the Bible said whosoever
[1:21:54] will will come oh give the Lord a shout
[1:21:56] you have to be in a position to say
[1:21:57] whosoever will you have to be in a
[1:21:59] position to say the spirit in the bright
[1:22:01] say come the blood that apply to you
[1:22:03] have to be for others the Forgiveness
[1:22:05] apply to you have to go to others the
[1:22:07] grace apply to you must go to others the
[1:22:09] love apply to you must go to others oh
[1:22:12] give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah
[1:22:14] and you have to shine the light just as
[1:22:16] the father shine light on the good and
[1:22:18] the bad and the just and the unjust Oh
[1:22:20] Glory to God how the rainfall your life
[1:22:23] must produce that oh give the Lord some
[1:22:25] Praises so God in wisdom put Bradly
[1:22:29] kindness at the top so when Jesus said
[1:22:32] when you stand praying forgive if you
[1:22:33] have order against say he was speaking
[1:22:34] about us he was speaking about this age
[1:22:37] and the only way we have to forgive is
[1:22:39] has to be
[1:22:40] backal people outside might understand
[1:22:43] that confusion and liars and tattling
[1:22:51] toies once you have that group
[1:22:57] they go say the wrong thing they would
[1:22:59] lie about you and God not testing them
[1:23:01] God testing
[1:23:06] you you see I show to like brother nther
[1:23:10] I show like brother Jones I sure like
[1:23:12] brother
[1:23:14] ID good Lord but God love
[1:23:18] him you in
[1:23:22] trouble I sh like brother Jones I don't
[1:23:25] like brother so and so something like
[1:23:27] that but you let something happen to him
[1:23:29] brother your heart is
[1:23:31] broke it's nearly kill you we can obtain
[1:23:35] brotherly kindness and feeding for one
[1:23:38] another but to me why do you care for
[1:23:40] that brother because he brought break
[1:23:42] with you he shook your hands he worship
[1:23:43] with him he might do something in the
[1:23:46] flesh that you would disagree with
[1:23:48] because you kind of say he what to do sh
[1:23:50] him but in the bottom of the heart
[1:23:52] something happened to that brother will
[1:23:53] kill you
[1:23:55] I'm an old man I was once young I'm old
[1:23:58] I've seen it down to the age I hear
[1:23:59] people say I just won't have no more to
[1:24:01] do with him that is rampant in the
[1:24:04] message where the coin is is in
[1:24:06] that they lost the coin alone they lost
[1:24:10] all all the coins they lost the basic of
[1:24:13] Christianity if you say you have no sin
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:18] lie but if you confess your sin you what
[1:24:21] I'm saying that then the blood of Jesus
[1:24:23] cleanses us amen cleanses us and we have
[1:24:27] Fellowship one with another so if we
[1:24:30] cannot have Fellowship one with another
[1:24:32] something wrong something wrong you

[1:35:19] while he is talking charity the Holy
[1:35:22] Ghost Dynamics the power dunamis that
[1:35:25] dropped down upon them and they were
[1:35:26] filled with the Holy Ghost and Peter
[1:35:29] confessed it's the same holy ghost that
[1:35:30] they receive these bers receive they may

[1:36:06] is not the Pentecostal age this is not
[1:36:08] 1906 this is Dynamics to the mechanics
[1:36:11] Hallelujah this is fire because the Holy
[1:36:14] Spirit Oh Glory to God this broadly

[1:36:47] healed how do we get people that way
[1:36:50] some can receive it some cannot receive
[1:36:52] it but those who can receive it they
[1:36:53] look at it and accept it believe it
[1:36:55] others maybe in other meeting now that's
[1:36:57] one way of preaching by the word another
[1:36:59] way is to maybe speak with tongues and
[1:37:01] they give interpretation you talking
[1:37:02] about how people get in the atmosphere
[1:37:03] right then something happen to you now
[1:37:06] remember when God is making his
[1:37:09] Revelation or revealing himself to his
[1:37:12] people now that's the benefit of the
[1:37:14] meance that is what God give the gifts
[1:37:17] for was to Magnify Him and to unify the
[1:37:21] people to bring the body together to
[1:37:24] help us to unite our efforts and our
[1:37:27] prayers a person here we go sitting in a
[1:37:31] group of people like this where faith is
[1:37:33] gathered on every side it will help you
[1:37:36] to get well there'll be a people who
[1:37:39] listens at the word being taught that
[1:37:42] will never be in a prayer line yet they
[1:37:45] will get well for something happen
[1:37:49] subconsciously maybe they don't even
[1:37:52] realize what is about
[1:37:54] they will get well somebody sitting and
[1:37:56] watch one of the signs of the Lord
[1:37:57] appear and they will get well it is when
[1:38:01] Faith then he use these words anything
[1:38:04] that can stimulate
