[1:41] Sh
[1:47] around us might

[1:58] the light of
[2:01] the Oh,
[2:10] and we praise him this morning.
[2:12] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:15] Jesus, the light of the world.
[2:18] Hallelujah. He is the light this
[2:20] morning. We don't walk in darkness.
[2:24] We walk in the light.
[2:26] Praise him for his light.
[2:29] Thank you, Lord. or bless you and
[2:31] welcome to the house of the Lord. Are
[2:33] you feeling fine this morning? Are you
[2:35] happy to be in his presence?
[2:38] Are you happy to be found alive in one
[2:41] piece with all your arms and legs in
[2:44] place? He did that this morning and he's
[2:48] just about getting started to bless you
[2:51] tremendously this morning. So, welcome
[2:53] to the house of the Lord. And if you
[2:56] have your Bibles, we'd like to turn to a
[2:58] portion of scripture in the Psalms,
[3:01] Psalms chapter 103
[3:05] uh for a scripture reading. Amen.
[3:15] Amen. Psalms 103 from verse 1 to vers 12
[3:19] we'll read and um it says bless the Lord
[3:24] oh my soul and all that is within me
[3:29] bless his holy name.
[3:31] Bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not
[3:35] all his benefits who forgiveth all thine
[3:39] iniquities
[3:40] who healeth all thy diseases. Who
[3:43] redeemth thy life from destruction, who
[3:46] crowneth thee with loving kindness and
[3:49] tender mercies, who satisfyth thy mouth
[3:53] with good things, so that thy youth is
[3:56] renewed like the eagles. The Lord
[3:59] executed righteousness and judgment for
[4:02] all that are oppressed. He made known
[4:06] his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the
[4:09] children of Israel. The Lord is merciful
[4:13] and gracious, slow to anger and
[4:16] plenteous in mercy. He will not always
[4:19] chide, neither will he keep his anger
[4:22] forever. For he had not dealt with us
[4:25] after our sins, nor rewarded us
[4:28] according to our iniquities. For as the
[4:31] ha uh heaven is high above the earth, so
[4:34] great is his mercy toward them that fear
[4:38] him. As far as the east is from the
[4:40] west, so far hath he removed our
[4:44] transgressions from us. May the Lord add
[4:47] blessing
[4:49] to the reading of his word. Let us pray
[4:52] together. Almighty God, we thank you
[4:55] Lord to be in your house this morning.
[4:57] We thank you that as far as the east is
[5:00] from the west, so far have you removed
[5:04] our transgressions from us. We thank you
[5:07] for the blood of your son Jesus Christ
[5:10] that was offered as a price for our sin
[5:13] that we could come blameless before you
[5:15] in love this morning clothed in the
[5:18] blood of Jesus Christ. Lord, nothing
[5:20] that we've done for ourselves, Lord.

[5:25] tree is more than enough this morning.

[5:30] today to worship you, to praise you, to
[5:33] thank you, Lord, Father, to give you all
[5:36] the glory this morning that is due unto

[5:48] come down in a special way, Father. May
[5:51] you come down from heaven. May you
[5:54] engulf us this morning. May you surround
[5:57] us this morning, Father. May you, Lord,
[5:59] overthrow us this morning, Lord, and
[6:02] overcome us, Lord. We We don't want to
[6:04] believe the same way we come. We want to
[6:07] leave with a greater faith, Lord. A
[6:10] greater anointing, Father. We pray you
[6:12] bless your servant this morning as he
[6:14] prepares himself to speak the word of
[6:16] God and to be yielded to the pillar of
[6:19] fire. We pray the moving of the spirit
[6:22] would be so uh uh so eminent this
[6:24] morning that Lord lives would be changed
[6:27] Lord and transformed that the angel of
[6:30] God would have his own way in this
[6:32] place. Lord he would move from aisle to
[6:34] aisle Lord ministering to those that
[6:36] have need of you Lord. May you speak the
[6:38] word Lord Father Lord through your
[6:41] servant today Lord that be in such a way
[6:43] it be effective to us dear God that the
[6:45] spirit of God will be able to come
[6:47] behind it and make it alive. Lord may I
[6:50] have your way today uh this morning and

[34:59] For Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a
[35:02] son in his old age, at the set time of
[35:06] which God had spoken to him. And Abraham
[35:09] called the name of his son that was born
[35:10] unto him for whom Sarah bear to him
[35:13] Isaac.
[35:15] Joshua chapter 21 verse 45.
[35:20] And the Lord give them rest roundout
[35:22] according to all that he swore unto
[35:25] their fathers. And they stood not a man
[35:28] of all their enemies before them. The
[35:32] Lord delivered all their enemies into
[35:35] their hands. Amen. Let us pray. Father,
[35:38] we thank you for your word. May you
[35:39] interpret it to our hearts in Jesus name
[35:40] I ask it. Amen and amen. You may be
[35:42] seated. Glory. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[35:45] Hallelujah.
[35:47] It's good to be here in the house of
[35:48] God. Amen. Amen. And I appreciate all of
[35:51] you being out here this morning as we
[35:54] look to see what the Lord will speak to
[35:56] us.
[35:58] On Friday in the prayer meeting, I spoke
[36:00] about who are you. And he spoke about
[36:03] that question of who are you doesn't
[36:05] pertain to what you do, what your job,
[36:07] what your qualifications is, what house
[36:09] you have, uh who what people see about
[36:11] you. That that deals with the character
[36:14] what you are.
[36:16] And we talk about when this service talk
[36:18] about gifts and talk about character and
[36:21] gifts is two different things. Gifts and
[36:23] callings without repentance. Somebody
[36:25] have gift to sing, gift to preach, gift
[36:27] to teach, gift to prophesy, all kind of
[36:29] gifts. Gift to play music. But that has
[36:31] nothing to do with the character of the
[36:33] person. And many times we misunder
[36:36] understand the gift and what it is as
[36:39] opposed to the man's life and character
[36:41] and spirit. So what God looks is in the
[36:44] spirit of a man. Amen. The character of
[36:46] a man, the metal of a man. What makes a
[36:49] manuh be original and and like how we
[36:52] could say David a man after my my own
[36:54] heart is a heart for God.
[36:57] So this morning I have a title, God's
[36:58] faithfulness to his promises.
[37:02] God faithfulness to his promises. And I
[37:05] have a context scripture from Numbers
[37:06] chapter 23:1 19. God is not a man that
[37:10] he should lie. Neither the son of man
[37:12] that he should repent. Hat he said and
[37:16] shall he not do it? Or had he spoken and
[37:20] shall he not make it good? He will bless
[37:23] you if you want to do right and follow
[37:25] his word. Amen. And he will judge you if
[37:28] you reject and follow in your own way.
[37:31] Amen. So we read the scripture. The Lord
[37:33] visited Sarah as he was said because
[37:35] that was a promise. That was a promise
[37:37] that Abraham believed. He had faith
[37:39] because God spoke to him. He had faith
[37:41] both for himself and for his wife. The
[37:44] faith wasn't just for himself. It was
[37:45] for his wife also. Because through her
[37:48] the son had to come true. Isn't that
[37:50] right? So he had to have faith in God
[37:53] for his wife. He couldn't mistreat her.
[37:55] He couldn't divorce her. He couldn't
[37:56] kick her out the house. He couldn't put
[37:57] her away. He got angry and vex and so
[37:59] on. That is the woman by which God said
[38:02] you're going to have that child. And the
[38:04] Bible said the Lord visited Sarah as he
[38:07] had said. It has to come out his mouth.
[38:09] So when that word come out God's mouth,
[38:11] it cannot just come back empty. Whatever
[38:13] God say about life, you it has to come
[38:15] back with something. God can't lie. He
[38:19] is faithful to his promise. He is
[38:21] faithful to his word. He has been
[38:24] faithful to you. Whether you recognize
[38:26] it or not whether you agree with it or
[38:29] not, he has been faithful to you. He
[38:32] going to take you off the earth a long
[38:33] time. He going to destroy you a long
[38:35] time because you are in his hands and
[38:38] your days are like numbers to him. Oh,
[38:40] give the Lord some praises. And you
[38:42] cannot pass the boundaries that God have
[38:44] set. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[38:48] Glory to God. For Sarah conceive and
[38:51] bear Abraham a son in his old age at the
[38:53] set time. At the set time. She couldn't
[38:57] bring him forth before time. God have a
[38:59] time for everything. A time to be born.
[39:01] A time to die. A time to shout. A time
[39:03] to cry. There's a time for everything. A
[39:06] time for you to get your breakthrough. A
[39:08] time for you to get your healing. A time
[39:09] to get to get your deliverance. A time
[39:11] for you to get your victory. A time for
[39:13] them devils to come on to you. They're
[39:15] everything on a set time. Oh, give the
[39:17] Lord a shout in the house. Glory to God.
[39:20] Hallelujah. Tell them the light has
[39:23] come. Tell them deliverance has come.
[39:25] Tell them the Messiah is on earth now.
[39:28] Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[39:30] This is time for the manifestation.
[39:32] Oh, we God of God and the sons of God.
[39:35] Oh, glory to God. Because God have to
[39:37] visit you. God will visit you. Jesus
[39:40] said it this way. I will not leave you
[39:41] comfortless. I will come to you. A
[39:44] little while they won't see it me no
[39:45] more. But you are going to see me and
[39:47] because I live you shall also. There's a
[39:49] promise hanging over you that God going
[39:51] to come to you in your condition. Yes.
[39:54] In your despair. Yes. Am I miss your
[39:56] tears? Yes. Am I miss your depression?
[39:59] Yes. What can the Lord shall pray? He
[40:00] going to come to you.
[40:08] And the scripture read Joshua their fame
[40:10] not ought any good thing which the Lord
[40:12] had spoken unto the house of Israel all
[40:15] came to pass.
[40:18] Hallelujah. Because God is faithful to
[40:20] his word. And you know
[40:23] says that if a man put away the presence
[40:25] of God, he could cuss, he could lie, he
[40:27] could do whatever he want because like
[40:29] God is not dead. He not seen me. You're
[40:32] walking like a blind bat. You're walking
[40:34] like if God not if God is dead or
[40:36] something. He's alive. Amen. When you
[40:38] consider he is God, then you have to
[40:41] watch your words. You have to watch your
[40:44] behavior. You have to watch your
[40:45] conduct.
[40:47] He's God in your smoking. He's gone.
[40:49] You're drinking your dog. You're
[40:50] partying. He's gone. You're doing
[40:51] whatever you want to do. He is God. No.
[40:56] And don't don't listen know what I'm
[40:57] talking about. You know, in the Bible,
[40:59] these children of Israel, they getting
[41:01] licks, they're getting beat, they're
[41:02] getting old bread, they're getting less
[41:04] food under Pharaoh and anointing. God
[41:06] come and deliver them a mighty hand of
[41:08] God. They had nothing to do with it
[41:11] because their fathers was in bondage.
[41:12] Their father father was in bondage. They
[41:14] were hearing stories at deliver coming.
[41:16] I deliver coming. Their grandfather
[41:17] didn't see it. Their grandfather didn't
[41:19] see it. The father didn't see it. But
[41:20] they were seeing it. A man with a long
[41:22] beard with a stick come down and say,
[41:24] "Come, come out, let my people go." And
[41:26] they following that man Moses. When he
[41:29] bring them to the mountain, they see red
[41:30] sea open. They see plagues. They see
[41:32] flies. They see frogs. They see
[41:33] everything else. When the Red Sea open
[41:35] up and they walk through on dry land
[41:38] glory hallelujah dancing
[41:41] and marine special start to create they
[41:43] start to get songs and all kind of
[41:44] specials start to come. They see all of
[41:46] that. They walk on dry ground. They see
[41:49] pharaoh army come now behind them. They
[41:51] see the water closed back up. They see
[41:53] all their sins, all their past drowning
[41:55] in the sea of forgetfulness.
[41:58] Finish no more. Hallelujah. And they
[42:00] came to the mount of God. Moses say hold
[42:03] on. Amen. Are going up to come back
[42:05] down. I ain't going up the dead.
[42:09] I ain't going to commit suicide. I ain't
[42:12] going to forsake you. Are going up to
[42:13] get the words of God to come down to
[42:15] tell you what God is talking, what God
[42:18] is saying. And between him going up and
[42:21] coming down, they're partying, the
[42:23] dancing, to build a golden calf. They
[42:25] are just humans, right? Just like you
[42:27] and I. Amen. Just to wait until the man
[42:32] of God come to what God give him. Amen.
[42:35] They bing and dancing. They're back in
[42:37] the flesh. They forget about Egypt. They
[42:39] forget about the They're free now.
[42:41] They're free to sin.
[42:43] They're free to flirt. They're free to
[42:45] lust. They're free to do whatever they
[42:47] want to do.
[42:51] And when God came down, the same people
[42:53] he called out, he killed them.
[42:56] He judged them. Don't be afraid that God
[43:00] is afraid to judge you. I don't care
[43:02] whose son you are, who daughter you are,
[43:05] who husband you are, or who wife you
[43:07] are. Don't be with God.
[43:12] Whatever he said that he will do, the
[43:15] blessings and the cursings, the
[43:17] blessings and the judgment, whatever God
[43:19] said he going to do, he said in
[43:21] blessing, I will bless thee and multiply
[43:24] and multiply thee and thy seed shall
[43:26] possess the case of the enemy.
[43:33] When that mountain start to rumble,
[43:36] I start to shake. That's right. I saw
[43:39] earthquake hit Philippines. We see
[43:41] people around us in the streets. I want
[43:43] to get some of them clips and play back
[43:45] for the church. You know, I want to get
[43:46] some clips of the bombs falling in Iran
[43:48] and in Israel and show you what people
[43:50] had to go through. You know, we sit here
[43:52] like if nothing is happening. You fit
[43:54] here as if your own world, if your own
[43:56] cocoon and your bubble is everything
[43:58] that you know and a whole lot of things
[44:00] taking place because God is God. He's
[44:03] God of the ant and he's God of his
[44:05] people. The smallest thing you could
[44:06] think about, he's God of that, too. He
[44:08] He let He let the birds get food. You
[44:10] get the all the animals get food. You
[44:11] get you get food. He said consider the
[44:13] leaves. You're worrying about it and
[44:15] worrying about that. You're stressing
[44:16] about it. You're stressing about that.
[44:18] Why?
[44:19] [Applause]
[44:24] First Corinthians.
[44:26] I think I want to go in the scripture.
[44:28] Hallelujah.
[44:31] Hallelujah.
[44:35] Right on. I ride in. I ride in. I ride
[44:36] in.
[44:41] Exodus chapter 21. Don't know if I'm
[44:43] going to read. I'm going read this.
[44:46] Exodus.
[44:48] No, no. Uh, no. Exodus 25. Rather, let
[44:51] me get a scripture here.
[44:54] I want to show you
[44:57] how detailed
[45:02] Exodus 25:31.
[45:05] I want to show how detailed God is. This
[45:09] is God giving Moses instructions to make
[45:10] the golden candlesticks. Exodus chapter
[45:13] 25 verse 31. And thou shalt make a
[45:15] candlestick of pure gold
[45:18] of beaten work shall be the candlestick
[45:21] be made. His shaft, his branches, his
[45:24] bowls, his kn shall be of the same.
[45:31] Don't improvise. I remember a time we
[45:34] give somebody to paint the cloud for us.
[45:36] And when I some painter remember Bard
[45:38] Thompson and when I come know what is
[45:41] that she painting there I said you know
[45:43] what we going to do almonds in the other
[45:45] branch with a knop and a flower. So in
[45:48] the six branches that come out of the
[45:50] candlesticks and in the can of six shall
[45:52] be four bowls made like unto almonds
[45:54] with their kns and their flowers. There
[45:56] shall be a knop under two branches of
[45:57] the same a under two branch of the same.
[46:00] A n under two branches of the same.
[46:02] according to the six branches. He's
[46:04] specific.
[46:06] Branch by branch. I want two of that
[46:07] there. I want two of that there. I want
[46:10] two of that there.
[46:12] Let's skip down to verse uh 37. And thou
[46:15] shall make the seven lamps thereof, and
[46:18] they shall light the lamps thereof, that
[46:20] they may give light over against it, and
[46:22] the tongues thereof, and the snuff
[46:24] dishes thereof be of pure gold. Of a
[46:27] talent of pure gold shall he make it,
[46:29] and all these vessels. Amen. Amen. And
[46:32] look that thou make them after their
[46:36] pattern which was showed thee in the
[46:38] mount. Amen. So God show him what it
[46:41] looked like. He said, "Come down and
[46:43] make that." And Moses did it exactly how
[46:46] he wanted it, Noah got specifications,
[46:50] not fificications. I know that's not a
[46:53] word. I just make up that one.
[46:55] Hallelujah. Amen. How much rooms, how
[47:00] much levels, the specifications, the
[47:02] kind of wood to buy that I feeling. I
[47:04] want I want oak, mahogany. I want
[47:07] mahogany. I want teak.
[47:09] He can't put his interpretation to what
[47:12] God said. God tell him the type of word
[47:15] which was questionable because how soft
[47:17] the wood is. Because God had a further
[47:19] revelation coming that that word had to
[47:22] be sealed inside and out to make it
[47:24] waterproof and a hard word can't get the
[47:27] absorption to pull in all that tan
[47:29] whatever it is the best word for that is
[47:32] go forward a soft word so if you ask no
[47:34] how we get about your joker what go sink
[47:39] but Noah wasn't following man he was
[47:41] following God you have to come to a
[47:44] place you know you're not following a
[47:45] man you're following God you're not
[47:48] follow another church member who is a
[47:50] slacker. Come on, give the Lord a shout.
[47:53] You never not follow another church
[47:55] member who bent up, who twisted or
[47:57] perverted. You're following God. He said
[48:01] get go forward. Build it this cubit,
[48:04] this length, this height, this width and
[48:07] Noah did it.
[48:09] The Bible said, "Oh my goodness, we have
[48:13] somewhere.
[48:16] [Music]
[48:18] Oh, glory to God.
[48:23] Glory to God.
[48:26] Have it somewhere. I I get it where God
[48:28] said um
[48:32] that
[48:36] when Noah did it exactly as God said.
[48:38] Oh, praise. Thus, okay, that's is it.
[48:41] Noah, Moses couldn't improvise. Noah
[48:43] couldn't improvise. Genesis 222 6:22
[48:46] says thus did Noah according to all that
[48:50] God commanded him so did he
[48:55] man's improvisation least a judgment
[48:58] when the ark almost fell a nice brother
[49:02] precious brother went to hold it because
[49:04] it was to tilt he hold it he died on the
[49:07] spot
[49:11] the ark coming back was one way you know
[49:13] that is what God wanted, but it's how.
[49:16] And we preach on that last Wednesday.
[49:18] It's not what you do or what you go
[49:20] through, it's how
[49:22] [Applause]
[49:26] a lot of people doing things, but
[49:28] they're not doing it how. How God wanted
[49:31] it.
[49:35] Amen.
[49:40] So, good intentions is not God's way.
[49:41] Amen.
[49:43] Good intention is not God's will.
[49:46] We must not only know what God wants
[49:49] done but how he wants it done. The how
[49:54] part is critical.
[49:57] Now after hearing the service on
[49:58] Wednesday night about not what go you go
[50:00] through but but how you go through but
[50:02] Joseph William shared something with me
[50:04] about SOP and that is what they use on
[50:07] highly technical jobs and and and
[50:10] factories and so on. something called
[50:12] standard
[50:14] operating procedures.
[50:16] And these standard operating procedures
[50:19] are documented processes that ensure
[50:23] task are performed consistently,
[50:27] efficiently, and correctly.
[50:30] It's what you do. Turn on that valve,
[50:32] turn it off, put it on, whatever it is.
[50:34] Because you see, people could get hurt.
[50:36] Things could explode. You can't just
[50:38] say, "How you feeling things today?" You
[50:40] know,
[50:41] are feeling led.
[50:44] They have a list, a documented list,
[50:50] that told them the order of how things
[50:52] are to be done. How it is to be done,
[50:56] why it has to be done because it
[50:58] protecting people, the factory and
[51:00] workers and so like that. Isn't that
[51:02] right? So therefore, Jesus said, "Not my
[51:04] will but thy will be done." We need to
[51:05] get God's will into our lives. Amen.
[51:09] Amen. Now watch this here. Now Leviticus
[51:11] chapter 10.
[51:13] And Nab, Nadab and Alihoo, the sons of
[51:18] Aaron, this is the priest. Now, the
[51:20] priest sons, took either of them his
[51:22] sensor, and put fire therein, and put
[51:26] incense thereon, and offered strange
[51:28] fire before the Lord, which he commanded
[51:30] them not. And they went out fire from
[51:33] the Lord, and devoured them, and they
[51:36] died before the Lord. This is the priest
[51:39] sons, you know. They feel so
[51:41] comfortable. They took things for
[51:43] granted that didn't figure they could
[51:44] just offer incense, any kind of incense.
[51:47] Just do your thing. You see, he's just
[51:48] coming to church like routine. Stay
[51:51] home.
[51:56] Don't come here and get stressed.
[52:00] Don't come here and get fighting because
[52:02] we will fight you back.
[52:05] Come here because you want deliverance.
[52:07] You want a breakthrough. You want to
[52:09] catch the mind of God. You want to get a
[52:11] inspiration. Glory to God. Friday prayer
[52:14] meeting is these all these things we
[52:16] share is important stuff.
[52:19] Inspiration boost you. But that's not
[52:21] going to keep you. You get fired up. But
[52:24] you have to get some level of
[52:25] consistency in your attitude, in your
[52:27] behavior. In other words, in your
[52:29] discipline.
[52:32] [Music]
[52:35] Sometime ago I said you check the people
[52:37] out who don't like to respond and don't
[52:39] like to take correction and rebuke. They
[52:40] are undisiplined.
[52:44] They don't have a disciplined life.
[52:45] Amen. So when they say do because they
[52:47] want to do it when how they want when
[52:50] they want. They want a freedom with no
[52:53] accountability.
[52:55] And I'm working on something on
[52:56] accountability. Some we going to preach
[52:57] on that.
[52:59] No accountability. They do your own
[53:01] thing and people have to accept you like
[53:02] you. Who says so?
[53:05] God say he told them what to do. These
[53:09] two guys went and do their own thing and
[53:11] God judge them instantly.
[53:13] And Moses said unto Aaron, this is it
[53:15] that the Lord spake, saying, I will be
[53:17] sanctified in them that come nigh me,
[53:21] and before all people I will be
[53:23] glorified. And the Bible said, and Aaron
[53:25] held his peace. Aaron can't say nothing.
[53:27] That's his sons.
[53:30] So I prefer
[53:33] for you to get angry with me than God
[53:36] get angry with me.
[53:40] I prefer you get vexed with me and you
[53:43] could think whatever you want about me
[53:45] than God is angry with me.
[53:52] You shall know the truth
[53:55] and the truth shall set you free. Amen.
[53:58] I know there are some ministers get
[53:59] problem with what I preach because they
[54:01] find that a jamming jamming jamming.
[54:03] They want they want me to tell people
[54:04] you're the bride, you're the best. When
[54:06] when when God see you, he smiling. He
[54:08] click your wink.
[54:10] But is that true?
[54:16] Blessed is the man that walketh not in
[54:18] the counsel of the ungodly.
[54:21] nor make a stumbling block by your
[54:22] behaving attitude. Nor stand in the way
[54:24] of sinners. Nor sit in the seat of this
[54:26] scornful taking crap from all kind of
[54:29] friends and family.
[54:31] You can't fellowship in church
[54:32] fellowship outside with unbelievers. You
[54:34] have no friends in the church but your
[54:35] friends outside.
[54:38] This man shall be like a tree. Who said
[54:41] that? God said that. God can't lie. God
[54:44] could take you and plant you and water
[54:47] you and bless you and spread you. God
[54:52] could do that. And what God bless no man
[54:54] could curse.
[54:57] [Applause]
[54:58] Glory to God. You don't wear a jersey. I
[55:00] am blessed.
[55:03] You don't have to do that. Put a print
[55:04] in front and be print behind. No. People
[55:07] will see David said my cup. Run it over.
[55:12] David wasn't pouring it his own cup.
[55:14] God was pointing to David's cup. He
[55:16] said, "My cup runth over. Surely
[55:19] goodness and shall follow me all the
[55:20] days of my life." Oh, praise the name of
[55:23] the Lord. Let's continue. Now, we know
[55:26] that Saul with his partial obedience to
[55:29] God,
[55:31] he paid a price for that. Go tell him
[55:33] kill everything. And Saul, you know, you
[55:35] we know the story. All right. Now God
[55:39] give Moses the exact way how to build
[55:43] the lampstand, seven lampstands. He gave
[55:45] him the exact how to build the the table
[55:48] of shoebre, how to build the temple.
[55:50] Everything was by vision and
[55:52] inspiration. God even anointed the men
[55:54] with arts and craft and how and to do
[55:57] this and to do that anointed them
[55:59] because God wanted to reflect on earth
[56:01] what he had in heaven.
[56:04] And your life ought to be reflection of
[56:06] where you come from.
[56:07] [Music]
[56:10] Come on. You should want this.
[56:12] You should love this.
[56:14] [Applause]
[56:17] All right.
[56:20] Matthew 15:8-9 Jesus speaks, "This
[56:23] people draw nigh unto me with their
[56:24] mouth and honoreth me with their lips,
[56:28] but their heart is far from me." And
[56:30] then he uses words, "In vain do they
[56:33] worship me, teaching for doctrines the
[56:35] commandments of men." Why? describing
[56:37] Pharisees end up ritualizing or moving
[56:39] in ritual form to what they were doing.
[56:40] They were just concerned about with the
[56:42] gong gong and the tall hats and all them
[56:44] fancy clothes they had on. They were
[56:45] just controlling how people see them and
[56:47] everything else. Ritual, no sincerity.
[56:50] But around dramatizing and said they
[56:51] used to tell people offer up a lamb for
[56:53] me. Amen. You supposed to go to the
[56:55] temple, put your lamp, put your hand on
[56:57] it, and when they kill it, you identify
[56:59] as the life leaves the lamb. You know it
[57:01] was supposed to be you.
[57:03] Did you get that? Amen. That death of
[57:06] the animal was supposed to be you. You
[57:08] know the lamb was taking your place.
[57:10] That's what Christ come to take our
[57:12] place at Calvary before he came that to
[57:15] put lamb and goat and bullock and ox and
[57:17] everything else. And you had to be
[57:19] identified with your sacrifice. After
[57:21] all, offer one for me.
[57:25] Go to church for me. Say a prayer for
[57:26] me. Yeah. Call your slacker. You want to
[57:28] pray for yourself. Yeah. You got to pray
[57:31] for you. But are you praying for
[57:31] yourself? Our prayer should be extension
[57:33] of your prayer.
[57:37] Today falling rituals are not something
[57:41] from the heart from the heart. Brother
[57:43] Brian.
[57:45] Some people get the wrong impression of
[57:46] what the anointing is. Did you think of
[57:49] that? When was the greatest anointing
[57:51] ever gone?
[57:53] The greatest anointing was given to
[57:54] Jesus Christ because he had the sp
[57:56] spirit without measure. So he went in
[57:58] the temple, pick up the scroll and read,
[58:00] "The spirit is upon me, for he had
[58:02] anointed me." Now think, if such an
[58:04] anointing was on him, that has been
[58:06] prophesied 800 years before. He was that
[58:09] type of anointing, the full blessing,
[58:11] the anointing of the Lord was upon him,
[58:13] he would want to run over the building
[58:14] and scream and holler. But the Bible
[58:15] said he laid down the scroll and sat
[58:18] down and precious words proceed out of
[58:20] his mouth. That is what he done under
[58:24] the anointing. Amen. The anointing is
[58:26] not emotions. Amen. The anointing is
[58:29] here we go. Supreme power in control. It
[58:33] is knowing exactly what and how.
[58:39] And that is what is here. What Ram is
[58:42] saying that is what is here. Knowing
[58:45] what and how and that is what is here.
[58:48] Oh, praise God. Let's continue.
[58:51] You know,
[58:53] you are the only Bible that many people
[58:57] will ever read.
[58:59] You Christians,
[59:01] your life is the only Bible that men, a
[59:04] lot of men and women will ever read just
[59:06] the way you act and do. So Christians
[59:09] are supposed to be living an example of
[59:11] what Christ is. And if Christ is in the
[59:14] human heart, then he will certainly live
[59:17] his own life for Christ is in you. and
[59:20] the spirit of Christ in you, you become
[59:22] a new creature.
[59:24] Now, let's look back again now to these
[59:26] disciples. They had no Bible except the
[59:29] Old Testament. They were about to write
[59:31] the New Testament. So, they actually was
[59:34] the living word.
[59:38] Oh, glory to God. Do you get that?
[59:41] Peter, James, John, all these brothers,
[59:43] they were the living word. That was to
[59:45] become the written word. So the books of
[59:48] the book of acts was something that was
[59:50] lived out recorded for us and that
[59:53] becomes the written word of what the
[59:54] Holy Ghost lived out through these men.
[59:57] So your life is destined to become the
[1:00:00] living word. So even if people can't
[1:00:02] read the Bible, they could read you.
[1:00:04] They have to take note you have been
[1:00:06] with Jesus. They could read you not so
[1:00:09] much of your words but of your life. Oh
[1:00:12] give the Lord's praises.
[1:00:14] Some time ago I spoke about a man who
[1:00:17] came to give his life to Christ in a
[1:00:18] church and the pastor asked him what
[1:00:20] sermon did I preach what conviction did
[1:00:23] you get how come you come up because
[1:00:25] you're living wicked he was a terrible
[1:00:27] guy the pastor want to know who what
[1:00:30] sermon was what he said none
[1:00:33] he man said none not one of his sermons
[1:00:36] he said a man on my job living such a
[1:00:39] life I want to be like that man and I
[1:00:42] want and that is the man that influenced
[1:00:45] me to give my life to Jesus Jesus
[1:00:46] Christ. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:00:49] It wasn't some text or some word
[1:00:51] message. It was alive. And that does
[1:00:53] thunder against the devil. That's the
[1:00:56] thunder that shakes that devil. That
[1:00:58] devil is shaking this morning. Glory to
[1:01:01] God. He wasn't expecting this. Neither
[1:01:02] did I. But we are here to hear from God.
[1:01:06] Oh, glory to God. I want this word to be
[1:01:08] inspired to you. I want you to look
[1:01:10] again. Oh, glory to God. I don't want
[1:01:13] you have eyes and you can't see and ears
[1:01:14] that you can't hear. You have to have
[1:01:16] eyes and you have to see it. You have to
[1:01:18] see something. Glory to God. Something
[1:01:20] have to get you out of your rut. Oh,
[1:01:23] glory. Out of your humanistic realm, out
[1:01:25] of the human element, out of the human
[1:01:26] spirit. Something have to bust you out
[1:01:28] of that.
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:33] Let's go. The Holy Spirit was in Luther.
[1:01:36] The Holy Spirit was in Wesley. It is
[1:01:38] God's word being anointed. And the Holy
[1:01:41] Spirit returned to the people of the age
[1:01:43] as they begin to have restoration of the
[1:01:45] gifts. Here we go. Hear the detail of
[1:01:48] that. They found out by yielding
[1:01:51] themselves to God, the Holy Ghost spoke
[1:01:53] in tongues through them. They lay hands
[1:01:56] on the sick and they recovered. They
[1:01:58] danced in the spirit. That was the age
[1:02:00] of the reformation, bringing the church
[1:02:02] back into order. But the last order the
[1:02:04] church was placing the gifts into the
[1:02:06] church. Like Luther placed
[1:02:07] justification. Wesley placed
[1:02:09] sanctification. The penny person placed
[1:02:11] the gifts and William Brandham came to
[1:02:13] place the seven thunders which is the
[1:02:16] only exclusive Bible promise and he
[1:02:19] brought that after the loose ends was
[1:02:22] taken care of. All the past loose ends
[1:02:24] that's not our message. Loose ends is
[1:02:26] not our message. Oh glory to God. We
[1:02:28] have a message. He said your message
[1:02:31] will forun the second coming of Jesus
[1:02:32] Christ. They give the Lord a shout. So
[1:02:35] the Lord himself descend with a shout.
[1:02:39] That shout was seven thunders. That
[1:02:41] shout was seven voices to get up right
[1:02:44] together. In every age, a voice turned
[1:02:46] out and shook that devil. God promising
[1:02:50] seven of that in this last hour to shake
[1:02:53] hell to the very foundation. Oh give the
[1:02:56] Lord a shout. Every devil will be
[1:02:58] defeated. Glory. God will manifest his
[1:03:01] promised word. God is faithful.
[1:03:04] Glory to God. You are going to be rocked
[1:03:07] by the voice of God.
[1:03:10] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:03:14] Prophet said you can't even get
[1:03:15] desperate until you hear from God. You
[1:03:18] sitting here, you hearing a sermon, some
[1:03:19] of you, but you have to actually hear
[1:03:21] the voice of God. What if they speak to
[1:03:23] you?
[1:03:26] And when God speak to you, you could
[1:03:28] never be the same. When God speak to
[1:03:30] you, he speak to you to tell you what
[1:03:32] you must do.
[1:03:35] [Applause]
[1:03:38] God is not an Instagram character. He's
[1:03:40] not coming to pose for nobody.
[1:03:42] He's not coming to impress anybody. The
[1:03:45] anointing come to do a work.
[1:03:48] Jesus said yesterday, the spirit is upon
[1:03:49] me. The spirit is upon me. The spirit is
[1:03:51] upon me. No, he didn't say that. He said
[1:03:53] the spirit is upon me because he had
[1:03:55] anointed me to preach the good to
[1:03:57] tidings to open the eyes of the blind.
[1:03:59] He always the anointed come for work. Oh
[1:04:02] give the Lord a shout. You ain't come
[1:04:04] here to feel anointed. Anybody could
[1:04:06] come that unbelievers Pharisees scribes
[1:04:10] could come inside of here and get
[1:04:11] anointed. It's not that you're looking
[1:04:12] for. You're looking to hear from God
[1:04:15] that speaks to your life, that speaks to
[1:04:18] your behavior, that speaks to your
[1:04:20] attitude
[1:04:22] and your stubbornness
[1:04:25] and your bullheadedness
[1:04:27] and your wayward behavior. Glory to God.
[1:04:30] Give the Lord some praises.
[1:04:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not here for
[1:04:36] you to like me. You don't have to like
[1:04:38] me. Praise God. I'm not your servant.
[1:04:40] I'm his servant. Okay. the Lord. I
[1:04:42] shout, "Praise God. I'm not here to make
[1:04:45] you smile and smile and smile. I'm not
[1:04:46] here for that. Have a word from him this
[1:04:49] morning."
[1:04:50] God's faithfulness is promised. He can't
[1:04:53] lie. He going to bring to pass his
[1:04:56] promised word. There's going to be
[1:04:58] revival in Trinidad. There's going to be
[1:05:00] a revival. There's going to be a seven
[1:05:03] ton of revival. God can't lie. He can't
[1:05:06] say that and mean that. Oh, give the
[1:05:09] Lord some praises.
[1:05:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:05:15] My God. You may be seated. Glory.
[1:05:19] The same God that justify the Lutherans.
[1:05:22] The same God that sanctify the Wesleys.
[1:05:26] The same God that baptized the
[1:05:28] Pentecostals. That same God is here to
[1:05:32] adopt sons and daughters. That same God,
[1:05:35] not a different one, the same one.
[1:05:42] Hallelujah.
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:47] [Applause]
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:53] [Applause]
[1:05:59] Glory
[1:06:01] be.
[1:06:06] The devil had his chance. If you got to
[1:06:09] kill me, shall give me a long time. Too
[1:06:10] late now.
[1:06:17] Nothing can shake us off with this. I
[1:06:20] think I must be walk away. I think
[1:06:22] people don't want no don't longer
[1:06:23] believe that is their business. Have
[1:06:24] nothing to do with that. I heard from
[1:06:25] God.
[1:06:27] [Music]
[1:06:33] Think about it. The Catholic Church
[1:06:36] killed 68 million Christians during the
[1:06:39] dark ages. Jesus prophesied they will
[1:06:42] kill you thinking they're doing God a
[1:06:44] service.
[1:06:46] It was so bad that God had to go in the
[1:06:48] Catholic church and find Martin Luther
[1:06:51] to anoint him with the shall live by
[1:06:54] faith and that he become a Protestant.
[1:06:57] That's how the church begin to pip out
[1:06:59] with justification. But that's not the
[1:07:01] end game. Hallelujah. God is going to
[1:07:04] restore all but the canker worm and the
[1:07:07] caterpill and the locust and the
[1:07:09] pommeorm. He was going to bring back the
[1:07:11] fruit resurrection fruit when in the
[1:07:14] evening time. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:07:18] Hallelujah. The seven churches is the
[1:07:21] life of the grain being unfolded through
[1:07:24] processes to come back to the original
[1:07:27] grain. The original fruit the orange.
[1:07:30] That's why he said if that church put
[1:07:32] forth another original branch, it has to
[1:07:34] produce another original fruit. No demon
[1:07:37] has to tell me otherwise, there's going
[1:07:38] to be the same signs, same wonders, same
[1:07:41] miracles, same power, same omnipotence
[1:07:44] speaking and the miraculous taking
[1:07:46] place.
[1:07:51] Glory.
[1:07:55] Goser
[1:07:57] may be seated. denying Jesus Peter when
[1:08:00] the Holy Ghost filled him and he was
[1:08:02] went and see that man crippled he said
[1:08:04] silver and gold I don't have but what I
[1:08:06] have I could give rise up and walk in
[1:08:10] the name of Jesus he was speaking to
[1:08:12] that crippled spirit he was speaking to
[1:08:14] the demons that was keeping that man in
[1:08:16] that condition and he loosed him from
[1:08:18] that he freed him from that and I am
[1:08:20] telling you you will be freed from the
[1:08:22] condition that you're in and who Solomon
[1:08:25] set free is free indeed the anointing
[1:08:27] going going to come to break every yoke.
[1:08:29] The anointing going to come to heal your
[1:08:30] body, heal your spirit, heal your mind,
[1:08:33] heal your soul. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:08:36] praises.
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:49] [Music]
[1:08:51] Notice
[1:08:53] now is the bright calling. Now is when
[1:08:55] the seven seas have been open. Now when
[1:08:57] the complete thing that reform left has
[1:08:59] to be open only Malachi 4 can do that
[1:09:02] because it takes a revelation straight
[1:09:03] from God to an individual it can't come
[1:09:06] from a group has to come from one man
[1:09:10] notice when priests ministers and so
[1:09:11] forth get their own inspiration and
[1:09:13] truly anointed David was anointed the
[1:09:15] Bible said so but you see he went
[1:09:17] through the wrong resource
[1:09:19] he went to the wrong channel he channel
[1:09:22] his anointing on the wrong side to the
[1:09:25] people that they thought to be capt
[1:09:26] captains and they thought instead of the
[1:09:28] God's holy channel to find out was thus
[1:09:30] sayeth the Lord.
[1:09:32] There are some people doing their own
[1:09:33] thing. Oh, they love their own thing.
[1:09:35] You know why? You're in love with
[1:09:36] yourself. You're in love with your
[1:09:38] thoughts. You don't seek advice for
[1:09:40] nothing. You will say you pray and you
[1:09:42] do this. You pray and you do that. But
[1:09:43] why you think the ministry here for?
[1:09:45] What you think the word is here for? For
[1:09:48] instructions, for corrections, for in
[1:09:50] righteousness. Some people manipulators
[1:09:53] want to manipulate their own children as
[1:09:55] if they own them. Let me wake you up
[1:09:57] this morning. Your children might
[1:09:59] resemble you have your same face that
[1:10:01] splitting image one of you but you don't
[1:10:03] own their spirit and soul you know them
[1:10:05] rascals under the same face looking like
[1:10:07] you you don't know what they become. You
[1:10:08] know all them bandish crooks and robbers
[1:10:11] and thieves somebody nice child they was
[1:10:15] managed well and trying to be help them
[1:10:16] to be good or nice you know but a spirit
[1:10:18] inside of them you know they allow a
[1:10:20] spirit to come upon them you know
[1:10:24] so the manipulators they want to control
[1:10:26] the children do that and don't say that
[1:10:28] and don't and have them how they want to
[1:10:30] have them cook as ever but what you
[1:10:33] don't know is that if you don't get that
[1:10:35] right different demonic influences could
[1:10:38] influence their lives and now you have
[1:10:40] no control. They'll always be a son.
[1:10:42] They'll always be a daughter. But they
[1:10:44] under wickedness.
[1:10:46] They're under perversion. They under
[1:10:48] evil. And you could be responsible and
[1:10:50] charged by God for what you have in your
[1:10:52] own house. Set your house in order. Oh,
[1:10:56] give the Lord some praises.
[1:10:58] Hallelujah. Think right, live right, act
[1:11:02] right, and you'll come out right.
[1:11:07] Hallelujah.
[1:11:10] If a man shaving and your little son see
[1:11:13] him shaving, you know the boys want to
[1:11:15] do what the father do too.
[1:11:17] He had no fear to shave him.
[1:11:21] Watching daddy shaving. If it look sharp
[1:11:24] when you move around, he going to do so.
[1:11:29] So you got to be careful what you are
[1:11:30] displaying because eyes watching you. Oh
[1:11:35] my. Let's continue. So David, he was
[1:11:38] supposed to go to Nathan. David said,
[1:11:40] "Is it right for me to live in house of
[1:11:42] cedar in spirit striking and the ark of
[1:11:45] my God and the tense out there?" He look
[1:11:47] at Natal David and said, "David, do all
[1:11:49] in your heart for God is with you, your
[1:11:51] anointed vessel of God." But being a
[1:11:54] prophet and his mystics, God duly bound
[1:11:55] to his prophet. That night he appeared
[1:11:57] to him, "Go tell my servant David. I
[1:12:01] admire his courage. I love him for he's
[1:12:04] a man after my own heart and I know it's
[1:12:06] time that my act should be that way put
[1:12:08] under something but it ain't the season
[1:12:10] for it to happen.
[1:12:13] This is God telling Nathan to tell David
[1:12:14] that tell him I'll let your son do it
[1:12:17] and I won't let him do it. And here come
[1:12:19] Nathan with thus say the Lord. David the
[1:12:21] great revelation you had it had it was
[1:12:24] as wrong as was to bring the ark up.
[1:12:26] Don't you do it. Don't try it. But God
[1:12:28] said you have a son to do it. There you
[1:12:30] are. Amen. Have anointing. I got a
[1:12:34] dream. I got watch it. David was
[1:12:37] anointed to see that because beforehand
[1:12:40] he could see it. Just as Abraham sought
[1:12:43] for a city on earth, you know, he was
[1:12:44] looking for it because he was going to
[1:12:46] live there someday. Abraham was in that
[1:12:49] city. He went around looking for it. And
[1:12:51] right on the same grounds he looked at
[1:12:53] is where it will return in a millennium.
[1:12:56] And he would live in that city. But
[1:12:59] being a prophet, he was ordained and
[1:13:00] inspired. He know there was a city
[1:13:02] somewhere and he was looking for it. But
[1:13:04] you see, the whole revelation of it was
[1:13:06] hid from him. It wasn't for his age. Are
[1:13:09] you Are you ready? Right there with me.
[1:13:11] Here we go. Everything has to be in its
[1:13:14] season.
[1:13:15] [Music]
[1:13:17] So we could spit and sweat and jump and
[1:13:19] shout. Everything have a season.
[1:13:22] That's God's law. Summer, autumn, win,
[1:13:25] spring, winter is a season. And when
[1:13:27] your season come, no devil could hold
[1:13:29] you back.
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:33] Laugh at me at winter because I have no
[1:13:35] leaves. Laugh at me in the autumn all my
[1:13:37] leaves fall off winter cold are like
[1:13:39] sticks. You see in America we do have
[1:13:41] winter and thing down here but summer
[1:13:42] time is beautiful because you get golden
[1:13:44] brown leaves all different color leaves
[1:13:46] and so on and you move leaves and
[1:13:47] whatnot and the leaves are preparing to
[1:13:49] drop off. So they change from green and
[1:13:51] they change color. It's all beautiful to
[1:13:53] see that that is the autumn the fall
[1:13:55] they call it. The leaves fall off. And
[1:13:57] in winter the streets sound like that.
[1:14:00] Hey, where leave?
[1:14:03] Hey, people mocking you because you
[1:14:06] stand there like that. No leaf, nothing.
[1:14:08] No evidence that you're dead. But come
[1:14:10] springtime
[1:14:12] and you see some little things start to
[1:14:13] pip out. Praise God. Don't let any mock
[1:14:16] you because you going to your autumn
[1:14:17] time or you're going to your winter
[1:14:18] time. All of us go through cycles. You
[1:14:20] go through your autumn, your winter, but
[1:14:22] spring is coming. You have to see
[1:14:24] spring. And that's why God said the Lord
[1:14:26] visit old wrinkle up Sarah as he said
[1:14:29] and she till it she didn't say old and
[1:14:31] wrinkle up she was transformed. Oh give
[1:14:33] the Lord some praises and you are going
[1:14:35] to be transformed. Don't let them
[1:14:37] wrinkles fool you. Oh give the Lord some
[1:14:39] praises.
[1:14:47] My brethren, don't you miss this. My
[1:14:49] sisters, you who want to be woman
[1:14:51] preachers and so forth, don't miss this.
[1:14:52] No matter how much anointing is, you've
[1:14:54] got to get in God's provided position.
[1:14:57] David anointing was all right. But in
[1:14:58] doing it, he got enthused and stepped
[1:15:00] over the boundary line. Oh, with the
[1:15:03] anointing, somebody could step over the
[1:15:05] boundary line. Yes, I didn't know that
[1:15:07] before. Now you know.
[1:15:10] What did he do? He stepped over the
[1:15:12] boundary line. Instead of putting the
[1:15:15] ark in its original position, he carried
[1:15:17] in a new cart and got over the hearts of
[1:15:19] the Levite. And not over the hearts of
[1:15:21] the Levite. It was supposed to be
[1:15:23] carried on the shoulders of Levites
[1:15:25] which is over the heart. The word is not
[1:15:27] in the mind. It is in the heart and a
[1:15:29] new cart represented something new.
[1:15:31] David did there spoke to every
[1:15:33] denomination ever be. God's word will
[1:15:36] not carry by state presptors or bishop
[1:15:38] or message popes. I just add that watch.
[1:15:41] It's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:15:44] the heart of man, not some kind of
[1:15:46] ecclesiastical move. Well, where where
[1:15:48] are we are? We we where is the bride in
[1:15:50] Trinidad? woken up. There's a foolish
[1:15:52] man talking to him. That man is
[1:15:54] uninspired.
[1:15:56] Amen. What it is is the baptism of the
[1:15:59] Holy Ghost in the human heart, not some
[1:16:01] elect ecclesiastical move. The Holy
[1:16:04] Spirit is a treasure of God's love in
[1:16:06] the heart of man and woman to obey. It
[1:16:09] was on the shoulders of his ministers.
[1:16:11] His ministers was the Levites. They put
[1:16:13] it upon the left shoulder and packed
[1:16:15] that art. Oh, bride. The burden. The the
[1:16:17] ministers now they have a burden for how
[1:16:19] many more? You want to get in the
[1:16:20] indomination instead of the burden of
[1:16:22] the word of God. Praise God. Now
[1:16:24] remember Uzziah,
[1:16:26] young king, great man, anointed man. God
[1:16:29] blessed him. Praise God. And what
[1:16:32] happened? The priest tell him don't go
[1:16:33] in. He want to offer sacrifice, putting
[1:16:35] fire and incense and so on. He's a king.
[1:16:37] And they said them shut up. I didn't
[1:16:40] want the arrogance take over. You want
[1:16:42] to put people in their place. You want
[1:16:44] to loose that tongue and get them out
[1:16:47] because you figure his boss.
[1:16:50] You know what God did? Strike him with
[1:16:52] leprosy. You pastor should never tell a
[1:16:54] prophet what to do or evangelist tell a
[1:16:56] pastor. Each one has his office
[1:16:58] perfectly identified. He went in with
[1:17:00] the fire and was stricken with lep
[1:17:01] leprosy. God say, "Oh, he's a king. I
[1:17:03] can't touch him anyway because he's a
[1:17:04] king.
[1:17:07] I can't catch him because he's son."
[1:17:11] Really?
[1:17:16] Here David trying to do the same thing.
[1:17:19] He taking it upon himself. Well, that's
[1:17:20] fine. What do you say, Captain? You have
[1:17:23] 10,000. Glory to God. David, I feel the
[1:17:25] spirit. What do you think, David? You
[1:17:27] feel it? Glory to God. It's all over me.
[1:17:30] Who should we consult? Amen. Captains of
[1:17:33] hundreds. All the say, "Glory to God."
[1:17:35] He had the backing them up. They
[1:17:36] clapped. Yes, Lord. They shouted. They
[1:17:38] danced. Jump up and down. They had the
[1:17:41] spirit. But what do you think father was
[1:17:43] thinking? See,
[1:17:46] when we doing our thing, we have to
[1:17:48] think sometime what does God think? How
[1:17:51] does God see this? You want to do this,
[1:17:53] you want to go here, you want to act
[1:17:55] this way, but how does God see this?
[1:18:00] Hallelujah.
[1:18:02] God's original plan. And we know what
[1:18:05] happened to that, right? I'll skip down.
[1:18:07] No matter how sincere a man may be, no
[1:18:10] matter how great he's used of God and I
[1:18:14] preach about it, people thinking that
[1:18:16] it's permanent man talking about 20
[1:18:18] years ago they made the pillar of heart.
[1:18:19] 20 years ago angels spoke to them. 20
[1:18:20] years ago this happened 15 years ago
[1:18:22] what happening now because Jesus Christ
[1:18:24] same yesterday forever you know because
[1:18:26] man does be contact with God and then
[1:18:27] lose that contact you know
[1:18:31] the phone line cut you know but they
[1:18:33] have a history they have a reputation
[1:18:36] but you see the thing about it is not
[1:18:38] reputation reputation what people think
[1:18:40] about you correct is what you are
[1:18:44] and your character could stand anywhere
[1:18:46] anytime that's why I say to be lying you
[1:18:48] have to make more lies to cover the
[1:18:49] first lie And the second lie and the
[1:18:51] third lie you have to do all kind of
[1:18:52] things fasting with the lie. The truth
[1:18:53] whether it curse you or not is the same.
[1:18:56] You have no issue be truth it can come
[1:18:58] out automatically. When you see a lie
[1:19:00] you have to pause. You had to wait. You
[1:19:03] had to think because you don't know what
[1:19:05] you say before. You try to remember.
[1:19:06] That's a lot of hard work.
[1:19:09] I can't handle that. You know
[1:19:11] that's plenty hard work boys. Say man
[1:19:14] was not made to lie. Even if it's
[1:19:16] against you speak the truth.
[1:19:20] Who thief the wallet?
[1:19:28] We go bring the cameras.
[1:19:32] No, I say anything here.
[1:19:36] What I'm saying then the Bible teaches
[1:19:39] to the saints. He was saying put away
[1:19:40] lying. What does that tell you? It lies
[1:19:42] in the church. Put away anger. It have
[1:19:45] temper in the church. Put away this. Put
[1:19:48] away that. It have that in the church.
[1:19:50] Who are you?
[1:19:53] We see your form. We see your tie. We
[1:19:57] see your dress. We see your face. But
[1:19:59] who are you? You are what you are when
[1:20:01] you're by yourself. Who are you?
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:06] Do you answer back your husband? Who are
[1:20:08] you? Or you trying to line yourself up
[1:20:09] with the word because you want to be
[1:20:12] honoring God. Amen.
[1:20:14] You want a Sarah but you not Abraham.
[1:20:17] And Sarah getting problem becoming
[1:20:19] Sarah.
[1:20:24] The brothers want to say amen.
[1:20:27] You preaching the word.
[1:20:29] All right. So watch this now. It must be
[1:20:31] according to the scripture. It must be
[1:20:35] in season. You talking about there must
[1:20:38] it must be according to the way God
[1:20:40] spoke it would be. Yes. All these things
[1:20:42] are part of the package of God's plan
[1:20:44] and program being unfolded. You say,
[1:20:46] "Glory to God. The Holy Ghost fell on
[1:20:48] me." Hallelujah. Just like it did in
[1:20:50] Pentecost. But that might be different
[1:20:51] today. It fell on David, too, didn't it?
[1:20:53] It fell on Uzziah, but it was wrong. You
[1:20:55] got to go deeper than that. Now, you got
[1:20:57] to go deeper than that. I don't want to
[1:20:58] hurt your feeling. Just be reverent.
[1:21:00] Notice it also must come to the man of
[1:21:02] God's choosing. Yes, sir. Not a
[1:21:04] denominational choosing, not of the
[1:21:06] people choosing, but according to God's
[1:21:08] choosing. Like, I want to ask a
[1:21:10] question. They sent for Peter because
[1:21:12] they didn't receive the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:21:14] They sent for Peter and Peter to come
[1:21:16] and then they the Holy Ghost was poured
[1:21:18] out. Cornelius sent for Peter and when
[1:21:20] Peter spake the word, Holy Ghost fell
[1:21:22] upon them. Will that repeat? But Ram
[1:21:24] said Peter had the full body germ. He
[1:21:26] said as my father sent me, so send you.
[1:21:28] He talk about sent one. God filled men.
[1:21:32] Not men ruling over men. You know, God
[1:21:34] sent men. Those men went, they were sent
[1:21:38] by the Holy Ghost. Jesus said, "As my
[1:21:41] father sent me," that's how that's
[1:21:43] that's the how part. So send are you.
[1:21:45] How did the father send Jesus? The
[1:21:47] father was in Jesus. Oh, give the Lord
[1:21:50] some praises. Not send them out with
[1:21:52] books and tapes. Send them as my father
[1:21:54] sent me. So send you. So I'm sending you
[1:21:58] with power. I'm sending you with
[1:21:59] confirmation. I'm sending you with
[1:22:01] vindication. I'm sending you with the
[1:22:03] anointing. I'm sending you to let all
[1:22:05] man know I am with you. And the Bible
[1:22:08] said the Lord himself went everywhere
[1:22:11] with them. Come on, give a shout in the
[1:22:13] house. Confirming the word with signs
[1:22:17] following everywhere they going. The
[1:22:20] Lord was going with them. Oh, give the
[1:22:22] Lord a shout in the house. If they go in
[1:22:24] the supermarket, if they go in the bus,
[1:22:26] if they go among their friends, if they
[1:22:28] go among the family, the Lord was with
[1:22:30] them. Don't you want that? The Lord to
[1:22:32] be with you. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:22:35] in the house.
[1:22:40] Be seated. There are five things it must
[1:22:43] be. It must be in season. It must be at
[1:22:46] the time God said it would be. It must
[1:22:48] be written in the word of God. So, we
[1:22:50] see is written in the word. They have no
[1:22:52] revival yet. It will take them seven
[1:22:54] thunders to wake up that bride. I could
[1:22:56] I could stand on that because I could
[1:22:58] find that in the word and I could say
[1:23:00] God promise it. He said the people would
[1:23:02] forget their creeds and keep the
[1:23:04] promises. We could say God, you promise
[1:23:05] us I'm going to revival. Didn't you say
[1:23:08] that you're the prophet? God, you can't
[1:23:10] lie. God, you're not a man. You promised
[1:23:13] a super church. You told the prophet
[1:23:16] repent, right? And he wrote, "There will
[1:23:18] be a super church, a super race." As we
[1:23:21] near the headphone, God make it come to
[1:23:25] pass. You can't lie. You are faithful to
[1:23:28] your promise and I am being your promise
[1:23:31] this morning.
[1:23:36] [Applause]
[1:23:37] [Music]
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:41] And you can take any promise. By stripes
[1:23:44] I'm healed. God, you said that. You said
[1:23:46] by stripes I'm healed. I claim my
[1:23:48] husband's healing. I claim my daughter
[1:23:50] healing. I claim my wife healing. You
[1:23:53] said that you can't lie. You are a
[1:23:55] healer. You said they shall lay hands
[1:23:58] upon the sick. It didn't say the
[1:24:00] preacher have to lay hands. You could
[1:24:01] lay hands and they shall recall. Give
[1:24:04] the Lord some praises.
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:10] Challenge God.
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Challenge him
[1:24:16] with his promises. He loves that.
[1:24:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He loves that.
[1:24:22] that when he come from Moses he said I
[1:24:23] have heard the cries of my people or all
[1:24:26] the people crying he talking about them
[1:24:28] crying he said my people and I come down
[1:24:31] to deliver any time God come now he come
[1:24:33] to do something you know he come to peep
[1:24:35] at you and go back he's come down to
[1:24:37] deliver any time God come down he's come
[1:24:39] down to deliver you my people always

[1:24:43] and bonging that but God want to free
[1:24:45] you he don't like your bong he don't
[1:24:48] want you in a cage he don't want you in
[1:24:50] a prison praise God One time brother had
[1:24:52] a vision of some young men in some kind
[1:24:55] of prison and they said there are bad
[1:24:57] people and some voice said there's good
[1:24:59] people they just b he said free them he
[1:25:04] said free them he said God look I weak I
[1:25:06] small all of a sudden he said house of
[1:25:08] hell give way to the name of Jesus
[1:25:12] Christ and the bars have to pop and
[1:25:14] break out oh God help us in morning
[1:25:17] there are some that are bound nice
[1:25:19] brothers nice sisters
[1:25:22] Nice people, but they b. But we say this
[1:25:25] morning, house of hell, give way to the
[1:25:29] name of Jesus Christ. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:25:36] Glory to God. Let's continue. Praise
[1:25:40] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:25:44] Praise God. Get this one. He said all
[1:25:47] through the day Jesus bringing he's been
[1:25:50] bringing the wood with no signs when he
[1:25:52] got them inside and shut the door sat
[1:25:54] down brother when he revealed his
[1:25:56] resurrection no time from the morning
[1:25:58] when he met them until the going of the
[1:26:00] sun did he do it he was walking with
[1:26:02] them and he wrote to meas isn't that
[1:26:04] right and he walked as if he passed them
[1:26:06] and invited him and in the evening time
[1:26:08] he begin to talk to them is that right
[1:26:11] and no time from the morning when he met
[1:26:13] them until the going down of the sun did
[1:26:14] he do it he never did one time he did in
[1:26:17] his life only just the word. But notice
[1:26:20] at the evening time is when he proved
[1:26:22] his resurrection. Hear the bomb. Now let
[1:26:25] me say this with humility. Let me say
[1:26:27] this with a broken voice and a broken
[1:26:29] heart too. It is evening time. The Bible
[1:26:32] said there shall be light in the evening
[1:26:34] time. There will be a day. Here we go.
[1:26:35] Listen to these words. There will be a
[1:26:37] day that it won't be neither night or
[1:26:40] day. The prophet said it will be just
[1:26:43] hearing the word with no manifestation.
[1:26:51] Did you hear that?
[1:26:53] I read it again. There will be a day
[1:26:56] that it won't be neither night nor day.
[1:26:58] The prophet said it will be just hearing
[1:27:00] the word with no manifestation. Just a
[1:27:04] gloomy foggy day. But in the evening
[1:27:08] time, the light will shine again. And
[1:27:11] this evening time we are living,
[1:27:13] ministers have preached God for 2,000
[1:27:15] years. But this is the evening light.
[1:27:17] The evening light was the manifestation
[1:27:19] of the resurrection. When they didn't
[1:27:22] know he had raised from the dead,
[1:27:23] although they loved him, they believed
[1:27:25] him, they didn't know he raised raised
[1:27:27] from the dead. In other words, they had
[1:27:29] the books, they had the tapes, but they
[1:27:31] don't know that God is alive. Watch.
[1:27:33] They argue against it. But now here in
[1:27:35] the evening time, he's going to reveal
[1:27:37] himself that he is raised from the dead.
[1:27:40] How did he do it? Not by preaching the
[1:27:43] word. He already did that. And they
[1:27:45] still didn't believe, brother Kangi. But
[1:27:47] 2,000 years of preaching the word, the
[1:27:49] church still don't believe. But the
[1:27:51] evening light has come. The
[1:27:53] manifestation of the resurrection.
[1:27:56] He taken them in. He performed miracle
[1:27:58] and he just vanished quickly from them.
[1:28:01] Notice it was a short message. It wasn't
[1:28:03] very long. He didn't stay long with
[1:28:05] them. He just manifested himself and
[1:28:07] vanished out of their sight. And then
[1:28:10] they knew it was him. Oh, give the Lord
[1:28:12] some praises. Hallelujah. And if Jesus
[1:28:16] promising the Bible that he's the same
[1:28:18] yesterday, today, and forever, watch
[1:28:20] down through the years. We have had all
[1:28:22] the scripture teachings, but this is the
[1:28:24] day for the manifestation for the
[1:28:26] manifestation of the resurrection. And
[1:28:28] I'm identifying that this morning. This
[1:28:30] is the day for the manifestation. Oh,
[1:28:33] praise God. Praise God. And he then he
[1:28:35] said Daniel and watch he said watch but
[1:28:39] Daniel heard him seven thunders. They
[1:28:41] uttered their voices. Daniel grabbed his
[1:28:42] pen and started to write. Don't you
[1:28:44] write it. Don't you write it. Here's the
[1:28:46] Bible written which is a mystery itself.
[1:28:48] But in the backside of the Bible, the
[1:28:50] revelation was shown to Daniel. He says
[1:28:52] there are seven voices to be uttered
[1:28:54] that no man could open. what the Bible
[1:28:56] said and told God told Daniel that in
[1:28:59] the last days these seven voices would
[1:29:03] be known to the real true church. Can't
[1:29:06] you see where the force and counterfeit
[1:29:08] is trying to keep their best to keep
[1:29:09] great men from places like that? They
[1:29:11] don't want you going to thunders. But he
[1:29:13] said the three those seven voices will
[1:29:15] be known to the true church. Here we go.
[1:29:17] As Daniel heard the seven thunders and
[1:29:20] forbidden to write. Watch. He said and
[1:29:22] John heard the voices. This book was
[1:29:24] sealed and with seven seals, but the
[1:29:26] days of these seals will be open. The
[1:29:28] mystery of God would be finished. In
[1:29:30] other words, God would be known to his
[1:29:32] church not in three people, but as one
[1:29:35] person, the mystery of God will reveal.
[1:29:38] And when that was completely revealed,
[1:29:41] in other words, the time of the
[1:29:42] revelation of these things being made
[1:29:44] known, there's a time for that. All
[1:29:46] revelation be made known. when it was
[1:29:48] completely revealed then the seven
[1:29:51] mysteries he's talking about them seven
[1:29:53] thunders would open to the church
[1:29:55] because in there the church would be
[1:29:58] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:30:00] Spirit not your human spirit not the
[1:30:03] Trinidad spirit not the message spirit
[1:30:06] the Holy Spirit oh living under that in
[1:30:10] there the church should be living under
[1:30:12] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[1:30:14] moving in and out showing his signs
[1:30:17] Not my signs, his signs among us. Oh,
[1:30:21] glory to living among us. Then we are
[1:30:24] worshiping the living Christ that's
[1:30:27] among us. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[1:30:29] the house. You love him this morning.
[1:30:31] Glory to God. I hope the word is
[1:30:33] speaking to your heart this morning.
[1:30:35] What is the Holy Ghost given for? It's
[1:30:37] to give uncction to the preacher. It's
[1:30:39] to give holiness to the group. Is to set
[1:30:42] the church in order. Oh, you mean the
[1:30:44] church will be set in order? Yes. You
[1:30:46] mean you can't do your own thing? Yes.
[1:30:48] You can't just have your own way.
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:55] That's what the Holy Ghost is given for
[1:30:58] to give uncction to the preacher. When
[1:31:00] the preacher have no uncction, he's just
[1:31:01] talking talking.
[1:31:04] No uncction. You're casting your
[1:31:05] uncction upon the man. But the Holy
[1:31:06] Ghost is there to give uncction to the
[1:31:08] preacher. It's to give holiness to the
[1:31:10] group. It's to set the church in order.
[1:31:13] It's to bring the unity of the spirit.
[1:31:17] It's to unite us together with power. It
[1:31:20] is unite us together with love.
[1:31:23] Brotherly love. He say what kind of love
[1:31:25] it is. Before you're going to capstone
[1:31:28] love, you have to get brotherly love.
[1:31:29] That's what the Holy Ghost is given for.
[1:31:31] Oh, give the Lord a shout into the
[1:31:33] house. Is this the word? Hallelujah.
[1:31:37] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is not only
[1:31:39] to open the seals and open the word and
[1:31:41] open the mystery. know is to give
[1:31:43] uncction to the preacher and you will
[1:31:45] see where the preacher have uncction you
[1:31:47] will see where the angels dropping down
[1:31:49] and the man of God have lightning coming
[1:31:51] out of his mouth inspiration coming out
[1:31:53] of his lips you would see that for
[1:31:55] yourself it's to give uncction to the
[1:31:57] preacher it's to give holiness to the
[1:31:59] group it's to set the church in order is
[1:32:01] to bring the unity of the spirit is to
[1:32:03] unite us together with power is unite us
[1:32:05] together with love brother godly love
[1:32:07] glory to God amen glory to God then he
[1:32:11] said there's nothing present Nothing
[1:32:13] future hunger, starvation, nothing can
[1:32:15] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:32:17] in Christ Jesus.
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:22] Glory,
[1:32:24] come up, please. Hallelujah.
[1:32:27] Glory. Give the Lord a shout. Nothing
[1:32:30] going to stop this bride.
[1:32:36] The bride has no revival yet. There will
[1:32:38] be no revival there. No manifestation of
[1:32:42] God to stir the bride. This is the word
[1:32:45] coming out of the prophet's mouth. We
[1:32:47] are looking for it. them preach looking
[1:32:49] for it. We looking for it. Headstone
[1:32:51] Tabernacle looking for it. We're looking
[1:32:53] for this service. We're looking for it
[1:32:54] Wednesday night. We're looking for it
[1:32:56] next Sunday. We're looking for the
[1:32:58] convention. We looking for it. We have a
[1:32:59] right to look for it. He said we're
[1:33:01] looking for it. We want to tell the
[1:33:03] world. We looking for it. Looking for
[1:33:05] what? A Holy Ghost revival, a seven
[1:33:07] thunder revival, a bright revival. He
[1:33:10] said we are looking for it. It will take
[1:33:12] those seven unknown thunders to wake her
[1:33:14] back again. He will send it. He promised
[1:33:18] it. And the Lord visited Sarah as he was
[1:33:21] said. He sent it to Sarah. Oh, give the
[1:33:24] Lord some praises. He sent Sarah.
[1:33:28] That anointing and power that transform
[1:33:30] body to produce Isaac. And if the church
[1:33:34] will forget the creeds and dogmas and
[1:33:35] take the Bible and please the promises,
[1:33:37] it will become effective to them. My
[1:33:40] God. My God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:44] Glory to God. Glory to God. What have
[1:33:47] all kind of sons? Wayward sons, backward
[1:33:49] sons, backst sons, true sons, born sons.
[1:33:53] When that son is acting right, he said
[1:33:54] the father say you're proud of that boy.
[1:33:57] Watch. Here we go. You know what? He
[1:34:00] might not be able to exercise all
[1:34:02] authority.
[1:34:04] He hasn't got it yet. Hallelujah. He is
[1:34:06] still a son. But he hasn't been placed.
[1:34:10] Now you minister know where I'm getting
[1:34:11] at. The placing of a son. If that son
[1:34:14] proved to be the right kind. That's
[1:34:17] that's the key there. Not just any son.
[1:34:20] Top plenty son. There are plenty gifted
[1:34:22] son. Top plenty gifted ministers. You
[1:34:25] know they're genuinely gifted. They go
[1:34:28] God give them a gift but they are not
[1:34:30] the right kind because of the behavior.
[1:34:34] And your behavior is what set you out to
[1:34:36] adoption. Not the sermon, not the
[1:34:40] teaching, not the mysteries. It's the
[1:34:43] behavior. That's why he said this being
[1:34:46] when it's completed is a servant of God
[1:34:48] in the church of God that's going to
[1:34:50] rapture. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:34:53] Judas was there with them casting out
[1:34:55] devils and doing all kind of stuff. But
[1:34:56] Judas himself was a devil. He was
[1:34:58] partaking of the anointing, but he was
[1:35:00] off. He was false. We don't want that.
[1:35:03] Oh give the Lord a shout. Something
[1:35:05] ought to start inside of you and we want
[1:35:07] it to start today. Oh glory today when
[1:35:10] you hear his voice hard not your heart.
[1:35:12] God know all the secrets in your life.
[1:35:15] God all the secret sins that you have
[1:35:17] and God want you free. God want you
[1:35:19] delivered. God want them things come out
[1:35:21] of you. All the anger, hatred, jealousy,
[1:35:24] malice and strife. He cast out seven
[1:35:26] devils out of Mary Magdalene. Seven
[1:35:29] devils that sister had. Oh, give the
[1:35:31] Lord some praises. But she made it to
[1:35:33] the upper room. That's the important
[1:35:35] thing. Don't tell no devil she actually
[1:35:37] she going to make it to the upper room.
[1:35:39] Give the Lord some praises. Glory. Let's
[1:35:42] go. Jesus had proven to God that he had
[1:35:45] been the right kind of a son and God
[1:35:48] took him on a mountain and then he
[1:35:50] talked about adoption for Jesus. Then he
[1:35:51] said he will call you aside church if
[1:35:54] you will only obey him and stay on the
[1:35:57] word. And I believe it he will place
[1:36:00] into the church. He will do that. Not no
[1:36:03] man claiming this. He will do that
[1:36:05] before the coming of Jesus Christ. He
[1:36:08] will place into the church. All the
[1:36:10] powers that Christ had in it will be in
[1:36:11] the church. All that God was, he poured
[1:36:13] into Jesus. All that Jesus was, he
[1:36:15] poured into the church. God wanted his
[1:36:17] work done. He sent it into his son. The
[1:36:19] son wanted the work done. He sent it
[1:36:21] into the church. At that day, you shall
[1:36:23] know that I am in the father, the father
[1:36:24] in me, and I in you. At that day,
[1:36:26] because the same power of God that was
[1:36:28] in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ.
[1:36:31] The same power that rested in Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ rest in placed sons in the body
[1:36:36] of Christ. So God's purpose is not for
[1:36:40] we be like Pentecostals. God purpose is
[1:36:42] that we become placed sons. Then your
[1:36:45] power and faith is because of your
[1:36:47] position. Not the anointing.
[1:36:50] The anointing is a help of faith. But
[1:36:52] the real faith come by who you are. Who
[1:36:56] are you? Oh, glory to God. So Jesus did
[1:36:59] not have to do all kind of fancy antics
[1:37:00] and rock somebody head and shake them,
[1:37:02] shake them, shake them and do all kind
[1:37:03] of fancy thing and scream in their ears.
[1:37:05] He did not do that at all. He said come
[1:37:06] out of him.
[1:37:08] Hallelujah. When they lower the man from
[1:37:11] the roof, the guy, them them as
[1:37:14] real them as real people that really
[1:37:15] love them that man and put him
[1:37:17] down to the roof. Jesus said, "What?" He
[1:37:18] said, "I still be forgiven." They
[1:37:20] grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble. He
[1:37:22] said, "Which one is easier?" Tell the
[1:37:23] man to forgive him or pick and walk
[1:37:25] because forgiveness have healing in it.
[1:37:27] Amen. So him saying your sin be forgiven
[1:37:29] mean that you are healed. God forgive
[1:37:31] you your sins and healed. You have a
[1:37:33] condition and sometimes it's sin. It's
[1:37:35] unbelief. It's all kind of behavior
[1:37:37] behind there why you are how you are.
[1:37:39] What condition you are in. And when God
[1:37:41] forgive you, he healed you. He said pick
[1:37:43] up the bed and walk. And the man turned
[1:37:44] and pick up his bed and walk. Praise
[1:37:47] God. Get those Sunday school ready.
[1:37:49] Praise God. We're going to have that
[1:37:50] song. Hallelujah. Let go. Let's go.
[1:37:53] Placing a son. Take him out in a certain
[1:37:55] place. Have a ceremony. place him
[1:37:57] positionally what he is in the body of
[1:37:59] Christ then that person has the
[1:38:01] authority then he prophesied let me say
[1:38:03] this if you call me for a fanatic from
[1:38:05] this night on that very same thing I
[1:38:09] will speaking of will be done there will
[1:38:11] be a power
[1:38:14] well punch he didn't say no more text
[1:38:16] and more revelation more mysteries there
[1:38:18] will be a power put into the church and
[1:38:20] now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit
[1:38:22] will so anoint the people
[1:38:25] till they will speak the word and will
[1:38:28] create itself right there. Begin to play
[1:38:30] something. We haven't seen powers like
[1:38:33] commenting with Christ. Now I know it
[1:38:34] for a fact. Say to this mountain be
[1:38:36] moved. Don't doubt in your heart but
[1:38:38] believe that what you said shall come to
[1:38:39] pass and you can have what you said. The
[1:38:42] placing of the church in position where
[1:38:46] the fullness of the power of the Holy
[1:38:47] Ghost comes into the church. Then the
[1:38:50] critics's mouth will be shut. It'll be a
[1:38:52] short time. But Jesus come right off the
[1:38:54] mountain and went straight to Calvary.
[1:38:56] Notice it won't last long, but it will
[1:38:58] be here. Oh, let's all stand our way to
[1:39:00] the Lord right now.

[2:02:57] here this morning
[2:02:59] also for his faithfulness. Everybody see
[2:03:01] that his faithfulness thing. God is
[2:03:04] faithful
[2:03:07] through these years. Also for the good
[2:03:09] time and bad, for his loving kindness
[2:03:11] and tender mercies towards us.
[2:03:15] One more note of praise. And I'm sure
[2:03:17] there are others that didn't get
[2:03:18] written, but we just have one more
[2:03:19] written this morning from Sister Katy
[2:03:22] Nicholas. Thanking God for seeing
[2:03:24] another year. Entering the 40s today is
[2:03:28] really a blessing. I like this part. I
[2:03:31] used to call 40 years old.
[2:03:34] Old people now here I am
[2:03:40] 40. I am 40 today feeling as young as
[2:03:44] ever. Sister KG Nicholas. So we thank
[2:03:46] God.
[2:03:48] God is faithful.
[2:03:50] We didn't come this far to He didn't
[2:03:52] bring us this far to leave us, to lose
[2:03:53] us, to He promised to take us all the
[2:03:55] way through. Can the church say amen?
[2:03:57] Glory.
[2:03:59] We have two prayer requests.
[2:04:03] One from
[2:04:05] brother Steven Oliveri for his daughter
[2:04:07] Gabby with stomach issues and high
[2:04:09] fever.
[2:04:11] From sister Judith Samuel. Blessings, my
[2:04:15] brothers and sisters. Please pray for my
[2:04:17] sister Angela who was diagnosed with
[2:04:19] stage 4 cancer. Also for traveling
[2:04:22] mercies as I prepare to travel to Canada
[2:04:25] on the 5th of July to be with her,
[2:04:26] thanking God for answered prayers. And
[2:04:29] if there's a request this morning that
[2:04:31] you want to show by raising your hands
[2:04:32] as we approach the throne of grace
[2:04:35] together, the word teaches us that if
[2:04:36] two shall agree touching anything, we
[2:04:39] could have what we ask for. And we come
[2:04:40] in agreement this morning as a body of
[2:04:43] believers, as a church of the living
[2:04:45] God, with the full understanding that
[2:04:46] all that was in God, he poured into
[2:04:48] Christ. And all that was in Christ, he
[2:04:50] poured into this church. And by the
[2:04:52] power vested in this church by almighty
[2:04:55] God himself, we could approach the
[2:04:56] throne of God boldly knowing that as
[2:04:59] said, he is faithful to keep his
[2:05:01] promise. So every head bowed, every eye
[2:05:03] closed. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[2:05:05] this morning for your august presence,
[2:05:07] Lord, for your word that has never
[2:05:09] failed. Great is thy faithfulness. Lord,
[2:05:13] we come this morning to bring every
[2:05:14] need, every supplication, every request
[2:05:17] to you, in particular the request for
[2:05:19] Gabby Oliveri even now with Lord that
[2:05:22] stomach issue and the high fever. We
[2:05:24] pray dear God that you not just deal
[2:05:25] with the symptom but the cause of the
[2:05:27] matter. May she be completely healed in
[2:05:30] the mighty name of Jesus Christ from the
[2:05:31] crown of her head to the soles of our
[2:05:33] feet. And may this request come back as
[2:05:35] a note of praise, Father. Lord, we bring
[2:05:38] Sister Judith Samuel, Sister Angela
[2:05:40] before you, Lord. There's nothing that's
[2:05:43] too hard for you to deal with. There's
[2:05:45] no problem that's too difficult. Lord,
[2:05:47] when you came down to speak to Abraham,
[2:05:49] he said, "Is anything hard too hard for
[2:05:51] the Lord?"
[2:05:52] So heavenly father, Lord, we bring this
[2:05:55] case before you, this stage 4 cancer.
[2:05:58] Lord, that the angel of the Lord will
[2:06:00] find her wherever she is right now. That
[2:06:02] you you walk into that room, minister to
[2:06:05] her where she is and touch on the crown
[2:06:07] of her head, to the soles of her feet.
[2:06:09] May the doctors be confounded. May the
[2:06:11] situation be reversed. And Lord, may you
[2:06:14] get glory and honor to your holy name in
[2:06:16] the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Lord,
[2:06:18] we pray and ask for blessing. Lord, we
[2:06:21] pray for Sister Judith, for traveling
[2:06:22] mercies, and for every hand that is
[2:06:24] raised all over the building. We bring
[2:06:26] your people before you. Every need,
[2:06:28] every request, those that are here,
[2:06:30] those that are downstairs, those that
[2:06:31] are on the internet, those that may hear
[2:06:32] the tape, whatever it is, Father, Lord,
[2:06:34] may you touch your people one more time.
[2:06:36] May you heal, may you deliver, may you
[2:06:38] break chains and shackles. We commit
[2:06:41] your people into your hands in the
[2:06:42] mighty name of Jesus Christ. And as we
[2:06:45] prepare to leave this house, but not
[2:06:47] from your presence, Father, may you
[2:06:49] grant traveling mercies. And even as we
[2:06:50] have, oh Lord, a few meetings after the
[2:06:53] service today, Father, we commit it all
[2:06:55] into your hands, Lord. Not for our
[2:06:56] glory, but for your honor, for your
[2:06:59] glory, Father. And the Church of the
[2:07:00] Living God says, and the church says,
[2:07:04] Amen and amen. You may be seated there
[2:07:06] for a few announcements and then after
[2:07:09] these announcements
[2:07:11] I'll ask the technical team to take us
[2:07:15] offline so we could have some
[2:07:16] housekeeping specific to the convention.
[2:07:20] So for our announcements
[2:07:22] to put it on record. Service continues
