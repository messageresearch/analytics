[30:30] also that love his appearing
[30:32] you know last reading
[30:34] revelation 10 7
[30:37] but in the days of the voice of the
[30:39] seven angel when he shall begin to sound
[30:41] a mystery of god should be finished as
[30:45] he had declared to his servants the
[30:46] prophets may the lord have a blessing to
[30:48] the reading of his word you may be
[30:49] seated in the presence of the lord today
[30:51] we are so happy to be able to be here in
[30:54] fellowship and we know what's happening
[30:58] around the world we know what's
[30:59] happening in the country as well and
[31:01] it's it's so much to say about it uh but
[31:04] i'm i don't know how about you but i'm
[31:06] still feasting on the convention you're
[31:07] still feasting on the convention
[31:10] there was so much that was said that you
[31:12] could always just connect back and get
[31:14] some encouragement there and how many
[31:15] appreciate all this message last week
[31:17] sunday the dynamics of that promised
[31:20] wood
[31:21] oh what a tremendous time in the lord
[31:23] and on wednesday night if you missed it
[31:25] you need to get it the letter kill it
[31:28] but the spirit gave it life what a
[31:29] masterpiece on wednesday night put in
[31:32] the spirit in its place in the church
[31:35] because there's so much that people know
[31:37] there's so much knowledge there's so
[31:39] much information but and we'll see it in
[31:41] today's service it has to lead to
[31:44] something it has to produce something it
[31:46] has to do something there's a lot of
[31:48] people who have knowledge and
[31:49] information and could interpret this and
[31:51] interpret that and and we'll see about
[31:53] it has to lead us into a place of action
[31:55] so it has to be the spirit that drives
[31:58] the action it can't just be word only
[32:00] because we know the gospel and not in
[32:01] word only but it is in power and
[32:03] demonstration so are you with me this
[32:05] morning so we see what's happening
[32:07] around us
[32:08] we see
[32:10] new cases coming into the country we
[32:12] knew we see the the news and the people
[32:14] and everything is happening at the same
[32:16] time there's there's in the political
[32:18] realm we have elections coming up on all
[32:20] of a sudden we have these new cases
[32:21] there's economic turmoil everything is
[32:23] building to something and it should not
[32:25] come as a surprise to us but we also
[32:27] have our our part to play we also have
[32:30] our responsibility and we have our
[32:32] responsibility to be ready
[32:34] that is the great responsibility the
[32:37] great responsibility is not measured by
[32:39] attendance in church that has its place
[32:41] but the great responsibility is to be
[32:43] ready
[32:44] because you don't want to pass the grade
[32:45] for attendance and not be ready
[32:47] you don't want to pass the grade for
[32:49] knowing the message and not be ready you
[32:51] don't want to pass the grade for being
[32:52] on fire and not be ready all of these
[32:55] things are important you don't want to
[32:56] pass the grade for praying and not be
[32:58] ready
[32:59] you don't want to pass the grade of
[33:00] being spiritual and not being ready it
[33:03] is important to do these things but make
[33:05] no mistake about it you need to be ready
[33:07] and that's why i read the scripture we
[33:09] have a responsibility to make our
[33:11] calling and election show that is a
[33:13] responsibility it's a daily
[33:15] responsibility when you wake up in the
[33:17] morning it's i gotta be sure
[33:20] i want to be sure i can't afford to take
[33:22] a chance not in this season
[33:24] not in this season when the enemy is
[33:26] moving around not in these seasons when
[33:28] we see plagues on every hand not in this
[33:30] season when the lid of hell is open and
[33:33] streams of demon powers are moving or
[33:35] not in this season i want to be very
[33:38] sore my confidence cannot be based on
[33:41] man my confidence cannot be based on the
[33:43] church i attend my confidence cannot
[33:46] even be based on my understanding or my
[33:49] revelation it has to be confident in the
[33:51] fact that he said not i said but he said
[33:55] this is my beloved son it is not us
[33:57] being identified with him but it is he
[34:00] being identified with us can the church
[34:02] say amen
[34:05] so i'm excited this morning because i
[34:07] see the season is changing and it's
[34:10] happening so quickly that if you don't
[34:12] have spiritual eyes you will see it as
[34:14] business as usual so may god anoint your
[34:17] eyes with eyes out this morning and i
[34:20] encourage you and for those on the
[34:21] internet i want you to know i'm
[34:22] preaching to the church this morning
[34:25] i'm preaching the headstone tabernacle
[34:27] this morning if you are blessed i
[34:30] welcome you i appreciate you i encourage
[34:32] you when i'm speaking to the church this
[34:34] morning and we are an open church
[34:37] we speak to be a blessing to anybody who
[34:39] wants to be blessed
[34:40] hallelujah we have no agenda we're not
[34:43] telling anybody attend this church join
[34:45] this church follow this church that's
[34:47] not the ministry here hallelujah we are
[34:50] preaching to this local church if it's a
[34:52] blessing to you then thank god and you
[34:54] worship god and use it as a blessing to
[34:57] you so i greet those who are connected
[34:59] to be blessed i also greet those who are
[35:01] connected who want to criticize because
[35:03] you can't stop the critics but i want to
[35:05] encourage you don't stress yourself out
[35:07] if you come to criticize we're not
[35:09] forcing anybody to connect to this we're
[35:12] not encouraging people to stress out
[35:13] yourself to find out what we're
[35:15] preaching we preach this on the
[35:17] revelation of god that he has given to
[35:19] us so if you don't like noise don't
[35:21] criticize the noise that we have here
[35:23] because from the limited understanding i
[35:25] have of the word but the brandon said if
[35:27] there's no noise there's no god until i
[35:29] can see more than that understanding
[35:31] don't let the noise bother you don't let
[35:34] our worship bother you don't let our
[35:36] standing up
[35:40] don't stress yourself out don't let your
[35:42] blood blood pressure go up high
[35:45] you don't have to connect to this
[35:46] service but if you connect to the
[35:48] service i can assure you you're going to
[35:50] hear some shouting you're going to hear
[35:52] some singing you're going to hear some
[35:54] dancing we worship in a way that the
[35:56] world will call heresy even within the
[35:58] message they may call it heresy but
[36:01] don't try to tie me down by your
[36:03] interpretation or revelation of the word
[36:06] this is a sovereign church oh my god
[36:09] deals with individuals and this is an
[36:11] individual church made up of individuals
[36:14] who have seen their name because once
[36:16] you say your name it makes you act a
[36:19] certain way walk a certain way talk a
[36:21] certain way behave a certain way you may
[36:24] be seated
[36:26] [Applause]
[36:28] there many people
[36:29] get stressed out
[36:31] but over it said it's about two two
[36:33] bites ago there's no space in his head
[36:35] for anybody else we're not bothered by
[36:37] what anybody else is doing every church
[36:40] is sovereign you could preach what you
[36:42] want to preach you could teach what you
[36:43] want to teach but you can't come and
[36:45] tell us what we have to preach or what
[36:47] we have to teach we are responsible for
[36:50] those who have made this church their
[36:52] home church that's the limits of our
[36:54] responsibility we have no other
[36:56] responsibility beyond the tight paying
[36:58] members of this church who have made it
[37:00] their home church so don't stress
[37:02] yourself out and say oh gosh that's what
[37:04] but always preaching that's what where
[37:06] the eyes are preaching we will preach
[37:07] this way until god tells us otherwise
[37:10] because we report only to god can the
[37:12] church say amen and your confidence must
[37:15] be based on hearing from god you may be
[37:17] seated
[37:19] my confidence cannot be based on what
[37:21] brother of it says
[37:24] he's the pastor of this church but paul
[37:26] taught us he said follow me as i follow
[37:28] christ i always teach that follow me as
[37:31] i follow christ so i'm watching the
[37:33] pastor but i'm watching christ i'm
[37:34] watching the past and i'm watching
[37:36] christ i'm watching the past and i'm
[37:37] watching christ because i'm gonna make
[37:39] sure because if he is leaving away from
[37:42] christ and i don't want to be there but
[37:44] if it's heading to christ if it's
[37:45] pointed to christ if it pointed to the
[37:47] rapture pointing to the resurrection
[37:49] pointing to the baptism of the holy
[37:51] ghost pointing to revelation after
[37:53] revelation then you don't even try to
[37:55] stop me you
[37:57] you may be
[37:59] [Applause]
[38:03] there are eight seated people on this
[38:04] planet and we're going to get into it
[38:06] why i'm going here
[38:07] why would you be stressed with what
[38:09] another church is doing
[38:12] 1.4 million people in trinidad and
[38:14] tobago
[38:16] there are a lot more people that you can
[38:18] go and testify to and stress out about
[38:20] what we're doing in this church and that
[38:22] applies around the world we need to have
[38:23] a bigger vision of the call of god on
[38:26] our lives can the church say amen
[38:28] can i preach now
[38:30] you know where i'm standing
[38:32] you know where you're standing
[38:34] may the lord bless you
[38:38] i'm feeling good
[38:40] [Applause]
[38:41] just to know i've been redeemed makes me
[38:43] feel good
[38:45] hallelujah you imagine if the if the
[38:47] wise man one bothered because he that
[38:49] brought up ghoul whatever that goal but
[38:51] is he good
[38:53] and the lord opened up frankincense
[38:56] and wondering if this frankincense
[38:58] message i have this morning has any
[38:59] place
[39:00] and whenever this message of murder that
[39:02] we bring in this morning have any place
[39:04] each one had their individual revelation
[39:06] but in the economy of god god is the one
[39:08] who connects the dots and when he
[39:10] connected it it brought a whole message
[39:12] can the church say man
[39:14] so
[39:18] put on your spiritual hats this morning
[39:21] just to encourage the church a little
[39:23] bit
[39:26] i want to take us all back into history
[39:28] before i bring present tense
[39:32] the day was
[39:35] sunday
[39:36] december the 30th
[39:39] 1962.
[39:41] sunday december 30th
[39:44] 1962.
[39:48] just about four months before
[39:51] our country would have just achieved
[39:52] independence
[39:54] from the british
[39:57] john f kennedy is the president
[40:00] in the united states
[40:02] in that year
[40:04] history will record the cuban missile
[40:06] crisis
[40:07] the formation of the european space
[40:09] agency
[40:10] the release of the first beatles record
[40:13] in that year would signal the first came
[40:16] out
[40:17] the first walmart a lot was happening in
[40:19] that year
[40:22] and the day was sunday december 30th
[40:25] 1962.
[40:27] god's prophet had just finished
[40:29] preaching in shreveport the countdown
[40:32] and he followed that messenger countdown
[40:34] with four messages in jeffersonville
[40:36] remembering the lord
[40:38] the falling apart of the world
[40:40] the reproach for the cause of the word
[40:42] and the absolute
[40:45] he finds himself in an evening service
[40:48] speaking about how long he would have
[40:49] kept the people that morning but he felt
[40:52] compelled to come that evening to
[40:53] address a few things
[40:55] he is speaking on a subject on this
[40:57] evening
[40:58] is this the sign of the ends
[41:02] as he goes deeper into his thought his
[41:04] message his subject he begins to touch
[41:07] on certain things
[41:09] for one of the few moments in his entire
[41:11] ministry he would say i don't know what
[41:13] i'm about to say
[41:15] i'm not sure what i'm doing and he said
[41:17] it's weird for a minister to say that to
[41:20] him that i've not been this way before
[41:23] and many things are said in that message
[41:25] he speaks about the blast that would
[41:27] signal his new ministry his new
[41:30] commission
[41:31] he first thought it meant he was going
[41:32] to die but this is 1962 he is trying to
[41:35] figure out what's going on but something
[41:37] is pressing upon him
[41:41] in that message he touches certain
[41:43] things he said but tonight i'm going to
[41:45] speak on something that i do not know
[41:49] and now that's quite a thing for
[41:50] minister to say that he's going to speak
[41:52] on something that he doesn't know about
[41:54] but i'm adventuring out to the best of
[41:56] my knowledge
[41:57] that this church might understand he's
[41:59] trying to bring them to a spot
[42:02] and he says later on we know that we are
[42:04] living in a glorious time for the church
[42:06] but a horrible time for the unbeliever
[42:09] and we're living in one of the most
[42:10] dangerous times of all all that ever was
[42:13] since the world began
[42:15] no prophet no apostle never in no time
[42:18] ever lived in such a time as we live now
[42:21] this is the end
[42:23] he said it's written in the skies it's
[42:25] written over the face of the earth it's
[42:27] written in every newspaper
[42:30] i was just seeing recently this whole
[42:32] covet 19 coronavirus situation they're
[42:34] talking about vaccine they're talking
[42:36] about treatment and recently just a few
[42:39] days ago the doctor saying they're
[42:40] realizing that this is something man has
[42:43] to live with for some time
[42:46] it could be years
[42:49] could you imagine
[42:51] when the world thinks there's an easy
[42:53] release or easy fix or an easy solution
[42:55] or it'll just disappear it said it could
[42:58] be years
[42:59] we don't know and the world doesn't know
[43:02] but god is the one holding these pieces
[43:04] together
[43:05] it's written in every newspaper
[43:07] this is the end he said if you could
[43:08] read the handwriting
[43:10] i'm in a background i'm trying to get
[43:12] somewhere i haven't announced my title
[43:13] yet the prophets lived in the time when
[43:15] the handwriting was on the wall for a
[43:17] nation but we are living when the
[43:19] handwriting is on the wall for time
[43:23] so it's not just the end of a nation or
[43:25] the end of a people or the end of a
[43:27] government or the end of countries this
[43:29] is the handwriting is on the wall
[43:32] speaking to the end of time
[43:34] and the end of time means the all the
[43:36] end of all things that are temporal
[43:38] or temporary or created for this
[43:41] construct that we call time can the
[43:43] church say amen
[43:46] all nations earth everything time is at
[43:48] the end so we must search the scriptures
[43:52] to find the hour that we are living
[43:55] always a true prophet of god
[43:58] will go
[43:59] to the scriptures
[44:01] therefore he is absolute when it's going
[44:03] to be that way
[44:05] in the old testament when prophet said
[44:07] anything there always somewhere was a
[44:10] prophet with the word who stayed with
[44:12] the word he watched god for visions and
[44:14] if his vision was contrary to the word
[44:16] then his vision was wrong that's god's
[44:18] way of getting his word
[44:21] to the people
[44:23] and but ibrahim would speak many things
[44:24] in this message and you should listen to
[44:26] it
[44:27] references junior jackson's dream he
[44:29] messing messa he mentions the banks of
[44:31] the ohio river he mentions all of these
[44:33] connections about his ministry the sign
[44:35] he was under he mentioned about going
[44:37] west he talked about all the he goes
[44:39] into the seven thunders and he goes to a
[44:40] lot of these things
[44:44] but that's not where i'm going this
[44:45] morning
[44:48] then there's a moment of fear
[44:50] in his preaching
[44:53] the prophet stumbles on a moment of
[44:54] reflection and concern
[44:58] this is this is almost now about 30
[45:00] years he would reference it that he's in
[45:02] this pulpit that he's been preaching
[45:04] he's been teaching
[45:07] and he screams out in this message it
[45:09] might be closer than you think
[45:11] it is
[45:13] and he says
[45:14] it got me scared
[45:19] i want you to see a prophet now who as
[45:21] he is now ministering reaches a point
[45:23] where
[45:27] he said it got me scared
[45:29] oh i haven't done enough
[45:32] where are we at
[45:34] time shall be no more
[45:36] he announces time is over
[45:39] the statement all i haven't done enough
[45:43] from the prophet is a shaking statement
[45:48] at that moment the prophet realized that
[45:50] there was more to be done
[45:55] he was speaking on a personal level so
[45:57] he was not at that point he's not
[45:59] talking about the church
[46:01] he's not talking about brother norman
[46:02] he's not talking about about about
[46:04] about uh
[46:05] but uh but a sutman but a buzzword he
[46:08] doesn't want anybody else
[46:11] he realizes something
[46:13] i haven't done enough
[46:16] that's a realization
[46:19] he had had many encounters with the
[46:21] angel of the lord he had already
[46:23] ministered for many years around the
[46:25] world he had already been used by god
[46:27] for many mighty miracles and here it was
[46:29] the prophet is saying oh
[46:31] i haven't done enough
[46:35] i'm trying to talk to the church this
[46:36] morning this is one of those messages
[46:39] this morning with the lord's help i
[46:40] would like to take a title
[46:42] have we done
[46:44] enough
[46:46] that's the title have we done enough
[46:49] for my subject
[46:51] have you done
[46:52] enough
[46:53] and my inspiration have i done
[46:57] enough
[46:58] the question this morning is that have
[47:00] we heard enough
[47:04] because for years people have heard the
[47:06] message
[47:08] but when you watch the lives and the
[47:10] testimonies and the behaviors and the
[47:12] conduct clearly it is not just hearing.
[47:18] i'm preaching to this church now
[47:21] there's a difference between hearing and
[47:23] doing the question and i'm challenging
[47:25] us this morning
[47:27] have we done enough
[47:30] have you done enough have i done enough
[47:33] i'm positioning that there's nobody else
[47:35] above it because if the prophet could
[47:36] admit that he did not do enough
[47:39] at that point in his ministry
[47:42] what about you what about me what about
[47:43] us this morning
[47:45] have we done enough
[47:47] have you done enough have i done enough
[47:50] but i branham said up god don't make
[47:52] halfway preachers but a preacher could
[47:54] be halfway and to be halfway means a
[47:56] preacher is not doing enough
[47:59] but the man said god don't make half a
[48:01] christian but a christian could be
[48:02] halfway what he is saying is that that
[48:04] christian is not doing enough
[48:10] there's a difference between hearing and
[48:12] doing and that's what i want to get to
[48:14] is not have we heard enough
[48:19] not have we seen enough
[48:22] because we have seen enough
[48:24] we have heard enough
[48:26] for years we have heard this message we
[48:28] have seen what god has done
[48:32] have we done enough have you done enough
[48:35] have i done enough
[48:40] there's a difference between seeing and
[48:41] doing um challenging us this morning
[48:44] maybe to wake somebody up maybe just
[48:46] tear somebody because when i saw this it
[48:48] got me scared
[48:50] it got me scared
[48:52] and i could see that the prophet now
[48:54] he's getting closer his ministry is
[48:56] expanding and he's reasonable realizing
[48:58] there's not much time left
[49:00] and there's so much to do
[49:03] and he can't afford to take chances
[49:06] it's not how much services you attend
[49:09] did i attend enough search
[49:13] people have attended church and backslid
[49:15] and went to the world and cursed this
[49:16] message
[49:19] people have sat in ministries for years
[49:21] and still have the audacity to ill speak
[49:24] ministers ill-speak believers
[49:28] sat under this ministry not this church
[49:31] ministry the ministry of this great
[49:33] eligible prophet
[49:34] malachi 4 5 6. saying luke 17 30
[49:38] revelation 10 7 sit under this
[49:43] so it has to go beyond hearing
[49:45] it has to go beyond seeing because even
[49:47] the prophet
[49:48] said what we've seen happen should put
[49:51] every soul into action
[49:56] that action is the doing part
[49:59] have we done enough
[50:01] what is the action that you are taking
[50:04] are we
[50:05] taking enough action
[50:07] are you taking enough action am i taking
[50:09] enough action it's a challenge to all of
[50:11] us here this morning
[50:14] i was seeing somebody speaking about
[50:17] jesus
[50:18] when he was ministering to his disciples
[50:21] and he called peter he called him he
[50:22] says i will make you fishers of men
[50:28] fishermen
[50:31] a minister is supposed to be a fisherman
[50:36] a believer is supposed to be a fisherman
[50:41] i saw one time with the prophet spoke
[50:43] with how many souls he brought to christ
[50:47] and i sat there as i was going to say
[50:49] how many men have you fished
[50:54] because by definition if god is calling
[50:56] peter to be a fisherman then his success
[50:58] could only be measured by how many men
[51:00] he fished
[51:02] because that was the commission i call
[51:04] to be fishers of men
[51:06] i give you power to go and preach the
[51:07] gospel
[51:09] take this to every nation
[51:10] so failure to do that would have meant
[51:13] failure of what the call was
[51:16] anybody with me this morning
[51:18] have you done enough
[51:20] have we done enough
[51:22] have i done enough
[51:24] what we have seen happen should put
[51:25] every soul into action
[51:28] i'm sorry to disappoint you this is not
[51:29] one of those jump of the wall services
[51:34] this is one of those sirs is this the
[51:36] time of the end kind of message
[51:38] that we have to relook at what we see we
[51:40] look at what we do we look at how we
[51:42] live we look at how we act and i'm
[51:44] coming to your house in a minute
[51:47] what we have seen happen should put
[51:48] every soul in action it should make a
[51:50] church i would make a revival so that's
[51:52] a doing part
[52:00] that people would fly in from europe to
[52:02] see that what taking place they say
[52:03] there's a place in arizona there's
[52:05] something broke until the seven thunders
[52:07] of revelation 10 that's not even wrote
[52:09] in the bible it's being manifested
[52:12] there are many people who don't want to
[52:14] look for revival
[52:15] i i can't force them nobody to look for
[52:17] a revival
[52:19] but you know something about have i done
[52:20] enough
[52:21] it means that that you could do and do
[52:24] and do and realize it's not enough
[52:29] that's a scary yeah let me let me me let
[52:31] me can i take my time a little bit
[52:34] the question is that have we learnt
[52:36] enough that's not the question
[52:40] the question is that have we preached
[52:41] enough
[52:43] and although these words may be doing
[52:45] words or action words or verbs
[52:50] there has to be more to it than this
[52:52] because of the fact that the prophet was
[52:54] making this statement after so many
[52:56] years of miracles teaching preaching
[52:59] that he was doing an assessment
[53:01] he was taking inventory
[53:04] more than that friends he wanted to be
[53:06] sure
[53:08] you see why i read a scripture make your
[53:10] calling an election
[53:11] [Music]
[53:12] sure
[53:13] are you sure today
[53:18] are you sure
[53:20] but i brought him in many places he said
[53:22] he spoke about anybody he would wrap it
[53:24] up he said if you were to get called
[53:25] right now
[53:27] you answer
[53:31] are you sure
[53:32] the way you spoke to your husband this
[53:35] morning are you sure
[53:37] the way you spoke to your wife are you
[53:39] sure
[53:40] do we use death we determine are you
[53:42] sure
[53:43] do you conduct yourself in the workplace
[53:45] are you sure
[53:46] your approach to god are you sure you
[53:49] approach the ministry are you sure that
[53:51] you're ready
[53:52] you approach to the scriptures are you
[53:54] sure that you are ready
[53:56] you approach your prayer life are you
[53:58] sure that you are ready
[54:03] the prophet he was not taking things for
[54:05] granted
[54:07] the question of not doing raises deeper
[54:11] issues
[54:13] the question of not doing enough
[54:18] doing enough because he said i haven't
[54:20] done enough
[54:21] so it is not that he didn't do i want to
[54:24] make the point clear
[54:25] it is he did he was i didn't do enough
[54:29] in other words all my activities
[54:33] still haven't reached a level that could
[54:35] be enough
[54:37] now i wonder i want to drive this home
[54:38] friends
[54:41] let me take my time here
[54:43] to help us and to help the younger
[54:45] people maybe
[54:46] when you fail an examination
[54:49] it means one thing
[54:52] you did not do enough
[54:57] it's really simple
[55:00] and that is why it is so perplexing how
[55:02] children could go through five years of
[55:04] school and leave school without a
[55:06] certification
[55:08] because what it means is they haven't
[55:10] done enough
[55:12] and i can't take excuses because i heard
[55:14] somebody say recently there's a whole
[55:15] book on excuses
[55:17] but you could for every person who said
[55:19] they had a hard time growing up there's
[55:21] somebody with a harder time who made it
[55:26] anybody with me this morning i'm coming
[55:27] to your home now
[55:29] recently on the news somewhere i think
[55:31] was india or brazil or somewhere it went
[55:34] viral of a young boy he was studying
[55:36] under a street lamp
[55:39] because he had no electricity in his
[55:41] house
[55:42] but his determination to make it in
[55:44] school he would go at night and sit on
[55:47] the street lamp where there was light
[55:53] and then when you look at him
[55:54] successfully wants to know well well
[55:56] well what is your excuse
[56:00] i was sharing with my dad recently a
[56:02] lawyer passed away in our country
[56:05] and they were giving a recap of his life
[56:08] story they said he learned the alphabet
[56:11] at 17 years old
[56:16] he learned
[56:17] the alphabet
[56:19] at 17 years old and went on to be one of
[56:22] the most prominent lawyers and a judge
[56:24] in trinidad and tobago
[56:27] what was the difference between him and
[56:29] those who went to preschool primary
[56:31] school if he didn't even go what was the
[56:33] difference
[56:35] it is because he had a desire to achieve
[56:37] something
[56:40] and that desire pushed him against all
[56:42] odds so i shared with bretov recently i
[56:44] said it is consistent in life and god
[56:47] and in church it's the same thing
[56:49] people who are late for work late for
[56:50] church
[56:52] many times
[56:55] they're late for everything
[56:59] because it's a discipline of behavior
[57:01] and god's word brings discipline
[57:07] are you ready
[57:08] have a few done enough
[57:10] have we done enough
[57:12] am i doing enough
[57:16] in other words
[57:17] so i'm bringing a type to you now
[57:19] because i want to be careful the
[57:20] objective so you understand the
[57:22] objective of this message
[57:24] i don't want to do
[57:26] and then find out what i did was not
[57:28] enough
[57:28] that's the problem i have
[57:31] anybody
[57:32] with me you come to church all these
[57:34] years by the parents read these books
[57:36] listen to tapes worship pray crowd and
[57:39] then realize lord i come to the exam
[57:43] i'm your kappas
[57:47] and that is why you have to move by
[57:48] revelation because i was thinking about
[57:50] it and we have esteemed teachers here
[57:54] when every course of study has a
[57:56] syllabus or a curriculum or but it's
[57:59] even am i right there's some structure
[58:01] of a body of knowledge that you are
[58:03] supposed to acquire at the end of the
[58:05] journey
[58:06] but you know what it is it's impossible
[58:10] on the exam to test you on every single
[58:14] thing that is in the curriculum and any
[58:16] syllabus it's almost impossible because
[58:18] the exam has a time limit
[58:21] so you are forced as a teacher to
[58:23] determine what comes in the exam anybody
[58:25] with me
[58:26] so if you had this experience in school
[58:29] sometimes teachers will tell you well in
[58:31] the exam we're only going to touch on
[58:33] these five topics in the exam
[58:35] during the year you would have done 15
[58:37] topics we'll be cut testing all 15 so so
[58:39] in general these are the areas and they
[58:41] give you these focus areas
[58:44] but that's what our prophet did also
[58:47] because but abandoned preached many
[58:48] things but what is the exam
[58:55] what are we being tested on
[58:58] that's a deep question because people
[58:59] are going to church today in many
[59:01] churches and they don't know what's
[59:03] coming on the exam
[59:05] and they are comfortable thinking that
[59:07] my attendance is in the requirement for
[59:10] the exam it's part of it but that's not
[59:12] the exam
[59:19] let me put it to you another way
[59:21] do i give all my money to the poor
[59:26] i am nothing if i don't have charity
[59:29] do i give my body to be burnt
[59:31] do i have all knowledge
[59:33] do i know all mysteries
[59:36] so it meant that the mystery and the
[59:38] knowledge and the body burning and give
[59:39] it to the poor that's wonderful
[59:42] but that's not the exam
[59:46] [Music]
[59:49] can i drive home this thing
[59:52] it brings a razor sharp focus now you
[59:55] could be a super student
[59:57] and the students who i know them in
[59:59] school they study everything they know
[1:00:01] the five points are coming but they know
[1:00:02] everything else too whatever you throw
[1:00:04] them they're good enough what if they're
[1:00:06] good
[1:00:07] they know everything every answer they
[1:00:08] read the book i think i shared it with
[1:00:10] the church here one time
[1:00:12] i studied so hard for coming insurance
[1:00:15] brother punch i don't know anybody who
[1:00:17] was he said they thought of me for
[1:00:19] coming entrance
[1:00:21] until to this day i can't remember what
[1:00:23] yeah i do common entrance i could still
[1:00:25] remember by the eclipse word for wood
[1:00:28] part of my notes from my biology and
[1:00:30] common entrance
[1:00:31] because i
[1:00:33] took my notebook from common entrance
[1:00:36] and i read it and i taped it
[1:00:39] so i could listen back
[1:00:41] to the notes
[1:00:42] and the first part of the tape is the
[1:00:44] part you would always listen to because
[1:00:45] that part always come in first
[1:00:47] so that first part stuck in my head till
[1:00:49] this day i can't even take it out
[1:00:52] i've said it before not all plants and
[1:00:54] animals are eaten some die and fall back
[1:00:56] to the ground these dead organic
[1:00:58] substances are reduced to simpler
[1:01:00] substances the process by which this is
[1:01:02] done is called the key
[1:01:04] decay is caused by small plants and
[1:01:05] bacteria called fungi like other living
[1:01:08] organisms bacteria and fungi need food
[1:01:10] to live they cannot get their own food
[1:01:12] like the green plants do so they get
[1:01:13] their food by attacking their plants and
[1:01:14] animals
[1:01:16] you know what years i leave school
[1:01:19] but for the life of me i can't take it
[1:01:21] out
[1:01:22] i can't undo it put me in that exam room
[1:01:24] i could still pass that exam
[1:01:27] because i did enough
[1:01:31] to ensure that it stuck
[1:01:35] no this is the problem
[1:01:37] if you want to do what you want to do
[1:01:41] because brother branham preached many
[1:01:42] things
[1:01:43] preach about the poor picture but rome
[1:01:45] preached about the mark of the beast and
[1:01:47] a lot of things there's a lot of them
[1:01:48] because as the prophet messenger of the
[1:01:50] age he had a responsibility to tie up
[1:01:53] all the loose ends
[1:01:56] but he also had another responsibility
[1:01:59] to prepare bride to leave this place
[1:02:03] so i have no problem which you load in
[1:02:06] the entire curriculum
[1:02:08] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:02:10] it's wonderful we have food for days you
[1:02:12] have food every day
[1:02:14] but make sure
[1:02:16] that you pass the exam
[1:02:20] it doesn't make sense you have the
[1:02:22] knowledge and it will pass the exam
[1:02:25] make sure you make the main thing
[1:02:28] terry say make sure you keep the main
[1:02:29] thing the main thing
[1:02:31] everybody with me this morning is this
[1:02:34] helping anybody this morning
[1:02:36] this is not a deep message but it's a
[1:02:38] important one i believe
[1:02:41] have i done enough
[1:02:43] so i use the example of a school child
[1:02:45] so i said in other words a question have
[1:02:47] i done enough is the same question a
[1:02:49] student would ask before walking into an
[1:02:52] exam room
[1:02:54] but by then
[1:02:55] just as in the spiritual realm it's too
[1:02:56] late
[1:03:00] because you have no time left there's a
[1:03:01] countdown when they say exam started
[1:03:04] exams start boom
[1:03:07] the time to study is over
[1:03:09] the time to take note is over the time
[1:03:11] to ask questions is over the time to
[1:03:13] confirm your approach is over at that
[1:03:16] point you have to perform
[1:03:18] it's the same as he who is filthy filthy
[1:03:20] still he who is righteous righteous
[1:03:22] still he's who knows what's coming in
[1:03:23] the exam and is prepared for the exam
[1:03:25] you can't change it at that point
[1:03:27] because it's already
[1:03:29] everybody with me this morning
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:32] have i done enough is the same question
[1:03:34] that should be asked
[1:03:36] by doctors
[1:03:38] would you want to be in an exam room and
[1:03:39] the doctor didn't do enough
[1:03:44] i just finished it i still have one more
[1:03:46] course to do
[1:03:49] i still i think the examiner
[1:03:50] that course i was struggling with that
[1:03:52] course you know but here is we go try a
[1:03:54] thing here today
[1:03:56] how would you feel
[1:03:58] you might even get healed your feet
[1:04:00] might get healed
[1:04:01] at that point your feet might get over
[1:04:03] that red to say where are you going he
[1:04:04] running straight out your feet make you
[1:04:06] whole yes
[1:04:09] because that doctor if nobody but think
[1:04:12] about it a doctor could only speak with
[1:04:14] confidence because they know they've
[1:04:15] done enough
[1:04:16] if you meet that doctor buddy that they
[1:04:18] say what what going on with you oh i
[1:04:20] never hear about that
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:23] there's i don't know now that would yeah
[1:04:25] this is automatically but here well i
[1:04:27] will get two types or not i will get it
[1:04:28] and they said a gear prescription too
[1:04:34] so have i done enough is the same
[1:04:36] question that should be asked by doctors
[1:04:38] by teachers by lawyers by engineers by
[1:04:40] presidents by prime ministers this whole
[1:04:43] corona virus situation has raised to the
[1:04:45] four countries that have done enough and
[1:04:47] have not done it enough
[1:04:50] it's a real issue
[1:04:52] it's consistent through life
[1:04:55] do a country that did enough see the
[1:04:58] results of it the country did not do
[1:05:00] enough you see the results of it
[1:05:04] have i done enough
[1:05:06] it's a question that should be asked and
[1:05:08] answered by husbands
[1:05:10] tulia coming home
[1:05:14] but obviously i reach
[1:05:19] i
[1:05:20] reach have you done enough
[1:05:23] speaking to the husbands
[1:05:28] have you done enough
[1:05:32] is it a 40
[1:05:33] is it a 50
[1:05:35] is it a 58
[1:05:37] is it a trial my best
[1:05:40] as a father have you done enough
[1:05:45] we're inside the house now
[1:05:48] as a mother have you done enough
[1:05:52] as a wife have you done enough
[1:05:55] because these are great responsibilities
[1:05:57] they are not accidental
[1:06:01] it is responsible yet are given to you
[1:06:03] whether you think you're ready or not
[1:06:05] and you have to step up to the task
[1:06:08] and ensure that you do enough
[1:06:12] whether you were taught or not you still
[1:06:14] required to do
[1:06:24] have i done enough
[1:06:29] as you dig deeper into these things you
[1:06:30] realize sometimes it's some sometimes
[1:06:33] the question becomes more important are
[1:06:34] the answers
[1:06:36] because many of us we don't ask the deep
[1:06:39] questions for us to change our behavior
[1:06:43] somebody said to me and i'm not feeling
[1:06:45] the anointing
[1:06:46] out of the spirit have you done enough
[1:06:51] because what will work for me may not
[1:06:53] work for you
[1:06:55] you have to know if you doing enough if
[1:06:57] this thing really mean all to you
[1:07:02] anybody with me
[1:07:08] put another way what more can you do
[1:07:13] put another way what more should you do
[1:07:16] put another way what more must you do
[1:07:23] it is real friends
[1:07:27] and on this one question hinge is
[1:07:30] rapture no rapture
[1:07:32] on this one question hinges you making
[1:07:34] it and not making it
[1:07:39] because back when the death angel was
[1:07:41] passing through the land but abandoned
[1:07:43] made it clear he said the death angel
[1:07:44] wasn't asking the question what tribe he
[1:07:47] belonged to
[1:07:48] it was have you done enough
[1:07:50] because the requirement was clear on
[1:07:52] what to do
[1:07:54] it was not even based on your identity
[1:07:56] or your identification it was not based
[1:07:58] on your tribe or your belief
[1:08:01] because the belief and the tribe should
[1:08:03] have led you into action so the test was
[1:08:05] no longer belief and tribe the test was
[1:08:08] action have you done enough
[1:08:12] take the blood and put it on the
[1:08:14] doorpost
[1:08:15] i could imagine i said that angel is
[1:08:17] passing through the land the children in
[1:08:19] the house saying daddy did we do enough
[1:08:21] that firstborn child who know that if
[1:08:24] this thing wasn't done correctly
[1:08:26] i'm the one in trouble because it's dead
[1:08:28] to the firstborn
[1:08:30] phil was saying daddy did we do enough
[1:08:32] are you
[1:08:33] are you sure
[1:08:35] did did we put it on the right way did
[1:08:36] we take his open did we did we get a
[1:08:39] lamb without blemish did we did we did
[1:08:41] we put everything in place because i'm
[1:08:43] hearing cries coming up a road coming
[1:08:45] closer to us have we done enough
[1:08:48] daddy have you done enough have i done
[1:08:50] enough because we know what's coming
[1:08:54] think back to the days of noah god have
[1:08:56] the family in the ark they're locked in
[1:08:58] the ark
[1:09:00] but abraham said it daddy are you sure
[1:09:03] we did all that god asked us to do are
[1:09:06] you sure this boat is going to survive
[1:09:08] are you sure that this is what we're
[1:09:10] supposed to do
[1:09:13] have we done
[1:09:15] enough
[1:09:19] elders ministers deacons
[1:09:23] mothers have you prayed enough
[1:09:26] fathers have you prayed enough
[1:09:29] deacons have you prayed enough
[1:09:35] believers have you prayed enough
[1:09:38] have you done enough
[1:09:44] what more should you do what more must
[1:09:46] you do
[1:09:48] throughout scripture back in genesis we
[1:09:51] see abel under revelation
[1:09:54] preparing to make his sacrifice
[1:09:56] trying to make sure that everything is
[1:09:58] in place wondering have i done enough
[1:10:01] and i can see the peace that came over
[1:10:03] abel when god accepted his sacrifice
[1:10:06] it was enough
[1:10:09] cain also brought a sacrifice
[1:10:12] but it was not enough
[1:10:16] is your sacrifice enough
[1:10:19] the bible says we bring a sacrifice of
[1:10:21] praise into the house of the lord it
[1:10:23] says this is not a jump on shout service
[1:10:28] it is a shake a reality in us that the
[1:10:30] things that we fight for and think may
[1:10:32] be important may not be as important as
[1:10:34] you think
[1:10:44] so the rich young ruler
[1:10:47] came to jesus
[1:10:50] say what
[1:10:51] what motion what what what what else can
[1:10:53] i do
[1:10:54] to have this eternal life to enter the
[1:10:55] kingdom of god he's truly
[1:10:57] so jesus said to him
[1:11:00] keep the commandments
[1:11:01] he said but i've done all that
[1:11:03] so it was not like he wasn't doing he
[1:11:05] was in a backseating condition he was
[1:11:07] doing all that he was supposed to do
[1:11:09] and then when god realized when he
[1:11:10] realized that he was really looking now
[1:11:12] to make sure he had done everything he
[1:11:14] could do
[1:11:14] this is beyond the law now
[1:11:17] this is beyond the law
[1:11:19] this is now dealing with the inner man
[1:11:21] the man on the inside that nobody could
[1:11:22] see
[1:11:24] now god could discern to him there's
[1:11:25] more that you need to do you haven't
[1:11:27] done enough
[1:11:30] can i keep bringing it home
[1:11:32] so he was perfectly legal
[1:11:36] by the letter of the law as the pastor
[1:11:38] said he did all the commandments
[1:11:42] but this wasn't a law thing anymore
[1:11:45] all right
[1:11:46] anybody with me they were allotting his
[1:11:48] satiated desire in his heart it was a
[1:11:50] little too much
[1:11:51] that was pushing down the place of gold
[1:11:53] in his heart and god said go sell all
[1:11:55] you have and the bible say he he left
[1:11:57] sorrowful
[1:12:01] but he was still trying to get this same
[1:12:04] question answered have i done
[1:12:07] enough
[1:12:09] nicodemus
[1:12:10] hiding out secret meeting
[1:12:15] he want to make sure
[1:12:17] that this eternal life this thing
[1:12:20] i come into church all these years i
[1:12:21] believe all these years good master how
[1:12:24] can i
[1:12:25] is that how you came to church this
[1:12:26] morning
[1:12:27] you want to be sure that you make any
[1:12:29] rapture
[1:12:30] not sure i'm making church a lot of
[1:12:32] people this morning there are a lot of
[1:12:33] people who will mislead rapture friends
[1:12:37] this is real i want to bring this home
[1:12:40] with all these shout and singing writing
[1:12:41] songs interpreting the word divine
[1:12:43] mystery will miss the rapture
[1:12:46] because they have not done enough
[1:12:49] god is no respecter of persons he is a
[1:12:51] respecter of his examination
[1:13:02] we know it matthew 25 10 virgins
[1:13:05] but a random nail is down 10 versions
[1:13:08] five wise five foolish
[1:13:10] virgin he said chased pure
[1:13:13] you can't impute sin on them
[1:13:21] and it's very simple
[1:13:22] five did enough and five didn't do
[1:13:25] enough
[1:13:27] very very simple
[1:13:29] ahmed ibrahim said
[1:13:31] that what
[1:13:32] the oil the extra oil that extra that
[1:13:35] extra that was what made the difference
[1:13:41] so when god weighed in the balance what
[1:13:44] they were presenting he said the ones
[1:13:46] with oil they can make it
[1:13:47] they're ready to go
[1:13:49] and just like the exam we talked about
[1:13:51] it was too late now to add to your
[1:13:53] knowledge to your revelation to your
[1:13:55] character to your life because the call
[1:13:57] had come exam start time to go
[1:14:09] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:14:10] you
[1:14:13] i want to make sure that
[1:14:15] this
[1:14:18] this thing resonates in your heart that
[1:14:19] you need to do it more
[1:14:22] but ibraham would speak many times of
[1:14:24] people who
[1:14:26] would come by to be healed
[1:14:29] and he said that they didn't have enough
[1:14:31] feet
[1:14:32] so he was making point about doing
[1:14:34] enough having enough achieving enough so
[1:14:36] they had fear to know
[1:14:38] but it was not enough
[1:14:42] i want to challenge the church this
[1:14:43] morning there are people who have a
[1:14:44] testimony but they need to do more
[1:14:46] that testimony is not enough
[1:14:53] i want to challenge you thinking a
[1:14:54] little bit i was doing some research on
[1:14:57] the olympics
[1:14:59] and the way people trained for the
[1:15:01] olympics
[1:15:03] and one athlete was saying that they try
[1:15:06] to figure out what they could do that
[1:15:07] they think the competition is not doing
[1:15:11] so it's not just about doing enough to
[1:15:13] make it now they want to do extra
[1:15:15] because they want to be sure
[1:15:18] that's the same thing with the wise
[1:15:19] version because they had extra they
[1:15:21] wanted to be sure
[1:15:22] what extra now i'm pushing beyond enough
[1:15:24] now to what extra are you doing
[1:15:26] on a daily basis
[1:15:28] to bring you closer to your destination
[1:15:32] what action did you do this week
[1:15:48] i know some people think that
[1:15:52] there's a lot of mysteries and different
[1:15:53] things and ideas and things and things
[1:15:55] but did you pray every day
[1:15:58] did you talk to god every day
[1:16:00] the way he would come long and cool in
[1:16:01] the evening with adam
[1:16:03] have you done that every day
[1:16:07] because an athlete who is getting ready
[1:16:09] for a competition trains every day
[1:16:12] have you prayed every day
[1:16:14] have you read the bible every day have
[1:16:16] you forgiven every day then you haven't
[1:16:18] done enough
[1:16:21] we feel in small exams oh you will pass
[1:16:24] the big one
[1:16:27] situations come to us to forgive and
[1:16:29] you're all in stuff
[1:16:32] how we expect to pass a big exam and you
[1:16:34] can't forgive
[1:16:40] god sending all these exams to you every
[1:16:42] week
[1:16:44] upset and stop allowing stuff in your
[1:16:46] life to be upset and test comment real
[1:16:48] test communication with the children the
[1:16:50] bills the house eating and
[1:16:55] small tests
[1:16:58] have you done enough
[1:17:00] so i'm not just talking about praying
[1:17:02] and reading now but it's the daily life
[1:17:04] i want to get to because that's a test
[1:17:08] listen let me make it there's no rapture
[1:17:10] to go if a husband can't show love to
[1:17:12] his wife
[1:17:13] forget rapture forget it if your wife
[1:17:16] cannot reverence the husband there's no
[1:17:19] rapture
[1:17:23] because it's a life
[1:17:26] oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:17:31] children obeying their parents that's
[1:17:33] our life
[1:17:36] more so and especially out on top of
[1:17:39] that if the community helps you lord and
[1:17:41] and you know they want you you want one
[1:17:42] best for you
[1:17:46] i thought it's not a short jump message
[1:17:49] this question is hinging on your calling
[1:17:52] an election being sure
[1:17:54] have you done enough
[1:18:00] i don't want this to go on the road of
[1:18:01] having regret now because there's
[1:18:02] nothing we can do about the past
[1:18:05] we can't change the past
[1:18:07] what we did or did not do yesterday is
[1:18:10] already finished
[1:18:13] but the question from no no no no
[1:18:19] how much more time will you pray for
[1:18:20] your children
[1:18:22] how much more time would you spend
[1:18:23] praying for the holy ghost
[1:18:25] how much more time will you pray crying
[1:18:27] out for revival
[1:18:28] how much more time would you spend
[1:18:29] tearing off the tv it's not just what
[1:18:31] you do is what what you didn't do
[1:18:36] you're following all the political news
[1:18:38] you know everything with every candidate
[1:18:45] really now in this season
[1:18:51] have you done enough
[1:18:52] have i done enough have we done enough
[1:19:00] throughout life and history we find this
[1:19:03] recurring situation of doing enough
[1:19:06] and not doing enough many people who
[1:19:08] have achieved have done so against a
[1:19:10] backdrop of major disadvantages in life
[1:19:14] because they persevered to do everything
[1:19:16] they could do to achieve what they
[1:19:17] wanted if you remember the time that but
[1:19:20] abandoned the story of the man who who
[1:19:21] he had a colored slave or whatever and
[1:19:24] he said he want to get the holy ghost
[1:19:25] because he saw the
[1:19:26] arrival on his man life
[1:19:28] and he said carry me i want to get the
[1:19:30] holy ghost and he carried him and show
[1:19:32] him he said well if you want to
[1:19:34] have to come come come come
[1:19:36] and when they reach a pigsty he say ah
[1:19:38] da where to go
[1:19:43] recognize that he has to wonder if he
[1:19:44] really wanted
[1:19:46] if he was willing to do enough
[1:19:50] the very spirit of this laodicean age
[1:19:54] is they believe they have arrived
[1:19:59] they believe they have need of nothing
[1:20:02] and that spirit is in the message
[1:20:04] we have a prophet we have a message we
[1:20:06] have and people walking around not doing
[1:20:08] what they're supposed to do
[1:20:10] they believe they have done enough
[1:20:12] i want to read the scripture slowly
[1:20:13] somebody said slow down and take it can
[1:20:15] we talk a little bit more
[1:20:18] and until the angel of the church of the
[1:20:19] laodiceans write revelation 3 14 these
[1:20:22] things say the amen the faithful and
[1:20:24] true witness the beginning of the
[1:20:26] creation of god i know thy works
[1:20:29] so i know thy works is now speaking
[1:20:31] about your activities
[1:20:33] about what you're doing thou art neither
[1:20:35] cold nor hot
[1:20:37] so it's not that people not doing stuff
[1:20:41] but they're not doing it all the way
[1:20:44] that's what the bible is saying come and
[1:20:45] take it slowly
[1:20:47] i would that dog were cold or hot
[1:20:50] so then because thou art lukewarm i need
[1:20:53] a coal no hot i will spew the out of my
[1:20:55] mouth
[1:20:58] how zealous are you for the gospel i'm
[1:20:59] tired of hearing people talking about
[1:21:01] how it used to be
[1:21:03] and how zealous they used to be and i'm
[1:21:04] excited and so testify when the last of
[1:21:06] you testified that i have nothing to do
[1:21:08] with the church out of you
[1:21:11] if you're not testifying every day but
[1:21:13] branham said they're going to end up
[1:21:14] back student
[1:21:16] that is a daily part on this we have
[1:21:19] failed friends
[1:21:23] we have not done enough
[1:21:26] wellness testified to somebody
[1:21:29] some of us 10 years ago somewhere 20
[1:21:30] years ago someone when you first come to
[1:21:32] the message and then and then what
[1:21:33] happened
[1:21:35] what's your excuse
[1:21:38] what's your excuse
[1:21:40] so then because our lukewarm what is it
[1:21:43] it's lukewarm
[1:21:46] because if you're truly passionate about
[1:21:47] something and you believe in something
[1:21:49] it'll be on your lips every day
[1:21:51] the end is here time is upon us
[1:21:58] see people love to hear this stuff about
[1:22:00] what they could get and what they will
[1:22:01] get and what they will be and what they
[1:22:02] will do
[1:22:04] but what are you doing now
[1:22:06] because to do then you have to do now
[1:22:08] to have them you must do now to live
[1:22:10] there you must do now
[1:22:13] he said only perfect love will be over
[1:22:15] there so if you don't have perfect love
[1:22:17] now don't talk about over there until
[1:22:18] you fix it here
[1:22:20] fix it in your home fix it in your life
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:31] this is a hard message you're preaching
[1:22:33] it's not a message that people want to
[1:22:34] run and preach
[1:22:38] have you done enough
[1:22:41] tell me yesterday what you did for the
[1:22:42] kingdom
[1:22:46] tell me what did you do yesterday for
[1:22:48] the kingdom of god
[1:22:50] and did you do all that you could do
[1:22:54] and on friday what did you do for the
[1:22:56] kingdom what did he do for your soul
[1:22:57] what did he do for your house what did
[1:22:59] he do for your life what did he do for
[1:23:00] your children for your marriage
[1:23:02] because all that is the basic family
[1:23:04] unit that god placed there in the garden
[1:23:06] of eden over the work and the commitment
[1:23:09] and he builds
[1:23:11] that has his place too but don't
[1:23:12] compromise this thing
[1:23:16] make sure and keep the main thing the
[1:23:17] main thing friends
[1:23:19] that's why they say what shall we
[1:23:20] prophet a man to gain the whole world
[1:23:22] and to lose his soul because to lose his
[1:23:24] soul it meant he didn't do enough
[1:23:27] because you have to make your calling an
[1:23:29] election show
[1:23:31] i want to drive this home friends
[1:23:34] because the weak excuses god not taking
[1:23:36] it
[1:23:38] we saw it with moses moses city i say i
[1:23:39] can't talk and when it was done god said
[1:23:42] it's still going and god is showing and
[1:23:44] not accepting excuses
[1:23:46] there's no excuse for not having a
[1:23:48] prayer life there's no excuse
[1:23:50] there's i want to say it again there is
[1:23:51] no excuse to not having a prayer life
[1:23:55] there is nothing you can present today
[1:23:57] of not having a prayer life
[1:24:01] i want to drill it to the church this
[1:24:03] morning
[1:24:05] no excuse for not reading the scriptures
[1:24:08] every day not by every day people do
[1:24:10] what they want to do
[1:24:12] make time to watch the news make time to
[1:24:14] watch your papers make time to call
[1:24:16] relatives turn the phone down and read
[1:24:18] your bible read the prophet message go
[1:24:21] and pray pray with your family talk to
[1:24:23] your husband talk to your wife call your
[1:24:25] children
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:29] that's what i'm talking about that's the
[1:24:31] foundation of church wasting time
[1:24:33] gossiping
[1:24:34] foolishness
[1:24:37] have we done enough have you done enough
[1:24:40] have i done enough i'm preaching to this
[1:24:42] church i don't care what anybody else
[1:24:43] does this is sovereign
[1:24:45] i want to make it i want to be there in
[1:24:46] the rapture i want to be sure that i do
[1:24:49] all that i could do
[1:24:51] i don't want to go on here see
[1:24:53] i don't want to go to anybody else's
[1:24:55] revelation it has to be what the tapes
[1:24:57] say nothing else i don't care about
[1:24:59] nothing else give me liberty or give me
[1:25:02] death
[1:25:04] you may be seated
[1:25:06] on this same message
[1:25:09] on december the 10th 1962 but abram said
[1:25:12] if you're unsure about something go
[1:25:14] listen back in the tape
[1:25:16] he said it clearly he just said don't
[1:25:18] say anything if you're not sure about it
[1:25:21] go back to the tape
[1:25:23] he put it on the tape for a reason
[1:25:33] have you done enough
[1:25:35] have we done enough
[1:25:37] have i done enough
[1:25:43] i've seen it in a natural but a george
[1:25:44] i'm seeing it in the spiritual
[1:25:47] people sit down in the workplace
[1:25:49] from a certain time to a certain time
[1:25:52] what's different between one employee
[1:25:54] and another employee
[1:25:56] what makes one more productive and the
[1:25:57] other productive
[1:25:59] what's the difference
[1:26:01] what are the things that separate people
[1:26:03] who are experts and professionals from
[1:26:04] those who are not
[1:26:06] and those same principles apply in the
[1:26:08] spiritual realm
[1:26:10] if you can't find time to pray what does
[1:26:12] that make you
[1:26:13] what's the difference because everybody
[1:26:15] have the same 24 hours
[1:26:17] so it's not as if the pan who is praying
[1:26:19] has more time than you let me say that
[1:26:21] again
[1:26:22] is he same 24 hours
[1:26:25] the man who has the most
[1:26:26] responsibilities and a man with no
[1:26:28] responsibility have the same 24 hours
[1:26:32] they're people with a little small shop
[1:26:34] and they can't figure out how to run
[1:26:36] this workshop
[1:26:37] and have somebody with 800 businesses
[1:26:40] and at the same time i was running this
[1:26:42] company that company that company
[1:26:45] what what is the difference
[1:26:46] is it seemed 24 hours you know
[1:26:50] what they have done they have found ways
[1:26:52] to do more with their time
[1:26:54] they have found ways to prioritize
[1:26:56] what's important but what's not
[1:26:58] they don't have time to waste
[1:27:03] they don't have time to waste and that's
[1:27:04] what this message is about the brand of
[1:27:06] people you say services insanity end
[1:27:08] time
[1:27:09] it's later than we think so if it's
[1:27:11] later than we think it means we need to
[1:27:12] do more with the little time we have
[1:27:14] whatever we are missing we need to get
[1:27:16] it fixed now
[1:27:25] fix your attitude
[1:27:27] fix your spirit
[1:27:29] fix your tone
[1:27:30] fix your approach but i remember when
[1:27:32] you approached god he said i'd rather
[1:27:34] you be wrong in doctrine and right in
[1:27:37] spirit
[1:27:38] than right in doctrine and wrong in
[1:27:41] spirit in the word god rates the
[1:27:43] righteousness of your spirit more than
[1:27:44] your belief because if you have the
[1:27:46] right spirit he could show you things
[1:27:48] that you never saw before but having the
[1:27:50] wrong spirit nothing will open your eyes
[1:27:52] because you have an approach to things
[1:27:53] that will destroy you
[1:27:56] and if that applies in the spiritual
[1:27:57] realm so it isn't natural you could be
[1:28:00] right as the husband any house but you
[1:28:02] have your wrong spirit with it
[1:28:03] oh come on now can i can i come back
[1:28:05] home now
[1:28:06] you could be right as your wife for the
[1:28:08] how would you wrong spirit how god sees
[1:28:10] it the same way
[1:28:18] listen church
[1:28:20] the home issues have to fix
[1:28:24] the issue with parents and children have
[1:28:25] to fix
[1:28:27] between brother and sister have to fix
[1:28:30] between bridge and have to fix
[1:28:32] because these things
[1:28:34] are survive over there
[1:28:36] the kingdom is allergic to that kind of
[1:28:38] thing
[1:28:44] can the church say amen
[1:28:46] i'm not going to make too much longer
[1:28:50] i said can i read a scripture here in
[1:28:51] revelation
[1:28:52] i know thy words that that was neither
[1:28:54] cold nor hot i would the dog would cold
[1:28:56] or hot but because they were lukewarm i
[1:28:59] need a coal no hard i will spew the out
[1:29:01] of my mouth
[1:29:03] and it goes on because that says i am
[1:29:05] rich
[1:29:06] and increased with goods and have need
[1:29:08] of nothing and knoweth not that they are
[1:29:10] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:29:13] blind and naked
[1:29:16] how many people in church right now
[1:29:18] think they have it all
[1:29:20] and have it put together and are on the
[1:29:22] right track
[1:29:24] we'd have time to go into it in the
[1:29:25] service
[1:29:27] but friends if you go to the world and
[1:29:28] you look carefully at how the prophet
[1:29:30] lived
[1:29:32] and how far up we have gone from it from
[1:29:35] our life
[1:29:37] not have any quotes
[1:29:39] not having the books
[1:29:40] not have any tips but in life
[1:29:44] asking what would jesus do
[1:29:46] how would he handle this situation
[1:29:49] how would he deal with this when we hear
[1:29:51] that you couldn't tell the prophet's
[1:29:53] friend from his enemies
[1:29:55] god help us you know
[1:29:57] because we we we know when they're there
[1:30:04] holy prophet humble himself
[1:30:07] look at jesus i shared this before
[1:30:09] jesus the bible said when he went to
[1:30:12] open the scroll after coming off
[1:30:14] from being tested
[1:30:17] and he took the scripture to read the
[1:30:20] spirit of the lord is upon me the bible
[1:30:21] said it was his custom to be in the
[1:30:23] temple
[1:30:24] so it meant that from age 12 to age 30
[1:30:27] jesus was present in every service
[1:30:31] because it was his custom to be in the
[1:30:33] temple
[1:30:35] can they sit home
[1:30:37] so it meant jesus the word made flesh
[1:30:40] sat in church for 18 years
[1:30:44] we call it the 18 years of silence
[1:30:46] and he said nothing
[1:30:48] while priests high priests junior
[1:30:51] priests aspiring priests would read the
[1:30:54] scrolls
[1:30:55] about him and he said nothing
[1:30:57] whether they were right whether they
[1:30:58] were wrong whether they were
[1:31:00] interpreting it whether they were
[1:31:01] injecting their own feelings he sat
[1:31:03] there and did nothing
[1:31:07] can we
[1:31:08] do that
[1:31:11] can we hear people lie about us
[1:31:14] and not respond
[1:31:17] can we watch people tell stuff about us
[1:31:20] that we know is not true or they get in
[1:31:22] the wrong way and not do anything about
[1:31:23] it
[1:31:25] because brother branham spoke about he
[1:31:26] said the spirit of john dillinger is on
[1:31:28] you you'll deliver with everybody say
[1:31:29] we're supposed to be dead to christ
[1:31:31] that whatever people say there's no
[1:31:33] response he's a dead man he said if you
[1:31:35] get up from there and say well that is
[1:31:36] not me you're still alive
[1:31:38] oh only remember that any message right
[1:31:41] so can have you can we reach that point
[1:31:44] where people could say stuff about us
[1:31:46] and we don't respond
[1:31:47] all that is part of have we done enough
[1:31:49] you know
[1:31:53] i'm bringing back to your memory what we
[1:31:56] know already
[1:31:59] have we done
[1:32:01] enough
[1:32:02] so that when we could stand and give an
[1:32:04] account as it were we could say lord and
[1:32:06] i read the scripture from paul i've
[1:32:09] finished my course
[1:32:11] i've run a good race
[1:32:13] i've done all he asked me to do
[1:32:15] and even the prophet felt comfort
[1:32:17] because he said when he was wandering
[1:32:18] about things he said i preach what paul
[1:32:20] preached
[1:32:21] so we are resting on that
[1:32:23] so the prophet in his ministry would
[1:32:24] reach that level of comfort that he did
[1:32:26] what he was supposed to do
[1:32:28] so when he was saying in 1962 was it
[1:32:31] what have i done enough or haven't done
[1:32:33] enough when the prophet left he did
[1:32:34] everything he was supposed to do can the
[1:32:36] church say amen because god don't take a
[1:32:38] man unless his ministry is finished
[1:32:42] where are we standing at friends i'm not
[1:32:43] going to be too much longer
[1:32:46] revelation 3
[1:32:47] we're still there i counter thee to buy
[1:32:50] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:32:52] mayest be rich so he said the people who
[1:32:54] feel they established they're not
[1:32:56] established
[1:32:57] i constantly to buy of me gold tried in
[1:32:59] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:33:02] white raymond that thou mayest be
[1:33:04] clothed because the clothes you have on
[1:33:05] your naked
[1:33:07] and you think you have clothes and you
[1:33:08] don't know it
[1:33:10] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:33:12] appear
[1:33:14] and i know in their eyes when i say that
[1:33:16] on me i see
[1:33:17] as many as i love i rebuke and chase and
[1:33:19] be zealous therefore and repent
[1:33:25] have we done enough
[1:33:27] friends jesus fulfilled the word for his
[1:33:30] d
[1:33:31] brother branham will fill the word for
[1:33:33] his day
[1:33:34] every prophet fulfilled the word for
[1:33:36] their day when jesus came he was more
[1:33:39] than enough
[1:33:41] he was more than enough
[1:33:43] he did more than enough
[1:33:45] against his own will he will always be
[1:33:49] more than enough
[1:33:51] with what he did it was enough to break
[1:33:53] the power of sin forever
[1:33:55] it was enough to to not have to have to
[1:33:58] face death because now paul could say
[1:34:00] grave where is your sting the death way
[1:34:02] is in victory it was more than enough
[1:34:04] when he came he shot them out of the
[1:34:07] devil for all them years and they were
[1:34:08] moving through to satan struggling
[1:34:12] fighting up with this prophet this was
[1:34:13] but when jesus came he brought the
[1:34:15] perfect antidote to the whole sin
[1:34:18] question that started there in genesis
[1:34:20] can the church say amen oh hallelujah
[1:34:24] when jesus came there was nothing else
[1:34:25] that needed to come because he was the
[1:34:27] fullness of what the prophet spoke about
[1:34:29] he was the fullness he was the very
[1:34:31] mystery of god had long been made flesh
[1:34:34] the very presence of god had now been
[1:34:36] made evident can the church say amen and
[1:34:39] when jesus was in his ministry he said
[1:34:41] my always not yet come in other words i
[1:34:43] haven't finished yet my always not here
[1:34:45] come don't touch me don't take me oh
[1:34:48] don't tell nobody about me what was he
[1:34:50] doing he knew what that line was that
[1:34:53] would be enough he was pushing back
[1:34:55] sickness he was pushing back diseases he
[1:34:58] went and took that man called that had
[1:34:59] those demons upon him legion he went to
[1:35:02] the other side to the maniac of gaddara
[1:35:04] as it was he cast out those devils but
[1:35:07] he knew that was not enough
[1:35:08] oh come on now somebody say amen
[1:35:12] oh when jairo's daughter died and she
[1:35:15] came back to life he knew that was not
[1:35:17] enough he was moving towards something
[1:35:20] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[1:35:23] preach back to me the people hungry
[1:35:26] they're hungry he said what you have
[1:35:28] they say what we have is not enough
[1:35:31] oh we only have five loaves and two
[1:35:33] fishes he said bring it i'll make it
[1:35:35] more than enough i can take the little
[1:35:37] that you have and bring you to more than
[1:35:39] enough he took it he prayed for it he
[1:35:42] blessed him he said and when he
[1:35:44] started to share those five loaves and
[1:35:46] two fishes they realized what their
[1:35:48] parents are that it was more than enough
[1:35:51] oh come on somebody preached back to me
[1:35:53] this morning
[1:35:54] oh hallelujah
[1:35:57] hallelujah
[1:35:58] oh
[1:35:59] my my mama you may be seated
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] and you read a true scripture jesus bill
[1:36:06] into something and i've said before he
[1:36:08] didn't come just to heal the sick he
[1:36:10] didn't come just to raise the dead he
[1:36:12] didn't come to heal of the broken heart
[1:36:14] but when jesus was going to calvary and
[1:36:16] they thought he was about to be finished
[1:36:18] he knew he was going to hit that line
[1:36:20] that was going to make his presence
[1:36:22] enough
[1:36:23] oh come on now he knew he was honing in
[1:36:25] under something holding into something
[1:36:27] and when they put him on the cross
[1:36:30] and he said it is finished he knew that
[1:36:32] he had done enough because when he said
[1:36:34] it is finished he met it is enough
[1:36:37] i've done what i came here to do
[1:36:40] oh the sin question is answered when
[1:36:42] they could come for you they can't touch
[1:36:44] you anymore because to get to you they
[1:36:45] have to get through me oh hallelujah by
[1:36:49] his stripes we are now healed when the
[1:36:51] nails are in his hand and his story say
[1:36:53] it is finished
[1:36:55] it was more than enough
[1:36:57] and it still didn't stop there it still
[1:36:59] didn't end there it was not finished
[1:37:02] there because when they put him in the
[1:37:03] grave he was not in the grave he dropped
[1:37:06] them to the lower reasons because he had
[1:37:08] more to do he was not satisfied with
[1:37:11] just the same question being answered he
[1:37:13] wanted to do more than enough he went
[1:37:15] now to hell to where nobody else could
[1:37:17] have gone to do what nobody else could
[1:37:19] have done and took the keys
[1:37:22] took the keys of death
[1:37:23] took the keys of death
[1:37:25] took the keys of death so you could have
[1:37:27] life and have it more abundantly took
[1:37:29] the keys of death so that death has no
[1:37:31] power over the blood washed ones took
[1:37:33] the keys of death that death is now
[1:37:35] subject to us took the keys of death and
[1:37:38] the keys of hell
[1:37:41] oh hallelujah he unlocked those doors he
[1:37:44] unlocked those doors he unlocked those
[1:37:46] doors he unlocked all those doors all
[1:37:49] those who were there who said that's the
[1:37:51] wheel in the middle of the wheel that's
[1:37:53] a rock beneath the rocker he took the
[1:37:55] keys and he opened up every door and
[1:37:57] when the devil tries to put you in jail
[1:37:59] he has no keys to lock you in that jail
[1:38:02] jesus already did that he's not doing it
[1:38:05] and what he did back there is more than
[1:38:07] enough for today he doesn't have to do
[1:38:09] it again it is already done it is
[1:38:12] already finished
[1:38:15] anybody with me
[1:38:17] oh i'm now starting to preach and now
[1:38:19] starting to preach all that is just
[1:38:20] background because we are going to do
[1:38:22] enough we are not going to stay defeated
[1:38:25] we are not going to be halfway
[1:38:26] christians we are not going to be just
[1:38:28] church members just message believers

[1:38:33] daughters of god the sons of god who are
[1:38:35] about to be made manifest

[1:38:59] live also because we made it we're gonna
[1:39:02] make it also

[1:39:21] happen this is our ministry but hashem
[1:39:23] is not just a rapture
[1:39:25] our ministry is not just a wedding
[1:39:27] supper our ministry is not just a
[1:39:29] millennium our ministry is not just rain

[1:39:39] now somebody help me this demon this
[1:39:41] devil this lucifer this principality
[1:39:44] that was cast on our job is to finish
[1:39:47] and god knows that his bride his wife
[1:39:50] will be more than enough
[1:39:53] more than enough
[1:39:54] to take on the works of the devil more
[1:39:56] than enough oh come on now

[1:40:01] are built stronger than you realize the
[1:40:04] seed in your soul is more powerful than
[1:40:06] you realize the word seed in you is
[1:40:09] stronger than you realize
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:14] the devil can't stop it
[1:40:16] the demons can't stop it have we done
[1:40:18] enough we are getting their friends we
[1:40:21] are warming up we are reminding us this
[1:40:23] morning that we can do more that we can
[1:40:26] do better that we can raise above our

[1:40:39] it we haven't done enough but we are
[1:40:41] just getting started
[1:40:43] we are just warming up we are now
[1:40:45] getting ready satan you haven't seen
[1:40:48] anything yet you have not seen anything
[1:40:51] yet there's been churches churches
[1:40:53] prides prize churches prize but there
[1:40:56] must come one with dynamics and
[1:40:58] mechanics together
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:09] hallelujah
[1:41:11] hallelujah
[1:41:13] hallelujah
[1:41:14] so i wanted to shake you for the first
[1:41:17] part of the service for you to realize
[1:41:19] that there's no room for laziness
[1:41:21] there's no room for setting back there's
[1:41:23] no room for a pity party there's no room
[1:41:25] for what happened yesterday there's no
[1:41:27] room for how it used to be it is going
[1:41:29] for whatever black one never the devil
[1:41:32] must see smoke
[1:41:33] smoke because you're moving so fast
[1:41:36] into your position moving so fast into
[1:41:39] your authority move i shall glory
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:49] me
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:11] [Music]
[1:42:12] [Applause]
[1:42:17] oh
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:34] listen
[1:42:36] jesus's first miracle
[1:42:38] didn't move the devil
[1:42:43] his first miracle didn't move the devil
[1:42:45] because the devil was used to miracles
[1:42:47] by the cliff over all the ages you know
[1:42:50] there were many signs
[1:42:52] there were many signs through the ages
[1:42:54] there were many things that took place
[1:42:55] through the ages can the church say amen
[1:42:58] but as jesus ministry began to expand
[1:43:01] and expand
[1:43:02] it's going to get more and more
[1:43:04] instead of reaching critical mass
[1:43:06] that the devil's kingdoms had to go
[1:43:07] haywire he said this is becoming a
[1:43:09] little too much
[1:43:11] the conspiracy to kill jesus came in the
[1:43:14] later part of his ministry
[1:43:16] because it was becoming too much
[1:43:18] it was becoming a bit much
[1:43:26] when jesus died
[1:43:28] the devil thought enough is enough
[1:43:30] he thought it was finished but even that
[1:43:33] in the economy of god was small
[1:43:35] because he was going to reproduce
[1:43:37] himself
[1:43:38] so when jesus died and devil thinking
[1:43:40] it's over
[1:43:41] and in the upper room by the shame and
[1:43:43] they're there for fear
[1:43:45] of what is going on around him
[1:43:47] bear in mind peter and all these
[1:43:50] jesus told peter that you will deny me
[1:43:53] you know how peter would have felt it
[1:44:00] you know you know what i'm feeling this
[1:44:01] bro punch
[1:44:02] after you see all let's say you wanna
[1:44:04] before the cockroach
[1:44:12] anybody not me
[1:44:15] peter didn't realize you see and this is
[1:44:17] it god allows situations to come to show
[1:44:19] your vulnerability without him
[1:44:24] you see you could only know your
[1:44:25] vulnerability when situations come you
[1:44:27] know
[1:44:29] you see you don't know what you don't
[1:44:31] know
[1:44:37] you don't know what you don't know
[1:44:40] that's why you could you must never
[1:44:42] judge people
[1:44:44] because that would never happen to me
[1:44:45] now
[1:44:49] and you don't know where your
[1:44:50] vulnerability is
[1:44:53] and god to protect his kingdom will have
[1:44:56] to expose your vulnerability
[1:44:59] so that it could be protected it is not
[1:45:02] to expose your vulnerability for your
[1:45:04] embarrassment it's for your protection
[1:45:06] because you don't know what you have to
[1:45:07] defend against until it's exposed
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:14] so peter was living under the ministry
[1:45:17] of the greatest
[1:45:19] preacher
[1:45:21] that ever walked here
[1:45:23] and he had a vulnerability he didn't
[1:45:24] even know he had
[1:45:26] let me say that again
[1:45:28] under the greatest ministry that ever
[1:45:29] walked the earth brother
[1:45:31] peter didn't realize how vulnerable he
[1:45:33] was it was with disbelief
[1:45:36] he processed jesus statement that before
[1:45:38] the cockroach three times you'll deny me
[1:45:42] and he didn't believe
[1:45:47] you catching this huh
[1:45:49] so people who say well under this
[1:45:50] ministry or under that ministry honor
[1:45:52] that ministry under the ministry of
[1:45:54] jesus
[1:45:56] peter was still vulnerable
[1:46:01] until when he denied christ the bible
[1:46:03] said he wept bitterly
[1:46:06] in so much that when jesus wrote he said
[1:46:09] go tell my disciples
[1:46:11] and peter
[1:46:14] because peter was a messed up
[1:46:16] he was in a condition
[1:46:20] after being told in matthew 16 dawa
[1:46:22] peter upon this rock and peter feeling
[1:46:24] good then get him i said peter was on an
[1:46:26] emotional roller coaster
[1:46:28] and here it was it's not any of the
[1:46:31] other disciples who deny christ enough
[1:46:33] it's brother peter
[1:46:35] only here but peter
[1:46:39] this man here said you even know jesus
[1:46:43] this was not a separation from the
[1:46:45] revelation or the doctrine this was a
[1:46:47] total denial
[1:46:49] now in scripture this was so because in
[1:46:51] old testament god is really big on if
[1:46:54] you deny me
[1:46:56] the consequence of denial
[1:47:01] because way back you read it there in
[1:47:02] the book of uh the book of joel my
[1:47:05] people shall never be ashamed
[1:47:07] and here it is peter is saying
[1:47:09] i
[1:47:10] what i'm embarrassed i'm not associated
[1:47:12] i don't know who it is so god had a
[1:47:14] special word for peter
[1:47:18] so that peter could be released from the
[1:47:20] guilt of the vulnerability he did not
[1:47:22] know he had
[1:47:24] well you don't hear me
[1:47:27] because god had to deal with it to be
[1:47:29] able to use peter more effectively than
[1:47:31] he was used before
[1:47:36] and that's why so careful you have to be
[1:47:38] because in
[1:47:40] talking peter at that point in his life
[1:47:43] you don't know what peter was going to
[1:47:44] become
[1:47:46] similar you don't know who here is a
[1:47:48] soul that god will make appall
[1:47:52] or jacob who god will make her israel
[1:47:55] only god has that playbook not even his
[1:47:57] prophets could see it unless god wanted
[1:47:59] them to see it so that's why the prophet
[1:48:01] himself had to be so careful when he was
[1:48:04] found himself in the in the restaurant
[1:48:05] or whatever and he looked at the woman
[1:48:07] there with his makeup and he said is
[1:48:08] this the world my daughter will live in
[1:48:10] and grew up in he said i condemn her god
[1:48:12] had to come and talk to the prophet say
[1:48:13] listen let me show you about your life
[1:48:16] even as a prophet let me show you how
[1:48:18] whenever you sin how there's a blood
[1:48:20] bumper that protecting
[1:48:22] what i see about you how could you
[1:48:24] condemn this woman and the love of god
[1:48:27] dropped in his heart god was what was
[1:48:28] you he was exposing the vulnerabilities
[1:48:31] in his profit so he could close the gaps
[1:48:33] he could close the gaps he could find
[1:48:35] all the issues that he could seal it up
[1:48:37] so that this vessel could be properly
[1:48:39] sealed for service
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:46] all of this was leading up and leading
[1:48:48] up so no wonder when the prophet had his
[1:48:50] test and he said he knew it was coming
[1:48:52] and the young people making love in the
[1:48:53] church
[1:48:55] by now the devil is the devil who
[1:48:57] whipped that up
[1:48:58] because god don't order confusion he
[1:49:00] don't order sins
[1:49:01] so god has to allow the devil to do that
[1:49:04] and what the devil does is within his
[1:49:05] confinement to do the same with job
[1:49:07] anybody with me this morning
[1:49:09] and god is now proud like job he could
[1:49:11] say look at my son branham he could deal
[1:49:14] with this test
[1:49:16] and a voice came to the prophet because
[1:49:17] god proven that he was ready for this
[1:49:19] exam he said whatever you say is what
[1:49:21] will happen
[1:49:22] say blindness say whatever is going to
[1:49:24] happen he had the power to do it because
[1:49:26] he had already been sealed up
[1:49:28] and he did what christ would do he said
[1:49:30] i forgive you
[1:49:32] i forgive you
[1:49:34] [Applause]
[1:49:38] you see how much more we have to grow
[1:49:40] how much more we have to expand our
[1:49:42] thinking and our approach
[1:49:44] to see the mind of christ
[1:49:48] have you done enough
[1:49:50] have we done enough
[1:49:52] we are building friends
[1:49:53] we are getting stronger
[1:49:55] but when the devil wants to hold things
[1:49:57] over you and this is where we want to
[1:49:58] kind of set you free now
[1:50:01] to condemn you and say well you didn't
[1:50:02] do this and he didn't do that he didn't
[1:50:03] do that
[1:50:05] this is why the word comes to open your
[1:50:07] eyes up to see that your world that you
[1:50:10] think you're in is so small
[1:50:13] what you do is break out the world that
[1:50:15] you are in into a realm because that's
[1:50:17] what spiritual measure is spiritual
[1:50:19] amnesia is a condition that you forget
[1:50:21] who you are
[1:50:23] you are now limited like sarah by your
[1:50:26] own understanding
[1:50:28] and spiritual amnesia separates you from
[1:50:30] god's understanding about you
[1:50:32] so you're there living thinking that
[1:50:34] this is my condition this is my sickness
[1:50:36] this is my trial this is my problem i'm
[1:50:39] going to break above that and tell you
[1:50:41] that you have the strength to put that
[1:50:42] under your feet
[1:50:44] it's just waiting for you to put it
[1:50:45] under your feet
[1:50:47] it's not even god to put it on the nose
[1:50:49] you put it under your feet because he
[1:50:51] said the moment the bride gets to know
[1:50:52] who she is and the rapture will go so
[1:50:54] there's this thing that's separating an
[1:50:56] awareness of who you are in god that has
[1:50:58] to be broken and the preaching of the
[1:51:00] world is a destroyed doubt
[1:51:02] the preaching of the word is to destroy
[1:51:04] unbelief that's what the preaching of
[1:51:06] the word is for so we are coming this
[1:51:08] morning against doubt against unbelief
[1:51:11] because some of you think your sickness
[1:51:12] you're going to have it for much longer
[1:51:14] and i want to let you know that we're
[1:51:15] preaching against that doubt and
[1:51:16] unbelief to say that sickness has got to
[1:51:18] go and we are serving notice on the
[1:51:22] sickness we are serving notice on every
[1:51:24] problem we are saving notice in every
[1:51:26] situation and we are here to preach
[1:51:29] against the doubt that that will change
[1:51:31] we are saying it has to change it must
[1:51:33] change it will change because we will do
[1:51:36] enough and more than enough to change
[1:51:38] our world to change our situation to
[1:51:41] change our circumstances
[1:51:44] could you take some more i'm trying to
[1:51:45] wrap up somewhere
[1:51:47] can i all over some
[1:51:50] i don't know how this
[1:51:51] this message i'm in
[1:51:53] i think i have too much quotes
[1:51:56] but clarence if i show my notes on page
[1:51:58] 16 of 123.
[1:52:02] i think i think i accompany five twice
[1:52:10] have we done enough
[1:52:12] can we do more
[1:52:14] i want to challenge you church what more
[1:52:15] will he do this week
[1:52:18] and before i get to this week what more
[1:52:20] you'll do today
[1:52:23] today what more will you do today
[1:52:26] what change will we make today you see a
[1:52:28] lot of people don't realize that success
[1:52:30] in anything spiritual and it's
[1:52:32] scriptural you know meditate on the word
[1:52:34] day and night
[1:52:36] and you have good success that's a
[1:52:37] formula
[1:52:38] do you know what happens if you live by
[1:52:40] that formula
[1:52:41] day and night mentally with day and
[1:52:42] night and you have good success
[1:52:44] so before you deal with tomorrow
[1:52:46] what are you doing today
[1:52:48] and when you could live each day saying
[1:52:50] i did my best today
[1:52:53] is there anybody can say they did their
[1:52:54] best yesterday is there anybody in this
[1:52:56] room because i did my i know i do my
[1:52:58] absolute best
[1:53:00] yesterday was incredible i did my best
[1:53:03] when i look at
[1:53:05] my efforts and i recognize i really
[1:53:06] ordered my daisy when i already spent
[1:53:08] time with the wood and i pray and i did
[1:53:10] my family duties and i did this i went
[1:53:11] to the grocery but when i look at the
[1:53:13] day i really find it hard i had to find
[1:53:15] a way to improve i kind it's hard to
[1:53:17] find a room for improvement i know it
[1:53:19] has to be there but it's hard
[1:53:22] anybody
[1:53:27] that's the conversation i want you to
[1:53:29] have with yourself every day
[1:53:32] what could i improve today
[1:53:35] what can i improve what what what what
[1:53:37] what can i do better tomorrow to be a
[1:53:38] better husband
[1:53:41] back in the house again
[1:53:43] what what what what can they do tomorrow
[1:53:45] to be a better wife you know that is
[1:53:46] what christianity is about
[1:53:49] it's not always you're noting and it's
[1:53:51] not producing in your life what can to
[1:53:53] be a better worker in a world that
[1:53:54] people could see the life of christ in
[1:53:56] me
[1:53:57] anybody with me anybody with me
[1:54:00] how can i live in my neighborhood i want
[1:54:02] people next door look and say oh you're
[1:54:04] so happy oh yeah
[1:54:06] what can you do different
[1:54:10] because if your life not showing a light
[1:54:13] of bubble that people could get
[1:54:14] attracted to then how you intend to win
[1:54:17] coined the fish people see you there you
[1:54:19] just depress you you you can't leave the
[1:54:21] service depression
[1:54:24] people wonder where you went
[1:54:30] and even on your job you can have a hard
[1:54:31] drive but the bible say do all they do
[1:54:33] unto the lord
[1:54:34] so when i say there's no room for
[1:54:36] execute we're saying boy my boss the
[1:54:38] devil boss the devil boss that's not
[1:54:39] scripture no no no
[1:54:42] that is not bible enough
[1:54:44] let's say whatever work you do do it
[1:54:46] unto the lord or no
[1:54:48] even if the devil using your boss
[1:54:50] your work is a sacrifice unto the lord
[1:54:54] so you have no reason leaving you
[1:54:55] stomping already working this devil i
[1:54:57] can't wait to go to rapture because you
[1:54:58] reason you want to go up because you
[1:54:59] want to get away from the boss
[1:55:07] i want to help your church it's the
[1:55:09] practical life because that is where
[1:55:11] brother
[1:55:12] church this is where people miss it you
[1:55:14] know
[1:55:15] on sundays people come to church and
[1:55:16] they feel good about the lord and then
[1:55:18] do any week
[1:55:19] but he gave his lips
[1:55:24] wasn't the prophet that when the call
[1:55:26] came for him he went outside the house
[1:55:28] and he said tell them i'm not home
[1:55:31] and god was so upset with that
[1:55:34] we call it no docking calls
[1:55:37] don't let me get down into the realm
[1:55:40] don't let me come down to
[1:55:43] you see a miscourt listen this thing i
[1:55:46] heard somebody say yesterday it is in
[1:55:47] these simple things or christianity is
[1:55:49] tested
[1:55:52] hey i'll call you and i'm thinking well
[1:55:54] i see him scott you know very well he
[1:55:56] saw nicole
[1:56:02] now people say well don't go there don't
[1:56:04] keep pushing don't drive down that road
[1:56:07] don't drive down the road
[1:56:09] hit the reverse gear fast
[1:56:13] my phone had so much cause i i somehow
[1:56:15] he phoned
[1:56:17] you every year this one the phone now
[1:56:18] working
[1:56:20] because trying to avoid a miscall how
[1:56:22] would that imagine the prophet had a
[1:56:23] cell phone
[1:56:24] here was he said tell them i'm not home
[1:56:27] and god said listen that behavior can't
[1:56:30] work
[1:56:33] because all lies
[1:56:35] have a father
[1:56:41] have we done enough
[1:56:43] have you done enough have i done enough
[1:56:46] friends we coming down to our life
[1:56:50] i heard somebody saying recently you
[1:56:52] know god dispatches angels scripturally
[1:56:54] to protect you
[1:56:57] but the proximity of the angels is a
[1:57:00] function of your life
[1:57:02] so the angels are protecting you you
[1:57:03] know but you see whenever you do things
[1:57:06] that not pleasing to god
[1:57:07] it creates a friction with the angels
[1:57:11] because the angels are attracted to the
[1:57:12] holiness
[1:57:13] they are they serve a holy god
[1:57:15] they attracted a holy light in you that
[1:57:17] you didn't put there
[1:57:19] that's why i said grieve not the holy
[1:57:20] spirit that word grieving her but it's
[1:57:22] the offending holy spirit and you offend
[1:57:24] the holy spirit with your words with
[1:57:26] your actions with you even your thoughts
[1:57:29] because that your thoughts are louder in
[1:57:31] heaven and your words
[1:57:34] so we are walking now into a closer walk
[1:57:37] with have i am i living already this
[1:57:39] thing this message
[1:57:44] am i in the message is the message
[1:57:45] already in me
[1:57:47] is a different question
[1:57:50] i can ask the question are you in the
[1:57:51] message
[1:57:52] is the message in you
[1:57:54] because if the message is in you it will
[1:57:56] reflect itself
[1:57:58] because we are moving towards a
[1:58:00] destination of perfection
[1:58:01] so i would expect
[1:58:03] because it's a process
[1:58:05] walk before me and be thou perfect that
[1:58:07] walk means now it's a movement it's a
[1:58:09] it's a movement towards the perfection
[1:58:12] so but i would expect whether he could
[1:58:14] have every service you come every week
[1:58:15] that passed you're getting more and more
[1:58:16] like him until one day when you look in
[1:58:18] the mirror you'll recognize vietnam
[1:58:21] i see jesus looking back
[1:58:23] so every service for us is an
[1:58:25] opportunity for us to do an assessment
[1:58:27] like the prophet did
[1:58:28] i haven't done enough
[1:58:31] so you must leave the service saying i
[1:58:32] have more to do i have more work to do i
[1:58:36] have to improve anybody who live in
[1:58:37] their scene are ready
[1:58:40] you recognize you're missing it
[1:58:42] come the church see him and the musician
[1:58:43] can get ready
[1:58:46] trying to wear the clothes out
[1:58:49] is this helping anybody
[1:58:56] no in our day it is expected for us to
[1:58:58] do our part
[1:59:00] it is expected of us to meet the
[1:59:01] challenge of the hour it is expected of
[1:59:04] us to be able to answer the question
[1:59:06] with a resounding yes we have done
[1:59:08] enough
[1:59:10] just like paul to timothy i have fought
[1:59:12] a good fight
[1:59:13] i have finished my course i have kept
[1:59:15] the faith
[1:59:17] henceforth days later to me a crown of
[1:59:19] righteousness which the lord the
[1:59:21] righteous judge shall give me at that
[1:59:22] day and not to me only but unto all them
[1:59:26] also that love his appearing
[1:59:30] so paul was able to reach that place
[1:59:32] just as brother branham was able to
[1:59:33] reach his own spot where he knew he did
[1:59:35] what god called him to do
[1:59:38] and friends i want to encourage you in
[1:59:39] this service
[1:59:41] if you have a revelation
[1:59:43] of what god called you to do and you
[1:59:45] should be able to look at yourself
[1:59:47] look at the word concerning you and know
[1:59:49] where you line up
[1:59:50] i'm not in a position to mark your
[1:59:52] papers
[1:59:53] you have to be in a position to look at
[1:59:55] the syllabus the curriculum at the exam
[1:59:57] and say lord i recognize i do have the
[1:59:59] holy ghost i recognize i do have
[2:00:00] patience i recognize that i answered
[2:00:02] back i recognize i've been disrespectful
[2:00:03] i recognize i've been praying and lord i
[2:00:05] come today to rededicate my life i
[2:00:07] continue to reboot my system my computer
[2:00:10] end up with a virus you see this
[2:00:11] coronavirus my life have a virus and i
[2:00:13] want to i want to get the antivirus in
[2:00:15] this service which is the holy ghost i
[2:00:17] want to get in the presence the
[2:00:18] atmosphere of god that i could not be
[2:00:20] more dedicated more consecrated more
[2:00:23] separated can the church see amen
[2:00:27] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my in
[2:00:31] recognizing your day and this message
[2:00:33] you could begin to play something swap
[2:00:34] three remember in my vision this is the
[2:00:37] prophet now beginning to speak and hint
[2:00:39] to the closer of his ministry begin to
[2:00:41] hint at what he had already achieved and
[2:00:43] accomplished undergo he said if paul's
[2:00:46] people goes in look at the confidence so
[2:00:48] will mine hallelujah he said if paul's
[2:00:51] people went in so will mine because i'd
[2:00:54] done just exactly like he did
[2:00:56] i'm staying right with it
[2:00:58] their millions through their hands
[2:01:00] saying we are resting on that what
[2:01:02] recognize the day that we are living the
[2:01:03] time we are living the sign of the time
[2:01:05] that we are living in
[2:01:07] listen to the prophet this is now 64 now
[2:01:11] it may be later than we think
[2:01:13] one of these days
[2:01:15] let him that's outside
[2:01:17] stay outside still
[2:01:20] he that's inside must forever be inside
[2:01:22] still
[2:01:23] the door will close
[2:01:25] he said if there's some here this
[2:01:27] morning that hasn't never walked in yet
[2:01:28] oh in jesus name my dear people
[2:01:31] don't look at this ignorant servant
[2:01:34] standing here speaking about himself
[2:01:36] illiterate unlearned uneducated don't
[2:01:39] look at that but look at the word that's
[2:01:41] been proven
[2:01:42] look at the great holy spirit who
[2:01:44] vindicated to be the truth we are the
[2:01:46] evening time it's later than you think
[2:01:48] women let your hair grow sister please
[2:01:51] take off them dirty clothes throw them
[2:01:53] cigarettes away for the hour will come
[2:01:55] that he that's filthy let him be filthy
[2:01:57] still and he that's righteous let him be
[2:01:59] righteous to him he that's inside is
[2:02:01] inside he's that outsider outside that
[2:02:03] little closed margin if a righteous man
[2:02:06] will clearly be saved where will the
[2:02:08] sinner and go ungodly appear
[2:02:10] where will they appear
[2:02:12] where will they appear friends
[2:02:16] as we look through the ages i'm closing
[2:02:17] out
[2:02:20] we had luther
[2:02:22] and luther brought a message of
[2:02:23] justification
[2:02:26] and then when wesley came
[2:02:29] the message that luther had was no
[2:02:30] longer enough
[2:02:33] it could no longer make the cut
[2:02:35] because the season had changed
[2:02:38] and if you had stayed in that day just
[2:02:40] like acts 19 he said have you received
[2:02:42] the holy ghost since you believe
[2:02:44] he said we we're we are nobody's thing
[2:02:46] called the holy ghost he said unto what
[2:02:48] we are baptized under john's baptism so
[2:02:50] those there were still living in the old
[2:02:53] age so so to speak
[2:02:55] and the same way that when wesley came
[2:02:56] it meant what luther brought was no
[2:02:58] longer
[2:02:59] when the pentecostals came it meant that
[2:03:01] what wesley brought was no longer enough
[2:03:03] and whenever the brahmana came it meant
[2:03:04] what the pentecostal had was no longer
[2:03:06] enough
[2:03:08] but now in this age this message is more
[2:03:10] than enough
[2:03:11] because it pulls up from all the ages
[2:03:15] and the prophet can scream on behold the
[2:03:16] bridegroom comment
[2:03:18] go you out to meet him in other words
[2:03:20] you have everything available to you to
[2:03:23] get ready
[2:03:24] will you be ready
[2:03:26] will you be ready have you done enough
[2:03:28] to be ready
[2:03:29] was the cry that went out
[2:03:33] the call the call the call to leave the
[2:03:35] quarter
[2:03:36] [Music]
[2:03:38] but before that time of going friends
[2:03:40] this is the call before that call
[2:03:44] the call to rededicate your life the
[2:03:45] call to make things right the call to
[2:03:48] leave all your burdens your cares your
[2:03:50] worries and to and to separate yourself
[2:03:52] today
[2:03:53] we can't change yesterday but today you
[2:03:55] can make a decision lord i'm going all
[2:03:57] the way
[2:03:58] all the way
[2:03:59] all the way let's all stand to our feet
[2:04:09] every head bowed every eye closed
[2:04:14] lord this simple message
[2:04:18] lord to challenge your people have we
[2:04:20] done enough
[2:04:24] lord is there more that we could do is
[2:04:26] there more that we should do is there
[2:04:28] more we could do lord
[2:04:30] lord and we can all answer the question
[2:04:32] lord yes
[2:04:33] yes we need to do more
[2:04:36] oh god may you move through the house
[2:04:38] today and touch every heart every life
[2:04:40] those on the internet father lord
[2:04:44] lord god that we could take another look
