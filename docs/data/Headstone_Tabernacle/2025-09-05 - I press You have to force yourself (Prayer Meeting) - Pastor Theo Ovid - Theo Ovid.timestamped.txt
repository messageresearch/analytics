[0:06] Lord, we thank you for this time that we

[4:41] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he

[15:19] brother Steven to your hand that you

[15:21] head to the sole of his feet sister Don
[15:23] key that you will touch him in a special
[15:25] way. Father God in a special way and I
[15:28] pray for my friend Lord brother Solomon
[15:31] Aina that you will touch him in a
[15:32] special way in God that you would raise
[15:34] him up in good health and strength that
[15:36] he have a speedy recovery granted God as
[15:39] we approach your word tonight. May your
[15:41] presence be with us speak to us and may
[15:44] draw our hearts closer to you longing
[15:45] for you. Granted, God in Jesus name I
[15:47] ask it. Amen. And amen. So, God bless
[15:51] you and
[15:53] uh
[15:54] we would like to go to the word tonight.
[15:58] Um I'm going to take two portion of
[15:59] scripture. Philippians chapter 3 verse
[16:02] 14 and Luke chapter 16 verse 16.
[16:06] Philippians chapter 3 verse 14.
[16:11] And Luke 16.
[16:15] We read Philippians 3. This is Paul
[16:17] speaks. I press toward the mark for the
[16:21] prize
[16:23] of the high calling of God
[16:26] in Christ Jesus.
[16:29] And Luke 16:16, the law and the prophet
[16:32] were until John since that time the
[16:36] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[16:39] pressth
[16:41] into it. Now we have used the scripture
[16:44] several times. We have preached on
[16:47] pressing into it and so like that. But
[16:48] tonight I want to take a different
[16:50] approach to it. I have a title I press
[16:53] slash you have to force yourself.
[16:58] That's the emphasis there. You have to
[17:01] force yourself.
[17:04] Press means to steady to push to trust.
[17:10] It means to continue to move forward and
[17:13] to go through in a forceful way,
[17:17] persevering with all you've got.
[17:20] Pressing means going past your comfort
[17:23] zone. People like to stay safe in their
[17:28] safe zone, in their comfort zone.
[17:32] You hear us speak about building muscles
[17:35] in the gym, lifting weights. Sometimes
[17:38] if you live the same weight all the
[17:40] time, you wouldn't really get far. You
[17:42] need to keep increasing the weight to
[17:45] put strain and stress and that is where
[17:49] the muscles is built. Now, brother
[17:52] Brandon said this here about the cry for
[17:56] revival. It's it's it's wonderful to
[17:59] hear that. And he said, remember in
[18:01] amidst all all this cry, God can't send
[18:04] a revival until he got man in shape to
[18:07] take it. We cannot have a revival until
[18:10] we get God called men. God trained men
[18:14] that is not trained in a school of
[18:16] theology. Rugged men of fate that God
[18:19] has brought up in the school of his
[18:20] rugged training. Men who are not afraid
[18:22] to face the fire. man who has come into
[18:26] the presence of God and knows his power
[18:28] and knows his omnipotence and knows his
[18:31] healing power. Some men are trained to
[18:33] know the living God. It's all right to
[18:35] train them by the word but the letter
[18:37] killth. The spirit giveth life. But
[18:40] listen to the point I want to get here.
[18:41] And many people praying for revival. I
[18:45] wonder if sometimes if those are those
[18:48] who are praying if their own prayers
[18:51] don't stop up the wells of blessing.
[18:53] Listen to these words. People are
[18:56] praying and he's asking if their own
[19:00] prayers don't stop up the wells of
[19:03] blessing when they are cowardly and
[19:07] afraid to trust God. Afraid to take him
[19:11] at his word. Afraid to believe that he
[19:15] still lives today when the Bible plainly
[19:18] says he's the same yesterday, today, and
[19:21] forever.
[19:22] Now
[19:25] he said desperation
[19:28] and remember he gave the story about the
[19:30] woman who had a dead baby in Mexico and
[19:33] she was she hold on to a baby and she
[19:36] wasn't letting anybody take that baby.
[19:37] She was trying to get to him. She's
[19:39] speaking Spanish. I'm not sure if she
[19:41] knew who brother really was. But all she
[19:43] wanted to get is to the platform and
[19:45] they tried to stop her. She passed
[19:46] through legs. They had a whole havoc
[19:48] going on there with that woman. But she
[19:50] was desperate. She wanted that baby
[19:52] raised from the dead and her desperation
[19:56] caused heaven to respond and Baram saw a
[19:59] vision of the baby smiling. Then he
[20:01] said, "Bring that lady to me." And of
[20:03] course the story is raised from the
[20:05] dead. So he's saying here desperation
[20:08] when thou seekest me with all thine
[20:10] heart then I'll hear you. The kingdom
[20:14] words from desperation. The law and the
[20:16] prophets were until John. Since then,
[20:20] the kingdom of heaven has been preached
[20:23] and man pressed into it. Then he said
[20:26] these words, "You don't just stand
[20:29] around and say, "Pick me up by the
[20:32] color, Lord. Push me in." You press into
[20:36] it. You get desperate between life and
[20:40] death. So to press is to act upon
[20:45] through a steady pushing a trusting
[20:48] force. That is what press said the law
[20:51] and the prophets were until John. Since
[20:53] that time the kingdom of God is preached
[20:58] and every man pressth into it. Now that
[21:01] word press is a word, a Greek verb
[21:03] called bazo meaning to use force,
[21:08] to press, to seize violently,
[21:12] to constrain. And that same word is a
[21:15] word used in Matthew 11:12.
[21:18] The kingdom of heaven suffer violence
[21:21] and the violent take it by force. So
[21:25] this is not a casual
[21:28] passive approach to the gospel or a
[21:31] casual passive approach to a Christian
[21:34] war. Jesus is saying you want the
[21:37] kingdom you press. You want the kingdom
[21:39] you push. You want the kingdom you
[21:42] force. And forcing means you are coming
[21:45] against resistance. Now I know a lot of
[21:48] people don't like the word confrontation
[21:51] and they fight to avoid confrontation
[21:52] and whatnot. Confrontation is part of
[21:54] life, part of how we have to deal with.
[21:57] And you cannot really defeat what you
[22:00] are not prepared to confront. And the
[22:02] first person you need to confront is
[22:05] yourself.
[22:07] That is the first person you need to
[22:08] confront confront you.
[22:12] And the woman with the blood issue. That
[22:15] woman,
[22:17] you know,
[22:18] seeing it from this perspective, you
[22:20] have to force yourself. She told herself
[22:24] if I could just touch his mouth. Let me
[22:26] just read it here in Mark 5. Certain
[22:29] woman which had a certain blood 12 years
[22:31] had suffered many things, many position.
[22:33] I'll skip down quickly. She heard of
[22:34] Jesus. Watch these words. She had heard
[22:38] of Jesus
[22:39] came in the press behind
[22:42] and touch his garment. And she said, "If
[22:46] I may touch, but his clothes I shall
[22:50] behold." And straightway the fountain of
[22:53] her blood was dried up. And she felt her
[22:56] body that she was healed of that plague.
[22:59] Jesus immediately knowing himself that
[23:01] virtue had gone on from him, turned him
[23:03] about in the press, and said, "Who
[23:05] touched my clothes?" And this disciples
[23:08] disciples said unto him, "Thou seeest
[23:10] the multitude throng in thee, and see as
[23:11] thou who touch me?" And he look around
[23:14] to see her that had done this thing. And
[23:17] the woman fearing, trembling, knowing
[23:19] what was done in her, came and fell down
[23:22] before him, and told him all the truth.
[23:25] And he said unto her, "Daughter, thy
[23:28] feet have made thee whole. Go in peace,
[23:31] and behold of thy plague." So she
[23:35] pressed through the crowd.
[23:38] She pressed through despite her
[23:39] weakness. She pressed through besides
[23:42] her shame and there was a law concerning
[23:45] when you are in your periods or your
[23:47] monthlies or you're going through this
[23:49] blood issue. You're not supposed to go
[23:50] that way.
[23:53] But she purposed that her condition was
[23:56] so grave that she had was to force
[23:59] herself. And forcing herself means going
[24:02] against the grain. What people will
[24:04] think, what people would feel,
[24:08] that is what we're talking about. Are
[24:09] you prepared tonight to force yourself
[24:12] to pray, to force yourself to do
[24:14] something different? You know, like the
[24:15] doctor will say, "Okay, you're getting
[24:17] elderly. You still need to exercise. You
[24:19] still need to walk, but you don't feel
[24:21] like walking." But if you push yourself
[24:23] and force yourself, your body will get
[24:25] some activity in it that will get get a
[24:28] little ease, a little smooth. But
[24:29] there's a little hump to go over.
[24:31] There's a little resistance to go over.
[24:33] Look at this one here. There's one that
[24:35] be familiar with is one I love. Mark 10
[24:38] speaking about blind Batimus. Mark
[24:40] 10:46. And they came to Jericho and the
[24:43] disciples a great number of people blind
[24:45] Batimus sat by the highway begging. So
[24:48] he is in his comfort zone. He's blind.
[24:51] Your accustom waiting there with his
[24:53] bucket or whatever it is. He's begging
[24:55] normal, no fancy stuff. Then verse 47,
[25:00] he heard it was Jesus of Nazareth. And
[25:04] they begin to cry out, "Jesus, thou son
[25:07] of David, have mercy upon me." Now Jesus
[25:09] was some distance away, another street,
[25:11] whatever. And Jesus couldn't hear him
[25:13] physically.
[25:15] And many, there's a part now you
[25:17] believers, listen to this. Many charged
[25:19] him. He's not one person saying, "Hash
[25:21] him out. Hold your peace. Keep quiet."
[25:22] Many charged him that he should hold his
[25:25] peace. But he cried to Moore a great
[25:29] deal. Thou son of David,
[25:32] have mercy on me. He forced himself. He
[25:35] forced himself despite criticism. He
[25:37] forced himself despite the many saying
[25:40] the same thing that he should get quiet.
[25:44] He want to believe he gave wild. He want
[25:46] to carry on like that. Um you know keep
[25:49] it take it easy and so on like that. Um
[25:52] how do you say supreme power and
[25:54] control? He was blind. You can't gain
[25:57] that scripture. Keep it easy. Keep it
[25:59] quiet. He begin to cry out. And I want
[26:02] to challenge you tonight to force
[26:04] yourself.
[26:05] And Jesus stood still and commanded him
[26:09] to be caught. So his forcing himself in
[26:13] fate, forcing himself in crying out
[26:16] affected him, give heaven give a
[26:19] response through Jesus. And Jesus sent
[26:22] for him. And they called the blind man,
[26:24] saying unto him, "Be of good comfort.
[26:26] Rise." He called for thee. and he
[26:30] casting away his garment which will be
[26:33] his beggar's garment because you don't
[26:35] beg in jacket and tie you don't beg in
[26:37] in fancy clothes you beg in beggar's
[26:40] garments that people will give he rose
[26:43] and came to Jesus
[26:46] and Jesus answered said unto him what
[26:51] will thou that I should do unto thee I
[26:53] think some other prayer service we
[26:55] touched this the blind man said Lord
[26:57] that I might receive
[26:59] my sight. And Jesus said unto him, "Go
[27:00] thy way. Thy faith had made thee whole."
[27:02] And immediately you receive his sight
[27:05] and follow Jesus in the way. Now when
[27:09] you look at this, the question arises,
[27:12] how much faith do we have? Are we
[27:15] fooling around with unbelief? What I
[27:17] will call unconscious unbelief. In other
[27:20] words, the unbelief that you're not
[27:22] aware of unconscious unbelief. Because
[27:25] faith has a behavior. Faith has a
[27:30] response. Faith is not talk. Faith is
[27:33] not saying I believe. Faith has action
[27:37] to go with it. So this blind Batimus
[27:41] forced himself
[27:43] beyond his critics or his people trying
[27:47] to hinder him, beyond the ridicule. Uh
[27:50] keep quiet, not so loud. and he cried
[27:54] louder and Jesus responded.
[27:58] Let's do another one in Mark 2.
[28:02] He entered Capernaum. This one after
[28:05] some days there was noise that he was in
[28:07] the house and straightway many were
[28:10] gathered together in so much that there
[28:11] was no room to receive them, not so much
[28:15] as about the door. And he preached the
[28:17] word unto them. And they came unto him
[28:20] bringing one sick of the paly which was
[28:23] born of four. So four men carrying a
[28:25] man's friend sick. And when they could
[28:29] not come nigh unto him for the press,
[28:31] they uncovered the roof where he was.
[28:34] And when they had broken it up, they let
[28:37] down the bed wherein the sick of the
[28:40] palace lay. And when Jesus saw their
[28:42] feet, this is what we talking about.
[28:45] They force themselves not to say okay it
[28:48] is crowded we'll come back another day
[28:50] we'll come back another night when the
[28:52] Bible says no faith is I am telling you
[28:56] tonight could be your night right in
[28:58] your home right in quietness right in
[29:01] there's nobody else around something
[29:04] could strike something could change
[29:06] something could flip that changes your
[29:09] perspective that you could push and you
[29:12] could force yourself so Jesus saw their
[29:14] faith it. So this forcing, this
[29:17] pressing, this pushing beyond your
[29:19] comfort zone or pushing beyond how you
[29:22] feel. Well, let's pray quiet and let's
[29:24] pray this way and you're accustomed with
[29:26] this. And this is where you have to try
[29:29] to go past your comfort zone. If you
[29:31] don't reach out to people, begin to
[29:32] reach out. If you don't greet people,
[29:35] greet people. If you don't say hello and
[29:38] communicate, try words will come to your
[29:40] mouth. do what needs to be done because
[29:42] this thing about not forcing yourself is
[29:45] what have so many people in what you
[29:48] call it um when you keep uh putting off
[29:51] things I forget the names
[29:54] uh
[29:56] where you keep you know you keep putting
[29:58] off putting off putting off putting off
[30:00] there's a word just that comes to my
[30:02] mind right now but when you keep putting
[30:04] off stuff that you're supposed to do
[30:06] this forcing yourself it challenges you
[30:10] to do what needs to be done regardless
[30:14] of your feelings, your emotions, your
[30:17] condition. It has to be done. And this
[30:21] is where procrastinate. Somebody said
[30:23] it. Oh, thank you. Thank you, sister.
[30:26] That is the word. This
[30:29] is a curse that affects people and
[30:33] procrastinate. And when you
[30:34] procrastinate, the things pile up. Now
[30:38] in in dealing with I think um not
[30:41] purchasing a house but fixing a house
[30:43] they say try to do the most expensive
[30:45] thing first and then you go down from
[30:46] there. So you do the expensive thing and
[30:48] you go down small and low. If we take
[30:50] that and apply it to what we need to do,
[30:54] you do what is pressing and what is
[30:57] looking so hard. You have to get it done
[31:00] because when you keep putting on doing
[31:02] petty things, minor things, all kind of
[31:04] things. You're busy busy busy, but
[31:06] you're not getting to the thing you need
[31:08] to get done. And this is where I am
[31:12] challenge you tonight about seeking
[31:14] first the kingdom. Put things in order.
[31:18] put things right. And we we know the
[31:21] story about this guy, right? I'm going
[31:23] to skip this. The last story I have here
[31:25] is one we familiar with is Jacob.
[31:29] Genesis 32. I want to read from 24.
[31:32] Jacob was left alone. Many times I spoke
[31:35] about that people like the crowd. They
[31:37] like the friends like the environment,
[31:39] young people and whatnot. And they don't
[31:41] have time to examine themselves.
[31:44] You go with the flow. You go with the
[31:46] talk. You go with the atmosphere. you go
[31:48] with what is you know what you think is
[31:50] meaningful. But when Jacob was le left
[31:53] alone, and they wrestled a man with him
[31:56] until the breaking of the day.
[31:59] And when he saw that he prevailed not
[32:03] against him, he touched the hollow of
[32:05] his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's
[32:08] thie was out of joint, and he wrestled
[32:11] with him. And he said, "Let me go, for
[32:14] the day break it." And he said, "I will
[32:16] not let you go except you bless me."
[32:20] This is a man that is desperate. He's
[32:23] afraid of Esau, his brother. Esau want
[32:26] to kill him. He sent his wives all
[32:28] different ways and so like that. He is
[32:31] scared. He is wealthy and frightened. He
[32:34] is powerful and frightened. He's not
[32:37] safe. And here it is. He have an angelic
[32:40] encounter.
[32:42] And he's not satisfied just to be in the
[32:44] presence of an angel. He is looking for
[32:47] transformation. And he uttered these
[32:49] words. I will not let you go until you
[32:53] bless me. And to think that a human
[32:56] being, a man wrestled with an angel
[33:00] because of the depth of his desperation
[33:03] in so much that he refused to let go. It
[33:06] speaks volumes.
[33:08] Jacob forced himself to win that fight.
[33:12] And he said, "Thy name shall be no more
[33:14] Jacob, but Israel. For as a prince thou
[33:18] has power with God and with men and has
[33:20] prevailed.
[33:22] So Jacob fought all night pressing
[33:25] through the fear of Esau, pressing
[33:28] through the ex the exhaustion
[33:31] until he got a name change.
[33:34] To press, listen, is to force oneself.
[33:39] I don't want to see press as a exhorting
[33:42] word or a scriptural terminology. press.
[33:45] I press towards the mark as a as a
[33:47] phrase. I want you to see it different
[33:49] tonight. To press
[33:53] is to force oneself.
[33:56] Hear me church. To exert effort,
[34:00] to push beyond resistance,
[34:04] to push beyond ridicule,
[34:08] to push beyond the laughter of your
[34:13] critics.
[34:15] Now
[34:18] I say I have one more here. Esther
[34:22] Esther
[34:24] had to force herself. Almost done. The
[34:26] very simple lesson tonight. Esther had
[34:30] to force herself because she is queen.
[34:35] And when Mori was fasting
[34:38] and it was a s is a was that a signal
[34:42] something is wrong and he had to tell
[34:45] her do you think you in your comfort
[34:49] zone you in that position
[34:52] you in that place that you'll be safe
[34:55] from what is happening listen
[34:59] you got to adjust
[35:01] you got to force yourself I know the
[35:04] rules The rules is you cannot go into
[35:07] the presence of the king unless you are
[35:09] called.
[35:10] But the need was great. A people was
[35:13] about to be destroyed. And Esther had a
[35:17] choice like you tonight. Esther had to
[35:21] make a decision herself. Modi couldn't
[35:23] do it for her. Nobody else could do it
[35:26] for her. She had was to decide whether
[35:29] this thing was worth it life or death to
[35:32] force herself. and she did it. The Bible
[35:35] said, he said, "Go gather to get all the
[35:37] Jews that are present at Shushan and
[35:39] fast for me." So Esther was looking to
[35:43] appeal to heaven. Esther was fasting to
[35:46] get amplified prayer. Esther wasn't just
[35:49] looking for flesh and blood. She was
[35:50] looking for the supernatural element
[35:52] that would have made the difference. She
[35:54] said, "Neither
[35:56] eat nor drink three days, night or day.
[36:00] I also and my maidens will fast likewise
[36:05] and so will I go in unto the king which
[36:08] is not according to the law. And this is
[36:10] the verse here. If I perish, I perish.
[36:13] Now Esther was convinced that this
[36:17] challenge before her was worth forcing
[36:19] herself. What do you see tonight?
[36:23] What do you see as what challenge
[36:24] tonight? How could I inspire you or get
[36:28] you or motivate you? How could this word
[36:31] inspire you to force yourself to do
[36:33] better? Forces yourself to be a better
[36:35] husband, better wife, better mother,
[36:36] better father. Force yourself to learn,
[36:39] to grow, to press, to overcome, to
[36:42] stand, to witness, to testify. Force
[36:44] yourself.
[36:46] 1 Corinthians 9:27.
[36:49] This is the last scripture
[36:51] Paul speaks.
[36:54] But I keep under my body
[36:58] and bring it into subjection
[37:01] least by any means when I have preached
[37:05] to others I myself should be a cast
[37:09] away. So Paul is saying he take
[37:14] responsibility
[37:15] for his own body and bring it in
[37:18] subjection. So Paul cannot be standing
[37:21] by side of the road looking at sexy
[37:23] dress woman but can can't be can't be
[37:26] reading sexy magazines and so like that
[37:28] and talking about he going to fight and
[37:29] then fight and fight. He knew what to
[37:33] stay away from. He knew what to avoid.
[37:36] He knew how to put it together because
[37:40] this is what discipline is all about. He
[37:42] forced himself and brought his body in
[37:46] subjection.
[37:48] There is a responsibility before us. We
[37:50] give you two scriptures. One is the
[37:54] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[37:58] is pressing to it. Even though the
[38:01] pastor set it up in a way where as long
[38:03] as they belong to a church, well, you
[38:04] make it. That is
[38:08] just becoming like a tribulation saint.
[38:10] We we can't tell you that. That is not
[38:12] the truth. The truth is the wise virgin
[38:16] press hard enough
[38:19] to get the extra oil. Call it extra
[38:23] prayer, extra fasting, extra seeking,
[38:26] whatever it took, but they got the
[38:29] extra. And when the foolish asked for
[38:31] oil, they said not so. We have enough of
[38:35] ourselves. We can't share it with you.
[38:38] So the English word press is from a
[38:41] word, a Latin word called prasar. No is
[38:44] prasar. It's p r e s s a r e. It means
[38:47] to apply force, to push, to squeeze, to
[38:53] urge with persistence,
[38:55] to move forward despite resistance.
[39:00] Tonight I have these words here. You can
[39:03] force yourself to pray
[39:06] even though
[39:07] you don't feel like doing it.
[39:10] You can force yourself to pray. Let's
[39:13] bow our hands.
[39:15] Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight.
[39:18] This was just riding me all day about
[39:21] forcing yourself, forcing oneself.
[39:24] And I'm seeing it in the scriptures. I'm
[39:27] seeing is not just I'm waiting on the
[39:29] Lord and just every anything is anything
[39:32] goes
[39:34] s whatever will be will be. No, it's not
[39:37] that
[39:39] people were determined.
[39:41] Paul said not that I have attained but I
[39:44] press towards the mark. Here was a son.
[39:48] There was a servant. Here was a
[39:49] converted person filled with the Holy
[39:51] Ghost. There was a prophet talking about
[39:53] I press,
[39:55] I force, I push. Oh God, wake up the
[40:00] church tonight. Wake us up tonight to
[40:03] push, to force, to press.
[40:07] But Abraham said that the early church
[40:08] had so much of God and they they did
[40:10] they do like if they didn't have much.
[40:12] They always wanted a refilling. They
[40:14] wanted more of the Holy Ghost. He said
[40:15] this church doesn't have and they don't
[40:18] even act like if they want more of it.
[40:21] God, may it not be so tonight. May you
[40:23] light a bonfire, Father, in every heart
[40:25] here tonight. Every person under the
[40:27] song of my voice, may you light a
[40:29] bonfire, a Holy Ghost fire in their
[40:31] hearts and life as they cry out unto you
[40:33] in prayer. In Jesus name I ask it. So I
[40:36] trust tonight that these few words that
[40:39] I share with you would help you and
[40:41] would strengthen you. Praise God in
[40:44] pressing forward in God. Amen. Force
[40:47] yourself tonight. So God bless you as we
[40:49] get on in prayer. Praise the Lord.

[1:27:35] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Father,
[1:27:37] we praise you, Father. We thank you,
[1:27:39] Father. We thank you for your presence
[1:27:40] tonight. We thank you for your spirit
[1:27:42] tonight. We thank you for your power
[1:27:44] tonight. We thank you for answering
[1:27:46] prayer. We worship you. We glorify you.
[1:27:48] We magnify you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:52] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:27:53] you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for the
[1:27:55] prayers of the saints. Thank you Lord
[1:27:56] for hearing the prayer and answering.
[1:27:59] Lord come down among us in a special way
[1:28:02] and visit the people. I ask in Jesus
[1:28:04] name. Amen. Amen. Tonight we want to
[1:28:07] remember sister Ruth brother Williams
[1:28:10] granddaughter. She has been taken to the
[1:28:11] hospital. Uh her heart is racing so we
[1:28:14] want to just bow our heads and we want
[1:28:16] to pray for her at this time. Heavenly
[1:28:18] father we pray for Ruth Lord that your
[1:28:20] holy spirit will visit her father even
[1:28:22] now Lord from the crown of her head your
[1:28:24] soul of her feet. you know our condition
[1:28:26] father but you are the God oh God who
[1:28:29] made this body who made this mind who
[1:28:31] made all part of us father and I pray
[1:28:34] that your healing virtue would flow Lord
[1:28:36] you promise in the last days that the
[1:28:38] sons of God will be manifested you
[1:28:40] promise in the last days that you'll
[1:28:41] confirm your word among your people
[1:28:43] Jesus come among us tonight and pass by
[1:28:45] her neighborhood right where she is in
[1:28:47] the hospital right right where she is we
[1:28:50] pass by and touch and heal her and
[1:28:52] deliver her in the name of Jesus and any
[1:28:54] person here tonight not feeling well,
[1:28:57] struggling, Father God, in their body,
[1:28:59] in their mind, in their spirit. I pray a
[1:29:01] special touch for them that your healing
[1:29:02] virtue will flow. Father, remember the
[1:29:05] elderly among us. Remember the Caleb
[1:29:06] among us. Remember those who are aging,
[1:29:09] Father God, that you would give them the
[1:29:10] strength, the revelation, the
[1:29:12] inspiration, that their lives are not in
[1:29:14] vain, that their lives have purpose, and
[1:29:16] you want to be glorified in them and
[1:29:18] through them and by them. Oh God, we got
[1:29:21] a word tonight to force ourselves to
[1:29:23] press our way. Lord, that is how you set
[1:29:26] it up, Lord. Not only to stand and look
[1:29:29] at the land, but every place you put
[1:29:31] your foot is an effort to place feet and
[1:29:34] footsteps is possession. It's an effort
[1:29:36] to take action. It's an effort, Lord, to
[1:29:39] act and to do what is right and to do
[1:29:41] what is pleasing in your sight. Oh God,
[1:29:43] the prophet spoke about the passion to
[1:29:44] know the word, the cry to get in the
[1:29:46] spirit and and the most important part I
[1:29:49] believe is the fervent desire to please
[1:29:51] you, to please God, to please you in all
[1:29:54] that we do. Father, whatever in word or
[1:29:56] deed to do all in the name of Jesus
[1:29:58] Christ. Father, look over the sons and
[1:30:00] daughters tonight. Look over the mothers
[1:30:02] and the fathers tonight. Look over the
[1:30:04] husbands and wives tonight. Look at the
[1:30:06] young people tonight. Look at the
[1:30:07] children tonight and visit them with
[1:30:09] your presence and grace. Preserve them
[1:30:11] in your love. Preserve them in your
[1:30:13] grace. Preserve them in your kindness.
[1:30:15] Oh God, as the days are evil. And oh
[1:30:18] God, we ask for your supernatural
[1:30:19] intervention. Father, even as Esther
[1:30:22] says, pray and fast because she looking
[1:30:24] for supernatural intervention. Our
[1:30:26] strength is in you. Our hope is in you.
[1:30:29] And Lord, as the prophet said, we could
[1:30:31] be hindering our own selves by not
[1:30:33] acting, by just praying, praying,
[1:30:35] praying with no action behind it. But we
[1:30:37] are challenged tonight to force
[1:30:39] ourselves to do, to live, to testify, to
[1:30:42] witness, have your way. Father, I commit
[1:30:45] this service into your hands this coming
[1:30:47] Sunday, this one service Sunday morning.
[1:30:49] I commit the people into your hands even
[1:30:50] now in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and
[1:30:53] amen. God bless you and thanks for being
[1:30:55] here tonight. I trust the Lord uh really
[1:30:58] inspire you to push push push past your
[1:31:01] limitations. Push past your fears, push
[1:31:05] past what you feel you cannot get past,
[1:31:07] you can push past it. You have to you
[1:31:11] must. Shamgar when he when he got tired
[1:31:15] of of of those people coming and raiding
[1:31:17] him and reading his crops, he said
[1:31:19] enough is enough. And he took what he
[1:31:22] had in his hand and begin to beat. I
[1:31:24] mean that's a lot of faith in you know
[1:31:26] because it wasn't like a weapon per se
[1:31:29] but he decide I had enough and not taken
[1:31:32] anymore. He pushed himself. He pushed
[1:31:35] himself. Samson same thing. Thousand men
[1:31:38] jawbone he started beat and he defeated
[1:31:41] those men. He pushed himself. You can
[1:31:44] the devil trying to tell us you can't.
[1:31:45] The devil trying to say he's not the
[1:31:47] same yesterday and forever. He is and
[1:31:49] he'll make a way for you. God bless you.
[1:31:51] Have a blessed night. Thanks again for
[1:31:52] being here. be praise.
