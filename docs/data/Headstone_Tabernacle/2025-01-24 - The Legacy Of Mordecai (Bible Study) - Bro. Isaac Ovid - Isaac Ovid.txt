Lord in your presence Lord in this virtual room Lord where we have broken from time and space into Lord an eternal calling an eternal destination and eternal purpose lord it's so easy Lord to get

pray tonight Lord that we would Lord Shake ourselves and go beyond the limits of what we might perceive to be our human ability lord it's the end of the week Lord many arew many are tired Lord It's a time when people try to de-stress as it were and Lord there's no better place to distress than in your presence tonight Lord there's no better place to have a conversation Lord after the issues of

people to speak to your people Lord is not something we take for granted it's not something we take lightly Lord our only desire and our only Endeavor and purpose is to be a blessing to your people so we pray a special blessing upon every brother every sister may you bless our pastor his wife the ministry the officers of the church the Believers that are here any visitors who might be Lord in the meeting tonight anyone that might listen to the recording father may they Lord feel Lord the spiritual vibrations lord of the impact of your word and may the spirit of God follow the word and bring it to life and into a manifestation in the hearts of your people granted now we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen so certainly thank you all for being here tonight uh it's certainly appreciated if you are not here and I'm here by myself we'll have a different kind of a study so we appreciate uh everyone being here tonight to support and to take a little time from the schedule of life and work to spend some time with the word we know that the word is God the God is the word and as our Prophet taught us if you read the Bible and you don't see Jesus in every verse you need to go read it again so we are here to see Jesus we're not here to see man I encourage you as I always say don't take these Bible studies for granted don't take it lightly and I encourage you to pay attention don't treat it like he in news and and you're doing something and is there's something else that's going on but I believe that God call us for a purpose and I believe something could be said tonight that could have an impact on us tonight I encourage you as well if um you're not seeing someone here tonight send them a message tell them we're in Bible study and something is about to happen so we want to make sure that we get the benefits of it and that the effort you know in everything you do in life you reap the benefits based on what you put into it so you put you know 5% of your energy into your school workor and in school you're only going to get 5% results but if you put more effort into it so too you will reap the results and so it is in your spiritual journey the more you put into your spiritual journey is the greater the results that you going to get from it so I want to encourage you tonight those of you who have little ones sit them down let them join the study with us as well um I have come to the realization and I was saying it in a meeting just this week people do what they want to do you know when someone uh says they can't do this or can't do that that that's never the the the whole truth what it really means is that they are valuing certain things more than other things you know and this is not about me it's not about you it's about God and about God really understanding what you place your priority to so for those of who are here and you're at your post of Duty good to see you brother Clarence um good to see like to see Brothers with to the sword shop you know so I know the church has been praying for you and it's good to see that that that smile and now I feel like it now I feel like it I I want to switch from Bible study to to preach you know so but it's good to see you good to see all of you who are who are allowing us to see your face tonight as well so we we have a little thought tonight and I trust it'll be a blessing I I said to my wife when I came home and um I was say about over as well you know Bible studies are different it's not it's not like you're in church in this setting of church so it feels a bit different in how you could have S certain conversations and certain things you may not approach that way in the pulpit in a forum like this we could be a bit more expressive you know so normally going into the pulpit you wouldn't say I'm I'm tired and I'm wiped out and I had a frustrating day or it was overwhelming you know but in this in this setting where we somewhat somewhat more relaxed we could have a conversation around how overwhelming do we was and as I I came home this evening I said to my wife tonight will be a short one I don't I don't have the strength to go for too long um you know today felt like one of those days when you trying to keep up with the day the day moving faster than you can keep up you know and sometime that's how life is sometimes the pace of Life moving so fast you feel like you're in the treadmill and sometime you feel like you're going nowhere you know so but we thank God for his grace we thank God for preserving us we thank God for his word we thank God for the purpose we thank God that the message from found us we didn't find the message but Bram said the message would find itself in the hands of the predestinated so we consider ourselves a privileged people not by virtue of what we have achieved what we have learned what we have done but by the grace of almighty God so tonight I have a bit of a thought um we have preached around this topic we have had studies around this topic but I want to Horn in on it a little different um some years ago I preached a message for such a time as this and um I remember when I was preaching that message it really impacted me because I saw something and I had a subtext you know we should have killed all the amalekites because we traced where Amal pursued Israel and God would have told King Saul to kill the amalekites and then he let King agag you know kind of TI him up a little bit and then AAR come all the way down to hmon in the time of Esther and then uh during the Bible studies we would have done the queen who did not know her purpose where we kind of zoomed in on Queen Esther again and you know sometimes you could be in a position and you don't really understand the purpose of why you are there um but tonight I want to Horn in on morai so for a title tonight the legacy of morai you know the Book of Esther is interesting the the Book of Esther is named actually after the main character in the book um but the reality is we have to admit you know that if you study the life of Esther study the story of Esther Esther would not be Esther if it was not for morai and many times we see things and we see success we see achievement we see people go through struggles go through and was like Wow Esther made it and and and for such a time as this you know we preach M for such a time but those were not Esther's words the whole context of for such a time of this was really morai encouraging Esther to go beyond herself so I really want us to kind of dial in now on morai a bit from two perspectives one do you have a morai who is your morai because without morai we wouldn't have an Esther and on the other side of it can you be a morai so the legacy of morai is is two sides of it because what we find in the study of Queen Esther is this almost silent second character who is one could argue almost of as critical importance as Esther because he is almost the hidden guiding hand for Esther the mentor of Esther and we know the background and story of it but the reality is he's done looking for credit he's not looking for praise he's not looking to have a name on the wall and many of us whether in the natural or in the spiritual we're looking to be recognized we're looking to be acknowledged we're looking for someone to say you're doing a good job and for some reason that is not morai morai was never seeking attention he was never trying to be in the Forefront you know and I'm kind of getting ahead of myself because I just feel to have the conversation around it but the reality is it's important for us to understand how God uses things behind the scene right so so let's go into it and we'll see what the Lord will do have a few notes a few scriptures but just for our memory and for those who have studied it and maybe for those who have not looked at it the entire first chapter of Esther deals with this issue of the king of the day King a hus who is having a a big event a big party a big celebration as it were and the Bible goes at Great Lengths to describe you know white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble and beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble this is chapter 1 verse 6 verse 7 and they give them drink in vessels of gold and the vessels being diverse one from another so it just paints this picture of celebration I mean it speaks of no money being spared it speaks about this is the biggest celebration we have had and we're going all out and if you do it do it big go hard or go home however you want to describe it they are going in and at some point in time the king gets this bright idea on the seventh day uh verse 10 on the seventh day when the heart of the King was merry with wine he commanded meum bista harona bcta Baka Zeta and kakas the Seven Chamberlin the fact that he have to call Seven men to even do this task speaks of him having an understanding of what he was dealing with that served in the presence of hus the king and this was their mission seven men mission to bring vashti the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but verse 12 and I always remember brother Terry speaking about these but Terry is really really good at going but the queen vas refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very rough and his anger burned in him and this sort of plays out its history but is also now because these these men then King said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner to all that knew law and judgment he was always surrounding himself with men who could give him advice and thing and next onto him was Kash sha adata tashes all these big men the seven princes of the Persia and media which saw the king's face clearly the King was embarrassed clearly the king is feeling uncomfortable you are King you call your wife and your wife say I coming verse 15 what shall we do unto the queen Vash according to the law because she hath not performed the Commandment of the King by the chamberlains and mukan answered before the king and the princes vashi the queen had not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women whether it's by Facebook Instagram WhatsApp so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported and the King Asus commanded vashi the queen to be brought in before him but she came not so it CES a situation where these men say if we don't deal with vashy all of us going home in trouble let's find a solution to this problem and we know the story vashi is put away and by chapter two it takes four years so for four years there's no queen as the king is trying to find the right Queen chapter two around verse five we see now the introduction of morai now in sh the palace there was a certain Jew I like when the Bible talks about a certain character it just identifies there a certain brother there's a certain there's a certain Jew whose name was Mori the son of Jer the son of shimel the son of Kish a benjamite so it it kind of paints a picture and and here you see in genealogy history background context and the subtle narrative that morai is actually related to King Saul so there are some subtle parallels here and it is almost as if God is giving a second opportunity to deal with the amalekites because one of Saul's greatest responsibilities was to deal with the amalekites and here is someone in the lineage of Saul is about to encounter an agagite which is a son of agag so so what Saul didn't deal with King agag we have morai who is a son of Saul coming to deal with hmon who is a son of King agag and it shows that one Spirits never die and two when God gives an instruction to finish something he means for it to be finished and if one generation don't finish it he coming back around for another generation to deal with it is it the same way the enemy who has been after God's people for every generation and every age that couldn't handle it is coming out to this bride age for a bride to give you final knockout punch so what the devil thought he got away in the first age in the second age and the third age and all these ages now we coming to a round of it here right so we are getting a background of morai verse six who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the Captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away so here we have a man just like we discussed with the Hebrew Boys in our last meeting two weeks ago he is here against his will he didn't ask to be here he didn't volunteer to be here he was forcibly placed into a into a country among a people he had no choice but yet still he have a testimony he have a stand he have a position and nothing is going to shake that verse S and he brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter so it's not his daughter this is this is his uncle's daughter which means it's his cousin right for she had neither father nor mother an orphan and the maid was fair and beautiful whom Mori when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegi that Esther was brought unto the King's house to the custody of higi Keeper of the woman and I want to just draw to verse 11 and morai walked every day before the court of the woman's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her so we see an interesting character here's a here is a man who who who who I I want to paint it Esther being an orphan morai didn't have to take her in it was his choice and it was clear that he had an interest in making sure that she got the support the care the the attention and even when she was in the king's place for Preparation every day he there how is how is she going how is she going what kind of man this morai is so mori's Story begins not in power or prominence because he begins as an exile a Jew living in shusa the capital of the Persian Empire displaced from his homeland though living in a foreign land under Pagan rule mori's life his approach displays something truly unique we would know for those who have study the story of morai and it's actually captured in that same chapter 2 when he overheard in verse 21 in those days while morai sat in the king's gate now the king's gate is not literally a gate we talking about here it's it's a place of politics it's a place of influence it like lot who sat at the Gate of the city it was Commerce it was tray so here it is he is an exile but he's in a place where he could overhear certain kind of kinds of conversations all right two of the king's chamberlains big th and terish of those who kept the door were rought and sought to lay hands on the king so there's an assassination attempt so because and and I want us to understand this and we're building to something your job your street your background your family is not by accident Mori is at his place of work he is at his job and he's not there by chance behind the scene God is orchestrating every single piece of a of a narrative of a story of a purpose that Mori at the time doesn't even understand and what is interesting Mori reports this to Esther Esther would advise an action would be taken but the Bible says and the thing was known to Mori who told it unto Esther the queen and Esther certified the king thereof in mori's name so Esther is in a place that morai can't access morai is hearing things that Esther can't hear but because because there's a connection between them they're able to have an influence on the king everybody with me so I want us to understand that no matter where you are in life there's a purpose for you being where you are in life at that particular point in time I trust this is helping someone this evening so just like Joseph is in Egypt sold into slavery and Daniel is in Babylon we have this character morai who has a critical role to play because as much as Esther is the main character Esther will have her struggles Esther will have her doubts Esther will not know how to approach certain things because the Bible says in chapter 2:1 Esther had not shown her people nor her Kindred in other words Esther didn't tell them what she was she didn't tell them she was the Drew and why was it so for morai had charged her that she should not show it so in other words Esther was operating under guidance if Mori was not there and Esther had just gone her own way what how different the story would have been if there was no morai in Esther's life so I want to underscore again who is the morai in your life who is giving you the advice who are you taking advice from because if Esther had taken bad advice she would have end up in a different place and one of the biggest challenges with us is we take advice from the wrong people and if you don't know you lack the wisdom and understanding to differentiate at times good advice from bad advice because if you don't know you just don't know so it is critical for us to understand who the people of influence because that's what morai was to eser he was a person of influence who is influencing us who is guiding how you move on your job in your marriage amongst your family in your business Affairs in your conversations in your interactions because the Bible speaks about the wisdom of and the safety of counsel and good advice many of us if we reflect in our lives we'll see half of the trouble we got into is because we went into things without good advice so the legacy of morai is actually a legacy of getting good advice the advice that comes from a genuine heart without any ulterior motive because what we see throughout The Narrative of morai is morai was never looking for anything in return in fact for those who know this story they forgot that morai reported the assassination attempt on the king it was only when the king couldn't sleep and he say well read the Chronicles to missaka tried to fall asleep when they had to read and in so and so day there was an assassination attempt and morai reported it and the King say well what was ever done for this man morai in other words morai sat day after day week after week month after month he I walk around saying well you know they never reward me you know they never give me a medal you know they never give me a thank you email you know if if it wasn't for me the king would have be dead and they even they even put up a sign for me this is why I said at the beginning how many of us could do the right thing without the need for acknowledgement can I say that again it sounds as if it's a contrarian concept because human nature suggests that there should be a reward and a recognition for doing the right thing I think I want to dig into that a little bit we have become such a society of entitlement and of trade and of tit fortat and that that it's almost as if you have to incentivize people to do the right thing where are the people who could do the right thing without the consideration of a reward where are the people who will do the right thing if you don't know if there's a blessing in store for it because you're doing the right thing because the right thing is what you're supposed to do Mori did the right thing and he it would seem he was never rewarded but I want to assure you tonight everything you do for the Lord there's a reward in there but you can't tell God how to do it you cannot tell God when to do it but in due season when it really matters God will do it can somebody say Amen so morai being where he was was not accidental you being where you are is not accidental the experiences in your life is not accidental the school you went to is not accidental everybody feeling fine let's go mori's role as Esther's guardian and Mentor is critical to the unfolding of This Book of Esther I want us to understand that when Esther's parents died Esther could have been left vulnerable we don't spend time talking about this we talk about the parts with if I perish I perish and Es being prep but I do not want us to for one second place or take lightly the role that morai played this speaks to us as parents it speak to us as Guardians and it's challenging us to go beyond our family Circle because Esther is not mori's daughter he take her as a daughter so he is making a real choice now listen parents don't have a choice you're supposed to love your children you don't already have a choice but morai had a choice because it's not his child so he is choosing love over the love being something that is expected I want us to understand the subtle difference there Esther could have been left vulnerable forgotten but Mori steps in adopting her as his own daughter what's the word adoption there his care his wisdom his guidance not just in the natural but in the spiritual shapes Esther into a courageous leader that God could use to deliver his people this aspect of morai highlights the power of sacrificial love because Mori would have had to make decision because there's a young girl in his house you can't move a certain way you can't operate a certain way these are the impact of life decisions just as the decision to be a Christian to live a certain way their sacrifices we make their choices we make their decisions we make but I want to underscore that for morai it was a choice and every one of us have a choice tonight everybody feeling fine in a situation where Esther is an exile morai would have brought a level of structure and peace to Esther in an uncertain environment giving her what could be described as a home and a sense of belonging and it's very evident that this was real when you read the scripture and morai walked every day before the court to know how Esther did and what should become of her what going on with the girl she she okay she eating good everything all right I just checking everybody feeling fine mori's influence is also evident in Esther's obedience maybe years later the Lord Tes we hear this but my wife told my daughter don't touch the ice cream but over today Isabelle found a way to put a chair and something else and reach the top of the fridge open the thing get into the ice cream take it out seal it back as if never did Sin there was no evidence around the fridge that the ACT took place the evidence was found when the cup was found at the side of the bed if it had not been for that there would have been no evidence today so I'm making a point that the shaping and influence has to reach a point where it reaches a level of obedience Esther say Mor tell them I telling them I telling them I'm a Jew I is my own woman you understand how many of us overstep under step so clearly something because there is no point in The Narrative of Esther where we ever see Esther not obeying morai go to the scripture 10 chapters in The Book of Esther even when Esther is reluctant even when Esther is uncertain even when Esther in a state of what and and even when Mo when Mori say how do you not know for such a time as this you are raised up did Esther follows that is the impact of a relationship of trust and even for us as parents as Leaders as managers because at the end of the and I've said it many times God expects more from us as Believers you know you are royalty you are Prince on the earth you are leader on the earth so it is expected that your operation come across a certain way this has nothing to do with your educational level it hases nothing to do with what school you went to the fact is you are born into a family your father own everything and you have by virtue of birth and being part of this mystical body you have Divine access into what others cannot access there is an expectation that comes with that there's a a way to behave that comes with that there's a way you approach language and your conduct and your behavior that's because of that you cannot do what you want because you're part of a royal family we have referenced the UK the British family because you can't just get up and do what you want one time they interviewed President Obama and he said well he can't drive one one of the things he misses he can't just drive on the road anymore because as the president the Secret Service controls where you going how you drive because your safety is their responsibility and he spoke of a situation where there was a car that came on the White House ground and he wanted to drive the car so bad and he step into it and he make a little turn before he go so far the secret block him he can't go he can't go beyond a certain and he's the president but because of his role he cannot do what he wants to do anybody with me so obedience that I'm talking about here is not just about well I obeying our being it is also a recognition that as a Son of God as a daughter of God you can't do what you want to do because there's an expectation of how you live how you dress how you speak it is hard because some you want to fly out the handle find me somebody who don't want to fly out the handle but as your character becomes shaped you learn to begin to control your tongue Mark the perfect man the man who could Bridle his tongue and a bridal a bridal is a serious thing you know it's not just control it's Bridal is bring it under subjection and a bridal mean using an external device almost as way you know it's like putting on blinders you know can you church say amen I hope this is helping us in some way right so modi's influence and I really what what we holding in tonight I'm not going to be too long is about who is influencing you and what kind of influence are you on others because we said the beginning we're looking at modai from two perspectives who is your modai your person who's influencing you and who are you influencing because I don't want it to be selfish to be always the one on the receiving end well I looking for somebody to influence me positively but at the same time God put you somewhere to have a positive impact and it may be in your circle of your family it could be beyond that and God help us we want to be beyond that can the church say Amen Mori taught Esther wisdom Mori advised Esther to conceal her Jewish identity until the right time this was not an act of fear it was wisdom at work because wisdom allowed Esther to become Queen can the church say Amen this decision was not about compromise but call it strategic with wisdom can we go on mori's wisdom and we finally speaking a lot about wisdom here and I did a bible study on wisdom is especially evident in how he advises in dealing with the palace he recognized the potential dangers of revealing her identity too early and he understood the importance of timing even Jesus in Mark instructed his disciples to keep his identity a secret he said tell no one now this is disciples so Jesus telling disciple tell no one and brother so and so feeling inspired he feeling a something just tell him to tell to tell somebody you understand why discipleship and training is so important because discipleship speaks about being a disciplined Warner he charged them to tell no one in fact and I've preached this many times up until the time of Lazarus the word was always tell no one tell no one tell no one and Jesus have them at his side somewhere tell no man tell no man tell no man is when Lazarus raised from the dead that's when it just they couldn't Contin it anymore everybody feeling fine throughout scripture and this is where again we're looking at scriptural wisdom now this is not you hiding your testimony to get away with foolishness this is not well well no brother Isaac say well don't really tell them I'm a Christian I'm I'm a undercover Christian that is not what we teaching tonight what we teaching is wisdom so I don't want know why you know I'm I'm a Believer so I just want to because Esther didn't tell them at first and no no no that's not what we talking about tonight I want us to be clear on what we addressing we we we're trying to get into an understanding of of wisdom which goes beyond knowledge it goes beyond information to have the mind of Christ the intelligence to know what God wants done with the word the understanding that that it takes wisdom to navigate the Bible say be gentle as a dove but be wise as a serpent that's scripture you need to be wise in your Affairs you cannot be making foolish decisions there's a book written called you Road Less stupid it's a business book The Road Less stupid and the premise of it is most people make relatively good decision the problem is we make too many stupid decisions and if we eliminate these stupid decisions you will actually end up in a better position than most things and what that simply mean is if you apply spiritual wisdom Godly wisdom in your Affairs you know how much problems you'll avoid that's a lesson to all of us that's me that's you that's everybody can the Church Say Amen Moses mother hid him for three months to protect him from Pharaoh Rahab hid the SP imagine if Rahab C Des spis right here our Bible be totally different you know all right wisdom requires patience let's go so the narrative goes on so by the time we reach Exodus chapter 3 the Bible said esus chap 3:1 after these things did King aerus promote hmon the son of hamata the agagite agagite from the line of agar so he's an not just an amalekite but of the line of King agar who should have been dead in fact he shouldn't have been born if King sa had done his job all right did he promote hmon the son of hamata the agagite and Advance him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him in other words hmon is now the king's right right hand man and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate that is like almost like a parliament is almost like a is a political arena in the king's gate bowed and reverence himon for the king had so commanded him but Mori bowed not nor did him reverence then the king's servants which were in the king's Gates said unto Mori why transgressed thou the king's commandment now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hacked not unto them that they told him and to see whether morai matters would stand for he had told them that he was a Jew so I want us to see that morai is one he knows where he stand two he's comfortable with his identity he is not compromising his fate he not taking the undercover route as Esther because that is strategic wisdom but in the public light in his office in his job he said tell the reason I about it is very clear I'm a Jew it is my conviction is my belief that's why I'm I'm in this position verse five and when hymon saw that morai bowed not nor did him reverence then was hmon full of Wrath and he thought scorn to lay hands on morai alone I want us to catch this in other words he said this thing is so such an affront that is a it's not good enough for me to just punish morai alone he felt so offended he thought it scorned to lay hands on Mori alone for they had shown him the people of morai wherefore hmon sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole Kingdom of aestus even the people of Mori now it's up until this time we see morai as the guide the mentor the other figure the advisor to Esther he heard about the attempt on the king he reports it so far it's almost like okay there's nothing you might deem controversial if you could use that word around him but this stand that morai takes is the defining moment of his character this act of conviction was a profound Declaration of his feet and mori's courage has an impact not just on him but on all of the people so when we look at the Book of Esther it is modi's action as one person that actually put all of the Jews at Jeopardy I want us to understand the significance of the role mori's refusal as rooted in his faith and his loyalty to God's Commandments and no doubt Mori would have understood what it meant when he say I'm a Jew because as he hon was an agagite and he was a son of Saul he would have been sharp on the word as it were and morai being a Statesman would have been aware of the consequences of his actions Mori refused that to Bow made him a Target his choice brought danger not only to himself but to all the Jews and his refusal sets him apart and it's a pattern of Can You Stand now we would have addressed this in our last Bible study with the Hebrew boys who they had a choice Mori had a choice he could to say well you know what let me just go with the flow but as Believers we are often confronted with situations where you have to take a stand what I want to draw attention to particularly for the young people it's every day they were trying to convince him to change his manner is daily they hacker onto and and daily they spake un him and he hacken not unto them so I want us to understand that when the world trying to bend you or twist you is not going to be one time they come at you it's going to be over and over again right now the moment that hmon adjust his position and see going after the Jews as we know he went to the king and said there are certain people scattered abroad this is verse 8 in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse ver from all people neither keep they the king's law devid is not for the king's profet to suffer them if it please the king Let It Be written that they may be destroyed and I will pay 10,000 Talons of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it to the king's Treasury and the King acts on this now what I admire about morai is the beginning of chapter 4 when Mori perceived all that was done Mori rent his clothes put on saot with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter Cry came even before the king's gate for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackl and in every Province whether soever the king's commandment and his decree came there was a great M among the Jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many laying sackcloth and Ashes is he went straight into morning he went straight into prayer he went straight into trying to seek what God wanted to achieve about this his immediate reaction is one of grief but he also quickly transitions into a role of guidance in the situation because Esther's maid the Bible said and a chamberlains came and told it to her and she sent cloth know we know toori to take away sacot so we would have addressed it with Esther that she didn't know what was going on because she's in the comfort of the palace and the moment that she gets word of what Mori would have done morai now begins to get involved in having a conversation by Esther 4:3 morai commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shall Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for if altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou had come to the kingdom for such a time as this and this may be one of the most critical pieces of mori's testimony in the Book of Esther but I like this from two perspectives one modai is saying God will deliver us he said if you hold your peace then there shall arise enlargement and deliverance from another place in other words God is going to solve it I'm not worried about God's Deliverance I'm not worried about God changing the situation around Mori was a man of Faith Mori was a man who was fixed and Resolute in his confidence just like the Hebrew voice our God is going to Deliver Us I want us to see a recurring pattern because if we understand the pattern and we can fall into the same pattern the Hebrew boy says our God will deliver and if he don't deliver we still not going to bow down here is Mori saying Deliverance is going to come but how do you not know that you are here for such a time as this isn't that such an encouragement to us all because friends crisis will come to our homes to our lives to our businesses and how do you not know that the situation you in his for specific purpose can the church say Amen despite his grief Mori begins to formulate a plan talking to Esther his famous words for such a time of as this recognizing Esther's rise to a queen was all part of God's plan Esther wasn't thinking it the thought of using as it were her position to be her influence was not Esther's idea Esther didn't suggest well let me go and see what I could do had it not been morai said Esther I want you to refrain your thinking because you think you're safe in there you didn't even know I was out here in all of this you even know all this going on but how do you not know that all of the work that took to bring in this place is for God to use you in your situation and I want to bring the question for you how do you not know the thing you might complain about the challenge you might be facing the family situation you're in how do you not know that God has orchestrated it for such a time as this for you to be a blessing when you don't even realize that God has positioned you to be a blessing I want to say that one more time how do you not know that the place you're in is to be a blessing but you there looking somewhere else or thinking you're not part of the story or thinking you don't have a role to play and here it is modai is saying you might think you are not a piece of the story here but how do you not know that you are the piece that God wants to use in this time can the church say Amen Mori in this scripture here is also warning Esther again the role of an influence your role of a guide the role of telling someone you think you're all right now but how do you not know and he's going beyond that to say don't assume that your position is going to protect you could I say that one more time don't assume that because you're in the palace you're safe don't assume because and I want to bring this now on a higher level the world is finished there's there's nothing else the economy the global economy every is finished we try to find comfort and safety in your savings your bank account whatever whatever is your safety net because Mori was saying you think you have a safety net because you're in the palace and because you're under the king's protection this wouldn't affect you but I'm telling you when they find out who you are you in trouble too anybody with me it might be obvious now but somebody going to tell them you also a Jew and the reality is when you look at the scripture the law of that edict that the king passed could not have been reversed throughout the story of Esther it it took a new law to overwrite what that was but that law was in place in those days when a king wrote a law he couldn't on write the law it took a new law that had to be written to deal with what that law could not cover thank God for a higher law because if it were not for a higher law we don't stand a chance because the law said that sin should lead to death but he went to a higher law and he paid the price and create a a legal loophole that he could be your judge and he could be your lawyer and he used the law to protect you can the church say Amen so I want us to understand what you might think is your safety could be a comfort that's a false Comfort anybody with me tonight so morai was telling us don't rely on your bank account you know don't rely on your business don't rely on where you're living don't rely on who you're related to don't rely on the fact you're living in the palace and I living on the outside don't rely on the fact that that you have food in say every day and men have to go and find for food because there's coming a time when who you are will be found out and because the law says Jews to die you are going to be on that list too it might come today it might come tomorrow but it's going to come how do you not know that God have you there for such a time as this there was a time for you to hide who you were but this is not that time oh come on now anybody with me when we started the journey I told you don't tell anybody who you are but for such a time as this this is the time to declare who side you're on this is the time to make it very clear who what line you're born into what your purpose is what your calling is anybody with me and the church say Amen morai warns Esther to not assume that her royal Position will shield her from the degree let's go on leadership in crisis morai didn't fall apart morai didn't throp his hand and say I don't know what to do in the midst of a crisis death is on the door judgment is on the door the law has already changed the Seas has already changed and morai is leveraging what he could leverage in the midst of Crisis friends you don't go to school to become a manager to manage when things are just good anybody could do that you see in crisis you see in Conflict you see when things go wrong that is what distinguishes somebody who is great from somebody who is good if you are captain of a ship and your ship never meet bad water are you ready a captain I'm not questioning your your captain captain C or whatever you want to use but a real Captain is one who could handle hey I went through two storms and I lose this and I lose that and I somehow are able to the kind of experience to go through some of these things really is is what make a season but he battle scar veterans it's time we own our scars as it were yes modi's leadership in the moment of of Crisis Reveals His Faith his Courage the ability to inspire we talk about morai and Sir this could be you and your son it could be you and your wife it could be you and your coworker we have a crisis we have a situation there there has to be a way out morai position is morai never said there's no way out he said God will sort it out but I think you could help in this situation he maintain a positive outlook some of us and we have said before we are to negative our default is we're in trouble is falling apart we don't know what to do this is morai ignoring the news report ignoring the legal document ignoring the pending danger saying they has to be away is either God going to do it and how he do it that's on him or we have to find a way to make something happen here and Esther how do you not know for such a time as this but we're not saying a NE we're not seeing in a negative vein if we could just lift our thinking away from the negative Because unless you reframe and we started it in this year shifting in narrative from why is this happening to me to why is it happening for me that's a first step in starting to find out how do I not can I achieve it but how can how can I achieve it because if you don't believe you can you're already lost but if you shift and I shared this with the church before some time ago when they study successful people across the board and they ask them in your moment of greatest difficulty what what was driving you and the Common Thread was they all did not know what was coming next but they all believed they will get through it the greatest leaders don't have all the answers but what they have is a tenacity and the belief that we'll find a way we'll work it out we'll figure it out others have been in different situations there's got to be a way somebody else figured it out somewhere else we have to figure it out and once you approach life that way your whole disposition because you begin to now look at what could have been closed doors and you begin to see opportunities we have shared the story many time somebody went to sell shoes and they two guys and they come with the same the same report boss nobody here wearing shoes we can't sell shoes another B say hey boss nobody here wear shoes you know the amount of shoes we can sell I never even see a place with so much opportunity before they look at the same the same thing you know but their perspective is different and as a Believer I don't care who backslide I don't care who give up I don't care who discourage that's not you giving up is not you backsliding is not you throwing in the towel is not you there are so many examples and testimonies of chrisis morning and for some of us we have seen experiences and pain but here it is somebody looking and saying but wait a minute they just pass a Lord and say I have to get killed do I just accept that as my fi do I just say well okay well I sit down and accept that more I say I'm not accepting that how many things have been true at you always I I accepted the doctor say I don't care what the doctor say whose report will you believe and this is why words are so important did even did the doctors say are not well those walk around saying you're not well or that what the doctor say that know your confession that's not your confession so if somebody asks you the doctors and them is who saying it but I am well I'm Healed if you to the doctors if you want to talk to doctors talk to them let them tell you but if you ask it from my mouth by his stripes I'm Healed I am well all is well we're going to make it we're going to overcome we're going to have the victory that is Bible but over preached on this some time ago where brother Bram G the example he said I wasn't lying I'm I'm I'm speaking my My Confession and we bring our bodies under subjection to obey our confession your life this is not living in an unrealistic way because Mori had a choice the same way he had a choice to bring Esther into his home it's the same he had a choice you know how Mory would have feel walking the street knowing everybody around you know how them Jews was watching him think about his context for a minute if Mory could have been walking on saying boy you know boy boy I really wasn't thinking with everybody you know but church I really sorry yeah I was you know I was a little zealous and if I didn't know that if I did didn't bow all of you was getting killed you understand the church meetings they was having I want us to understand the context because sometimes we don't realize that our actions have consequences morai could have gone into a valley of depression where is brother morai we haven't seen morai since they announced that they killing the Jews since hmon and morai fall out we haven't found anybody known brother morai number we WhatsApp him we call him he not answering because he gone into deep depression since this all the Fate he had dwindled on I want us to understand that life is about choices and every day we have a choice to keep moving forward or we have a choice to retreat and I'm saying whatever happens you have to keep moving forward so modai went from sackcloth and Ashes and after what he stopped that and went into strategy he said Esther here's what simple help is coming I can't tell you how I can't tell you where our God is a deliverer but when I look at the situation and look to my left I look to my right the only person I think could dun this thing home is you how do you not know that for such a time as this you are not in that position anybody with me I trust this is helping us a little bit and this is not for you to to look around your world to see who in position to this is you in position or no in this teaching tonight you are both morai and Esther you are both the influencer and the influency you are about the one in the position it's it's all of the above I want you to take lessons from this in your daily life in your spiritual work in your business work in your job take all of the issues and turn it into opportunities for God to get the glory leadership in crisis the Jews went into fasting and prayer and all these things in the narrative here let's go and let's find a place to land so we know the story that the next series of events is the sleepless night of the [Music] king and it's just amazing because who interrupted his sleeper the king God is behind the scene and he the every time the king tried to fall asleep God just hit him every time the king TR to fall asleep God just hit him and the King just car fall asleep this is chapter six of Esther on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of The Chronicles and they were read before the king so the the only reason the King won the book Chronicles it's not to get aware of the Chronicles it's to try to fall asleep and sometimes you wake up in the night and they cast sleep you know what the best thing to do when you're W your C sleep just go and pray you talk talk to God you get C just talk to God that's the Believers we have dealing with no sleep have a Comm with the Lord when you is God tap say let's talk but here it is this King God set it up this way because this is not by accident because the actions that come out of this is not by accident is All By Design chapter 6 verse two and it was found written that morai had told big tana and and and terce two of the Kings Chine the keep of the door who sought to lay hand on the king and the King said what honor and dignity had been done to morai for this and this to me just mindblowing and I want to Circle back on this again because here it is morai being faithful morai did not even use this experience to try to get out out out of the situation with t many of us would have said but look how the king treat me now Bo look how but King you don't remember when how much thing it was and I I save your life to show that modai act was genuine he didn't even use it as leverage you know some people are used as leverage over here 20 years later you remember the $2 that they give you when they want to buy the Coke and the Pepsi and thing the pie the doubles it was 22 years ago I remember the day you wanted the doubles and I bought it for you and you still they want to collect thing 22 years afterwards here it is modai facing trial tribulation and testing and he pull out this if it's ever is if it's ever somebody can leverage at that point say but King oh gosh spare my life now remember our savior so the king now under under strategic guidance asking the question because again the king trying to sleep you know so clearly the issue is about sleep because you ask what what what what what honor and dignity had been done to morai for this then said the king servant and ministered unto him there's nothing done for him and the King said who is in the court now hon had come into the outward Court of the King's house to speak unto the king to hang Mori so your car there's no script writer on the earth who could write this kind of thing you know while the king trying to figure out who in court to deal with what he want to deal with hmon coming under inspiration under judgment anointing to hang morai so apart from going after the Jews he can't even wait to go after the Jews he want to hang he want to H hang monai now now him had come into the outward Court of the Kings house to speak and the King to hang M on The Gallows that he had prepared so hmon a government Minister a leader take time out of his work schedule to order an architect and a builder to build a Gallows to hang morai instead of the Affairs of State he take good government time to spend design and then waiting to get the king's ear to get permission to go and hang Mori right verse five and the King servant said unto him behold hmon standed in the court and the King said let him come on let him come in so hmon came in and the King said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighted to honor now hmon taught in his heart to whom would the king Delight to do honor more than myself no this is just this is just all every time I read the scripture you could never get over this so so so again talk about an OV exaggerated sense of selfworth overestimating your S price thinking higher than yourself than you are thinking beyond your station hmon can't even see beyond himself he said when I look around this could only be talking about me who else would the king be thinking about to ask this question and this is in his heart what is in your heart when when when people want to bless in does your heart say me me me me me and hymon answered the king for the man whom the king delighted on her let the Royal apparel so you can see now what in his heart all time he there but now you get to unlock you deep with his eyes in the heart let Royal apparel the brought which the King used it to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the Crown Royal which is set upon his head now if I was the king I'd would be a little concerned they be go here himon watching all the king things you recognize the king horse the king clothes the king crown hereon there as a second in command and he want to be first in command bad that's in he had he said let the Royal apparel be brought which the King used it to wear he closed the man the horse that he King ride it upon the crown Ro is set upon his head and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that they may array the man with all whom the king delighted honor and bring him on Horseback through the street of the city and Proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted to honor and you can imagine you know when some people describe some things as if they're seeing it so you could see hmon could have gone into a certain anointing a certain gear he's seeing it he's seeing himself on the horse he seeing he say boy hey that that would look good that would look that is the picture that is like your your ambition your your your your thing upon your wall to watch when you wake up in the morning this is what I want to see and King's response then the king said to him and make his and take the apparel and the horse and th and thou Hast as thou said and do even so to Mori the Jew that set it at the king's gate let nothing fail of all that thou has spoken in other words every single thing that you describe that need to happen let none of it fail in other words execute this thing to Perfection you call that the Divine reversal [Laughter] then took him on the apparel and the horse and arrayed Mori and brought him on horse back through and you know hmon that would have been tough hmon but Mora himself had to be reconciling but wait a minute what really going on here boy you know when the psalmist David says the Lord will prepare a table for you in the presence of the enemies I shared with somebody recently how could that scripture ever be fulfilled if you don't have enemies the Lord wants to prepare a table for you in the presence of the enemies how could that scripture ever be fulfilled if you don't have enemies and this scripture the Bible said he preparest preparest is is an activity this is not you walk into a room and the table is set this is God is taking time to lay the sheet on the thing put he he put the cloth he put the cup he put the spoon he put the fork he is preparing as an activity the table while the enemy watching they watching the prepared for you in the presence of the enemies Isn't Our God a wonderful God to think of His blessings in the face of difficulty and challenges here it is Mori is walking here and he his his enemies you want to guide the whole Pro the procession what a rush of emotions what a rush of a journey of a man who took it upon himself to raise a daughter who was not his own to help a king with out the desire for recompense or reward to just do his duty and follow his conviction and to be at the mercy of debt and now to be rewarded but still has you wisdom to know that the issue is not closed but something is Shifting in the atmosphere can the church say Amen then took himmon this is verse 11 the the apparel and the horse and AR raay Mori and brought him on horse back through the street of the SE City and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighted to honor and Mori came again to the king's gate but hmon hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered hon embarrassed you see this we never really spend time on these verses so after this Hon do even want to show his face now and hymon told Zares his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him so as far as hmon is concerned his life fall apart him the Bible said what have befallen him then said his wise men and Zares his wife unto him if Mori be of the seed of the Jews before whom thou Hast begun to fall Thou shalt not Prevail against him but Thou shalt surely fall before him so the wife start to say listen himon you need to check yourself because this thing are looking good it looking good what your plan was start to fall apart real fast and if in fact this Jew just get the highest award it look as if a plan about to fall apart and while they were yet talking with him came the king's chiming and hastened to bring hmon onto the banquet that Esther had prepared and we know the story that Esther begins to reveal to the king that there are people out to try to kill her and to destroy her and when he ask who it is he say well it's he all right so I want us to see here this narrative and I want us to understand that the shaping of our character Our Lives there's a role of a mentor for all of us and there's opportunities for all of us to be a mentor or an influence to others the the most important lesson here is Esther had a mentor Esther had a guide Esther had someone who was able to point her at the right time in the right way that person was there to shape to mold to encourage to direct that led her being receptive being obedient being responsive being respectful we live in an age now where young people inherently entitled disrespectful they want to do their own they don't want to hear nobody they want to try they they have a better idea and technology has enabled that but technology is not wisdom knowledge is not wisdom and there's a room for all of us to have the right influences on our own lives and to also be the right influence on others I'm getting ready to close out morai was instrumental in this entire Narrative of Esther morai provided the strategy Esther focus on the execution using her position as Queen to advocate for her people people before the king according to Persian law the king's original decree to destroy the Jews could not be revoked in chapter 8 ver7 then the king said unto Esther the queen andto Mori behold I have given Esther the house of hmon and him they have hanged upon the Gallows because he his hand upon the Jews write ye also for the Jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and seal with the king's Ring May no man reverse so the power to write a new law went to Esther and morai to write the law to reverse the law or to address the law rather that was originally written so you have a man who was sitting in the gate now he's writing laws in this new environment isn't that in that is that mind-blowing to see the progress of a simple man who had who took the risk of taking on a young girl and now he's writing laws we closing out now just finding a place to land closing out here in Esther 10 and the Kingus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the Isles of the sea and all the acts of his power and of his might and the Declaration of the greatness of Mori where unto the king Advanced him are he not written in the book of Chronicles of the kings of media and the Persia for morai the Jew was next unto King aurus and great among the Jews so in other words Mori went from being just a simple man in the gate to being the most powerful man in the entire country the entire Kingdom right on man the king what an encouragement to us about being the right type of influence about being able to navigate challenges of being able to do the right thing without expecting a reward and to see God come and do it because at the end of the day how this transpired was not man morai didn't orchestrate this whole thing every piece of this was God achieving a great purpose and encouragement tonight is God is going to achieve a great purpose in your life and the lesson I want you to take is ensure that you have the right influence and ensure that you being your right type of influence can we bow our heads for word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for this opportunity to just share this Bible study Lord to look at familiar scriptures and maybe see something in it that we have not looked at in that way before I pray there God that you encourage your people you would bless your people that you would open their understanding to how they could be better Christians and Lord become better influences and Lord even more importantly s under the right influence lord it's so easy in this time to be influenced the wrong way your Prophet preached about there only two influences influence from above influence from below and father the lid of Hell being uncovered and leveraging so many things from technology and all these things to try to influence people to Lord be so many things Lord Lord to be able to come to your word to get Divine influence from you through your scriptures and how you have laid it out in so many different ways that we could find peace and encouragement that no matter the adversity no matter the testimony no matter the the report of the doctor or the business or the job or the economy or whatever it might be there is a way out Lord and you are a way Lord but you also placees on this Earth to have dominion to figure things out to work things out father you put man on the earth to have dominion on on on on in in in this existence father because the Earth belongs to us father Lord you placed us here to have dominion you placed us here to be reflections of your deity of your majesty of your power on the earth father may you bless your people may you encourage your people may you lift your people up may you be with each one tonight and Lord this Legacy of Mori this testimony Lord of Lord this this this this almost second character to Esther but Lord the Book of Esther ends Lord not speaking about Esther but it ends speaking about Mori who was second only to the king Lord so in many ways Lord we see this Hidden Hand this this hidden presence as it were as as morai was a hidden hand and a hidden expression and a support Lord to Esther to help her be watch is Father Lord we see you Lord also helping to guide a bride helping to show us how to go and how to prepare and what we should put in place father so Lord may you strengthen us Lord in the natural in the spiritual strengthen our going our coming in or going out father the the issues of Life father and Lord and and may we have a deeper understanding for Lord Divine wisdom Lord to handle situation the way that you want Lord to know when to go Lord to know when to speak when to stay silent to know when to run when to hide when to move when to attack father Lord we see David saying Lord shall I pursue he he wanted more than just his emotion more than his knowledge more than his strength he was looking for Lord a Divine influence Lord and and when you said to pursue he could move with confidence move with the assurance that you're with him father we want to know when to pursue we want to know Lord when to stay quiet we want to know when to move Lord Lord may you bless your people may you bless the service coming Sunday May you touch your children may you bring such a Revival to the hearts of the people in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen may God bless you have a wonderful evening have a blessed weekend we look forward to seeing all of you in the house of the Lord on this coming Sunday come under great expectation make an effort to come early to prayer of the service invite someone and let us push our way to the end even as the day approach it we gather more so may God richly bless you and have a right hand of fellowship and stay positive God bless you
