[36:06] richest blessing on the speakers and

[36:13] last two years to attend some of these
[36:16] services and they have been a rich
[36:18] blessing and was certainly looking
[36:21] forward to be a part of the service this
[36:24] year the enemy taught that kovat 19 will
[36:30] hinder our fellowship but God created us
[36:34] for fellowship with him and with each
[36:37] other so we certainly want to turn God
[36:40] this morning today that nothing can
[36:43] hinder that fellowship we give thanks to
[36:47] God that we can tap in to the fourth
[36:50] dimension we are thankful for the
[36:54] opportunity to use these gadgets as
[36:57] God's prophet tell us when it's working
[37:01] with God they are natural blessings that
[37:05] God has given us we bless God for the
[37:10] theme of these services the time of life
[37:15] and we look at it human beings has two
[37:21] changes in life to our young ones the
[37:26] time of life take them to puberty a time
[37:31] of
[37:32] body change described as God's prophet
[37:36] as a reckless age dangerous time of life
[37:41] where there's that movement from boy to
[37:44] man from girl to woman described as a
[37:50] frantic age and an age that we all
[37:55] brothers and sisters we went through so
[38:00] as parents today and as leaders we are
[38:04] called to suffer with them and to bear
[38:08] with our young ones as they go through
[38:12] the stresses of that change and use the
[38:18] word of God to be a support and a
[38:23] comforter a direction to them time of
[38:27] life takes us to our second change which
[38:32] is called menopause a change described
[38:37] as the worst of all in that change the
[38:42] devil run our sister's crazy how many
[38:46] times in the discernment line we had
[38:50] God's prophet picking up sisters that
[38:53] claim that he had all sorts of problems
[38:56] all sorts of serious matters that
[38:59] afflicted them they told her everything
[39:02] was wrong
[39:04] but it took the disarmament line that
[39:06] God's prophet could tell him nothing
[39:09] really is wrong with them that what was
[39:11] their real concern that is not been
[39:14] described preparing them for time like
[39:17] that a real dreary feeling after a
[39:23] terrible feeling your nerves get ripped
[39:26] a time of extreme nervousness and with
[39:31] all of that identifying to them that is
[39:34] not really something that is wrong what
[39:37] it is at the time of life a time a men
[39:42] of
[39:44] season of childbearing it was at that
[39:48] time Sara was told you are going to be
[39:52] young again she was told that in 20 days
[39:57] your life will start all over again so
[40:01] in that this time of life for their
[40:04] sisters God's prophet instructed us
[40:07] husbands it is the time if you ever was
[40:12] a sweetheart you ought to be a
[40:14] sweetheart then identifying to us is the
[40:19] time oh wise need us is the time we
[40:25] ought to be heir with one another we
[40:28] also saw sister Rebekah speaking of a
[40:32] dad would call her and share with her
[40:36] the reasons for her mother's behavior
[40:40] the reasons for what is going on in the
[40:44] home and a rift explained to her what a
[40:48] mama's problems when it come to that
[40:51] time of life and a time of life also
[40:56] that time of life also affect us men
[41:00] definitely is not physically but it is
[41:05] the time that maybe we like to look
[41:07] through the mirror the time when we want
[41:10] to be young again and we force to make
[41:14] certain physical changes in our body it
[41:18] was at such a time because prophet tells
[41:20] us it was rock fellow that leave his
[41:22] wife to marry his secretary what about
[41:27] the time of life we spoke over the time
[41:31] of life of the human body
[41:34] the time of life of our changes what
[41:40] about the time of life on our spiritual
[41:44] journey God's prophet show us that
[41:49] naturally this time in our life we
[41:52] should be anchored we should be strong
[41:56] we should be at our very best we should
[42:02] be mellow out the kid back of us should
[42:08] be out anyway the childhood things
[42:11] should be outside that kind of part
[42:14] should be all beat note we should be at
[42:18] a season settlin we had our best for the
[42:24] Lord just to share a quotation from with
[42:27] you from the message just one more time
[42:30] Lord and God's prophet is telling us
[42:33] here
[42:33] he's Eve God come to me and I want you
[42:38] to go to hurt and I was up there and he
[42:43] said go to hurt I am going to give you a
[42:47] hundred years peace of the knowledge but
[42:52] I want you to LUT your years what years
[42:59] you want to take you want to take the
[43:01] first 25 the second 25 or the third 25
[43:07] for the last 25 here it was God's
[43:12] providence showing us is if Illustrated
[43:16] that God would have asked him to choose
[43:20] a time of life to live if he would have
[43:24] chosen the first 25 the second 25 the
[43:30] third 25 for the last 25 and here
[43:34] identifying what a choice he would make
[43:37] say what would I say whenever I'm going
[43:40] to put my time here on a football player
[43:44] athlete or something I better take the
[43:47] first 25 if I'm going to be a carpenter
[43:51] or some pose like that I better take the
[43:54] second 25 but but if I want to serve the
[43:58] Lord I will take the last 25 from 75 to
[44:04] 100 why because I've accumulated
[44:09] much knowledge I know more about it see
[44:14] and as long as I go stand on my two feet
[44:17] and water water um what difference does
[44:23] it make how old I am I am here to serve
[44:28] the Lord that's good enough for me
[44:30] so he's identifying in time
[44:34] what does sort of choice he would have
[44:38] made as far as time is concerned what
[44:42] time of life way could be most useful to
[44:46] the Lord Jesus Christ so we look at all
[44:52] physical time of life we see times are
[44:57] changing
[44:58] nations change scenes change attitudes
[45:04] change or physical body change and we
[45:09] observe the course of human nature
[45:13] change but yet we turn God this morning
[45:17] for today what we're part of the world
[45:20] we are in what all we are here yet we
[45:23] contain God for the greatest change the
[45:27] change to be transformed the change to
[45:32] move this morning from a street singer
[45:35] to an angelic position and that change
[45:40] we went through a time of life those of
[45:44] us who faced with an experience a change
[45:47] that is called a paradox a change that
[45:52] is incredible it is unbelievable but yet
[45:58] it is true
[45:59] a miracle something that cannot be
[46:04] explained what a change
[46:07] God convert in your soul God change in
[46:12] my nature we read in the scriptures God
[46:17] lead in the chair of Israel without one
[46:21] feeble person that was
[46:22] it'd be rather what David challenged in
[46:26] Goliath
[46:28] we read about Moses in a one-man
[46:30] invasion we read about Samson killing a
[46:35] thousand Philistines with the jawbone of
[46:38] a mule we read of the Hebrew children in
[46:42] a fiery furnace we read about a floatin
[46:46] of the ark we read of this very earth
[46:49] being held all being great paradoxes yet
[46:56] the greatest products is to be a
[47:00] Christian God making a Christian all of
[47:04] us God converting us God change you know
[47:10] Anita it is like to tell a pig piggy you
[47:17] are no longer a pig but you alam kind of
[47:22] pig meat all is wrong to eat slop

[47:30] that pig will go right back into the
[47:34] wallow that pig will go right back into
[47:37] that wallow again because wallow in his
[47:41] hog net yeah so as long as a hog remain
[47:47] a hog with the nature of a hog he will
[47:51] go right back to wall and that's the
[47:54] reason people continue wallowing
[47:57] so-called Christians continue wallowing
[48:00] in sin we continue wallowing in sin amen
[48:04] because it because the process did not
[48:08] go through how to keep your hog out of
[48:12] the model change his Nydia the pig

[58:43] and the husk and the life was passing
[58:46] true it revealed justification and
[58:48] looter it reveals significant in Wesley
[58:50] it revealed a demon the Pupkin Holy
[58:53] Ghost in the Pentecostal Oh glory to God
[58:56] hallelujah
[58:58] forgive me tonight because something
[59:00] Oprah to me I'm so excited tonight
[59:02] it was the life passin true that

[59:07] was the light passing true that produced
[59:09] a doctrine of justification it was the
[59:11] life Oh glory the core and going to wrap
[59:14] the life with doctrines and teachings
[59:16] but it was the life okay the Lord show

[59:26] Wesley into Pentecost in the last days
[59:28] brethren can't you see the wheat is the
[59:31] first beginning it's not like a seed
[59:33] when it begins to fall like the seed is
[59:36] the husk is denominated now the green
[59:38] seed in the original fell in Nicaea for
[59:42] it was the first nomination here we go
[59:43] notice here the life that was in the
[59:47] stalk and tassel ends up in the seed the
[59:50] life that comes out of the original seed
[59:53] comes two different processes three
[59:56] different processes and then turned back
[59:58] to its original condition
[1:00:00] Oh glory to God he said I am the
[1:00:03] happiest person in the world that God
[1:00:06] but let me see this Oh glory to God in
[1:00:10] other words God heads the life with
[1:00:13] testimonies with mysteries with
[1:00:15] doctrines with Asians but it was the
[1:00:18] life all along and the devil can't touch
[1:00:21] that or give the Lord a shout holla
[1:00:24] it doesn't touch that so when men break
[1:00:27] the word interfering body under of the
[1:00:29] life Oh glory to God do you see what I'm
[1:00:33] saying
[1:00:34] that's my god hear the word being broken
[1:00:36] because once you break the rubber wrote
[1:00:39] the word you pick the channel but the
[1:00:41] life calls true because the word is the
[1:00:44] conduct of the Spirit or get the Lord a
[1:00:47] show or chlorine oh god that's right the
[1:00:50] first thing the angels came to do was to
[1:00:52] gather the scattered word to get
[1:00:54] everything lined up glory of God do you
[1:01:00] see you tonight
[1:01:01] notice the life that was in the sauce in
[1:01:05] the stalk and in the testicles in the
[1:01:08] seed what one went to make the other
[1:01:12] justification Mira way for certification
[1:01:15] sanctification
[1:01:17] Mira way for the Baptists of the Holy
[1:01:19] Ghost and the PAP tamale goes man away
[1:01:22] for the Holy Ghost itself
[1:01:24] to come down in perfection and back to
[1:01:27] the word again so course objective is to
[1:01:30] bring the church back to perfection and
[1:01:33] it could only do that by his word Oh
[1:01:38] glory to God
[1:01:40] well my my my man
[1:01:44] so sanctified scientific ation was at
[1:01:47] auction of the life identified by John
[1:01:50] Wesley hallelujah justification was
[1:01:56] identified by the life Martin Luther Oh
[1:01:58] glory to God so Elohim came unveil
[1:02:01] himself in Genesis 18 hallelujah to make
[1:02:05] way for him to come back in Luke 17
[1:02:08] today and feel himself in a profit sea
[1:02:11] mellow him hallelujah coming back again
[1:02:14] to speak to that bride to reveal Solomon
[1:02:18] to bring back original seed so he said
[1:02:22] the spoken word his original seed so
[1:02:24] that is why he said this is very
[1:02:26] important that the spirit and the
[1:02:28] prophet and the bride will say the same
[1:02:31] thing because the spoken word itself not
[1:02:34] the interpretation of the spoken word no
[1:02:37] no no no no no no the spoken word itself
[1:02:39] is the original seed so what is spoken
[1:02:42] by that prophet is not a prophet said
[1:02:44] that is hello him Oh glory to God I'm
[1:02:47] excited tonight hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:50] and Elohim stole hallelujah Ellen pick
[1:02:54] up some dust that painted tell Sarah the
[1:02:56] telegram I will return unto thee

[1:03:06] under heaven you can't force it you
[1:03:09] can't manufacture you can't bring it out
[1:03:12] the season and have a seasonal time or
[1:03:15] chlorine or color when the time of life
[1:03:17] isn't the season of the time of life no

[1:03:24] body just puppet Sarah unbelief - stop
[1:03:27] it it shall come to pass
[1:03:30] come upon Sarah Leggett alors - oh it's
[1:03:35] gonna come upon that bride it's gonna
[1:03:38] come up on you go either God so after
[1:03:55] the Pentecostal each it produced
[1:03:57] different denomination after the Prophet
[1:03:59] gone the same spirit produce different
[1:04:01] interpretation hallelujah but the
[1:04:04] original life have to press on can you

[1:08:17] from the unveiling of God he said first
[1:08:21] Timothy 3:16 without controversy great
[1:08:23] is the mystery of godliness Elohim
[1:08:26] capital G he said it's Elohim in the
[1:08:30] beginning Elohim without controversy
[1:08:33] great is the mystery of Elohim for Elwin
[1:08:39] was made flesh and we handed him Elohim
[1:08:43] field in human flesh that great Jehovah
[1:08:47] that covered all space-time and
[1:08:48] everywhere was made man we handed him
[1:08:51] then in swich like Abraham could not see
[1:08:54] that Sun no science no pregnancy of
[1:08:58] Sarah not even menstruation periods or
[1:09:01] anything but yet God said so is anything
[1:09:04] too hard for the Lord a dead woman and
[1:09:06] God says she gonna vagina
[1:09:09] say I had to be with that and God say
[1:09:11] you will be healed your foot and moving
[1:09:16] years I'm gon say good behavior walk

[1:09:22] I've tumor and it will be healed I have
[1:09:25] cancer and it will be healed is anything
[1:09:28] too hard for the Lord I think we have to
[1:09:31] shake off the unbelief or glory they
[1:09:33] wanna be convinced that the seed of
[1:09:35] Abraham let me say good the royal seed
[1:09:38] of Abraham the faith is what was to be
[1:09:41] restored back into the Gentile bride
[1:09:44] church what kind of faith royal see
[1:09:47] faith or glory to God that nothing is
[1:09:50] impossible
[1:09:51] Oh hallelujah praise God listen to this
[1:09:55] the streams of life a womb was dead his
[1:09:59] life in him was gone the stream of his
[1:10:02] life had dried up and her life was tried
[1:10:05] up within her what about Christians who
[1:10:09] like their dead but they have to come
[1:10:14] back to life because you have a promise
[1:10:16] of a return or glory to God hallelujah
[1:10:19] praise God a transformation within and a
[1:10:24] transformation without or glory to God
[1:10:27] yet he staggered not at the promise of
[1:10:29] cultural belief but was strong given
[1:10:31] prayers knowing that God was able to
[1:10:33] perform anything he said he would do
[1:10:35] there is the way we got to believe that
[1:10:37] would today how is it going to be I
[1:10:39] don't know but court said it's going to
[1:10:42] be that way and that settle it who is
[1:10:44] this great unseen person who is this
[1:10:47] Abraham seen and visions right at last
[1:10:49] true he was manifested in flesh before
[1:10:52] the Sun King God came to Abraham in the
[1:10:54] form of a man in the end time Oh
[1:10:56] hallelujah
[1:10:58] that was the first time not the second
[1:11:01] time it wasn't a man the second time it

[1:11:41] prophet and he he only he Lord he nobody

[1:12:27] parade a man in front of me put that be
[1:12:29] fault God said behold I send Elijah and
[1:12:33] he shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:12:34] back to the faith of the father's Oh
[1:12:37] glory to God we believe that hallelujah
[1:12:41] hallelujah so he was manifested in flesh
[1:12:43] before the Sun King who is a son Isaac
[1:12:47] so in other words before body change God
[1:12:51] was villain flesh before body change to
[1:12:56] produce the Sun and before you could
[1:12:59] produce son of God God's and God was
[1:13:03] veiled in a prophet because the only way
[1:13:06] you could produce a son is for the seed
[1:13:09] of the Sun to come in you because this
[1:13:12] word had to be formed galvanized another
[1:13:17] building steel is not a building
[1:13:19] concrete is not a building see matters
[1:13:22] of the building gravels of a building
[1:13:24] that's the material to make up the
[1:13:25] building but the building not to be
[1:13:27] formed or glory to God on this image
[1:13:32] has to be formed even the bees have an
[1:13:35] image and life have to come to give
[1:13:38] power to the bees
[1:13:39] and the brighter the image look at the
[1:13:42] fit thank you
[1:13:45] knowledge temperance is sung in steel
[1:13:49] but it's just as real temperance
[1:13:52] patience godliness I know you're fed up
[1:13:55] hear it but it have brotherly Kairos and
[1:13:58] Papa that oh god help me this morning
[1:14:00] I'm theatres miss the pun forgiveness
[1:14:03] and first to break into the King Macau
[1:14:06] fail which is the Holy Ghost itself
[1:14:08] which is charity the voice of the
[1:14:11] Archangel what give the Lord a show yes
[1:14:20] upon forgiveness have to pull down that
[1:14:22] gear Oh hallelujah glory to God
[1:14:27] hallelujah let's continue he said in the
[1:14:31] beginning was the word the Word was with
[1:14:33] God in the beginning was hello him I'm
[1:14:36] not saying that the prophecy now and the
[1:14:38] beginning was hello him an Elohim became
[1:14:41] the word and the word was Elohim and the
[1:14:44] word was made Elohim
[1:14:46] it's the same thing just unfolding he
[1:14:50] was LOM the eternal but in him of
[1:14:53] thoughts he wanted to become material
[1:14:56] what did he do he spoke a word and the
[1:14:59] word was materialized and that's the
[1:15:01] whole picture from Genesis to Revelation
[1:15:04] it's nothing wrong
[1:15:06] it is Elohim materializing so he can be
[1:15:10] touched and feel and in the Millennium
[1:15:14] there is Elohim system on the shroom
[1:15:16] that's right we always suppress around
[1:15:18] him that he predestinated before the
[1:15:21] foundation of the world so number one it
[1:15:24] is before the beginning the Eternal
[1:15:26] Spirit who hallelujah is not right
[1:15:29] number two is the word as the blue goes
[1:15:33] oh ha before number one spirit self
[1:15:36] existing one existing with the thoughts
[1:15:39] no family yet just thinking about the
[1:15:42] family because when in foreign two logos
[1:15:44] becomes you
[1:15:45] caught with his family that's a
[1:15:47] different thing I wanted dinner and then
[1:15:49] from the Lowe's the word became flesh
[1:15:52] but before the beginning was spirit whoa
[1:15:55] and if we have to go back we have to go
[1:15:57] back to spirit or glory that caught
[1:16:00] because the word the Lois came and
[1:16:01] produced the beginning in the beginning
[1:16:03] was the word but the world was hello him
[1:16:05] and hello him was the word
[1:16:07] that's why when Jesus came he said the
[1:16:09] words that I speak unto you they are
[1:16:11] spirit and they are life or glory no God
[1:16:16] oh yes yes yes
[1:16:20] the word is spirit the mystery or glory
[1:16:27] of God the spirit was hiding in the word
[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:38] my god I'm the happiest man that God
[1:16:42] would let me see that
[1:16:43] Oh glory to God hallelujah that Caprice
[1:16:47] message to the blue in the face you have
[1:16:49] to see the spirit hiding in the world
[1:16:51] you said the words that I speak their
[1:16:53] spirit and their life because you know
[1:16:56] in the world of the gym and the gym have
[1:16:59] the potential so he could about one so
[1:17:01] you could put a seed lay in here for
[1:17:03] years for 30 years nothing to him
[1:17:05] looking dead looking like his nothing
[1:17:08] when you take that same seed for 30
[1:17:10] years and put it in the ground and then
[1:17:13] you see life that the comfort the life
[1:17:15] is dear because God said that every seed
[1:17:17] Oh glory to God bring thought after it's
[1:17:21] time taught himself could he get nothing
[1:17:24] until he spoke the seed for the thing
[1:17:27] that he wanted he said let there be
[1:17:29] light
[1:17:30] and I see when told him God it was a
[1:17:34] word seed and when that world began to
[1:17:36] manifest and there was light God Himself
[1:17:39] can't bypass that word that's why he
[1:17:43] said my word shall not return unto me
[1:17:46] void but it shall
[1:17:48] completion the purpose is to accomplish
[1:17:51] or clarita but there is a neural time of
[1:17:54] life coming that's here it's no it's for
[1:17:59] you believe it don't you like it believe
[1:18:03] for that we do fight on your own the
[1:18:09] question whether or not what the prophet
[1:18:12] prophesied will come to pass hallelujah
[1:18:15] or glory to God let's go to again number
[1:18:18] one spirit Elohim self-existent one
[1:18:22] returner number two loaves word in the
[1:18:27] beginning a number three the word
[1:18:29] becoming flesh margin divorce he said
[1:18:32] God is ready if he isn't doing it now
[1:18:35] he's going to call it truth to
[1:18:36] perfection buyers would Jesus Christ
[1:18:39] quality restore what perfection oh I
[1:18:44] read even some more I'm in the spirit
[1:18:46] down and from question as I said God was
[1:18:49] this great spirit we pictured him the
[1:18:52] seven colors of the rainbow it's not
[1:18:56] some man put that together
[1:18:58] that's his Holy Ghost speaking to the
[1:18:59] Prophet quad was spirit who is that the
[1:19:02] seven colors of the rainbow
[1:19:06] hallelujah the power and the cover the
[1:19:09] earth he said what now God is eternal
[1:19:11] and he was perfect perfect love perfect
[1:19:16] peace perfect joy perfect satisfaction
[1:19:20] all those seven spirits as we get into
[1:19:25] revelations they come out and make up
[1:19:27] God was perfection
[1:19:31] so them seven virtues them seven
[1:19:35] rainbows and no beginner no stacked that
[1:19:38] was before the beginning
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:43] seven spirits the rainbow that was
[1:19:47] before the levels the spirit there's no
[1:19:50] argument with that when that come down
[1:19:54] Mansell is dead when that come down I
[1:19:57] hate myself when that pomme d'amore
[1:20:00] flesh shall glory Oh
[1:20:03] Oh get the Lord some praises now a man
[1:20:10] who argued on fostering they have never
[1:20:11] ready but into the presence of God the
[1:20:15] hair as I preached before Isaac said
[1:20:17] whoa before as I say worries me he was
[1:20:19] but I want to you want to you want to
[1:20:23] you he again presents yet when God put
[1:20:26] the proper Monday on King Uzziah died
[1:20:29] and I say I hit that temple and that
[1:20:33] presence had to come down the hood holy
[1:20:35] and I'm Sarah such a fight back and
[1:20:36] forth
[1:20:37] he bought words me no one to you at all
[1:20:39] when you look in the mirror is me
[1:20:41] talking alone
[1:20:42] Harlan lying trouble I am worthy I ain't
[1:20:46] no good I am stripped I am just like
[1:20:49] everybody else or glory no God give the
[1:20:53] Lord some praises hallelujah that man
[1:20:56] who spoke for God he said hallelujah
[1:20:59] praise God hallelujah I want cause he
[1:21:02] needs consequence them lips my lips are
[1:21:04] on cleaner i men that speaking for God a
[1:21:07] prophet when he got into presence
[1:21:10] Oh glory to God and that's why he said
[1:21:12] the fit isn't right
[1:21:13] he said we need to lay in the presence
[1:21:15] of the Sun and get ripen and God bring
[1:21:19] us into July where we could be ripen by
[1:21:22] the hot July Sun Lord bringing us and
[1:21:25] the presence return us to a time of life
[1:21:28] that she kinda could come over the
[1:21:30] seasons are you and bring back the
[1:21:33] original glory original manner the
[1:21:36] original experience that's why I said
[1:21:38] when a church is groaning under the
[1:21:40] pressure under the persecution stop the
[1:21:43] Holy Ghost
[1:21:44] just as real as it was until Pentecost
[1:21:48] hold it girl hold it cry but when they
[1:21:50] are born
[1:21:51] I'm positionally point and God sets in
[1:21:54] the church or give the Lord a shout
[1:21:56] there's got to be a bunch of people
[1:21:58] recalling the Holy Ghost punch they cut
[1:22:01] to be a bunch of people that believe
[1:22:03] that the Holy Ghost is just as real I am
[1:22:06] owner knew Holy Ghost
[1:22:07] I wanna model Holy Ghost I want the same
[1:22:10] only go Street I got the same only goes
[1:22:12] Paul had same sensation same emotions
[1:22:19] same same it's the same Holy Ghost there
[1:22:26] is one Lord come on
[1:22:27] one spirit one baptism so all those
[1:22:38] spirits they come make up God was
[1:22:42] perfection everything else here we go
[1:22:46] outside of that has been something that
[1:22:49] has been polluted from that so
[1:22:52] everything outside the rainbow is a
[1:22:55] perversion
[1:22:56] that's why we say in the last days the
[1:22:58] battle would be second Peter one four to
[1:23:01] seven verses everything else you hear
[1:23:07] what I said daddy but already heavy and
[1:23:11] high-minded lovers pleasure second
[1:23:12] Timothy church members had to fight that
[1:23:15] alone then they fight with the man who
[1:23:19] was the would know they have to fight
[1:23:21] and battle by the word working through
[1:23:23] the man not talking to the money
[1:23:26] somebody sort of working with came to
[1:23:30] the man so the world after come on work
[1:23:33] that's not too hard to believe Jesus
[1:23:37] said the same words denied that I do
[1:23:41] shall you do also so it's not hard to
[1:23:45] talk about words right people might be
[1:23:47] afraid that's all they like they talk
[1:23:49] about they talk but have a work and this
[1:23:52] fight for ministry every talk ministry
[1:23:55] the work of the ministry and define of
[1:23:59] the body is a world killer hallelujah
[1:24:02] the same work he said I do
[1:24:04] Jesus was working wasn't just grunting
[1:24:06] lazy and lame in the wrong you know he
[1:24:08] was at work on the bride after work
[1:24:10] because the spirit of the monk the bride
[1:24:13] with spirit the same spirit that came to
[1:24:16] Ibrahim after come to the bride to get
[1:24:19] the by the voice you have no voice of
[1:24:22] y'all the spirit out to give you the
[1:24:24] voice to pick up revelation 22:17 the
[1:24:28] spirit and the bride or glory look good
[1:24:32] because you yourself become Louis with
[1:24:35] Oh glory to God and the spirit out the
[1:24:39] right you go to the Lord a shout do you
[1:24:43] see it now glorious got to be a time of
[1:24:47] life it's impossible for there not to be
[1:24:53] [Music]
[1:24:55] your plans are corn seed it going to
[1:24:58] processes stock the leaves we toss a die
[1:25:04] not watch a plant it get tall its look
[1:25:06] autologous they can't eat that didn't
[1:25:11] know so much they leave so big in the
[1:25:13] little seat buddy yeah a change in form
[1:25:17] it's going to processes the life in its
[1:25:20] start to reveal itself so it seemed
[1:25:22] leaves go in so looking like a young lad
[1:25:26] then you look like it twelve years old
[1:25:28] they look like a teenager
[1:25:30] many countries had a look like an adult
[1:25:32] then inside they get full my mature and
[1:25:34] you'll see something come out looking
[1:25:36] like fruit there is have this shiny
[1:25:39] rotating at the end the corn here
[1:25:41] because they can fresh a nice you can
[1:25:45] pick it them it's a ready yet it not
[1:25:48] mature yet you have to wait till that
[1:25:49] get dry then you film when you pick that
[1:25:53] comes up to peel that off you can boil
[1:25:54] electrical rule they stay where you
[1:25:56] plant your plant SC take a back a seed
[1:25:59] gonna expect to get about the same thing
[1:26:01] that I demand we took the money up you
[1:26:03] bury my money your berry when I gives
[1:26:05] you a barrier talent
[1:26:06] what I expect that when God come back he
[1:26:08] said up to your feet you have to add
[1:26:10] something you have got more now I wanna
[1:26:12] give you plug Gary books and paste will
[1:26:14] you expect predict to get back board
[1:26:16] sale or look at books the bucket tips no
[1:26:19] no no no no but that can work we have to
[1:26:21] give God more than that we play in tips
[1:26:24] since then these seven TV playing tips
[1:26:26] you can forget about your playing tips
[1:26:28] though them tears how to become flesh
[1:26:30] them caves have become alive that will
[1:26:33] have to become flesh and that word as I
[1:26:35] live there has to be a time of life not
[1:26:39] a time a talk time of life or give the
[1:26:44] law some praises hallelujah so the only
[1:26:48] way we can come back the perfection is
[1:26:52] to come back to that perfection which is
[1:26:55] God a halt so when that which is perfect
[1:27:00] is come then that which is in part is
[1:27:03] done away with so therefore we have to
[1:27:07] wait for this age that perfection could
[1:27:10] reveal as revealed by malachi for not
[1:27:16] just a perfection alone like elijah tell
[1:27:18] the brothers those if I fall safe I fall
[1:27:20] as revealed by the prophet of Malachi
[1:27:23] for because he revealed the fivefold
[1:27:25] ministry is the Ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:27:28] died on on man ministry announced
[1:27:31] aborting and I know man ministry dies
[1:27:35] the Ministry of Jesus Christ but abandom
[1:27:37] had it and the bride will have it you
[1:27:40] say you know what I'm waiting on Oh
[1:27:42] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:27:45] Ministry of Jesus Christ was manifested
[1:27:48] and before he had it in him as person he
[1:27:50] said I represent the fit by way of a
[1:27:54] divine gift yeah had a gift of divine
[1:27:57] healing or glory to occur until the
[1:27:59] angel stepped into him and come to the
[1:28:01] unveiling of the mighty God God was
[1:28:03] veiled in him but before that he had a
[1:28:05] gift don't care Christ and to prove the
[1:28:08] gospel which signs one of the miracles
[1:28:10] or glory of God then the giver came
[1:28:13] inside of him
[1:28:14] and we are promised the giver to be in
[1:28:15] this bride because once more the world
[1:28:18] will get pirate from God direct not
[1:28:21] plane a book not playing a tape die like
[1:28:24] from God because God will be veiling the
[1:28:26] bride and you can't unveil what to never
[1:28:28] view whatever the fear in the bride
[1:28:31] they're gonna rip the veil off the bride
[1:28:32] then you will see Jesus manifested
[1:28:35] Christ filled in our flesh their life
[1:28:40] like it wasn't Moses or till the Lord a
[1:28:44] shout quad was building Moses when
[1:28:47] Moody's people flights might have to
[1:28:49] come I know where they're coming from
[1:28:51] but they have to come because God was
[1:28:53] speaking to Moses okay the Lord I show
[1:28:56] when I'm nipa 10 speak the miraculous
[1:29:00] take place
[1:29:01] nobody can comment tell me the other
[1:29:03] militants that know miraculous that can
[1:29:06] work that cannot work miraculous
[1:29:11] indicates omnipotence so he said and
[1:29:13] prophesy wait tell them seven thunders
[1:29:16] uttered their voices to that group that
[1:29:19] could take the word on hundred ear
[1:29:21] why why why yeah they take you would
[1:29:23] first they were slice and cut they could
[1:29:25] shut the heavens they could open up the
[1:29:27] heavens they could do whatever they want

[1:52:20] showing them and not any prophets
[1:52:21] message hallelujah what I love what is
[1:52:24] profit when the angel came he said he
[1:52:26] went and checked these scriptures he
[1:52:29] wasn't taking agency the agency he said
[1:52:31] he went and searched in the scriptures
[1:52:34] to compare what the injures same with
[1:52:36] what the scriptures see because you
[1:52:38] cannot let her injure talk about the
[1:52:40] scripture enemy angel talking about a
[1:52:42] person
[1:52:42] you come from let me get your name again
[1:52:45] I don't want to talk about your wing I
[1:52:46] see a wing but we're talking and what
[1:52:49] the Bible talking so you have to tell me
[1:52:52] where you come from you say a flight on
[1:52:55] flight dog I think you fly from below
[1:52:59] because Paul said if I angel come down
[1:53:01] from heaven and preach any other gospel
[1:53:03] so he was he come on heaven when known
[1:53:05] below when I come back up
[1:53:07] fallen angels fall straight down and
[1:53:09] then only the lower regions get some
[1:53:11] doctrine wrong they become a mother lode
[1:53:13] of doctrines and all kind of thing is
[1:53:15] important I spit it do have enough down
[1:53:17] there it's a bottomless pit you know so

[1:53:31] silly woman lead with divers lusts about
[1:53:33] a bunch of people with engineers and
[1:53:38] even the Prophet said that and the
[1:53:41] probabilities are not evenly possible
[1:53:44] did you reveal that yeah they not for me
[1:53:53] because when the Prophet was told to
[1:53:55] gotten on right he said the secret is
[1:53:57] the Wooden's and the bride and no man
[1:53:59] could make them do otherwise so we had
[1:54:02] he talked but we're not doing that we
[1:54:03] have a word to follow is the word of the
[1:54:06] Lord that's already accord the Prophet
[1:54:08] said believe what the Prophet said Oh

[1:58:48] me none stingy yellow God look at the
[1:58:50] character let my clothes he said what is
[1:58:54] it it's back to the word but pains he
[1:58:57] says watch back to the life systems
[1:59:00] doesn't have life it is only the word
[1:59:02] that has life the systems are built
[1:59:05] around it where does not have life so
[1:59:08] they have built systems are wrong in
[1:59:10] this message around the life of the
[1:59:12] prophet release
[1:59:13] but the systems don't have life it is
[1:59:16] the wood that have life Oh glory to God
[1:59:19] and the classic of that whole thing here
[1:59:22] is when Jesus came Jesus tell sister
[1:59:26] scriptures we just searched the text
[1:59:29] search the books and the tips for in
[1:59:32] them you think you have eternal life but
[1:59:36] the ideal at the center of me
[1:59:37] so that is Scripture and that is text
[1:59:39] written he said but you wouldn't come to
[1:59:41] me that you might have life so what he
[1:59:44] was saying that I am the life not the
[1:59:47] text but I have the life the life is
[1:59:53] living and this is oh hallelujah a
[1:59:59] living voice so he is showing them
[2:00:04] life was beyond the text and they taught
[2:00:09] by having the text they had the life but
[2:00:13] the text was only hosen the revelation
[2:00:16] of the life so when the life came the
[2:00:21] life came to the temple and said
[2:00:23] destruction this scripture here is
[2:00:29] fulfilled in your ears because my time
[2:00:34] has come my time of life has come i sat
[2:00:38] down for 18 years here in every
[2:00:41] interpretation of me by text and it was
[2:00:45] wrong but I'm here now understand the
[2:00:49] scripture is fulfilled in your ears this
[2:00:56] is too much for me my lord hallelujah
[2:01:00] hallelujah final quarter I'm done he
