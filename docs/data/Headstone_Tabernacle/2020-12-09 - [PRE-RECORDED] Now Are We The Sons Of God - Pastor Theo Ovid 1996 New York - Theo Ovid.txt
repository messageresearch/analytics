says i am writing to tell you about how i was delivered thursday night after brother oblato's message i had a naught in my heart and i knew i had to make it right however the devil kept telling me to wait and i kept giving in to him while brother oblato was preaching i knew that i wouldn't receive anything from god until i made everything right but i was still battling my pride then brother obado said that the lord had just spoken to him and that we shouldn't leave the building until we had made everything right i knew that god had spoken directly to me i overcame my pride and walked over to the brother and i asked him to forgive me and as he was hugging me the lord took over and totally delivered me there is nothing too hard for the lord [Applause] [Music] hallelujah he said i am free there are no words to express how i feel and i am now anticipating a glorious filling of the holy ghost thank you for your stand for the message and your burden for the young people i know that uh we are in another book of acts praise the lord god is setting his people free glory be to god and that's what this meeting is all about brother branham said when you get over on the other side nothing will make it over there except perfect love and if we're going to live together with each other amen we've got to get straight with each other now praise god and that's the presence that dropped down last night amen are you free this morning are you ready for the word well this morning i believe there's uh the fire is gonna fall we have with us this morning uh it's a blessed privilege and an honor to bring to the platform brother theo ovitt from trinidad praise this wonderful name i appreciate him i love him he doesn't need any introduction we all know who he is amen so i wonder if we could uh sing this song love lifted me as an old song i know most of you know it but love lifted me when nothing else could help love lifted me as he comes to the pulpit did me when nothing else could help love love lifted me love lifted me when nothing else could help lifted me he's here to lift you up this morning turn around and tell somebody as brother ovid comes lifted me love lifted me when nothing else could help [Music] i sing it one more time [Music] me [Music] thank you jesus hallelujah glory be to jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah thank you lord thank you jesus let us bow here so with a prayer almighty god how we thank you for the divine love that came among us lord god we are so unworthy but lord when divine love projects suffering grace takes over father may your love project one more time and bless your people and deliver and set captive free and may each year leave here with a liberty where christ has set them free or we thank you for the service last night are we thank you for dating a pill of fire moving in our midst the greatest force there is the greatest power there is the love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong oh as the songwriter said it shall forever more endure the saints an angel song now we thank you for the love that lift us up lord into heavenly places in christ jesus where we could see who we are where we could know where we come from where we could know where we are going where we could have a purpose in our hearts and a desire in our hearts oh god are we thank you that you could drop down and brotherly kindness lord forgiveness a given up desire to make things right and to repent one towards the other and to straighten up lord knowing that we prepare for this soon coming knowing that we prepared to catch that headstone knowing that there must be an atmosphere for that headstone to drop down and now we thank you for each message of preparation lord to put that in our hearts that we have got to be prepared for your soon coming so bless the servant this morning and in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you you may be seated praise be to jesus we don't want to greet you in the precious name of jesus on behalf of the headstone tomato trinidad and wife here san marino we so glad to be here and we thank coleman and the new york church ministry for this opportunity for having us here today to share the word of god and i know if the meeting will close off now it'll be voted every way to be here amen and how i tangled for last night in particular and all the other services gone before but my i truly believe that divine love filtered down inside of here last night amen and you know i guess many of you may think about what it was like when brother brown was here i think about it many times you know and sometimes i like to hear stories of what it was back there live and you know the testimonies and so on but last night was special i felt that that angel was was in the camp moving back and forth and it tells me that something tremendous is fixing to happen and oblato said it the tremendous victory in the love divine so today and from here on out i'm looking for that tremendous victory in love divine you know we are going to have it because god promised him hallelujah an unbelief doesn't stop god hallelujah glory no we are going to have divine love we are going to be a possessor of divine love hallelujah you believe that oh praise god so while you're standing if you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to luke 24 romans 8 and 1st john 3. praise god reading from luke 24 verse 49 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you by tarrying the city of jerusalem until he be endured powerful and high and as he let them out as far as the bettany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen romans 8 i want to read from verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs ears of god and joint is with christ it shall be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god and from first john 3 reading from verse 1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knowed us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god but it does not appear what we shall be but we know that when we shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that had this hope in him purified himself even as he is pure may god a blessing to read him his word you may be seated be the name of the lord for title this morning now are we the sons of god inspiration the promise of the father blessed be the name of the lord praise be to jesus amen when the son of man commit shall he find the faith on the earth because the the faith has been restored back by malachi 4 that's what he was sent for he said it will take these divinely revealed mystery truths to turn the hearts of the turret literally back to the fate of the fathers and that fate was identified last night not just any kind of faith but the fate itself defeat that works by love so love have to come to the faith praise god amen hallelujah isn't that right of our message hearing recognizing uh he's talking about jacob and he said no a spiritual man any spiritual man today and spiritual woman that's elected predestinated of god to come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they got if they have to take their name off of every church book in the nation they still want that birthright it's the only thing that matters to them just get that birthright no matter at what level they have to come on if they have to get down at the altar and cry and boohoo if they have to run to the places and go back and make things right and give away everything they have and become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter they want the birthright that's all they're interested in the birthright don't blame them people they can't help it praise god we can't help it to be hungering and thirsting we can't help him oh because divine love is the only thing to enter in isn't that right you may be seated now jacob the reason that he chose to find that birthright regardless he wanted to get it because he knowed that the birthright held the blessing it helped life he didn't care how it come just so he got it and that's the main thing what plane had come on didn't matter he wanted it he must have it he have got to get it blessed that day that hung unto us for righteousness for they shall be filled he was on his road and after he received it oh do you feel that way this morning that you have got to get it there's something we have to strive onto oh hallelujah glory oh man you maybe see that so no matter how much persecution how much persecution how many evil things they say how many times they call holy roller how much time they say those evil thing the church will move on it is staying in the word of god now anyone know the seed of god is the birthright the baptism of the holy ghost ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed till the day of your redemption or when you are born again they were filled with the holy spirit now the holy spirit is the new birth we know that you are begotten of the spirit i'll admit that but until you are born there's a baby is begotten in the mother's womb that's one kind of a life that's little cells twisting and kicking and jumping but when it is born he squeals out and become a living soul oh blessed be the name he said what the church needed a gospel spanking to wake it up praise god the squeal to eternal life hallelujah pride had not a revivalist yet it will take them seven thunders to wake up praise god to bring a gospel spanking to bring seven foot pains hallelujah prayers be to jesus oh hallelujah so what it needs is a gospel spec to wake it up and squeal to eternal life you may be seated and the holy spirit screams in it like it never screamed before to a new creature hallelujah born of the spirit then he begins to grow and to move and have it speed in god hallelujah just as the natural birth baby come into the world spiritual baby pour again of the holy ghost hallelujah then you begin to move and operate as a son of god hallelujah and as many that led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god hallelujah oh you may be seated i want you to know this morning you are children of promise you don't belong to the woman hallelujah you belong to the free woman hallelujah you are royal seeds of abraham hallelujah oh it's the promise of the father hallelujah no church didn't promise you no bishop didn't promise you your father gave you a promise before i send my promise upon you hallelujah or glory to god hallelujah he said i personal pronoun i send my promise upon you oh hallelujah oh glory hallelujah praise god you may be seated oh man oh hallelujah so the holy ghost is the new bird we know that it's being born again oh man if you have been called from from darkness to light from death unto life from a formal intellectual conception of christ to a born-again experience and watching your life that it lays inside of things as a world aside and you stand for christ regardless then something has happened there is something in you hungering and moving like it wasn't jacob you wrestle with the lord you walk differently after that something a different you are change oh my hallelujah praise god now from the smirnion churches book he said now we are coming to the conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and then jesus dwelt the fullness of the goddess bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternaliness thoughts in our turn become the many members spoken word seed manifesting flesh and those eternal thoughts no manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed we could be quickened hallelujah oh hallelujah my my mind oh hallelujah you are not now becoming seed because you are seed you could be reborn oh hallelujah glory thank you jesus he said we will also show you that there's a group of people whose names haven't been placed on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances have those names removed the names under the blood section of that book under no circumstances no circumstances no trial no testing no tribulation no opposition hallelujah under no circumstances could those names be removed hallelujah hallelujah sealed those names oh hallelujah you may be seated praise god hallelujah how do you feel about you this morning i said now are we the sons of god oh hallelujah brother hallelujah we have got to see it present tense now say it is you may be seen it from souls in prison he came forth and took the book out to the right hand of him that sat upon the throne time was no more and immediately the angel appeared and swore that time was no longer but you see in this book was what was redeemed it was the book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book so when the angel came down he brought your name hallelujah and no redemption present tense by power to break the dominion of sin that you can be redeemed by power and he said behold i send the promise of the father and you shall receive power present tense power carry in jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high you may be seated you may be that he died for was written in the book and he could not leave his militarily seat until he had thoroughly redeemed and he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the lamb's book of life and he had to stay to make intercession until that last person was finished now he didn't say he's gonna halfway redeem you he's going to redeem you three quarter way you're going to have 50 deliverance 60 80 percent a hundred percent there's gonna be a total deliverance [Applause] oh hallelujah may you maybe see them oh man you maybe see them memorial letters the level he said now when the word see each group had separated over the interpretation of the word so when the word has no effect it's the traditional man being preached because the words supposed to be effective whatever words are preached is supposed to bring faith it's supposed to have effect upon the people and bring the holy ghost and bring the anointing and refillings and ceilings and so forth so if ministers is preaching what they claim to be the word and is of no effect it's tradition of man that's the same thing jesus found when he came here they had left the word and made a word of no effect by the traditions and that's what the groups have done today making the real full promise of god the real promise of no effect by their traditions just like my wife she has claims on me as a husband my daughter another woman female has no claims and me as husband i'm a father to her and then my grandson has no claims on me as father or husband he has claims on me as a grandfather i'm the same person so he come reveal himself as son of man that would be god the word that comes to the prophet and he was revealing the word to the age by son of man and in the church age he revealed himself a son of god the holy spirit through revelation has to reveal now in the last day it has to come back again to the word promise what is promised to the brag like brother jesse said last night exclusive bright promise [Applause] what is exclusively belongs to the bride the seven thunders wasn't set together church members critics skeptics make believers it wasn't said for that it's come to separate them from the bride hallelujah it came to bring a separation hallelujah that's why you are called out by the shouts amen you may be seen there oh my hallelujah praise god from god's covenant with abraham he said no we are sons of god daughters of god we are sitting together in heavenly places he said now present tense every man a woman or boy a girl has been born again of god and received the holy spirit is settled in heavenly places or where as many as two or three a guard amen promise to be in the midst now some people goes by feeling i am not saved because i feel like i'm saved the devil can beat you around that stump every day on that i'm not saved because i feel like i'm saved i'm saved because i met god's requirements god called me and i accepted it and by faith i believe it whether i feel good whether i feel like it or not i am anyhow because god said so hallelujah you may be seated jesus never said did you feel it he said did you believe it so it is based solemnly upon the finished works of christ at calvary so every redemptive blessing belongs to the believer so when you become a christian god gives you a checkbook with jesus name sign at the bottom of it and anything you have need of i am that i am hallelujah sign his name you may be seated you say are you afraid to cash it fill it out send it to the headquarters and see what god will do about it oh blessed be the name of the lord praise be to jesus so you say you might go to the hospital in the morning they say well your arm is still stiff your cancer is still there that wouldn't have one speck that wouldn't faze you a bit fate does anything no in you is god you have the holy ghost god is in you do you believe that no jesus said i give you power let me show you the weakness of the church by god's grace i give you power over unclean spirits you cast them out then i will you will you will cast them out in my name they will cast out devils they shall speak with new towns i'll take they'll take up serpents they oh my think about jesus right here present tense speaking to his disciples and said nobody about me you are going to do it you are going to be there you are going to cast those devils out you're going to run them out the tongue you're gonna run them out your home you're gonna run them off your family you wanna speak a new tongue praise god if you take up any deadly thing it wouldn't harm you praise god oh man now listen to this you may be seated you see you've got the holy ghost it's operating in your body well when that old snake grabbed a hole a poor hand there was not a bit of scare he looked at it like that he shook it off in the fire and went on he got some more stick it didn't scare him you see if you're scared jesus said why did you fear and peter come walking in the water doing fine until he steamed the waves of contrary and then he got scared and began to sink and jesus come and pick him up and said why did you fear oh yeah a little faith fair you are scared it won't happen don't have one bit of fear move forward god said so but you can't do that until you have love and perfect love cast out all fear and when we love god with all our hearts souls and minds and we love one another as ourselves our neighbors as ourselves the people can actually feel that oh hallelujah you can't make believe cause they will know it praise god in many many men even the dog knew when the master loved him praise god the dog gonna wag his tail praise go when the master comes home that little dog begin to wag his tail because there's something connecting hallelujah praise god and when divine love began to move in the church man you're gonna feel something you're gonna know something praise god it's to break you down brother branham said i wish i had it all the time praise god i got a taste of it oh my god this divine love there's a voice you know of love oh hallelujah you know love of a voice thank you jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my god oh love spoke to the bull lord spoke to the bees lord spoke to that maniac man love have a voice oh hallelujah hallelujah praise god the our common knowledge when they that are in the grave shall hear the voice of god hallelujah praise god i wonder if all seven voices will become that one voice of the archangel charity the pride absolute i wonder today if the praise god the cloud has been turned and not just seven angels but the cloud hallelujah hanging over the building hanging over the people the cap himself oh hallelujah glory oh because it must come back to one lord it's gonna come back to one faith they're gonna come back to one baptism but come back to that oh man you already see them oh man if those seven voices come into one voice who am i oh hallelujah the voice of the archangel then the one with the weak white wig is here oh hallelujah praise god is another part of scripture that must be fulfilled to declare the day of vengeance of our god then that must be his ministry the ministry of jesus christ and that is promise friends it is promise an unbelief wouldn't in the head no one will stop it it will be oh hallelujah the same god that promised behold i sent you elijah there's the same god that said ephesians 4 for god i'm set in the church through their labor pains prophet teaches evangelists hallelujah and the same god that brought forth elijah to turn around back to the faith of the father promised that there will be a fightful ministry to pour the virtues into the church for it going to flow out then something must come in in order to flow out because peter said silver and gold i don't have i know what i have i know what god gave me oh glory to god such as i have i give it unto you hallelujah glory to god those dynamics was flowing through peter oh it was on his shadow it was in his hands it was in his feet it was in his voice it was in his mind they had the mind of christ they were led by the spirit of christ and i say this morning now are we the sons of god it taught me to play what we shall be but we know when we see him we are going to be like him the bible says so we are going to be like him who is him faith virtue knowledge temperance patience cockiness probably kindness charity that's him oh my you may be seated hallelujah [Music] i'm invisible you know the bride he said no remember you say well we believe this but we don't believe that we believe that the thunder's in our way but that's shouting and that rejoicing read your bible after christ give them the promise they were continually not part-time no no no they were continually hallelujah glory to god because i know i'm going to be still i know i'm going to be sealed and no one will be baptized with divine law some may as well shout about it i may as well be happy about it because i got a revelation and revelations of purchase and power about oh man [Applause] you may be seated so if you're married to christ christ is the word of god it's in john 1 chapter 7 the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us now christ was the living word he always wants the word he still is the word he's always will be the word he he was only the manifestation of the attributes of god for he was the son of god and any son is the attribute of his father and just as you were in the genius of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the bedding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the earth and become in the image of your father then he could fellowship with you and so were you sons and daughters of god before there was even a moon stars molecule you were sons and daughters of god for you are present tense you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in god at the beginning you may be seated for there is only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know anything when you were on the earth earthly father but you were manifested in his image in the image of god you are made and you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of god and therefore as sure as your genes had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual genes had to be in god because you are an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world he said that's right that there's no way around it [Applause] hallelujah so elohim with all his thoughts could not fellowship with them unless they become expressed hallelujah mine so then he had to become jehovah god with his family you know how long you want that fellowship with you for the fullness of time to come to the fullness of the world to manifest the fullness of the body that he could come down in divine love in the cool of the evening speak amongst his people like he wasn't the kind of eden adam adam we're down oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh my you maybe see that praise be to jesus saw the father god and the father the pillar of fire hanging over israel my god they could see the pillar fire hanging over them they knew that was god you can imagine how they walked under that pill of fire pillar fire by night the cloud by day they knew that was god that was god in the fatherhood promised to one day become flesh amongst them so the pillar of fire had to be expressed in five senses so the pillar of fire take on a robe of flesh called jesus walk among them i was a comforter them the word made flesh [Applause] and that word brought comfort to them praise god could imagine the confidence they had once the master was wrong praise god when they had to pay their taxes he said go and get a fish and no other fish no other fish could be picked up but the one with the coin in it all the fish is swimming trying to get to that bit but that one fish because jesus knew where that fish was and he here still jehovah jairus to take you may be seated they saw him raise the dead they saw him fed the multitudes praise god five lords and two fishes he was a comforter to them you could among those brothers their face full of joy and faith because messiah spoken with them praise god so one day jesus stood back he said now listen hallelujah i will not leave you comfortless i would send you another comforter praise god i know i'm a comforter but i will send you another comforter but this time the world cannot receive him oh hallelujah hallelujah boy dwell it with you and shall be in you so he was prophesying to them and given them seed of that promise that was going to be failed inside of them because the full purpose of god was to bring back deity again in flesh not to organize a bunch of church and church confusion and church argument and minister's association that wasn't the purpose of god the purpose of god was to come down and flesh hallelujah that was the purpose of god amen oh hallelujah you may be seated praise god and i missed the comforter he said it here you would have comforted those galileans how they believed them how they loved them and one day they seen him go to calvary to hear them say little while the world seek me no more the son of man must go to jerusalem and be put into the hands of sinful men crucified and dying how could they stand there their hearts were broken they were depressed they were all in gloom how could they ever give him up because the word that the prophet that spoke in the words that the sages and all the great holy men back there but when they look what the promise he made i will not leave you comfortless i will not leave you comfortless i will pray the father and he will send you another comforter which is the holy ghost and he will abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it knowing them not it see them not now neither does it know him but you know him you know him because he's with you and he shall be in you and there it is now as long as how long he's going to abide forever and then what is the word of god what is our comfort today it is when we receive the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god living living god in us that's with the word of the living god we stand the word is made fresh now the same word that was made flesh and dwelt among us has become our flesh he is with you now but he shall be in you therefore if we don't compromise that word and we stay right with it if we don't compromise it that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when it was made fresh because your flesh holds it [Applause] oh man hallelujah you mean your flesh hole in the living word itself that's right you maybe see that praise god oh blessed be the name of the lord my my the greek said sir we would see jesus praise god that's what the world want to see amen they want to see jesus isn't that right and jesus told them from unveiling of god but abraham said yeah he said the greeks couldn't see him because he was hit from them in a human being he said except a corner with falls on the ground god revealed in the form of a man hid himself from their view they could only see a man but those predestinated seen god one saw a man the other one saw god it was god veiled in a human being making both of them right but your faith in what you don't see you believe anyhow god failed in a human being now the old testament praise god god was hit by a veil in his mercy seat isn't that right the people would come in and worship they know god was there they couldn't see him that pillar fire didn't appear anymore that pillar fire went behind that veil isn't that right no he was veiled behind what behind skin a badger skin behind the veil or when that veil was rent on the day at the crucifixion the veil that it was wrapped up in was rent on the same day of the crucifixion the whole mercy seat came into view now the jews cannot understand how that god could have mercy upon us sinful for people like we are they couldn't see this one who was given mercy because he was hid he was behind the mercy seat on the inside the skins hanging down covering him he must always be veiled he must be veiled this morning oh hallelujah he must always be fail oh my listen to this before if any man walked in behind the veil it was sudden death oh hallelujah why because sin was covered and not remitted oh hallelujah praise god one time if a man walked through that veil it was sudden that now is no is dead not to go through it if you can't break the veil of tradition break through that wall of the denomination to see god in his power it is dead in other words you've got to break past every church member spirit every lukewarm every call every formal you gotta break past the minister's association break past the critics break pastor amen hallelujah to see god in his glory isn't that right oh praise god you may be seated thank you jesus oh hallelujah now on the day of pentecost the word came i was in the form of the son of god and they began to organize in a nicer room and the first thing it went to methodist baptist presbyterian it organized traditions a man don't know where he stands but glory to god he promised in the last days what he would do he would show his word in plain view open to us again now as revelation 10 is revealed the mysteries of god is made manifest known as a seven seal book promise now let your faith in him who is the word cause revelation 19 he comes he is called the word of god he said break the denominational veil of education break the national vein of tradition break those veils that is handling from you break those veils of pride hallelujah praise god no matter phd if it's contrary to the bible break through that veil for we have crossed the riven veil we are on the other side now on the other side praise god and you will see if you will just do that break those old traditions and things and come to him you will see him standing the mighty conqueror the word promised for this age oh hallelujah praise god as you heard last night he conquered everything praise god hallelujah the hebrew hebrews 11 those heroes of faith they were powerful they had great testimonies but we were waiting for that royal seed to have a showdown with death himself and when they hit that road and they hit that bell and they said get into the ring jesus was ready hallelujah praise god isn't that right hallelujah and when death stung jesus and he was going for that tongue hallelujah and satan was looking with all smiles to become champion after three days jesus punks back up he said i am the true conqueror and he punks him right out oh and he stands the mighty conqueror this morning oh hallelujah praise god amen oh my hallelujah glory you may be seated hallelujah so he told abraham unto his seed and i see that my given god forced the people to agree on what was already given past tense they were not even born here but he told him unto thee and thy seed have i given oh he told joshua from the river euphrates and so forth have i given he kept putting to them to what was already passed and jesus said when you pray believe you have received and you shall be sealed he said by his tribe you were healed he puts it on your to see if you would believe what he has already done hallelujah glory hallelujah you may be seated that's why you gotta ask job job i know you're going through a pressure but answer me tell me where i was down when i laid on foundation of the earth and the morning sat sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy he won the showed up he wanted to bring him onto that depression bring him under that frustration bring him out of that atmosphere and let him know he was up there rejoicing he was up there shouting and praising god hallelujah you may be seated glory so the word of god is already settled in the heavens the world is already stretched out so in every age you could go up and bring down the word a promise therefore john the baptist went up in his age and pulled on the voice of one crown of wilderness because isaiah spoke it isn't that right and that world was floating for a long time floating floating waiting for season and time to pick up with the right time body hallelujah so when i say i said voice of one crying a wilderness that word began to float oh hallelujah and one day john was walking in the wood pick up at him and everywhere he went that word was going through hallelujah because he was to be the voice of one crown in the wilderness oh you maybe see that oh my when he said a version shall conceive praise god that word was fruit and also hallelujah and that word was floated and mary coming from that will was that time body to connect with that floating word that prophecy that must be fulfilled in every age the prophecy must be fulfilled the word is already laid out god know

manifestation of the sons of god [Applause] hallelujah my hallelujah praise god you may be seated some merry kind of water from the well an angel appeared under her the world was no more floating when the angel appeared it was no longer floating the word was hanging over her isn't that right because she had to carry the prophecy of messiah praise god and there's a prophecy of a super church oh floating word there's a prophecy of a super race floating world there's a prophecy of a superbride floating world there's the prophecy of the sons of god floating world and that word must connect hallelujah you are going to be filled with the holy ghost floating word that prophecy going to connect you are going to be refilled you are going to be delivered that word is hanging over you jesus

that pillar of fire swept down that was no longer floating word he stepped out of the bible here comes elijah but that's only bad and here that elijah shall turn who shall turn the hearts of the children back to the feet of the fire you may be seen hallelujah you maybe see them no many just spoke to mary her senses could not declare messiah her body couldn't declare that there was a baby

brotherly love i have found my place in christ i have found my holy come and rejoice with me oh hallelujah i'm going to produce messiah i'm going to have a baby hallelujah i'm going to be adopted i'm

thought a shout might call him master to jump inside of jail praise god hallelujah oh hallelujah prayers be to jesus oh man you may be seated when god give abraham promise that by sarah you have a son sarah buddy couldn't sarah's body couldn't declare that promise the bible doesn't say it's here i believe god the bible said abraham believed god sarah's unbelief laughing couldn't stop it because god said by syria you're going to have that son isn't that right oh you may be seated elijah sent a servant seven times because his faith declared that there must be a sign so elijah couldn't take there is nothing he said there is nothing run again hallelujah and when he come down puffing he said there's nothing in it run again you run until you tell me you yes something [Music] because the season has changed there must be a sign you may be seated and i can imagine the sixth time he come there and he hoping that this is it now that is a go again go again yeah go again and this time when he come back he almost didn't want to confess it ah why see a sea a little cloud a sea i see a clown [Applause] my hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because i see a cloud like a man's head oh i see a cloud like a man's head oh hallelujah i know elijah's around because i know it's gonna rain it's gonna rain oh it's gonna rain oh hallelujah telling me what you see this morning i say i see a clown oh hallelujah hallelujah my jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh man you may be seated oh praise god my god so this is the mind age and the battle is the mind praise god and to me god wanted to prove that he could find a people that could stay with floating word until it comes to pass and we could target them with the reproach of the word the reproach of baroness praise god because you're on the promise of the holy ghost you're on the promise of charity the bride's absolute you're on the promise of the divine love where the brahmana himself had to wait for his message and when he was approaching if he cried out where is that right then malachi foreseed where's that seed to bring the message he was looking for all them seven seals and when it broke he had a revival praise god the people come there and mine didn't know what he was talking about but he knew what he was talking about because the angel spoke to him oh man so god was testing you may be seated to see if the people would stay with every floating promise seven the thunderstorms seven demons give the bride fate seventeen assured about how to be pair wait till them seven thunders after the voice of that group can handle the world praise god every bridal promise to see if we would stay with it oh my praise god and got an angel take the book and eat it and then you could prophesy and speak back the very promises of god but listen to this from the mystical supernatural orange orange boro he say it's the attitude of the people that brings the results and that's the reason at pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results you believe that let every man and woman in this building this morning boy a girl get everything from their minds but the lord jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you will see something happening that will cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning it's the atmosphere he said now so somebody said but abraham to prove it's the atmosphere you could take an egg and put it under a puppy and tie him down and it would hurt a chicken he said it's the warmth of the puppy's body that would hatch the egg it don't have to be under the hand it could be under the puppy it could be an incubator it's the atmosphere and it is the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and powers and powers of god among the people is the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place they're reasoning wandering stewing thinking talk don't even know where to stand half of them are not even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right oh we're going to say something you may be seated you say now you go over to the dance one one man standing there and saying well no we don't know whether he wants to dance or not and this girl over and the music is playing near my god today what are atmosphere for that well that's not any different than a lot of atmosphere you go into church for service and the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then for dance is to put on your old music that makes dances and everybody thinking about a good time and whooping and so forth put the right kind of music on the piano the organ and everybody in the atmosphere the jesus there are going to meet everything that they have need of something will go to taking place atmosphere listen to this and that's the hardest thing there is to do to get the people in that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing and the curses for that and that was the hardest thing to do to bring an atmosphere of expectation on a promise so it's fine to come and preach a nice sermon i may god bless his word amen that's fine but it's different to be striving to create an atmosphere of worship of praises of thanksgiving and this is what the brothers have been doing all these years because it is the atmosphere oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah glory you may be seated but if we could ever get a group of people together where there was genuine holy spirit atmosphere a sacredness a sincerity and worship and men and women sitting in there are god conscious and know that the great omnipotence of god is present ready to do all things without a shadow of a doubt it will even have an effect upon the unbelievers that is certain in this meeting evening you can never come into the atmosphere without something happening oh blessed be the name of the lord now from divine love phoenix he said now you have got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it and you know what gives faith right seven thousand feet to do what to create an atmosphere so wherever the true revelation of seventh house is preached it will bring faith to create an atmosphere you may be seated my hallelujah thank you for message of grace it takes a humble heart dedicated to god to bring jesus christ into present tense oh my not by might not my power but by my spirit he said now in my travels i found two classes of people fundamentalists and pentecostal the fundamentalists positionally knows where they stand but they haven't got much faith in it the pentecostal has got a lot of faith but they don't know who they are and where they stand it's like a man got money in the bank and he don't want to write a check the other man can write a check but even got no money man now if you could get them together you'd rarely have it so if you could get real good fundamental fate amongst pentecostal people or fundamental doctrine among pentecostal people i'd like to see a meeting what a meeting would be when the people realize listen are you ready when the people realize that you are not you will be you are present tense right now sons and daughters of god you are pushing it way off to the millennium somewhere all the blessing it's right now we won't need divine healing in the millennium no is when we have it we won't be sons of god but now you are sons of god and joint heirs with jesus christ and everything that jesus died for at calvary is your possession brother satan don't like that and if the people would only realize and just be willing to take god at his word my god it's unlimited you may be seated oh god you can never exhaust god's love and mercy to you you say well i hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered don't never think that you could ever ask too much of god i believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our joy will be full he wants you to act abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to a little mustard seed fate get out there to some other kind of faith move out in big things big things is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all so we can have a big revival brother oh hallelujah my god you may be seated my so when a man once catches that vision of the invisible god and knows that he is always present there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in time of distress and trouble it will still make him look upward and above the things that are happening around him because he's looking to the unseen now abraham did not only see the unseen and the reason he believed it was because god said it and if we being dead in christ by abraham's seed and if the spirit was in christ dwell in us it does the same thing it takes every divine promise of god that's in the bible and call it present tense and rest itself there no from will become flesh he said no you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of god that you see it before it happen and express it in word form that word takes a whole and becomes material it becomes a taught express if your heart and your mind is so in filled with god's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts then when your mind and your leader and your guiding becomes a direct place direct inspiration of the holy spirit that is moving your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very holy spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the holy spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being this god's spirit expressing itself to you what kind of church should we be what kind of people should it be this morning if this branham tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of god why you didn't even use your own mind [Applause] hallelujah glory to god amen until the sons of god are led by the spirit of god and then when the human element goes out and the spirit of god fills that vacancy we are talking about god-powered god anointed spirit-filled world-living spirit-led hallelujah thank you jesus for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god oh hallelujah in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and as many as receive him the word to them to them give he power to become the sons of god and the sons of god is attribute sons of his spirit that his sons like unto god the same life he had will be in the sons of god oh my you may be seated let's get on the home stretch here he said no you see what i mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material and that's when the church is in its power he said i believe it's on a road when the church will be so wrapped in christ my god the whole is that why the holy spirit sweep down like that last night praise god to give a taste to give a witness to give evidence of that new land praise god that's why god to take off the prophet 1965 because he knew we will make it we don't need bishop so-and-so hallelujah we don't need this man who walk with the prophet or talk with the people we don't need that we just need a promise and we have received the promise my i say unto you those voices are going to live hallelujah those seven voices will live there will come a living fate live in faith the courts that you'll be hearing second peter will not be in the bible it will come out and make flesh inside of you oh from your being going to flow fight you and knowledge and temper it going to flow out oh hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus you may be seated i believe it's on this road that when the church will be so wrapped in christ the holy spirit mankind saw away from themselves that they don't see themselves they taught is to serve god their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of christ then the love of christ in the human heart moving in the holy ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the holy spirit bringing to past the thought of their mind oh my god hallelujah praise god my do you see what i'm saying jesus walk up to our man and say will thou be made whole he asks the man the question but peter walk up to a man and said silvan go i don't have such as i have i give southern war the thought was in peter's mind for him to be healed hallelujah and he could say stand up and walk and the power was in the word in other words peter had the check already signed he just healed and handed to the man hallelujah glory to god oh hallelujah oh man thank you jesus you may be seated oh hallelujah praise god he said the biggest fault that i could find with any of the churches especially the real church of the born again they don't know who they are you don't realize what the privilege that god has given you you are looking for something way off in the millennium but that's one of the devil has pulled over you no we are the sons of god not we will be we are now every redemptive blessing that the lord jesus died for is our personal property right now oh hallelujah every redemptive blessing is all personal property and he conquered everything hallelujah he conquered every gate hallelujah he conquered sickness he conquered devils he conquered diseases he conquered the grave he conquered hell itself he is the mighty conqueror this morning glory you may be seated praise god nothing must do half of them in the early church when peter was in jail the sisters caused a prayer meeting praise god and they shook heaven's door and god pressed his buttons hallelujah and that jail laws had to fly open like automatic praise god peter get up from there and peter said walk a speeder walk this thoughts that open up hallelujah that's what we are talking about sons of god praise god storm in the kingdom hallelujah hallelujah the kingdom belonged to us oh hallelujah you maybe see that christ was the fullness of god he was the anointed jehovah he was their jehovah anointed body jesus of nazareth god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and he died that he might sanctify this fallen human race and bring them back the sons of god to be anointed ones anointed by the holy spirit to go forth and reflect his kingdom hallelujah oh man praise god you may be seated as an eagle still to the rest he said papa eagle they look like him they believe the same thing now watch god wants a genuine messiah he is messiah messiah's anointed one and we are his children which have a lesser anointing as jehovah eagle is great eagle we are eaglets he is messiah and we with the same anointing our messiah and lord and messiah means anointed one with the same spirit that he was anointed with we have it in measure he had it without measure he was scorned manifested in flesh and we are sons of god we are part of him the very works that i do shall you do also oh hallelujah thank you jesus they should have known the disciples that he was messiah and the word masami's anointed one god was in him he said no i do nothing in myself or what i see the father do it the father devoted me or if he was messiah by that but that anointed made him fully messiah with the same spirit upon him not we with the same spirit that was upon him not in portion but the same quality with a portion upon us would make us messiahs would be little sons of god adopted sons of god and his holy spirit would seal us into his body and we are his children there's nothing bother us nothing warriors we are hills everything well we are false accuser but we are testifying of something that's not even so i believe i believe now we are the sons of god not we will be now right now we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus we don't have any power but we have authority oh hallelujah glory hallelujah oh my god hallelujah praise god praise god praise this wonderful name hallelujah hallelujah we don't have power we have authority but we have promised power hallelujah now we are the sons of god oh hallelujah hallelujah give him praise oh my hallelujah i'm closing he said i believe that the church of the living god is moving to a sphere now that's going to shape the whole world that's the first time it's been since the days of jesus nazareth a human being ask anything yet you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of jesus christ being fulfilled it's going to come to pass pretty soon i'm looking for it to happen in this meeting i am wanting it to happen now that the anointing oh my god what strike the whole church of the living god she will rise to her feet like a mighty machine army the sick will be healed by a world the blind will see the death will hear the dead will be raised up and the power of god will shape the world with the church of the living god oh we are in the process of it right now and i believe we are in the process of it right now may the lord bless you [Applause] oh let's give him a praise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
