from verse 11 Deuteronomy chapter 11 and um you'll take a seat after that a new China Deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 11 but the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drink at work and drink at water of the rain of heaven and land which the LORD thy God cared for the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year and I shall come to pass if he shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and serve Him in all your heart with all your soul that I will give you the rain of your land in this new season the first rain and the latter rain that down me is gathering like corn and then wine and nine oil may God bless this world you may be seated praise the Lord give the Lord a shout I'm not going to appreciate this morning but I said want appreciate I appreciate him you're gonna bless you this morning so we're gonna I wanna share a few things I'll give you updates and let miss me some chili but the other scripture to read not to finance up to you but that's a Jewish after 2:23 it says be glad then eternal design and rejoice it means shout first be glad first praise God first us see nothing yet nothing a move but a shout generally a praising you're worshiping the devil will take you getting on back because you see things things that normal things everything this problem and that bill but you still worshipping you still praising God regardless and that is a sign of faith and I feel faith here this morning I mean if faith is here anything can happen go glory to God because it brings the shouts Abraham staggered not at the promise of God chew on the leaves what was strong in faith giving glory to God so when faith strike a soul praises after kimochi ha let me sit when they strike your soul rejoicing and worshiping has to come out your heart oh I believe she said he said be glad you journals and rejoice in the Lord of God for he had given you the former in moderately and he will pause to calm down for you to rain the latter in the former and latter in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts are eaten all what you lost out all what your missile or whatever of your hijack your kidnap your sit down your all of that I'm going to restore unto you all all that all [Music] all what your loss coming back because I'm lucky help because I'm back black here to all your great praise one that always got me story about a young man I give you let me see the priest or Brazil or amen telling in Chile that when the portal of tran closes with back to eternity when I porn in times of sickness only at time I agree here and all age and disease and backache and all these pressure on another do this and do that orient I'm but when that portal of time closes and recruits back up to eternity what way are we gonna be asked or being different altogether so that is why John say all in heaven all under the hood good I praise God and he said we shall reign on the earth amen and then when I said he shall eaten plenty and be satisfied why why because his promise in the Bible of prophecies there'll be famine in the last days not four Bibles not for books and tips not first book or books not for preachers no no lots of them tons of them but for the hearing of the true Word of God go glory to God that gospel that is to be preached in power yeah whoa hollow that gonna be a rare thing because people gonna fall at the intellectual level just to be educated and informed but you are not like that you are people called to a land you are called to a land I promised land a land of the Holy Ghost you wanna put your foot on that land you're gonna work on that land in that land you cannot be defeated the devil cannot come and just do anything on that land is your land even the process head or glory to God hallelujah glory of God you may be seated Anisha even plants can be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God not said that praise the name of the Lord your God and my people shall never be ashamed you are shame no but it's a prophecy my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and hear the promise are you ready and it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit Lord Ashok this is a praise God hallelujah sir pray for me we have Easter meetings but Tuesday off the Ivory Coast for meetings in Cote d'Ivoire so just update and okay I'll check on the pass I pour my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men see in visions Oh glory to God a man so the meters in Chile I do have the words to describe the operation of the Holy Spirit in those meetings and Talca Chile I know some of you had a link to see it are we gonna put it up so you all get to see it the Lord led by the fury from New York and but a Gabriel from Canada to go down there and also but a Conte from Sierra Leone myself you were there and but a fury with his condition since the physical condition he would not have vented the traveler so far if the Lord didn't tell him to go but the Lord let him and we had some priceless fellowship with his brethren who left Chile revived and renewed the Holy Spirit pour out on the people and the people receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there are those who were healed I'm Noddy and Jimmy was chilly again the way we know Chile was worship it come right back to that it was a tremendous victory not a kingdom of God so they are looking forward for meetings next year no sir they're bridging from Argentina or the places and looking forward so God is working God is moving we just feel great to be in the will of God and you know what about him say once you on the fields you are in the will of God my mind you do after high school missions should I go on the fields once you're in the fields because why Jesus said somebody said Jesus in GSA go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature breaches are the bullet breaches of the bees Amen preacher every creature isn't that right so this morning before I succumb I didn't have a title for this tortellini the land you go to possess not to talk about somebody give you a description of the property around finally for you it is located so much mine's north and south and the border the boundaries digest the people we never see it yet you say one day I'll go and check it out I won't go and check it out you say but this is Allah from way again from here today on your walk in when you're walking in lanit have mango trees it have grapefruit trees have or injuries of victories that is your land you mean my grandfather left all this to me I know you start to walk and every place you put your foot you know that is the grandfather and that he left there for you praise God have a mountain I guess they're gonna move it hallelujah for a couple of high trees are gonna cut it down they're gonna build this year one bull

here you feel to put a hose and water the whole line like that that is your life that is your life well when court Jesus died he died to bring your land for you this a land of promise is a land of the Holy Ghost you could possess that don't let the devil tell you forget joy don't let the devil tell you can get peace but let the devil tell you carry deliverance but let the devil tell you you cannot get the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't let the devil tell you that your soul turn back on fire then I recall now but it wasn't born all he was even born here before there was a moon before there was a star before there was a molecule he will be back in God's thinking he was on fire because Cora sure where was down when I lit up some disability and the bonus has sang together and the sons of God the sons of God shouted for joy you are soaking over amen you may be seated oh praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah glory to God so I wanna challenge the son a shot no don't wait till I get the bridge to get them so no shoulder bridge you coming show a healin coming shouting deliverance coming shout your ninety days come and shop now be not crazy we are not crazy this is principles of the spirit the worship God says you can confess hallelujah shots less you walk longer Georgia Jericho first [Applause] [Music] confuse the devil and get that from off your face confuse the devil and put on a smile confuse the devil and give God a praise yes you have this issue and that's true I'm not denying that but that is not about diesel about you there's about him he is caught he deserves to be worship this is not about you know depression you [Music] there's not sure you get in salary this month yeah that's you on your salary that'll were you and your God be bread almost finished and they don't weigh again this bread from that's you on your bread when you were gone if your prints got a bread back come to you if you're breakin is somebody money might come to you if you're free this car Oh glory hallelujah listen you're worshiping on Tinian we went to some places they tough stuff you think worship easy you take inspiration and revelation for pretty early worship going on people don't normally stick the hands upon Iran stand up fella somebody said this church is an exercise in church the only concern offenses in lung cancer the passage and down yeah yeah what is it we can keep quiet please hallelujah when Jesus was coming down that day those ecipher just couldn't keep quiet they start to put palm branches you know right [Applause] Peter silver none cost it on speaker sells on any like rice later on but this is not that time this is Hosanna time this is shorted this is prison good time this is rejoicing 10 because the king is coming the promises comin your deliverance that's coming to your hearing that's coming to after 40 plus years it could just be wood wood wood wood wood wood wood it has to come to worship you have to turn the spirit you have to come to that shoot my anointing to know what and how ok let me see the guitar up here the preaches in the house or the preacher is in the house as I signed to get out the preacher says nothing's even focus okay let's go if you have met every requirement all aback a little bit in the crucial hour no doubt she checked up she said Lord I've done what I know how to do when you have done everything that you know how to do and met every requirement that God has required that is where he takes a home that is where faith comes in if you have met every choir man that God require you to do then sometimes God tests your feet to see what kind of reaction you have on an action oh he's good at that he just lets proves whether we really believe what you think you believe you know he does that many times so by accepting it only it won't only do really just by accepting it won't only do God has got to vindicate back that he has accepted you that's the thing you can accept him but then when he accepts you stay right there until he accepts you [Applause] they believe the word that's good you receive the word that's good but stadium because this is my son and pleased to dwell in except you and when he does here we go I already he seals you into his kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit that is when God except you that i shaken with the pastor of the church that's when God accept you he seals you into the kingdom put his mark upon you not a church mark this man his seal and you are sealed until the day of your redemption the delicate touch it and we can't break it it is the seal of God or give the Lord a shout Oh hallelujah Amen so stay there until he accepts you and when he does he sees you into the kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and if you say you believe him and never received the Holy Ghost yet then God hasn't recognized your feet but God gave Abraham a sign of recognition of his fate by circumcision and it gives you a sign of recognition of your confessed faith in him when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost to seal it as a finished work isn't that right and he said this on future home he said watch the earth was baptized and it is on or underwater it was sanctified by the blood of Jesus dripping on it and a new earth to come is to have holy fire the cleaner of every devil every germ every sickness everything that it is and make a new heaven newer and then he said you and the same way God redeemed the earth he redeems the individual you become a new person not just an old patched up one by joining church and telling a new page but you are complete brand new unit God takes the old man and brings them out completely out [Applause] with what fire not mysteries fire not teaching onward fire what does the church need fire get the load of praise God takes the old man Elizabeth completely out with Hulagu boost and fire and comes himself and sends down your representation fall as Jean taught me I'm God God sends down that representation by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so whenever God sent a gift to the earth anyone who rejects it it becomes it becomes cast in a generation they never prosper they end up in judgment under the nation's as we know as Bible readers that in reason Solomon was a golden age for Israel why because all the people had one Accord rallying around that great gift that Solomon had from God I wonder what would take place tonight if all the churches in United States would rally around the gift that God has given us that is the Holy Ghost [Music] some people wish it was some mañana they all want to put some manatee picture but the gift that God gave us the Holy Ghost God's gift what if all the churches would break down their barriers and would rally or wrong the great gift of godly Bradley love and the baptism of the Holy Spirit it may be the greatest defense this Nisshin could have it will be better than all these scientists atomic bombs and so forth that we could invent oh praise the name of the Lord almost done he said this is our age 11th hour world war stopped on the eleventh month of the year the eleventh day of the month the eleventh hour of the day dilemma not an hour and the eleventh hour people might come in and receive what the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why the quality let me turn your Gentile workers what is it the walls are struggling struggling here struggling they're struggling what for the atomic bombs and everything else are being built up but they can't do it they can't do it until the joules get a visitation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost hold it till we seal the servants and their foreheads and before they are sealed there's a bride to be sealed but the angel from the east having the baptism of the Holy Ghost final coat and I'm done from the seat of God Berta BAM oh why can't this Branum table to come out of all wrinkled I want to know a few people wrong and believe this gospel is being preached you have seen it you signs and wonders and confirm everything the Lord has spook has come to pass then what's the matter here when I hear there's contentions among you when I hear there is strife I want you to write out what's the matter from the depths of your heart and late on this platform pulpit tomorrow night I want to see listen why this church can't be carried away with the power of God and the baptismal holy goes with signs and wonders what's the matter your pastor believes it you believe it so what you're on here there's something wrong this should be a lighthouse of the world this should be a place where the part of God weeping and crying and seeking God or to be dear night why can't we have it I said we want it why can't we have it god bless you as asked but I wanted me to sing a song that the preacher will come and minister to the world tonight god bless you prisoner hallelujah appreciate or pastor this morning poor repeater gone hallelujah amen amen turn on creature brother reaches sister hallelujah hallelujah

the word feel promising [Applause] he loved normal people uh Phoebe to victory Sam here we give the Lord a hand the phrase is warning many many men are you happy to be in the house of the Lord you appreciate the pastor this morning your pre-shipping Anthony for the worship and the service last week amen can we borrow heads for word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for your grace for your love for your mercy Lord and Lord for calling us in such a time as this father we pray that your Holy Ghost would drop down in a special way today and Lord and this day when we remember when you rode into Jerusalem log R we are so grateful father we are so thankful we appreciate you so much father and Lord we pray that the Holy Ghost would drop down in a real way that your people can experience true worship by a revelation father load me you speak to us from the pages of this scripture Lord and love me you open our understanding to your word that we could be better Christians better Lord better men better women better sons better daughters me you bless the reading of the word and the opening of our understanding if there's anyone sick in our midst this morning me you heal them this morning if there's a backslider in our midst me you deliver them may you restore them if there's anyone looking for the Holy Ghost just morning me you fill them with the Holy Ghost and fire lo we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so if you have your Bibles I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles would you turn in me to two portions of Scripture this morning reading from Isaiah 21 and reading from Ezekiel 33 Isaiah 21 and reading verse 11 the burden of Douma he called to me out of Sarah watchman what of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said the morning commit and also the night if you will inquire inquire ye return come and read in Ezekiel 33 and reading from verse 1 Ezekiel 33 and reading from verse 1 again the word of the Lord came unto me seeing son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land notice he said when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for the watchmen if when he see the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever hear it the sound of the trumpet and take it not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own hand he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and he any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand so thou son of man I have said thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me when I say unto the wicked a wicked man thou shalt surely die if dough does not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou has delivered thy soul therefore all those son of man speak unto the house of Israel thus he speaks seeing if our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we pine away in them how should we then live say unto them as I live saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn attorney from your evil ways for why will he die o house of Israel may the Lord and a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated everybody feeling fine so before I touch the text because it's a pretty serious text and I told Burt over it it's a it's interesting title that I have this morning but I feel persuaded that the season has changed and a cry as going out Watchmen Watchmen what of the night and with the Branham when he was speaking on this subject she was crying out to the church speaking of what was to come and on this day and on this week that's Holy Week we could vividly look back through the word of this day when Jesus interrupted Jerusalem in a way that it had never happened before and just a yes P the picture of a background that Jerusalem by definition means a city of peace but for years there was no peace from leadership to leadership from government to civilization the Jews have been run by the Romans and it was military oppression there was religious oppression there was persecution and there was no peace in the natural nor was there peace in the spiritual the Pharisees the scribes and the Sadducees and those who were entrusted with the responsibility to lead a churn of Israel so their spiritual destination had abandoned their jobs it had become commonplace they had become used to it they had become relaxed they have taken it for granted so when Jesus came he came and started to break up the system break up what was the expected norm he broke up the tradition he broke up the expectation he was disturbed by the way they took the word for granted he was disturbed by how casual they were he was disturbed by their lack of faith and in so much that when the Centurion came to him and asked for his servant to be healed Jesus could have said I'm not even seen fit like this in all of Israel because the cheran of Israel had lost their way as it was but when Jesus came he came to restore his order not an older order but he came to restore his order so there was a revolution that was taking place in Jerusalem but this revolution where the night was a quiet revolution because Jesus was not advertising himself he was not trying to build a reputation for himself the Bible says that Jesus in Matthew 12 he didn't cry nor strive nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets he wasn't screaming on the corner he wasn't trying to get everybody's attention in matthew 16 he charged his disciples to tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ in sin mark 5 after he raised gyruss daughter he told those who witness it that they should tell no man what had happened so Jesus was running an underground movement he was not looking for everybody he was looking for special people he was looking for a Peter somewhere he was looking for an Andrew somewhere he was looking for uh Nathaniel somewhere and he was bringing enough of a fan of an experience that he could be fully persuaded that this was the truth he was bringing two individuals a personal experience that they couldn't hear from somebody else but his sword for themselves that this was different that this was exceptional that this was Word made flesh up that this was scripture being fulfilled that this was a man like no other manner you don't hear me this morning when Jesus came down from Mount Transfiguration he told his disciples that this should tell no man what things they had seen him till the Son of Man was risen from the dead so those men will close into secrecy you don't hear me this morning in John 6 after Jesus fed the 5,000 the Bible said when Jesus perceived from what he had done that the multitude will come and take him to make him her King Jesus departed himself into the mountain alone he took kept away from the crowd he said my always not yet come I am a king but my or is not yet come I will be in charge but my hour is not yet come and no you want me to leave but my hour is not yet come but on this day over two thousand years ago we celebrate Jesus riding into Jerusalem Jesus broke the silence of his ministry Jesus no longer told the people keep it quiet people Jesus no longer swore them to secrecy Jesus no longer acts em to keep it a secret he wanted everybody to know who he was he wanted everybody to know what he had done he wanted everybody to know about his ministry hallelujah whoo you may be seated just laying a background for a message this morning so Jesus is making his public entry and many of us we live in secrets we live secret lives nobody knows our testimony nobody knows that we're a Christian nobody knows what the Bible says every knee has got to bow and every tongue will have to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and one of these days what's hidden will have to come out and your secret testimony must become a public testimony because God must be able to see there is my spirit up through in freely there has to be a time in your life when it's unveiled who you really are it's no longer secret it's no longer mystery it's no longer hiding in church but it's God Himself living something out somebody say man hallelujah I'm gonna strike my text similar one but just so we understand it was no longer secret because Jesus had just left Bethany we've said this before and in Bethany is where Jesus had an experience he didn't want to go there because the last time he was there he ran into some problems with the brothers but over the end Bethany is where Lazarus lived and when Lazarus was sick Jesus was weary to go there because the brothers over they had problems with his teaching and his ministry but when Lazarus died Jesus decided to go and the situation was death all around the focus had shifted from him coming to Lazarus is weak Lazarus is funeral the preparation them your arrangements for Lazarus when Jesus lifted nobody really paid Jesus any mind but when Jesus got there he asked the question where have you laid him and I could imagine people thought maybe Jesus just came to pay his respects maybe he just came to see a last look at maybe we Lazarus was resting but when Jesus came near you roll away the stone because you wanted to get access to the problem you wanted to get access to the situation he wanted to get access to what was not looking good was that smelling good was not behaving good and when he stood there and the stone was rolled away he said Lazarus come forth that was not man that was more than man jesus wept just before that but when Lazarus started coming out they realize that this was just too much they couldn't keep it secret anymore because resurrection power had made itself visible among them visible between them and I believe this morning resurrection power resurrection power power to raise you up power to get you to worship power to heal you power to set you free resurrection power in this Easter season but the Branham said there will be an Easter for the bride all these years to see that whether the ground from the Alpha Church has been pressing its way to the church ages up to a full restoration in the Omega bride of what they had in the Alpha Church up here will be an ISA for this bride and the devil is in trouble the devil is in trouble because there's nothing he can do about it the devil is in trouble because he tried before and he filled with Jesus and Jesus said the same words I do you are gonna do all so he said you are me we're gonna be one and intact here you wanna know that I am the father you and me and I in you if the devil couldn't stop Jesus up how could the devil stop you if the devil could not defeat Jesus up how could the devil defeat you you come from God you are going back to God your genetic structure is his genetic structure your genetic code is his genetic code hallelujah Oprah Liza I don't know when it's gonna happen but it's gonna happen one of these days I'm gonna be gone one of these days I'm leaving this world one of these days I'm getting out of here what day I don't know what is gonna be but we know it's gonna happen we believe it's gonna happen we receive is gonna happen hallelujah you may be seated just like Jesus can I type you this morning just like Jesus from the moment he was born he was on a journey he was not in control over where he went he was not in control of the house he grew up in them he was not in control he was walking on her journey that had been cut out for him hallelujah he was a man born with a mission he was a man on a mission and you will hear this morning you are born with a mission and you are on a mission when Jesus walked on water that was yes on the mission but that was not the mission he was on a journey he walked on water that was part of the journey He shed fed 5,000 that was part of the journey he went to gyruss house that was part of the journey he met a woman at the well that was part of the journey but he was heading somewhere he was going somewhere The Devil's trying to figure it out the devil doesn't know what's gonna happen because of the devil knew was gonna happen he was gonna stop it but God hid it gonna hit it from the devil if the devil knew that the shedding of Jesus blood was gonna cause such a big problem for his kingdom he would have given Jesus security he would have given Jesus an ambulance every he went to make sure Jesus doesn't fall down Jesus doesn't get a cut Jesus but the devil doesn't know the plans he doesn't know the solution he doesn't know what God has already written in blood that made sure there was nothing gonna stop Jesus from making it to Calvary there was nothing stopping Jesus from walking up that hill there was nothing you may be seated what's gonna stop you what's gonna stop you you may be seated [Applause] even when Jesus mother nights was going up to Calvary and he couldn't carry it across anymore God had somebody in position to carry it across with him but the mission had to be finished there was no failure to be accepted in this mission this mission had to be successful and the mission that God has written about your life has got to be successful every trial you have walked into that's part of the journey that's not the mission you picked up a house you picked up a job that's not the mission that's on the journey what you're heading to the mission don't let that stop on the journey change your focus from the mission you've got to get to the mission you have got to get to the Holy Ghost you have got to get to adoption you have got to get to perfection you have got to get to the rapture you've got to get to Calvary you've got hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah and when Jesus arrived they worshiped him because he did what nobody else had done they worshiped him because they saw something and when you come to God and come to the world and come to the message it must be that you see something it must be that something triggers in your soul that takes you beyond your human relationships take you beyond your familial relationships take you beyond your family and your friend that if you are standing alone you would still stand because it's your experience it's your testimony it's not based on anybody else but it's based on your experience with God it's not this video experience with the church it's based on your experience with God if you experience it's based on the church you will feel if you experience his peace and reading a quote that will fail but if you experience his peace on an encounter with God there's no man ever met a pillar of fire and left the same way nobody ever met a pillar of fire and left the same way something happen on the inside and when God operates on you you cannot reverse the effects of his operation you cannot undo what God has done and God has elected you nobody could undo your mistakes cannot undo what God has already done there's no power strong enough to undo when God said I predestinated you there's no power there's no depression there's no situation guess no child yes no testin yes no opposition there's no confusion there's no mind battle somebody give got a soda praise you know what's happening the devil just hit the panic button the devil just hit the panic button because the brother branham said the moment the bride gets to know who she is then the rapture is gonna go the moment the bride gets to know who she is she's a mighty marching army she's an invincible marching army you may be seated if that be the case the most important thing this morning is for you to know who you are I'll see them again if that be the case then the most important revelation you can get is who you are because who you are is what gives you the key to have access if you don't know who you are then you operate a certain way but if you know who you are then you know what belongs to you you understand the rights that are yours it's something else when you see a boss's son operate in a store or you see a prince of a country operate because they understand who they are they understand the authority that they have and the devil's job is to tell you or nobody you're not gonna make it you didn't see a mistake you didn't remember what happened you don't see what he said about you you don't remember what you did and that's his job and he has his job to do we're not trying to deny him doing his job but we ever talked to do this morning to remind ourselves to encourage ourselves I come from God I'm going back to God so he's slimmy yet still I trust him yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death that was David encouraging himself I will fear no evil Oh toward thousand falling my right go ten thousand falling my left I shall not be moved [Music] hallelujah he may be seated Oh just to bring this to closure so when the people will worship Him because they were recognizing that they were in the presence of deity the Pharisee that the audacity to see that you are worshiping too much you are too excited there's too much expectation that's not how we normally worship there's just too much noise and the cry of honor is really a cry for help that cry of Hosanna is a word of praise that really means help so the children of rain Israel I realize that user realized that help was actually in their midst and [Applause] when they would actually went to Jesus that Jesus can you tell the people to calm down can you tell the people to lower the expectation can you tell the people that they cannot be delivered right now and Jesus responded say I can't stop them because if I tell them to hold their peace then the rocks the rocks are going to cry out nature is going to cry out in fact the whole of creation is crying out the whole of nature is revealing for the manifestation of the sons of God [Applause] hallelujah he may be seated and the disciples didn't even understand what was really taking place they didn't really understand what was going on but they was still worshiping and I say this morning friends that that same Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit as where the random type is here to drive us all to our Calvary and then to the rapture I want to say a few things before I strike my text and but the ranima and the message the world is again falling apart he said I look for a rapture for just a handful of people that's right just a handful of people now this is very powerful but the random said next they'll never be missed in the world when they go you'll never know it's gone that's right it will come like a thief in the night but the random goal so when he said if you don't cut the work short for the elected sake if you don't got it short for their sake no flesh would be saved so where we at brother branham cries out we see nations breaking and Israel weakening the sign that is Bible for toll for this day we see the mechanical things taking place now the spirit the dynamics of that promise word to get into the church and drive them into Calvary on unto the rapture there we are and Calvary represents for us that death death to our feelings that our desires depth of our personal expectations our personal experiences our personal feelings about things on the cross is where you are mocked you will laugh that you are scoffed at you reviled and like Jesus your response must be Father forgive them for they know not what they're doing it's a journey that we all must take but it takes a power to drive us to Calvary we cannot do it in our own strength because even Jesus looking at Calvary in prayer acts were it not to happen and if Jesus who had the power at that moment in the Garden of Gethsemane with crowd Issei Lord if it is possible let this cup pass that Calvary experience was not an appealing thing it is not appealing for you to give up of yourself and to deny yourself that's what I spoke one in Diggle Martin on Tuesday if any man wants to follow me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me that denying of yourself means giving up the stuff that you want to do like to do things you should do because there's something more important at stake your soul is at stake and we read a scripture were warning this morning and I'm at a watchman and God is speaking and he's telling Ezekiel Ezekiel when i bring the sword of judgment it's your place to appoint a watchman and that watchman's job is to look for the uncommon threads and when the trap is seen his job is to warn the people to blow the trumpet but if the trumpet is blown and the people do not secure themselves Tenace on their heads but at the warning or the threat comes and a watchman does nothing about it even though the people are affected by it their blood is under watchman's and so I said in Daegu Martin on Tuesday night said peak preaching is a very dangerous thing it's very dangerous because if what is said from the pulpit is wrong God will hold the speaker accountable it's a dangerous thing for the preacher it's also a dangerous thing for the people because when the word goes forth in truth and he didn't act upon the word then it's on your head it's now your responsibility so can I just speak about the Watchmen a little bit so for a title this morning not on my watch and my prayer my desire is that for this week that will be your personal statement not on my watch in the natural you'll co-principal go in front of a school and tell the schoolchildren you see what's going on between these glasses not on my watch action will be taken to prevent whatever you guys are trying to do because the principal is the watchman the leader of a company is the watchman of the company and yes I take the necessary action when he is on his watch whatever happens on his watch is his responsibility because he is charged to see what others cannot see if you are head of your house you are the watchman of your house you have to accept responsibility for what takes place in your house if you are a watchman of your house [Applause] now in the world of business they always say the problem is never the people it's always the leadership and within the spiritual realm it's never the sheep it's always the shepherds because the sheep are meant to be led and from a spiritual perspective whatever warning needs to go out needs to go out to you as individuals to me as individuals so we can take action based on the warning can the church say man we live in a day of satellites and read on motion sensors and metal detectors and scanners and cameras and all of these technologies exist in part to replace the role that the watchmen had years ago years ago when you built a city or a town or a village there would be a watch tower we don't have it really anymore but in that watch tower somebody would go up in the watch tower and his job would be to look for the threats to look at the time that's why the Bible said Watchmen Watchmen one of the Knights I mean the Branham said that people would come out at night if they couldn't sleep and they would act so watch but Watchmen one of the Knights and the watchman will respond to you could you imagine coming out Watchmen watch for one of the Knights and you get no response because the watchman is sleeping I remember some time ago I drove past the security booth and and looked for the security he was out cold sleeping but the technology that we have today to detect to monitor and to track it's achieved as a threat coming to see if reinforcements are coming to see if the people who went up against food are coming back so when the watchman said the food is coming that people get excited because he is higher than they are he could see what they cannot see can the church Shaymin you cannot respond to an attack unless you know any attack is coming from so the watchman's job was to scream down there coming over that hill over there send someone men on that side there over on that side sentiment over there because a watchman in the watchtower was looking out and what's happening can the church say man I mean this place is here with a banner and a message watchman or than a knight he said and the duties of a watchman and the old Bible was a man that was selected he must be a man that's alert of the heavenly bodies he must know just exactly where the stars are hanging to tell the perfect time to the people many of the weary will go out maybe and couldn't sleep restless and would scream up at the watchman in the tower and would scream out these words watchman one of the night and he would look at the Stars and then would say it's such-and-such a time then they would go back to their bed or wherever they choose to dwell waiting for the daylight to come when the tired weary restless night will be over God have mercy I wonder if it is sometime today that we didn't call it to our great watchman one of the night and brother branham type the great watchman of the Holy Ghost that is an approaching danger coming on and the whole world seems to be shaken under its influence the watchman also had to be on duty all times there's no off duty you have to be alert all time that was his duty to watch for the approaching danger and he was up in a tower it was built much higher than the walls and this tower he had up there in it the books of astronomy and so forth watch the stars and tell the time any approaching thing of time of day he could tell it he could also see we're further than anyone on the ground he could see further than anyone in the wall because he was up higher and the higher you go the further you can see you could tell approaching dangers and so forth and I say in his day was speaking that call had made him a watchman I'm quite liking his prophets like unto Eagles they are a watchman that climb higher so they can see further off and the eyes were made spiritual so they could see the approaching dangers and God had said Isaiah to warn the people that he was approaching dangers but they wouldn't listen to him and in our day God sent a watchman like no other watchman a twentieth century prophet who was pulled up to a high tower and he was given spiritual eyes and those spiritual eyes so many things those spiritual eyes so far off those spiritual eyes saw a bride coming into power those spiritual eyes what is able to see a bride coming to perfection those spiritual eyes was able to see a super church a super race those spiritual eyes were able to see a power not just in distance but far off in time those spiritual eyes in that Watchtower was able to look into the past was able to look into the present was able to look into the now he was caught up in the high tower of the eternal realm of God he was able to see the enemy coming in he was able to warn the Church of the two spirits working in the framework of the church he was able to warn the people can the church say Amen everybody with me this morning so that watchman he was always a lit from the moment but the Branham took his place as watchman in the tower every year he stood his ground and message after message in those messages were notes of warning were notes of prophecy with notes of encouragement he would say things like sir is this the time he was shouting from the watchtower get ready get ready get ready there's a rapture coming he shouted from the watchtower I see a church called I see a church walking and step come on now come on now come on now oh are you with me this morning are you with me this morning and our watchman will get back to touch we'll get back to that in a few minutes but let's go back in the Old Testament David was a watchman so when David is looking over the Sheep he was alert and the Shepherd's in those days that's why Jesus could say I am the door because when the Sheep fool was done the entrance was left open and the Shapley and from the entrance as the door so that while he's even taking a rest if the Sheep tried to cross over him it'll wake him up but demon was alert he was a watchman in his tower so that when the beer team he saw the beer and as the watchman he took action against the beer and because he was a watchman he saw when the lion came and when the beer came is in not on my watch I'm not gonna let any beer touch the Sheep while I'm the watchman or you know hear me this morning when the lion came David was the watchman and in his heart of hearts he said not under my watch maybe if somebody else was here he might act differently but right now while I have the ability to do something about the problem while I've been given the responsibility to watch over these sheep not on my watch hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah it became personal and they're gonna find in the scripture that we are all Watchmen oh you thought I just took them in the ministry and the prophets no we are all Watchmen you're not getting away that easily you have your own watching to do we all have our own watching to do we all have an opportunity while we are on our watch to take action about the situations that come into our lives that we can respond not on my watch while I'm going to work and that temptation comes my way not on my watch I'm not falling for it I'm not falling for that music while I'm on my watch I'm not listening to that style I'm not gonna dress that way because I'm on my watch I'm on duty so I cannot go to this place because I'm on my watch can you go to me to the party nothing my words I can't go because I'm on watch I'm gonna watch for my soul I'm gonna watch for my house I'm gonna watch for revival I'm gonna watch for deliverance I'm on watch for healing and because I'm on my watch somebody help me hallelujah you may be seated so your children that are in trouble you have got to tell yourself nothing my watch I'm not gonna let them stay out of church and not do something about it not on my watch oh you don't hear me this morning your children were given to your responsibility and you oughta watch for them you ought to pray for them you ought to look for the word where is it that where's the reinforcements out where's the attack at not on my watch as for me and my house we will serve the Lord children of Israel house of God don't you know your marriage is under attack your family is under attack are you gonna watch and not blow the trumpet or are you gonna declare from today and not on my watch I'm not gonna let no demon come into my house not on my watch I'm I'm not gonna let nobody mess up my worship not on my watch I'm not you see if you don't take ownership for your watch you'll always blame the other person let me see it again if you don't take ownership for your watch then you could always say it's somebody else's fault but when it's your watch you've got to be a litt you've got to be full time you can watch now and not watch tomorrow you got to be watching all the time let me jump ahead a little bit we in Holy Week Jesus goes at cemani and he's tired he's weary in fact he tells this to them when Jesus comes back he went back to his own disciples and he asks a question couldn't you watch with me for one hour I wanted to sink in your soul friends this is real it's easy to blame people it's easy it's his fault that goes way back to Genesis Adam what happened it was the woman you give me Eve what happened it wasn't me it was a serpent it's easy to pass the responsibility and that's why my heart I felt compelled this morning to warn the young people today to warn the church today because if the warning goes out today then I free my soul and I could say because I'm on watch this morning I want to watch right now Lord not on my watch may the reality of the truth sink into your soul that you realize that judgment is coming once man watch spin one of the night the morning come but at night also Scripture we read but the Brenham said yes the morning coming just just before the morning is the darkest hour he said the morning comes for those who are prepared for the morning that's what what about himself but the night comes for those who are not prepared for the morning the morning star this is not about coming to church is that about shouting and jumping right now it's about Lord my soul I'm on watch for my soil my watch for my marriage I'm on watch for the young people we have become so casual that we have not even seen it there's something we can do about what somebody else is going through because David had the experience of watching for his sheep and as watchman for his sheep he understood what it meant and felt like when the lion chemo and the beer came so when he went to his brothers and he was walking away and he heard Goliath he was like not on my watch who is this uncircumcised Philistine that has oppressed my brothers David was the under oppression from Goliath he has not heard about the situation until he was walking away he had not been there for days you didn't know their struggles he didn't know their pains but once he heard it he was like I got to do something about it not on my watch and many times we have people who are struggling who are tired who are weary who want to give up and we see them and we don't see anything we see them and we don't pray we see them and we don't act when all of us are watch for one another we are on watch to make sure that we can make it [Applause] [Music] in the Army in certain special units they have certain codes not one shall be left behind we don't leave a man in enemy territory they are built like that they would go black under gunfire to pull out one man because of the cordon their lives and go to war and watch one another where you I'd rather where you are Charlie where you are alpha they're gonna make sure they know everybody's that because we are in this thing together the watchman was nothing the tower for himself he was in the tower for everybody and as watchman in the house of God we are on watch for everybody you don't have to like everybody but we've got to watch for everybody [Applause] encourage one another until love and goodwill sees a seeming like seeing a watch for one another because what you're going through somebody else is going through it you're peeing on your struggling somebody else going through it this is our house this is our church this is our we have to watch because judgment is around us marriages and trouble homes in trouble young people in trouble what are you gonna do about it when were you seeing not on my watch let me pray more than I'm free before couldn't you watch with me for one hour couldn't you take times of watch for one hour you couldn't take you can make time to pray or for one hour who oh god help us this morning I'm not gonna be too much longer with you but I want this to sink in a bit this morning husbands are Watchmen fathers how much mothers are watch woman if you want to say that but we are all on watch Habakkuk 2 and verse 1 I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and I will watch to see what he will see unto me what I shall answer when I am reproved Matthew 24 and 42 watch therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord had come what are you looking at this morning what are you watching for are you looking for the spiritual things are you looking for the natural the Bible says what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul it sounds simple but how many us in the message are losing our souls because we are not watching I want to read the scripture because I really want this to sink in this week Matthew 26 then cometh Jesus unto them unto a place called Gethsemane and see it under disciples sit ye here while I go and pray on them and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be very sorrowful and very heavy Jesus was very sorrowful and very heavy I wonder how many people in here this morning are sorrowful very heavy heavy with life heavy heavy with regrets on pains and heavy with worry and confusion and heavy with pork eyes are different kinds of heaviness listen to Jesus then said he to them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me is there anybody here this morning is willing to watch with me while I go through my sorrow while I go through my pain there are people in pain here this morning is anybody willing to watch with me while I'm in my agony while I'm going through my stuff here we find Jesus going through his hardest moment he began to be sorrowful and very heavy and he said it to them he didn't keep it to himself he said to them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death please tarry here and watch with me and he went a little further down fell in his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible let this cup pass nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt but the Branham said that's where Jesus overcame in the Garden of Gethsemane on our journey to overcoming there's penis there's sorrow does God allows it to be that way but I ask a question is wondering if Jesus reach out to somebody to watch with me I'm not embarrassed I'm not ashamed to say I need help I'm not afraid to call some money say what do you pray for me I don't know how I'm gonna make it this week I don't know how I'm going to survive what's coming in your darkest moment that's when you need your brother that's when you need your sister if you can talk to somebody in the house of God who you're going to talk to I want you to make up understanding because they're people who come to church and they say well I don't want to talk to nobody I don't wanna I just come in and I want to get the wood and go home Jesus was going to pray to God his father and he still asked his brothers to watch with me some of us are way too selfish and when your time comes in your sorrow you don't even got friends to say could you watch with me and the people you call your friends in the world they don't even know what it means to watch with me pray with me I hope this hits home because this kills the self-righteousness of people who don't need anybody if Jesus himself could reach out this I want you to understand it so who would make more mistakes Jesus reached out to Peter and said Peter what do you watch with me I'm in sorrow I'm in pain god help us to enter into each other's sufferings and to go beyond just seeing God bless you and people say I'm praying for you if you need support I've got you I've got your back I'll watch with you I'll pray through with you god help us and he commits under his disciples and findeth them asleep say it on the pizza what what could you not watch with me one hour and Jesus says watch and pray that he enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak God is not trying to get to the act like a superhero God wants you to be real he wants it to be authentic that's what I love about pizza when Peter walked in the water and he came to the realization listen I'm thinking pizza was real but overall his preaches that Pizza was a fisherman him you are a fish Peter kind of swarm back and but he said Lord I'm sinking help me maybe there's somebody this morning wants the church to watch with them I know I do he said only perfect love will enter there he didn't say the courts will take you there is it perfect love it's not knowledge do I have all knowledge so I know all mysteries oh I see the poor do I give my body to be burned if I don't have charity perfect love I'm nothing the purpose of this gospel is to bring us to death but that we are totally dependent on him and because we are totally dependent upon him our relationship with our brothers and sisters become different because we are all part of that same body because by one's spirit we are baptized into that party your pain becomes my pain your victory becomes my victory your success becomes my success we need one another because we are one party we are one family that's why not church can hold the Holy Ghost only the body can hold the Holy Ghost you can't cut off anybody because God to deal with everybody he could deal with anybody we need more love we need more forgiveness we need more patience but today I declare my independence not on my watch I'm not gonna sit back and see the young people being punched around by the devil anymore not on my watch give me some men who would stand with me that would see nothing on my watch that's for me and my house we will serve the Lord give me some praying mothers who would say not on my watch I'm gonna pray until my son is delivered until my door turns in the liver until that marriage is resolved until we see revival until we see seven living voices [Applause] it pained the profit young people and I see young people in here and some of you I don't even have to discern that you're struggling your social media profiles Selma you're struggling the Bible speaks about God knows the their very thoughts your own thoughts and that'll be used as your judgments so may you know your thoughts you make it visible where you stand what you believe the Bible says rebuke openly that people will fear in other words whatever you have to do because your soul is more important than your flesh more important than your spirit we are try on being but one of these days this flesh but not much anymore we won the salvation of our souls the deliverance of our soul the redemption of our soul because here's another body that's waiting for us but the time has come to strip ourselves away and have our own Calvary experience and if we need somebody to pray with us we'll be it so be it I said a few more and I'm gonna be done in sister book I've seen mark 13 and verse 30 the Bible says verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the take heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey listen to this friends who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man every man this is where I bring the scripture that says we are all Watchmen to every man his work and commanded the porter even the porter to watch what she therefore for you know not when the master of the house cometh and even at midnight or at the cock-crowing or in the morning less coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what listen I say unto you I say unto all watch I read it one more time that last scripture and what I say unto you I say unto all watch well what are you watching friends are you watching for his coming are you watching for the rapture are you watching for the Holy Ghost are you watching for deliverance are you watching for a breakthrough are you watching for God to do something in your house are you watching for a miracle are you watching for the manifestation of the word in your life
