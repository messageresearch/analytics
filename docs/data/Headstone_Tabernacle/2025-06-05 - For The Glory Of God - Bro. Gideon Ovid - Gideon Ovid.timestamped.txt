[24:20] We lift you up Lord. Lord we make our
[24:23] boast in you Lord. There is none like
[24:25] you. Creator of heaven and earth,
[24:28] creator of everything, Lord. Lord, you
[24:30] provide the air that we breathe tonight,
[24:33] Lord. Lord, you give us the strength in
[24:35] our bones to be here, Lord. You allow us
[24:38] to see a new day and to be gathered
[24:40] together in this way, Lord. Lord, we
[24:42] thank you. We love you. We praise you.
[24:44] We worship you, Lord. There is none like
[24:46] you in all the earth. We could search
[24:49] high and low, left and right, north and
[24:51] south, and we will find nobody that
[24:53] could compare to your love, to your
[24:55] grace, your power, your presence. Lord,
[24:58] I pray that you captivate us tonight.
[25:00] That your angels will surround us, that
[25:02] your power would be with us tonight.
[25:05] That you will manifest yourself among
[25:07] us, Lord. That we'll see signs, wonders,
[25:10] and miracles, Lord. Lord, that you will
[25:12] meet every need, Lord. Lord, your people
[25:15] have gathered together in faith, in need
[25:18] of something, desirous of more, Lord.
[25:21] They want more than just words, more
[25:23] than just a song, Lord, but they want to
[25:25] hear direct from you, Lord. Lord, I pray
[25:28] that you speak to your people, Lord.
[25:30] That you will speak to their hearts,
[25:32] Lord. That you'll inspire them, that you
[25:34] will lift them up and raise up those
[25:36] that are tired, Lord, those that are
[25:38] weary, those that may be struggling,
[25:40] Lord. Lord, strengthen the feeble knees
[25:42] tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that your
[25:44] anointing will pour out. Lord, I pray
[25:47] that you will cast away every
[25:49] distraction, everything that could
[25:51] easily be settled that could throw us
[25:53] off, Lord. Lord, that we just have our
[25:56] mind focused on you. That our hearts
[25:59] will be focused on you, Lord. That we
[26:01] could we just just worship you and
[26:04] praise you on bridal praise, Lord. That
[26:06] we no hindrance our worship, no
[26:09] hindrance our adoration of you, Lord. We
[26:12] love you and we praise you and we thank
[26:14] you Lord. You've been so good. You've
[26:16] been so kind. You've been so merciful,
[26:18] so loving. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[26:22] Amen. You love the Lord
[26:25] tonight. Thank you, lamb of
[26:28] God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. If
[26:31] you have your Bibles, turn with me to a
[26:34] quick portion of
[26:36] scripture. Reading in book of
[26:39] [Music]
[26:51] Psalms. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[26:54] Lord. What a mighty God we serve.
[27:02] Amen. Just reading a few verses in
[27:04] Psalms chapter 84.
[27:07] And it says, "How amiable I thy
[27:10] tabernacles, oh Lord of
[27:12] hosts. My soul longeth, yeah, even
[27:14] fainted for the courts of the Lord. My
[27:17] heart and my flesh cried out for the
[27:19] living God. Yay, the sparrow hath found
[27:22] an house, and a swallow a nest for
[27:23] herself, where she may lay her young,
[27:25] even thine altars. Oh Lord of hosts, my
[27:28] king and my God. Blessed are they that
[27:31] dwell in thy house. They will be still
[27:34] praising the sailor. May we bow our
[27:36] heads one more time. Oh heavenly father,
[27:38] we thank you Lord for your word. We
[27:41] thank you for the inspiration to have
[27:43] your service tonight. Lord, we thank you
[27:44] for your people that are gathered here
[27:46] in person. Lord, those connected on the
[27:48] internet and wherever they might be
[27:49] right now. I pray that you would meet
[27:51] them, Lord. Touch them. Those that may
[27:53] engage with this content even
[27:54] afterwards, Lord. I pray that their
[27:56] needs be met. That lives be changed and
[27:58] transformed. That no one will come here
[28:00] the same way and and leave the same way
[28:02] they came. Lord, Lord, I pray that lives
[28:05] would not just be changed, but that
[28:07] hearts will be healed, that minds would
[28:09] be renewed, Lord, Lord, and their faith
[28:12] will be lifted and built such that they
[28:14] could see the miraculous tonight, Lord.
[28:17] Lord, I pray that you take full control
[28:19] over the the musicians, the technicians,
[28:21] Lord. The songs that will be sung, the
[28:23] words that will be spoken, Lord, speak
[28:25] to your people in Jesus name.
[28:28] Amen. Let's sing that song. I exalt
[28:30] thee, oh Lord.

[33:42] [Music]
[33:46] Let's sing that song. Last song.
[33:49] You made a
[33:54] way. When my back was against the
[33:58] wall and it looked as if it were over
[34:02] that
[34:04] you you made a
[34:09] way. And now we're standing
[34:13] here only because you
[34:17] made saying
[34:19] you you made a way. Just think about it
[34:23] tonight.
[34:26] When my back was against the

[34:33] for
[34:34] you, you made a
[34:39] way. Now we're standing
[34:43] here only because you
[34:47] made a
[34:49] way. Listen. And you move
[34:54] mountains. You cause walls to
[34:58] fall with your
[35:02] power. Perform
[35:05] miracles and there is
[35:09] nothing that's
[35:13] impossible. Now we're standing

[35:24] mountains, you cause walls to fall with
[35:29] your power.

[36:06] over. that you you made a
[36:13] way. Now we're standing

[36:28] Jesus. Just worship him right now.
[36:29] Wherever you are, wherever you are right
[36:32] now, just give him praise. Just give him
[36:35] glory. Just give him honor. Just give
[36:39] him worship. He deserves every ounce of
[36:42] your praise
[36:43] tonight. Every inch of your worship, he
[36:47] deserves it. He is greater than any
[36:50] challenge you have, any problem, any
[36:53] trial, however you feel, doesn't matter
[36:56] right now because he made a way for you
[36:59] to be here. He predestinated that you be

[37:30] of
[37:31] God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Where
[37:35] would we be without his blood tonight?
[37:38] Where would we be without his grace?
[37:40] Where would we be without his love,
[37:43] without his power, without his presence,
[37:46] without his leadership and
[37:49] guidance? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[37:53] Amen. Thank you,
[37:55] Jesus. Thank you, lamb of God.
[37:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[38:04] Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[38:07] Lord. My my my my. It sure feels good in
[38:11] here tonight. I don't know if you
[38:13] realize, but I'm excited. I know
[38:16] something good is about to happen. I
[38:19] can't predict what it is, but I know
[38:22] something good is in store. You just got
[38:24] to reach out and grab a hold tonight.
[38:28] You can leave here healed tonight. You
[38:31] can leave here delivered tonight. You

[38:38] liberty
[38:39] tonight. Amen. Amen. Amen. You love
[38:43] him. Thank you, Jesus. Let's just give

[38:58] [Music]
[38:59] Thank you, lamb of
[39:02] God.
[39:04] Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[39:07] Lord. Just want to switch over to the
[39:10] word at this time. Thank you, brother
[39:16] Steven. Hallelujah.
[39:19] You love the Lord tonight. What a mighty
[39:21] God we serve. Amen. If you have your
[39:25] Bibles, I'd like you to turn with me to
[39:27] just a couple scriptures. Amen.
[39:32] Reading from the book of St. John,
[39:33] chapter
[39:34] 11. Just the first four verses
[39:38] there. When you find it, you could say,
[39:40] "Amen."
[39:49] Amen. My my
[39:55] In the book of St. John chapter
[39:57] 11 from verse 1, it says, "Now a certain
[40:02] man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany,
[40:05] the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
[40:08] It was that Mary which anointed the Lord
[40:10] with ointment and wiped his feet with
[40:11] her hair whose brother Lazarus was
[40:13] sick." In verse three, therefore his
[40:16] sister sent unto him, saying, Lord,
[40:19] behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. And
[40:22] in verse four, when Jesus heard that, he
[40:25] said, "This sickness is not unto death,
[40:28] but for the glory of God, that the Son
[40:31] of God might be glorified thereby."
[40:35] We just bow our heads as
[40:38] we offer a word of
[40:40] prayer. Oh, heavenly father, Lord, we've
[40:44] come under expectation tonight, Lord, to
[40:47] hear from you. I pray that you would
[40:48] take me out to the way, Lord. Lord, I
[40:50] pray that you would quicken your words
[40:53] tonight, Lord. That somebody could be
[40:55] touched, somebody could be changed,
[40:57] somebody could be set free, somebody
[40:58] could be delivered, Lord. I pray that
[41:00] you would anoint my words, Lord, and and
[41:03] anoint the scriptures, Lord. Lord, that
[41:05] you will put it together, Lord, that
[41:07] only only the way that you can, Lord, to
[41:10] serve your people, to deliver this
[41:12] message, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[41:14] have your preeminence tonight. I pray
[41:16] that you do a perfect work tonight,
[41:18] Lord. I pray that I would deliver it the
[41:20] way that you wanted, Lord. Lord, that we
[41:23] wouldn't come here just to play games,
[41:24] just to see each other, Lord, just for a
[41:26] social gathering, Lord, but to find a
[41:29] reality, Lord, and to to be drawn closer
[41:31] to you, Lord. Have your perfect will
[41:33] tonight in Jesus name we pray. Amen. You
[41:36] may have your seats.
[41:39] Don't want to keep you too long.
[41:42] So you know I'm not a long speaker
[41:44] but I want you to hold that scripture
[41:48] in the St.
[41:49] John 11 we read verse 1 to4. Amen.
[41:53] There's so much power in there. There is
[41:56] so much anointing in there. There's so
[41:58] much wrapped up in there. But I want to
[42:00] paint a picture tonight. And before I
[42:03] move forward I want to tell you my
[42:04] title. My title is for the glory of God.
[42:07] Amen. God often does stuff that we can't
[42:09] understand for his glory. Just because
[42:12] he is God just be because he is big and
[42:14] and he wants things happen a particular
[42:17] way. You
[42:18] see God's word is is is is is the
[42:21] antidote. It's like medication. You know
[42:23] sometimes you take up a bottle of
[42:24] medication and you read it and it has
[42:26] different things on it. It has
[42:28] directions. Sometimes you may see
[42:30] instructions. They may have the dosage
[42:33] based on your age and different
[42:34] criteria. Sometimes you need to read the
[42:37] fine print to ensure that what you're
[42:39] taking is accurate for the symptoms you
[42:42] have or the challenges you have. So, so
[42:45] just like the word of God is the
[42:47] antidote in that sense when you look if
[42:49] you were to look at God and you know at
[42:52] times they say best before meals
[42:54] sometimes after meals first thing on an
[42:56] empty stomach. If we read the fine
[42:58] prints in the Bible they might they
[43:00] might say the attributes of God are best
[43:02] expressed through adversity. That's the
[43:05] kind of thing you will see. It's not
[43:07] just expressed. It's best expressed
[43:09] through adversity. You see, he loves to
[43:12] find you when you're sick so he could
[43:14] heal you. He loves to find you when
[43:17] you're broken so he could put you back
[43:18] together. He likes to take you when
[43:20] you're low so he could lift you up. He
[43:23] likes to find you when you're poor so he
[43:25] could make you rich. He likes to find
[43:27] when you're back against the wall so he
[43:28] could pull you through. When you're at
[43:30] the end of the rope, so he could lift
[43:32] you up. He likes to find you in position
[43:34] in precarious positions when you you're
[43:37] not sure how you're going to get out of
[43:38] this one. That's that's often times
[43:40] where he wants to find you because
[43:42] that's when he could show up strong.
[43:45] That's when he could get the most glory.
[43:47] He wants you when you're in the battle
[43:48] because he's the mighty conqueror. He
[43:50] wants you when it looks like things not
[43:52] working out because he's the answer. He
[43:55] He wants you in these strange things
[43:57] that you can't explain. And it looks
[43:59] like you're low and it looks like you're
[44:00] dumb and it looks like you're broke and
[44:02] it looks like like there's no thing no
[44:05] good thing could come out of Nazareth.
[44:07] And no good thing could come out of
[44:08] wherever you live tonight. That's
[44:10] sometimes a place he wants you because
[44:12] in there he gets to glory because he
[44:15] could pull you out and put you where he
[44:17] wants you. Put you where he wants you to
[44:19] go. Make you who he wants you to be. Cuz
[44:22] sometimes we there because of
[44:23] circumstance, because of environment,
[44:25] because of family, because of different
[44:27] things. But but often times when we look
[44:31] around and we look a little closer and
[44:32] we read the fine print, we realize wait
[44:34] only for his glory we are here. We are
[44:37] in a position and you think was your
[44:39] boss, you think was your children or you
[44:41] think they're frustrating you. No, God
[44:43] wants to get the glory in your home. He
[44:46] wants to get the glory in your job. He
[44:48] wants to get the glory in your
[44:49] community. That's why even when Lazarus
[44:52] was sick and the scripture said it there
[44:54] he said you know my brother the one you
[44:56] love so so we dropped something in there
[44:59] extra the impetus drive motivation to
[45:01] come and deal with the scenario he said
[45:03] that that that same one you love he's
[45:05] sick he's not doing too well in in other
[45:09] words we recommend that that you come
[45:10] hastily that you come quickly that you
[45:13] do what you must do in his life right
[45:15] now that you you do a miracle tonight
[45:19] and and he said hold
[45:21] Wait a minute. Here's the thing. I could
[45:24] probably do that, you know.
[45:27] But you know what?
[45:30] It's better if I wait a while.
[45:32] Because I I I doing this not for me. I'm
[45:35] not doing this for show. I'm not doing
[45:37] this because I I want you to have a nice
[45:39] story to tell, but I'm doing for his
[45:41] glory, for his honor, for so he could be
[45:45] glorified. So he could be worshiped. So
[45:48] he could receive the praise. So he could
[45:50] receive the ad adoration. So it's not
[45:53] about you tonight. It's not about me
[45:55] tonight, but it's about him for his
[45:58] glory, for his honor. So his attributes
[46:02] could be magnified in your life, in your
[46:05] scenario, in your situation. I know it
[46:08] seemed like, "Oh gosh, this Christian
[46:10] journey is so hard and the trials and
[46:13] the challenges and the ups and downs and
[46:15] I I really thought I would have been in
[46:16] a better position and I really want to
[46:18] to show I want to show this thing and I
[46:21] want to show that thing and I want to to
[46:22] to No, no, no. At the end of the day, he
[46:26] has the final say. He will shift things
[46:29] around. Listen, he will change your
[46:30] boss. He will change governments. He
[46:32] will change your neighbors. He will pass
[46:35] laws and enforce things to ensure he
[46:37] gets the glory that his attributes are
[46:40] magnified and glorified. He not playing
[46:43] in it's not it's not God is a trinity
[46:45] and and the way I want him to come I
[46:48] really wanted him to do this and I
[46:49] wanted to operate so because it could
[46:51] reflect. No, it's not about your your
[46:53] thoughts. No, your thoughts are not his
[46:55] thoughts. His thoughts are higher than
[46:57] yours. His ways are different to yours.
[47:00] You can't measure up yet. That's why I
[47:02] say he deserves all the glory, all the
[47:05] honor, all the worship, all the praise,
[47:09] all the adoration.
[47:11] [Music]
[47:17] Now, I I know I told you before to to
[47:19] put your finger on the scripture to keep
[47:20] it right there. I want to revisit and
[47:24] and move forward to from verse five.
[47:26] Now, let's go a little deeper. Somebody
[47:29] say deeper. Deeper. We want to go deeper
[47:31] tonight. We want to explore a little
[47:34] more. Right? So, we already established
[47:36] that he doing things the way he wanted.
[47:39] He doing things for his glory. He doing
[47:41] it. And it may look strange to you that
[47:43] he didn't answer your prayer yet.
[47:45] It may look strange to you that you
[47:47] didn't get the promotion yet. It may
[47:49] look strange to you that you didn't get
[47:50] the call that you expected to get, but
[47:53] for his glory. So, don't listen. Don't
[47:56] fight up. Don't beat up. Keep on
[47:58] praying.
[47:59] Keep on coming. Keep on worshiping. B
[48:03] your knees more. Do it deeper, farther,
[48:07] faster. Listen, he listen. He want to
[48:10] push you and turn you and burn you. He
[48:13] want to heat it. Listen. When listen,
[48:16] when the three Hebrew boys say we're not
[48:18] going to bow down, God could have come
[48:20] and say, "Listen, you see fellas, all
[48:22] you real faithful and thing, let me take
[48:23] all you and put all your way." So, he
[48:25] could have do that. You know, but you
[48:26] know what he say? Hotter, hotter, more
[48:30] pressure, more pressure. So you on your
[48:32] job, you feel, oh gosh, pressure here,
[48:35] boy. My my appraisal, my boss, the 360,
[48:39] the person telling they lie about me and
[48:42] is is untrue is a rumor, you know. No.
[48:44] And you trying to defend. Listen, you
[48:46] know, cuz he know you could take it. He
[48:49] know you have what you take because he
[48:50] he listen, he chose his best soldiers
[48:52] for this time.
[48:54] He wouldn't put you through that if he
[48:56] didn't think you would have come true.
[48:58] He don't put you in battle for joke. He
[49:01] not going to sacrifice here. You know,
[49:03] you know it have something called
[49:05] suicide bombers. They just strap on and
[49:08] they go on and they don't mind running
[49:09] and listen to sacrifice themselves
[49:13] in in lie of battle in the name of
[49:16] whoever they supporting God work.
[49:20] He said, "Listen, every place you put
[49:22] your foot is yours. You will get the
[49:25] victory. You will be able to rejoice
[49:28] after the battle is over." So listen, he
[49:31] not losing one or no. Not one. So tell
[49:33] your children, put put them on notice
[49:35] tonight when you go home. Say, "He not
[49:37] giving up one." Not one. Not one will be
[49:41] left behind. He not going and give them
[49:43] up. No. So you can't give up on them
[49:46] tonight. You had to keep praying, keep
[49:49] listen, keep fasting, keep pressing,
[49:52] keep sacrificing for them. They're
[49:55] probably not ready yet. But it the truth
[49:57] is it's not that they're not ready. You
[49:59] know, he not ready for you yet. You
[50:02] know, there are some foods they will
[50:03] tell you, hang it out to dry.
[50:06] We can't use it wet. Let it dry. And
[50:10] when you check, let's say it's orange
[50:11] peel or whatever you look too green. You
[50:13] can't use it green. It need to dry. It
[50:16] has to go through the time. The sun need
[50:19] to burn it. It need to beat it. You
[50:22] can't feel sorry for it, you know. You
[50:24] can't say, "Look, let me help you." No.
[50:27] Listen, cuz they had to go through their
[50:28] process. God don't have grandchildren,
[50:30] you know. So sometimes they have to go
[50:32] through their process. But you have to
[50:34] do what you have to do. I sure you
[50:36] remember hearing about the praying
[50:37] grandmothers, the praying men, the
[50:40] praying women, the ancient ones who not
[50:43] giving up not in gossip and banal but
[50:46] they praying. They the listen they
[50:50] fasting,
[50:51] sacrificing, spending time on their
[50:53] knees, fellowshipping, having communion
[50:57] with God, having conversation with God
[51:00] so God could store it up as vials,
[51:03] knowing that listen, that is prayer of
[51:05] the righteous. That is the prayer of the
[51:08] godly. That's the prayer of the sincere
[51:10] and the honorable. And they love me.
[51:14] They are doing this out of fear. They're
[51:15] doing this because they love me.
[51:18] Hallelujah. I want to get back to the
[51:20] scripture. And in verse
[51:23] 5 of John
[51:26] 11, it says, "Now Jesus loved Martha and
[51:29] her sister and Lazarus."
[51:32] So he is trying to qualify that he
[51:35] didn't just abandon them, he loved them.
[51:38] And in verse six, he said, "When he had
[51:40] heard thereof that he was sick, he
[51:42] abodeed two days still in the same place
[51:43] where he was." In essence, he didn't
[51:46] move. Yes, he wait two extra days.
[51:49] Sometimes you need to to to to to to
[51:51] pray extra. So he wait extra days.
[51:55] In verse seven, he says, "Then after
[51:57] that said he to his disciples, let us go
[52:00] into Judea again." His disciples say
[52:02] unto him, "Master, the Jews have laid
[52:05] sought to stone thee." In essence,
[52:07] that's not a good idea. And goest thou
[52:10] hither again. Again you want to go. Is
[52:13] elixia like? In verse 9, Jesus answered,
[52:16] "Are there not 12 hours in the day? If
[52:19] any man walk in the day, he stumble not
[52:21] because he seeth the light of this
[52:22] world. But if a man walking in the
[52:24] night, he stumbleth because there is no
[52:26] light in him." These things in verse 11
[52:30] said he, "And after that he said unto
[52:33] them, our friend Lazarus sleepeth." So
[52:35] he reinforced highlighted again that
[52:38] this is my friend. This is not a
[52:40] stranger. This is not a odd request.
[52:42] This is our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but
[52:45] I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
[52:48] In verse 12, then said his disciples,
[52:50] Lord, if he sleep, he shall do
[52:53] well. How be it, Jesus spake of his
[52:55] death. But they thought that he had
[52:58] spoken of taking of rest in sleep. In
[53:02] verse 14, then said Jesus unto them
[53:05] plainly, Lazarus is dead. So this is not
[53:08] a parable. I'm not using an illustration
[53:10] or example. He He died. Amen. He dead.
[53:14] Yeah. Hallelujah. In verse 15, it says,
[53:17] "I am glad for your sake that I was not
[53:20] there." To the intent you may
[53:24] believe. Here it is again. To the
[53:28] intent ye may believe. Nevertheless, let
[53:32] us go on to him. In essence, I want to
[53:35] ensure that you could believe what is
[53:38] going to take place. I want you to
[53:40] recognize that although it looks gloomy
[53:42] and it looks dismal and it looks like he
[53:45] can't recover from this scenario let us
[53:48] go now now that we could guarantee and
[53:50] in short it reminds me of Elijah when
[53:52] the false prophets prayed and they did a
[53:55] simid and nothing happens you know what
[53:57] he said he said listen let us pour water
[53:59] dig trenches around it and pour water
[54:01] you see we want to ensure that this is
[54:03] not flukes we don't want to say because
[54:05] you wait last and you went second will
[54:07] you allow you know everything to dry up
[54:09] so the fire could come and incinerate
[54:11] and burn. No, he not leaving it a chance
[54:14] of opinion. He said, "Pour water." And
[54:17] when they pour the water, he say,
[54:18] "Listen, pour more." I want to ensure
[54:21] beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is
[54:24] no sense, no ounce, there's no inch of
[54:27] disbelief in what is about to take
[54:28] place. Because God must get the glory.
[54:32] This is not about Elijah, but the God of
[54:35] Elijah, the God I serve is greater than
[54:39] the gods of the false prophets. Amen. So
[54:42] here Jesus is with his disciples. And he
[54:44] said, "Listen, perhaps we should go."
[54:46] Amen. And tar a little bit. We should
[54:49] wait because we want to ensure that
[54:52] Lazarus is properly dead. Amen. We don't
[54:56] want it up to guest. We don't want
[54:57] somebody say, "Well, they put him in
[54:59] yesterday and he was kind of moving, you
[55:01] know, so he probably have oxygen that
[55:03] could last." No, we want to ensure he is
[55:06] dead. Because the God I serve is not,
[55:09] listen, he's not a normal person. He is
[55:12] God. He listen, he's certified and
[55:14] qualified in the impossible. That's his
[55:16] specialization. You know, there are do
[55:18] there are doctors who specialize in
[55:20] brain surgery. those that specialize in
[55:23] in heart valve replacement and all kind
[55:26] of stuff. Listen, he specialized in the
[55:28] impossible.
[55:30] So when it seems that there's no way,
[55:33] there is no hope. There is no turning
[55:35] back. That is when his specialization
[55:38] comes on display. When he comes and say,
[55:40] "I'm Dr. Jesus. I heard you have a
[55:43] problem. I heard you have a child giving
[55:45] trouble. Your child in the club tonight
[55:47] and you don't know what to do. They're
[55:49] smoking weed and you don't know what to
[55:51] do. They listen, they're living in sin
[55:53] and you don't know what to do. You're
[55:55] fed up. Talk to them and you're praying
[55:57] for them. He specialized in that. That's
[56:00] his area of specialization.
[56:03] When it seems like your troubles is too
[56:06] much to bear, that's when he shows up
[56:08] and say, "Listen, let us go. Let us
[56:12] solve this. Let's sort this out." Why?
[56:14] Because we want to bring glory to God.
[56:17] And we want you to believe that it's not
[56:19] about us, but it's about him.
[56:23] Amen.
[56:25] The Lord add a blessing to the reader of
[56:27] his word. Amen. What a mighty God we
[56:30] serve.
[56:32] You see,
[56:34] he loves us in this scenario. You see,
[56:37] if everything is all well and good, you
[56:39] see, listen, the well don't need a
[56:41] physician. Amen. You see, when you're
[56:43] sick, that is when you have no choice
[56:46] but to take medication.
[56:48] When you take medication enough that it
[56:50] not working anymore and after that you
[56:53] go by the specialist, you pay them the
[56:55] money and the money runs out. That is
[56:58] the time when he show up and one say
[57:00] understand you use everything and it
[57:03] look like you're dying. I reach now.
[57:06] Amen. Because outside of that, the
[57:08] doctor get the glory, the medication get
[57:11] the glory. But you see, when you could
[57:13] see a prayer request turn to a note of
[57:14] praise and the doctors baffled and say,
[57:18] I don't know what you're doing or know,
[57:20] but what I know is last week test and
[57:22] this week test looking different. We
[57:25] don't have the antidote for that. We
[57:28] don't have the medication for that. And
[57:30] I don't know if I'll get it, but there's
[57:32] a coach where they say,
[57:33] "Listen, there is an antidote. There's a
[57:36] there's a medication that Moses used in
[57:39] order when he took the people out of
[57:41] Egypt to survive for 100 years. Listen,
[57:44] they in the desert, you know, and they
[57:47] living
[57:48] these this new crop that God predestined
[57:53] to go into the promised land. Nothing
[57:55] wrong with them, you know. They are
[57:56] going with oh gosh, my foot and I
[57:58] limping and something wrong and my
[58:00] pressure high and my pulse funny and I
[58:03] have a little murmur on my heart.
[58:05] They're going with that. You know, they
[58:07] say the medication he used, every doctor
[58:09] would love to know. But you know what?
[58:11] We have it tonight.
[58:14] The word of God is the antidote. The
[58:18] word of God is what they use. It's
[58:20] simple or know. Listen. He is the God
[58:23] that heal thee.
[58:28] It right there in the word. All the
[58:31] answers you're looking for right there.
[58:34] He said, "I am the Lord that healed
[58:36] thee." Where else you're going? What
[58:39] else you're doing? I listen. I make
[58:42] that. I could remake it, too. So missing
[58:45] limbs could be restored because he in
[58:48] the creation business.
[58:50] That's his business. That's his job.
[58:53] That's his role. Listen, scientists
[58:56] right now still trying to explain how
[58:58] parts of the body work.
[59:00] I remember some years ago they say they
[59:02] don't know the the the role or the use
[59:04] of the appendix they couldn't find it
[59:07] after a while they trying and they think
[59:09] the think this and the thing that and
[59:10] think the other but it have no mistakes
[59:13] with God you know when God put the lungs
[59:16] the lungs is in its correct place every
[59:19] finger has its place the mind and the
[59:21] brain listen the brain sheltered by a
[59:23] skeletal listen the framework not right
[59:25] here he is such a perfectionist he make
[59:29] you in image and likeness because he
[59:32] knows when he make the image he destroy
[59:35] the mold. It's something that works.
[59:38] It's something that's perfect. It's
[59:40] something that have no question about
[59:42] it. He make it like that.
[59:45] G.
[59:47] So he like to find you when there's
[59:49] flaws. Hallelujah. When when you feel
[59:52] things bad, that's where he like to find
[59:54] you. We have evidence of that in script
[59:56] in scripture, you know. Amen. He came
[59:58] down one time and he said, "Adam, Adam,
[1:00:01] where are thou? Where you at? Where do
[1:00:03] you think he was doing? He came to find
[1:00:05] him."
[1:00:07] Because Adam was a little out of place.
[1:00:09] So that is when he shows up strong. He
[1:00:12] want to know where you at. He want to
[1:00:15] know what wrong with you. But he want
[1:00:17] you to come and tell him. He want you to
[1:00:19] come and surrender. He want you to come
[1:00:22] and confide in him and give up
[1:00:25] everything to give him control so he
[1:00:28] could give you a new heart and a new
[1:00:30] spirit and renew your mind and restore
[1:00:33] you. That's what he wants.
[1:00:40] Hallelujah. In the midst of all that
[1:00:42] goodness,
[1:00:43] Satan have a role
[1:00:46] and his role is to steal, kill, and
[1:00:48] destroy.
[1:00:50] So we in this constant battle of good
[1:00:52] and evil. Amen.
[1:00:55] A continuous battle in a in a message
[1:00:57] the God of this evil age. Paragraph 170.
[1:01:01] It says remember the hour is close at
[1:01:03] hands when the mark will come. Amen.
[1:01:05] You'll either be in it or out of it.
[1:01:07] It'll come like a thief in a night.
[1:01:09] It'll catch you right in there and
[1:01:11] you're in there. There ain't no getting
[1:01:13] out of it. Then you done took it. Come
[1:01:16] out. An angel come down from heaven with
[1:01:19] a great shining face and cried out to
[1:01:21] the people. It shook the earth. Come out
[1:01:23] of Babylon, for she is fallen. Be not
[1:01:26] partakers of her plagues, my people. Get
[1:01:29] out of her. Get out. Didn't we read it
[1:01:31] in the word a while ago? The angel is a
[1:01:33] messenger. See, coming down. Notice the
[1:01:36] Holy Spirit. Come out of her that you
[1:01:39] may not be partakers. Now, she's built
[1:01:42] all kind of things.
[1:01:44] She has built great churches, built
[1:01:46] college schools, taking the people and
[1:01:49] educating them into a better so-called
[1:01:51] civilization. And they've educated them
[1:01:53] by a modern civilization that's brought
[1:01:55] them into the pit of death. Amen. By
[1:01:58] knowledge away from God and his word.
[1:02:00] Amen. Don't you see the whole scheme?
[1:02:02] Don't you see that church? You see, it's
[1:02:05] God of this earth. Amen. And she has
[1:02:08] built colleges, universities, hospitals,
[1:02:11] built libraries, built all kind of
[1:02:13] things for the temporary help of man.
[1:02:17] Just enough to deceive them to get them
[1:02:19] off the word. And what she's led them
[1:02:22] to, the whole church world is plunging
[1:02:23] to death. For God said that he would
[1:02:26] burn the and her children with an
[1:02:28] everlasting fire. Come out of it,
[1:02:30] people. Don't you be caught in there.
[1:02:33] You get away from that thing as quick as
[1:02:35] you can. By her scientific knowledge,
[1:02:37] she's has been able to do this. Now,
[1:02:40] notice without God's word. That's how
[1:02:43] Satan works. He will give you temporary
[1:02:46] pleasures, temporary things to satisfy
[1:02:50] you now without showing you the endgame.
[1:02:53] So, is a focus on now and not the
[1:02:56] future. A focus on just temporary and
[1:03:00] not permanence. Amen. Now, although that
[1:03:03] sound bad, I want you to buckle in
[1:03:04] tonight because it gets worse.
[1:03:08] In a message, I know my redeemer live.
[1:03:11] Paragraph 88. Said, "Night presses on."
[1:03:14] And let's put that now to nationally.
[1:03:18] This is the darkest hour today. This age
[1:03:21] is the darkest hour. The darkest hour
[1:03:24] the world has ever seen. Even nature
[1:03:26] trembles. At one moment, this whole
[1:03:29] earth could go to powder. What would
[1:03:32] happen if there's a reaction of hydrogen
[1:03:34] or oxygen or some of these great bombs,
[1:03:36] the atomic reaction? Every tree, every
[1:03:39] grass, everything, every limb, every
[1:03:41] purpose, every person, everything will
[1:03:43] just break to pieces and turn back to
[1:03:45] acid. See what it is? The whole world is
[1:03:48] trembling. There's bombs ready.
[1:03:50] Everything seems to be set right at
[1:03:52] time. And if darkness has its time set,
[1:03:56] how much more does light have it set?
[1:03:59] Amen. What's making it so dark now? What
[1:04:01] making these things? The church is all
[1:04:04] dysfellowship. We fussing. Oh, is there
[1:04:07] I'm a Methodist. I'm a Presbyterian. I'm
[1:04:09] a Pentecostal. I'm Church of God. I'm
[1:04:11] Assemblies. Oh, can't you see children?
[1:04:14] If that's all we had to stand on, we'd
[1:04:16] be a miserable people in this world.
[1:04:19] You see that? That's what the prophet
[1:04:21] said. Amen. Yes, sir. I got good news.
[1:04:25] He also spoke a message
[1:04:28] and he said, "You know what? In the
[1:04:30] darkest hour,
[1:04:32] that's when Jesus likes to show up."
[1:04:36] So, I'm not trying to frighten you
[1:04:37] tonight. We acknowledging the fact that
[1:04:40] the hour is late. It might be dark, but
[1:04:42] you know what? That is the time when
[1:04:43] Jesus likes to show up.
[1:04:48] Now, for an inspiration
[1:04:50] tonight, after the darkest hour. Yes.
[1:04:54] Right. That's my inspiration. After the
[1:04:56] darkest hour. Amen.
[1:04:59] So, we establish a couple
[1:05:03] things. It's dark. The hour is evil.
[1:05:07] Yes. We talk about the God of the evil
[1:05:09] age. They're seeking to destroy, seeking
[1:05:12] to
[1:05:14] distract. But there's a message the
[1:05:16] prophet preached when he said, "It is I
[1:05:18] be not afraid." So, I told you this
[1:05:20] message is not a message of fear. You
[1:05:22] know, yes, is a message of reality to
[1:05:25] point you to the hour in which we live
[1:05:27] right now. Amen. In that message,
[1:05:30] paragraph 27, it says, "But when all
[1:05:32] hope is gone, they happen to notice
[1:05:36] they seen someone coming walking in the
[1:05:38] water." Talking about the disciples.
[1:05:40] Amen. That's the way he does it. Right
[1:05:42] at the last moment, the darkest hour,
[1:05:45] Jesus comes along and he come walking on
[1:05:48] the water. Now the tragedy of this scene
[1:05:50] and this is where I'm speaking is that
[1:05:53] people without hope was sent hope. If
[1:05:56] you could remember the the the scripture
[1:05:58] this is when the ways were contrary.
[1:06:00] This is where things were going wrong.
[1:06:02] He came walking on the water right and
[1:06:05] they were sent hope and was afraid of it
[1:06:07] when it got there. Just about like today
[1:06:10] the only hope they had was the mercy of
[1:06:13] Christ. Their boat was sinking. Their os
[1:06:16] were gone. They were at the mercy of the
[1:06:18] devil on the sea and a storm twisting
[1:06:20] them and the only hope they could have
[1:06:22] was coming to them and they were afraid
[1:06:24] of it. They afraid that it was a ghost
[1:06:27] some sort as we'd say in street language
[1:06:29] a spook some spooky character come
[1:06:31] walking on the water and they cried out
[1:06:33] with fear. But there came a voice from
[1:06:36] there that allsufficient voice that
[1:06:39] takes to still it. Fear not. It is I. Be
[1:06:43] of good courage.
[1:06:45] That's the same one that comes to us
[1:06:47] tonight. That voice when we're at the
[1:06:49] end of our wits, when we're at the end
[1:06:51] of our journey from church to church,
[1:06:53] bringing our letter from church to
[1:06:55] Methodist to Baptist to Presbyterian to
[1:06:57] Pentecostal and so on. Listen, all them
[1:07:00] churches are fine. You know, but that's
[1:07:02] still not the answer. When you went from
[1:07:05] doctor's office to doctor's office to
[1:07:07] clinic, that's all right, but that still
[1:07:10] isn't your answer. They've turned you
[1:07:12] down. The answer is in the building
[1:07:14] tonight. The Holy Spirit of God. Don't
[1:07:18] be afraid of it. It doesn't make
[1:07:20] fanatics. It takes fanatics and make
[1:07:23] saints out of them. Don't be afraid of
[1:07:26] it. It's the only hope that you have.
[1:07:30] My what a mighty God we serve.
[1:07:34] You see, a lot of times we afraid of the
[1:07:36] dark, but tonight there's a man that
[1:07:40] could turn on the light. There's
[1:07:42] somebody that could make everything all
[1:07:44] right. Amen. Now listen,
[1:07:50] Abraham in a message, El
[1:07:52] Shai, paragraph 38, it said he was s he
[1:07:56] was setting out in this hot sun. The
[1:07:59] herdsman came up and said, "Oh my,
[1:08:00] they're carrying on. So they're
[1:08:02] complaining. They're having issues. The
[1:08:05] water's all gone and everything look
[1:08:07] like it's wrong. Sounds like your life
[1:08:09] tonight." Watch out when that happens to
[1:08:12] a Christian when that happens is a
[1:08:15] blessing laying just beyond there and
[1:08:19] Satan's trying his best to keep it away
[1:08:22] from you. I've seen that in my life when
[1:08:25] I go to pray and we know the story. I'll
[1:08:27] get out in the woods, the green brows.
[1:08:30] You don't have them here, do you? But we
[1:08:32] have plenty of them back in the east and
[1:08:34] they scratch you. You get over here and
[1:08:37] the sun shines down through the trees on
[1:08:38] you. You get over here on the hillside
[1:08:41] and you're praying like this and over
[1:08:43] here there's too many rocks and
[1:08:44] mosquitoes are biting and oh everything.
[1:08:47] Now when you get to that kind of a place
[1:08:49] just throw up your arms and say
[1:08:51] hallelujah God you're calling me and I'm
[1:08:54] answering to you. Something's going to
[1:08:56] happen. Something's going to happen
[1:08:58] tonight. Something's going to happen in
[1:09:00] your home and you here. You're right
[1:09:02] here and something taking place. Like
[1:09:05] that centurion could say, "What time?"
[1:09:08] While I was in service, you mean my
[1:09:10] child was getting delivered. While I was
[1:09:12] in service, my neighbor straightening
[1:09:14] out. I can't explain it anymore. Here's
[1:09:17] what he said. He said something's going
[1:09:19] to happen. That's right. Cuz there's a
[1:09:21] blessing laying there and Satan's trying
[1:09:24] to fight you. He's a old mean split
[1:09:27] foot. Anyhow, you know, he's trying his
[1:09:30] best to keep you away from that
[1:09:31] blessing. Just stay there till you pray
[1:09:34] through.
[1:09:36] I don't know care. Let the mosquitoes
[1:09:38] bite. Whatever takes place, just stay
[1:09:41] with it. Cuz Satan will rob you from
[1:09:43] that if he possibly can. Remember I said
[1:09:46] he has his role. He want to steal. He
[1:09:50] want to kill you. He want to destroy. He
[1:09:53] want to stifle your dreams tonight. But
[1:09:55] you have to pray through. You have to
[1:09:58] hold on. You have to believe. You have
[1:10:00] to have faith. It need to be sunk listen
[1:10:03] on a on a solid rock. You need to have
[1:10:06] your your anchor holding that no matter
[1:10:09] what the waste could come. Listen, do a
[1:10:12] thousand on my right side or 10,000 on
[1:10:14] the other side. Listen, you are not
[1:10:16] moved because you know, listen, you know
[1:10:19] the promise upon which you're standing
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:23] tonight. There are examples all around
[1:10:26] us. There are examples in the scripture.
[1:10:28] There are examples in the message. I
[1:10:30] want to give you an example in nature.
[1:10:32] Listen, brother Brandon preacher
[1:10:34] message, God's provided way of dealing
[1:10:36] with sin. Paragraph 18, here's what he
[1:10:38] said. He said, "And if you notice the
[1:10:40] very teaching of nature, watch nature."
[1:10:43] If you want to see God, God in his great
[1:10:46] nature, you watch just before the sun
[1:10:49] come up of the morning. Isaiah, I
[1:10:52] believe a prophet one time, he said,
[1:10:53] "Watch man, what of the night? The
[1:10:55] morning cometh and the night also." If
[1:10:57] you notice, he was scripturally in
[1:10:59] order. Watch. The first thing come
[1:11:01] before the night come. Always the day
[1:11:04] before the daylight is the darkest.
[1:11:07] Just before the break of day, the
[1:11:09] darkest hour. If you're up early enough
[1:11:11] and you look outside, you'll say, "What
[1:11:13] going on? Did the night extended?" It
[1:11:15] darker than ever. He say it's always
[1:11:18] darkest just before the break of day.
[1:11:20] It's because the light is pressing and
[1:11:23] condensing the darkness. And that is at
[1:11:26] the time that the morning star comes
[1:11:27] out. It's only the early risers that
[1:11:30] ever sees the morning star. And I think
[1:11:33] in this great hour of darkness, just
[1:11:36] before the break of day, the morning
[1:11:37] star has shined again, spreading forth
[1:11:40] itself, the early risers who are rising,
[1:11:43] not setting back. I'll get saved next
[1:11:45] year. Listen, he have no room for proc
[1:11:47] procrastination tonight. You know, we're
[1:11:49] not going to get healed tomorrow. You
[1:11:50] know, listen. You're not going to get
[1:11:52] delivered tomorrow or next week or next
[1:11:54] year or when convention come in a few
[1:11:56] weeks. Tonight we claiming it. Tonight
[1:11:59] we want to see it. We want to break
[1:12:01] through. Tonight we want to make a
[1:12:03] change. Tonight we want to sacrifice
[1:12:06] tonight. We want to set our hearts
[1:12:08] right. Tonight we want Listen,
[1:12:13] we want to make the change tonight, not
[1:12:17] tomorrow. Amen.
[1:12:21] He said them who rises and comes out
[1:12:24] sees a morning star. You may be seated.
[1:12:26] Rising out of your stoop and sleep in
[1:12:28] the modern world theology and moving
[1:12:30] into the powers of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:12:32] unchanging riches of God spread forth in
[1:12:35] our heart, showing signs and wonders.
[1:12:39] Why? Sure, we rise and give him glory.
[1:12:42] There it is again. We rise and give him
[1:12:45] glory. Give him worship. Give him
[1:12:48] adoration.
[1:12:50] The great morning star. I think about
[1:12:52] that. And then when he comes, then we
[1:12:55] shall see him as he is. Have a body like
[1:12:57] his. Be free from sickness and all guilt
[1:13:00] and be with him forever. Amen. Is that
[1:13:03] your prayer tonight?
[1:13:05] So, so don't get worried when you see
[1:13:07] the darkness. The darkest hour is before
[1:13:09] the light comes. Before morning comes,
[1:13:12] expect it to be dark. So, right now, you
[1:13:14] might be going through a rough time. It
[1:13:16] might be a dark moment in your life and
[1:13:18] you don't know how you're going to make
[1:13:19] it. Guess what? Just hold on a little
[1:13:21] bit. Hold on a little more. Just pray a
[1:13:24] little harder. Just pray a little
[1:13:26] longer. Just pray through there. There's
[1:13:29] light on the other side.
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:42] I just going to skip through because I
[1:13:43] know time is running out.
[1:13:46] I know we read that that scripture and
[1:13:48] we spoke about Lazarus.
[1:13:51] So I I just want you to understand the
[1:13:52] context.
[1:13:55] Sometimes we think it's real dark.
[1:13:57] Remember in the darkest hour that's when
[1:13:59] Jesus comes by. It's the darkest. So not
[1:14:03] when things things not looking too too
[1:14:04] right, you know. No, he he want it bad.
[1:14:07] He he don't want you all right. And I
[1:14:09] feel I could make out, you know, things
[1:14:10] kind of tough, but I going to make it
[1:14:12] through. He not coming. He not showing
[1:14:15] up. He want God. I don't know the next
[1:14:18] step. I don't know how I'm making it
[1:14:21] tonight. I need an act of faith. I need
[1:14:24] a miracle tonight cuz I really don't
[1:14:26] know which way to turn. My back against
[1:14:29] the wall and listen my phone ringing and
[1:14:32] I I don't even know what to do next.
[1:14:35] That is when he shows up strong. That is
[1:14:37] when he can manifest himself and you see
[1:14:39] his attributes. That's why I said listen
[1:14:41] they express best through adversity when
[1:14:44] you can't figure it out when you can't
[1:14:46] make it through that is when he could
[1:14:47] come and say listen you forget I am the
[1:14:49] healer no so all them thing you doing
[1:14:52] you trying to stay fit and well don't
[1:14:54] get me wrong listen get your exercise
[1:14:57] eat well I'm not saying no but I'm
[1:15:00] saying accept the fact that he is the
[1:15:02] answer
[1:15:05] Facebook is not the answer Instagram Tik
[1:15:08] Tok whoever Whatever else you're seeing
[1:15:10] is not the answer. Jesus is still the
[1:15:13] same yesterday, today, and forever. You
[1:15:15] know, they create, listen, they create
[1:15:18] anything that he can fix. He is still in
[1:15:21] charge. He is still the boss.
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:30] I just want to read this, you know,
[1:15:34] just to put it in context. Mary and
[1:15:36] Martha, the the sisters of
[1:15:39] Lazarus. Picture them as a Christian
[1:15:41] family where Ram said, they they left
[1:15:43] the synagogue to believe on Jesus. So
[1:15:47] they were nice, easygoing Christian
[1:15:49] folks, you know, but they left to follow
[1:15:51] Jesus. So they decide to follow
[1:15:54] Jesus. The result of that was that they
[1:15:58] were excommunicated from the church.
[1:16:01] So you're no longer accepted in the
[1:16:02] church because you decide to follow a
[1:16:05] heretic. You decide to follow a rogue
[1:16:07] fella. He he fighting against the
[1:16:09] church. So we don't want to hear you.
[1:16:13] But as it
[1:16:15] stands, he is the same one who they
[1:16:18] called upon for their brother to be
[1:16:21] healed when he was sick.
[1:16:25] And I'm just skipping through and he
[1:16:27] said he refused to come and we read it
[1:16:29] in the scripture. So we know he he
[1:16:31] delayed his his coming. Yeah. And they
[1:16:34] say they sent a second time and he
[1:16:35] refused to come the second time. So
[1:16:37] message after message they send him an
[1:16:39] email, send him a text. They put a TV ad
[1:16:42] Jesus wanted put it on be looking for
[1:16:45] Jesus. Somebody find him get him
[1:16:47] quickly. But you know what they say? Oh
[1:16:50] how dark the hour was then. Yes. Finally
[1:16:54] the midnight hour came struck and he
[1:16:57] died. Yes. They put him in the grave. He
[1:16:59] was there four days. Not one day, not
[1:17:02] two, three, but four. They say
[1:17:04] corruption had already set in his body.
[1:17:06] Skin worms were in him. Bugs from the
[1:17:09] ground were crawling into his flesh. The
[1:17:11] darkest hour they had ever seen. And
[1:17:14] guess what? It was at that time that
[1:17:17] Jesus came by. Just at that dark hour. I
[1:17:21] say that because this is one of the
[1:17:23] greatest most most expressive
[1:17:26] illustrations of death in the Bible.
[1:17:30] So if you think your scenario bad,
[1:17:32] measure it up. Go in John 11. Write that
[1:17:34] scripture down. John 11. So when you
[1:17:36] wake up in the morning, say, "Oh God, my
[1:17:38] foot hurting me." Read John 11. Dead for
[1:17:41] 4 days.
[1:17:46] Hallelujah. When you feel that things
[1:17:48] low, read John 11.
[1:17:51] 4 days. If you're not dead for 4 days
[1:17:54] yet, hold on a little bit. Hallelujah.
[1:17:59] Because we know, he he proved that he
[1:18:02] could bring you back after 4 days. He
[1:18:05] proved that he could resurrect you after
[1:18:06] 4 days. So if you reach 4 days yet,
[1:18:10] don't worry about it. It's it's going to
[1:18:13] be all right.
[1:18:16] You see, that's just the way that Jesus
[1:18:18] is. That's just the way that he operates
[1:18:21] in a message bird pins.
[1:18:25] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:18:28] I don't mean to keep you too long.
[1:18:33] Hallelujah. In paragraph 66, he talk
[1:18:36] about the lily.
[1:18:38] And I don't know how many of you
[1:18:39] familiar with the the the the flower
[1:18:41] lily. He say, consider how it grows,
[1:18:44] toils. It has to bring itself up. This
[1:18:47] little pond lily, look where it come
[1:18:49] through. Dirt, muck, mud, muddy waters,
[1:18:52] dirty waters. Amen. It pressed its way
[1:18:55] through all of that.
[1:18:58] Listen. So the lies, the halftruths, the
[1:19:00] innuendos, the rumors, the somebody
[1:19:02] don't like you and they don't like your
[1:19:04] tie and the way you cut your hair and
[1:19:06] the color you're dressed today. Press
[1:19:08] past all that. Del push past all that.
[1:19:11] You shake your hand and the usher put
[1:19:13] you in the wrong seat. Press past all
[1:19:15] that. push past all that.
[1:19:19] This little gem of life working itself
[1:19:20] from the bottom of the pond where the
[1:19:22] frogs and the little things are at then
[1:19:24] bring itself up through all that. But
[1:19:27] when it gets
[1:19:29] at the top, when it gets in the presence
[1:19:32] of the sun, you see when the sunlight
[1:19:35] could touch it cuz all the time it
[1:19:37] reaching out from underneath, but when
[1:19:38] the sunlight could touch it, you know
[1:19:40] what happens? It goes through a process
[1:19:43] of birth. They say it's born. The little
[1:19:46] seed bursts open into life. It cannot do
[1:19:49] that until it goes through all of the
[1:19:51] processes. You know, it reminds me of
[1:19:54] the caterpillar turning into a
[1:19:55] butterfly. I could only imagine the
[1:19:57] caterpillar winding up in this cocoon.
[1:20:01] It sure must feel dark. It might be
[1:20:02] restrictive. It might feel like you're
[1:20:04] wrapped up and you're tied up and I
[1:20:06] don't even know how to get out of here.
[1:20:08] But you know what? That's the process.
[1:20:09] We can't fight the process. You know if
[1:20:11] you cut it out and you help it, you kill
[1:20:13] it. It come out deformed, it could never
[1:20:15] fly. If you decide, oh gosh, I feel
[1:20:19] sorry for it. I I feel it going through
[1:20:22] so much, it will never work because that
[1:20:25] is God provided way for you to go
[1:20:27] through certain birth pains for you to
[1:20:29] go through certain trials. So listen,
[1:20:33] your trials different to mine. He know
[1:20:35] how to test you. He know how to to push
[1:20:37] you through. I say some through the
[1:20:40] water. Some through the fire, some
[1:20:43] through the flood, all through the blood
[1:20:45] because he knows what you need to
[1:20:48] perfect you to make you the kind of son
[1:20:50] and daughter that he wants you to be.
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:20:56] He say it's a beautiful life when it
[1:20:58] gets in the presence of that which is
[1:21:01] drawing it up, which is the son. And I
[1:21:03] think it's a beautiful type of the
[1:21:05] Christian life. He said, "When something
[1:21:08] is drawing you out of the world until
[1:21:10] one day you're born right into its
[1:21:12] presence by the Holy Spirit." How
[1:21:14] beautiful. If you try to help it, you
[1:21:17] kill it. Like a little chicken when it's
[1:21:19] being born. You try to help it, you kill
[1:21:22] it. If you ever notice one of those
[1:21:24] little fellas right on top of his little
[1:21:26] beak or any bird that's born from an
[1:21:28] egg, it's got it's maturing. This old
[1:21:31] eggshell, the old inner parts of the egg
[1:21:34] has to rot away. It has to fall off. You
[1:21:37] can't break it. You can't you listen,
[1:21:38] you can't extract the party from a young
[1:21:40] person. You know, you can't extract the
[1:21:41] Tik Tok and Instagram and Facebook and
[1:21:43] whatever else you know. You can't do
[1:21:44] that yourself. You know, they have to go
[1:21:46] through a process too. You know, God has
[1:21:49] to pull them through the process. And in
[1:21:51] this case, they say the the chicken or
[1:21:53] the bird, whatever coming through, have
[1:21:55] to pip its way out. He said we call it
[1:21:57] pipping its way out down in Kentucky
[1:21:59] where I come from. pipping his way out.
[1:22:01] They have never found a better way. See
[1:22:04] why? It's God's provided way. You try to
[1:22:07] help him, you'll kill him. Pick the
[1:22:09] shell off, he'll die. See, he's got to
[1:22:12] labor, strain, break forth. That's the
[1:22:15] way a Christian has to do it. It ain't
[1:22:18] somebody just shaking your hand, taking
[1:22:20] you in, got to lay there until you die,
[1:22:23] rot, and are born into the kingdom of
[1:22:26] God. It's his provided way. It's God's
[1:22:30] provided way. You don't go in by a book
[1:22:32] or a shake hand and join pump up pull
[1:22:35] down and they come and bring you a
[1:22:36] sandwich and a and a coffee and tell you
[1:22:38] come back. Good service, good seeing
[1:22:40] you. It's not by that. That sounds good
[1:22:42] socialization, good behavior, but it's
[1:22:44] not by that. He has a provided way. You
[1:22:47] simply have to get away from the old
[1:22:49] shell. Notice no better way has ever
[1:22:53] been found.
[1:22:57] Hallelujah. Amen. You see, it's all
[1:23:01] about his glory. It's all about his
[1:23:04] honor. It's all about him. You know,
[1:23:05] when you read the scripture, this is not
[1:23:08] about Lazarus being raised. You know,
[1:23:09] this is not an exercise in raising from
[1:23:11] the dead. This is not a a tutorial in
[1:23:13] how to raise from the dead. This is a
[1:23:15] tutorial or a lesson in how God gets
[1:23:18] maximum glory.
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:26] In a message he breached between the
[1:23:28] seven church ages and the seven
[1:23:32] seals Jesus went to Gethsemane to
[1:23:35] fulfill a purpose. Yes. For a specific
[1:23:38] role. Yes. And in paragraph 174 it says,
[1:23:41] "And there came a voice from one of the
[1:23:43] elders talking about the interaction
[1:23:45] with John.
[1:23:46] standing in the midst of the four beasts
[1:23:48] and all that great host of heaven said
[1:23:50] don't weep John oh my grace of God don't
[1:23:54] be brokenhearted John don't weep for the
[1:23:57] lion of the tribe of Judah the root and
[1:23:59] offspring from David he has prevailed
[1:24:02] prevail means wrestle with and overcome
[1:24:06] and overcome not to fight prevail is not
[1:24:09] to fight I could fight you you could
[1:24:12] fight me but if I prevail it means I win
[1:24:14] the fight there's no question about it.
[1:24:17] It's not a draw opinion and I think he
[1:24:20] kind of look better the way he executed
[1:24:22] the move. Not that you get the victory.
[1:24:25] You they declared victorious
[1:24:29] because they count down the opposition.
[1:24:31] There's no chance of getting back up.
[1:24:34] They comprehensively defeated. So in
[1:24:37] this case,
[1:24:38] they say at the garden of Gethsemane
[1:24:40] when blood dropped down out of his face,
[1:24:42] he was overcoming. See the lion and the
[1:24:46] root of David has prevailed has
[1:24:47] overcome. Like Jacob the insupplant.
[1:24:51] Remember he was a shyer. He was a he was
[1:24:54] a deceiver. He was a criminal. A
[1:24:56] deceiver. You know he will do what it
[1:24:59] takes because he knew what he wanted. He
[1:25:01] wanted the birthright at all cost. He
[1:25:03] was willing to do what it took to get
[1:25:05] our birthright. Whe whether he had to
[1:25:07] lie, rob, steal, it didn't matter. He
[1:25:09] was doing what he believe it took. But
[1:25:12] guess what? When he got in contact with
[1:25:14] the angel, he held on. And the angel
[1:25:18] tried to pull away, he said, "I'm not
[1:25:20] going to let you go." Hallelujah. If you
[1:25:24] were to leave a a blessing for me, you
[1:25:26] know, I we could negotiate this thing
[1:25:28] out and we could see how it goes because
[1:25:30] I am a businessman and the way my bank
[1:25:34] account set up, I am interested in, you
[1:25:38] know, getting some protection from my
[1:25:40] brother. That is not the way he
[1:25:42] operated. He operated with a level of
[1:25:45] desperation,
[1:25:46] persistent, perseverance. He didn't care
[1:25:49] who saw him. He didn't care how it look.
[1:25:52] Like the woman with the lost coin, she
[1:25:54] he didn't care who talk about him. She
[1:25:56] didn't care who talk about her. They
[1:25:59] were fixed on the goal at hand. He knew
[1:26:01] he needed a change. He couldn't go back
[1:26:04] to his brother as a deceiver. She
[1:26:06] couldn't show up to her husband missing
[1:26:08] a coin. So they took listen critical
[1:26:12] action listen decisive action,
[1:26:15] determination.
[1:26:17] They engaged in war. She cleaned like
[1:26:20] never before. He fought, he held, he
[1:26:24] struggled. He fight until he could
[1:26:26] prevail. And at that point, it says hip
[1:26:29] was out of joint. He had a different
[1:26:31] walk and a different talk, a different
[1:26:34] name because he overcome and got the
[1:26:36] victory.
[1:26:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] Hallelujah. He became a prince.
[1:26:47] He became Israel. Amen. Wonderful. So
[1:26:50] the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:26:52] prevailed. They say, "Don't weep, John.
[1:26:54] For the line of the tribe of Judah, the
[1:26:56] root of David has prevailed. He has
[1:26:59] already overcome. He has done it. It's
[1:27:02] over, John. Oh my." He produced the
[1:27:05] bleach that sends sin along back to the
[1:27:08] greasy hands and with his wisdom that
[1:27:10] defiled it. The human being. Yes. But
[1:27:12] when John turned to look, he saw a lamb.
[1:27:16] What's a difference from a lion? The
[1:27:18] lion had prevailed. I can use that
[1:27:21] there. God hiding in simplicity. Yes,
[1:27:24] sir. He said there's a lion. That's the
[1:27:26] king of the beast. The lion has
[1:27:28] prevailed. The strongest thing that
[1:27:30] there is.
[1:27:36] Amen. Looking for a place to wind down
[1:27:38] now.
[1:27:41] My my my. You love him tonight.
[1:27:52] Hallelujah.
[1:27:54] Just to skip
[1:27:55] through, Moses took God's provided way
[1:27:58] when they were down there in Egypt. how
[1:28:01] they're going to get out. God kept
[1:28:03] hardening Pharaoh's heart, but he said,
[1:28:05] "Now I'm going to make a way of escape."
[1:28:08] You see, if Moses walked down and said,
[1:28:10] "Let my people go."
[1:28:15] Because he wants the opposition. He
[1:28:17] wants adversity because that's when you
[1:28:19] could win. If you don't have a battle,
[1:28:21] you can't be victorious.
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:26] He say plague after plague after plague.
[1:28:28] But the last plague fell was death. Just
[1:28:31] before deliverance,
[1:28:34] notice how it's striking it is today.
[1:28:36] Jesus said there'll be perilous times
[1:28:39] will come. Men's heart would fail. How
[1:28:42] he said there'll be distrust between
[1:28:43] nations. Sea arrowing tidal waves that's
[1:28:46] never been heard of before, bursting
[1:28:48] forth in the seas. How that in all these
[1:28:50] things signs would be coming to pass.
[1:28:53] Just like it was in the day of Noah, it
[1:28:54] would be again. How marvelous. But
[1:28:56] remember, the last plague that fell was
[1:28:59] death. And the last thing, God gave us a
[1:29:02] warning, warning, warning after warning.
[1:29:04] The last thing that's come is death.
[1:29:06] Spiritual death. The churches would be
[1:29:09] dying spiritually. That's right. Amen.
[1:29:12] Amen. Amen. But I'm here to say
[1:29:15] tonight that you can move from darkness
[1:29:17] to freedom.
[1:29:19] Yeah. You know the prophet said, I was
[1:29:22] reading sometime and you know the story
[1:29:24] about the emancipation proclamation when
[1:29:27] the slaves colored brethren and sisters
[1:29:29] in the south when they used to have
[1:29:31] slavery. And when that emancipation
[1:29:33] proclamation was signed, they'd been
[1:29:36] whipped and beat and so forth and been
[1:29:37] slaves. And we know what happened. A
[1:29:40] certain morning, you see that morning
[1:29:41] when they were going free, it was dark.
[1:29:44] It was gloomy. It was dismal. I wasn't
[1:29:47] there. So I don't know if it rained. But
[1:29:49] the young men, the young people went up
[1:29:53] in the darkness up the mountain. The
[1:29:55] older ones stayed behind. The women and
[1:29:57] the weaklings come on down. One's not
[1:30:00] quite so strong, they climb down a
[1:30:02] little further and further. And the
[1:30:04] great big huskys that were able to go
[1:30:06] all the way to the top. They stood there
[1:30:07] before day, before the break of day. And
[1:30:11] they looked and they looked and they
[1:30:12] looked and they looked. They press and
[1:30:14] they push in faith and hope knowing that
[1:30:18] tomorrow at sunrise they'll be free.
[1:30:22] After a while they began to see the
[1:30:24] streaks of the sun rising. It was still
[1:30:27] dark in the valley.
[1:30:30] They related down. One hollowed from the
[1:30:32] top. We are free. The next one hollowed
[1:30:35] down. We are free. All the way down to
[1:30:38] the valley. We are free. The sun's up. I
[1:30:41] could just imagine. and they couldn't
[1:30:43] see it, but they knew it was true. They
[1:30:47] couldn't behold it with their eyes, but
[1:30:49] they knew the promise was true. That
[1:30:52] freedom had come in the midst of
[1:30:54] darkness, no matter how dark it looked
[1:30:56] around them, they knew they were free.
[1:30:59] No matter how dismal and gloomy it
[1:31:01] seemed, they knew freedom was at hand.
[1:31:06] The son of God had raised with healing
[1:31:08] in his wings, and the sun is up. I'm so
[1:31:11] glad for it. Musicians can get ready
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:22] in a message
[1:31:23] shalom. And so it is today. That gross
[1:31:27] darkness is coming upon the people. And
[1:31:29] here we are. God has loted his word to
[1:31:32] be manifested this day. And it's only is
[1:31:34] the only light we have. And God is going
[1:31:36] to let somebody manifest that word.
[1:31:38] Somebody is going to do it. Amen. He
[1:31:40] promised it and he works just exactly
[1:31:43] like he always did by it. He has never
[1:31:46] changed his pattern of work. His
[1:31:48] prophecies what will happen. Then he
[1:31:50] sends somebody down and vindicates that.
[1:31:52] It goes over heads of millions because
[1:31:55] darkness covers the earth at that time.
[1:31:57] And people love darkness better than
[1:31:59] they they they do light cuz darkness has
[1:32:02] a lot of pleasure. I seen a Hollywood
[1:32:04] play not long ago said life begins after
[1:32:06] the sun goes down. That's when death
[1:32:09] begins. All these nightclubs and where
[1:32:11] they think they're living, they're
[1:32:12] dying. God at the beginning separated
[1:32:15] the light from the darkness. He's always
[1:32:17] done that. What does he do? He presses
[1:32:20] that by the coming light. He presses the
[1:32:22] darkness to the other side. And that's
[1:32:24] exactly what's coming to pass now. It's
[1:32:27] just before day. The morning star has
[1:32:29] come out to hail the day. The Holy
[1:32:32] Spirit showing its light. It's coming a
[1:32:34] time when the light and darkness will
[1:32:36] have to be separated one from the other.
[1:32:39] church and its order will take the order
[1:32:42] of the day and Christ and his life word
[1:32:44] promise will go in the rapture. That's
[1:32:46] the only thing that left for him to do.
[1:32:48] It's a day. Today is the dawn of a new
[1:32:51] day for many who are looking for his
[1:32:53] coming. The musicians can play. He He
[1:32:56] carth for you. Hallelujah.
[1:32:59] As we close in a in a message, modern
[1:33:02] events are made clear by prophecy.
[1:33:04] Paragraph 296. Brother, sister, it's a
[1:33:07] scary time. Watch the things that's
[1:33:10] prophesied. Watch the things happen.
[1:33:13] Watch all the prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:33:16] Then we see what all this is about. Is
[1:33:19] not a bunch of of streak of fanaticism.
[1:33:23] It's God confirming his word. Exactly.
[1:33:26] Exactly. The rock is smitten, friends.
[1:33:29] Flee to it as quickly as you can.
[1:33:32] Prophecy is vindicating the day that we
[1:33:34] are living in. May we stand tonight.
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:38] You love the Lord. You love his word.

[1:36:07] Sunshine or
[1:36:12] shadows.
[1:36:15] He car for
[1:36:19] you. Let's just give the Lord a hand of
[1:36:21] praise.
[1:36:23] Amen. Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of
[1:36:27] the
[1:36:29] Lord. Thank you, Jesus. You love him
[1:36:33] tonight.
[1:36:37] Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:40] Amen.
[1:36:42] Hallelujah. May we just bow our heads as
[1:36:44] we get ready to pick up tonight's ti
[1:36:47] offering.
[1:36:49] Oh heavenly father, tonight we pause
[1:36:51] once more Lord picking up your tithes
[1:36:53] and offering Lord. Lord we pray that you

[1:36:56] those who are not in a position to give
[1:36:58] Lord. Lord may it be used for the
[1:37:00] furtherance of your gospel. Guide its
[1:37:02] use in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:37:06] Let's sing that song. I know my Jesus is
[1:37:08] coming in the morning. Amen.
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:15] Oh, I know that Jesus is coming in the
[1:37:20] morning. I know that Jesus is coming
[1:37:25] back for me. Oh, I know. I know. I know
[1:37:30] he's coming in the morning. I know. I

[1:37:53] morning. I know. I know. I know he's

[1:39:15] Hallelujah.
[1:39:17] Amen. Thank you,
[1:39:20] Jesus. Thank you, lamb of God. Amen.
[1:39:24] Let's just bow our heads at this time as
[1:39:27] we close in a word of prayer.
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:32] Oh heavenly father, Lord we demit such a
[1:39:36] privilege to have gathered here tonight
[1:39:38] Lord. Lord we don't want to take it for
[1:39:39] granted Lord. Every minute with you is
[1:39:42] so precious Lord every minute of

[1:39:46] important Lord. Lord it plays such a
[1:39:49] pivotal role in our lives Lord and the
[1:39:52] trajectory of our lives Lord. Lord we

[1:40:00] the righteous is ordered by God. I pray
[1:40:02] tonight, even as we leave this place,
[1:40:04] that you would lead us to our homes and
[1:40:06] various places. That your angels would
[1:40:08] go before us, Lord. Lord, that you'll
[1:40:11] part away, Lord. That you'll make a way
[1:40:12] for us tonight. Lord, that you'll take
[1:40:15] us home safely and you'll bring us back
[1:40:16] into your presence, Lord. Lord, in
[1:40:19] harmony, Lord, in peace, with our praise
[1:40:21] in our lips, with our worship in our
[1:40:23] hearts, Lord, that we could lift you up,
[1:40:25] Lord, and we could testify of your
[1:40:26] goodness day after day, Lord. Lord, as
[1:40:30] we leave, I pray that you would bless
[1:40:32] everyone that came out in person, Lord,
[1:40:34] those that are connected live, Lord.
[1:40:36] Lord, I pray that you continue to do
[1:40:38] such a marvelous work with them. In
