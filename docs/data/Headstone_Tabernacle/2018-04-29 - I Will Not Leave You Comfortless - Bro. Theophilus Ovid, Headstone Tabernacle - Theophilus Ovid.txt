got so kind of people said it doesn't need me but this way waffle on for me days and Wilfred itself when you go you identify with the naam because the lamb was taken as a sin offering for you so we had to put your hand on the lamb I when the priest kill it and the life leave it you know is you were supposed to be killed but the lamb took your place so you feel like 10 t5 it was a serious thing once a year the high priest had to go in and Israel under tension biting their nails the want to know if God forgive them now remember it was no joke eating it was no text on scripture in that sense honor it was Pella fire by night when we will look up the CFI all day they no money put that up there so that was a shaken thing in the daytime to see a cloud hanging over the camp then Isaac God of

John the one that to see the Dove come on and remain notice what he said not that dove come on doctors come on all kind of people but let the dust come and remain that the master stayed here that's the one who is the Messiah that does not just coming upon you the Dove is upon you this morning but is that going to remain on your behavior and action and attitude will determine whether that doll remain or fly away or give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] I'm still on the prayer oh thank you all right so photobomb says he said no that's our purpose your father that's my only objective that I have is to try to live before you and to get your word and speak it back to a man and woman not to be a different person but to try to honor him who give me life granted Lord and my lord as the light travels from the bleed the pollen into the shock into the green while they are passing through this morning if there is some life that goes into the green has leaned back in that stock bring it out to the Lord and made follow the moving of the green for we ask it in Jesus name so you want to know you're not a stalk another shock you're not a flower but praise God you're part of the green of God isn't that right praise God and bar Obama was speaking about David okay let's back up trying to do God a service ought to be his will God is suffering we want to understand that the people that they are wondering why we can't have a Reviver do you believe God is suffering the Bible speaks this way let God be suffering great speak to a little nitwit ask to say a little nobody let his spirit fall into the city and man can't go to work and woman can't wash dishes the maid can't make the bed screaming and crying with her hands up there in the air that's a revival ain't no will of God [Applause] you see I was gonna go abroad monk I go to work women can wash the dishes meat chemical there their discriminant cry with the hands up in the air that is a revival then the will of God you want a revival that's what you want to be fighting for that is what you want to be present for we're not talking about going to church anybody could do that thousands of people in the church this morning but they are not revived thousands of people going to church this morning but then again spired thousand the village this morning but there is no burden there's no burden of God there's no burden faced were to be sewn still doing the work revival the people could get off their ships with a torn ass horn and they'd come and see a policeman swinging his club around on our own Ida and Swiss Lynne they say my good man could you tell me where the referee rival is you say yes sir you're starting in the middle of it because the Welsh revival is it me or glory that God or was that Englishman revival inside of him you must stand in the middle of it but that's what everyone are you ought to be opposed [Applause] yeah and come here just to get charged up you're coming to be a powerhouse when you leave earlier power I want to pray for the sick power the Casso devil's power to raise the dead power to overcome power to forgive volatile victory what a run endeavours and cast them out power way and stand in the street the devil said get out who is coming Oh glory to God you thought about that church on the match my that is sovereign that's what God does he alone has a right to sell a revival not get the mechanics together it is a pray for quarters and the dynamics oh man when the gospel the messages when you see the messages are nothing else matters the rest is just filler material you have to see the vision when you see it no man could fool you look bloody Couture up it's like an open vision open up to you you know what you're looking for praise God Jesus in His resurrection ministry appear to his disciples in a private ministry to his elect it was not among this among that among the other everybody wasn't seeing him caught my god I feel like shouting praise God hallelujah hallelujah give the Lord a show give the Lord a show that resurrection ministry wasn't for everybody [Applause] you may be seasoned because Jesus was gone in seed on the resurrection to them so watch before they had faith but when they raised from the dead was a different kind of faith it was a resurrection fate now they know this man that we believe in he is not dead he's rarely a life now he's not feeding the multitude and raising the dead he's not doing that he's come to tell these guys who they are he come to listen he come to teach them and positionally place them into what they supposed to receive how they're supposed to receive it and they knew exactly what they were supposed to receive so when he finished with him open it understanding and open the scriptures they were properly empowered by vision marry all of them all the brethren they had revelation so they returned to Jerusalem with great joy they had you know pastor they can enjoy their Dinos pressure to give them joy Danny no news that you can enjoy the revelation of what they're both in receive of the dynamics that give them the joy of the Lord which was the strength human be season or glory of course they were frightened of course they are afraid of the Jew rumors of course the gods were shocked as a human being but they were waiting on my promise one may pass to the pasta still waitin they could move because they had revelation when your revelation your camera's not even a delicate move you promised a job couldn't love hairs on God but a devil could move him when you come out yes I'm God don't ever move your flesh out in the house [Applause] listen listen maybe see I have no doubts in my mind the rain is gonna fall fire gonna fall power in the fall the prophecy spoke it look what he could stop it if I dead in the morning it was still for I not controlling that he said I will restore all the years can't a woman the caterpillar and the locust you maybe Caesar this restoration is different because a tank on caterpillar eat number three don't say eat eat eat your finish they say yes it has no more to eat they say good if I eat it all not empty break already they say I restore this one the ket they could only watch and see which is grow why are we growing we're gonna inflate because in Revelation between and strength between an anointed because authority between and power yes we're gonna in Revelation every service we claim is something more every service we slapping some more demons and somewhat Devils out from our land every service we can in lockdown every step every place you put your foot that is yours we put an offer on signs and wonders and miracles cast no Devers we put in our foot and the Holy Spirit though brundin DeMuth out your house ooh maybe season you don't worry for Solrock ruff your week was rough because the devil didn't want you to get to this spot you struggle to come to church this morning but you

a God that annoyed Joshua says son stand still this is that dog [Applause] Stephen give a trim bonus leaving about tremendous of rotation and permission until tonight we had a scripture of Jesus going and a widowed woman lost her only Son her son was dead and Jesus the Bible said had compassion compassion and he went on touch the power and present the son back to the widow woman and I just discover something about IQ and EQ IQ is what intelligent Kushan to dinner cornet eq's emotional quotient IQ people up in the IQ dive high the brains high they get calculator sort of stuff or whatnot but sometimes happy with high IQ and low EQ low an emotional response low an emotional compassion their self-centered and selfish because having compassion means that you could actually step into somebody's shoes when Berlin was in India and they was worshipping his son and so on and Ellen came up to him and he's blind and he had no shoes on the first thing my mom did was to measure his shoes to see if he could get the money shoes so he are a high EQ to feel for people he said that's why you have to end-to-end so I recognize people with low tech morning it will not even get for that you have no compassion or healing and Jesus a name and next like you say you've heard some kind of machine where you know have to have that compassion there's a woman we talk this story before she was sitting next to a woman and she had a child that was sick and the woman next door just felt let the pray for the baby she they can I prefer a child you know I should pray for the child she had a prayer card she came up to the platform to butter brown and Balram says a woman next to you pray for your child I was healed he said God saw that won't have more compassion than me God saw you had more compassion and put it upon that woman to pray you see what it is being able to put yourself in the person's please on the matter [Applause] Jesus what is widow woman she already lost her husband no she lost her only Son he had compassion not talk did you drink last night woman all this kind of thing people try no and with purposes and I never see just interview people do OB neelanand all he said i feit had me dijo look the lepers God know whatever I was doing all the time he said go on shoes of the priests good thing good thing they're comin silly hands you don't touch my purse he says he said go a choice of the degrees keep on walking brothers keep on walking while they were going directly they were healed simple they never reach the priests one came back hotel now you see where the rest he said your feet meet you who that's why there are people with seeds in them and they are the one going on a baptize but the Holy Ghost because they have something in them you see the rest the money went on and clean to celebrate that they get healed but this one come back to worship this one come back to give God praise this one had something inside of them and I'm telling if you are something inside of you you won't give the right response [Applause] the woman at the well she has something in her that she didn't even know her neighbors didn't even know she was doing a prostitution business and live in all kind of life why because when I'm said listen isn't the profit by vision I believe he said the woman had nobody as the head to feed her family she was living a certain way to magnet children so he went in a three-room he could see that but watch or something beyond that he saw a season that woman that needed to be unfolded that one was at genuine daughter of God we got so we didn't leave us and the people say if you go by what the people say you wouldn't see or feel this way in that way but when jesus what a woman hallelujah honey reveal himself that I have speaking to you a.m. he she was so free she ran she didn't watch you ran come see a man he told me all that I did that she'd come to life that's something spark inside of her and I trusted it something on those back inside of you that you know that somebody and your father dragged inside of here and your mother pulled on you don't want to be in service today but you're struggling because you have no choice you have a choice to serve God or don't serve God hallelujah had a choice I did 17 I gave my heart to the Lord I made a choice and never look back Oh glory to God you are a choice today to break out that's the what I want to present you your break out glowing Agana a choice to want to do the will of God a choice thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is Emma nice father your father / will is not talk will is to be done God's will is his purpose for your life you may be seated under god's will is customized it's not for every is not the same will for you is somebody else whatever it customized for you cuz god no your form and your shape and God no your condition so you know what you have to do or glory to God Amen praise God my lord my lord my lord father help me Jesus oh my so the church had the keys but not really Amen God hold the keys but her mom says that's why after Judas fell that they got somebody to replace Judas on the church by the turning their key they went then choose a man called Matias and that was the elected one I guess the body cast votes symbol metas fine brother but God choose a little hope no sarcastic high-tempered Jew named Paul to be number 12 oh praise the name of the Lord isn't that right that man Paul that was sold to Interpol he wasn't easy you know that tough guy persecuting Christians right so long the five senses you said not that man he can get confused I can change he finished sharp that people like to see shocked it is it is love I give them a shock experts are giving it exposed who shot Lucy but Paul was a seed Oh hallelujah disguise in whatever formulas in the church so you cannot know what God is guys as see does she have to treat people with respect son treat people with dignity on chipping or kindest you don't know what seed is behind me see people like all of them are seeds of God because you don't know but soar became Paul an apostle my prophet he's done right so he's talking about David and David now got excited to bring back the ark and he consult his men and consult the people everything else but Nathan was a profit on each and the revelation didn't come to David derivation come to David but David never consulted neat and isn't that right so then he wasn't or team to do that David been inspired watch and the spirit come and anoint the person and still it's out of the will of God so it's proved we have to be we have to go to God's ways not our way it is God's Way of doing it here is why watch now how close it gets that reason H now between right and wrong remember it will fall on one or the other side did it come down to a honed razor wind if insane and wrong it's got to be every word Oh hallelujah praise God we are not living in a Pentecostal age now we're living in a wood age where everything had to be examined by the word so when you hear me say we check it out man an angel be serious about that men could claim whoever they want to clean let me say bring it on come let me check it out hindi backing out see because this has to be the world so listen sin is rejecting the revealed will of God that's what sinners rejecting the reveals will of God as we say we are born in sin we are sinners so when we sin that was in us do sinasohn that is not the issue with God because we were born in sin shape iniquity we weren't contaminated that is what we will do that's that's normal the the thing that God is feeling to come out of your sin or feeling sakamoto that unbelief when our way is made for you that's the difference your behavior is understandable because of your how you were born but when the word comes to say listen this away forever you know it's clear you need to repent you need to get things in order and workman does truly bless you he read this fast angel to escort you he would help you he would minister to you and you turn that down that is in the truest sense so sin is rejecting the reveal will have God sin in this initial form is to reject the revealed Word of God God's will the will of God when God reveals something on his will to reject that is to blaspheme or to reject God and a church would feel but I never will a church field never will a program feel as long as those who are in charge stay in the center of God's will God will is perfect and everything will fall right into its place if you see in God's will but get out of their will if you're sure the whole program off remember Ekans wedge you have to move out of one place and praise the name of the Lord let's continue from adoption the mystery of Israel now remember no it is not just a little thing it's a mystery God's will is a mystery and each man here we go has to seek out the will of God for his or her yourself so when you see that out then you get a sense of purpose then you don't want to commit suicide you don't want to give up you don't want to let go cut off your info frustrated and I fed up I can't take it no more you will come on that act because you'll connect the Romans 8:28 all things work together for good yeah I wonder what heaven to escape your trials down here Oh God bring heaven quick heaven quick that'd be my mid-90s me7 in a minister's conference and brothers and thing like that I better stop and say you know he was taught we all know so in a millennium and I watching this little brothers and I was astonished that time I'm a daddy vote maybe 18 to 19 years old and I ask myself what is he talking about because it books I read so far has so much promises that has not yet been fulfilled millennium I don't wanna millennium yet come on this interval Philip I remember and schoolteachers tears tears tears teachers used to tell me is it over you said I'm you know Christian and I'm the only one to just go to heaven with him I said no I wanna go to hell - stay here and be a testimony the field we want to escape escape this and escape that no we want to be here to live won't you have to be a witness at genuine witness of God hallelujah so each man have to seek out the will of God for this life no you have to be persistent to achieve something and all men through the ages has been persistent and Noor was persistent after he had from the will of God so when you find a will of God then you could Jam things then you can say devil you can't stop you from going there because this is God's will there's a dog of a balance there's a mountain you will climb it there's a sea you know Shrimant walk through it but nothing in your stop because this is God's will for your life it's cause will that you be in good health [Applause] sickness is not the will of God for your life don't claim it reject it shake it off glory to God go clean diabetes hypertension whatever your family have luckily none of that brings go clean deliverance them freedom go glory to God claim revival praise God hallelujah it's God's will for you to be revived its course will freely be inspired its course will for you to leave different than you came or kill the Lord I'll show them that it's cause will free to lose your temper this log is what we'll be together your anger spasms get temper spasms it's God's will handsome back your husband it's what you will the images started going on just like the scene you see that answer Marcus you you get sexy answer back but God bless you with that and same back yes your husband off god no off he know your fan you know me off but God willing for you to be in your place by being respectful so when you break that norm you call the whole thing known but God has this really husband no because he has to make sure things in order that his prayer not be hindered anyone not going on there this morning I'm not I'm not going there this morning so so God what God want what he what what so God send the Holy Ghost to work among his people to bring his church together to bring a church to a place far beyond the Lutheran far beyond the Methodist family on the Pentecostal into a place of adoption and rapture in Greece oh my oh my oh my you see the Pentecostals they will preach too blessed to be stressed food or whatever I say all the catchphrases and whatnot on different things to bless the distress and the money gospel and and blessings of God and God multiplying on what none area but you think about the characters not for my multiplication cart is not for my blessings and whatnot character happen to be formed by the child of your feet my sufferings this what character is all about my character we're talking about training and so forth this is the real gospel now because what God want his sons manifested and he want to trust his word in his sons with the Pentecostal he was trusting men and men fail and they still feel in today they still fall in big churches big money and itself falling by the wayside but God wanted character and when he went to adopt sons he couldn't adopt no other person yet after William Branham because William Branham had the character of Jesus Christ and he connected to faithful to knowledge and he said these brothers Peter had those things that is why they will add the world because I had the virtues of God in them so George is going to be in you so he took burn a profit now to gather all his scattered word because the world was lost to the ages so before Borton reproduce himself as a seed you have to gather all all the loose ends and bring it together that's what the 70 was all about to reveal the whole mystery of God to produce a perfect seed Oh glory to God I've not seen as seven thunders

spirits though glow and have to break up in anyhow Oh glory that what I feel your night in here but a kindly a field of spirituality your humans spread have to break up anyhow you every season remember when somebody died their spirit breaks up the human spirit and I put it the human spirit that way I have the GCE CXC that way I see you and you're a big shot and you have a big house and a big car money account all that is right there humans with sober I'm talking about a woman with in church and everything else dying and afterwards when a human spirit begin the break of his I'm lost

astronauts have to break the song barrier isn't that right praise God praise God his song burger where all things are possible blessed be the name of the Lord and any man here we go any man that ever lives for God will have to go beyond the five senses he will have to go on have to go beyond education and achieve a 1-month be able to achieve and believe God and break everything and later side and sweep unto the heaven o blessed be the name of the Lord skip down praise God man conquers ten nine eight backwards but God have one two three four five six seven zero seven two changes God Kong is different and then is come down to the grid orbit in time to zero our the countdown seven is God's perfect number and now he's given us a correct condom his Kong dong is not 10 but seven and we have just come true seven churches and we find in Revelation the seventh one is a kong-kong that's visible the first one is Ephesus second number is murder then put almost i tire of fifty service since val adelphia seven loud isa the last stage age and then it's zero time for the church to leave all praise be to Jesus thank you Lord know they were God's small g.o.d and Men if you become born in a your family you are son and part of your father and when sin came in we found out that man caused the chasm and the blood of bulls and goats covered but did not remit until the rich bleached under it until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and brick completed pieces when it got back to Satan he wastes his time of eternal inhalation no I believe here we go that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of Jesus it's like dropping a blood of black ink in a bunch of Clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plumb back the way it comes from and that's the way the blood of Jesus does that sets a man across the chasm again as a son of God Oh glory to God you get what you see in here when your sin is broken up it sets you back as a son of God that's why bronzer you had a sinless with yours bride of Jesus Christ because the blood of Jesus breaks up that thing towards sin [Applause] and frees you from the prison of the fall from the prison of salvation from that and bring you back into glorious sonship that you have access to the Father hope with the Lord a show when Adam fell angels was God in the access angel was got in the Tree of Life but no the Prophet said engine up driving the sons back to have access Oh glory to God let me finish this off here watch then a man sets across this chasm again a son of God then he becomes watch the creative power of God is in him and at least whenever God can command it to be done it will be done and we get back and when Moses here we go under the blood of bulls when he met that light that pillar of fire in the burning bush he stood there on the commission go ahead give him and he was a prophet and when the world Lord came to him he spoke and even things were created by the word know if it will do that under the blood of bulls what about the blood of Jesus not only covered but remit this all together you stand in the presence of God as a redeemed son or glory no God we see the churches far beyond this planet of little you can live higher than that you can be better than that you cannot do better [Applause] what am i said 'mom but I have sophiana so don't think I'm trying to escape and go home I have stuff here we could spend two more was it I always have stuff I'm a loaded all right we try to make all witnesses excuses we want to tell how big we are how great we are so that is why some people kinda laugh at they oneself there is to embarrass I like when you can laugh at yourself if you can't laugh at yourself you have a problem no I'm sorry I don't mean to offend anybody laugh at me system laughing we are human Oh mine is the grace of God we are here and we are grateful to God amen so watch we want to tell how big we are how great we are I think that's one of the things that I go out give me this text for was to get that out of our mind these little things that we do and that is what we come to church for is the final way of forges and the things that we might better ourselves fine if we come to church for any other purpose I'm afraid we won't get too much I'm afraid you won't get too much coming to church we come to find our weaknesses final bad places whole Co little BR and put our trust and somewhere that strong there's so many of us like a testify or like the thing that we are insufficient and therefore we make this an excuse I have no education I have no ability unable to do this if you key that up to do that way keep going like that then you'll won't amount anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses God uses that's everything to tackle the job wait he waits for us to get to that condition so he can use us so what have a way of Sandler's true stuff two strippers and stripping us I call it a kink or brick in your human spirit - given we forgot to break inside of you because in your human spirit you are strong God made you that way you could achieve you could do a switch stuff without God so forgot to come in something else to kind of get messed up tripped up laptop whatever it is and in that messed up thing where you get broken I am broken in that way God could actually come in and do something for you then you know oh my it's God this is not me no more praise God is the Lord Oh hallelujah we find the excuses I can't do this I'm insufficient I can't do that that's the reason he chooses us because we are in that condition I know that sounds strange but we find out as we read in that weaknesses and rejections we find that those people are the weakest and rejected by the outside world is God heroes that's conquer that's why brother man says Samson wasn't this big muscular man that popped up in the gym he was a little freaking fella it's prickly guy so that's it what make it more supernatural how come a small guy with all the big muscle impression on fellas when they pump up the elevators Uzi so surely must resolve they do how do pump up and I'm not sure in his out Samson had none to show go he wasn't pop up but the state would come upon him and this spirit is strong so we're not on the more you know that's why it's not you're you're weak and that that you know is you need the spirit I want to speak up on you Hannah weak talk or glory to God the cast Daniel them Lions then lion hungry lions if that lands just get fed under they ignore human lunch he's hungry land and hungry lion they can handle fire so fire was a wrong Daniel he said what was inside and came out so fire was he was fire protective lion is afraid of fire trying to go hungry is this matter than that keep your hunger at bay brother Hogue Lord is inspire here the cab bites not mine fire is here or glory of God these guys decide the five senses and if you have to get anywhere with God you have to define your feelings your senses your emotions oh poor Enoch God hallelujah glory glory man praise God so there was a Methodist brother three of them come to this church they said to me Nadal go brother Branham we just received the Holy Ghost no do we see gifts for the ministry I said don't do it let it alone he's telling me I read a certain brother told us that we after we see the Holy Ghost we just see gifts he's ambach and I said become a stuffed shirt if you notice it's always those who trying to get away from it is who God uses as long as a man wants to do something and thinks he got enough ability can do the job over God can't use that man don't see nothing God's cutting me for you he give it to you oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah now we take the weakened son rejected practi every hero of God in the front line having that have a person a president rejected opposing the thought he was insufficient a person who had no ability then that's supposing just in good shape for God to stop using them then they feel like they cut they have nothing anyone all right so just so watch when we are insufficient ourselves then we subject to yield to go out spirit as long as we think we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to God and he does it so then it was a strength we will feel but if we give ourselves to God then God cannot feel Oh glory to God hallelujah there's the power I wanna get to our clothes the important thing one of the important things we must master and especially you young preachers lead members alike there's one thing we have got to master if we expect the fulfill God's design our life is the master a sort of human ability if we ever get to a spot we think we can do it with our own intelligence own abilities we've got the master in such a way that we can get rid of the thing later side so go I can use us and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we cannot you make we got to make a complete surrender that come to God you've got the surrender to him body soul and spirit everything you are could be Stan oh praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah oh Jesus oh oh thank you Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence tonight and I pray that the Holy Spirit will take the words I was preached and grieve it in the

look like it's all washed up then God will raise a standard like a flood the Spirit will raise a standard and I believe that we are in the standard raising time when it will not be your efforts it would not be your ability but will be God Himself raising the standard by taking the same word that we have had for all of these years and making it more positive making it more present answers we never saw it that way before we never felt about it that way before but all of a sudden is more positive it has come alive than us we have read it before word it has a new meaning to us we have seen

be a baptism after today's service as a Sharon Lewis Boyd where's she at god bless you she's gonna be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ after the service so we rejoice with that very important our next Sunday we'll have two services we encourage you to make it'll be a special two services come under great expectations and we are rapidly closing in on the convention friends this is the end of April we just have two months May June and the convention is at hand just a reminder of two things one is we continue to solicit your support for the convention and also very important this year will be different we are looking to have seven services for this convention so on Friday there'll actually be three services on Friday so we want to encourage you to make every effort if you need to apply for your vacation now we advise you to do so but we do not want you to miss the blessing and the opportunity as believers we'll be flying in from far and wide to be here for this great Jubilee revival and I believe in my heart friends that we don't have much time left I don't know how you feel but I really don't believe we have much time left overnight the world will change overnight you know and in looking at the news and recent developments we see North Korea and South Korea coming together and having meetings and I said you know the world is rapidly getting into place where the kings of the earth would make peace and they'll come into the World Order and the World Council of Churches love everybody peace with everybody and and everybody will come together and then the world will unite against Israel and that's the last battle that has to come everything is already coming into place with that great battle but before that can unfold the bride has to be caught up in a rapture we are not supposed to be witnesses of that great battle we are supposed to be gone before that great battle so the world is moving things into position news is following it and but that's not our sign our sign is the word and our sign is a vindicated prophet that walk this earth that brought a message of life truth and clarity and don't let the devil your bills your problems your commitments your education your studies it doesn't matter it's all key to go to school and study and get qualified but don't miss the purpose the great purpose in God that he placed you here to prove to the devil that you will not be like Eve you will not be distracted you will not be deceived but we are brought to such a time as this to give the devil a knockout punch before we leave here I always believe we're not gonna leave who glad I made it that's not gonna be your testimony I'm gonna leave knowing I put dismissed in the devil's face because I'm a son of God and for every person who was sick defeated oppressed we will take that back and way to warn every demon on every Philistine on every Hittite champion side whatever it is that's my promise that's your promise that's your testimony can the church same in Oh hallelujah one of these things we try to close out and have another surface I'm warming up get ready for it it's going to happen because one day we're gonna break from time is eternity and the bank will look for your mortgage payment but you'll be gone they could take the mortgage and the house but we'll be gone and the doctor will look for you for your regular appointment but you won't be there because you would have been changed from water to immortality no more pills no more doctor's visit no more high blood pressure normal low blood pressure but you'll be in the image of God sons and daughters of God restored back to fellowship with God and the church amen can we get a shout of praise can we give God a shout of praise no more sickness no more sadness no more depression no more frustration no more sins no more temptation you may be seated [Applause] closing announcements we close another little different today Redis even I let somebody say this week God will test every claim that you made so when you say I'm a Christian he has to tested because a lot of stalkers out there so when you say I'm a believer he has a right to test it to test how much you believe so he draws something your way to see if your declaration will be backed up by your actions somebody help me this morning you say you got in the rapture heels just stuff your way the test to see if your declaration lines up with your testimony so the sufferings of this time I'm not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us there's a coming glory that is whatever reveal in you there's a glory over your head a glory over your house a glory for your life a glory will be revealed in you [Applause] we're still closing when I can't wait for the dealer we don't have to close no more oh god help us you may be seated I'll leave one one last note with you the Bible said that Jesus died for the propitiation and that word predation has a double meaning [Music] it means to restore but they're two sides of it if Gideon lends me a glass bowl and I go with the ball and the ball breaks I could choose to buy back the ball and return it to him but that only restores the ball many times when stuff happens not only the ball was damaged but if it was a special ball to him the relationship could have also been damaged because the ball is a special ball so even though I give him back the ball the relationship we had before it broke needs to be restored also so when Jesus died he didn't just try to clean up your sins and to bring back the pieces of your life the relationship that you were born to have by his blood by his blood he destroyed your family he destroyed your house here is sodium fellowship he was told you access to the spiritual things of God give the Lord a shout of praise Mira Lord bless you God rejoice in this week knowing you are born to put your foot on the devil's neck give the Lord a shout of praise you may be seated us as deacons hallelujah we saw the Living God [Applause] [Music] rusty Kelly maybe seasons I will praise [Music] we'll bring I know that through the trials our bracelet wanna say like you grace that heaven ours I can't repay like to say that I from the bottom of my heart I sweetie us for grace that yeah to say you've been Allah bless you [Music]
