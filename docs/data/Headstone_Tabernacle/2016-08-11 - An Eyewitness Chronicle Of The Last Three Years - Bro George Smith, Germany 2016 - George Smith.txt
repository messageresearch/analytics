do it again tell your brother I love you I appreciate you good to be here with you [Music] Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah Howen you may be [Music] seated I don't know why because I think for a reason brother Sigma has asked me uh to greet you again and um of course we have to leave today unfortunately because we have our own family Camp from tomorrow and uh I have to be at the post of Duty so I do not sleep away but uh I have to go yeah so it was a great time to be together with all of you we all want to be inture amen amen amen amen we all want to please him amen I think we all want to do right amen and I think we all have to learn a lot amen amen amen because we are disciples disciples have to learn you know I am one of the Elder Minister not comparing myself of his brother Ed and different other ones they are in the age more than myself but I consider myself also as one of a long time when I think about my life we we got converted in the year uh I got converted in the year 62 uh I uh I started preaching from the from the year 67 amen so we know a lot amen we are we are alltimers alltimers we have faced a lot of things doctrines move of doctrines and different things it's also good everything is good Hallelujah everything is behind every move is God Amen so we are grateful and we love one another I believe we I believe person also that we need to have to have brotherly kindness and the prophet said in the message I think stage of the perfect man try to understand what he believes amen only to try and hope that one day God is also him bringing in amen amen this is brotherly kindness hoping one day I want to go with you to heaven amen that's my desire not without you with you amen hallelujah and I think this is when we have such a gathering very much important to to have patience for one another to T for one another sorry my English sometimes a little bit limited but we have to T to wait I do believe God will not lose one of his children not one Hallelujah not one amen amen and all I also believe that God has a way to bring his people in because the prophet said your heart will pull you in in your heart is by elction a seed a predestinated seed and this seed is pulling you into Christ Jesus Hallelujah the prophet said not by force forcing somebody is Babylon so we do not believe in forcing I believe in grace I believe in election I believe something deep in the Deep on inside of the inside something is pulling you Hallelujah to come closer to him to come into Christ to find your position Hallelujah something deep in the inside of your inside Hallelujah so we have appreciate the great work brother Sigma has done and I love him and he's a great man of God Amen Hallelujah you need what he did I believe it this is faith in action you know he has expressed something and this is for me also we have to appreciate very much what a person like he his small group when I say small church not to many people like he said this his own words have arranged those meetings may God bless them all you know myself we are friends and the friend will love all the time amen hallelujah so we have love and appreciate one another all the time and this is a friend amen blessed be the name of the Lord so um before brother George Miss coming I want to say we are very very glad that brother George is Among Us amen the son of law of brother BR Hallelujah I believe we are all unique also brother George is unique and I think we also need to have a greatness we should not press people in a certain Channel we are all different and God want us to be different because he want to receive more than only one flower he want to have a bunch of flowers in worshiping him in adoring him hallelujah hallelujah hallu so give everybody freedom freedom is stay be a free man worship God as God has made you Hallelujah always be a free man Hal Hallelujah nobody can control you God is in control of everything Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen always be a free man hallelujah amen be sincere be honest love the Lord and God will bless you mightily Hallelujah this is very much important amen so we believe personal you know that we had a wonderful time and we appreciate very much brother Ed bisar for the great work for the message the when I met him the message the priority in his life was to bring the message out why because the message is a person the message is Christ himself and I do believe personal that we need to have the message more than ever before this is very much important for our life and what I have seen traveling around the earth I have really seen that we people are getting used to have the message message books are at the file somewhere but you know the message is a love letter is something personal is Christ speaking to his elected ones so we need to dig into the message we have to read the message more than ever before in our life we have to love the message and I think this is very much important otherwise we believe every Doctrine we have to know the message we have to take the message we have to read it again and again because it's Christ speaking to you Hallelujah this is important otherwise we are like from every wind of Doctrine wave the way this direction that direction Believe on God SP to Malachi for and you will be a blessed person Hallelujah so I appreciate the message read it again pray say God speak to me I want to hear your voice speak to me open your will to me Hallelujah and God will speak to you personal and you will understand it's something between you between you and Christ and no one is between it's uniting time it's a marriage amen hallelujah it's a vedding going on hallelujah it's a wonderful time we are living in so the message is not only paper and printing you have to understand for me personal the prophet said one sentence he said the word itself is Spirit in word form this sentence changed me completely I understood this message the word the Bible is Spirit Hallelujah in word form and what we need to do we have to enter into the spirit of the world Hallelujah into the spirit of the world into the spirit of this message amen and then we will have a manifestation of automatically because the holy spirit is nothing else then the spirit of the word the prophet said the spirit of the world will transforms the seed in its kind the spirit of the word not the letter will kill you but the spirit of the world will transform every seed in its kind so when you speak to me about Holy Spirit for me it is the spirit of the world there's only one Spirit no two Spirits one Spirit Hallelujah Christ the holy spirit is the spirit of the world Hallelujah and we should go from the written world into the living world Hallelujah we have to enter from the written world into the spirit of the world Hallelujah and then we have automatically a manifestation our life Hallelujah for me an alltime the message is very very precious I love it so much but we are we are through the message of Mali 4 I mean don't forget it in your life if God not would have sent a prophet where would we have been think about it so respect and honor always a message of this hour appreciate it take it to your heart tell the Lord speak to me find it in the scripture Hallelujah because it's a light for the Bible it's the evening light for our day and you will be positionally placed in your inheritance Hallelujah because we have a wonderful message L the message we should love one another love is sensitive don't hurt one another respect one another honor one another be good about one another live the right kind of life amen Christ is here he's present I feel his present it's very much important don't push the message books aside take it again read it again tell God cry to him speak to me again said I find my place here in the Bible said I find my position as a wife as a husband as a pastor I mean appreciate that God have sent the prophet Hallelujah so you cannot differ spirit and word because I am very grateful that I have went into the spirit of the world I went into the spirit of perfection I went to into the spirit of divine love I went into the spirit of power of God I know it is written but it's also present in spirit form so I love I love to speak about it I believe the message is a person the message is Christ so we have to understand it's not only not only the books on tapes but you cannot go into it without books and tapes you need to have books and tapes and you have to hear it again and again because God want to take you from the letter form into the spirit realon to manifest Supernatural things in your life but it starts with the books it starts with hearing the tapes and then God can move your life and change your life completely and you will be the message of our day one day and you will manifest it because when you enter into the spirit then everything will be changed Hallelujah Let It Be The Name Of The Lord so I love you I respect you there's one Spirit one God one body of course to be born again by water and spirit is also good because you cannot enter into the kingdom of God without the new birth I never forget that the prophet that the first Doctrine Jesus preached was you must be born again then you can understand the kingdom of God we are grateful for all the ministers who have preached I speak now instead of brother zigma I'm his friend I'm now his mouthpiece we have uh really enjoyed your presence you shared it with a sincere heart we respect you a lot everybody wanted to do the best you know but think about there's more there's more in store I mean we have also to see one another to listen to one another to learn I mean because he will reveal himself you know sometimes people have told me it's everything we need to have Grace I said my brother the Bible is telling us when we humble ourself when we live in a humble way before God God will grant us Grace after Grace so what we need is to have a humble heart I mean a humble heart to listen to one another to respect one another to respect the word of God above all and the message God has given amen and God will visit us and visit us and visit visit us and visit us again so all the ministers my appreciation for you for your ministry and think about Brother G is also one of the family of God is also one of the family of God may God bless you and may God bless brother George when he's coming Hallelujah we are very grateful for him and for his ministry amen do you appreciate brother GS amen a servant of God

anybody hungry I mean spiritually okay we're going to have church today this is here for a reason for me and for you I'm just glad to be here and today the message is going to be in two parts we're going to go into part one first so you want to open your Bibles into John chapter 8 thank you musicians get started here Luke chapter 8 I'm sorry Luke chapter 8 and um look at verse one want to thank all of you for coming it wouldn't be Church Without You So Luke chapter 8 verse1 says and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and Village preaching and showing the Glad Tidings of the kingdom of God and the 12 were with him him so we got a little crowd of 13 people right and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called Magdalene out of whom went Seven Devils now we got 14 and Joanna the wife of chusa Herod stward that's 15 and Susanna 16 and many others which ministered unto him of their substance so we got a little group of 20 people going from Village to Village preaching Healing The Sick cooking for the master washing the clothes there were people like you yeah just like you let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your Grace today we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us during this week we thank you Lord that we can be here with health we can tie our own shoes we can take care of ourselves and we have your spirit Lord that brought us in here Lord only you know the sacrifices that each one has made to be here today some have come under great difficulty some come first class some came in the back of the bus but God we're thankful that we can be here together and only you can reward the sacrifice we come here we've studied we've looked into your word and we want to do something we want to say something that would bless everyone but you know the needs so I'll step out of the way and you speak to your people help us now in Jesus name amen you may be seated now scripture records that many women follow Jesus we just got through reading some of them some of them are named and many are not named and we want to thank God that we have a Bible that has details this Bible didn't come just over the internet all of a sudden came under great difficulty and so we're also thankful that God has sent us a restoration Prophet according to the promise of the scripture to restore us back to the original Faith back to the original word and we have a sure word of God sure word of Prophecy this isn't fables this isn't just stories it's the truth now back in the New Testament they didn't have a new testament they had the Old Testament it was the Jewish religion that came around and Jesus said don't go to the Gentiles then later the door opened to us but you see in those times women did not commonly travel with a rabbi rabbi is a religious teacher now in the days of Jesus they had the temple and they had the priests and then thanks to the Romans they demolished it there's no more Temple there's no more priests there's only rabbis and they're in the synagogues which are places of learning and so these people had very strict codes that put a distance a certain distance between men uh between the women and the Jewish leaders so much so that by the time Jesus came along a rabbi was not even allowed to speak to his wife in public you know you're way over there or you're five steps behind me I know it all you shut up uh-huh it comes from way back there it's not right and so these Jewish religious laws were there to ensure moral Purity but guess what the devil's still the devil that's right there's no law is going to take care of that you see and so these Jewish men in general and teachers of the law in particular such as Jesus and the Pharisees were to have as little to do with women in public as possible then Jesus came along aren't you glad he came to your life one day and took care of all your funny ideas and not only did Jesus speak to women in public he dared to take them by the hand ooh he's supposed to be the Son of God and he's touching those women not just the nice little sisters with a long hair and the long dress and some of them had a long tongue but the prostitutes and so he spoke to these women and he encouraged them to follow the truth now I know some of you was up till 12:30 last night I heard you you know what this is this is the attention getter so if I see anybody going to sleep you're going to hear about it now you don't have to scream and jump and carry on just pay attention so there's no indication that Jesus ever discouraged women from being followers and this probably offended a lot of Jews you see and here in the 21st century when God blesses a lady such as our little sister that sang that that hair lip some of you because you didn't get to sing well guess what she's got the gift so when God blesses a lady sometimes in the 21st century oh hey relax God knows what he's doing so what we need is balance that's why this is here see the first thing I check out is the pulpit see if it's in balance just about perfect I've been to churches where the pulpit wasn't in Balance yeah and so I want you to remember that and when you get your little iPad out you can look and see what brother brand says about balance okay so balance is essential it's not an option in the New Testament you're going to find that women listen carefully to his teachings amen they accompanied him on his travels we just read women stood by him at the crucifixion Luke 24 where was the brave disciples where was the guys that cast out all the demons and and and distributed the food and all those great things where's Big Mouth Peter at that time where was he at the crucifixion hiding someplace in the shadows because it looked like it was all over women gave witness to the resurrection and they eventually helped spread the message throughout the Roman Kingdom now John chapter 4 is what you see on the screen behind me and this scene that you see back here is one that brother brandham speaks about on just about every tape that I've ever heard very few tapes he doesn't mention the woman at the well John 4:3 says he left Judea and departed again into Galilee so he's going north you get your bearings straight here and so um verse four and he must needs to go through Samaria why must he needs to go through Samaria because he had a vision that morning or maybe the night before and in this Vision he saw that he was going up a certain Road and he was going to stop at a well now this well today is under the partial roof of a Greek Orthodox Church and um it's Jacob's Well it's still there and so he had to go by that well now he had to get there at a certain time you see the vision had to be correct he couldn't get there when he pleased he couldn't get there in the early morning when it was nice and cool no he had to get there around noon 2: when it's about 40° in the shade uh-huh Celsius and so it's about 50 Mi or 50 km up to the Well from where he was at and he had to go there verse five of CH of John 4 and he cometh to the city of Samaria which is called Saar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being weari of his journey sat on the well and it was about the 6th hour now we can argue from now till sun set to find out what time it is but we had a Vindicated Prophet that told us it was In the Heat of the day so we'll just leave it alone I know people that have sharpened many pencils figuring out that Jesus was born in October what a waste of time a Vindicated prophet toas he was born in April so forget it we don't have to reinvent the wheel do we so he comes to the well he's tired he's hungry now where's the disciples he said now boys it's lunchtime now you go over there at the village and you get some sandwiches and a 3 l Pepsi maybe and and come back so now he's sitting at the well and uh he's sitting there and this woman comes up now In the Heat of the days when the prostitutes came they had segregation it's okay integration has not worked out too good has it segregation you live here I'll live here everything works fine it's still that way over there so he knew all the rules he knew exactly what he was doing and this woman comes up and he says give me a drink because that was part of the vision I don't go to sleep yet this is only part one now The Honorable women came in the early morning or in the evening but the troublemakers those other kind of people They Came In the Heat of the day the disciples were in town buying the the the you know the sandwiches and in verse 99 he saith to the woman of Samaria unto him well first of all of course he asked for a drink and uh then in verse n uh she says how is it that you being a Jew ask of me a drink I'm a a Samaria the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans had segregation okay but Jesus was one who came along to serve as the bridge he came to open a new way that they hadn't figured out yet but it was all through their Bible they just hadn't had no Revelation they knew their Bible by heart without an iPad without a computer but they had no Revelation and so he's opening up a way and everybody was you know uh able to participate and so he's there with this woman now you'll notice it looks like they're dressed very similar um but um brother brand says we have found him in 1954 Jesus Christ came here on the earth and talked to a woman at the well which was a Samaritan and him being a Jews just different in race and he let them know right quick that there was no difference in the races God was seeking those that would worship Him in spirit and in truth so they had segregation okay now verse 10 says here Jesus answered and said if you knew the gift of God and who it is that's sitting here talking to you and said give me a drink you would be asking of him and he would give you living water it's first time she ever heard that phrase Living Water they didn't teach that at her church there's a lot of things you heard on tape that you never heard in the Baptist Church or the Pentecostal church or the manite or wherever you came from but it's God's word you see and so he goes on extending the conversation they're talking about the water and she says well man I'd like to have some of that you know because I'm tired of coming out here at this well and so it goes on and uh the whole time he's talking to her about the water he's Discerning her situation you see and so she responds down here in 15 sir give me this water that I thirst not and either have to come out here to draw the water and then in verse 16 he goes straight to the point go call your husband and come here what's that got to do with the water well we would think nothing but he's God he knows what he's doing you see and so when we consider the the picture here on the wall we see that our sister was probably very beautiful now they the the artist did a nice job she looks very beautiful but somehow they dressed a certain way now obviously she's very well dressed I mean you don't see nothing do yet but the prostitutes had some way that they knew who they were back then today we also know who they are you've been at the mall lately you've been down down the streets you know studart any of these streets my city they're everywhere now the sad part is friends of mine that we have mothers that carry message books they let their girls go out looking like prostitutes that's really sad I'd like to think that some of you don't have mirrors at your house why would you go out in the street looking like that if you had a mirror at your house yeah somebody be sitting here amen you see I was early this morning thinking well Lord everything's been said what am I going to say here and he reminded me there's some things haven't been said oh yes now Christian girls do not go around showing the shape of their beautiful body they save that mystery for their husband so Christian girls don't show off their body I was at a camp not too long ago and I was I was speaking to the to the 1 and under crowd and there's a little girl back there about 13 and she had her legs crossed in a certain way hey hey you put put your dress down her mother must have never told her that well she knows now Christian girls don't show off the shape of their body that's advertising and when you advertised you're going to get the wrong kind of guys if you're unmarried wait for the guy to come knocking at your door you don't have to go out looking for him that's not the way it works now I'm going to say this one time and if you don't understand it we'll have a session outside with you Christian girls don't wear their purse across their chest if you don't understand your mother doesn't understand I'll meet you outside now so this woman here she was a stitute and uh she was very beautiful she had no trouble attracting men but her problem was keeping the man she was thirsting for something and she didn't know how to satisfy that Godly thirst you see nothing else will satisfy only Jesus Christ and so she had had she had had five husbands man can you imagine now we don't know what happened to them maybe they died maybe they moved off to Syria who knows what they did but she just got this other guy the night before and she wasn't too sure about him that's on tape also you know I've been around a few years I've been listening to this tape also can anybody tell me when brother Brandon went to Houston and they took the picture we're going to get into that in a few minutes the man that examined the picture was named George J Lacy right does anybody know what color hair he had what it's red hair now you know not important but you know I've been listening too so anyway she got this guy the night before she wasn't too sure about him verse 17 H the woman answered I have no husband well she thought she'll get this guy you know and he said that's the truth that you have no husband because you had five and the guy you got last night is not your husband you told the truth and at that point she knew she was cornered she was trapped she said sir I believe that you are a prophet now the fact is that um you know from there she went on to declare her you know belief and all the differences you know when he spoke to her telling her these things of her past and all these details she probably got uncomfortable I couldn't tell you how many people have told me Bo I wish I knew William brandom would you like to stand there and have him tell you all you did last week and what you when you cheated that guy over there and would you like that it's not real comfortable you don't want somebody looking through you but but Jesus could look right through her told her all these details and she got uncomfortable and she immediately went on the defense of her ideas of race and religion because the Samaritans were experts on Def fence because right nearby where they're sitting now over there where the where the Jacob's Well is there's not quite that many mountains but there's some hills and nearby where they were where they were sitting is Mount ebal and that's where Moses commanded the people now when you all get into the land over on that mount ebal that's where you're going to put up a a um what do you call it a um Altar and um uh that's where you going to you know sacrifice it was also on Mount ebal in Joshua 8 where Joshua renewed The Covenant but the Samaritans had a little bit different idea they were just a few degrees off you know not entirely wrong just a few degrees and they thought that the other hill mount gasim would be the better place to worship so they built an altar there in 400 BC but 272 years later the Jews destroy that altar adding to the enmity between the two groups okay and so the woman at the well had plenty of ammunition and she didn't mind using it on Jesus but he calmed her down in verse 21 woman believe me the hour comes when you shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the father you guys worship what you don't know we worship uh what we know for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth perfectly balanced right for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him and spirit and in truth you can have a lots of spirit you know the drums are beating the guitars are flying and lots of spirit no truth or you can have all truth and be dead as a door Nowell it's got to be balanced Okay so and the woman said I know the Messiah is coming how did she know the Messiah was coming because when she was a small girl they didn't have Sunday school that wasn't in Advent until 1750 in the Methodist Church but they had uh a Bible class and they still have it over there where that the kids learn what the Bible says the Old Testament fine Bible's Bible so they learn and so she had paid attention in church she had paid attention to what was being said and so she knew the Messiah was coming says here and he'll be called the Christ and when he comes he will tell us all things huh she knew that it was in her head you see she had paid attention and Jesus said I that speak unto thee am he see that's what he's saying right there I that speak unto thee am he remember that picture and so she paid attention there was truth lodged in her memory and she had been on this detour a long time we don't know why how long she was on The Detour as a prostitute but it wasn't the it wasn't an unpardonable sin you know it happened but now she's back here facing Jesus Christ and all she needed was an encounter with the Fountain of Truth she had a correct spirit I mean look look at the painting she had a correct Spirit you know she didn't reject the truth she knew he was telling her the truth her spirit was right she just needed more truth just like you you had a right spirit in the Catholic church or wherever you were you you thought you were worshiping God you needed more truth wow look look what look it says here in Malachi oh wow the Bible's real and here you are today you know so she had representation in heaven she was in the elect seat of God and once she got one drink of that special water it was all over he didn't say go read the church age book he didn't say go listen to 17 tapes one drink of water prophet of God says just take one drink from there you'll never have to hear another sermon on morals how to dress how to act how to conduct yourself amen [Music] but you have to take a drink you have to be responsible for what you're hearing can't just go over and you know you don't you don't get the the uh the gospel by osmosis laying on your Bible you have to read it you have to partake you can go through the grocery store and look at all the labels oh yeah if we put this with this we get the chocolate cake and then we could put the cherries and you can read all that and you can die in the aisle of the grocery store because you didn't partake you must partake your parents brought you here they sent you here they spent money take advantage of what's going on you see but many people don't participate they don't take the responsibility and manifest what they're hearing you see and you see what it is your life speaks much louder than your words we've got all kinds of people in all the languages that can quote and brother brandham said who cares your neighbor doesn't care what brother brandham said they're watching your life they're watching how you're going through this crisis now not too far from where we're sitting down south a little farther there was a man 900 years ago by the name of Francis of aiss you ever hear of him yeah that man in Rome took that name now that man in Rome does anybody know what his mother called him when he was born this is pitiful she called him George yeah that was his name but then when he comes to Rome puts on the white oh I'm important now then he takes on the name of Francis of AIS to be nice but behind him it's not nice so anyway Francis 900 years ago said amongst other things and brother random said he was a gospel preacher so relax Francis said preach always use words when necessary yeah brother brandham came along and repeated the same thing he says live your message so all your neighbors and the people you work with they're watching they're watching they don't care what you say they're watching so be careful so after she participated in this conversation she understood and the woman at the well was turned instantly into a lady a lady with something to tell and she took one drink of the inexhaustible Fountain of Living Water so now she was the woman at the well now she's the lady with the word amen so she came in contact with the author of life and changed her life now we'll go to part two Acts chapter 1 this will be a message you won't forget today or for a long time Acts chapter 1 and verse 6 says when therefore they were come together they asked of him saying Lord you got to get the picture this is a group of people speaking to the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ they've already SE him they've seen him walk through the wall like no doors come right through the wall over there they've seen him produce cooked fish they've seen all kinds of evidences and um they asked him this this is their big question now they don't know he's within 5 minutes he's going to blast off but they're speaking to an a resurrected Lord and this is their biggest question Lord will thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel that's a political question what stupid you know he said it's not for you guys to know in other words we would say none of your business right it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you should be W shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem over there in Judea over in Samaria all the way to Germany bellarus North Carolina Australia ends of the Earth it's going to go now they might have thought wow we're going to travel they didn't know nothing about travel you know but the fact is he told them that they're going to do this now um it says in verse 9 and when they had when he had spoken these things while they were beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight now in First Corinthians you can find out where that it says that about 500 people saw him you know there at the end and he's telling them to go to Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Ghost well guess what only 24% of that crowd made it to the upper room 76% was the make believer and the unbeliever ah it's not important we'll do it when we please but anyway that's the basis of Our Testimony today I am a witness of something that you you didn't see and I was invited here to give witness to something that I saw that's my story now I'm not an Entertainer I'm only trying to be a faithful witness you see now I'm glad to be in Germany once again I've been here before this is the land of the messenger to the fifth age remember Sardis Revelation 3:1 he was a reformer his name was Martin Luther this was his country he spoke the same language and the Bible he translated the one you're using today he did a good job I want to see him one day he's a good friend of mine I read his letters I read his stuff in one of his letters he says a translator needs a lot of words to reach back and grab from and just for you guys and of course everybody here knows at least two or three languages some of the Americans don't shame shame but there's no such thing as word for word translation we translate the phrase and Martin Luther would tell you that and so we have that Bible today now this is where he comes from by God's grace I've also been to the tomb of brother Paul over in London God's Messenger to the first age I've been to the tomb also of um of course the empty tomb in Jerusalem it's there we'll talk about that a little later um and um for a period of time I was the caretaker of the grave site of William brandham when I lived there I I cut the grass and you know trimmed it up that was my job for a while but in our scripture we don't see anything about an attorney it only says witness Jesus Christ is the only righteous one he's our attorney it doesn't say anything about Judge because nobody qualifies but in the 21st century where we are so smart we have smartphone you see and uh this gets you in trouble sometimes and so what happens is that um we hear the neighbor talking on the phone of course we're only hearing one side of the conversation right we don't know what who she's talking to we don't know what the other guy said we only hear half of the conversation then because we are so smart in the 21st century we uh fill in the blanks make up the rest of the case and we judge the case not even knowing half of the story that happens to Christians so nobody qualifies as a judge and we trust that somebody can learn something from these uh things we're going to say and possibly avoid some of the pitfalls of life I'm the eagle that was born in the Baptist chicken yard yeah very few people were born in the message home and learn to have the family Altar and and do everything right a lot of us were born somewhere El else you see and so um uh we trust that you can see who you are see how God is dealing with you so we'll try to get through this before lunch I promise we'll be out by lunchtime it's okay my parents were uh both Americans they met in Bible School in California and they were married in June of 1944 long time ago and so they had this idea that you know they they felt that God is calling them to be missionaries in Mexico because back then uh there were still and of course even today but but more so then see you see in our world today there's over 6,000 languages that are spoken and there's languages today that still have nothing written down hey wake up get this and so they looked on the map they had the the the stuff and they said well there's this there's this tribe down here in Mexico that has nothing written especially no Bible so they said well I think that's where God's leading us now they didn't know word word of Spanish they were young married people so they go down and they took the truck as far as it would go then they got on horses and they went four days up in the mountains to find this tribe okay and so they're up there and they found the tribe and they they have nothing written they have to you know point to the sky and uh believe that these people are telling them sky in their language and try to write it down whatever it sounds like that's where you start very Elementary and so as happens in newlyweds homes a baby's going to be born so they come out on the horseback come back to the truck well instead of going to Arizona they got on the train and went to Mexico City and that's where their first child was born in late August of 1945 that was me yeah okay so we come back to the mountains and uh I don't know he we were probably there two or three years but my dad was not a patient man see he he was a little bit impatient so to get this language you know to get you got to form a dictionary first you could to have a dictionary a b c that could take some time and then eventually you come over here and you can produce St John in that language that takes 20 years well I'm an eyewitness that he wasn't that of a man so he left that blessing for somebody else and he moved over to the East Coast of Mexico and founded a bible school which is still there today I was just down there last month and saw it so now we're over on the east coast of Mexico and it's time to go into the first grade well I'm the only white guy and all these Mexican kids and I don't know what their mother told them at home you know they went home say hey there's this this white guy in our class today well you see back then we did didn't have pencil sharpeners I know it sounds like stone age but we didn't have pencil sharpener all the kids carried a single-edged razor blade see they put you in jail today for that in my country and so we carried a single-edged razor blade and so when I wasn't looking this kid got a real sharp point on his pencil and he jabbed me in the arm and then when he saw I had red blood then we could be friends okay so that was in the first grade now trying to keep this in order um eventually I was I was the first but eventually there was four more brothers and Five Sisters I was the first of 10 yeah and um we had a lady that helped us in the house and we were only permitted to speak Spanish to her the rest of the Spanish would be outside and we did not know the word discrimination that's from the 20th century okay came later but my mother had this thing about her you you speak Spanish to the Mexican people and you speak English to the english- speaking people keep the languages separate they came pretty handy later and such was the rule that um I remember one time we had a visitor this uh American missionary and he spoke perfect Spanish he learned it you know as an adult spoke perfect Spanish but he was a white guy we wouldn't speak Spanish to him only English to him that was her rules you know and so we kept the languages separate and I'm sure those of you that know two or three languages you know that you have to keep them separate well anyway um we come to um 1955 Easter of of 55 I was 9 years old now I had been on the front row every service you know I was raised in the Baptist Church and so the missionaries kids were always right there on the front row uh every service three times a week or more but finally when I was about 9 years old I realized that Romans 3 was for me also wasn't just for all those Sinners it was for me too all have sinned the Spencer kids the Bisal kids the brandom kids all have sinned Smith kids and come short of the glory of God whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord and be shall be saved so I received Jesus Christ my savior 9 years old I was baptized on Easter Sunday 1955 in the same as a lot of you in the name of the Father the Son [Music] okay so when I finished the elementary school in Spanish that was all Spanish Elementary and at home our mom would teach us you know to read and write and a little bit of English but then when I was 13 years old there was you know several kids at home well they sent me off to Houston to live with the with a Baptist family and go to to seventh grade and so I'm over there with these people and um everything's new and wow all English and they got a cafeteria and it's clean wow this is nice you know and so there were several moves but eventually um in uh let's see in January of 62 as a teenager I had a reconsecration it's one thing when you're a child but then when you get to understand things better then you have a closer Encounter With Jesus Christ becomes more real you see and so then halfway through the 10th grade they sent me to live with my grandfather in Tucson Arizona yeah my mother was from Tucson that's where she was born that's where she died and so uh they sent me to live with my grandfather to go into the last two and a half years of high school well being in Tucson uh then my family moved there also so we we had a house there and um uh I was the guy in high school that had the reputation we're talking about a a school of about 2 200 kids you know and I was the guy that didn't go to the parties I didn't drink didn't smoke and at lunch um instead of talking to these these other kids I would talk to the Mormon kids because the Mormon guys they they had a little more on the ball you know they they talk Bible so we would talk and um so one day this one girl comes up you know at the end of school and she says you know we noticed that you're so picky I suppose there's a word for that for you guys back there but picky means very precise and so um she said but we know exactly the girl for you oh really yeah where is she well she's way over there getting on the bus well the next day they introduced me to the most beautiful lady on the planet Rebecca Branham and so I met her and you know she's beautiful and of course just like you guys hey I was young one time everybody's not here to to be holy you know some of you guys are looking for a wife I don't know what you're looking for and some of you girls you wonder and so um and so the first question is what's your name and then you want to know kind of how old she is cu if she's a little older well you know Adam was a little older than Eve so that doesn't work real good and so um we uh you have to ask her age and well it comes out that her father's a preacher okay I knew a lot of preachers no big deal and it turns out that that God moved these people from way back East with a funny accent right there about a block from my house wow you talk about predestination make a Believer out of you and so so I had to go talk to her dad that was the first step okay got to talk to Dad no problem so I go talk to her dad after school and here's this man in the backyard working with the flowers or something no shirt on I wasn't offended hey we're talking Arizona you know it's hot out there and so um and so and she disappeared Dad this is George you know so she disappears and uh here I'm talking to this man never seen him hey I was a Baptist not everybody in America heard the name brandom okay most of them didn't hear it especially if he wasn't in the Pentecostal church so um uh we're talking a few minutes and I'm expressing to him that you know I like your daughter and I like to know we're a little better and and he's checking me out you know and we're talking and so he gives me permission that I can know her a little better well I'm in high school with her you know we ride the same bus and everything well at that point I had the victory but he had the problem because there were some other guys that knew who he was and they were scared to come over you know they had nice car nice clothes you know but they knew who he was so they were I don't know what they were waiting for but they lost out and so he says sure you can you can get to nowh and so we um uh you know we had the victory okay now at first I knew she had an older brother I thought man this might be a problem now that's another question you guys need to ask you know got an older brother but the older brother was 10 years older than me and he was a skinny kid like me so it wasn't a problem but he had a real nice a real nice brand new red Chevrolet two door oh it was nice and I had a used Ford truck but the man had a Ford station wagon so it was okay you see and um so anyway we we got along and the fact is that when when the when the family moved from Jeffersonville which we'll get into that in a few minutes because there's no hurry um they moved by Vision he didn't take a vote at the church they didn't know how long they're going to be gone so here they've been in this same house from 1948 to 1962 and you know the schools right down there and the churches over there the piano teachers over here everything was you know reasonably normal and all of a sudden in the middle of the 11th grade pick up your stuff and go west well when they go west there's no church there's no friends there's no trees and there's no piano cuz Rebecca was playing the piano every day and so they get out there and uh didn't take her very long to figure out that the lady you know people on the corner had a grand piano cuz she was a piano teacher and and that's the girl that actually introduced us so uh one day brother Brandon was getting his family together to go to supper and he's only got three kids you know so he looks in the back of the St St wagon there's only two children Hey where's Rebecca well she's down at the corner we'll pick her up on the way by so brother ROM stops the car at the corner and as he's going up to the up to the house you know up to knock on the door he hears this music it's not chopan it's not Beethoven it's not down at the cross you know 20 fingers on one piano you know Rebecca liked the bass and the other girl was up at the top so all these and just noise you know and so oh his heart's breaking oh my little girl and he tells about it on tape how that this music H just horrible and so he knocks on the door and they miraculously heard so she comes to the door now he didn't jerk his belt off like we might he didn't scream at her he just said it's time to go okay we go she didn't hear another word about that for two months that's the way he did things and so they were praying the parents were praying and so when he tells the story about this on tape he tells all about the music and everything he says and then she met George and he's a Christian it was the end of the problem really what was I doing I was taking her to the Baptist church every Sunday he was thankful that I would take her to the Baptist Church he came a couple of times or more said amen to the word you see so and so we um we met it was probably somewhere in March and in early June um I went to the first meeting now when I met him he didn't he didn't give me a stack of tapes when we were talking the first time he realized because I I think I he asked me or somehow he found out he knew that I'd already read my Bible all the way through twice you can do it starting today and by next August you've read it all the way through also it works you have to get into the book to know what it's all about like brother guard said and so I'd read my Bible and so here I'm at the first meeting and I uh I'm I'm seeing him preach and I'm seeing the discernment wow this is different we don't do this in the Baptist Church and um so I went home that evening and I was only you know like a block block and a half away from where they they lived and I said said oh Lord this either comes directly from you or it's the greatest deception that ever hit the earth so God revealed to me you know slowly it's the truth you know so brother random traveled a lot he was gone preaching a lot and um uh but when he was at home we could spend some time together he could explain a few things I didn't record any of it you know he would take time to explain he was a real friend and he always enjoyed talking about the scriptures you see and I was always welcome at the their house so I didn't come into the message or learn of the message sitting out there watching him preach I could come in the back door I had to knock you know but I I was welcome and they always had a lot of good orange juice in the refrigerator remember that yeah so you might say well what attracted you to this ministry well God used the girl as the bait you know but what attracted me was here's a man that's actually living the spirit of the scripture I knew the scriptures because I had read the scriptures I of course I didn't stop and analyze at all like we do now but I had read through it and I I caught the spirit of the scripture and here's a man that's living it and his ministry showing it you know and so it all started all the pieces started to fit together and um but it was always two different things there was a relationship with Rebecca and one with her dad so he was living you know and um of course he says you must read your Bible and pray but see that a lot of people don't like that they they want to they want to put on Scorpion and listen to it and fall asleep no read your Bible you know we all have a Bible at home read your Bible now before we go too much farther I want to go into what I call the prophetic Dimension now you might not like that word no it's not on tape neither is computer uh smartphone Facebook a lot of words we use on tape okay but we're in the 21st century and this is what I call the prophetic Dimension and that is that the prophet speaks from eternity brother Bram says he spent more time in this other dimension than he did in this one and he goes back and forth you see and so for example we have Elisha uh and Gesa they're in their little house there one day and uh they got problems and and Elisha says now son go out there and see what's going on outside so Gesa goes and looks out there wow these soldiers everywhere and he comes back shaking oh my Lord we've had it they're going to kill us this is our last day on Earth Elisha didn't smack him he didn't get the belt off no he just put his hand on him said Lord open the young man's eyes now go look again and he goes out wow Angels everywhere what happened here they were there all the time but he could see in the other dimension you see it's very important and there's other places and that's it's a dimension that's faster than this one you know there's many people here that you can't see so in 1950 and you you know some of this story but just pay attention you're going to get some more of the details in 1950 brother bram's preaching in Houston Texas it's a series of of 10 nights and during that time he um uh encountered this Baptist man that thought it was his job on Earth to show that brother Brandon was false and all this is a bunch of nonsense and you guys are being deceived and it was in the newspapers well brother Bosworth was helping brother brandom at the time and so he said um now brother brandom we have to answer this it's in the newspapers we look foolish we got to do something and brother BR says we're not going to spend one whole night on that guy when there's hundreds need praying for So eventually brother Bosworth convinced brother brandom that he could do it very cleanly nothing's nobody's going to get hurt okay so then he told the press and it was in newspapers well now instead of this this place that held 8,000 people they went to the place that held 30,000 people because a lot of people came into town to back up Divine Healing more Believers you know and so they they they they uh have this meeting I think it was the 20th or 21st of January of 1950 and so um brother Brandon's in the hotel he says well you guys have at it I'll be there tomorrow but then the holy spirit says no you must get ready and go to church so he says he comes to church and he disguised himself now I don't know what he did to disguise himself but nobody knew he was there okay we're not going to argue how that happen so he's there with his wife with his brother and four-year-old Rebecca she remembered it very well because when they got into church it's all full and they had to sit up in the balcony way up there and they on the edge like where you guys are sitting and and so he could see what was going on and so he's sitting in church nobody knows he's there and Rebecca's sitting on his lap well that's the first time because in all the other meetings in her four years she looked and saw the other girl sitting with their dad but she her dad was up here she could never sit with her dad now she's sitting with Daddy ah and she was the only child at the time you know so um she's sitting up there with him and the debates going on down here and of course you you've heard the tape many times for brother Brandon relates it because brother BOS says well I have one question for the noble Reverend best the seven compound names of Jehovah the Old Testament can we apply those to Jesus Christ yes or no well let me think here if I say yes that includes Divine Healing can't do that and if I say no then there's no salvation so he's hung you know so they had their little fuss about it and um So eventually brother Bosworth says now I believe brother brandom's in the audience someplace when I see we got 500 people here or less and it's hard to pick somebody out but you take 30,000 be very difficult to see who's who you know and so he says I believe brother Brand's in the audience if he's here he's welcome to come down dismiss the audience because it's it's over you know so brother brand starts to get up and his brother says don't get up you cause a riot it be a bad and his wife said it's okay he knows what he's doing so he gets up and he puts Rebecca in his seat so she could see all the way down and she always said that she remembered seeing the soles of his you know the bottom of his feet of the shoes as he came walking down so he comes walking down to the platform and he says on tape that as he was walking down here 500 ushers made a way for him to get here because see if you had a SP child or if you had a cancer mother or whatever that's where you'd want to be so here's all these people needing prayer and here comes the man of God walking down the aisle but he made it down here okay so he gets down here to the platform and um he says a few words and then he says um I don't have to say anymore he's present now the Baptist had hired these two photographers professional photographers with big cameras to take pictures because horse he was going to win and then these pictures would go on the newspaper and see I won and all that so they're taking these pictures and so when he says he's here and then these guys go home to develop their their film the only picture that came out is this one here now we have people today that have taken the Liberty to say that this is a fake picture I wouldn't want to be in their shoes so the picture was taken and time passes and then um later you know years later Rebecca's listening to the tape and she hears him talk about those 500 ushers that made a way for him to get here and she was up there watching and she had a very good memory and she says to her mom now Mom you were there did you see those 500 ushers mom said honey those weren't ushers those are angels so he was seeing something nobody else saw him maybe somebody saw the light I don't know but most people didn't see the light now he says about this picture he says it's better if you have the picture than if the real thing comes in the room because your eyes can fool you but this is real in another place he's in a he's he's in a service and people are coming through and this lady's got the picture she bought out front and she's in the prayer line and he says well I see you have the picture let's talk about that she wanted to get into conversation to um you know discerner and so um he says I see you have that picture and he says not at home I have a a testimony on my desk about a lady that was in the hospital she was dying and she had this picture on the nightstand beside the bed and as she was praying the light came off of the picture and came over her and she was healed went home it's pretty important in 1958 brother Brandon was coming home uh another he was out in Iowa actually in part of the West he was in a meeting and he had this Vision that one day they're going to put a little uh surveyor marker by his by his Stone entrance and when you see that little that little thing there that means you pick up your stuff and you go west real simple because if you stay you're going to get in a fight with a guy's because see when he bought the property the reason brother Brown bought that property up there where he built his house is because during the flood he was in his little boat out there you know rescuing people and he noticed hey that Hillside is above the water if I ever build a house I'm going to build it up there so he built this house in 1948 and um it was just it was way out of the Town it was out out there and so it just a small Lane but now in 19 uh 58 he has this Vision because soon they're going to widen the road because the city grew out there and they needed a wider road so he saw this Vision he wrote it down he had he had a little book he kept all that stuff written down so he's coming home one day in 1962 from somewhere and he sees the little marker in the in the in the out there by his uh gate hm I think there's something in my book about that so he goes looking through his book there it is huh pick up your stuff and go west so you know the story they had the different visions and dreams and stuff and and he went West okay now when he went West it was January of 1963 now there was an African brother told me once he said you ought to write a book The the last three years well these are some of the details that you won't find in a lot of places so they go west in January of 1963 because it's between the two semesters of school and when he got out west he rented this apartment and like I say it was just a block from my house but I didn't know him then and one of the first things he did was he sent out little cards of invitation come to Jeffersonville March 17 to 24th Seven Seals that's all he knew send out the invitation didn't know anything about it so he sends out the invitation well also so that's pressure number one Seven Seals March 63 pressure number two a friend of his called a preacher friend of his in the world and you know back then he said now brother brandham there last year 1962 there was a robbery in Houston a man was killed and they've blamed these two kids and um uh the boy is nephew to the man that took the picture this one here he said um we would like for you to come to to um to Houston on Monday March the 4th for a prayer meeting because they're up for sentencing and they could get life in prison or they could get death and we'd like for you to come and help pray he says I'll be there and it's right on tape he says if I didn't go and they killed those kids I could never go hunting he said I must go and do what I can okay pressure number two pressure number three since 1947 he was always in Arizona in the spring for the Havalina hunt he was a hunter he was Elijah man of the Wilderness so the Havalina pig is a it's a it's a wild pig and my son still hunts him and everything so that was something brother brand loved to do and he promised these two brothers I'll be there for the hunt in 1963 pressure number three so this stuff is going on besides all the other daily things going on then he showing up and so forth and um so we come down to the end of February of 63 and um he's preparing to go to Houston to pre to pray for the you know have the service on March the 4th there's a tape and when he's telling all these things he says first I went to Houston then I went hunting now I know you're all wondering I've got the picture right here someplace um you're all wondering well what about this picture well no problem that's in Life Magazine right there now National Geographic magazine has paid photographers they're roaming the globe you know Finding nice stuff Life Magazine publishes what they send them and so somebody took this picture and it's dated February 28th brother Brandon was not hunting on February 28th the hunting started on March 1st that year and he went to Houston March 4th and then he went hunting it's on tape I didn't invent it so first thing first of the three things he goes to Houston so they go to Houston they have the service pray for these of course the kids are in jail and they're praying for them now the result of that was that they gave them a life sentence they didn't kill them and they were out in 15 years but brother brandham got a uh certificate he talks about it for saving a life now instead of going on to Jeffersonville taking it easy maybe you know sitting by the pool like might do no he he got in the car that night that Monday night drove all the way back to Tucson 1100 miles the wrong way to keep his word to these two Hunters didn't know what was happening just I kept my word to these two Hunters Billy Paul went on to Jeffersonville to take care of the Tabernacle and get ready for the for the meetings coming up on the 17th of March so brother Ram goes back to Tucson gets his stuff ready they could have got out there by the 6th or early on the 7th of May of March and when he tells the story he says we were sitting around the fire I already had my pig which means he killed it that day which no matter how you cut it could have been the seventh and he said we were around the fire and God was revealing a lot of things about these people's family and I had to walk away because there's so many many things happening the brothers say that while he was at the fire he said the angels have been waiting here for a week for us hm hallah Hallelujah and so then on the 8th of March they're out hunting now when you go hunting as brother Ed and all you Hunters know you go out when you can barely see it's just barely daylight and you're out there you know finding your way planning to come back to meet again at 9 or 10:00 in the morning when it's already getting warm so they're out there he's over here and those other guys are over here and the blast takes place and all these things happen so when he comes back and meets the brothers he says did you guys hear that he never said did you see and there's no pictures of March the 8th okay so he explains a little bit what happened they pick up they go to Jeffersonville he preaches now when he's going in to preach the seals the church has been finished it's been remodeled everything's nice all the people are there he's just had this tremendous experience and so he goes by Billy Paul's office on the way to the pulpit and he says now Billy if you ever prayed for daddy pray now oh I don't have any idea what I'm going to say to these people that's walking by faith he didn't have it all mapped out there's several messages where he just he's invited up he has nothing a man running from the presence of the Lord in in February of 65 he had nothing he opens the Bible got a tremendous message okay so he preaches the seals and two tapes that you need to listen to as soon as possible are the two tapes after the seals in April of 63 in Albuquerque New Mexico uh God in Simplicity and the world falling apart things on there he says nowhere else so time passes and um brother Norman was one of the brothers at the fire well his brother-in-law had a subscription to Life Magazine not everybody had the subscription but the brother-in-law had it so the magazine is dated May 17th well they mail it a few days early so that you have it in your hands by May 17th so brother Norman is over at his house after the 15th of May someday and he sees this magazine he thumbs through it oh wow Arizona mystery looks interesting he takes it home he's got it on his table brother brandom comes by on Sunday and he sees it and real cool that he was he say hey can I borrow that I like to study that so he takes the magazine home home and on the first week of June he mentions it this isn't Fiction it's all on tape and so he mentions this in the first week of June he says yeah somebody took the picture he says I checked the date yeah a couple days before after kind of a vague well friends the fact of it is he's in another dimension on May on March the 8th when he's seeing this nobody took the picture they could have took the picture in 1940 but this is when it happened first I went to Houston then I went hunting just that simple now if you want to argue about it well I don't have time so that's the prophetic Dimension okay so time passes we're in high school and we come up to December of um 63 and you know how it is when when your girlfriend goes away on vacation or something H it's the end of the world and so they're off in Jeffersonville I've never been past the you know State Line Bally and I don't know where Jeffersonville is but um they're gone they're only going be gone 2 weeks but it seemed like 5 years so I was young thin had lots of black hair and uh foolish and so I thumbed a ride with some Believers and showed up for church you know Sunday morning the 29th of December big surprise so wow I'm sitting in church wow this is neat you know and and so so then after the service we're at lunch and brother says now George of course he knew we were you know we were both in choir at the at the school and uh I was the assistant choir director at the Baptist Church so he said now George in the service tonight I'd like for you to sing me the brandom Tabernacle what would I sing here well we're going to have a prayer line tonight H and so I want you to sing then Jesus came well we didn't learn that at the Baptist Church so I we learned it and so sang it that night and uh that was the first time Rebecca played in church he was very proud and he was pleased and so time goes on and we um uh he came out and preached Look Away to Jesus okay so that's 63 we come to May of ' 64 and um Rebecca and I both graduated together from High School and our parents were both sitting together all four of them sitting together out there and very proud day for William brandham he said finally a brandom has graduated because before that they've been very poor and nobody finished high school and so um very few since then to be honest so he was very proud of that well in July of 64 he's over there in there in uh Philadelphia preaching the the great message um uh mighty God unveiled now when you went to church with brother brandom uh in the car with him he got there and church is already going on you know he didn't come for the preliminaries and so it was him and Billy Paul and and Rebecca and her friend Betty four people well Billy Paul who knows he was sitting someplace and uh so there was no seats so they find a seat in the mezzan there was another level and they found the two seats for the girls to sit up there so Rebecca and her friend Betty were sitting up there and so brother brandham comes in well brother Roberts was speaking at the time you know at that particular moment so brother Bram takes a seat beside him there's a long table and so while brother Brand's sitting there he reaches over and he he touches brother Robert's coat you know just barely touches it well then he preaches the message and they're leaving and Rebecca says I saw what you did I saw you touch his coat and he says oh sis that was such a nice fabric it was so nice and he said I looked down I had the the black pants and the brown coat or know some combination that wasn't right and he said I felt so foolish well of course his outfit probably cost $59 and and Robert's probably a thousand you know and uh so the moral of the story is they were both called of God one had to have everything just fine you know he wouldn't wear shirt like I wear he had to be just perfect you know and the other one actually had something to say it didn't matter what he looked like you know he was nice but it didn't have to be perfect well um in another time brother Brandon was preaching and he comes to the end of the service now a lot of times he preached in a big Auditorium like this it wasn't always in a church and the audit the uh the platform was a little higher and he says now I want to show you all what the reason for the success of these Services of course they all thought it was on him he said no and so they had a big curtain like this so they raised the curtain and there was old John Ryan back back there out face down praying he said that's the reason for the success of these meetings now I'm not going to give you all the secrets of the courtship but we were under surveillance okay you can believe that now brother brandham didn't live in a gated community he lived right on a simple Street little bitty car didn't even have a carport didn't have nothing to protect his car it was a rented apartment at the time lived there all of 63 or you know 63 64 65 in this apartment and so he had a telephone and people learned his number and they didn't all call for good reasons you know what color car shall I buy I have a toothache all kinds of things well he was human you got tired of it so he's looking at the phone now those phones back then the the the phone at our house was the the rotary you had dial take forever to dial number well when by 63 when he got there they had the push button but it was still a fixed phone you know wired to the to the wall they didn't have the wireless yet and so he picks up the the telephone he's looking at it well on the bottom there was a wheel that you could turn and if you turned it one way the ringer got louder and if you turned it the other way it's shut off so you could be calling him it sounds like it's ringing but he doesn't hear because the Ringer's off well so we were young just like you guys we like to talk on the phone yeah only lived a block away but you know just what people do and we didn't have these little guys okay there was a time we didn't have cell phones and so um and of course my dad raised in this big family uh he uh he said now look he says the phone is for communication not for visiting unless he needed to visit then it was different yeah he raised 10 kids no rock and roll no drugs no foolishness he said we have a we have a a democracy here I got the vote just like Reverend Spencer right and so um uh so Rebecca says what are we going to do said no problem you set your watch just like mine exactly like mine okay now when it's 7:00 I'm going to di your number I'm going to call you but thanks to your dad the phone's not going to ring but you pick it up I'll be there okay so 7:00 I call hello and it had a long cord so she would take the phone and she would go in the closet and shut the door so we had some privacy you see love conquers all okay so uh another thing that Rebecca told me one time uh wait a minute got got to give you more about the courtship I had this this used Ford truck right it was like 5 years old at the time they didn't have double cab didn't have air conditioning didn't have stereo but it was clean well brother brandham had a Cadillac now he preached against Cadillacs because that was the fine car of the time but the Christian businessmen wanting to you know uh bless some of their people they wanted to give him a new car he said no no no no no this Forge station won's fine and so he um he was gone someplace and brother Argan bright out in California always got his new car about October you know and so when he got his new 56 Cadillac he gave the keys to the 55 Cadillac to these two guys he said now you drive this thing to over there Jeffersonville this address you park it you give the keys you don't talk to nobody you just give the keys and leave okay so they take it over there and leave it well brother random comes home wow check out this car well it's like from here to the wall you it's just huge car big four-door you know had a a V8 engine with two four barrel carburetors oh powerful car and so he puts it in the garage hides it several months later he put a little piece in the paper now I'm you're going to see me driving this big blue and white car he said it didn't I didn't buy it with y'all's money I was a gift and so he eventually got it out and started driving it was beautiful so he took it to Arizona so I would come up to take Rebecca on a date and he would say well here George use my car well I was young but I wasn't stupid it's 100° out you know and I had a big air conditioner well thank you very much so I'd park my truck and take the Cadillac well the um um the Cadillac needed the expensive gas now back then I know it's like 100 years ago but the gas that I used cost 25 cents a gallon but we had to use the expensive gas in the Cadillac 36 Cents a gallon so we'd pull in and they didn't have self-service either you had to you had to get the guy to do it so we'd pull into a big station we want $2 well anyway let's get on to the story here so um um in 1965 brother Brandon was preaching in Phoenix he always preached up there in January at the at the Christian businessman's meeting and so in this particular service we were all there and there was some different case in that service some sister I don't know what it was but it was very different from everybody else so now we're driving home back to Tucson two hours and we're halfway and he stops for something to drink and so while we're stopped Rebecca says now dad tonight you know in the service and she gave him a couple clues about this sister because she she wanted to know just what about that sister and so he uh well he took his hat off and got real serious and he started telling us other things about that lady well that's when you start paying attention you know H this is something real and uh and and so those things would happen she told us another time she said we were in a restaurant having uh lunch one day a family and over to another table there was a policeman and he had ordered his food and so just as his food was coming his his radio started blasting and he needed to leave so he dropped everything and took off the light flashing and everything brother brand was still eating everybody else is nervous and he said it's no big deal over there a few blocks this little boy fell out of a tree and broke his arm but he's going to be okay so Rebecca said now we knew everybody's dad didn't do that so they had an interesting life you know um now we come to May of 65 but before we get there because we're going to wind this up in another 30 minutes maybe um at the end of 1964 the brother brand says the Lord sent his Angel and told him now look you need to look for a place to stay because you're going to live here you know this isn't temporary you're going to find a house so he starts looking and um I remember him telling me once he said now the Christian businessman offered me a real nice house in Phoenix nice big driveway and I remember he said it cost $96,000 how could I live in a house like that and then people come up there and little use Chevrolet to be prayed for I couldn't do that no he said so he he kept looking and he found U he said the Lord directed him right to this house there in Tucson so this old man had built three houses and had them almost finished and then he would want to sell them so that the buyer could finish it out the way he wanted it and so brother bandam looked at this house he liked it you know and it had space over here to add on the denim that he wanted to always have to put his animals in and so brother BR standing in the doorway of the house looking out and the the Builder is looking he's standing out there looking in and they're talking price well Joseph is 9 years old at the time this little boy and you know how kids are always running their finger up you know checking things out so while they're talking Joseph's running his finger up the door jam you know there's the hole there where the lock goes so he's running his finger up well brother random as he's talking he reaches into his pocket and gets out his knife without even looking away and he sticks it in that hole and out comes a scorpion and he's not looking and Joseph was as far away yeah those things happen so he bought the house so all of 65 they're finishing the house and the driveway and all this stuff you know I remember helping him put some beds together and things and um so in May of 65 here I was you know without a job I was out of high school school um didn't have a job I didn't have a car wake up and so uh no job no car wasn't baptized right no Holy Ghost talk about a loser but I thought I needed a wife huh so I found a time when brother Brandon was not busy I went up to the house you know and he we said in the the room there and we're talking I was there for a purpose well he starts telling all kinds of stories about I don't know trips and bunch of stuff and it goes on and on I said brother Bram now this is wonderful but I'm here for a purpose oh what would that be well she looking right through me you know I said well you must have noticed that I I really like your daughter Rebecca and so uh I'm here to ask for your blessing and your permission because we we'd like to get married married CU I'd already talked to her she was in agreement you know and um he says well now well the eyes got real narrow then you know was friends up to there and then he got real narrow and he says um now look George um I'm going to give you guys permission to be engaged but don't even think about marriage until you both have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said because you see all these other cases that didn't work out too good I said yes sir well time went on that's in may they go away again in June for June and July of 65 and here I go you know and so there in U in uh the uh summertime back in Jeffersonville when he was preaching the U events made clear by prophecy uh anointed one the end time I was sitting from oh closer than the organ I was I was sitting closer watching him preach the anointed ones at the end time going right over you know and um so on August the 1st he preached and I knew that we were going to go back to Tucson that week and I said now brother R before we leave to go to Tucson would you have time to baptize me in Christian baptism why sure you'd be waiting almost three years for that you know so on August the 2nd we went down to the church and there's a few people um witness he didn't know who the Witnesses were because he told his brother hey if there's some visitors bring them in for witness well here's some ladies out there you know a few couples well he comes in to baptize with no shirt on he was kind of embarrassed you know so he baptized me in in random Tabernacle turns out that was the last person he baptized course we didn't know it then and um so then we're back in ton and by then I had had the baptism straight of course I had the girl you know have her ring and um um and I had a car got 5-year-old car but was nice so we're driving around I'm driving he's the passenger he says man I like this car you know and so somehow we got to he he comes up with he says now George if you ever get to go to Israel your Bible will be a new Bible now regardless of what all you heard he was never there okay but he said that to me I wasn't thinking about Israel he wasn't reading my mind I was thinking about the girl you know and so um uh so sure enough that was in ' 65 well eight years later we made our first trip and the Bible becomes a new book wow all the stuff's right there you know it's 50 miles 50 kmers up the side car and all these things it's just a small country well since then we've been able to uh take groups over and we're going on the 1st of November with the group that'll group be trip number 36 so we know where everything is we know the right people we know the Catholics over there they're nice people now when you go over there oh so much Catholic thank God for the Catholics they they preserved it it was up to the brandit that have carried it all home already yeah we had some people over there a couple years ago and so we're up on Mount Mount Caramel and there's a cave I don't know if that's the cave for Elijah was but it's you know the cave so the Catholics have built a nice church and they have the candles burning and everything so we look we take pictures so we get back on the bus and this one brother's hands are all black said' what in the world you've been doing well I was looking for a loose rock yeah 2,000 years later he thinks it can be a loose Rock for him but that's the way we are we're a bunch of idolators you know so we went over there uh all these times and it's safe I mean we've got happy customers sitting right here that have been there and we're going to take the Nigerians next year God willing so see me if you want to go but anyway so um uh in September um brother green was in Tucson to put new drapes in the house the new house because his mother was a seamstress and she was making the drapes for the house so Perry's in town putting up the drapes and brother brandom says to him uh brother Perry looks like this kid's going to be my son-in-law why don't you take him home pray for the baptism of Holy Ghost why didn't brother Brown just put his hand on me be done with it it's not God's plan so I go home with brother Perry to Texas I thought I was going to be on vacation I didn't know they didn't tell me why I was going going so about the second day I'm there brother Richard Blair comes over to use the telephone and he lived about 50 Mi away so he comes over to use the telephone to call brother Brandon well brother Brandon was already out of the house when they called but they said when he comes back we'll have him call you so these two brothers sitting by the telephone all day waiting for the phone call well I'm over in my room reading my Bible and I'm thinking hey there's two brothers here just us maybe we could just pray you know I didn't know I was supposed to be receiving the the Holy Ghost I just thought we'd pray and so we um we're kneeling at a at a bench there in the Sunday School room we're praying and while we're praying their eyes closed it seemed like like outside now you know the clouds are real high and then sometimes there's a shaft of light coming through different places you know and it seemed like one of those shafts of light was coming my way and um about then the phone rings and it was brother brandom calling for brother Blair but brother green goes to answer his phone and greets brother brandham but brother brandham says but first let me talk to George and so I greeted him now he knew that I had a hard head you know so he took the liberty to to um identify what had just happened he said I want to be the first to congratulate to George on receiving the baptism of the Holy [Music] Ghost well that was very nice but my faith isn't so much in what he said but in the fact that God had done something and it just got bigger and bigger the next day I got a call from my mother also in Arizona and she says hey we got a letter here from the president you've been drafted into the army huh they need you well I went home I didn't look for the shortcut like some people I went home reported for the Army So within a week week I was a soldier with the Holy Ghost yeah a good thing because there's a lot of sorry people in the Army well um that was September uh so in November brother Brandon was preaching in shreport Louisiana you've heard the tapes you know Snow White Dove and so forth and um so I'm only an hour and a half away it's a weekend so I asked for a pass well Rebecca came down took me to the meeting so I'm in the meeting in streetport Louisiana and on Saturday um I had a few minutes with brother Brandon by myself and I just was finishing basic training the six weeks of basic training and I didn't know what they were going to do with me I didn't know if I was going to be killing people or dropping bombs or what and so um I explained to him I said brother Braham I'm I'm kind of concerned about what they're going to do with me I don't know what they're going to what they're going to train me for he didn't say anything about a vision he didn't pray he just said don't worry George footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord that was the end of that so I get back to the service get back you know that on Monday uh during that week and it turns out they're going to make a cook out of me huh well I can help myself and a few others you know and um so it was during that time it was on the uh I think it was the Saturday service that I'm sitting back there with Rebecca and he's telling this story and he says yeah my daughter she's engaged that lanky Soldier back there and he says I see him so we were friends okay and we we got along very well but um uh come Christmas time in December of 65 and by then the house is all finished and now the family's going to go back East preach at Christmas pick up the new car and come back and go right into the new house so Rebecca's left in Tucson to move the stuff out of the apartment into the house oh that's nice she'll be here and I'm here I can help her and so um when brother bam traveled if he was by himself or with Billy Paul he would just wear boots and blue jeans and just any shirt but if he was with the family he would dress up a little bit maybe not a tie but he would look a lot nicer he also liked to leave very early now he didn't care for everybody went to sleep it's fine but we're going to get there so at 6:00 he's already rolling you know well like I say I was young but it was not foolish so I wasn't going to go up at 5:00 in the morning and Say Goodbye so I went the night before on the 17th of December to say goodbye to him and um wish him well so I go into his room and um we're we're talking a little bit and so there by the door is a chair and on the chair there's the blue jeans and the boots so I asked him what's this all about and he said well guy never knows when he might have car trouble well I knew that this guy never had car trouble because he kept his cars in perfect condition and if you didn't know anything about cars you'd Wonder okay which one's the new one which one's the one that's two years old he traded because had a lot of miles on it you see he wasn't uh arrogant they needed a new car but he wanted something that didn't have so many miles so anyway he was on his way back to pick up the new station wagon I didn't say anymore he didn't say anymore but with within 24 hours he'd had a terrible head-on collision with the drunk driver the other guy died right there and you've heard the whole story how that he was in the hospital so we flew over on Sunday I got in to see him once now because of the injuries he had a trachea he couldn't speak and they had the head all bandaged up and I don't know if he was conscious of people coming and going who knows but in that intensive carrier unit there in amarel Texas there were 12 beds and during the six days that he was there the other 11 got better and left but on the 24th of December God said that's enough and he took him now see that wasn't in the plan because the way I heard things this messenger Behold the Lamb of God well that's not the way it worked out was it and so then we you know had to deal with all that now we got got to fly um sister brandom on a stretcher her daughter Sarah on a stretcher and two you know ambulance planes back to Indiana planned for a funeral well since I wasn't a blood relative I couldn't stay I had to go back to the service but the um the uh fact is that they had the uh funeral and uh you know brother Bram says here he says you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here just in another dimension faster than this they're not far away you see and so we were like the disciples we were desponding no direction now what the leader's gone you know um so on on December the 29th they had the the funeral but sister Brandon was hurt so bad in this accident that she couldn't decide if the burial should be in Jeffersonville where they had their life or in Tucson where they had their new house and Billy sure wasn't going to decide so the funeral director said we have a place we'll keep him and uh when you all decide we'll have a burial okay so time passes I'm in the Army I'm far away from all this and um the uh fact is that they they chose Monday the 11th of April for the burial right after Easter you know the word says in 2 Timothy 1:7 for God has not given it the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind it doesn't say anything about foolish calculations does it and in Philippians 4:7 and the peace of God which passes all the things you can understand will keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus well it during this time that we learned to pray we learned to listen we learned what he said we became anchored in the word in the prophetic word and the written word you know and so God God was on the scene because with God there's no surprises you know the missionary work began in Earnest you see back then when brother bandam left there were no message churches there was a family here a family there a little group over there nothing like this you know and so um time passes okay we get down to March of 66 and I had my training now as a cook and I knew where I was headed Rebecca was in Tucson watching after her mother her brother her sister learning to do all these things and um and so I called her one Wednesday I think it was and I said let's get married next Tuesday okay so we went home we had a private ceremony at the house and guess what my mother couldn't be there she couldn't be at the wedding of her firstborn because she was in false labor with with number 10 and the baby was born 2 months later now see I'm a man I don't understand that you would think after 10 you'd know what's what no it doesn't work that way so um we were married on March the 30th 1966 and we took our honeymoon back up through the Grand Canyon and go back to Jeffersonville and so we're there for the uh funeral the burial of March of April the 11th 1966 six and during brother Billy Paul's lifetime he always kept a very close relationship with his grandmother which was Hope's mother but this lady never went to church she never showed any emotions she was a very hard person what they tell me so when he goes to to the burial on this on this day he leaves his two little bitty boys with Grandma and he goes over to the burial that was a rainy day day just a just a drizzly rainy day and so he lives he's over at the burial and then he goes back to pick up his boys and um he sees his grandmother coming out of the back room wiping her eyes first time he'd ever see her cry and she said even the heavens weep for that man I remember those things when it's a rainy day but you see at that time when brother brand was in that hospital there was no lack of prayer and we didn't have cell phones it was dimes in the machine you know quarters and everybody was praying and well there's a lot of calculations he can't die and all this stuff a lot of faith but God had a program it wasn't because of the lack of anybody's Faith so any we have this burial then we left that afternoon we flew to California and uh on the 15th okay now we been married two weeks on the 15th of April I flew off to Vietnam for one year I was over there in a hospital it was dirt hospital it was not anything fancy and so here I was a cook at this place it's 100 degrees every day it seemed like and um that was a trial by fire no phone no vacation only letters that's all we had for one year now Rebecca's home learning how to cook how to clean how to do all these things and take care of her mother and her brother and her sister so by the time I got home a year later she was fully trained but um during that year it was only letters you see this Bible is God's love letter to you and I got these love letters and you guys that are you know over 40 years old you remember when you're used to write letters see today they can't even spell they text these little words you know but back then we wrote letters put a stamp on it hope it gets there so I'd get these letters it was addressed to me so I'd go off by myself I'd smell it wow smells just like her you know then I'd read it several times I look between the lines yeah those were the old days and so um God kept me clean during all that time all these other guys who doing all kinds of foolish things I was living for Christ and so got back home in April of 67 and then we had six more months left in the military got out of the military started translating the messages into Spanish and that's been our life ever since well we got to fast forward here by October of 2006 um by then we had you know we had our three children uh two of them were married and we'd been many places we lived in Canada we lived in Venezuela and Mexico different places but by October of 2006 Rebecca was very very ill she uh started with a cancer on the um kidney took that out two years later it appeared on the lung so by October of 2006 she suffered a lot of things now there was no lack of faith there's no lack of prayer I remember receiving a letter from the church in Legos there's 700 people here on their faces praying that was everywhere so it wasn't because nobody was caring but God had a program he was working out you see and so um during this time of course she's you know inching closer and closer to the river all the medicine everything we could do we were doing but this wasn't just anybody this is somebody lived with William Brandon for 20 years she knew what faith was she knew what Miracles were and uh I said now you know that God can heal you in the next 10 minutes and put you back 100% but if he chooses to take you then you get with your dad and you wait for me there well a week later I think it was we got a call from a a sister up in West Virginia a friend of ours and she called to tell me that uh that day she was getting up from the noon meal and right there across the table was a vision and she said in this vision I saw brother Brandon a big Congregation of people and he's preaching faith and the prayer Line's lined up and he's preaching faith and all of a sudden he looks from where he was to where I was to another dimension and I warn you don't speak against it it does happen and so she says and you little sister thank you for praying for my daughter Rebecca and tell George everything's going to be okay that's when you start to pay attention and so I realized this might not work out the way I want it but it's going to be okay well um on the 28th of November of 06 coming up 10 years now the Lord took her and I said blessed be the name of the Lord he knows best you know and before you ask no I'm not going to get remarried so um after the funeral I remember praying I said Lord keep me balanced keep me focused on beyond the curtain and keep me busy and he has kept me busy in I think it was in 2010 I was in 18 countries in one year so we go and we try to be a blessing to somebody I'm not preaching Mysteries I'm not preaching Doctrine we have tapes but people need encouraging because it's been a long a long time and it's start they're starting to say well it's been so long where's the promise of his coming all these things these same tapes relax God's in control you see and so time passes like I say we were married just over 40 years I got three children three grandchildren and when I was over in in the Congo uh I was over there in uh the church with brother Vib Dilla uh two three years ago whenever it was and so I was there for the Sunday School report and they uh said there's 4,700 present Bibles 250 oh got to help these poor people you know so I talked to the pastor later no problem he says we have money we're building this church for 7,000 people and it's not sticks it's all concrete you know we have money um and um he says they sell Bibles right over there but the people can't read oh is that a fact yeah over there in that area 20% people can read in the big cities maybe 80% so I start to question wow what about all this millions of dollars of printing something's not right well I'm not in charge of that part but anyway then during church people keep coming in because they live way out there with 6,000 people you look out there and there's five cars and there's about 200 motorcycles and and a th000 bicycles everybody else walked you know and so I get finished speaking brother B little jumps up and he says now has anybody got any question oh yeah 6,000 people I guess so so they start asking the questions and translating it and going back and forth the only question I remember one sister says well since the Lord took your wife why are you still wearing the ring wow people notice everything you know I said said uh well because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't just until death do you part it's for eternity oh okay yeah so yeah we're we're definitely staying busy and my advice to you all because I am the Elder of most of you um make your wife happy make her laugh every day if she's just laughing it's your stupidity but make laugh you know and um uh you know there's a formula we think what's 50/50 when you get married no that's a lie because if it's 50/50 then when you go to bed at night you got to wonder huh did I win did she win who won no no no it's 8020 you give 80% hoping she gives you 20 she's giving 80% hoping you give her 20 everything works fine I'm not saying I always did it but it does work so look people are watching you every day they're watching your Christianity the the scripture says by this shall all men know that you belong to me because you carry a King James Bible I don't think so because you got you know a picture or even this picture that's not how they're going to know they're going to know by the love we have one to another that's why I love these conventions because it puts us in one room in one Accord we eat together we sleep we love each other that's what it's all about by this shall all may know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another now there's something I promise to read to the ministers here before we get finished and this is on the tape the zerit of spirit you need to put this on your refrigerator at home need to read it every day it's the prayer at the beginning of the tape our heavenly father I want to express if I can this morning how in my heart I feel towards one the holiest of holy coming down to earth and to redeem a sinner like myself and I'm sure that these ministers that's present now can feel the same way it was by your grace that we have made been been made Ministers of this Covenant that thou has given to Adam's Fallen race and we are here this morning Father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know rather the will of God and what we must do to make Christ real to the people of this generation that's the whole program right there not how smart I am how much I suffered how much I spent how I can make Christ real to the people of this generation knowing surely that in the day of the Judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to of which we have spoken and their attitude towards the word which we bring them will determine their Eternal destination he gets very serious therefore Lord in that day we would be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to Father God please through Jesus name let us not say one word that would be wrong but may we have sincere hearts and open mind that we might receive the things that's yours that we might be able to go out into our different fields of work after today and be better equipped because of our meeting with you this morning that is very serious that's the only place you'll find that make Christ real to the people of this generation okay one more thing we're going to read here we'll be done 1960 he says years ago there was a writer Fanny Crosby and she was blind she didn't sell her Birthright like many fine singers today in the television movie world who have sold out their Birthright for a bunch of uh rock and roll she was different they came to her one day and they said why don't you write modern poetry she said I give all my talents to God well then you believe there's a heaven oh yeah you think you'll be there sure and when you get there if you remain blind how will you know him she said I'll feel the nail scars in his hand and then she turned and went back into her room and when she did she raised her hands and began to praise God and when those people left a song strucker she said I shall know him I shall know him and Redeemed by his side I shall stand I shall know him I shall know him by the prince of the nails in his hand then he goes on to say and today brother and sister she's walking the streets of Glory he's there with her the streets of Glory with far better sight than anybody on this Earth ever had she sees him she knows him and is standing Redeemed by his side and if I would ask her tonight Fanny crows
