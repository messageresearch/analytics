[8:59] bless you good evening friends god bless
[9:01] you certainly a great privilege thank
[9:03] you but anthony a great privilege
[9:05] to be here once again tonight uh in his
[9:07] presence
[9:09] gathered around the word of god in such
[9:11] a time as this
[9:12] and we thank god for his grace for his
[9:15] mercy for his love to us that we could
[9:18] be called
[9:19] in such a time as this it's it's
[9:22] it's a tough time for the world but for
[9:25] the bride of jesus christ she is
[9:28] being
[9:29] challenged to look up because that's
[9:31] where our redemption
[9:33] is coming from so i'm happy to be here
[9:35] tonight
[9:36] uh looking for god to speak to us and
[9:39] before we
[9:40] um get started tonight i do want to read
[9:44] our note of praise and then take two
[9:46] prayer requests before we open in
[9:49] uh prayer this evening
[9:51] i believe it was uh last sunday
[9:54] uh we'd have had this prayer request
[9:56] from sister bernadette uh
[9:58] for her sister i think who would have
[10:00] had uh the coronavirus i believe
[10:03] and um we would have prayed for her and
[10:05] she sent a note to praise good morning
[10:07] brother ovid i would
[10:09] like to give the lord a high note of
[10:11] praise and to thank the saints for their
[10:12] prayers my sister is feeling much better
[10:14] the numbness and her fingers are gone
[10:16] she is also off the oxygen because the
[10:19] doctor says that she no longer needs it
[10:21] please continue to pray to keep her in
[10:23] prayer that she's still at the hospital
[10:24] for further observation because of the
[10:26] ravages and the after effects to the
[10:28] virus but thank you jesus so we want to
[10:31] thank god for taking her out of that
[10:34] rough spot and we want to continue to
[10:36] remember her in prayer also
[10:38] i also saw that uh sister judith samuel
[10:41] requested prayer feeling a little unwell
[10:44] and a slight discomfort in her
[10:46] tonsil when she swallows and also
[10:49] a request from sister christine
[10:51] for her father experiencing headaches
[10:53] dizziness and stiffness in his chest and
[10:56] for naomi with an infection on her belly
[10:58] pain so can we just bow our heads for a
[11:00] word of prayer and if there's any
[11:02] requests a night that was not sent in
[11:05] but you want to be remembered in prayer
[11:07] and you want to lift your hands where
[11:08] you at
[11:10] god is able this evening to know what is
[11:13] both spoken and what is also not spoken
[11:16] so can we approach the throne of grace
[11:18] tonight our gracious heavenly father
[11:20] lord we are so humble to be able to
[11:22] gather
[11:23] lord in this way and at this time and in
[11:26] this season for the lord as a people
[11:29] understanding lord and when you walk the
[11:31] earth lord and that centurion had enough
[11:33] faith
[11:34] lord to come and to make his petition
[11:36] known
[11:38] lord you didn't decide to go to his
[11:40] house father because that man had enough
[11:43] faith to know that if you just speak the
[11:44] word
[11:45] lord what you declared would have to
[11:47] come to pass so tonight father without
[11:50] having to be in the physical presence
[11:52] lord of every situation lord that's
[11:55] represented in this virtual room tonight
[11:57] we pray that lord you will dispatch your
[12:00] angels that the presence of the lord
[12:02] will descend into every room into every
[12:05] house lord to those that are on this
[12:08] lord this meeting tonight is bible study
[12:10] tonight lord and that you would touch us
[12:12] at the point of our needs lord we pray
[12:14] right now for our sister judith samuel
[12:16] right now that whatever discomfort
[12:18] whatever feeling oh lord virus or
[12:21] otherwise or whatever it is we come
[12:23] against it tonight in the name of jesus
[12:25] christ we say satan take your hands off
[12:28] of god's daughter tonight lord god we
[12:31] pray for sister christine and for lord
[12:33] her father with that sickness and that
[12:35] tightness of chest and all of that lord
[12:37] we committed into your hands knowing
[12:39] that you are still a miracle worker you
[12:41] are still a healer and for little naomi
[12:43] may you completely heal her and lord for
[12:45] sister bernadette sister who is on a
[12:47] road to recovery may you complete that
[12:49] recovery tonight and for everyone
[12:51] tonight who lord lifted their hands lord
[12:54] expressed a need lord those that i can

[13:09] prayers so may you lord god hear our cry
[13:12] tonight and as we approach your word may
[13:14] you open our understanding to the
[13:15] scriptures may you walk out the pages of
[13:18] the bible may it become a new book to us
[13:20] tonight lord may become a reality to us
[13:23] tonight that we could see
[13:24] lord to see you in all your glory to see
[13:26] you in your power to see what you want
[13:28] us to see tonight lord we commit this
[13:30] bible study into your hands in the
[13:31] precious name of jesus christ amen amen
[13:34] and amen well certainly
[13:37] it's a great privilege to be here
[13:38] tonight once more and so happy everyone
[13:41] was able to make it out
[13:43] i uh
[13:44] i uh i don't know where to start tonight
[13:46] um i have a little thought
[13:50] a little
[13:52] uh trying to bring something out of of
[13:54] the scripture for us tonight i'm still
[13:56] in second kings
[13:57] and um
[13:58] god has it in such a way that it's
[14:01] unfolding without a plan it's not my
[14:03] plan i believe we are walking in his
[14:05] plan
[14:06] and um you know i was sitting down kind
[14:08] of meditating over the last few days and
[14:10] seeing
[14:11] we i'm actually doing a series and i
[14:12] didn't know i was doing a series and it
[14:14] actually started with second kings five
[14:17] when we spoke about neiman
[14:19] and then we went into six
[14:21] and seven uh where we dealt with uh the
[14:24] lepers
[14:25] and
[14:26] now
[14:27] trying to go into eight but to go into
[14:30] eight i have to go back to four so we
[14:32] are in the the second king series uh
[14:34] tonight seeing how god is revealing
[14:37] himself to us and
[14:39] uh a lot of what we have been discussing
[14:41] has surrounded elisha um and we know
[14:45] elisha
[14:46] um you know would have
[14:48] you know been mentored by elijah as it
[14:51] were um he would have seen this great
[14:53] prophet
[14:54] you know operate and we know the story
[14:56] how elijah took the mantle and put it on
[14:59] elisha and we know throughout scripture
[15:02] that there are five identifications of
[15:05] this ministry of elijah we see it
[15:07] identified with elijah we see it
[15:09] identified with elisha we see it
[15:12] identified with john the baptist we see
[15:14] it identified with brother branham and
[15:16] we also see it in the book of revelation
[15:18] identified with moses and elijah
[15:21] that would minister to the jews so we
[15:24] know that elijah has a special place
[15:27] special place in scripture special place
[15:28] to us
[15:30] and i was sharing with brett ovid
[15:32] you know as
[15:33] i delve deeper into scripture and slow
[15:36] things down i like i like to slow things
[15:38] on because and it really comes from a
[15:40] deeper understanding
[15:42] that every single word in scripture is
[15:45] important
[15:47] so if within the the great mind of
[15:49] christ the great mind of god
[15:52] you know and i was sharing with brother
[15:53] ovid i believe on saturday as
[15:55] on saturday that
[15:58] you know it's as if
[15:59] it's as if you had a great grandfather
[16:02] to see the context of the gravity of it
[16:04] that you never knew you never
[16:06] met you never you know but you knew he
[16:09] was a man of great wisdom and and you
[16:11] happened to stumble upon some of his
[16:12] writings that that would kind of give
[16:15] you advice and then you realize that
[16:16] when you read it you know it's showing
[16:19] you how to live showing you how to
[16:21] showing you how to operate and i want
[16:22] you to multiply that by 10 million
[16:24] thousand times
[16:26] and to see the great mind of god you
[16:28] know that that god tried to capture
[16:31] himself you know and put it in word form
[16:34] that if you were to spend time in that
[16:36] word and see him as brother branham said
[16:39] if you don't see jesus in every verse of
[16:41] scripture you know read it again because
[16:43] he is there
[16:44] and that's that's a problem to find him
[16:46] go and look and find him in there you
[16:47] know so
[16:48] as we approach the word tonight it's a
[16:51] familiar text and um i know we we refer
[16:54] to it many times with with preaching and
[16:57] speaking but i just want to kind of sew
[16:59] down tonight uh not going to be too long
[17:01] with you i think i've been seeing that
[17:03] um for a few um
[17:05] times and
[17:07] and um
[17:08] it's kind of you know i think i i get a
[17:10] bit excited but it's a positive
[17:12] excitement because now more than ever
[17:15] the word must be your comfort no more
[17:17] than ever your word must be your
[17:19] inspiration there are many voices out
[17:20] there but this voice is so inspired and
[17:24] to think that god would send our elijah
[17:26] in this day to give us
[17:29] full insight into this book that when we
[17:31] read it now we're not reading it as the
[17:32] pentecostals do or as the theologians do
[17:35] but we are reading it
[17:37] you know through the eyes of the prophet
[17:39] as he would have brought a reveal word
[17:41] to bring light to the written word so
[17:44] our text tonight uh if i were to give it
[17:46] a title i wrote it down somewhere
[17:49] um
[17:50] for a title of this bible study tonight
[17:53] it is the title is it as well
[17:56] a study of the sonomite woman it is well
[18:00] a study of the sonamite woman and i'm
[18:03] sure you know everyone would have heard
[18:05] of the shona might woman before so we
[18:07] want to kind of look at this sister
[18:09] today a little bit
[18:10] and see what god wants us to see out of
[18:14] you know this this story tonight so
[18:17] we find this in second kings
[18:19] uh chapter four and verse eight
[18:23] and i'm reading of course from the king
[18:25] james but i also have a reference from
[18:26] the amplified and i have also some other
[18:29] notes
[18:30] um because i'm trying to capture the
[18:31] essence you know there's a lot said
[18:33] there and brother branham also said
[18:35] certain things about this that brought
[18:36] light that is not very obvious to see so
[18:39] we want to really take our time through
[18:41] this tonight
[18:42] and also to get into that situation you
[18:46] know kind of kind of rewind and go back
[18:48] as it were you know to that point in
[18:50] time so the bible said
[18:52] so we had second kings
[18:54] four and verse eight
[18:56] um
[18:57] and it fell on a day that elijah
[19:00] passed to sunum
[19:03] where was a great woman
[19:06] and she constrained him to eat bread
[19:09] all right so and it fell on a day that
[19:11] elijah passed to shunam
[19:14] where was a great woman and she
[19:15] constrained him to eat bread
[19:18] now
[19:19] the king james here uses the word great
[19:22] but in the amplified it says there came
[19:25] a day when elijah went over to show them
[19:27] where there was a prominent and
[19:29] influential woman
[19:31] so that's what great we're referring to
[19:33] is prominent it's influential
[19:35] then we come across now there's another
[19:38] translation where it says where a
[19:39] wealthy woman lived
[19:41] so we know clearly that this woman is a
[19:43] woman of substance
[19:44] she's a woman of influence she's a woman
[19:47] of authority she's a woman who is
[19:50] has a certain level of command
[19:52] she is in a position of strength as it
[19:54] will
[19:55] and she lived in shunam
[19:57] very much like the woman with the issue
[20:00] of blood
[20:01] we are not given her name
[20:04] we are just told that she's the woman
[20:05] from sunum
[20:07] and by definition she is the sunamite
[20:10] which is the descriptor the description
[20:12] of somebody who lived in that particular
[20:14] area that very small village of shunam
[20:18] which was under at that time the control
[20:20] of the tribe of issachar
[20:22] so as it would happen this great prophet
[20:25] elisha
[20:26] he would be somewhat in the earlier
[20:28] parts of his ministry because it was
[20:30] only about any beginning of second kings
[20:32] or thereabouts is when that mantle would
[20:35] have been passed on so
[20:37] we don't know what the prophet is up to
[20:38] we don't know what he's doing but it
[20:40] would so happen that as he's passing
[20:42] through sunum
[20:43] where this great woman she constrained
[20:46] him to eat bread that word constrained
[20:48] means to to persuade so it's not as if
[20:51] elisha was walking with his hands out
[20:54] looking for food it's not that he
[20:55] walking saying you have food here it's
[20:57] not that he thought he was a restaurant
[20:59] and he's not like he was passing and he
[21:00] smelled the food and said let me let me
[21:02] pass by and see this thing smiling let
[21:04] me let me see if she will give me
[21:05] something he is passing by but this
[21:07] woman sees something about him and we'll
[21:09] see in scripture you know she reveals
[21:12] what she sees about him but the bible
[21:14] said she constrains
[21:16] she persuades uh in another translation
[21:19] it says urge him
[21:21] so it is almost as if to use the word
[21:23] urge to use the word constrain to use
[21:27] the word persuade means it's almost the
[21:29] prophet displayed a certain level of
[21:31] reluctance
[21:32] you know he didn't want to impose
[21:34] he didn't want to place demands on this
[21:37] woman you know as as much as she's a
[21:39] woman of means and a woman of wealth and
[21:41] a woman of substance and a woman of
[21:44] prominence he's not taking that for
[21:46] granted to say what she has might as
[21:47] well take it he is still reserved in his
[21:50] action
[21:51] you know and but abraham and speaking
[21:52] about this particular situation you know
[21:54] says that that god doesn't show his
[21:56] prophets everything you know so it is
[21:58] not as if elisha is is have a radar and
[22:02] knows her motive he doesn't know her
[22:04] objective he doesn't know what her
[22:06] agenda is so he is he is being
[22:09] constrained he's being pushed you know
[22:12] to to to stop and and and eat as it were
[22:16] so
[22:17] and it goes on and
[22:20] so
[22:22] it was that as oft as he passed by he
[22:25] turned in feather to eat bread so that
[22:27] one encounter of stopping and eating let
[22:31] to a habit be informed
[22:33] let a relationship be informed and i
[22:35] want to strike that would relationship
[22:37] be informed that as often as elisha was
[22:41] in this area it was no longer a matter
[22:43] of being constrained or urged but it was
[22:46] like
[22:47] a reach how how how are you doing you
[22:50] know he developed a relationship with
[22:52] with him afterwards in another chance
[22:54] afterwards whenever he passed by he
[22:56] stopped there for a meal
[22:58] so at that point in time
[23:00] elisha is comfortable to stop by
[23:03] this woman of substance of means is
[23:06] happy to have
[23:07] such good company so to speak
[23:09] in her house as it were
[23:11] and verse nine says
[23:14] she said to her husband and she said
[23:16] unto her husband now
[23:18] she said to honor behold now i perceive
[23:21] that this is the holy man of god which
[23:23] passed it by us continually
[23:26] so this woman now is showing determinant
[23:28] and we're building into something
[23:31] she deserves it's a holy man and as much
[23:34] as she is prominent as much as she is
[23:36] wealthy as much as she is influential
[23:39] this is also the first time we are
[23:40] hearing the husband and we're hearing
[23:42] him in context
[23:43] and she said unto her husband behold now
[23:45] i perceive that this is the holy man
[23:47] of god which passed by us continually
[23:51] let us make a little chamber i pray thee
[23:53] on the wall
[23:55] and let us set for him there a bed
[23:57] and a table
[23:59] and a stool
[24:00] and a candlestick and it shall be when
[24:03] he comes to us
[24:04] that he shall turn in feather
[24:07] now i don't know what it was that she
[24:10] saw about elisha
[24:13] maybe
[24:14] i would imagine that as he ate and she
[24:17] saw him traveling because he was on his
[24:19] way somewhere
[24:20] so it's not as if he was as it's not as
[24:22] if that house was the destination it was
[24:24] merely a point as he was passing by he
[24:27] was stopping somebody to eat and maybe
[24:29] she said well witness the prophet
[24:30] looking a little tired maybe the prophet
[24:32] place to rest
[24:34] and she didn't just take it upon herself
[24:36] as much as and i want to stress this as
[24:37] much as she is powerful and and clearly
[24:40] seems to be running things a certain way
[24:42] and operating a certain way she still
[24:44] goes down to within the context of a
[24:47] husband in a house and saying i discern
[24:50] this is a man of god this is not an
[24:52] ordinary visitor as much as we are
[24:54] hospitable and hospitality is is what we
[24:57] do and we from the tribe of issachar you
[25:00] know in this city we operate a certain
[25:02] way that city would have been a farming
[25:04] city how wealth more than likely would
[25:06] have come from farming and agriculture
[25:08] and cattle and we'll see where we get
[25:10] that a little later on as we study
[25:12] tonight
[25:13] but i discern that this is a man of god
[25:15] and because it's a man of god i want to
[25:18] give him a bit more respect i want to
[25:20] honor him and give him a little more
[25:21] than food i wanted to see the context of
[25:23] this thing being built up because these
[25:26] are the actions that she took that led
[25:28] to first order and second order
[25:30] consequences in other words if she
[25:32] didn't do this then other things would
[25:34] not have happened all right so i wanted
[25:35] to understand that all of our decisions
[25:38] and actions and thought processes in
[25:41] other words she saw a need
[25:44] and she also saw that she had the means
[25:46] to do something about a need she saw
[25:49] she saw that she could have done more
[25:51] for this man of god
[25:52] and the bible says let us make a little
[25:55] chamber i pray on the wall
[25:57] and in another chance he says please let
[25:59] us make a little fully wall upper room
[26:02] it was it was on the house stop in in
[26:04] the amplified and put a bed there for
[26:06] him
[26:07] so so he could relax so he could rest
[26:09] with a table
[26:10] and a chair and a lampstand and whenever
[26:13] he comes to visit he can turn in there
[26:16] he'll have his privacy he'll feel at
[26:18] home
[26:19] he'll feel comfortable he wouldn't feel
[26:21] he's imposing because we put him on top
[26:23] of the house in those days the
[26:25] architectural structure would have been
[26:27] almost like a flat roof so to speak
[26:29] so it would have been almost like a flat
[26:31] structure and on top of this flat
[26:32] structure she decided to go up
[26:35] and put a little staircase so that the
[26:37] prophet would have to climb to go a
[26:39] little higher to sit on top of the house
[26:41] where after you have a wonderful meal i
[26:43] want you to see this though after you
[26:44] have a wonderful meal he could sit on he
[26:46] could relax he could write some notes he
[26:49] could meditate he could take a dr he
[26:50] could take a rest and when he's ready
[26:52] and he's resting he's comfortable he can
[26:54] continue along
[26:56] his journey
[26:58] and the bible goes on
[27:01] to verse 11 and it fell on india that he
[27:02] came thinner and he turned into the
[27:05] chamber and leave here
[27:07] in other words one day he came there he
[27:10] was used to doing it
[27:12] he was comfortable doing it
[27:14] he felt so good about doing it he turned
[27:16] into the upper room and laid down to
[27:18] rest and verse 12
[27:19] and he said to jahazi his servant call
[27:22] this tsunamite
[27:24] in other words it's almost like a
[27:26] realization dawned
[27:27] upon him
[27:29] call this to the man and when he had
[27:31] called us she stood before him
[27:34] so clearly
[27:36] elisha was there and and something hit
[27:38] him
[27:41] so
[27:42] he said call her and he said unto her
[27:45] he said unto him and i want i wanted to
[27:47] see this and and it's a big lesson here
[27:49] because there are a lot of lessons here
[27:51] all right so we spent some time talking
[27:53] about hospitality we talk about
[27:55] entertaining gets almost unawares
[27:57] because it would seem from scripture the
[27:59] discernment of who he was came after
[28:02] spending enough quality time with him to
[28:04] understand who she was dealing with it's
[28:05] almost as if she wasn't sure at first
[28:07] and he said i perceive
[28:08] that perceiving took some time to
[28:10] perceive that this is a man of god
[28:13] and she's doing this she's been
[28:14] hospitable she clearly has no agenda
[28:16] because she's not asking anything for
[28:18] return this is her way of just doing
[28:20] something positive
[28:21] but this has such an impact on the
[28:23] prophet
[28:25] that the prophet now wants to do
[28:26] something for her but yet he doesn't
[28:28] even address her directly i find this to
[28:31] be a very interesting thing
[28:33] he is very respectful he is showing
[28:35] great respect for her he's not saying
[28:38] because i'm a prophet i can do what i
[28:39] want i can no no he calls his servant in
[28:42] verse 12 and he said to jahazie and call
[28:44] this shunammite so he doesn't call her
[28:46] he tells jazzy to call her and when he
[28:48] had called her she stood before him and
[28:50] he said unto him in other words
[28:54] elisha is speaking true jihazi to the
[28:57] woman
[28:58] that's the level of respect
[29:00] say now unto her
[29:02] behold thou has been careful for us with
[29:05] all this care in other words you have
[29:07] been doing all this stuff for us
[29:09] this thing cannot go unrewarded
[29:14] what is to be done for thee
[29:17] question
[29:18] in other words what can i do for you
[29:21] so far you have done all this for me
[29:24] you cook
[29:27] you didn't give me a room you know you
[29:29] built a whole you're built you went into
[29:31] construction out of respect for the
[29:33] office
[29:34] what can i do for you
[29:38] in another translation he said you have
[29:39] gone to all this trouble for us what can
[29:42] i do for you
[29:44] what has thou be spoken for to the king
[29:47] or to the captain of the host question
[29:50] so
[29:52] elisha and i want us to catch this
[29:54] because there's a mystery in this
[29:56] gives her two options
[29:59] what can i do for you
[30:02] and i want us to
[30:04] stick a pencil here or a pin here or a
[30:06] little bookmark here because it's
[30:08] important and i want you to understand
[30:10] that when a prophet speaks
[30:13] sometimes the prophet is speaking and
[30:15] he's not even sure i want to be careful
[30:18] to say this
[30:19] how his words will become manifest i
[30:21] want to be very careful in saying this
[30:23] but he is connected to the spiritual
[30:25] dimension
[30:27] so he's asking her he's looking at a
[30:29] woman in power looking at a woman with
[30:31] means looking at the weapon in substance
[30:34] and he's saying what can i do for you do
[30:36] you need me to speak to the king
[30:38] do you need me to speak to the captain
[30:39] of the guard but the branham in speaking
[30:41] about this said
[30:42] that and he was dramatizing elisha would
[30:44] have said i've been annoyed king
[30:47] personally
[30:48] i could put in a word for you i have a
[30:50] relationship with him i know the captain
[30:53] of the god so he's given these two
[30:55] options a favor from the king
[30:57] in another translation he said uh would
[31:00] you like to be mentioned with a king or
[31:01] to be captain of the army
[31:04] and listen to her response
[31:07] and she answered i dwell among my own
[31:10] people
[31:12] and it's a it's like a loaded statement
[31:14] i dwell among my own people in the
[31:17] amplified
[31:19] she answered i live among my own people
[31:21] in peace
[31:23] and security and need no special fevers
[31:28] in other words she is content
[31:31] she is comfortable
[31:33] she is happy
[31:36] what a place to be
[31:38] how many people you know
[31:40] who can say i am content
[31:42] i am happy
[31:44] i don't need
[31:45] i don't need anything
[31:47] you know what i want to buy i could buy
[31:49] where i want to go i could go i could if
[31:51] i want to build a room i could build a
[31:52] room you know here with you know and and
[31:56] this is how she was and it was it was
[31:58] it was also a few things being said
[32:00] there as well
[32:02] because this statement
[32:04] actually almost bothered elisha all
[32:08] right now
[32:12] minor people now verse 14
[32:15] and he said
[32:17] you have to go into other translations
[32:19] to see that there's actually a pause
[32:20] there so it's as if when she said this
[32:23] she actually almost went away because in
[32:26] the amplified it says later elisha said
[32:28] so it is not as if this is a continuing
[32:30] conversation it's as if elijah say to
[32:32] her
[32:33] what can i do for you you want me to
[32:35] speak to the king on your behalf you
[32:36] need a favor from the king you need any
[32:38] help is there anything you need to
[32:39] enforce you need army you need security
[32:42] is there anything you need to get get is
[32:43] there anything you need to to to to be
[32:46] enforced and she said no i am good i am
[32:48] among my people i am fine and that was
[32:50] the end of the conversation
[32:52] but there's something going on in the
[32:54] supernatural realm that elijah still
[32:57] cannot
[32:59] can't rest so to speak you know he's not
[33:01] comfortable because he is seeing this
[33:03] great effort and by now he is more
[33:05] convinced than ever that this woman has
[33:07] no agenda i want this i want this to
[33:09] catch this no she is doing something
[33:11] unto the lord without
[33:13] a plan to get anything i want this to
[33:15] catch just for a minute you know many
[33:17] people do things unto the lord with a
[33:19] with a plan to get something back
[33:22] but this was not this woman this woman
[33:25] was doing something genuinely if there
[33:27] ever was a person in scripture
[33:29] who we could find who was doing
[33:32] something
[33:33] 100
[33:34] genuinely without any desire for
[33:37] anything in return this is the example
[33:40] if you ever want to take note
[33:42] of of how to live for god and how to
[33:45] live in service for his people and how
[33:47] to support the kingdom without anything
[33:50] in return this is one of the greatest if
[33:53] not the greatest example in scripture
[33:56] because if elisha didn't pursue this
[33:59] further this would have continued this
[34:02] way we don't know how long because she
[34:04] said i don't want anything
[34:08] and it's i could imagine it's that
[34:10] response that forced elijah to dig
[34:13] deeper
[34:15] wondering if perhaps there was something
[34:17] that she needed that maybe she didn't
[34:19] want to see
[34:21] something that she had need of that she
[34:23] wasn't comfortable to express
[34:25] some dream that perhaps she had that
[34:28] maybe for so long she wanted it and it
[34:30] didn't happen that she gave up hope on
[34:33] this dream and this dream ended up a
[34:35] very dream a dream that
[34:38] she may think could never come to pass
[34:39] so why ask about it why look for it why
[34:42] expect it you know when i was younger i
[34:44] thought i could achieve it but now that
[34:46] i'm at this stage and i'm i'm
[34:47] comfortable why stress about it anymore
[34:52] so
[34:53] verse 14 and he said what then is to be
[34:56] done for her
[34:57] in other words i am not leaving this
[34:59] house without doing something with this
[35:02] lady
[35:03] that's a powerful place to be here
[35:05] so in other words i want to find the key
[35:08] the key
[35:09] to give and and i want us to see what
[35:11] attributes elisha is displaying here
[35:14] you know what abraham said god wants to
[35:16] give us your holy ghost born i want to
[35:17] receive it
[35:18] in other words this is the christ-like
[35:21] nature upon elijah
[35:23] saying this
[35:25] sister is worthy of reward but i don't
[35:27] want to just give her any reward i want
[35:30] to give her a reward that that would
[35:32] bless her and give her joy and fulfill
[35:34] her desire so i want you to understand
[35:36] that god wants to be able
[35:40] to grant the desires of your heart
[35:42] because as much as she was expressing
[35:45] she had comfort and she was content and
[35:48] she needed nothing there was a desire
[35:50] that she had that she was not expressing
[35:54] everybody with me tonight all right so
[35:56] we we we on we we're going a bit slowly
[35:58] i hope i'm going too slow
[36:01] and he said what there needs to be done
[36:03] for her this is verse 14.
[36:06] and jahazi
[36:09] answered verily she had no child
[36:13] and her husband is old
[36:18] and he said call her
[36:21] in other words
[36:22] elisha is saying
[36:24] that's it
[36:27] and this year a fan is also mind-blowing
[36:29] so elisha called her
[36:32] and when he had called her she stood in
[36:34] the door
[36:37] and i find it such a great lesson of
[36:40] humility
[36:42] a lesson of respect
[36:46] you know it have people when they do
[36:48] something for you you could never ever
[36:50] get all your mind they do something for
[36:52] you
[36:53] they hold it over your head
[36:56] so i want you to picture this
[36:58] is really her house
[37:01] the room elisha is in
[37:03] is her room
[37:06] it's on loan to the prophet
[37:08] but now elisha calls for her
[37:12] the second time
[37:14] and she stops by the door in other words
[37:16] she has so much respect for the man of
[37:18] god it's not like some people you know
[37:19] we say well well i walk in here my room
[37:21] is is my house and i build it my money
[37:24] is your is my money
[37:27] when you build your own room
[37:31] you go away in your room but not this
[37:33] woman this woman was
[37:34] was completely respectful
[37:37] so she stood and and again i want us to
[37:40] understand
[37:41] why i say every word is important
[37:44] because the fact that it's written here
[37:46] in scripture is not for us to speak past
[37:48] it and not consider
[37:50] what god wants us to get out of this
[37:54] many times we do things and we take it
[37:56] back we bless people and we unbless them
[38:01] we operate in such a way that people
[38:04] have to know what you do and how you
[38:06] impacted them i wanted to understand the
[38:08] complete selfless nature and how she
[38:10] operated even though she was a woman of
[38:13] needs and influence she operated almost
[38:15] like a servant
[38:17] almost like somebody said well i'm not
[38:19] even worried they committed his room she
[38:21] she had no claim on on the room i want
[38:23] us to catch that because it's there for
[38:25] a reason
[38:26] and she stood in the door
[38:28] and he said
[38:30] so now
[38:31] he's speaking clearly now
[38:33] called her and she called her and she
[38:35] came and stood in the door elijah said
[38:37] at this
[38:38] caller and and he said about this season
[38:42] according to the time of life
[38:44] thou shalt embrace a son
[38:46] so in in other words
[38:48] he didn't ask her if you want a child
[38:52] he he the asking part was finished
[38:56] the question and answer part was over
[38:58] that was dealt with in the formal
[38:59] conversation
[39:01] this now was not a conversation about
[39:03] what you want it it wasn't like would
[39:05] you be interested in a child no he just
[39:07] prophesied hallelujah he just prophesied
[39:10] over her
[39:11] and he spoke a prophecy to her that she
[39:14] had to get enough faith to catch the
[39:15] prophecy because her statement was
[39:19] he said about this season according to
[39:21] the time of life thou shalt embrace his
[39:23] son and she said nay my lord it was
[39:25] almost overwhelming to her this woman
[39:28] who was a friend to the prophet
[39:30] hallelujah
[39:32] almost almost went into doubt without
[39:34] doubting because she can't believe that
[39:36] the prophet deserved that the prophet
[39:38] figured out that the prophet and his
[39:40] servant figured out what what that that
[39:42] unspoken request that she had that she
[39:45] never talks about anymore because it's
[39:47] so long she gave up hope on this thing
[39:49] she can't believe this could be this
[39:50] could ever be a reality
[39:53] i want us to catch this nowhere because
[39:55] this has significance as we go further
[39:57] all right
[39:58] i just said name my lord dumb man of god
[40:00] do not lie unto that handmaiden
[40:03] no this statement is big
[40:06] because it's the first time she almost
[40:08] come in um it would almost appear as if
[40:10] she's coming against the man of god
[40:12] because this is it it shows how god was
[40:15] shocking her system i want you to
[40:16] understand this
[40:18] god is coming against every her whole
[40:20] life that was structured a certain way
[40:23] you know because sometimes people push
[40:24] for success to mask things they can't
[40:27] achieve or or they don't want people to
[40:28] know there's hurt in there oh god help
[40:30] us tonight there are there are things
[40:32] that people push to achieve and acquire
[40:34] to to
[40:36] to
[40:37] give this impression of success and
[40:38] happiness and achievement to already
[40:40] mercy hidden pain and basically elijah
[40:43] was calling out that hidden pain so much
[40:45] that she was saying don't go there don't
[40:48] touch that that's a sore spot in my
[40:50] heart i gave up hope a long time ago
[40:52] don't lie to me
[40:54] in in other words i feel like i've been
[40:56] lied too many times before oh help us
[41:00] i feel like i had to deal with this
[41:02] issue and deal with the rejection and
[41:04] the pain of it before so i don't want to
[41:06] i don't i can't relive the emotions of
[41:09] this thing
[41:12] but again just like sarah
[41:15] her fear her insecurity about this
[41:19] had nothing to do with the word of
[41:20] prophecy spoken i want us to catch this
[41:23] tonight the word of prophecy spoken
[41:25] about her situation was bigger than her
[41:28] fears her insecurity her dream what she
[41:31] taught about it the fact that she
[41:32] thought it was possible or impossible
[41:34] was irrelevant because at that time like
[41:36] i said it was no longer a question it
[41:38] was the prophecy and we know that when a
[41:40] prophet speaks hallelujah the prophecy
[41:43] has got to come to pass there's no devil
[41:45] there's no demon no principality your
[41:47] doubt your fears your unbelief it's
[41:49] irrelevant in the economy of god can the
[41:51] church say amen
[41:55] and
[41:56] i love it
[41:57] from 16 to 17
[42:00] and the woman conceived
[42:04] in other words it is it is one leap from
[42:06] verse 6 universe 17. it's it's in one
[42:09] verse it's prophecy
[42:11] and the next verse is fulfillment
[42:16] so and understand the context
[42:18] at this season they say this time my
[42:20] life it means a year would have passed
[42:23] so you you carry this like a novel
[42:26] elijah said at this season next year you
[42:28] will embrace a son in the amplified
[42:31] so this verse 16 between verse 16 and
[42:34] verse 17 is a year
[42:37] between verse 16 and verse 17 time alive
[42:40] between verse 16 and verse 17
[42:43] whole life transformed
[42:46] between verse 69 verse 17 she needs to
[42:49] think about how to put crib and how to
[42:51] get training for baby and what to put in
[42:52] place kind of church say amen everybody
[42:55] with me
[42:56] so i want us to catch now
[42:59] prophecy how god is dealing with her now
[43:01] right
[43:02] and the woman conceived and bear a son
[43:05] at that season that elisha had said
[43:08] according to the time of life in other
[43:10] words
[43:11] what the prophet spoke came to pass
[43:14] exactly the way the prophet spoke it and
[43:16] if you understand that we are in a
[43:19] message with a vindicated prophet then
[43:22] whatever the prophet spoke has got to
[43:24] come to pass in the right season and at
[43:26] the right time whether you believe it
[43:28] you don't believe it whatever it does
[43:30] not matter it's got to come to pass
[43:32] can the church say amen
[43:34] now
[43:36] between verse 17
[43:38] and verse 18 is years
[43:43] between 16 and 17 is one year
[43:46] between 17 and 18 is years we don't know
[43:49] how many years
[43:51] but it's enough years is because this
[43:54] boy now is a is a is either one or two
[43:56] things and you'll see it it's either
[43:58] elijah wasn't too tall or his boy was
[44:01] he or was was was very tall for his age
[44:04] because he was he was grown
[44:07] and when the child was grown
[44:09] it fell on a day that he went out to his
[44:12] father to the reapers now
[44:15] i want to just say something in passing
[44:17] here because we cannot i think i went a
[44:19] little too fast over that point
[44:23] this woman said don't lie to me but at
[44:26] the same time the bible is saying the
[44:28] husband was older
[44:30] so the miracle of
[44:33] delivering a child to this woman was not
[44:35] just a miracle to her
[44:39] it would have been a miracle in other
[44:41] words
[44:42] there is very little said about her
[44:44] husband one thing we see clearly is
[44:46] there is respect for her husband
[44:49] so we have this situation where we have
[44:51] a seemingly younger wife this you know
[44:53] my woman who clearly is a is a woman of
[44:56] business she's a business woman she's
[44:58] married to an older man who
[45:00] from all appearances doesn't seem to be
[45:02] too involved in the running of the
[45:03] business as it were
[45:05] he is kept in the loop he's kept in
[45:06] conversation
[45:08] it would appear and we'll see that
[45:10] she would have greater faith than he
[45:12] does
[45:14] but her faith is great enough that even
[45:17] in his old age he is part of the process
[45:19] to have a child i want this to catch
[45:20] that right so when the child was grown
[45:23] it fell on the day that he went out to
[45:25] his father to the reapers in other words
[45:28] he went out to work
[45:30] and he said unto his father my head
[45:33] my head
[45:35] and he said to the father in seeing this
[45:38] like many fathers do karate child by him
[45:41] you know what went on carry my mother
[45:47] anybody ever experienced it
[45:52] carry him to his mother
[45:56] and when he had taken him and brought
[45:57] him to his mother
[45:59] he sat on her knees till noon
[46:04] and then died
[46:06] now i want us to process this for a
[46:07] little bit
[46:09] how are we doing with the time we have
[46:10] time i i didn't check so
[46:13] and when you're taking him and brought
[46:14] him to his mother he sat on her knees
[46:17] till noon and then died
[46:20] till noon
[46:22] meant
[46:23] he was there for a while
[46:25] for some period of time
[46:27] it was not all of a sudden type
[46:29] situation
[46:30] it was progressive
[46:33] a situation like this progress
[46:36] it meant that the mother would have been
[46:38] battling between hope
[46:40] and not having hope
[46:43] she is reliving
[46:44] that protection she would have had
[46:48] that belief she would have had maybe if
[46:50] she was running through a mind that
[46:54] i never thought i'd have a child
[46:59] and against hope there's a miracle
[47:03] but now the miracle
[47:05] the thing that i thought was not even
[47:07] possible
[47:09] is sitting down on me and
[47:12] life is leaving
[47:15] dream is dying
[47:18] possibilities of
[47:21] what would happen when i'm gone is
[47:23] feeling because this is my only child
[47:27] the clock is ticking
[47:30] and she is watching
[47:32] watching
[47:35] it's a private moment as it were because
[47:37] we would see that your father is not
[47:39] even in a loop on what's going on i want
[47:40] us to
[47:41] pause for a minute and process this
[47:46] out of all of our achievements
[47:50] this would have been
[47:51] her greatest
[47:53] because anything that she thought she
[47:54] would never have
[47:56] but yet
[47:57] by god's grace
[48:00] it has come to life for her
[48:02] and the life is being slowly taken away
[48:05] minute by minute the heaviness would
[48:07] increase
[48:08] heaviness would increase until by noon
[48:11] she died
[48:12] he died and died
[48:18] this woman is a lesson in
[48:24] i didn't ask for this son
[48:26] god give me the son this thing can't be
[48:28] over
[48:32] i didn't ask for this blessing
[48:34] i didn't try to get this blessing
[48:37] this blessing came to me this thing
[48:39] cannot be over
[48:42] i didn't hunt for this message
[48:45] i didn't look for this message this
[48:47] message came to me
[48:49] this thing cannot be over
[48:53] the experience i had i didn't hunt for
[48:55] it i didn't look for it i was doing my
[48:58] own thing living my own life
[49:00] and this thing interrupted my life
[49:03] and now it would seem as if there's no
[49:06] life in it
[49:07] it looks dead
[49:10] it looks dead it looks like it's
[49:11] finished
[49:13] but i'm not going to accept no this is
[49:15] huge
[49:16] she is not willing to accept that after
[49:20] all that she went through
[49:22] not what she did i want you to catch
[49:24] this
[49:25] but what god did after she would have
[49:27] gone through that because if this gift
[49:31] this blessing she had was not based on
[49:34] her trying to get it i wanted to catch
[49:35] that for a minute it was based on god
[49:38] doing something for her she
[49:40] could not accept
[49:43] that this was how her story was going to
[49:46] end
[49:47] if i could connect into last week's
[49:49] teaching
[49:50] it was i'm not gonna just sit here and
[49:52] let this happen
[49:55] she was just unwilling to allow this to
[49:58] be
[49:59] the closing chapter of the closing verse
[50:01] of this story was not going to be then
[50:03] died
[50:05] oh hallelujah
[50:06] this this was not going to be the end of
[50:09] chapter 4 of second king i want us to
[50:11] catch us and i want us to see against
[50:13] hope
[50:14] that she had enough fit to do something
[50:17] and i want us to catch that you have to
[50:20] have faith to do something
[50:23] so instead of crying
[50:26] instead of balling on the police instead
[50:28] of holding a head and any whole neighbor
[50:30] i said stop working because work still
[50:31] going on i want us to see the picture
[50:34] the boy had went up with the father to
[50:35] work so work is going on the father
[50:38] still out there on the field
[50:40] this woman is there
[50:44] this thing happens and she air cry
[50:46] she had ball
[50:48] she had changed clothes
[50:51] she went up
[50:53] and laid him on the bed of the man of
[50:55] god and shot the door behind him and
[50:56] went out
[51:00] hallelujah
[51:02] in other words
[51:04] you see this boy
[51:05] you see that room that is your room
[51:07] where this thing started
[51:09] you see that upper room
[51:12] okay you ruined up the house where the
[51:14] man of god rested
[51:17] i didn't ask for this it's god gave me
[51:19] this gift i'm putting him right back
[51:22] on the bed where the man of god slept
[51:25] and the bible said
[51:27] she laid him on the bed of the man of
[51:28] god and shut the door upon him and went
[51:31] out
[51:33] and she called on to her husband
[51:36] not to say your son is dead
[51:40] she called on to her husband not to say
[51:43] i am depressed
[51:44] she called on to her husband not to say
[51:47] i live in a church
[51:49] she called on to her husband not to say
[51:51] i do believe the prophet
[51:53] she called on to her husband saying i
[51:55] think it's time to backslide
[51:57] she called unto her husband i think it's
[51:59] time to adopt
[52:01] she called on to her husband not to say
[52:03] everything negative you say send me i
[52:05] pray the one of the young men and one of
[52:07] the asses that i may run to the man of
[52:09] god and come again in other words i just
[52:11] want to run down the road and come again
[52:13] now run down the road
[52:15] is 30 kilometers to mount carmel
[52:18] because that is where elisha would spend
[52:21] now quality time
[52:23] it may be that he was on the road to
[52:25] carmel whenever he was passing through
[52:27] there we don't know but that is where he
[52:28] spent time the same camel that his
[52:30] predecessor elijah had his showdown
[52:34] with the false prophets of baal who came
[52:36] out from under jezebel's foolishness
[52:38] but that he said i want to run down by
[52:41] elisha
[52:42] and i'll be back
[52:44] and the husband is old but he is stupid
[52:49] he he oh but you can't pull all over
[52:52] your eyes he said and he said wherefore
[52:54] will thou go to him today in other words
[52:56] what day is it
[52:59] it is neither the new moon nor sabbath
[53:03] and if you know your jewish history
[53:06] those were the two days that the
[53:08] prophets would speak right in other
[53:09] words the church days
[53:11] as much as in the northern kingdoms
[53:15] people were backslidden under ahab and
[53:18] now under
[53:20] jehoram
[53:22] underground in those days the prophets
[53:25] the priests the levites who are around
[53:27] would still have their little service
[53:29] on either the the new moon or the
[53:31] sabbath so she said so in other words
[53:33] he's thinking it was a new moon or the
[53:36] sabbath i could understand you're going
[53:37] to see elisha but but why are going on
[53:40] scenes today
[53:41] and she said it shall be well i love
[53:43] your response it shall be well so shia
[53:46] tell her husband your son did
[53:49] she even explain why she wouldn't she'll
[53:52] say it shall be well and friends
[53:54] this builds on the positive you need to
[53:57] change your language i want us to catch
[54:00] this tonight if it's anything you get
[54:02] tonight it's it's change your language
[54:06] you need to speak positive
[54:09] you need to speak positive take the
[54:12] negative words out of your language it
[54:14] doesn't belong it doesn't belong to us
[54:17] you see those things that are revealed
[54:18] those things belong to us not negative
[54:20] things
[54:21] see she said it shall be well and we're
[54:24] gonna build a little bit on that
[54:27] and she suddenly asked and said to her
[54:29] servant drive and go forward slack not
[54:32] die riding for me except i bid thee
[54:35] in the amplified it says then she
[54:38] saddled the donkey and set herself and
[54:39] drive the animal fast do not slow down
[54:42] the pace for me unless i tell you
[54:46] in other words just race
[54:50] so she went
[54:51] and came unto the man of god to mount
[54:54] carmel
[54:56] and it came to pass in other words so
[54:58] she's she's on the way to cameron and it
[55:00] came to pass now it's about 30
[55:01] kilometers so
[55:03] at the rate of a donkey at 30 kilometers
[55:06] this wasn't really a short trip
[55:08] you know theologists have debated how
[55:10] long it already took her to make it
[55:12] there and back it it was some effort
[55:14] donkeys are not known for being the race
[55:17] animal there are no donkey races it's
[55:19] horse racing donkeys is a it's a it's a
[55:22] process
[55:24] so she is going
[55:25] as fast as she possibly can on a donkey
[55:28] so poor elisha is seeing this sight
[55:31] because the donkey is being
[55:34] this is has to be a site
[55:36] so elisha
[55:39] now i want us to see now how god
[55:41] operates
[55:43] you know we prophesy in part but
[55:44] whenever just perfect has come so the
[55:46] prophet is there and
[55:50] and when she came it came that when the
[55:52] man of god saw her afar off
[55:54] that he said to jehoshaphat behold
[55:57] yonder is that tsunami
[56:00] now this in and of itself is interesting
[56:02] because he has seen her coming but up to
[56:04] no
[56:06] there's there's no mention of her name
[56:09] after this is this is not a year this is
[56:12] this is years later so all that time
[56:16] elisha in the house eat food
[56:19] sleep a year pass child born child grow
[56:22] up child die he don't even know and up
[56:24] to no he don't hurt a woman
[56:27] and i love stories like these because i
[56:29] always say when the scripture
[56:31] doesn't name the person
[56:33] you could slip your name there
[56:35] because it could be anybody
[56:37] it's like the woman with the issue of
[56:38] blood whatever issue you have
[56:41] it doesn't say a woman from
[56:46] there's no description for her name it's
[56:48] a situation we're dealing with
[56:50] we're dealing with people who trying
[56:51] their best to serve god and god saying
[56:53] i've given you a blessing
[56:56] and yet life happens and you have to
[56:58] fight to preserve the blessing and have
[56:59] faith that god also will keep that
[57:01] blessing that he promised you because he
[57:03] made a promise to you
[57:04] what you have today is because of his
[57:07] blessings
[57:09] many people could say if not all you
[57:12] have things you never knew you would
[57:13] have
[57:14] you have had experiences you never knew
[57:16] you would have what you have been able
[57:17] to achieve in life you never thought you
[57:19] would achieve
[57:20] and it's not your ability it's not even
[57:22] your works but god's favor has been on
[57:25] your life you've got as much as you
[57:27] choose to complain at times you have
[57:29] more reason to be thankful than to
[57:30] complain you have more reasons to be
[57:32] happy than to be sad you have more
[57:34] reasons to be encouraged than to be
[57:36] discouraged
[57:39] anybody with me tonight
[57:44] so she went and came unto the man of god
[57:46] in verse 25
[57:47] to mount carmel and it came to pass when
[57:49] the man of god saw her afar off that he
[57:52] said to jahazi his servant behold yonder
[57:54] is that shunammite run now i pray in
[57:57] other words close the gap because you
[57:59] you rate
[58:00] this spectacle i see happening here you
[58:02] reach you come into me go and close the
[58:05] gap because whatever going on go out
[58:07] there find out what
[58:08] what it is run now i pray thee to meet
[58:11] her and say unto her is it well with
[58:14] thee listen to it is it well with thy
[58:16] husband
[58:17] is it well with thy child
[58:21] and she answered it as well
[58:25] now i want us to pause there for a
[58:26] minute just to catch this so elisha we
[58:29] don't know when he passed by that house
[58:31] but he is conscious
[58:33] that is the woman
[58:35] it's the husband
[58:36] it's a child and he wants to know all as
[58:38] well
[58:39] but i want us to also notice that this
[58:42] woman's response to jihadi the sylvan
[58:45] because it wasn't elijah asking her the
[58:47] question it was jahazi asking another
[58:49] question and when
[58:51] he asked her the question she said it is
[58:53] well and i want you to catch this
[58:56] teaching here
[58:57] and and i'll get to it because i need to
[58:59] reach the next part to reverse back to
[59:00] this right
[59:04] and when she came to the man
[59:06] of god to the hill
[59:08] she caught him by the feet
[59:11] but jehazi came near to trust her away
[59:15] and the man of god said leave her alone
[59:17] for her soulless vexed within her
[59:20] and the lord had hid it from me and hath
[59:23] not told me so to this point now elisha
[59:26] has no idea what is going on
[59:30] i want to say catch kajal but abram
[59:32] stressed this as well that god would
[59:33] hold certain things
[59:36] those things revealed belong to us but
[59:38] here it is he lies with the prophet
[59:39] himself you don't know what's going on
[59:42] then she said did i desire a son of my
[59:45] lord in other words did i ask my son
[59:53] hallelujah did i ask for sun from my
[59:56] lord did i not say don't give me false
[59:59] hope do not deceive me now i want us to
[1:00:01] notice now for the first time we see a
[1:00:04] difference in her narrative
[1:00:07] when her husband asks at the questions
[1:00:10] he said it shall be well
[1:00:13] when jahazi asked her he said she said
[1:00:16] it is well
[1:00:19] in other words
[1:00:20] she refused
[1:00:22] to communicate her situation to people
[1:00:24] who couldn't help her
[1:00:29] i think i want to say that one more time
[1:00:32] she refused to communicate her problems
[1:00:36] to people who could not help her stop
[1:00:39] talking to people who cannot help you
[1:00:44] can i say that one more time
[1:00:46] stop talking to people who cannot help
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:49] when her husband asks her
[1:00:51] what going on it shall be well in other
[1:00:53] words you can't help me you can't help
[1:00:55] my son i put my son in the best place i
[1:00:57] could put him in the hands of that bed
[1:00:59] where the man of god was i need to get
[1:01:01] to the man of god it shall be well don't
[1:01:03] worry about it because you can't help me
[1:01:06] jahazi as as honest and blessing are you
[1:01:09] trying to be trying to be a good servant
[1:01:11] to the prophet he asking good deacon
[1:01:13] good help
[1:01:14] protecting the man of god
[1:01:17] all is well
[1:01:18] you say yeah all is well soon she come
[1:01:20] in contact with the man of god she has
[1:01:22] to say no it is well enough
[1:01:24] because she came into an encounter with
[1:01:27] the man of god she came into an
[1:01:30] encounter with somebody who she believed
[1:01:32] had access to do something about her
[1:01:35] situation she came into contact with the
[1:01:38] source of the prophecy she came into
[1:01:41] contact from the conversation and
[1:01:43] started it all i wanted to catch that
[1:01:44] but i want to stress again
[1:01:48] stop having conversations with people
[1:01:51] who cannot advance your spiritual work
[1:01:54] cannot advance your financial work
[1:01:57] cannot advance your goals in life
[1:01:59] how things with your business it is well
[1:02:04] you cannot get advice from people who
[1:02:05] don't know where to carry you know
[1:02:08] so either poor not your whole stress
[1:02:10] your whole problem to them and they
[1:02:11] cannot help you
[1:02:12] but when they can
[1:02:13] come in contact with a supernatural or
[1:02:15] somebody who can then you could be
[1:02:17] honest with them then he could open up
[1:02:18] to them can the church say amen
[1:02:23] she said did i desire son of my lord
[1:02:26] did i not say do not deceive me
[1:02:30] and this is where brother branham say no
[1:02:31] the prophet
[1:02:33] so the profit now is under pressure
[1:02:39] the profit is under some pressure
[1:02:41] the prophet doesn't know what to do but
[1:02:43] ivana made it very very clear i have a
[1:02:45] quote i'll see if we get it tonight
[1:02:46] depending on your time so the prophet
[1:02:48] now is beginning to marshall he said
[1:02:50] then he said to jahazi
[1:02:53] get up thy loins
[1:02:55] take my staff in nine hands and go that
[1:02:57] way
[1:02:58] if they'll meet any man salute him not
[1:03:00] in other words stay focused
[1:03:02] somebody wave here doorway back and if
[1:03:05] any salute me answer him not again
[1:03:08] and lay my stuff
[1:03:10] upon the face
[1:03:11] of the child
[1:03:17] and the mother of the child said as the
[1:03:19] lord live it so she is here in this
[1:03:21] conversation see she is seeing jahazi
[1:03:23] leaving with his staff
[1:03:25] heading down the road to go and
[1:03:26] character lay elijah's stuff staff
[1:03:29] upon her son
[1:03:32] and that is not enough for her
[1:03:34] she is here
[1:03:36] you can send your zero but as the lord
[1:03:38] live it
[1:03:39] and as that soul of it i will not leave
[1:03:42] me
[1:03:44] he said until my son is restored to me
[1:03:48] prophet elijah you will have to live
[1:03:50] with me next to you every day because i
[1:03:52] am moving
[1:03:53] until i get a confirmation until i get a
[1:03:56] selfie until i get a picture until i see
[1:03:59] for myself that my boy's alive you have
[1:04:02] me to deal with but a random preaches
[1:04:04] and perseverance
[1:04:06] so he brought a type that this tsunami
[1:04:09] woman was also a class act on
[1:04:11] perseverance he said i am not accepting
[1:04:13] this situation i don't care what you do
[1:04:16] i don't care how much we have i am not
[1:04:18] accepting this situation there has to be
[1:04:20] a transformation there must be achieved
[1:04:22] there must be a turnaround
[1:04:24] and listen and and you can see value in
[1:04:27] why she's operating that way
[1:04:30] because we don't know what lesson god is
[1:04:31] also teaching his prophet
[1:04:34] we are seeing we are focusing here on
[1:04:35] the shuna might
[1:04:37] but he prophet himself is going through
[1:04:39] his own experience
[1:04:40] because he sends jahazi to deal with the
[1:04:43] situation
[1:04:46] and
[1:04:48] uh let me get back
[1:04:54] as a verse 30 as the lord live it and as
[1:04:56] i so live it i will not leave thee and
[1:04:58] he arose and he followed her
[1:05:01] and verse 31 and jahazi passed on before
[1:05:03] them and laid the staff upon the face of
[1:05:06] the child but there was neither voice
[1:05:09] nor hearing
[1:05:11] so in other words when jahazi finished
[1:05:13] with his staff this boy didn't come back
[1:05:15] to life
[1:05:21] wherefore he went again to meet him and
[1:05:23] told him in other words jazzy come back
[1:05:25] to elijah and saying the child is not
[1:05:27] awakened
[1:05:28] now one thing i have to take note of
[1:05:30] here is
[1:05:31] jay has here come back and say the child
[1:05:33] is still dead
[1:05:36] i want us to understand
[1:05:38] that when you enter spiritual things
[1:05:41] and spiritual experiences and spiritual
[1:05:43] situations and spiritual examples and
[1:05:47] that the language of it
[1:05:48] this year is still so it was it's still
[1:05:51] positive it is not the child you know i
[1:05:53] went and put his staff and he tried to
[1:05:54] say that no the child is not yet
[1:05:56] awakened
[1:05:59] in other words there's an expectation of
[1:06:01] waking up
[1:06:02] this didn't do it
[1:06:04] i don't know what next to do
[1:06:06] but the child i wake up yet
[1:06:09] and when elisha was come into the house
[1:06:11] so
[1:06:12] elijah now realize that he himself have
[1:06:14] to come
[1:06:15] he couldn't send jahazi because when
[1:06:17] jahazi went with his staff
[1:06:19] that didn't work so elisha comes into
[1:06:22] the house
[1:06:23] and behold for the first time he had now
[1:06:25] the child was dead
[1:06:27] and laid upon his bed
[1:06:30] and he went in therefore
[1:06:32] and shut the door upon them twin and
[1:06:35] prayed unto the lord
[1:06:38] so i want us to see now
[1:06:40] the value the importance we talk about
[1:06:42] prayer we talk about prayer meetings we
[1:06:43] talk about your consequences we talk
[1:06:45] about your life because and i want us to
[1:06:47] step into elisha's shoes for a minute
[1:06:50] here is a prophet
[1:06:51] here is the seed of prophecy
[1:06:54] the prophecy the seed of it the fruit of
[1:06:56] it is laying there he said
[1:06:58] jahazi that didn't work
[1:07:01] so the prophet himself have to see god
[1:07:06] i want us to catch us now right so he is
[1:07:08] praying
[1:07:10] and i would bring back holy prophet
[1:07:11] presented it as well
[1:07:12] and he went up
[1:07:14] and lay upon the child
[1:07:16] and put his mouth upon his mouth
[1:07:18] and his eyes upon his eyes
[1:07:21] and his hands upon his hands
[1:07:23] and he stretched himself upon the child
[1:07:26] and the flesh of the child waxed warm
[1:07:32] then he returned
[1:07:34] in other words
[1:07:35] he returned
[1:07:37] i guess some theologian will say no
[1:07:39] it was out of
[1:07:41] out of that room
[1:07:44] back probably into the house downstairs
[1:07:46] in other words he gave us space
[1:07:49] then he returned and walked in the house
[1:07:51] once back and forth went up again
[1:07:53] amplified he said went up again so as if
[1:07:55] he was up there any room with the boy he
[1:07:57] prayed he laid on the boy the boy a
[1:08:00] little warm he's not up yet he leaves
[1:08:02] the room close the room comes back
[1:08:03] downstairs so i want us to see something
[1:08:05] building now
[1:08:07] so he's staffed with jahazi
[1:08:09] elijah goes into the room lays his butt
[1:08:11] he prays he comes back downstairs and he
[1:08:13] pieces the floor
[1:08:14] no theologians don't know what that is
[1:08:17] but the prophet
[1:08:20] how many appreciate the ministry of the
[1:08:22] prophet
[1:08:23] but iran said in the message then jesus
[1:08:25] came and called
[1:08:27] he said where elijah didn't have the
[1:08:29] answer
[1:08:31] and he said he didn't know what to do
[1:08:33] so remember he walked up and down the
[1:08:35] floor and just back and forth back and
[1:08:37] forth until the spirit come on him
[1:08:40] glory
[1:08:41] so here it is this is like brother
[1:08:43] branham said you know what i'm waiting
[1:08:44] on
[1:08:46] you know what i'm waiting on
[1:08:48] and then he is here
[1:08:50] so brother branham taped that piercing
[1:08:52] on the floor with elisha was waiting for
[1:08:55] the spirit to drop down hallelujah
[1:08:58] waiting for it waiting for the present
[1:09:00] waiting for the spirit but around said
[1:09:01] direct quote there's another quote let
[1:09:03] me see why this pulled up quickly
[1:09:08] in perseverance but if adam said she was
[1:09:11] positive and elijah didn't know what to
[1:09:12] do he just went into the room walk back
[1:09:14] and forth until listen here until the
[1:09:17] spirit of god the presence of god come
[1:09:21] you see it
[1:09:23] so i want to draw reference
[1:09:25] everybody with me
[1:09:27] tonight
[1:09:28] so
[1:09:29] now
[1:09:32] then he returned walked in the house to
[1:09:34] and fro and went up and stretched
[1:09:36] himself upon him
[1:09:38] and the child sneezed seven times and
[1:09:40] the child opened his eyes
[1:09:44] and he called jahazi and said call this
[1:09:46] sunamite he's still calling her
[1:09:49] we shoulda might
[1:09:51] so he called her
[1:09:53] and when she was coming unto him he said
[1:09:56] take up dyson
[1:09:58] then she went in and fell at his feet
[1:10:00] and bowed herself to the ground and took
[1:10:02] up a son and went out
[1:10:05] can the church say amen
[1:10:07] no
[1:10:08] you remember we're not done yet we're
[1:10:10] not done yet you remember i said that
[1:10:12] last week we were in six and seven and i
[1:10:15] was trying to go to eight but i can't go
[1:10:16] up to eight until i go back to four
[1:10:19] so
[1:10:20] i want us to catch now so we're going to
[1:10:22] eat
[1:10:24] second kings
[1:10:26] eight
[1:10:27] i want to get a different translations
[1:10:29] here good
[1:10:30] second kings eight
[1:10:33] verse one
[1:10:35] then speak elisha so now
[1:10:38] by second kings eight
[1:10:40] if you're taking the bible
[1:10:42] chronologically within the context of
[1:10:44] this and that is some you know let's
[1:10:47] take it within context for now so this
[1:10:49] is now after the lepers this is after
[1:10:52] all it is go on here now this is after
[1:10:54] uh open this boy eyes and all these
[1:10:56] times so we we reached on further now in
[1:10:58] elijah's
[1:11:00] ministry
[1:11:01] it would it would seem as if elisha's
[1:11:03] commitment
[1:11:05] to this family after this boy
[1:11:07] never left it
[1:11:09] because then speak elijah unto the woman
[1:11:11] whose son he had restored to life saying
[1:11:14] arise
[1:11:15] and go thou and thine household
[1:11:18] answer journey wheresoever thou can
[1:11:20] sajun
[1:11:22] in other words take up your household
[1:11:25] and go wherever you can find a place to
[1:11:27] live
[1:11:27] for the lord had called for a famine
[1:11:30] and it shall also come upon the land for
[1:11:32] seven years
[1:11:34] so
[1:11:36] elisha
[1:11:38] imagine a relationship that god showed
[1:11:41] the prophet seven years of famine coming
[1:11:44] this is something that the prophet would
[1:11:46] hold to his heart
[1:11:49] i don't know who else he would have told
[1:11:51] how else would have expressed it if we
[1:11:53] shared it with how we declared it but
[1:11:56] here it was
[1:11:57] with this understanding he is he feels a
[1:12:00] level of obligation
[1:12:02] to go to this same woman and say hey oh
[1:12:05] god honey the lord show me this is like
[1:12:08] this is like this is this is this a
[1:12:10] secret discovery this is something that
[1:12:14] he takes response i want you to catch it
[1:12:16] imagine you live such a life that god
[1:12:20] will come to you to let you know how to
[1:12:22] protect yourself in this season
[1:12:26] clearly her hospitality i want you to
[1:12:28] catch this her hospitality and her care
[1:12:32] to the prophet had such an impact in his
[1:12:34] life
[1:12:36] that not only she got the reward of a
[1:12:39] son which was beyond her understanding
[1:12:40] and expectation
[1:12:42] but after the son died and is not
[1:12:44] restored to life
[1:12:45] elisha can't leave them alone he comes
[1:12:48] and says listen go and find some place
[1:12:50] to live for seven years not seven months
[1:12:53] not seven weeks
[1:12:55] seven years your call wherever you want
[1:12:58] to go i'm just telling you it's seven
[1:13:00] years of famine if you stay here you
[1:13:02] will die go out there find a place take
[1:13:04] you on your household
[1:13:08] leave your people
[1:13:09] leave your nice house the house with the
[1:13:12] roof with you with my whole room on top
[1:13:14] you have to leave that too leave
[1:13:16] everything and go because if you stay
[1:13:17] where you're at you're going to die
[1:13:23] and the woman arose
[1:13:25] and did
[1:13:26] after the saying of the man of god
[1:13:28] and went with her household
[1:13:31] so journeyed in the land of the
[1:13:33] philistines for seven years
[1:13:37] so it's a woman
[1:13:38] from the tribe of isaka
[1:13:41] from the village of sunum
[1:13:43] finds herself
[1:13:45] for seven years in the land of the
[1:13:48] philistines
[1:13:51] while she is there
[1:13:53] in the land of the philistines
[1:13:58] during the period of famine
[1:14:01] people would have come
[1:14:03] and taken over her house
[1:14:06] people would have come taken over her
[1:14:08] lands
[1:14:09] people would have come and taken over
[1:14:11] her fields
[1:14:13] whatever was left of a property were
[1:14:15] people there who should not have been
[1:14:17] there
[1:14:19] this woman
[1:14:21] who had found favor in the eyes of the
[1:14:23] prophet i want you to see it now
[1:14:26] comes back home after seven years
[1:14:29] and i want you to see how much god takes
[1:14:32] interest in the affairs of your life
[1:14:34] after seven years
[1:14:36] she comes back
[1:14:38] to see her house only to find people
[1:14:41] living in it
[1:14:42] i want you to see the picture
[1:14:45] her property is covered by people she
[1:14:47] don't know
[1:14:50] and maybe she stood for a while saying
[1:14:52] this is my house this is my house why
[1:14:53] are you in my house
[1:14:56] but but but miss you wasn't here this
[1:14:58] place was empty nobody was here we look
[1:15:00] we knock we ask is yes we live in here
[1:15:03] you know what years been here
[1:15:05] no you come from nowhere and you're
[1:15:06] saying it's yours you know how people
[1:15:08] will be i plan that piece of thing there
[1:15:10] i do that you can say it's yours so this
[1:15:13] woman
[1:15:15] does the only thing that she could do
[1:15:18] because in her own strength she cannot
[1:15:20] take back her property i want you to
[1:15:22] catch this now i'll go in somewhere in
[1:15:24] her own strength
[1:15:26] she cannot reclaim her land
[1:15:28] in her own strength she can't get back
[1:15:30] what she had
[1:15:32] so
[1:15:33] she really need two things
[1:15:38] she needs the favor of the king
[1:15:42] and she need help from the army
[1:15:46] now
[1:15:47] i want to go back
[1:15:49] to second kings 4
[1:15:50] to remind us
[1:15:52] that the first time that elisha spoke to
[1:15:55] this woman
[1:15:57] he said what can i do for this woman
[1:15:59] does she need a favor from the king
[1:16:01] does she need help from the army
[1:16:04] and she said no her response was i am
[1:16:06] among my people
[1:16:09] so the prophet and i said it i hinted it
[1:16:11] to you the prophet was speaking in his
[1:16:13] spiritual realm
[1:16:15] but the time was not yet for that
[1:16:17] request to even be needed or fulfilled
[1:16:22] but now
[1:16:23] she was no longer in her land she was
[1:16:26] coming from the land of the philistines
[1:16:28] she was no longer with her people her
[1:16:29] people was nowhere around
[1:16:32] so she needed the favor of the king
[1:16:34] and she needed the help of the army to
[1:16:36] get back what was hers i want us to
[1:16:38] catch that
[1:16:39] so let's keep reading
[1:16:42] second kings eight and verse three
[1:16:45] and it came to pass at the at the seven
[1:16:49] years end that a woman returned out of
[1:16:51] the land of the fellow signs
[1:16:54] and she went forth to cry unto the king
[1:16:57] for her house and for her land
[1:17:01] this was a woman who was a woman of
[1:17:03] influence and power and she didn't need
[1:17:05] help from anybody she was among her
[1:17:08] people but now she like anybody else
[1:17:10] have a need to cry for the help of the
[1:17:12] king
[1:17:13] for for what for two things a house and
[1:17:16] for her land
[1:17:17] house was something the king could give
[1:17:19] back land is something you need
[1:17:21] enforcement for everybody with me
[1:17:24] i wanted to see how the prophet having a
[1:17:26] casual conversation but he dropping
[1:17:28] prophecy over her that she didn't even
[1:17:30] know she would need it'll take seven
[1:17:31] years for it even need this
[1:17:36] and the king talked with jahazi so i
[1:17:38] want you to see it now all these years
[1:17:41] pass i don't know when last the king
[1:17:44] would have seen elisha
[1:17:46] it is very evident it's been quite some
[1:17:49] time
[1:17:50] because the bible says verse 4 and the
[1:17:52] king talked with jehoshi the servant of
[1:17:54] the man of god saying tell me i pray
[1:17:56] thee all the great things that elisha
[1:17:59] had done
[1:18:02] so not only is the king trying to get an
[1:18:05] understanding of what has transpired for
[1:18:07] years
[1:18:08] the bible says and it came to pass as he
[1:18:12] was telling the king how he had restored
[1:18:14] a dead body to life
[1:18:16] so this now goes back
[1:18:19] more than seven years because this
[1:18:21] raising of the dead was more so in other
[1:18:23] words the king i hear from the plan of
[1:18:25] god for over seven years
[1:18:27] so it is news to the king that elisha
[1:18:30] actually raised this boy from the dead
[1:18:33] now if there was ever a situation in
[1:18:36] scripture where you have perfect timing
[1:18:38] i want you to go through scripture and
[1:18:39] find perfect timing if there was ever i
[1:18:42] wanted i want you to see this i wish i
[1:18:43] was standing up preaching this right
[1:18:45] and it came to pass as he was telling
[1:18:47] the king how he had restored a dead body
[1:18:50] life that behold a woman
[1:18:52] whose son he actually started like
[1:18:54] crying to the king for a house so i say
[1:18:56] and you know there was this woman this
[1:18:59] tsunami woman who used to keep us in her
[1:19:01] house and the food was good and every
[1:19:04] time we passed she had this good food
[1:19:06] and she decided to build his house on
[1:19:08] top of the house and we stay and when he
[1:19:09] boy she had no child and we talked to
[1:19:11] her and we offered her this and the
[1:19:13] child grew up and when he tried dead
[1:19:15] but that wasn't the end of it she run to
[1:19:17] carmel i run to him i carried his stuff
[1:19:20] and then and as he is testifying this
[1:19:22] thing you see but look see there
[1:19:26] look over here the bible says
[1:19:29] cry
[1:19:30] and it came to pass as he was telling
[1:19:32] the king how he had restored a dead body
[1:19:34] like that behold the woman whose son had
[1:19:37] restored it i cried to the king for a
[1:19:38] house and for a land and jihad he said
[1:19:40] my lord o king this is the woman
[1:19:44] and this is her son
[1:19:45] whom elisha restored to life perfect
[1:19:48] time in it
[1:19:51] and when the king asks the woman
[1:19:54] she told him in the amplified it says
[1:19:57] and when the king asks the woman
[1:20:01] let me find it
[1:20:02] here when the king actually she told him
[1:20:05] everything in other words she verified
[1:20:08] the testimony all right so the king
[1:20:11] listen now
[1:20:12] appointed unto her a certain officer
[1:20:17] and and in this one move here the king
[1:20:19] is fulfilling the request that was
[1:20:22] veiled as a mystery that was actually a
[1:20:24] prophecy oh lord help us
[1:20:27] the request that was veiled as a
[1:20:28] prophecy that was hidden as a mystery
[1:20:30] that she and maybe lies so we don't know
[1:20:33] but she didn't even understand and the
[1:20:35] king
[1:20:36] appointed unto her a certain officer
[1:20:38] saying restore all
[1:20:40] that was hers and all the fruits of the
[1:20:43] field since the day that she left the
[1:20:46] land even until now
[1:20:48] oh my can we give the lord a hand a
[1:20:50] praise
[1:20:52] so this woman
[1:20:54] didn't even realize that
[1:20:56] and i'm trying to
[1:20:58] when you cannot think about it israeli
[1:20:59] is mind-boggling the prophet they're
[1:21:01] sitting on his bed what i can do for
[1:21:03] this woman
[1:21:04] and maybe maybe he he's seeing it but if
[1:21:08] i meant to come
[1:21:09] but she will lose her house
[1:21:12] she will lose her land
[1:21:14] she will need a favor of the king you
[1:21:15] know
[1:21:17] she will need she will need an army
[1:21:19] i'm gonna call her and see what she
[1:21:20] wants she say can i give you a fear of
[1:21:22] the king
[1:21:23] can i get you to talk to the car after
[1:21:25] the army maybe at least if you know them
[1:21:27] you'd never know how the relationship
[1:21:29] would turn out
[1:21:30] and there it was this woman not seeing
[1:21:33] that
[1:21:34] what she taught was permanent was
[1:21:36] temporary oh god help us that the
[1:21:38] comfort she loved of her house and her
[1:21:40] wealth was going to be stripped away
[1:21:42] sometime and what was seen as something
[1:21:44] she didn't need was something she
[1:21:45] actually needed because the prophet was
[1:21:47] not speaking from a simplistic natural
[1:21:49] perspective but he was speaking from our
[1:21:51] spiritual realm and she walked away
[1:21:54] but god still purpose in his heart to
[1:21:57] give her that thing
[1:21:59] even though she didn't understand she
[1:22:00] needed it
[1:22:01] and
[1:22:02] she had to have found such favor that
[1:22:05] god was willing to give us something
[1:22:06] more than that thing
[1:22:07] and give our son
[1:22:10] and that commitment to that son was so
[1:22:12] powerful that god was going to honor and
[1:22:14] keep that son even when he died that's
[1:22:16] not to come back to life
[1:22:18] and even while they're living the normal
[1:22:19] living
[1:22:20] god tap his prophet and say listen
[1:22:23] go talk to that woman tell her to move
[1:22:26] out now because i have to preserve her
[1:22:27] life
[1:22:29] and in the economy of god god's saying
[1:22:31] look how she's going to need the favor
[1:22:32] of the king look how she's going to need
[1:22:34] the army and god bring complete
[1:22:36] restoration
[1:22:37] i'm almost done
[1:22:38] my time is up i just want to read this
[1:22:40] from the prophet
[1:22:43] to close out here
[1:22:46] and it is a testimony of the prophet
[1:22:49] and it's kind of touched me and because
[1:22:52] it ties so much into this you're
[1:22:53] familiar with it
[1:22:55] but
[1:22:56] like scripture to slow down many times
[1:22:58] people don't slow down on these things
[1:23:00] so i'm going to end with this and then
[1:23:01] we're going to close them prayer tonight
[1:23:02] in a message
[1:23:04] god has a provided lamb preached on june
[1:23:07] 20th
[1:23:08] 1964.
[1:23:10] but abraham said he is the same
[1:23:12] yesterday today and forever
[1:23:14] one call tonight will bring him on the
[1:23:16] scene
[1:23:17] just the same as it did then how he
[1:23:20] remains
[1:23:22] the same
[1:23:24] and but the branham said here
[1:23:27] i remember one night coming from dallas
[1:23:29] texas
[1:23:30] it's been several years ago
[1:23:33] i was grounded at memphis and they put
[1:23:36] me up there in that famous hotel the
[1:23:38] airlines did peabody hotel
[1:23:40] and they told me they'd call me the next
[1:23:42] morning in time to catch the limousine
[1:23:45] to go back to the plane
[1:23:47] and i had slept good through the night
[1:23:49] got up the next morning had written some
[1:23:51] letters was going down to the post
[1:23:53] office to mail them
[1:23:55] i went out and started down the street
[1:23:57] and all of a sudden i felt something
[1:23:59] said stop and go back
[1:24:02] well you know how people get impressions
[1:24:04] and i thought well that's probably what
[1:24:06] it was maybe an impression
[1:24:08] went a little further and it kept saying
[1:24:10] again stop and go back
[1:24:12] when i got up in a corner there was a
[1:24:14] big irish cop out there on the corner
[1:24:17] and i was looking at fishing reels and
[1:24:19] things in the window and i might have
[1:24:21] stood a little too long and he might get
[1:24:23] suspicious i was trying to get one of
[1:24:24] those reels so i just turned around and
[1:24:27] started walking back
[1:24:28] and as i walked back faster faster and i
[1:24:31] passed right on by the hotel
[1:24:33] and went down towards the river way down
[1:24:35] i don't know guess i could find a place
[1:24:37] tonight i taught here's getting late
[1:24:39] do you believe being led of god but but
[1:24:41] random acting church and as i went down
[1:24:43] along i was getting late and i know that
[1:24:45] i had to hurry but something just kept
[1:24:47] saying go on
[1:24:49] go on
[1:24:50] and as i
[1:24:52] got almost too late to go back and catch
[1:24:54] my plane i thought well i must follow
[1:24:57] this leading
[1:24:58] and i happen to be singing this little
[1:25:00] song i just met up with you pentecostal
[1:25:03] people about
[1:25:04] they were gathered in the upper room and
[1:25:06] were praying in his name i'm baptized in
[1:25:08] the holy ghost and powerful silver
[1:25:10] scheme did you ever sing that song and
[1:25:12] i'm so glad i could say i'm one of them
[1:25:15] i was trying to repeat that over saying
[1:25:18] come my brother seek this blessing that
[1:25:20] will cleanse your heart from sin
[1:25:22] and as i went along down the street i
[1:25:24] looked and there was an old typical ann
[1:25:27] jemima leaning out over a little fence
[1:25:30] and a little colored house there a
[1:25:32] little whitewashed cabin like leaning
[1:25:34] out
[1:25:34] over the fence
[1:25:36] she had a mansion tile around her head
[1:25:39] and i just quit singing and started
[1:25:41] walking on i didn't know where i was
[1:25:42] going
[1:25:43] he just said keep just keep walking and
[1:25:46] so when i got pretty close to her i seen
[1:25:48] she was kind of smiling
[1:25:50] and i looked her over
[1:25:52] at her and turned my head and walked on
[1:25:55] she said good morning person
[1:25:57] now in the south passing means minister
[1:26:00] and i said good morning auntie

[1:26:06] person didn't have a bible or nothing i
[1:26:09] turned back i said how did you know i
[1:26:11] was a person she said i know you was
[1:26:13] coming

[1:26:16] and she said did you ever read in the
[1:26:18] bible about the sunnah might woman
[1:26:21] i said oh yes ma'am he said you know she
[1:26:25] was barren she couldn't have children i
[1:26:27] said yes ma'am i remember the story

[1:26:32] going to raise that baby to the lord of
[1:26:34] course and he said you know
[1:26:36] and said you know i was that kind of
[1:26:38] woman she said i couldn't have no
[1:26:39] children the husband and i
[1:26:42] and said i promised the lord if he'd
[1:26:44] give me a baby
[1:26:46] that i would raise it for him
[1:26:48] she said he gave me a baby
[1:26:51] i raised that boy the best i could
[1:26:54] to serve the lord
[1:26:57] he said but you know

[1:27:18] and said he's laying in there
[1:27:20] unconscious
[1:27:22] the doctor man was here two days ago and
[1:27:24] said he'll never wake up no more he is
[1:27:26] gone
[1:27:28] and said i just can't stand to see my
[1:27:30] baby die like that
[1:27:32] she says i prayed all night

[1:27:37] i want to hear him say he is saved you
[1:27:41] know
[1:27:41] i'll beat him again
[1:27:43] and i prayed
[1:27:45] and i prayed the prayer
[1:27:47] like about mentioned
[1:27:48] the sona might woman
[1:27:51] and i said i went to sleep and i dreamed
[1:27:53] the dream she said i said to the lord
[1:27:56] lord you gave me this baby and said i
[1:27:59] was like the shunammite woman but where
[1:28:01] is your prophet
[1:28:04] and said he looked come in here and i
[1:28:06] seen a man with a little hat sitting on
[1:28:08] the side of his head wearing that gray
[1:28:10] suit coming down the street
[1:28:12] and said that was about four o'clock
[1:28:13] this morning she said i've been standing
[1:28:16] here ever since oh my lord jesus
[1:28:22] he is still god he answers on both ends
[1:28:26] i said my name is branham i pray for the
[1:28:28] sick did you ever hear of my ministry
[1:28:30] she said no sir person branham i never
[1:28:33] did hear of you
[1:28:35] and she said won't you come in
[1:28:37] and when i opened the gate it had a
[1:28:39] little old fence there and the gate had
[1:28:42] a plow point hanging on it like back in
[1:28:44] arkansas
[1:28:45] it was just
[1:28:46] across the river from it anyhow so you
[1:28:49] know what that was so i pulled the gate
[1:28:50] and went in
[1:28:52] when i went in that home i've been in
[1:28:54] king's palaces
[1:28:56] three or four different kings the king
[1:28:58] of england
[1:28:59] king gustaf of sweden many places going
[1:29:02] in and praying with them
[1:29:03] and i've been in some of the finest
[1:29:05] homes i get in hollywood
[1:29:07] but i never was any more welcome than i
[1:29:09] was in in that one
[1:29:11] you hear what the prophet says
[1:29:13] he felt welcome in a little place just a
[1:29:15] plain little room two rooms
[1:29:18] a little kitchen on the back
[1:29:21] little bedroom here
[1:29:23] and a little old poster bed there was no
[1:29:25] pinups on the wall but there was a sign
[1:29:28] there said god bless our home
[1:29:31] i looked laying there a great big negro
[1:29:33] boy looked to be about 18 years old
[1:29:35] great strong healthy looking boy and he
[1:29:38] had the blanket in his hand and he was
[1:29:40] going uh
[1:29:42] almost ate in pain and i said what's the
[1:29:43] matter with him she said he thinks he's
[1:29:45] out in a dark sea lost
[1:29:47] and says he keeps saying he's lost out
[1:29:49] on the sea and can't find his way he
[1:29:51] thinks he's rowing a boat
[1:29:53] said he's been doing that for two or
[1:29:54] three days
[1:29:56] he said i can't just let him die like
[1:29:57] that said will you pray for him i said
[1:29:59] yes ma'am
[1:30:00] i got to talking about healing she
[1:30:02] wasn't interested in that
[1:30:04] head just now she was interested in that
[1:30:07] she wanted only to hear him see he was
[1:30:10] saved that's all he was interested in
[1:30:12] that he was saved
[1:30:14] and i said he is
[1:30:16] she walked over and took him by the head
[1:30:17] and pulled him back kissed him with the
[1:30:19] cheek and she said god bless mama's baby
[1:30:22] me standing there looking at that i
[1:30:24] thought yeah that's it no matter how
[1:30:27] much this grace
[1:30:29] he has brought to the family how far
[1:30:31] away he is no matter what trouble he is
[1:30:35] he is still mama's baby
[1:30:37] and i thought the bible said a mother
[1:30:39] can forget her suckling babe how can't
[1:30:41] forget you how much love there is your
[1:30:43] names are engraved on the palms of my
[1:30:45] hand
[1:30:46] she kissed him we knelt down i sat at
[1:30:48] the foot of the bed i put my hands upon
[1:30:51] his feet they were hot sticky i said
[1:30:53] auntie will you pray first
[1:30:55] and my friend
[1:30:56] i knowed she had talked to him before
[1:31:00] oh my my my mama
[1:31:02] that just that just speaks to my heart i
[1:31:04] don't know how that's so she started
[1:31:06] praying and brother branham said i know
[1:31:09] she had talked to him
[1:31:11] before
[1:31:13] the way she prayed the prophet knew she
[1:31:16] had a relationship with the lord
[1:31:18] does this touch you tonight
[1:31:22] or what a prayer she made to god then
[1:31:24] she said will you pray and i said yes
[1:31:27] ma'am i said heavenly father
[1:31:29] i'm at least an hour late for the plane
[1:31:32] you told me to come down here and just
[1:31:34] keep coming and i don't know whether
[1:31:36] this is where you wanted me or not but
[1:31:38] this is where i've stopped if you've
[1:31:40] sent me to pray for this boy
[1:31:43] so the prophet is praying now and about
[1:31:45] that time he said oh mama she said what
[1:31:47] does babies what does mama's baby want
[1:31:49] he said is getting light in the room
[1:31:51] remember he was in darkness all the time
[1:31:53] about five minutes he was sitting up on
[1:31:55] the bed hallelujah
[1:31:57] oh

[1:32:01] five minutes he's sitting up on the bed

[1:32:11] wait over a day or whenever i can get
[1:32:13] another plane
