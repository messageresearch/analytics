[20:30] for that
[20:31] that i was able to go through
[20:33] by the grace of god
[20:35] i was able by god's grace and helped to
[20:37] address many issues that are now pending
[20:41] and to deal with them
[20:42] and we don't have

[21:07] the bride
[21:08] see the spirit gonna come up on the
[21:09] bride
[21:10] but the bride the lamb's wife
[21:12] meant a lot to me because i'm totally
[21:14] convinced now that the bride
[21:17] will not be manhandled
[21:19] i am thoroughly convinced that the bride
[21:22] will not be manhandled because the bride
[21:25] is the lamb's wife
[21:27] hallelujah
[21:29] hallelujah
[21:30] you know in trinidad they have a false
[21:32] teaching and a false doctrine where the
[21:34] church is the wife of the pastor so if
[21:36] you go by the next church you commit
[21:37] adultery and fornication and that kind
[21:39] of foolishness and that's based upon one
[21:41] little quote but abandonment says you
[21:42] know the white the church like our wife
[21:45] said they passed a one little quote and
[21:46] that has been
[21:48] doctrinized nailed on and the people
[21:50] knee along with it see and with that now
[21:53] the people feel obligated to that
[21:55] particular minister but the scripture
[21:58] says and it's so unique
[22:00] that is the angel with the viles having
[22:03] the plagues to come i will assure you
[22:06] the bride the lamb's wife so i want you
[22:09] to know this morning that anne-marie is

[25:46] that is loosed on the earth and brother
[25:49] branham said we are striving to get into
[25:52] the kingdom of god before these horrible
[25:57] plagues strike
[25:59] it's coming it's coming but they're
[26:00] going to strike but before it strikes
[26:03] he's prophesied about the manifestation
[26:06] of the sons of god that could have
[26:08] stopped sickness that could just stop
[26:11] diseases that could just stop cancer
[26:14] they're going to stop what is coming on
[26:15] here

[26:19] we call it perplexity men are failing
[26:21] for fear for the things that coming up
[26:24] on the earth oh hallelujah
[26:28] hallelujah
[26:29] and i mustn't praise god

[27:07] hallelujah
[27:09] hallelujah
[27:11] glory glory glory glory glory
[27:15] glory glory
[27:18] hallelujah the bible said when the enemy
[27:22] when the enemy that's we have an enemy
[27:24] when the enemy comes in he's coming when
[27:27] he comes like a flirt not a trickle like
[27:30] a flood he had to get big and bad you
[27:32] had to get big and bold it ought to be
[27:34] beyond what man can do when the enemy
[27:36] comes like a flood the spirit the spirit
[27:40] not a spirit but the spirit the spirit
[27:43] is health not looter not wesley not
[27:46] pentecost but the spirit itself going to
[27:49] raise a standard and the word is a
[27:52] conductor of the spirit then the bride
[27:55] has to become the word that the spirit
[27:58] could move to that bread and be a
[28:01] conductor or glory to god by the time
[28:05] the enemy come the bride should be the
[28:07] word itself
[28:10] glory
[28:11] and the spirit will come upon the pride
[28:16] hallelujah
[28:18] oh glory to god
[28:19] they haven't seen this message yet
[28:22] you may be seated they only hear paper
[28:24] testimonies they only hearing quotes
[28:26] they're in scripture but they haven't
[28:28] seen the living word yet you hear what i
[28:31] said it have scriptures and quotes and
[28:34] arguments but living word it's a
[28:36] different thing altogether the word is
[28:38] invisible until it become flesh then the
[28:41] word that is invisible becomes visible
[28:44] so that living word is when that word
[28:47] become flesh when it thunders into your
[28:49] soul that the world can't see it they
[28:52] see the same outside view but on the
[28:54] inside seven rainbows
[28:57] demons moving out of the way
[29:00] all the way the holy one of israel
[29:02] that's what they said about jesus and
[29:04] when them seven colors begin to flash
[29:06] and settle
[29:08] we are talking about a living fate a
[29:10] living virtue a living knowledge and
[29:12] living temperance living patient living
[29:14] godliness living brotherly kindness at
[29:17] last seven living voices
[29:20] at last seven thunders
[29:29] let me bring this whole thing into
[29:30] perspective
[29:31] all that rejected the seven thunders
[29:34] since 1974 they are deceived
[29:39] only rejected it deceived why because
[29:41] seven thunders gather the bride
[29:42] sometimes get the right faith sometimes
[29:44] i should rather appear so they reject
[29:46] that since years ago
[29:48] did they have already got them
[29:53] hallelujah
[29:54] now in the thunders the devil had to
[29:56] come
[29:57] to see if you could get the rest yes
[29:59] the threats are church members so that

[31:48] oh hallelujah
[31:50] hallelujah
[31:59] this reminds me of a story
[32:01] i read about brother branham she said
[32:02] early days you want to be a cowboy
[32:06] another old horse
[32:08] you jump on the horse put the sat on it
[32:10] right of course put some
[32:12] some kind of picketing on their horse
[32:14] cochlear bull oh i saw all he couldn't
[32:15] move
[32:16] but he still had a good time you know on
[32:18] the horse and so on and whatnot he going
[32:20] by some cowboys rodeo
[32:23] and these are real you see some broken
[32:24] up cowboys men who custom breaking
[32:27] horses i'm at so they called somebody to
[32:29] break a horse and a no time at all the
[32:31] person fell off the horse
[32:33] and then blood to the man nose and mouth
[32:35] and ambulance coming and so on and a man
[32:38] he said was the time of depression he
[32:39] said give fifty dollars for anybody who
[32:41] could steer that hospital thirty seconds
[32:45] and he came to barbara and said are you
[32:46] a writer he said no sir
[32:50] he said that was a different one
[32:52] and that's what i'm talking about are
[32:54] you alright all this you could pretend
[32:56] to ride on an old horse but that horse
[32:59] is a different kind of horse
[33:01] we could pretend to be pride sitting in
[33:04] church but when the plagues when the
[33:07] conditions
[33:19] sent me an email this morning
[33:20] in texas the actually subpoena five
[33:23] teaches humans
[33:25] to see if they're talking against
[33:26] homosexual and gays and so on and the
[33:28] mayor of the of the saying she passed a
[33:31] law that that descended similar they
[33:32] want to read the simmons and send the
[33:34] silvers to see what they're preaching
[33:36] that's what i'm saying you don't even
[33:37] know if all of this is going to build up
[33:39] where they're going to shut the churches
[33:40] down because they're not doing what they
[33:43] want us to do
[33:44] and brother banham said they're going to
[33:45] close the churches down
[33:47] isn't that right that same prophet that
[33:49] said that say i saw america all bummed
[33:51] up and so on he saw that we're not even
[33:53] sure if america is going to reach the
[33:54] tribulation period
[33:56] because man never made a weapon he never
[33:57] used and russia keep talking talking
[34:00] talking the west want to press them and
[34:02] russia saying you know you can't do that
[34:03] you're talking to a real big man here
[34:07] they are the most powerful army on the
[34:09] earth
[34:10] how much threatening they will threaten
[34:11] them they will take so much and then
[34:12] nobody gonna act out the scriptures say
[34:14] we're gonna do but the scripture said
[34:16] what we have to do so
[34:17] so we have to make a church that would
[34:20] make a revival isn't that right we have
[34:22] got to make
[34:24] something
[34:25] maybe seated and in pennsylvania i
[34:28] describe what a goal is i want the
[34:29] reward is it's not the same a goalie
[34:31] could achieve a goal you have time with
[34:33] it you have stages you could go towards
[34:34] the goal we say if you're going to buy a
[34:36] car you said i'm going to buy i i'm
[34:38] going to have a buy a car and all you
[34:40] have with that in your mind that's not a
[34:42] goal until you set stages to get that
[34:44] car until you're going to put money and
[34:46] savings and sacrifice and then you could
[34:48] see us have won a backhand next year in
[34:50] the month of march and you know how much
[34:51] months ahead you know what you're going
[34:52] to get and so on that's a goal you can
[34:54] set a target that's a goal so that bride
[34:56] have a goal a earthly goal something she
[34:58] could achieve but the reward is
[35:00] something given to you for a behavior
[35:02] attitude both good and bad judgment and
[35:05] life that's a reward you cannot pressure
[35:07] it towards a reward you could behave and
[35:09] do and get a reward a reward is given
[35:12] and every age had a reward there have
[35:14] been seven rewards the new name is a
[35:16] reward the new name is not a goal i
[35:18] could preach that but it's not a goal
[35:20] but what you need to do is to get the
[35:21] goal because the goal is if you overcome
[35:24] you get a reward if you don't overcome
[35:26] you have no reward to get so we come to
[35:28] preach to you the target and paul said i
[35:32] press towards the mark of the high
[35:34] calling in christ jesus so we got to
[35:36] have a target that we have to get onto
[35:39] and when we hit that target we are deal
[35:41] we are right we have measured steps
[35:44] towards that goal
[35:45] justification we are on our way
[35:47] sanctification will be on our way god
[35:49] don't want you to stop there but we
[35:51] press into a position of the baptism of
[35:53] the holy ghost to be positionally placed
[35:56] in the kingdom of god
[36:00] oh blessed be
[36:01] the name of the lord
[36:03] oh hallelujah let's play through it all
[36:05] through it all i learned to trust in
[36:06] jesus
[36:07] you sit down
[36:09] let them play
[36:10] and just relax yourself
[36:12] oh hallelujah right now they are
[36:14] collecting dead bodies in liberia
[36:16] right now there's war
[36:18] in different places
[36:19] people running for their lives
[36:21] they have nice new babies
[36:24] they have nice little children and their
[36:26] bums and their heartaches and their pain
[36:28] and they're struggling for water and for
[36:30] food and
[36:31] and so on
[36:33] but i'm say the force anointed by the
[36:35] people to themselves by fear
[36:37] you see what isis does when they go into
[36:39] a village one place they cut out some
[36:40] heads
[36:41] hang it up
[36:42] then if you don't want your head cut off
[36:44] you behave yourself
[36:45] you fall in line what they do they
[36:47] generate fear
[36:48] fear
[36:49] but you know what perfect love does
[36:56] no man have a heaven
[36:58] and no man ever held
[37:00] nobody could keep you out of the kingdom
[37:02] you know what i told mpa even if they
[37:03] don't want me
[37:05] i will come to whosoever will so they
[37:08] can't get rid of me
[37:09] through it all
[37:11] right
[37:23] trust in god
[37:46] i thank god for the mountain
[37:51] i thank god for the valleys
[37:56] i thank god for the trials i've been
[38:00] through
[38:16] i never know what faith in this world
[38:19] can do
[38:22] but this morning hallelujah through it
[38:45] stand and shake somebody next to you
[38:47] testify to somebody
[38:57] one more time
[38:59] through it all through it hallelujah
[39:14] jesus yes i am
[39:38] praise god
[39:42] this morning i want to greet all those
[39:45] connected to us on the internet
[39:47] i want to greet by the roman bentryga
[39:49] and the bontragers and all those who
[39:50] were responsible
[39:51] for the meetings in pennsylvania it was
[39:53] a special meeting to me
[39:55] there was such a flow of the spirit and
[39:57] such an ancient wasn't much people but
[40:00] the unction of the spirit was there
[40:03] to speak what i believe the lord wanted
[40:05] us to speak
[40:06] and i believe god got glory
[40:09] in it all
[40:10] amen so this time we want to turn the
[40:12] bibles to matthew chapter 3
[40:17] and we're going to read for 16 and 17
[40:20] and one voice in matthew 4.
[40:22] are we going to read from luke 4 verse
[40:24] 14 to 22.
[40:28] matthew chapter 3
[40:32] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[40:34] straightway out of the water
[40:36] and low the heavens were opened unto him
[40:39] and he saw
[40:40] the spirit of god
[40:43] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[40:46] him
[40:47] and lo a voice from heaven saying
[40:50] this is my beloved son in whom
[40:52] i am well pleased chapter four verse one
[40:54] then
[40:55] was jesus
[40:57] led up of the spirit
[41:00] into the wilderness
[41:02] to be tempted of the devil
[41:05] luke chapter 4
[41:07] reading from verse 14
[41:10] and jesus returned
[41:12] in the power of the spirit into galilee
[41:16] and they went out of fame of him through
[41:19] all the region round about
[41:21] and he taught in their synagogues being
[41:23] glorified of all
[41:25] and he came to nazareth where he had
[41:27] been brought up and as his custom was he
[41:29] went into the synagogue
[41:31] on the sabbath day and stood up for to
[41:34] read
[41:35] and there was delivered unto him
[41:37] the book of the prophet isaiah
[41:40] and when he had opened the book
[41:43] he found a place where it was written
[41:46] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[41:49] because
[41:51] he has anointed me to preach the gospel
[41:53] to the poor
[41:55] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[41:58] to preach deliverance to the captives
[42:01] and
[42:01] recovering of the sight of the blind
[42:04] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[42:07] to preach the acceptable year
[42:09] of the lord then he closed the book
[42:12] he gave it again to the minister and sat
[42:13] down
[42:15] and the eyes
[42:16] of all them that were in the single
[42:18] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[42:21] began to see unto them
[42:24] this day
[42:26] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[42:30] and all bear witness him witness and
[42:33] wandered at the gracious words
[42:35] which proceeded out of his mouth and
[42:38] they said is not this joseph's son let
[42:40] us pray father we thank you
[42:42] for your words lord and your word is
[42:44] life
[42:45] father we are so needy this morning
[42:47] needy of your unction
[42:49] of your inspiration of your power
[42:52] the people here who are sick
[42:54] and lord they need your help and your
[42:56] intervention in their lives
[42:58] they're those that need deliverance need
[43:00] to break you need a touch need a baptism
[43:03] need power into their lives father may
[43:05] you come in your word and may the spirit
[43:07] move in your word and bring deliverance
[43:09] and heal them all and body mind spirit
[43:11] and soul
[43:12] in jesus name bless your word and
[43:14] interpret our hearts amen and amen you
[43:16] may be seated praise god
[43:19] and i want you to give god some praises
[43:24] if you know how important that is
[43:28] the devil's job to try to wipe out the
[43:30] praises of god and the worship
[43:32] and that worship
[43:34] creates the atmosphere
[43:36] in which the spirit could reveal things
[43:39] and that's what you need that's what you
[43:41] want
[43:42] salvation the ministry of jesus christ
[43:45] identified by prophecy
[43:48] i have an inspiration the life of the
[43:50] messiah manifesting
[43:52] making a bride ready that's actually
[43:55] from a quote
[43:56] the life
[43:58] of the messiah manifested
[44:01] making a bride ready so you notice our
[44:03] emphasis on power manifestation holy
[44:06] spirit dynamics inspiration
[44:10] not on mechanics so much we had that for
[44:12] 40 years
[44:13] ministry of the word
[44:15] we are looking for the life the spirit
[44:19] the power
[44:20] i will return unto you
[44:22] we're looking for another visitation of
[44:24] god
[44:26] jesus came in three sons name son of man
[44:28] son of david son of god
[44:30] the sequence of son of david david son
[44:33] of david is in the millennium so we
[44:35] could leave that out for now but son of
[44:37] man is prophet
[44:39] son of god is spirit
[44:41] so the prophecy was son of man to come
[44:43] and he came
[44:44] that was jesus
[44:46] the word of the lord is not i came
[44:48] through the son of man
[44:50] isn't that right and after jesus left
[44:53] son of god came in the upper room
[44:55] spirit
[44:57] seven ages was son of god
[44:59] but there's a prophecy look something to
[45:00] the son of man will return
[45:02] in the last days and son of man brings
[45:05] back seed
[45:06] so what follows son of man is son of god
[45:09] one son of man comes son of god follows
[45:13] because son of man is word and son of
[45:14] god is spirit
[45:16] solomon brings seed and son of god
[45:18] brings the water to the seed
[45:21] isn't that right
[45:23] so jesus himself couldn't give them the
[45:25] holy ghost he could only give them the
[45:26] promise received the holy ghost
[45:29] he was son of man and he gave them
[45:30] promises he came and unlocked the
[45:33] understanding he opened the mysteries of
[45:35] the new old testament and showed them
[45:37] the promise of joel scripture it shall
[45:39] come to pass i thought my spirit so he
[45:41] gave them the promise of the inheritance
[45:43] which in the natural was a land called
[45:45] canaan but in the spiritual was the holy
[45:48] spirit land
[45:49] hallelujah
[45:50] so in type coming out of egypt going
[45:53] into the land of canaan was coming out
[45:55] of the world and going into the holy
[45:57] spirit
[45:58] so the promise was always the spirit but
[46:01] he had a natural type in it back there
[46:03] so when jesus came he came to introduce
[46:05] the real land
[46:07] hallelujah the land of the spirit
[46:10] oh glory to god hallelujah isn't that
[46:12] right
[46:13] so jesus unlocked the understanding open
[46:15] the word to them and say go up and
[46:17] receive your promise and they did
[46:19] isn't there right and they wrote another
[46:22] book of acts they wrote a book of acts
[46:24] that was the first book the book of acts
[46:26] so after matthew mark luke and john was
[46:28] the book of acts was the wheel in the
[46:30] middle of the wheel turning in the book
[46:31] of acts was the terror fire in the book
[46:33] of acts it was not the acts of the
[46:34] apostles it was the acts of the holy
[46:36] ghost and the apostles the holy ghost
[46:38] was on the move the church was on the
[46:40] move the church the book of acts was
[46:42] guarded by the four gospels of matthew
[46:44] mark luke and john by the oxy land the
[46:47] eagle and the man hallelujah mark luke
[46:49] and john the oxy eagle and lion and the
[46:52] man they were god in the book of acts
[46:54] the axe was the wheel of god turning as
[46:56] to what the church will be the book of
[46:59] acts was the alpha church the book of
[47:00] after the church in operation the book
[47:02] of acts was adopted sons not ready yet
[47:05] to be changed in body because the time
[47:07] was not yet
[47:08] because redemption was not complete and
[47:11] the revelation was not yet fulfilled
[47:13] because god told daniel go that way the
[47:14] book is sealed till the time of the end
[47:17] so we have to wait for the end of time
[47:19] for the full mystery to be unfolded
[47:22] which will give us the open book the one
[47:24] with the seventh seal in it or give the
[47:26] lord some praises
[47:29] oh
[47:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[47:32] god said i am alpha
[47:34] and i am an omega he was in the alpha
[47:37] church he is going to be in the omega
[47:39] church and that is why when brother
[47:41] branham come but abram couldn't take us
[47:43] further he had to go back first
[47:46] because he came to turn our hearts back
[47:49] to the faith
[47:50] oh glory to god
[47:52] because the faith was jesus christ in
[47:54] the church
[47:56] oh give the lord a shout of praise
[47:58] that was the fate
[48:00] that was delivered
[48:05] this
[48:06] if the rapture was promised then those
[48:08] brothers going to rapture in them
[48:12] because they were fully redeemed in
[48:13] their soul and spirit
[48:14] it's just that body needed the power
[48:17] and that was a promise at the last day
[48:19] the last trump is not right this mortal
[48:21] shall put on immortality and we shall be
[48:24] changed so because it was not yet they
[48:26] went and fell asleep
[48:31] that's the story of the first church
[48:33] then the other churches the other ages
[48:35] are to fall away
[48:36] write in the book of jude and james that
[48:38] i can't rebuke them for having rich
[48:40] people in special places and tell them
[48:42] content for the fate fight back for the
[48:44] original argue for it debate for it amen
[48:47] make noise there stop being silent i
[48:50] want to challenge the culture of silence
[48:52] people seem wrong and saying nothing
[48:54] they wouldn't speak out they wouldn't
[48:55] ask a question just sit like dumb dogs
[48:57] and just sit still it's there's no room
[49:00] for that right now you have to come to
[49:02] spiritual maturity you know what
[49:04] ordinary believers that challenge them
[49:06] in that day in ephesians they found them
[49:08] who say they were apostles and found
[49:10] them to be liars and god commended the
[49:13] ephesians church for having that kind of
[49:16] guts and gumption to expose boss and
[49:19] expose what was hypocritical
[49:21] what was ridiculous what was unclean was
[49:24] forced doctrine unclean spirits they
[49:27] were on the word
[49:29] hallelujah give the lord a shout of
[49:31] praise
[49:32] and there is going to be a word church
[49:34] a church back to the bible
[49:40] some ministers feel they can't be judged
[49:42] they will be judged and they have to be
[49:44] judged they have to be checked out but
[49:46] i'm saying when a man gets some power he
[49:48] said try it
[49:49] see if it is right you have a right
[49:54] suppose lucifer sent him
[49:58] and lucy popping in his garment
[50:04] so the all right it's a try
[50:06] try the spirit because many false
[50:07] spirits has gone out
[50:09] many
[50:10] not few many
[50:12] so when we say check them out check them
[50:14] out you're supposed to check them out oh
[50:16] glory to god because brother branham had
[50:18] a life before he was adopted
[50:22] come on i want a bigger shout than that
[50:24] i want a bigger shot than that
[50:26] but ibrahim didn't get adopted to get
[50:29] the life he had a life
[50:31] and that life got adopted
[50:36] come on
[50:37] how many are standing
[50:51] so what is this ministry of jesus christ
[50:56] what is it
[50:58] the unsealing of the prophetic vision of
[51:00] perfection
[51:02] from under the seventh seal
[51:04] the ministry of jesus christ was
[51:05] prophesied
[51:07] it's from a prophetic vision
[51:09] of what must be fulfilled
[51:12] john said there is one standing among
[51:14] you
[51:15] john i was the prophesied
[51:18] that that ministry was coming
[51:20] here come the ministry walking down the
[51:22] banks of jordan
[51:24] here comes the spirit because that was
[51:26] the word
[51:28] jesus was the word here come the word in
[51:32] season call it the word right
[51:35] from age 12 to 30 he was getting ready
[51:38] from age 12 to 30 he's in the scriptures
[51:41] from age 12 to 30 he is preparing
[51:43] himself for the ministry
[51:46] it's the ministry of jesus christ
[51:48] and for him to get a start he can't come
[51:50] up and say i am you know who i am
[51:53] no we don't know who you are
[51:55] no you know who i am no he couldn't
[51:56] start like that
[51:58] that
[51:59] ministry had was to be introduced
[52:02] so john the baptist spirit of elijah was
[52:04] centered for ron the first coming
[52:07] here come christ have to wait it's 12 to
[52:08] 30 and then be anointed
[52:12] the spirit came down
[52:14] as a dove
[52:15] and said this is my son
[52:17] in whom
[52:18] i am well pleased
[52:20] it wasn't a minister's association
[52:21] consultancy program and when she signed
[52:24] up to get his head examined
[52:26] or his psychology or way or technique of
[52:28] preaching examine
[52:29] it wasn't if he was in the groove of the
[52:32] other ministers or ministries he was led
[52:35] by the spirit he was anointed by the
[52:38] spirit and the spirit led him into the
[52:41] wilderness to be tested not by men but
[52:43] by satan himself
[52:45] and when you see you could deal with
[52:47] satan you could deal with man
[52:50] oh god him good hallelujah
[52:53] are you with me
[52:55] he did not have class with that man
[52:57] giving me a fight and he upset me with
[52:59] what he say this is the devil himself he
[53:02] overcome the lust of the eyes come on
[53:03] now he overcome the lust of the flesh he
[53:06] overcome the pride of life he overcome
[53:09] lucifer
[53:10] and his offer
[53:12] lucifer give him an offer and jesus turn
[53:16] it down
[53:17] oh give the lord some praises people
[53:20] all these kingdoms are mine
[53:22] and if you bow down and worship me i
[53:24] will give them to you and you won't have
[53:27] to go to calvary
[53:32] you know where's jesus
[53:34] he wanted to put jesus as his ceo
[53:37] but he's the main man on top of that
[53:40] so jesus said no dice i'm going to pay
[53:42] the price
[53:44] i am going to pay that price isn't that
[53:45] right so then jesus went through his
[53:49] wilderness test
[53:50] or place of train after being anointed
[53:55] with the spirit
[53:57] in the fullness
[53:58] come on now with the fullness the
[54:01] fullness of the spirit came upon that
[54:03] example seed sun
[54:05] he is our example we have one example
[54:08] sweet son that was jesus what happened
[54:12] to him have to happen to me have to
[54:14] happen to you
[54:16] because that's the original way
[54:18] that is the way
[54:20] there is no other way
[54:23] you have got to be filled with the whole
[54:26] egos
[54:30] oh give the lord some praises people
[54:33] oh hallelujah
[54:35] i don't want nothing affect you
[54:39] from hungering
[54:40] and cursing
[54:42] after righteousness because jesus said
[54:45] blessed are that day that hunger and
[54:48] test after
[54:50] they righteousness
[54:52] be
[54:53] filled
[54:55] and save again
[54:57] they shall be
[54:59] filled
[55:00] how many want to be filled
[55:03] you are under promise
[55:05] to be failed
[55:17] now i'm going to make a shocking
[55:18] statement long time
[55:21] make a shocking statement
[55:23] but a good shock
[55:26] the ministers
[55:27] have to get
[55:29] the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:31] in this season
[55:33] to move forward
[55:34] even virtue power for service
[55:41] what they have now
[55:42] can't make it
[55:44] can't do it
[55:46] no it will take a power but that is what
[55:48] this promise
[55:50] god cannot release charity as charity no
[55:53] we're going to mess things up
[55:55] he has to get character and to get
[55:58] character he has to lose power
[56:01] that would send you
[56:03] to calvary
[56:05] that would send you
[56:06] into the wilderness
[56:15] now watch question
[56:17] all the ministers
[56:19] who preached by the banner message
[56:21] i don't care where they are
[56:23] any part of this globe
[56:25] that preach this message
[56:28] to go into the ministry of jesus christ
[56:31] the spirit
[56:32] have to come down upon them
[56:34] they or we i should say is i identify
[56:37] with the message but the messages have
[56:39] to become identified with us
[56:41] it's not the same thing
[56:43] right now on planet earth no minister
[56:45] have the ministry of jesus christ
[56:48] no man has that ministry
[56:50] and it takes that ministry to catch the
[56:53] headstone
[56:59] so where we are
[57:00] i'll say this way we have to get
[57:03] desperate
[57:09] let me give the next shock
[57:11] what around says
[57:12] what we need is a prayer meeting
[57:14] and say lord send down the adoption of
[57:16] the holy ghost
[57:22] in other words we have to come to that
[57:24] spot
[57:24] where you begin to realize that as you
[57:27] are you can't make it
[57:32] in other words you have to come to that
[57:34] spot where you say lord i've got to get
[57:36] that mark
[57:38] because the death angel
[57:40] was commissioned
[57:42] to take out
[57:43] i want to say it like i don't understand
[57:45] it to take them out
[57:46] hallelujah you know like a shooter shoot
[57:48] this one and take them out all who don't
[57:51] have the mark
[57:52] remember all that fell on the earth
[57:54] shall worship the peace except
[58:01] therefore if you see your name on that
[58:04] book
[58:05] how you should rejoice
[58:07] how you should bless god for the
[58:10] opportunity to sit down in church to
[58:13] hear this word
[58:35] put the mark who feel they have arrived
[58:37] put a mark on the arrogant no put the
[58:39] mark on the proud
[58:41] no no no no don't don't put them back
[58:42] there put a mark upon those who sigh
[58:45] oh god
[58:46] i can't take it no more you ever see
[58:48] somebody sign
[58:50] somebody in a stress
[58:51] a baby's sick a baby hospital you ever
[58:54] see a mother with a sick child or the
[58:56] mother sign they can hardly breed
[58:59] because they don't know if the baby is
[59:00] dying and the mother is cyan that's what
[59:02] we're talking about we're talking about
[59:04] the groaning we're talking about
[59:06] travailing when zion travail zion
[59:09] brought forth
[59:10] where is that in the message
[59:13] where is the preaching of the gospel to
[59:16] create in the house of the people a
[59:18] hungry for righteousness a thirsting for
[59:20] god like david he says the heart plant
[59:24] after the water brooks so my soul turns
[59:27] out to god to see the living god when
[59:31] shall he appear
[59:32] why where did the heathen rage and the
[59:35] people imagine the vain thing they say
[59:37] where is your god
[59:40] oh give the lord a praise offer him but
[59:42] you're going to see him
[59:44] you're going to see that god your god
[59:46] will come quickly and he will do right

[1:09:49] because he knew that they have to they
[1:09:51] are going to be the conductor of the
[1:09:52] spirit

[1:09:55] very word itself they lack understanding
[1:09:57] they lack revelation they lack the word
[1:10:00] of being open to them so with a

[1:11:33] his brethren then all of a sudden god
[1:11:34] moved in
[1:11:36] oh we can see the wheel in the wheel
[1:11:38] moving god great plan moving everything
[1:11:40] up to this exodus watch when he would
[1:11:42] call his people back in the land again
[1:11:46] back in the place watch in position
[1:11:49] where he could bless them
[1:11:50] and place among them the one that he
[1:11:52] promised he would place among them he
[1:11:55] they had to be in their land remember
[1:11:58] they had to come out of the land that
[1:11:59] they were in to get into the land of
[1:12:01] promise
[1:12:02] before the promised messiah could ever
[1:12:04] come
[1:12:06] hallelujah and the church here we go has
[1:12:10] to do the same thing
[1:12:11] get out of that group of rejecters
[1:12:14] over into the promise before messiah can
[1:12:18] ever be manifested before them
[1:12:20] that's why they're going to be an exodus
[1:12:22] from groups and churches all the people
[1:12:24] that reject the full atonement
[1:12:27] yes when the spirit begin to move the
[1:12:29] spirit will connect with the seeds
[1:12:31] that is in the elect
[1:12:33] in every group

[1:12:52] with the human spirit and with their
[1:12:54] mind they can't touch the soul
[1:12:57] in the heart of the elected
[1:12:59] because that is the wife of the lamb

[1:13:06] head that has nothing to do with the

[1:17:10] didn't know they couldn't say nothing
[1:17:11] but jesus you know sometimes we do that
[1:17:13] we hold back on people because we feel
[1:17:15] not ready yet
[1:17:17] listen
[1:17:18] a baby eagle
[1:17:20] is those big ones

[1:18:02] safely to that show
[1:18:04] no
[1:18:06] that they could be healed
[1:18:07] because god is a healer
[1:18:09] do you understand that this
[1:18:10] transformation this rapture is the
[1:18:13] level of divine healing
[1:18:15] your body is being changed
[1:18:18] into your immortal condition
[1:18:23] do you understand that cf can only go
[1:18:25] after death
[1:18:27] but faith takes you to the resurrection
[1:18:36] do you understand that we are the first
[1:18:38] people on earth that will be dead proof
[1:18:43] you're not getting me
[1:18:45] you're not getting me
[1:18:47] you said i'm saying that
[1:18:50] we are the first people
[1:18:52] on earth
[1:18:53] that certified that proof
[1:18:58] we shall not all sleep
[1:19:03] but we shall be
[1:19:04] changed
[1:19:06] in a moment before your blinky eye
[1:19:09] be gone
[1:19:12] go on
[1:19:14] go on
[1:19:15] hallelujah hallelujah ringing the pastor
[1:19:17] he's not there he's gone
[1:19:24] glory
[1:19:25] hallelujah
[1:19:26] we shall be changed
[1:19:29] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:19:31] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:33] why because we bypass autophagy
[1:19:36] oh eternal body word body and come down
[1:19:38] on his head to be tempted to be tested
[1:19:41] jesus did not bypass theophany he came
[1:19:43] from thought to word to flesh so he knew
[1:19:45] all things but we are going back to know
[1:19:48] all things because we're going back to
[1:19:50] the world
[1:19:51] where at that day you shall know
[1:19:53] and the bible said you know in part and
[1:19:55] probably sign part but when that which
[1:19:57] is perfect is come but then you shall
[1:19:58] know as you are known
[1:20:00] you shall know as you are known
[1:20:03] you don't really know how you are known
[1:20:05] here but jesus gave a hint he said
[1:20:07] father glorify me with the glory i had
[1:20:09] with thee before the world was because
[1:20:11] they were in me and the glory we had we
[1:20:14] share with them
[1:20:15] because they were with us before the
[1:20:17] foundation of the world
[1:20:19] so we are not from trinidad we are not
[1:20:21] from this world we come from god we go
[1:20:24] back to god the devil is alive this
[1:20:26] morning
[1:20:27] we have got to be filled because the
[1:20:30] holy ghost is your expression
[1:20:43] peter
[1:20:44] no much
[1:20:45] when jesus opened an understanding open
[1:20:47] the wood to them peter didn't say well
[1:20:48] you know what i know who i am now
[1:20:51] i don't have to go to no upper room
[1:20:54] i am the word
[1:20:57] but the wood is a seed so what peter
[1:20:59] will be saying i am a seed if you don't
[1:21:02] get water on that seed you'll remain a
[1:21:04] seed
[1:21:05] for a very long time
[1:21:08] so what jesus was telling them
[1:21:10] when you get the revelation
[1:21:12] that you are the seed of god the word
[1:21:15] you go in that room
[1:21:17] and call for water
[1:21:19] because the water
[1:21:21] when that water hit the seed
[1:21:23] the devil is in trouble
[1:21:25] now satan hold it satan underestimated
[1:21:29] the staggering
[1:21:30] he misinterpreted that he didn't read it
[1:21:33] well
[1:21:34] he thought they were drunk
[1:21:36] he thought they were excited he thought
[1:21:38] they were pentecostals because we in the
[1:21:41] message and we pass the pentecostals so
[1:21:43] we're not supposed to shout and dance
[1:21:45] and shake up and no no we're not we we
[1:21:47] are past all of that so when the devil
[1:21:49] thought was there's a pentecostal
[1:21:50] behavior and they came out staggering up
[1:21:53] a room and preaching peter preaching
[1:21:55] gospel going back to jesus and saying
[1:21:58] this same jesus god has beat lord and
[1:22:00] christ that was fine the devil said okay
[1:22:02] tell me some more wake me up
[1:22:04] what i'm saying the devil turn over and
[1:22:05] abandon sleep
[1:22:07] when peter walked to the gate called
[1:22:08] beautiful and the man crippled it
[1:22:11] everybody knew
[1:22:13] and peter didn't have extra change to
[1:22:16] give him a little drink
[1:22:18] and peter said sylvain go have i none
[1:22:20] but such as i have i i give it unto you
[1:22:22] rise up and walk in the name of jesus
[1:22:25] and that man walked
[1:22:27] that was the talk
[1:22:28] that that man walked
[1:22:30] that was the talk the talk wasn't what
[1:22:33] peter said at the day of pentecost the
[1:22:35] talking tongue was that man who walked
[1:22:38] when peter talked to that man he had to
[1:22:41] walk when you talk to the he has
[1:22:43] to walk you talk to the blind that's
[1:22:46] right enough to see it you talk to the
[1:22:48] dumb that don't have to speak
[1:22:50] because jesus
[1:22:52] walking again
[1:22:54] not the third person not the second
[1:22:56] person but the only person the person of
[1:23:00] god veiled in his people
[1:23:07] oh
[1:23:08] hallelujah
[1:23:10] when the devil saw that they never said
[1:23:12] with a man this is serious let's call a
[1:23:14] meeting emergency
[1:23:16] emergency meeting was called in hell he
[1:23:19] said no we have to stop it immediately
[1:23:21] we can't let his fire spread we call it
[1:23:23] his glory spread we can't let this
[1:23:25] anointing spread jesus was one man and
[1:23:27] he was on fire it looked like other men
[1:23:29] get recruited it looked like they are
[1:23:31] terrorists in my kingdom i can handle
[1:23:33] that right now we can't lose this holy
[1:23:35] ghost terrorism upon us we can't lose
[1:23:37] faith and virtue this knowledge and
[1:23:38] temperament we can't lose this kind of
[1:23:40] people with character but metal with
[1:23:42] spirit with humility with simplicity
[1:23:45] with godliness with holiness with
[1:23:46] righteousness we can't hold them the
[1:23:48] loose in my kingdom oh hallelujah the
[1:23:51] devil in trouble this morning we're
[1:23:53] gonna walk right we're gonna talk right
[1:23:55] we're gonna live right the voice is
[1:23:56] gonna thunder what we seek and
[1:23:58] justinville is thousands of your voices
[1:24:08] so
[1:24:10] you may be seated
[1:24:11] they arrested them
[1:24:13] put licks on them
[1:24:15] or if they were baby believers
[1:24:17] maybe believers
[1:24:19] when they got arrested they would be
[1:24:21] saying we should not be arrested because
[1:24:22] we are sons of god
[1:24:26] don't talk about lexi
[1:24:27] my father beat me since i was that child
[1:24:30] but just for these firefighters they put
[1:24:31] legs on me
[1:24:33] i do deserve it
[1:24:35] i'm entitled not to be beaten
[1:24:38] i'm entitled not to be

[1:24:42] mature again because you have no
[1:24:43] entitlement he leads you this way he
[1:24:46] leads that way
[1:24:47] and when they got licks listen they get
[1:24:49] blows you know

[1:31:46] happened to him he fell as deadly he
[1:31:48] said where is me i'm undone
[1:31:50] a man of unclean lips isaiah said lord
[1:31:53] me and you we are there
[1:31:58] so i didn't say that
[1:32:00] as i was broken
[1:32:02] when john gets in that glory he fell
[1:32:05] daniel fell all of them one behavior but
[1:32:08] abram was slamming a room he said you no
[1:32:09] blessings but you don't know the power
[1:32:13] reverent fear of god the power of god
[1:32:16] when the fire came on the mountain mount
[1:32:18] sinai the people said don't let god
[1:32:20] speak let moses speak
[1:32:23] god let moses put some rope around the
[1:32:25] mountain he said any animal anything
[1:32:27] cross that kill it
[1:32:31] kill it
[1:32:32] because the unholy ghost let him cross
[1:32:34] that map don't cross that line if you
[1:32:37] cross it kill
[1:32:38] it this is not man
[1:32:41] this is god we're talking about he's no
[1:32:43] respecter of man he's gonna get glory
[1:32:46] satan angle beat him on this one he's
[1:32:48] gonna get glory
[1:32:49] satan gonna satan came down and god's
[1:32:51] eden and now god himself come along and
[1:32:54] satan eden according to first
[1:32:56] thessalonians 4 the lord himself
[1:32:59] descends with a shout
[1:33:01] to get his people out
[1:33:05] hallelujah
[1:33:06] so i didn't come in this message to
[1:33:09] remain here
[1:33:10] and die in good old age
[1:33:13] no
[1:33:14] i came here to accomplish a purpose
[1:33:16] i wanted to be fulfilled
[1:33:18] god expect you to give more
[1:33:20] to do more to add more he said after
[1:33:23] your faith virtue you may be caesar now
[1:33:26] watch the most we could receive is
[1:33:27] revelation
[1:33:29] amen at the first level
[1:33:31] and at that level that's faith
[1:33:33] but virtue is power and power comes from
[1:33:37] god
[1:33:38] that power is spirit
[1:33:41] so faith brings down spirit
[1:33:44] or faith brings down the power of god it
[1:33:46] takes faith to anoint the power of god
[1:33:49] so when you come to church you are not
[1:33:50] in power for your life you can't be
[1:33:52] satisfied just to be a normal human
[1:33:54] being
[1:33:58] you're too ordinary
[1:34:00] no you ought to be like samson a parrot
[1:34:02] a spirit the spirit has to come upon you
[1:34:05] when you feel it you could run when you
[1:34:07] feel it you could jump when you feel it
[1:34:10] you know you are alive unto god
[1:34:13] your child of god your son of
[1:34:17] the god is with you
[1:34:19] there's no weapon form against you're
[1:34:20] going to prosper then you can make a
[1:34:22] table in the presence of your enemies
[1:34:24] then the lord is with me that would ever
[1:34:25] say the lord is with me harlow david
[1:34:27] knew that the lord is with me oh glory
[1:34:30] to god said i look under the hills for
[1:34:32] once come on my help they will never set
[1:34:34] out good fighters behind them but here

[1:35:19] which promised jesus
[1:35:21] after he overcome the devil three while
[1:35:23] attacks
[1:35:25] he went in the power of the spirit
[1:35:27] at first the spirit came upon him
[1:35:29] and the spirit left him as it was in the
[1:35:32] wilderness
[1:35:33] to deal with the devil with the word
[1:35:34] alone
[1:35:35] that's the word

[1:35:55] no he wasn't doing that either
[1:35:57] just it is written

[1:36:00] to play the word game he said it is also
[1:36:03] written
[1:36:04] it is also written and he will overcome
[1:36:06] you keep walking through the wilderness

[1:37:25] objectivity of the operation of this
[1:37:27] power that god has released so jesus was
[1:37:30] going to identify the purpose of the
[1:37:32] spirit being upon him he said the spirit

[1:37:55] where he left off
[1:37:57] you didn't know what i'm saying mrs
[1:37:59] jesus will pick up where he left off
[1:38:02] mrs jesus is a continuation of jesus
[1:38:10] he is the world
[1:38:12] and she's a continuation
[1:38:14] of the variable itself
[1:38:16] and jesus pronounce the scripture
[1:38:19] and listen he made a bold statement he
[1:38:21] made it present tense no blind heal yet

[1:40:21] man and his wife
[1:40:22] his girlfriend his ex-spouse when
[1:40:24] they're in perfect harmony like one soul
[1:40:27] one man they're gonna be one flesh and
[1:40:29] when the church can get into such
[1:40:31] harmony with god
[1:40:33] you know all the quotes i have read so
[1:40:35] if i haven't do it mysteries teaching
[1:40:37] knowledge intellect i know it has
[1:40:39] nothing to do with that harmony with god
[1:40:42] until the manifestation of the
[1:40:44] bridegroom is manifested in the bride
[1:40:47] because they're going to be one
[1:40:49] oh hallelujah you see brother branham
[1:40:51] he's standing looking helpless he
[1:40:52] preached a message sometimes he's not a
[1:40:54] deep message hard message and then he
[1:40:56] said you know what i'm waiting on i'm
[1:40:58] waiting on the angel of the lord i don't
[1:41:00] know if he'll be here i don't know if he
[1:41:01] will come be waiting upon the regional
[1:41:03] lord and he keep talking a little bit
[1:41:05] talking a little bit talking honestly
[1:41:06] but he's here
[1:41:10] now the people who sit in the community
[1:41:11] and they don't know he's there
[1:41:13] they haven't seen him because they don't
[1:41:14] have eyes yet to see it unless god open
[1:41:16] their eyes but but rather he is here he
[1:41:18] says i take every spirit under my
[1:41:19] control
[1:41:20] for the glory of god
[1:41:26] glory
[1:41:28] say one time
[1:41:30] paul gives testimony one time there was
[1:41:32] a child had some spirit kind of
[1:41:34] epileptic person like that and balaam
[1:41:36] prayed on the child the spirit didn't
[1:41:37] move
[1:41:38] and burn said there's something wrong
[1:41:40] and he looked up in the congregation and
[1:41:42] saw a man on the balcony he said he said
[1:41:45] would you all bowl your heads and close
[1:41:46] your eyes
[1:41:48] and the man keeps standing there
[1:41:49] watching he said would you boy your head
[1:41:50] and close the eyes and then baram prayed
[1:41:53] he said lord don't let that unbelieving
[1:41:55] spirit or something like that or that
[1:41:57] disrespectful or whatever stop the
[1:41:58] healing of this child i was a little
[1:42:00] girl
[1:42:01] and when the devil leave that girl it
[1:42:03] fell on that man a man fell off the
[1:42:04] balcony
[1:42:06] plumb of the balcony
[1:42:08] the man and wife came up above the bomb
[1:42:10] after service is it barbara that's my
[1:42:11] husband
[1:42:12] he's a minister he and me no wrong harm
[1:42:15] i'm praying that this spirit come up for
[1:42:17] him i can't help him
[1:42:18] he crossed the line
[1:42:20] you could cross the line
[1:42:22] don't cross the line
[1:42:23] he's a minister but all the prophet said
[1:42:26] was bow your head close your eyes this
[1:42:28] is a spirit here this is not something
[1:42:31] it's a spirit that's here in other words
[1:42:33] be respectful be reverent god going to
[1:42:36] bless you that's all
[1:42:38] that's what we're talking about when the
[1:42:40] angel is there the power is there i mean
[1:42:42] god glory get glorified look how much
[1:42:45] years but i see a person's shadow unto
[1:42:47] death they have cancer keep talking
[1:42:49] about it until somebody took a picture
[1:42:50] and i see the big black hood over the
[1:42:53] person you see the darkness did that
[1:42:55] come to death and when they're prayed
[1:42:57] for that darkness leaves he could see
[1:42:59] death over people
[1:43:01] and that could leave people
[1:43:03] light could come over your life it had
[1:43:05] many times people in darkness and all of
[1:43:07] a sudden light come and push back to
[1:43:09] darkness
[1:43:10] don't think that your state is permanent
[1:43:12] don't think that your condition you have
[1:43:14] to be who you are no you could be
[1:43:16] released today
[1:43:17] yeah you could be free today
[1:43:19] hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen
[1:43:23] praise god so whatever adam said now
[1:43:25] watch when this going to be when all is
[1:43:27] going to be fulfilled he said i'm going
[1:43:28] to visit you i'm going to visit you a
[1:43:30] corny time of life you're going to have
[1:43:32] that baby you're waiting on the latter
[1:43:34] rain is fixing to fall so you slip this
[1:43:36] in you have hold that seed long enough
[1:43:38] now
[1:43:39] unbelieving you are looking for the
[1:43:41] coming son that's the real church today
[1:43:44] that's the elected seed you're looking
[1:43:46] for him and i'm going to send him to you
[1:43:48] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:43:50] praise god how are this going to come
[1:43:52] about how this ministry going to come
[1:43:54] true by acts 1 8.
[1:43:56] sin john 1 11 12 as many receive him to
[1:43:58] them gave me power to become the sons of
[1:44:00] god so in other words no minister could
[1:44:02] claim to have the ministry without power
[1:44:05] that makes no sense
[1:44:06] you must have virtual power
[1:44:08] watch faith alone won't do it you shall
[1:44:10] receive power the seven thunders give
[1:44:12] faith that alone can do it it has to
[1:44:14] take virtue power so the power is the
[1:44:17] promise of dynamics a refilling of the
[1:44:19] holy ghost isn't that right charity
[1:44:21] coming down village virtue to give the
[1:44:23] bride us our revival to give the bride
[1:44:26] virtue power to make that seventh
[1:44:28] undersea live
[1:44:29] because that word in you have to be
[1:44:31] activated before you're going to
[1:44:32] wilderness before you go into
[1:44:34] willingness you can't go in willingness
[1:44:36] without spirit coming upon you because
[1:44:38] the spirit have to lead you there
[1:44:42] are you with me
[1:44:43] the spirit
[1:44:44] have to lead you there so the seventh
[1:44:46] thunder manifestation will be the real
[1:44:48] revival not the seventh under preaching
[1:44:50] or teaching or interpretation but the
[1:44:52] seven thunder manifestation he promised
[1:44:54] a manifestation isn't right blessed
[1:44:57] being of the lord and brother branham
[1:44:58] said our molina foundation for a short
[1:45:00] quick message for that will shake the
[1:45:02] whole nation and i believe that message
[1:45:04] is going to be dynamics to our mechanics
[1:45:06] isn't that right where we could have
[1:45:08] jews everybody got manifested where the
[1:45:10] virtue could be flowing out the minister
[1:45:12] flowing out to the people i understand
[1:45:14] brother branham had like something
[1:45:15] around him and on the platform you will
[1:45:17] see people come up and barack said don't
[1:45:18] be afraid that's just his presence a
[1:45:20] woman has come up with him and as she
[1:45:21] come like she just bounced back there
[1:45:23] was something around him that was the
[1:45:25] coat that was the glory that was the
[1:45:27] presence that is what he had that is
[1:45:30] what the bride gonna have also a power a
[1:45:32] presence a glory around your life then
[1:45:35] you are protected you are shielded
[1:45:38] hallelujah by the glory of god the devil
[1:45:40] have to get permission to approach you
[1:45:44] oh glory to god amen
[1:45:47] so jesus had power isn't that right the
[1:45:50] bible said a woman with a blood issue
[1:45:52] she touched him she said i felt the
[1:45:53] power come out of me
[1:45:55] that must happen
[1:45:57] are you with me
[1:45:58] glory to god of power isn't that right
[1:46:01] so jesus promised this ministry to his
[1:46:03] bride called the fate isn't that right
[1:46:05] syndrome 14 12. the same works i do
[1:46:07] shall do also sin mark 16 these signs
[1:46:09] shall follow never believe the bible
[1:46:10] said the lord himself went everywhere
[1:46:12] with them confirming the word with signs
[1:46:14] for one of the miracles the lord himself
[1:46:16] went with them
[1:46:17] they were going and the lord going with
[1:46:18] them too the angel with them too fire
[1:46:21] with them too power with them too where
[1:46:23] you go god going oh glory to god the
[1:46:26] witness of the lord is with you you'll
[1:46:28] even have to speak it will speak for
[1:46:29] itself god will vindicate you as his
[1:46:31] daughter and vindicate you as his son do
[1:46:34] you believe that so brother branham left
[1:46:36] us a short message with a promise of
[1:46:37] dynamics he didn't release dynamics he
[1:46:40] gave us a message with the prophecy of
[1:46:42] dynamics just as jesus gave them a
[1:46:45] message with receiving the holy ghost
[1:46:47] behold i send you the promise of the
[1:46:48] father oh glory to god i will not leave
[1:46:52] you confidence i'm gonna come to you oh
[1:46:54] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:46:56] isn't that right hallelujah
[1:46:58] praise god do you believe that now so we
[1:47:01] are looking for the spirit
[1:47:03] isn't that right to come down upon the
[1:47:05] bride dynamics of the holy ghost to come
[1:47:08] upon a bride as virtue powerful service
[1:47:11] the same spirit that came upon jesus has
[1:47:13] got to come upon you
[1:47:15] isn't that right you have a holy ghost
[1:47:16] promise how many understand you have a
[1:47:18] holy ghost promise say i have a holy
[1:47:20] ghost promise save again i have a holy
[1:47:23] ghost promise
[1:47:25] say it one more time i have a holy ghost
[1:47:26] promise
[1:47:28] oh glory to god amen
[1:47:30] hallelujah
[1:47:32] give the lord i shout i pray
[1:47:37] glory
[1:47:39] glory
[1:47:41] this is brother joseph coleman and it
[1:47:43] almost appears as if god by design
[1:47:46] had a journey for the bride
[1:47:48] after brother madame left that the bride
[1:47:50] helped us to pass through as it was new
[1:47:53] york city because brother branham
[1:47:55] himself said there is something about
[1:47:56] new york city and that something was a
[1:47:58] ministry that got placed there to bring
[1:48:00] more light in the world now hear this
[1:48:02] what he said we cannot have
[1:48:04] an in-between ministry between pentecost
[1:48:08] and the ministry of jesus christ
[1:48:11] we have to wait for the ministry of
[1:48:14] jesus christ otherwise we in pentecost
[1:48:17] are being a revelation of seven thunders
[1:48:19] seven manifestations not only will you
[1:48:21] hear the truth seven thunders but it
[1:48:24] will be a manifestation of expression
[1:48:26] from the inward parts will come out in
[1:48:28] the spirit and love divine
[1:48:30] what is he saying there is no
[1:48:33] in between ministry
[1:48:35] so when peter of them got their
[1:48:37] understanding open and the word they had
[1:48:38] to wait
[1:48:42] so right now we are waiting
[1:48:44] we have no power in ourselves we have to
[1:48:47] wait till dynamics come dynamics will
[1:48:49] produce further power for service that
[1:48:52] will lead us into the wilderness to be
[1:48:54] formed into the word image and then when
[1:48:56] seven virtues are formed charity come to
[1:48:58] cap the whole thing attack sons
[1:49:02] and place them in this glorious
[1:49:04] ephesians ministry
[1:49:06] hallelujah now you will understand when
[1:49:09] the prophet says when a church has grown
[1:49:10] in
[1:49:11] that the holy ghost is just as real
[1:49:13] as it was to their pentecost how they
[1:49:15] groan and travail and cry but when they
[1:49:18] are born and positionally born then god
[1:49:20] sets in the church think about it
[1:49:23] 40 plus years have gone
[1:49:26] 50 years since what abraham left
[1:49:28] and there are ministers and pastors all
[1:49:30] around the world
[1:49:31] not
[1:49:32] yet
[1:49:33] pleased
[1:49:34] the inheritance have not yet been
[1:49:36] divided
[1:49:38] joshua had a threefold purpose take the
[1:49:40] people over are you with me
[1:49:42] conquer the land
[1:49:44] two three divide inheritance
[1:49:46] are you with me
[1:49:47] when the holy ghost came on pentecost it
[1:49:49] was divided
[1:49:51] tongues of fire sat on each of them
[1:49:53] each of them got the liquor fire each of
[1:49:56] them got their portion
[1:49:58] each of them walk out there with
[1:50:00] something
[1:50:01] nobody will tell peter peter i feel like
[1:50:03] to talk in a hula pull back no no peter
[1:50:05] knew what he had to do
[1:50:07] peter was pushed because he had the key
[1:50:09] to unlock the kingdom
[1:50:11] so peter stepped forward under the
[1:50:13] inspiration of the holy ghost and said
[1:50:15] this is that that the prophet jewel
[1:50:17] speak of
[1:50:18] every man was led by the spirit
[1:50:21] philip did not consult anybody to go to
[1:50:24] the ethiopian eunuch philip left the
[1:50:26] revival led by the spirit go to the
[1:50:29] chariot of ethiopian eunuch to witness
[1:50:32] jesus to him
[1:50:33] peter had to consult no one to go to
[1:50:35] cornelius coast the spirit was leading
[1:50:38] the spirit was directing the spirit was
[1:50:41] in charge the cap was amongst them
[1:50:43] hallelujah paul led by the spirit buster
[1:50:46] rebuke and rebuked peter and straight
[1:50:48] them out and peter led by the spirit
[1:50:50] humble himself because paul spoke the
[1:50:52] word
[1:50:53] and what paul spoke was right
[1:50:56] oh hallelujah they were godly they were
[1:50:59] rugged they were gutsy they were
[1:51:01] directed by god there was no lead man
[1:51:09] it was the church on the moon
[1:51:12] so i want to say since barack obama have
[1:51:14] died there is no vacancy for his
[1:51:16] position
[1:51:18] no man needs apply
[1:51:20] there is no vacancy
[1:51:22] god used brother coleman an individual a
[1:51:24] certain way and after he left
[1:51:27] the land has to be divided
[1:51:30] and i will tell you something joshua
[1:51:31] buster rebuked in joshua 18 he said how
[1:51:33] long are you so slack i told them
[1:51:35] brothers in india are safe only waiting
[1:51:36] for somebody from america england
[1:51:38] trinidad wherever they come to give all
[1:51:40] your inheritance i say oh yeah you are
[1:51:41] lazy i didn't preach any convention i
[1:51:43] told you to be ministers
[1:51:45] i said you were lazy i said because
[1:51:47] joshua said why are you so slack to go
[1:51:49] and possess
[1:51:50] i said nobody around you would have have
[1:51:53] um the mention of jesus christ i don't
[1:51:55] see god the fight for ministry speaking
[1:51:57] english i say god can speak hindi too
[1:52:06] speak spanish any language because when
[1:52:08] the holy ghost came known there were
[1:52:09] different people of different languages
[1:52:11] there and they said oh here we
[1:52:14] in our own language so when god came
[1:52:16] down in their pentacles they were
[1:52:18] hearing their own language the words
[1:52:20] that was being spoken as peter spoke it
[1:52:23] god was translating it

[1:52:44] revival everybody could come to a
[1:52:46] convention no more translation needed oh
[1:52:49] what a revival that gonna be
[1:52:50] back to the day of pentecost hallelujah

[1:55:11] of christ in you without sensation
[1:55:15] performing signs
[1:55:16] wonders and miracles but obama what is
[1:55:18] the holy ghost
[1:55:20] given for
[1:55:22] he said long as god got a people god's
[1:55:23] got a church god's got the holy ghost
[1:55:25] matching with it that's what god gave
[1:55:27] the holy ghost for intellectual rights
[1:55:29] always have but god's got a minority
[1:55:32] somewhere god's got a little church that
[1:55:34] will move right on with the baptism of
[1:55:36] the holy ghost to claim in the light and
[1:55:38] they'll be the ones that through their
[1:55:40] testimony will judge the world then the
[1:55:42] bible says jesus said blessed are the
[1:55:43] pure heart that they shall see god and
[1:55:45] the other one said the same shall judge
[1:55:47] the earth your testimony today will

[1:56:11] things that god has done to prove that
[1:56:13] he's moving here with the intellectuals
[1:56:15] walk away from it they'll be judged by
[1:56:16] the saints oh my i was talking about
[1:56:19] power of prayer power of speech power
[1:56:22] for holy life that is what the holy
[1:56:24] ghost is to do
[1:56:26] you hear what the holy ghost is to do
[1:56:28] give your power of speech power of
[1:56:30] prayer power deliver holy life some of

[1:56:43] he will put the canter in you oh glory
[1:56:46] to god isn't that right
[1:56:47] praise the name of the lord here where
[1:56:50] we go it's a gift unction to the
[1:56:52] preacher that's what the holy ghost is
[1:56:53] for it's to give holiness to the group
[1:56:55] that's what the holy ghost is for it's
[1:56:57] the church in order that's what the holy
[1:56:59] ghost is for it's to bring a unity of
[1:57:01] the spirit that's what the holy ghost is
[1:57:02] for it's to unite us together with power
[1:57:05] it's to unite us together with love
[1:57:07] brotherly lord
[1:57:08] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:57:11] oh
[1:57:12] hallelujah
[1:57:13] hallelujah
[1:57:15] nobody said this he said upon this
[1:57:17] subject of what the holy ghost he said
[1:57:19] now what what is it now the reason i
[1:57:22] have taken this subject in this line
[1:57:24] like this you cannot come and receive
[1:57:27] the holy spirit unless you know what it
[1:57:29] is you cannot receive it if you know
[1:57:31] what it is unless you believe it's given
[1:57:33] to you and for you and then you cannot
[1:57:36] know whether they got it unless you know
[1:57:37] what results it brings so if you know
[1:57:40] what it is who it's too and what action
[1:57:42] it brings then it comes then you'll know
[1:57:44] when you get it
[1:57:46] what you get when you get it oh praise
[1:57:48] the name of the lord do you believe that
[1:57:51] we are the end time listen that the holy
[1:57:53] ghost does the holy ghost by
[1:57:55] justification just a light shadow of it
[1:57:57] the holy ghost by signification a deeper
[1:57:59] shadow of it the holy ghost by the
[1:58:01] baptism a deeper shadow now the holy
[1:58:04] ghost by the restoration of its very
[1:58:06] person being here the very person of
[1:58:09] christ has to restore back to the church
[1:58:11] he said then we are worshiping the
[1:58:13] living christ him moving in and out
[1:58:15] among us hallelujah that's the seventh
[1:58:17] on the
[1:58:18] revival oh glory to god amen
[1:58:22] hallelujah what is this vision to do
[1:58:25] to hone the bride to a statue of perfect
[1:58:28] man
[1:58:29] oh am i almost done here now
[1:58:30] not almost but i'm gonna wrap up that's
[1:58:32] the way that jesus is going to have to
[1:58:34] be honed on the word horn in the church
[1:58:37] until when christ comes to take the
[1:58:38] church the ministry the church will pick
[1:58:40] up right on it will raise up luther and
[1:58:42] wesley and so on oh praise god he said
[1:58:45] first line justification restaurant by
[1:58:47] three certification the button only goes
[1:58:49] what is it
[1:58:50] you know this is not preached
[1:58:53] this is not preached
[1:58:55] they're not preaching this
[1:58:57] you have to come to justification
[1:58:59] that's where it goes and then what the
[1:59:01] horning
[1:59:02] that's what the ministry is for you see
[1:59:04] if there is no horn and there is no need
[1:59:06] for fightful ministry the fifo ministry
[1:59:08] have to produce the finishing touches
[1:59:11] for the bride
[1:59:12] by the word
[1:59:14] yeah we said watch
[1:59:16] watch the holy ghost bunch being honed
[1:59:19] out
[1:59:21] you can't hone some weird bunch
[1:59:24] it has to become a holy ghost bunch
[1:59:27] only the holy ghost bunch could be honed
[1:59:33] the word hone in israeli using metal
[1:59:36] work
[1:59:37] with fine
[1:59:38] to cut metal to find
[1:59:40] measurements and so on because brother
[1:59:43] find precision because the pyramid is
[1:59:45] accurate it is sharp bronzer impassa
[1:59:48] razor blade it is honed so he said the
[1:59:51] bride has to be honed to be fitted in
[1:59:54] so you have to be willing to adjust your
[1:59:55] attitude and your position to allow the
[1:59:58] spirit to work on you
[2:00:00] because it's not you fitting you have to
[2:00:02] get cut to fit that
[2:00:06] you have to get cut to fit your position
[2:00:10] god is not adjusting the position
[2:00:12] some self-adjusting as you get wide and
[2:00:15] you you do this it bend to suit you no
[2:00:17] god have a cut pattern and we cut get
[2:00:20] cut to that pattern isn't that right now
[2:00:22] the pentecostals have to shape their
[2:00:24] themselves in condition to receive the
[2:00:26] headstone it have to be so horned that
[2:00:29] there won't be a song or hammer or buzz
[2:00:31] of denomination it's already cut out
[2:00:33] well i'm going to skip down
[2:00:34] oh hallelujah ah
[2:00:37] so but abandoned said this this is a
[2:00:39] nice one from conferences he said when
[2:00:41] the church here we go so in the early
[2:00:43] days he talked about horn and as you get
[2:00:45] further down conferences this is 1963
[2:00:48] 8th of june he said when the church
[2:00:51] gets honed
[2:00:52] into the perfect image of jesus christ
[2:00:55] he will come and resurrect all the
[2:00:57] saints when he comes and take them with
[2:00:59] him
[2:01:01] amen so he fine-tune it to horn
[2:01:04] into the image
[2:01:05] in other words you have to be formed
[2:01:07] into the world image we often say that
[2:01:09] image is like material like this
[2:01:11] building here is a building this make of
[2:01:13] cement and and and
[2:01:15] and and steel and so on but but the
[2:01:17] thing about it if you have cement and
[2:01:18] steel and bags and gravel that's not a
[2:01:20] building
[2:01:21] that is material you know when you get
[2:01:23] the drawing and you start to build and
[2:01:25] shape it you have formed it into a
[2:01:26] building well okay but a brand bought
[2:01:28] materials
[2:01:31] and that material could make up the
[2:01:33] building he said rapturing faith is
[2:01:35] leaning the messages
[2:01:37] in other words all the material to hit
[2:01:39] the rapture is in the message
[2:01:41] but god going to raise us some
[2:01:42] scientists
[2:01:44] some ministers
[2:01:45] some people that are going to dig and
[2:01:46] get the material and put it all together
[2:01:48] isn't that right
[2:01:50] here i'll close you this one
[2:01:52] like this part here
[2:01:54] watch how close it gets to that razor
[2:01:56] edge now between right and wrong
[2:01:58] remember it will fall on on on on the
[2:02:00] other side
[2:02:01] till it comes something like a horn
[2:02:03] razor between the difference of right
[2:02:05] and wrong it must be every word not
[2:02:08] almost every word but every word
[2:02:11] hallelujah praise god he said come on
[2:02:13] come on to a razor edge between right
[2:02:15] and wrong
[2:02:16] oh praise god i believe there's coming a
[2:02:18] church that's coming into that
[2:02:20] perfection that ministry of perfection
[2:02:23] where the officers apostles prophet
[2:02:24] teachers evangelists
[2:02:26] them pastors and teachers will be so
[2:02:28] with the word until the whole thing will
[2:02:30] work itself right up to the coming of
[2:02:32] the lord oh praise god the ministry of
[2:02:35] the bride the ministry of christ this
[2:02:37] isn't a token these former treaties of
[2:02:39] theophilus that i wrote to you that
[2:02:41] jesus began to do and continues to do
[2:02:43] his death didn't stop him no sir he
[2:02:45] returned again not a third person but
[2:02:47] the same person returned again in the
[2:02:49] form of the holy ghost to continue to
[2:02:51] work on
[2:02:52] which is another book of acts
[2:02:54] oh hallelujah i'm going to run it
[2:02:56] straight down the conclusion i want to
[2:02:58] get something
[2:02:59] from barakuman here and brother branham
[2:03:01] talk about david's ministry pompeo fake
[2:03:03] strength he says watch he said
[2:03:06] it will not take a doctor he said we
[2:03:08] know what we need a revival we know we
[2:03:10] need a stone amongst the people it will
[2:03:12] not take a doctor of divinity it will
[2:03:14] take weeks that it will take the work
[2:03:16] word of god in the power of the
[2:03:17] resurrection and slay this thing we need
[2:03:20] a david untrained in theological schools
[2:03:22] we need a man who knows nothing about
[2:03:24] that some little plow boy or something
[2:03:26] some little guy with stupid shoulders
[2:03:28] not much to look at but walking on the
[2:03:30] road with the power of god oh praise the
[2:03:33] name of the lord so brother bulma was
[2:03:34] saying this here inspiration came down
[2:03:36] and he said the rock confession
[2:03:38] revelation of christ is directed to the
[2:03:40] intellectual giants stone in the
[2:03:42] forehead this is the holy spirit right

[2:04:34] forward in this vorder gap and bring up
[2:04:36] the mysteries of my malachi for
[2:04:39] one
[2:04:40] the manifested sons will reveal the
[2:04:42] mysteries left by malachi 4 which are
[2:04:45] already revealed
[2:04:48] as the revealed word
[2:04:51] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[2:04:53] only his ministry christ ministry can
[2:04:56] come forward
[2:04:57] the fifo ministry and bring it up and
[2:04:59] show it to you the others cannot do it
[2:05:02] none of the builders can take us
[2:05:03] dignitaries cannot do it because they're
[2:05:05] not ordained to do it
[2:05:06] the manifested sons will reveal the
[2:05:09] mysteries left by malachi 4 which are
[2:05:12] already revealed ephesians 4 11-13 is
[2:05:15] this ministry the manifested sons shall
[2:05:18] speak by prophecy and revelation the
[2:05:21] testament of jesus is the spirit of
[2:05:22] prophecy they will write by they will by
[2:05:25] revelation
[2:05:26] rightly divide the word of god
[2:05:29] and according to ephesians 4 they will
[2:05:32] reveal the secret things and place them
[2:05:34] in the word
[2:05:35] the manifested sun ministry was left on
[2:05:38] purpose for these past 36 years
[2:05:41] just waiting for dynamics to manifest
[2:05:46] the fifo ministry which will be christ
[2:05:50] so then the voice angel moves over to
[2:05:52] ephesians four this will take place
[2:05:55] watch you mean jesus will be in them
[2:05:59] okay no he will call them forth and they
[2:06:02] will go after the lord sheep hidden
[2:06:04] under revelation 22 17.
[2:06:07] this five-fold ministry will not cut off
[2:06:10] people
[2:06:10] they have to have a voice and the voice
[2:06:13] of the fifo ministry and the bride will
[2:06:15] be revelation 22 17 the spirit and the
[2:06:19] bride say come
[2:06:21] that is going to be the final ride to
[2:06:24] the entire world because in there of
[2:06:26] whosoever will come also so indeed your
[2:06:28] family your loved ones your co-workers
[2:06:30] whoever they could come because that
[2:06:32] voice gonna be in the bride that means
[2:06:35] the bride then becomes the word and the
[2:06:37] spirit that came upon jesus comes upon
[2:06:39] the bride so the spirit the bride and
[2:06:41] the prophet will be saying the same
[2:06:42] thing
[2:06:43] come whosoever will it's the final call
[2:06:46] so we can't do like if heaven shorts of
[2:06:49] seats
[2:06:50] and because heaven shorts a seat we
[2:06:53] keeping people out heaven have lots of
[2:06:55] room
[2:06:56] in case you didn't know
[2:06:58] all right so watch the fifo ministry has
[2:07:01] been teaching the word of god and the
[2:07:04] ministry of the word will come forth
[2:07:06] under the ministry of the spirit to
[2:07:08] quicken the bride here we go
[2:07:10] they can only comfort by dynamics
[2:07:15] not by preaching mysteries
[2:07:17] teaching mysteries
[2:07:18] unfolding mysteries no dynamics
[2:07:22] they can do nothing in themselves
[2:07:25] this faithful
[2:07:27] manifested son's ministry
[2:07:29] must come true number one here we go
[2:07:32] they must be born again to begin with
[2:07:35] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:07:37] number two they have to go into a place
[2:07:41] of trying
[2:07:44] to add the life of second peter one four
[2:07:47] through seven
[2:07:48] because the life of this virtue is not a
[2:07:50] gift
[2:07:54] if this life was a gift all god has to
[2:07:56] do is to give it to you
[2:07:58] but this life is character
[2:08:00] and character is never a gift
[2:08:03] character is a victory so they have to
[2:08:05] have tests place that trying grace of
[2:08:08] the wilderness jesus was led by this
[2:08:10] work into the wilderness character is
[2:08:12] what puts there
[2:08:14] god because i got some praises
[2:08:16] just about a few more minutes undone
[2:08:18] but i've got to get this through
[2:08:21] do you say amen
[2:08:23] hello amen
[2:08:25] hallelujah
[2:08:26] okay
[2:08:28] they have to go through
[2:08:30] the place of trying
[2:08:32] to get the life of second peter 1 427
[2:08:35] and galatians 5 22 which is joy love
[2:08:37] peace not anger temper
[2:08:39] and hate and malice and strife and
[2:08:41] jealousy and envy and just plain don't
[2:08:44] write spiritual wickedness
[2:08:47] that is not galatians 9
[2:08:49] nine is peace love joy long suffering
[2:08:51] meek his gentleness long suffering
[2:08:54] not short suffering
[2:08:56] all right
[2:08:58] how can you say jesus in you and this is
[2:09:00] not the lie i have
[2:09:02] life there's no way
[2:09:05] then charity
[2:09:07] okay okay come back up a bit
[2:09:09] they have the life of second peter 147
[2:09:11] galatians 5 22 23 that will have to be a
[2:09:14] requisite listener spot they have to
[2:09:18] have that life
[2:09:20] or they will not be fifo ministry
[2:09:23] because that is jesus
[2:09:26] i said this way in pennsylvania the fifo
[2:09:29] ministry is jesus in the form of five
[2:09:31] offices
[2:09:34] it's not man saying
[2:09:36] you know who i am
[2:09:38] i am one of the fool
[2:09:40] no is that man trying to be
[2:09:42] in the full
[2:09:44] it is jesus
[2:09:46] life
[2:09:47] manifesting in these offices you need
[2:09:50] the evangelist a fireball to win souls
[2:09:53] you need a teacher to nail down the word
[2:09:54] of god you need a pastor who would
[2:09:56] anchor the people and deal with the
[2:09:58] issues among the people you need an
[2:09:59] apostle to go out and help support the
[2:10:02] churches and bring instruction you need
[2:10:04] all the gifts you need a prophet as it
[2:10:05] was you need all the kids to have its
[2:10:07] place
[2:10:10] it is god manifested indeed different
[2:10:12] attributes and offices now what there's
[2:10:14] no way then charity comes down after
[2:10:17] their season out sanification behavior
[2:10:21] and your behavior is your person how you
[2:10:24] behave how many know your behavior as a
[2:10:26] person your behavior is your person so
[2:10:29] christ's behavior is this person could
[2:10:31] you imagine christ gambling could you
[2:10:33] imagine christ stand up to buy a lotta
[2:10:35] ticket
[2:10:37] no you can't imagine that so the seven
[2:10:40] thunder watch and if you have christ in
[2:10:42] you then you will behave like who
[2:10:44] christ
[2:10:45] the seventh and the seed of faith and
[2:10:47] virtue and knowledge and temperance and
[2:10:49] patience and godliness bully kindness
[2:10:50] will be planted in galatians 5 22-23 and
[2:10:54] you will see a nine-fold fruit then
[2:10:56] charity come down after you are seasoned
[2:10:58] out behavior sun vacation to set the
[2:11:00] fifo ministry into the kingdom of god
[2:11:03] and then they are positionally born into
[2:11:04] the kingdom and if and you are
[2:11:06] predestined to be there after being
[2:11:09] adopted and placed positionally in the
[2:11:13] land of the ephesians the promise of the
[2:11:15] holy spirit they will then step into
[2:11:18] this great ephesians adoption ministry
[2:11:21] of the manifested sons of god to shake
[2:11:24] the nations for a short quick ride oh
[2:11:27] praise the name of the lord and this is
[2:11:29] where i thank god for his servant
[2:11:32] brother jesus command because with all
[2:11:33] this light on the word we will just
[2:11:36] think all these sons are there
[2:11:39] where
[2:11:41] now we know they're not dear until they
[2:11:43] go through the same process that jesus
[2:11:46] went through holy ghost baptism
[2:11:48] born for the season power for the season
[2:11:52] then led into the wilderness to be
[2:11:54] formed into the word image oh hallelujah
[2:11:57] i am finished by the stephen come and
[2:11:59] get ready to sing but before that i have
[2:12:03] a scripture
[2:12:04] i want to read to you and that scripture
[2:12:06] is from ezekiel chapter 34. you could
[2:12:10] tune your bibles and you could find it
[2:12:11] or we want to read
[2:12:13] ezekiel
[2:12:14] and we're going to close with that
[2:12:15] scripture
[2:12:17] hallelujah
[2:12:25] and the word of the lord came unto me
[2:12:27] saying
[2:12:28] son of man
[2:12:30] prophesy against the shepherds of israel
[2:12:33] prophesy and say unto them
[2:12:36] thus share the lord god
[2:12:38] unto the shepherds
[2:12:40] this is isaiah 34
[2:12:43] thus saith the lord god unto the
[2:12:45] shepherds will be to the shepherds of
[2:12:47] israel who do feed themselves
[2:12:50] should not the shepherds feed the flocks
[2:12:52] you eat the fat
[2:12:54] you clothe you with wool you kill them
[2:12:56] that are fed
[2:12:58] but you feed not the flock
[2:13:00] the diseased have you not strengthened
[2:13:03] neither have you healed that which was
[2:13:05] sick
[2:13:05] neither have you bunged up that which
[2:13:07] was broken neither have you brought
[2:13:09] again that which was given away neither
[2:13:11] have you brought sought that which was
[2:13:14] lost
[2:13:14] but with force and with cruelty have you
[2:13:17] ruled them
[2:13:19] and they were scattered
[2:13:20] because there was no shepherd
[2:13:22] and they became meat to all the beasts
[2:13:25] of the field when they were scattered
[2:13:27] my sheep wandered through all the
[2:13:29] mountains upon every high hill yeah my
[2:13:31] flock was scattered upon all the face of
[2:13:33] the earth and i none did search or seek
[2:13:36] after them
[2:13:37] therefore ye shepherds hear the word of
[2:13:39] the lord as i live see it the lord god
[2:13:42] surely because my flock became a praying
[2:13:46] and my flock became meat to every beast
[2:13:48] of the field because there was no
[2:13:50] shepherd neither did my shepherd search
[2:13:52] for my flock but the shepherds fed
[2:13:54] themselves and fed up my flock therefore
[2:13:57] o ye shepherds hear the word of the lord
[2:14:00] thus hear the lord god behold i am
[2:14:03] against the shepherds i require my flock
[2:14:06] at their hand
[2:14:07] because there and caused them to cease
[2:14:10] from feeling the flock neither shall the
[2:14:13] shepherds feed themselves anymore for i
[2:14:16] will deliver my flock from their mouth
[2:14:18] and they may not be meat for them
[2:14:20] for thus here the lord god behold i
[2:14:24] even i
[2:14:25] will both search my sheep and seek them
[2:14:28] out as a shepherd seek out his flock in
[2:14:31] the day that he is among his sheep that
[2:14:33] are scattered so will i seek out my
[2:14:35] sheep and will deliver them out of all
