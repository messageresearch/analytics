[29:18] eyes unto the hills from whence cometh
[29:20] my help. My help cometh from the Lord,
[29:22] which made heaven and earth. He will not
[29:25] suffer thy foot to be moved. He that
[29:27] keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold,
[29:30] he that keepeth Israel shall neither
[29:31] slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy
[29:34] keeper. The Lord is thy shade upon thy
[29:36] right hand. The sun shall not smite thee
[29:38] by day nor the moon by night. The Lord
[29:41] shall
[29:42] preserve from all evil. He shall
[29:46] preserve thy soul. The Lord shall
[29:48] preserve thy going out and thy coming in
[29:50] from this time forth and even forever
[29:52] more. Let's just bow our heads as we

[49:09] Praise God. Amen. Amen. So, let's all
[49:12] stand this morning.
[49:14] Amen. I pray that God will speak to our
[49:16] hearts today through his word and by his
[49:19] spirit. Amen. Amen. Just a simple
[49:21] thought I want to share by God's grace
[49:24] and I pray that it will be a blessing to
[49:26] our hearts. God bless you musicians.
[49:28] Thank you very much. Amen. Amen. Let's
[49:31] Bibles three portions of
[49:33] scriptures this morning. Matthew chapter
[49:37] 28, Romans chapter 8, and Revelation
[49:42] chapter 1.
[49:44] Praise the name of the
[49:46] Lord. I'm calling on Brother Gideon and
[49:48] Brother Anthony to pray for me this
[49:50] morning. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[49:55] Glory. But I'm a Christian. Amen. Praise
[49:58] the Lord. Praise God. So, let's just bow
[50:00] our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we
[50:02] approach your word this morning, we pray
[50:04] that you would inspire it and anoint it
[50:07] our hearts. Lord, take us completely out
[50:09] of the way. You come and have your
[50:11] perfect way this morning. Come and
[50:13] change lives. Come and minister to the
[50:15] people this morning, Father. Lord, and
[50:17] hide me behind Calvar's cross and use
[50:20] these words, Lord, to bring on glory to
[50:22] your name, Father, and to edify your
[50:23] people. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[50:27] Matthew chapter 28:es
[50:30] 1-10. Amen.
[50:33] In the end of the Sabbath, as it began
[50:36] to dawn toward the first day of the
[50:39] week came Mary Magdalene and the other
[50:42] Mary to see this
[50:44] epula. And behold, there was a great
[50:47] earthquake, for the angel of the Lord
[50:49] descended from heaven, and came and
[50:52] rolled back the stone from the door and
[50:54] sat upon it. His countenance was like
[50:57] lightning, and his rain white as snow.
[51:01] And for fear of him, the keepers did
[51:04] shake and became as dead
[51:07] men. And the angel answered and said
[51:09] unto the woman, "Fear not ye, for I know
[51:13] that you seek Jesus which was crucified.
[51:16] He is not here, for he is risen, as he
[51:20] said, come see the place where the Lord
[51:24] lay." And so quickly and go quickly and
[51:27] tell his disciples that he is risen from
[51:29] the dead. And behold, he goeth before
[51:31] you into Galilee. There shall you see
[51:34] him. Lo, I have told you. And they
[51:37] departed quickly from the seala with
[51:39] fear and great joy and did run to bring
[51:42] his disciples word. And as they went to
[51:44] tell his disciples, behold Jesus met
[51:46] them, saying, All hail. And they came
[51:50] and held him by the feet and worship
[51:53] him. Then said Jesus unto them, be not
[51:55] afraid. Go tell my brethren that they go
[51:58] into Galilee and there shall they see
[52:02] me. Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh Romans
[52:05] chapter 8 1 verse verse 11. Familiar
[52:09] scripture. But if the spirit of him that
[52:11] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[52:14] you. He that raised up Christ from the
[52:17] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[52:19] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[52:22] you. Amen. Can we say amen? Amen. Amen.
[52:25] In Revelation 1
[52:28] 18, I am he that liveth and was dead,
[52:31] and behold, I am alive forever more.
[52:35] Amen. And have the keys of hell and of
[52:38] death. Praise the name of the Lord.
[52:41] Let's just bow our heads. Father Lord,
[52:43] one more time, we commit everything now
[52:44] into your hands. Have your perfect way.
[52:46] We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[52:50] Praise God. God bless you. May be seated
[52:51] this morning. Hallelujah.
[52:54] Praise God. Amen.
[52:57] So from a message Easter Seal in 1965,
[53:00] Brother was
[53:02] saying of all the days and things that
[53:05] Jesus
[53:06] did, appreciating all of his vindication
[53:09] of God's word and what he did to fulfill
[53:13] it, such as healing the sick, raising
[53:17] the dead, casting out devils, preaching
[53:21] the gospel to the poor, fulfilling every
[53:24] word that God said he would do when he
[53:26] came. Amen.
[53:28] Suffering for our sins in ourstead to be
[53:31] the propitiation for our sin at the
[53:34] cross where no one else would have done
[53:35] it but he did it. Amen. Praise God. But
[53:40] above all of that, the prophet says, I
[53:43] think that Easter sealed the whole
[53:46] thing. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[53:49] It's Easter morning. Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:52] He said prophets before on earth healed
[53:55] the sick.
[53:57] Prophesied raised the dead and did the
[54:00] same signs that Jesus did.
[54:04] He said, "But Easter proved it. It
[54:06] sealed the word of God forever for the
[54:09] true believer." Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[54:12] Amen. All gloom and doubt was shattered
[54:15] that blissful morning 2,000 plus years
[54:18] ago. Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:20] Glory. The glorious gospel, the good
[54:24] news. He is raised from the dead.
[54:27] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[54:30] Amen. Others were raised from the dead,
[54:33] but he died again.
[54:35] But my Lord, he's alive forever more.
[54:39] Can we say amen this morning? Praise
[54:41] God. Never man raised like he did.
[54:44] Praise God. Amen. Amen. I am he that
[54:48] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[54:51] alive forever more. Amen. Hallelujah.
[54:54] Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Give the
[54:57] Lord a hand of praise. Amen.
[55:00] [Applause]
[55:02] And from the message, Jesus Christ the
[55:04] same yesterday, today, and forever. He
[55:06] said if he died and went into a grave,
[55:09] that settled it. He's just another man
[55:12] like Buddha or Muhammad or any of the
[55:15] rest.
[55:17] And if he's not risen from the dead,
[55:19] he's just one of the philosophers,
[55:21] just a prophet.
[55:24] But if he's risen from the dead this
[55:27] morning, then he's God. He's immortal
[55:31] and he's with us now. Praise God. Thank
[55:33] you, Jesus. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. I
[55:37] serve a risen Lord. I serve a risen
[55:40] Lord. Praise God. God's not dead. He is
[55:43] alive. Praise God. I can feel him in my
[55:46] hands. I can feel him in my feet. I can
[55:49] feel him in my heart. Praise God. Amen.
[55:52] Somebody give him praise this morning.
[55:55] Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. He's not a God of
[55:57] brick and stone. He is almighty, all
[56:01] powerful, omnipotent, omniscient,
[56:04] omnipresent God all by himself. Give him
[56:07] praise this morning. Thank you, Jesus.
[56:09] Oh yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[56:12] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Say amen.
[56:15] Glory.
[56:17] And from the message my redeemer liveth.
[56:20] I think that Easter is one of the
[56:22] greatest times.
[56:24] Amen. Listen to this. Are you ready?
[56:27] If there ever was a time that full
[56:29] gospel, Pentecostal, born again,
[56:33] regenerated people ought to shout the
[56:35] praises of God. It's on Easter morning.
[56:38] Praise God. Hallelujah. Somebody give
[56:39] the Lord a hand of praise. Hallelujah.
[56:42] Give the Lord a shout. Amen. Praise God.
[56:44] Amen. This is Easter morning. Amen.
[56:47] Glory. When you know that Easter is a
[56:50] memorial of what has happened to you.
[56:53] You were once dead in trespasses and
[56:55] sin, but now you are raised up and
[56:58] seated in Christ in heavenly places and
[57:01] knowing that your redeemer lives.
[57:05] Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[57:08] Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to
[57:11] God. Amen. Thank you, Father. Glory. So
[57:15] this morning, Easter means life. Easter
[57:20] means resurrection.
[57:21] Easter means hope. There's hope for you
[57:24] this morning. Don't despair. Let me
[57:28] encourage you this morning. Don't give
[57:30] up. I don't care how bad it seems. I
[57:33] don't care how low you may be. But happy
[57:36] Easter. Happy Easter. Shalom. Praise
[57:39] God. The sen of God is risen. Give the
[57:43] Lord a shout. Praise God. Thank you,
[57:45] Jesus.
[57:48] Amen. He's alive to bring you life. He's
[57:51] alive to bring you joy and salvation and
[57:55] redemption and healing and restoration
[57:58] and revival and whatsoever you have need
[58:02] of this morning. Praise God. Give him a
[58:04] shout. Hallelujah.
[58:07] Yes, Lord. It's the rising of the sun.
[58:10] Because he lives, you can face tomorrow.
[58:14] Because he lives, all fear is gone. Fear
[58:18] not. Don't be afraid. He's here to seal
[58:21] you up with a true Easter seal this
[58:24] morning. Yes, Lord. Give him a hand of
[58:26] praise. Yes, Lord. Thank you,
[58:28] Jesus. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[58:32] Amen. Amen. Glory. Amen. Are you happy
[58:36] this morning?
[58:38] Praise God. Amen. So, God bless you this
[58:41] morning. My title is the purpose of the
[58:45] resurrection.
[58:47] I hope not to be too long with you this
[58:49] morning. Trust we'd be edified along the
[58:52] way. Amen. So, let's go back to the
[58:55] beginning. God bless you.
[58:58] So in Genesis chapter 2 verse
[59:01] 9 it says and out of the ground made the
[59:05] Lord God to grow every tree that is
[59:08] pleasant to the sight and good for food.
[59:12] The tree of life also in the midst of
[59:14] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[59:17] good and evil. Verse 16. And the Lord
[59:21] commanded a man saying of every tree of
[59:23] the garden thou mayest eat freely.
[59:27] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[59:29] evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in
[59:33] the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
[59:35] shalt surely die. Amen.
[59:40] So God placed Adam in the garden and
[59:42] give him dominion over the earth.
[59:44] Adam could say, "Let this mountain be
[59:46] moved over here and it would do it."
[59:49] "Let this tree be plucked up and planted
[59:52] over here and it would do it." Amen.
[59:55] Amen. For he had a complete supreme
[59:58] control as a minor God under God our
[1:00:01] father because he was a son of God. Can
[1:00:04] we say amen?
[1:00:05] Amen.
[1:00:07] Adam had eternal life. He was supposed
[1:00:11] to live forever.
[1:00:14] There was no sickness, no sin, no
[1:00:16] sorrow, no fear, no death.
[1:00:20] But man in a perfect condition, man in a
[1:00:24] perfect state, man in a perfect envir
[1:00:27] environment disobeyed God's
[1:00:30] instructions.
[1:00:32] My do whatever you want. Eat whatever
[1:00:35] you want, but don't touch that tree of
[1:00:37] knowledge of good and evil. For the day
[1:00:39] you eat thereof, that day you will die.
[1:00:42] My
[1:00:44] amen. And Eve reasoned with Satan.
[1:00:48] Satan brought doubt to God's word,
[1:00:53] reasoning and questions, confusion and
[1:00:56] uncertainty,
[1:00:58] brother. Anytime thoughts come to
[1:01:00] question the word of God, that's the
[1:01:02] devil right there. Say amen. Praise God.
[1:01:05] Amen. Amen. Don't entertain him. Resist
[1:01:09] the devil and he will flee. Praise God.
[1:01:11] Amen. Satan is the tree of knowledge of
[1:01:14] good and evil. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:18] And Adam chose to go the way Eve went.
[1:01:22] Adam was not deceived like Eve, but he
[1:01:25] chose to turn loose on the word and sold
[1:01:28] out. My Amen. My amen. The tree of life
[1:01:32] produced eternal life. But the tree of
[1:01:35] knowledge of good and evil produced
[1:01:38] death. Amen. Can we say amen? Amen.
[1:01:42] from the
[1:01:43] breach. Baram says, "Adam lost his
[1:01:46] inheritance, the
[1:01:48] earth. Now it passed from his hand to
[1:01:51] the one he sold out to Satan.
[1:01:54] He sold his faith in God to Satan's
[1:01:58] reasonings.
[1:02:00] Therefore, his eternal
[1:02:02] life, his right to the tree of life, his
[1:02:06] right to the earth belonged to him. And
[1:02:09] he forfeited every bit to the hands of
[1:02:12] Satan. He passed it from his hand to
[1:02:15] Satan.
[1:02:17] My from the Ephesian church
[1:02:20] age, man did partake of the other tree.
[1:02:23] And when he did, death entered into him
[1:02:27] by his sin and he became separated from
[1:02:31] God.
[1:02:35] So sin brought a separation. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:39] Man lost his perfect fellowship with
[1:02:41] God. Amen. His godship,
[1:02:44] his dominion over all things,
[1:02:47] his home, the earth, he lost it. He lost
[1:02:51] spoken word power and he lost all the
[1:02:54] inheritance in life.
[1:02:57] But then he lost life itself.
[1:03:01] My he lost eternal life. My amen. The
[1:03:06] scripture said in that day thou eatest
[1:03:09] thou shalt surely die.
[1:03:12] And the Bible said with God a thousand
[1:03:14] years is like one day.
[1:03:17] No man has ever lived for more than one
[1:03:19] day. Methuselah lived for 969 years
[1:03:23] which is still less than one day. Adam
[1:03:26] himself lived for 930 years.
[1:03:31] My and over time life was cut short to
[1:03:36] 70 years now. Three score and 10. My
[1:03:40] amen. Some people don't even cross 40.
[1:03:45] My but man originally was not supposed
[1:03:48] to die. Man was supposed to live
[1:03:51] forever. Can we say amen? Amen. Brother
[1:03:55] Brandham said it was God's purpose for
[1:03:58] man to live eternally or to share his
[1:04:02] eternal life with man. Amen. But death
[1:04:07] comes in.
[1:04:10] Tell me, what is it that any human being
[1:04:14] dreads the most?
[1:04:18] The fear of death. Amen. Am I going to
[1:04:21] die? You get sick. You want to You want
[1:04:24] to know am I going to die? Since the
[1:04:26] fall of man, Satan has used the weapon
[1:04:29] of death over the human race.
[1:04:33] God, you said they shall surely die. And
[1:04:36] you can't break your own word. So every
[1:04:39] man must die. My That's the devil. Amen.
[1:04:44] Adam
[1:04:46] died. Noah died. Abraham, the father of
[1:04:50] faith, he died. Job with all his
[1:04:53] patience died.
[1:04:56] Every man is born to die. Satan uses his
[1:05:00] power of death to lock up humanity as it
[1:05:03] were. Good or bad. Christian or
[1:05:07] non-Christian must die. It's a law of
[1:05:10] life. You have an appointment with death
[1:05:12] as it were. Amen.
[1:05:16] And Satan held the keys of death and
[1:05:18] hell and the grave.
[1:05:21] Not the deed to the earth but the keys
[1:05:24] of death, hell and the grave. My death
[1:05:28] that became a curse. We call it the
[1:05:31] curse of death. My my my amen. Amen.
[1:05:37] From a message greatest battle ever
[1:05:39] fought. Abraham says there are only two
[1:05:42] powers and two
[1:05:44] kingdoms. Yes. All the other minor
[1:05:48] things are connected with one of these
[1:05:50] two powers.
[1:05:52] Amen. It's God's power or Satan's power.
[1:05:56] Amen. And that's the power of life and
[1:05:58] the power of death. Praise God. Amen.
[1:06:02] Satan has got perverted power. It's no
[1:06:06] real power. It's a perversion of God's
[1:06:09] power. Everything that Satan has is
[1:06:12] perverted. Amen. Example, death is only
[1:06:16] life perverted.
[1:06:18] A lie is the truth mistold.
[1:06:22] Adultery is a righteous act misused.
[1:06:26] Everything that Satan has is something
[1:06:28] that was perverted. But it's still a
[1:06:31] power. Can we say amen? Amen. And these
[1:06:35] two powers, these two kingdoms are
[1:06:38] constantly in battle.
[1:06:41] Darkness versus light. Amen. Sickness
[1:06:44] versus health. Evil versus good. Death
[1:06:48] versus life. Oh my
[1:06:51] glory. All the differences between
[1:06:53] nations. Differences between each other.
[1:06:57] Differences in the family. Praise God.
[1:06:59] All everything.
[1:07:02] All monks up to two powers. God's power
[1:07:05] or Satan's power. My two influencers.
[1:07:09] Amen. Which one is influencing your
[1:07:12] life? this morning. You have to know
[1:07:14] that. Amen. Are you being influenced
[1:07:17] from above or are you from below? Amen.
[1:07:21] Abraham says, "Satan and all his
[1:07:23] corruption and deception is influencing
[1:07:26] and empowering the young ladies and the
[1:07:28] young men out there on the street to
[1:07:30] drink and cuss and swear and act in
[1:07:33] vulgar ways."
[1:07:36] Check yourself when you act. What is
[1:07:38] influencing you? What is influencing me?
[1:07:41] this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:45] Amen.
[1:07:47] Satan wants to destroy you. He's roaming
[1:07:50] through the streets like a roaring lion
[1:07:53] seeking whom he may devour. That's
[1:07:56] Satan's domain. Amen. Trying to pull
[1:08:01] your soul down to hell. Yes. It's a
[1:08:04] battle for souls. Two two powers
[1:08:07] constantly at war. One pulling up into
[1:08:10] heavenly places and one pulling down to
[1:08:13] hell. Who is influencing your life
[1:08:16] today?
[1:08:18] Amen. Amen. Amen. It's not your friend.
[1:08:22] It's not the internet. It's not the
[1:08:25] church. It's not even you. Sometimes we
[1:08:28] say, "Nobody can't make me do nothing."
[1:08:32] Oh yes, it's either God or Satan.
[1:08:36] Satan in the form of a friend.
[1:08:38] Satan in the music. Satan in the movies.
[1:08:41] Oh yes. Demon powers loosed upon the
[1:08:44] earth. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] And Satan tries to glamorize his power.
[1:08:52] He brings fear and all these things. But
[1:08:57] his power is limited. Oh, glory to God.
[1:09:00] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:09:04] The greatest power that the devil has
[1:09:07] ends at death.
[1:09:10] Beyond death, he can go no further.
[1:09:12] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:15] Amen. So he uses it to beat every
[1:09:18] Christian, beat every prophet, beat
[1:09:21] every disciple, beat every human being.
[1:09:24] The grim reaper come in with a sting of
[1:09:26] death. Amen. The power of Satan is the
[1:09:30] power of death.
[1:09:33] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:36] All the saints of the Old Testament were
[1:09:38] held captive after death.
[1:09:42] Glory to God. Oh, but thank God, there's
[1:09:45] another power this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] It's called the power of God. It's
[1:09:50] called the power of the resurrection.
[1:09:52] Can we say amen?
[1:09:55] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Satan can take
[1:09:59] life, but Jesus said, "I am the
[1:10:01] resurrection and the life." Hallelujah.
[1:10:04] He that believeth in me, though he were
[1:10:06] dead, yet shall he live. Praise God.
[1:10:10] Amen. Praise God. Amen. Who's got the
[1:10:13] real power this morning? Who's got the
[1:10:15] real power this morning?
[1:10:18] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:21] Glory. Hallelujah. So, Satan's power is
[1:10:24] to take a clean vessel and defile it.
[1:10:27] perverted power.
[1:10:29] Take a healthy man and make him sick.
[1:10:32] God has to give permission or to allow
[1:10:34] it first. He has no creative power. He's
[1:10:38] only a perverter.
[1:10:41] Take a living soul and pervert it with
[1:10:43] death. Natural death, spiritual death.
[1:10:46] My
[1:10:48] Satan's powers are li limited up to
[1:10:52] death and he can go no further. Amen.
[1:10:55] Amen. And brother Billy Paul say, "Poor
[1:10:57] devil." Amen. Poor devil. Satan brings
[1:11:01] sickness. But God will use that
[1:11:04] situation to build your faith and to
[1:11:07] show you that he is a healer.
[1:11:09] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Glory to
[1:11:12] God. He's Jehovah Rafa. Praise God.
[1:11:14] Hallelujah.
[1:11:17] Amen. Satan mashes you down to the
[1:11:19] ground, but God said, I shall restore,
[1:11:22] sayeth the Lord. He's going to restore
[1:11:25] you this morning. Praise God. Amen.
[1:11:27] Hallelujah.
[1:11:29] Hallelujah. God works out everything for
[1:11:32] your good and for his glory. Hallelujah.
[1:11:36] Testify of his goodness this morning.
[1:11:39] Oh, hallelujah. Romans 8:28. For we know
[1:11:42] all things work together for good to
[1:11:44] them that love God. Amen. To them that
[1:11:47] are the called, praise God according to
[1:11:48] his purpose. Glory. Amen. Amen. Give the
[1:11:51] Lord a hand of praise. Thank you Jesus.
[1:11:55] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:58] Yes Lord. Amen. Testify of the goodness
[1:12:01] of Jesus. Amen.
[1:12:04] Glory.
[1:12:06] So let's press on. Job had a concern
[1:12:09] about death.
[1:12:12] And from the message I am the
[1:12:13] resurrection and
[1:12:14] life. Job knew that the creator made all
[1:12:17] of his creation. Amen. He noticed that
[1:12:20] in the creation there was a resurrection
[1:12:23] of botany life and so forth from winter
[1:12:26] time to springtime.
[1:12:29] But he said a man lay down he give it up
[1:12:32] the ghost he wastes away and where is
[1:12:35] he? What happened to that man?
[1:12:40] Job in 14 chapter
[1:12:43] 14:12 man lith down and riseth not till
[1:12:47] the heavens be no more they shall not
[1:12:50] awake nor be raised out of their sleep.
[1:12:55] Verse 14 if a man die shall he live
[1:12:58] again.
[1:13:00] So he was concerned. He was troubled
[1:13:03] even. And brother Brandham says, "Then
[1:13:06] he saw by vision the coming of the just
[1:13:09] one." Oh, praise God. Amen. Job knew he
[1:13:13] was a sinner. And the reason a man had
[1:13:16] to lay down and not rise up, there was
[1:13:18] nothing could speak for him.
[1:13:22] He knew that the flower had done nothing
[1:13:24] wrong. Hallelujah. It was brought here
[1:13:27] for God's purpose. So when the flower
[1:13:29] died, it could raise again.
[1:13:33] But when a man had sinned, there was no
[1:13:35] way for him to ever rise in the presence
[1:13:37] of his maker. Hallelujah.
[1:13:41] Job in this condition of trial and
[1:13:43] hardness and sickness,
[1:13:46] hardship. He was permitted by God to see
[1:13:49] the just one. Hallelujah. What did Job
[1:13:53] see? Listen to this. Abraham said, "Job
[1:13:58] saw a man who could put his hand on a
[1:14:00] sinful man and a holy God that would
[1:14:04] bridge the way." Praise God. Between a
[1:14:07] sinful man and a holy God. Amen. Praise
[1:14:12] God. Job saw the son of God. Oh, praise
[1:14:15] God. Amen. He saw the son of God could
[1:14:18] put his hand on a sinful man and a holy
[1:14:21] God and bridge the way between. Praise
[1:14:23] God. He saw it. He saw it. Amen.
[1:14:27] Hallelujah. And then when the spirit of
[1:14:29] God came upon the prophet, the thunders
[1:14:32] began to roar and the lightning flashed
[1:14:34] and Job stood up from his ash sheep and
[1:14:37] he cried out, "Oh, that my words were
[1:14:41] now written and printed in a book craven
[1:14:43] with an iron pen and in inscribed on the
[1:14:46] rock forever. For I know my redeemer
[1:14:50] liveth and that he shall stand in the
[1:14:52] latter day upon the earth." Oh, praise
[1:14:55] God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen.
[1:14:57] Hallelujah.
[1:14:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] Job did not stop there. He knew he would
[1:15:06] still die. So he said, "And though after
[1:15:09] my skin worms destroy this body, yet in
[1:15:12] my flesh, my flesh, shall I see God, my
[1:15:17] eyes shall behold him and not another."
[1:15:20] Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:15:22] Hallelujah.
[1:15:24] Hallelujah. Job knew that if he died,
[1:15:26] that's okay. But there's coming a
[1:15:28] resurrection. He saw it. He saw it.
[1:15:32] Praise God. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:15:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:36] Amen. Glory.
[1:15:39] Amen. Brother Brandham said, "Job must
[1:15:42] have seen a vision of Easter." Oh, glory
[1:15:44] to God. Amen. Hallelujah. He must have
[1:15:47] seen a vision of Easter. Glory to God.
[1:15:49] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:15:52] What do you know, Job?
[1:15:54] I know my redeemer living. The one who
[1:15:58] will redeem me is alive.
[1:16:02] Not only was there someone living, but
[1:16:05] he was a redeemer to Job. Oh, glory to
[1:16:08] God. Amen. So, redemption is at the
[1:16:12] center of the resurrection. Oh, yes,
[1:16:15] Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I
[1:16:18] know. I know. Do you know this morning?
[1:16:21] I know that my redeemer lives.
[1:16:23] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:16:27] But Brandham said, "We got too much
[1:16:29] guessing." Christians
[1:16:32] guessing guessing whether God is real.
[1:16:35] Guessing whether God is alive. He said,
[1:16:37] "You've got to know by revelation." And
[1:16:40] Job said, "I know my redeemer lives. I
[1:16:43] know my red redeemer lives." This
[1:16:45] morning, he lives within my heart. Give
[1:16:47] the Lord a shout. Give the Lord a praise
[1:16:50] this morning. Thank you, Jesus. Praise
[1:16:53] God. Amen.
[1:16:57] Daniel saw an angel in the lion's den.
[1:17:00] The Hebrew boss boys saw the son of God
[1:17:03] in the fire. Noah saw the rainbow after
[1:17:06] the flood. Abraham saw God face to face.
[1:17:10] But Job, he saw the resurrection. Oh,
[1:17:13] glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:17:18] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:20] All the patriarchs, all the great saints
[1:17:23] of the Bible look forward to that day
[1:17:26] with assurance through visions, through
[1:17:28] revelations that there would come a time
[1:17:31] of resurrection. Amen. And Easter means
[1:17:35] resurrection. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise
[1:17:39] God. Glory for the message. I
[1:17:43] know you look at the sun and we know
[1:17:46] it's the power of God that brings the
[1:17:48] world around the sun. Can we say amen?
[1:17:51] Amen. You watch at springtime how all
[1:17:54] the flowers and leaves return and you
[1:17:57] know it's God.
[1:17:59] You see a man blind from birth healed. A
[1:18:02] deaf man's air pop open. You know it's
[1:18:04] God.
[1:18:05] But what if that was all there was and
[1:18:08] then we died and we were gone? Oh
[1:18:11] no. Praise God. But Easter time, the
[1:18:15] resurrection is what sealed everything
[1:18:17] that God ever promised this morning. Can
[1:18:20] we say amen?
[1:18:22] Amen. The Easter time is resurrection.
[1:18:25] Glory. Joseph said, "Don't you move my
[1:18:29] bones from here until you go to the
[1:18:31] promised land. And when you get there,
[1:18:34] bury me up there with the rest of my
[1:18:36] fathers." Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:18:39] Joseph knew the resurrection was coming
[1:18:42] when Jesus the redeemer rose from the
[1:18:45] dead. He knew what Job had said. Amen.
[1:18:49] Glory. Amen.
[1:18:51] Glory. So although death stung the Old
[1:18:55] Testament scenes, yet they had a hope of
[1:18:58] the resurrection. Can we say amen? Amen.
[1:19:01] In the Bible, Elijah raised the boy from
[1:19:03] the dead. In the New Testament, Peter
[1:19:06] raised the young man from the dead.
[1:19:08] Jesus himself raised the dead three
[1:19:10] times. He was the tree of life, Christ.
[1:19:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:16] Glory.
[1:19:19] And he raised the first in the first
[1:19:22] instance he raised Gyrus's daughter from
[1:19:24] the dead. Amen. Remember that that that
[1:19:27] miracle. Amen. When he arrived at the
[1:19:29] house, they were mourning and weeping.
[1:19:33] Jesus said, "Weep not. She is not dead.
[1:19:36] She sleepeth. And he took her by the
[1:19:39] hand and called saying, "Talitha,
[1:19:41] arise." What voice was that? The voice
[1:19:45] of the resurrection. He was
[1:19:47] demonstrating resurrection power, the
[1:19:49] power of life. Can we say amen? Yes,
[1:19:53] Lord. He was always demonstrating it.
[1:19:55] Amen. Another time in the city of Na,
[1:19:59] the old the only son of a widow woman
[1:20:01] had died and she was distraught.
[1:20:05] Death is no respector of persons. And
[1:20:08] Jesus had compassion on her and said,
[1:20:10] "Weep not." He touched the coffin and
[1:20:13] said, "Young man, arise." And the young
[1:20:16] man sat upright and began to speak. What
[1:20:19] is it? Resurrection power. Jesus is
[1:20:23] demonstrating, praise God, that wherever
[1:20:25] Jesus is, death can stay there. Praise
[1:20:27] God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:35] This morning, all power that was in God,
[1:20:38] he poured into Christ. And all power
[1:20:41] that was in Christ, he pours into the
[1:20:44] church. Praise God. Can we say amen? Can
[1:20:47] we say amen? Amen. It's John 14, he that
[1:20:50] believeth in me. The works that I do
[1:20:52] shall he do also. This is a promise this
[1:20:56] morning. This is a promise. Praise God.
[1:20:59] The bride is flesh of his flesh, bone of
[1:21:02] his bone, life of his life, and power of
[1:21:06] his power. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:21:08] Give the Lord a hand of
[1:21:09] praise. Amen. In the church of the
[1:21:12] living God lays power to heal all
[1:21:15] sickness. In the church of the living
[1:21:17] God lays power to overcome all
[1:21:19] temptations. In the church of the living
[1:21:22] God lays the power to take sin and chain
[1:21:25] it and throw it away. Praise God. Amen.
[1:21:28] You can receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:31] Ghost this morning. Praise God. Amen.
[1:21:33] Give the Lord a shout. Give the Lord a
[1:21:35] shout. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to
[1:21:38] God. Amen.
[1:21:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] Hallelujah.
[1:21:46] Abraham say, I will give him the church
[1:21:48] a charge of my dynamics that this world
[1:21:51] will not be able to withstand it and
[1:21:54] I'll raise him up again at the last day.
[1:21:56] Amen. mechanics and dynamics together.
[1:21:59] Can we say amen? Oh, glory. Yes, Lord.
[1:22:02] Amen.
[1:22:04] Jesus again. The final time Jesus raises
[1:22:08] the dead. Jesus got word that Lazarus
[1:22:12] was sick. Yes. And he dismissed it and
[1:22:15] said, "The sickness is not unto death,
[1:22:18] but for the glory of God." Amen.
[1:22:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory.
[1:22:24] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:27] And after two days, he said, "I go wake
[1:22:30] Lazarus."
[1:22:32] The disciples thought that Lazarus was
[1:22:34] physically
[1:22:36] asleep. Jesus said plainly, "Lazarus is
[1:22:38] dead." My God. Amen.
[1:22:42] When Jesus arrived, Lazarus was already
[1:22:46] dead four days.
[1:22:49] Martha, his sister, said unto Jesus,
[1:22:52] Lord, if thou were here, my brother
[1:22:54] would not have died. Jesus said, "Thy
[1:22:57] brother shall rise again." Jesus was
[1:22:59] prophesying. Amen. Martha said, "I know
[1:23:02] that he shall rise again in the
[1:23:04] resurrection at the last day." Maybe she
[1:23:06] was quoting from Job.
[1:23:08] But Jesus said, "I am the resurrection
[1:23:11] and the life. He that believeth in me,
[1:23:14] though he were dead, yet shall he live."
[1:23:17] Thank you, Lord. He was the tree of
[1:23:20] life, present tense.
[1:23:22] He had the power of life. He had the
[1:23:25] power of resurrection laying inside of
[1:23:28] him. Praise God. Amen.
[1:23:30] I am Martha. I am whatever you have need
[1:23:33] of right now. And Martha, we have a dead
[1:23:36] brother here. We need resurrection now.
[1:23:39] Amen. Not in the general resurrection.
[1:23:42] Hallelujah. But now. Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:23:45] Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Now faith is
[1:23:49] praise God. A morning right now. Amen.
[1:23:51] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:23:54] Amen.
[1:23:56] The Bible said Jesus groan within
[1:23:58] himself.
[1:24:00] When he reached the grave,
[1:24:03] he said roll away the stone.
[1:24:06] Matthew said, "Lord," he stinkketh.
[1:24:08] Jesus said, "If thou would believe, you
[1:24:10] would see the glory of God." How many
[1:24:13] believe the I am is here this morning.
[1:24:15] How many believe this morning? Raise
[1:24:17] your hand if you believe the I am is
[1:24:19] here this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:24:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Present tense.
[1:24:23] Amen. Then you shall see the glory of
[1:24:26] God. Give the Lord a shout. Give the
[1:24:28] Lord a shout. Praise God. Amen.
[1:24:32] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:24:35] Thank you, Lord. Now faith
[1:24:38] is the Bible said, "And Jesus communed
[1:24:41] with the father." Then he said with a
[1:24:44] loud voice,
[1:24:46] "Lazarus, come forth." And Lazarus came
[1:24:50] back to life because corruption knew its
[1:24:53] maker. Oh, praise God. The power of the
[1:24:57] resurrection. Who's got the power this
[1:24:59] morning? Who's got the power this
[1:25:01] morning? Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:25:04] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. What voice
[1:25:08] was that that Jesus used? Glory. What
[1:25:12] voice? What voice? Amen.
[1:25:15] From the rapture. Shout. Voice. Trump.
[1:25:20] The shout is a messenger getting the
[1:25:22] people ready.
[1:25:24] The second is the voice of the
[1:25:26] resurrection. The same voice. The same
[1:25:29] voice. That loud voice that called
[1:25:32] Lazarus from the grave. Hallelujah. The
[1:25:35] voice of the resurrection. Brother
[1:25:37] Abraham said, "If Jesus did not call
[1:25:38] Lazarus by name, all the old saints that
[1:25:42] died would have resurrected right
[1:25:44] there." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:25:47] God. Amen. Glory. Come on now. Thank
[1:25:49] you, Jesus. Who's got the power? Praise
[1:25:52] God. The power of the resurrection. The
[1:25:54] voice of the resurrection. Praise God.
[1:25:57] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[1:26:00] from the Leoian church here. Praise God.
[1:26:03] Hallelujah. When the Methodist failed,
[1:26:07] God raised up others. And so it has gone
[1:26:10] through the years until listen, are you
[1:26:13] ready? Amen. Are you ready? In this last
[1:26:16] day, there is again another people in
[1:26:19] the land. Who under their messenger will
[1:26:22] be the final voice to the final age. He
[1:26:25] is talking about you. Praise God. Give
[1:26:27] the Lord a shout. Amen. His bride. Amen.
[1:26:32] The voice of God will be in the bride.
[1:26:35] The spirit and the bride would say,
[1:26:36] "Come once more." The world will hear
[1:26:39] direct from God as at Pentecost. Give
[1:26:42] the Lord a hand of praise this morning.
[1:26:45] Can we say amen? Oh, praise God. The
[1:26:49] sleeping saints back there cannot be
[1:26:52] made perfect without us. They are
[1:26:54] depending on us. We've got to come to
[1:26:56] perfection to call them a praise God.
[1:26:59] Amen. Give the Lord a shout. Give the
[1:27:02] Lord a shout. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:27:04] Lord. Amen. Glory to God. Thank you,
[1:27:07] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Glory.
[1:27:13] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] So, in the beginning, when man fell,
[1:27:19] it plunged the whole of mankind under
[1:27:22] the curse of sin, under the dominion of
[1:27:25] sin.
[1:27:27] Adam lost everything.
[1:27:30] the deed of ownership for the earth, all
[1:27:33] his inheritance in life,
[1:27:36] and then eternal life itself.
[1:27:40] Amen.
[1:27:42] But God purpose to bring man back to
[1:27:44] Eden, back to his original estate and
[1:27:48] back to eternal life. Oh yes, Lord.
[1:27:53] Amen. Eternal life is God's own life.
[1:27:55] It's precious. Amen. Glory. Amen. The
[1:27:59] price had to be paid. Man had to be
[1:28:02] cleaned up again. Man had to be reborn.
[1:28:06] Man must be set free from the curse.
[1:28:10] Man needed to be redeemed by a kinsman.
[1:28:13] It would take blood. It would take blood
[1:28:16] of an innocent one. Praise God.
[1:28:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:24] Hallelujah. what the Holy Ghost was
[1:28:25] given for. No other blood would sanctify
[1:28:28] people. All of us were born through
[1:28:31] sexual desires. But Jesus was born
[1:28:34] outside of this. Oh, glory to God. So
[1:28:38] his blood was the
[1:28:40] sanctifier. Oh,
[1:28:42] praise God. Thank you, Jesus. God from
[1:28:46] heaven came down, made a body, lived in
[1:28:50] it, shed that blood for the sanctifying
[1:28:54] of of us. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:57] He sanctified us. Praise God. Give him a
[1:29:00] praise this morning. Give him a praise.
[1:29:02] Amen.
[1:29:04] Glory.
[1:29:06] Glory to God. Amen. And that absolutely
[1:29:10] expelled the guilt of sin and shame.
[1:29:14] Glory to God. God as a songwriter say
[1:29:16] what sin amen praise God amen give the
[1:29:18] Lord a hand of praise absolutely expel
[1:29:21] the guilt of sin and shame praise God
[1:29:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:29] so Romans 5 by the offense of one man
[1:29:33] Adam yes judgment came upon all men to
[1:29:38] condemnation
[1:29:40] even so by the righteousness of one
[1:29:44] Christ the free gift came upon all men
[1:29:48] unto justification of life. Hallelujah.
[1:29:52] Can we say amen?
[1:29:54] Romans 5:19.
[1:29:56] For by one man's disobedience, many were
[1:29:59] made sinners. So by the obedience of one
[1:30:03] shall many be made righteous. Give the
[1:30:07] Lord a hand of praise this morning.
[1:30:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:13] So Jesus died on the cross and paid a
[1:30:17] price and they laid him in a
[1:30:21] tomb. He was a conqueror
[1:30:24] on the cross. He died like a
[1:30:27] man from the message the tunement.
[1:30:31] Prophet said Jesus was not idle when he
[1:30:34] was in the tomb.
[1:30:37] He was not just lying there dead. Oh
[1:30:40] glory. He said he was still conquering.
[1:30:43] Oh, hallelujah. I have power to lay my
[1:30:46] body down and raise it back up again in
[1:30:49] three days. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Oh, glory. He
[1:30:57] went down and took the keys away from
[1:30:59] Satan.
[1:31:01] And now he's got the keys of death,
[1:31:04] hell, and the grave this morning. Can we

[1:38:11] forsaken me. He died like a man.
[1:38:15] But on Easter morning, he ignored the
[1:38:18] Roman seal of the soldiers. And death
[1:38:20] itself released its pain. He rose from
[1:38:23] the dead and proved he was God. Give him

[1:39:09] It's an abstract deed with it that God
[1:39:13] required life for death in the Garden of
[1:39:16] Eden.
[1:39:19] Then Jesus, the righteous one, died and
[1:39:22] took a title
[1:39:24] deed and was able to break the seals,
[1:39:28] reveal what was in them, and give the
[1:39:32] inheritance that belong to him to his

[1:48:04] My my my my He saw Jesus rose from the
[1:48:08] dead. But yet all the disciples and all
[1:48:12] the apostles still went down in the

[1:48:18] Paul was not afraid, but he still died.
[1:48:22] Poor devil. He had no
[1:48:25] revelation. Hallelujah. He did
[1:48:27] understand that Jesus was the first
[1:48:29] fruit of them that slept. My my my my.

[1:49:05] changed. Some of us shall not see death.
[1:49:09] There is going to be a rapture. I don't
[1:49:11] care how old-fashioned it seems, but
[1:49:13] there's going to be a rapture. Give the

[1:49:35] The dead in Christ shall rise first, and

[1:50:04] For the trumpet of God shall sound, and
[1:50:07] those who are asleep or resting shall
[1:50:10] wake up first and take on immortality.
[1:50:14] Then we who are alive on that day after
[1:50:18] they have done raised up. Then we shall
[1:50:21] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:50:23] of an eye and meet with them and then go
[1:50:26] up to meet the Lord in the air to be
[1:50:28] caught up together with them. Can we say
[1:50:31] amen?
[1:50:33] But man says whether you sleep or
[1:50:36] whether you don't, whether you are
[1:50:38] buried or not even buried at all, you're
[1:50:40] coming anyhow. Give him a praise. Give

[2:28:19] as much as we can toward the convention
[2:28:22] that God will move in a mighty way that
[2:28:25] he will put his hand upon whatever
[2:28:27] minister would come to the platform to
[2:28:29] minister here to the people by the grace
[2:28:31] of God. that spirit of God will flow and
[2:28:34] that lives will be changed, that old dry
[2:28:36] hearts will be soaked with the reign of
[2:28:38] his presence, that people receive the
[2:28:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost, that young
[2:28:42] people will be changed and transformed
[2:28:44] and and uh and and put on fire for God.
[2:28:47] So you put all that before God in prayer
[2:28:51] and you solicit your prayers for the
[2:28:53] convention and we pray that things will
[2:28:54] work out both in the natural and in the
[2:28:57] spiritual as well with the hotel
[2:28:59] arrangements and everything that we know
