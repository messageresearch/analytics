[10:56] Father we thank you tonight for guiding
[10:58] us together and we are waiting upon you
[11:02] Lord we feel like Shad Mish and abedo
[11:05] like Daniel apart from the rest of the
[11:08] world called by God Called to serve you
[11:12] in Babylon call to serve you amidst hell
[11:15] and the earth called to serve you amidst
[11:17] distresses and all sort of spirits
[11:20] raging and and running to and through
[11:23] and yet be are your people father in
[11:26] this world but not of this world may we
[11:29] find your Pavilion tonight may we find
[11:32] that resting place tonight in you in
[11:35] prayer and through prayer granted God in
[11:38] Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God
[11:41] bless you and thanks so much for being
[11:43] here
[11:45] tonight I want to share something with
[11:49] you on the cost of
[11:51] promotion the cost of promotion and we
[11:56] just look at a one or two Bible
[11:57] characters and share some things
[11:59] uh we want to look at Genesis chapter
[12:03] 37 verse 28 Genesis 37 verse 28 you
[12:09] could find it or you don't have to find
[12:10] it but just just listen and this is and
[12:13] then we go to Genesis 4141 and this is
[12:17] Joseph um when he was sold and Joseph
[12:22] when he was placed over Egypt this is
[12:24] Genesis
[12:26] 37:28 then they they passed by the media
[12:29] it the merchant men and they drew and
[12:31] lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold
[12:35] Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces
[12:38] of silver and they brought Joseph into
[12:42] Egypt Genesis 4141 says and Pharaoh said
[12:47] unto Joseph see I have set thee over all
[12:53] the land of
[12:56] Egypt how come our is the cost of him
[13:01] being sold into slavy by his brothers to
[13:05] become second in command in
[13:08] Egypt we were
[13:10] Sinners and God gave us a
[13:13] promotion by justifying
[13:16] us and we were like dirty glasses and he
[13:19] picked us up by his own
[13:21] choosing
[13:23] and he chose to wash Us by the washing
[13:26] of the Water by the word and then choose
[13:29] to pour His Spirit upon us that he could
[13:31] fill us that is his objective to give
[13:35] you a promotion and when he was praying
[13:38] for Peter he didn't pray that he God
[13:41] take them out of the world but God will
[13:43] keep them in the world and one of the
[13:45] things he prayed for that their faith
[13:47] fail not because it will take Faith to
[13:51] go through these processes to get where
[13:54] you're supposed to be and many of times
[13:57] as Christians We complain too much
[14:00] we how I say it
[14:03] uh you know like yeah yeah yeah yeah
[14:07] complaining complaining every sickness
[14:10] every attack everything is a complaint
[14:13] but note Joseph is being sold to Egypt
[14:16] totally clueless of his Destiny in God
[14:21] in heading down to Egypt his brothers by
[14:24] jealousy think they're doing a great job
[14:26] by getting rid of this person who seem
[14:28] to like a torment to them love of the
[14:31] father being spiritual and here it is I
[14:35] wouldn't go in detail we know the story
[14:37] Joseph being sold Joseph uh being a
[14:41] gardener he get promoted uh head of the
[14:43] household of potifa Father wife make a
[14:46] move on him and he ran and he in prison
[14:50] and he's still had to
[14:52] wait could you do that could you know
[14:55] that your life is destined for let's say
[14:58] the this way greatness or blessings or
[15:02] or to be positionally placed and yet you
[15:05] have stuff to go through that may
[15:09] actually look
[15:11] abnormal because it's not the rhythm of
[15:15] how from a human perspective that you
[15:19] expect to be or you expect to go and you
[15:22] will think then because you're a
[15:23] Christian I'm not supposed to go to this
[15:26] I am not supposed to go to that maybe
[15:28] your husband maybe your wife maybe your
[15:30] father maybe your child and you tell
[15:32] yourself that but that's not
[15:34] true that's not true
[15:38] Joseph had to be
[15:41] promoted to be positionally
[15:44] placed in the vision that God gave him
[15:48] and the only way could have been done is
[15:51] his jealous Brothers to sell him out and
[15:54] then selling him out sell him out sell
[15:56] him selling him out he was able to get
[16:00] into that position of power to be second
[16:03] in command in Egypt okay so I don't want
[16:06] to say too long on that I want to go to
[16:08] the next character and this one is
[16:13] David 1 Samuel 161
[16:16] 12-13
[16:17] David going from a Shepherd boy to
[16:21] becoming the king of Israel ad do just
[16:23] don't want you see a Bible text Mini
[16:25] Bible study tonight but I want you to
[16:27] see yourself
[16:30] verse 1st Samuel 16:12 and he sent and
[16:33] brought him talk David and he was Ruddy
[16:36] and with of a beautiful countenance
[16:38] goodly to look at and the Lord said
[16:41] arise anoint him for this is he then
[16:45] Samuel took the Horn of oil anointed him
[16:49] in the midst of his Brethren and the
[16:51] spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from
[16:55] that day forward so David Rose up and
[16:59] went to
[17:00] Ram now I don't think the Bible the
[17:03] Bible didn't say exactly what age he was
[17:05] maybe 16 17 young young lad but look at
[17:08] 2 Samuel 5 3-4 this is when he become
[17:12] king so you just hear how this young man
[17:16] has been anointed in 1st Samuel 16 and 2
[17:20] Samuel 5 here he is coming King so all
[17:24] the Elders of Israel came to the king of
[17:27] to Hebron and King David made a league
[17:30] with them in heon before the Lord and
[17:33] they anointed David King over Israel
[17:37] David was 30 years old when he began to
[17:40] Reign and he reigned 40 years now we
[17:44] know the story of David
[17:47] he had was to serve under Saul King Saul
[17:53] playing the har he defeated golad he had
[17:56] to run in the wilderness he had to hide
[17:57] from Saul and eventually he became
[18:01] King David had it really hard and I want
[18:05] you to show if you have to go to the
[18:08] next level in God there's a cost for
[18:12] that and um there is no way WR it you
[18:17] would see it displayed as we said in
[18:21] Joseph we see it displayed in in David
[18:26] and David had it hard one time David had
[18:28] a play m know David hide in cave David
[18:30] had Camp yet he is
[18:35] Anointed I want to think about you now
[18:38] he's anointed to become king in other
[18:42] words you are predestinated unto
[18:44] something God can cancel
[18:47] that God can change that but if you
[18:50] don't get an attitude adjustment you
[18:53] could stay longer to get where God want
[18:56] you to go because what you're going
[18:59] through right now demands a certain
[19:02] attitude and a certain prayerfulness and
[19:05] a certain confidence and trust that The
[19:07] God Who listen carefully started the
[19:10] work in you is able to complete it
[19:13] because many times when we don't show
[19:16] God that trust we are almost saying we
[19:21] don't have confidence that you could
[19:23] take me through you thought you was
[19:26] going to be over in glory when your hair
[19:29] was black now your hair green but it's
[19:31] still of a glory to go on to and your
[19:34] hair green is only
[19:36] temporary because your hair going to be
[19:38] black so we cannot look with our eyes
[19:42] from the human perspective but we have
[19:45] to look and see from the human
[19:48] perspective what God takes us through to
[19:52] bring us to that place that he want us
[19:53] to be in so let's take we going quickly
[19:56] let's take another character Jesus
[20:00] Matthew 26 37-42 when he took with him
[20:04] Peter two sons of zebede began to be
[20:07] sorrowful and very heavy so in other
[20:09] words Jesus ministry from turning water
[20:12] into wine everybody happy feeding 5,000
[20:15] feing 7,000 raising the dead and he said
[20:18] my hour is not yet come he's heading
[20:20] down now he's getting older and he's
[20:22] heading down to climax's Ministry he
[20:24] said my hour is come he's headed down to
[20:28] calino
[20:29] the way to Calvary is to
[20:31] Gethsemane did you get that the way to
[20:34] Calvary is Gethsemane geeman is not
[20:37] Calvary Gethsemane is a part to Calvary
[20:42] and when he said unto them my soul is
[20:43] exceedingly sorrowful even went to death
[20:47] carry here and watch with me and he went
[20:50] a little further fell on his face prayed
[20:52] saying oh my father if it be possible
[20:55] let this cup pass from me nevertheless
[20:57] not as I would will but as thou wil now
[21:01] I want to show you Jesus being promoted
[21:03] to the worthy lamb to become this worthy
[21:05] lamb what he had to go through and he
[21:07] cometh to his disciples and finded them
[21:08] asleep and said unto Peter what could
[21:11] you not watch with me one hour watch and
[21:14] pray this is Jesus word this is in R
[21:16] watch and pray that you enter not into
[21:19] temptation the spirit is indeed is
[21:22] willing but the flesh is weak and he
[21:25] went away the second time and prayed say
[21:28] oh my father if this cup may not be
[21:31] passed away from me except I drink it
[21:33] thy will be done the BR this is from the
[21:38] breach and there came a voice of of the
[21:40] one of the elders standing in the midst
[21:42] of the four beast and all the great host
[21:43] of Heaven said don't weep John oh my the
[21:46] grace of God don't be brokenhearted John
[21:49] don't weep for the land of the tribe of
[21:52] Judah the root and Offspring from David
[21:56] he had prevailed Prevail means means rle
[21:59] with and overcome oh my in the garden of
[22:03] Geth of Gethsemane here we go when his
[22:07] blood dropped down out of his face he
[22:09] was
[22:10] overcoming the lion of the root of David
[22:13] has prevailed has
[22:16] overcome so it might look
[22:19] simple but Jesus in the intensity of his
[22:23] prayer with the weight of what he had to
[22:25] go through I mean it's not like if he
[22:28] did a crime it's not like if his
[22:31] conscience beaten him and he's
[22:33] guilty he know he's not
[22:35] guilty he know the price have to be paid
[22:38] Jesus can't go and hang himself on the
[22:40] cross he know that's the
[22:42] destination Man Hands have to put him
[22:45] there but man hands putting him there
[22:49] make him become the worthy lamb bleeding
[22:52] and bloody to take the
[22:54] book that we could have what we have
[22:56] here tonight to call our names so all
[23:00] this praying and travailing was for him
[23:04] to get into the position tooted position
[23:08] to be worthy to take the book now if
[23:11] Jesus had died at old age he couldn't
[23:12] take
[23:13] it his blood had to be shed the blood
[23:17] price and the cost had to be paid in
[23:20] order for us to get our
[23:22] Redemption this man by offering his
[23:25] blood once have perfected for
[23:29] them that are Sanctified so there's a
[23:31] cost Jesus had to pay that price David
[23:35] had to pay a price Joseph had a price to
[23:38] pay
[23:40] note that when Joseph Brothers came he
[23:44] said God send me ahead to preserve
[23:48] life Joseph by that time would have been
[23:52] more
[23:53] mature he would have been having a
[23:55] greater understanding of what the will
[23:57] of the Lord is and he would have
[23:59] seen how God hand has been upon him even
[24:04] though it was stressful distressful he
[24:07] was betrayed by his brother it was a
[24:09] terrible and disty thing to for them to
[24:12] do but at the end of it all he could
[24:15] thank God they did it because by doing
[24:19] it he could get into the process of the
[24:22] position where God want him to be all
[24:25] right let's
[24:26] continue I have I think the main one
[24:29] last one Jacob to Israel Genesis 25 294
[24:34] and Jacob S potage and Esau came from
[24:36] the field he was faint and Esau said to
[24:39] Jacob feed me I pray thee that thou the
[24:41] same red potage for I'm faint therefore
[24:44] his name was called Edom Jacob said sell
[24:47] me this day thy birth so Jacob was a
[24:50] business man he was a caror and Esau
[24:54] said behold I'm at the point to die what
[24:56] profit shall this birth do to me
[24:59] and Jacob said swear to me this day and
[25:01] he swear unto him and he sold his
[25:04] Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave
[25:07] Esau bread and potage of lentils and did
[25:09] eat and drink rose up went his way thus
[25:13] God's interpretation Esau
[25:16] despite despise his
[25:19] birri okay Genesis
[25:21] 32:7 this is where Jacob was afraid then
[25:24] Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed
[25:28] he divided the people that was at him so
[25:30] there's a blessed man now he have flocks
[25:32] wives houses land cattle you name it
[25:36] he's on people looking up to Jacob he's
[25:38] he's a man right and he's he's he have
[25:41] he have stuff and flu and hers and
[25:44] camels into two bands he split them up
[25:46] verse eight and said if Esau come to one
[25:49] company and smite it the other company
[25:50] which left shall Escape Jacob said oh
[25:53] god of My Father
[25:55] Abraham this is where retire h to Road
[25:59] this is where the wealth money Health
[26:05] whatever you have as things that heaven
[26:08] doesn't even credit us for because
[26:11] heaven doesn't consist of things all
[26:14] right that we have here on Earth he said
[26:16] oh god of My Father Abraham he's praying
[26:19] God of my father Isaac the Lord which
[26:21] said unto me return unto thy country
[26:23] unto thy Kindred and I will deal well
[26:25] with thee I am not worthy of the least
[26:28] of all the mercies and of all the truth
[26:32] which thou has showed unto thy servant
[26:34] for with my staff I pass over this
[26:36] Jordan and now I am become two bands
[26:39] deliver
[26:40] me is this your prayer tonight deliver
[26:44] me I pray thee from the hand of my
[26:46] brotherr prayer of deliverance from the
[26:49] hand of Esau for I fear Him Le he will
[26:52] come and smite me and the mother with
[26:55] the children and thou sayest I will
[26:58] surely do the good and make thy seed as
[27:00] the sand of the sea which cannot be
[27:02] numbered for multitude note how Jacob is
[27:06] reminding god of what he promised you
[27:10] cannot just sit down there
[27:12] and no no no you have to remind god of
[27:16] what he promised on your behalf Jacob
[27:18] said listen I'm in trouble I'm
[27:20] frightened I'm afraid my brother going
[27:22] to kill me beat me whatever it is but
[27:24] remember what you told me you told me to
[27:27] come out you may come in this land it be
[27:29] a good land and Jacob is singing a song
[27:32] to God that God has to hear are you with
[27:34] me but he still have stuff to go through
[27:37] so let's Rite this tonight praise God
[27:41] and deliver me I pray thee from the hand
[27:42] of my brother and so on and thou has
[27:44] said I will surely do thee good and make
[27:47] thy seed in the sand of the sea which
[27:49] cannot be numbered for a multitude and
[27:51] then Jacob went and get a hammock and he
[27:54] connected between two Tre trees and
[27:56] rocking it and said
[27:58] mind that breeze is feeling so good I'm
[28:01] waiting on the
[28:02] Lord no that is not on the Bible that is
[28:07] not happening and many times we pray and
[28:10] we pray and we expect it to just work
[28:12] out we don't expect us to burn our knees
[28:15] we don't expect us to go through tough
[28:17] times hard times and stressful times
[28:20] because we pray and you sit down now and
[28:22] you pray and you're waiting like an
[28:23] entitled Soul Waiting for God to work
[28:26] this thing out but it have more to it
[28:28] than meets the eye let's continue with
[28:30] this guy called Jacob Genesis 32:24 and
[28:33] Jacob was left alone Oh Glory see that
[28:36] part that's a tough part for some people
[28:38] now with all this social media and with
[28:40] all this kind of thing to to get people
[28:42] occupied and and fully fully awake with
[28:45] this world and Jacob was left alone and
[28:47] there Wrestled a man with him until the
[28:49] breaking of the day and when he saw that
[28:52] he reviled not against him he touched
[28:53] the Hall of his TI and the Hall of
[28:55] Jacob's TI was out of joint and he
[28:57] wrestled with him in other words Jacob
[28:59] was broken and he's still fighting Jacob
[29:01] was broken and he's still wrestling why
[29:03] because he was desperate why because he
[29:05] wanted deliverance and he said let me go
[29:08] for the day break it he said I will not
[29:10] let you go except you bless me this is
[29:12] Jacob though he really mean that he is
[29:14] sincere verse 27 he said unto him what
[29:16] is thy name is this important he said
[29:19] Jacob he's identifying his condition he
[29:22] said he's a Scamp he's a crook he's a
[29:25] deceiver he's a cheat and he said name
[29:28] shall be no more Jacob but Israel for as
[29:33] a prince thou has power with God and
[29:37] with men and has prevailed and Jacob
[29:39] asked him and said tell me I praise thee
[29:41] thy name he said wherefore is it that
[29:43] thou ask me after my name and he blessed
[29:46] it and Jacob called the name of the
[29:49] place penel for I have seen God face to
[29:52] face and my life is preserved and here
[29:55] in Genesis 3 334 is when he meet his
[29:59] brother Esau now you see when you have
[30:01] fear and you haven't met the Lord your
[30:04] fear does happening but here it is this
[30:07] man broke past because he met the Lord
[30:10] he no longer in fear and look what
[30:12] happened in verse 4 of Genesis to the
[30:15] tree and Esau ran to meet him and
[30:18] embraced him and fell on his neck and
[30:22] kissed him and they wept when you please
[30:26] the Lord go let your enemy
[30:28] be at peace with you when you please the
[30:31] Lord when you so the issue is not the
[30:33] enemy you know the issue is
[30:36] us we have enemies you have enemies you
[30:38] have enemies whether you're conscious of
[30:40] it or not but don't bother with your
[30:43] enemies think about you think about what
[30:46] you have to overcome so when he expect
[30:49] his brother to be fear hard on him his
[30:52] brother actually embraced him fell on
[30:54] his neck and kissed him and they went
[30:57] okay
[30:59] and this here is such a powerful
[31:02] scripture Genesis 359 to12 this is very
[31:05] precious to my heart and I have this
[31:07] here by a new name Israel is established
[31:10] so Jacob name is now changed and Genesis
[31:13] 35 listen to these words and God
[31:17] appeared unto Jacob again when he came
[31:20] out of pan and blessed him and God said
[31:25] unto him thy name is Jacob
[31:28] thy name shall not be called anymore
[31:31] Jacob but Israel shall be thy name and
[31:36] he called his name Israel and God said
[31:40] unto him I am God Almighty be fruitful
[31:44] and multiply a nation and a company of
[31:48] Nations shall be of thee and Kings shall
[31:52] come out of thy loins and the land which
[31:56] I give Abraham and
[31:58] to thee I will give it and to thy seed
[32:02] after thee will I give the land what a
[32:05] transformation what a transformation
[32:07] from Jacob to Israel and today a country
[32:11] is named Israel because a
[32:14] man wrestled with
[32:16] God have you ever thought about that we
[32:19] talk about Israel and Israel and Israel
[32:22] but this Israel is because a man prayed
[32:27] a
[32:28] man pray through until his life was
[32:32] changed so much that his name had to be
[32:36] changed and that is where you get the
[32:38] children of
[32:39] Israel
[32:43] question should we limit our prayer to
[32:47] only spiritual
[32:49] things question do you think that our
[32:52] world is unaffected by
[32:55] prayer well but Bram said because I know
[32:59] that prayer is what changes things
[33:01] prayer is what does things for us you
[33:05] have to believe this you have to believe
[33:07] this with all your heart because
[33:09] Philippians 4:6 says be careful for
[33:12] nothing but in
[33:14] everything by prayer and supplication
[33:16] and Thanksgiving let your requests be
[33:19] known unto God so whether it's natural
[33:21] things and God interested in natural
[33:23] things for you because you're living
[33:24] here on the earth whether it's spiritual
[33:26] things God interested in Spirit to you
[33:28] because you need to be connected to him
[33:30] be careful for nothing but in everything
[33:33] and he Amplified said do not fret or
[33:35] have anxiety about anything but in every
[33:38] circumstance and in everything by prayer
[33:42] and petition definite request with
[33:46] Thanksgiving continue to make your wants
[33:48] known to God so your promotion even
[33:52] natural promotion in your job you get a
[33:54] promotion what not that is of the Lord
[33:57] if you do see it so you wouldn't thank
[33:58] God for it you just take a promotion
[34:00] like the pig or like the animal the
[34:02] prophet said who apples fall in the head
[34:04] never look up to say thanks where coming
[34:05] from just eating apple grunting grunting
[34:07] all his mind and you're eating eating
[34:09] eating and God showering his blessing
[34:11] upon you because sometimes you can get
[34:13] promoted and lose it you could actually
[34:15] lose your promotion you could lose your
[34:18] promotion by your behavior by attitude
[34:20] like King
[34:21] Saul CH was chosen so was anointed but
[34:25] Saul fell into disobedience and God said
[34:28] I had enough of that man I fed up went
[34:30] the kingdom remove from him he's still
[34:32] in the post he's still on the throne but
[34:33] only a matter of time he remove from
[34:36] there so so people can get promoted and
[34:37] don't hold it people can get placed and
[34:41] lose their place or they get a crown and
[34:44] they lose their Crown to someone else do
[34:46] you see it now so when God blesses you
[34:50] when God empowers you when God surround
[34:53] your life with his grace and mercy he
[34:55] expect you to do something about it for
[34:57] to grow and
[34:58] expand of the mercy and Grace that God
[35:01] has blessed you with that you can even
[35:03] ex extend that same Grace and we see to
[35:06] others I rep tonight as I Look to close
[35:09] I some other things to say but I think
[35:10] I'm going to wrap
[35:12] up material successes are immaterial to
[35:17] God so whatever you achieve in life
[35:20] house Car Land plane boat rocket
[35:24] whatever money and wealth that carries
[35:28] no weight in
[35:29] heaven praying is what a man can do and
[35:33] must
[35:33] do success in business or life should be
[35:37] a side blessings of a Praying
[35:40] Soul Heaven don't need money but the
[35:43] success of
[35:45] man Heaven don't give credits for
[35:47] Earthly
[35:48] success God works through
[35:53] prayer how many understand that how many
[35:55] believe that but not aine praying is a
[35:58] man had to pray and Luke 18:1 said he
[36:01] said in a parable to them that men
[36:02] always men ought always to pray and not
[36:05] to fate so if God uses prayer and man
[36:10] have to pray for God to use that prayer
[36:12] as a prayer go like how Daniel Prayed
[36:15] and the angel had to come to Daniel then
[36:17] men had to pray so praying is God's
[36:19] business Matthew 213 as we close he said
[36:23] them it is written my house shall be
[36:26] called a House of Prayer
[36:28] but you have made it a den of
[36:31] teas and I close with this quote from
[36:34] Brother
[36:35] brandham here it is if I'm getting this
[36:38] right a man or a woman who really tries
[36:41] to live a Christian Life and have stain
[36:43] from the things of the world the world
[36:46] backs off and say they are fanatic every
[36:49] man that tries to trust God his fellow
[36:53] man will call him goody goody or
[36:56] or something like that I don't
[36:58] judge a man by the callous in his hands
[37:02] it's by hard work and labor it's by the
[37:04] bag of the knee in his pants that is
[37:07] where you pray whether he bows and prays
[37:09] or not man is not judged by Statue he is
[37:14] judged by character I have seen men that
[37:17] weighed 200 pound and didn't have a
[37:19] ounce of man in him ravish a mother with
[37:22] a baby in her arm a man is judged by
[37:26] character what he is on the
[37:30] inside let us bow our
[37:32] heads almighty God I thank you tonight
[37:36] to share these few words with your
[37:38] people and I pray it be a blessing and a
[37:41] help to
[37:42] them that they will realize to go to the
[37:46] next level in the Christian walk whether
[37:49] it's from Faith to Virtue virtue to
[37:52] knowledge knowledge to Temperance
[37:53] Temperance to patience patience to
[37:55] Godliness godliness of Godly kindness
[37:57] what is whatever station they are at to
[37:59] go to the next level to be promoted to
[38:02] the next level to climb to the next
[38:05] level have a price a cost a effort and
[38:09] may they see it tonight as a
[38:11] reality as the song said some to the
[38:14] waters some to the flood some to Great
[38:17] trials but all to the blood we here
[38:20] tonight as your blood bought children
[38:23] we're here tonight because we are needy
[38:25] we're here tonight because we know you
[38:28] walk through prayer and sometimes if
[38:30] some Grandmother Had prayed that's why
[38:32] we are here some grandparent pray and
[38:34] they're no longer on the Earth but the
[38:35] pray is holding up holding up for the
[38:37] grandchildren holding up for their great
[38:39] grandchildren we are so
[38:42] grateful and if we are praying that we
[38:44] could be praying parents we could be
[38:46] praying sons and daughters that we will
[38:48] never give up upon our loved ones but
[38:51] pray that they break through Lord oh God
[38:53] help us tonight break through in homes
[38:55] break through in marriages break through
[38:57] in relationships breakr with father and
[39:00] son mother and daughter breakr with
[39:03] husband and wife breakr in parents and
[39:05] children breakthrough with the young
[39:07] people in the church that they will have
[39:09] a heart after righteousness and a heart
[39:11] after you granted God as we look away to
[39:13] you there's a price of promotion you
[39:17] said you want us to be the head not the
[39:18] tail you want us to be like light that
[39:21] could stand on top that table a candle
[39:24] that not hid under a bushill but
[39:26] standing to sh light to you you said you
[39:28] want us to be like the salt of the earth
[39:31] God you want us to be not backwards but
[39:33] forward you want us to be promoted to be
[39:36] like light ligh houses like like a
[39:39] billboard that giv witness that you the
[39:42] same yesterday end forever father may
[39:44] you touch your sons tonight touch your
[39:46] daughters touch the Caleb in a special
[39:48] way touch the sick in our midst that
[39:50] your spirit will come upon them even as
[39:52] they pray they will see themselves as
[39:54] old Like These Old Testament characters
[39:56] and identify the with it to wrestle with
[39:59] the angel to be fervent in prayer to be
[40:02] passionate if they in sin father that
[40:04] they will connect with the Psalms of
[40:06] David where his prayer was a prayer of
[40:08] confession if we say we have no sin we
[40:11] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[40:12] in us but if we confess our sins you are
[40:15] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[40:17] sins father May there be SE cleansing
[40:19] tonight by your fire by Your Presence by
[40:21] your power Will you pour the baptism of
[40:23] the Holy Ghost tonight in their homes in
[40:25] their lives in Jesus name I ask it amen
[40:29] amen so saints of God I pray that what
[40:32] we share tonight would be a help to you
