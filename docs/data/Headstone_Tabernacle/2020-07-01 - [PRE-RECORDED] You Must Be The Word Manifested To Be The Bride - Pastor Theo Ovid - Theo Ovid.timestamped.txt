[18:52] guided by the Spirit of Truth into it
[18:55] because jesus promised to release the
[18:57] spirit of truth that wanna lead us and
[18:58] guide us in all truth now Sunday last I
[19:02] said something that Moses will bring in
[19:04] the sea at a lot of the people the
[19:05] Sailor Lord the say Lord us alone and
[19:07] after whether it was the sea at Moses
[19:08] and what didn't like that and until
[19:10] their form where
[19:12] the Prophet said that our Moses feel
[19:14] before he because he glorified himself
[19:16] so men could feel men could fall man
[19:19] could feel man is not infallible God is
[19:22] he say I am God and beside me there is
[19:25] none else when God looked his left
[19:27] looked is right there was none else
[19:28] because he's God I've bought a loom he
[19:34] doesn't need help a man to make him God
[19:36] he is caught and God alone he purpose
[19:39] and define what he put us and released
[19:42] his purpose and that comes the pass and
[19:44] if he put us that you'll be delivered
[19:46] this morning nothing gonna stop that not
[19:48] even what happened last night what even
[19:51] happen last week last year last twenty
[19:53] years

[19:56] of God for praise the name of the Lord I

[20:02] does not annul the purpose of God I
[20:05] don't care you don't feel you wanna get
[20:07] well that does not annul the purpose of
[20:10] God because he said my word shall not
[20:14] return unto me void nothing stops the
[20:17] purpose and the divine will of God it
[20:21] will stand kingdoms rise kingdoms fall
[20:25] but God will stand he said you raised a
[20:28] pharaoh to bring him down because God

[20:37] the mightiest land the mightiest country

[28:13] days you see the glory of God it's a
[28:16] process of getting ready a lot of people
[28:18] you see the process caught
[28:20] God Moses presumed because his mother
[28:22] told him stuff that he was a special
[28:23] child and he was deliver intellectually
[28:26] he knew that but it didn't have the
[28:27] empowerment to do that and you have to
[28:30] be empowered to fulfill God's purpose
[28:33] that's why it's called virtue power for
[28:36] service not your service god city's
[28:40] power to be in service for the Lord
[28:42] that's when God put you in his service
[28:45] that's when he signing up and he ranked
[28:47] you and he put a little tag on you I
[28:49] don't know what that pretty tag on here
[28:50] and so on that you have rank no because
[28:52] they're not empowered then you could
[28:54] stop power to stop the demons that get
[28:56] out sue so take left stick left go right
[28:59] you this one go right you take left
[29:03] that's what Jesus had is not right for
[29:07] the Castro Devers he's not power to
[29:09] prophesy power to overcome for what to
[29:12] pray some of you can't pray in the top
[29:13] three and you can't breathe you can't
[29:14] talk long on the cell phone but you can
[29:16] free and you can't pray in the country
[29:17] and Camp Rica talk to God but when power
[29:20] come you are power to break the other
[29:23] power my water forgive and yet it's big
[29:26] one there's a big one coming off why
[29:28] would I say I'm sorry there's a big one
[29:29] in the people lots of people don't like
[29:31] that
[29:33] [Applause]
[29:36] look people don't like to say sorry
[29:39] because sorry means like you're wrong
[29:40] you don't be wrong so wanna be right so
[29:43] sorry means that you're little less than
[29:46] or you're lower down or you make a
[29:47] mistake maker oh you don't say sorry but

[35:50] I will manifest myself to him let's pray
[35:52] father we thank you for your holy word
[35:55] and Lord we are right under a promise of
[35:59] another comforter even the Spirit of
[36:01] Truth they were already comforted by
[36:04] Christ among them the Living Word but he
[36:07] promised another comforter which was the
[36:09] spirit to be indwelling in them
[36:11] Oh God released that comforter here this
[36:13] morning and fill every hungry heart in
[36:16] Jesus and I ask it amen and amen you may
[36:19] be seated
[36:20] o blessed be the name of the war
[36:23] thank you lord Oh blessed be the name of
[36:26] the Lord it's so good to have a praise
[36:29] in your heart you always have some of
[36:31] the time God and I think I saw unnoticed
[36:34] somebody said I'm once the above grown
[36:35] you have yes I'm in the pre-scored
[36:38] above the grown you are lies you still
[36:41] have health and strength yeah yup I've
[36:43] grown you have something to praise God
[36:45] about dinner so this morning our title
[36:48] you must be the word manifested to be
[36:51] the bride that's my title this morning
[36:54] you must be the word manifested to be
[36:56] the bride
[36:57] I have an inspiration until you are
[37:00] convinced you cannot be concerned until
[37:05] you are convinced you cannot be
[37:09] concerned now praise God so God will
[37:17] never be able watch we will never be
[37:20] able to have a church until God gets a
[37:24] foundation to lean on
[37:25] he will never build his church on a
[37:28] bunch of nonsense he has to come on his
[37:31] word or he wound won't come at all
[37:34] isn't that right I'm only building y'all
[37:37] is close at hand when you wanna see
[37:40] something happen when something's gonna
[37:42] take place and all this background here
[37:44] has only been laying a foundation for a
[37:46] short quick message that will shake the
[37:49] whole nation so for God to build for
[37:52] gota I had forgot the work they have to
[37:54] be a foundation from the work with isn't
[37:56] that right and if God is to work with
[37:58] you there has to be a place prepared and
[38:01] that's why John the Baptist was sent he
[38:03] was sent to prepare please for Messiah
[38:05] so Gordon always have preparation made
[38:08] he doesn't just come he come on what has
[38:11] been prepared isn't that right now it's
[38:14] in John 6:63 it says it's a spirit
[38:16] equipment the flesh profiteth nothing
[38:19] the words that I speak they are spirit
[38:24] and their life Jesus is saying words are
[38:29] also spirit
[38:31] words are also life it's not just words
[38:35] no watch first John 5:6 s this is he
[38:39] that came by water and blood even Jesus
[38:42] Christ not by water only but by water
[38:45] and blood it is the spirit that bear
[38:49] witness because the Spirit is truth not
[38:53] information spirit is truth that's why
[38:57] in court you said speak the whole truth
[38:58] nothing but the truth and so help me go
[39:00] on and so on because it have whole truth
[39:02] and you could speak something that goes
[39:04] beyond what is true things that you want
[39:06] to call it and flavor it with so they
[39:08] asks you to speak the whole truth and
[39:10] not take but the truth isn't that right
[39:13] so when gia say I am the way and the
[39:15] truth he's not just talking on my letter
[39:17] standpoint he's talking about the spirit
[39:19] itself so it's not just words it's
[39:22] spirit life makes the truth and Jesus
[39:25] said you shall know the truth and the
[39:28] truth shall set you free
[39:30] now a lot of people know the words a lot
[39:34] of people know what is right and what is
[39:35] wrong but they're not empowered to live
[39:37] what is right so when he said you shall
[39:40] know the truth and the truth shall set
[39:42] you free
[39:42] he's not talking about something
[39:44] intellectual he's not talking about some
[39:46] understanding he's talking about that
[39:48] spirit that comes inside of you to
[39:51] release you from your past to release
[39:53] you from your sin to release you from
[39:56] your guilt and set you free and who the
[40:00] son of man set free is free indeed
[40:05] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so
[40:09] true come to release you
[40:11] [Applause]
[40:12] isn't that right now look it for and
[40:16] when much people were gathered together
[40:18] they would come to him out of every CD
[40:19] speaker parable I saw a window to the
[40:22] soul he sowed some fell by the wayside
[40:25] it was strutting down falls of the air
[40:27] devoured it some fell upon a rock soon
[40:29] as it was sprung up it withered away
[40:31] because it lacked moisture some fell
[40:33] among thorns that one sprang up and
[40:34] choked it others fell on good ground
[40:36] sprang up their fruit a hundredfold
[40:39] when he had said these things he cried
[40:41] he had ear so hear let him hear
[40:42] and the disciples asked him saying what
[40:45] might this probably and he said unto you
[40:48] it is given to know the mysteries of the
[40:51] kingdom of God but unto others in
[40:53] parables
[40:54] a seein they might not see and hearing
[40:56] they might not understand so a parable
[41:00] Israeli hidden mysteries filled as
[41:03] stories but in them of hidden truths to
[41:07] be revealed to his elected which is the
[41:10] children of the kingdom isn't that right
[41:12] so then Jesus began to interpret that
[41:15] he's unto you is given to know the
[41:16] mysteries
[41:16] he said now the parable is this the seed
[41:19] is the word of God
[41:23] now watch he said my words and spirit my
[41:26] words are life but now he said my word
[41:29] is a seeded so gore-tex spirit make it
[41:34] work take word make a seed and that seed
[41:39] is what comes into you could we get a
[41:43] lot of praise those by the wayside did
[41:48] not hear then come at the devil take it
[41:49] out of the word out of their hearts
[41:51] please they should believe and be saved
[41:52] then the rock a day when they hear we
[41:55] see there will be joy but they have no
[41:57] root which for a while believe in time
[42:00] of temptation following and that which
[42:02] fell among thorns a day which when they
[42:04] could go forth and a chopped but cares
[42:07] and riches and pleasures of this life
[42:11] and bring no fruit to perfection but
[42:16] that ungood groan are they which here we
[42:18] go which in an honest and good heart
[42:21] having heard the word keep it and bring
[42:24] forth fruit with patience fruit with
[42:28] patience Oh hallelujah the husbandmen
[42:30] waited for the rain waited petitions for
[42:33] the fruit of the earth to come forth
[42:35] Oh hallelujah this is not instant
[42:38] because Karate not a gift characters of
[42:40] victory and character means that you
[42:43] went through something so God is
[42:45] interested in you going through
[42:46] something and not asking him to take you
[42:49] out of something but asking you to help
[42:51] you give the grace to go true the stuff
[42:54] that you need to go true in order to
[42:56] have character because character is not
[42:58] a blessing from the Lord the rocket is a
[43:01] victory okay yes I'm praises in the
[43:04] house
[43:04] [Applause]
[43:09] so godson this unspoken regional seed
[43:12] was his example seed and that's why when
[43:16] we want to look at the template we look
[43:18] to Jesus when we look to see how God
[43:20] handle his sons and treat his sons we
[43:22] look to Jesus because he was the example
[43:24] seat son and when Jesus received the
[43:26] spirit we know when Jesus went Jesus did
[43:28] no wheantr for the advertisement on
[43:30] papers and said here am i I'm the
[43:31] Messiah Jesus was led by the spirit into
[43:34] the wilderness for his place of trying
[43:36] to be tested by the word dry word and
[43:45] Jesus overcame but it is written now I'm
[43:48] feeling this he had no feeling to feel
[43:50] it was dry it was desert all that was
[43:54] awkward it is written it is written it
[43:58] is written you feel something I have no
[44:00] feeling in this it is written it is
[44:02] written it is written and when the
[44:04] Devastator caught it is also returned oh
[44:08] God are you with me now so this was the
[44:13] example seed son
[44:15] behavior an operation so watch what his
[44:19] life was when the Spirit poured upon him
[44:21] after his baptism and the Holy Ghost
[44:23] came upon him the very life that he
[44:25] produced that same here we go
[44:27] that same water in spirit of the Holy
[44:30] Ghost will bring forth the same kind of
[44:34] life doing the same thing that he did so
[44:38] now we find out the Spirit is also water
[44:41] in spirit so the Holy Ghost is the water
[44:44] in spirit and if you have the water in
[44:47] spirit that spirit coming for seed that
[44:50] means that gorgeous added water to water
[44:52] no you have to have seed for that water
[44:55] in spirit to come upon and if that water
[44:58] in spirit come upon that seed something
[45:01] has to take place because water and seed
[45:05] does connect a certain way something has
[45:08] happened when water strikes Edith
[45:11] or give a lot some praises people so you
[45:15] ever see this dry it looks like it's
[45:18] dead it has no power in it it looks like
[45:21] it's just a seed lay in there
[45:23] that could be an oak tree that could be
[45:26] a coconut tree whatever it is it's
[45:28] looking drab you can walk past it you
[45:30] could store it in the cupboard
[45:32] you could lay there for years but if you
[45:34] only let water touch it is the only that
[45:37] water come on it if you only let that
[45:39] water and spirit try to see something
[45:43] gonna happen
[45:44] because she's in my where life is
[45:51] disappearing that brick left oh so you
[45:54] have to sit here I'm getting to spill it
[45:57] when you understand that nothing gonna
[45:59] stop you from worshipping when you
[46:01] understand that nothing gonna stop you
[46:04] from praising your God because it's the
[46:06] spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[46:09] profiteth nothing
[46:11] [Applause]
[46:18] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[46:22] hallelujah do you understand
[46:26] so there's a bit of teaching this
[46:27] morning the word is a seed no watch
[46:34] watch so what's the same water and
[46:37] spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring
[46:39] forth the same kind of life doing the
[46:41] same thing that he did if it is if it's
[46:45] the same seed Son of God seed will bring
[46:48] forth a son of God seed and I was every
[46:51] seed after skåne according to Genesis
[46:54] 111 such son our God see reproduced on a
[46:57] gourd seed isn't that right no Jesus
[46:59] already prophesy and reread it's in John
[47:01] 14:12 the same rose I do I'm not hearing
[47:05] it now you do also so what does Jesus
[47:08] saying the same see that I have going to
[47:11] be inside of you and a water and spirit
[47:14] gonna come upon him and the same life
[47:16] that I have gonna be living in he'll
[47:18] understand what's that I did you gonna
[47:21] do too
[47:22] [Applause]
[47:26] Oh could we pack the loss of that let me
[47:30] praise God for that do you understand
[47:32] all the same we'll see that you're gonna
[47:34] do it's not you trying something is that
[47:37] you experimenting with something it's
[47:39] another comforter Oh hallelujah
[47:43] that going to abide with you forever
[47:46] okay now watch see what it is that why I
[47:51] believe the wood is a seed and if the
[47:53] rain falls upon the seed it will bring
[47:56] forth after its kind hallelu the Holy
[47:59] Spirit will water and bring forth that
[48:03] seed it's the water to the seed and if
[48:08] the seed has been planted and the water
[48:10] falls on you Oh hallelujah
[48:13] it always the spirit going to fall on
[48:17] planted when the spirit not falling on
[48:20] this Bible this Bible forgetting you

[48:44] with this physical Bible is the Bible so
[48:48] when this Bible becomes that Bible and
[48:51] that Bible comes inside of you then that
[48:54] becomes the full seed inside of you then
[48:57] the seventh under Revelation is the
[48:59] capstone revelation of the entire Bible
[49:02] and must saw Jesus Christ any revelation
[49:06] that doesn't reveal Jesus Christ is the
[49:09] wrong revelation Oh God this is Jesus
[49:13] Christ that's the life that Jesus had or

[50:19] same thing there shall be a final voice

[50:24] thundering voices seven living voices oh
[50:29] seven voices the the devil's
[50:32] Kingdom gimmick incision God devil saw
[50:40] in the beginning I thought Genesis is
[50:43] the beginning and the beginning
[50:45] never sit down to mess up bodies and the
[50:49] mess aborts beautiful children Adam and
[50:52] Eve hallelujah
[50:54] first Adam spirit man no Fleshman no man
[50:59] to till the soil there was no man to
[51:01] till the soil there was no Dutchman the
[51:04] Bible said God formed man in his own
[51:07] image and the Bible said part is the
[51:10] spirit therefore God formed spirit man
[51:13] man was floating like the spirit
[51:16] non-physical man they tilled the soil
[51:18] but then God took some dust and the
[51:21] Bible said God formed man out of the
[51:24] dust of the earth he took some calcium
[51:27] he took some potage any poo for a man
[51:31] standing there i me put the spirit man
[51:33] into that - man and man became a living
[51:36] soul that's why when people die
[51:39] you get dust the dust and ashes to ashes
[51:41] because you come from the dust Oh
[51:44] hallelujah glory the crap all right give
[51:48] the Lord some praises people you maybe
[51:52] see that that is why when God wanted to
[51:55] redeem man yes I cannot process it was a
[51:58] hidden mystery of why the world was
[52:02] flooded in the days of Noah what people
[52:05] don't understand it wasn't just a flood
[52:07] it was a water baptism the baptized yet
[52:11] that was about to be redeemed because
[52:14] God redeems the earth the same way he
[52:18] redeems the individual so a Noah there
[52:20] it was baptized of water

[54:47] well over the life boy shuttle of how he
[54:50] about that you were talking about what
[54:53] might underlie sacred ever well I know

[55:21] pop pamphlets or believe he shame it or
[55:24] he say you hold that call your church
[55:25] this you hold that college is that
[55:27] college that and you stand by that stand
[55:30] for a conviction
[55:31] hold on to that
[55:35] that would argument have nothing to do
[55:38] with the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[55:41] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[55:45] neither knoweth him but he is with you
[55:48] the way but Charlie in you there's a lot
[55:52] of brevity I'm contending that
[55:59] Christianity is alive you have to be

[56:08] be educated to be a Christian
[56:10] [Applause]

[1:04:21] able to open the little things it's not
[1:04:26] right in line right read a Bible
[1:04:28] somebody asked Burma no question how can
[1:04:30] I get deeper in the love of God he said
[1:04:32] read the Bible and pray everyday read
[1:04:34] the Bible and pray read a wooden it's
[1:04:37] very simple he and say putting on your
[1:04:39] ears don't read the Bible and pray that
[1:04:42] is all get a playful spirit commit your
[1:04:44] life into the Lord you start the day
[1:04:46] right you put God in front and you look
[1:04:48] at the trust him yeah you're looking the
[1:04:51] trust simin and he becomes your trust
[1:04:53] and you recognize afterwards your static
[1:04:54] let's see God
[1:04:55] tiffen your operation tip in your life
[1:04:58] you see when God is out is you run in
[1:05:00] your show you on your own you're going
[1:05:03] here you're doing this and you're doing
[1:05:04] that and it
[1:05:05] you and you and all about you but when
[1:05:07] but when you surrender and this is what
[1:05:10] God wants then you begin to see God you
[1:05:13] have a miserable class you could pray
[1:05:15] God cool loser end down so you're a
[1:05:17] teacher and you don't say well you know

[1:05:22] opportunity to put seasoned those
[1:05:23] children that will set them on the right
[1:05:25] path of life so all of that is that that
[1:05:27] you're concerned sometime they come from
[1:05:29] stressful families stressful home nobody
[1:05:31] care for them nobody loved them and the
[1:05:33] day somebody take time off to show some
[1:05:35] love and some care and concern
[1:05:36] you're surprising about that response
[1:05:37] and that's the whole thing some people
[1:05:39] come and be people upbeat the people
[1:05:41] into each other because as easy thing to
[1:05:43] do
[1:05:43] everybody know they born in same shape
[1:05:45] iniquity they have issues in their own
[1:05:47] life we passed on my time big stick I
[1:05:48] said and put licks you know put mix and
[1:05:50] everybody say yes yes yes yes and
[1:05:52] especially those who control this earth
[1:05:54] they like people to control them that
[1:05:55] people like that that is why dictators
[1:05:57] are necessary in some cases not me I'm
[1:06:01] not applying for that post I have no
[1:06:03] desire to be there that's not have
[1:06:04] dictators because people don't want
[1:06:06] until have discipline so they mean a
[1:06:08] strong man
[1:06:09] how many strong man comes from as a left
[1:06:11] turn is a yes sir I turn at sir and the
[1:06:16] field in obedience city strong man but
[1:06:18] go I'd like to see well don't be made
[1:06:19] whole Peter Lawford on me oh you know I
[1:06:24] love you
[1:06:25] feed my lambs with my love his dough me
[1:06:27] be that's how they get a little pressure
[1:06:29] Jesus pushes them on you really lowly
[1:06:33] and I kind of push in push in push it
[1:06:35] Lord oh no it's all things you needed
[1:06:37] him I break onto that now pressing some
[1:06:40] knobs it at this stupid me and I don't
[1:06:42] want to be this to be my spirit like
[1:06:44] that
[1:06:44] but Jesus was pushing on emphasis the
[1:06:47] show and he has to go deeper than where
[1:06:48] he's at
[1:06:49] come on oh come on out come on out and
[1:06:52] as we go forward you have to go deeper
[1:06:54] and where you act
[1:06:56] challenge you this morning Oh hallelujah
[1:06:59] Oh glory
[1:07:01] my okay let's go now watch so don't
[1:07:05] watch okay let me go for the note the AK
[1:07:07] no echoes made of gopher wood and
[1:07:10] shittim wood it's hollow everything is
[1:07:13] taken out of it but anybody seen the
[1:07:16] material that no
[1:07:17] use we're gonna laugh at him because
[1:07:19] that material was going to take in water
[1:07:22] and sink now Gordon a fool God is the
[1:07:25] front of wisdom so God let nor take a
[1:07:28] soft wood that is very absorbent because
[1:07:31] God is bringing a further revelation to
[1:07:34] pitch it on the inside and outside
[1:07:35] because God wanted pitch to soak in to
[1:07:38] make the wood waterproof shield from
[1:07:42] sinking you understand what I'm saying
[1:07:45] so God holds the revelation of what
[1:07:47] looking for us in your life because
[1:07:53] because he wants you absorbent to the
[1:07:56] spirit so he making sure there are some

[1:12:27] desperate you have water for a long time
[1:12:30] you say I need a drink when you're

[1:13:35] to cut the cross over Jordana you got

[1:16:21] nothing about it God said so I'm gonna
[1:16:25] be Phil I'm gonna be sealed
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:32] so we look good let them let us take the
[1:16:37] heads off those dogs off hallelujah then
[1:16:43] you are free you don't move you're not
[1:16:46] motivated by your feelings and their
[1:16:47] emotions and your conscience and your
[1:16:49] memory and your affection and your
[1:16:51] reasoning you're motivated by the
[1:16:52] promise of God because John was so
[1:16:55] convinced of the expectation and fulfill
[1:16:58] the promise John said ever is one
[1:17:00] standing among you
[1:17:01] I don't know who he is but he's gonna
[1:17:07] baptize you at fire
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:14] what what what would make John say that
[1:17:17] he was convinced he was so convinced now
[1:17:20] you begin to speak at present tense he
[1:17:22] said I don't know him but the one who
[1:17:24] pulled me to baptize with water
[1:17:26] pull me the one like to see the spirit
[1:17:29] coming on and remaining on him that is
[1:17:32] the one I put the baptized with the Holy
[1:17:35] Ghost
[1:17:40] John listen John live in my feet push on
[1:17:46] my feet
[1:17:46] he don't know if Jesus told that she
[1:17:49] asked in fact in he don't know what he
[1:17:51] does look like he don't know what they
[1:17:53] promise look like all you know the one
[1:17:55] who told unto the baptized told him that
[1:17:57] the one you see the spirit so John only
[1:17:59] look at the spirit he is baptizing was
[1:18:02] looking for spirit he is caring would
[1:18:04] only give a spirit he is baptizing on
[1:18:06] preaching was he looking for the spirit
[1:18:08] it was somebody that the Spirit will
[1:18:10] come upon you it was some son that what

[1:18:15] some son somewhere somebody in your
[1:18:17] quads on me please with descend on that

[1:20:35] another

[1:21:38] isn't that right so you are just bypass
[1:21:41] rocky often II come nominee earns to be

[1:21:56] we're going
[1:22:00] and you will know as you are known oh
[1:22:03] man god bless you so real seed of God is
[1:22:08] absorbent to the spirit isn't that right
[1:22:11] when God there we go
[1:22:14] on his word becomes one that is when
[1:22:18] God's Spirit waters the seed of God it
[1:22:22] produces God it's not the individual it
[1:22:26] is God you are dead you are not yourself
[1:22:30] no more
[1:22:31] you reckon yourself dead hollowed out
[1:22:34] waiting for see Joe then what is it
[1:22:37] it isn't you no more it isn't a man it's
[1:22:40] caught in the man
[1:22:41] it's the see Jim like the beginning
[1:22:43] spoken word God spoken word made
[1:22:46] manifest in the man then it isn't a man
[1:22:48] it's the man that died Oh hallelujah
[1:22:51] and then Christ come alive Christ means
[1:22:54] The Anointed One a man that was anointed
[1:22:57] Oh hallelujah and Cordwell in him what
[1:23:01] was it the gym with the flesh The
[1:23:04] Anointed One the flesh been anointed
[1:23:08] with the Spirit of God produced the Word
[1:23:11] of God made manifest the flesh so Jesus
[1:23:15] was the flesh of God the word he was the
[1:23:18] word but he needed a spirit to come upon
[1:23:21] him to make it manifest so the fullness
[1:23:25] of the Spirit came down upon that son
[1:23:28] you are not gonna get the fullness you
[1:23:31] are gonna get your measure or get a lot
[1:23:34] some praises people hallelujah Jesus
[1:23:38] receive the fullness but you receive the
[1:23:40] measure just like the ocean just like
[1:23:43] the water in the ocean you tickler
[1:23:46] spoonful of water and you have all the
[1:23:48] ocean there the contents of it if you
[1:23:51] take chemicals of the ocean water you
[1:23:53] have in a spoon the same content of that
[1:23:55] spoon of water is what is in the ocean
[1:23:57] you are not the ocean the what the
[1:24:02] content is what you have so when you
[1:24:04] have a little bit of Gordon you all that
[1:24:06] was in good all the content of God all
[1:24:08] in mechanics Andy
[1:24:10] because of God is inside of you also God
[1:24:14] is God you didn't know what I'm saying
[1:24:18] you have the chemistry of God inside of
[1:24:20] you a little oh my god is God inside of
[1:24:23] you
[1:24:24] hallelujah like the fullness but you
[1:24:26] have a measure a measure of power a
[1:24:29] measure of overcoming a measure of
[1:24:31] witness hallelujah a measure of strength
[1:24:34] Oh
[1:24:36] [Applause]
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:38] glory hallelujah so listen is so watch
[1:24:41] Sudan watch now Christ meaning it right
[1:24:44] the anointed one flesh be annoyed with
[1:24:46] the spread of copies would have God he
[1:24:48] here we go he was God's Word made
[1:24:50] manifest and now he died here we go in
[1:24:54] order to pay the debt of your high
[1:24:57] Breeden that you could die to yourself
[1:25:01] until you are no more yourself but be
[1:25:05] filled with his word believe in his word
[1:25:09] then the Holy Spirit that was in him
[1:25:12] comes down to water that word to make it
[1:25:15] grow so you see all this money gospel
[1:25:20] all this blessing gospel it can't work
[1:25:22] because all the blessing doesn't give
[1:25:25] character it has to come to a place
[1:25:28] that's why I get it I'll just say it
[1:25:30] the dynamics have to drive the people to
[1:25:33] Calvary people need to die who do you
[1:25:36] hear sin I hate myself but all these
[1:25:39] selfie cameras have known it they can
[1:25:41] picture up themselves then love
[1:25:42] themselves and then technology come to
[1:25:45] make it even help deserves or more than
[1:25:47] they have selfies people love themselves
[1:25:50] but job see I hate myself
[1:25:53] I repent in dust and ashes it's a
[1:25:56] stripping of self that man must come to
[1:25:59] which is the cross because only they
[1:26:01] already meet Jesus is only do you get
[1:26:04] the bridger into the Holy Ghost your
[1:26:07] restore - even by the altar and through
[1:26:09] the altar
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:13] so much that he might reconcile us back
[1:26:17] to be sons and daughters of God that
[1:26:19] true the church true the church might
[1:26:22] flow the same life by the word
[1:26:25] continuing listen the word made being
[1:26:29] manifested as it was in Christ Christ
[1:26:32] was God's Word made manifest senator
[1:26:35] after me Christ was God's Word made
[1:26:39] manifest said again Christ was God's
[1:26:43] Word made manifest
[1:26:45] so therefore the pride gonna be the word
[1:26:48] made manifest because he is father
[1:26:51] Christ not just the word not just the
[1:26:57] word so this this is to shake the babies
[1:27:01] of the abundance and make them show
[1:27:05] where the pacifiers but you can't just
[1:27:08] sit here believe in the word the would
[1:27:10] have to become manifested in your life
[1:27:17] but because the Lord some phrases you
[1:27:23] must be convinced of that that you want
[1:27:27] your wife to see it the word hanging out
[1:27:29] to you
[1:27:29] she must jump as a woman are you
[1:27:33] I'm IRA you long enough I know your
[1:27:36] behavior I know your walk I know your
[1:27:37] talk so you see what I see in there I go
[1:27:39] in and pray that is the effect of that
[1:27:42] that that is the effect when when the
[1:27:44] husband started get in the groove of the
[1:27:47] word wife the chapter pray because she
[1:27:51] started see God then she said I see God
[1:27:52] whose the note and you don't wanna cross
[1:27:54] that you hear I mean you you want to
[1:27:57] walk right what about the wife no
[1:27:59] husband offbeat and she said a manifest
[1:28:02] Christ it's time for he Dupree because
[1:28:05] he know he can cross that nice going you
[1:28:07] see be honest see that was it says we
[1:28:09] receive Jesus
[1:28:11] that we receive Jesus good wishes Jesus
[1:28:14] we see man long enough 40 years we see
[1:28:16] the parade of the beef I call it the
[1:28:17] parade of flesh and blood
[1:28:18] there's no need for beef buried you know
[1:28:20] but there's no need for fresh parade we
[1:28:23] need to see Jesus and Jesus somebody
[1:28:26] ought to die somebody have to die and he
[1:28:29] gonna sing Christ somebody died in
[1:28:31] Christ another favor
[1:28:33] Christ not a flavor and somebody paint
[1:28:37] something on yourself I have a button
[1:28:38] Christ anybody will come on a button
[1:28:41] Christ we're not talking about new
[1:28:43] testimony Christ to be putting in the
[1:28:44] post box no we're talking about a life
[1:28:46] that begins to flow future begins to
[1:28:50] flow a power begins to flow as about the
[1:28:53] periphery second power comes there when
[1:28:55] you come into a sickroom as you walk in
[1:28:57] the devil's in that sick room of
[1:28:59] sickness that devil is no time to leave
[1:29:01] let's get ready to get your head rhythm
[1:29:03] we have to go know how the devil is
[1:29:05] talking that I'd ever say let's go let's
[1:29:06] go they are coming they are coming
[1:29:07] they're coming
[1:29:08] we feel them coming nearer because
[1:29:10] virtue is emanating all along you put
[1:29:13] your power as you walk into the hospital
[1:29:15] room as you walk into the sickroom a
[1:29:16] power is going inside of there with you
[1:29:19] and them Devils know to eject except
[1:29:21] take the leave and then leave before you
[1:29:23] even get there about ended kept there is
[1:29:25] time to pronounce the blessings of God
[1:29:28] don't you want to see that I wanna see
[1:29:32] that don't you want to see that that's
[1:29:34] what God promised a perfect Church walk
[1:29:36] in an order Oh hallelujah
[1:29:38] okay let's continue you know now watch
[1:29:40] watch and he died he give his life that
[1:29:43] he might send the spirit take his body
[1:29:46] up and send the spirit back to water pay
[1:29:49] the redeeming price he that believeth on
[1:29:52] me then he comes the Holy Spirit to
[1:29:53] water the same world now watch the word
[1:29:56] itself was lost to the ages so when the
[1:29:59] Spirit come the spirit couldn't come to
[1:30:02] water the word because the wood itself
[1:30:04] was lost so God has to come the gada of
[1:30:09] the scattered world and tie up the loose
[1:30:12] ends to restore the seed of God back
[1:30:16] again
[1:30:17] so all that luta left off khalood
[1:30:20] ability was justified by they were still
[1:30:22] drinking beer and smoking there wasnt
[1:30:24] sanctified they were saved because the
[1:30:26] word for that time was justification
[1:30:28] then Wesley command said you can't just
[1:30:30] be saved and smoking and drinking clean
[1:30:33] up get sanctified and Wesley brought
[1:30:35] this an invocation message and they went
[1:30:37] on further isn't that right
[1:30:38] so in every age had loose ends had
[1:30:40] things that wasn't clean and clear after
[1:30:42] it was sanctified like a washed glass
[1:30:44] here come the Pentecostals God poured
[1:30:46] his spirit and then the field is
[1:30:48] speaking tongues and so on that's as far
[1:30:49] as they go sell a baby stuff and they
[1:30:51] play with the gifts and so on and here
[1:30:53] comes a prophet to bring the word now
[1:30:54] because the word comes the Prophet the
[1:30:56] word don't come to a pope the word
[1:30:58] doesn't come to a church it will tell
[1:30:59] you the denomination the word of the
[1:31:00] Lord came unto Noah do whatever Lord
[1:31:02] came unto Moses the world the Lord came
[1:31:03] in the desire write the word of the Lord
[1:31:05] came under William Irene Branham a 20th
[1:31:07] century prophet according to Mark I for
[1:31:09] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:31:11] it's not right so the word came to a
[1:31:15] prophet to the Prophet about the word
[1:31:16] before word hallelujah
[1:31:19] so that would had to become a seed again
[1:31:25] so the first part of our ministry was
[1:31:28] tying up loose ends are you at me the
[1:31:34] first part of his ministry was tying up
[1:31:37] six yields of loose ends just going back
[1:31:41] and dealing with Genesis serpent seed
[1:31:43] and all different stuff he's gotta clean
[1:31:45] that up and then he had a message for
[1:31:47] the bride which was seven thunders
[1:31:51] that were kind of the brain was should
[1:31:53] about how to be peer would give the
[1:31:54] bride feet would utter to the bride
[1:31:56] would give the beer by revival
[1:31:58] you know was he had a special message
[1:32:00] for the bride not not wasn't his message
[1:32:02] because the Lord Himself he said with a
[1:32:04] shout so the Lord Himself which was the
[1:32:06] husband the revealed word came for his
[1:32:09] wife gonna send somebody
[1:32:11] he said Malachi 4:2 call out a bride but
[1:32:13] he descended with the message himself
[1:32:17] when you get a wedding invitation is a
[1:32:19] message that is a piece of cardboard or
[1:32:22] paper or whatever in between inviting
[1:32:25] you to a wedding it's written but that's
[1:32:27] what Bertram was he came as a messenger
[1:32:29] to bring the invitation to the wedding
[1:32:32] supper of the Lamb
[1:32:33] hallelujah for the bride to get a call
[1:32:36] to respond is not right so the seventh
[1:32:39] under is an invitation of life so your
[1:32:42] life to be changed
[1:32:43] God is not forcing anything about on you
[1:32:45] you could see a church member if you
[1:32:47] want you could say ordinary if you want
[1:32:49] or you could be like Samsung but the
[1:32:51] Spirit came upon him you you and I said
[1:32:57] you could still ordinary or you could be
[1:33:00] like Samsung Samsung was not ordinary he
[1:33:03] had seven locks he had seven thunders
[1:33:05] yet seven virtues he had several
[1:33:09] mysteries he had seven voices you ever
[1:33:16] seen Roy's seven locks was the key to
[1:33:21] his power and strength that was sealed
[1:33:25] as a mystery to Samson alone Samson
[1:33:29] alone held the secret of the power that
[1:33:31] he had no Samson wasn't a big small
[1:33:33] muscular man like what you see on papers
[1:33:35] and Biggles honk-honk muscles that will
[1:33:38] be this around other God become Adam and
[1:33:39] strong that way moving this ominous
[1:33:41] sound was an ordinary guy but when the
[1:33:43] Spirit come upon him he did some
[1:33:47] extraordinary things at one time the
[1:33:53] court Samson inside and they closed the
[1:33:55] gate you know how to greet those hands
[1:33:57] big gates
[1:33:58] Samson take off the gate with the pose
[1:34:02] and carried on a hill
[1:34:05] Samson didn't even bother to even check
[1:34:07] to see the days of heavy Decatur's he
[1:34:09] just take the gate open opposing
[1:34:11] continue or can attack the gate they can
[1:34:14] lock sounds male
[1:34:15] Samson beaten lion Samson some thousand
[1:34:18] men get and be done with Samson was just
[1:34:20] different why the Spirit came upon him
[1:34:25] hallelujah and activated the power
[1:34:28] inside of her spirit he was a channel to
[1:34:33] which God could through through when God
[1:34:36] sees Samson God said here is my spirit
[1:34:38] flowing freely or I could use him I
[1:34:42] could work here the devil sat down in
[1:34:45] his boardroom and said this cannot
[1:34:47] continue
[1:34:48] week although this month umpires get a
[1:34:51] plan Cola his agent get the spies
[1:34:55] interview Delilah in the spirit realm
[1:34:58] I'm still undecided set a honey trap
[1:35:01] they call it for Samson honey trap did I
[1:35:04] not looking good walking good talking
[1:35:08] good and Samson get activated with like
[1:35:11] in Delilah that was the beginning of his
[1:35:14] fall but God had another plan besides
[1:35:17] the devil of a plan
[1:35:19] God was planning on top of his plan
[1:35:20] because God had a plan to put something
[1:35:24] in the right position to get more
[1:35:27] results that he could ever get before so
[1:35:31] why the devil is working God see moving
[1:35:33] so I remove so let's move
[1:35:39] let the battle roll you may be seated
[1:35:44] here Delilah says Samson ways a secret
[1:35:47] some subtle play games with Delilah
[1:35:49] retire Cordova lose my strength tie the
[1:35:52] cord he break it he laughing it's a joke
[1:35:54] film because even though he Lyon the
[1:35:57] power still there with him because God
[1:36:00] has saved a lie there'll be no power

[1:36:04] will be with you to break this secret
[1:36:06] keep it silent don't let the devil know
[1:36:08] nothing about it
[1:36:12] Sampson sided one of her games and so on
[1:36:15] and on Delilah where I'm wrong and I we
[1:36:17] devil doesn't know where we you dog
[1:36:21] until Samson decided to give away the
[1:36:24] secret he bricked that seal of silence
[1:36:27] over his life of the secret of his power
[1:36:31] give it to the liner and the liner no
[1:36:34] fully anointed get him and cut off his
[1:36:36] locks and Samson wake up as if you're
[1:36:40] gonna wake up at power i'll only
[1:36:41] recognize the par was not there he was
[1:36:45] ordinary hope you understand this you
[1:36:48] Christians sitting here with all gods
[1:36:51] Greece and presence and power you are
[1:36:55] ordinary
[1:36:59] so really come with a grateful heart
[1:37:03] have a graceful heart a grateful heart a
[1:37:08] thankful heart you may not be where you
[1:37:10] wanna be no but be grateful
[1:37:12] don't act arrogant and rude as if God or
[1:37:16] you something so don't even want the
[1:37:22] story the bind Samson dig out his eyes
[1:37:26] something's not blind I'll go out
[1:37:29] watching something that some years to go
[1:37:31] to his stuff except this grinding but go
[1:37:34] I have a plan
[1:37:35] and afterwards they wanted the ten
[1:37:37] minutes it being on Samson my you see
[1:37:41] where you are doesn't mean where you
[1:37:43] wanna be that way devil understand and
[1:37:46] you have to understand your present
[1:37:48] condition doesn't mean that next two
[1:37:50] years or next six months you will be
[1:37:52] still being that condition so even
[1:37:54] though Samson was born let's say for
[1:37:55] five years Brian week that time the
[1:37:59] secret deluxe going back I will restore
[1:38:03] share the Lord directed cut some but not
[1:38:07] all he kept going any routes because the
[1:38:10] routes gone too deep you see the devil
[1:38:12] only came in the beginning but you were
[1:38:14] before the beginning the devil that only
[1:38:17] stopped when he didn't he gonna dick
[1:38:20] opted in the beginning but was he
[1:38:22] breached in the beginning he can't go
[1:38:24] beyond that but when week ago before
[1:38:25] there was a beginning we before the
[1:38:28] foundation of the world we could we have
[1:38:30] our roots but deeper than in the
[1:38:33] beginning so that there was only cut off
[1:38:35] in the beginning but Samson had deeper
[1:38:38] roots than that
[1:38:39] so those roots brought back the here it
[1:38:42] brought back the strength it brought
[1:38:44] back the word it brought back the cedar
[1:38:47] but there was no visible evidence of
[1:38:50] power they thought was the same weak man
[1:38:52] that he was five years ago they thought
[1:38:54] he was the same weak man he was seven
[1:38:57] eight ten years ago but this time what
[1:39:00] was restored the word was restored he
[1:39:02] was waitin for the water in spirit
[1:39:05] of the Holy Ghost but more than that he

[1:43:36] God outta tune with the program of God
[1:43:39] God tell Samuel L are anointed one of
[1:43:43] the son of Jesse to be king over Israel
[1:43:46] nobody could stop that nobody could
[1:43:49] change that when God speaks it cut to

[1:44:17] god that's rays of kings and for those
[1:44:20] pulled on kings
[1:44:21] what does raise up people and for the
[1:44:24] shift people the angel of God is on the
[1:44:27] earth sits and things are wrong moving
[1:44:31] things are wrong for the kingdom of God
[1:44:34] for the coming of the Lord
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:40] friends you may be seated
[1:44:43] you can't serve God from a historical
[1:44:49] perspective you can't say you were
[1:44:53] blessed five years ago and you are
[1:44:55] forever blessed because God bless you
[1:44:57] five years ago you cut the serve God
[1:45:00] daily you cut the serve him still
[1:45:03] you can't go back because when the same
[1:45:06] people that God brought Oh God till
[1:45:10] because of the unbelief samuel was told
[1:45:18] to go and anoint one of the son of Jesse
[1:45:21] Samuel is trembling he saves for here
[1:45:24] that saw will kill me
[1:45:26] condemned is a good walk against the
[1:45:28] king they will kill you you don't broad
[1:45:30] cross don't go those guys they will kill
[1:45:32] you
[1:45:32] yes that's right they're playing games
[1:45:34] and roses go to Samuel just have a
[1:45:38] feasts and write just in his sons then
[1:45:41] let me come and sacrifice to come back
[1:45:42] to worship God give him a cover to use
[1:45:45] in order to bring the sons there
[1:45:48] God knew David wasn't gonna be there he
[1:45:50] knows all things
[1:45:51] Here Come Jesse Samuel with the Horn of
[1:45:54] oil and he saw the full Sun come by Elia
[1:45:58] by name I believe it was and I said
[1:46:01] surely this is he
[1:46:02] and God whispered it is God don't see
[1:46:05] the way mind sees mine see the suit man
[1:46:08] see to stay mine see how long man
[1:46:11] preacher man sees so much repetition and
[1:46:13] a few of others but God sees the heart
[1:46:16] hallelujah Samuel have the Horn of oil
[1:46:19] to anoint one of the son of Jesse to be
[1:46:22] king
[1:46:24] because in those days you have to be
[1:46:26] anointed to be king
[1:46:28] you can't take a crown and put your head
[1:46:30] and say I am King that is dictatorship
[1:46:33] like when you take crone in God's
[1:46:36] program you have to be anointed to be
[1:46:39] king you can't just say I am the leader
[1:46:42] says who your point is every that will
[1:46:45] go ahead feel free God have to anoint
[1:46:49] to be king so Samuel is there waiting
[1:46:52] what are you waiting for
[1:46:53] spirit witness the spirit is what
[1:46:55] witnesses the spirit not defy senses the
[1:46:57] spirit so you kind of look at height you
[1:47:00] can look at teachings and preachings and
[1:47:02] get some talent he's looking for heart
[1:47:05] so this man passed that man pass all of
[1:47:08] them pass so I'm gonna say but I ain't
[1:47:10] got no witness do you have any more sons
[1:47:13] because God can't lie if God telling me
[1:47:16] come on anoint one of the sons of Jesse
[1:47:18] they have to be one of this space this
[1:47:21] year we added one more David he already
