Father we thank you for bringing us together and Lord things are changing the clock is turning the clock of Prophecy the clock of time just over in Rwanda where 5,000 churches have been closed closed down in Nicaragua churches have been shut down and their property actually sealed and this is just a foraste a foreshadow of what is yet to come because the prophecy is that this type of people they will be shut down God we thank you for this great opportunity to be living in the time to see fulfillment of Prophecy Lord for the bride and for the world and we come together tonight to reassure to get reassured of the promises that you have made to us and to ask of you that you would come and confirm your word amongst us we thank you for your healing virtue and your strength towards all who were sick and you have touched Lord to kzia to Karen myself and all the others who have been attacked in some way or the other and Lord we have come true come through by your grace and by your mercy to fight this good fight of Fate may we not take things for granted Lord but may we we understand that this battle that we are in is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness May each person here tonight be encouraged May each person here tonight be inspired as if you are dealing with them uh personally and individually not as a collective but as individuals wherever they are in their private room in their little room in their place of prayer anoint us tonight May the spirit of prayer and supplication come Among Us in a special way tonight that we could call upon you and ask of you in Jesus name you ask I ask it and father in meming as you told uh and Peter saw it when the Holy Ghost fell in cornelia's House of a truth God is no respector of persons so Bless the people here tonight in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome thanks for being here tonight and we consider this a great privilege this is the opportunity for us to to get a rope get a line that we could get an approach to God to call upon God we have all the days rest of days for ourselves most of the hours and time we give Caesar we give family and whatever it is the short time is to see how we could call upon the name of the Lord know tomorrow is a public holiday and we would see how things will go tonight amen you know my wife just shared something with me is so powerful that it's better to work with your children when they are small or like say for boys work with the boys and they're small than to try to fix broken men when they are adults and they are big the job is harder to repair and to fix broken men as opposed to work with these little guys who might be a little Troublesome running here want to settle down and stuff but as parents we have this tremendous opportunity to Mo lives they can only be m in when they are young when they are small all we get that opportunity to do some molding and I guess it's the same thing in church those are young in heart babes in Christ they get the opportunity to be molded when they miss a mark and they miss that balance later on you hear them talk about I know I'm in the bride I know I'll come back and they back for years and not come back nowhere they are broken they are messed up but tonight the bride have a Ministry that will go after the Lost not Eternal loss but the lost in this message there is a Ministry to those broken people some of them out there who are elected of God that God will anoint a bunch of people when they get to that spot and we are grateful tonight so tonight I have a scripture I can share with you from Matthew 7 familiar scripture 78 and also from Jeremiah 33 verse3 Matthew 778 says ask it shall be given you seek and he shall find knock and it shall be open unto you and everyone that ask it receive it he that seeketh find it and to him that knock it it shall be open now I know we read the scripture before read it again but I hope that God shine a certain light in it tonight Jeremiah 33:3 call unto me that's my title tonight call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not praise God and our last scripture I like to read is from Luke 6:2 speaking about Jesus it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God may God bless his word brother BR we are just looking forward for a great time in the Lord and with your prayers I'm sure that we will do the best we can for the glory of God prayer changes things prayer changes Deb to life life prayer changes sickness to health changes Sinners to Saints it is prayer you may laugh too much you may shout too much you may eat too much but you will never pray too much the Bible said I would that man pray everywhere lifting up holy hands so you will never be able to pray too much that's from a message called faith the 27th of April 1956 then another message he said friends you may laugh too much you may talk too much you may walk too much but you will never pray too much so I want to say tonight prayer you know people talk think about Ministry and who's pastor and Elder and Deacon and different offices and so on but prayer is one Ministry that you can exercise let me repeat that prayer is one Ministry that you can exercise and you can exercise that Ministry anytime you don't have to be a man to pray you don't have to be an officer to pray you don't have to be a Elder Deacon or whatever to pray it is a Ministry that you can exercise and you can have at at an exercise at any time so therefore for one of the most important thing you can do tonight to do as an individual is to humble yourself before God In Prayer um but Anthony s that without him I can't do nothing and the reason that this age is the way it is this age is the age where they say we have need of nothing in other words they say they are rich and they have need of nothing and they don't know they're poor and wretched this is the age of abundance the age of wealth the age of you know I was talking wife just there and thinking about I just a while ago before that cell phone had pages and when see somebody a pag that's a big thing could you imagine now somebody about Pages Pages the side of your belt it almost look like if that's caveman thing that's Bor Arrow um you with a page oh you have a page boy getting page that is so irrelevant now the children our children they know nothing uh the the the grandchildren and younger age they don't nothing about these phone you put coins and dial they know nothing about it that is ancient they don't know nothing about records about cassid players and so it's passed and it will never come again this age is fleeting this age is people dependent upon what the doctors say what the Medics say and they're taking it like if it's God say and they're doing things blindly and the thing of it is what science has presented to us is for us to have less faith in God and to trust science more if you see how things are unfolding they are challenging us to believe science to believe technology to believe medical breakthroughs and believe everything that man put his hand to and guess what the the what man is putting his hand to is the knowledge of Good and Evil it have good in it but have evil too it's not the power of God is not the revelation of God it is man at his best it is man as what he knows as his best just like in nimra time he got some great Revelation to to build a tower to go into heaven and and sing like Angel and come live like devils and God said this man is a dangerous man because they have one language whatever the purpose they could do they could do because see man was supposed to be God's of the earth man was supposed to be Achievers and yet the church is lulling and there are people who are stunted and people who are struggling to make step forward and this is where Jesus loosed a secret to us and I hope that we don't miss it tonight he said this not some Pastor say or some evangelist or some Apostle say he said ask it shall be given as a key you say seek and you shall find as a key this is Jesus speaking knock and the door shall be open as a key and we find out that the disciples seeing Jesus praying all night seeing Jesus pulling himself apart and aside to pray they recognize there is something about this praying thing and that what they saw in him because they couldn't ask what they didn't see they couldn't ask of him what they didn't know they couldn't ask of him what he didn't live they saw him living something praying something acting a certain way and that is how they came to this spot to say Lord teach us to pray because whatever he was doing they were not doing whatever he was doing they didn't know how to do it whatever he was doing it seemed like this was like a power source he was accessing through this asking and kn and seeking it is as if when he went to pray he got empowered he get got inspired he got the anointing he got something until they said teach us to pray and we know what Jesus did he taught his disciples to pray Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name he show where the father is he's not the mayor he's not the president he's not the Prime Minister he not an earth if we want his door he's in heaven and he deserves to be worshiped Hallowed be thy name our father is a king he is a kingdom thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread we know to ask and so forth and lead us not into temptation and forgive us Lord as we forgive those who trespass against us so he put the brotherly kindness inside of there he put everything inside of you and rapital and say pray and that is what we want to seek tonight to see why would Jesus give this ask and it shall be given we could sit back and say you know God promised this and God spoke to the prophet and he said thus say the Lord this and does it mean we don't have to pray just sit down and wait does it mean we just get old G and die just waiting for God to do his thing while God is waiting on us to play our part ask it shall be given what the promises ask and it shall be given what what he promised in this Jesus told disciples to go to Upper Room and tar and then you'll get perform and high let me just continue quickly okay so therefore one of the greatest thing we could do right now is humble ourselves and intercede for one another pray one for another to enter into your secret closet and pray and you bring the things that trouble you before God bring the challenges you are struggling to overcome before God in that secret place ask him for help what you ask him for to remove in secret you can remove move those things in secret what you're asking for in secret he can deal with it in secret so one of the greatest things you can do is to pray for one another and a sister gave me a a powerful testimony I was two weeks ago we had a perer and something struck her and she begin to pray and I I'll share it with you tonight in a sequence she start to pray for the pastor then the ministry then the elders then the deacons the ushers the musician Tech Team song leaders car attendant Sunday school family and one by one as she see them seated in church and what she shared with me was that she couldn't run out of praying you know sometime people pray and afterward they they pray dry up like you pray for Tom Dick Harry and you know you pray for your family in Jesus name amen and you're ready ready to sleep but this approach that she took and it has held whether she doing this that she could always pray for somebody and is not praying well you're not you don't know this person or they're not close to you nothing like that just praying for them don't have to be emotionally connected to them but you're praying for this one praying for that one and afterwards you realize there's so much you don't even have time to pause to wait you could continue praying but brand almost done so I just want to share that with you to encourage you because this has been a real blessing and she that sister got a real breakthrough in taking a specific approach I remember one time telling you if you kind of run out look to see who online who is connected in the zoom meeting and begin to pray for them but this is a good idea also that you could you know meditate on the order of the church or whatever I begin to pray and you're saying bless this one Lord bless this one you know help this one help this one you're not seeing this one your liver and so on like that like God's grace but you said when a baby is dropped to the Earth from the mothers dropped as soon as the baby comes forth it doesn't start start crying the doctor of the Midwife will spank it it will give it a shock notice it is now she can be ever be so mean and cruel but just before the baby is born there's a certain kindness that sets in did you notice a mother when she's about to be mother there's something sweet about her she's always takes on that sweetness it's because that little angel that little spirit that little Messenger to this little Tabernacle is ready to come into the world so what he's saying when a child is about to be born there's a sweet spirit that comes around the mother because the body that little baby body is coming out and there's an Angelic Spirit ready to receive that body that Angelic spirit is what brings the atmosphere of sweetness around the mother and when this Angel comes into the body that's a little angel on the earth a spirit that is ordained of God to take this body so that is how the spanking comes in now and that Spirit slaps inside of there gets inside there and then the baby cries out all right watch this now he says now then that baby has to have a choice it makes its decision so when a child grows up God will confront that child with that decision now what is that Spirit atmosph you want to identify what is that sweetness that sweetness is what we will call today brotherly love the honey and brother Bram in message second Lord we familiar with it talking about cleaning because the coin is missing she had a house cleaning time she scub the floor She swept the walls she took down the cobwebs she kept on until she found what she had lost and when she did she called a little s sister churches to come now and I don't care if you a Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian let us rejoy together then he prophesies when that time comes when the church is Bradly love when the church finds it holy decency when the church Finds Its place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us God wants the church to love him why would there be a need for the church to find brotherly love because it will be lost it will be something that is foreign they're going to church this saying amen hallelujah same book same tipes but a lot of bitterness anger Envy jealousy all kind of stuff inside of there and rotness now 1 John 418 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casted out fear because fear had torment hether fear it is not made perfect in love we love him because he first L us verse 19 verse 20 this the part we want to get to if a man say I love God I love God hallelujah I love the prophet I love I love his you know the message if a man say I love God and hated his brother he's a liar now we could polish that liar up but God says that man is a liar I love God and hate my brother he's a liar that's how God seen it not he the message not he in the front he he have a Pew or he don't miss service he that loveth not his brother here we go this is a test piece now he that loveth not his brother whom he had seen how can he love God whom he had not seen and this commandment have we from here that he who love God love his brother also so to me it's a a clean template that the love of God supposed to be able to be expressed by you loving your brother and if your brother is hungry or you could love him and speak the word only and say be filled that is not right so if you love him you would feed him if you love him he's naked you would clothe him if you love him you would help him if you love him if you love him it wouldn't say how you're going because you don't want say how you're going because he might say he had up and you don't want to hear that because you don't want to put your hand in your wallet to give him something to help him and you're talking about loving God God himself says if you love God you're supposed to love your brother also Jesus himself says by this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one another this is not a gimmick this is not a phrase this have to become a life Jesus called all all the disciples tax collector this one that one fisherman and whatnot and he gathered all of them and even though they might have dislike one another and trouble some with each other they H say get along because that is what the new spirit is about the new spirit is not the Holy Spirit new heart new spirit new spirit is to people to get along with each other in preparation to receive holy spirit because Holy Spirit comes in to get us to do the will of God with your old heart and your old Spirit your blood can't take this one and you can't stand this one and you like this one and all kind of all that one thing you don't like and whatnot that is foolishness because God love that's why he call us each one of us and we can say God don't call this one don't call that one so if we accept that is God's love towards us then we have to begin to think different about our brother and sister are you getting me tonight all right all right let's continue he's talking about this and um in blus name you know the story he says now the message is being poured into the church I mean know the story the dream it was a box and the water was leaking through then he says no church could hold the message so when you hear a pastor saying that what he has no other church has it he's a liar when you hear when somebody said their church have it and the others don't have it and because he have the Revelation and the mystery and whatnot he is an anointed liar he's a man to run from and flee from this is it here now the message being poured into the church itself right and it was leaking right out this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle he's talking the building now there's no such a thing individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are tacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church in a body a group therefore it runs out so any man in Trinidad out of Trinidad that identify or hints or try to imply that his group have it he's a liar he's false because he's saying clearly here that this Tabernacle not in the church or body or group it runs out this man who was pouring the water the messenger of the church pouring the messenger of the church what was the water doing it was boiling out the trash that was in it that is what the Holy Spirit does it boils it out so the holy spirit being poured out from this message into the churches was supposed to borrow the trash now here what happened next now the honey represent Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and this is the age I just got through telling you brotherly kindness is the age we live in Now understand this it's not Luther age or Wesley age this is our age because after ble can is what Holy Spirit as he slot there right so what you might say now look I sure like brother N I sure like brother Jones I don't like brother so and so something like that but just let something happen to him your heart is broke it just nearly kill you we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another but to maintain that in a group of people why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him at the altar you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with him he's your brother and listen he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you kind of stay what you oughtn't to do shunning a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it will just nearly kill you or that system I'm an old man I was once young and now I'm old I've seen it down through the age do that he people say I would have no more to do with him and something happened to that man it nearly kills him he thinks oh God and let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see his brotherly love it look like it won't stick but it does the honey it sticks and if one thing I want you to get tonight the honey do sticks second Peter 1:7 done and to brotherly andto godliness brotherly kindness andto brotherly kindness charity this what we quoted here from Jeremiah to3 he said call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not now that in the Amplified says call to me and I will answer you and show you Great and Mighty things Fen in and hidden which you do not know do not distinguish and recognize and have knowledge of and understand and as we close I want to close with this here Ephesians 1 verse1 15 Paul speaking here wherefore I also I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints so these were Believers that was in order these were the Believers that with hate and bitterness and so on he's talking about I heard up your Fai and the love of all the saints then Paul went on to say in verse 16 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers so you know Paul was a praying man right verse 17 here what he's praying for that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give you unto you what the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him not intellectual talk not information not intellectual knowledge the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what the riches of his glory of his inheritance and the Saints in other words Paul was was praying that they don't be dum dum they don't be baby Saints they have to be growing in Grace and knowledge verse 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us what who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above principalities and powers and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and had put all things under his feet and given to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that fill in all in all as I close let me see this here so the disciples observing Jesus observing how he prayed observing how he had this great power they ask him teach us to pray and Jesus tell them ask and you shall rece receive seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open so Jesus was urging them him that knock it him that ask it him that seeketh with a find not just one time but listen we have to also look for the Fine Line we have to look for what is beyond that you can't be in sin and pray you can't be have hate and pray you can't be in some kind of condition you have to repent and come out of the condition that you're in to get it right so with promises and God's words there's always conditions and when we meet them conditions it will come out right let's bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight for these things that I share with your people and may it find good ground Lord and may it grow may they accept your word to be true and that you are faithful if you said ask we shall receive then we could ask ask anything we could ask abundantly we could ask for big things and great things as long as our faith could believe that what we ask for it can be granted and Lord we want it to be according to your will bless them tonight as they get on in prayer may great faith arise in their heart to know that Jesus spoke to them by the word they don't need a tongues and interpretation to receive this this is Christ's own word ask it shall be given may they take it as price personally hold them that tonight ask it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open the ministry of prayer is here is a Ministry anyone can exercise it's a Ministry that belong to all of us may you so anoint your sons and daughters may they pray like never before may they pray for one another and share that love and show that love granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you I trust in that these things will have been a help to you and a blessing to you let's start tonight let's start and seek the Lord with all our hearts God bless you praise the Lord so we get on in prayer right
