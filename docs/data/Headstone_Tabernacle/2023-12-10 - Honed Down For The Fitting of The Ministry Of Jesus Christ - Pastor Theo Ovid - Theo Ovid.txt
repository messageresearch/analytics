confess our sins I'm confessing the sins of this people I'm confessing my own sins we have disbelieved too much Lord the hours are growing dark the Son of God is soon to arrive and I pray heavenly father that you'll forgive our sins Lord I pray that the holy spirit will now take every unbelief away from us oh if he could only get into our hearts there will be another day of Pentecost there will be such a condition in this church and this group of people tonight till will be noise abroad all around the country by morning Holy Spirit Break Every barrier of sin may it come to like a jet plane beyond the sin barrier Shake every shackle of unbelief May every Eagle beat his head against the Rock of Ages until the Holy Ghost take complete control Satan you are lost you lost the battle and in the name of Jesus Christ leave this audience come out of them for the glory of God good we give the Lord a shout in the house oh God I feel fire on every word praise God that prayer we feel fire on it he said come out of the audience praise God sometime you're walking here with Devils you're walking with religious Spirits praise God and the Holy Ghost by the word have to cast them out how do you think you get saved a demon was cast over you and you raise your hand to give your life to Jesus Christ hell is on the earth Satan is God of the evil age he's the god of the fourth dimension all the TV RS and the waiver ways all the Facebook all he's the God of all of that and God to bust a hole through all of that to get to you by a third pull message to pull you out and to pull your family out hell is on the earth oh give the Lord some Praises you can't fight hell with money you can't fight hell with your popularity you can't fight hell with your strength it's not by might nor by power it's by his Spirit you need power you need Spirit you need the anointing to fight them Devils glory to God loose against your life loose against your house loose against your family oh give the Lord a shout stop walking like ordinary ordinary praise God there only two levels one above and one below something trying to pull you down and something trying to pull you up and you are in between oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah my God I like when you get into the anointing I like when you get into the spirit yeah coming for some lecture yeah coming some intellectual interpretation you come here you hear the Holy Spirit ride on the word oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah I if you're tired worship him I if you're weary worship him I if back and worship Him is who he is he is God this morning deserving your praise oh give the Lord some Praises you may be seated did you ever hear a lamb die is the most pitiful thing you ever heard a poor little lamb when they go to kill it he sees even the instruments they're going to kill him with he starts crying and begging sometime ago I watch them they're going to chop a lamb head off I butcher to kill him when that poor lamb saw the axe coming he just started crying and going on I couldn't stay there I watched it poke the little lamb and then there the Lance knife go under his throat and then it's dying and kicking his hands are paain in blood he looks up to Jehovah and say Jehovah That should be me but the lamb taken my place and when a man went back with the same design in his heart he talking about when you come to offer up your sacrifice and you lay your hands upon the lamb and the priest skeleton stab it and you feel like jerk yes and you know that's supposed to be you but the lamb taken it your place that man went back with the same design as heart to sin that he ever had because the life that was in the blood of the Lamb was animal life an animal life an animal life Spirit could not come back and blend with the human spirit for one is an animal and the other is human but when Jesus died at Calvary and the worshiper ever comes to Calvary by Faith lay his hands upon the head of the Son of God when he's confessing his wrong and he feels the tear and the agony of Calvary that really paid the price the debt that he should pay he feeds at his own soul hear this part now and the life that was in the blood cell of Jesus Christ was none other than God himself and when that Holy Spirit that was in Christ's Blood come back on him and makes him a new creature in Christ Jesus therefore the man's spirit is Blended out and God come in and take over Oh Glory of God so in other words Hallelujah he said your spirit is Blended out and the Holy Ghost Blends in and takes over isn't that right then they got fellowship with one another and the Very God that created heaven and earth that wrote this word dwells in you and you will believe everything God wrote is the truth you will accept it and believe it and hold on to it and you will have Fellowship oh give the Lord Praises praise God we were born in sin we were shaping leave the children alone they would lie they will steal they will fornicate they will do whatever wrong because that's the nature inside of them something has to happen from above glory to God notice a lot of these big rich people have one child and after a while they commit suicide because they have all the house for the child cars for the child they give the child everything the child do have to labor for nothing the child you have to work this one is a multi-millionaire this one is a multi-billionaire but the child is wrecked and ruined because the child didn't come a normal life Oh Glory to God life itself is very stressful and painful but God put it that way like the chicken in the eggshell if you help it you will kill it it had to pip it had to boss it had to break and today you come to church there are things you have to break out of you have to boss you have to hit you have to keep nudging nudging nudging but the beauty about breaking up once you break out the devil can put you back in oh give the Lord I shout one there's a barrier one there's a hindrance once there's a [Applause] limitation even jobwise even business- wise once you break out a certain level they can't push you back in because you break out Hallelujah and I feel we have got to break out we must well break out today we must break out some point in time why why today can't be that day that you break out that you break get [Applause] [Music] true may see talk about the plane breaking the song barrier and when it's about to break the song barrier he say it be rocking and shaking but once it bust through the b b barrier it is free sailing then oh glory to God you got to see what you got to break through sometime you're finding so resistance you're finding so opposition you're finding so much of pressure you got to break through you got to want to break through Oh Glory to God you didn't think Oh Glory to God that Joseph had pressure when his brother sold him out you didn't think it was a hard experience for Joseph it was a bitter experience nobody want to go through that your own Brethren sell you out your own Breen sell you to strangers with a different tongue and different language but Joseph couldn't see down the road but God had a vision for Joseph and God have a vision for you you can't see down the road but down the road have a higher order down the road have a higher purpose down the road the pressure the resistance that you're getting right now is for you to break past break further climb higher move up oh give the Lord I shout glory to God don't let this present World keep you down don't let the shackles you're walking with chains on your feet but today I want all to break those chains oh give the Lord a shout when you have shackles the devil he all them Chains Them chains walking and you're walking but you're in prison you're walking in prison you're coming to church but you're in prison you're saying amen but you're in prison but let God break those chains oh God them prison bars you're coming out oh give the Lord some Praises let's go he's talking about the virtues and you know we have natural virtues natural Temperance natural patience natural knowledge natural and some people mistake these natural things for Jesus things it's not your patience is not your faith it's the faith of Jesus Christ virtue of Jesus Christ Temperance of Jesus Christ all right listen to The Prophet Temperance watch and at Faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh lack of control right so we are talking about Holy Spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue yesterday we talked about that a little bit about your tongue do you could say the right thing that a woman with the daughter V the devil and and you say for this saying your daughter is made whole and you can say the wrong thing too and instead of getting your Devil's leave you get Devils come one time the children was disrespectful Elijah and then some beers he cursed them and some beers come and kill them so you could actually least say the wrong thing and be judged and you could say the right thing and you be blessed the thief on the cross he says Lord remember me the other Thief said why save us and save yourselves he said you old Thief you were all we thiefing he said that he say that man is a just man why you why you talking so we deserve this not that man Remember Me Just Two Words remember me that's all not I want to get baptized in Jesus name I come to the church for Serv no service no church there's no Bible just remember me and Jesus said today you will be with me in Paradise so that means you could speak the word and get a breakthrough speak the word and get a victory that's why say say something nice about people say something good if you can't say something good shut your mouth keep quiet do something at all now it means to control your tongue not to be a Tattler how to control your temper not fly like a to eaten bushot every time somebody set you're waiting for somebody to tell you something like a to eaten bot he said um not fly off every time somebody speaks cross to you not fly off every time anybody speak cross to you and God will allow people to speak cross to you to see your reaction to see your tongue how your tongue would deal with it add these things add Temperance that Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is this the word I'm preaching there are not deep there are no mystery on top here know they mystery coming down here oh glory to God there is not no mystery coming on top here where you scratch your head and want know what the pr saying there the Miss coming right down here very very low all right so watch Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody say you a bunch of holy R down there don't jump up and roll up your sleeves not that but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be when you're red upon R not back let him be your example when they said if thou be the Son of God turn his stones to bread he could have done it and show he was God but he had Temperance and when they pull on I pull him and belly B I'll forgive you for that they pull handful of beard out his face and spit come down the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing he had the gift he know all things for in him was the fullness of the godhe had Bley that had seen his miracles they put a rag around his head and say who tell us who hit you prophesy tell us who hit you he said now watch if you got it like that like that add that to your feet so there not a jokey thing then this is not a comic strip thing then this is real if you can't add that if you still blow up and Sass and first you can't add that it won't add then you use a tmin it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it won't work it got to be flexible like the rubber is so vulcanizers is heat and it connect the two piece of uh tires together you call it vulcanized when you when you finish vulcanized it kind know the difference because it now vulcanized so he's saying every virtue have to be vulcanized Oh Glory the heat of Trials the heat of persecution the heat of pressure make it vulcanize oh give the Lord some praises Hallelujah and when your faith and your Temperance become the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you have added to it oh praise God when you got the right kind of temperance like he had it will vulcanize if you haven't just manmade halfway souped up belief or Temperance oh I ought to slap him down you know but maybe I better not you know that not the temperance of Jesus only because I CH I drop a hand on him you know you know that ain't working all right all right that is in in the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add it but when you really here we go Saints with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be gone then it will vulcanize you can add to your feet all right the Great Seal measuring the permid the permid started to represent the church why right at the bottom and as it goes to the top it begins to get like funn in shape we find out it get right to the peak to the top they never that completed why because the Bible said The Headstone was rejected oh God so the pyramid always stands without the headstone a sign headstone rejected don't miss this the church has come from the beginning of the Reformation Luther back in the times the foundation Stones was laid was the doctrine of the apost Apostles Luther preach justification and now we find out in the days of Wesley you was a holy ruler if you confess Christ that was the new method and they finally got to a place till the holy spirit will fall on them and they will fall on the floor of course you don't hear that no more in the message but this is what used to happen they were so they were so Sanctified that it attracted the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost us to fall on them and they used to fall on the floor and they would pour water on them and fing with fans though like they fainted I have been right in their meetings myself in my 50 years I have seen them fall under the power of the Holy Spirit like that amallah and they throw water on their face and everything else the old Free Methodist many years ago that was persecution then after that age lived by wesle and came the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you are shaped up all the time so it's not just blocks God is laying he is shaping he is shaping the ages wide at the bottom narrow to the top and God have to start to shape you wide at the bottom and narrow at the top just as he bring the church ages he going to bring you no different the church AG is a reflection of how God God going to shape you and you find out you you are being shaped into the word image oh give the Lord some Praises as we of times say this building you see now as a building that you're sitting in was once blocks and sand and cement and steel it took labor it took building it took paint it took everything together to make this building that it could be shaped material having not is not enough the books and tapes have all the material but it has to be shaped so there's going to be the rise of the stone Mason oh give the Lord a shout Give the Lord a shout there'll be a fold Ministry there'll be such a need for these sons of God with the ministry of Jesus Christ because you you have to be shaped okay the Lord I shout you not jumping up and going in a Rapture you have to be shaped to be fitted in you are Lively stones come on now not dead stones not dead stones but Lively stones to be shaped and fitted glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so come in the Pentecostal age you may be seated with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are shaping up all the time now remember the headstone wasn't on yet they shaped the church or the pyramid in shape to fit The Headstone but a headstone never did come now the ministry from Luther until the end of Pentecost minority and that's the reason he says the light almost go out in this age he said now what because of nicolan organized and then he break into this year now but the true church this is prophecy Hallelujah all over the world has shaped down to a place where there come a Ministry among them prophecy that's exactly like the ministry of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God so the ministry of Jesus Christ is supposed to be here in The Headstone Tabernacle let me say it good Hallelujah you hear it direct the ministry of Jesus Christ is prophesied to be here in The Headstone Tabernacle Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God watch they come a Ministry among them just exactly like the Min of Jesus Christ now what they got what is that they got the thing in condition and what happened next the rejected Stone of the pyramid cut out of the mountain without hands God sent it do you see it now we find out there's a quote I wouldn't read it that the ministry of Jesus Christ is to catch the stone man didn't cut out that stone so don't look to man Hallelujah the power to leave here is not coming by man the magnet to pull you up into the Rapture is not coming by man that Stone is coming Daniel said the dream is certain and the interpretation sure I saw the stone cut

they got the they got the thing in condition what's next this rejected Stone to the pyramid cut out of the mountain without hand without what without hands God sent it do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the Capstone and the Very one that they rejected through this Gentile age is Christ and Christ was not cut or put there by a Vicor or Son of God or some great dignitary in the church he is the holy spirit amen amen hallelujah say the Holy Spirit and the cup of the pyramid will be Christ coming do you see it so you have seven virtues through seven ages and on top they have Holy Spirit a rainbow and this holy spirit is to come into the church to manifest those virtues Hallelujah let me say again the holy spirit is to come into the church we can't manifest in ourselves we could manufacture things looking like it God not in the manufacturing business God in the life changing transformation coming from inside out business you see Moses with his intellectual conception kill a dead Egyptians and run out spend 40 years in the wilderness but when God finished with him and finished Chang him and transforming that same Moses come back here not a different Moses you know but he do have the intellect now he had the heart he had the heart for God he now has a burden for God's people he come to say well you know God tell me you could let them go please Moses didn't come like that you know he was packing a burden and that burden make him say Let My People Go he was feeling for them Hallelujah they they didn't want to receive him but he still know is it's God's people and Moses said let my people go and there going to be a fight for Ministry that going to for that bride to come with the authority to cast The Devils off of you to say Let My People Go you don't have to be bong you don't have to remain bong the devil is binding you but you don't have to remain so oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God hallelujah hallelujah they never put the Capstone on that pyramid it wasn't cut by man's hands it is God hands that cut that Stone and it hit the image and smacked the feet and broke it to Pieces what happened at that time the coming of that stone up went the church into glory in the Rapture up went the church in the Rapture with the coming of that stone because it ended the Gentile dispensation God ended it up with the coming of that stone I don't have to look for Israel for anything I have to look for that stone oh give the Lord I shout because that tone ends the Gentile dispensation and when that dispensation end not one more soul will be [Music] saved and we will still have church me see it good and we will still have church because there's a Ministry to go to people who are lost that cannot be saved they still have to hear the message they still have to listen and hear and can't receive it and the door is shut give give you a type sure Noah Noah preach how much years 120 years then God shut him inside this act and the ACT sat there for seven days some brother who here in Noah preach for all them years come knock no I can a revelation last night o I had a dream last night Noah Noah I see it now but Noah didn't close the door and one what what God what door God shut no man could open and what door God open no man could shut shut I believe the door open this this this morning no man could shut that door no man could shut me out the kingdom or shut me out of the power or shut me out the ministry they are liars they can't do that no man could take the anointing off the church off of you off of me go no man could do that if God put you anointing upon you no devil could take it off God called David pray and and they send for David because nobody else had the witness for Samuel to anoint and when David came got Samuel take the hor all oil and anoint them in the presence of his brothers there's always witnesses to see the anointing upon you and when Jesus came he said the spirit is upon me in other words the anointing is upon me for he has anointed me to bring good Tiding set that Liberty them to the B to heal the brokenhearted Oh Glory to God in other words about to start my Ministry oh give the Lord some Praises after when after when after when after busting the devil in the wilderness with a private encounter oh give the Lord a shout in the house Glory have a hope after overcoming the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life in a private encounter with Lucifer he was ready to go back into the temple and say the spirit and the bride say come oh give the Lord some Praises so the closing of the Gentile dispensation is the coming of that stone you believe that Hallelujah woo so let people think they go sit at home in a chair rocking chair and just perfect theel by reading spoken books and listening to tapes that is a deceiving Spirit you know that's a religious devil upon them making them think that they don't need ministers they don't need a fight for Ministry and what not they could just chill at home they're chilling they're chilling straight down to the tribulation direct line on their way to the tribulation the prophet we got more unbelief than ever was we Zing to the church now ministers organized themselves great denomination and they went over to some Seminary like an incubator chicken hatch them out and a grer bring them out and they know more than God than a hot and T does about Egyptian night what we need in our churches is a man that's got an absolute what we need in the Methodist Church the Baptist Church the Pentecostal church the presan church is an absolute a man of God that will stand tight to the word and to Christ here we go are you ready and to bring that congregation under that condition to where each member walks in the condition of this word so that's what we fighting for we're not fighting for the come the church know you don't have to come if you don't want to come here you don't have to we fighting for each member to come under the condition to where the each member walks in the condition of the word seeing that word manifested if you know God will not manifest what you are slacker while you are slack if you know that God can't work through a filthy life while your life is filthy Bible talk about if you sanctify yourself you shall become a vessel of Honor fit for every Master's use f for the Master's use nobody take up a dirty glass and drink from it they had to wash the glass so you have to get washed out that why they come to hear the word and anybody not taken in the word and hearing the word this they're dirty they're backsliding praise God if you miss a service you should be hearing it on the internet listen back to it because the word come to wash you and change your thinking and your mind like we say all all them Queen Elizabeth and who are queen is and prin and what not they born in they born Royal they born normal babies put them under the hands of Trin parents they race like trinidadians but they raised by nannies and raised by individuals to train them in the history and what their be value and their royalty and the and the father was King this and the mother was Queen that and everything else and they they they grow up into this thing well when you come to church you come to church to grow up into this thing that you could have conduct yourself as Kings and Priests royalty not not not dead caral church members but royalty where you walk like him you talk like him you live like him you act like him he is pleased with you he was please with your walk what he said about Jesus this is my beloved Son he's a rascal no he did not say that in whom I am well pleased and what did the son say I always do that which pleases my father go give the Lord some Praises oh do you see the connection glory to God hallelujah my I believe it is near Harvest Time the seeds have been planted yes sir denominational seeds the seed plant must have seed water before it can grow it must have water to fall before that seed that been planted can grow now the seed must be planted and then it must have water it can't be planting planting planting planting and no water all right you say brother brandham I'm going to express your thoughts here we have had the water so be it that's correct you have had the water and then he's not fighting them because he said I know torch he pick up some torch people thinking certain things he said now you ever plant cabbage or anything or seeds or something like another us usually they got some water there you pour a little on them that's right now wait what did we have in that planting time the former rain so you're showing that the water or the rain that first rain is the rain to put down the seed you just throwing the seed in the ground dry ground you have a little water you have a little atmosphere you have a little Spirit to put the seed in he said now wait a minute you take the word former in Joel 2 and the Hebrew word if you want to write it down m o u r e h Mor and get the Hebrew to interpret that that means the teaching reain the denominational teaching reain when for for that's right the great Pentecostal move they move up in millions and the seed has went for the word for the minority the groups he's talking about you the bride right now watch remember Mory is teaching or forar rine teaching rain went forth and what's the matter now she is now waiting for the latter rain and people sometime do oh praise the Lord is much better okay fine so what's the matter now she is waiting for the latter rain that is when she produce her fruits that is when what what produce the fruits the latain is what produce the fruits I hope you get her then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap if the denomination want more members that's what they're going to get that's what they have gotten the Pentecost are want more Pentecostals that's what they're going to get but the word here we go is going to produce Sons and Daughters of God that is coming too I feel confident I feel assured that we're going to see Sons and Daughters of God not humans but at tribute sons of his Spirit In other words powered Sons like in Genesis 1:26 let a sick man in our image in our likeness and let that man have dominion then if God restores the image and likeness with faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godness brotherly kindness and love that man the power of dominion going to be back on the earth and brother manam Vindicated it by manifesting super Church super Ray signs on the earth and said that is for later among the sons will be manifested in his fullness Oh Glory when that time comes all right let's go watch all right someone asked me to repeat the Hebrew word again in Joel 2 2 chapter so Joel 2 you know uh on the day of Pentecost Peter said this is that that the prophet Joel spake of okay but scripture have twofold meaning Joel 2 is also for now Give the Lord a shout some ministers don't believe that you know they fa jeel to is Pentecost and that's it that's Joel 2 we have a new thing here no no no that Joel 2 is for now let me say it again that this Joel 2 is for now he said Joel 228 where he speaking of the coming of the former latter rain the word former is is teaching in other words it will be a teaching rain and a harvest rain now we have had the teaching rain and we are ready now for the Harvest rain you know the first first rain is when you plant your seed to start your crop growing and just before it matures Hallelujah they call it the Harvest rain the spring rain and the rain is about June it makes a crop now the rain we find out was the spirit so the spirit is the rain so it can't be word word word word word word word no no no no no it has to be Spirit also oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah glory to God now hereen here what he say now now we left off and I give my thoughts on what the whole thing will be I believe that the rain has been brought the rain and the reason we are quetting down now and people want to know what going on in the message like if nothing going on like if nothing going on Among Us well we still bearing the reproach of the word you know some people don't know how to bear that the reproach because of barness because you can't produce anything to show anybody but you believe this word and they say where it where it where where this well keep on hold on you wait tell them seven T to that group voices to that group you wait all way you want to see you're going to see we have faith we have patience we waiting all right now here the prophet now the reason we are quetting down now is because the ground is already swn over we find there hardly what have been sown it went out to radio television tapes word everything it SW the country down it's planted seeds now what seeds was planted you cannot get nothing else but what the seeds that was planted you understand that now it will be the seeds that is planted now the spirit will fall give a shout on that one I don't care who don't believe that you know I believe with all my heart you know the spirit will fall and it will bring a harvest of the seeds it falls on remember that's all right remember out of that prophet's mouth he spoke all the seeds for the entire age even the future home even Los Angeles sinking even the war to come even all the technology we seeing right now he spoke all of that it came out of his mouth Judgment of Rome isn't that right Judgment of America it came out of his mouth but out of his mouth talk about a bride I believe the bride is called she is sealed to the kingdom she is witing the Dynamics to the mechanics oh give the so he spoke about you so you are in the sea itself so there's an anointing hanging over you right now tonight to fulfill God's word Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God Amen as I say that remember I think it was King Ahab when this guys in the battle and a man just shoot AR just want still kill him because he don't want to wear the king Rob that know that King you know but you see God had to direct that Arrow you know a man just feel let to shoot that man going there he taught that being this guy is a normal little thing he go escape but when God said judgment is Judgment when that hour of God's judgment loose you can't stop it

wouldn't direct the stone a rock a revelation God put in our hands those go last or finish Oh Glory to God there's going to be Revival in Trinidad oh give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah the same God that was with David brother Bram he's praying he's praying father so it is now at near coming of Jesus again just like the vine if the vine puts forth a branch and that Branch was a Pentecostal Branch filled with the Holy Ghost and signs and wanders of fruits follow that branch and if that vine ever puts another Branch it'll be the same kind of Branch we know that father by Nature itself and we do know that you can graft any fruit that pertain to that into the vine it will live by the fine and we know that we take an orange tree and grow citrus fruits of different kinds seven or eight put lemons on it go right in because it's citrus fruit it will go grapefruit many others tangerines many of citrus fruits and if that tree brings forth its own Branch again it will be orange Lord it'll be like the first one was and we believe he's still praying that there is to be a church in these last days that will receive both former and latter rain it will be scattered throughout the world in this loud years and age it will be a church called back to the original faith in God it will be a church that will have Jesus Christ walking in it manifested himself and the shout of the king will be in it do you want to be part of that church Oh Glory to God that's the prophecy hanging here this morning there will be a church with Jesus walking in it Hallelujah and what they're trying to do they're trying to this so this something else what they're trying to do they're try trying to manufacture Lin nonsense I'm reading he said nonsense why the Lin will sweep the world brother the ltin wouldn't be a local thing will we have a thing and nobody else have it that's nonsense somebody have a thing that your thing like Trinidad thing but the Lin is what is prophesied they going to sweep what will sweep the world brother being former rain sewing words he this brother Kangle he said former showing words that's right but now you will see what the Lin produces you will find out there will be affiliation the Pentecostal and all the groups will come together and will shut the doors on them guys and won't listen to it so the latter R produced the the the [Music] Press I challenge the minister s me but press here and press here them pressing their own self with their foolishness the Lin produces the Press because the Lin produces an affiliation that if you don't belong to them they cut you off and he said they going to shut down our churches they will have to shut it down because Christ will be walking in it and the same haters that hate Jesus back there his spirits come back upon them to hate him again and the bride will be rejected the bride will be Joseph the prde will become the rejected Stone oh give the Lord I shout in the house Glory and before the government could come down to close us down church people in this message have to fight us like Judas have to come and fight the Bride is a warrior know church member Spirits religious Spirits in this message they will curse and fight the manifestation of God among God's people how you think the message will will interpret Christ walking among the bride all the present play or they not play any Prophet meses so how that's why they reject it because they have their own idea of how it's supposed to be leave it to God if God says uh wait till them seven ters utter the

old man named Simeon Oh Glory to God I'm feeling good right now not feeling to preach Hallelujah God revealed to him he will not see death till he see the Lord's Christ the Grim Reaper w w waving his wine and showing him that he said no you can't touch me you can't what you can only watch but you can't touch I have to see the Christ first they give they give Simon a rocking chair to stay home for retirement he's still not staying home he's still coming to church because you know Messiah not coming in his rocking chair you know Messiah coming in the temple so he's making sure he's in service

could be blind and spirit lead know blind man went straight to the to Jesus oh give the Lord I shout in the house latter rain is fixing to come what's the matter still reading same quote the church is manufacturing herself something just like Eve tried to do she tried to give more light to manufacture something we have done the same thing trying to make something in ourselves I'm adopted how dry Jesso no voice no witness no father saying this is my son to you in whom I'm pleased dwelling hear him you do you m hear me because if say nothing are you still waiting yes sir father to talk to me too you know you I got Revelation that you adopted you keep that I have no such Revelation them thing is lying Spirits enticing Spirits oh God will tell you that and God didn't tell me and go and talk to me and I still striving because I get upset sometimes I get angry sometimes so I know Temperance is vulcanized yet I know I need vulcanization of all them things I need you go tell me what going on inside of me you know what inside my heart you know the battles and devils are had to fight don't look at me like I'm talking strange things you fighting the same devil too oh give the Lord I shout in the house don't open the pastor the pastor yes the pastor oh give the Lord a shout I to fight for my life like everybody else oh give the Lord a shout in the house don't watch this here now what's the matter the church is trying to manifest herself something just like Eve tried to do she tried to have more light we have done the same thing trying to make ourselves something in ourselves keep listen to this word brother George keep your hand off of it let God do it take his word and believe it hold it in your heart and when the rain begins to fall life will take whole and the word will manifest itself I can't say it better than that that's why quoting CL I can't I can't I can't deify that I know that's not a word I know that's not a word deify that's the first time I hear now note that one I Dey I can't make that deeper you know when the rain not if begins to fall life will take a ho and the word will manifest itself now Adam Bri could not with here this deep Revelation this is a deep one here now God told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth it was an uncommenting A Promise she was not his wife as yet because he had never lived with her so they were supposed to wait for a further Revelation as to how to multiply do you understand that God said multiply replenish but they're supposed to wait the further Revelation was going to be Adam was supposed to speak the word and Eve conceived by Spoken Word but because they didn't wait serpent come in it fell down into sex that's how we end up born in sin and shape iniquity so that's why the First Gospel Jesus preachers you must be born again of the word and spirit so you're bringing you right back to what it had in the Garden of Eden because originally we supposed to be born of the word Adam's son was to be a spoken word son because Adam had the title lead of the earth and he that spoken word he could have said tree move here mountain move here Adam was in charge of the earth oh give the Lord a shout but Fallen that Fallen man it's a different girl together all right the bride of Christ is not his wife yet all this phrase I I am the bride and I bride and what not that just train that talk that just talk ignore that talk I see not bright until he hit charity there's the connection there's the bond of perfectness that's seal all the bires in so in other words charity is rest Hebrews 4 labor to enter into the rest how you laboring with faith and virtue and knowledge you're laboring you're laboring you're laboring you're pushing you're pushing to get where into the rest charity is the rest that love that comes over the prophet he said I wish it happened I wish it happened all the time Hallelujah I wish it happened all the time something came he said something came over me Hallelujah the man chatting him and say you snake in the grass you hypocrite come platform he said come the devil he said love come over him he felt sorry for the man the man may be a half wife and children but the devil upon him oh give the Lord some Praises we have to have that love we can't be clanging sword and carrying one another we we have to have Love Oh Glory the bull coming you know the killer bull oh praise God and you have to be able to speak the bull language and the bull only understand the language of love isn't that right all right here we go now so she got in a hurry and she bought up with the child all right Hallelujah that's what Christ found Adam found his wife full of seed what disgrace that's what Adam found that's what Christ found couldn't wait and that's what the matter with the people today here we go brother George they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position last message I preach get ready you're about to be position on pleas what does that mean the real Holy Spirit coming to take the church in position they can't wait they have to manufacture something work up something initi evidence speaking in tongues to get more members in church got to woke up something I'm patri 4 I'm adopted potentially adopted somebody said that kind of mini adoption like mini Donuts something so Jehovah bride went to horing what did she do she brought forth a bunch of illegitimate again Christ bright done the same what's the matter can't wait they just can't wait he said they had to manufacture something they can't wait for the Holy Spirit to come and get into the church they have to get more in denomination so in other words the message not good enough we had to preach crazy stuff now and Satan have a bucket you know a deep he have lower levels you know and when he to spit out the reolution so many they snatching it up this white Horseman some and and something a newspaper mean something and and and the comment com in and that means something and that mean nothing you know and then and then could it be could it be that when Saturn Lin up with Jupiter it mean that we here and people Bing Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Saturn up for Jupiter and we are here here where man take a donkey ride and talk about Jesus right in Jerusalem Jesus that's Jesus right in Jerusalem you and your white donkey or White Horse brother Bram they can't wait for the Holy Spirit to come and get into the church see they have to get more in their denomination if it had stayed the way it was back Yonder a 100 years ago or 50 years ago when Pentecost first started in this Latter day when the word begin to be preached if it had stay that way here we go you ready she probably wouldn't have over 50 members today but they would be Blood Washed they would have the power of God in them and the world would be shaken under her tremendous impact of the word flesh being spoken word by word 50 people line up with the word rocking the world and shaking the world the world have to get a shaken we not leaving here quietly it won't be a public show that right take that the bride will not leave here quietly we going to make a lot of noise before we leave you here oh glory to God God will let them Devils know who we are where we come from and they can't go where we are going oh glory to God I'm excited tonight oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah my God today is song named brass and tingling symbol just become nonsense a laughing stuck a disgrace to the world he said what's the matter with the Pentecost of today they are man facturing something they can't wait oh God he said oh God they just can't wait so they commit adultery to manufacture something what does it bring forth like the first B couldn't wait she brought debt a bastard born child we are all children but God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to the original Sons and Daughters of God the LIF sperm of Eve never happened it never did because she mingled it instead of Adam coming to for bride when the time appointed would be Hallelujah just like Christ's will would have to come to the group Christ would have to come to his church he promised to do it we don't have to manufacture nothing we have to be on expectation and plead the promises God promised to multiply them but they had to wait until God's time and that's what the matter today they don't want to wait God's time they want to get something else so the devil has got the wisdom right there to give it to them to make an organization bigger than the rest of them so when you have a taste of mysteries that the pastor and preacher there to teach that and reveal that three four hours uning and afterward you Shak and said never man oh God never sees on F so and your same condition silly women Laden with diverse lust ever learning never come to the knowledge of the truth heaping unto themselves teachers having itch and ears woo Hallelujah couldn't wait so the sperm of Eve never happen hybrid of Satan lies his his lovely bride become polluted and so as Christ's bride the bride what made her polluted because she never stayed with the word now the reason that Adam bride there's three Adam Christ and God and he said this now the reason that Adam bride never did Bear right the life child is because she disbelieved God's word and the Coran Say Amen the reason that Jehovah wife was put away his bride because she rejected God's word the prophets and the reason that Christ's bride is put away in divorcement is because she has rejected the word of God just like Eve did Christ Pentecostal brigh did the same thing she can't bring forth spiritual word children for she's a hybrid herself so once they hybrid once they come with a wrong Doctrine and walk teaching and whatnot they come hybrid Death setting Church might grow you know but death is there because the bride is the original word she becomes a virgin to the word that's what make you a virgin you know when you're staying with the word no man interpretation an idea a man can come and tell you you are the Holy Ghost you know he's a liar talking no a misrepresentation of the truth talking all right so the true bride there's going to be one she is predestinated she won't be denominated because she is predestinated are you ready now here we go when Christ come to his bride she she's he's coming he's coming as a husband he's coming when Christ come to his bride she will be a virgin like Mary was for God will not bring Christ through the womb of a say amen amen neither will he bring the bride he can't bring his word through AO of his word them is horrible words but that's what the Bible says hallelujah praise God be in home Church the last day the TRU B will come pick up a pen and write God told him this super Church super race as she near The Headstone all right let's skip it he says now what he says the they will be so much like him that they'll be in his very image in order to be United with him there will be one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God theom can never produce this they produce their Creeds and dogmas mixed with the word and being the hybrid product the first son was spoken see the word of God he was given a bride he said now watch to produce himself that's object the bride is to reproduce himself you get that so Christ want to reproduce himself in a bride a bride is to bring reproduction to reproduce so Christ had to be unveiled through us all right she fell by high breeding but listen to how I want to get to from a little group of the true seed of the word god represent Christ a beloved bride not the whole group from the group of the true seed of the word right in the Mage Oran and seeds but they have a true seed of the word out of that true seed of the word a group coming out of that oh praise God watch and she will be a virgin a virgin of his word amen notice what Harmony I going to skip that they only do his will no one can persuade them to do half different they have thus say the Lord or the keep skill all right so let's kind of wrap up here now what is horning we talk about horning all right we talk about horn down to be fit into the ministry of Jesus Christ horning can be referred to at different things depend upon the context so we have horning as a sharpening process honing is a method of sharpening blades or edges typically using a honing stone or honing machine it involves removal a small amount of materials from the surface to create a Sharper Edge honing is commonly used for tools such as knives razors chisels and scissors horning is also for skill development horning can also refer to the process of refining or improving a skill or ability it implies The Continuous practice and refinement of a particular skill to achieve Mastery so here somebody say I'm honing my skills for example a musician might say they are honing their guitter skills or a writer might be honing their storytelling abilities horning can be used to describe the process of fine-tuning or perfecting something it often implies making small adjustments or improvements to achieve the Desir outcome for example a speaker might horn their presentation by rehearsing and making minor adjustment to their delivery or content overell overall horning involves the process of refining sharpening and so like that right now there's the part I want to get to here in metal working horing is a machining process used to improve the geometric form and surface finish of cylindrical surface usually inside a diameter or a cylinder the primary purpose of honing is to achieve a precise size smooth surface finish and improve roundness on the internal surfaces of parts this process is often employed in the production of components such as engine cylinders hydraulic cylinders other Precision components they are tight tolerances and excellent surface finishes are crucial oh praise the name of the Lord like any metal work process honing relies on a systemized approach of components working in concert to deliver Optimum results horing oil is one of these critical components now I did a bit a bit of metal thing in in in a school and had a a long machine and if you have to get it to a point have something spinning around and you have a caliper and you would measure the the thing of it and then you have a oil because it's it's a lot of pressure going on spinning spinning and easing out this thing fine fine tolerances and you have to measure the caliper I don't know what if I saying it right but that's you use but you have to have oil there oh glory to you have to have Holy Ghost there got to get the spirit there to do the holding here you can't really cut that metal without oil is a lot of Heat going in and the oil will be pouring over onto this thing that's spinning and thing like that Hallelujah the success of honing Des spends upon precise performance in each of five key components of the honing system the machine fixturing tooling abrasive honing oil even through the honing oil accounts for around 1% of total process cost selecting the right honing oil has a direct and immediate impact and so on when the whole in oil is left out of the equation it will definitely lead to reduced production increased cost and so on all right let's go that's enough technical talk about honing just just to get an idea of the word because we had to come to that pyramid notice how the pyramid is coming a funnel it's being honed down somebody had a vision years ago of people climbed the pyramid and it was falling off him because you see afterwards they get more steep so people climb and climb instead of fall off pyramid some a few was climbing higher and higher all right the people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and this church you see is coming smaller in minority but the BR referred to the chalkboard it is a whole lot sharper it come to a needle point until the church in the minority has got to get into a place until the same kind of ministry that this left because when this headstone come back he says and when it comes this headstone this church has got to be horned or you mean that commun going back home no you had to be hored in other words you have to be shaped in fine Precision to fit into this Holy Spirit there's a for you that nobody else could take your place but you a pushing yourself into the place you know you got to be cut to fit notice how sharp the pyramid is Fai shaped virtue shaped you can't take patience and put it on top of fith it wouldn't line up watch this all the rest of the stones in the pyramid are laying so perfect here we go that you can't run a razor blade between them and they weighing tons they don't know how to get them up there they don't know how they were built up here amen when the permit cap does comeall the permit itself the body of Christ will have to be honed not just some Creed or doctrine or something or the other we come true it will have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he and that ministry will WR smack together then will come the rapt I will say this way not before so the church have to be hor and the ministry have to be hor I ask some more things to get to you you know because when the ministry is hor then you could be honed because the ministry is what H the bride oh give the Lord a shout in the house and we read at Ephesians 11 for the perfecting of the Saints or for the holding of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body all right we in home stretch but BR why wasn't the Capstone put in it the headstone the top of it because I was rejected rejected Stone here we go right with me STI with me then those stones talking about you and I that fit around the head stone will have to be stones that will be so completely like that stone so there are Stones Around The Headstone notice you are not in ludia you been called out out ofia into the bride age the Holy Spirit you are going to be the stones around the Headstones that's the way God is bringing his church we are fitly joined together one at one Accord let me go skip notice the coming of the Lord Jesus is so close at hand until the spirit from way down here beely justification sanctification B Holy Ghost right onto the coming of The Headstone the church has to be so perfectly like Christ you see the emphasis over and over until Christ and the church can unite together the same spirit and if the spirit of Christ is in you it makes you live the life of Christ act the Life of Christ do the works of Christ we got a Ministry coming prophecy that's exactly like the Life of Christ that is not brother over's Ministry we have a Ministry coming that's a new ministry Give the Lord some Praises that's exactly like the Life of Christ what does that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord with his shout voice and Trump so that Ministry was identifi first Thessalonian 4 16 all right we be going on very good Hallelujah prophesy son of man can these bones live four stages to bring forth the church I'll restore sayith the Lord he said justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the back doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leave Pentecostal clapping and rejoicing what was the thought for was the word and the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection that Christ has finally after justification be planted Sanic be planted baptism Holy Ghost organization died out Christ has again seted himself like the cap of the pyramid the bapt Holy Ghost then they come of the cap what is it this part I want to get to now that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away and when he comes back it will catch the whole thing in the Rapture so this is not a gimmick glory to God Hal there's an intelligence to unfold this whole Rapture thing the Rapture truly is a revelation Oh Glory this is not a Pentecostal church this is not a Pentecostal church we come to church we're going in Rapture no no no no we're not a Pentecostal Church he's saying how it's going to be Christ going to be in our midst you got to be perfectly like Christ you got to be hone to fit in oh then the Rapture going to come oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so that's why you must enter into your place of trying where the word could be honed in you isn't that right where you could be formed into the word image so we cannot begin to shun our trials and ask God to take us out why not ask God to take it through all right and this is where I get the title from almost finished but Brandon he's praying okay going good I have 19 pages and right now we're on page 17 the very end musician come up please he's praying heaven hely father we are grateful to know that we are living in this last day just before the coming of that just one that wonderful glorious loving son of yours our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who we love are we know the Bible speaks of the appearing before the coming and there's a great difference in the word appearing and then coming now father we realize that the church has come through the stage of justification come to the stage of sanctification come to the stage of receiving the Holy Ghost now here we go and I get title from the stones are being honed down for the fitting of the ministry of Jesus Christ when I see it so I say Wow to blend right in to take the church we thank thee for this father we are so glad we could put trust in you what your word says true it can never fail God we are looking for a Revival we are looking for for just these little short few nights we got here that you will send the fire off the altar these people father great many of them are believers receive the Holy Spirit surely the Holy Spirit would know the word I pray Heavenly Father you'll confirm it tonight let it be known that thou God and the time is drawing now for we ask it in Jesus name m come up please there already 18 pages and a little bit so we down to the end here now my God you been a great audience this have been a special things that I wanted to teach I have something on blending I ain't get there yet but it's the same thing and you know when you find an egg when you bust some eggs and so on you have to whisk it you have to blend it if you don't blend it it just wouldn't come out right and that's what God have to do take us on whip us up a little bit blend you in all right here we go final quotes what good would be Stones be if you pile them up let them lay there it might be better out there than pile them up together they won be they won't be they might be needed out de that's right stone is no good without a stone Mason no no no sorry okay I'm no I miss sorry I miss miss part of the quote what good is Stones if you haven't got a stone Mason to shape them out confession is Stones when Peter made his confession Jesus said Peter a little Stone but what good is a stone if there isn't a stone Mason there to shape him into a Son of God plain books and tape that can't do it it need a stone Mason the tapes is the material you are Sons it take a stone meon to shape you into a Son of God that is where a fivefold come for the Min work of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ is not man's Ministry it's Jesus ministry here we go what good is a stone if there isn't a stone Mason there to shape him into the Son of God you are just piling up rocks it isn't going to Bitter good the water wear it away the stone so people sit down as Stone they had taken the word they had the old interpretation they had a dream last night and they preaching word and only water is wearing them and them getting we too the water wear it the stone that's right all right what good is Stones if you got a stone a good sharp tool to shape him into The Fitting Place in the house of God just want to ask you what good decisions what good you're putting up your name in the book what good you come to join the church if the stone Miss isn't dear that will shape that and make them quit this and that and cut them and make them over this way and square them up and make them like Christians that set in the house of God with signs following the Believers then brother Anthony prophesy that end time evangelism is taking the stones and shaping them so it's not just us coming together it's you coming to be shaped that's right the ministry had to be shaped to fit the ministry of Jesus Christ but then you as Believers have to be shaped into a perfect man so you're going to be honed into the stature of a perfect man could we give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah what what good would the stones be if we just pile them up let them lay where they at Hallelujah he said what Jesus concer us not members he concer us God has always tried to get one man in his hand that's all he needs he's one man and he will do his work through the years just think if you can only find one righteous man in time of Noah time of Mo look at Samson see God can only use what you surrender to him Samson was a big strong man he had lost of strength Samson surrendered his strength to God but he would didn't give his heart he gave his heart to the they could something and that's what the matter with the people today brother they'll reach down and pay off debts and things like that and build bigger denomination and so forth like that when it comes to giving the heart they won't do it let's stand and let's praise [Music] God [Music] hallelujah and the T of this world will grow strange him in the light of his glory great why don't you
