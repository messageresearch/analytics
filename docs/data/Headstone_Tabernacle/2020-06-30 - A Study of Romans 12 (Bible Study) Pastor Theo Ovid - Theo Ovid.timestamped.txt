[3:29] the spirits at work right Trinidad no
[3:32] China come out and something happen like
[3:33] this all of a sudden overnight what has
[3:37] happened what happened last night what
[3:38] happened and it just takes some you move
[3:42] some action something like that it
[3:45] changes everything
[3:47] and just as in the natural thing could
[3:49] happen overnight in this spiritual
[3:52] change could happen overnight for you
[3:55] this is what you have to believe so
[3:57] tonight I'll be taking this Bible study
[4:01] tonight I really appreciate the what but
[4:04] I is eckle done for the last couple of
[4:06] sessions and it falls my lot to take
[4:09] tonight tonight I want to take a study
[4:14] of Romans chapter 12 you have to find it
[4:18] here because I want to read a scripture
[4:20] before that I want to read a scripture
[4:22] from Luke chapter 23 and verse 30 sheet
[4:25] of 46 if you have your Bibles you could
[4:27] turn to it Luke chapter 23 verse 33 to
[4:31] 46 and when we come into the Bible study
[4:34] night walk with your Bibles have your
[4:36] Bibles okay walk with a man and really
[4:40] from verse 33 of Luke 23 and when they
[4:42] would come to the place which is called
[4:45] Calvary dear they crucified Him and the
[4:49] malefactors one on the right hand the
[4:52] other on the left then said Jesus Father
[4:55] forgive them for they know not what they
[4:57] do and they parted his raiment and cast
[5:00] lots the people stood beholding and the
[5:03] rulers also with them derided him saying
[5:06] he saved others let him save himself if
[5:08] he be Christ the chosen of God and the
[5:11] soldiers also mocked him coming to him
[5:14] or fail him vinegar and saying if thou
[5:17] be the King of the Jews save thyself and
[5:19] the superscription also was written over
[5:22] him
[5:23] in letters of greek latin and hebrew
[5:25] this is the king of the jews and one of
[5:27] the malefactors which were hanged real
[5:30] on him saying if thou be Christ see thy
[5:32] service
[5:32] the other answering rebuked him saying
[5:35] thou shalt not fear God seeing thou at
[5:38] the scene of the same condemnation and
[5:41] we indeed justly for what we received
[5:44] through Jewry what our deeds if this man
[5:46] had done nothing amiss and he said unto
[5:49] Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest
[5:53] into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto Him
[5:57] verily I say unto thee today thou shalt
[6:00] be with me in paradise and it was about
[6:02] a sixth hour there was darkness over all
[6:04] the earth until the ninth hour your Sun
[6:07] was darkened and the reveal of the
[6:09] temple was rent in the midst and when
[6:12] Jesus had cried with a loud voice he
[6:13] said father into thy hands I commend my
[6:16] spirit and having said this he give up
[6:19] the ghost let's pray Heavenly Father we
[6:21] thank you tonight for your word and for
[6:23] your truth and say your people got it
[6:25] here tonight and how I appreciate the
[6:28] fact that it would come to hear your
[6:30] word and there's always them a blessing
[6:32] to hear it to read it to study it God
[6:36] and I thank you and I pray that you
[6:39] would give revelation inspiration a most
[6:42] of all activate deep desire and thirst
[6:44] in every heart here tonight
[6:46] granted Lord in Jesus name I ask I
[6:50] background what I wanted to sketch a
[6:53] night with this scripture
[6:55] of Jesus died on Calvary I want to ask
[6:59] you a question do you realize that you
[7:02] have to die I don't mean just like from
[7:08] a figurative like you know the other day
[7:09] I'm gonna die I really like not not done
[7:12] Jesus actually died
[7:14] he actually died to pay the price to
[7:18] redeem us I want you to think about it
[7:22] tonight
[7:22] sometimes we forget that we be more
[7:24] caught up in where Christians being
[7:26] Church we go to church we had a wooden
[7:28] board but the reality is this whole
[7:31] thing about church I'm going to church
[7:33] and hear a new word and that word is
[7:36] restorative because in the beginning was
[7:40] he would we fell from the word we have
[7:43] to go back to the word in order to be
[7:45] truly Britain into God that's why Jesse
[7:48] I must be born again but I want you to
[7:51] catch it that you have to die and die
[7:56] means of giving up a separation god I
[8:02] would that religion that is actually a
[8:04] separation death that is actually you
[8:06] being cut off cut off from what you
[8:09] think would feel what your ideas your
[8:12] life cut off as what that is about and
[8:14] some of us we don't like pain oh but he
[8:18] likes pain but that is painful and that
[8:22] is hard Jesus cried my god Wilder
[8:26] forsaken me he didn't know it was dead
[8:33] it was painful and if his ship from dead
[8:38] to Groot Groot is also people to really
[8:42] grow Easter day but about him said it is
[8:44] rare
[8:45] yet to let go the first boots that kept
[8:47] the second pull let go to second put to
[8:49] get the triple many times we don't want
[8:53] to let go we don't want to go past he
[8:59] pass in that sense when to hold on you
[9:01] want out something we could rock back on
[9:03] this life of feet is a life of real
[9:08] dying finally the Lord and finalists
[9:11] will but Paul said this ring deletions
[9:15] 20 I am crucified with Christ
[9:18] nevertheless I live yet not i
[9:22] but Christ liveth in me and the life
[9:25] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[9:28] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[9:32] and gave himself for me and poor could
[9:36] see that and he can recognize and
[9:38] realize that Paul is talking about it
[9:41] from a personal position for he give
[9:44] himself for me who loved me and gave
[9:47] himself for me
[9:49] do you realize it was the love of God
[9:52] that drove Jesus to Calvary the love of
[9:56] God in his heart to pay the price for us
[9:59] to be here tonight in this room for us
[10:01] to have access to mercy for us to access
[10:04] a success his blood and his spirit so I
[10:07] want to challenge you tonight that
[10:09] there's a debt that we all have to deal
[10:11] with a debt to self
[10:16] Dino to own cells own ambitions or teas
[10:19] or ideas sometime there's a freeze
[10:22] America and not depta bad self
[10:27] that took good cells and that is where
[10:30] we have to graduate to and come to that
[10:33] we want to see like tube and all the
[10:35] other brothers who came in the presence
[10:37] I hate myself and the best of our works
[10:42] the best of all behavior in God's
[10:46] presence truly if we are nothing and
[10:49] this is the place I think we have to
[10:53] come to you know sometimes I hear
[10:56] different preachers preach and one of
[10:58] the things that I look for and sermons
[11:01] or in messages is if there is anything
[11:03] about across what Calvary about dying
[11:08] out about debt to self these are cues
[11:11] for me in in looking at us women because
[11:16] if we see on just the intellectual level
[11:19] of information and just what is like
[11:23] revelation or we call revelation and it
[11:25] doesn't affect your behavior it doesn't
[11:29] bring about a change something is not
[11:31] right something is wrong so this
[11:35] exhortation or scripture teaching or
[11:37] study tonight
[11:39] is to assist in adjusting or attitudes
[11:43] because the attitude is what will make
[11:46] the difference in how we approach life
[11:49] how we approach things around us we
[11:52] could feel we could fall not because you
[11:57] want to feel I want to fall but it
[11:58] happens but again is your attitude in
[12:02] your feeling of falling this stiff on
[12:06] the cross I'm talking about the one that
[12:09] say Lord remember me
[12:12] it didn't absolve him for all his teeth
[12:15] and behavior and all his body
[12:19] crows he knew he was paying a price for
[12:22] his deeds but you know what his attitude
[12:27] made such a difference these are two
[12:31] tears
[12:33] two teams on the same level
[12:36] who did I'm skillful in order breaking
[12:39] hoses pick locks this is the alternative
[12:44] employment what he calls it they got
[12:46] caught they were judged both of them and
[12:50] one decide with that mount the burr
[12:54] Isaac spoke about some time ago one
[12:56] deciders say no you say what I save save
[12:58] us - save yourselves and the other
[13:01] decided to reboot that one and we he
[13:04] said of this thing but that man don't
[13:06] remember me and Jesus told him what all
[13:10] you mean baptized in Jesus name we wrote
[13:13] attended one church service without
[13:15] being ministers to some faithful or past
[13:18] or future evangelist he said today he
[13:20] with me
[13:23] the attitude
[13:26] ask you tonight towards the wood
[13:31] words correction towards rebukes towards
[13:38] disappointment you may be disappointed
[13:42] how does that compare with somebody who
[13:45] is in physical pain
[13:48] you are disappointed about something
[13:50] your hands and tuck your feet and tuck
[13:54] your eyes and tuck your ears in time
[13:57] your whole body is fine you can raise up
[13:59] your hands good your people can't raise
[14:01] up their hands good because their hands
[14:03] in pain how does that compare let us go
[14:08] into romance no Rubens twelve just fully
[14:10] Bibles a student for almost twelve I
[14:12] want to read from this one
[14:16] you
[14:19] I beseech you therefore brethren by the
[14:22] mercies of God that you present your
[14:25] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[14:28] acceptable unto God which is your
[14:32] reasonable service
[14:34] no let's pause right there keep your
[14:37] hands right there because we Google no
[14:38] new scriptures normally sacrifice like
[14:44] that things you kill the lamb to kill
[14:47] the goat you kill the ox is dead but God
[14:51] call us to be a living sacrifice I want
[14:56] you to connect that with Paul seeing I'd
[14:59] ideally it's a debt it's not you getting
[15:05] quoted or with Christianity I can take a
[15:07] paint and you're blessed and you know
[15:12] you won't grow to be in your business or
[15:13] your fears or your school or whatever it
[15:16] is but dice as far as you want to me yes
[15:18] me blessing you you don't want to seek
[15:20] his will it can't be like that this
[15:25] scripture here about living sacrifice
[15:28] resent in your bodies acceptable to God
[15:32] this deals completely unholy with
[15:36] sanctification and sanctification is the
[15:41] Liebherr part or the works part that you
[15:45] do to show your appreciation to God
[15:50] for what God has done for you this is
[15:53] what this is about right this verse here
[15:57] is a key to your blessing I beseech you
[16:02] I beg you to present your bodies a
[16:07] living sacrifice because righteousness
[16:10] could be done in your body and so is
[16:13] also sin the devil's job is to keep you
[16:17] in sin which is unbelief so that you are
[16:21] trapped not by the devil but by your
[16:26] decisions and actions and what is
[16:29] wrought in your own body
[16:32] No
[16:34] you heard by Isaac speak about that you
[16:37] could really see the right thing and
[16:40] please the Holy Spirit and those
[16:44] brothers who said let us go and testify
[16:46] to that lady who aunt Ella aunt Ella we
[16:50] are saved that please the Holy Spirit
[16:54] that please the Holy Spirit do we ever
[16:58] think what we see and you who it pleases
[17:02] or is it that we just please ourselves
[17:05] this is where we have to shift and
[17:08] change your thinking this here I wanted
[17:13] to see it as a requirement of God that
[17:16] you present yourself a living sacrifice
[17:21] not the preacher you into that
[17:25] not you are forced into that you have to
[17:30] be able to present yourself they'll
[17:32] always be sexy dressed women are wrong
[17:34] they'll always be temptations are wrong
[17:39] every person every man still have a
[17:42] choice whether to look for to tune his
[17:46] eyes that tearing of the eyes is yours
[17:49] God can't take a head and be sure the
[17:53] angel come in and take a pick up sheet
[17:56] and put it in for eyes you as a man has
[18:01] to make a choice whether to look and get
[18:05] infected or affected or react to that or
[18:09] turn your head in you tune in your head
[18:12] butter brownies of a cross and then from
[18:15] his car when he see all him Jesse woman
[18:17] and sex just what he could turn to the
[18:19] cross when you turn your head you make a
[18:23] choice a choice that God sees a choice
[18:27] that heaven records that you are doing
[18:30] something about what is out here because
[18:32] you cannot stop t he shoes you cannot
[18:35] stop what season is offering and
[18:38] presenting he there is a Jesus he said
[18:40] all these kingdoms are - it was cards of
[18:43] presentation to him and Jesus made a
[18:46] choice it is also written
[18:50] it is also written it is also written so
[18:53] the Bible is exhorting us to present our
[18:57] bodies a living sacrifice it is
[18:59] something that you have to do
[19:01] sanctification being sanctified means
[19:05] being separated separated for what your
[19:08] friends do what other people do separate
[19:10] it under the same weight a report
[19:13] sanctification I want to put forgiveness
[19:16] because forgiveness God cannot come and
[19:19] make you forgive God cannot come and
[19:23] make you drop yours that's a choice the
[19:27] hula or the hula grudge because all of
[19:31] this affects people healing all of this
[19:34] affects people's deliverance if you want
[19:37] to be delivered if you want to be healed
[19:41] switch your heart and see what is ideal
[19:44] for some parents they have children who
[19:49] may be upsetting and I have to choose
[19:52] about that and he turned it terrible to
[19:54] them and they could actually develop a
[19:56] complex against the own children some
[19:59] children develop complex against their
[20:00] own parents but when all of that you
[20:03] still have to come to a place to love to
[20:07] forgive to be caring to be kind I want
[20:13] you to also understand that a new
[20:14] message is second called the Lord but
[20:16] I'm talking about the lost coin
[20:20] talking about the woman who recognized
[20:23] the coin was lost and she began to strip
[20:24] the floors and shred the cobweb and he
[20:28] said this part he neighbors could see
[20:30] the dust fly I know many times I preach
[20:35] and I talk about you know when people
[20:36] want to hide inner circle visibly carpet
[20:38] and she doesn't let him cover it up
[20:39] quick on water because you know what
[20:41] people don't know the host at duty but
[20:43] this woman was so desperate I could see
[20:47] a fling any capital side I can see jug
[20:50] dragon if he blows side you neighbors
[20:52] what do you think is she going nuts but
[20:54] the fact is she was looking for
[20:55] something
[20:56] what are you looking for to me
[21:01] what are you looking for tonight are you
[21:05] conscious of what you are missing are
[21:07] you conscious of of what you supposed to
[21:10] desire or if you're gonna go to life as
[21:12] it
[21:13] you need to understand that if you lost
[21:16] something you have to find it
[21:18] he's on a matter of I might find it I
[21:21] hope no no you have to find the Bible
[21:24] said she kept Owen Brown says until she
[21:26] found what she had lost
[21:29] you won back your joy that's a coin you
[21:31] won back piece of man that's a coin
[21:33] there a lot of people disturbed about
[21:36] what happened in poor esteem and I don't
[21:38] know what's gonna happen tomorrow if
[21:40] they feel comfortable to work to go to
[21:42] work tomorrow the end gunshots I hear
[21:44] this here that is an uncomfortable thing
[21:46] but the fact is something called peace
[21:49] of mind and coal want to give your peace
[21:51] and are speaking about that at the end
[21:54] of this session here we want to also
[21:56] have prayer and we have some officers
[21:59] among us and officers that we know that
[22:02] we want to pray for them prefer the
[22:03] police and pray for the nation that God
[22:05] will keep us and I see that all is your
[22:08] senior scriptures here we want to be at
[22:09] peace as much as possible I caused it so
[22:12] I want to encourage you to the Lord that
[22:15] Balaram says we didn't come in to occupy
[22:17] a Pew we didn't come to Trisha hear a
[22:19] good sermon a community a good service
[22:22] and so on
[22:23] he said we come to church at check up on
[22:25] our God for a soul salvation and this
[22:29] woman her husband are gone
[22:31] she lost a coin and she wanted to find
[22:34] it before her husband comes back and
[22:36] before Jesus come back in in his coming
[22:40] we have to have all things that God
[22:44] require of us in this very hour let's go
[22:47] to verse 2 I know because say much more
[22:49] on that but we would have us to and it
[22:51] says be not conformed to this world but
[22:55] be transformed by the renewing of your
[22:58] mind that you may prove what is that
[23:02] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[23:06] God
[23:07] that speaks for itself the world is
[23:11] trying to shape people by the
[23:13] advertisements by the styles by the
[23:16] fashions he's trying to shape own
[23:19] opinion you know I was thinking when
[23:21] inter grocery and what hands first and
[23:23] then you know social distancing and
[23:26] stuff and I realize that true this virus
[23:31] thing
[23:33] it's like sanctification you have to
[23:36] wash and you have to wash for 20 seconds
[23:39] and people watching and and and we are
[23:42] fortunate is not run into our country
[23:44] could you imagine if those around you
[23:46] the country before washing for 40
[23:48] seconds ago was a whole minute because
[23:51] they don't want it and I'm seeing how
[23:54] people are being forced into discipline
[23:58] when we have to want disappear
[24:03] discipline is how you want to be able to
[24:04] survive but a man says the only church
[24:07] that was found in this last day will be
[24:08] a trained church it come like Joshua say
[24:12] when I bid you to shout show though
[24:14] shalt 'entertainment we forgot to give
[24:18] instructions that is why you want to
[24:20] know what is God's will what is God's
[24:22] will for your life be not conformed to
[24:26] this world but be transformed by the
[24:28] rear of your mind no you know what Obama
[24:32] said that after a while you forget your
[24:34] custom in his ministry seen miracles or
[24:36] what the miracles a good the girl custom
[24:39] and sometimes wonder if we just get a
[24:42] custom we just hear any word hear any
[24:45] word and you know it's a good word good
[24:48] message good simple this what you see
[24:53] you have to have a cry to get any spirit
[24:57] why it is that some people have a
[25:00] passion and some people don't ever study
[25:03] that some people just deadbeat one two
[25:06] one two and that dead bee can get you
[25:10] very far but the Bible says feed these
[25:14] sorts of things hoped for and so on but
[25:16] the part that gets to me is this he that
[25:19] cometh to God must believe that he is
[25:22] and he is a rewarder to them that
[25:25] diligently seek Him you have to have a
[25:29] hat for God and to know God you have to
[25:33] want to look his word he caught you
[25:35] would reveal his will you kind of got as
[25:38] a feeling no no it can't be like that
[25:41] what pleases God is your connection with
[25:44] his word the word is the pipe eternal
[25:47] you can do it the word is his cellphone
[25:49] what is the direct
[25:52] a live connection to God if you're still
[25:55] on his would you stay with his blessings
[25:57] he gonna bless you
[25:58] regardless of what conditions are on you
[26:01] remember I tell you about just stats
[26:03] talkin about um about the opinion bonded
[26:06] by a sin on by a behavior by an attitude
[26:10] never know the sonship cannot change but
[26:13] you could be born your son but your
[26:17] wings could
[26:19] a son but you're not free Samson was a
[26:22] son but his eyes was all because you're
[26:25] fooling with a woman who was the even
[26:26] belonging to his his arm is kind
[26:30] his people or the devil Sampson didn't
[26:34] see the opportunity he didn't see how
[26:36] the devil could use that woman he was
[26:38] just seeing her beauty a talk a language
[26:41] or whatever it is but he wasn't seeing
[26:43] the power of the enemy to would he
[26:44] wasn't see from his spiritual standpoint
[26:46] does he not trust him and this is what
[26:49] he'd ever like to do messy up in your
[26:51] mind in your torch in the action and
[26:53] attitude trap you set you up and then in
[26:56] your own heart there's condemnation in
[26:58] your own heart there is a Bible there's
[27:01] a force you don't be Liberty don't be
[27:03] freedom you know was he got something on
[27:06] you you know I believe you know the news
[27:10] with up in America and Russia
[27:14] this is was peon Taliban to kill
[27:16] American soldiers and the city president
[27:19] was inform and it was informed and they
[27:21] did nothing about it
[27:22] any question is they keep asking what's
[27:24] this Russia have any president
[27:26] why is he's not dealing with Russia as
[27:29] he or true it appears as if something is
[27:32] dear know what it is if the devil of
[27:35] something on you you'd ever look you
[27:38] wouldn't have defeat to really ask you
[27:41] wouldn't have defeat already at you win
[27:44] now before the traction panel get me
[27:46] Sita well if something is Dion yup
[27:49] attorney or is it get me I mean say why
[27:51] I should leave
[27:52] you know what is going on in your life
[27:55] you have no authority to repute me at
[27:58] the Kashmere you don't have that and
[28:01] didn't know you don't have it if you
[28:03] don't have the confidence that's why
[28:04] when them fellas was trying to cast him
[28:07] out in the name of the Jesus at Port
[28:08] Richard he said Paul I know it I know
[28:10] who are you
[28:12] so the devil hallelujah recognizes
[28:16] Authority the devil recognizes a
[28:20] sanctified life because sanctified life
[28:23] really is it is if they've already been
[28:25] ticked off that was a litigant rowdyism
[28:27] he'd ever get some boots and he's out
[28:29] he's looking for a house because you
[28:31] could only do mischief if you find a
[28:33] temple so he you can't find yours
[28:35] because he owed no when he recognized he
[28:38] has no houses all wrong
[28:39] he said I get seven other bullies and
[28:41] pageants worse than himself
[28:43] I tried to invade your life so the
[28:45] temptations grow up so much higher the
[28:47] trials who must so much hammer more
[28:49] naked woman the parade itself every
[28:52] actions and you see he want to get a
[28:54] doorway into your life he got come to
[28:57] the front door he could try a battle
[28:59] that is why we have to come now to close
[29:02] those doors and I'm hoping this kind of
[29:06] meetin and teaching and sharing would
[29:09] help us to close those doors because we
[29:12] could talk things and share things that
[29:13] we would not normally preach so we could
[29:16] close the gap and and squeeze on the
[29:19] enemy not just by Tommy wooden but by
[29:22] you examining your life and how you
[29:25] dealing with Julie
[29:26] if everybody tonight begin to take what
[29:29] they're hearing and look for life's
[29:32] application you not look at always this
[29:35] is not like a theory tingling you know
[29:37] like her you know like arm it come like
[29:40] you go to school yet the other you pass
[29:43] English maths chemistry and whatnot and
[29:45] then when you go to the job you don't
[29:46] have nothing to do with what you do in
[29:48] school absolutely nothing yeah but
[29:53] you're needy papers say you went to
[29:55] school but the job should go to like a
[29:58] time I I went for interview nah man say
[30:00] you know bunch all my documents and say
[30:03] Otis have towards porn
[30:06] see our biology
[30:08] I see a way this go solo he said we're a
[30:11] school of 50 years no like a dinner or
[30:13] two in sport but to me a thought spawn
[30:16] was just booked information I have no
[30:18] interest in horror told us porn but at
[30:21] the stick in my head they read that
[30:23] because I have an exam coming would
[30:24] spawn your answer the question take your
[30:26] pass have a pass but to say have that
[30:29] power toward us on I have no interest in
[30:32] all of dueling school but this is where
[30:35] sometimes in here any word is just
[30:37] information that's ruling off
[30:39] yes rule enough but what is it beginner
[30:42] take it and see what happens the more
[30:44] see what happens if somebody cross
[30:47] you're wrong ring is somebody wrong you
[30:50] let's continue and see what the Bible
[30:51] talk about it alright verse 3 if I say
[30:56] to the grace given unto me and to every
[30:59] man that is among you there we go
[31:01] not the ting of himself more highly than
[31:06] he ought to think but to think soberly
[31:10] according as God and Delta every man the
[31:15] measure of faith there's a big one this
[31:18] one is is massive in the amplified it
[31:22] states here for by the grace unmerited
[31:26] favor of God given to me I warn everyone
[31:29] of you not the estimate and think of
[31:34] himself more highly than he ought but
[31:37] ours not to have an exaggerated opinion
[31:40] of one's importance but the rate his
[31:43] ability with sober judgment each
[31:45] equality degree a feat a portion my god
[31:49] to him no this is where people feel
[31:54] they're entitled this is where the
[31:56] entitled one's come forward because they
[32:00] see themselves so high they filled after
[32:03] sit at the top of the table and Jesus
[32:06] gave a parable specifically designed for
[32:09] those of you that the entitled he said
[32:12] when you invited to dine at the table
[32:16] take the lowest seat
[32:19] don't go and take the highest seat
[32:22] because you feel you're entitled because
[32:24] if somebody comes after it any higher
[32:27] see more worthy than you you will have
[32:31] to go back down a few more steps back
[32:34] now so Jesus was trying to guide in your
[32:39] thinking an attitude of humility
[32:43] attitude of thinking yourself not so
[32:47] high but that there are always people
[32:49] that will be higher better more worthy
[32:53] than yourself it's a sobering thing this
[32:57] scripture could have a message in itself
[33:00] because I have seen hope the cause the
[33:06] confusion tonight what people eating the
[33:11] day they entitled highly favored under
[33:17] and in God's kingdom he is no respecter
[33:25] of persons said after me no respecter of
[33:28] persons you see he is no respecter of
[33:31] persons
[33:32] whether you are elder children pastor
[33:35] Tarun Dickey children whether you are
[33:38] elder didn't pastor minister he is no
[33:41] respecter of person he's discipline or
[33:43] this have been Moses discipline Joshua
[33:46] discipline people this is a God of
[33:48] business he's a God of his word let's
[33:52] continue who is for first we has many
[33:54] members in one body and all members have
[33:56] not the same office so we being many are
[33:59] one body in Christ and every one number
[34:02] one of another event then gifts
[34:05] differing according to Greece and is
[34:07] given to us but a prophecy let us
[34:10] prophesy according to the proportion of
[34:11] faith or ministry that has reason or
[34:14] ministering or he that teacheth on
[34:16] teaching or he didn't exhort it on my
[34:18] dissertation he that giveth let him do
[34:20] it with simplicity he that ruleth with
[34:22] diligence he that showed mercy with
[34:25] cheerfulness let love be without
[34:28] dissimulation abhor that which is evil
[34:30] please the that which is good and I
[34:33] think
[34:33] amplified let your love be sincere a
[34:35] real thing hit what is evil not all
[34:39] ungodliness turning half on wickedness
[34:42] but hold fast that which is good
[34:44] this is applied principles this has
[34:47] nothing to do it
[34:48] who's your friend who's that your friend
[34:49] Jesus had his own disciples when Peter
[34:52] said the wrong thing
[34:53] Jesus told him get behind me Satan
[34:56] it wasn't oh god Peter no no no no no he
[35:00] didn't say the right thing you know some
[35:02] people wrong not a walk with eggshells
[35:04] tip to one thing like that we had a
[35:06] commenter latinum together come up yeah
[35:09] I was gonna together ticket on that we
[35:10] have to be able to handle what we have
[35:13] no because you see worse is coming what
[35:18] rep look look look Toodee
[35:22] I wanted to focus about deterrence but
[35:24] today they said they have a new virus
[35:27] from China in China that is is like the
[35:31] 2009 swine flu virus and 191 whatever
[35:35] whatever one plus it have the
[35:38] characteristics of the 1918 flu very so
[35:43] you see that demon that bad spirit that
[35:46] what what back dear they write in you
[35:48] know and his wave after wave after we've
[35:51] who prophesied up but the ban on him
[35:53] said it he said we are strengthened the
[35:56] end into the kingdom of God before these
[35:59] he called him horrible big strike let's
[36:03] try the night let's take it serious
[36:05] tonight let's not take it as we go into
[36:07] church and his church people and people
[36:09] on fire by envy and whatnot no you have
[36:13] to breathe true you must be true amen
[36:17] let's continue
[36:18] praise the Lord he said so let your love
[36:22] be sincere do you love your brother
[36:24] Peter cinn Jesus in love as though is
[36:27] really lovely
[36:29] really love me love me bro oh you
[36:32] shouldn't yell at me bro
[36:33] you love your sister oh you're gonna
[36:37] fight this system he said be kind of
[36:41] fractionate to one another with
[36:44] brotherly love in honour preferring one
[36:46] another
[36:47] amplified love one another with
[36:48] brotherly affection yet us as members of
[36:52] one family given precedence I'm showing
[36:57] honor to one another and I believe that
[37:00] Gordon loves when we can honor one
[37:02] another when we could switch other with
[37:04] respects when husbands could show their
[37:07] wives respect son why should it husband
[37:09] respect some children show that parents
[37:10] respects him they aren't sure it Shirin
[37:12] respects I believe God loves that he
[37:15] loves them because you see as we treat
[37:17] each other as showing which we chant
[37:19] God's own people and once you get a
[37:21] revelation that their sons and daughters
[37:23] are wrong him you want to treat them
[37:25] with respects you want to treat them
[37:27] adverts you want to treat them with
[37:28] dignity
[37:29] it says ya verse 11 being slothful not
[37:32] stressful in business but fervent in
[37:35] spirit serving the Lord and it says here
[37:38] and not if I never lag in zeal and until
[37:41] miss endeavor here glue and brilliant
[37:45] with the spirit silver nail or prison or
[37:48] even that is something you always know
[37:51] end but a gist Lazaro
[37:54] evil hallelujah where is Jason he's on
[37:59] fire he have a seal
[38:00] he always comes with it is something
[38:03] inside of him and that is what we all
[38:05] must have a zeal for God I see you for
[38:08] the things of God
[38:09] Gorka said this is my man down here this
[38:11] is my woman on here a passion for God
[38:14] out of Scripture I wanted to connect
[38:17] with when I read it first and they's
[38:19] from first Geeta chapter 4:1 talking
[38:23] about changing their mind look at the
[38:24] scripture from 1st Peter chapter 4 verse
[38:26] 1 for as much then as Christ had
[38:30] suffered for us in the flesh
[38:32] um you serve likewise with the same mind
[38:38] for he that had suffered in the flesh
[38:41] had ceased from sin you know what a man
[38:46] says some family fifty years to get a
[38:49] man in sheep awaiting of order
[38:53] sometime I take 50 years forgot to use a
[38:55] man for six months I can debug this 30
[38:59] years to get the man in shape sometimes
[39:03] we take a long time to get older be
[39:06] childish be easier to get out of the
[39:09] common behavior like putting off time
[39:13] preach and I left I love to see it he
[39:15] didn't make you had any animals he made
[39:18] you a little lower than the Angels so
[39:21] you cannot subject yourself to the lower
[39:23] lust levelin you have to be striving to
[39:26] be caught up into a heavenly atmosphere
[39:29] where you could be used by God well you
[39:32] could be a challenge of God make what
[39:35] could communicate to others through you
[39:37] it's not flesh and blood God using no in
[39:40] that sense
[39:40] goal want to use his wood in flesh and
[39:42] blood he wants his word to become fresh
[39:45] and he could use you I believe it was a
[39:49] Sunday or some day was talking and and
[39:51] sharing about him about brother branham
[39:55] I'm gonna Branum talking about and his
[39:59] after he seals
[39:59] oh he you know he feeling this way and
[40:03] abdominal and everything else and that
[40:06] is being sincere he wasn't playing angel
[40:09] he wasn't playing and he somewhere up
[40:11] there was a human being he have a
[40:13] disappointment as a human being
[40:15] traveling with the church he striving to
[40:17] get things in order
[40:18] but things doesn't work out as he
[40:20] expects people behavior is not as he
[40:23] expect and as a human being is a great
[40:26] disappointment and he came to us but one
[40:28] time where he lost the burden for the
[40:30] people that's a terrible place to be in
[40:32] because you do you don't have to drive
[40:34] anymore help to really give the kind of
[40:37] support you need to really do what we
[40:39] have to do it has to be a burden the
[40:42] burden makes a difference and the people
[40:44] who pray is who gets burdens and when
[40:47] they get a burden it rises the prayer
[40:49] like a recurring cycle so all the light
[40:52] Christians
[40:54] all the ones who have problems I like
[40:59] how you look at me I and I call this one
[41:01] chick man I find this enough train them
[41:02] and all their emotions they haven't gone
[41:05] deep enough into a burden go when you
[41:08] look again your world is too small
[41:12] God is not in that small thinking that
[41:16] we have many a times
[41:17] it's that's why we need to get in minor
[41:19] Christ a bit of the wood and sometime I
[41:22] pray that pray Lord burden the burden of
[41:25] the world you get a word good
[41:27] interpreting a burden of God so when you
[41:30] come to the church you not see yourself
[41:32] as you quit the church it'll know you're
[41:36] going there to worship you're going
[41:38] there to cause a revival you go in there
[41:41] to create an atmosphere you have a
[41:43] purpose of going yeah when you pray in
[41:46] you not pray because you get a prayer
[41:48] you know it is it a pretty no you want
[41:51] to commune with God you know I find
[41:53] myself
[41:54] you have to pray the mysteriously I have
[41:59] a feeling so if I don't pray I can just
[42:01] not gonna you're not gonna work it
[42:03] lowers I have to pray to gain an
[42:07] expectation of what I'm praying for
[42:09] so whether when I was like a spree
[42:11] Chernobyl Anthony's preaching or whoever
[42:13] is preaching or do you have to do I have
[42:15] to pray I pray about this what we doing
[42:18] at night a good with help a go to it
[42:20] strengthen the good word when honor your
[42:22] faith and coming out started to hear
[42:25] what is being spoken but your lies will
[42:27] be changed that will be like a word
[42:29] applied
[42:30] amen praise the Lord so here we go
[42:36] rejoice in the hope fish
[42:39] tribulation continuing instant in prayer
[42:42] let us finish we didn't finish read this
[42:44] year for as much as Christ had suffered
[42:47] for us in the flesh arm yourself
[42:49] likewise for the same mine but he that
[42:51] had suffered in the flesh had ceased
[42:52] from sin that he no longer should live
[42:55] the rest of his time in the flesh to the
[42:58] lust of men but to the will of God for
[43:02] in the time pass of our life the
[43:05] surfaces to have wrought the will of the
[43:07] Gentiles when we walked in Las
[43:10] deficiencies lost excess of wine revel
[43:14] ins banquet ins abominable idolatries
[43:17] and he speaks about all these things
[43:19] that that is not the way we have to walk
[43:21] so in other words we also be so far from
[43:24] that kind of behavior that we find
[43:26] ourselves that good self ready to die
[43:29] ready to be killed we believe that
[43:32] tonight praise the Lord
[43:33] so let's continue rejoicing in Hope
[43:36] patient in tribulation continuing
[43:39] instant in prayer distributing to the
[43:43] necessity of the Saints given the
[43:45] hospitality bless them that persecute
[43:48] you bless and curse not rejoice with
[43:52] them that do rejoice and weep with them
[43:55] that we only amplified and I pull this
[43:58] out rejoice with those who rejoice
[44:02] sharing others joy and weep with those
[44:06] who weep
[44:06] Sharyl others grief question can you
[44:11] rejoice with somebody else blessing
[44:16] could God bless her sister so much and
[44:18] you could rejoice with her and you had
[44:20] sincerely rejoicing with her
[44:22] could God bless her brother and you
[44:25] could rejoice with him I'm so happy for
[44:28] you
[44:28] god bless you I'm grateful to God I see
[44:33] the quad eyes are on you could you do
[44:36] that or did he get a fight that somebody
[44:40] is blessed and you are not blessed like
[44:43] them and you begin to get envious and
[44:45] jealous and you get a back in your mind
[44:47] so instead of rejoicing with him he said
[44:49] but everything could you weep in
[44:52] somebody weep and feel for him put on
[44:54] their shoes somebody's in pain and you
[44:58] want to feel for you when a battle felt
[45:01] for the people he prayed for in India he
[45:03] took off his shoes because the man was
[45:05] blind and he had no shoes but I must be
[45:08] paired to give him his shoes done
[45:10] barefoot on the platform because he
[45:12] finally was so on fear not only is a man
[45:15] blind but a man had no shoes could you
[45:18] could you share your shoes could you
[45:22] share your coat could you share your
[45:24] dollars as a big one and those people
[45:27] who do want to ask people how you're
[45:29] going I didn't remember that years ago
[45:31] they refuse to answer your word because
[45:33] you be frightened you say you ain't
[45:35] going good on your Scranton and even
[45:37] what he says Scranton they know that
[45:38] they were been a spot because they have
[45:41] a new dawn so they're not even asking
[45:43] how you're going did you what let's
[45:45] praise our prophet prays alone because
[45:48] if you want to put down in the pocket
[45:49] and give you some change like Oh Peter
[45:52] wants to do it if he's had money would
[45:54] have given the guy money
[45:55] it's just that God set it up that Peter
[45:58] forget his wallet that day only see in
[46:02] that and he said silver and gold a
[46:04] diamond and you have anything right now
[46:05] but what I have I sent me I'm happy to
[46:07] give you friends we have to go a little
[46:11] further Jesus talked about if somebody
[46:13] competitive or one man want him to you
[46:16] somebody access a a coat
[46:17] give me a cloak also it is similar I'm
[46:20] an imam if Christ is coming back among
[46:24] us we have to see something that wonders
[46:28] and that similarly monkeys are live
[46:29] voice to love your enemies to do good to
[46:32] them that Christian whatever it is that
[46:36] blessing people cussing your God bless
[46:39] you praise the Lord or bless you
[46:43] you see your your blessing going on them
[46:45] and them kissing you and if meeting and
[46:47] your blessing falling back on you and
[46:48] your crews falling back on you because
[46:50] you are in God's blessing parameters
[46:54] forgiving your house right give me a
[46:55] preacher give me anybody would put God
[46:58] first
[46:58] I'll show you somebody that we bless
[47:00] despite all way devil put in front who
[47:03] would have thought to be won't be like
[47:04] this in Trinidad when we no creeper no
[47:07] that is whole lot daunting who looking
[47:09] for that but you see the develop would
[47:12] to never want to bring confusion never
[47:15] want to bring gloom and take them dying
[47:17] and the myths of all of that we not
[47:19] watching it closed and beat women

[47:23] pandemic dieting we have an inspiration
[47:26] time of life I miss all this debt I miss

[47:33] light is going to come because God can't
[47:37] lie and if he see there's gonna be a
[47:39] super church a super race I delete some

[48:03] your shortcoming it has to do with the
[48:06] foreknowledge of God you are called

[48:16] a dreadful time but they're gonna be a
[48:18] powerful display for this brain this is
[48:21] the difference last worry this is a
[48:24] devil and this is the pride have a right
[48:27] to come in the holy spirit in the
[48:29] profession and right history once more I

[48:36] miracles of signs and wonders there's
[48:39] enough cases even right among us in the
[48:42] church or got to deal with but the poor

[49:29] big and see the big you're a 18 as if
[49:32] eating is a passport okay because they
[49:35] can handle them they can tweet and it
[49:37] sometimes you wonder they had them from
[49:40] small why they are like how they are
[49:42] because it parents themselves just
[49:45] didn't know they just get all have
[49:49] children and never had the guidance the
[49:52] knowledge the wisdom to bring guidance
[49:54] to the children I get all of that is any
[49:56] bad idea but Gorby please let's verse 16
[50:00] says be of the same mind one day was
[50:03] another mind not high things but
[50:06] condescend to men of low estate be not
[50:10] wise in your own conceits recompense no
[50:13] man evil for evil for writings honest in
[50:16] the sight of all men and if it is
[50:19] possible as much as lieth in you live
[50:22] peaceably with all men
[50:23] he said dearly beloved avenge not
[50:26] yourselves but rather give place under

[50:32] will repay saith the Lord
[50:34] dear for what about is it vengeance is
[50:39] mine saith the Lord I will repeat
[50:43] remember I preached a message call for
[50:46] groups which one that must be talking
[50:48] about there will be those that will be
[50:50] given eternal life because of how they
[50:54] treat the bride how they treat God's
[50:59] elect based on that and that alone they
[51:02] going to be given eternal life at the
[51:05] right to enjoy now listen
[51:07] but abandon talk about this and when
[51:10] Jesus said I was hungry didn't feed me I
[51:13] was naked it include me but say Lord
[51:16] when when when women as you have done it
[51:18] to be least a little ones have done unto
[51:20] me that's why I'm seen
[51:22] always treat people right listen what is
[51:27] capa here salem therefore if thine enemy
[51:30] hunger feed him if he thirst give him
[51:35] drink for in so doing thou shalt heap
[51:38] coals of fire on his head
[51:40] be not overcome of evil but overcome
[51:43] evil with good and this is the last
[51:47] script that I have to share with you
[51:49] tonight and this scripture is from
[51:51] Philly
[51:52] chapter two I wanted to find this one
[51:55] Philippians chapter 2
[52:00] it says if there be any deer for any
[52:02] conservation was one in Christ if any
[52:05] comfort of love if any fellowship of the
[52:08] Spirit if any powers and mercies
[52:11] fulfilling my joy that you be
[52:14] like-minded having the same love being
[52:16] of one Accord of one may let nothing be
[52:21] done through strife or vainglory but in
[52:23] lowliness of mind let each esteem the
[52:28] other better than themselves looked at
[52:32] every man on his own things but every
[52:34] man also on the things of others let
[52:37] this mind be in you which was also in
[52:39] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[52:42] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[52:44] with God made himself of no reputation
[52:47] took upon him the form of a servant was
[52:51] made in the likeness of men and being
[52:52] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[52:55] himself and became obedient unto death
[53:00] even the death of the cross
[53:03] listen friends you cannot die if you'll
[53:07] not be better humble yourself if you're
[53:10] not prepared to say I'm wrong I'm sorry
[53:13] I made a mistake shouldn't have done

[53:45] you tonight this little exhortation

[56:12] bride here in Trinidad that is under the
[56:15] Covenant of the tool of your blood the
[56:18] talk must be displayed we have been
[56:20] applying the blood all these years or we
[56:23] know some point that blood must take
[56:25] life take a whole and bring life that
[56:28] would be this plead father made happen
[56:30] tonight in GSM I ask it a man an amen so
[56:35] this time I wanna invite but Isaac to
[56:37] give us a clue sin would know he didn't
[56:40] expect this but we didn't ask him you
[56:41] have been doing quite well I've
[56:43] certainly be enjoying the the study that
[56:45] he has given I hope that you don't
[56:47] compare it with what he has been doing
[56:48] there's no comparison he's in his
[56:51] element when he's doing this thing but I
[56:53] consider it a privilege to have done
[56:55] this tonight I was looking forward for
[56:57] it and I'm paralyzed ik-hee
[57:01] man who's in charge of Bible study
[57:03] realiza
[57:06] I'm sorry I didn't know but mo laughter
[57:19] even Google s you this is totally
[57:22] unexpected but God bless you Church and
[57:25] really appreciated teaching tonight and
[57:28] it's really a powerful scripture that
[57:31] was read and I pray that there's been a
[57:33] blessing to each and every one of you
[57:36] and there's so much to meditate on these
[57:42] scriptures I was sharing them but over
[57:43] it some time ago
[57:44] that you cannot exhaust Scripture
[57:47] you cannot exhaust the wood and more and
[57:51] more I find myself I'm challenging
[57:56] myself and I want to challenge you as
[57:59] well that you know in the business world
[58:03] they say that you are the average of the
[58:06] five people you spend your time with you
[58:10] know so if you spend your time with
[58:11] people who know more than you do what
[58:16] will happen is that after a while you
[58:17] start to learn things from them you know
[58:20] but if you spend time with people who
[58:21] just talking nonsense and and trust me
[58:25] there's a lot of nonsense sake because
[58:27] when I'm talking then eventually you
[58:29] actually slow down yourself you know and
[58:31] it applies to every area if you if you
[58:33] want your to be physically strong they
[58:37] see you don't do any kind of physical
[58:38] exercise to somebody who lives in
[58:40] hospital for a long time this is very
[58:42] difficult to get off your bed because
[58:44] there's a good thing entropy I think as
[58:46] you would where your muscles start to
[58:48] lose its ability to perform and and and
[58:52] you know physical exercise even mental
[58:55] exercise because the brain is a more is
[58:56] a muscle and it the same principle
[58:59] applies spiritually you know and we sang
[59:02] this song in Sunday school read your
[59:04] Bible and pre every day and you'll grow
[59:07] grew grew and thing about life I don't
[59:12] know what your experience is it is that
[59:17] doesn't come natural it does not come
[59:20] natural there's no automatic switch that
[59:24] you put on the radio Bible and pray
[59:27] every single V no I think recently I saw
[59:31] an article of a
[59:33] student who went to school you know this
[59:35] wasn't passing on and they say when they
[59:37] look at her academic record she never
[59:39] missed a day in school and I have heard
[59:42] people who talk about that I have a
[59:44] business associate who said in his 30
[59:48] something plus years as a leader in his
[59:50] organization
[59:51] he said he probably has taken one day
[59:53] sick in his whole to me something years
[59:55] in a row you know and he was making a
[59:57] reference you were saying that you know
[1:00:00] when people not really sick and they say
[1:00:02] this is sick so I coming in today
[1:00:03] because a sick you say you bring
[1:00:05] sickness on yourself
[1:00:06] because what you testify and what you
[1:00:08] speak is what you walk into so you say I
[1:00:10] rather you tell me you had it in you
[1:00:11] why are you telling me you're just
[1:00:13] frustrated already tell me yeah I want
[1:00:15] to see my face to be then ever lie and
[1:00:17] see you sick when you're not sick so
[1:00:18] these are principles but but what I was
[1:00:21] looking at is the discipline of the
[1:00:23] consistency of something you know and
[1:00:26] what I'm what I'm trying to see from my
[1:00:31] own life and by extension those that I
[1:00:32] have some level of influence on is the
[1:00:35] discipline of making you would a part of
[1:00:39] your life I have preached it before I
[1:00:42] find it very difficult for somebody to
[1:00:44] move from reading in Scripture from
[1:00:47] praying into an argument it's a really
[1:00:50] it's a really that he was in you would
[1:00:53] after you hear I beseech you therefore
[1:00:56] brethren you have Paul pleading
[1:00:58] reseachers beyond ask usage means he
[1:01:01] that is coming deep within I beseech you
[1:01:04] by the mercies of God so it's
[1:01:06] conditional - it's basically mercy of
[1:01:09] God that you present your by the living
[1:01:11] sacrifice he said holy that word holy is
[1:01:15] big that word holy itself is big that we
[1:01:18] could ever consider to present ourselves
[1:01:20] holy ask me you holy holy holy is what
[1:01:26] Isaiah met when the angel was there
[1:01:28] around each road said holy holy holy are
[1:01:30] you Lord and here Paul is challenging
[1:01:33] you and me to present ourselves holy
[1:01:36] that in our presence in just could look
[1:01:40] at us and see his own image to us that's
[1:01:43] that massive wholly unacceptable you
[1:01:46] when when when you had to bring a
[1:01:48] sacrifice and the priests connie priest
[1:01:51] couldn't just take any sacrifice you
[1:01:53] know when you have to bring a sacrifice
[1:01:54] and you have to represent your house and
[1:01:58] after one search you very carefully
[1:02:00] search a lamb because it was specific a
[1:02:03] lamb without blemish so it was a
[1:02:05] criteria because of there was an
[1:02:09] acceptable elementary sacrifice so you
[1:02:12] can basically come to present a
[1:02:14] sacrifice and appreciate again what is
[1:02:16] this mark here this tower cannot go I'm
[1:02:19] Graham bring something else this
[1:02:21] sacrifice is not acceptable and in the
[1:02:25] same way this scripture is speaking
[1:02:27] about the acceptability and it's not
[1:02:29] man's acceptability it is acceptable
[1:02:31] unto God so God is saying I accept this
[1:02:34] so and then the clincher of this all and
[1:02:38] I will announce upon these verses is if
[1:02:40] your reasonable service well what's not
[1:02:42] you see that but that could finish
[1:02:43] anybody tonight because reasonable
[1:02:46] service
[1:02:46] if God's saying to us through the
[1:02:48] Apostle Paul that he not giving us
[1:02:50] something that is so unattainable and we
[1:02:53] cannot achieve not he's not saying this
[1:02:55] is that charlatan I want you to brace
[1:02:57] yourself any challenge he is saying this
[1:02:59] is reasonable reasonable so reasonable
[1:03:03] is scary because reasonable means it's
[1:03:05] within your ability without even too
[1:03:08] much effort reasonable is challenging us
[1:03:11] that this level of sanctification
[1:03:14] albertov is so beautiful we put it on
[1:03:16] accurately put them that sanctification
[1:03:18] is reasonable
[1:03:20] that takes away excuses you know because
[1:03:24] what hurts the Christian walk is is our
[1:03:27] natural tendency to have excuses for why
[1:03:31] we did what we did or why we didn't do
[1:03:33] what we do but here Paul is saying it's
[1:03:36] reasonable that we could present our
[1:03:38] bodies a living sacrifice reasonable
[1:03:41] that got to look at our daily work and
[1:03:44] see you sacrifice and accept that listen
[1:03:47] this is a son this is a daughter of God
[1:03:49] and I think that is really really
[1:03:50] powerful and this way of life as well a
[1:03:53] little bit said about dying daily it's
[1:03:56] about discipline I've been hitting this
[1:03:58] wood discipline for weeks and I'm seeing
[1:04:01] him more and more because even today as
[1:04:04] I saw some videos and I'm a very
[1:04:06] distinguished colleague of mine call me
[1:04:09] today he say Isaac I fed up delete miss
[1:04:11] video on the phone and he said this
[1:04:14] thing is this thing is saying something
[1:04:17] else alone I said listen I ready for 20
[1:04:19] 21 because this 2020 this year hey I
[1:04:23] know where this is the amount of stuff
[1:04:26] has happened in this year 2020 that
[1:04:27] happen in years that is almost like what
[1:04:30] Nick's
[1:04:30] what could possibly happen next when you
[1:04:32] think is is China problem you become a
[1:04:35] world problem when anything is an
[1:04:36] America problem it becomes a local
[1:04:38] problem and but the issue is not about
[1:04:40] China America Chile I know the issue is
[1:04:42] a sin problem and the reality is sin
[1:04:45] when it matures if you could see that
[1:04:48] would matures will only manifest certain
[1:04:50] things it'll manifest behaviors that
[1:04:53] appeal to or attracted to or connected
[1:04:56] to the business nature of man this is
[1:04:59] the achievement which is violence and
[1:05:01] naki chaos Babylon Sodom Gomorrah when
[1:05:06] you strip away what we call morality is
[1:05:09] really not the issue of morality when
[1:05:11] you strip away the compass that points
[1:05:13] to God you will get everything else so
[1:05:16] it becomes that nothing is a surprise
[1:05:18] anymore for the simple reason that once
[1:05:22] you are not pointing to God anything to
[1:05:25] be expected you know so I want to
[1:05:27] encourage us especially in these times
[1:05:30] because we will see more things that we
[1:05:32] have not seen before
[1:05:33] not
[1:05:34] that it hasn't existed before because a
[1:05:36] Babel does it there's nothing new Under
[1:05:37] the Sun these are manifestations of what
[1:05:40] has happened before time and time again
[1:05:42] it is reflections of the same spirits
[1:05:44] that have came upon people before to
[1:05:47] create anak II and this order and sin
[1:05:49] and and the reality is his sad reality
[1:05:51] is people will not change by the brutal
[1:05:55] reality of it I've said it before there
[1:05:57] is no solution to the crime problem
[1:05:59] there's no Commissioner there's no army
[1:06:02] because spirits don't die
[1:06:04] but even when somebody dies or the
[1:06:08] spirit now looking for a new vessel to
[1:06:11] be touched or this really seem as she
[1:06:13] was and it's clear because even when
[1:06:15] Jesus had to encounter leave him in
[1:06:17] spirit of my legion in casting the
[1:06:19] demons of the Legion he had to send
[1:06:21] those demons somewhere just understand
[1:06:23] the context of it and those demons end
[1:06:26] up going it to be pings and that is why
[1:06:28] I wanted to run Jesus out because he
[1:06:31] messed up my whole big business at that
[1:06:33] time in that context in that description
[1:06:35] but the point I want to kneel down is
[1:06:38] this the spirits the spirits no matter
[1:06:40] how you see it and you have to see the
[1:06:42] spiritual around but nobody says
[1:06:43] something really really powerful tonight
[1:06:45] about closing the doors and I want to
[1:06:48] build on that not just the doors close
[1:06:51] the windows close the doors close the
[1:06:56] windows lock your house you see in this
[1:06:58] today I see courts on Sookie put apply
[1:07:02] an ting unblock a meeting because they
[1:07:04] are taking no chances you see we have
[1:07:05] glass we have furniture we have TV we
[1:07:08] have think if them people were to do a
[1:07:09] little America block of me please that
[1:07:12] was their natural automatic instinctive
[1:07:16] response to protect their whatever they
[1:07:19] had behind it it's the same way that
[1:07:22] when we see what's happening we supposed
[1:07:23] to be locking the doors and I'm not just
[1:07:25] just on the physical doors but he draws
[1:07:27] up our lives make it impossible to see
[1:07:31] it done to get room in your life but
[1:07:33] over it said something powerful about
[1:07:34] about what sit and have on us that I
[1:07:38] serious thing that is really serious
[1:07:40] thing because when somebody have
[1:07:42] something on you you feel a certain way
[1:07:45] do anything
[1:07:47] they call you Fela if somebody have
[1:07:50] somebody when they call you respond a
[1:07:52] certain way here yeah because you don't
[1:07:53] want sir there's so much game and I'm
[1:07:56] sure you've been in a situation where
[1:07:57] you feel oh gosh way so and so you know
[1:07:59] what I know I had something feel I know
[1:08:01] I'm if I answer no you're getting a doc
[1:08:02] in him or it all kind of different
[1:08:04] situations and and anything is if you
[1:08:08] don't give the devil stuff on you he
[1:08:10] can't get stuff on you
[1:08:12] can I say that one more time he
[1:08:14] democratise create stuff you know you
[1:08:16] know and I'll try to close to this I was
[1:08:19] studying Juba and I say I want to do a
[1:08:21] study of jube that might be maybe make
[1:08:24] some because there's a counter-argument
[1:08:26] to jube then I found that a lot of
[1:08:29] people don't touch on but it is on more
[1:08:32] than one occasion God asking Satan have
[1:08:36] you considered my sylvans Juba and the
[1:08:41] reality was this that when you
[1:08:44] understand the principle of the
[1:08:45] conversation it really means Satan don't
[1:08:49] have any permission to touch your life
[1:08:51] your family your business your money
[1:08:55] your health unless God gives him
[1:08:59] permission to come at you for a test
[1:09:02] now that is profound so it means II
[1:09:05] think I just pick you and and you become
[1:09:07] a victim and no no for him to even come
[1:09:11] close to you
[1:09:12] God have to say all right go ahead take
[1:09:15] a crack and as we a lot of people miss
[1:09:18] it because it means that because you you
[1:09:20] are not protection we are all under a
[1:09:24] protection and that protection stands
[1:09:26] see them as the common so so even when
[1:09:28] you look at it conversation when God
[1:09:31] acts is there will have you considered
[1:09:32] my servant you see them is like how you
[1:09:34] accident that question when you have a
[1:09:36] protection along and you know you're
[1:09:38] protecting him
[1:09:38] it's your almost a similar question that
[1:09:40] some Tim Barris me because you know a
[1:09:42] car touch him you know occur I'm coming
[1:09:43] the host a common street I come even you
[1:09:46] have been protected and Gordon City well
[1:09:48] here's was I will take off the edge from
[1:09:51] around his life go do what you want yes
[1:09:54] don't touch his life and that is what
[1:09:55] allow the devil to even come onto the
[1:09:58] street and so the impact jobs
[1:10:00] life but chew it all and we could get it
[1:10:03] at some point job was able to which
[1:10:05] stanley test but true it as well
[1:10:08] jubilant lessons he did not learn until
[1:10:12] the head was removed many times we talk
[1:10:16] about job god always trouble and he's
[1:10:18] kind of thing but there were lessons
[1:10:19] that job could not have learned had God
[1:10:23] not allowed he had to be removed and a
[1:10:25] lot of emphasis is not pleased because
[1:10:27] job had a somewhat causal relationship
[1:10:30] with God if you really to repot the job
[1:10:32] the Bible said that when it's sharing
[1:10:34] with that eat he would offer a sacrifice
[1:10:36] just in case they did something wrong
[1:10:39] almost as if he was trying to buy their
[1:10:41] salvation and that's an awkward operates
[1:10:43] so going to break away his little
[1:10:45] traditions that he had that he told was
[1:10:47] protecting his family so every time they
[1:10:49] have a feast he do all sacrifice just to
[1:10:51] cover them just in case you don't have
[1:10:52] to do anything about it but yet and all
[1:10:55] of us are these little things we just do
[1:10:57] they celebrate our thing you know a well
[1:11:00] spoken book in my back pocket if I had
[1:11:02] idea covered and I think we do it
[1:11:04] because this is this is your own way of
[1:11:06] feeling a certain level of comfort but
[1:11:08] underneath that there is no substitute
[1:11:10] for that deep relationship with God and
[1:11:13] I believe Roman twelve Lee is such a
[1:11:15] powerful foundation of how circumspect
[1:11:19] we must be how careful we must be our
[1:11:21] protective we must be how disciplined we
[1:11:24] must be to not be conformed to this
[1:11:26] world to be transformed by the renewing
[1:11:29] of your mind there are principles in
[1:11:32] there that are so deep that I trust that
[1:11:35] you would go back into this and study
[1:11:36] and spend him on ticket I might be in
[1:11:40] conformed in as well it's my language
[1:11:43] conformity language of this world
[1:11:45] it's how I look at people the way God
[1:11:49] looks at them or is you work influenced
[1:11:52] and how I look at them when I submit my
[1:11:54] report on my job when I speak to my
[1:11:56] family all of us and I said any
[1:11:59] fortunate that is a country of actors
[1:12:00] and actresses in the Oscars and Grammy
[1:12:03] was here we win every time we win
[1:12:05] because we're able to shape-shift and
[1:12:07] change to our environment to the
[1:12:09] situation the challenge to everything to
[1:12:13] try to the
[1:12:14] and it's pattern almost nature survival
[1:12:18] mechanism it's eaten in me chameleons
[1:12:21] any lizards they tried to fit in any and
[1:12:22] hid in it but the Bible says don't be
[1:12:24] conformed to this world but be
[1:12:26] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:12:28] all that is romant well so in summary
[1:12:31] may God richly bless you
[1:12:32] I trust take this word to heart make
[1:12:35] this word your principle and I never
[1:12:39] thought quite honestly that you know
[1:12:43] you're no script Chinese CD would but
[1:12:46] this thing is so real to your daily life
[1:12:49] it is ready almost explosive in your
[1:12:52] mind and heart when you see that
[1:12:53] everything in life and putting the life
[1:12:56] and godliness is in this and if you said
[1:12:58] the see this as a real thing and lifted
[1:13:00] this you will see a business change your
[1:13:03] marriage Jean hear conversation change
[1:13:05] you're walking your feet your confidence
[1:13:08] you approach everything so we're aware
[1:13:10] Gauri she bless you Church God richly
[1:13:12] bless you
[1:13:12] Stanley fire in line and do not
[1:13:15] underestimate God do not limit God by
[1:13:18] your own thinking
[1:13:19] don't limit God by your experience don't
[1:13:22] limit God but what you heard other
[1:13:24] people said because as you see scripture
[1:13:27] unfold what is promised for us nobody in
[1:13:31] the past not even the prophet has
[1:13:32] experienced what we escena for us
[1:13:34] because it says bright time so the
[1:13:36] relationship that the groom will have
[1:13:39] with this bride will be different from
[1:13:41] that what he has had with any other 84
