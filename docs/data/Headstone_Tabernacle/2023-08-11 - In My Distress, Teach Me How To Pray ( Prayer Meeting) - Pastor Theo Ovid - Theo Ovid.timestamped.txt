[13:53] I mean you speak to them in Jesus I ask
[13:56] it amen amen God bless you and welcome
[14:01] and I have two portion of scriptures
[14:03] like the reading
[14:04] from Psalms 18 and from Luke chapter 11.
[14:08] I want to read from Psalms 18 1 to 6 I'm
[14:11] looking there when one at 13 Psalms 18
[14:14] and this is uh this is David the servant
[14:18] of the Lord will speak into unto the
[14:20] Lord the words of this song
[14:22] in the deed of the Lord delivered him
[14:24] from the hand of all his enemies and
[14:26] from the hand of Saul and he said
[14:29] it is David
[14:30] I will love thee O Lord my strengths
[14:34] the Lord
[14:36] is my rock
[14:38] and my Fortress this is Psalms 18. was
[14:42] true the Lord is my rock
[14:45] watch how David is personalizing it what
[14:48] shall David identifying himself right in
[14:51] all these precious promises and
[14:54] identification of who God is to him
[14:57] the Lord is my rock
[14:59] and my Fortress and my delivery my God
[15:06] my strength in whom I will trust my
[15:11] bakla and the Horn of my salvation and
[15:16] my high tower
[15:17] this tree
[15:19] I will call upon the Lord
[15:21] who is worthy to be praised
[15:24] no he is delivered from his enemies like
[15:26] yeah are we saying this I will call upon
[15:29] the Lord
[15:30] who is worthy to be praying so shall I
[15:33] deceived from my enemies
[15:35] the Sorrows of death Compass me
[15:38] and the floods of ungodly men made me
[15:41] afraid
[15:42] the Sorrows of Hell come past me about
[15:46] the snares of death prevented me in my
[15:49] distress
[15:50] I called upon the Lord
[15:53] and Cried unto my God he heard my voice
[15:58] out of his Temple
[16:00] and My Cry
[16:02] came before him
[16:04] even under his ears
[16:07] I like this this particular verse
[16:10] is not just talking to God or crying to
[16:12] God but he's singing you know what
[16:15] my words reach God's ears in other words
[16:19] he heard me or he heard My Cry
[16:23] Luke Chapter 11
[16:25] verse 1.
[16:27] Luke 11 from verse one and it came to
[16:29] pass that as he was praying
[16:32] in a certain place
[16:34] when he ceased
[16:36] so Jesus was a Praying Soul a Praying
[16:39] person
[16:40] when he ceased one of the disciples said
[16:43] unto him Lord
[16:44] teach us to pray
[16:46] as John also taught to disciples
[16:50] and he said unto them
[16:51] When you pray not if
[16:55] but when see Our Father which art of him
[17:00] Hallowed be thy name
[17:02] thy kingdom come
[17:04] thy will be done as in heaven so in
[17:06] Earth
[17:07] give us day by day or Daily Bread
[17:11] and forgive us our sins
[17:13] for we also forgive everyone that is
[17:16] indebted to us
[17:17] and lead us not into temptation but
[17:19] Deliver Us from Evil
[17:22] and he said unto them which of you
[17:24] shall have a friend
[17:26] and shall go unto him at midnight and
[17:28] say friend lend me three laws for a
[17:31] friend of mine in his journey has come
[17:33] to me and I have nothing to set before
[17:35] me
[17:36] and he from within shall understand said
[17:38] trouble me not the door is now shut my
[17:40] chair and I with me in bed I will I
[17:42] cannot rise and give thee I see unto you
[17:44] though you will not arise and give it
[17:47] because he's his friend yet because of
[17:50] his opportunity he will rise and give
[17:53] him as many as he needed
[17:55] and I see unto you ask shall be giving
[17:57] you seek and you shall find knock shall
[18:00] be open unto you for everyone that
[18:02] asketh receive it either she could find
[18:05] it unto him that knock it it shall be
[18:08] open
[18:09] this is for someone that come down to
[18:12] if a son shall ask bread of any of you
[18:14] that is a father
[18:16] will you give him a stone
[18:18] if he asks a fish
[18:20] will he if our fish give him a serpent
[18:22] or if he shall ask an egg will he offer
[18:25] them a Scorpio
[18:27] if he then
[18:29] being evil know how to give good gifts
[18:33] unto your children or much more shall
[18:36] the heavenly father give the Holy Spirit
[18:38] and then that ask him give
[18:41] the Holy Spirit to them that ask him
[18:46] and tonight I have a little title I want
[18:48] to give this in my distress
[18:50] teach me how to pray
[18:52] and you'll hear this is the pet of the
[18:55] Prophet as he shared all we should pray
[18:58] and how we should talk to Gordon but the
[19:01] client shared with me and I said I'll
[19:03] share it in the primiton I'll do it
[19:05] today
[19:06] distress
[19:08] distressed is subject to Great strain or
[19:12] difficulties that may be your position
[19:13] tonight you're in distress
[19:15] to cause to worry or be troubled
[19:18] to afflict with great pain anxiety or
[19:21] Soul trouble worry bother
[19:25] distress
[19:27] great mental and physical suffering such
[19:31] as extreme anxiety sadness or pain or
[19:34] state of being in danger
[19:37] distress emotionally
[19:40] and financial distress
[19:44] some point in time we will be in
[19:47] distress
[19:48] where sometimes you don't even know what
[19:51] to turn
[19:52] you're on that stream
[19:54] but
[19:55] David
[19:58] amazing person he said in my distress I
[20:02] call upon the Lord and I cried onto my
[20:05] God and sometimes we feel safe we feel
[20:08] on our jobs on family home whatever
[20:10] environment we feel very comfortable
[20:13] and you expect things to work fine and
[20:16] good and smooth and then as the prophet
[20:19] could see sometimes that they come or
[20:21] dark days or I really can't come dismal
[20:25] time come and you find yourself under
[20:27] the weather
[20:28] in distress
[20:30] and you are challenged tonight
[20:32] to call on God to ask of him in your
[20:35] time of trouble
[20:37] and this is the prophet singing
[20:40] he said if the king of the prophets was
[20:42] here tonight the Lord Jesus in a
[20:45] physical form
[20:46] so you could look at him
[20:48] you are looking at us this woman here
[20:51] somebody will come why
[20:53] there'll be nothing could be done only
[20:55] he would have to tell them something
[20:58] as far as healing they could not heal
[21:00] them because he already done it his
[21:03] sacrifice was complete it was finished
[21:04] there but these gifts here we go
[21:08] these gifts
[21:09] are to bring you to what was finished at
[21:12] Calvary do you understand Say Amen
[21:16] okay something
[21:18] Gifts of preaching
[21:21] teaching
[21:23] all kind of a prophetic gifts
[21:25] are to bring you
[21:27] to the realization of what happened at
[21:31] Calvary
[21:32] that you just to enjoy and receive the
[21:36] attributes of country
[21:38] not produce the attributes but to bring
[21:41] you to the knowledge of what has been
[21:43] done
[21:44] the sacrifice has done been provided
[21:47] you just get to look that way and
[21:50] believe the Lord bless you
[21:52] so for the balance of this just act
[21:55] tonight
[21:56] as though
[21:58] the Lord Jesus was standing here
[22:01] somewhere in the room in
[22:05] I know you would be very reverent
[22:09] give your prayer as representing by
[22:12] Divine gift if the holy spirit will do
[22:14] it you say for the brand you're stolen
[22:16] so he's picking up people thinking he's
[22:19] just talking and stalling listen to what
[22:22] he said after this that's exactly right
[22:24] I am
[22:25] I am waiting
[22:28] till I feel his presence
[22:31] I know that the anointing is on me
[22:35] I have a way of yielding myself
[22:40] I stand on the street and do it
[22:42] I Stand Down by the lake side and do it
[22:45] when it is necessary
[22:47] and the Holy Spirit comes
[22:49] when I am talking to someone
[22:52] that's in distress
[22:54] and trouble
[22:56] and right there on the street or
[22:59] anywhere it meets it will tell them just
[23:02] exactly what they must do and so forth
[23:04] there's many people in here
[23:07] could raise their hands as to a witness
[23:09] of that knowing that's the truth
[23:12] how many knows that is true raise your
[23:14] hand see what I mean to the people who
[23:16] hasn't
[23:17] that only been in the meetings out there
[23:20] in the mountain side on the roadside
[23:21] meeting cars anywhere it is a yielding
[23:25] yourself to the holy spirit so brother
[23:28] grew
[23:29] to the point where he could make himself
[23:32] available to the Holy Spirit
[23:34] here we go now he is here
[23:37] the angel of the Lord it is here now
[23:41] the one you see on the picture is
[23:45] knowing the building
[23:46] be reverent don't move around please
[23:50] bring the patient
[23:52] that's what I have
[23:53] to give you here tonight in word form
[23:55] and I want to share with you now it's
[23:57] about 13 minutes or so a clip of the
[24:00] profit from the evening messenger and I
[24:03] want to empty and try to grasp every
[24:05] word because these things are given by
[24:08] the spirit and I don't feel this by
[24:10] chance we're going to hear that tonight
[24:13] so I want you to listen carefully and
[24:15] just get in the spirit and you'll see
[24:17] what the Lord will do praise the Lord so
[24:19] we want to go straight into this right
