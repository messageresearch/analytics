[14:00] it amen and amen God bless you and we
[14:02] want to welcome each and every one of
[14:04] you here tonight to this Friday H Bible
[14:07] study and we want to go straight into it
[14:10] tonight so tonight if have your Bibles
[14:13] uh I will start with the scripture
[14:15] Philippians chapter 3 verse 12 to 14
[14:20] Philippians chapter 3:2
[14:22] to4 and this is Paul speaking not as
[14:25] though I had already
[14:27] attained either already perfect but I
[14:31] follow after if I may apprehend that for
[14:35] which also I'm apprehended of Christ
[14:37] Jesus Brethren I count not myself to
[14:40] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[14:44] forgetting those things which are behind
[14:47] and reaching forth unto those things
[14:49] which are before I press towards the
[14:53] mark for the prize of the th calling
[14:56] Christ Jesus and the amplif this verse
[14:59] 13 says forgetting what lies
[15:04] behind and straining forward to what
[15:08] lies ahead I press on towards the goal
[15:12] to win may God bless his word now
[15:15] tonight I have a title building
[15:19] resilience a man in a robe of seven
[15:23] colors that's the title tonight building
[15:27] resilience and I
[15:30] backdrop what I'm going to which is the
[15:32] the text I'm going to get into is about
[15:34] Joseph I backdrop this here to try to
[15:38] share with you from a scriptural
[15:40] standpoint that this comfort zone we
[15:45] want to live in and stay in it's not
[15:48] really healthy for us
[15:51] and Paul was
[15:54] saying I have not captured and made it
[15:57] my own yet
[15:59] but one thing I do so this goal this
[16:03] aspiration that Paul had in his heart he
[16:07] saw himself as straining pressing
[16:10] fighting pushing and that is what we
[16:13] want to encourage you tonight to press
[16:16] to push to fight our Wednesday night
[16:18] message when brother Ram had this
[16:19] experience of going beyond the curtain
[16:22] at time the voice was saying keep
[16:24] pressing on so let's go tonight in life
[16:28] nothing happen happens by chance or by
[16:31] accident for a Christian believer this
[16:34] is the word and this is Romans 8:28 for
[16:38] we know that all things work together
[16:40] for good to them that love God to them
[16:44] who are be called according to his
[16:46] purpose so you can see by the scripture
[16:49] that Paul described it as straining for
[16:53] to what lies ahead it's an effort that
[16:56] we must make to keep pressing
[16:59] on this
[17:01] person doesn't come without effort you
[17:04] have to exert
[17:06] yourself exert means to use something
[17:10] such as Authority power influence in
[17:13] order to make something happen so there
[17:15] are people who could be
[17:17] bystanders uh Watchers they're just
[17:20] observing they're not
[17:22] participating but you don't want to be
[17:24] part of that you want to be part of the
[17:26] order to make something happen
[17:29] or cause a Revival or cause something to
[17:32] get started or get the wheels
[17:34] turning now
[17:36] dreams there we go are not given and
[17:40] plac in automatic
[17:42] mode it will not just work out think of
[17:46] a dream as a
[17:48] vision think of a dream as a
[17:50] architectural drawing of a house but the
[17:54] house still have to be built but even
[17:56] though you have the paper you have all
[17:58] the the schematics of the doors windows
[18:01] the building the roof everything else
[18:04] this vision of this house that you have
[18:07] on paper that has been approved still
[18:09] have to be built so now we will go into
[18:13] our text tonight for that connects with
[18:16] our title and this is found in Genesis
[18:19] chapter 37 we want to read from 1 to 11
[18:22] have bibl Genesis CH 37
[18:26] 1-1 this is where we would stay tonight
[18:31] verse one Genesis
[18:33] 37 and Jacob dwelt in a land whereing
[18:36] his father was a stranger in the land of
[18:39] Canan these are the generations of Jacob
[18:43] Joseph being 17 years old was feeding
[18:47] the flock with his Brethren and the
[18:50] lad was with the sons of Bila and with
[18:54] the sons of Zila his father's wives and
[18:57] Joseph brought unto his father their
[19:00] evil
[19:01] report now Israel loved Joseph more than
[19:04] all his
[19:06] children because he was the son of his
[19:08] old age and he made him a coat of many
[19:12] colors and when his Brethren
[19:15] saw that their father loved him more
[19:18] than all his Brethren they hated him and
[19:22] could not speak peaceably unto him and
[19:27] Joseph Dreamed a Dream
[19:29] and he told it his Brethren and they
[19:33] hated him yet the more and he said unto
[19:36] them here I pray you this dream which I
[19:39] have dreamed for behold we were binding
[19:42] sheep in the field and lo my sheath
[19:44] arose and also stood upright and behold
[19:47] your sheath stood round about and made
[19:50] obes to my
[19:52] sheath and his Brethren said unto him
[19:55] shall thou indeed re over us or shall
[19:58] thou indeed have dominion over us and
[20:00] they hated him yet more for his
[20:04] dreams and for his
[20:06] words and he dreamed yet another dream
[20:10] told it to his bed said behold I have
[20:12] dreamed a dream more and behold the Son
[20:14] and the moon and 11 stars made obedience
[20:18] to me and he told it to his father to
[20:21] his Brethren and his father rebuked him
[20:23] and said unto him what is this dream the
[20:26] th was dream shall I and thy mother and
[20:28] thy Breen indeed come to bow down
[20:30] ourselves today on the earth and his
[20:33] Brethren envied him but his father
[20:38] observ the same note Joseph did not give
[20:43] himself the
[20:44] dream note Joseph did not give himself
[20:47] the coat note Joseph didn't apply to be
[20:53] loved so when God loves you this is deep
[20:58] or favors
[21:00] you there's a cost and a price that goes
[21:05] with this favor of
[21:08] God and Joseph find himself at the tail
[21:12] end or the end of that stick of the
[21:16] price of a man that is loved by God
[21:21] loved of the father his Brethren hated
[21:25] him hated who a 17 year- old
[21:29] with a special anointing upon
[21:32] him and God symbolized that anointing by
[21:36] giving Joseph a coat or a robe of Many
[21:40] Colors we say today of seven colors this
[21:44] robe this robe is trouble once you're
[21:47] connected to this robe one this robe
[21:49] upon you is trouble you you get into
[21:52] trouble so you want to get down into the
[21:54] text tonight and see what the Lord will
[21:56] do okay here we go
[22:00] now remember dreams are not
[22:03] automatic so Joseph had this
[22:06] dream is it that he could sit down on a
[22:08] rocking chair is it that he could sit
[22:10] down on a hammock and just sing and say
[22:12] I have a dream my brothers bowing to me
[22:14] and make a special and so on
[22:16] no Matthew 11:12 says and from the days
[22:19] of John the Baptist until now the
[22:22] Kingdom of Heaven suffered
[22:24] violence the violent take it by force
[22:29] and in the Amplified it says the
[22:32] Heavenly kingdom is sought with most ENT
[22:37] Zeal and intense
[22:40] exertion and we have another scripture
[22:42] we know it familiar with it every man
[22:43] press into it this pressing into the
[22:46] kingdom of
[22:47] God how Joseph choose to
[22:50] survive and our title is here The Power
[22:53] of
[22:54] Choice it is easy to press when things
[22:58] are working
[22:59] out when but when life bow you a curve
[23:03] ball it challenges your
[23:06] faith it challenges your Anchor Point it
[23:10] challenges your trust in God but that is
[23:14] what the test is all about it's about
[23:17] decision your decision it's about Choice
[23:21] The Power of
[23:23] Choice now this is really important I
[23:26] wrot down these things here this is
[23:28] really important you can
[23:31] complain you can
[23:33] blame you can make
[23:35] excuses you could go into depression you
[23:39] could give up you can backslide all of
[23:42] the above are
[23:44] choices you have the ability to
[23:49] choose how you are going to respond to
[23:54] the situation that you find yourself in
[23:57] on Wednesday night we spoke
[23:59] about two nagging
[24:02] women
[24:04] Thea and potifa
[24:07] wife both of them nagging daily arising
[24:13] tormenting torturing with your
[24:16] mouth Samson caved him tell her his
[24:19] whole heart
[24:20] TOA and Samson lost his strength Joseph
[24:25] on the other hand he bolt like using
[24:27] bolt he bowled out of the house and he
[24:30] got into prison because he refused to
[24:33] give in to potifa Po's
[24:36] wife so every decision we make have an
[24:40] outcome your present
[24:42] situation are the results of decisions
[24:45] that you have
[24:47] made instead of accepting the outcome of
[24:50] all decisions many
[24:52] times people choose to blame and to make
[24:56] excuses
[24:59] Joseph had to take
[25:01] ownership of his situation to St to an
[25:05] expected
[25:06] end and I have here written instead of
[25:09] taking
[25:10] blame instead of blaming others why
[25:13] don't you take
[25:15] ownership
[25:17] Joseph did not allow the situation that
[25:20] he was in Define who he was and we can
[25:25] learn from that do not let your
[25:28] circumstances defined you whether you're
[25:31] in prison whether you're sick whether
[25:34] people see you
[25:36] off however your family see you doesn't
[25:39] matter don't ever let the circumstances
[25:43] or situation Define who you
[25:46] are what must we look to now God put you
[25:52] here for a
[25:53] purpose God had a reason an intention
[25:56] for you being here
[25:58] you have been
[26:00] called according to his purpose now this
[26:02] is what you have to believe I don't care
[26:04] what condition you're in tonight this
[26:05] year I'm giving here is the word you
[26:07] have been called according to his
[26:09] purpose your purpose is what should be
[26:13] driving you not your situation because
[26:15] when you look at the situation I'm
[26:17] frustrated I am f up I can't take it no
[26:19] more um is this doctor is this sickness
[26:22] is this issue is this family is this
[26:24] loved one and so and
[26:25] that John 10:10 says
[26:29] the thief cometh not but to steal to
[26:32] kill and to
[26:34] destroy I come that they might have
[26:38] life and this is a part that is the key
[26:40] for me and that they might have it more
[26:44] abundantly the Amplified is I came that
[26:47] they might have and enjoy life and have
[26:50] it in abundance to the full till it
[26:55] overflows so in other words God is
[26:57] interested in our
[26:59] success God is interested in our lives
[27:02] flowing in abundance and have a
[27:06] overflow so let's get back to Joseph now
[27:11] so
[27:12] obviously we can see that Joseph lived
[27:17] life with
[27:18] intention because he knew he was called
[27:22] to a higher
[27:23] purpose that higher purpose gave Joseph
[27:29] the the
[27:30] determination to live and
[27:33] survive that higher purpose is what
[27:36] fueled his actions he did not allow his
[27:40] present situation to affect the endgame
[27:43] of division so his
[27:45] action was purpose based not situation
[27:50] based and this is so very important
[27:53] because sometimes you know how the Bible
[27:55] talk about job's wife she spoke he say
[27:57] she SP like a foolish woman he knew she
[28:00] wasn't foolish but because of the
[28:03] situation she spoke because of his boils
[28:07] and the stress of him treating all these
[28:11] effects and so on like that these things
[28:13] on his body the woman almost caved in
[28:16] fully and you know she said the wrong
[28:19] thing and she say you speak like a
[28:20] foolish woman he know he didn't marry a
[28:23] foolish
[28:25] woman now
[28:28] as human
[28:29] beings we tend to stay
[28:32] in How I Could describe it in our
[28:35] default mode that mode of
[28:39] comfort that comfort
[28:41] zone
[28:43] and when we stay there we tend to
[28:46] believe that things will be easier for
[28:49] us because we're in a safe space we in a
[28:52] familiar space we in a secure space and
[28:56] we stay there and sometime I may
[28:59] describe it of people living in a bubble
[29:01] you can be in church but you actually
[29:05] not really connected to him just in your
[29:07] own little world your own little family
[29:10] your own little
[29:11] bubble and I could see Joseph J have his
[29:15] brothers he have his family has his
[29:17] father his mother the environment is
[29:20] right there
[29:22] support um from his brothers not so much
[29:24] a love but family is still dear
[29:29] now the thing about it is
[29:32] this the comfort zone that we
[29:36] cherish and we tend to enjoy and tend to
[29:40] remain as a divort strange enough that
[29:44] is the zone that keep us from
[29:46] growing that is the zone that keep us
[29:49] from
[29:50] learning that is the zone that keep us
[29:53] stunted I like to make the reference of
[29:55] a man building muscles
[29:58] if you are lifting weights that are
[30:00] light do not building muscles you just
[30:03] moving up your hand once you start to
[30:06] build muscles you have to increase the
[30:08] weight in other words the pressure the
[30:11] tension the weight that is what going to
[30:15] burn the fat and give you the muscles
[30:17] that you want to build well it's the
[30:19] same
[30:20] thing we have to break out of this
[30:22] comfort
[30:23] zone to really affect growth
[30:28] now I
[30:30] could get down into some scriptures
[30:32] that's in John 15 the Bible talk about
[30:34] fruit if you only bear fruit if you
[30:37] don't bear fruit he cut you off if you
[30:38] only start a bear he does what he pruned
[30:42] that tree in order to do what bear more
[30:45] fruit so it just goes to show the law of
[30:50] God is
[30:52] designed not for you to stay where you
[30:54] are or how you are but for you to be in
[30:58] a position to produce
[31:00] goods and produce to the max like how he
[31:04] said the seed some brought for 50 fold
[31:07] 80 fold 100 fold in other words not no
[31:11] dead seed but things that would bring
[31:13] forth life so he said if you bring forth
[31:15] fruit I'm going to prune you then you
[31:17] bring forth more fruit here is my father
[31:19] glorified that you bring forth much
[31:22] fruit so going right up the ladder you
[31:25] could see God is Progressive God God is
[31:28] in the fruit bearing business God is in
[31:30] the addition business God in the
[31:32] multiplication business God is not in
[31:34] the business of negative minus no fruit
[31:39] you know that sort of thing he's not in
[31:41] this Baron not into that are you with me
[31:43] tonight are you getting it tonight so I
[31:46] want you to see all of this because I
[31:48] want you to see how God forces the issue
[31:52] of Joseph completely out of his comfort
[31:54] zone and we want to look at the
[31:56] constraint that he had and we want to
[31:58] look at what we might complain about and
[32:00] how God could help us from Joseph's
[32:03] experience okay let's go so tonight I
[32:07] want to challenge you challenge all of
[32:09] us to come out of the boundaries of your
[32:12] comfort zone you don't talk to this one
[32:14] never reach out this one you don't call
[32:16] no one no effort you just believe in it
[32:20] going to work out God call you 30 years
[32:22] ago 40 years ago and you still L to that
[32:24] calling in the sense then that you're
[32:26] not seeing that God call want to purpose
[32:28] God call you to growth God call you to
[32:30] deal with the issues challenges of life
[32:33] and God setting up things to get you out
[32:37] of your comfort zone now Romans 8 says
[32:40] we know for we know that all things okay
[32:42] for good to them that love God to them
[32:44] who have be called ACC to his purpose
[32:47] and here we go for whom he did for know
[32:50] he also did predestinate what for to be
[32:54] conformed to the image of his son that
[32:57] he he might be the first born among many
[32:59] Brethren moreover whom he did
[33:01] predestinate them he also called whom he
[33:04] called them he also Justified whom he
[33:06] justified then he also glorified what
[33:09] shall we then say to these things if God
[33:11] before us who can be against us now note
[33:14] whom he predestinate he call so your
[33:15] calling knows and bring evidence to you
[33:18] that you are predestinated and watch
[33:20] this now whom he call you also Justified
[33:23] as if he never did it and who he
[33:26] justified he already glorified that is
[33:28] in the father's presence right now but
[33:31] there's nothing here speaks about
[33:34] sanctification but we know that there's
[33:37] sanctification sanctification is the
[33:39] part that we work out sanctification is
[33:41] the part that we do we separate
[33:44] ourselves we overcome we press the
[33:47] battle repr produce faith and Temperance
[33:49] and control that's our choice Temperance
[33:52] control is a choice so
[33:54] purpose coming into your purpose what
[33:57] God rais you for what God call you for
[34:00] that purpose is what gives
[34:03] Focus that purpose so if you don't know
[34:06] your purpose you can make a lot of
[34:08] circles going around and around and
[34:10] around but purpose is what gets focused
[34:13] and that's where you get Paul saying I
[34:15] press towards the mark what is Paul
[34:18] saying there I am focused I have a
[34:21] Target I have a goal now when things are
[34:25] not feable so so when you have that that
[34:28] goal that purpose when things are not
[34:30] fav favorable you press when you have
[34:33] battles you still press whatever you're
[34:36] going through you're going to press your
[34:37] way and I have here what was Joseph's
[34:41] constraints and you could look at your
[34:42] own life we can look at our lives to see
[34:45] what constraint that Joseph had to bear
[34:47] with this 17y old boy number one the
[34:52] jealousy of his
[34:54] brothers that was enough to give Joseph
[34:57] a complaint
[34:58] his brothers jealous him jealous him of
[35:00] the quot jealous him of his words
[35:04] they're not just jealous him they hated
[35:05] him
[35:07] two overcoming betrayal the trauma of
[35:12] being sold by his
[35:14] brothers who wanted to kill
[35:17] him that could have left such emotional
[35:21] scars Joseph later told his brothers and
[35:24] I read it you intended to harm me but go
[35:27] intended it for good and that show that
[35:32] Joseph was able to manage the
[35:36] pain manage the challenge of being
[35:40] betrayed and come out without
[35:43] bitterness did you hear that that's a
[35:46] hard
[35:47] one these are older
[35:50] brothers treating you a young person so
[35:54] terribly that they show you as if you
[35:57] like a
[35:58] a cattle or a horse or something they
[36:01] sold you and you have to process that
[36:05] and get it right and this is
[36:08] where you take back power when you see
[36:12] yourself as the one making the choice
[36:15] and making
[36:17] decision if you see yourself as a victim
[36:22] H you see you see you see you
[36:24] see say pray for me
[36:28] if you see yourself as a
[36:30] victim you're not in
[36:33] charge you are not effectively
[36:36] empowered
[36:38] because
[36:40] we
[36:42] cannot tell
[36:44] life what situation to bring job didn't
[36:48] ask for that
[36:49] experience the man who was born blind
[36:52] and and and or whatever and and
[36:54] Jesus said they say who sin Jesus said
[36:56] none that the works may be manifest so
[37:00] life situations it come like and the
[37:02] winds were contrary then the boat all of
[37:05] a sudden the winds are contrary nobody
[37:07] prayed Lord let the winds be contrary no
[37:10] contrary winds come contrary times come
[37:14] maybe it might be in-laws might be
[37:16] family might be wife husband children
[37:19] sickness job whatever it is and what do
[37:23] we do when those winds come how do we
[37:26] manage when the winds blow
[37:28] what choices do we make in our words and
[37:30] our actions sometime I go for you say
[37:33] when somebody do something against you
[37:34] don't even mention it to anybody just
[37:35] pray for them you know what kind of
[37:37] discipline that is in a place like TR
[37:40] Tobago that people they can't wait to
[37:42] hit that phone and that can't wait to
[37:44] that WhatApp and Facebook they can't
[37:46] wait to do that a man
[37:49] to be a per man you in this is here not
[37:53] at all that itching itching say this and
[37:58] say that and say that it take a lot of
[37:59] Grace to apply the word and say you know
[38:01] what I'm going to pray for my brother
[38:02] I'm going to hold my peace I'm going to
[38:04] press it down so
[38:07] Joseph had was to deal with this thing
[38:09] called betrayal it was a betrayal it's
[38:11] your own family selling you out your own
[38:14] Brethren selling you out not selling you
[38:16] out to somebody in the own country you
[38:18] know to another country out again let's
[38:21] continue praise the Lord ah is number
[38:24] two believe number three
[38:28] isolation being
[38:30] alone no family or friends i' I've heard
[38:33] it so much time um my daughter are no
[38:36] friends my son are no friends no friend
[38:38] in church and no friend this is
[38:40] Joseph no
[38:43] family no friends
[38:46] alone and yet he kept the Fate what are
[38:51] man what a man no wonder why he's a
[38:54] perfect type of Christ I have number
[38:56] four
[38:58] as living with a redefined
[39:02] identity a new
[39:05] name zafat zapat
[39:09] panah he's no longer in the safe space
[39:12] called
[39:13] home he had to adopt a different name
[39:16] all
[39:17] together five the
[39:20] language the
[39:22] culture the people it's all new he had
[39:27] to just he had to flex he had to
[39:31] learn to grow he had to
[39:35] adapt you don't grow in your comfort
[39:40] zone you grow in the stressed room I
[39:44] have it here like building body muscles
[39:46] you have to keep adding weights through
[39:49] pain you gain say it out there in your
[39:53] own mouth come your true pain I'm going
[39:56] to gain
[39:58] pain brings
[40:00] gain pain is not
[40:03] Antichrist pain is not anti- God stress
[40:06] is not Antichrist anti- God God allows
[40:10] stress that we don't be soft and doy you
[40:12] ever hear that before the prophet talk
[40:15] about people be getting soft and dty
[40:17] soft and dty Christians is people rting
[40:20] away in right in
[40:22] church we just see it they getting
[40:26] sofy the could press them and like when
[40:29] press them so the space Remain the body
[40:32] just
[40:34] thing when it press Bing back out
[40:38] because that's resilience you going to
[40:40] get it resilience is when you could
[40:43] recover from being bent from being spent
[40:47] from being strained you could bounce
[40:49] back that is the quality of
[40:53] resilience oh blessed be the name of G
[40:55] some Praises right where you are in your
[40:56] home I trust that this would help you in
[40:59] some way so watch
[41:03] this all these constraints that Joseph
[41:06] had
[41:08] isolation new identity no longer that
[41:11] safe spill called home a new language a
[41:15] new culture a new
[41:17] people he had to grow he had to adapt he
[41:20] had to adjust all these countries how do
[41:25] I say it here how do I maintain my faith
[41:28] and integrity and that was reflecting in
[41:32] how Joseph handled po white he stood
[41:35] there and says how do you want me to sin
[41:39] against God I have the authority in this
[41:41] house I have power to do everything over
[41:43] everything except you because you are
[41:45] his wife I respect your lady but she
[41:47] didn't respect
[41:49] herself that's why she press on trying
[41:52] to get Joseph but you see in the big
[41:55] scheme of things
[41:57] god listen to this like a bum wanted
[42:00] Joseph in
[42:02] prison because that is the only place he
[42:05] could meet the Butler and the butler was
[42:08] the direct link to Pharaoh we give the
[42:12] Lord some Praises you you see how
[42:14] amazing this thing is so here it is oh
[42:17] my pause raising you to help me you have
[42:19] forgive me tonight I was so excited
[42:20] about tonight I couldn't wait to get
[42:22] here to start this
[42:24] thing just to think that this boy you
[42:27] know some people when you see they fall
[42:29] in a bad
[42:31] slump their face
[42:33] long um they working short they working
[42:37] all the
[42:38] hours they're shorting on they work not
[42:41] Joseph Joseph working as if he working
[42:43] for
[42:44] God that means he have what to say it he
[42:50] was internally
[42:52] motivated you see when you have external
[42:54] motivation It could only go so far and
[42:56] no
[42:58] but when you are internally motivated
[43:01] that wakes up in the morning that put a
[43:04] drive in your system because you have
[43:06] purpose you have a goal it gives you a
[43:09] drive you're never tardy you're never
[43:12] looking for you know something to work
[43:14] out and somebody to wash your foot or
[43:16] put on your shoes and and and and and
[43:19] and put on your clothes you're not
[43:20] looking for that you are up and get and
[43:23] going Joseph was like that and because
[43:25] he was diligent because you know in some
[43:29] one of the Bible stories they were
[43:30] asking for the children of the captives
[43:34] who were versed in the language and in
[43:36] certain training and so on they don't
[43:38] want dum dum heads I want you to think
[43:40] about that there a kingdom that they're
[43:42] running and if they have captive people
[43:45] they want the best of the lot and these
[43:47] sons of God were the best of the lot so
[43:51] Joseph wasn't a fool he was prepared to
[43:54] learn the language he was prepared here
[43:57] to get the knowledge to get the
[43:59] information because you see he was about
[44:02] to be promoted what is the
[44:04] use the vision say you are to promoted
[44:07] or somebody want promotion listen they
[44:09] want more money first thing they want
[44:11] more work they said give me more work
[44:13] and I'll get more money no they want
[44:15] more money
[44:16] first if they get them free they get
[44:19] free but the thing about it money is
[44:22] supposed to compensate for what you can
[44:24] do or your ability or your talent and if
[44:27] you want to be promoted and you refuse
[44:29] to study you refuse to add skills you
[44:32] refuse to add qualifications and whatnot
[44:34] do you really want to be promoted no you
[44:37] just want more money and then you'll get
[44:41] disappointed because you're not prepared
[44:44] but Joseph operated with such a level of
[44:48] Excellence that he find himself ready in
[44:54] Waiting ready in waiting let's let's
[44:57] continue I don't want to jump ahead of
[44:59] myself tonight all right so
[45:03] therefore Joseph in Integrity
[45:07] stand I wrote here in parties for
[45:09] house qualify them for the prison
[45:12] experience so
[45:14] listen if you don't have the
[45:18] Integrity no pris for you but you're cut
[45:21] off from God so Joseph with his
[45:25] Integrity willing to run away from that
[45:27] woman end up in prison and he was still
[45:29] okay do you see it now what what made
[45:32] him like that what caused him to stand
[45:34] like that listen to this you may think
[45:38] here we go he should get a reward for
[45:40] his stand or recognition or a trophy but
[45:43] he got a prison term instead if he was a
[45:46] weak man or a weak brother he would have
[45:49] given up with the usual lame excuse
[45:52] excuses are lame his testimonies could
[45:56] have been there we go no family I no
[45:59] friends that is why I'm smoking
[46:02] today your you parents I had this
[46:05] written accepting dumb excuses from your
[46:07] for from your children as to why they
[46:10] need to do this that or the other or
[46:12] they need to go here there Everywhere
[46:14] You sympathize with their with their
[46:17] excuse
[46:19] strategy this
[46:21] guy have to keep the faith listen grow
[46:25] the faith
[46:28] maintain the faith in trusting God to
[46:32] sustain him could we give the Lord some
[46:34] Praises thank God for Joseph life you
[46:38] have to grow it maintain it and trust
[46:41] God with sustain him in this
[46:45] feate don't allow your present
[46:49] constraints affect your actions and
[46:52] decisions so Joseph did not make an
[46:54] excuse well not in a foreign land
[46:56] therefore work so hard I can't give him
[46:58] my best I only give him so much no God
[47:03] wants you to
[47:04] succeed don't forget that I want repeat
[47:07] after me tonight God wants me to succeed
[47:10] say that say it again yourself right
[47:13] home where you are God wants me to
[47:16] succeed he does because success reflects
[47:21] him he wants and desires you to have
[47:25] good success remember what he told
[47:27] Joshua you shall have good success if
[47:28] you meditate on the word day and night
[47:30] those from it to the left or to the
[47:31] right therefore here we go life
[47:35] challenges was
[47:38] designed so that you can grow so you can
[47:42] learn grow and
[47:45] mature adversity here we go Saints
[47:48] believe this tonight did not come to
[47:50] break you but to make
[47:53] you adversity come to strengthen you
[47:57] to make you strong and this is where
[48:00] we're going to get into this word called
[48:04] resilience Trials come to help build
[48:08] resilience
[48:10] resilience is the ability to recover
[48:13] from
[48:15] difficulties or return to normal shape
[48:18] after being
[48:20] bent
[48:22] stretched oppressed that is the
[48:25] definition
[48:27] of resilience do you get that tonight
[49:06] uh say sorry sorry about that something
[49:09] just went are you hearing me and
[49:10] everybody hearing me still oh hear me
[49:12] okay good someone just went off I don't
[49:14] know what happened there I'm like who
[49:16] Devil's a liar tonight I just everything
[49:19] seem like I thought it was
[49:21] crashed anyhow
[49:23] resilience is the ability to recover
[49:27] from difficulties or return to normal
[49:30] shape after being bent stretched
[49:35] oppressed
[49:36] resilience the quality of being able to
[49:40] return quickly to a previous good
[49:42] condition after
[49:44] problems now some people some folks soon
[49:47] as trials hit the announcement is dung
[49:50] and
[49:50] out no longer coming to church lost
[49:54] fate these are evidence of lack of
[49:59] resilience find people complaining
[50:01] complaining
[50:03] complaining easy to push a long face or
[50:06] we a long face easy to tell others their
[50:09] woes and what they're going through
[50:13] resilience
[50:14] when adversity
[50:17] arises it is easy to become distracted
[50:20] by the pain or the
[50:24] difficulties and if you remain focused
[50:26] on the purpose of God that God rais your
[50:28] for you would find strength to keep
[50:30] pressing on I remember when I was going
[50:32] through a real hard
[50:33] trial my wife and that is where forget
[50:38] it it
[50:39] really comes through the type of wife
[50:43] that is around you she tell me keep
[50:46] focused never forget that and I felt I
[50:48] was just I was you know almost a feel
[50:52] like could a disappear but she said keep
[50:55] your focus and that just resonated with
[50:58] me and I caught it I saw something and I
[51:02] told myself I say the devil want to wipe
[51:06] me off I'll give him a run for his money
[51:08] whatever the enemy expect me to do I'll
[51:11] do the opposite if he expect me to sit
[51:13] down I will stand up if he expect me to
[51:16] be silent I will speak if he tell me to
[51:18] be quiet I'll make a lot of noise in
[51:20] other words I went opposite to what was
[51:23] expected of me and man did have a time
[51:27] and I recognized that you know the devil
[51:31] he couldn't do anything after that and
[51:33] you know it's true you know when the
[51:37] devil tell God give me a crack at job
[51:41] and he will curse you and go say go
[51:43] ahead you know when when finished so the
[51:46] devil had no more to say he never come
[51:48] and bring any talk on again he never
[51:49] even
[51:52] he beat I've heard Deep by the of the a
[51:56] but I see the when finished so the devil
[51:59] had nothing to say he had to shut his M
[52:01] and keep walking he had to know there a
[52:03] righteous man on the earth or give the
[52:04] Lord some pray oh this word is true man
[52:07] this word is real this is not no joke
[52:10] something so watch the importance of
[52:13] resilience this ability to bounce back
[52:15] after a setback this ability to adapt
[52:19] and emerge stronger Joseph mindset
[52:22] prevailed even in prison he did not
[52:25] allow himself to be overwhelmed he had
[52:28] to succeed and even though here we go he
[52:31] told the butler to remember him and the
[52:33] butler forgot it did not anger Joseph
[52:36] his patience his
[52:38] quiet his waiting on God for God's
[52:42] timing it paid off I just love this I
[52:44] just love this writing this his patience
[52:48] his quiet he waiting on God listen
[52:52] Joseph was troops in I'm man Wicked Bo
[52:55] and to dream you get from Wicked man
[52:59] what kind of is that Bo
[53:01] wickedness I can't stand next time I
[53:04] interpretting
[53:05] nothing what kind of is what what kind
[53:08] of virtue is that so you see Joseph
[53:11] lived a virtuous life he wasn't saying
[53:13] you scratch my back I go scratch yours
[53:16] he was scratching your his your back
[53:18] because it needs scratching he was
[53:19] serving he was given he said listen man
[53:23] you are going to be promoted when you
[53:26] get promotion remember me the man just
[53:28] forget J he walk prison he back in tux
[53:31] suit with his b tie and different things
[53:33] and caring his drinks and stuff and like
[53:35] that he in a different realm he Palace
[53:37] but go have a time in because brother
[53:39] Bron said Joseph was not ready yet he
[53:42] had more things to shave off so I'm
[53:45] showing you that the dream he had age 17
[53:48] or whatever age he had those dream
[53:49] doesn't make things automatic it still
[53:52] have a process it still have phases and
[53:55] things to go through and if you as a
[53:57] Christian as a Believer now feel laid
[54:00] back waiting for the Lord to do and the
[54:02] Lord to do and like you a have nothing
[54:03] to do you on a wrong road you know that
[54:07] is not biblical you know Paul said I
[54:11] press towards the Mark if you are not
[54:15] pushing and pressing something is
[54:17] wronging you really in church you're not
[54:20] trying to be in the bride because the
[54:22] kingdom God is preached and every man I
[54:24] can hear you say press every man press
[54:26] into it so I want to wake you up Saints
[54:29] this
[54:30] lgic slack lazy message Believers
[54:35] that have now thinking because they did
[54:38] 15 20 how much 100 years in the message
[54:40] they automatically moving down so they
[54:43] are dead roong God have a requirement
[54:47] God have attitudes God have a way of
[54:50] unfolding how this is to be done and if
[54:53] this is the pattern and Joseph represent
[54:56] a perfect type of Christ God allow him
[55:00] not only to be hated but to be rejected
[55:03] and he could survive alone with a
[55:05] different name learning a different
[55:08] language a different people and he could
[55:10] still stand what about you and I God
[55:13] want us to stand God expect us to stand
[55:16] no excuses Joseph had no excuses he
[55:20] could have flirt around with particular
[55:22] wife and say God frustrated I fed up
[55:24] friends here believe who sister the
[55:28] church Joseph was n that Samson was UN
[55:31] foolishness this again was a choice this
[55:35] again was a choice from Sam he didn't
[55:37] recognize that woman was a dangerous
[55:39] woman because she was under the
[55:40] influence of Satan and you have to
[55:43] understand that our battle is not
[55:44] against flesh and blood our battle is
[55:46] against princip and Powers trying to
[55:48] destroy our testimony trying to take
[55:50] away the gain and I am telling you
[55:52] sometime God release pain to make us get
[55:55] the gain that he wants us to have
[55:56] strength that God all right how we going
[55:58] here now all right good to see clance
[56:01] praise the Lord all
[56:04] right so even though the butler was told
[56:07] to remember the butler forgot didn't
[56:08] anger Joseph his patience his quiet he's
[56:11] waiting on God pay off now people think
[56:14] strength is going it alone no strength
[56:17] is also the ability to recognize when
[56:20] you need
[56:22] help don't allow the enemy to isolate
[56:26] you
[56:26] into thinking you don't need guidance
[56:29] you don't need help listen friends
[56:33] nothing wrong in saying I need help can
[56:38] you help me there are many people Bluff
[56:40] their way they as sham they're
[56:42] embarrassed they don't want to say they
[56:44] need help they don't want to say they
[56:46] don't know so they say their own thing
[56:48] in between and they Bluff their way but
[56:51] friends that makes no sense Peter was
[56:53] walking on the water when Peter start to
[56:55] swi sink he didn't try to make back
[56:57] stroke and front stroke and play the
[56:59] biggest man in Tong he just say Lord
[57:01] help me we need to come to that spot
[57:04] because the devil have a way of
[57:06] isolating people and make you feel
[57:08] nobody know what you're going through
[57:09] and you're going through alone trying to
[57:11] be the bur alone instead of having
[57:13] shared interests a shared prayer
[57:15] requests people have a burden for you a
[57:17] concern for you and you get that support
[57:19] around you praise God praise God a young
[57:23] man give a testimony one time of of um a
[57:27] woman or they were having a Revival and
[57:31] you a set of old people come to this
[57:32] church about 12 so old people and there
[57:35] was one little small boy who was helping
[57:38] pump those days had some kind of piano
[57:40] organ that was had to pump the air in it
[57:41] and thing like that and he was talking
[57:43] about this boy was there and who would
[57:45] want to go Africa who would want to go
[57:47] and this boy raised his hand but that
[57:49] boy was David living Stone I think he
[57:50] has a huge testimony and when he went to
[57:53] Africa now um there were
[57:56] they evangelizing and something like
[57:58] that and one day
[58:00] some um African uh uh Warrior whatever
[58:05] say they go and kill all of them they go
[58:07] and kill all of them but it so happened
[58:10] nothing happen they see them come and
[58:11] kill them and what not eventually that
[58:13] same man came to the Lord
[58:14] and so when they asked him man but I
[58:17] thought that day you say come and kill
[58:18] all of us he said we came now this guy
[58:21] was some Scotland I think it was and he
[58:23] went to Africa they said we came here
[58:25] now but we you see 39 Giants standing
[58:27] around the whole compound that's how we
[58:29] turn Rock
[58:30] back they say when you check the church
[58:33] in Scotland they were praying around
[58:35] that same time and they had the date and
[58:38] everything else of when it happened and
[58:40] they had 39 people in the CH that was
[58:43] praying it was a powerful testimony 39
[58:46] people in chur was praying and these
[58:48] African Warriors or whatever it is
[58:51] coming to kill these Christians they say
[58:53] they saw 39 Giants
[58:56] surround the building and that's how
[58:57] they end up backing up so I say that to
[59:00] say this that the power of prayer or
[59:03] even Collective prayer is more than you
[59:05] think so you could have an issue a
[59:08] challenge it's not there among the
[59:10] saints and you know if the Saints are
[59:13] praying people are praying it makes a
[59:15] huge difference the forces of the enemy
[59:17] know there prayers are going forth so
[59:19] don't be afraid and ashamed it's not a
[59:21] weakness to say help me it's not a
[59:23] weakness to say I need help it's not a
[59:26] weakness it doesn't make you a weak
[59:27] person asking for help do you get what
[59:30] I'm saying tonight Saints oh praise the
[59:32] name of the Lord thank you Jesus all
[59:33] right let's continue all right I'm going
[59:35] to continue until I'm finished all right
[59:38] so the Revelation in Joseph heart the
[59:42] faith his belief his vision his trust in
[59:48] God was the Anchor Point of his
[59:51] resilience courage to rise after each
[59:54] fall and try again again pushing Beyond
[59:59] circumstances pushing Beyond present
[1:00:02] conditions eases
[1:00:05] 11:4 familiar scripture it says he that
[1:00:07] observe the wind shall not
[1:00:10] SW he that Reg the clouds shall not reap
[1:00:15] the Amplified says this he who observes
[1:00:18] the wind and waits for all conditions to
[1:00:21] be favorable will not so and he who
[1:00:24] regards the clouds will not reap so what
[1:00:28] that does that tell us conditions around
[1:00:31] you may not be
[1:00:33] favorable what do you
[1:00:35] do what of your attitude what words will
[1:00:40] you speak when conditions are not
[1:00:42] faved over the years by experience we am
[1:00:46] and I and by extension I saw sure lots
[1:00:49] of you some of you would know what God
[1:00:51] has brought you through over the years
[1:00:53] what mountains look insurmountable
[1:00:56] what issues look like if it cannot be
[1:00:58] solved it cannot be uh made out and
[1:01:01] whatnot and to see God's hand come in a
[1:01:03] magnificent way and bring a deliverance
[1:01:05] and bring a breakthrough and whatnot
[1:01:08] like even recently for me was quite an
[1:01:10] experience when I preach on this and
[1:01:11] kind that charity something happened in
[1:01:14] me and after I was trying to figure it
[1:01:16] out after I real realized was a complex
[1:01:19] that I had and somehow that complex sna
[1:01:22] the complex is when people lie people
[1:01:24] say things don't hold against them but I
[1:01:27] have a mind stuff inside my mind
[1:01:29] concerning them and their behavior and
[1:01:32] somehow I got freed from that I see it I
[1:01:36] got cut from that wasn't ought against
[1:01:38] people was just the complex in my mind
[1:01:40] wasn't B in my mind and I feel so free I
[1:01:43] could go and have this dinner and coffee
[1:01:45] with my enemy in the message and there a
[1:01:47] breakthrough by itself before I couldn't
[1:01:50] see myself doing that now I could invite
[1:01:52] now I could go home and knock on the
[1:01:54] door they would have to actually stay
[1:01:57] inside
[1:02:00] now it feels good it feels great
[1:02:04] actually I'm enjoying my Christianity
[1:02:07] I'm enjoying this experience I'm
[1:02:09] enjoying the fact that the prophet said
[1:02:11] it will take perfect love to enter there
[1:02:13] and I want to be a participator I want
[1:02:15] to be enjoying this thing I want to eat
[1:02:17] the fruit of this thing called perfect
[1:02:19] love oh my to enter into this rest he
[1:02:22] speaking about isn't that wonderful oh
[1:02:24] blessed be the name of the Lord let me
[1:02:26] see how we going here now all right so
[1:02:29] watch so you cannot wait till condition
[1:02:32] is right to so you cannot wait you have
[1:02:35] to do what you must do and then I have
[1:02:38] this word here called
[1:02:40] consistency marked by
[1:02:44] regularity or steady
[1:02:47] continuity free from variation or
[1:02:50] contradiction you know sometime you want
[1:02:52] a big move you want a blaze of something
[1:02:55] and and it doesn't come like that it
[1:02:56] come by small steps I sh my wife the
[1:03:01] goal of what the Bible says e that is
[1:03:04] faithful in little shall be faithful in
[1:03:05] much or has test you with little he test
[1:03:08] you with $10 and you're Vex you're upset
[1:03:10] you're fine you should get a $10,000 and
[1:03:12] oh you go get $10 half that one in
[1:03:15] drinks have that in this whatever it is
[1:03:17] and you see a faithful in 10 he give you
[1:03:19] 100 100 give you a th000 get 10,000
[1:03:23] little you know you can manage much so
[1:03:26] this
[1:03:27] consistency this is something marked by
[1:03:31] regularity steady
[1:03:34] continuity free from variation or
[1:03:37] contradiction and the scripture I have
[1:03:38] with that is Abra um Abraham Romans 820
[1:03:42] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:03:45] through unbelief but was strong in
[1:03:49] faith giving glory to God and in the
[1:03:53] Amplified it have no unbelief or
[1:03:56] distrust made him waver doubtingly
[1:03:59] question concerning the promise of God
[1:04:01] but he grew strong and was empowered by
[1:04:04] faith as he give praise and glory to God
[1:04:09] oh blessed be the name of the Lord so in
[1:04:12] this year with Joseph you could see
[1:04:15] Joseph was a disciplined guy he had was
[1:04:18] to discipline himself to be what he was
[1:04:22] discipline means harnessing your passion
[1:04:26] discipline means doing what is right and
[1:04:29] what is necessary as opposed to what you
[1:04:33] feeling happy to do that is discipline
[1:04:35] discipline connects with what your
[1:04:37] purpose is as opposed to what you want
[1:04:40] to have pleasure in so discipline is
[1:04:43] connected to your purpose when you see
[1:04:47] what your purpose is then you want to
[1:04:49] harness your energy to move it in the
[1:04:52] channel of what God is have for your
[1:04:54] life amen men praise the name of the
[1:04:56] Lord so I have a scripture here from 1
[1:04:59] Corinthians
[1:05:01] 9:24 Paul speaks know ye not that they
[1:05:04] which run in a race run all but one
[1:05:06] receive the prize so run that you may
[1:05:10] obtain and every man that striveth for
[1:05:14] the Mastery is temperate in all things
[1:05:17] now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:05:19] Crown but we are
[1:05:21] Incorruptible I therefore so run so he
[1:05:24] is comparing that to race
[1:05:26] a race anybody who want to be at the
[1:05:28] best at the top of the game they have to
[1:05:30] be temperate they have to be disciplined
[1:05:32] he say I so run I'm running like that
[1:05:35] not as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[1:05:38] that beat the ear but I keep under my
[1:05:42] body this is physical now and bring it
[1:05:44] into his objection this is his choice
[1:05:46] this is his doing least that by any
[1:05:49] means when I appr feature others I
[1:05:51] myself be a cast away so Paul understood
[1:05:54] as human beings we have our desires we
[1:05:57] have our tastes we have our feelings our
[1:05:59] Ambitions things in our heart but when
[1:06:01] come to this goal when come to this
[1:06:03] purpose when it come to this Mission we
[1:06:06] have to take stock of our lives in order
[1:06:09] to get the energy the strength the grace
[1:06:11] to do what God wants us to do do you get
[1:06:14] that so that's why Jesus in the Gard of
[1:06:16] Gethsemane could battle with his own
[1:06:18] will not my will I will be done because
[1:06:20] he had a will on his own so he made a
[1:06:22] choice made a decision to subject his
[1:06:25] will to the will of the father so he
[1:06:28] could go to Calvary to pay the price so
[1:06:31] God took Jesus through that then we
[1:06:35] ourselves have to be in such a position
[1:06:38] where we he look to see what we will do
[1:06:40] what we will
[1:06:41] choose and that gives you power the
[1:06:44] power of choice so here we are tonight I
[1:06:47] don't know what going through your mind
[1:06:48] I don't know what your challenges are I
[1:06:50] don't know what you have to face or what
[1:06:52] you are facing but here is this tonight
[1:06:54] you have a Choice as to how you will
[1:06:57] deal with what you are dealing with
[1:06:59] right now in other
[1:07:01] words Joseph could have been toally
[1:07:03] bitter he could have a bitter let's say
[1:07:05] he Liv for 30 more years or what a
[1:07:07] bitter boy can't even enjoy oh God now
[1:07:12] watch something that hatred if Joseph
[1:07:14] had hate back is hate for hate they hate
[1:07:16] him and for selling him out he ha them
[1:07:19] back to he couldn't have enjoyed that
[1:07:22] life in in under under pharaoh dead he
[1:07:26] couldn't have enjoyed it because hate
[1:07:28] and bitterness and anger it conquers you
[1:07:32] but Abraham says bitterness will rub you
[1:07:34] of Christianity will it will grieve the
[1:07:36] spirit away from you he said don't ever
[1:07:39] let that kind of Spirit come around you
[1:07:40] something to avoid is something to duck
[1:07:43] and the only way you could really see it
[1:07:44] correctly is to see how God loves you
[1:07:46] and forgive you that you could forgive
[1:07:47] others and ask God to take away that
[1:07:49] bitterness and Powerful testimony
[1:07:52] Wednesday night a brother from Sweden
[1:07:53] sent a testimony oh his heart had that
[1:07:56] bitterness and God give him a
[1:07:57] deliverance from it that is a beautiful
[1:07:58] testimony that's a great great testimony
[1:08:01] because that's a heart that getting it
[1:08:03] right God wants your heart right God
[1:08:06] just want you to come to church and
[1:08:07] whatnot he wants you to reflect
[1:08:09] something remember we talk about
[1:08:10] reflection is perfection you have to
[1:08:12] reflect something and this scripture
[1:08:15] this Bible study tonight this text on
[1:08:17] this guy called Joseph I hope it helped
[1:08:19] you see that you could survive by
[1:08:21] yourself you could survive in isolation
[1:08:23] you could survive in another country
[1:08:25] another a tongue another a language you
[1:08:27] could survive those Daniel didn't want
[1:08:29] to partake the king's meet all these
[1:08:32] guys are testimonies because they
[1:08:34] believe their God they believe in the
[1:08:37] real God they believe in serving God
[1:08:38] with all their hearts and they give it
[1:08:40] their best and God honor them and God
[1:08:42] blessed them Joseph Legacy was so
[1:08:46] powerful that the Bible says and their
[1:08:48] raise of pharaoh who knew not Joseph in
[1:08:50] other words everybody knew of Joseph his
[1:08:53] testimony was so real because he saved
[1:08:56] the world because of what he did
[1:08:58] everybody know of Joseph what about you
[1:09:02] what are you doing for God's
[1:09:04] King what could God attribute to you as
[1:09:07] a kingdom Builder Kingdom supporter what
[1:09:10] are you but Brandon woke up and say I'm
[1:09:13] 50 years old I haven't done anything
[1:09:15] let's let's get started and he was
[1:09:17] preaching for all those here all right
[1:09:20] let's see if we hear the home stretch
[1:09:21] here
[1:09:22] now I just had 10 pages tonight so Paul
[1:09:25] was saying clearly I have to discipline
[1:09:28] myself all right I'll wrap up here I
[1:09:31] want to read something from Israel and
[1:09:33] the church but I'm talking about Joseph
[1:09:35] this will cap off the whole story here
[1:09:36] to the message then he was loved of his
[1:09:39] father watch if you watch that robe
[1:09:42] without
[1:09:43] scene which represented the holy spirit
[1:09:46] that covered his being talk about Joseph
[1:09:48] and today it's the holy spirit that
[1:09:51] covers the church the robe of Many
[1:09:53] Colors and there's seven colors in the
[1:09:57] rainbow now if you want to
[1:10:00] look in Revelation the first chapter
[1:10:03] there were seven golden candes we
[1:10:05] started off with Ephesus ending in laia
[1:10:08] lukewarm church now having a form of
[1:10:11] godliness but deny the power thereof
[1:10:13] people going to church coming and saying
[1:10:14] accept Christ put their name on the book
[1:10:16] deny the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:18] power miracles signs and wonders making
[1:10:20] fun of it in Lan Church age which is
[1:10:22] spewed from God's mouth and the elect
[1:10:24] taken up
[1:10:25] something gets into my soul when I think
[1:10:27] of it friends the world and its
[1:10:30] condition then talk about aad Stone and
[1:10:33] so on we started off all right and yeah
[1:10:37] he was standing and he was to look at
[1:10:39] upon Jasper and s stone what was Jasper
[1:10:41] it was Ruben Stone what was sadus
[1:10:44] Benjamin the first and the last and
[1:10:47] there were seven golden cands a rainbow
[1:10:49] is a covenant here we go that God had
[1:10:52] made to Abraham to Isaac to Christ to
[1:10:55] the church by the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:58] Ghost the robe of seven colors that was
[1:11:02] upon Joseph that was Upon Jesus it's
[1:11:07] upon the church today protects the body
[1:11:11] was covered up by the robe and the
[1:11:13] church is not you it is the holy ghost
[1:11:17] that got you covered by the blood oh
[1:11:21] praise the name of the Lord almost done
[1:11:24] Isaiah SP to them God said that he was
[1:11:28] hiding his face from your prayers you
[1:11:30] have got your ritualistic form yet it's
[1:11:33] the truth you are doing what he told you
[1:11:36] but you're not doing it in sincerity you
[1:11:40] Squall out day and night and God said
[1:11:42] your sacrifice is atin to me I will not
[1:11:46] receive it anymore and when you pray
[1:11:48] under such condition I'll hide my face
[1:11:50] from you he said oh God if people would
[1:11:54] think of that it was start of Pentecost
[1:11:56] and God said though you be correctly in
[1:11:59] the word here we go but if you don't do
[1:12:02] it with love and sincerity God said he
[1:12:05] would hide his face and won't hear your
[1:12:08] prayers you say you are taking the Old
[1:12:11] Testament brother brandham all right
[1:12:14] let's take the New Testament 2 Timothy 3
[1:12:17] the Holy Spirit warned us in the last
[1:12:18] days the church would get away from the
[1:12:22] sincerity and the faith they would have
[1:12:25] a form of godliness but would deny the
[1:12:28] power and went with the the right with
[1:12:31] the right thing having a form of
[1:12:32] godliness this is what he said here as a
[1:12:34] reer God hates a powerless religion any
[1:12:38] religion today that hasn't got Christ in
[1:12:40] it is powerless any religion that Christ
[1:12:43] is is is in is under his own blood is
[1:12:46] got power in it you say God hates a
[1:12:48] religion without power he said your
[1:12:50] Solen Feast is a stink he said he ha it
[1:12:54] it makes me S sick remember he told this
[1:12:57] Rich Lan church that because you're
[1:12:59] lukewarm in other words you make me sick
[1:13:01] I PE out of my mouth we have come to
[1:13:04] that age God send us an Isaiah to chop
[1:13:07] the thing to Pieces it is lay out before
[1:13:09] my people cry out spe not God hates
[1:13:13] powerless religion it's got to have
[1:13:15] power in it it's got to have sincerity
[1:13:18] and listen to this now sincerity brings
[1:13:22] power sincerity brings real worship not
[1:13:27] forms but genuine power worship to know
[1:13:31] your pass from Death unto life God wants
[1:13:34] to perform his word by his power and
[1:13:38] when the church unites his power how can
[1:13:40] he perform and vindicate his word here's
[1:13:43] what happened God wants to perform by
[1:13:45] the Holy Ghost and vindicate his word
[1:13:49] and the church wants to perform they
[1:13:52] have to deny the Holy Ghost they want to
[1:13:55] perform to make big organization what
[1:13:58] else to bring membership no matter what
[1:14:01] you have to baptize Sinners drunkers
[1:14:03] bookleggers there a prostitute and the
[1:14:06] same thing it is today the church they
[1:14:09] don't want nothing much to do with the
[1:14:10] life that why they love the quote with
[1:14:14] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:14:17] is what will literally turn the hearts
[1:14:19] of the children back to the FI of the
[1:14:21] man but that is not all what the prophet
[1:14:24] said he says the church will be rebuilt
[1:14:27] in the power of the spirit that will
[1:14:29] turn the heart of the back to the he
[1:14:32] said God will send the Holy Ghost in
[1:14:33] such a way that it will turn the heart
[1:14:35] of the train back to the fathers so
[1:14:37] these guys they sincerely believe that
[1:14:40] by preaching Mysteries and long talk in
[1:14:43] their de churches that that is what the
[1:14:46] people need now because they on display
[1:14:48] they could talk for 4 hours 5 hours 10
[1:14:50] hours and mistre down the people with no
[1:14:53] life
[1:14:55] and here the prophet said what we see
[1:14:58] should put every soul into action it
[1:15:01] should make a church that would make a
[1:15:04] Revival that they will say the seven
[1:15:06] tunders are being manifested so I want
[1:15:09] to see these Mysteries manifested
[1:15:11] because the seven Thunders have to be
[1:15:12] manifested and if the seven Thunders is
[1:15:14] the Mysteries they're talking about we
[1:15:17] want to see not the explanation of it
[1:15:20] but the manifestation of it well my
[1:15:23] friends the manifestation truly will be
[1:15:25] the interpretation let's wrap up
[1:15:28] sincerity brings power if I say I love
[1:15:31] you and I don't is that
[1:15:33] sincere no it is
[1:15:36] not if I tell you I think I'm adopted
[1:15:39] I'm not adopted is that sincere of
[1:15:41] course not it's not sincere sincerity is
[1:15:45] what God want from the inner man from
[1:15:48] the heart if I'm say I love you I must
[1:15:51] mean that from my heart hypocrisy is
[1:15:55] when the mouth saying and the heart
[1:15:57] seeing something different we need to
[1:16:00] get the heart aligned with the mouth so
[1:16:03] the M could truly see what's in the
[1:16:06] heart and when it's align like that then
[1:16:09] if you shall say to this mountain be
[1:16:11] move and don't doubt you can have what
[1:16:13] in your heart so Joseph a perfect type
[1:16:17] of Christ Jacob Grace but Joseph is
[1:16:21] perfection Joseph and I know there's so
[1:16:25] much depth into it I can't even go half
[1:16:27] of it tonight but to think that when
[1:16:31] Joseph told Pharaoh the dream and Joseph
[1:16:35] not only told the dream as a problem in
[1:16:38] he brought the solution he said find a
[1:16:41] man that is wise enough in the Kingdom
[1:16:44] to manage this so the issue after the
[1:16:48] revolation came as to what is to be and
[1:16:53] what is to be done the issue becomes
[1:16:56] into a place of
[1:16:57] management and Pharaoh had the
[1:16:59] confidence to tell that
[1:17:01] man you are the man in the position to
[1:17:05] manage this
[1:17:07] year while all other bands are empty
[1:17:10] only Joseph B have green let us bow
[1:17:15] ahead Heavenly Father it was just a joy
[1:17:18] to share this story
[1:17:20] tonight about this Joseph
[1:17:25] this man
[1:17:27] who grow and build this level of
[1:17:30] resilience to
[1:17:32] stand this man who had a heart full of
[1:17:36] love and compassion for brothers who
[1:17:39] hated
[1:17:40] him he demonstrated it he showed it he
[1:17:45] said I am Joseph your brother whom you
[1:17:47] sold in Egypt I'll take care of your
[1:17:49] loved ones I'll take care of the family
[1:17:52] don't hurt yourself don't frustrate
[1:17:55] yourself God sent me ahead to preserve
[1:18:00] life in a
[1:18:02] nutshell Joseph understood his purpose
[1:18:07] he understood that all this drama and
[1:18:10] Trauma of being sold into Egypt had to
[1:18:14] do with preserving life and the bigger
[1:18:17] picture is what struck him God I pray
[1:18:21] tonight that everyone that is hearing
[1:18:25] what we are share tonight would begin to
[1:18:27] see a bigger picture Beyond themselves
[1:18:31] beyond their little bubble beyond their
[1:18:34] home beyond their family and to see your
[1:18:37] picture father the vision of God but the
[1:18:41] vision is for an appointed time you said
[1:18:44] write the vision and make it plain and I
