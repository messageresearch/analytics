the altar is where the is where you get reconciled back to God the altar is where things are all right things are fine we all born in sin shape iniquity they have no smaller sin and bigger Sin Sin is Sin Sin is Sin we have our biases of what kind sin and but Sin is Sin small sin big sin is in a category of sin isn't that right Jesus died for us sinners that we could be Redeemed by his blood Adam had the book of names and man fell before he could call it so God had to hold back the book and in the last day he drop it down to send it Revelation 10 a mighty Angel brought down the book to call names you are being called morning out of sin out of unbelief out of your condition out of your frustration Hallelujah you're being call now Hallelujah not each one name but the mystery of the book while it's calling us names amen so we have we going back to Africa to my second message I preached there in OU Nigeria but before that I do have something upon my heart that I want to share with you so maybe you could stand in your Bibles to Matthew 242 before just going to read one verse there and I'm going to read the rest from the scriptures don't ask me how I got this and why I got this I don't even ask that I just I just get things I just share things amen praise God for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it is possible they shall deceive the very elect may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated musicians thank you amen amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah just a few minutes before we go forward 2 Timothy 3 you have to find it I read it notice perilous time shall come men shall be lovers of their own selves I thinking about that and thinking how if have all these selfies you have right now these phones scking your own picture and now with these phones now they love theel taking out selfies men shall be lovers of their themselves Covetous boaster proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thanful and holy without natural affection choose Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despises of those that are good traitors he high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God and these are not people outside having a form of godliness but deny power thereof and and and the Bible oh I'll read a little bit uh having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses lead captive silly women Laden with sins Le We R divers lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth as Janice and jambers wied Moses so these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate here what concerning the faith that's that's loud not aate but concerning theate and we know what Malachi 4 was to do restore our hearts back to Def Fai of the fathers and Def Fai is another Ephesians one Lord One Faith one baptism def faith is Christ himself Tabernacle inside of you that is Def Faith it's not a faith it's God's life inside of you that is defate so when we turn our hearts back to defate it means you turn your heart back to the person of Christ Living in you and this is God's promise for this hour that Christ will be living in you how many believe that this morning it was God above us it was God With Us in Jesus Christ now we have to be God in you that is God's desire to make you his tent Hallelujah for him to cover you with him for you to be covered with him you cover over him so you to be hiding him isn't that right so blessed be the name of the Lord so I want to share something that came to me and struck me okay oh we have a praise here from Romel kidu I want to give God praise and thanks for Gathering me through my CX exam and bless me with all my passes congratulations son amen and sister nairon and brother dial they want to give God thanks for 27 years of marriage on the 14th of August God bless you be happy for you you amen praise the Lord now I want to say this since brother brandham died the seeds that had to be sown had to be seeds for the Dynamics Dynamics couldn't be released because we were not ready most of us were not even called and the message have to call out the elect for the last days now we not talking about Luther that's taken up Wesley all the passag already taken up we are in the last days where the bombs are already made for destruction of mankind this is not slingshot and robbing and bow and arrow business this say past that we we not in that age and horse and buggy we we W way past that now we we are in the age where men have the power to do what the Bible talk about the Earth burned with fire that's what we're talking about no more flood fire and brother Bram had the seven Vision where he saw America blown up isn't that right you saw America making the tribulation period because they're going to go and rock with destruction everywhere am Hallelujah we are living in that time hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so therefore the seeds that were sown to the bride since the prophet left was to produce Dynamics amen seeds for Dynamics yes sir because every seed must produce after its kind so God had us to restore listen the spoken word yes sir which is the Original Seed back to the people so watch the Bible is a seal book yes yes Revelation 4:5 tells us that until the lamb came and broke the seals and opened the book amen so therefore Baptist Methodist all the denomination they are preaching from a closed book unless they understand how these seals were opened do you understand that now so God sent a prophet that would open the seals that's right six of them because Christ is the seventh one that's right so he can only open six because Christ have to open the seventh one because that is the one have your names on it and Christ a taking no Chances with this bride the Lord himself the Lord himself descend from heaven with a shout to call you out come on now give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah you were so important to God he came know himself Pillar of Fire angel of God Mighty Angel one with the sweat back Wings one with the seven seal he came on himself and you can't thank him and you can't worship and you can't praise him give honor to him he is worthy this morning oh Hallelujah glory to God listen you are more important than the prime minister of this country you are more important than the president of the United States of America you more important than the president of Russia you are the Bride of Jesus Christ wife of the Lamb oh give the Lord some Praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God the will walk the blind will see the bride will have a Revival the seven T going to rock the world Hallelujah Hal you see Power yet power is about to be released power is about to strike the earth oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory amen you may be seated Hallelujah Glory Glory GL so therefore amen God told the prophet pick up a pen and write he told him the secret is the word is in the brain therefore they had to be a way for the word to come in the bride now a lot of people used to laugh at us because we were quoting the prophet they call us quoters not preachers we can't preach we only quoting what they fail to understand that the words from a prophet is not just words he's not a preacher he's not an evangelist words from a prophet is Spirit given words Spirit spoken words words of a prophet is seed and this Prophet this Elijah Prophet was to reveal son of man son of man veiled in it son of man so words from that Prophet is not words from a man we not feeding on a man we feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man these are words from Christ these are words from the pillar of fire these are words from the I am that I am spoke to Moses oh give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah last week I give a few quotes concering what Christians are like what true Christianity is Christ like because it look like a lot of people seem to have got away from what Christ Christians are like a lot of people feel after a while Christians are people that go to church you're wrong that's church members Christians are Christlike Christlike on the Monday Christlike on a Sunday Christlike in trial Christ like in sickness Christ like in trouble they are just Christlike because they are Christians oh give the Lord some Glory people hallelujah hallelujah nobody could take that out of them sit down a minute like I said to them in African I say to you you could change pastors you could change Doctrine but you cannot change Revelation either you have it or you don't have it if you have it your your father can't take it from you your father can backslide you cannot backslide because God has revealed himself to you your wife can backslide you can't your husband could backside you can't the church could backside you can't the pastor could backside you can't because God gave you a revelation oh my I didn't come here for this let's go back to the Garden of Eden K and Abel no eler no user no text no tweet no cell phone no facts no computer just K and Abel just working the way out just living a life normal and God say worship time just worship time let's all stand and worship Kain you come and worship and a you come and worship and they came with what they thought God would accept and God sent fire somebody say fire God sent fire on Abel's offering nobody didn't whisper in his ear abrel didn't read a book The Bible said abrel by Faith by faith Hallelujah not by text not by book not by studies not by University but by faith Abel offered unto God a better sacrifice he get a blood sacrifice it wasn't looking good it was Bloody but God sent fire upon a bloody Revelation and today the seven T is the blood oh we are bloody this morning and because the blood is over you the blood has been preached to you the blood has been placed in you fire follows the blood spirit follows the blood power follows the blood oh give the Lord a shout of pray the seven tunders is not dead hallelujah hallelujah Brother Joseph kman wasn't a false prophet no no no no no he preached the unable Riches of Jesus Christ and plant a seven tund of seed and that is in my heart and I am bringing word this morning as it is in my heart Oh Glory to God Goen thank God for that blood Hallelujah you may be seated so therefore Hallelujah therefore all the free preachers all those preachers are preaching freely for 3 hours and preaching nothing I could say in 50 minutes what is spend three hours to tell the people just talking and yapping and killing time and you could say in 15 minutes what it Taken 3 hours to say all that talk waste people time because the people don't know what's coming what's coming what's coming that's right and Jesus scripture we read he say what's coming and J shall arise false Christ false prophets shall show great signs and wonders now these guys that yet don't think I talk about anybody because reach yet so I am not talking about anybody I want you to understand that these guys that I'm talking about didn't come yet yet they have a time to come because they can't come until we come let me just let sit down on me let me just back up a little bit brother Bram for anointed once he said now he said Abel offered unto God ex sacrifice and came God testified he was righteous amen then he switched to Peter who do men say I the son of man am some say you're this some say you're that some say the other fine those out there don't know who I am now who do you say I am amen they still did know and Peter broke into the spirit and said th to Christ now this a sinner man you know this's a CBD man little drinking smoking He orary Man breaking into something by sovereignty Elohim Elohim the Lord the spirit the Father the anointing so God have nothing to do with uh what you think who supposed to get Revelation he he's Sovereign he gives it to whomsoever he will somebody lying somebody in fornicate it doesn't matter somebody blind somebody backing somebody commit adultery it doesn't matter he is Sovereign he could reveal himself to whom soever he will could somebody say Amen or that so stop stop getting a fight with people who are blessed because yours coming hallelu watch he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church not brother over building church or this pastor building church I will build my church and that church doesn't consist of bricks and stones and cement that church is revelation so as soon as somebody get Revelation there's a stone built that's stone stone in the church not a stone another rock another rock that Peter a rock rock rocks rocks Stones stones in the last days God don't picking up Stones devil can't shake them Stones devil can't move those stones you are Stone you are rock come on say Amen somebody Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout of praise that's why the devil don't understand you fall down you get back up why you're rock hallelujah bounce your head you shake your head you get back up because you are rough you stumble but you get back up because you are rough the devil want to sing like wheat but you are a rock Give the Lord a shout of Praise oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah sit down a minute oh Hallelujah so therefore Peter said what the Christ is not right and Jesus said Upon This Rock of what was revealed I will build my church and the gates of hell so we don't have to try to pump it into people like I hear a minister say I'm I'm going to reveal it and I say wow he could I thought the Holy Ghost alone is a revealer so see I can't reveal anything I could preach it but the Holy Spirit have to reveal it now if I preach my dream I had last night I preach some kind of thing that I had then you know I don't know how you can that but going to preach your word the spirit that spoke the word could reveal the word to you Hallelujah so so so therefore we ought not to be afraid to speak the word because power is in the word he not life is in the word revelation is in the word that's why the devil job is to keep you away from the word that's why the bride will not be deceived you know why because she will be the word come on I caught you on that one I caught you on that one the bride wouldn't be a church member the bride will be the word itself that's why the devil cannot receive the bride Hallelujah Glory all right one time Luther Day man came to Luther Vision like an angel with a crown on his head Golden Crown and tell Luther worship me I'm a Lord and King and Luther was the crown watch the spirit whever it is find some not looking right worship me I'm your lord looking white he remember the word they shall CR him he CR yet get behind me Satan Lucifer playing with CR trying to fool a servant of God now if you don't get it right you going run and say I see a crown s i see a vision H see you had to get right because if you're getting right and itchy itchy and jumpy jumpy with every little thing you see and hear and read you will come and testify you know what I see I from God and we say tell it I can't tell it it's a secret devil mind you because you figure you have a personal vision from God and you see an angel with a crown on his head and he say worship and you bow you bow down and do what that what that what he pass says therefore to give it the word for your vision for your inspiration for your Revelation that's why he's there he's a Watchman in the tower to keep you out of trouble from these false spirits that is loosed in the last days Give the Lord some Praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory one time a man Luther time to some Supernatural robe coming in them white robe and everybody come and see and oh of this brother and somebody say you know what let me cl to Luther said no no no Luther this man when they drag to the disappear you know what happen there he come in the presence of the word you they want to come to the light you know to do this the the foolishness when people not around when they True Light not around because when the light come cockroach scatter Darkness scatter when the light come it have to take off praise God that's why you have to be in the word I am challenging you get down in the word how do you show your love for God hallelujah read the word every day and pray come on give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah read the word every day and pray read the Psalms read the Proverbs worship God read a scripture read a book listen to a tape get down in the spirit get to know your promises get into the spirit get to know inheritance Hallelujah the devil going to lie to many in this last day you say you're kidding me brother I'm not amen you say I'm you serious yes I am amen after Peter give his exhortation and second Peter 1 virtue knowledge and Temperance that's chapter one you know happen chapter two listen to this there shall but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you this is Peter talking to the church who priv shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that brought them and bring them upon themselves s destruction and many shall follow their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of so you can't follow many amen you have to follow by Revelation because if you're following the crowd the crowd can Le to destruction because these guys many shall follow their ways okay so here the Prophet now what is Faith almost done not almost done but I'm trying to get to done what is Faith what is faith faith is something that is revealed to you here we go that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God by Revelation so that is why when God reveals himself to an individual they are different it raised them a above the opinion of others it raise them above what others think they should do and how they should do it it actually fires them out the man who had a servant sick and came to Jesus he said I'm a man under Authority I I say to one go and go and I know that you seem to have a power from your father and my servant is sick back home just speak the word only and my servant shall be healed he didn't read that in a book no Elder didn't whisper that his air he came with his Revelation his Revelation to Jesus he had Revelation he said I am a man under Authority and I recognize you are under Authority I tell a man go and he go and you tell the demons go and they go I know you got power that that that he that man had Revelation Hallelujah and because he had Revelation he approached Jesus a certain way come on say Amen somebody he said you speak and I know it's going to happen there is power in your word there is power in your speech oh get the Lord some praise His people there is power here this morning there is power in the church in the Church of the Living God L the power to heal the sick to cast out Devils so Revelation make you approach God a certain way Lord thank you Lord Revelation is what bring you out of the human Instagram with Revelation you can't say nobody like me who you like yourself nobody to look for me nobody to call me who you look for anybody Revelation bring your that human foolishness nobody shake your hand nobody smile with you you cut that nonsense out Revelation make you encourage yourself Revelation make you a prais upon your lips by faith hey Hallelujah by faith you worship God this morning by faith yes in trouble but that don't mean you can't worship come on now come on now Hallelujah struggling but that don't mean you can't worship listen listen listen listen until we come to our promise of Dynamics you have to fight earnestly content earnestly fight that what we doing this morning that's what I'm doing this morning have a big bomb to drop on you and I can't drop it platform the B I say the b you think the B you get fight with the trainer you you you you get fight for the extra so boxing gloves that's not what they have an earring this is just because you had a build up to get pressure you you you get an extra fight with little Punch coming into your stomach that trial punch the enemy not punching like that the real deception start yet what we had past there was a rehearsal yes yes yes yes yes yes you better learn your lesson you you woo you are you with me hallelujah what we have been through that just a rehearsal that is still outside the ring but there shall arise foral chist the question is when we going to get to that we're going to get to that we don't want to get to that just yet we going to get to that because that is very important I want you to understand the gravity of you getting into the word amen but brandom you see Matthew 24 it would be a sign at the end time now if this sign listen to these words now if this sign is only to be known at the end time then here this it will have to be after the opening of those seals right amen it's a sign of the end and that would be when these things happen it will be the end time and it'll be a sign so the elect elected will not be confused with these things it's got to be revealed it got to be exposed yes sir and this Vision that I'm about to read is what blow my mind because this answers where we at right now in season and time and we are we are dead on the word hallelujah farming in the land but we are nourished Hallelujah we are kept by the grace of God the famine was prophesied shall come to pass famine for the hearing of the true word of God famine is no rain so you're eating off a substance you're eating off a stored up food come on now give the Lord a praise while other bands are empty only Joseph band have grain Hallelujah they eaten from Joseph's stor house so food was tore up food from the Seven Seals food from the seventh seal food seven T of food bride promises food per food third po food adoption food perfect walk food virtues food Dynamic food Hallelujah Seven Virtues all that is food stored up food seven Living Voices seven tunder voices stored of food listen to this dream this dream answers you see I always believe you can't manufacture anything I read I preached something a while ago the bride waiting in love it's on the website uh waiting in love for the promise to be confirmed you have to wait I think Thursday message was waiting for your season and time you have a season and time for your promise to be manifested because everything you have a season and time according to Ecclesiastes 3 is not right everything under Heaven is a season and time God waited all these years to climax this end time you are not going to force it no man going to lock his neck and say have it now God have his appointed time at the time of appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life I will write this Trail once more there that point time of everything but if people can't wait they will go and manufacture thing and when you manufacture you produce a like an experiment and you produce something you didn't expect you see God promised Isaac and and they end up with ishmail and ishmail still getting trouble right now so you see there's a problem so you see whenever you manufacture it cause problem you see when God tell Eve replenish and multiply a further Revelation was supposed to come as to how right she didn't wait and then of course the devil bring break his seals and reveal to her what to do and then with his book of wisdom she got messed up and we fell but God had to break his seals now to this second Eve to reveal what to do and when to do so he said he said he said no man can make her do otherwise right she have D say the Lord or she will keep still so this bride is not an indisciplined bride this a disciplin bride there's a learning bride there's a growing bride there's a bride in love with a husband Oh Glory gory to God she's still in love she have to wait in love when you love your heart is skip a beat when you see the man that you love that's when you know your love when you love and you hear the word preach your heart skip a beat because that's the word talking to you oh give the Lord some Praises people glory to God hallelujah Halle we love the music but the music is not your husband we love the singing But the singing is not your husband we love the worship but wor not the husband we love the gifts but the gifts not your husband Oh Glory to God the word is your husband the revealed way give the Lord some Praises people oh Hallelujah glory to God so as you begin to see that man Fades out the picture Flesh and Blood Fades out the picture Minister Fade Out the picture because you're looking to see Jesus you're looking to see Christ come on the page of the bible let me go quickly now listen to this Vision hallelu God open up to the prophet the rain falls on the just and the unjust that's what the Bible say said and now notice a vision he said now the wheat and the weeds live by the same anointing from Heaven both of them Rejoice over it wow I remember this referring back to this instance up there that day at Green Mill I seen a vision come up and there was a great Earth had been diced up and there went to saw first I went I want to keep that before you watch What Goes Forth first and what follows it and as this man in white came forth around the earth sewing seed behind him came a man dark clothes on looking sneaking slipping along beside him sewing seeds weeds and as this was taking place I seen boat crops come up and as they come up one was wheat and one was weed and there come a drought oh Hallelujah that that is what is on right now a drought watch this they come a drought and when looked like both of them had their heads down crying for rain and there come a great Cloud over the Earth and it rained there is no doubt Dynamics is coming there is no doubt the cloud is coming may I inject here how that cloud going to come because seven Thunders unlock the heavens when you speak it by Revelation so therefore the seven Thunders going to have to unlock the heavens and then rain going to fall in other words it'll be spoken by Revelation and unlock the heaven that had been shut by William brandham 7 se7 under the prophecy he actually shut the heavens because he going to have too much unrighteous partaking of the Holy Ghost if rain fall upon uncont contrary seeds so you have to make sure your seeds of God the elect is called out make sure the elect of God is pregnant with Christ the person of the Holy Ghost because out of your seed Will Comfort the person of God oh give the Lord Praises do do you see that now so watch drought came up both of them had their heads down crying for rain there come a great Cloud over the Earth it rain and the re raised up and said praise the Lord praise the Lord and the weed raise up B praise the Lord praise the Lord same results both of them perishing both of them going away then the wheat comes up and get thirsty because it was in the same field same Garden same place under the same Sprout here come the wheat and the tears the very same thing the same anointing Waters bring forth the wheat and the seed yes but AB Bram said her ripeness the bride the true bride will mature and her ripeness hear this shall be her identification with the Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness now you said notice it didn't say false Jesus false Christ watch it's false teachers of it false prophets of it false teachers false anointed false Christ false teachers that's the only way you can see it so when they say false Christ and I'll go down I I'll summarize I don't want to read all too much he say it's not the prophecy that is false it's the teachings that is false the prophecy spirit-given prophecy coming to pass but the teachings that is false Now list this oh my so therefore the Dynamics is going to fall to produce the Glorious baptism of the Holy Spirit isn't that right when the Dynamics fall that is where the war going to begin that is where the battle is going to begin so right now we just warming up hallelujah praise God but the battle is about to start when the dynamic strike because when the Dynamics Strike It Strike the wheat and the weeds amen it's like the true and the false both are waiting for the Dynamics Hal the Lord a shout of Praise this exaltation right now is an appeal to prophecy amen that I was inspired with to see am by the grace of God to see what is going to come to pass to see what's along the way isn't that right so therefore when the battle is about to start and therefore Satan will try to come with deception and whatnot and when that can't work when he misses the bride cu the bride will be taken up into the Raptor when he misses the bride Revelation 12 he make war with the remnant of the foolish virgins isn't that right 3 and a half year tribulation so you don't want to be in that he'll be going like a roaring line to take them over so brother Bram said that the force anointed they come afterwards to pervert the original word what we need in our churches is a man that's got an absolute what we need in the Methodist Church the Baptist Church the Pentecostal church the presan church is an absolute a man of God that will stand time to the word and to Christ here we go and bring that congregation under the condition of where each member walks in the condition of this word and see that word manifested oh Hallelujah in know way to stay with it am stay with the vision stay with the purpose that the message come for all what we are doing for this year is to bring us the Dynamics if we don't get the Dynamics we are failed but we have to come to our promise Hall hallelujah praise God praise God everything else is a distraction Hallelujah brother say we build bigger seminaries bigger churches better pews bigger organ better dressed crowd and what we have denominational death he said if I die in my tracks my absolute is Jesus Christ I'll be somebody say he'll preach the post he said I'll be preaching to God's word to the post then because able to raise up stones to Abraham here we go I'm almost closed this is good now watch the truth Vine the false Vine same anointing water fell upon them it will SE very like if it's possible notice man does not gather grapes off a tisle even though the t is right in the Great Vine what is the fruit the fruit will tell it what is the fruit the word for the fruit of the Season what is it their teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the Season man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine amen so what will make the difference between the true anointed and false anointed not the prophecy not the signs not the Wonders not the Miracles so those people that up on that the first sign and say wo that's God is that right what the man teaching see bam Anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses was perfect the now the teaching of bam not the prophecy oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord here's the shocking here's the shocking part listen to this as John and J Moses so these men resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the Fate that that was one delivered to the Saints of course concerning the faith and he shall turn the faith of the fathers to the children back to the fathers reprobate concerning the faith he said now what he said if you want to go into the scoffield it say apostasy here and then brother Bram quote the scripture uh shall not God avenge his elect which Cent him day and night I tell you he will avenge them speedly nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth it's unbelievable to think Jesus will ask that question after the son of man come to reveal himself to bring back the faith but it was so bad he said when the son of man cometh shall he find the faith that was revealed shall he find that on the earth Well church you have to answer that you have to say that F going to be in me he going to find it in Me Oh Glory Hallelujah I'm going to close with this now the question here is where I wanted to go to in Revelation 10 we'll get to a few minutes in the days of the message of the seven Angel the mission go ought to be finished here's the question if you following that line in this s will it be finished will I find the faith will Malachi 4 be fulfilled at this time restore the faith back to the fathers oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm finish this morning so I want to challenge you to get down into the word because we have a rare rough time come up ahead and I won't be able to tell you at that time because that time is too late to change you can't change the seed amen praise God so I wonder if right now that is going forth false teaching true teaching all kind of teachings going forth and rain looking to fall on it and and those that have taught the true teachings of this virtue coming inside of you when the rainf a rainbow a rainbow going to come out of you the life of God going to flow to you you're going to add to your virtue knowledge and Temperance and patience a glorious baptism of the are you looking for it a lot of people not

Hallelujah I've I've known but the about 33 years now long time that's a very long time we have been friends since 1982 that's a long time when I heard left the inspir it didn't click right because you can't change revelation no no no Revelation is not what somebody text you or somebody tweet to you somebody send you an email or a link listen to a message God talk to a man whenever God talks to a man that man is just different that man is fearless that man don't care if tell people that's what the Au a man that God may be seated so I really appreciate him to see him grow as a god call man that will stand alone if he has to bless you brother Jesus never said cover it up you shall be free no Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth is what going to set you free who the son of Mane free indeed of Satan must be envious of you tonight because he can't understand the Liberty we feel in our hearts this Liberty that begin on Earth this Liberty did not begin on Earth this Liberty is what God told the Son of God sh Jo the Morning Star together intellectual ministers Believers understand understand sh we praise God don't understand that we have become the very mystery you have to look at us stop reading about stop just looking at your Bible this Bible will become flesh what you see written here to be walking in Africa you will be seated give me a few minutes I just want to finish this greetings you may be seated amen amen so I really appreciate this morning last night precious brother John my God what a message praise the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Blessed Be name of the Lord hallelujah sealing Angel is here seal up the bride and brother John us into our purpose not Church battles not Minister Warfare but really to get ready for the coming of the Lord God bless you you don't know what that message mean to me you know we we we we are not here to entertain people we not here to entertain you we not here to crack jokes and entertain this is a dead serious this is man heart failing for fear this is the president of America don't know what to do this is Israel Palestine and the Palestinian having issues and they don't know what they going to unfold to if you know the little incident that started World War I knew it was going to expand to the extent that did but it did and what you don't know you don't know what where this convention in God's mind what is the next move of God from this very convention you don't know but let me tell you this the angel of God is on the earth fing things around for the coming of the Lord everything he will shake every manade interpretation going to shake every man kingdom is going to be shaken Every Man's idea so glad to be of the Shaker hallelujah hallelujah you're going to either be

that whole armor God bless you brother praise the Lord but friends friends we have to come to like what brother John saider on our purpose and if you understand your purpose anything that trying to shake you off your purpose is the enemy you see God want a church of power God want a glorious church he want a church that he could be proud of we have 40 plus years in this message ought not to be one question on the word there ought to be not one question or in teaching because God a prophet the prophet have dust sayth the Lord a prophet don't have his own opinion a prophet speaks do say the Lord so what we have is the plum line what we have is the measuring Rod the word from the prophet of Malachi you will be seated but you know what like in Africa unlike in some third world governments the leaders take so long that they believe after a while that they own the country they own the people people stay so long in church systems that they believe they belong to some man or some church but in real reality you supposed to be the wife of the Lamb you supposed to be the bride just one more I want to say before I read the scriptures Bram he talk about those directors those conductors he spoke about the symphony and in the symphony violin trets trp BS clarinet and everybody can play their instrument but there is one man that stands on a platform with a little stick and he's the one that gives the little hint he doing now he is reading from a sheet to read the music each man in that Symphony have to be able to read the part that they have to play everyone can't play the same thing the man with the drum he has to wait to get the signal H that drum the man with the symbols he has to wait until the director until the conductor he is in the spirit of the composer is the great composer composed the music sheet and sent William pram to reveal the Sheep music and the fful ministry is the play as it is written they supposed to read the same sheet music and conduct the group conduct it well now if there's an interpretation that paper it will not come out right if there's a wrong signal it will not come out right so the prophet says the conductor must be in the same Spirit of the composer in other words you have to have the which is the mind of Christ which is the voice of the Archangel to reveal the and time of your living him give the Lord a shout of Praise I want to turn your Bibles to Revelation chapter 8 Revelation chapter 10 revelation 22 blessed be the name of the Lord W Revelation 8 apal verse one and when I opened the seven seed that was sils in heaven about a space of half an hour Revelation chap 10 for the this morning praise the Lord I want to read from 1 to 6 I saw another might Angel come up from Heaven CL with a cloud rainbow upon his head his face was with a sun his feet is still as a fire he has in his hand little book open he set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth cry with a loud voice when a lion roar it when he had cried seven tunders uttered the voices when the seven tunders had uttered the voices are about to write I Heard a Voice of Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which your seven Thunders uttered and might them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that live forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that are therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer Revelation chap 22y reading verse 16 and 17 Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root of and The Offspring of David the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bright say come let him that hear say come let him that is the thir come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely let's pray father we thank you for your scriptures Lord and we pray that you would come down Among Us and interpret the word to our hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated praise God blessed be the name of the Lord I have a title tonight and I took the title from Revelation 10 verse6 time no longer this is when time Runs Out time no longer I have an inspiration and I'm taking that from Revelation 112 first part that says I turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and I want to take from there turning to see The Voice name of the Lord hallelujah praise God so I believe that the seed in you and I is right and I believe that the dynamic is about to pour out upon those who have kept the faith isn't that right I believe that there is to be a power that is released to the bride to produce birth power for service not adoption yet but power for service in that power for service you will have signs you will have wonders you will have Miracles but not adoption yet you still have to be tested you still have to be tried you still have to climb the mountain because the Bible said he came onto his own and his own receive him not but as many as receive him to them he gave power to become the sons of God so this is that instance Sons this is growing in God or adding the life to get to the top of the pyramid in other words a power has to come that we could be formed into the word image and be adopted and positionally placed in the Kingdom of God in other words as Jesus was the revelation of God you and I becomes the revelation of Jesus Christ so our very life reveals Jesus Christ oh blessed be the name of the Lord and what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ listen to him he said watch now watch let me say this I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God that's a prophet going in the future present tense he already see you sealed he already see you sealed so stop wondering you want to be sealed you got to be sealed Hallelujah hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord Brother I believe the mechanics is there they are waiting for the Dynamics let me drop this bomb from the prophet he is the Dynamics who is the Dynamics he is the Dynamics that he somewhere Europe no America no South America Africa know he is the dynamic come on now come on now that's why you have to sign that's why you have to cry because you want the Dynamics and the angel put a mark upon those that sigh upon those that cry sit down a minute let's get down into the word when God said my people start S Jour in a strange land years and after those years with a mighty hand I'm going to bring them out I'm going to brought this out was a real powerful thing even though God said I will bring them out when those years came up the people had to cry after 400 years God put a thirst in the people yeah hold it hold it hold it you see many of times we are waiting on God but what you don't understand God waiting on you oh sit down a minute I say your sit down a minute I say said this if you could only get started God will do the rest but BR he took a rock he threw it up in the air and it started from a whirlwind and God through the Whirlwind said you have to do something for something to happen therefore the Dynamics will be a reaction come on now if we could only get started God will do the rest God brings the test to see our attitude and our action towards what he promised because God can't lie if God said the seven tunders it's the bright Revival and there have been no manifestation of God to the bride yet but he will sell it he promis it if you see it then you supposed to ask for it sit down a minute let's get on into the word 1906 just around the Pentecostal the start of the Pentecostal Revival 1906 a half blind man Reverend sour he was reading the scriptures down in a bment and he saw where God promised the spirit and he began to have prayer meeting asking God to bring his promise to pass and when he created the atmosphere you heard that word atmosphere atmosphere he created the atmosphere atere then the Holy Ghost pour out and that started the Pentecostal Revival Luther had mechanics and Dynamics Wesley mechanic Dynamics what about you and I when are we going to get up from all this intellectual knowled Stu and begin to say where is the Lord God of Elijah when are we going to say where is the lord El Hallelujah HJ hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated let's make it B Point again look at Elijah and Elisha Elijah he has the robe Elisha he want that Rob he is thinking to himself if I get that Rob I'm going to get everything G cross ask what you will he said I want a double portion that's what I want Elijah said if you see me go you could have it so you had to keep focused he can't be reading newspapers he can't be looking at magazines he can't be looking at movies going alignment here and sitting down here no you got to be focused because Elijah said you have to see me keep watching now because you don't know when I'm going to go but if you see me go you can get what is Promised Give the Lord some Praises people now watch he saw him go he dropped down the mantle and Elijah put on the mantle yes I'm but I I Ain feeling no power and I have the mant of Elijah this is the same man Elijah but I ain't feeling any different all of a sudden he recognize it's not the mantle it's the god of the mantle it's the god of Elijah so there is the lord El and when he cried out that anointing struck him Hallelujah so you can't sit there like a dumb dog in Israel you better open your mouth and call for your promise oh give the Lord a shout of Praise You can't sit and cross your legs as if you some big shot even the four Beast even the 24 throw down their crowns and begin to worship the worthy to take the book and to loose the Seven Seals the L that was oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah so he is the Dynamics we just become members of

church has no conscience no more you could hardly wake them up the Bible said they would come in that condition listen to this this is the prophet prophesying of the condition of the church in 2014

daughter must grew up in God tapped him on the shoulder and said come I want to show you something and God began to show him when he was small all his sins all the wrong things he's doing coming up before God then he saw the blood of Jesus like a bumper from going to God then he saw a book that Mar pardoned Dro in the sea of forgetfulness told him I forgive you and you condemn her we not talking about somebody in Inspiration we talking about a sinner in a restaurant and God told the prophet that is not the way to behave you can't condemn her when I forgive you in other words the same Mercy the same Mercy I give you you go and show her and the prophet went to the woman and said woman I was condemning you but the Lord Rich Mercy show me myself and now I come to let you know that God set you free and in the restaurant she got down on her knees repented of our sins and was restored back to God that is Christianity that so brother mam says when the church finds his brother love when the

on here who is going to open the book who's going to bring back the book of redemption who's going to pull me out of this rock Glory but when the lamb took the book John saw his name begin to shout

the 11th our Gentile workers to receive the same pay the evening time message is to restore Blessed Be of the Lord Brother Bram I've always thought the church wasn't a half Hazard he never died in a half Hazard he came from church without spot or wrinkle now listen to this that church is a predestinated church and every name that was put on that book Jesus came to redeem and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed and butam said maybe the last one might be in Africa but one of these days the last name the last name going to be redeemed the book going to be closed will be judgment but a prde anointed appointed predestinated inspired to be on the earth preach one last time the gospel of the Kingdom Jesus said this gospel must be preached and then the end shall come forget about the war forget about the rumors of the this go must be preached and it can only be preached power with demonstration with signs with wond with Miracles that's the only way the go could be preached not this intellectual stuff oh Hallelujah the gospel going to be preached we going to preach it with power with witness with Anointed with the p of fire with the voice of the Archangel the Lord himself hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallu hallu Hallelujah hallelu Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah there have been no manifestation of God he will send it he promised it he said if the people would plead the promises you know what is to plead the promises to tell God you promised me the Holy Ghost you promised me Deliverance you promised my healing Pro you promise me myaling you are guilty until you bring in the you made the promise you made the promise you made the promise you promis power you promis Dynamics you promise the perfect Church youi Jo Hallelujah yes Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory hallelu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hory to I'm going to finish the holy spirit is here but there something I want to finish read for you watch and someday when the book of redemption is finished the lamb takes it and then the last name is called off of that therefore the fold Ministry would come with the book they would come with the book the book going to be in there pill of Fire have the names of the book and the P fire be veiled and the adopted Sons no this and hav struck the inspiration John turned to see the voice but you cannot see a voice you could only hear a voice you can't see a voice but a voice is a person so when you hear a voice behind the voice is a person and God's voice was split up to Seven Ages God's voice unfold to Seven Ages collect the seven Parts the seven parts and bring it back voice the voice of God in the last days Days Of The Voice are you with me look at brother Bram seven angels come from eternity picture was taken everybody seeing seven angels brother Bram SE seven angels but one day God told him are you looking at it right turn it turn the picture turn the picture turn to see the voice I wonder who we speaking tonight God got to have witnesses on the earth when turned it was no longer seven it was one Lord one fa glory to God same Jesus when the picture was turned you only see Jesus it's not about the ministers it's about Jesus and his PR for Ministry is for the perfecting of you work for you toy you to build you Hallelujah okay Glory Hallelujah yes and the last name goes on that book then changes words or the last name that's redeemed that was put on the book watch he comes to claim what he redeemed it might be a strange time watch have we waited too long is there many out there that will never come in has the last name been redeemed it could be you know it could easily be and never interrupt the scriptures we don't know so be careful when these Thunders let me read back it's Thursday time from the mighty angel that time was finished and when these Thunders brought forth their voices think of it an angel with a cloud rainbow over his head you know who that is swore by himself seven ters after the voices that time would be no more hallelujah hallelujah then if time has run out it's later than you think 1962 says if time has run out it's later than we think said God told him your message will wind up the Loose Ends I will introduce the Messiah but this Angel brings the next announcement so in other words for the ministry El a son of man was the tie of the loose end but he was introduced Christ the seventh seal that is what is here tonight the mighty Angel the one with hisat wings he is with his people glory to God so the next Angel The Mighty Angel brought the next announcement he said might be closer than you think it has got me scared shall be no more he announces the time is over seriously think if it is then the pyramid is kept by the seven Thunders is this the mystery of the Thunders to bring back The Headstone headone to come upon the bra to fulfill Revelation the bride have to meet with her husband bride has to become wife his wife has made ready the bride has to get an experience connection the supernatural seven perfect Spirits from the back side of the book baptizing you into the kingdom of God you did not come in the beginning you well before the beginning hallelujah hallelujah and those spirits that is fighting you they came in the beginning you will before the beginning Give the Lord some prais oh Hallelujah bless Lord and I'm closing with this brother says and the reason that the church is in the condition is in because there are so many voices to attract the church away from the voice of God the voice of the supernatural there are so many intellectual voices great voices mighty men who are intellectual and in their intellectual condition they shake the Nations and cause the voice of God to be placed way back somewhere to be placed way back somewhere close with this hallelujah hallelujah now I'm not finished with the message now I'm going to CL so maybe we'll continue in Ghana somewhere hallelujah hallelujah but the voice of God how will we know here we go everybody saying stuff didn't Identify some new Minister and introduce new losers doct hiding it under Hidden Mysteries that is the new thing Hidden Mysteries bring all kind of corrupt teachings okay let's go now watch How do we know it's the voice of God because because for today it wasn't a vated prophet how do we know it's the voice of God because it will be here we go the manifestation of the prophet's word we have to say this is that Prophet William time shall be no more time has run out you got to be sealed time to get desperate by the Holy Ghost desperate for Revival Shake Yourself P your conscience we got to get the token get the Seal of God bless hallelujah

anointing here this morning you know I said to the young people yesterday say I I saw a quote earlier this week that there are only two very important days in your life the first is the day that you are born and the second is the day you find out why you were born and I believe that we're in a season where the bride is finding out why she was born because but brandom said the moment you realize who you are then the Raptor is going to go so I believe somebody is coming is waking up to the realization that you are born for such a time as this and even though the Devil Comes against you the devil can't stop you he has a job to do but we also have a job to do somebody say amen amen so for a few announcements firstly I want to thank all the young people who made it out to you service yesterday my what a time we had may God bless you for your labor for your love for your sacrifice and may the Holy Spirit continue to work with you all right so announcements firstly this coming Tuesday there would be a service maraval by Brother Nicholas house so those of you who are in the west uh you're welcome to join us with that service service continues this Thursday at 8:00 and for those of you who missed last week Thursday you need to get that message we had Qui a time last Thursday so it's available it's on the it's in the library it's on the website you you get into that it's for some good food on Thursday night amen uh very importantly uh brother ID would like to see uh and speak with all those who are planning or have interest in going to the meetings in Pennsylvania right after the service so if you're planning to go to the PA meetings please uh don't go downstairs wait right here so you can speak with you uh right after the service additionally on September 1st we announc that we'll be having our Church Fellowship uh Sports Funday uh in the in the Maro uh Mar youth facility and um we do have have a registration fee um we're trying to get about $20 per person just to cover the expense and I believe the Bony castle and stuff like that uh $20 per person and as an option because we're trying to maximize the time and we're trying to start 9:00 a.m. um if you are interested in Saving the time to cook um we are looking to put some kind of food arrangement in place um for those of you who want to just drive up and enjoy the day and have a meal there and there will be cost of that of course uh uh for adults it'll be $50 per person and for children under 12 it'll be $30 per person it'll be food and drinks um so after service today we're going to begin the registration process at least you can give your name so we kind of have a count of what we're looking at for that day and uh finally in preparation for the commencement of Sunday school on September the 7th there'll be a meeting after the Church of the Sunday School workers and if there's anyone else who that's interested in being part of that program that initiative to work with the young kids and to work with the teenagers uh you're welcome to join us in the meeting right after service in the sanctuary here as well so just to make sure I got it all right on Tuesday there's a service in maraval uh service continues on Thursday but over it we like to see all those who want to go to the PM meeting right after Service registration begins today for the September 1st Church Fellowship day registration cost is $20 per person if you if you want food catered it'll be $50 for adults $30 for children under 12 and there'll be a brief meeting for the Sunday School workers after
