unfold it's another and each age you had what the people have been made of and the people fought on Bibles and the books and the actual knowledge of the word of God he calls man to invent the printing press and that printing press got your word into print and then you had Wesley and others that was Distributing the Bible and when you're ready to get it on tape you had the days of the voice you had man to invent Lord tape recorder are we able to catch a prophet last Aid message and then Lord we go out into the video and then into the internet and now here we are in this virtual room Lord Gathering we could have done other things tonight but we choose to be here we choose to hear from your word and your truth and we pray that they've been made real to us made manifested us Father prayer visit but either tonight touching from the crown of his head so let's throw his feet not feeling well development me you'll visit him in a special way and any other person's sick here follow me or Spirit minister to them uh what a beautiful song by Anthony Cruz bedia my strength is perfect but our strength is gone and we confess our weakness we confess our struggles we confess our battles and that you are our strength your Shield your butler your Steve we invite you to have the perimeters tonight take me out of the way and lay the writing will be spoken tonight the writing is set tonight the writing the utter tonight that the people may be helped delivered encouraged strengthened in this rough and tough hour we live in granted Lord in Jesus we ask it amen God bless you and welcome tonight it's great to have each everyone of you here tonight second forward to seeing you in service on Sunday I trust them that the service on Sunday will have blessed your heart that's that same Holy Spirit and that spirit is what God has used over the years and ages to get to his elect to guide his people together never once you've never put whatever God's eye won't allow things to happen and he owes other people that believe him and there's a scripture for that using my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow there's something about a genuine Saint a genuine son a genuine daughter of God a heartened and they cleave too what's the voice it's not that you wouldn't go through a rough time enough touches but you really trust that his mood is true the devil a con man do not conjure up in his life they tricking people into losing trust and losing confidence and find themselves on their own little private interpretation Island where they think they know it where they think they have the answers or anything during the war and it's a false glare a false thing all together so tonight if your bibles are like return to two portion of script you want to read some James chapter five seven of those seven to twenty and we also want to read from Hebrews 10 verse 35 to 39 again I want to thank you all for being here tonight James Frank and verse 7 it says be patient before brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold and and here here is being an appoint reference um of of a contrast behold the husband man waiting for the precious fruit of the Earth and had long patience for it until he received the Indian Lottery we also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord joined life and then in speaking about these patients it speaks now of how you're going to deal with one another are we going to treat one another Grudge not one against another Brethren Lucy become dumb so now this is speaking to Christians speaking to believers not a grudge against one another Brethren at least be condemned before the judge family before the door take my vision the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience and that's the word we're going to hit tonight patience behold become them happy we can view you have heard of the patience of Job and seeing the end of the Lord and the Lord is very pitiful out of tender Mercy but Above All Things my brethren swear not foreign you're maybe me at least he fall in the condemnation is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any merry you can sing songs is there anything among you let him call for the Elders of the church let them pray over him anointing him with the oil the enemy of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall see the sick and the Lord shall raise them up and if you have any committed sins they shall be forgiven through 16. confess your faults one to another that he may be healed the effectual proven prayer or righteous man I feel that much Alliance was a man lighting and delighted that subject to light passion as we are if we honestly that it might not rain and the rain not only Earth by this place of three years and six months and he prayed again and the Heaven givering and the airport food of fruit brethren if any of you do Earl from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converted The Sinner from error of his ways shall receive a soul from Death he shall hide a multitude of sense so this was a scripture you read covers you know the realm of how you treat how your handle issues and challenges and comparing and have Elias as an example Amanda prayed earnesty and what happened and he prayed again and what happened so we have to do like the example set before sibus 10 and this is a text that I want to extract tonight Hebrews 10 verse 35 to 9 reads cast not only therefore your confidence which had great recompense of reward for you have need of patience after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he'd have cometh will come I will not carry now the judge shall live by faith and if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back onto perdition but of them that believe the deceiving of the soul may God bless his word so good night and we are really grateful to have you all here tonight the Amplified of that scripture says do not fling away your Fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward you have need of steadfast patience and endurance so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God and thus receive and carry away and enjoy the full of what is promised boosted theaters under Joshua lit by feet my righteous favor shall live by his conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things and holy father born of faith and conjoined with it and if he joins back and drinks and fear my soul has no Delight or pleasure in him but our way Glory is not that of those who draw back to Eternal misery peridition and utterly destroyed but we are those who believe who believe to and trust him and rely on God to Jesus Christ the Messiah and Faith preserve the soul so could you imagine people have come forward to receive Christ to believe God to receive the end time message and they find themselves drawing back and God said I have no pleasure my soul has not enlightened them and the title of what I want to share tonight is cast not obey your confidence you have need of patience don't Cast Away your confidence confidence and this is what they have the feeling of belief that one can have faith in or rely on someone something that's the confidence the feeling of belief that one can have faith in and rely on someone or something you know people make excuses lots of excuses ton of excuses you make excuses because they don't want to deal with themselves they blame others it always amazes me how people get angry at others what others do what others see how others outcome live and they don't seem to get angry with themselves they don't want to look in the mirror of the word to see their own actions attitudes and own behavior and it is easy to find flaws and find faults in others and it's almost as if by finding forms and flows with others it justifies your position but in God's eyes it is not like that and God I all have sinned and comes out of the glory so you're trying to gauge your brother's eyes out or sister's eyes out doesn't justify that you are right and you things are fine it is not so now as we go deeper there are some people who have a portion of this virtual knowledge wisdom pictures and so forth that don't even profess to be Christians so this was not people practicing the god-given nature of these things because we have god-given nature of patience and god-given nature of knowledge you have people that are Hindus Muslim Buddha it doesn't matter unbelievers have qualities fine qualities that not not even Christians and they are what you call nice people but this here is not what we are talking about and in this context we know the scriptures that computer one I'm giving all intelligence out to your feet with human knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and body kindness if we examine it it have no way it's this time still it has no way it stays see where you are why is it that there are people who seem to have been stunted grounded and they seem to be in the same spot marking time when God call us to reach the art God is in this thing of growth uh achievement Target goals going further come up here going higher God is Not static he's not one track what I love about him how he never have one animal or plant and one of his own to have this book they are different type of lions different type of bees different type of birds different type of trees different type of herbs there's all different it's almost as if every one just like our bodies the past our bodies have such an effective part to play that no one could boost better than the other you come like the nose feeling led to be by himself because he just want to swell alone or emote just want to talk he wanted he has to hear nothing that makes no sense the whole body 50 joined together is what makes up this glorious body and until we come to this spot where we could realize that each person each believer each member each seed of God after come to its own future then we have some serious challenges in our hands there are some people by their own experience they like to just deal with three or four or five people and that's the end of their world maybe their own family is the end of their world they others they may not grow up like that God never see it like that God will keep reaching out to the lost to the lonely to those that are struggling the spirit of God they forget will keep because that's what we caught US it's not because we were fine we were in trouble and his spirit is what we respond to that brood over us and brought us to this world message so what Obama was saying there are there are people who have a portion of this virtue and knowledge and wisdom and faith that don't even profess to be Christians there are some people have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be a Christian but that won't do okay he said that won't do that won't do it it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings to make him a peacock he only disgraces himself be better to stay a black person see when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian he is simply all out of place so God himself has given us these promises right we are on deserving and he promised us to be this that is bright he promised us to be this last day super church he promised us all these different things don't Cast Away confidence of what God has already done for you when I look back at my own life I keep seeing things that God has done it's not will do now it is what he has done it is what God has done has brought me to where I am now it's not what I have done in myself is what God has done and I show all of you here tonight could look back in your life and see what God has done what God has done for you how God has taken you through two different issues and challenges and trials and you are still here so I want to challenge you and encourage you tonight stop don't doubt now you have come this far who brought you this far who brought you into this wood who really brought into this message you meet people who are arrogant you meet people who are puffed up you meet people who are indifferent you make people who are you really wonder if they're even saved because their behavior does not align to the Christian principles that have been released to us we are not Baptist we're not left to this we're not Pentecostals these are what the Bible called Blasphemous means we are called to be named after Christ to be like Jesus okay so therefore God himself is who brought you to himself you didn't choose this message in that sense the message chose you so you already on the called side you are part of those who have been called out now redemptions is in two parts being called out and go into what God wants you is to go into going to that secret place okay so tonight we want to kind of take a peek a best word called patience you don't have temperance and patience and courtiness and bodily kindness and if we drill down deeper into each one of these virtues each one of these virtues have their particular place in dealing with particular challenges and patience itself have its place and it's in it's in this is it is very um interesting or the Bible said you have need of patience one two after you have done the will of God and in that message he says when you do what God tells you to do doesn't respond it doesn't react that's the very hour to be certain of God because you see that lull that's peace is where the enemy comes and butter your mind and thoughts come and that is why we say like patience like a triple virtue when brother was told to speak for these girls I want one deer I want one dear the first one appeared right to me I want one deer second one to get a little longer the third one um he spoke and times had to thickening 15 minutes 20 minutes take half an hour whatever and he said hello for the two because I thought you said another one he was teaching him something or the Bible didn't say how long the monkey will move it says if you shall stay to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you see now remember our father your father when he spoke in the beginning and let there be light he could have taken a thousand years to Thousand Years ten thousand years but eventually and there was light so God himself has patience to weed until his word materializes and in the scripture he read he talked about the husband man nobody fling out the corn seed and then expect tomorrow morning to pick on the the farmer or the husband man they put out the corn seed and they have to wait they have to wait for the rain that's that's the part that they don't control their job and our job is to put in the seed that's your job and then the rain comes and do his work he begins to grow on people and then time unfolds the life of the pumpkin the watermelon the corn the peas whatever you put into the soil time itself unfolds that because God put a law of life with implant life within life itself the law of life to reproduce itself so when time comes the rains come oh that husband might have patience he waited for the Harvest of the whole Earth and we know we are living in the end time and I said something my son yesterday of a card you're working on and they said there will be no need of a steering wheel they don't even need a pedal and the car sheep exceed is very interested that they have to wait for technology to pick up to connect with the prophecy the prophecy said 1933 by Vision that they were with science will get so powerful that they will develop a car that has no steering wheel that the people was playing checkers or whatever in the car and he was taking it to their destination well they are almost there we are right on the verge of it we are right to see what was seen my vision since 1933 seat unfold right before our eyes but that was not the only Vision that came is the vision of a bride of Jesus Christ there's a vision of a super Church there's a vision about Jewish Soul Jewels Mighty Army there's a vision of a glorious Church Without Puerto Rico all these are Vision even John himself saw a vision and the vision that he saw has to come into a reality if we can truly believe what the Bible said or what the scripture says because that is what it is all about do you believe the word and when we see wood you know uh people get fight and they get this fight and they can fight for this church and it's preaching this past and this telling them is thinking again fight they again fight with themselves they're not one they want to fight and wrestle with the word because then you find the supposed fighting you're supposed to wrestle with the angel not with me I am notified I'm not hindering you from the Rapture or if I'm getting blessed and what nothing no no what you have to wrestle with is the angel you have to get to the angel to meet the angels with the angel to get a change but hear what I want to get to know James won let's turn our Bible to James chapter one and this is so very important James a servant of God of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greetings so this is like a word from the Lord Jupiter James but James speaking does tonight my brethren come with all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations he's not talking to sinners he's not talking to unbelievers he's not talking to people who don't want to save God he's talking to Believers people are already in there who know Christ and he's talking to graduate Brendan counted all joy when you fall into the diverse Temptations knowing this that the train of your feet Wicked patients so it is cleaner Faith come by hearing hearing by the good of good you cannot see you have no feet if you say you have no feet you could get feet if you say you have no feet you could get dear because the Bible say your feet come feed comes by hearing come if you don't listen to the word if you don't hear the word you have a rough time getting to this feat we are talking about because faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God feet also come by experience you go to an experience it gives you a greater trust and confidence in God and it grows your feet so that means faith can grow faith in itself doesn't remain static feet can grow feet can ripen feet can mature how is your feet tonight so let me read verse 3 again knowing this that the shrine of your faith with patience but let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanted nothing I may know the prophets that patience is perfection it is written on God unwitten for God and this is the process of character development nor we know as parents we may have struggles or family may be poor and we suffered under someone and we struggle and everything else right and we tell ourselves when we have our own families when we have on our own children we don't want them to be like that so when we get our children and we come into our own we find ourselves blocking covering pampering and making cushions and pillows and feathers and fluffy stuff for our own kids and and to see them sometimes to raise up as a Rascals because they just have it too easy God don't ever treat his children like that they say every son somebody every son that cometh to God must be so when you see somebody trial proof for no trials I'm testing on the skin and teeth and everything else right true you know something wrong with that dude every son cometh to God must be trying so God has no spoil children let's continue let patience of a perfect world that you may be perfect an entire wanted nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that give it to all men liberally and upgrade it not and it shall be given to him so watch your luck he asks for but how do you ask those six Expressions done but let him ask in fit not even like a wave of the sea you travel with the Wind on Earth let not that man think he shall receive anything of the Lord double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so I just want to take a peek at that in the Amplified from those three be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your feet bring out endurance and steadfastness many people see they believe but do they really believe and you know as I you hear me say it before that you talk about unbeliever make believe and True Believer on all three are in the church I always wonder about the first one the unbelievable part How could somebody be a unbelievable but it is true these unbelievers claim to believe but they don't really believe because they are not connected with they come like a false people Falls here whatever it is it's not connected to the real head or Tito mouth or Draw it's just something else too and they Pro have a profession because a real seed is proven so it's not somebody claim I believe I'm a Believer yes but the only way you could get proof of that faith is when test and trial comes under it and then your feet is proven when it stands out so what understand that the trial and the pruning of your feet brings out endurance and steadfastness and patience but let endurance and steadfastness and patients have full play and do a thorough work it's not you may be perfectly and fully developed with no defects lacking I'm going to close off adapter okay so this is the object of patience that God speak to Abraham and God put 25 years on the promise that he spoke to Abraham and Abram had to wait you have to wait after 10 years you have to wait 15 years he still written 20 years he still with the Yap of wheat until God came and the Bible uses words until Abraham came into the fullness of believing so you could see Abram could have had a level of subconscious unbelief the heart was to be big thought worked out etched out but the Bible in testifying of his faith says he started not at the promise of God to unbelief but was wrong given faith and praise and glory to God in other words fate genuine feet Praises God because feet is already the substance of what is promised you already have the thing before you get the real thing you have something that God put in your spirit in your soul so you'll hear me saying something that I will never allow any man any human being to stop between me and what God put in feet in my soul to believe what he promised so you know there's some people who have taught your dream canceling a vision if they could and null your feet if they could do like it doesn't exist if they could but you see when God perfect in your soul it's not man but that dear it's God put that here God put feet in your soul to believe him regardless so it doesn't matter if the church falls down if the pastor is removed if if the whole spit up into 16 parts that feeds citizens father you because you are son and God put that seed inside of you before the foundation of the world to receive this end time with a message to make you an elect of this last day I had just grateful to God for where we are in Trinidad where we are in Christ where we are in God's plan and program we are part of God's plan and program he said out of many Nation towns and people you have equal other people so we are privileged to be part of this call on bunch okay all right let's continue praise the Lord so this this is a little different tonight I know it's not Bible Study Bible study but we want to share this tonight with you and trusting that you get some strength and and effectively so I want to kind of drop back a bit he's talking about Temperance right and in sharing this part because we want to go from some principation especially here something he shared on patients but we want to just take our time and get from temperance and you would see how detailed this is it's not a game it's not like um you know like just saying words that are Temperance you say oh my we have come to Temperance no you have faith first you have to have to begin with then you add virtue to your feet if it's the right kind of virtue notice words then you add knowledge if is the right kind of knowledge now you're gonna add Temperance now Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance you see how God break it down not Temperance human temper this is Bible temporary this is Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the loss of the flesh or we're talking about Holy Spirit temperance that means here we go are you ready how to control your tongue Oh you mean the controller return is not automatic we don't have a remote you're not even multiple integration take it off no it's it's how to control your tongue not be a tackler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks growth to you later you mean people can speak close to you or speak close to me and then we have to react with this thing called Temperance and manage what's supposed to come out of us copyright he said oh my God a lot of us is going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church when Miracles and things that they used to do yes sir he is connected temperance these virtues with Miracles and things that God used to do you see a lot of us going to fall off before we get started hungry then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles are the things that they used to yes sir are these things are Temperance did oh Temperance here we go how to answer in the kindness when rot is spoke to you so it's not a matter of it cause me to accustomed back or he constant against sex I will stick my mind no no no no no no no it is not you speak in your mind or speaking your flesh or speaking your operation temperance how the answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody say you punch your Holy Rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeve no not that but talk with Godly love temperance kindness is that the way you want to be the conversion say Amen when you are riled upon while not back let him be your example there are some people you could hardly tell them something the thief and all you know the works you know they're angry because yeah you're mad you're hungry you're back you can fight about soul as you as your human Spirit are you afraid that's not Jesus okay see let him be your exam when they said if don't be the Son of God Too Many Stones The Bread he could have done it but surely was God but he had temperance when they call him he said I forgive you for it they put handfuls of they pulled handfuls of beard out of his face it splits in his face he said come down the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing he had a gift he knew all things for him was the fullness of The Godly they had seen him perform Miracle by telling people what was wrong with them and so forth like that they put a rag around his head around his eyes hit him and said prophesy tell us who hate you we believe you see he had temperance now if you have got it like that add it to your feet so he's actually qualifying the vacuums to be added I don't think I've ever said that before I didn't have the first time I've come up he's actually qualifying the virtues to be added so it is not your imagination is not what you think is not what you feel is the virtues that is qualified oh my God no wonder he says a lived voice it's a qualified Thunder that's the problem that shake the devil it is something that actually has been lived out now being added Oh Glory my god father help me something has been lived out no bill added to you when it's like that you say add it to your feet if you got it like that add it to your faith if you if you still blow up and fast and Fast and stew and Carry On You Can't add that cause it won't add it won't vulcanize and these words are so important it is tremendous because now many years it would vulcanite he's actually bringing now a blending in to effectively add now you can vulcanize piece of wood and rubber it won't work so you have to have the right material written synchronized and vulcanized means it's so connected you can't break it so virtue the right claim who vulcanize the feet I'll be seen as a night knowledge vulcanized the virtue are you seeing it tonight so the right kind is what will vulcanize so each one has to be the right kind in order to vulcanize and this is what could make up this View that is going to go in the rapture that the being is a servant of God in the Church of God that is going in the Rapture or could we give him some Praises tonight we believe that tonight oh praise the Lord okay so let's get sent to you right he says now you can't add that it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is and when your feet here we go and your temperance become the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you have annotated when your virtue is like his virtue then it'll be added to it when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to you I will of God see with the father's word he defeated every devil heaven will pass away but the word will not see when you have that kind of knowledge it will recognize yourself so I'm seeing these things true it is not something right it is not something like this is not mysterious enough this is already not talking about death tonight well I don't know what that what if you're talking about because I'm talking about that that is too deep for me but I'm seeing that Behind These virtues it's not just numbers names and the two changes and you know like a point of reference it is actually something to be tested try approval and slaughtered into you that will be vulcanized with the rest and I want you to see the importance of you humanly into your own life to strive like we said how many will touch it I pledge I will pray daily until all these features be in this country of mind thank you and you have got the right temperance like he had it was vulcanized if you haven't just a man we man me have free script of belief or Temperance I would have shut them down but maybe I better not because they might put my name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about to try to add that it won't work but when you can really put the sweetness from your heart forgive every man call your peace let it be gone and then and vulcanize you can add that to your feed I remember talking to a brother and his family how he managers family and stuff there was some challenges there I told him I said listen you can't kill a cockroach hammer it makes no sense as he has to pick your fight you cannot be picky picky at every little issue every everything you're roaring like a lion I said what about when this serious issue come you're crying for Aunt you're crying after a flea a fly and you're making a racket over something else and you haven't seen anything greeted you haven't seen real challenges yet so I'd like to encouragement I say you have to learn to pick your fights you have to know is it worth it sometimes Believers some of the quarrels or some of the issues we find ourselves is it isn't wood walk to even respond even if you know you are right just walk you don't want to talk just walk all your peace steal your tongue that will be able to say Mark the perfect man he can Bridle his tongue watch a perfect man a man who not there at all without Perfection oh he could he could say a lot all right okay no wonder the church is so short isn't that right no wonder I say repent and be baptized the Bible said in the name of Jesus Christ and strict truth or Tyrion don't believe that okay now then after that fourthly you hear the part you want to get to but we know again after that fourthly you want to add patience to your faith now if you've got feet it will get patients the Bible said see so this is patience now that's the next thing is going to build this statue you know God has got real material in this building so now he is pleasing these virtues as material building blocks what you had it is actually a material you see how short we are bread Brothers he says you see where we are at yes sir see we have Glory we have short-term things because we got faith when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that statue so now watch this rain fell on the Pentecostal 1906. what did they produce their signs wonders tongues Miracles welcome and Supernatural manifestation and that was just a level of faith they couldn't add because they couldn't receive the word because the word comes to the prophet and they rejected the prophet so they stay stuck at that level of the Pentecostal experience fire power presence but not the life added because brother Branham brought the fullness of the word by the revealing of this phenomenon every mystery every seal he brought back and restored the person of Christ the person of Jesus Christ and this person is what you have to receive this person of Jesus Christ so then when he says no you see how short we are Brethren yes sir we have shouts and things because we got feed shroud and things because we are fed but when we come down to these things here God can build us into that subject what is he talking he's actually talking to build us into one Pentecostal will not adopt him they remain as beats in other words abduction age was released when God released that prophet he actually beaten the abduction age or Robert's the Legrand and a whole host about our great men they were all loosed on the fields but only one man was adopted which was William because he went through this whole story here of being tested he lost his wife he knows his daughter he said the Lord Give the Lord take it away before he said that the devil came speaking to him tell him look at you you're preaching the gospel you're serving the lord you're praying for the sick people and whatnot you say God wouldn't even answer your prayer look at your wife dying your baby daughter dying and he's listening he's listening he's listening now what he's two years resting there the humanistic realm air and the realm of the air fit that is listening he's listening there are bad things going on inside of him the Battle of will owns the Battle of hearing voices a voice saying look at you he you know you're gonna your daughter going to die your wife's going to die and something is hearing all of a sudden you know what when the feet feel inside of him when he out of his mouth come the Lord give the lord taketh as we to dig away bless the beginning of the Lord and in him expressing that you could see the fathers please my son you didn't write him he's got the mature you get them at your home because of what he's going through sometimes we ball like a cowards we would see in the look of expression we carry her on because we're going through stuff and you're going to stuff to mature you to get the foolishness out of us go trying to get you through your dullness is slugishness your laziness and your trials does that the custom does that and you come and get a word tonight you have need of patience don't Cast Away confidence wait be patient with God be patient with your wife be patient with your husband be patient with your child you want a child move up so fast you want your husband this way you want your wife that way be patient which man could add one cubic teeth tattoo by giving a thought if we could think ourselves to be fine to the Moon we fly to the moon is when we think that we do it we fight to the Moon we go we want to we go do we want to do we caught by our own thinking not where we think we want again we could think both I want to do that and positive thinking that kind of drama but the reality is this we have to have patience and patience means waiting on God and waiting for God not waiting for your uncle or your aunt or you're waiting for the church that you shall do it and then therefore like why how you are and then that way you're going through and the Brethren and whoever choose to have love and who do have love and what kind of thing and looking for love yeah I love your own self God love you and the main thing you have to know that's the main thing I understand but I brought you a lovers about you love me well love and well loved you're looking for love looking for love God love is expressed by him releasing his son his son forces I need each one of us receive that son the person of Jesus Christ you see there will be no forces there'll be no arguments we still believe different things but that love is not going to be emanate from us okay let's see how we could just hit the home shot here he can't okay let me read something about to get the context he says now we have Glory I've shown things because we got faith right but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that statue see he cannot he cannot make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things before and slide off with it church and there's some brother I can't remember which state he was from other Vision some years ago body pyramid and people were climbing up and you know the pyramid is brought at the bottom so you get a ton of people there and they climb up they get less and less and less and as The Godfather people will actually sign off sliding off the payment and it's symbolic of not really fully adding to go further because to add you adding virtue and virtue platform is to get into knowledge another platform it's taken to the temperance Temperance platform if they get to the big specialist but form is taken to the godliness godliness platforms that should be good with kindness where the kindness gets you to the presence of the king the object is to get into the presence of the king because that is where the Run of authority and power that's where the adoptionist act when you get to the top step the top of the step when you enter into the presence of the king like Esther what is this you want me to do for you I'll give you up to half my kingdom okay so what you think with this all things we got all these other things we fall and slide off with it we can't build his church it's powerful here these words the prophecy Park Village Church because he said Upon This Rock Faith Revelation Rock I will build my church so the Church of Jesus is not billions it's not Tabernacles and this Fellowship it's not that is Church's building is really based upon that rock Faith revolution of who he is so that fate was really The Anchor Point that other things supposed to go on top of it like virtue and knowledge and so on like that right you want to repeat it myself patience with what what kind of patience the first thing the first thing of the second or third the first thing is having patience with God and then he made a statement and I don't want you to figure this to me if it's one thing I don't want you to forget is this one if you have got real genuine feet you will have real genuine patience because faint Wicked patience so if I do like wiring like electrical wiring there's a wire connected from feet straight to patients so you cannot tell me you are fit and your poor patients so God I can't start with you we can do longer fed up a ticket moment no you can't talk like that all right if you are genuinely one you'll have genuine patience and you could see whether statement is booted from descriptions because faith will get patience and when God sees anything you believe it that's all you got patience well I asked him to heal me I asked him last night to heal me and I'm Justified sick this morning oh my what patience then he said what to eat around 25 years later there still wasn't even one sign it was still believing he was patient with God so some Minister brethren they find it too long now so you look like if you go there fulfill his promise and they started following stuff all of a sudden this seed adopted and because they see so that is Imagination that is not this is my beloved Son God has said that this tell them to themselves so okay put him all before you let him be the next cross and say you can't cross him so keep him before you he said so it's going to happen keep him before you that's right so you see how we come and we preach and say there's one of these fines they're gonna be wonderful stick will be here by and see we are seeing that because we are pumping we believe it that could happen someday that could happen today and otherwise right now the Holy Spirit could come and baptize you right in your home right in your house God could do something special for you on Wednesday 19th welcome something special for you in your home you have to be a team you could be praying all of a sudden God come and visit you send on your representation in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Friday prayer go to come and visit you in your own you have to have expectations you have to create an atmosphere if there's no atmosphere of healing how are we going to expect healing whether it's to happen but I'm talking about is there a business in the church attitude of the church he said this Spirit can't even reveal so that means yes this is awful that means he could be speaking words but there's no Revelation coming to the people because the the atmosphere screwed up and the utmost one messed up the spirit of review so let's say for instance you are here tonight you are backstory right and you're trying yourself like thinking you're unworthy and whatnot and the cause of the atmosphere that is here tonight despair revealed to you that God mostly has extended to you right and God's grace coming to you and you're right in your home right in your own quickly in your own Corner you're getting inspiration Revelation it means the spirit is operational my words is not just my words is if if there's a words coming from the Lord I'm good and God's inspiring then the same God that speak they could reveal it because what we need is revelation it's not words the church is built on the church is built upon revelation we need revelation we need to ask what Revolution I don't know how much of you and how many people ask God God reveal yourself I remember I mentioned before say God I don't know who you are or 16 years old say Lord could you reveal yourself to me this year and he did 1975 is when I get baptized I asked God for to reveal himself to me because I don't know you and you have to begin to ask God to Revelation not see I go to church not see you know that I believe the message no you want divine revelation and Revelation is what tell me somebody relation is definitely i t h Revelation is fit so the more Revelation you get is the more faith you're supposed to have the more faith you're supposed to grow and as the more fatal foreign then there we go God tries your patience that's right God tries them so after you told no no I want you to go ahead and get in the app I'm going to run the animals in there I want you to get in time up upstairs so you can look out to the top window now when you get there I want you to tell the people tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years going to take place all right go down and you know what you know this story it didn't mean but notice of it first day second day to the Norwegian when we start to fall people now getting inspirational community don't let God shut the door you can't come and if God shall come down what for God open to me and construct and God has opened my door for you here tonight to attempt to get out your bathroom condition to get closer to God I don't care what you're in God wouldn't tell you still as you are still where you are is come up okay let's continue now we find God coming this far waiting for the church but it will be dear don't you worry you promised it he waited all this time for the resurrection there will be one don't worry God promised it just read patiently you fall asleep you won't you might have taken a nap before it happens but you pick up at that time he promised it see what we call a number of death you know we call it no such thing as dying in Christ life and death don't exist together we just take a nap a nap that our friends call us praise God from the one who call us he can call us and around for him Joe has been sleeping now for 4 000 years don't worry he'll wake up don't worry he is still waiting and you are waiting before they passed no rain and all right is gonna happen I can hear Mrs know what come around said Dad don't talk like that he had patience because he had Faith yes sir he had virtue he had the knowledge that God was right he had Temperance he didn't fly loose but I don't know what is all what is all about I I lost my popularity no people don't care for me no more I'll go there and start calling you again no you're patience God promises God will do it God will do it praise God hallelujah what's something I can see his son and and Daddy but but it could be possible that you could have been a little bit wrong oh no no no why God said so but Daddy this is six days that we sit here sitting here in this big old Baya sitting right here it's all pitch inside and out and we all been here these years below it you study and preach till you would turn grand ball and here you are you know trying to say something and the people are laughing and throwing Rotten Tomatoes and things on the side of it and Noah telling us and be patient son are you sure it will rain his daughter-in-law said father you know he said it will rain but we have been here all these years waiting we have been preparing and you told us it's going to rain a week ago and we are still in here and the doors are all shut and we are here walking around in here and the Sun is squatting right down like this but he will dream how do you know keywords God said so now when you get that way at it or give the Lord a praise tonight oh give the Lord some Praises tonight when it gets that way where you can tell your friends your family your loved one contact your God Church you're not watching my guys you're not feet you're the whom your senses you actually challenge in your senses because fear is a revelation what your sins can declare faith is something that your senses cannot declare so when it when when Elijah tool is servant go up and look and tell me what you see TC and he doesn't see nothing if I just say go sometimes yeah in other words keep going until they see something because I'm in the season where the supernatural have to break I don't mean the season where something has to be seen I'm in the season where something got to happen we got country after all these years and there's a promise we tell them seven Thunders after the voices to that group I could take the word during a special season you can't tell me there's nothing you have to be you know something had to be wrong with you you have to keep going again exercise yourself go until they get a report and then that's even come back and say I see a cloud that's impossible foreign let's see if we could wrap up here by God's grace okay I hope it it didn't blessed tonight now when you get it that way at it if you're in Godzilla that way don't try to add the own book it could work on healing it will work on nothing else he's got a blending with the same materialized material it is vulcanized to then patients okay most of that patients with God Moses have Credit Karma people a little contrast here between him and God God showed him his glory he said when you see the glory and you see he had Faith what's that in my hand and we know the story and so on like that right okay so I'm just gonna skip down when he got in the wilderness it was 40 miles from where he crossed there right across there the cross again Moses the Wilderness with her 40 years patience and we should have patience with one another could we give a lot of hand on that patience with one another oh God their brother boy I tell him I tell him you're listening I'm patience our patients we get so much impatient with one another we think we've got to be like Moses Moses have patience with the people look what caused him not to go over if you are trying to do something like I have tried to get this message over at the Tabernacle to see that each member of the Tabernacle becomes this it is hard to do I try to have patience this is 33 years of patients women still popular here this is what I'm talking about still just a few but just have patience see just have patience wait have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience even one time when that Rebellion bunch of people are impatient they cause Moses to do something was wrong but yet when it comes to our Showdown God got sick of the action he said separate yourself Moses I'll kill the whole bunch of them starting you he thrown himself in the bridge and said God don't do it what patience with the people that was rebelling against it is that right what I'm really there tonight locations with the people that was Rebellion against him I wonder if we could do that and I was thinking is a title a message or something I wonder if we could imagine I wonder if we could do that if you can't don't try to build on this you know that's the way the first one was falconized into this he said no Hebrews children had patience our God is evil but nevertheless we are not good about that image patients knowing this that who want to raise them up in the last days dislike your means so much what would raise it up in the last days when it comes about an image we won't do it we will give Caesar what a Caesar but when it comes to Caesar interfere with God God said don't you go to that image I won't do it God is able to deliver us and we know the story as we wrap up praise the name of the Lord praising yourself patience is what will help you of being upset from something somebody want to warn you patience work with me sometimes you have to say you know what they see that but it didn't mean so in order to get your protection you have to have patience because when somebody treats you badly I see something to hurt you or wound you and you respond it just goes to show that you're not there yet we have to come to that maturity and this comes like a piece of your model this thing called patience because you are being patient with that person you are being patient when God and you have your patience with yourself so even though right now tonight as we close you're not where you want to be you know you're not what you used to be but you're not even going to get to you because you will have patience with God and patients with your own selves because I'm with your brethren let's buy it almighty God I I was so blessed to come tonight and share distinguisher people because not a weird confidence Lord don't speak to their hearts Lord I come here tonight that there are those here just need some encouragement and they won't pull back that they wouldn't draw back they wouldn't shrink into their own world where all these years by bit step by step maybe they haven't hit the promised land yet but you brought them out thus far there's a song that says I I don't feel no retired I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me Lord and I don't believe it brought us to leave us I believe that this here is on the end of you this here is is what you want believe that that you want this out to your people that they have need of patience patience with God patients with the minister the pastor patients with patients with each other gorgeous like our children everyone is different and we often take Lord care as to what we say to each one because each one is different and you have children from different callings different levels he says some Africa Faith some are strong feet some of bulldog feet even said to your Prophet as the third police for those with a weaker faith that they could just speak and see it materialize their doors have been bullied off fruitful just to live and they leave you and see it happen called not everybody at the same level but every one of your children have faith free to trust you and to believe you it might be a challenge in our circumstance in our condition to have confidence I think people walk away from the message walk completely out they do something completely different work packages some church age backwards stuff here we are we are challenged to believe the message itself but the church in the last days will be a super church because super reads auctioneers they had to but to get to the Hedge tool is a process we quoted many times super Church super race as she nears The Headstone they get to the headstones his feet and virtue Falcon Heights knowledge Falcon lights temporary Falcon lights patience vulcanized God is vulcanized better with kindness Vulcanizing then we enter nearing The Headstone where the power of God begin to flow sons of God virtue fluent free just like when a woman of Jesus and virtue flew out of his body he said who touched me who touched my clothes I felt hurt you left me that same future will be the body of Christ in the last days father may not virtue go tonight into every home every heart every person he understood and I vote you going to them if they are sick here if they are vaccine restore them if they are unsaved and they're hearing tonight then you see them if they are born and their hearing it at night May you deliver them anyone I would hear father called me of Freedom may they understand that God is real your word is true and the word the Bible is caught in print it's the word of God still it's the word and when we speak tonight it becomes a Living Word foreign [Music] thank you so much for being here tonight I trust them that this was something special to you edifying to you that's not away your confidence I'm not talking about confidence in yourself or self-confidence I'm talking about your confidence in God who made a promise may the Lord bless you Praise You Lord
