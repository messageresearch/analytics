[9:13] God's Bible isn't that right and if you
[9:17] want to match something much experience
[9:20] against Paul's that's what we need is a
[9:22] match in time but Paul's faith in the
[9:25] Bible that's an example right real match
[9:28] in time don't try to match enable match

[10:38] that flesh come from the dust and that
[10:41] does go right back to the dust but at
[10:43] Jean and not your soul that come from
[10:45] God
[10:45] isn't that right o blessed be the name
[10:49] of the Lord so I'm excited this morning
[10:50] I talked about for last week's service I
[10:53] really thoroughly enjoy that about being
[10:56] focus going back past giggle and Bethel
[11:00] and Jericho and pressing your way to
[11:03] that purpose in God for your life and
[11:05] something ought to call you the press
[11:07] and masterfully Balaram says a person
[11:09] can't get desperate and cold until God
[11:11] speaks to them and you come here for God
[11:14] to speak to you
[11:15] amens a lot of stand as we want to go
[11:17] into the word want to turn to 2nd Kings
[11:19] chapter 2 wanna read from verse 6 to eat
[11:23] Joshua chapter 1 wanna read verse 1 2 3
[11:27] and 3 6 I wanna read Matthew chapter 4
[11:31] verse 1 and verse 14 so that's cool to
[11:39] second Kings to 6
[11:45] and Elijah said unto him took tokens
[11:47] begin the Elijah Terry I pray thee here
[11:50] for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and
[11:53] he said as the Lord liveth and as I so
[11:57] live it I will not leave thee and the
[12:01] two went on and fifty of the sons of the
[12:05] prophets went and stood to view a foul
[12:07] and a two stood by Jordan and Elijah
[12:14] took his mantle and wrapped it together
[12:16] and smooth the waters and they were
[12:18] divided hither and thither surah d2 went
[12:22] over on dry ground Joshua chapter one
[12:27] now after the death of Moses the servant
[12:30] of the Lord came to pass that the Lord
[12:32] speak unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[12:35] the minister seen Moses my servant is
[12:38] dead now therefore arise go over this
[12:42] Jordan and DA and all these people unto
[12:46] the land which I do give unto them even
[12:50] to the Journal of Israel every place
[12:53] that the sole of your foot shall tread
[12:55] upon that have I given unto you as I
[12:58] said unto Moses verse 6 be strong of a
[13:02] good courage for on to dis people shall
[13:06] doubt divide foreign inheritance the
[13:09] land which I swear on to their fathers
[13:11] to give them let's look at Matthew
[13:14] chapter 4 read in verse 1 then we go to
[13:19] verse 14 then was Jesus led up of the
[13:24] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[13:28] of the devil verse 14
[13:47] okay
[13:57] okay
[14:10] oh praise the Lord okay sorry
[14:18] it's supposed to be Luke actually Luke
[14:20] chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 14 I'm sorry
[14:26] Luke chapter 1 and Jesus being Luke
[14:29] chapter 4 verse 1 and Jesus being full
[14:32] of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan
[14:34] and was led by the spirit into the
[14:37] wilderness verse 14 and Jesus returned
[14:40] in the power of the Spirit unto Galilee
[14:42] and they went out a Fame of him wrong
[14:45] about throughout all the regions wrong
[14:48] about let us pray father we thank you
[14:50] for your word and we pray your calm down
[14:52] and especially and speak to our hearts
[14:53] in Jesus name I ask it amen and he made
[14:56] you may be seated
[14:57] oh praise the Lord
[15:05] so I guess I was looking at those two
[15:07] scriptures what does them have it better
[15:09] I wanted to get that one and somehow and
[15:11] the patina Matthew amen
[15:15] I have a title this morning let us cross
[15:19] Jordan to an open vision of another
[15:24] Ephesians
[15:27] let us cross Jordan to an open vision of
[15:31] another Ephesians and have an
[15:35] inspiration before the bride returns in
[15:39] power that is what my inspiration is
[15:42] before the bride returns in power now I
[15:45] want you to turn your Bibles to first
[15:48] John chapter 2 I want you to follow me
[15:50] with this context scripture reading from
[15:52] verse 15 to 16 first John chapter 2
[15:56] reading from verse 15 to 16 and John is
[16:04] right after Peter
[16:08] we was 15 cents love not the world
[16:12] neither the things that are in the world
[16:16] If any man love the world the love of
[16:20] the father is not in him for all that is
[16:25] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[16:28] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[16:32] is not of the Father but is of the world
[16:36] and the world passeth away and the lust
[16:40] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[16:44] God abideth for ever I want to read that
[16:48] one again for all the 16 for all that is
[16:52] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[16:57] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[17:00] is not of the Father but is of the world
[17:04] may God bless his word and praise God
[17:07] blessed be the name of the Lord and this
[17:11] is brother Branham from God called man
[17:13] he was saying before prayer I would like
[17:17] to ask this question to people inside
[17:19] out how many in here sincerely would
[17:21] like to go with Jesus down to Jordan
[17:24] tonight and dear cross over there
[17:27] where you could see a vision and see
[17:30] what God really means would you raise
[17:32] your hands god bless you go down to
[17:35] Jordan not down to a seminary Elijah
[17:38] pass right by that tyree here I don't
[17:40] want to that's man-made it's never
[17:42] quenched that taste of a man who is
[17:45] testing for God a seminary or
[17:49] information can never quench that tooth
[17:52] that a man have for God he says what we
[17:55] need you can get men all to themselves
[17:58] away from their school of theology are
[18:00] we from their self-styled ways fearless
[18:02] men men of character with you who
[18:04] believes you and take you at your word
[18:07] and he's praying God many of them
[18:09] standing here present that will give all
[18:11] they got to the Lord Jesus and sello the
[18:13] world go pass Giga the place of
[18:15] confession and Christian beginnings go
[18:17] pass
[18:18] school of the prophets not set back
[18:20] there with theology and go to Jordan to
[18:22] an open vision and when the cross and
[18:25] find that God still lives do you believe
[18:29] that oh praise the name of the Lord
[18:32] blessed be the name of the Lord
[18:34] but the trouble today is that ministers
[18:37] very few ministers are trying to
[18:39] establish Christ in the people's heart
[18:42] very few ministers is trying to do that
[18:46] they are trying to establish themselves
[18:48] their ministry who they are their idea
[18:52] their interpretation very few are
[18:56] establishing the Word of God isn't that
[18:59] right because Eve had a lust that loss
[19:02] was foreknowledge is not right and but a
[19:05] banna me spoke about that isn't that
[19:06] right it was wrong for her to do that
[19:08] and we finally what happened there isn't
[19:10] that right and the ministers today
[19:12] supposed to be established in Christ in
[19:15] the people's heart not the church not
[19:18] their ministries not their ideas but
[19:21] Christ and crisis the world
[19:23] so once the word is preached without
[19:25] being flavored and have an
[19:27] interpretation to it you are getting
[19:28] Christ the word because in the beginning
[19:31] was the word the Word was with God and
[19:33] the Word was God
[19:35] isn't that something else so Jesus
[19:37] Christ
[19:38] isn't that right when he was 12 years
[19:40] old he knew he was about the father's
[19:43] business he was in the channel of the
[19:46] will of God he was a son 12 years old no
[19:49] you know I must be about my father's
[19:51] business it take him 18 years to ripen
[19:55] that comment the position to be
[19:58] positionally place by the pillar of fire
[20:00] by charity at the Jordan River could
[20:03] somebody see a man is not right so
[20:07] during those years of silence he was an
[20:09] idol he was doing something he was in
[20:11] the world we attend to fulfill the word
[20:15] Juno's eight years of silence Jesus was
[20:18] getting a revelation of what the father
[20:21] has to work for his life Oh glory to God
[20:25] in many many many men glory to God they
[20:29] come back if it will faker Ison you want
[20:31] to get the lengthen drive a car leash 18
[20:33] or whatever and you want it you have to
[20:34] get the information first how you go up
[20:37] or get them man you're getting your
[20:38] documents it gets in your ID card and so
[20:41] on and then you have to find out you
[20:42] have a booklet of the regulations that
[20:44] you have to pass you have to get a deed
[20:46] set but you're not a driver yet did not
[20:49] approve yet did not confirm yet when you
[20:52] get your learner's know you get to go
[20:54] and get you test drive and so on but
[20:55] you're not the proof yet yes there's a
[20:57] pass a test in the yaw to see if we can
[21:00] reverse well under your three-point turn
[21:02] and then if you don't pass there you
[21:04] can't even go out so you've got to pass
[21:06] the first test before you go out in the
[21:08] road because you have a weapon call a
[21:10] car and the car lose you just like that
[21:13] and you kind of drive so they have to
[21:15] test you first and when you pass the
[21:17] inside test you're going for the outside
[21:19] test and then you get approved but
[21:22] that's what we're talking about you
[21:24] could sit and study home to drive
[21:26] what kind of have to drive if you don't
[21:30] go and pass to the process you are not
[21:32] writing to drive because somebody say
[21:35] man you can preach how nice driving is
[21:38] you can explain how to do it but until
[21:41] you go and do it then do it yet so
[21:44] before you come back in power there is
[21:46] something has to take place before this
[21:49] super church and super race and purple
[21:52] and spoken word and doing this and doing
[21:55] that I when the press come down wants to
[21:57] tell them before all of that
[22:00] or get the Lord a shelter before all of
[22:03] that
[22:04] [Applause]
[22:08] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just
[22:12] before all of that we want to get down
[22:14] to that this morning oh praise God amen
[22:17] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah
[22:23] originally in Genesis the instructions
[22:28] was for man to have dominion over the
[22:30] fish beasts birds what spirit man
[22:35] Genesis - there was no - of the soil but
[22:38] that real man
[22:40] Remis always a real man real man was no
[22:43] flash man real man was spirit man and
[22:45] God word real man into freshman man
[22:49] became a living soul but the original
[22:51] real man was spirit man spirit was
[22:55] leading man no we are man leading but it
[22:58] was very pleasing man now we are flesh
[23:01] leading or give the Lord a shoulder
[23:04] press
[23:08] so if let me see that if we're gonna
[23:12] come back to Genesis if we're gonna come
[23:14] back to original we have to get back to
[23:17] where the split leads man Jesus was led
[23:22] by the spirit come on out come on out
[23:27] where he was going in the spirit Oh
[23:30] hallelujah he was going to power but yet
[23:34] I brought the pass
[23:36] [Applause]
[23:39] alleluiah he was led by the spirit into
[23:42] the wilderness
[23:48] so Jesus come on you have to demonstrate
[23:53] he had power over himself before his
[24:01] ministry could take off because he put
[24:04] any final gear to let that engine Rumble
[24:07] through before that car took off he
[24:12] added us to demonstrate he had power
[24:15] over himself because John described all
[24:20] that is in the world all that is in the
[24:26] world is either under lust of the eyes
[24:29] it's either on the lusts of the flesh
[24:33] or it's under the pride of life every
[24:37] sin every wickedness every evil is under
[24:40] one of that I'm not hearing you this
[24:44] morning
[24:44] I'm not hearing you this morning every
[24:48] issue be a government their kingdoms be
[24:52] it family their neighbors being on the
[24:55] job is one of them
[24:57] [Applause]
[25:00] most of the ass lust of the flesh and
[25:04] the pride of life
[25:09] Oh hallelujah somebody said break it
[25:12] down like that hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[25:15] glory to God thank you Jesus proverbs 6
[25:30] 1619 these six things that God heap yeah
[25:38] seven are an abomination to him number
[25:44] one a proud look here said pride alone
[25:50] because we could see pride you see
[25:53] somebody can walk with pride and people
[25:55] don't know that's on the inside because
[25:58] they can walk with a head door and the
[25:59] proud but God hid
[26:04] a proud look that has to do with the
[26:08] pride of life that have to do with you
[26:10] feeling superior to others
[26:13] and you seen others inferior to you come

[31:14] of sita jesus answered him saying it is
[31:20] written that man shall not live by bread
[31:22] alone but by every word of God he
[31:26] overcame the lust of the flesh by the
[31:28] word
[31:30] he is gaining dominion over himself that
[31:37] that cannot be enslaved the hip and
[31:41] sleeve him watch Dever take him up to a

[34:14] said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy
[34:16] God and when the devil was ended all the

[35:14] control and dominion over his human
[35:17] spirit by overcoming the lust of the
[35:20] ants by overcoming Ellis of the flesh by
[35:23] overcoming the pride of life isn't that
[35:25] right and before adopted son can have

[1:12:51] demon of the lust for money is austere
[1:12:54] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and
[1:12:56] the pride of life that spirit didn't
[1:13:01] want to do what it needs to take to get

[1:15:50] forgiveness is whether death is really
[1:15:51] act in this age that's why it's hell on

[1:44:42] Smyrna satisfied her and so forth of the
[1:44:44] loud easier but he has seen the devil

[1:44:49] imagine in Loudy say age there's gonna
[1:44:52] come a little Ephesus in other words I
[1:44:55] am Alpha and Omega and the processes in
[1:45:00] between what the early church had big on
[1:45:03] the half plus you know what I'm saying
[1:45:08] we don't want nothing less
[1:45:12] we don't want to be a Pentecostal Church

[1:45:21] Alpha Church Omega church the authority
[1:45:25] Peter had Muslim back
[1:45:27] [Applause]
[1:45:31] Paul Paul was the gold standard of
[1:45:34] messengers wherever I'm got the other
[1:45:36] messengers my measure them against Paul
[1:45:37] that's why when the voice tell him he
[1:45:39] said will poor be judged they say you
[1:45:41] ought to be judged he said was Paul
[1:45:42] judged when he broke on to the other
[1:45:44] side do you say yes Paul Jordan you
[1:45:46] ought to be judged he said well I preach
[1:45:48] my part preach brother branham asks the
[1:45:52] right question was Paul judge yeah Paul
[1:45:54] was judge but I preached my Paul preach
[1:45:56] but I want to have the same testimony
[1:45:58] I appreciate what Paul preached my god
[1:46:03] is gonna be a holy was revival I will
[1:46:05] preach that till I die or get wrapped it
[1:46:08] in the sky
[1:46:10] halleluyah halleluyah there's gonna be a
[1:46:13] real revival
[1:46:15] Cory man what
[1:46:20] what if Gordon but maybe opportunity for
[1:46:22] Samson you may be seated what is
[1:46:23] something that our old man dead
[1:46:27] tombstone day that just died old and
[1:46:31] then somebody raised up a book but
[1:46:35] Samson used to be the history of Samson
[1:46:38] and all what God used him for yeah
[1:46:40] that might sound real nice but God
[1:46:42] didn't finish Samson story so Samson was
[1:46:44] dead no or dead later I chosen dead know
[1:46:49] but before I first do this dead thing I
[1:46:52] want to do courting I want to fulfill
[1:46:55] the will that was raised afore which is
[1:46:59] to destroy the Philistines so in the
[1:47:02] human spirit human when the taught was
[1:47:04] entertainment time yeah when they put on
[1:47:07] the entertainment channel and they said
[1:47:09] bring on Samson he is the moon movie
[1:47:11] coming out no entertainment vision or
[1:47:14] station or something so and they bring
[1:47:15] on Samson Samson wasn't in that mood
[1:47:17] with him Samson a different vision
[1:47:20] altogether without eyes he was seeing
[1:47:25] did you hear that it happy people who
[1:47:28] are eyes and they can't see because you
[1:47:31] don't see with your eyes they ready see
[1:47:32] with your heart
[1:47:33] Sampson saw God get an honor and glory
[1:47:36] Sampson saw the restoration of the glory
[1:47:40] of God black among pots where he was
[1:47:46] where he failed he was gonna do so much
[1:47:48] honor go bring honor and glory to God
[1:47:50] you may be seated so Samson Samson
[1:47:53] coming out and they started in the
[1:47:54] Tina's headed club yeah yeah Samson and
[1:47:56] Nicholas are foolishness some snidely
[1:47:58] fella lead me to the post
[1:48:00] what if Samson was arrogant what is on
[1:48:03] the pride of life I wonder little boy
[1:48:04] leave me I know under touch man bought
[1:48:07] for myself
[1:48:10] then Samson walked by himself but it'll
[1:48:13] feel because yeah I want a little boy I
[1:48:14] need him I'm well hallelujah sandy paw
[1:48:16] and sparking up one Samson that's a key
[1:48:18] for learning wrong sounds get the coat
[1:48:24] where's that or the whole dog walker
[1:48:26] what story is that you have to be humble
[1:48:29] you have to really overcome Samson how
[1:48:33] to tell the little boy leave me come on
[1:48:35] now Jesus say you're young know your
[1:48:37] when you get old you would leave you get
[1:48:39] led where you don't want to go and I saw

[1:52:47] consists of the word to fight hell on
[1:52:50] the earth goddess and in love eternity
[1:52:54] that's why this code is here
[1:53:00] is a saying the buckler has resumed
[1:53:07] come on give the Lord a show we are not
[1:53:11] backing down we are not gonna battle the
[1:53:15] battle is on the baptists region this
[1:53:18] morning but somebody's already liver
[1:53:22] someone gonna be set free
[1:53:24] [Applause]
[1:53:37] all right you may be seated
[1:53:40] okay watch we are promised quantization
[1:53:44] 10 Malachi 4 lucemon Jersey that they're
[1:53:47] gonna come back Ephesian to this there's
[1:53:49] promise it friends there must come and
[1:53:53] Ephesians that these seven full missions
[1:53:57] of the word of God must be unfolded and
[1:53:59] it is an allowed east and asia sticks
[1:54:01] please
[1:54:01] and i believe we are right in the
[1:54:03] shadows of the common of the sun god
[1:54:05] there we go and as Joshua just before
[1:54:08] that Ephesians raised up so that John
[1:54:11] the Baptist raised up just before the
[1:54:13] next Ephesians and we are promised
[1:54:15] another Ephesians and it is predicted
[1:54:20] here in the scripture therefore I think
[1:54:22] we are living in the Ephesians again
[1:54:25] therefore we know that little couldn't
[1:54:29] get it west and so forth but in the last
[1:54:32] days we are given the understanding by
[1:54:34] the word that we are going to understand
[1:54:37] it because the real common Ephesians is
[1:54:39] to it and I believe he is just as evil
[1:54:43] this afternoon to cause in this building
[1:54:45] a paradox because he promised it would
[1:54:47] happen no piranhas seeing this under a
[1:54:50] message called paradox and it won't
[1:54:53] paradox means incredible but true I love
[1:54:58] that so in paradox
[1:55:01] he is prophesying of another Ephesians
[1:55:04] it's incredible but you in half he'll on
[1:55:08] the earth but they can be visions it
[1:55:11] have slackers on the earth but they're
[1:55:13] gonna be visions it have lukewarm and
[1:55:15] Mossback church members in the church
[1:55:17] but there's going to be another features
[1:55:19] it have back certain creatures but
[1:55:21] there's going to be another Ephesians
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:26] are you with me in other words when the
[1:55:30] devil eat the stump of the tree right
[1:55:32] now and course the I will restore the
[1:55:34] devil have no promise to return to
[1:55:36] something when course had to push up

[2:03:14] messenger Malachi for relish intense
[2:03:16] Emmys I want to do two things one a
[2:03:18] quarter Malachi for he will turn a half
[2:03:20] of a turn to the fathers to he'll reveal
[2:03:23] the mystery of the seven thunders in
[2:03:25] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[2:03:27] contained in the seven seals it will be
[2:03:30] DS divinely revealed mystery truths that
[2:03:34] will literally turn the hearts of the
[2:03:36] churun back to the Pentecostal fathers
[2:03:39] so in other words you ready come the
[2:03:41] river thunders and a tunnel to go till
[2:03:42] he has back to the faith and fathers
[2:03:44] isn't that right do you believe that
[2:03:46] hallelujah so then we go back to paradox
[2:03:49] I only know about Danny Henry I'm butter
[2:03:52] brown spoke some things and it came
[2:03:55] across in French I was interpreted and
[2:03:57] this was spoke to the Prophet because
[2:03:59] thou hast chosen the heart away the
[2:04:00] narrow path the heart away that was
[2:04:02] walked in your own choosing in other
[2:04:04] words I didn't have to do it I could
[2:04:06] cite and go with them if I want to but I
[2:04:08] stayed but what would the wood that was
[2:04:11] picked the correct precise decision it
[2:04:13] is my way watch the Hardaway God say
[2:04:16] he's choosing he choose the right thing
[2:04:19] Oh hallelujah that means he wasn't using
[2:04:21] with his eyes or his emotions or his
[2:04:23] feelings he choose the way of God oh
[2:04:25] that's why you have to overcome the lust
[2:04:27] of the eyes what didn't happen a lot
[2:04:29] when God told Abraham all this is yours

[2:12:01] they were both at Jordan I just love
[2:12:04] that statement one is going one looking
[2:12:07] for vision to do the will of God and the
[2:12:10] Pope that Jordan Oh hallelujah

[2:12:14] Lord had called me across Jordan
[2:12:19] hallelujah and the two went on or give
[2:12:22] the Lord some praises people oh my I
[2:12:29] want to close but I want to just can I
[2:12:31] wrap up here listen this suffer some say
[2:12:33] from other was it Moses listens brother
[2:12:35] Brown I think a minister today that's
[2:12:38] call of God to step into the tracks
[2:12:40] where Jesus should what a commission but
[2:12:43] each that's call of God is Commission to
[2:12:45] stand in the same place I'll be with you
[2:12:48] even in you to the end of the way each
[2:12:50] minister called to stand where he would
[2:12:52] the works that I do shall you also each
[2:12:55] minister ordained of God is commanded to
[2:12:57] stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and
[2:12:59] perform the duties that Jesus performed
[2:13:03] that's quite a command not just talk but
[2:13:06] perform the duties Oh hallelujah watch
[2:13:10] how it must have felt when just my
[2:13:12] standing in the morning when God said I
[2:13:14] would not feel you know leave thee
[2:13:15] therefore I will destroy a Levite and
[2:13:18] make a week clear for you now there is a
[2:13:20] great lot of types to go into that Moses
[2:13:22] was not permitted to take the turn over
[2:13:24] because he had filled and the church
[2:13:30] organizations denomination has filled
[2:13:33] and that's like whatever is up a Joshua
[2:13:36] generation because all what Moses did it
[2:13:40] came to a dead end and it couldn't cross
[2:13:43] so God had to take out Moses of the
[2:13:46] scene here this part God Disick Eliezer
[2:13:49] will raise up a new system and
[2:13:53] interdenominational system by the power
[2:13:56] of God
[2:13:57] by the power of God that will take the
[2:14:02] church into the Promised Land
[2:14:04] organization denomination has messed it
[2:14:06] up each one after the own theology each
[2:14:09] one after the own way of thinking but
[2:14:11] God will take his holy spirit and will
[2:14:15] raise his Joshua that will take the
[2:14:18] church to the promise with no the
[2:14:20] nominal strings string tied it at all
[2:14:23] God called ministers author not to be
[2:14:26] stuffed up a theology but has visited
[2:14:28] the land to where they're gonna bring
[2:14:30] back evidence of divine love and power
[2:14:31] of the Lord Jesus to make known to the
[2:14:34] congregation that there's a land beyond
[2:14:36] the river and this is something but a
[2:14:38] prince had preached he said when we get
[2:14:40] to the river it divides and separate us
[2:14:41] once on the other side here we go
[2:14:44] something happens to you know Joshua in
[2:14:48] all this knowing that the command was
[2:14:50] great but having the assurance he could
[2:14:53] be fearless he could be we call it
[2:14:55] reckless as long as he was pointed the
[2:14:59] right way so kind of Church of the
[2:15:01] Living God be rictus and fearless if the
[2:15:04] feet is pointed in the right way Oh
[2:15:06] glory to God amen isn't that right so
[2:15:10] the first stage is coming out of the
[2:15:11] land then the second see the Sun of the
[2:15:13] key juncture the blood but the Telex
[2:15:14] stage is when the cross Jordan into the
[2:15:17] promised land where the promised slave
[2:15:19] go and pass them you said no remember
[2:15:22] you have to pass by your brethren and
[2:15:23] they are near the border line if you

[2:15:47] him I've got something for you cross
[2:15:49] over and I'm gonna close with this
[2:15:52] that's my desire brethren to see my
[2:15:56] church cross over into another land a
[2:15:58] desire to move over to the other side if
