alone all the praise honor and glory for we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen the people of God said amen amen if you have the Bibles I'm letting my attention to a few portions of scripture revelation 12. um Romans 8 and psalm 119. in relation to all original verse 1 and this is speaking about you know the one in heaven and the church Israel and all of that and there appeared a great wander in heaven a woman clothed with a son and the moon under her feet and upon her head a queen of 12 Stars and she been with child cried travailing in birth and pinned to be delivered and they have paid another Wonder in heaven verse one says the great Wonder in heaven this is another Wonder in heaven so the focus must be on heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crons upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven and did cast them to the Earth and the dragons stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as he was born and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and a child was cut up unto God unto his throne and the woman fled to the Wilderness where she had the police prepared of God that they they should feed her her there a thousand two hundred and three score days and there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven amen Romans 8 I read from verse 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the call according to his purpose for whom it is for no he also did pedestrians to be conformed to the image of his son watch the order there for knowledge then predestination and the word image for whom he did follow verse 29 again he also did a predestinator to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom it predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and only Justified then he also glorify So when you say you are predestinated verse 30 is explained to you breaking down for you what your predestination means in your predestination you are called in your predestination you are justified in your destination you are glorified and that takes in your Justified Sanctified baptized the Holy Ghost and glorified and glorified is the adoption time amen amen and verse 31 what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen Psalm 119 verse 89. forever O Lord Thy word is settle in heaven amen may the Lord had his pleasure to written of his holy words God bless you never see that God bless you how are you doing are you okay God bless you and good evening well it's good to be in the way again tonight um I haven't been here in a long time but um it's good to be here again tonight so firstly before I see anything at all I want you to bring greetings to the convention on behalf of my wife um neka she's not here and the family and our church in Lagos Nigeria and um and some of us are here you know uh uh brother chivo and Brother Talks are ministers here and some of our deacons are here also and a number of Believers from our children here so we are glad to be here and we thank God to be in the meetings I want to bring greetings to our precious brother Isaac and his special wife sister Grace and the family and the great church nearly thank you for your Fitness but Isaac done through the years Gathering the people together and we are here again tonight so we thank God for the grace to be here and to Rejoice with you I'm in this great feast of charity and I also want to you know agree to all these ministers and the churches that are here the pastors missions that are here and to say it's good to be together again to fellowship with you all one more time Under The Canopy of Malachi first message from the back of the Bible God should bless you and it's good to be with you again amen so anyway um um brother Branham um our Prophet came with a message and a message that opened up the entire uh Book of Life amen like brother Tamara was talking about this morning and brother Branham had a Ministry and a message to open up the entire book amen so I know these days you know a lot of us in the message are not quite satisfied with the message and we feel there's so many L's out there to go look for and then we look at this and look at that and look at this and look at that but Frankly Speaking I mean it's fine I mean if that's the way you feel that's fine but God sent us a prophet a man who had a Ministry to go into the prince of God to bring down the word of God because God is not abortioning his word now he's not deciding like okay this is what I'm going to do now the Bible said forever oh Lord that what is settled in heaven amen is settled John finished done finished work can I hear an amen amen amen so our faith our our Christian faith tonight is based upon a word that's already settled in heaven it's not going to be it already happened amen can you say Amen it already happened way back amen already happened amen now brother Branham I had a Ministry to go into the praise of God because he said a prophet is only a gift of knowledge and what is the gift of knowledge to go into the prayers of God and see what God has said for All Time and Eternity and bring it back down I will embraham went before the finishing of the world and brought the water got down for you and I the one that got apportioned for all-time and Eternity whether we believe it or we don't believe it God's word will come to pass exactly as God said it will be so God don't need us he don't need me he don't need you he don't need any man he is God all by himself he don't need you and not to be God he's God without you without me but we thank God to be part of his economy can you say Amen [Applause] amen amen you appreciate it this is the book that was reading before the foundation of the world forever O Lord thy who already said in heaven this is the word of God settled before the foundation of the world everything's written nothing has been added to it nothing has been taken away from it settle in heaven and we can rest our souls on that how I cannot fail will not fail is not about to fail can never fail amen amen amen and you know the story amen William Branham uh uh um it has this good question maybe I should read the quote to you so you know brother Matthew said he said when was this book of Revelation ever wrote amen [Applause] um excuse me on the Revelation book of symbols but from cried out now when was this book of Revelation ever wrote the first place it was wrought before the foundation of the world never mind the English this is King's English not Queens English King's English in the first place it was wrote before The Phoenician of the world and John only by the Spirit-filled heart and soon in Branham this word of God that was written settled before the fashion of the world Amen everybody else is preaching on these Realms here but if the word was before the profession of the world so a man has got to be here a minister or someone has to be here to have the ministry to go before the foundation of the world and bring down that Revelation to you and I and that's the way William Branham but it gets so common to us in the message till we're busy ourselves with nonsense you maybe say that you may be seated all right amen amen so let's go on a journey to now with William Branham into the pictures of the Bible and see this word that was wrote before definition of the world then you'll find your place in the Lamb's Book of Life and you'll know the devil don't even stand a chance between you and Satan no contest no contest because you never did in the first place do you realize you maybe see that do you realize the devil the devil's power over you is because he can accuse you but if you ever lose that power of accusation over you the devil will be totally paralyzed before you and I tell you tonight you'll never deal in the first place Hallelujah not guilty because you never did in the first place not forgiven Justified you never did it in the first place and I'm gonna show you tonight how you'll never be in the first place sure you'll go out of this convention by the time we finish tomorrow night looking for every devil every accusing devil Hallelujah you'll tell the devil Hallelujah I went to a convention over the weekend and I found out the secret you are a liar I never did it in the first place amen [Applause] you maybe see that [Music] so the world was telling me heaven but foreign The Book of Revelation The Book of Life was written before the foundation of the world but you and I know before it became the word it wasn't always word before he became the word America you want to hear these things from Kenneth Hagin or Roberts at the boy you don't hear it from them it's not given to them to understand that but before I became the word the word is set in heaven but before he became the word it was spirit Elohim [Applause] but for the beginning amen maybe see that before the beginning before I became the world it was the spirit Eli Elohim seven perfect Spirits with his seven company names dwelling all by himself and on the back part of his mind there he was on the back part of his mind and we always talk about the back part of his mind and on the back part of his mind there he was with his attributes and you are an attribute son of the spirit that was the spirit and you were there not in flesh like this you are there as a thought it is thinking you are there before the devil ever was created you were there thinking let me see that [Applause] sure I know you know that but let's just follow our story tonight amen you maybe see that amen you are there in his thinking but for the foundation of the world and it is thinking on the back part of his mind we were all there and there was God his great attributes was there in him in his thinking but if you if it was really truly God which he was truly and is still really truly got tonight he's got to know everything so it is thinking on the back part of his mind he needed to know everything he never know what was going to take place in the world I was going to create he had to take away what's going to happen in the future you need to know every bird every animal every fly that will ever be on the face of this Earth You need to know every sin every wrong that would ever take place only Praise of these are there Hallelujah who are there with us in his thinking no while they're with us on the back side no we were we were elected on the back part of elohim's behind all they feel that was going to take place before I mean are going to take place in the world coming on was not on the back part of is mine you maybe see that so here's the point here before the beginning while Elohim was there if he had to be God he had to know everything so on the back part of his mind there you were and he had another path called the foreign knowledge called the front part of his mind we talk about the bad part but that was the front part of his mind the Bible doesn't call it from her but he causes the fore knowledge the former like not that's not him just to know he just knew what was going to happen that wasn't him he just knew the devil was going to deceive Adam I mean even he got no vegan he knew the devil is going to cause trouble his father just knew that he just knew that was going to happen so that's why you call them for knowledge which is the front part of his mind but on the back part you are but the front part knew everything every wrong every right every filthiness that was going to take prison on the first of the Earth but on the back path there you were chopped away and Elohim is thinking before the foundation of the world and the devil couldn't touch her amen you'll receive their Glory amen hallelujah [Applause] [Music] so before the beginning that was the Elohim with his backpack and his foreign [Music] every evil thing every good thing every great thing the U.S elections Nigerian elections Nigerian economy you could see everything but that was not him what was on the back path that was him are you with me tonight are you following our story tonight Hallelujah so you can rightly divide the word of God when the Devil comes and knocking you will tell the devil I know that I know that I know you ain't fooling around with me glory to God I know who I am I come from the back part of elohim's mind you maybe see the glory glory glory to God Amen so just take a mental picture just give mental picture I don't belong with you I promise you that took him into a picture and say hello him here he was part of his mind in a safe part of his mind here he was his attributes to be a God to be a savior to be to be a father to be to be a Healer to be a deliverer on the back of who he was and there were attribute Sons Sons of the sons who had his attributes on the inside of them on the back part of his mind but also before the beginning he also knew everything that was going to take place on this Earth here in the universe he knew every single time they were going to take his name in vain from eating right down to the end of the world he knew all that amen and then in the beginning hemorphated himself and became the logos let me see that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] became the logos and all that was in Elohim came into the logos nor is now all the attributes that was in him came into the logos and in the logos the front pad was also displayed there the four knowledge was also displayed there amen we come from the backpacks but in the logos when he poured all of himself to begin to begin to start this work to come to the Earth to demonstrate and manifest you and I in the logos here he was everything on the back part of his mind he was going to start making them come to pass now and at the same time all the things that you saw in the foreign was going to begin to take place amen so what happened when he unmoved and became the logos he quitted angels and angels watching him for aliens that means millions and millions and millions of years because they don't count time in heaven like we don't have here Angels just worshiped him and worship them and washing them and worship him until an angel had another idea a ninja collusive I had another idea and there was war in heaven we don't start a fight but we never run away from a fight amen [Applause] and God represented by the uh Archangel Michael amen there he was and his angels fought and Revelation 12 lets us understand and know that one thought of the Angels were deceived to come and rise up against Michael and his kingdom and two in other words one thought rose up in other words there were two thoughts there is no side with Lucifer can you get the math are you with me one thought one thought were deceived meaning two thoughts were not deceived what it simply means is giving into it it wasn't one-third number it was given to three parts there were three parts here one part what you see and two parts were not deceived that's why I was telling you it's not a numerical one through 100 and that's not what he's talking about there were three parts here and Michael fought and Lucifer fraud Michael fought and Lucifer fraud and when Lucifer his place could not be found anymore in heaven he was kicked out of heaven and his angels and then after the war in heaven then at that time The Book of Life was expressed all written in heaven forever oh Lord Thy word is settle in heaven so in this book of life here you have a record of events that took place before the finish of the war in elohim's mind on the back part of his mind you have a record on what the prison is for knowledge and then you have a record of what took place in the beginning the war in heaven all that will take place on the face of the Earth was previewed in heaven before the foundation of the world so we are here in the finished work we are here to finish work oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen and we know tonight we're not neither Devil Couldn't deceive Us in heaven he can't do it right here he cannot do it [Applause] no I'm not hearing you [Applause] I said I am not hearing you the Devil Couldn't deceive Us in heaven he can't deceive us here now we were not in the foreknowledge we were in the backpacks of his mind you maybe see the glory glory yes Hallelujah [Applause] amen foreign [Applause] [Music] I try to show you the whole picture but for the definition of the world Elohim part of his mind for knowledge for knowledge knows who was going to take it or he's going to accept he's not going to accept it I'd say he's gonna be on the face of the Earth everything that's going to happen every time a cow will pass on this street here every time people will come into this another Hall he saw all of them but that's not who he is just the ability to know his phone knowledge let him know that [Applause] and then he came into the beginning and there was hell on him become the logos and in the logos was the backpacks and the foreknowledge expressed in the beginning as the logos which is the word which was expressed and and forever settled in heaven [Applause] the word was inside on Heaven before I became the word and then the logos began to do the work of creation the work of creation and all that was going to take place on the other side to play out try to play out send it to a play out send it to a play out and then Lucifer came and fought against the plan on the program of God and God fought back he didn't start a fight but go far back for the devil back don't don't scream away from the devil he stood flat-footed and fought back and Lucifer isn't going to give up just because you fight back he's gonna fight you he wants to be sure you know what you're talking about amen and when he couldn't do he could overcome he was kicked out of heaven and when was Kingdom of Heaven there was peace in heaven now then at that time The Book of Life because Revelation was written or expressed or settle in heaven forever O Lord and that's why this book contains a record of everything that took place in elohim's mind the foreknowledge the back path that's why this book contains everything that took place in the beginning Michael Lucifer Angels created universe everything there this book contains it Loose if I kick down this book contains it but he had to take a 20th century Prophet to go before the man of God and bring it down to you and rightly divide the word of God to you and I amen [Music] let's look at this a little bit more closely Romans 8 29 and 30. in there you have the whole gospel story gospel stories in there Romans 8 28 Romans 8 29 28 we know uh we know all things work together for good to them that love God who are the color come to his purpose amen amen Romans 8 29 open your bibles if you will you're going to put on your spiritual thinking Captain I'll be done before you know it um after the ingredients I'm just been talking like 20 minutes okay all right so um Romans 8 29 for whom he did for Noah I'm saying here is Elohim his formula just knows everything he sees you and I are going to be born you young people he says you're going to be born your parents are going to be Christians and you're going to be born in the message in the church or wherever you're going to be dedicated he saw all that and he's going to bring the gospel to you and his foreign [Music] let him see all that but he's trying to let him see who really wants to serve God who really wants to please God and those are the ones he really foreknew for whom he did for no then he also called [Applause] he's not calling you Pastor Isaac president is not calling they're not calling you tonight way back before the function of the world Elohim shut the rings of your heart and he saw that you really want to serve God in spite of your struggle in spite of your getting up and falling down he saw you really want to serve God so he called you like he called Adam Adam where are thou Elohim called you you are not looking for God he is looking for you and searching for you he called you before you ever had a chance before you ever come here Elohim calls you [Music] [Applause] told me he also did predestinate to be confirmed so we saw you maybe see that his full knowledge saw you and I we were gonna want to receive the Gospel and that's how I chose I Choose You I Choose You I Choose You I Choose You La brother Commander will speak to you this morning I Choose You I Choose You I Choose You I Choose You amen not based upon what you've done a design your soul that you want to serve God you want to please God you want to live for God it's not about falling and Rising you can fall a million times but it's that desire there hold that desire don't let the devil tell you a lie you'll fall in every time it's not worth it oh yes it is worth it tell the devil it is worth it I will hold my desire because of that desire not because I am good because of that desire Elohim he predestinated me to be confirmed to the image of his son oh Hallelujah [Applause] amen amen whom he did for no he also did predestinate and whom he depressed in it he doesn't have to be confirmed the image of his son that he might be the first one among many presidents moreover human just never study then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified or what's the story here friends in these two verses here amen you see all of elohim's plans Amen on the back part of his mind this L on him saying you are going to take it he called you but there's an energy called you and Justified you elected you on the back part of his mind glory to God Amen so in these two verses here you'll find foreign election in there you find predestination I mean that you find Destiny Hallelujah glory to God Amen and brother Branham said brother Benham said for whom it is fought I mean the power said whom we need for no fun all that comes first the phone only comes for us but whom it if I know then he also predestinate for spirit I want to say is elect according to the foreign knowledge of God so when his fatherless saw you were going to take it then he elected you Hallelujah for knowledge election looks back to our knowledge Elohim sir you are going to take it because you saw you were going to take it in spite of all your challenges in spite of every boy every girl in school making fun of you and when you don't understand when you think the gospel is wrong when you just say you can't make it anymore he saw you were gonna hang in there his father like saw you struggling never giving up because of that he said I will help them he chose you and elected you and your election looks back to elohim's for knowledge can you say Amen [Applause] so Peter says Prosperity I want to say is elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father Elohim the phonology of Elohim the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied so when he calls you he also Sanctified and points you by the blood of Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world that's why when you got into the beginning your representation you couldn't do anything else Satan Lucifer couldn't touch you he was you already were predestinated you already called you already elected his family already saw you this is still before the beginning in the beginning was the world before the beginning his foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ERS can stick on you before the devil was even created before Angels were created he Sanctified you and cleansed you with the washing of the Water by the world oh Hallelujah too many times you think this thing depends on us it doesn't depend on you and I salvation is of the Lord I am the first and the last the beginning of the end the almighty God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated amen Romans 8 29 whom it is in other words we can say it like this whom it is funnel and elected he also did predestinate when you say I'm predestinated what do you really mean what you really mean let the Bible explain to you and I when you say you're predestinated what is what is the predestination that Those whom Arrow him so we're gonna take it he elected them and predestinated them what is this first nation if this nation is that they will become formed that's future they're going to be formed into the image of Jesus Christ into the image of God's own son they're going to be like God's son in the future already happened in God's mind but that's going to be played out on the face of the Earth are you with me [Applause] verse 30 Romans 8. moreover whom he did position it then he also called this is your predestination this is what is what it means when you come and you are called gospel goes out you hear your name you come because you are predestinated this is your election playing out and whom he called then he also Justified Justified not forgiven Justified Justified Justified not forgiven Justified Justified means you never did it in the first place that's what Justified means that means discharge and acquitted you can't put a finger on them is a false accusation they did not do it they are not responsible for it you never did it in the first place [Applause] you know the reason why your election makes sure you will be justified like you're never in the first place you may be seated [Applause] Joy election before The Phoenician of the world Elohim for knowledge elected you an election means he chose you and Sanctified you and cleansed you with blood in other words he put a repellent upon you before the devil would have a chance in the war in heaven that's why you could not fall for the devil's lies that's why you can never be deceived hallelujah it's impossible in possible for the devil to touch you he can lay a single finger on you [Applause] in the wine heaven or the lies of the devil the Jews fall for it no [Applause] your representation didn't fall for it because you were covered with blood the blood of Jesus Christ the devil couldn't touch you Oh Glory to God amen amen you maybe see that [Applause] so moreover how many people just need then he also called and whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified they may also glorify you can see it jumps sanctification he jumped on the Holy Ghost because that's already done before The Phoenician of the world and glorified you are going to be plugged with the glory the glory of God which is seven compound fold nature you'll be close with the glory of God and who may whom he predestinated them here ready Justified it's a future work but look at the gospel look at the look at the language of the Bible here is the future work blessed nation is looking forward you are going to be conformed to the image of his son but look at how it happens moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called past tense and whom he called them he also Justified past tense and whom he justified then he also glorified past tense is a future walk but it's already done it's a future work but it's already done what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be

exceeded Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah man amen amen for knowledge an election President and Destiny all them happened before the foundation of the world happened before amen elohim's mind before

of the world before the beginning before the world became the world Amen Hallelujah like I told you for knowledge that wasn't him finally took place in the forept of his mind for knowledge that was near on him that was just a full knowledge just what he knows Babin God can you relate many thoughts come in your mind and the devil lost you that's you that's just your knowledge they just know those things they'll put a thought on your mind like young people you want sex you want field you want to be this one you want to do that here no I don't want those things you don't have to struggle Elohim

all sin that will come to Earth he knew everyone that would ever sin in the front part he knew about what desires will be in every heart of every man every woman boy and girl just a record he knew all of that in his chiffon pass in the front path he knew Adam was in you know those who worked and those who were not in the vampire and the front part seeing those who receive it by espanol he saw them and know them saying they will receive it he elected them he took them out of that book of life he elected them out of the book of life out of the book of all life he elected him out of there and put them on the back of his mind which is another record another record of his own life oh Hallelujah Glory oh brother we come from the bad parts of the beginning the devil don't even know where we are coming from we come a flash of lightning before the devil knows that we are here he can't even do a thing to you oh let me say that again let me say that again to let you see you escape the devil not here you escape the devil in elohim's mind before you ever come here the devil didn't get a chance to put a finger on you [Music] Hallelujah I feel like walking [Applause] cannot hearing me no you are not hearing me I said he had a book of all life that was his foreign knowledge is for knowledge of every life every filthiness every sin you and I will do he saw it all but he saw in spite of all our trials all our labels all our fallen he saw we want to please him so he straight out his hand [Applause] way past the times and stretches out to your heart and pull you into him on the back part of his mind into another record of life [Applause] hey cancel your record in the book of natural life and put to another record of life oh Hallelujah forever oh Lord thou word is settled in heaven [Applause] hey man let me see that glory to God him in he's a bit too cool for me can I have my jacket you'll be too hard to call for me like I'm a jacket [Music] [Applause] thank you let me see that let's let's try this home let me see that Oh Glory to God Amen but did you hear me [Applause] I haven't seen you that's why you have those books the fore knowledge is a record of all life [Music] every record of all life The Book of Life and when he says you are trying to please him his treasury hand and took you from that book onto the back part of his mind and another record of his own Book of Life his own life not your life his own life the Lamb's Book of Life oh hallelujah amen thank you Jesus oh Gloria amen his poor knowledge elected but the lecture were removed from the four part I'm pleasing another record of life amen and that record was on the back part of his mind which is in his thinking in a different record playing his own mind in his own records in his blood before The Phoenician of the world is that your two books of life natural book and his own book of his own records of his own nature he's been who he is his record of himself his own life he took you from that natural book and put you into a record of his own life and sprinkled you with blood before you ever come here oh my if you get that you get my message tonight amen amen many men oh brother oh brother called out Justified glorified then manifested he removed you from the foreknowledge his privilege of all life that would ever come on the face of the Earth his book of all life he removed you from there I'm pleasing his record or they called out Those whom he knew those who may Forney or whom he justified whom he already glorified and this new record of life is a record of his own life in his sons and daughters amen Sons and Daughters of God on the face of the Earth and we call that the Lamb's Book of Life [Applause] and these two books wine elohim's mind and Elohim on Moffett and became the logos and we saw these two books begin to play out so the Lamb's Book began to play out hell on him his arteries coming forth began to create made Angels created angels Gonna Worship Him and became an object of worship and then from there amen angels watching for a long time and then Lucifer and his angels came against all life The Book of Life versus the Lamb's Book are you with me that's what's always been the force anointed the true seat of the word of the word of God that's where it's always been that's why it's always been amen and I don't want to get into that amen oh my mama glory to God Amen so in the beginning when Helen hell he was playing out the backpack the last book of life where he elected you and I and put our names in Splash our names in Blood and then when he created angels those angels represented you and I and then Lucifer came the dragon came to come against that and that's been the story of the world playing out kept coming against that in the Book of Life all these fights and things don't take place in the Lamb's Book of Life is in the Book of Life all the fattening and all that stuff you don't find the spirit among the sun's of God Amen the sons of God won't start a fight they never run from a fight because we are not cowards [Applause] and that's why in your home you don't start a fight with your wife you don't start a fight with your husband is not the spirit of the sons of God it's not oh man let me leave that alone let me leave that alone glory glory to God Amen [Applause] amen amen amen Oh Glory amen let's close out let's close out hey man our closing about 10 15 minutes you never see that so what happened Elohim Michael logos fought Lucifer fought Michael fought and Lucifer foot Michael foot and Lucifer Ford and one is so I could not Prevail he was cast out of heaven and I said after that the book of life was expressed and in The Book of Life were two books The Book of Life and the lambsuka life they turn us to our section A record of every name on the face of the Earth and also a record of all those special names on elohim's mind before the foundation of the world amen and what are these four parts here one part the internal section that's you coming from the back part of elohim's mind that's one patch where you are Justified where the blood of Jesus Christ is sprinkled on you where the blood of the Lamb is pickled on you and the devil couldn't touch you that's why he couldn't deceive you with those tail [Music] that's one part of The Book of Life another one part was this believed one power was received so there's another path brother Benham said there are four parts of the Book of Life number one Eternal section number two is the foolish virgins and number three is the borderline Believers the Judas group amen the Balaam group who had their names taken out of the book who are their names taken out of the book in other words they were deceived by Lucifer and they were cast out of heaven and their names were not found in the book anymore they were there they were there they were there in the beginning they were there in the book when the what of God came into being in heaven they were there and then listen to Lucifer who deceived them and because of our deceived that they were taken out and their place their names was not found any more in heaven that's the borderline believers but there's this other group also who did not fall for Lucifer's lies and they are not the bride they don't come from the Battle of elohim's mind yet they did not fall for Lucifer's lies oh I don't know if you are getting me amen one thought fell for Elizabeth's lies one thought came from the back of the battle of his mind but there's a path also that didn't come from Elohim is back part of his mind but not for police first lives where's brother Brian I'm getting these things from this is where he's coming from because as another group amen the foolish virgins remember see that you never see that [Applause] foreign [Applause] s they're not bright but they're not one of them Believers either and that's why it's wrong for you and how many times just condemn Pentecostals they're demons their feelings they're all that stuff look listen welcome to the focus This Book of Life here number one the prayer Eternal section number two the foolish virgins amen they never had a knowledge of the truth they never have the truth preaching them they were deceived by all the big Pentecostal shots but minister with signs and wonders and miracles amen they never had a chance to have the real true gospel but many of them in their hearts they want to please God Hallelujah they not have oil in their lambs because they do not have the word of the Living God the lamb is the word of God the message of the hour they did not have that but God who is rich in Mercy is going to let them take a chance at the word from judgment and it's going to give them life for being kind to the bride these people are foolish virgins in this group also are the cheap nations of Matthew 25 and this group also at the 144 000 in this group also has a Souls under the altar they're not bright but they're going to receive eternal life [Applause] that's the other one thought that enough fall for Lucifer's lies and there's a fourth part which is a shopping seed but the problem said they have nothing to do with God they are not even in the record at all so three past held their record in the book One path they serpentry don't have a record at all that's your four parts of the Book of Life and that's how he prayed and in heaven and after the war in heaven then the book of life was expressed forever oh Lord thou word is set in heaven and you can search in the world you can see the pride you can see the foolish virgins you can see the bodiland Believers well you can see that the serpenter said there's no record of them at all that's your four parts of the book of life but here we come into the picture we are sons of God come back from the back part of God's mind and we are like Adam maybe so we're like Adam waiting to be manifested on the face of this up here maybe see the glory I'm finished I'm finished really Glory Glory [Applause] story amen [Applause] Hallelujah amen so glory to God Amen so what was Lucifer's intention in the wine heaven Romans 12 tells us it was to come against The Man Child he stayed upon that woman to make sure the monkey doesn't come alive doesn't get born who is The Man Child Adam because God created Adam from Adam in the Garden of Eden and Adam was a man-child there was a man who was a child he was born in Manchester like the woman in version 12. and a man child represents an adopted glorified Son of God that's changed on the beauty of his Holiness another devil that's what the devil is after that's why devil is afraid for that's what devil is standing against devil doesn't care what you do the devil is to make sure that bride doesn't come to this turtle although fullness of Jesus Christ well God is determined he's going to have a bride oh he's going to have a perfect bride and that's why amen God tonight amen as long as you come to God you'll give your heart and love to Jesus Christ amen you come to him he repentance of your sins he cancels your book everything that you did every filthiness every young godliness every sin he wipes it out in the sea of his forgetfulness because you never did in the first place I am in your ignorance the devil deceived you but you'll never in the first place and he cancels out that book and has another record of you a new record of you Amen on the back part of his mind that's your recording now that is his that's a record elements of you tonight oh Hallelujah and like Adam tonight you are a son of God you are not going to be a son you are a son of God tonight beloved now are we the sons of God we shall be but we know when it shall appear we shall be like him so there is no condemnation tonight he is that his band of God there is no condemnation tonight if you have seen repent and get the sin under the blood but there is no condemnation peace of faith without condemnation oh hallelujah hallelujah because we are going to come to the manifestation of the sons of God Adam was manifested in the Garden of Eden he was from the Son of God but he needed to have the what image and not into his flesh and then the world is going to see Son of God they're going to see the Lamb's Book of redemption in manifestation as you are walking up and down the face of Israel here you are the Lamb's Book of Life you are the law school redemption in human skin walking up and down the Earth every other person is their Book of Life Book of natural life and that's why it says the Bible at the gray was to enjoyment the books are opened all the books are open every one on this out here has a book of their records a book of their life everything every field every on goodness that they do and many people Muslims and different ones feel God will see if my good outweighs my bad then I make it no the only way you make is that you are not going to be out of any book if you take a chance that your book will cancel out your good works against your bad works that's not God if you're here tonight and you haven't given your heart Allah to Jesus Christ because salvation you can never earn it you can never please God enough God gives it to you and he sees in your heart you want to serve me they want to serve me and when you come he gives it to you free without money without price salvation is of the Lord he gives you free without money without prize oh Hallelujah and then you can start pressing on predestinated call Justified baptized with the Holy Ghost and then adopted oh God bless you God bless you those are your four passes with the life Oh Glory to God in many many many many many men amen amen [Music] so we see clear tonight where we are in this book of life in the Eternal section in the blood section covered in blood and the devil can put a finger on us he's not talking about me all the accusations he's not talking about me he's not talking about you he's not talking about me of course if you do wrong you don't say I didn't do wrong you quickly repent if you do wrong you don't have to tell a child a god from the back of elohim's mind that they did wrong because God sees that desire they don't want to do no wrong oh Hallelujah turn around and shake your brother's hand and tell them you never did in the first place oh glory to God Amen [Applause] [Music] all right foreign [Applause] [Applause] you know Consulting this is Victory Life what a boy said one day one day the bride will know who she is and then the Rapture will go

a bit of people back and forth on the street he had later on a neighbor a young man came unnoticed and it was returned the next morning so we thank God for that God is still taking care of all aspects

just tied or roped to hold on father and they are the end of their rope problem Lord we pray this morning that your word that was spoken today and the spirit that would follow the world would find these individuals harder to give them a charge to give them an encouragement to keep on fighting to keep on pressing to Keep On Believing to keep on contending for the faith to not give up and not
