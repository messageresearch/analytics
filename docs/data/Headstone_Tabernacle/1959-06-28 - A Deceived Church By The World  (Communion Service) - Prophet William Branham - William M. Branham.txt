revive us revive us oh revive us again Rive us revive us revive us again oh can we give him praise today hallelujah hallelujah oh we thank you Lord for your presence we thank you Lord we thank you Lord amen and amen amen God bless you church as we get ready to put uh on a tape for you this evening amen may the Lord richly bless you as we enter into the word of the Lord amen so you just ride the anointing I believe the title of the message is a deceived Church by the world Amen so God Rich you bless you as we hear the word of the Lord amen you can have your seats at it's time Jesus Christ his son and has given us all things freely in Christ we are grateful to thee Lord for the Privileges that we are granted by this great Supreme sacrifice that Jesus gave for us at Calvary that it reconciled us back into fellowship and to favor with thee that we might have this consolation of knowing that it's written if ye abide in me and my words in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I we're grateful for this and pray that you'll give us Faith to believe it with all that's in us now let us lay aside Lord every toil of the day every cure of this life all the way from the janitor to the pastor that there would be nothing in our minds now but be waiting listening reverently for the Holy Spirit to speak to us that we might accomplish something good to know more of thee by our gathering together for Lord truly that's why we come on this hot day speak to us through thy Living Word and let the Living Word dwell in us and abide in us that we might be shaped and formed not to the world but be transformed by the renewing of our spirit into the form of the Son of God oh our hearts tremble when we think in the joy floods our souls to know that we can be called Sons and Daughters of God we stand on the very brim of his second coming and All Nations and kingdoms quivering under our feet all things of the world is Vanishing but knowing that someday he shall come and shall take us to a kingdom where there shall never be an end or it'll never be moved and to think that we are now that the subjects of that Kingdom oh God circumcise our heart and ears today but by the Holy Spirit through the washing of the water of the word far we ask that in his name and for his glory amen I wish to approach the subject this morning for I was going to speak on something a little different if there was to be a healing service but we announced that the prayer cards to be give out at 8 till 8:30 or 9:00 and I just Billy come up the house a few minutes ago and he said there was hardly anyone here so he didn't give out prayer cards so we'll I thought of taking this text for a correction of the church now I want to speak on the subject of a deceived Church by the world I wish to read some now out of the Book of Judges the 16th chapter beginning with the 10th verse and delas said unto Samson behold thou has mocked me and told me lies now tell me I pray thee wherein thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall I be weak and be as another man Deli therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him the Philistines be upon thee Samson and there was liars and weight abiding in the chamber and he break them from off his arms like as threads and delas said unto Samson hither to thou has mocked me and told me lies tell me where thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou weest Seven Locks of my head with a web and she fastened it to the pins and said to him the Philistines beyond the Samson and he awakened out of his sleep and went away with the pins of the beams and with the web and she said unto him how can thou say I love thee when in thine heart is not with me thou has mocked me these three times and has told me where in thy great strength lies and has not told me where in thy great strength lies and it came to pass when she had pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death and he told her all his heart and said unto her there has not come a razor up on my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like another man and when Delah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called the Lords of the Philistines saying come up this once for he has sh me all his heart and the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and sought money in brought money into her hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and he caused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and began to afflict him and his strength went from him and she said the Philistines be upon the Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wits not that the Lord had departed from him now I wish to read for a text for this subject found over in the Book of Revelations the 2 chapter beginning with the 21st and the 23rd verses and I gave her space to repent of her fornications and she repented not behold I will cast her in to a bed and them that committed adultery with her un great tribulations except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works May the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word Samson great deal liked the church started off right he started off in the right direction he started off and was called a mighty man of V he started out serving the lord and keeping his words and doing his Commandments and that was somewhat like the church it started off on as we would say as a world expression started on the right foot started to keep the Commandments of the Lord and as long as Sams son follow the lord the Lord you Samson for God can keep anyone and use anyone that will follow after him for it's God's business but when we turn to a side away from the things of God then God cannot use us any longer when we'll walk steadfastly after the Commandments of God when we'll stay in the pages of the Bible and worship by the written word worship him in the spirit and in the truth of the word then God can use any individual but when they take a notion to turn aside after something else then God cannot use that person any longer so Samson makes a and a very out standing representation of the Church of today when the church started God could use the church for the church walked diligently after the Commandments of the Lord kept all of his judgments and his statutes and done all of his commands and God was with the church but it seems to be that there is such a weakening place amongst the church remember we are not on a picnic but we're in a battlefield many people just think that when they become a Christian that that's all they need to do that that settles it forever if they are a Christian then everything's going to come easy don't never get that in your head where I become a Christian to fight fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get in the battle lines we are Christian Soldiers and we've got to be trained and brought up and know all the technques of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to to fight the fight and we can only do that as the Holy Spirit Will re reveal it to us we cannot take what some other Nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit would direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is the Commander in Chief of the army of the Christians God Samson did good he was a great man until he began to begin to kind of we would call it scallywag around until he began to get off of his own territory and the church didn't run well and was all right until they begin to get off of their territory story Samson begin to flirt and he was not flirting with Israel that his girls he begin to F with a philistin girls and that's somewhat similar to what the church did it never began to make love with its own it got off after unbelievers and begin to flirt with unbelievers that's where we made our great and one of the greatest mistakes as when the church begin to do things that wasn't right it begin to keep like Samson Bad Company Samson as long as he was in the company of the Lord's people he did all right but when he got to flirting with Bad Company then he got in trouble and that's the way it is with the church when the church followed reverently and daily after the leading of the Holy Spirit God blessed them and miracles and signs and wonders follow the church but when he begin to keep Bad Company with the world one of the worst things that done in the first things that done it begin to organize breaking up Fellowship ship amongst other believers because it found out that nations were organized but this great gospel is not dedicated to One Nation or one people it's dedicated to whosoever will let him come all nations kindreds tongues and people God never did intend for us to draw bound boundary lines but man wanted to be like the compare or to copy after go like the the world does say the things that they do make a success the way they were a success we cannot never be a success doing anything the world does we can only be a success as we follow after God's statutes and his way of doing things we can never be by pattering after the world if the cigarette company has met their greatest success by television and the beer and the whiskey crowds has made their great success to du the contribution of Television that's no sign that the church shall make its success by television amen the success of the church lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the spirit praise God thank you Jesus we cannot say because that television done such and such for the cigarette company and the and the other companies we do not have have any Scripture to try to compare with them people and as long as we do we may draw great numbers of people but that's not what God ordained us to do amen we think because that we're all colors flying high great organizations causing great colorful things to take place that it's a success we are dying daily on our feet oh spiritually speaking if we stood 10 million strong this morning and the Holy Spirit wasn't with us we'd do well to stand 10 strong with the holy spirit with us we cannot compare with the world one of the first things was the church begin to organize themselves the first organization was the Catholic Church and then come to Lutheran Church when they organized in the Catholic church to make it an organization one day there was a cry the Philistines is on the Samson and Samson broke the cords of the bounds of the Catholic church and Martin Luther came forth amen with the organizations then they bound the church with another card as Delia did and they begin instead of having God call man man who were called by the Holy Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs amen but they know Christ amen then the church got stylished and fashioned after the political speakers and they had to give their preachers doctor's degree everybody had to be a doctor of divinity that was another card Divine the church man go off and study each Seminary tries to produce a better scholar so that their churches can brag our pastor is a doctor of divinity what did they do one try to have more knowledge than the other well that doesn't mean anything in the sight of God and there's no need for any man to try to take his worldly knowledge and ever please God with it it's an abomination in the sight of God Amen you'll never please God with the worldly Ambitions and knowledge because it's imity to God says the scriptures he cannot do it and each one try to have all the knowledge they know just what to do and the words to say and it becomes just a political speech instead of a powerly demonstrated Holy Spirit message that sinks to the heart of man and discovers the sins praise God they're trained for political talks and we don't need that Paul said the word come to us not only are the the gospel and word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost amen that brought the gospel demonstrating the powers of the Holy Ghost but all these men go off the seminaries and they learn great educations how they must stand before the people how they must present themselves how they must dress and how they must act should never use the wrong grammar now that's all right for a political speech but we are not after the enchanting words of man Paul said the gospel that I preached didn't come like that when it come to the renewing of the the Holy Ghost and the power of demonstrations [Applause] amen do come Hallelujah by right form speech praise God that your wisdom would be or your trust would be in the wisdom of man but it come through the demonstrations of the power of the Risen Christ Hallelujah that's the gospel Amen to know him in the power of his resurrection hallelujah praise God each one tries to think he's a little smarter than the other man each to denomination the methodists will say we got the smartest man the Baptist will say and the Church of Christ and so forth they all we we're the smartest we our our people we don't let just the ordinary man go out and preach the gospel but they handpick them oh God have mercy handpick them if they're indument with their certain Doctrine then they put him in the church God can't touch him in no way amen I want somebody to preach to me that's been handpicked by the Holy Ghost God has raised up Hallelujah not picked by man or denominations all knowledge they say oh we know all about it and some of them doesn't know the first alphabet of the Holy Spirit they deny it Jesus it reminds me of a little book I read one day in California about 10 years ago I picked it up in an old bookstore I forget who was the author just a little 10 cent book but it had some good sense to it though it seemed jokingly and cunningly but I found something in there that sounded like God to me and one of the little stories started out like this one morning in a great chicken pin there was a certain Little Rooster that thought he had had all the knowledge that there was to be known so he THS up on a box and beat his little bill against the Box four or five times threw back his little head and C like you never heard of rooster crow and the others he attracted their attention and he said ladies and gentlemen of this chicken pin I would like to speak to you all this morning on some great educational program we have just designed said I have required a lot of knowledge in my studying as he pulled his little glasses over his bill and he said I have decided that we chickens can better ourselves by a more knowledge therefore I can tell you that where if we will dig and work and a certain pin or hole we'll find a certain vitamin that'll make us Crow better prettier feathers and oh I can tell you how we can EMB better oursel in many different ways and the little pullets with their little red Combs they just cackled and said isn't he a darling and they certainly admired him oh he is such a brilliant rooster reminds me of some of these here Seminary preachers such a brilliant man there's no need of us hanging around the rest of chickens we all ought to go with him well before the little fell got his speech finished there was another little chicken that didn't have such bright feathers come running in from the rest of the chicken yard and said boys just a minute I just heard the latest bulletin on the radio chickens went up 4 cents on the pound we're all going to the slaughter tomorrow what good your knowledge going to do brother all the knowledge that we can accumulate what good does it do we're six foot of dirt amen we're all dying by inches and by minutes our knowledge means nothing we want to know him but they do that as I was remarking some time ago about a certain little canary and he thought he know all the knowledge that it need to be known and he knowed so much that he could tell all the rest of the canaries about the human beings so he flies up on his cage and he begins to speak about the human beings how he knowed all about them and all of a sudden a professor from Purdue walked up and begin to speak some high polish words to him and the little fell batted his eyes and turned his head now he had eyes he could see the professor he had ears he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about why he's got a canary brain he's just a bird brain that's all he's got he hasn't got a human brain so he can't think like human beings and neither can a human being think like God Amen you're human all the worldly knowledge of is no more than a canary brain amen all you do you just hurt yourself with it you got to have the mind of Christ Hallelujah the reason people go and jarn organizations and substitute a handshake instead of the new birth they're trying to bypass the new birth they don't want the new birth and the they know we teach it in the Bible so they want to substitute something for it and the Pentecostal people are just as bad trying to substitute something they want it in class it must be just so classy we'll shake hands and join the church and be sprinkled or baptized or something they're afraid of the new birth I sometimes believe the brandom Tabernacle is getting afraid of it amen now we all know that a birth I don't care where it is or what where abouts it's a mess if a baby's born on a sh pile on a hard floor or in a peak decorated hospital room it's a mess and anyhow amen a birth of a calf birth of anything else is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess amen but people so starchy we'll go over where they shake hands we'll go over where they don't ball and cry and beat on the Altar and cry out you want to be too human what we need is birth dying out that brings forth life praise God a seed an old potato a seed potato you take that potato and put it in the ground until you can have new potatoes that old potato has to Rock Amen a corn cannot produce new life until it's rotten amen and a man or a woman can never have new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is rotten dead amen die out at the altar and scream get all messed up till a place of starch gets out of your collar and you're born again by the spirit of godallah I don't care if you Squall speak in tongue jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life amen but we substituted something for it amen we want the classical way praise God sure the other day Friday wife and I was going to the store I don't mean to harp on this but as we went down the street I just kept turn my head one way for the other naked women I promised God when I was a blind man if he'd heal my eyes i' look at the thing was right I keep people little cross hanging in my car when I see such as that I look at the cross and say oh God that's my refuge as I looked at the cross I seen those women praise God me said we haven't seen one woman today that's got on a skirt and she said bill look at that woman there with those little straps around her top of her body and said you mean to tell me that woman don't know that's wrong said if she doesn't know it's wrong then she's out of her right mind I said just a minute honey she is an American she does as the Americans do I said I was in Finland not long go sweetheart and I question there to a man that Set Me Down Dr Mion and and we were going to the the health baths What's called the Sund and they take you in and pour hot water on water on hot rocks and it just sweats you then they make you jump in ice water and then back out then you take you into a room and there's nurses and there women who scrub the man and them naked send them back into the pool I wouldn't go in I said Dr Mone then that's wrong he said all right then reever Brandon that's wrong then how about your American doctors that'll strip a woman naked and lay her on the table and examine every sex organ she's got how about your nurses in the hospitals I said excuse me brother n Mion you're right what is it it's Customs when I was in Paris I could hardly believe it that the urals for both men and women were the same one I couldn't understanded that the restrooms was on the side of the street for both male and female I couldn't believe that when women went to the beach to go swimming a boy and his sweetheart they had no dressing rooms they just took all their clothes to the last garment then turned their backs and put on a little strap when swimming but it's so they pay no attention to it it's a custom of France in Africa women and men young and old no clothes at all walking through the Prairies never know what a restroom was or things that never went out of each other's sight but they don't know the difference they don't know the difference but it's customs of Nations but I said honey we are different we are from another Nation we are pilgrims and strangers here that's what makes these things look so wrong amen for the Bible said they that profess such claim they show that they are pilgrims and strangers they are seeking a city to come amen a man or a woman in Italy in France in Africa in any other Nation that's ever born again of the Holy Ghost don't do those things amen they won't wear those clothes they won't act like that because they're of another nation whose ruler and maker is God we're from Heaven the spirit that's within you motivates your life if you are American you'll do as Americans do if you are a French you'll do as the French do and criticize the other but if you are a god you'll do the way they do in heaven because your spirit comes from above and it controls you a little something you might look at in the scripture those who sought this new city acted different they professed that they were pilgrims and strangers but on the side of King they become fugitives and renegades but Christians were pilgrims and strangers a fugitive has no home a renegade is a horrible person person but a pilgrim is something real and from a real land in another Nation trying to find his way home professing by his living that he has something that he's from another country there is the reason but yet those people who do so those people who wear those things let me tell you in South Africa when I saw 30,000 raw heathens naked blanket natives 16 18 20 year old girls boys with not one stitch of clothes standing there with mud in their faces and painted Up Bones through their nose and blocks of wood hanging from their ears and cross human bones or some bones in their hair animals teeth hanging over them naked as they come into the world and didn't know it but when they received Christ and fell on their face and received the Holy Ghost they got up and folded their arms to hold shame to their bosom as they walked away and found clothes to put on Amen why they become pilgrims and strangers to this world Amen Hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah they were away from him yes sir oh yes these people call themselves Christians they belong to churches they go and say we are methodists We Are Baptist we're Pentecostal we're sday Adventist we're this that the other that doesn't have one thing to do with it your spirit the life that's in you motivates and tells what you are Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them the church has become like Israel first they seen all the Heathen Nations having a king God was their King and they seen the Heathen Nations having King so they wanted to act like the Heathen Nations and they bought themsel a king and as they did it they got in trouble gradually begin to come in gradually the world begin to slip into them finally ended up in aab one king coming just a little closer to it a little closer to it and finally squeeze the life out of them there they went and when they real king come they didn't know him that's the same thing the church has done it's adopted here are it's adopted politics educations it's adopted organizations Society big churches amen High confuting preachers and when the real King comes they don't know him and they're crucifying the very Holy Ghost that's their King they don't know him Hallelujah but they laugh at him and make fun of him as the Jews did their Messiah the church is doing their Messiah the same way they don't know it they haven't got the spiritual Insight because they're so indument with their eyes and what they see great buildings trying to compare with the world we are never exalt exalted to to compare with the world we're exalted to Humble ourselves and one is a majority in God and today in the healing evangelist out on the fields there're such a competi competitors one says well bless God I have so many thousands I got a bigger meeting than you have what difference does that make if we have one or one million what difference does it make are we true to God are we true to his word do we stand under test of the holy spirit is it true that's the main thing but we compromise upon the Bible lot of our Pentecostal people up on the fundamental doctrines of this Bible compromise yeah I don't want to hurt feelings I'm in my own church and I feel that I I could do just what in the church because I'm preaching the gospel but there's tens of thousands of Pentecostal preachers know that there's no such a thing in the Bible as a baptism in the name of father son Holy Ghost I challenge the Archbishop for anybody to show me where anybody was ever baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost amen but they compromise because these organizations has did so there's not one person in the New Testament and for 300 years afterwards a history of what was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what is it organization that's did it compromising and today theyve took all the street workers off the streets they've took the tambourine out of the church they've taken all the glory out of the church and God seminaries preaching little old rooster comb preaching all Polished in society and they're women wearing shorts and dresses that they're skinned into and men smoking cigarettes and gambling and telling dirty jokes it's a disgrace in the sight of God I know that's rough but it's time somebody said something Jesus compromising giving in acting like the world I don't care if I have to stand alone with nobody but God alone I'll preach the truth of God's Bible and standard if I die I'll still stand for the truth praise the lord we want truth I measure up not according to the church but according to the word of God I want to measure up but Delia did you notice she know that Samson had a power and she didn't know where that power laid she couldn't tell what that power was but there was some great power that Samson possessed and she wanted to find it and as Delia she kept wooing Samson after her beauty oh she dressed herself real sexy and she walked before him she teed like some of the little teenagers of the day and and so forth and just act like something other strip teas trying to woo Samson to her that's the same thing the world's done to the [Applause] church now where is your great power well if we'll organize that'll break the power the Catholic Church done it but the Philistines is on the Samson and a Luther come out and he organized again if you buy me with another card it'll hold me so they did and the fistings on the Samson what happened Wesley came out and broke the cards amen now you've deceived me all along don't you know I love you Samson all right tell me the truth in your heart all right you buy me with another card all right now we'll do that what is that that's the denominational card you let me be free that I ain't got no denomination then I tell you you have me broke so out come the Pentecostals amen where's your power fistin be upon me and he broke the cards again but now what happened it's got the Pentecostals to Big doctors of divinity for their pastors some great man they've got just as much school and ritual as the Methodist or Baptist or the rest of them's got go into a church and you can't hear a amen just as cold as a bunch of uh Eskimos right off the North Pole amen cold indifferent and now the Philistines is on the Samson the Philistines is on the America where is that Oneness of spirit amen where is the Oneness of Pentecost Assemblies of God and the united in the Church of God and this that and the other each one with a different is and this one with that and this one with that we're so broke up to you can go into a city to hold a Revival of one Church sponsors the rest of won't even attend the commonness is up on the America where is our power where is our Glory what is it because we went after the wisdom of man instead of the power of God why we got our preachers and things are so stiff and starchy till they've organized us that we're so starch and stiff neck the people you never hear a shout in the church anymore you never hear any anybody cry the MERS bench is put in the basement there's no more glory in the [Music] church all we do is set back this as stiff as we can be we're not free we're bound the devil with his modernistic demons has bound the Church of the Living [Applause] God that's right there's no more power in the church there's no more freedom people so starchy and stiff while the God can come into the midst of Pentecostal people and show that he's God and prove his signs of his resurrection that don't even shake them watch a disgrace I walk across the country God working performing signs and people sitting well I guess that's all right oh I know it can be done it doesn't move move them why they're bound with delight of the world they in [Music] FS now if you got him into bound him into a confederation the Philistines are on these Samson what you going to do about him oh we've got great denominations sure we have greater membership than we ever had but where's the spirit where's the Holy Ghost that's what the devil has done it's wooed into the church it's kept wooing the church come to me I'll give you a great big Tabernacle over here if you'll just do this if you'll get rid of that fanatic preacher you got and get a man a doctor divinity's got some sense we'll build a nice big classical church and we'll be like the rest of them shame on you Amen brother have a man that didn't know uh split coffee from beans but was filled with the Holy Ghost amen that was uncompromised but the power of God but it's got us so starchy that some poor Saint can break through in the meeting and speak in tongues or shout a little bit or do something and the rest of them will all Gander around and look what was that well wonder why that must be a fanatic dropped in somewhere yes amen thank God you know that's the truth amen some poor Saint step in get happy enough to raise your hands and cry and praise the Lord somebody who will holler Amen to the preaching of the gospel and the rest of them turn around and see what he said that's Pentecostals Lord help what's the matter your pattern after the Methodist after the Baptist they pattern after the Catholic Catholic pattern after for hell and they all together all after hell right theia has wooi into big churches fine educated men ministers take the better class well you know so and so down here's a millionaire if we can just get him to come into our congregation oh my if he isn't borned again then he doesn't deserve to be there amen I don't care if he's got a million dollars if he owns 40 Cadillacs whatever he's got he's got to be borned again come right down to a new birth and be regenerated by the Holy Ghost and come out of there and a new burst snotting excuse me are crying and screaming and carrying all like the of him and live a life afterwards to prove he's got it amen hallelujah that's what you need Samson the Philistines is upon on Thee the Communist is upon thee the world's upon thee the devil's upon thee they go back and they see the spirit of God perform Miracles and do things of his resurrection what Jesus Promised they say you know I think think brother bram's got a lot of mental telepathy my pastor said it was of the devil you poor hypocritical diluted Infidel amen all polished up you wolf and sheep's clothes Jesus said if you have know me you have know my day but you've got a bunch of ss that try to make you like the rest of the world we want a bunch of man of God who don't compromise on the word but preach the truth and stand on the ISM of the Holy Spirit but what has the world done it shaved all your power off you were born Nazarite Pentecost but the world certainly shaved your power now it's just as starch as the rest of them what are we going to do what's going to happen there's one glorious thing that I can think of to end this text while Samson was bound we can't have a Revival listen to our loyal brother Billy Graham reviv in our day listen or Robert scream reviv in our day listen at the rest of them Reviving our day how can we have a Revival when we're bound amen we bound the holy spirit with our organizations and traditions and we can't have a holy ghost Revival here man I know that's scorching hot with the weather here but it's the truth how can we have a holy ghost Revival when you're so bound and starchy Farm of godliness the Bible said it have F of godliness but would deny the power thereof the power of what the power of the organization the power of the world the power of the church the power of the Holy Ghost that's the secred place in the church and when the church adopts educated preachers in big buildings and finery and instead of the oldfashioned Holy Ghost it better be in a mission again amen how you going to have a Revival of the Holy Ghost and people quench it and bound it in afraid of it there's where the trouble Li the Philistines is on the but the one blessed hope we have while Samson was in jail what's the first thing they've done when they caught him they bound him first they took his power away they found his secret they found your secret the world found your secret now you women all Bob your hair go it's like the world you men all go and act like the world it's all right tell jokes and dirty jokes and go out and smoke a few cigarettes and run out with the neighbors wives and everything else like that a little sociable drink to hold your job I'd rather lay on my belly and eat sod crackers and drink Branch water and stay clean and pure before God then the compromise for any kind of a job right thank you true stay true to God Samson the Philistines is on thee brandom Tabernacle whism is creeping in among you what about it have you exposed your secret have you exposed that secret that God give you when you were watering there in the sought us a few years ago have you let it creep out the social formal worship my God what's happened to you God can come down and perform a miracle and go right down to the audience and tell people the secrets of their hearts and everything and heal the sick and Afflicted and do signs and wonders and preach his word as hard as it can by the Holy Ghost and people say well I guess that's all right we enjoy listening to it once in a while we're not too tired that's brandom Tabernacle amen the Philistines is on the what used to be when the preaching of the word and the old Saints with the tears in their eyes would rise to their feet and walk sobbing maybe not saying a word just walking around two or three times and sit down so filled with the Holy Ghost the word fedom amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Philistines is on the brandom Tabernacle Philistines is on you Pentecostal of course the Philistines got you rest of you long time ago when you organize yourself so tight nothing can come unless you was a presbyterian Baptist Methodist Catholic or something you wouldn't have nothing to do with the rest of them so Revival in our day how can we have it when the regular Revival Giver is Bound By The World God won't come in where the world is you can just depend on that you associate with the world then it's it's all of it when you let the world creep in you go to act in act the world then you are finished but when you'll cut loose every fet from the world and come to God God will use you until you go to flirting again here's the only hope that I have this morning to wind up my message is this while Samson was bound a new shock of hair grow down God send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the spirit in Mark 16 can follow the church amen Acts 2 and 4 acts 238 all of it will be following right along with the church signs and wonders accompany the apostles great signs of his resurrection accompany him while we're in prison surely God's growing a crop somewhere for the last great kill amen may it be you my Christian friend here this morning may it be your strength has begin to grow I pray that this message this morning and out into the land of where this will go I trust that this message will help bring the vitamin to your system that'll grow a spiritual power back into your life again Amen Let Us bow our heads and pray oh Lord God creator of the heavens and the Earth the author of everlasting life and The Giver of every good and spiritual gift take these words this morning and place them into the heart and water them Lord May the people pray over these things seeing that the world has woed the church and has finally found its power found its secret place found were it its secret lies and a shaved it off has taken the peoples that once shouted the victory once had the Victory and has shaved them off to stay home on Wednesday night to watch a television program taking the joy out of their hearts and given more love for the world than they have for God has given more world for worldly more desire for worldly entertainment than to have the preaching of the Gospel if there's not a great band in a L of carrying on and hooping and carrying on then they don't want the old gospel anymore that brings tears of joy to the soul that brings Divine Healing back that restores the apostolic gifts to the church that brings in the Risen Christ the Messiah of this day but as Israel was bound by by their kings that they could not follow the real king and their real King when he came they didn't recognize him so is it today oh Lord the king of glory has appeared in the form of the Holy Ghost and Lord they don't know it they don't recognize it they're so organized so tight that they do not understand it because it's not in their organization Lord this is a work of the devil that's done this to the people may the Samson of God May the true in heart those who are longing and crying and pleading and holding on May they stay with the Lord until this new crop grows out until there comes forth again a joy in Zion and there comes forth a group that can recognize and understand that can see the Messiah and the hidden Powers that's hid from the world that they will not understand now Grant Lord that they'll see this for we ask it in Jesus name amen amen just now oh oh Lord send the power just

this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as he drinketh in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he comes
