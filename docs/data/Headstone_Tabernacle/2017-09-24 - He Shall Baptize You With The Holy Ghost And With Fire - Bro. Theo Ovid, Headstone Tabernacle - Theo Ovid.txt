amen amen god bless you we want to welcome but a masculine on don't god bless you my brother good to see praise me so before you have your seats let's go straight into the scriptures and this morning gonna be especially I know and the minister into you also next week next week Sunday we have two services the communion next Sunday so we want to look and turn our Bibles to Isaiah chapter six and we want to read from verse 1 to eat and also Luke chapter three one verse verse 16 let's have a water prayers before we read the scriptures Almighty God we thank you for this time of worship on the atmosphere of us generated by the songs were in thought and now as we approach your word the angel of your presence come and father take me out of the way and speak lip to ear to your people may this

we ask it email him and god bless you high up the six wanna read from who's one to eat and then we look to Luke chapter 3 verse 16 god bless you welcome and God bless all was connected to us on the Internet greetin's and the person's name of Jesus read in Isaiah 6 verse 1 in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the Seraphim each one at six wings with twain he covered his face with twenty covered his feet with trained he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is a Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I Boris me farm undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this had touched my lips and I an iniquity is taken away and I sin purged also I heard a voice of the Lord said whom shall I send who will go for us then said I here am I send me from looped up to tree one verse verse 16 John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I comment the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord well greetings from the Brethren in Guyana we had a tremendous time in Guyana for a gorge kindly and with a pterence of it but he Williams and myself we had our L less time cost and Guyana passes and greetings also I heard from but Isaac praise the Lord a night and you from by Isaac this morning and they have a tremendous time going on in South Africa they're speaking about four hundred people but five hundred showed up so he has one more service and badly that would say was going on right now but had a tremendous time this morning and he said that he didn't even have to make our water Corp he was heading towards the altar so I know the Lord is working mightily and we just stand board for that so this morning I have something upon my heart and this service our next service gonna be special services and we look to see what the Lord will do among us our title this morning the title is on the script we read in Luke 316 title is he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire he that's your promise he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire a nerve an inspiration cleansing fire fire from the altar as my special cleansing fire fire from the altar so I am not expecting this to be the regular bit of things I'm looking for the fire of God amen that cleansing fire of God that is what is promised but Isaac he were a powerful inspiration last Sunday but God in your heart and have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and you should guard your heart so powerful thought that your heart all it could do is reproduce the seed sown on it that's all it does you put an evil see there it produced after it's time you put jealousy inside of it it just produces whatever you put the choice is yours that's where it come down to your will your desire your choices are so what goes in your heart and even Jesus said be careful how you hear free is good a lot of people either hear everything confusion all that stuff but you want to hear the right thing because you want to guard your heart to get the right seats in your spirit in your mind in your soul amen that's why the Bible said will receive an acquisition against and held up accept you of two or three witnesses because they will receive it it goes right into your heart and then you get an attitude towards this one on that one you receive a gossip it comes into your heart and then you're negative to what somebody that that didn't do nothing but you don't know why I don't like them why against them but something struck inside your heart so you have to guard your heart it is serious amen it is very very serious I've see people on track and they go off track because of what they receive in their heart oh praise the name of the Lord so he is very important what happens in this thing called the heart not so much the head you know the Hat is the real you oh praise the name of the Lord the head could sweet this way that way because somebody see this and see that and you're you're sweet but really deep none is what's inside of here isn't that right and that strange enough the first parable Jesus give was the parable of the sower and the seed he said some fell under we say some fell on good ground some fell in the torn and so on he give the whole story and they say what are you seen he explained the power of the earth and he said the parable is this the seed is the word and is what kind of heart will produce what will praise got a good heart a good ground produce a good that we reproduce the seed God want to bring forth fruit and that is why he bring his word as a seed and the devil his job is to get you disconnected from that seed but what about her alien the rebel only produced was in the seed the most important thing is the seed the rain is coming you laughter fuss about it you laughter Wanda about it green is guaranteed because he said he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire fires coming poorly oceans coming the rain is coming but make sure you have the right seed because every seed will bring forth after its you see for himself cannot stop the life of that seed from coming forth a mango could never produce tomatoes freeze got an orange tree can never produce a lamb or something like that it has to produce after its kind and there's a son of God came hallelujah praise God you will be seated praise God we belong to certain kind a certain species hallelujah upon the earth for glory that will have the Serpent's it came in at this son of mine Cain it have the Eva Kane but it have the right just Cain also uncover not that the righteous perish with the ungodly so what have to send some angels to get you out gotta send message or to get you out one of the sin sons and servants to get you out if you do hear one you will send another one it's one job done daddy will Reiser another one nothing will stop you from coming into a full manifestation of what God has ordained for you to be [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated Prince Karl praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah four hundred plus years of silence 400 years of pots and traditions and churches and message churches and books and tapes but a man called John the Baptist step out of nowhere he is John the Baptist he were repaired for the kingdom of heaven is at hand I ain't seen nothing yet I am feel nothing yet I know nothing yet but one thing I know I was sent to forerun Messiah and Messiah is on his way that is one that is mightier than I I come to unknown just coming I come to suck a trumpet I come to shudder on desire I come to blow up drunker than the mountain or give the Lord a shout [Applause] sometime in your life God will interrupt your normal some point in life God will interrupt your normal where are my sickness where am I debt will abide separation we're in a hospital whatever God's gonna take you're going to interrupt your normal your quiet your ordinary will be interrupted your ideas your feelings your emotions what do you think how it's supposed to be watching your night what is not this and you're fine so I'm going to interrupt [Applause] [Music] John says is one common who shoes I'm not worried unlike John is in yet and you know he's coming so he had the spirit of prophecy upon him he has the testimony of Jesus is prophesying the messenger is coming he said he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire John was unfallen and full until one day says one standing among you there was you have to be here dynamics has to be around not when we are so far down the road oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah we can travel all these miles and him we are get gray hairs in we are holding on to these promise and then the back is not been done by Jerusalem veil no we here long time for this promise we have been true battles we have been up and down and in and out but we are still here that's what the devil of the deal with but we are still here we are going nowhere because we started not the promise of God we flop with rose wives we fail in our husband we had this happen that happened but the promise no way we believe God I'm taught that life okay the Lord are soaked in the house yes Stella Gila let me see that the Prophet said when I am born healing is not gone when I am gone deliverance is that God when I am born the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not gone the Prophet gone by the angel he's on the earth now praise God Oh God now it for next week Sunday listen to this where the Branham was send to introduce somebody he was sent to introduce that mighty one the great one Oh hallelujah he wanted to who that one is not one an old man from somewhere we may be seasoned that great one that veteran came to introduce because he came in the spirit of Elijah to introduce the Messiah that great one is a mighty one of Revelation 10 I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven Lord with a clown that was Jesus Christ he came to introduce Christ you have to stop a see Jesus like a church and as a church you have to start to see Jesus and if you start to see Jesus give it a walk different giving a talk different living on us and Jesus come to be with you because you are his wife become to walk with you become the taught me to become to live with you become to step into your sixteen elements [Applause] hallelujah we believe that this morning Oh hallelujah so the last that was preached in here I was talking about the three realms humanistic realm divine revelation and vision majority people live in the humanistic ground that the realm and your feelings get hurt this one upset here and you got problems and I get fined about that your humanism that's nothing to do with divine revelation of God isn't that right so when John come John nothing after I'm at all in a remote divine revelation and vision so he come out of the wilderness and blasts and left right I said like a man when I kept playing on could shoot and everything in sight and say listen somebody's coming I got the clay away for this man and he when Jesus came on the scene we know the story he says behold the lamb of God and that that word behold the lamb of God it changed from the prophet to the prophecy this is where a lot of people miss it they miss the transitioning from the Prophet to the prophecy so they can't handle us because we are in the prophecy of the prophet and the wonders the same profit profit profit profit profit but the perfect what a prophecy and when you step into your prophecy you step into your position you step into your calling you stop into your anointing you step into your fate but you step into your hallelujah is not what the Prophet did so much but it's what the prophesy will be for example the Bible said with stammering lips and another tongue and speak to his people and with the prophecy Jesus never stagger Jesus never do this and do that no but when they went in the upper room that happened and they said this is that that the Prophet spoke so you have to watch what the Prophet spoke because he have his word to fulfill what sort of you you want your work to fulfill and you have to find your scriptures William Branham at the fight Malachi for William Branham at the fight lead 7:30 William Branham at the fire revolution 10 7 you have to find your scripture even Jesus went into the temple and find a scripture for Isaiah 60:1 a set of spirited upon me he had to find that structure to identify his state to identify his time to identify his message you and I have to be seen we are not from Rita's age we are having a horse-and-buggy age we are in this age and we have to find our structure [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I was the devil job to confuse people and tie people up and mess up people's mind that they miss their time season and age so when the wise men came on board where is he born King of the Jews and I thought everybody Shelton and dancin and jumpin in Jerusalem everybody tells a doornail church is still there people still preaching no revelation no Fischer no expectation they just they just in the message of Moses message and three wise men not even Jews they come from India three wise men travel for two years said we have seen a star in the east and we come the end of the criticize react up the question we are gonna scratch ahead I wonder I wonder boy I wonder boy no we have seen this park and there is and we talk [Applause] or get the locks on praises this morning what what you come here this morning saw here something whoops keyhole go back five minutes search gets true okay the Lord show Jesus said woman yo are coming now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth [Applause] nada the Bible speaks about the worshiper once perched I shared with you that the four angels the four guardians of the truth with a spirit the face of an ox man LAN and Eagle and they also represented also much in Mark Luke and John but Obama said if the match of Mark Luke and John God's the book of Acts Luke was the man John was the Eagle all inscriptions and even the tribe of Israel three tribes and each insane isn't that right well I'm Arab Anna isn't that right but anyhow but Rama this girl recap a little bit the cherubim was placed dear to God the way back to the tree of life that was the objective when Adam fell they put Charles to God that at that tree liceman partake of that tree in that condition and Barham says that is what it was a card the way of the Tree of Life and who is the way Jesus is not right they were garden and reflecting with the fire of God the way to the Tree of Life no there's a way back to the Tree of Life and that's is what you must be interested in you must be interested in the way back you see if you fell on your fall you want to find out how to get back on track God doesn't condemn amantha is sin you can have mine first in innocent because there is always are we back there is always a way out and if in your heart you don't know to get oh just having a desire to get out is that this is a blessing myself you blessed just to have a desire I want out I want to come back I want to get back where I belong [Music] [Applause] [Music] now I want to show you that it's an altar this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden and I'll tell you why do you remember Canaan ever come up to worship what that would worship so that shows that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar and Trudie altar it's the only way back that is why the first thing the repent you say if you have a aught against somebody make it right then come to the altar and you'll find out where the presence of God hath and the only way back to Eden by the altar here you go again see back to Eden to the altar and they were to keep that way and guarded they couldn't get back until the altar was covered with blood he said Oh God can't people see it nothing but the blood it has to be in a torment so understand is you can't do anything to redeem yourself you can't I never lie I never steal another cheat you never never never regret the hell which I never because it was born in sin shame in the fatigue all you want to see his blood you just want to look blood the blood but [Applause] I feel inspired this morning and listen it is got that justify it [Applause] give me come on come on it is never man that testified he did this she did this you know bad years you know body is forget that I just got that justified that's why Jesus did not say whom I'm set free is free indeed he's a who the Sun man orchid Elisha be streaming the author we are supporting in this place who the Son of Man set free is free indeed [Applause] my god that's why that's why you can't explain how Jesus could tell a woman who was caught in the act of treason what no still news know this was fresh act this was fresh on Facebook this was fresh news and he's a woman neither do i condemn you go and sin no more you know I release you by the power of grace by the power of blood by the power of Who I am im3 you there are no accusers you could live higher and you belong to a higher species I'm higher I come to show you a level going oh come on oh come on oh come on oh come on you can live ha I'm today you can live higher you can live higher than that I want to write in on that mr. Borden's circumcised Abram and Bible said gave and believed God and were circumcised Allah no no no he wants exercise so instead of he believed what foods and what part is circumcision to confirm his faith so it was not even hot fan we believe God so anytime someone come negative here is that they believe that he they believe Sarah and Sarah condition he believed God when you watch Syria chronitons back water talk to Sarah so Sarah have battles and fights but ever have believed God because God spoke to him woman I heard his voice he is coming fire transformation my body will have to be changed you will have to be changed but he is coming [Applause] now you may be seated I know when they get them stronger you see when you're mock getting less brace and whatnot ameri-ghen Rica when they've worn a silence I know yet stolen you're almost there five feet twenty nine five and a half feet is six feet just over a barrier because never the virus air Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was sure what's going on strong in faith [Applause] so when when you have to get strong and thick prism praise them in the morning from the rising of the Sun to the corner of the street his name is to be praised [Applause] I'll keep that not even have my back dump them them serifs the NIT holy my holy holy Lord God Almighty we want to join him this morning we want to join that most famous man we want to join those harasses he wanna join the banner before the throne of God [Applause] what shimmery seize it whoa the only thing will enter into the gates of Eden will be true the blood of Jesus Christ so stop trying to patch up you please stop trying to well some kind of thing on because the espys missing back so I'm trying to buy church to the Rockies are opening the close of your interpretation Adam try that and God see to it because a clause was fig leaf at that time so his fig leaf couldn't hide that he was off-track she let the blood splash on you let us righteousness cover you and have confidence in his blood to cover you when you can't cover yourself let his blood over you because he hears your voice to that blood when you feel like it or you don't feel like it it is still true it is only when you cross over if that was the day you in trouble but as long as that blood is over you have an opportunity and what is hoping your repent what is hoping that your turnaround but is hoping as a make things right God is hoping that to get reconciled but what is this Trustin that you have a desire to get back on track notice Cain and Abel both boys come up to the gate to worship it must have been God's altar before this altar they built a substitute Jerry another altar but is the true author of God and it is in the heart of man you talk about a man who when different churches what not about four different five or this man was a diplomat to the presidents of four or five different presidents he said brother Branham one night I come to a meeting and I didn't know what to do he said I still owed him I said oh I love the Lord all my life I've think about s-phase up an Essbase pool opium and I thought I know the Lord and one night I look around I didn't know what to do and I wouldn't go in for nothing I heard the wood coming forth and it began to come I began to walk up and down on the outside of the tent walking back and forth and said directly I couldn't wait to get to the door i crawl under it the tent when the altar call was mean and run to the altar and fell down and said Lord I am a sinner and then he filled me with His Holy Spirit big diplomatic word okay on the 10t speaking to him and then when he couldn't hold Chuck on the tent and come check the altar say Lord I am ah ah I'm going filling that sinner I want to sit that inside of there what he'll back sinner I want to say that I hope it reach somebody God fill that sinner with the Holy Ghost water still fill sinners Oh glory of God you could keep your goody two-shoes but God the stencil sinners but you have to recognize your condition and when I got caught up in the presence of God my vision saw the Lord High and lifted up when that heaven is a war with me he don't want nobody else here cussing his neighbor here arguing some elders on pasta he had questioning some deacon he come into the presence of God and when you come in a prison or Deborah the questions you only recognize your condition you can't recognize somebody else who I hear with this enough or given glory people hallelujah praise God praise God praise God so this sinner went to the altar and God filament Holy Spirit the angel regarded them with cherubims notice another evidence was bringing here Cain went out from the presence of the Lord from the gate of the gun virus agreement or from the presence so he said then the presence of Lord must have been at the altar the altar was at the gate so the presence of course a once you make that altar you could get caught presence right there once you could recognize the condition in your situation you're not pretending you for real God could deal with you oh my is not right so the altar was at the gate it was quote spell in place Cain went out from the presence of God isn't that right now the veil you know he said now by one spirit we are baptized into the body the body of Christ by one Holy Spirit who comes in Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecost I was sure ever will not message people also I am dead dead dead religiously did we're not talking about that we're talking about so ever will but it's a butcher named

walking a woman is reflect Elisha category he warn't going to down gambling dens and carry on it won't go to 9 in the world he's got his heart set on fire so that's what a prophet said when you receive the Spirit of God when a man gets seed he said the light that comes into him is about a little like a little white button on my shirt that is when God comes into the inner part of man into that heart and as you surrender more that light expands so it's not the other side more light you have to be able to make room for that light to grow into your life into your actions and attitude and your pian until you are controlled by the power of that light within you your flesh subjects ourselves to the light of the holy spirit isn't that right then God's coming to the heart which is the spirit and then and then and see a little white button starts in his heart when he's born again God's Spirit dwells in him and he can let that spirit grow here we go and take all all the root of bitterness and press gorge way back again and he can come back in the same condition he was when he was in the Garden of Eden and brother Branham demonstrated that because his life took him right back to the Garden of Eden that he gets a little fishy I give you back your life son come on sunshine for days he was demonstrating this power that Adam had that Jesus had is now on the edge has been restored more than that the book or the deed or the title that Adam had is not only it and in God I came across so simple this whole Bible is about the story of an inheritance as God has left it's a D that was wrapped with seven seals around it and he come to reveal this thing to bring back what it had before so Adam had this book or this deed or this title and he lost it so it went back to the hands of God all God has done to the ages is bring his book back that when his book is back the Paul is back the anointing is back eveness back the sons of God are back that's a story entire Bible this word to mean if such inside of you it's the complicated it is simple God wanted to reveal himself he was just too mysterious so he released Jesus Christ which is the mystery of God revealed I know you will be the mystery of Christ revealed or get a lot some praises people so as Jesus unveiled God you will unveil Jesus okay the Lord a shout ho let me see that right now how many understand so then he said take the blood of mine out and you're putting the blood of Jesus and that brings the face of Jesus the filter of Jesus so put on a scene and one day go gonna put you on his theater put any operation theater and there be a blood transfusion your blood will come out Jesus blood coming in and you're gonna live like Jesus you're gonna walk like Jesus you're gonna talk like Jesus you can act like Jesus it will be just like Jesus there will be breast of his flesh and bone of his bone [Applause] - oh man let's go from future home but the Branham says that nor they baptize it with water then Jesus blood can be sanctified to clear it and Satan came to try to tie up Jesus that Jesus will get back the earth without purchasing it with the death of the cross with the blood but watch the earth is to get a baptism of fire and God come to sanctify the church with the fire of God the bernal all the filth and common dwell in the human heart that filth and so on is in the human heart line adultery fornication is in the heart back there that's coming from so the fire comes to pulling that off but take a firebomb and church inside your heart and that explodes and blow up everything else and then he steps inside of there and sit down on your chair and the altar of your heart or get a lot some praises people so let me say it plainly he will be sees it when you're born you're born with mr. sneak in your heart that's this born in sin shape iniquity nice baby nice child very nice try chuckle ooh and so on that's fine but after that when I tried cider grow snake is here look at just this makeup you can put whatever it is it's in the heart are you with me no then because behind that snake have a seed that snake is there because of nature now because your mother do something or your father do something never do nothing that just how we were born with snake I do hope it together literal snake you know all right people tasty and sneakers in sneak right when you're here you would know and give your faith to believe God you want to repent your repent they get baptized at you in the bathrooms you seen but it Snickers till then stay and moving except fire come every day and Jesus thing don't you pull y'all don't kill pull it out the dust getting wet fire fire come on somebody say fire fire one more time fire what promise fire [Applause] ah comes to burn the single human be season so I okay it was a doctor sink dragon Ben's sneak lawyer sleep president sleep president of America ski President of Russia sneak everywhere [Applause] she nice snake he very nice stick he not nice until fire come inside our deal okay the law from prison [Applause] if you understand that you will want that product to be five attacks you will want the product with the Holy Ghost with all the Holy Ghost he gonna live another holiness he gonna cheat whenever Allah does you will do this Tatiana but when fire comes change that man altogether let the brother same alright and one I wonder what he policy him and let the plan us amen what's all everybody's are you brothers in inland may be seated now you sisters who think you daddy's thinking I just want to reaffirm the brothers acknowledge and I say in the app to say mmm never leave this is a loan for now alright so the fire God come and pull out what is in a human heart no but a random says watch this baptism of fire that is the company is it's the burn of the disease it's the Blue Note sickness it is a burn the sinners the devil's is far from God and hear what the bomb that he says this program of redemption is not only to redeem the world we were living but redeemed the people who's going to live give the go through the same process people didn't know I just had a day and no water flooded but what I don't understand it was baptized with water to justify the earth so when nobody came God was on this way to redeem the earth so that was the first stage you get justified when you get baptized in water that's the first program then the blood of Jesus telling the earth to survive yet I'm coming back to fire then the Bible said I recently Liza before that terrible dreadful day of the Lord so the Prophet Malachi was saying fire coming but before that fire I'm gonna send prophet the call you are are you a new human be season and for any profit call you out you have to redeem the same way water blood and now John says he gonna baptize you with the Holy Ghost hundred fire so your fire coming he'll tell somebody it's coming tell somebody a suit [Applause] [Applause] it's common with it don't backside no don't give up don't let go with me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me read this here for you know what is shot by this morning and prayer struck me and this is where he and the bread becomes one and they go to the home in the new world and the same plan of redemption is used to redeem both the world and the person that lives in it now this is the part see the heart has to be cleanse like that before God can come down in the prison of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down to dwell in the human heart so this is the part the heart have to be cleansed like that not wash with the book I know what the prophecy and you want to argue and debate and question we're not talking about that we talked about this after the cleanse like that it's a way it has to be cleansed which is the fire this is what the churches don't want to preach because this is not the operation of man because man can bring fire it's fire of the altar God's altar is gathered Oh hallelujah Oh glory of God so we wanna go a little deeper this morning hallelujah to get that fire it's guarded most animals are just go and get it like that hallelujah this is elected have to come and get this fire this fire is for you when I took this bomb and the Old Testament was get to go in Noah's debt to steal [Music] is depth as the Autobots presence you want God's presence at the table on the job in the street a little eyes that say you don't want a part-time thing there's a full-time Christian there's a full-time job so the harder it becomes like that before God can come along and a person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart it first must be baptized in water to show it belongs to it will be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then holy fire and Holy Ghost from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin and all the needs of the world years ago I met a sister from another Church and talking and you know economy member mention about the Holy Ghost and so on but her testimony was I guess oh she's taught she said I'm Mary said be it done unto me according to thy wit and Mary conceived and performs Jesus say all right I say but then I see that say Mary went up in the upper room and she had was to get the fire then it says that she never see it so you see that's how she was taught she thought it done in Hollywood and finally concerned the hearing would read he would be willing them I was not a secret sister you need fire on that so if you don't know any fire not you would not purify not when you leave here you say no fire when you print you don't wanna normal crap good morning Lord in Jesus name Amen look over men work today lord thank you lord remember that no fire that's no altar thing whenever others call I'm bleeding all today they're looking for God to come down you after I feel listen I feel like 25a Jacob and Abraham and all these guys are then build physical altar you have the opportunity to call upon your God and let that sire come sup to see the fire in the field of anointing coming up as I begin to pray you're feeling your northern you know I was your pray until you come on come on oh not just say words I can hear your plan until you get you then you're moving in the presence you're moving into fire Oh glory to God amen so whatever I'm says the gospel was in that day's written in the world as history a painted fire what what was except the same see that they accept and it will become a living reality to you because it will bring you into the same experience that they had the same world why because the hot agar Isaac said is is ordained to produce whatever is shown inside of it so if you take the same seat Peter had and put it in your heart it must have the same results you must produce Christ it must produce that same condition isn't that right so the gospel video is not all together at the word this is the Word of God and all things must be based upon this world isn't that right but jesus said going to all over land preacher comes with every creature he did not say teach the word he said preach the gospel so the gospel consists more than teaching the word so many people locked in a mystery and the is itchin and this began a revelation boy and they have notes in writing and I never feel good at home I'm head hot and high that is not the gospel the Gospels when them same notes them saying word that is taught turn into fire turn into power that's why Paul said I didn't come back enticing words of man's wisdom but I come in power and demonstration of the spirit that to fit my rest not in land but in the power of God why would poor Sarah because if the man bring all these nice teachings and about who never had so greatest each alert then you're fitted in the man but if you begin to see the power the recognizing man is just a part of it alone one soul one water but God gave the increase God is the power master or somebody give a shout so the gospel is more than just word but demonstration of the Holy Spirit would come and demonstrate the gospel to bring the word to a living reality Superman will preach and afterwards he will say you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the image of the Lord then say he is here what is he talking about I'm not about to demonstrate the gospel because the baddest of the Lord Himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following so those guys render preach there was a consummation there was a backup the happiest when parabrahman resentment call somebody up and they take too long to respond he said up one just miss a healin imagine dynamics is there power is there AngelList air-cool is princess there and somebody like a dumb dog watchin say woman you have so and so and so and she she says just mr. heelas because she didn't respond God called you all can you every spun nothing for you you supposing for a man that's mines even hallelujah glory that's all you're supposed to be here hallelujah so email means so be it I let so be it to me I'm saying a man I'm a man I see remember somebody has eyes - I seen this Buddhist - this blessing this man's this power is much I say it man and the for peace a in hand and this one says hallelujah dispensatory hallelujah praise God right now the wings are flapping the saris want a mission to fire the saris want to move in the Spelman trying button 40 with fire but calls from of the altar of God [Applause] but Aparna then you must be born again and then the Holy Spirit quickens the word to you in other words like a grain of corn if it's lain in my hand is just a grain of corn but if I bury it it become contaminated moles and then bring up another greener corn just like it so but around said the gospel came to us not a word only but to the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost then jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature then he meant going to all the world and demonstrate the power of God to every creature and in order to preach the gospel you can make it a gospel preached then you've got to have the power that demonstrate the holy spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so this is not a ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men and that's the fate that I'm trying my best to contend for today that Jesus Christ listen is the same yesterday today and forever and his power is unlimited that means that means that means missing limbs to be restored [Applause] anything on one kidney from

Bannon I have prayed I have turned over new pages and everything else I just don't know what's the matter with me I kept just catching her spirit to see what was wrong you see I was just watching for a few minutes she said well no I'll tell you perhaps maybe you and I maybe you and I pray she said all right I said I said maybe you and I are three she said all right brother branham she got down and prayed and I said you prenup she said God and she prayed and prayed and I thought while she got up she looked at me she said well better Branum and I put my hand on her shoulder and said god bless you sister she raised up and said I believe it's all over now she said I'm gonna go there and tried to live a different life I said sister you will go out and live the same life you lived you were just turning a page it is not right yet let's pray some more we got down and we kept praying and after a while she struck something my it change yes sir from a little kid packing on a music till it went on making music it got some rhythm in it after a while she got to really prayin and after a while she began to scream and the tears running down and painted cheeks like that directly when she raised up them big brown eyes looked at me and said brother branham something happened I said yes sir yes sir she is married she's got she owe four children now what was it she took God and steered with it until something happened something taking place the living world became a living reality to her or give the Lord some praises you love that story you were blessed with that testimony hallelujah praise God if he had leave away she will go back up prostitution go back to life but it's a stay hold on pray until something happened and something happened Oh glory to God God completely revolutionize and change my life so when God plans has promised in you and it becomes a living reality then something is different you just don't go and say yes I believe it that's all right that definite leave it like that but it's confirmed to you the wood becomes our life you then you begin to see what it is God has always feel himself behind something so the people that also world will not know nothing about him but he reveals himself there's children and to those who are willing to come from behind that feel isn't that right praise God so quad was veiled in that batchest batchest skin behind human skin his dearest whether she kind of glorious his days when the wood is here when I want to get you know but a Branham said is here Ephesus means relaxed the high aspiration have a compound means calm permanent mean a man of relax the high aspiration of this age that have been fought with had the fullness of the spirit the depth of God they begin to give way to a less watchful attitude unless odd and fallen of Jesus Christ begin the manifest itself as an omen in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink into the awfulest depth of satan it had become relaxed and was drifting already the age was back straightening it has left his first love the ephesians age have presented to her the opportunity for God's best and after while she prevailed then relaxed and that unguarded moment Satan planted the seed of complete ruination so you see a comma for to get relaxed keep aiming act a perfect Church keep a pen at the Holy Ghost keep aiming at the BRIT truth don't take your family for granted don't take your children for granted or take nothing for granted hallelujah have to fight go well you relax in the devil working his brains out that I can sneer and destroy you and your family oh give the love some praises people are you with me let me know [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Applause] are they skip the church would soon give over to the leadership of man with man spans man ambition and thus sayeth the Lord thus said the Holy Ghost would no longer be our living reality and underneath damn with temper slaves who had no choice but to be in obedience to the religious hierarchy so the hardest big system is not right and in lady under there and human leadership would enslave the laity while their leaders logs erosion in ill-gotten wealth and enjoy the filthy pleasure or praise the name of the Lord oh my my mind Oh glory to God so I just kept it on I wanna kind of wrap up okay I know he's been some time but I hope you enjoying the word and this is pretty soon you still have some macaroni pile some sliced chicken breasts roosted create the name of the Lord so Iran went in once a year this glory days she kind of go reflector each other glory and so on and I want skip you know he said no you see he had to make a noise you know even at best direct understanding on a group when he will say there you know just in case here come on canoe monk a green Saturday you know like that Tony a special man otherwise that idea so in case he a commodity group limo so yeah bells ringing there right so when Iran do is sacrifice and comical and heavy bells ringing they could rejoice because we have forgiven for one year listen to what the purpose in you know the only way the congregation could tell he wasn't dead was because they hear noise and I tell you when the church lets off its noise there's something happens because everywhere the Shekinah glory is there is noise [Applause] [Music] so this hand Greenup think so on nana shine like nano Shekinah glory thing wherever decided o'clock Shekinah glory is there is noise one time he said no God no noise wherever there is God there is noise hallelujah you know in the Old Testament to enter behind that skin was dead no to stay away from behind it is dead to enter into his glory was that not a story from his glorious dead to stay out of his presence is dead always followed that one who is influenced and is backed up by God and you know where God is with them don't follow the wrong influence alright we coming down to the home stretch here now so the story read what Isaiah Isaiah and we find out that Uzziah died because he have tried in prison it ministry and so on and go struck him dead with leprosy and Isaiah run into the temple I began to pray and Bernsen sometimes go and let the very prop be knocked from under us something that sickness strike us the disappointments heartache strike or somebody left he does that to get you where he will you be influenced by the gospel and be wise enough to touch it don't be stupid enough to walk away from it so watch Isaiah know he must find something different so what did he do he went to the temple he raised his hands he cried to God he sent a vision as Ana felt the vision he saw true hand lifted up and he saw the seraphim's flying and the seraphim's mean burners somebody taught about burners okay that's what I serve him out there burners here where they are it is next to the altar actually the seraphim's is the one who received the sacrifice and cleanses the worshiper and then presents them to God so in the spirit realm when you are the altar when you worship and and so on the seraphim's is one who want to take it to the next stage that's happening the spirit realm you feel that fire on your philia anointing the Seraphim doing his work to give you a preparation to bring you higher into the presence of all-mighty God and the seraphim's was like angelic beings and they had a very next 1ch to God right at the altar is not big God the undies surface remember in some traditions they guard the gospel on either side and they were back in the Eden they guard the altar now watch Christ never died for them seraphim's they were created beings he never died for angels he died for sinners he never died for holy people that's what unholy how long you think your holy never done no you no good when you realize you are nothing then he died for you when you realize you are nothing you are the one who died for God is holy there is nothing but holiness and Hebrews 12:14 follow after peace follow peace at all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord Sam's 29 to give the Lord the glory do you want to his name worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness Bible described those angelic beings with two wings cover their face to its cover defeat Tuatha dé fly and the probably revealed are the two wings covering their face watch he said notice he said I wonder it was reference the two wings over the face reference reference I wonder my brother if we look at that when Holy Angels has the cover their faces stand the presence of God in reference and respect but today we find people who call ourselves have no respect at all for God his word his people or his ministry nothing if I go we all on the same plane only similar I mean this one that one down your army anything anything it's not like that sir God demands respects we need to come in more a reference a risk reverent attitude and then what I'm speaking a little bit you talk about I'll just go back at this next quote there was angels there are serums and their turbans and Sarah Faris is the one that actually is bring the burners the boon of the sacrifice making the way for the sinners approach a real high order of holiness and he saw he was not at the altar praying lord of monumental lips and making confession and when he did he saw these seraphim's two wings over their faces holy holy Lord God Almighty he was reverent in his presence isn't that right and listeners back when everybody think they are so secure they get irreverent that's why sometimes money destroys people because they have money in the pocket and it okay about nobody else they have no Putin for nobody because they figured secure they feel an anchor and what they in and so on like that so sometime got pulled off from under you and recognized you do have this if you have that that you could call upon courts name your struggle true and what enjoin you struggling because you know you will destroy yourself if too much is given to you before you could manage it oh how are you with me now so what their minds so people might get so perverted they taken the things of the world they don't even pay attention or more they go to church but they don't realize you in the presence of God not only in church not only in church here we go wherever you are you and the presence of God that's my David said I put the Lord all for my face if I shall not be moved David was conscious of the presence of God with him so you got because of what president going to bow and take a drink that makes no sense if you're conscious you see a man that's do things and they figure out that around he is seeing a guru I'm God I big big big unusal but you're not conscious where brother branham you said they were provided with two wings and you are provided with something to the build of Jesus that you're covering you don't stand in the seraphim's you don't stand of the cherubim you stand as an you don't sound as an angel but you stand as a redeem son and daughter by his blood do you don't have to have these rings that they have they are covering for them in that presence but you got a blood of Jesus it's not rice notice with two wings a cover their feet what's that humility like Moses take off your shoes the place you are holy ground he said he has a good example be conscious of your littleness not your bigness be conscious of your lip earnest not your bigness today we are Americans we try to think we are big somebody we belong to this we looked at this big organization and so on like that he said be conscious of your littleness and thirdly with two wings he could fly there's still two the wings no you put himself into action he could fly with him two wings so then watch first face over the face reference over the feet humility the wings in action it showed the Prophet how his prepared silver must be he must be reverent he must be humble and he must be in action could the church say Amen I'm almost done so bear with me now a man that serve God and prosper you sire and was fine and he perished because I shall do something God didn't call him to do as I a shortest a man is a finger but if I'm saying this to begin with I think who he is he is born in sin me iniquity coming towards pick a nice so he's a total failure I don't care he's a bishop a Pope a press whatever whatever he is he's a fill to begin with don't ever look to one I don't care don't move monkey with faith though he give all his body to be burned still look at Jesus Christ he is the one look to him and not some man so we find out a servant of God must be humble must be reverent and must be an action going to action many of us are humble many of us are Reverend is hard to get him in action so your fire wings are working your humble your everyone but you ain't doing that you ain't testifying you know witnessing you'll encourage somebody to come you know didn't bring in somebody you have to begin to do something isn't that right oh my I'm almost done so what happened he confess his sins and then come the cleansing you cannot be cleanse from your sin until you confessed its sin till you recognize it's in and then come the cleansing and got around said the reason the elected will not be see because they are the word they can't yell nothing else they know nothing else Jesus a perfect fit because he was the world and you become the word as you receive the word Oh while you with me now praise the name of the Lord Harlen and if you you have got to get the living wood in you to have the Living God in you because the wood here is God when it's make flesh in you mid spirit and life in you then it goes into your flesh and your feet praise God he is praying for mine only ones in the end time cleanse our hearts Lord from all the filth of the world music come up please I stand ready for cleansing I stand ready with this church with all that is listening in whosoever will listen to this tape I stand Lord and ox for cleansing Lord take me to the potter's house break me up mold me I see what you want for Lord Jesus I'm a man of unclean lips dwelling with the people of unclean lips for worries me I see the revelation of God we may manifest as eyes I saw the angel in the temple I see the endtime Lord worries me and my family worries me and my people Oh eternal God have mercy upon us I plead for myself and the people let us not perish with those who believe not but may we live with the believers oh my hallelujah heavy denomination Lord every man woman I can't ask the Blessed denomination when I know you against it but I can only say Lord if you have any of your sheep of it among them may they hear this tape may they hear it alone and understand it with understanding he will give them and when they come out and receive you may they not be deceived by blindness and tradition of this day many not try to eat something that was a carcass of another day but I take your word oh my hallelujah praise the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus do you love him I'm close at last quote he never brought him a book talking about Isaiah a catechism Gor don't be pious servants my books and catechism he P appears a service by fire cleansing fire fire from off the altar he cried woe is me for I have done wrong I put my example my trust in a man and I see the order of Lord and he was cleansed with a cooler fire now isn't it wonderful how the man recognized himself to be a sinner and look how God did as soon as he recognized he was a sinner he confessed to being a sinner he confessed he is wrong and he saw that what God did and how he did it how he cleaned him by a cola fire not a declaration of Creed's not by a bunch of beads not by historical of fear he cleanse him with present cleansing living fire could we
