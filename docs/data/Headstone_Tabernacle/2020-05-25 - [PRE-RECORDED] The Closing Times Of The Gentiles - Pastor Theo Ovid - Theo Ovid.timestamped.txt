[16:25] Sunday praise God I was a real blessing
[16:28] to me and the city of Holy Spirit come
[16:31] now I think everything is coming in
[16:33] order by the grace of God I was waiting
[16:35] for years to come to this spot and I
[16:38] guess we are growing we are learning and
[16:41] we would do what God put up on our
[16:44] hearts I have myself at me praying for
[16:46] years to get our spot this begin to kind
[16:49] of get a peek at what God sees God
[16:52] that's the key thing we could try and do
[16:54] but if we get a look and get a peek at
[16:56] what God is seeing then all it transform
[16:59] our lives altogether because you're not
[17:02] looking through the eyes of man the
[17:04] control God's eyes because as are we God
[17:07] sees things there's a way God approach
[17:09] things we approach one way and water
[17:11] push a different way one time David that
[17:13] was asking the Lord and God tell him
[17:15] when he hear a rustle the mulberry tree
[17:17] then he know how to move because you
[17:20] want to know God is going in front of
[17:21] you isn't that right praise the name of
[17:25] the Lord hallelujah well this morning we
[17:28] looking for for a tremendous time in the
[17:29] Lord your Connecticut build-up to get
[17:32] strengthened together if I wonder also
[17:34] greet those on the internet some time I
[17:36] clean forget that the people who will be
[17:38] listening him certainly appreciate them

[17:47] for opening up our website you know that
[17:50] anybody could access it and be blessed
[17:53] and so on we feel great to be able to do
[17:55] that I know there are those who could
[17:58] try to dissect and figure out and
[18:00] scrutinize and put our messages on the
[18:02] microscope and really look for every
[18:04] fault they could find that's also okay
[18:07] because what we are preaching is for
[18:09] whosoever will if Pope Francis want to
[18:12] take a listen he and all particular
[18:14] listen this morning President Putin
[18:15] could take a share if you want to take a
[18:17] share this mind all that is fine but as
[18:19] a bride and the earth that nothing gonna
[18:21] stop that brand there's the people on

[19:14] Hana to just stick often when gods are
[19:17] to move you is shut the more than the
[19:20] critics free when courts not to move man

[22:21] getting closer listen I'm excited this
[22:24] is 2016 we are nearer than when we first
[22:29] believed
[22:33] Oh
[22:36] forty years ago 1975 I was an exciting
[22:39] seventeen-year-old believe in this
[22:42] message I want to hear but I send me
[22:49] these young men take this mission of
[22:50] sweep on the Camaro I told you stalking
[22:52] on me not that young man is 58 years old
[22:57] this year I could claim to be like
[23:01] Hitler just as strong as when I first
[23:05] started out but this my point is this
[23:07] we are belong in the vineyard waitin on
[23:13] the common of the Lord
[23:15] getting all Krrish asleep and gratefully
[23:20] [Music]
[23:20] [Laughter]
[23:24] I'm enjoying the Lord all this one's the
[23:28] greatest times of my Christian life him
[23:31] an onion be seated on Sunday a last
[23:34] service introduce Isaac as the assistant
[23:37] pastor I want you to share with you my
[23:40] authority to do such and from Tottori
[23:43] Brahms in order to the pastoral Neville
[23:45] at this time remember he's the full head
[23:47] of the church but it never has the right
[23:50] to exercise any authority that the Holy
[23:54] Spirit would tell him to see in other
[23:58] words in the church he has the right to
[24:01] anything that God would lead him to do
[24:03] he also have the right over his Deacon
[24:06] board he can change the Deacon board the
[24:09] trustees the pianist any other office in
[24:11] the church but he is asked to change
[24:13] feeling led of the Holy Spirit to do so
[24:16] what he does I will recognize it as he I
[24:20] believed to be a godly man
[24:21] I will also recognize it to be of the
[24:24] Lord and was sanctioned the same
[24:26] therefore it gives him the authority
[24:28] named to operate the church the way he
[24:32] feels led to do it or any office in the
[24:35] church that he desires to switch
[24:38] positions of people for he has the
[24:41] authority to do that
[24:44] which I trust that this will always be
[24:47] lovely and never have to be used also we
[24:53] believe into its government and the
[24:55] government is ordered of the holy spirit
[24:57] in the Bible the pastor is always the
[25:00] head of the church the pastor is always
[25:02] that's God's elder in organization you
[25:06] have to come to the bishop now there is
[25:08] no higher order in the Bible and the
[25:10] elder of the church just tell me where
[25:13] it's at
[25:13] there's no higher order in the Bible for
[25:16] the children and the elder which is the
[25:18] pastor he's the highest order of the
[25:21] Bible and if don't receive any
[25:24] accusation against your elder unless its
[25:26] first be two or three witnesses no
[25:29] matter what anybody says about the hell
[25:31] that don't you believe it until you have
[25:32] two or three witnesses and let them
[25:35] witnesses be tried first and then if
[25:39] that elder has done something wrong and
[25:41] these three Holy Ghost witnesses have
[25:43] been tried and proved that they already
[25:45] done something to the elder then go to
[25:47] the elder and that's in open rebuke that
[25:50] others might see and take heed emails I
[25:53] sort of agree therefore you terrify you
[25:55] and I want to train you because that's
[25:58] what I'm supposed to do under the Holy
[25:59] Ghost to give you training but let
[26:01] nobody tell you anything about your
[26:02] pastor or negative or they find fault
[26:04] with a sufferer or if somebody shut them
[26:06] down in that you know you have no
[26:07] authority to go and see that have you
[26:09] spoken to the pasta make sure whatever
[26:11] you hear in ask the person did you speak
[26:14] to the pastor about that that's the
[26:16] first thing you have to do before you
[26:18] talk to anybody else speak to the pastor
[26:21] directly about that because we wanted to
[26:23] be on the world you don't want any
[26:25] spirits to come in now but a Branham
[26:27] said hear from African trip report there
[26:30] is something about New York City we are
[26:31] expecting a great leader in Africa we
[26:33] close one in New York and there is
[26:35] something about New York City now you
[26:37] watch remember there is something about
[26:40] New York City don't forget that
[26:41] he never said fall in New York City he
[26:44] said there is something about New York
[26:46] City don't forget that what you hear and
[26:48] and this is but a man and said that that
[26:51] there is following you he didn't set
[26:53] following New York and I did that I saw
[26:56] light
[26:57] shine on the word I saw better do the
[26:59] Coleman acquaint promises that no other
[27:01] minister was preaching at that time and
[27:03] the seven thunders and the Seventh Seal
[27:05] and my ministry and is there on our
[27:08] website considering that my testimony
[27:10] concern that he has been a mentor to me
[27:12] a teacher a help to me and put me in
[27:14] training which I receive I watched New
[27:16] York as Bertram said I saw the good the
[27:20] bad and the ugly I learn from the good
[27:23] had lead from the back and I learned
[27:26] from the ugly I learned not only what to
[27:29] do but what also not to do and it's not
[27:32] what we go through is what we learn from
[27:37] what we go through
[27:38] let me repeat that is not what we go
[27:40] through everybody goes through stuff and
[27:42] some learn nothing and if you don't
[27:44] learn you do and fall just the way
[27:46] others do one for you have to learn in
[27:50] other words failures is part of life go
[27:53] forth and feel it's a terrible thing for
[27:58] pastor to see no it's not because you
[28:00] will go forth and feel it's not so much
[28:02] the feeling is what you do but in that
[28:04] feeling it's what you learn from your
[28:07] feeling because well we'll let you feel
[28:09] to make sure you don't rest on the arms
[28:12] of man for example for example people
[28:15] are straining at the anointing that is
[28:17] in the church because we are not a
[28:19] legalist now the legalists and the
[28:22] message they wear do a chain the door
[28:23] dude is to depress they hear and
[28:25] everything else and I look to messages
[28:27] and so on like that but there's no
[28:28] anointing they're dead if legalism could
[28:32] have bring dynamics we should have had
[28:33] it already if beaten people in the
[28:37] submission on church or we have it
[28:38] already you can't judge this church by
[28:41] one individual and this is our tree kind
[28:43] of believers did I say so but a Branham
[28:45] said that so I don't know who is who I
[28:48] call everybody bright I supposed to do
[28:50] that I have no authority at all nobody
[28:52] don't want a shock no matter this no I
[28:54] do have that authority
[28:55] sorry or like a preachers don't worry
[29:01] hallelujah are you with me I don't have
[29:04] no authorities at this one time make it
[29:06] that one can't make it this one is a
[29:07] shot this one is not Chuck this was a
[29:09] sip and see this one is that I don't I
[29:11] don't know that all I know God saves me
[29:13] by His grace and I am under the blood
[29:16] and I'm grateful to God to be alive in
[29:18] the land of the living to see 2016 many
[29:23] people have written my age I'm grateful
[29:25] to God to be sober to be not mental
[29:29] [Applause]
[29:30] with all these half crap these spiritual
[29:33] dictators and puts in this message I
[29:35] escape all of them I'm a strong man
[29:38] maybe Donald Trump get training from
[29:41] some of them Donald Trump when he had a
[29:43] shoot on this one should he want to be
[29:44] on top so his job is to shoot this one
[29:46] dumb this one criticized this one cut
[29:49] this one or say it same thing about this
[29:51] one because you want to be on top maybe
[29:53] he'll in from them you don't know if
[29:55] comment on from how some meetings in
[29:56] this message and lien from some of these
[29:58] guys to get that approach but that is no

[30:27] potentially adopted not potential
[30:30] manifested they don't have that that no
[30:33] I don't have that all of us in potential
[30:35] they come like you're potentially rich
[30:36] you're not rich your potential even your
[30:40] patella of a crop that's potential until
[30:43] that crop comfort if a disease cut it
[30:45] off in Midway you have no crop it could
[30:48] be growing and disease come and wipe you
[30:49] all clean
[30:50] so then potential is gone so we're not
[30:53] talking about potential we're talking
[30:55] about this is my beloved son hear ye him
[31:02] not business my beloved son potentially
[31:04] no here he him the son went to stuff and
[31:07] now God is confirming this is my stuff
[31:09] this is my son
[31:11] so we said it in India and the message
[31:13] on India is on the website there's a
[31:15] FIFO ministry yeah and it's look at this
[31:17] affinity of the local church this is all
[31:19] their leaders inside idea but we said it
[31:22] but a Branham was born a prophet nobody
[31:25] didn't lean hands and lakid my prophet
[31:26] he was born a prophet and a he being
[31:29] born a prophet he was commissioned to do
[31:32] the work of evangelist and then he was
[31:36] confirmed to be a prophet there's got to
[31:38] be a task area where God assign you to
[31:41] check your attitude to check your
[31:44] response so Chuck your excuses because
[31:48] he God he's a progressive God he said
[31:51] let there create this and what we did
[31:53] first day the second day the third day
[31:54] the fourth didn't God said let us make
[31:56] man he's always doing something in a
[31:58] progressive way we see it second age to
[32:00] the age always doing something in a
[32:02] progressive manner
[32:03] God is not a deadbeat God he does said
[32:05] either when he rested his resting
[32:07] because it's already done
[32:09] just after unfold he could take over the
[32:11] Branham because it was already done when
[32:14] but Iran unless it was already done
[32:15] every seed that had was to be revealed
[32:18] was already revealed so he could have
[32:21] father takes his male prophet home and
[32:23] let the seeds just bring forth after his
[32:25] kind isn't in his time and it's season
[32:27] he said the seeds will fall in the hands
[32:29] of the predestinated look at where you
[32:31] come from
[32:32] look at this play where you come from
[32:34] and God had to find you God it doesn't
[32:36] matter who God use some of you Savior
[32:39] know and the people who invited you then

[36:52] et live
[37:02] and when you sit down I want you to keep
[37:03] the Bibles close to you we go via some
[37:08] scriptures we like to also continue to
[37:10] read Isaiah 63 verse 4 for the day of
[37:17] vengeance is in mine heart on the year
[37:23] of my redeemed is come Matthew chapter 7
[37:30] wanna read from verse 24
[37:39] therefore whosoever heareth these
[37:42] sayings of mine and doeth them I would
[37:45] like him unto a wise man which built his
[37:48] house upon a rock under rain descended
[37:52] and the floods came and the winds blew
[37:56] and beat upon that house and it fell not
[38:00] for it was founded upon a rock and every
[38:05] one that heareth these sayings of mine
[38:07] and doeth them not shall delight not a
[38:12] foolish man which built his house upon
[38:14] the sand the rain descended the floods
[38:18] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[38:21] that house and it fell and great was the
[38:26] fall of it and I came to pass when Jesus
[38:27] @m the D scenes the people was punished
[38:30] and his doctrine for it thought them as
[38:33] one having Authority and not as the
[38:36] scribes Revelation chapter 10 when I
[38:41] read from his heed the voice which I
[38:45] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[38:47] say go and take the little book which is
[38:50] open in the hand of the angel which
[38:52] stands it upon the sea and upon the
[38:54] earth and I went unto the angel and said
[38:56] unto him give me the little book he said
[38:58] unto me take it eat it up it shall make
[39:00] that very bitter but a shall be named
[39:03] out sweet as honey and I took the little
[39:05] book out of the Angels hand and eat it
[39:08] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[39:11] and as soon as I eaten it my belly was
[39:14] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[39:17] prophesy again before many peoples and
[39:21] nations and tongues and kings let us bow
[39:26] our heads with a prayer Heavenly Father
[39:28] we thank you for your word Lord your
[39:31] word is life Your Word is truth your
[39:33] word is a light Oh God
[39:35] shining our part that we could know
[39:37] where to place our feet inspire this
[39:39] message to the people Lord and may you
[39:43] give them inspiration and revelation
[39:45] that will drive them into a position to
[39:48] pray and to talk on the crown
[39:50] until you granted Lord in Jesus and I
[39:52] asked at him and he may be seated well
[40:02] have a title the closing times of the
[40:07] Gentiles I'll have an inspiration the
[40:14] time of the Gentiles and that word times
[40:19] of the Gentiles is taken from Luke 21
[40:21] verse 24 and Jesus was seeing this and
[40:25] they shall fall by the edge of the sword
[40:28] and shall be led away captive unto all
[40:32] nations speaking about Jews and
[40:34] Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
[40:36] Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles
[40:41] be fulfilled until the times of the
[40:48] Gentiles be fulfilled revelation 22
[40:54] verse 7 says behold I come quickly
[40:58] blessed is he that keepeth the scenes of
[41:01] the prophecy of this book and I John saw
[41:04] these things and heard them when I heard
[41:07] them I fell down to worship before the
[41:08] feet of the angel would show me these
[41:10] things then said he unto me see thou do
[41:13] is not for my a fellow servant of thy
[41:16] brethren the prophets and of them which
[41:18] keep the scenes of this book worship God
[41:20] he said unto me seal not the scenes of
[41:23] the prophecy of this book for the time
[41:26] is at hand he that is unjust let him be
[41:30] unjust till this is the time that gonna
[41:34] be at hand a closing time a finishing
[41:39] time a judgment and God said Isaiah
[41:44] vengeance is in my heart
[41:47] but the year of my redeemed has come
[41:50] it's a to folding its judgment the
[41:55] ceilin its vengeance plus redeemed we
[42:00] it's a 2-14 I will be going for is it
[42:04] that we need the judgment yes
[42:07] there's a quote where I'm said the only
[42:10] thing to see that is the judgment
[42:11] because the same real that knows we turn
[42:14] on the flow DIAC was the same read I was
[42:18] gonna drown the world the same Holy
[42:20] Ghost dynamics the power and everything
[42:23] you'll be looking for the cap off this
[42:25] church the brain is the same spirit that
[42:28] will bring judgment to the world so I
[42:31] want you to understand it's not my
[42:33] gimmick is not my chance it's not a
[42:35] random thing it's the thing that's
[42:37] cordoned the Scriptures might be
[42:40] fulfilled hallelujah see you not the
[42:45] sayings of the prophecy of this book for
[42:46] the time is at hand he that is unjust
[42:51] let him be unjust still we're just
[42:53] filthy filthy still righteous righteous
[42:55] still holy holy still behold I come
[42:58] quickly and my reward is with me to give
[43:00] every man according into his work shall
[43:01] be so you don't have to boast God will
[43:05] reward you every man according to your
[43:10] works your works will manifest and prove
[43:13] what you are isn't that right
[43:16] o blessed be he love him this morning Oh
[43:19] hallelujah praise be to Jesus if
[43:22] everybody's I like it attempted Daniel
[43:24] chapter 2 this is a context Shipshewana
[43:26] bring out Daniel chapter 2
[43:45] we know the story their comeback
[43:47] Nebuchadnezzar dream a dream and he
[43:50] forgot the dream he said the dream gone
[43:53] from him and he called his wise men
[43:56] switch sailors whole bunch of them and
[43:59] said interpret a dream they said no
[44:03] problem telesurgery he said gone from me
[44:05] and he said only to interpreted I will
[44:08] take on a head off cut Olien pieces he's
[44:11] all a better to poetry because that is a
[44:12] terrible dream they said be we can't do
[44:15] that never heard about that if you only
[44:18] tell us we're gonna interpret that he
[44:21] sold a plane for tang he said it has no
[44:25] more time
[44:26] tell me Lee dream and tell me the
[44:29] interpretation or your head is off and
[44:35] listen these things that play you know
[44:37] they said I decree he said wrong zapatti
[44:41] wise man and I saw Daniel get caught up
[44:43] in this thing then I want to know what
[44:45] he is why the king say they say the King
[44:49] see somebody is telling the dream and
[44:51] interpret Daniel said tell the king
[44:54] there is a God tell the King as a god
[45:02] that can reveal secrets give me a little
[45:06] time to talk to my god
[45:11] hold your hand all the destruction don't
[45:16] take the heads off yet because my god
[45:21] could reveal secrets even the one you
[45:27] can't remember my god let's go to verse
[45:34] 26 of Daniel chapter 2
[45:47] the King answered and said to Daniel
[45:49] whose name was Bertie shaza
[45:51] are they able to make known at the media
[45:53] dream which I have seen and
[45:55] interpretation thereof Daniel answered
[45:58] in the presence of the King unsaid the
[45:59] secret which the King had demanded
[46:01] Connor the wise men the astrologers the
[46:03] magician the suitors shown to the King
[46:05] but there is a God in heaven that
[46:08] revealeth secrets and make it known to
[46:10] the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in
[46:13] the latter days thy dream and the vision
[46:17] upon my head are these for thou for do
[46:22] King thy thoughts came and did I mine
[46:24] upon my bed what should come to pass
[46:26] Hereafter
[46:27] and he that reveal its secrets make it
[46:30] known to Z what shall come to pass as
[46:32] from me the secret is not revealed to me
[46:34] for any wisdom that I have more than any
[46:37] living but for there six that she shall
[46:40] make no leader petition to the king that
[46:42] thou mightest know the thoughts of that
[46:44] heart
[46:44] dull Oh King saw us and behold a great
[46:48] image this great image was brightness
[46:50] was excellent stood before thee and the
[46:52] form was terrible this image head was of
[46:56] fine gold his breast his arms of silver
[46:58] his belly of tithes of brass his legs of
[47:01] iron his feet part iron part of clean
[47:05] dough saw is still a stone was cuddled
[47:07] with all hands which smote the image
[47:09] upon the feet that were of iron and clay
[47:12] and bring them to pieces then was the
[47:14] iron the clay the brass the silver the
[47:17] gold broken in pieces together and
[47:18] became at the chaff of the summer
[47:20] threshing floors and the wind kyurem
[47:23] away that no place was wrong for them
[47:25] and the stone that smote the image
[47:26] became a great mountain and filled Jolla
[47:29] this is the dream we will tell the
[47:31] interpretation thereof before the king
[47:34] so diamond is on target all he King
[47:37] could see without dreamers even any time
[47:39] I could tell the dream he could tell the
[47:40] interpretation because Talia was a true
[47:42] prophet no King at the King of Kings for
[47:47] the God of heaven had given me a kingdom
[47:49] power strength and glory
[47:51] wheresoever the journal men dwell the
[47:54] beasts of the field the fowls of the
[47:55] heaven had he given into thine hand and
[47:58] had made the ruler of
[48:00] all Dow at this head of gold after thee
[48:04] shall arise another Kingdom inferior to
[48:06] Z another third kingdom of brass which
[48:08] shall be a rule over all the earth a
[48:10] fourth kingdom shall be strong as I am
[48:12] for as much as I am breaking in pieces
[48:14] and subdued all things as iron that
[48:17] breaketh all these shall break in pieces
[48:19] and bruise and whereas thou sawest the
[48:21] feet and tools packed potters clay and
[48:24] pad iron the kingdom shall be divided
[48:26] and there shall be in it the strength of
[48:28] the iron for as much as those swords the
[48:30] iron mixed with miry clay and as the
[48:32] toes of the feet were Pat I am Pat clay
[48:34] social the kingdom shall be partly
[48:36] strong and partly broken and whereas
[48:38] thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay
[48:40] they shall mingle themselves with the
[48:42] seed of men they shall not cleave one to
[48:44] another even as iron is not mixed with
[48:46] clay under the days of these Kings here
[48:49] we go
[48:49] shot the God of heaven set up a kingdom
[48:51] which shall never be destroyed and the
[48:55] Kingdom shall not be left to another
[48:57] people but it shall break in pieces and
[48:59] consume all these kingdoms it shall
[49:01] stand forever for as much as those soils
[49:04] that the stone was cut out of the
[49:05] mountain without hands that had break in
[49:08] pieces the iron the brass the clay the
[49:10] silver the gold the grid God had made
[49:11] know that the King watch shall come to
[49:14] pass thereafter and the dream is sitting
[49:16] and the interpretation sha hallelujah o
[49:23] blessed will supply there the dream is
[49:27] certain and the interpretation sure
[49:33] Daniel is unique in that daniel was
[49:37] seeking the Lord knowing Jama by book
[49:41] says seventy weeks are determined for
[49:42] his people
[49:43] it was 68 years two years remaining so
[49:47] that has got desperate watch this but it
[49:50] is passion to seek the Lord God given a
[49:53] whole unfolding of things right down to
[49:55] the end so daniel is like a Gentile
[49:58] prophet he's not a Gentile but he saw
[50:01] the vision of the times of the Gentiles
[50:05] are you with me
[50:07] now in Romans II let me rather find it
[50:11] if you want you can find it
[50:11] verse 11 and Paul was saying I see then
[50:15] have they stumbled that they should fall
[50:17] talking about Israel Israel we know is
[50:20] the true olive branch we are the one
[50:22] that was grafted in
[50:23] I want you to stick with me now this is
[50:26] not a game this is the real thing now
[50:29] God blinded the Jews that we could get
[50:31] stickin to get the Gentiles an
[50:38] opportunity we were not his people he
[50:41] came unto his own his own received him
[50:44] not
[50:44] and as many as received him to them he
[50:47] gave power to become the sons of God he
[50:50] came to his very own and his own
[50:52] rejected him and upon rejection they
[50:54] turned to the Gentiles
[50:56] knowing that the Gentile have a specific
[50:58] time not even a specific lucky time but
[51:02] a Branham said it has just call it
[51:04] trains of the Gentiles another
[51:06] terminology until the fullness of the
[51:08] Gentiles come in when that time is up
[51:12] it's over
[51:13] I wonder if you understand that so all
[51:17] this Corrigan's
[51:18] and pride a message pride as a God is
[51:21] God and you know he easily loved me so
[51:24] much and what listen be careful that
[51:29] same Savior one day will be your judge
[51:32] God is the word not the imagination of
[51:36] your heart God is the word could
[51:41] somebody say Amen so Paul in Romans he
[51:45] was saying I say he said god forbid but
[51:47] rather through their fall salvation has
[51:50] come under the Gentiles to provoke them
[51:52] to jealousy
[51:53] now if the fall of them be the riches of
[51:55] the world and the dimension of them the
[51:58] riches of the Gentiles how much more
[52:00] their fullness for I speak to you
[52:02] Gentiles inasmuch as I'm an apostle of
[52:05] the Gentiles I magnify my office in
[52:08] Miami means I may provoke to emulation
[52:10] them which are my flesh and might save
[52:13] some of them here we go are you ready
[52:16] this is Romans 11 or we right now in
[52:20] verse 15 if the casting away of them be
[52:25] the reconciling of the world what shall
[52:28] the receiving of them be but life from
[52:30] the dead for if the first-fruit be holy
[52:33] the lump is also holy and if the root be
[52:37] holy saw the branches and if some of the
[52:40] princess has broken off and don't being
[52:43] a wild olive tree were grafted in among
[52:45] them and with them partakers of the root
[52:49] and the factus of the olive tree boast
[52:52] not against the branches but if dog
[52:55] balls don't bear it's not the root but
[52:57] the root the doll will see them the
[53:00] branch of was broken off that I might be
[53:02] grafted in well because of unbelief they
[53:04] were broken off and thou standest by
[53:06] faith be not high-minded but fear for if
[53:10] God spared not the natural branches how
[53:14] here we go take heed lest he also spare
[53:17] not deed behold therefore the goodness
[53:20] and the severity of God on them which
[53:24] fell severity but towards the goodness
[53:27] if thou continuing if thou continue in
[53:35] the goodness behold therefore the
[53:37] goodness and the severity of God and
[53:40] fell severity but to watch the goodness
[53:43] is Dow continue in his goodness
[53:45] otherwise doll also shall be cut off and
[53:49] they also if they are bad not still in
[53:53] unbelief shall be graffed in him for God
[53:56] is able to graft them in again and if
[53:58] doll will cut off of the olive tree
[54:00] which is wild by nature and will grafted
[54:03] contrary to nature into a good olive
[54:05] tree how much more DS will be a natural
[54:09] branches be grafted into their own olive
[54:10] tree I would not brethren here we go
[54:13] that you should be ignorant of this
[54:16] mystery least you should be wise in your
[54:19] own conceits listen to it that blindness
[54:24] in part is happened to Israel until the
[54:27] fullness of the Gentiles come in
[54:31] blindness to Israel until so once the
[54:35] fullness of the Gentiles come in God is
[54:38] ready to go over to Israel no we can
[54:42] understand revelation 7 I saw four
[54:44] angels coming down saying stop the four
[54:46] winds and then I saw another mighty
[54:47] angel having the seat of the Living God
[54:50] oh I still put a mark upon all those and
[54:52] those Jews day 144,000 you could
[54:55] understand right now go to the boat to
[54:56] go back to the Jews he had to wrap up
[54:58] the Gentiles isn't that right the time
[55:01] of the gentle has been in this
[55:02] Pentecostal feast this one feasted
[55:03] recognising the message but Obama says

[57:13] comfort all that mourn but when Jesus
[57:15] was here he left out that part he only
[57:18] stopped right there in the middle of a
[57:19] sentence and said this day the scripture
[57:22] is fulfilled why because the time of the
[57:26] Gentiles will climax this other pact to
[57:29] declare the day of vengeance of our God

[1:32:11] the seven seals calling the 11th hour
[1:32:13] Gentile workers receive the same P and
[1:32:16] Jesus taught it he said there were some
[1:32:17] people went into the harvest they were
[1:32:18] hired when the dead early morning they
[1:32:21] received a penny for the day noontime
[1:32:23] when the works eleventh hour last of the
[1:32:26] day someone come in and receive the same
[1:32:28] kind of pea that they did at the first
[1:32:30] of the day so perfectly how to first our
[1:32:33] messengers with the word with the gospel
[1:32:35] with the truth
[1:32:36] they came in the day of Pentecost and it
[1:32:38] was a dark days I've blocked them all
[1:32:39] then I the middle of the day Luther
[1:32:41] Wesley and them came in then there is to
[1:32:43] be an even time message to receive the
[1:32:45] same thing they did at the beginning the
[1:32:47] even time message is the restore back
[1:32:49] again the same thing same power same P
[1:32:55] it isn't that right no watch no use of
[1:32:58] mine sites and and say this only push on
[1:33:00] the word father of Nations Ibrahim we
[1:33:02] heard you 25 years ago see you have a

[1:33:08] have at this time
[1:33:08] trailer Nations that's the same awkward
[1:33:11] it's called spirit I would criticize
[1:33:12] what did Abraham said
[1:33:14] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:33:17] of unbelief so here you pray for someone
[1:33:19] who didn't get well that doesn't matter
[1:33:21] if I pray for ten thousand tonight and
[1:33:23] ten thousand died in the morning
[1:33:24] tomorrow night and still then on the
[1:33:26] second pray for them I know you hear
[1:33:28] that but do you believe to pray for
[1:33:33] somebody on the dead next day and you
[1:33:36] pray for them to be healed next minute
[1:33:38] they all cool and next day you same
[1:33:40] prefer I think we want to do that are
[1:33:42] some more prayer lines and whatnot

[1:33:59] God's Word
[1:33:59] finally it was fulfilled watch the scuff
[1:34:04] nosov Berenice like that there's not
[1:34:07] even a word but it's a good word - what
[1:34:09] is scuff nosov Berenice being scuffed
[1:34:12] and reproach of barrenness so she had to
[1:34:15] stand the reproach of being banned for
[1:34:16] all those years she was nearly 100 years
[1:34:18] old she was 90 he was like she was 90
[1:34:21] with the Word of God said that she would
[1:34:23] also be a princess a mother of his child
[1:34:25] shell Abraham barren Boonton embodies
[1:34:27] well as dead but yet they never doubted
[1:34:30] that word one bit that the stand for it
[1:34:33] and then God kept his word in that hour

[1:40:02] a husband or wife or your children your
[1:40:04] own heart and God greater than your
[1:40:07] heart that's all there is therefore now
[1:40:15] no condemnation to them who are in
[1:40:23] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:40:26] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[1:40:30] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus as
[1:40:32] freedom from The Lofts
[1:40:34] the flesh cylinder
[1:40:39] so when you have that freedom spirit

[1:41:39] your Messiah noted of one of God
[1:41:41] standing on the edge this is not the
[1:41:45] beginner than the end of the gentle
[1:41:46] dispensation mom say Daniel was one of
[1:41:49] the prophets of carried from Jerusalem
[1:41:50] into Babylon the car narrator Babylon by
[1:41:53] King Nebuchadnezzar he was a young
[1:41:55] fellow when he went down to Babylon not
[1:41:57] many of them were still holding the grin
[1:41:59] old feet I like Daniel because he
[1:42:01] purposed in his heart when he went on to
[1:42:03] Babylon he was going to remain a
[1:42:04] believer he was not going to defile
[1:42:07] himself with the Kings meats now the
[1:42:11] very thing that Daniel was the prophet
[1:42:12] to the Gentiles Daniel saw all the
[1:42:15] Gentile age rise and fall he is called
[1:42:18] the Gentile prophet he wasn't a gentle
[1:42:21] himself but he saw the Gentile
[1:42:23] dispensation from start to finish in the
[1:42:29] head of gold ended up in the feet of
[1:42:30] iron and clay and while he purposed in
[1:42:34] his heart I skip dinner know Jeremiah
[1:42:36] the Prophet watch and he caught in from
[1:42:39] JAMA 25th chapter you'd rather find it
[1:42:41] and Jeremiah speaking therefore does say
[1:42:44] a lot of hosts
[1:42:45] are you with me anybody tired and sleepy
[1:42:49] raise your hands
[1:42:50] but expect many reasons just making
[1:42:53] shorter you know tired and sleepy
[1:42:56] January 25 if you see therefore does say
[1:43:00] the Lord
[1:43:01] I like that when I have prophet stand up
[1:43:03] and sit down say Lord behold this is
[1:43:06] going to his people this not go talking
[1:43:08] to unbelievers and me believers and
[1:43:11] and satellites and whatnot no this is
[1:43:14] God talking to his people behold I will
[1:43:19] send and take all the families of the
[1:43:21] North said the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar
[1:43:22] the king of Babylon my silent you hear
[1:43:28] that so all are you complaining oh god
[1:43:31] it is your refuse to see God you've
[1:43:37] refused to see what God has allowed here

[1:43:55] this land and against inhabitants
[1:43:56] thereof and against all the nations
[1:43:57] wrong about i will utterly destroy them
[1:44:00] but Abraham remember them what gods
[1:44:02] elected he was talking about
[1:44:04] it wasn't individual infidels it was
[1:44:07] church members moreover this is God
[1:44:10] speaking I will take away from them the
[1:44:12] voice of mirth the voice of gladness
[1:44:14] like we have today rock'n'roll the voice
[1:44:17] of the bridegroom the voice of the bride
[1:44:19] the sum of the Millstone the light of
[1:44:21] the candle and this whole land shall be
[1:44:24] desolate hear that prophet cry out the
[1:44:29] whole land shall be desolate I'm not to
[1:44:32] impersonate this great servant of God
[1:44:34] but I prophesied that this whole nation
[1:44:36] shall become desolate God shall punish
[1:44:39] this nation for her sins if God will not
[1:44:43] let Israel his elected Abraham seed who
[1:44:46] he made a covenant and promise with if
[1:44:48] he would not let them get by with
[1:44:49] wrongdoing door they were righteous to
[1:44:52] the core had great churches priests
[1:44:54] rabbis but because of the morals of
[1:44:56] things among them God made them reap
[1:44:58] what this showed so shall we get it 11
[1:45:03] verse Jeremiah speaking the whole land
[1:45:05] shall become desolate and astonishment
[1:45:07] but Obama's interpreting that he says
[1:45:11] that is everybody shall see Danny I they

[1:50:18] Jeremiah wouldn't agree with their
[1:50:20] pharisees sadducees Herodians whatever
[1:50:24] they might be
[1:50:25] he just put the word out and it made
[1:50:27] them all mad at him notice then I took

[1:50:34] the nations drink to it Jeremiah didn't
[1:50:37] stay whom Jeremiah didn't stay in one
[1:50:39] spot he made all the nations drink it
[1:50:43] unto whom the Lord at simply Jeremiah
[1:50:45] took the word of the Lord the wine of
[1:50:48] his word and the wine is the power of
[1:50:50] the word wine has a power
[1:50:52] - intoxication - a power behind it I've
[1:50:55] took the Lord's word I made it and
[1:50:57] manifest the wine the power Lazarus I
[1:50:59] exercised before them go back to the
[1:51:02] lesson that I was reading the same words
[1:51:04] we read this morning now I read the same
[1:51:07] Bible the same punctuation the same
[1:51:09] sentence is the same thing I'm reading

[1:51:18] the babylon and he was an anointed
[1:51:20] prophet and he performed miracles signs
[1:51:21] could interpret unknown tongues
[1:51:22] non-science wonders and yet standing
[1:51:25] alone by himself but Jeremiah wrote
[1:51:28] these words many many years before
[1:51:31] Daniel interpreting the words said wait
[1:51:33] a minute
[1:51:33] we're coming near the end time I've
[1:51:35] already been down here sixty-eight years
[1:51:37] and the and he got it Rocha seventy
[1:51:41] years will be accomplished so Daniel no
[1:51:43] two more years left he say well God if
[1:51:47] there ever was a time we ought to be
[1:51:48] setting ourselves in order to pre it is
[1:51:51] now
[1:51:52] for we as as true servants we see by the
[1:51:55] letters of the Apostles by the warning
[1:51:57] of the Holy Spirit that we in the last
[1:51:59] days the Holy Spirit speaks that in the
[1:52:01] last days men shall be heady highminded
[1:52:03] lovers of pleasures more than God
[1:52:06] trucebreakers false accusers incontinent
[1:52:09] despisers of those that are good I
[1:52:11] understand by letter I understand that
[1:52:15] it comes coffers in the last days
[1:52:16] I understand there'll be nation against
[1:52:18] nation and last is I understand that men
[1:52:21] have to be feeling for fear there with
[1:52:22] perplexity of time distress among the
[1:52:25] nation I understand woman but Bob there
[1:52:27] here in the last days I understand they
[1:52:29] wear short clothes walk with higher
[1:52:30] shoes tinkling us they go in the last
[1:52:32] days I understand more basalo in the
[1:52:34] last days I understand preachers will be
[1:52:36] false shepherds in the last days that
[1:52:40] will compromise and will not feed the
[1:52:44] people the word but will go off the
[1:52:46] creed and things instead I understand
[1:52:48] there'd be a voice in the last days
[1:52:50] crying out in the wilderness the people
[1:52:52] that come back to the original message
[1:52:53] back to the things of God I understand
[1:52:56] my book that those things will take
[1:52:58] place I understand last days there come

[2:12:43] the standard until the end time the end
[2:12:46] time
[2:12:46] what is the end time the end of the 70th
[2:12:49] week when Christ the Prince the
[2:12:52] Antichrist will be revealed now the
[2:12:54] endtime message I reveal it
[2:12:56] the last church age glory there you are
[2:12:58] oh my 6 metres think of it the mystery
[2:13:01] things that the church will pass their
[2:13:03] eyes see it's nonsense the mystery of
[2:13:05] who Jesus Christ was not a third person
[2:13:08] not as a calm person not a third person
[2:13:10] but the person of God all these other
[2:13:12] mysteries of God will be revealed there
[2:13:14] we go because it's wrote in this book
[2:13:16] this one I get to you and
[2:13:19] to be revealed to the endtime generation
[2:13:21] because there's a power and vision
[2:13:25] behind it
[2:13:26] our Word of God that's been revealed to
[2:13:32] get the church in order for the rapture
[2:13:35] and going home the purpose of had been
[2:13:39] revealed is to what get the church in
[2:13:43] order for the rapture or praise the name
[2:13:46] of the Lord
[2:13:47] now the Gentiles was not lotted any
[2:13:51] sitting tank just the time of the
[2:13:54] Gentiles we find out Jesus didn't let
[2:13:57] them attain an equal descriptive reread
[2:14:00] Luke 21:24 they shall shut down the
[2:14:02] walls of Jerusalem until the time of the
[2:14:05] Gentiles watch be fulfilled then there's
[2:14:10] a lot of time but nobody knows what it
[2:14:13] will be
[2:14:13] it's a mystery so what we preach in this
[2:14:17] morning is a mystery I'll just read it
[2:14:23] to you it's no longer a mystery of this
[2:14:25] residue what apparitions more as a
[2:14:27] mystery
[2:14:27] anytime that Gentiles a mystery so the
[2:14:29] title is a mystery insufficient in the
[2:14:31] mystery there's a lot of time nobody
[2:14:36] knows what it will be is a mystery see
[2:14:38] the Gentile time the Jews we cannot tell
[2:14:41] time I wonder church well it's back
[2:14:43] sooner whatever it is remember in this
[2:14:45] great time of persecution there will be
[2:14:47] millions of millions of Gentiles that
[2:14:50] will die the rejected bride the remnant
[2:14:55] of the woman seed the sleepin virgin do
[2:14:59] you understand that those who missed the
[2:15:01] rapture will be killed most of them the
[2:15:06] piper quality remnant of the woman's
[2:15:08] seed for around some millions will not
[2:15:11] die all right
[2:15:13] she goes right on it is just clear
[2:15:16] he said if you haven't got the holy
[2:15:18] spirit you better get it us because you
[2:15:19] can we had the endtime Oh bless I've
[2:15:23] been in the land

[2:15:53] about a ministry shape down where they
[2:15:55] have the Ministry of Christ among them
[2:15:57] this is what we're looking for what they
[2:15:59] got what they got what that means when
[2:16:02] the Ministry of Jesus recommends what
[2:16:03] does that mean they have got knitting in
[2:16:05] condition what's next the rejected stone
[2:16:08] to the pyramid cut out of mountain

[2:16:32] here by a vicar son of God he is the
[2:16:34] Holy Spirit the camp of the pyramid will
[2:16:38] be Christ's coming
[2:16:38] do you see it no Daniel said he was a
[2:16:41] Gentile age until the stone come out of
[2:16:44] the mountains with all their cut of
[2:16:45] hands without hands
[2:16:48] they had never put the capstone of he
[2:16:50] tinysine what Daniel saw and the
[2:16:53] capstone so what Daniel saw ties him
[2:16:56] with us and what we expected and what we
[2:16:59] are looking for isn't none right
[2:17:01] no what and God's hand that cut the
[2:17:04] stone you see it what did it do hit the
[2:17:07] image schmuck in his feet broken in
[2:17:09] pieces grown little power what happened
[2:17:11] that time the coming of the stone up
[2:17:14] when the church and the glory caused it
[2:17:16] ended the Gentile
[2:17:19] dispensation God ended it up the coming
[2:17:23] of that stone so the common of the
[2:17:25] capstone dynamics and the time of the
[2:17:32] Gentiles
[2:17:33] ends the common
[2:17:35] of the Gentile dispensation isn't that
[2:17:37] right day is unlikely bring this Christ
[2:17:39] is that stone he wasn't born of a man he
[2:17:42] wasn't born of God he is coming for
[2:17:45] church that's been reborn again by the
[2:17:46] Spirit of God cause the strength of the
[2:17:49] headstone runs all through the church
[2:17:51] like a magnet I remember being in the
[2:17:53] middle they were shipping out all kind
[2:17:55] of things I'm scrap laying on the strip
[2:17:57] and a big stone come by and pick it up
[2:17:58] that big magnet stone pick up all of it
[2:18:01] because it was magnetized to it we have
[2:18:03] got to be magnetized to the headstone
[2:18:05] the headstone is the Holy Ghost Christ
[2:18:08] and every one of us that's got the
[2:18:10] magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that
[2:18:12] stole here we go strikes the image the
[2:18:14] children flee to it so they got to come
[2:18:17] a power back into the church or glory to
[2:18:19] God he says the power come it would
[2:18:21] leave me the prayer it will be the grace
[2:18:23] of God you understand Israel had nothing
[2:18:26] to do with them seventy years God judge
[2:18:28] them and say for 70 years Babylon will
[2:18:31] hold you and after that you're getting
[2:18:33] out so after 70 years course I was just
[2:18:36] the king of Babylon you understand when
[2:18:40] God said I will restore it I have none
[2:18:42] with you I will restore to you whether
[2:18:47] you like it you don't like it where
[2:18:49] you'll feel or at all feel it he said I
[2:18:51] am going to do it or get the Lord are
[2:18:54] shouting
[2:18:56] how many understand that you are going
[2:18:58] to be delivered every name on the port
[2:19:04] [Applause]
[2:19:08] Michael just turn up and deliver every
[2:19:11] name that not just choose Michaels
[2:19:13] Christ every name has to be delivered

[2:19:20] mighty angel came with the book the book
[2:19:23] was open my man Oh hallelujah
[2:19:34] Oh glory to God so everything must fall
[2:19:37] into their hands the Gentile churches
[2:19:39] loud is the age if the Jews and in
[2:19:41] homeland

[2:19:54] together we have a ministry that patents
[2:19:57] the ministry of Jesus Christ to catch
[2:19:59] the storm when it comes so the stone
[2:20:01] can't come if there's not many to catch
[2:20:03] it so the ministry of christ is to catch
