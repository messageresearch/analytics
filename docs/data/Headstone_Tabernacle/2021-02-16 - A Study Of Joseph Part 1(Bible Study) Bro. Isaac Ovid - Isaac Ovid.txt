is what we fight for it is what we contend for lord is what we are striving for it is lord what gives us insight into how to live how to act how to lord to navigate lord the mountains and the valleys and the situations law that lord we may find ourselves in the situations that lord we may not understand lord and to even give us further clarity on the things that we believe we do understand so heavenly father lord for this body of believers this lord portion of the bride of jesus christ lord as we lord have faithfully gathered lord in this way lord to lord focus on this thing lord as as it has unfolded through this time of the changing of what's happening in this world lord this new normal as it were lord that the the pandemic lord which is lord not just a biological pandemic but it's a lord it's a it's a spiritual pandemic it is lord an economic pandemic it is a it is an ecclesiastical pandemic law there's so much that is changing and taking place and unfolding before our very eyes lord we lord cherish the opportunity to take comfort in your word we lord relish the opportunity to guide lord to be able to step above the carnal things to be able to step higher lower than the situations that could so easily be set us so easily weigh us down and there are so many other things that we might have considered to do tonight or there are so many other obligations that the course of life may be man from us but we are responding to the call lord despite our feelings despite our varied commitments despite the various challenges that we have encountered and we will continue to encounter we come to the spiritual gas station tonight we come to lord the petrol station on the oil station for the lord where we could lord add lord nutrients spiritual nutrients to keep running to keep living so help us tonight as we approach your word lord may you bless every brother every sister lord every father every mother every young person every child lord everyone that is here tonight lord may something be said lord i would minister to someone in a special way lord take me out of the way and speak lip to ear to your children lord you have found a way lord to preserve your thoughts and your thinking lord both your way of thinking and the things that you thought about lord you have found a way to capture that lord through the written word and we thank you lord for sending lord the stars lord throughout each age lord and to us specifically that seventh star lord to bring clarity to tie the loose ends as it were lord to give us the reveal word that we could look at the written word through the eyes of the revealed word so lord may you speak to us tonight if there's anyone lord who is depressed or feeling down or feeling frustrated or dealing with some situation that they feel it's too much to obey or too much to handle lord may you speak to them lord through your word today and they could see lord themselves in your word and they can see lord that there's nothing by chance there is no accident and lord only when we can look back we could see how it all has been making sense all along and there's no lord nothing that is an accident with you so we commit tonight into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen so uh it's certainly a great privilege uh to be here tonight one more time and um i was having a bit of a challenge earlier to connect so bear with me tonight um if the connection made me deposit we are trusting god uh that he has a plan for us tonight and um i'll be trying to keep on top of of of if if it goes down someone will let me know but certainly by the grace of god we are here tonight and we thank god for his love for his mercy um are you thankful tonight for god preserving you for keeping you you know to hole in your hands you know when when you need strength he is our comfort he's our refuge and um i am always encouraged by that story of the footprints on the signs of time you know when you know the story goes that at one point he looks back and see but but how is it that when in my deepest toughest moments you know you know he's only one set of footprints one thing was going good it seemed like it was two set of footprints but in rough moments it was just one set of footprints you know is it that i was left alone and and and the story unfolded that he said that said that's when i was carrying you you know when you couldn't carry yourself you know is when i was carrying you you know and and that is i think the testimony for all of us and that we share that he's the one that carries us he's the one that keeps us you know so uh he is keeping us in the in the palm of his hands and he is watching how everything unfolds and we we continue to trust him in every way that that we can so by the grace of god tonight we want to go into the word tonight and um uh by the grace of god i want to actually go to the old testament uh tonight i know we have been in revelation for some time but um i also have to respond to the call and i felt led for some time that i wanted to kind of touch on this and um i'll see how far i can get into this tonight but i believe that it is something to encourage us and something that we all sought to know and understand um it is a it is a study that i believe all of us would would have encountered in some way some form but by the grace of god we want to kind of put pull some elements out of it tonight um it is quite a large study uh so i know that it will it will not be able to be completed in in one session so we will see how far we can get and maybe you know i could i could kind of you know try to cover as much of it as possible tonight so tonight i want to go to the book of genesis and you know it's appropriate because we for this year thus far we have been in the book of revelation and we know that uh you know brother ranum taught us that if it's two books that the devil doesn't like it is genesis and revelation um so we want to be in in genesis uh tonight and uh we want to be looking at the study of we are actually going to have a study tonight on the study of joseph uh tonight uh are you hearing me am i am i coming through you're fine you're fine so we want to be in genesis we're going to sat in genesis 37 tonight um and it is really something else because joseph as we know uh is that is a type of christ hated without a cause and there are so many parallels and we understand you know when we look at the patriarchs you know abraham isaac jacob joseph abraham feet isaac love jacob grace joseph perfection we see all this through the word and we understand these things but as i would have said you know last year sometimes we we look at at these stories and we pull out some pieces and we never really slow down to process it you know so i want to kind of slow down the car and kind of take it you know step by step as a real foundation because we have to understand these these foundational teachings you know so we're gonna start from genesis 37 who's one to get right into it tonight uh genesis 37 and verse one and we we know jacob we would have done a teaching on jacob last year uh you know jacob have to wrestle with the angel and and we can't go into all of that tonight and maybe by the grace of god we could speak on that some of the time but we're starting here now with jacob genesis 37 and verse one and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father which would have been isaac was a stranger in the land of canaan these are the generations of jacob verse 2 joseph being 17 years old a teenager 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren uh in the amplified it would it would make it clear that it would have been dan naphtali god and asha uh and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpha his father's wives and joseph brought unto his father the evil report in other words at age 17 joseph was coming home to daddy and telling daddy hear what dan naftali gar and asha doing and brought back a bad report uh to their father about you know their behaviors their actions their activities and so forth you know so you know joseph as you look through scripture was a was a unique unique unique son a a a unique example and and verse 3 goes on now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and uh we would have touched on this in many ways before and going into verse four i kind of want to speak through some of these to kind of get to some deeper context and was found when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him in the amplified it says his brothers saw that their father loved joseph more than all of his brothers so they hated him and could not find it within themselves to speak to him on friendly tombs i want to pause there just a little bit to take note of the fact that jacob's love for joseph was jacob's love for joseph joseph could not turn up or turn down that love in that sense so the feelings that his brothers had towards him was really a misplaced one because if it was that jacob's love was due to joseph if the brothers had issue the issue should have been with jacob and not joseph because joseph was not the one who was activating that love so i just want to kind of begin to pull some pieces here together so so if if jacob loved joseph why have x with joseph why not vex with jacob so these brothers couldn't as we said in the amber fight couldn't find it within themselves to even speak to him on friendly tombs so already we see a situation where the brothers were beginning to look at joseph a certain way so all of this bear in mind many times we talk about joseph being the dreamer and all these things and when they saw the dream it had an infection we'll get to that but we're seeing that there are two things that are already taking place that already sort of changed the lens or the glasses of the brothers to joseph they already felt a certain kind of way because joseph was you want to go back to the father maybe none of the other brothers were doing anything about what was ever taking place but joseph was the one to go back to the father and say listen my brother is doing things they should not be doing so already they had a certain feeling towards joseph going back to tell jacob what is happening and then they are witnesses of this love that jacob has for joseph and that already has them feeling a certain way towards joseph you know and let's go now to verse five and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him yet the more so hated him yet the more shows that that and and would type this as his spiritual side now so the what the dream actually represented was an increased level of hate hated him anymore so in other words the heat was already there and the spiritual side of joseph was only amplified when he had the dreams i want to make the point that it wasn't a dream that brought the heat it wasn't even the spiritual aspect of his life that brought the heat all that the spiritual gene the expression of the spiritual gene in him only in only increased the level of hate so so i hope you're catching this tonight a bit so so the hate that was placed on joseph especially the part and i wanted to kind of sit in this part where jacob's love for joseph caused hate jacob had nothing to do rather had nothing to do with that he couldn't do anything about it because the love was coming external to him it was his father's love for him that was causing hate an external situation so i want us to look at it and i always say in the word we have to see it how it impacts us what god takes us through and i have to realize like i heard somebody say we sing this song i love him because he first loved me and and i heard somebody saying it's really difficult for us to really love god in in in in the sense of when you compare god's love for us it's really no comparison our love for him it's a really deep thought because for god already love us for him to know all about us for him to know our beginning our mistakes our ups and downs and still love us it is not something that we in in this way could really be truly honest we can't really have an understanding of it because when situations happen to us or with people who we interact with we feel a certain kind of way about things but that's not how god operates so you can't blame joseph for the way his father felt about him and nobody could blame you for how god feels about you nobody convex with god for how god feels about you and if anybody vex with you because your father love you a certain kind of way it really is not your problem or my problem all right so we're building now so verse five and jacob dreamed the dream and he told it to his brethren and he hated him even more and he said unto them here i pray you this dream which i have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obesions to my sheath in other words bow down give respect to my sheath and his brethren said to him shall thou indeed reign over us or shall thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet no more for his dreams and for his words so again we see in verse 5 that he dreamed a dream and they hated him yet the more and by verse 8 they hated him yet the more for his dreams and now they're adding to his words so if hate had a volume and if you could ever find in scripture where hate is being amplified it is in this scripture here in genesis 37. all right now bear in mind he's not being malicious he is not intensely trying to hurt anybody he didn't ask for the dream he didn't say lord tell me my future he said i dream a dream he excited to express the dream there's nothing here to clear up if he even had a full understanding of what he dreamed meant but clearly people could begin to try to put the pieces together about it and here it is he is being hated as we know without a cause because he didn't do what he did all right first nine and he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said behold i have dreamed the dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obesions to me and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him now i want us to take this in context as well joseph is young he is 17 years old and there's something to be said about a 17 year old who is being exposed to certain things you know we look at jesus and the bible said that jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered in the details of all of the suffering but it was a process that was shaping molding jesus into the character that god wanted to use him for so we see joseph at 17 may not have fully understood the impact of his testimony on those around him so he is excited he is joyous that he is seeing something that nobody else may have experienced and he told it to his father until his bridging and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to dee to the earth verse 11 changes now verse 11 doesn't speak about hate it's sweet snow from here to envy so it is a it's an amplification taking place and you realize that at times when people hate you the hatred is because they really want what you have they hate you for having what they want to have so this hatred was now turning into something even deeper and his brethren envied him the bible says and his father observed the saying so observe the saying here in verse 11 meant his father was wondering about their beating so the brothers getting envious but jacob in his mind he said what is mean boy what is mean boy so i'm laying a foundation we're trying to go somewhere and his father observation and his brethren went to feed their father's flock in shechem and israel said to joseph do not die bridge and feel the shashim come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i so joseph presented himself clearly it was a case that jacob used to keep joseph close by and you know under his watch and he wasn't really going out there with the flock and that kind of stuff and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it'd be well with ibrahim it kind of sounds like david story to it go and see everything well with your brothers and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the veil of hebron and he came to sheshem and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and a man asked him saying what seekers though and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray where they feed their flock so joseph they are looking he's trying to find his brothers he he is he's not he's obviously not an expert at the terrain he's lost you see is out of his element i want to paint a picture here of the evolution of this character named joseph he's out there he's wandering and you feel he is lost he said tell me i prayed yes i look if you're looking for my brothers and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him so what was once joseph go on and tell daddy about me you know joseph galcott of many colors none of we ever get that quote joseph had a dream i like that boy joseph joseph have our next dream but i hate joseph as he was getting dreams and and he feel you better than us joseph have a next dream even if i don't know wondering what's going on and hate building now to envy how is it he can dream and again dream to the point that joseph now approaching you and you say you know what let us kill him and that's a that's a really interesting journey to see human behavior and this is not cousin this is not friend this is not neighbor this is not this is brother we're talking about albeit half brothers these are people who grew up in the roof grew up in the same environment so they conspired against him to slay him and they said to one another behold this dreamer commit come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will see some evil beast had devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams so see how they connected his dying to the dreams now joseph didn't give himself the dream they were perplexed and bothered by the fact that joseph was dreaming of being in power and that they had to subject themselves to his authority and his power so they told themselves if we kill joseph his dream will also die i want us to catch that if joseph dies his dreams will also die with him and they themselves connected it so they say let us kill him and we shall see what will become of his dreams and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him in other words ruined in here i air like joseph as much as well yeah but let us not kill him and ruben 17m shed no blood but cast him into this spit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might get rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again so roman starting to get cold feet reuben's saying let's put him in this put him in this ditch and ruben telling himself when they threw him here when nobody watching i will take jose back out and carry him back to daddy because i really don't want any part to this so i'm building to something i know a lot of us may know this and some of us may not have spent time reading it in this way and it came to pass now joseph is all is happening where joseph walking innocently i can imagine joseph 17 years old he is whistling he is naive to help his brothers feel about him i want us to process this for a minute because if you ascertain a threat you accidentally people don't like your head you would want even more among them i am sure that they are people that you don't like to go around because you don't feel comfortable with them you know they're not for you you know they don't have your back you know they're not interested in your well-being you know they're not supportive of your dreams you know that if you are successful they will have a problem with it but joseph is still young he is still learning he is still growing he is still coming to a deeper understanding of how things work so he is innocently walking towards his brothers believing that his brothers are totally receptive to him and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stripped joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it next verse now this is where it gets somewhat troubling and they sat down to eat bread so imagine you throw your brother in a pit and you so don't have a sense of feeling for his welfare that that you could throw a mini pit and you can sit down and say well you're only ready to eat so they comfortable now and it shows really the condition of their heart and how they allowed this brother young brother joseph to have such an effect on their lives so they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and bomb and mu going to carry it down to egypt now i want us to take note of this here verse 26 and judah said unto his brethren what prophet is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come and let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content so the idea of joseph going to egypt came from judah and as you learn scripture and you read scripture and you process certain things i would have preached it before god operates on different levels so he is seeing a bigger picture and here it is you have judah you have reuben who's saying i want to sneak him out and carry him back and you have judah who is saying you know what lord don't let us leave you with the pit let us sell him down to egypt this is the same judah who years to come would have quality the line of judah for which will be the lion of the tribe of judah david will come from him even jesus will come from him and when you look at how this unfolds in genesis you have to see how god is also dealing not just with joseph here but also dealing with judah all right and and we'll see how god does it right so judah idea is to send him to egypt ruben doesn't know this is taking place because ruben gone around to meditate whatever ruben went to do so come let us what prophet is it this is verse 25 26 if we slay our brother and conceal his blood verse 27 come and let us sell him to the ishmaelites which is like their cousins and left not our hand be upon him for he's our brother and our flesh and his brother were content and they passed by media knight mutual men and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the israelites with 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt 17 years old he ain't nobody raised any flock he doesn't know anything about much because he's young in his family his older brothers used to take care of things and joseph at age 17 finds himself a slave in egypt and ruben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes he tore his clothes and he returned onto his president said the child is not and i where shall i go in other words i don't know what to do i don't know where i can go and they took joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in blood and they sent the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said this we have found know now whether it be your son's quote or no so them fellas actually bring the quota jacob and say listen jacob i don't know if you recognize this you know we find this quote you tell us is this the one you give to this or not their comments say we found joseph quote to them they say we found a coat with blood you tell us if this is the one that you're made for joseph and the bible said he knew it and said it is my son's quote an evil beast had devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him and the media the media knights an officer of pharaoh and captain of the god so this is actually captain of the royal god so potiphar is a powerful man in egypt so this is genesis we just read from genesis 37 and for students of scripture i know my internet given a little problem as you let me know so we just read genesis 37 and for students of script 38 but genesis 38 has no mention of joseph and if you go to genesis 39 it picks up joseph and 39 40 41 going on continues joseph and we have this call it pattern interruption in scripture of genesis 38 and theologians always perplexed with how come we have the story of joseph starts in 37 and then 38 is all about judah and then 39 picks up joseph again so if you will recall when i would have preached on the generation of jesus christ out of matthew you will see that the first woman mentioned out of the book of matthew was tamara who was judah's daughter-in-law so in genesis 38 we have judah this is a period of time between joseph he'll get in egypt and picking up the story of what's happening with joseph in egypt and it unfolds the story of judah right there in the middle there and it is really a contrast i'm not going to go into it fully now but it's a contrast of the life of judah and the life of joseph here it is you have a case where judah is almost deceived as it were into having a relation with his daughter-in-law he has called it sexual indiscretion in genesis 38. it is a absolute contrast to the failure slash evolution of judah because it was judah who was sending joseph down to egypt but the judah who sent joseph to egypt and the judah that unfolds here in genesis 38 it is as if god is saying for the line of judah to carry the royal seed judah has to go through a transformation so when you look at genesis 37 38 39 and going on it is really a series of changes that are taking place changes in the life of joseph changes in life of jacob even a radical change in the life of judah which will unfold later on in the story of joseph because for judah deeper to send his brother into slavery it takes a certain kind of heart to send anybody in in the slavery and when you read it later in the story of joseph if we get to that point tonight you will see the brothers talking about the anguish so joseph didn't walk to the media knights and the ishmaelites the bible said there was anguish in his soul so he wasn't crying he was begging them don't send me i wanted to catch this he was begging them don't send me and the the chief among the brothers who were saying send joseph to egypt was actually judah so genesis 38 we'd have time to go into it in detail now sees this judah who is chief to send joseph now we understand on different levels how god is working and it's his plan of redemption that he's working out but it is as if while god is dealing with joseph and doing what he has to do for joseph because joseph was not going to be the line that would bring christ however if joseph was not in egypt the line that would bring christ would be dead when you unfold the story of joseph if those children of jacob didn't find food they would have died because the famine was killing people without food so god has the wonderful ability to work on multiple people at the same time only god could operate this way so simultaneously he's dealing with a young joseph who has to come into maturity come on now he is dealing with putting things in place to preserve his bloodline if i could say that in other words this whole plan that's unfolding with joseph and egypt and children of israel is to preserve the genes that have to be called the lion of the tribe of judah but judah also has to go through his own transformation to be worthy to be called that line of the tribe of judah if judah didn't go to his transformation then this this judah would have had a testimony of the one who who didn't care about his brother enough to send him to egypt i want us to see how it all starts to come connect together so god in genesis 38 is dealing with judah and we preach about this how judah had sons and his son he says he says his son got married to a young girl and he was so wicked that god killed him and as was the custom when you're a widow and you have no descendants no cages descendants catch this you have to marry again so this daughter in law of judah has to marry the nexon he was so horrible god have to kill him too now bear in mind dealing with the line of judah i hope i hope you're following me here because jesus is the lion or the tribe of judah so judah's seed is important to god anybody with me i want to connect this here so the preservation of judah's seed is important to god and this is why it has a drop in here right before joseph unfolds because if judah's seed doesn't come forth then there is no tribe of judah and the royal line of judah and the lion of the tribe of judah so judah's son would have been the continuation of his seed anybody with me but tima had no son from the first son of judah god killed him the second son god killed him when it was time for the third son judah say when he grow up i will send him for you the bible say that boy grew up went to university went to college become a shopping man and and when it was time to inform tiamat that he is ready for marriage julia sent a text message yes now what's up here i sent a letter he telling yourself i don't lost two boys by this girl i'm not losing my last boy you remember the story we we preach on this and his story unfolds that judah is going to check a friend and different thinker thing and and he meets this woman who heard judah was coming and he didn't know it was and then she was this just as a prostitute and and and and judah had no money with him so he gives certain elements of his as a don payment and and the story unfolds and it's almost like is this even in the bible and we preach that it was in this situation god is unfolding something and when word comes back to judah that tema is pregnant he's like let us go and burn her because once and for all he can put an end to this girl who killed his two sons and when he gets down there to pass judgment on her she said is it okay if i show the the stuff that belonged to the man who was responsible for my child or children because and when she brought it out in wreck he recognized julia kennedy's own stuff and judah made a statement she is more righteous than i in her action in her activity in her humiliating judah she inadvertently i wanted to catch this without even understanding what was going on was actually preserving the line of judah and in so doing also brought humility to judah it forever changed judah so genesis 38 is a change taking place in judah's life that will also unfold later on in genesis that was a part of this so so in other words the judah that was quick to say send joseph to egypt was not the same judah at the end of genesis 38. that's the point i want to make that during genesis 38 the character named judah who would have sent joseph to egypt this was a different man he had lost two sons he almost lost his food he was publicly embarrassed he got caught in public because here he is as a judge to pass judgment on a woman who was his daughter-in-law and then it is a public exposure that he actually impregnated his daughter-in-law what a thing to be made known to the public so the judah is a judah there's a transformation in there anybody with me so it is an interruption or a pattern interruption in the unfolding of the story but it runs in parallel anybody with me so now we can go to 39. and it picks up 39 as if 38 was just it's almost like god in unfolding this whole story is like a scene shift the last scene is joseph being carried to egypt then it switches scenes to judah's in discussion his story and and how a man who was in a position of strength is broken and then we are back to joseph now in egypt and joseph was brought down to egypt now when you read the torah the jews the jewish reading of this would this brought down that we would say down in in english down is not just down as in we go in downtown it was call it a lowering of station so the jews would say it is it is it is it is a falling station so so joseph is being brought down not just physically down but down to egypt down to it it's almost like he's going down with our problem then right so joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the god an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down further and i love this because this is joseph is in egypt he don't only language he don't know the customs he don't know the traditions so when people say well i don't know adobe experience i never do it before and all i say here is joseph he is a young man barely an adult in our terms and he's brought down and it had to be something about him that caught the eye of potiphar because in those days the slaves would be presented and brought and you would select and pick and something about him caught the eye of the captain of the royal guard now at this time egypt is the most powerful civilization on the youth the captain of the royal god will be a discerning man who is looking for quality he is looking for potential and he spies out joseph and verse two and the lord was with joseph and listen to this he was a prosperous man now in the amplified the appleby said the lord was with joseph and he even though a slave became a successful and prosperous man talk about changing the narrative of your story talk about the odds being against you and you finding a way to press through the situation there's nothing about joseph that speaks to accepting the situation as it is and because my brothers do it yeah people who live in that self-pity and pity party i don't know why i do i know i didn't do nothing and look where i am now and i go just along here and then that was not joseph the bible is saying here any amplified even though a slave a slave don't normally have wealth a slave is not typically enterprising a slave by definition is forced to work it is against your will but joseph in a situation of being forced to work and not having certain rights and not having certain privileges because as a slave you are denied rights as a slave you are denied privileges the bible is saying that the lord is with joseph and he even though a slave and i want that even though a slave to mean even though there's a limitation even though there's an obstacle even though there's something hindering you whatever it might be this even though a slave is in scripture to identify that the odds against you in some way there was a way and the scripture places the context of what it was the key to that was the lord was with joseph and i love to personalize this we have to know that the lord is with us it must be important to us that the lord is with us it must be our testimony that the lord is with us and i want us to highlight this as well because this is joseph is spiritual and natural so it is in his situation he is because the lord is with him everything around him is getting the benefits of it and we'll see it in a bit so verse 2 and the lord is with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian and his master verse 3 saw that the lord was with him and the lord made all if you were underlining i want to underline it would all the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand that is a prophet there's someone you know it means everything joseph touch was blessed give me that kind of blessing that is not something so that's all that he did to prosper in his hand verse 4 and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him which is whatever made him oversee over his house and all that he had he put into his hand you see trust you see you see trust can you be trusted like this because what is promised to us in the spiritual realm with your sign he check your chest as good as the father and these kind of things that's a lot of trust in them in the amplified that verse 4 says so joseph pleased potiphar and found favor in his sight and he served him as his personal servant he made joseph oversee over his house and put all listen to this all that he owned in joseph's church so potiphar was so comfortable so confident in joseph's ability he had such complete trust in joseph that he could put all that he had into joseph hands it's not a wonderful thing verse 5 and it came to pass from the time that he had made him oversee in his house and over all that he had that the lord listen to this bless the egyptians house for joseph's sake wow so whatever captain of the royal guard in a hidden country serving a hidden king with all the idols and everything he in suddenly in a blessed house suddenly his house just blessed because of and and listen and it came to pass the blessing had a starting point you know the blessing wasn't when he brought joseph into the house the bible says and it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house the moment he put joseph in charge the blessing flow somebody's in charge so so i want us to understand that god you know what they say but i say promotion is not from the eastern university boom post movies are coming lord there are some deep teachings in here that if you spend time slower than i am doing it and sit down and say wait a minute joseph have put himself there joseph didn't ask to be in egypt joseph is is there against his choice against his will but no matter what life deal him he has taken a certain approach to it unto the lord and he can't take credit for it because we read that in verse 3 his master saw that the lord was with him so joseph is not taking credit for anything i want us to appreciate that point so verse five when it came to pass from the time that he had made him oversee in his house and over all that he had the lord bless the egyptian house for joseph's sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field so because of joseph's presence everything potiphar had in the house and in the field was blessed that is that is real christianity you know why you're not a blessing just for yourself but but who you're coming to contact with your blessing you get a job and suddenly the business this is what i'm saying we we we are recession proof you know no i don't i i don't know i was a i cut it from my different clothes the god i serve listen people talk about the plan they're making reception we are recession proof you have to see that if you have a job now that the business that will hire you you will be the difference in that business because the lord is with you suddenly the business have the ability to provide for you and the business will get blessed because of you because the more blessed the business is is to bless you was being blessed and his boss was being blessed and the house was being blessed all because of the lord being with joseph anybody with me verse six as if god wants to make it crystal clear the extent he said and he left all that he had in joseph hand and he knew not what he had you know what that means potiphar so trusted joseph he wasn't checking the bank account he wasn't checking the the the goal account he wasn't checking nothing he knew not what he had he stopped checking what did i catch this he had such confidence and the blessing was so much he stopped checking what he have listen save the bread which he didn't eat in other words the only thing he had to check is the food meaning this is what i have to eat without all i need to know what is it that food on the table he does checking what he put on your plate he had to worry about nothing else talk about management so we see in here now that joseph was a manager so if i bring it to the business context and you want to be a ceo or you want to be a manager then joseph is one of the first examples in genesis of management in action because he was able to come at a very young age and take over the administration of the house of the fields of the servants of the bank account of the accounting of the records of the decision making in so much and the only decision potiphar has to make is what are eating today boy egg or cheese or peanut butter or jam the only decision i have to make because joseph running the house is what i eat today that's what the bible saying the hardest decision potiphar had to make is what to put in his bread which type of bread take it read the scripture that what the bible saying here he left all that let me find in the amplified so potiphar left all that he owned and joseph charged and with joseph there he did not need to pay attention to anything except the food he ate what a life think about it so we have all these concepts of joseph and this is why i want to challenge our understanding of scripture and what god expects from us because god expects us to be able to give an account he expects us to have some level of management he expects us to be able to communicate he expects us to be able to articulate he expects us to have trust in him he expects us to acknowledge him in all our ways he expects us to survive under pressure he expects us to throw back our shoulders against all odds he expects us to figure things out this is not a 40 year old man we're dealing with here this is a 60 year old man we're dealing with here this is a teenager we're dealing with here he didn't have 10 years work experience somebody preached to me he didn't have 20 years management experience and an mba from harvard but the lord was with him get me some managers that he lord with them and see what real management looks like because god is the best manager that there ever is ever had ever will be and if the lord is with you you don't need to have a degree anybody with me he is able to guide your part anybody with me tonight so again we find now we're going into verse seven where the pressure starts and the the test start and the temptation start and if we had time to compare this deeper with with genesis 38 we will see the difference between judah and joseph because when the temptation came to judah he couldn't deal with the temptation that is what broke judah it is what unfolded what was in judah although god allowed it to unfold it shows the difference in character in judah to joseph joseph let's go to let's finish with six and he left all that he had in joseph hand and he knew not what he had saved the bread which he did peter love that i love that and joseph was a goodly person and well favored so i want to catch that last line there in in in the amplified so in the i said now joseph was handsome and attractive in form and appearance this brother jordan was blessed to know your manager your survivor your overcomer and you're handsome in the amplified they say attractive informant appearance so joseph is one name when you walk in the room you turn heads you're in charge you have a personality you ding ding ding charismatic this is joseph without the cause kind of person that you either love to love you love to hate verse seven and it came to pass after these things after he has proven himself as a manager after the blessing of the lord upon party for after everybody know that joseph whatever he touches bless that his master's wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me but he refused that wasn't judah's position judah buckled under pressure verse 8 but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master wanted not what is with me in the house so to not get you confused with the english but he refused and said to his master's wife look with me in the house my master does not concern himself with anything he has put everything that he owns in my charge all right first nine there is none greater in this house than i in other words joseph is saying i have the highest rank in this house neither has he kept back anything from me but v in other words he is not greater than in this other than i am nor has he kept anything from me except you because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god in the amplified it says against god and your husband verse 10 and brother anthony had preached on this and it came to pass as she spoke to joseph day by day no no you see this testimony right here this is powerful the ambivalent said and so it was that she spoke to joseph persistently day after day we need some stronger christians with him yeah here we need some stronger christians i wish all the cameras were zoned i wish i could see everybody face because joseph by anointing but beyond anointing and beyond favor this is a decision that he made it is not one time it's not two times it is not cheating time every day she coming at him and he's saying no no no no no no and it keeps the possible this time and it came to pass bliss then as she speak to joseph david that he could not enter her he didn't give him to lie by her or to be with her scripture is really clear so so beside her so showing no kind of contact here sleep with her here lie down next to her yesterday cuddling there was no suspicion nothing could be attributed to him his he had a clean record to this point in time clean record nothing against joseph verse 11 and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out so it's two things he left the garment and two things he fled and got him out so when i read something like that i wasn't when he said because fled to me should be good enough like you fled but it says and got him out so i want to go and read in the amplified what that means so she called joseph by his outer robe saying lie with me but he left his robe in a hand and ran so as he fled and got outside as in literally exit he went and stand up in the yard he had just run he run out into the bush he wanted the forest he'd get out of it verse 13 and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his gamut in her hand and was fled forth that she called unto the men of her house no these are egyptians and speak unto them saying see he had brought in and hebrew and this hebrew context here is derogatory she is using it in a derogatory manner to demean joseph to pull joseph down it's like be is i calling him a name then see he had brought in a hebrew unto us the mockers so he came in on to me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried but he left his garment with me and fled and got him out and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home this woman is a piece of worker she hold on to the garment until imam come home she she i say she hold on for their life and she spake unto him according to these words saying at this point he's no longer joseph to her the hebrew servant which has brought unto us came in unto me to mock me and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which is speaking to him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled so potiphar is angry and joseph master took him and put him into the prison so i find this was interesting as i read this a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison so joseph went to prison but the prison that he went to wasn't an ordinary prison he went into the king's prison which was reserved for those who were sentenced by the king where the king's prisoners were bound because no doubt understand the distinction here a slave is already a second-class citizen in the context of this if you want to imprison a slave or a servant you would have a different way of treating them than somebody that the king wants to treat a certain way and even by who was placed there who he encountered there the butler and the baker these were people who were of the king's court so to speak so he's in the king's prison and again verse 21 but the lord was with joseph and it is as if as we know moses wrote this book right so moses is emphasizing through every situation through every turn in his life every corner joseph turned the lord is there wherever you put joseph the lord is there no matter what happened to joseph the lord is there and the lord was with joseph verse 21 and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison and it's as if it keeps repeating itself it's as if joseph just gets in prime for more and more responsibility and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph han all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it so it's as if when joseph enters somewhere whoever was running it could step back and let you over on it the keeper of the prison and if you wonder how clear that is verse 23 the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it to prosper so suddenly the prisoners have to prosper anybody with me could we take a little more chapter 40. and it came to pass after these things i'm going to speak to this because i want to get to the next section that the butler of the king and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt it doesn't say what crime they committed they just said they offended in that day an offense was enough to get imprisoned so the king feared offended he said lock them up and fear was wrought against two of his officers against the chief of his battlers and against the chief of the bakers and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the god into the prison the place where joseph was bound and the captain of the god called joseph and he served them and they continued that season so the captain regarded making no decision anymore he said joseph it'd have two new people to come in i needed to handle them and they dreamed the dream both of them each man is dreaming one night so in other words in the same night each man according to the interpretation of his dream so that simply means that the dream was specific to their situation the butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the prison and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad and he asked for those officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house saying wherefore lookee so sadly today why are they looking depressed anybody with me tonight and the second thing we have dreamed a dream and there's no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell me them i pray you and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me and in the vine was three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot fought and the clusters thereof brought forth right grapes and pharaoh's cup was in my hand and i took the grapes pressed them into pharaoh's cup and i gave the cup into pharaoh's hand and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee into thy place and thou shall deliver fear was cup into his hand after the former manner wendell was his butler in other words you're going to be restored what you had before coming back to you and joseph putting in his own personal request now and this is he said but think on me when it shall be well with thee and show kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house so joseph is prospering but joseph went out he said listen i'm giving you i tell you you're going you're going out in three days you're going out when they get out remember me tell them a story and to see how real it is for joseph and and if you get to it i don't know if tonight next week when the emotion has locked up in joseph it's a lot he's young he's still very young he's experiencing all of this at a very very young age he said think on me when all is good with you and show kindness i pray the unto me and make mention in other words make a petition to pharaoh about me and bring me out of this house for indeed listen i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also i have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon and this here friends is a really profound deep deep deep deep deep statement i have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon if it's one person in scripture that we could say should i be depressed was joseph many of us go into our low moments for things that we did and we regret what we did and we look back and see mistakes we make and we say oh gosh everybody do it differently but joseph is different he under pressure for something he didn't do so you have to have a certain that does something to you when you're there and you didn't do anything and you don't reserve it to know you know what a brand i'm preaching about when somebody says something about you you're already dead to the world when when you don't respond you know you say if if if somebody say you're a lion and you you in the casting i'm saying no it wasn't me i didn't lie he said you died yet you were ready yet so joseph was going through an experience because he didn't do anything he already had to die out you know is a deep dying out that joseph had to go to because the way joseph is sounding now is not like the joseph who spoke to his brothers when he was 17 years old this joseph because in the amplified it actually said he had a arrogance about his tone at 17 where he dreams no he's not talking about no dreams here you know he is confronting the reality of his present situation and said i've done nothing and they put me in this dungeon i was told away say a word for me please he's so i just wanted to catch that and i love this part verse 16 is almost it's unfolds so so the butler get her a wonderful wonderful interpretation the butler's smiling the butler feel the weight lift off his shoulder you know it's like you had a dream boy and well i was wondering about this you know i didn't well brother joseph spoke to me and i feel a level of relief when i found out what my dream mean so moses says here in verse 16 when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good when you read that and he processed that you can see the emotion of the baker going through it when he see that he he fellow prisoner gets a good report he would have approached a certain level of eagerness to get his good report to her so he excited i wanted to see the drama unfolding when the chief breaker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream you know and behold i had three white baskets on my head and in the uppermost basket there was all manner of baker of baked meats with hero and the birds that eat them out off of the back up on my hand and joseph anthony said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days so i can imagine at this point the baker is feeling positive he said this song in just like the butler testimony because so far there's nothing to suggest any deviation from joseph bringing out a positive direction yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from of thee and shall hungry on a tree and the bird shall eat thy flesh of thee and it came to pass the third day which was pharaoh's birthday that he made a feast onto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the chief baker among his servants and he restored the chief butler onto his butler ship again and he gave the cup in the pharaoh's hand and he hung the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgot him so joseph is still there in prison and he's forgotten i don't want to be too much longer again tonight verse chapter 41 but but i want you to notice we talk about joseph there are there are few characters in scripture that this amount of time is taken to express their story when you already look through the characters in scripture how much time is spent on gideon and different ones and and isaac and and and and spent describing even elements of elijah this is joseph growing up in front of us as well similar to how we we can see david as a boy and as a king and as a father and and as an old man on his bed this is joseph's story dr we know joseph said take my bones with you right and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold they came out of the river seven well favored this is cow fat flesh and they fed in the meadow and behold seven came up out of the river ill favor and lean flesh and stood by the other kind upon the brink of the river and the ill favored and the lean flesh kinda eat up the seven well favored and fat kind so pharaoh awoke and he slept and dreamed his second time to the first dream seven fat cows and then seven lean cows the seven lean cows ate the fat ones it shook him out of his sleep and he slept and dreamed his second time and behold seven ears of corn come up from one stalk rank and good and behold 17 ones blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the 17 ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled he knew this had significance he knew this was important and i wanted to understand again the context that we also tracking the genealogy of this thing that the whole reason this is unfolding is to preserve life and a specific line of life as well all right that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them under pharaoh then speak the chief butler onto pharaoh and saying i do remember my faults this day that statement is interesting that do remember my false disney in the in the amplified it says it like this then the chief cabrera spoke the pharaoh saying i would mention my faults today in other words when the butler was restored in a civil butler never talk about what he did to go into prison the butler didn't do as everyday happen so when this happened now we say listen well i want to bring back to your memory if you remember when i didn't mess up two years ago so he said i would bring back to your memory what was the situation that i was in and what it led me to and and uh pharaoh was wrought with a silver and put me in the water the captain of the guards house both me and the chief maker and we dreamed that dream in one night i and he we dream each man according to the interpretation of his dream and there was there with us a young man you see how they see joseph there's a young man and hebrew servant to the captain of the god and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he didn't interpret and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored into my office and him he hanged and pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dudgeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and he came into pharaoh and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that could interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou can't understand a dream to interpret it and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me again i want us a note that at no point in time joseph ever claimed to do anything he always put it back on god god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace so notice joseph didn't even say god will use me to give the answer he was completely dedicated to acknowledging god so he was that this is this is what the lord gave me to give you he wasn't even seeing him like that i want this to catch this subtle subtle messaging here right and pharaoh son of the joseph in my dream behold i stood in the bank of the river and he basically repeats it behold they came up to the river seven fat cows and they fed on the meadow and behold seven lean and it goes on and behold seven years and it goes on to verse 25 and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one in other words the cause and the stalk and everything is really one dream god has showed pharaoh what he's about to do now i want us to catch his friends abraham isaac jacob and jacob has 12 sons jacob is in no position to take of his family during the famine if god showed jacob what was about to take place he couldn't preserve the family he didn't have the resources the greenery the facilities the land so god is using egypt to store food to preserve his children i want to take care of these small things right so the dream of pharaoh is one god had showed pharaoh what he's about to do the seven good kind of seven years and the seven good years are seven years the dream is won and the seventh thin and ill-favored kind that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty years blasted with the east wing shall be seven years of famine this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he show it unto pharaoh behold there comes seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt and they shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the farmer shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it will be very grievous and for that the dream was doubled under pharaoh joseph saying because god the reason that you got a dream twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass in other words this is guaranteed to happen now therefore look at this young man speaking now now again this is joseph he's a wrong feast like 30 years old now so it's 13 years from him being sold into slavery at 8 17. he's now 30 years old let pharaoh do this and let him know verse 3 now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenty of years in other words twenty percent of the fruit of the land you will collect it as taxes over these seven years and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and that food shall be a store to the land against his seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt and the land perished not through the farm that the land perished not to the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants i'm getting ready to to close up and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of god is in the amplified pharaoh was actually so he wasn't seeing a man like this as in what joseph described in the amplified the bible said so pharaoh said to his servants can we find a man like this and he was speaking to this as in jesus specifically a man equal to joseph so joseph described the man and phil was saying can we find a man like joseph in whom is the divine god all right so pharaoh said unto his sermon can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of god is so he already identified joseph as the type of the man he looking for and pharaoh said unto joseph as much as god had showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as to what and listen to the proclamation now thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou you talk about establishing authority and power and pharaoh stand under jesus see i have set thee over or the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestiges of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had i don't know how much other chariots that pharaoh had but pharaoh had the first chariot and joseph had his second chariot and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him a ruler over all the land of egypt and verse 44 i love verse 44 and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without be shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt in the amplified it says moreover pharaoh said to joseph though i am pharaoh yet without your permission shall no man raise his hand to do anything or set his foot to go anywhere in all the land of egypt all classes of people shall submit to your authority this is something i'll say mind blowing it and pharaoh called joseph's name zafnat paneer and gave him to wife asana the daughter of potiphara priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt and joseph was 30 years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went through all the land of egypt and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the stream and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering you know we stopped counting for it was without number and unto joseph was born two sons before the years of famine kim which asana the daughter of potiphara wise wife a priest of one day unto him and joseph called the name of the force born manasseh you know the tribe of manasseh for god said he had made me forget all my toil and all my father's house and the name of the second called ephraim for god had caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were and the seven years of death began to come according as joseph had said and that was in all the lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph when he said to what he said to you do and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine wax saw in the land of egypt and all the countries came into egypt and joseph to buy corn because that the famine was so so in all lands we will pause here tonight may the lord have a blessing in the reading of his word we will have to finish this because i need to tie this all together and the unfolding of joseph to his brethren and uh i trust that you were blessed tonight and we will see how this connects to the new testament and when we get back into the book of revelation i don't want to kind of pick these things up to map these things out as well so can we bow our heads a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you tonight lord for this time of fellowship around your word lord to take our time and lord to spend some time in the book of genesis around joseph and we know that joseph was a type lord of christ lord and hate without a cause nothing against joseph glory was sold for 20 pieces of silver and lord he typed it out with with judah says carriette and lord attend the business of silver and jesus ministry at 30 and joseph coming into power at 13 from prison to power and all these types lord we have to scripture lord let us see how you use joseph lord to preserve life lord lord not only his life not only the testimony but the genealogy lord of his brethren and how he would unfold to all the tribes of israel lord and even lord how lord they would end up into egypt and unfold the great prophet moses and unfold all that would take place lord it had to pass through this week it had to be this way there was no accident with you what judah went through what joseph went through it would not have been easy when he was being carted away to egypt he didn't understand he didn't he realized he was in anguish he was in pain and by the grace of god we'd see all that unfold how emotional he would have been how emotional he still was in his later years when he still could have reminisced the pain of his experience but he could look back and see how you kept him all along and there was a bigger plan there was a bigger purpose there was a plan of redemption and lord for us in this room tonight lord so fearful to come around your word there's so many things we may not understand so many experiences we have gone through so many things we have experienced lord and we can look back now and see it has
