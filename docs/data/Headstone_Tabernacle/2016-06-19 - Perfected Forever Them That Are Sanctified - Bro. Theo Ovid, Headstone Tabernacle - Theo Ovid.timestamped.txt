[19:34] Every
[19:35] Day greetings and Happy Father's Day to
[19:38] all the fathers Among
[19:39] [Music]
[19:43] Us it's a privilege a blessing and honor
[19:46] to be a
[19:48] father it's part
[19:50] of what God himself desired to
[19:53] be and he
[19:55] is so longing in him to express
[20:00] fatherhood amen amen and he longing for
[20:03] us to become
[20:05] fathers in God Amen in the gospel in
[20:09] maturity not children not young men but
[20:12] fathers amen adopted Sons Hallelujah it
[20:16] is his good pleasure that we be
[20:18] adopted he's not scratching his head
[20:21] wondering he wants us to be adopted amen
[20:26] but because of his love and his honor he
[20:29] has to keep his
[20:30] word judgment is not God Vex with people
[20:34] it's not God angry with people judgment
[20:37] is the nature of God because of his
[20:41] Justice and
[20:43] righteousness Hallelujah that is what
[20:46] makes him
[20:47] God and we appreciate him and we love
[20:51] him oh praise God so God bless you again
[20:54] and welcome we certainly
[20:57] appreciate each one of you coming out
[20:59] here this morning and we had a really
[21:01] powerful prayer meeting on Thursday
[21:04] night and I brought
[21:09] exaltation from Isaiah
[21:11] 40 Every
[21:15] Mountain Every Mountain and Hill shall
[21:18] be made low the crooked and even P made
[21:21] straight level rough places made plain
[21:24] and then you're going to see the glory
[21:25] of God do he amplify the voice of one
[21:28] chist prepare ye in the wilderness
[21:30] prepare ye the way of the Lord say clear
[21:33] away obstacles make straight and smooth
[21:36] in the desert a highway for our God Amen
[21:40] so The Valleys have to get built up the
[21:42] mountains have to get level the Crooked
[21:44] places have to make straight and the
[21:46] rough places get smooth in order to make
[21:49] a way for the glory of God to begin to
[21:52] Rule
[21:52] now upon your life isn't that right we
[21:57] talk about the mountains fully hard
[22:00] resistant areas in your life of Pride
[22:02] and
[22:03] unbelief critical attitudes and
[22:06] self-righteousness isn't that right amen
[22:08] talk about the rough places becoming
[22:10] smooth inconsistencies in your lives
[22:12] harshness in relationships to others
[22:15] being impatient and irritable but this
[22:18] one caught me 2 Corinthians 7:14 If my
[22:21] people not not anybody If my people God
[22:25] is very specific he's not talking about
[22:27] others he say my people that are called
[22:29] by my name shall shall humble themselves
[22:33] and pray and turn from their Wicked Ways
[22:35] then you're going to hear from Heaven
[22:37] man God going to heal your land amen
[22:39] humble yourself and that speaks of
[22:41] Brokenness pray pray to realize your
[22:45] dependency upon God Amen I love this one
[22:48] to se God face intimate relationship
[22:50] Hallelujah that have nothing to do with
[22:51] friends and talk and you're watching in
[22:53] front some set sermon listen no no no
[22:55] that's you seeking his face turn from
[22:58] your Wicked Ways repentance that's the
[23:00] only way you could turn from what you're
[23:02] doing you had to repent repent is to
[23:04] turn around like something I preach a
[23:06] while ago about to pleasing God you have
[23:09] to have an intent to please God if you
[23:11] want to improve on your marriage
[23:12] relationship you have to have an intent
[23:14] for that you can't just say you want to
[23:16] improve you want to do this no you have
[23:17] to intent you want to study you have to
[23:19] have an intent and then the desire to
[23:21] study and other things could be added to
[23:23] that but if you don't have an intent to
[23:25] change you'll see Just As You
[23:27] Are and nothing could really move you
[23:29] and change you that is why we read the
[23:32] scripture last service about Jesus
[23:33] asking that young man if you want to be
[23:36] perfect in other words I'm not going to
[23:38] force you you you know yourself you you
[23:40] you do this you do that you do but if
[23:42] you want to be perfect you have
[23:43] something to give up you have something
[23:45] to let go you have to release some of
[23:48] the stuff in your life in order to make
[23:50] room for Perfection to really get a hole
[23:52] upon you because you really want this
[23:55] word to become flesh you really want
[23:57] that you have been Church long enough
[23:59] but you don't want that no more you want
[24:01] this word to become flesh the Bible said
[24:03] and the word became flesh and dwell
[24:06] Among Us it's got to come into your
[24:07] flesh Hallelujah do you believe that
[24:09] hallelujah amen so four things here
[24:13] humble pray seek God's face turn from
[24:16] Wicked Ways that's on our side that's
[24:19] what God asked us if we could do that
[24:21] then Revival is guaranteed on its way
[24:24] then if we do that he said he going to
[24:26] hear our prayer he going to forgive our
[24:28] sins
[24:28] and going toal our could we give the
[24:31] Lord a shout of
[24:34] Praise Hallelujah so Pride flows and
[24:38] shows itself in Independence
[24:40] self-centeredness
[24:41] arrogance when you're praying you show
[24:44] how much you depend upon God isn't that
[24:46] right and the answer to Pride is
[24:49] Brokenness Brokenness
[24:51] [Music]
[24:53] Hallelujah
[24:55] Brokenness what I long for
[25:00] [Music]
[25:01] Brokenness is what I
[25:03] [Music]
[25:08] need
[25:11] Brokenness
[25:13] Brokenness what you
[25:15] want from
[25:20] me from
[25:24] me
[25:26] righteousness right
[25:29] [Music]
[25:31] rightousness what I long for what I long
[25:37] for oh
[25:39] [Music]
[25:42] god oh Hallelujah

[27:36] to
[27:38] your to
[27:40] your oh
[27:43] Lord you may be seated before we go into
[27:47] the
[27:49] scriptures I want to bring something to
[27:52] you amen
[28:02] brother
[28:03] BR remember Church you're living in the
[28:07] best day you will ever live in right
[28:10] now until Jesus
[28:13] comes it will not gradually but rapidly
[28:17] get worse and worse when Russia goes
[28:20] down there for that oil look out that o
[28:22] she needs that's what the prophet said
[28:24] it would do and then we ready for it
[28:26] then
[28:28] in 1914 the world went to war and they
[28:30] had never been at peace since constantly
[28:32] swinging swinging swinging they're
[28:34] holding they're doing the very same
[28:36] thing yet what was they doing holding he
[28:39] say oh God have mercy holding that great
[28:41] thing I saw in the vision the whole
[28:44] thing BEC into destruction holding the
[28:48] atomic holding the wars that they don't
[28:51] destroy themselves until the thing come
[28:54] to destroy it until Israel returns back
[28:56] and get herself together then the the
[28:58] message will go to Israel and she be
[29:00] sealed with the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[29:03] amen after the Gentile is called out
[29:07] amen the people for his name's sake will
[29:09] be called out and the Israel receive a
[29:11] three and a year six Monon
[29:14] message so we know but say he had seven
[29:17] Visions which he said must come to pass
[29:18] before Jesus comes again the seven
[29:21] vision is where America was bummed
[29:24] up he start talk about I know we did
[29:27] this before but feel that to do it again
[29:30] he said the America built two horn civil
[29:33] ecclesiastical Powers lamb freedom of
[29:35] religion but after a while they spoke
[29:38] like a dragon people who follow the
[29:41] pillar of fire will certainly have a
[29:43] rough time but they are ready for the
[29:46] translation at that time Hallelujah
[29:49] ready to go amen so I want you to
[29:52] understand it's no
[29:57] picnic yeah amen everybody with
[29:59] [Applause]
[30:01] me because they were called Chosen and
[30:04] faithful the elected of God Amen now
[30:08] watch watch there is a pharaoh who knew
[30:12] not
[30:13] Joseph what was Joseph represented
[30:17] question answer the spiritual part of a
[30:22] spiritual
[30:25] Exodus now bear in mind the first Exodus
[30:28] was a natural land to a natural land to
[30:31] the land of Canaan land the second
[30:33] Exodus was from a natural land Canaan
[30:35] land into a spiritual baptism in the
[30:37] upper room the Third Exodus is from a
[30:40] spiritual baptism into the land of the
[30:42] Millennium that's the Third Exodus so
[30:44] what b is saying here is prophecy he
[30:47] said what does Joseph
[30:49] represent he said the spiritual part in
[30:53] this spiritual
[30:54] Exodus that is what Joseph represent yes
[30:57] sir there watch there raises up now we
[31:00] have freedom the woman now of a time but
[31:03] finally a
[31:05] pharaoh
[31:07] dictator this is coming to America
[31:11] Now who knew not the freedom of
[31:16] religion uniting them together don't let
[31:18] this pass you there come a time where
[31:22] there was a pharaoh first had to
[31:26] come there was a pharaoh who raised up
[31:30] who knew not Joseph and that was the
[31:32] beginning of the beginning that was the
[31:35] beginning of the
[31:37] Exodus so once you see Pharaoh raising
[31:40] up you know we on our way out of
[31:44] here oh Hallelujah because Pharaoh
[31:47] raising up means Moses is coming to
[31:50] deliver the
[31:51] people se he had to die and the next man
[31:54] to raise up who knew not
[31:56] Joseph I don't have to read everything
[31:58] here but while ramse is going in power
[32:00] Moses going in power while the dictator
[32:03] rising in power the bride raising in
[32:05] power God ain't going to leave us like
[32:09] this oh I'm feeling something
[32:13] nowah Hallelujah so you recognize this
[32:17] is not for church
[32:18] members just all church member want is a
[32:20] church to go to
[32:29] all right let's read a little
[32:30] further
[32:32] God per okay let me back up a little
[32:35] bit all right there's a pharaoh who
[32:37] raised up who knew not Joseph that was
[32:39] the beginning of the Exodus and when
[32:42] that thing begin to form one under a
[32:45] political power begin to form form God
[32:51] begin to get
[32:54] ready the iniquity of the amorites was
[32:56] fulfilled the time that he promise Abram
[32:59] was fulfilled the time of Deliverance
[33:01] was at hand God permitted a pharaoh to
[33:04] rise up raise up who knew not Joseph and
[33:06] Ramsey was born after sikam ramse and
[33:09] ramse was was the one who knew not the
[33:11] blessings of Joseph he watch and he
[33:14] didn't know what the spiritual side was
[33:17] and I think if any man was spiritual
[33:20] could see what's taking place now we are
[33:23] getting a pharaoh who knows not freedom
[33:26] of religion and that time he was saying
[33:28] this when our president took his office
[33:31] he would not swear that he believed in
[33:32] freedom of religion this 963 thir
[33:35] exellence but they rais up a pharaoh who
[33:37] knew not Joseph the same thing today a
[33:39] man has raised up took oath in the White
[33:42] House and will not swear to this oat
[33:44] will not take his oat that he believes
[33:46] in freedom of religion when this new
[33:48] pope you talk about oh skip that let's
[33:50] go a little further at the time Ramses
[33:52] in Egypt was growing his power was
[33:54] growing the natural man Ramses was
[33:56] growing the natural man the Antichrist
[33:58] is growing now through
[34:01] politics not the religious
[34:05] yet oh my all right true
[34:13] politics right he already got to the
[34:16] White House in religion he got the
[34:18] people all sced up till they already
[34:20] they actually will fall right for it and
[34:24] the denominational leaders practically
[34:26] everyone every church that's in this
[34:28] nation is already in the confer churches
[34:30] Ramsey is growing they're all United
[34:32] together and what they have what does it
[34:35] do it makes a power a beast like the
[34:38] first one now there's a persecution
[34:40] coming upon all those who won't Unite
[34:43] with it and a boycot it will be too late
[34:48] then you already took the mark don't say
[34:51] I'll do it then you better do it now
[34:53] ramsy was growing remember while Ramsey
[34:56] was growing in power God had Moses in
[34:59] the wilderness he was growing
[35:02] too so it has to have a bride on Earth
[35:05] growing too they have to have a bride
[35:07] coming into Power if the be system
[35:10] coming into Power there's got to be a
[35:12] move of the spirit of God upon a bright
[35:15] Bunch called out by seven tunders
[35:18] because seven tunders gather the bright
[35:20] together get the bright Faith to call
[35:22] for power so they got to have a seven

[38:28] Ephesians

[38:33] 11 and they give some Apostles and some
[38:35] prophets and some evangelists and some
[38:38] pastors and teachers for the Perfection
[38:41] of the Saints for the work of the
[38:43] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[38:45] Christ to be all come in the unity of
[38:48] the faith of the knowledge of the Son of
[38:49] God unto a perfect man un the measure of
[38:53] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[38:55] and Hebrews chap 10
[38:58] from verse 11 we read every priest
[39:01] standed daily ministering and offering
[39:03] of
[39:05] times the same sacrifices which can
[39:08] never take away sins but this man after
[39:12] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[39:16] forever sat down at the right hand of
[39:19] God from hence forth expecting till his
[39:23] enemies be made his foot stol for by one
[39:27] offering he had perfected forever them
[39:32] that are Sanctified whereof the Holy
[39:34] Ghost also bear witness to us for after
[39:37] that he had said before this is the
[39:39] Covenant that I will make with them in
[39:42] those days say the Lord I will put my
[39:45] laws into their hearts and in their
[39:47] minds will I write them and their sins
[39:50] and iniquity will remember no more let's
[39:52] pray father we thank you for your word
[39:54] blessed to our hearts Lord I wait on you
[39:57] Lord make the word be
[40:00] transformed into the lives and hearts of
[40:02] the people we ask in Jesus name May a
[40:05] Spirit come and confirm your word to
[40:06] them amen and amen you may be seated oh
[40:09] praise the Lord
[40:12] hallelujah
[40:17] Glory huj
[40:24] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[40:27] oh thank you Lord
[40:30] Jesus when the dynamic struck the
[40:34] Pentecostals they could not come to
[40:37] Perfection
[40:39] why this is very
[40:43] important because people looking for
[40:46] Spirit they're looking for power but the
[40:49] Pentecostal got power and spirit and it
[40:52] didn't come true they had powerful
[40:55] testimonies they were speaking in
[40:57] tongues they were Healing The Sick
[40:59] casting out Devils they had a testimony
[41:02] woman one time they got people got so
[41:03] vexed they got shotguns and shoot at
[41:05] them and the bullet just fall down off
[41:07] their
[41:08] clothing without even harming
[41:11] them powerful
[41:13] Miracles powerful testimonies the
[41:16] anointing was blocks away before he even
[41:18] reach the church people were falling
[41:20] down on the streets from the dynamic
[41:22] power that was released 1906 Pentecostal
[41:26] Revival Hallelujah you heard what I said
[41:29] blocks away from the church itself where
[41:32] they were gathered together the people
[41:34] were being healed in the streets the
[41:36] people were fallong in the streets they
[41:38] even have to reach the church the glory
[41:40] and the anointing and the power was
[41:42] emanating from
[41:44] inside out to the people you just had to
[41:47] be there they had testimony piano
[41:50] playing by itself people got Gifts of
[41:52] playing and music when they just get it
[41:54] they just start to play like if they all
[41:55] was playing all kind of Miracles and
[41:58] power yet they couldn't come to
[42:05] Perfection Hallelujah so it takes
[42:07] something more than just
[42:11] Spirit it takes the
[42:13] word and the spirit so God sent the
[42:17] prophet with the word and the Pentecost
[42:19] rejected the prophet and to this day
[42:21] they still have all the gifts they had
[42:23] since way back then because you cannot
[42:25] come to Perfection by gifts
[42:29] come on now come on now not not your
[42:32] preaching gift not your teaching gift
[42:34] not your not your not your tongue
[42:35] speaking gifts you have to only come to
[42:37] Perfection by the word Jesus
[42:41] Christ Hallelujah you have to be C in
[42:44] that
[42:51] Perfection H oh praise the Lord
[42:54] bless amen
[42:58] Hallelujah Glory I feel blessed this
[43:01] morning to know out of millions of
[43:03] people not then I come to this message
[43:06] you know that have been called to
[43:08] Perfection it's a little more than just
[43:10] coming to this message it have endless
[43:12] called to this message but praise God
[43:14] have no Perfection they getting from it
[43:16] at all they have interpretation amen yes
[43:20] so the
[43:22] Pentecostal did not could not take the
[43:26] word that brings
[43:29] discipline to be formed into the word
[43:32] image amen that God would approve Sons
[43:37] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[43:40] pleased remember when brother Brandon
[43:42] went first Pentecost he thought he was
[43:43] among
[43:44] angels all Supernatural and power of God
[43:48] this was the spirit of God and whatnot
[43:49] until a vision broke and he saw one of
[43:52] those gifted men living with somebody
[43:54] else who was not his wife then that thr
[43:56] him into
[43:57] SP what on Earth is this it was the
[44:01] genuine Holy Ghost it was genuine Spirit
[44:04] operation but something was wrong in the
[44:07] Inner
[44:09] Man so he went into the cave to ask God
[44:13] what is
[44:14] this and the god hope of the scriptures
[44:17] Hebrews 6 I believe it was to show him
[44:19] the rainfall on the just and the unjust
[44:22] amen it's the Holy Ghost but the seed is
[44:24] not there it produce a different life
[44:27] [Applause]
[44:29] come on now come on now so it's not just
[44:33] Spirit but a
[44:35] seed which is the word so then he had to
[44:38] reveal son of man who is the S of the
[44:42] seed oh Hallelujah so we today have a
[44:46] revelation of the words of the son of
[44:48] man come on now come on now come on now
[44:52] that's why we could quote it that's why
[44:55] we could preach it that's why we to stay
[44:57] with it because this is not the words of
[44:59] a man it's the revealing of the son of
[45:03] [Applause]
[45:08] man oh
[45:10] Hallelujah some people say we can't
[45:12] preach we are a quot we can't preach um

[45:25] not the angel I didn't bring down the
[45:26] book I didn't open the book I couldn't

[57:58] Hallelujah you may be
[58:01] seated
[58:03] Hallelujah for message the perf
[58:05] Perfection the
[58:07] BR God being infinite who cannot lie
[58:11] cannot speak anything contrary am knows
[58:14] everything just as perfect as in the
[58:16] beginning as he is at the ending just as
[58:19] perfect at the end he was in the
[58:21] beginning God is endless like eternity
[58:24] you can never find the corner of a
[58:25] perfect Circle you could run throughout
[58:28] the ages and Eternity it will never have
[58:30] an end to it that's the way God is he is
[58:33] infinite and perfect he always will be
[58:37] the same he can never change he is
[58:40] perfectly the same now this great chain
[58:44] of perfection was broken by time
[58:49] space my God I'm in my own world here
[58:52] this morning I'm in my own world here
[58:54] this morning he said great circle that
[58:57] chain of perfection was broken by time
[59:01] space time came because of
[59:05] sin the circle was eternity but time
[59:08] broke it listen to these words let's see
[59:11] a perfect circle and my wife call it a
[59:14] little hickey a little drop in the chain
[59:16] eternity continues on but it's not in
[59:20] perfect condition there's a little Gap
[59:23] breaks over this way God had to do that
[59:27] because Satan caused it and it dropped
[59:29] down to space of time for trying and the
[59:34] perfecting and the purging of the
[59:39] Lost
[59:43] hallu remember remember we bypass our
[59:47] theophany to be put on Earth to be
[59:51] tested and
[59:53] triy that's why time space come on
[59:56] there's a purpose of time space to get
[59:59] us
[1:00:00] perfected because when the devil kick
[1:00:02] that little kicky and and we broke into
[1:00:04] time space we have to get back into
[1:00:08] eternity we cannot go back to Eternity
[1:00:12] perverted we have to go back to Eternity
[1:00:14] perfected but he has perfected
[1:00:20] forever them that are Sanctified so
[1:00:23] you're going to understand why Jesus
[1:00:25] died to bring blood ah woo my
[1:00:29] God forgive me I'm excited this morning
[1:00:33] Jesus died to bring blood sanctifying
[1:00:36] blood blood that you could understand
[1:00:38] when he look through that blood he don't
[1:00:40] see your faults he don't see your
[1:00:41] mistakes he don't see your failures he
[1:00:44] see you ah perfected
[1:00:50] [Applause]
[1:00:57] hallah Perfection
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:01] guaranteed
[1:01:03] okay so watch God had to do that because
[1:01:06] Satan caused it to drop down to space
[1:01:07] time for the trying and the perfecting
[1:01:10] and the persing of the lost that God by
[1:01:14] Sovereign Grace might someday lift that
[1:01:16] little hickey or Gap back into a perfect
[1:01:19] circle then she rolls on just the same
[1:01:23] time now time is this Loop it Loops down
[1:01:28] Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but
[1:01:31] he stepped into time space and was made
[1:01:34] flesh and came to here in order to
[1:01:38] sanctify or put a streak of blood all
[1:01:42] across the place to redeem it to connect
[1:01:45] it back to God for eternity you help me
[1:01:49] my God I feel like going across the
[1:01:50] horizontal rainbow my God I feel like
[1:01:53] that old man this place don't have
[1:01:55] enough room for me this morning did you
[1:01:58] hear what he did Jesus broke through
[1:02:00] time space come down here to bring the
[1:02:03] blood to redeem us to reconnect us back
[1:02:06] or to that
[1:02:07] ah and I can't shout this morning my God
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:20] hallelujah you see that's all time is
[1:02:24] then God when it started here the little
[1:02:27] kink in A Perfect Circle a little kink
[1:02:30] in it when God started here he was
[1:02:32] perfect everything was perfect

[1:37:45] said under their Messenger will be the
[1:37:47] final voice to the final age he said
[1:37:51] once more the world will hear direct
[1:37:53] from God that not on books and
[1:37:56] tapes that is not books and tapes
[1:38:00] Hallelujah once more the world will hear
[1:38:03] direct from God because the voice of God

[1:44:59] praise so big sin needs
[1:45:02] blood and small sin needs blood because

[1:48:52] but Bram the God of this world this some
[1:48:55] Satan
[1:48:57] Eden the God of this world
[1:49:00] today the worship person of this world
[1:49:02] today is
[1:49:04] Satan and the people are ignorant of
[1:49:07] worshiping Satan it's Satan imperson
[1:49:11] himself as the
[1:49:13] church now this is deep this is not skim
[1:49:16] milk there's not no devil there with no
[1:49:18] two horn and red with a big fork we
[1:49:21] could see that one
[1:49:23] because said that is him but this one
[1:49:26] here is the one we want to focus
[1:49:30] on it is Satan imperson himself as the
[1:49:34] church they worship Satan thinking that
[1:49:38] they are worshiping God through the
[1:49:40] church aha so now it come back now to
[1:49:44] what it really is so then they love
[1:49:47] their Church they love what they see
[1:49:50] they love their dreams they love what
[1:49:51] they feel they love the emotions they
[1:49:55] don't love the word when the word come
[1:49:56] because the word checks them the word

[1:50:23] [Applause]
[1:50:25] watch they worship Satan thinking they
[1:50:27] are worshiping God through the church
[1:50:29] but it's the way Satan done it the way
[1:50:31] you see wait a minute we preach the word
[1:50:33] look back here at my text tonight Satan
[1:50:36] was the one that preached the word to
[1:50:38] eph he said God had said it was a
[1:50:42] misconstruing that part of the scripture
[1:50:45] that applies to the day he would let you
[1:50:48] know all Jesus did was perfectly well he
[1:50:50] would let you know what all MOS did was
[1:50:51] perfectly well when you you take the
[1:50:53] promises that they give for this day
[1:50:55] then that was apply to another age
[1:50:57] people ignorantly worshiping Satan
[1:51:00] thinking they are worshiping God as we
[1:51:02] are warned by prophecy and this is some
[1:51:05] Paul in first in Thessalonians we be se
[1:51:08] you Brethren by the coming of the Lord
[1:51:10] Jesus and by the Gathering Together of
[1:51:11] him the coming of the Lord Gathering of
[1:51:13] him that that you be not soon shaken or
[1:51:16] troubled in spirit or in your mind let
[1:51:18] no man deceive you by any means for that
[1:51:20] day shall not come except they come a
[1:51:23] falling away first we're not talking
[1:51:26] about backsliding falling away now we
[1:51:29] talking about a fall away from God I
[1:51:31] following from the word I follow away
[1:51:33] from the promises I follow from
[1:51:35] prophetic utterance I following from
[1:51:37] that yes yes
[1:51:41] yes Hallelujah until the man of be
[1:51:43] revealed he said now this deceitfulness
[1:51:46] of the church today the son of pedition
[1:51:48] now people worshiping Satan in his this
[1:51:51] day thinking they worshiping God now
[1:51:53] let's let him tell us what that is they
[1:51:55] are worshiping him through a
[1:51:59] Creed we believe this did the prophet
[1:52:02] say that no you can't find it but it
[1:52:03] revealed it's a hidden
[1:52:06] Mystery well hide it from me please keep
[1:52:09] that one
[1:52:10] hidden watch they're worshiping through
[1:52:13] a Creed a manmade denominations and
[1:52:17] Creeds that brought the people right
[1:52:19] down to the greatest deception that the
[1:52:21] world has ever known no matter how much
[1:52:23] the word of God promised for this day is
[1:52:25] preached and Vindicated they still won't
[1:52:28] believe it you Holiness people we
[1:52:31] believe in sanctification and you're
[1:52:33] taking your own you just quit this and
[1:52:35] quit that unless Christ opened the door
[1:52:38] and Quicken it to your heart and you
[1:52:41] come to a place where sin is dead and
[1:52:42] desire is all gone it's
[1:52:46] self-righteousness so the neck Buton up

[1:52:55] don't wear earrings they don't wear this
[1:52:56] don't we that but that is the only
[1:52:58] self-righteousness until Christ come
[1:53:00] into your heart doesn't matter if you
[1:53:04] wear camel
[1:53:07] skinall and you come out the Wilderness
[1:53:10] and you B for

[1:53:43] you are and the whole world sees the
[1:53:46] reflection of Christ in you brother Bram
[1:53:49] I've seen Visions sick healed dead raise
[1:53:53] when they were laying out there and
[1:53:53] doctors walk away they finished and gone
[1:53:56] lay there a couple of hours and Holy
[1:53:57] Spirit come back and show a vision go
[1:53:59] down there and raise that person up deaf
[1:54:01] dumb blind walk that is not it
[1:54:04] that's just attributes amen amen all
[1:54:08] right oh Hallelujah Paul said we'll do
[1:54:11] all this but lay all that aside now
[1:54:13] let's go into Perfection the church
[1:54:16] cannot be perfected through
[1:54:18] organizations it's get further away from
[1:54:21] God all all the time or further away
[1:54:24] from each other we draw barriers we
[1:54:26] separate ourselves seemingly not having
[1:54:28] the faith and then we leave those
[1:54:30] principles of the doctrine if we move
[1:54:32] into Perfection then those little things
[1:54:34] become not of much use all right all
[1:54:36] right amen you see it cling clang sword
[1:54:39] with Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine but when
[1:54:41] you start going to Perfection them Sword
[1:54:43] Play A account amen hallelujah deal with
[1:54:46] the bull is what counts Hallelujah
[1:54:48] dealing with the maniac man is what
[1:54:50] counts dealing with the be is what
[1:54:52] counts and Doctrine can't cut down the
[1:54:55] bull am Doctrine can't send back the
[1:54:58] bees am it will take Perfection to do
[1:55:02] [Applause]
[1:55:03] that hallu Hallelujah so that's why B
[1:55:07] said love came over him and then he tell
[1:55:08] the bull stop love send the bees love
[1:55:11] dealt with this love what is that that
[1:55:13] is perfection
[1:55:15] Hallelujah but this is deep he said we
[1:55:18] go into a relationship and we find out
[1:55:21] the only way that we can be perfected is
[1:55:23] to be in Christ we find out then by the
[1:55:26] teachings of the Bible That's not how we
[1:55:29] get into Christ not by water baptism not
[1:55:32] by laying on hands not by teaching not
[1:55:34] by teaching but by one Spirit we are
[1:55:37] baptized into one body and become
[1:55:39] perfected through his suffering then we
[1:55:42] look different we think different we act
[1:55:44] different we live different not because
[1:55:46] it's a Duty or we belong to church but
[1:55:49] because the love of God is shed abroad

[1:59:04] voices seven spirits Through The Seven
[1:59:08] Ages and gather up in a son of man amen
[1:59:12] that was the son of man seven voices

[1:59:20] promises and these words of Pro promises
[1:59:22] going to turn back into seven perfect
[1:59:24] Spirits so God collected all his
[1:59:26] scattered word tied back in the word to
[1:59:30] bring back the Holy Ghost but Ram
[1:59:32] gathered up all this scattered word
[1:59:33] hallelujah then in him was son of man

[2:09:07] am oh Hallelujah I can't stop now I had
[2:09:10] to finish this here now
[2:09:12] Hallelujah so Jesus he the spirit of God
[2:09:16] dwelt in the fullness in Jesus Christ
[2:09:19] Jesus was the word and the words was
[2:09:23] invisible now listen close the word was
[2:09:26] invisible until it was made
[2:09:28] flesh then the word becomes visible so
[2:09:32] when you begin to see visible evidence
[2:09:35] and manifestation of God in our midst it
[2:09:38] would means that the word is becoming
[2:09:42] flesh because as the word becomes flesh
[2:09:44] the invisible becomes
[2:09:47] visible you're going to see God you're
[2:09:50] going to see God Amen Let Me prophesy
[2:09:53] you will see God you will see the
[2:09:56] invisible become visible right in front
[2:09:59] of your eyes hallelujah hallelujah oh
[2:10:03] glory to God oh Hallelujah so this
[2:10:07] invisible God is the word
[2:10:11] amen Ministry of the word but the
[2:10:14] visible going to be the ministry of the
[2:10:17] spirit Hallelujah from the guide the
[2:10:19] Holy Spirit watch remember faith and
[2:10:22] virtue now remember the Holy Spirit
[2:10:25] cannot cap the building of God until
[2:10:28] these things are operating by the spirit
[2:10:31] amen he didn't say by Revelation he
[2:10:33] didn't say by intellect he said the
[2:10:35] virtues have to begin to operate by the
[2:10:37] spirit when that begin toer your spirit
[2:10:39] is subconscious behavior is not sister
[2:10:41] coming so oh gosh I I she a nice smile
[2:10:44] God bless you Sister no that that's you
[2:10:46] operating it that's right that's not
[2:10:48] operating by the spirit operating by the
[2:10:49] spirit means it's thundering it's
[2:10:51] flowing it's living through you you
[2:10:54] can't even help
[2:10:56] it now I didn't read the story when B
[2:11:00] say we always trying to Gorge somebody
[2:11:01] eyes but he had an experience he went to
[2:11:04] a restaurant and there was a woman there
[2:11:07] middle age short pants on talking with
[2:11:10] some man music playing and he said God
[2:11:13] is this a place that you're going to
[2:11:14] raise up my children to be in why don't
[2:11:16] you condemn this place he felt a top on
[2:11:19] his shoulder God pull him to the side
[2:11:21] broke a vision upon him he saw himself
[2:11:23] as a child all the sins he doing and
[2:11:25] whatnot his sins coming up to God he saw
[2:11:28] the blood of Jesus as a bumper pushing
[2:11:29] it off he saw a book with all his sins
[2:11:32] in it and God M pardon put the see of
[2:11:34] forgetfulness and then God tell him I
[2:11:36] forgive you and you condemn
[2:11:41] her now I know preachers Don't Preach
[2:11:43] about that because much condemnation
[2:11:46] going on they they don't want to hear
[2:11:47] about
[2:11:49] that God told him I you condemn I I
[2:11:53] forgive you go do tell nothing more
[2:11:56] again nothing more nothing more that's
[2:11:58] just a vision let's see what he going to
[2:12:00] do now so he comes to the woman and say
[2:12:02] woman listen listen listen I was just
[2:12:04] condemning you and I was saying this and
[2:12:06] saying and God show me this the want
[2:12:08] said to break in tears she said I was a
[2:12:10] Christian and this happened and that
[2:12:12] happened and her back sliding and
[2:12:14] whatnot and right there on the floor
[2:12:16] they kneel down in the floor in the
[2:12:18] restaurant and that woman was restored
[2:12:20] back right on the floor because the man
[2:12:23] get a revelation that the blood is not
[2:12:25] only for
[2:12:31] him come on now come on now some people
[2:12:36] might have walked inside of that and
[2:12:37] when they see the woman carrying on so
[2:12:38] you walk back out not me and that Banner
[2:12:40] not me and that
[2:12:42] restaurant but the experience change
[2:12:45] brother Mam's
[2:12:47] perspective to see through the eyes of
[2:12:50] God
[2:12:51] amen hallelujah God don't see as man
[2:12:56] sees that's the problem
[2:12:59] today I don't have it here but brother
[2:13:01] Bram said how would God take these
[2:13:04] unlearned fishermen to put them in
[2:13:07] ministries for the perfecting of the
[2:13:10] Saints why would God bypass the
[2:13:14] theological experts in the book of Moses
[2:13:18] in the form of Pharisees and sagues who
[2:13:20] already know the word that's right them
[2:13:22] listening to tapes since their
[2:13:24] youth

[2:13:29] bab they since a talk then the lineage
[2:13:32] of scriptures so it would have been
[2:13:34] sensible to get these educated scripture
[2:13:38] taught people to take on the ministry
[2:13:41] but God don't think the way man
[2:13:43] thinks God went for find people who was
[2:13:46] never in those scriptures Peter was just
[2:13:49] I know smoking grass whatever it is
[2:13:51] smoking and drinking and whatever it is
