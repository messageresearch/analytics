[43:06] morning. There are things that we see.
[43:09] There are things that we could
[43:10] acknowledge that we could thank God for.
[43:12] But even more importantly are the things
[43:14] we do not see. The angel of the Lord
[43:17] stepping in here, stepping in there,
[43:19] blocking us here, and you tried to
[43:20] figure out why something didn't work out
[43:22] and God kept you right here because if
[43:24] you had gone on further, it would have
[43:26] been a different story. So, we have a
[43:28] reason to thank the Lord this morning.
[43:29] Can we give the Lord a hand of praise?
[43:31] Can we thank him? Can we acknowledge his
[43:34] goodness? Can we thank him not just for
[43:36] what he does for us, but thank him for
[43:38] the trials? Thank him for the testings.
[43:41] Thank him for the things we do not
[43:42] understand. Thank him for the problems
[43:45] that he in his wisdom sends us through
[43:48] to form our character to allow us to
[43:51] grow, to love, to forgive, to dig deeper
[43:55] than ourselves, to go beyond our
[43:57] ambitions, our desires, our motives, and
[44:00] to just see Jesus Christ
[44:02] manifested. Amen. We do have a prayer
[44:05] request this morning from sister June
[44:07] Redhead for my brother Michael Redhead
[44:10] has been diagnosed with a rare condition
[44:13] called granulomaatus. I believe I got
[44:16] that right. It's a condition which
[44:18] attacks the major organs in the body.
[44:21] Please pray for his healing and for him
[44:23] to be filled with the baptism of the
[44:24] Holy Ghost. That's a very noble request
[44:27] this morning. And if you have a request
[44:29] even before we get into the service this
[44:31] morning, you want to show by raising
[44:33] your hands as we approach the throne of
[44:36] grace this morning, looking for God to
[44:38] do something special for us. Let's bow
[44:40] our heads, every eye closed, keep
[44:42] playing something softly. Our gracious
[44:44] heavenly father, we thank you this
[44:45] morning for your love, for your grace,
[44:49] for your kindness, for your mercy, for
[44:51] your faithfulness, and for your
[44:53] promises, for your loving kindness that
[44:56] is better than life. Lord, our lips are
[44:58] here and we are praising you, Father.
[45:01] Lord, we bless your holy name. From the
[45:03] rising of the sun to the going down of
[45:05] the same, your name is worthy to be
[45:06] praised. Uh priests of all would walk
[45:09] with the bells ringing, holy, holy,
[45:11] holy, holy unto the Lord, oh Lord, God
[45:13] almighty father. And we stand, Lord, as
[45:17] Lord, spiritual sacrifices Lord,
[45:19] presenting, Lord, not just our lips and
[45:21] our words and our worship, but we
[45:23] present our bodies a living sacrifice to
[45:25] you. And Lord, where we have fallen
[45:27] short, Father, we ask for forgiveness
[45:29] this morning, Father. Lord, there are so
[45:31] many things we should do that we have
[45:33] not done, Lord. And we come into your
[45:35] house this morning, Lord, knowing that
[45:37] you are a merciful God. And knowing that
[45:39] there's blood that was shed for us, that
[45:41] through your blood, we could have divine
[45:43] access to what's behind the veil,
[45:45] Father. Lord, and when you stood there
[45:48] at the cross at Calvary, the veil was
[45:50] rent from top to bottom to open up
[45:52] access to sons and daughters who were
[45:54] adopted into the family of fellowship,
[45:57] which in times old, only the priests
[45:59] could look therein. But now, Father, are
[46:01] sons and daughters of God that are led
[46:03] by the spirit of God. We could be called
[46:05] the sons of God. So we thank you for
[46:08] your word, for your promises, for your
[46:10] grace, for Lord, how you have kept us
[46:12] all these years, and you have kept us in
[46:14] this year, and you have kept us in the
[46:16] last few months, and you have kept us in
[46:18] the beginning of this month, and you
[46:19] have brought us here into this service
[46:21] this morning. Lord, some are bruised,
[46:23] some are battered, some are tired, some
[46:25] are weary, some in the mountain, some in
[46:27] the valley, some feeling 100%, some
[46:29] feeling 10%. But Lord, we are all
[46:32] gathered here under your blood knowing
[46:34] that you promised that you could finish
[46:36] what you started in us, Father. So we
[46:38] are grateful this morning. We are
[46:40] thankful this morning. And Lord, we have
[46:42] this request this morning for Michael
[46:43] Redhead diagnosed with a rare condition.
[46:46] But Father, we thank you that you are a
[46:48] specialist in rare conditions. We thank
[46:50] you that you excel when the conditions
[46:52] are rare. We thank that you are the
[46:55] great physician that when the doctors
[46:56] don't know what to do, Lord, this is
[46:58] where your court is. The ball is in your
[47:01] court this morning. And we bring every
[47:03] rare condition, every rare case this
[47:05] morning. Every things the doctors don't
[47:07] know what to do with. Every situation
[47:09] the bank doesn't know what to do with,
[47:10] every obstacle, every situation. We
[47:13] bring every rare case to the house to
[47:15] Lord, when you walk the earth, you said
[47:17] they that are well have no need of a
[47:18] physician. So we thank you this morning
[47:22] that you are still a healer. We pray
[47:23] dear God for Michael ready that you heal
[47:26] him even now from the crown of his head
[47:28] to the soles of his feet. May the
[47:30] condition be reversed that is attacking
[47:32] every organ. Father sickness is of the
[47:35] enemy and we send it back from where it
[47:38] come from. House of hell give way to the
[47:40] name of Jesus. Satan take your hands off
[47:43] of God's property. Lord his sister sent
[47:46] in the house asking not just for healing
[47:49] but for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[47:51] There's no greater desire than for a
[47:54] life transformed by the wonder working
[47:56] power of God. So even with our hands
[47:58] raised this morning, we join in faith
[48:01] with her and with every brother, every
[48:03] sister, for every condition, every need,
[48:05] every situation, natural and spiritual,
[48:08] that the angel of the Lord will move
[48:10] through the camp this morning and
[48:12] minister to the sons and daughters of
[48:14] the living God. May you bless your
[48:16] people and may these requests become
[48:17] notes of praises. We commit your church
[48:20] into your hands. We commit your people
[48:21] into your hands. May you bless our
[48:23] pastor this morning. Even as he prepares
[48:26] to preach this morning, Lord, there in
[48:28] in New Jersey, may the angel of the Lord
[48:30] drop down upon him, Lord. May the fire
[48:33] fall, Lord. May the people be blessed,
[48:35] Father. Lord, there for such a time as
[48:38] this, Father. May the anointing, Lord,
[48:40] pour upon him as it never has been
[48:43] before. And may liberty break out here
[48:45] in the US even now. May you bless the
[48:47] service here this morning. May you bless
[48:49] the gatherings all around the world, all
[48:52] around the country of your true elected.
[48:55] It's one body. It's a mystical body, one
[48:58] Lord, one faith, one baptism. May the
[49:00] angel of your Lord be with your people
[49:02] this morning and be with us in your
[49:04] special way. And the church says, and
[49:07] the church says, amen and amen. You may
[49:10] be seated for a few minutes. Glory.
[49:14] It feels good in the house of the Lord.
[49:16] It feels good in the house of the Lord.
[49:19] The Psalmist David said, "I was glad
[49:21] when they said unto me, let us go into
[49:24] the house of the Lord." Even if you're
[49:26] feeling sick, let us go. I was glad when
[49:28] they say, "Let us go." Because when I
[49:30] know when I get into the house of God's
[49:31] bread, there's food for me. There's food
[49:33] for my family. My cup can never run dry
[49:36] when I'm in the presence of the Lord.
[49:37] And we thank God for his grace, for his
[49:40] mercy. I greet you this morning in the
[49:43] precious name of Jesus Christ. And uh I
[49:46] mentioned to brother oid and I said to
[49:47] brother Anthony in the back it feels
[49:49] weird I've not been in the house here in
[49:52] about a month. The last time I was in
[49:54] church was when Miss Tabernacle was here
[49:56] 2 days after I flew out to Ghana. And uh
[50:01] so and then it was on to Ivory Coast and
[50:03] then uh last Sunday I was in the country
[50:06] but I am not
[50:09] old. I'm
[50:11] young, but I'm not as
[50:14] young as I used to be. So, last Sunday I
[50:18] was wiped out a bit under the weather,
[50:21] but uh I trust the Lord blessed you. And
[50:25] certainly to see that God is a God of
[50:29] the audience. He's a God of his people
[50:31] and he doesn't need any one person for
[50:33] things to go on. God has gifts
[50:35] everywhere. So, we really want to be
[50:37] grateful and I bring many, many
[50:39] greetings. I know brother oid extended
[50:41] some last week but I bring many
[50:43] greetings. I'll start in Ghana and for
[50:45] those of you who may not have known I
[50:48] was invited to Ghana to perform a
[50:50] funeral of I guess it would be the
[50:53] equivalent of our brother Moro. So this
[50:56] would have been the brother that would
[50:57] have been instrumental in the forming of
[51:00] brother Solomon Nina's church. uh in
[51:03] fact he would have been the one to
[51:04] testify uh I guess to brother Solomon
[51:07] and his family and brother Solomon if
[51:08] you don't know came out of a Muslim
[51:10] background and the message came to him
[51:13] and took a Muslim and not only made him
[51:15] a message believer but turned him into a
[51:17] preacher you know so the brother who
[51:19] would have been instrumental in the
[51:21] formation of that church he had I guess
[51:24] a a desire he said when my time comes I
[51:26] want brother Isaac to come to do the
[51:29] funeral so it was a very tall order or
[51:34] request and uh it is something that he
[51:36] had said for quite some time. I had
[51:38] remembered it but at the time when it
[51:40] was said a few years ago, you know,
[51:42] sometimes people say things and you
[51:44] never really, you know, take it as this
[51:46] is a literal thing until I got a
[51:49] message. Our brother Safo has gone on to
[51:51] be the Lord and they're expecting you to
[51:53] come and do the funeral, you know. So,
[51:55] by the grace of God, we we went there
[51:58] and had a wonderful time with the
[52:00] family, with the believers. Uh it was
[52:02] quite a funeral service. I think about
[52:05] 800 or so people were there. He was very
[52:07] respected. He was loved. And he lived a
[52:09] life that was such a testimony um of the
[52:12] grace of God. You know, he lived about
[52:13] two and a half hours from the church and
[52:16] would drive every Sunday to church, 2
[52:17] and 1/2 hours to church, 2 and 1/2 hours
[52:19] back home. Um, so sometimes you look at
[52:22] situations and you look at your own
[52:24] context and you know I I left there I
[52:27] was speaking at the funeral service and
[52:30] I sent a screenshot to our family chat
[52:33] because
[52:35] uh the temperature in Trinidad sometimes
[52:38] the highest might be a 32 sometimes I
[52:41] think might be a 34 at 1000 p.m. at
[52:44] night was like 34 there.
[52:47] So I said I would never again say
[52:50] Trinidad is a hot
[52:51] country. My whole and I I was preaching
[52:54] and I and I preached and I said the heat
[52:56] we have here I would never again say
[52:57] Trinad is a hot country because I felt a
[52:59] temperature there that I'd never felt
[53:02] before. And I said if this is the kind
[53:04] of temperature that is getting closer to
[53:06] the temperature down in hell then we
[53:08] want to see that temperature. But the
[53:10] reality is, you know, it just gives you
[53:13] a deeper appreciation of the grace of
[53:15] God to us and to everyone and the
[53:18] sacrifices that people make because
[53:20] they're searching for a truth and a
[53:22] reality, you know. So uh so I ministered
[53:25] on the Saturday uh for the funeral and
[53:27] then the burial and then the Sunday
[53:29] morning we had a service as well and by
[53:31] the grace of God the people were
[53:32] blessed. So greetings from mother
[53:34] Solomon Nachina and the church there in
[53:37] Tamali and Tetuman and we were over in
[53:40] Dongo and by the grace of God we look
[53:42] forward to having more meetings there in
[53:44] Ghana because I believe God has seeds
[53:46] and sons everywhere and the reality is
[53:49] we want to make ourselves available to
[53:50] God to use in the way that he wants to
[53:52] be he wants us to be used you know and
[53:54] and we realize that everything that we
[53:56] do only what we do for the kingdom is
[53:58] what will last only what we do for the
[54:00] kingdom is what will stand you know and
[54:02] and then we went over to Ivory Coast and
[54:04] well you have seen some of the services
[54:06] uh last Friday we had brother one of
[54:09] Boe's messages and then last Sunday um
[54:11] the closing message of the meeting when
[54:13] I preached about the mystery of Caleb
[54:15] between uh uh Abraham and David and what
[54:19] a time we had in Ivory Coast. tell you
[54:21] the the worship and the praising and the
[54:24] shouting and the I I always I'm blown
[54:26] away when you go to Ivory Coast because
[54:28] the fire you see in the first service is
[54:31] the fire you see down to the last
[54:33] service you know you walk into the first
[54:35] service and people are jumping on their
[54:37] feet shouting and there's no break in
[54:39] that rhythm in that momentum throughout
[54:41] the entire meeting and you see a people
[54:44] that's hungry and on fire for the Lord
[54:46] and and that's how we all want to be
[54:48] that we're not coming because it's a
[54:50] show or we coming because it's a it's a
[54:52] display or we putting on something but
[54:54] it's a true hunger and a desire to see a
[54:56] present tense reality of the living God
[54:59] you know and that's what we see there
[55:00] you know and it was such a blessing
[55:03] while over there to see how the Lord is
[55:05] working here on this side as well so I
[55:07] really want to join with what brother O
[55:09] did last week and salute the church and
[55:11] salute the ministers here uh brother
[55:14] Gideon brother Anthony brother Steven
[55:18] for an exceptional
[55:20] service to the Lord and for the church
[55:22] being here to support and and the brunch
[55:25] and everything that that went into it.
[55:27] May God richly bless you and as Breovit
[55:29] said is a sign of a maturing church and
[55:31] a mature church and we want to continue
[55:32] to press our way into the kingdom of God
[55:36] uh knowing that time is short and one of
[55:37] these days the last service will be so
[55:40] we'll have the last service the last
[55:41] song. So for the time that we have, for
[55:44] the grace that we have, because we see
[55:45] all the political turmoil, we see the
[55:47] economic turmoil, we see governmental
[55:49] policies changing, there's stuff
[55:51] happening, you know, in the US and
[55:53] there's stuff in Africa and their
[55:54] countries reclaiming this and you can't
[55:56] fly here. And I think the US just said a
[55:59] green card holder is just a guest, which
[56:01] is a different thinking on the way it
[56:03] was many years ago. and the the
[56:05] uncertainty from economic policy, from
[56:07] monetary policy, from political policy.
[56:10] All of this is supposed to happen and
[56:12] think it not strange when these things
[56:14] happen because that is what is supposed
[56:15] to happen. But that is not even our
[56:18] indicator. The indicator for what is to
[56:19] happen is what's happening here this
[56:21] morning. The indicator of what's to
[56:23] unfold is what's happening in the bride
[56:24] around the world. Because we are the
[56:26] ones that have the real influence. Can
[56:28] the church say amen? When the people of
[56:30] God come into a realization of their
[56:32] position in Christ and the power comes
[56:34] upon the church, then everything is
[56:35] going to go because God can't bring
[56:37] judgment unless there's warning. And
[56:39] there can't be a warning. Unless there's
[56:41] a people to warn that he wants to call
[56:42] out of this world into the reality of
[56:45] what he saw for you before you had a
[56:48] mortgage and before the doctor tell you
[56:49] what he told you and before you went
[56:51] through that trial and that testing that
[56:53] he who is greater in you than he that's
[56:55] in the world is going to take you
[56:57] through. He's going to take you through
[56:58] your trial. He's going to take you
[57:00] through your test. He's going to take
[57:02] you through every situation. And that
[57:04] physical pain you might be feeling is
[57:06] temporary. The gray hair is temporary.
[57:09] The arthritis is temporary. Your son
[57:12] struggling in the world temporary. Oh,
[57:14] come on now. You don't hear me this
[57:15] morning. The doctor's report is
[57:17] temporary.
[57:19] [Music]
[57:25] I was having a conversation with my wife
[57:27] because you know we just had a political
[57:28] change in this country and I said when
[57:30] you understand the way governments are
[57:32] structured the role of a permanent
[57:34] secretary in a ministry is to be there
[57:38] to manage the transition in governments
[57:40] because if you take away all the leaders
[57:42] of every ministry in one day you have no
[57:44] no country you know that's right nobody
[57:46] know what happened last week nobody know
[57:47] what happened 10 years ago nobody had no
[57:49] system so you can't just clear all these
[57:51] flee and move everybody because nobody
[57:52] know what going on. So there's a there's
[57:55] a role that exists within the civil
[57:57] service called a permanent secretary of
[57:59] somebody who is there. So even if the
[58:01] government change this year, the next 5
[58:02] years, the next five years, the role of
[58:04] the PS is to keep the ship going even
[58:06] when the minister changes.
[58:09] So the PS in the context of that
[58:11] infrastructure is the constant or the
[58:13] role of the constant that is there so
[58:16] that when the the the the the things
[58:18] shift there's something that's sure and
[58:20] we have a PS is an anchor
[58:23] so your situation change you're changing
[58:25] your job you're changing your life but
[58:26] there's an anchor that holds even when
[58:28] the storm blows even when things change
[58:30] there's an anchor that holds despite the
[58:33] storm there's something that's permanent
[58:35] in your life and it's that seed in your
[58:37] soul that the prophet taught us you are
[58:39] not even a believer but the word seed in
[58:41] you that's a believer that word is
[58:43] speaking for you when you can't even
[58:45] speak for yourself that word is
[58:47] believing for you when you don't believe
[58:49] in yourself you may not have prayed this
[58:51] morning but that seed is representing
[58:53] you this morning and the blood when you
[58:55] say hallelujah your voice goes through
[58:58] the blood and he sees you through the
[58:59] blood even though you made a mistake
[59:01] last week he sees you through the blood
[59:05] can the church say amen we give the Lord
[59:08] a hand Praise. I'm almost
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:14] done. So, just to encourage the church,
[59:17] we are in a new season. I can't even
[59:19] believe how quickly time is moving. But
[59:21] we are in the month of May. We just
[59:23] started this year. And before you know
[59:26] it, it's June. It's July convention.
[59:28] Before you know it, it's December.
[59:30] It's Christmas and a new year again.
[59:34] Time is running out. But one of these
[59:36] days we're going to break from time into
[59:38] eternity.
[59:39] I can't wait for that day. You know, I
[59:42] can't wait for the day when I could
[59:43] break from time. But if Brandham said
[59:45] now we are
[59:47] blending, there's a mixing taking place.
[59:49] So we are getting some touches of
[59:52] eternity even in this service this
[59:53] morning. And that touch of eternity is
[59:56] making them gray here. Think twice about
[59:58] being gray. Oh, you don't hear me this
[59:59] morning. Those touches of eternity is
[1:00:02] making your spine that under pressure
[1:00:04] say wait a minute there's something
[1:00:06] greater than what's happening here. Your
[1:00:08] theophony is whispering to you this
[1:00:10] morning because we are blending from
[1:00:13] time to
[1:00:16] eternity. Glory. So I want to salute the
[1:00:19] church and this morning over is
[1:00:21] preaching in the US. He preached Friday
[1:00:23] night. He's preaching this morning. So
[1:00:25] there's a lot of demands. There's a lot
[1:00:27] of of of moving behind the scenes.
[1:00:30] There's a rustle in the malberry tree.
[1:00:32] There's all over the world, the spirit
[1:00:33] is moving. No one church could say they
[1:00:36] have it. No one group could say they
[1:00:38] have it. It's one Lord. It's one faith.
[1:00:40] It's one baptism. It's one body. And by
[1:00:43] one spirit, we are baptized into that
[1:00:45] one body. And God is sovereign. He
[1:00:47] doesn't need permission to call you. He
[1:00:49] doesn't need permission to use you. He
[1:00:51] doesn't need permission to forgive you.
[1:00:52] He doesn't need permission to bless you.
[1:00:54] Not even the accuser. Because the devil
[1:00:56] is the accuser of the brethren and he is
[1:00:58] bringing accusations against you this
[1:01:00] morning. That's his job to do. But the
[1:01:02] sovereign God who is judge and lawyer,
[1:01:05] he could ignore the accusation of the
[1:01:08] wicked one and say that is my son.
[1:01:12] That is my daughter. And they are going
[1:01:14] to have the victory because I wrote
[1:01:16] their name in the book before they were
[1:01:18] even here. I wrote their name. God is
[1:01:20] not now choosing us. He has already
[1:01:22] chosen you.
[1:01:24] [Applause]
[1:01:27] Glory. So this morning we are getting
[1:01:30] ready to go back to Ivory Coast. Brother
[1:01:32] Solomon Nina preach a masterpiece and we
[1:01:35] are going to get into that message and
[1:01:37] we look forward to have him here for our
[1:01:39] convention uh later this year in July.
[1:01:41] So by the grace of God uh we are getting
[1:01:43] some appetizer to the convention here
[1:01:45] this morning. And just for an
[1:01:47] announcement, uh, Brother Steven with
[1:01:49] Anthony, this Wednesday ahead of us, we
[1:01:52] will not have a physical service here at
[1:01:54] the church. It'll just be a live stream.

[1:02:11] bless you. Brother Shane, we can go to

[1:03:34] There's no doubt.
[1:03:37] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:03:39] forever. He specializes
[1:03:43] in the
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:45] impossible. When we stop,

[1:04:06] word, we know he's a miracle working
[1:04:09] man. And we are gathered this
[1:04:12] weekend for him to prove his
[1:04:15] word. He will never fail. He has never
[1:04:19] failed. He will never fail.
[1:04:22] not about to

[1:04:59] One
[1:05:01] more commit ourselves this
[1:05:04] morning. Take us out of the way. May the
[1:05:07] mind of Christ drop down on the house of
[1:05:10] the people, on the house of the
[1:05:13] preachers and on the worshippers.
[1:05:16] together make a joyful noise unto thee.
[1:05:20] Lord, take every spirit under our
[1:05:23] control for the glory of God. May you
[1:05:27] break the shackles of the
[1:05:30] enemy. May the Holy Ghost
[1:05:33] be the same
[1:05:36] again of your
[1:05:39] word. Bless the hearing of it, your
[1:05:42] glory. Jesus Christ.
[1:05:46] Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. And the
[1:05:48] church say and the church
[1:05:52] say the Lord bless you.
[1:05:56] It's good to be in Ivory Coast one more
[1:05:59] time. When we come to Ivory
[1:06:02] Co. We feel at
[1:06:04] home because we are
[1:06:07] home together one more
[1:06:09] time because we were somewhere before.
[1:06:12] We're just passing through
[1:06:15] time and we are here to make a
[1:06:18] joyful to the Lord. So this morning on
[1:06:22] behalf of my wife
[1:06:24] and the church that is here, we want to
[1:06:28] take this
[1:06:29] opportunity to thank you
[1:06:31] all for inviting us and receiving
[1:06:36] us giving us the

[1:07:35] Brother Abraham said these are God's
[1:07:37] dress
[1:07:40] wearing
[1:07:41] men but you are looking at God called
[1:07:45] men in this hour that we live in.
[1:07:49] There are just a few of them that have
[1:07:52] overcome
[1:07:53] money overcome
[1:07:55] women overcome
[1:07:58] popularity obtained the word in all pure
[1:08:01] form in his pure form.
[1:08:05] So this weekend we're going to hear from
[1:08:08] heaven
[1:08:10] and I pray that the Lord will bless
[1:08:13] us my advice to
[1:08:16] you is open your heart.
[1:08:19] a word from the
[1:08:21] Lord that God is here to break the
[1:08:24] shackles of the
[1:08:25] enemy. God is here to deliver you. God
[1:08:30] is here to fill you. God is here to meet
[1:08:34] you at the point
[1:08:35] of you have to open
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:41] up. Amen. So let us together make a
[1:08:44] joyful noise unto the Lord.
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:49] God bless
[1:08:50] you. As we have our
[1:08:52] Bibles, shall we go straight to the
[1:08:54] word?
[1:08:56] We want to read from two portions of
[1:08:58] scripture.
[1:09:00] Joshua chapter
[1:09:02] 2 and Mark
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:05] 14. So, Joshua chapter 2,
[1:09:09] and I'm going to skip, you know, the
[1:09:12] story. Rahab and the spies that went
[1:09:14] down to Jericho was down
[1:09:17] by Al Jericho.
[1:09:19] And so Joshua
[1:09:22] 2:9, he said unto the men,
[1:09:26] I know that the Lord had given you the
[1:09:29] land, and that your terror is falling
[1:09:32] upon us, and that all the inhabitants of
[1:09:35] the land faint because of you. For we
[1:09:38] have heard how the Lord dried up the
[1:09:40] water of the Red Sea for you, when ye
[1:09:43] came out of Egypt, and what ye did unto
[1:09:46] the two kings of the Amorites that were
[1:09:48] on the other side of Jordan, Sheila and
[1:09:51] Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. And as
[1:09:54] soon as we had heard these things, our
[1:09:56] hearts did melt, neither did neither
[1:09:58] there remain more courage in any man
[1:10:02] because of you. For the Lord your God,
[1:10:05] he is God in heaven above and in the
[1:10:08] earth beneath. Therefore, now therefore,
[1:10:10] I pray thee, swear unto me by the Lord,
[1:10:14] since I have shown you kindness, that ye
[1:10:17] will also show kindness unto my father's
[1:10:20] house, and give me a true token. Amen.
[1:10:24] I'll skip down to verse 17. And the man
[1:10:26] said unto her, we will be blames of thy
[1:10:30] which thou hast made us swear. Behold,
[1:10:33] when we come into the land, thou shalt
[1:10:35] bind this lean, this line of scallet
[1:10:39] thread in the window which thou did let
[1:10:41] us down by, and thou shalt bring thy
[1:10:44] father, and thy mother, and thy
[1:10:45] brethren, and all thy father's household
[1:10:48] home unto thee. And it shall be what?
[1:10:50] That what? Whosoever shall go out of the
[1:10:53] doors of thy house into the street, his
[1:10:56] blood shall be upon his head, and we
[1:10:58] will be guiltless. But whomsoever be
[1:11:02] with thee in the house, his blood shall
[1:11:04] be on our head. If any hand be upon him,
[1:11:08] and if thou author this business, then
[1:11:12] we will be quit of thy oath which thou
[1:11:15] hast made us swear. And she said,
[1:11:18] accordingly to your words, so be it. She
[1:11:21] sent them away, and they departed. And
[1:11:24] she bound the scarlet lying in the
[1:11:26] window.
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:39] All right. So, Mark 14
[1:11:42] verse 39 verse 8. And again he went away
[1:11:46] and prayed and the same
[1:11:48] words. And when he returned, he found
[1:11:51] them asleep again, for their eyes were
[1:11:53] heavy, neither with they what to answer
[1:11:57] him. And he came, he cometh the third
[1:11:59] time, and said unto them, "Sleep on now,
[1:12:03] and take your rest. It is enough. The
[1:12:05] hour is come. Behold, the Son of Man is
[1:12:08] betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise
[1:12:11] up, let us go. Lo, he that betrayed me
[1:12:14] is at hand. He that betrayeth me is at
[1:12:17] hand." And immediately while he yet
[1:12:19] speak cometh Judas, one of the 12, and
[1:12:22] with him a great multitude with swords
[1:12:25] and staffs from the chief priests and
[1:12:27] the scribes and the elders. And he that
[1:12:30] betrayed him had given them a token,
[1:12:33] saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that
[1:12:36] same that is that same is he, take him,
[1:12:39] and lead him away safely. And as soon as
[1:12:42] he come, he was come, he goeth straight
[1:12:44] away to him and said, "Master, master,"
[1:12:47] and kissed him. And they laid their
[1:12:49] hands on him and took
[1:12:55] him. Father, we thank you for the
[1:12:57] reading of your
[1:12:59] word.
[1:13:01] Bless in Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:06] Amen. Amen. So, we are here this
[1:13:08] weekend.
[1:13:10] Amen. to meet the
[1:13:12] Lord and for a title this
[1:13:15] morning the hour of
[1:13:17] chargeonsibility. We are here in a
[1:13:20] battlefield.
[1:13:23] We are not here on a picnic.
[1:13:25] We are not here to see one
[1:13:29] another to push back the
[1:13:32] enemy. We are here. We are here to let
[1:13:36] the devil
[1:13:37] know
[1:13:39] sight
[1:13:43] subject a more sure word of prophecy.
[1:13:48] Now when God says
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:53] anything when he declares his
[1:13:55] word that word cannot return back.
[1:13:59] He sent a
[1:14:01] prophet. The prophet
[1:14:03] declared there shall be a
[1:14:05] bride. There shall be a bride. Now that
[1:14:09] word is a spirit that has been
[1:14:13] released into the world and is to find
[1:14:16] the
[1:14:18] people
[1:14:20] individuals who need the
[1:14:22] bride and the purpose of
[1:14:24] that is the ambassadors of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:29] of that
[1:14:30] bride indicate the
[1:14:32] word of that bride. Take this
[1:14:36] Bible living walking
[1:14:39] document. When the world want to see
[1:14:42] Jesus, you have to see the
[1:14:45] bride. The prophet
[1:14:47] declared here is the
[1:14:49] secret of the word which is
[1:14:52] eternal is in the bride. to the bride.
[1:14:57] Abraham said that you are the liberal
[1:14:59] way
[1:15:01] of therefore means
[1:15:04] that
[1:15:11] failure
[1:15:15] cannot bring on the rapture.
[1:15:18] bring on the
[1:15:22] resey
[1:15:24] manifestation of prophecy. We are here
[1:15:28] to declare declare
[1:15:34] war
[1:15:37] without
[1:15:39] tired tired of being defeated. We are
[1:15:43] tired of the sick being among us.
[1:15:48] of the captives being among us. The
[1:15:52] year
[1:15:56] today of
[1:15:58] Jubilee, the year of Jubilee against
[1:16:01] every
[1:16:02] principality by our
[1:16:05] freedom of
[1:16:07] freedom, our
[1:16:09] might power, but by
[1:16:11] authority, our
[1:16:13] position of
[1:16:15] God appear.
[1:16:21] When the Holy
[1:16:25] Ghost in you will be like
[1:16:29] him like
[1:16:31] him of
[1:16:33] prophecy going through your ups and
[1:16:37] down over your
[1:16:39] life promise over your life. Whosoever
[1:16:42] the son of man. Whosoever the son of man
[1:16:47] set

[1:16:53] morning. You are free this morning.
[1:16:57] Remember your jubilee
[1:16:59] came. Freedom declaration was
[1:17:03] made. You had a choice. Receive it. You
[1:17:07] had a choice. Rejected it. Received it.
[1:17:11] Receive your
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:15] freedom
[1:17:19] forever to your
[1:17:22] [Music]
[1:17:24] life. His

[1:17:32] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So we thank God
[1:17:35] this
[1:17:37] morning. You may be seated. The hour has
[1:17:40] come. We live in a time perilous times
[1:17:45] are here. Perilous times are
[1:17:48] here. Men are lovers of
[1:17:51] themselves more than lovers
[1:17:54] of in you. The word
[1:17:58] se from
[1:18:01] God back to
[1:18:03] God. Nothing but the
[1:18:08] word on the
[1:18:10] wording on
[1:18:14] theology. I
[1:18:16] am
[1:18:21] relying on sending me to God. Great
[1:18:27] economy man. God called man.
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:34] God called
[1:18:36] man called
[1:18:39] man. So today we are blessed because in
[1:18:44] the days of
[1:18:45] Noah he was a preacher of
[1:18:49] righteousness. In the days of
[1:18:51] Paul, the defender of the
[1:18:54] faith. But
[1:18:56] today, God called
[1:18:59] men of
[1:19:03] righteousness of the
[1:19:06] faith bringing the righteousness of
[1:19:09] God. And we
[1:19:11] are the word
[1:19:16] cannot preach of righteousness.
[1:19:20] defenders of the
[1:19:21] faith. And so here we are. What is the
[1:19:25] purpose? To bring the bride
[1:19:29] to perfection,
[1:19:31] the bride to fullness,
[1:19:34] the image of
[1:19:36] Christ as he is. You will
[1:19:40] be therefore
[1:19:42] perfect. Our father in heaven is
[1:19:44] perfect.
[1:19:45] your
[1:19:47] perfection something to make you
[1:19:51] perfect to make you
[1:19:54] perfect
[1:19:55] it. Jesus wanted that
[1:19:58] perfection. When you receive that
[1:20:01] perfection, when this life is
[1:20:04] [Music]
[1:20:06] over, we are interested in that
[1:20:10] life
[1:20:12] perfect. It takes the person foresus
[1:20:16] [Music]

[1:21:05] devil to release
[1:21:07] you of
[1:21:10] sin, your cross.

[1:21:16] scripture, it was
[1:21:19] destroyed not from the
[1:21:21] outside from the
[1:21:25] inside outside
[1:21:28] world. It had to
[1:21:30] happen. We stand here
[1:21:37] today. Sin can be attached to your life.
[1:21:42] I tell you this
[1:21:43] morning, you have no relationship with
[1:21:46] sin. You are the
[1:21:51] [Music]

[1:22:40] fullness of the
[1:22:43] atonement blood has been
[1:22:45] shed. The brother the blood came
[1:22:48] back the holy spirit
[1:22:51] without blood. You can't find the
[1:22:54] literal chemistry of the
[1:22:57] blood
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:23:00] today pure
[1:23:02] word back. restoring the heart of
[1:23:06] man that when you

[1:23:14] out will have to give
[1:23:18] way that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[1:23:21] Who is he that cometh in the name of the

[1:23:29] Christ today?
[1:23:35] Therefore, you have

[1:24:00] name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. So
[1:24:04] this morning we have not been
[1:24:08] called life. We have not been called to
[1:24:11] a defeated
[1:24:13] life. We have been called to the
[1:24:17] manifestation of the
[1:24:20] manifest. The only way to be
[1:24:24] manifested as the son of God to have him
[1:24:28] is to have
[1:24:30] him. The Holy Ghost itself,
[1:24:34] but the enemy keeps us
[1:24:38] [Music]
[1:24:39] doubting. The enemy keeps us doubting.
[1:24:44] It keeps us
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:47] believing that the word of
[1:24:50] God for
[1:24:53] us come to the living
[1:24:56] reality so that
[1:24:59] everything that he
[1:25:01] said concerning
[1:25:03] me. This is the
[1:25:06] hour. I am not leaving this
[1:25:09] convention. an experience
[1:25:13] is going to
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:16] shout. The devil is afraid
[1:25:20] of afraid of the
[1:25:22] shouting. What scares the
[1:25:25] devil
[1:25:27] life deal with the Holy
[1:25:29] Spirit? We need the Holy
[1:25:34] Ghost, our shouting and our presence has
[1:25:39] been accepted accepted of
[1:25:43] authority.
[1:25:45] This I want to shout
[1:25:48] different. I want to
[1:25:52] experience the Holy
[1:25:54] Spirit because the Holy Ghost is your
[1:25:57] promise.
[1:25:59] Jesus before he left
[1:26:01] them, he told them, "I sent the promise
[1:26:04] of the father before
[1:26:07] you and you need to
[1:26:12] carry till you are
[1:26:15] enduring." He said, "L
[1:26:20] and continually praising
[1:26:22] him even before the Holy
[1:26:25] Ghost in the right
[1:26:27] place in the right
[1:26:29] atmosphere. You might not have received
[1:26:31] the Holy
[1:26:33] Ghost in the
[1:26:35] temple, him, worshiping him, waiting for
[1:26:39] the
[1:26:41] promise of the father. But the Bible
[1:26:44] said while they were gathered, all of a
[1:26:47] sudden there came a
[1:26:49] sound. They came a sound from
[1:26:54] heaven and rushing mighty wind.
[1:26:58] That
[1:26:59] sounded an ordinary
[1:27:02] sound. The moving of the Holy
[1:27:04] Ghost, the person of Jesus
[1:27:08] Christ into their heart settling on
[1:27:11] them, giving them
[1:27:13] power. The son of
[1:27:15] God when he
[1:27:17] came
[1:27:19] abroad the Holy Ghost in your
[1:27:22] life
[1:27:24] witness a
[1:27:26] witness to
[1:27:28] receive this
[1:27:30] weekend to connect back to that upper
[1:27:33] room
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:35] experience. This be just another
[1:27:39] convention that
[1:27:41] experience the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:45] into your soul.
[1:27:48] [Applause]
[1:27:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we are
[1:27:53] preparing for
[1:27:55] war. You may be seated and that
[1:27:59] war will bring us to a
[1:28:01] place. You know who we
[1:28:04] are who the devil
[1:28:06] is. When you know who you are, you will
[1:28:10] not be in the devil's camp.
[1:28:13] You will not be in the devil's
[1:28:15] camp. You will not be like the prodigal
[1:28:17] son. You will not be like the prodigal
[1:28:21] son. But you will stay with your
[1:28:26] inheritance. You have to pick up your
[1:28:30] enemy. But when you are going to
[1:28:33] war, know what you are fighting for.
[1:28:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:40] Hallelujah. Nations go to war. Nations
[1:28:43] go to war.
[1:28:45] And there's a reason why they go to war.
[1:28:49] And the reason is justified.
[1:28:53] Even the international communities
[1:28:55] recognize
[1:28:58] it. Heaven
[1:29:01] recognizes a war that started in
[1:29:05] heaven. That war was not finished.
[1:29:09] the conclusion of the
[1:29:12] war on the earth.
[1:29:15] And there's a people on both sides on
[1:29:19] the side of God and on the side of the
[1:29:23] devil are continuing this
[1:29:27] war against right and wrong against
[1:29:30] right and wrong.
[1:29:34] against the mark of
[1:29:36] Christ and the mark of the
[1:29:38] beast. And this war against true men of
[1:29:44] God, false
[1:29:47] men. This war is
[1:29:52] about the sons of the
[1:29:55] enemy and we are on God's
[1:29:58] side. This war to a conclusion.
[1:30:02] Tell the
[1:30:03] devil there are young people that will
[1:30:07] receive the Holy
[1:30:10] Ghost in the Bible.
[1:30:13] And the young
[1:30:14] people overcame
[1:30:17] by the blood of the lamb.
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:21] power of
[1:30:22] God names are Shadrach,
[1:30:30] Machameain false teaching in their day.
[1:30:34] If they
[1:30:35] overcame the false teaching in their
[1:30:38] day and
[1:30:40] overcome
[1:30:42] today, they
[1:30:44] were by faith. Shadrach, Shadrach, by
[1:30:48] faith,
[1:30:50] by faith,
[1:30:53] and by faith, the young
[1:30:57] people overcome every principality,
[1:31:02] every false
[1:31:05] Christ, every false
[1:31:10] interpretation is fighting that war.
[1:31:13] [Applause]
[1:31:15] The word in you was fighting that war.
[1:31:19] We must speak our enemy
[1:31:22] today. Maybe your
[1:31:24] enemy principalities and
[1:31:26] powers. Maybe your enemy
[1:31:29] drug
[1:31:31] abusion. Maybe your enemy is
[1:31:34] fornication. Maybe your enemy is
[1:31:37] adultery. Maybe your enemy prayerless
[1:31:40] life.
[1:31:42] But today I have good news for
[1:31:46] you might be by power is on the finished
[1:31:51] work on the finished work of Calvary.
[1:31:56] Jesus took all
[1:31:58] that
[1:32:00] himself on the
[1:32:03] crossify crucified all those demons.
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:12] Finish your names. Your names put in the
[1:32:17] book of
[1:32:19] life standing
[1:32:21] today. Michael is standing
[1:32:24] today. Every day that is not written in
[1:32:28] that
[1:32:29] book. The enemy that is battling you
[1:32:32] today, you have been given
[1:32:35] power to overcome him. You have been
[1:32:38] given power
[1:32:40] trample upon him.
[1:32:44] Walk on him. Walk on him.
[1:32:47] So that
[1:32:49] sickness tells you that the doctor
[1:32:53] says it is
[1:32:55] terinal will never be
[1:32:57] healed. Only manage it. Your Bible
[1:33:02] says that
[1:33:04] word of
[1:33:06] prophecy says by my
[1:33:10] stripes you are
[1:33:13] he whose
[1:33:17] report will you
[1:33:21] believe the report of the
[1:33:24] word believe the report of the
[1:33:28] word
[1:33:29] power by the Red
[1:33:34] Sea. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will
[1:33:37] believe the
[1:33:39] report of the
[1:33:41] word when the mind was blind.
[1:33:46] Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] Pray live many in the
[1:33:51] word.
[1:33:53] Rahab messed up. One word stood for her.
[1:33:59] Stood for her
[1:34:02] house. The harlot and all of her
[1:34:05] household were
[1:34:07] saved believe in that
[1:34:09] report and the doctors
[1:34:14] report. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. You
[1:34:17] may be
[1:34:17] seated. Pick your enemy
[1:34:21] today. Pick your
[1:34:23] enemy. You must make preparation.
[1:34:26] for that war.
[1:34:28] Amen. Amen. If you are making
[1:34:31] preparation, you must have the right
[1:34:36] ammunition to face that
[1:34:39] enemy. You must know your enemy's
[1:34:44] weight. You must know your enemy's
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:48] ability. You must know who your enemy
[1:34:52] is. Know the strategy.
[1:34:55] defeat that
[1:34:57] enemy must know his
[1:35:00] tricks to have a counter
[1:35:04] strategy to defeat that enemy.
[1:35:08] And the prophet
[1:35:10] by the Holy
[1:35:11] Spirit told us the tricks of the
[1:35:16] enemy that we must recognize
[1:35:19] him every one of his
[1:35:23] tricks. So today we are
[1:35:27] declaring that we are not
[1:35:29] divided. We are not
[1:35:32] divided. That's one of the tricks of the
[1:35:34] enemy. Because none of the
[1:35:38] divided
[1:35:40] united the Holy Ghost cannot move among
[1:35:45] you in one
[1:35:47] mind in one accord to receive the
[1:35:51] promise. They were
[1:35:53] united after the promise. We've got to
[1:35:56] be united
[1:35:58] because there is one
[1:35:59] body is one
[1:36:01] spirit. We are all
[1:36:03] baptized in one spirit into that one
[1:36:07] body. The trick of the enemy divide us
[1:36:12] to bring divisions among
[1:36:13] us. No more. No more. We
[1:36:18] recognize recognize the enemy every one
[1:36:23] of his
[1:36:24] streets. He cannot divide
[1:36:26] us. He cannot divide us. Our homes, he
[1:36:30] can't divide
[1:36:31] us. Our church, he cannot divide
[1:36:35] us. He cannot divide
[1:36:37] us here on the church.
[1:36:47] Hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:36:49] Jesus when the hour came
[1:36:52] for him to prove his
[1:36:55] word there was prophecy. You may see
[1:36:58] that there is
[1:37:00] prophecy over the
[1:37:02] word over the word that Jesus will have
[1:37:06] to come and take your
[1:37:09] sin upon himself and make a way to be
[1:37:15] restored. Even Jesus the word. Even
[1:37:20] Jesus almighty God could have just
[1:37:23] spoken the word.
[1:37:26] No, but it had to take blood.
[1:37:29] It had to take blood.
[1:37:31] So that blood must be shed.
[1:37:34] Jesus had to come
[1:37:37] down in a
[1:37:39] battle to
[1:37:41] charge against all those
[1:37:44] principalities against sin to to charge
[1:37:48] against
[1:37:49] sin in order to break the
[1:37:53] barrier between you and the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost. The reason why the Holy Ghost
[1:37:59] couldn't
[1:38:03] come. So the only way God could release
[1:38:05] the Holy
[1:38:12] Ghost, sin
[1:38:14] barrier. He died on the
[1:38:17] cross. Sin barrier was broken.
[1:38:21] You could now receive the
[1:38:23] Holy
[1:38:25] Jesus had to go to the cross and when he
[1:38:29] went to the cross as a
[1:38:32] manifestation cross had taken away
[1:38:36] sin. So the Holy Ghost
[1:38:42] came defeated.
[1:38:45] It was
[1:38:46] declared. Peter said, "Promise of the
[1:38:49] Holy
[1:38:50] Ghost unto you and to your children and
[1:38:55] to your children's children,
[1:38:57] to them that are
[1:38:58] power, even as many as the Lord our God
[1:39:01] shall
[1:39:03] come." So God from then on, from then
[1:39:08] on, God from then on,
[1:39:12] from that time on God made it a
[1:39:15] requirement.
[1:39:17] that you must receive the Holy
[1:39:19] Ghost. Jesus told them, "You must be
[1:39:26] born. Coming to church is not
[1:39:29] enough. The message is not
[1:39:32] enough. The message is not
[1:39:34] enough. Need the Holy
[1:39:37] Ghost. Mary needed the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:42] If there was anyone
[1:39:44] with an excuse
[1:39:47] not to press for the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:50] it was Mary. But in the upper room, Mary
[1:39:55] was
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:58] there for the Holy Ghost. for you and I
[1:40:03] today the same requirement for
[1:40:07] us in the
[1:40:09] message is not
[1:40:12] enough in the
[1:40:16] message has not yet accepted your
[1:40:21] faith
[1:40:23] come to be among
[1:40:25] us be in each and every one of
[1:40:29] you Abraham
[1:40:31] comes the
[1:40:33] token is the Holy Ghost. The
[1:40:37] token means that the fair has been paid.
[1:40:41] The token means that your faith has been
[1:40:46] accepted. So we need to be
[1:40:49] accepted. We are believers of the word
[1:40:53] today. We need to be
[1:40:56] accepted. Token is there. You must have
[1:40:59] the token.
[1:41:01] the manifest
[1:41:04] token
[1:41:09] power. You hear me? You get
[1:41:12] the
[1:41:19] power without
[1:41:25] ghost. The real Holy
[1:41:28] Ghost
[1:41:35] came is your
[1:41:36] promise. You don't have anything to do.
[1:41:41] No work of
[1:41:42] grace. There is no work in your own
[1:41:46] ability. Do Jesus paid the
[1:41:51] price. All that you have to
[1:41:54] do. Come onto him. Come on to him.
[1:41:58] Receive
[1:42:01] your receive
[1:42:04] your work.
[1:42:08] Nothing to
[1:42:09] do. Accept it. Accept
[1:42:17] it. Jesus broke the
[1:42:22] barrier.
[1:42:31] Every receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:34] Every prophet have to receive the
[1:42:37] Holy Baptist to receive the
[1:42:41] Holy Came knowing that this eternal
[1:42:45] life took something more than going to
[1:42:48] church. He said, "What can I do about
[1:42:52] this eternal
[1:42:53] life?" Jesus told him, "You must be born
[1:42:57] again." It goes for the pope. It goes
[1:43:00] for the pope.
[1:43:02] The pope needs the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:06] The pope needs the Holy Ghost. Without
[1:43:08] the Holy Ghost cannot come in the
[1:43:11] presence
[1:43:13] of the
[1:43:15] hour, the need of the
[1:43:18] hour. Charge of this
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:22] hour. Charge of this hour. Not against
[1:43:25] the
[1:43:26] next charge of the hour. A reality.
[1:43:32] The reality that will come upon each of
[1:43:35] us, it will come at each of
[1:43:39] us. And when the Holy Ghost
[1:43:42] fell, the team of the
[1:43:44] apostles, the team of every
[1:43:48] apostle was that have you
[1:43:54] received came into the
[1:43:57] message? Have you received the Holy
[1:43:59] Ghost?
[1:44:00] You were born
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:16] again. When I see the
[1:44:20] blood, when I see the
[1:44:22] blood, when your
[1:44:27] blood pass over you,
[1:44:30] Holy
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:32] Ghost need an
[1:44:37] experienceal. The Holy
[1:44:39] Ghost power
[1:44:44] you empower
[1:44:50] you. The body of
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:54] Christ take you to the rapture. of the
[1:44:57] Holy Ghost.
[1:44:59] The token, the token, identification,
[1:45:04] our worship is in vain.
[1:45:08] Is in vain.
[1:45:10] Our preaching is in
[1:45:11] vain. Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost. Pastor need the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:17] Need the Holy
[1:45:18] Ghost. Need the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:21] Need the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:24] Need the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:31] Why is the Holy
[1:45:37] Ghost of
[1:45:41] Christ follow the charge? I am calling
[1:45:44] you to the charge of the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:47] Holy Ghost
[1:45:52] in a time. If there was ever a
[1:45:56] time to check up, if there was ever the
[1:46:00] church examined
[1:46:05] itself, the Holy Ghost in your
[1:46:09] soul, in your
[1:46:11] life, is leading
[1:46:15] you spirit of truth when it comes to
[1:46:20] show you all things.
[1:46:22] You need the Holy Ghost
[1:46:28] today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:30] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[1:46:33] Amen. Amen. Abraham in a deceived
[1:46:38] church by the
[1:46:40] world. He said, "For God can keep
[1:46:45] anyone, can keep anyone and use
[1:46:49] anyone, life will follow after him.
[1:46:54] For it is God's
[1:46:55] business. But when we tend to aside away
[1:46:58] from the things of
[1:47:00] God, God cannot use us any longer.
[1:47:04] When we will walk
[1:47:06] steadfastly over the commandments of
[1:47:09] God, when we will stay in the pages of
[1:47:12] the
[1:47:13] Bible, worship by the written
[1:47:17] word, worship God in
[1:47:20] spirit and in truth of the
[1:47:23] word. God can use any
[1:47:27] individual. The sick needs to be
[1:47:30] healed. God needs individual
[1:47:35] He can
[1:47:36] use without the Holy
[1:47:39] Spirit can't use
[1:47:44] you. Nature is
[1:47:46] growing. Creation is groaning. Creation
[1:47:50] is groaning for the
[1:47:53] manifestation of
[1:47:57] you. We need to come to our place.
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] position
[1:48:05] because God wants men that he can
[1:48:09] use that he can
[1:48:12] use children that he can
[1:48:15] use can worship
[1:48:17] him spirit
[1:48:21] and can use
[1:48:23] any but when they take a notion to turn
[1:48:27] aside to something
[1:48:30] else God cannot use that person any
[1:48:32] longer.
[1:48:36] When Saul was a
[1:48:39] Pharisee, his name was in the
[1:48:42] book, God had to use him.
[1:48:45] Saul had an experience.
[1:48:48] Before God could use
[1:48:49] him when he got that
[1:48:52] experience was the experience.
[1:48:55] It was not a fellowship
[1:48:57] card, but it was an experience.
[1:49:01] the Holy Ghost and
[1:49:03] fire came
[1:49:06] into the name change.
[1:49:09] He was no longer Saul,
[1:49:12] but he was Apostle
[1:49:16] Paul. The Holy Ghost made a change out
[1:49:20] of
[1:49:20] him. The Holy Ghost make a change out of
[1:49:25] us.
[1:49:28] When we gather
[1:49:30] When
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:33] we
[1:49:35] manifestation, we will bring in the
[1:49:38] sick and the sick will not remain
[1:49:42] sick. What is it? We come manufacture
[1:49:47] it to take the Holy
[1:49:50] Spirit. I want you and
[1:49:53] I come to the
[1:49:56] reality of our life today.
[1:50:00] that I need the Holy
[1:50:01] Ghost. That should be your
[1:50:04] confession. I need the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:08] I need a personal
[1:50:13] experience. Abraham,
[1:50:17] something a great a great deal like the
[1:50:20] church.
[1:50:22] Something a great deal like the church
[1:50:25] started off right.
[1:50:27] He started off in the right
[1:50:30] direction like many of us when we came
[1:50:33] into the message. He started off in the
[1:50:35] right
[1:50:37] direction like Samson.
[1:50:40] He started off and was called a mighty
[1:50:42] man of
[1:50:44] valor. He started out serving the Lord
[1:50:46] and keeping his
[1:50:51] words his
[1:50:53] commandments and like the church
[1:50:57] It started off
[1:50:59] on as we would say of the word
[1:51:03] expression on the right
[1:51:06] foot started to keep the command of the
[1:51:10] Lord. As long as something followed the
[1:51:14] Lord, the Lord used
[1:51:20] something. As long as you and I,
[1:51:24] we follow the Lord
[1:51:26] by receiving the Holy
[1:51:28] Ghost, God can use
[1:51:31] us. Amen. Amen. The prophet said
[1:51:34] remember
[1:51:36] we are not on a picnic
[1:51:39] but we are in a battlefield.
[1:51:43] So the Holy Ghost
[1:51:46] picnic is not just one revival to the
[1:51:49] other but we are on a battlefield.
[1:51:54] When Jacob was faced with facing
[1:51:59] Esau
[1:52:01] knew that his tricks had come to an end.
[1:52:08] His wishy worship church membership had
[1:52:10] come to an end.
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:15] waiting for
[1:52:19] Jacob. Esau was ready to take revenge.
[1:52:25] Jacob
[1:52:26] knew he needed something
[1:52:29] greater. So, Jacob went into
[1:52:33] desperation. He had a need of the
[1:52:37] hour in Jacob's life.
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:42] He got a hold of the angel.
[1:52:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But remember
[1:52:48] Bible said when Jacob was was going on
[1:52:51] his
[1:52:53] journey, the same place that he met the
[1:52:57] angel. Jacob slept
[1:53:00] there and didn't feel
[1:53:02] anything. On his
[1:53:05] return back to meet
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:08] Esau battle with
[1:53:12] that same
[1:53:13] place had a reality check of his
[1:53:18] life. Something
[1:53:21] greater than just being
[1:53:24] Jacob. The Bible said then he saw angels
[1:53:28] going up and down the ladder.
[1:53:31] got a hold of one of
[1:53:38] them. Tell them how he was a
[1:53:43] son. Nobody had to tell
[1:53:45] them if you don't bless
[1:53:48] me to
[1:53:50] go this
[1:53:55] blessing this
[1:54:00] blessing my
[1:54:02] family this
[1:54:06] blessing you've got to bless
[1:54:08] me bless me to bless
[1:54:11] me will not
[1:54:15] The prophet
[1:54:21] said he said until I receive the Holy
[1:54:28] Ghost my rotten bones
[1:54:31] [Music]
[1:54:33] here, the Holy
[1:54:35] Ghost
[1:54:37] reality we must
[1:54:40] face because time
[1:54:43] is no longer.
[1:54:45] Death is knocking on our
[1:54:49] doors. Believers every
[1:54:53] day, burying believers every
[1:54:57] day. The scripture which is a motion of
[1:55:01] prophecy must be
[1:55:03] fulfilled. Ecclesiastes tells us
[1:55:06] that there's a day to be
[1:55:09] born and there's a day to
[1:55:12] die. So you and I are faced with that
[1:55:18] word that comes
[1:55:22] now. We are going to meet him. We are
[1:55:25] going to come to that
[1:55:27] place that door of
[1:55:30] death. Open up. Swallow us in.
[1:55:35] But the only
[1:55:36] way you can overcome that door
[1:55:40] of the Holy
[1:55:43] Spirit, the only way you have the Holy
[1:55:47] Spirit will shut that door of
[1:55:51] death. This one doesn't
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:55:58] belong from another life. You must get
[1:56:02] the Holy Spirit.
[1:56:04] In order to face the well council of
[1:56:08] churches, we must get the Holy
[1:56:12] Ghost anointed that are in the
[1:56:16] land. Without the Holy
[1:56:19] Spirit, without the Holy Spirit, we are
[1:56:22] under an
[1:56:24] anointing to pull you away from the
[1:56:27] faith. You need the Holy Ghost in your
[1:56:31] life, the right
[1:56:34] word. Let us not be like something
[1:56:38] today. We are not on a
[1:56:42] picnic. We are in a
[1:56:45] battlefield. Many people think that when
[1:56:47] they become a
[1:56:49] Christian, that's all they need to
[1:56:52] do that settles it forever.
[1:56:55] as they are a Christian and everything
[1:56:57] is going on
[1:57:00] easy never get that in your
[1:57:04] head ever think that I'm in the
[1:57:07] message end it for I become a
[1:57:12] Christian to
[1:57:14] fight the good fight of
[1:57:18] faith I become a
[1:57:21] Christian get in battle lines
[1:57:25] You get it now? To become
[1:57:28] believers to get in battle
[1:57:32] lines because this war I didn't start
[1:57:38] it. You must finish this
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:51] war into our soul.
[1:57:54] Then we become
[1:57:56] overcomer. You may be seated. We are
[1:57:59] Christian soldiers.
[1:58:02] We have got to be
[1:58:04] trained and brought
[1:58:07] up and know all the techniques of the
[1:58:10] enemy. Know how to
[1:58:13] fortify to fight the
[1:58:16] fight. We do
[1:58:18] that. Holy
[1:58:20] Spirit to us.
[1:58:23] We cannot take what some other nation
[1:58:25] tells us when they go to war.
[1:58:28] We cannot take what other nation tells
[1:58:33] us. Some of their
[1:58:37] ideas take our own
[1:58:40] ideas where the Holy
[1:58:43] Spirit us and what ideas he would give
[1:58:48] us. He is the commanding chief of the
[1:58:50] army of the Christians.
[1:58:54] And the only way we can get that
[1:58:57] commanding
[1:59:02] officers commanding
[1:59:04] officers is to be connected with
[1:59:07] him by the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:10] Ghost. on the channel of communication
[1:59:13] of
[1:59:14] God through the Holy
[1:59:17] Spirit by the Holy
[1:59:19] Ghost cannot ever communicate with
[1:59:23] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:27] Notice three
[1:59:29] stages justification by
[1:59:34] faithification baptism of
[1:59:36] the
[1:59:38] perfection. We we want to come to
[1:59:40] perfection.
[1:59:42] It is the requirement of our day.
[1:59:45] Not just the gift of the Holy
[1:59:47] Spirit faith all the way to charity.
[1:59:51] When perfect
[1:59:52] love capstone itself,
[1:59:56] person of Christ sit in the throne of
[1:59:59] your
[2:00:00] heart. Said I did not come to build an
[2:00:03] organization.
[2:00:07] come to build individuals to the to
[2:00:11] power
[2:00:13] houses supposed to be a
[2:00:17] powerhouse. You cannot be a
[2:00:22] powerhouse. So we must come to that
[2:00:25] glorified state of the Holy
[2:00:29] Ghost
[2:00:32] possible. You may be seated. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:36] So the prophet said position of a
[2:00:38] believer in
[2:00:40] Christ said God chose
[2:00:43] you in Christ before the foundation
[2:00:47] of said that is what the scripture said
[2:00:51] that we should be
[2:00:52] holy without blame before him in
[2:00:56] love in what in
[2:00:59] love we should be holy without blame
[2:01:02] before him in
[2:01:04] without plain
[2:01:06] without blemish,
[2:01:08] not one spot on the church at
[2:01:12] all. How are we going to get that
[2:01:15] way? We can't do
[2:01:17] it. Human we are subject to all kinds of
[2:01:22] mistakes now that we are coming to the
[2:01:25] perfection of
[2:01:27] it. Amen. Amen. So he reads Hebrews
[2:01:30] chapter 9.
[2:01:32] And said, "For the law having a shadow
[2:01:34] of good things to come,
[2:01:37] the law having a good
[2:01:40] shadow to
[2:01:42] come the very image of the
[2:01:45] things never make those with sacrifices
[2:01:48] that is offered year by year
[2:01:53] continually the come onto perfection."
[2:01:57] So what is he talking about? Is not our
[2:02:00] ability. Not a capacity. I can shout. I
[2:02:03] can.
[2:02:05] No. But accepting that sacrifice,
[2:02:10] let that sacrifice be a reality to
[2:02:13] you. Give you overcoming
[2:02:17] power be reality to
[2:02:21] you. Power in your
[2:02:24] life. And now man ever become perfected.
[2:02:29] And yet God in his
[2:02:31] word that he chose us to be
[2:02:35] holy perfected before the foundations of
[2:02:38] the
[2:02:39] world. How are you going to do
[2:02:42] that? Be therefore
[2:02:44] perfect. Jesus said, "Be therefore
[2:02:48] perfect as your heavenly father in
[2:02:51] heaven. If God before the world ordain
[2:02:56] that we should be holy,
[2:02:58] without blame and perfect in his
[2:03:02] sight. They are struggling and
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:07] memoring that God has seen all these
[2:03:11] things. He forneew it and
[2:03:16] predestinated us to be
[2:03:19] so elected us before the world was ever
[2:03:22] formed. But Christ become a high priest
[2:03:26] of good things to come.
[2:03:35] Greater and a more perfect
[2:03:38] tabernacle not made with
[2:03:42] hands to say not made of clothing.
[2:03:46] by his own
[2:03:49] blood. He entered in once in the holy
[2:03:53] place and having ordained as to
[2:03:56] redemption for
[2:03:58] us. So by one
[2:04:00] spirit are all
[2:04:03] baptized into one
[2:04:05] body and become members of this
[2:04:08] body. Romans 8:1 there is for now no
[2:04:14] condemnation when the Holy Ghost
[2:04:17] come then you can
[2:04:19] declare therefore now no
[2:04:23] condemnation are in Christ
[2:04:27] Jesus that have received
[2:04:30] the token has been
[2:04:35] displayed has been accepted
[2:04:40] accept no condemnation to them that are
[2:04:42] in Christ
[2:04:43] Jesus that walk not after the
[2:04:49] flesh and a man that is in
[2:04:53] Christ in Christ
[2:04:55] Jesus walks after spiritual things.
[2:05:00] When you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:06] to the world is caral
[2:05:09] mind
[2:05:12] foolishness believe it is ever
[2:05:16] life there you
[2:05:18] are what can harm
[2:05:21] you when you are in
[2:05:24] Christ receive
[2:05:26] the can
[2:05:28] you are in
[2:05:30] Christ and just assure that God raised
[2:05:33] Jesus from the
[2:05:35] dead they will come in
[2:05:39] Christ. We have got to come.
[2:05:42] God has done
[2:05:44] promising for just as show that the body
[2:05:46] goes
[2:05:48] up in that
[2:05:51] body just as Christ rose from the
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:56] dead in that
[2:05:58] body. And when the trumpet
[2:06:04] sound this motor
[2:06:07] must put on
[2:06:09] immortality must go up with him.
[2:06:13] But the only way I can claim
[2:06:16] that the Holy
[2:06:19] Spirit is by the Holy
[2:06:21] Spirit is by the Holy Ghost
[2:06:24] from the
[2:06:26] token said a
[2:06:28] blood
[2:06:30] identify the believer because the life
[2:06:33] had gone
[2:06:34] out and could not come back. It it has
[2:06:38] to have a chemistry.
[2:06:40] had to have like a paint a
[2:06:44] blood show that life from
[2:06:47] it. Now the very itself
[2:06:53] is the
[2:06:55] token closing
[2:06:58] out. Let us pay attention this
[2:07:00] morning. The very spirit itself
[2:07:05] is the token.
[2:07:08] The Holy Spirit itself
[2:07:11] is the token.
[2:07:13] Not the blood. The blood was shed at
[2:07:16] Calvary.
[2:07:18] That is true. But the blood as far as it
[2:07:23] is went back to the elements of which it
[2:07:26] came
[2:07:28] from from the food that he lived on
[2:07:32] earth. And you see inside that blood
[2:07:36] cell
[2:07:38] there was a
[2:07:41] life started the blood cell to move
[2:07:44] in the chemical life in
[2:07:49] it no life in it
[2:07:53] itself
[2:07:54] move when the life come into the
[2:07:56] chemistry of the
[2:07:59] blood formed a cell form
[2:08:03] of his own
[2:08:05] cell from cell after
[2:08:08] cell becomes a
[2:08:10] man. That man was God,
[2:08:14] a manual in
[2:08:17] flesh. When that life returned
[2:08:19] back, chemistry went with
[2:08:22] it.
[2:08:24] Broken is the Holy
[2:08:26] Ghost upon the
[2:08:29] church that they see Christ.
[2:08:33] The talking is the Holy Ghost upon the
[2:08:38] church that your brother sees Christ in
[2:08:42] you. Your brother sees Christ in
[2:08:45] you. It is not I will
[2:08:49] try. You must receive the
[2:08:53] token. You must have the
[2:08:56] token. Have a battle ready for the
[2:08:59] token.
[2:09:01] Everything that keeps you away from the
[2:09:03] token
[2:09:05] is your enemy,
[2:09:08] you must declare war on that.
[2:09:13] The way you want eternal
[2:09:15] life, when you want eternal
[2:09:19] life, receive a
[2:09:22] token. When you want eternal
[2:09:25] life, receive a
[2:09:27] token showing that the price has been
[2:09:31] paid. It isn't the
[2:09:33] blood. It is the token of the
[2:09:36] blood. It is the life itself.
[2:09:40] Amen. Amen. Full obedience to the whole
[2:09:43] word of
[2:09:46] God titles you to the
[2:09:49] token entitles you to the token.
[2:09:54] How do you do it? How do we get this
[2:09:57] token? Peter said on the day of
[2:10:01] Pentecost every one of
[2:10:04] you in the name of
[2:10:07] Christ of your
[2:10:09] sins they shall receive the gift
[2:10:13] of the promise is unto
[2:10:16] you children and to them that are
[2:10:20] found as many as the Lord our
[2:10:23] God. So this
[2:10:25] morning, whatever is blocking you,
[2:10:29] the Holy
[2:10:31] Spirit, you must break it
[2:10:35] today. Turn aside from it
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:39] today. Repain from it
[2:10:41] [Music]
[2:10:43] today.
[2:10:44] Promise word of
[2:10:47] prophecy will never
[2:10:49] fail. The word has been
[2:10:52] declared. God is waiting on
[2:10:55] you. You are not waiting on
[2:10:58] God. Waiting on you, but it is a
[2:11:02] finished
[2:11:04] work. It
[2:11:06] must when we can display the token of
[2:11:08] the Holy
[2:11:11] Spirit. We have been accepted in
[2:11:15] Christ and that our
[2:11:18] token. All we have need
[2:11:21] of is already purchased by
[2:11:25] him. We are identified with our
[2:11:29] token. The token must be
[2:11:33] ready. The
[2:11:35] blood covenant
[2:11:37] blood is not recognized without the
[2:11:40] token.
[2:11:42] The word assures us of the promise.
[2:11:46] The token is the
[2:11:48] sign that the purchase has been made for
[2:11:53] us. Full obedience to the full
[2:11:57] word entitles us to the
[2:12:00] token. No other way there
[2:12:03] is that you could ever be entitled to
[2:12:05] the
[2:12:07] token until you fully obey the word.
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:13] somebody has put into it. Not what
[2:12:15] somebody has put into
[2:12:17] it or added to
[2:12:19] it. What God said about
[2:12:22] it, he said when he said you must be
[2:12:26] born
[2:12:27] again jump up and down at the
[2:12:32] altar back and there
[2:12:35] and that don't mean all this foolishness
[2:12:37] that we
[2:12:40] It means putting your name.
[2:12:44] It don't mean putting your name on the
[2:12:46] church
[2:12:48] book means death to your first being.
[2:12:52] We must die to our
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:12:57] first. We must die to
[2:13:01] ourselves. Die to the world.
[2:13:04] [Music]
[2:13:10] Young
[2:13:14] people, papa, we need a
[2:13:18] token. Everybody need a token.
[2:13:23] The rich needs the
[2:13:25] token. The poor needs the
[2:13:29] token. We all need the token.
[2:13:33] Oh, what we need today?
[2:13:37] Baptism of the Holy
[2:13:39] Spirit, the full real power of
[2:13:43] God identifies the work of Jesus
[2:13:47] Christ. Promise for this day, not so
[2:13:50] much as that
[2:13:52] day. This day, the promise that he made
[2:13:55] us
[2:13:57] here was seven
[2:13:59] thunders produce a people.
[2:14:03] Seven will produce a people.
[2:14:08] A
[2:14:09] people full of
[2:14:12] dynamics. Without the
[2:14:15] dynamics, church sits
[2:14:18] still the
[2:14:23] dynamics of the Holy Ghost.
[2:14:27] This is the
[2:14:28] hour
[2:14:32] seven manifest people.
[2:14:37] He said
[2:14:42] wait his voices
[2:14:45] to that group that group of people
[2:14:49] filled by the Holy
[2:14:55] Ghost and they
[2:14:57] will open up
[2:15:00] heaven shut
[2:15:02] heaven
[2:15:04] speak God orained
[2:15:06] that
[2:15:08] we on the
[2:15:12] earth manifest his
[2:15:26] power sons and daughters of
[2:15:33] [Music]
[2:15:37] See
[2:15:38] Jesus
[2:15:41] yesterday
[2:15:43] forever the
[2:15:49] pride the
[2:15:51] pride houses.
[2:15:57] spoke in William, like he spoke
[2:16:00] in like he spoke in the
[2:16:03] apostles for this
[2:16:06] day and he can speak from
[2:16:08] it. We will declare it on the
[2:16:13] earth on this
[2:16:15] earth. We are not here to work. We are
[2:16:19] not here
[2:16:21] to
[2:16:22] [Music]
[2:16:23] sick to just struggle and die.
[2:16:27] [Music]
[2:16:35] We are
[2:16:40] here once here on
[2:16:42] earth. Then when we
[2:16:45] leave into the history
[2:16:49] books for
[2:16:51] people who defy
[2:16:54] denominations they
[2:16:56] were defy politics in
[2:16:59] [Music]
[2:17:00] the
[2:17:02] people for the
[2:17:04] word
[2:17:06] people don't change them from the
[2:17:09] word. There were these people filled
[2:17:12] with
[2:17:14] dynamics. Full with
[2:17:17] dynamics challenge
[2:17:21] that men can
[2:17:24] challenge
[2:17:30] within you. The Holy Ghost
[2:17:34] itself when you receive the Holy
[2:17:37] Ghost argument about your life.
[2:17:40] receive the Holy
[2:17:42] Ghost about your
[2:17:47] father. You know that you know that you
[2:17:51] know
[2:17:53] God going back to God. You need the Holy
[2:17:57] Ghost. You need the Holy
[2:18:01] Ghost preach in my life. If I have never
[2:18:04] preached in my
[2:18:07] life, I want to start
[2:18:10] preaching. Have you receive the Holy
[2:18:13] [Music]
[2:18:17] Ghost? Another
[2:18:20] message. Call to
[2:18:23] action. Call to
[2:18:26] action. Oh, church. You must be born
[2:18:30] again.
[2:18:32] Oh, you must be born
[2:18:35] again. It means that the blood has been
[2:18:40] applied by the life of Jesus.
[2:18:45] And if he being the
[2:18:47] vine, then we are the
[2:18:50] branches. And the life that was in the
[2:18:53] vine is in the branch is also from the
[2:18:56] vine. The life that was in the branch
[2:19:02] is also from the vine.
[2:19:06] It will bear the
[2:19:08] fruit that first branch come
[2:19:12] forth branch out of that
[2:19:15] vine that wrote a book of acts behind
[2:19:19] it. The church ever put forth a
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:24] branch, another
[2:19:28] branch, another book of acts behind
[2:19:32] it. The same
[2:19:35] life, it is the same
[2:19:38] life. Oh, we don't want to be grafted
[2:19:42] branches. We don't want the life of the
[2:19:45] message.
[2:19:48] We want to be the original bride from
[2:19:50] the original
[2:19:52] [Applause]
[2:19:55] vine. I don't want to be grafted this
[2:19:58] morning. I don't want to be grafted this
[2:20:02] morning. Be another
[2:20:07] branch where all the promises of God are
[2:20:10] real.
[2:20:12] failing word of God is
[2:20:16] sure back to the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:20] I tell you
[2:20:22] today so many grafted vines into
[2:20:27] its grease and
[2:20:30] things and yet any citrus fruit grafted
[2:20:33] in can
[2:20:36] live in that
[2:20:39] vine and it is bearing the wrong
[2:20:43] fruit. That's why we have so many
[2:20:45] struggling with sin today.
[2:20:50] The message is
[2:20:52] pure. The message William Abraham
[2:20:56] brought allotted for this
[2:21:01] age is God produce a
[2:21:06] people promises of the word for
[2:21:10] today. So we cannot live any other
[2:21:15] life of the master.
[2:21:18] any other life contrary to this
[2:21:22] word
[2:21:24] branch and we are calling you
[2:21:27] today new
[2:21:29] life. I'm calling you
[2:21:31] today produce the original
[2:21:35] fruit original
[2:21:37] [Music]
[2:21:38] branch of the same vine. What we need
[2:21:43] today, what we need
[2:21:46] today, baptism of the Holy
[2:21:49] Ghost, the real
[2:21:51] power of God identify the works of Jesus
[2:21:58] Christ. The promise that he made
[2:22:01] here. Hallelujah. That was what he
[2:22:03] promised
[2:22:05] there. Pour out his
[2:22:08] spirit. Now he has promised it again.
[2:22:12] in the last
[2:22:13] days what he would
[2:22:18] do. Strange that we can always look
[2:22:20] back.
[2:22:23] We are looking back to what Rahab got
[2:22:25] from
[2:22:26] them. We are looking back to what
[2:22:28] happened on the day of
[2:22:32] Pentecost. Are we getting
[2:22:35] today? How we can always look
[2:22:38] back? He said, "But you never look
[2:22:41] ahead." That is the way with man. That
[2:22:45] is the way with man. He's always saying,
[2:22:49] glorifying God for what he did,
[2:22:52] praising him for what he's going to
[2:22:55] do, he's doing
[2:23:01] now. Still the same thing. It is still
[2:23:04] the same thing.
[2:23:08] breaking away from me
[2:23:10] today. What he promised yesterday,
[2:23:14] it is still alive
[2:23:15] [Music]
[2:23:16] today. And my question is just as Paul
[2:23:20] asked them in the book of
[2:23:23] have you received the Holy Ghost
[2:23:26] since
[2:23:29] [Music]
[2:23:30] [Applause]
[2:23:32] you let us pause
[2:23:35] [Applause]
[2:23:36] and think on that statement.
[2:23:41] Have
[2:23:43] you received received the Holy Ghost?
[2:23:48] Since you believe
[2:23:51] without the Holy Ghost,
[2:23:53] you can't come in the presence of
[2:23:56] God. Without the Holy Spirit,
[2:24:00] all the work your pastor is doing will
[2:24:02] be in
[2:24:06] vain. Without the Holy
[2:24:08] Spirit, all the minister's labor will be
[2:24:12] in
[2:24:13] vain.
[2:24:15] Amen. But when you receive this Holy
[2:24:18] Spirit,
[2:24:22] it gives you unlimited
[2:24:26] access. We need to open that unlimited
[2:24:29] access
[2:24:30] [Applause]
[2:24:33] today that the word will become relevant
[2:24:36] to
[2:24:38] us because without the
[2:24:41] dynamics, no good.
[2:24:44] The mechanics
[2:24:46] without the dynamics
[2:24:49] is no good.
[2:24:53] We did dynamics and mechanics
[2:24:58] together to make the thing
[2:25:03] work. I am inviting you this
[2:25:06] morning to the baptism of the Holy
[2:25:09] Ghost. must announce the token.
[2:25:13] What is the token?
[2:25:15] The token is a
[2:25:17] sign that the depth
[2:25:24] [Applause]
[2:25:26] has own the
[2:25:28] debt. I own a debt.
[2:25:32] I couldn't
[2:25:33] pay but he paid the
[2:25:36] debt he never owed.
[2:25:39] This is why when we get to
[2:25:41] heaven, the song we will
[2:25:44] sing that the angels cannot join
[2:25:47] in. Oh that holy angels cannot
[2:25:53] sing. Amazing grace.
[2:25:57] Now seen the
[2:25:58] sound. The token is a sign that the
[2:26:03] devil required has been
[2:26:06] paid. Price of our salvation and
[2:26:09] death. No
[2:26:11] one
[2:26:14] price the spirit of the
[2:26:17] denomination. Not the spirit of a
[2:26:19] pope or the spirit of some man or some
[2:26:23] saint. The spirit of Jesus
[2:26:26] Christ upon the
[2:26:28] church is a
[2:26:31] talking has been
[2:26:34] paid and that he met every requirement
[2:26:37] that God
[2:26:41] required and we and him are
[2:26:46] one. Reban said apply the token,
[2:26:51] apply his
[2:26:54] resurrection. That is because he was
[2:26:56] raised up for our
[2:26:59] justification. He raised us also with
[2:27:01] him.
[2:27:03] Now we set in heavenly places in
[2:27:08] Christ of
[2:27:13] the even come under the
[2:27:18] fellowship
[2:27:21] another
[2:27:24] musicians that is a cutting
[2:27:26] message. That is a cutting
[2:27:30] message but it is the
[2:27:33] truth. That is what we
[2:27:38] need is the truth.
[2:27:42] God help us to know the
[2:27:44] truth. You shall know the
[2:27:47] truth. The truth shall make you
[2:27:50] free. I claim
[2:27:53] that Jesus
[2:27:55] Christ same yesterday today.
[2:27:59] I believe that God give the Holy
[2:28:03] Ghost talking
[2:28:05] right
[2:28:06] now just before the Exodus
[2:28:10] of the church going out of the bride
[2:28:14] going out of the
[2:28:16] church. The token is the word identified
[2:28:19] in
[2:28:21] [Music]
[2:28:22] you living itself out.
[2:28:28] The token is the word identified in
[2:28:33] you living itself
[2:28:36] out. God being his own
[2:28:41] interpreter. Need God to interpret our
[2:28:43] lives.
[2:28:46] interprets your life by the
[2:28:48] [Music]
[2:28:50] word takes your
[2:28:54] word. Identify his word through
[2:28:59] there
[2:29:01] interpretation already
[2:29:03] there. God does his own
[2:29:06] interpretation interprets. As we close
[2:29:10] out Ezekiel 9,
[2:29:13] you and I know the story.
[2:29:16] These slaughtering angels
[2:29:19] were asked to go into the
[2:29:21] [Music]
[2:29:24] city. But before they could do,
[2:29:28] the Lord sent an angel to go before
[2:29:31] them. He set a mark upon the
[2:29:37] people. But not
[2:29:40] everybody, only on a special group of
[2:29:43] people.
[2:29:45] and group
[2:29:47] special and
[2:29:50] cried and made the abomination down in
[2:29:53] the
[2:29:55] city, all the other slaughtering angels.
[2:30:01] So today
[2:30:04] we represent
[2:30:06] that angel
[2:30:08] that went into the
[2:30:11] city set a mark on the foreheads of
[2:30:13] those that are in
[2:30:17] Christ. But the other false
[2:30:20] anointed were sent into
[2:30:23] there. And he told them, "Go ye after
[2:30:27] him through the
[2:30:29] city and
[2:30:31] smite and let your eyes spare
[2:30:36] not. Neither have
[2:30:40] pity." So the vengeance of our
[2:30:43] Lord, the time is
[2:30:46] right. It's
[2:30:49] over. God has no longer
[2:30:53] pity. Amen. The venance of our
[2:30:58] Lord is not something to take lightly.
[2:31:03] The tribulation
[2:31:05] period after we've known all that we
[2:31:07] have
[2:31:08] known. After we know all that we know,
[2:31:14] after tribulation is not an
[2:31:17] option, we need the Holy Ghost to
[2:31:23] do go into the
[2:31:26] city. Let not your eyes
[2:31:30] spare, neither have ye
[2:31:33] pity. Slay
[2:31:36] utterly. Kill without pity.
[2:31:40] Old and
[2:31:43] young. So these slaughtering
[2:31:47] angels, they don't care if you cannot
[2:31:51] walk. They don't care if you are
[2:31:52] bedridden with sickness and you can't
[2:31:57] Without the Holy Spirit,
[2:32:00] he had to destroy
[2:32:03] utterly old and young,
[2:32:06] [Applause]
[2:32:08] both maid and little
[2:32:12] children and
[2:32:14] women. But come not near any man.
[2:32:18] Come not near any
[2:32:20] man upon whom the
[2:32:23] mark and begin at sanctuary.
[2:32:28] Then they began at the ancient men which
[2:32:31] were before the
[2:32:35] house. So Ezekiel 9 is among
[2:32:39] us. There is a sealing angel in the land
[2:32:42] today.
[2:32:47] going through the
[2:32:51] church, all those that sigh and
[2:32:54] crying that have got the charge of the
[2:32:59] hourons, ready to be sealed into the
[2:33:01] kingdom of
[2:33:04] God. We must make ourselves ready to be
[2:33:07] sealed
[2:33:07] [Music]
[2:33:09] today. The hour is
[2:33:12] late. We see the false anointed in the
[2:33:15] land.
[2:33:18] doing more harm than ever before. Doing
[2:33:21] more
[2:33:23] harm than ever
[2:33:25] before by twisting the
[2:33:29] word. The real body of
[2:33:35] Christ is being honor.
[2:33:44] But that minority
[2:33:46] is the Holy Ghost and
[2:33:50] fire to make it into the
[2:33:53] [Music]
[2:33:54] headstone. There's no time to play
[2:33:56] church
[2:33:58] anymore. No time to allow anything to
[2:34:00] stand between you and the Holy
[2:34:04] Ghost. I'll play something softly.
[2:34:08] Oh
[2:34:09] God, let us open our
[2:34:12] hearts and receive the
[2:34:15] message. Jesus is alive
[2:34:18] tonight is right here among
[2:34:21] us. Same yesterday, today and
[2:34:23] for open up your
[2:34:26] house and let the
[2:34:29] messenger, the Holy Ghost come in and
[2:34:33] identify by his own.
[2:34:37] talking is upon
[2:34:39] you then you don't have to take anybody
[2:34:41] else's word for
[2:34:44] it to speak for
[2:34:47] himself. He is the
[2:34:50] word. It is God
[2:34:53] talking to identify his own
[2:34:55] [Music]
[2:34:57] self. She used her house for the
[2:34:59] messengers.
[2:35:05] to use a house for the
[2:35:07] message. All the city that would believe
[2:35:11] under the same
[2:35:15] token the way the church should be doing
[2:35:20] today. Everything that will believe
[2:35:23] under the
[2:35:26] token is the Holy
[2:35:30] Ghost.
[2:35:32] Remember, get under the Holy Ghost.
[2:35:37] The prophet is praying the Lord
[2:35:40] Jesus precious one. When the world was
[2:35:44] in sin,
[2:35:46] no one could
[2:35:47] help. God in
[2:35:49] mercy was showing by a
[2:35:53] type. He was coming and
[2:35:56] talking that could take away sin.
[2:35:59] not just cover
[2:36:02] it but could take it
[2:36:06] away. Jesus came in the right
[2:36:09] time and shed the
[2:36:11] blood by his own
[2:36:13] life making an atonement for our
[2:36:17] sin and representing him back there in
[2:36:19] the form of the Holy
[2:36:22] Ghost. Now a
[2:36:25] token that is to be kept that is to keep
[2:36:27] the church until he come.
[2:36:31] The Apostle Peter said, "The promise is
[2:36:33] unto
[2:36:34] you and children and to them that are
[2:36:38] far
[2:36:39] off as many people shall
[2:36:42] call. Lord, by your
[2:36:44] grace, your help,
[2:36:48] I claim
[2:36:51] everyone's
[2:36:53] message. I claim them for
[2:36:56] God. I pray thee, Lord. Please here this
[2:37:00] morning and that will hear on
[2:37:04] tape if
[2:37:06] they
[2:37:08] were predestinated.
[2:37:11] Lord the word of this last
[2:37:14] day come
[2:37:16] now
[2:37:18] humbly and lay down at the
[2:37:22] cross. They are served as a trophy of
[2:37:24] the grace of God.
[2:37:27] is
[2:37:28] called they be filled with the Holy
[2:37:31] Spirit play the token of the life of
[2:37:36] Christ resurrection
[2:37:39] as they remain here on
[2:37:43] earth granted
[2:37:45] Lord and so this
[2:37:47] afternoon the token
[2:37:50] is a must

[2:38:01] now is between you and God.
[2:38:06] Is not your mama children.
[2:38:09] It's not your papa.
[2:38:11] It is you as an
[2:38:14] [Music]
[2:38:15] individual. God is going to save us as a
[2:38:17] group.
[2:38:19] He's going to give us as
[2:38:23] individual and the requirement is the
[2:38:27] token. When he comes for the inspection,
[2:38:32] will he find you worthy of the
[2:38:40] token? Knocks on your door today.
[2:38:44] [Music]
[2:38:46] Are you ready to walk in there
[2:38:51] with faith
[2:38:53] knowing
[2:38:55] that if this earthly tabernacle is
[2:38:57] dissolved,
[2:39:00] I have one already waiting for me?
[2:39:04] I only have that
[2:39:07] assurance by the
[2:39:10] token. Without the token,
[2:39:13] you can't walk into confidence.
[2:39:17] A token is a musth

[2:39:27] you. Nothing you have to do for
[2:39:31] it. Just accept the price that has been
[2:39:35] paid for
[2:39:37] you. The angel is here
[2:39:41] today even right now.
[2:39:45] You can receive the token.

[2:39:53] He declared it for you.
[2:39:56] He made it so that the devil will know.
[2:39:59] He made that promise.
[2:40:02] So the devil will
[2:40:03] know. You are under a
[2:40:06] covenant. And that covenant is Christ.
[2:40:10] Is between Christ and
[2:40:13] you and the devil is not in
[2:40:17] between. Break every chain
[2:40:21] today. Break every chain in your life
[2:40:25] today. The token of the Holy Ghost
[2:40:29] coming in the name of the
[2:40:33] Lord. Pray that prayer.
[2:40:37] Everyone that is
[2:40:41] predestinated that promise over you
[2:40:43] today,
[2:40:44] every
[2:40:47] predestination to the hour of
[2:40:51] charge is a war between the devil and
[2:40:54] the kingdom of God.
[2:40:58] the
[2:41:00] token to be in the kingdom of
[2:41:03] God like Nicodemus. What shall I
[2:41:08] do in my
[2:41:10] life? You need a token today,
[2:41:13] church. Don't be ashamed of him
[2:41:16] today. Come
