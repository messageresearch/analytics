that once we are in the spirit lord that lord you could give revelation father you are the one that is revealing yourself father is the revelation of jesus christ individuals lord in this dark day where we see all the different pieces of satan's plan being put in place and we are also conscious that lord all of your plans are also being put into place and father we want to be in our place we want to be in our position lord we want to heed the call father we want to respond to the call you said my sheep lord they hear your voice they recognize your voice father and we are here tonight lord by virtue of that call that call to the resurrection that call to the wedding supper the call to lord that holy city father no man called us father no church called us but is your call father no man die for save that man christ jesus lord and your love for us is what brings us together we are united tonight lord by your love by your grace by your forgiveness lord by your understanding by your foreknowledge lord without it father we are nothing lord we can look lord at the resume the story of our past the story of our mistakes and if we look too long we can allow the enemy to to distract us but we thank you that you don't look farther at our past because it's buried under the sea of forgetfulness and we thank you that we could come tonight having equal access into the heavenlies lord because your blood lord you have redeemed us by your blood you have called us lord by lord by name father because you threw for knowledge predestinated us for such a time as this we pray tonight that he would speak to us speak to every son speak to every daughter speak to everyone that's on this call tonight speak to anyone who may hear the tape lord maybe an encouragement to your people maybe a blessing to your people i don't have any thoughts on my own lord but lord you expressed your thoughts to us through your scripture and you took time to send messenger after messenger after messenger lord even the the last messenger the last star lord the last lord lord sign that's pointing to you father so that we can be ready to leave this place father lord we are not preaching our gospel to stay here we are preaching our gospel to leave this place to leave this world behind to leave our cares behind to leave our worries behind to leave our frustrations behind to leave everything behind and to take up lord your cross lord to take up the cross and to follow follow you all the way lord we are not here to go part of the way but we want to go all of the way so lord we dedicate this tonight to you we dedicate lord however we are connecting to this service tonight we want to be reverent we want to be lord sensitive to that lord still small voice that rustling the mulberry tree lord to know that you could speak to us at the point of our need whether it's in our home whether it's in our offices whether wherever it may be lord that we could be one-on-one with you father and lord you'll love it when we speak about you so we want to speak about you tonight we want to speak about your plans your plans for your bride and lord your plans for even us as individuals so father you said we could preach too much we could sing too much we could shout too much but we could never pray too much so lord we come with prayerful hearts lord with different needs and even though this is the bible study tonight lord we recognize that you are still a healer you are still a restorer you are still a waymaker you are still a baptizer you are still a deliverer lord me as the word goes forth and the encouragement goes forth may chains break me shackles be destroyed and may the grip of the enemy be vanquished lord as the scripture said it would lord we recognize and understand the power that dwells in the church of the living god so lord for the caleb strengthen them for the young people strengthen them give us understanding lord may you anoint eyesalve upon us lord even if we have seen or heard this before may we take another look lord lord maybe look until it we look seven times until we see that cloud like a man's hand to see that the rain is coming the rain lord like in noah's day that brought judgment but that rain also brought deliverance we commit to service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen well it's certainly a great privilege to be here tonight once again amidst the the trials and amidst the testings and the mystery tribulations and the midst of persecutions and amidst the headlines and despite what's going on in our lives around our lives outside of our lives uh to be ready to answer the call uh at any point in time that caller that's been going on behold the bridegroom comment drop what you have and respond to the call so i know it is we don't take it for granted uh for for everyone to be here um but it is also uh uh uh reporting for duty as it were as we see the day approaching to take greater heed and time into the word of god uh and in so doing you will unconsciously recognize you know um there's a change taking place you know um for a few weeks now i i was having these shoulder pains in my left shoulder and you know i i made some adjustments in my diet and different things and and it was after a while i realized i didn't even realize when the pain disappeared but i just realized wait a minute but he being gone but it just happened as a result of doing something different and i actually didn't even think about it until i realized wait a minute the the the discomfort i was feeling is no longer there and it happened i would say almost behind the scenes because it was it was not like all of a sudden thing it was just as you live in your day i see but wait a minute it go on and i realized that as you are into the wood and and i'm sure it is with you the deeper you get into something you don't realize what is beginning to change in your life what is bubbling your perspective your outlook and you know sharing it but over last friday you know it has some challenges to deal with but when challenges come the more you're in the wood you get a different approach to dealing with challenges you get another approach to deal with situations because situation will always come that is life life is made up of situations situations that you could control and situation that you cannot control and you begin to realize that in trusting god and understanding how god operates and how as as being part of the gene of god and having the genetic code of god in us when we begin to operate like him we reap the benefits of kingdom operation you know and he realized that the things that you cannot stress about when the bible say cast your cares upon him you know many times i've preached it before people cast their case and then they go and pick him back up again but when they cast he cares on him and they don't worry about it and you walk away because it's either god can handle it or he can't so if you have the faith that god can handle it then why you will put it in god's hand and then come back and check to see what he doing with it that is the reason why when a doctor is operating in the theater in the operating theater they say leave your family outside you know because plenty times people want to put their head over the doctor and it's not that they know what to do you know they don't have the experience they don't have the training and they are well-meaning they are well-intentioned they're not there out of militias malicious intent or or desiring to do harm but the reality is the act of surgery or the performance of surgery is not really a pleasant thing to look at or experience and even though you may be well intentioned you may not have the character you may not have the mental strength the emotional resilience to be able to witness it without fainting without screaming so they say leave your family outside so that the professional can operate so that the experienced doctor can do what needs to be done so what comes upon us that when we hand situations to the great physician that we take it upon ourselves to want to break into the operating theater when he is operating on our families and he's operating on our situation and he's operating on our behalf and we want to say lord how far you reach lord you need any help you want a different scapula i think that won't do sharpening let it let me there you don't go that aggressive no he knows he knows where to cut how to cut how to operate he has all the experience he the doctors trying to understand the human body he made a human body there's nobody who understands something like the manufacturer of the thing there's nobody who understands your wife your child your situation your business your problem like the one who's cd-holting unfold so why not just trust him that is what trust is you know trust is is a blind kind of thing trust is when he could turn your back on the situation and say i'll leave it up to you lord i trust you your degree of trust has a lot to do with your ability to walk away from something when we hand it to him can i get a witness in your house tonight oh hallelujah that that's powerful i know your trust is being able to walk away from your situation knowing you gave it to the lord and have any confidence in god that he is more than able it is not just words it is a reality more than able to do what he said that he would do so we are here tonight and by god's grace i i don't i i think i said it in in many bibles today i don't intend to be too long with you um but we do have a few things to cover tonight and we are still in the book of revelation and you know my wife was asking you know so you know if i'm if i'm still here now i see i'll be here for a while by the grace of god we'll be here for a while because there's a lot of food a lot of substance in here that i believe for many who may have seen it it is worth another look and certainly for those who have not uh it is certainly worth deep study and reflection to see how god is able to to operate as we said uh last week you know like that teacup and the saucer from different perspectives you know and and and and then you see that everything is lined up a certain way and there's no accident with god and god is operating through his word in a tremendous way so uh this is part three a study of the book of revelation part three and we are just going to continue from where we left off uh last tuesday by the grace of god and um we'll see what god will do for us tonight by way of background you would recall um that we we started two weeks ago uh we started in revelation one and we we were speaking about uh john and john's journey um to being on the isle of parts most and and the whole experience that john would have uh that the lord would come to him and use him as his scribe and and the description of god and what uh john saw the seven golden candle sticks which were the seven churches and the seven stars which would be seven messengers to these churches and we and we went through that whole background i i wouldn't take too much time to retouch it tonight um the services are available for you to go and take a look at it again and then last week uh we spent some time on that first age and we were very clear on the role of paul as the messenger to that first huge age or that ephesus age that age that started with tremendous power um but as time unfolded it began to to win you know and and and the enemy crept into that church and we went through the whole unfolding of how god addressed the angel of that age where he first gave them credit i know thy works i labored i patience and how those can not bear them which are evil which is uh revelation two verse two and thou has tried them would say the apostles and nothing found them to be liars and that's the level of strength and the clarity and the focus and the desire to see the truth and not compromise and how they're born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored everything they did was for the lord and they didn't faint and and then we reached verse 4 where we found that corrective conversation nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love and we sort of encourage the church we raise it to the church you know about about our getting back to that first love and and coming back to that place and but iran made it clear in so many teachings that god never walks away from us it's not his nature to do that you know he said we are the ones who walk away from god so if you want to to find god it is about you going back right where you left him you know and through each of these studies you see a message repeated through scripture through scripture you know and in fact looking at genesis we see god actually went even hunting for adam you know so so the reality is god is looking for reconciliation the whole message that he braves here through paul was get back to you for his love remember therefore from whenzo had fallen so he was trying to connect them back from how it was from from from that first experience that position that they had that place you know adam adam where doe you're coming from somewhere that you're not where i left you i put you in a certain position within that position is a certain level of joy and overcoming and peace and resilience and an attitude of not giving up of not turning back uh yes you have rough days i had a rough day today but that doesn't take away from the fact that i understand my position in the planning economy of god and understand that these things that happen around our lives are designed is it it's like a plane trying to fly you know the plane has to deal with some level of resistance some level of turbulence it comes with it you know there's no flight i've ever been on that didn't have some kind of turbulence you know sometimes it's more turbulent sometimes less turbulence but to break past the sound barrier takes a greater level of effort and that effort that that resistance would create a little shaken you know so shaken in your life is part of it you know so we saw in that ephesus church that that they fell from their first love and they were being called to repent or their candlestick was going to be put out of place and and this to their credit that doubted hate the days of the nicolaitans you know and and and we kind of touched on that uh that that that the lady being conquered the hierarchy men in their place and how god hates that because he loves fellowship goes all the way back to genesis where he wants fellowship you know so we come tonight and it's really god won fellowship with you you know you're not here to hear me it's not about me it's it's about you it's about me and my relationship to god as much as it is about you and your relationship to god you know but over the passage of time and even in dealing with the smirnian age which we're going to tonight but iran went to length to speak about how god wanted to be a father to his people he wanted to have a relationship with his people he wanted to provide for his people he wanted to care for his people and yet in the midst of that they looked around and they saw the other nations and they say you know what we don't really want we don't want to lose the blessings you know but we really want a man to look up to you know and it grieved samuel when he heard this and god had to shake samuel and say listen it's not you they're picking a fight with it's not you they are turning away from it it's not you that they are rejecting they're rejecting me you know and that's how they end up with the kingship of soul and and onwards like that you know but but that desire of man to want to be led by a man and the the desire of some men to want to lead man that combination creates this this diesel iniquitation that separates this wedge or this perception of separation between man and god and the ephesians church was against that so all of that led to when you know when but ibraham would draw out all the ages there was there was a greater or greatest amount of light as it were in that ephesus age and as every age progressed through the seven church ages it came down to this last age of aw the seer where there was just a little bit of light which meant as every age progressed even as god would place a messenger and rebuke the age and encourage the age and would call out elect in the age who would be the bride of every age that spirit of the antichrist that false vine that war that started in heaven that fell upon the earth that was not pervasive as there was a shift from the jews to the gentiles is this war climax that we finally come into but to now jump into where we are tonight we're starting now from revelation 2 verse 8. that's where our start will be tonight revelation 2 and verse 8 and you will see that in each or in all of these salutations if i could say that of every church age would almost take the same kind of structure and unto the angel of the church in smyrna right these things say the first and the last which was dead and is alive all right so we know by now that that angel that term angel is a divine messenger so this is not an angel with wings this is a divine messenger if you want to call it man angel divine messenger but it's an angel that is a earthly angel so it's a messenger a stein writer of god with a specific commission a specific authority we read it throughout the last two teachings the level of anointing and authority that he had so unto the angel of the church in smyrna write these things say it the first and the last which was dead and is alive and i want to kind of firstly speak here as you profit would have done if you spun into each age i encourage you to study it again because there's so much in there that you cannot exhaust making this part of your life and seeing how it applies to your daily life i'm very conscious that i'm not speaking to the group tonight this is about the individual now so i want you to always look in the world to see yourself and and and get more involved in the unfolding of this plan of redemption for your life so brother branham brought it out and we know it is the case that the angel of that sumonian church was irenius all right so we know it we study it we know it in sunday school paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley brother random messengers of the seven church ages but i want us to understand the background and kind of take it a little slowly for a few minutes to just kind of see the context of it all right so but i'm saying that irenaeus was the messenger of this age of smyrna here so so this is the messenger that the angel that god is speaking to unto the angels so irenaeus of the church in smyrna and but iran was saying that irenaeus just by background because we know a lot about paul we understand paul we know paul's history we know his pedigree is a pharisee of pharisees he was trained under gamaliel we understand that he was he was a he was an academic he was a scholar so we have a bit of a background and context uh on paul so so to close some of the gap around iranians i want us to understand the background of this man of god arenas he was a disciple of the great saint and warrior of the faith polycarp all right so he would have been a student or a disciple of polycap and it was no doubt so so and and i want to acknowledge here that in doing a bible study in the book of revelation it is impossible i don't care where to read anywhere else it is impossible to get a perspective on on the scriptures and these scriptures without god sending a prophet there is no question about it you could study i'm academic myself and nothing compares to the revelation of jesus christ and the unfolding of it and the role that the seven star has to play in making these things known to us we cannot take credit for it god has to take the credit for it by sending a profit to tie up the loose ends and to make the mysteries known to us that we could rejoice in the clarity of knowing what god is talking about is anybody with me to tonight so the prophet is bringing a background here he's seen he was a disciple of that great saint and warrior of defeat polycarp it is no doubt as he sat at the feet of that great man he learned the christian graces and i love reading stuff like this because christianity has graces with it he learned the christian graces christian grace is is it's it's like seeing uh the christian etiquette the way of behavior there's a nature there's a disposition there's an attitude there's a way of operation that we're supposed to have as a christian so he's saying that iranians no doubt would have learned christian graces that flowed from the consecrated life of polycarp so polycarp had a consecrating life and was one of the truly illustrious scenes of all ages when viewed in the light of a blameless life so by the branham with the eyes of a prophet with his seeing eyes and with a revelation of god that he was allowed to access and with growing and hunting to find and to pull the pieces together which his ministry was entirely loose ends was able to look and see the blameless life of polycarp and the influence that that that polycarp would have had on irenaeus and the reality when you see something like this it may seem simple but the reality is the people around us have an influence on us so before we get into the deeper things the people around us have an influence on us and we have to be very careful who influences our daily decisions because who influences you will either help bring you closer to the lord or further away from the lord all right so i want to i want to make that point who you spend time with all right so in reading there's some people who say well i didn't expect but isaac to go there but i'm looking at these small things because i believe in god details matter you spend your time gossiping and spending time on politics and spending time on the government and these things you may become very knowledgeable and proficient in these things but that doesn't bring you closer to the lord what influences you influences your speech your action what you're interested in what you're interested in finding out about and and and and it has to be clear to you that you have to love the things that god loves hear the things that god anything that god hates so so there was benefit or there was virtue by reason of iranian's relationship with polycarp so i want us in studying this and this is what i say it has to become personal to us check your influences who is influencing you because we are not our own jesus came and he influenced peter he influenced james he influenced john and we would see here but abraham said that polycarp was influenced by john so we could understand the the pedigree understand the lineage of where the influence was so so john influenced polycarp polycarp influence iranians all right so so who is your influence and and and flip this script how are you influencing others many parents say well my child doing this or my child doing that or my son doing this or my daughter doing this and but but what what role are you taking are you giving the kind of christian graces that polycarp would have given because if polycarp didn't give the christian graces and the demonstrated kind of a life to iranians what manner of man would iranians have been so i want us to look at these small things so that it could help shape our lives and that we can take a greater responsibility of our day-to-day work anybody with me tonight but abraham goes on and and you see other state i don't want to be too long but then i get excited but the battle goes on he said you will remember from your own reading that polycarp was mattered you know what a matter is right somebody who who would die for a cause and and there's a stir because of that debt so so polycarp in the in the economy of god you know was a disrupter he was disruptive you know martyrs are known for stirring up think when they die they actually cause more problems in the dead sometimes than in their life because they could stimulate a movement anybody with me all right so you remember from hearing that polycarp was mattered listen to the description and i look at it to say lord what men what what you know we sing that song it's dripping with blood this gospel is dripping with blood he was too old to flee this is the description of polycarp too old to flee and too sincere a man to allow another to hide him so he couldn't run he was too old to run and he was too honest too sincere for anybody to hide him and then have to suffer the penalty for hiding him this is our history this is this is bride history this is church history this is how we get know what we get because if this didn't happen we wouldn't have anybody with me if this didn't take place we wouldn't have this people know the history of what kind of thing i remember in school i learned history of shakespeare and he would share christopher columbus i'm not going to dig into him and nobody taught me in school about irenaeus and paul and martin and thing but thank god for a prophet who pulls things together so we can know our true history so polycarp was too old to flee he was too sincere for somebody to hide him and then sometime afterwards there's retribution behind him all right so he gave himself up to death right is there anybody willing tonight to give themselves up for debt for this gospel hallelujah glory hallelujah i've seen some volunteers and no behind these cameras it have to have some volunteers who willing to give themselves up for debt to the cause of this gospel i know you don't want everybody to know but i know behind the cameras you're willing to do it right so but but listen to the classy way or they say but the brandon said before he did so so he gave himself up there but before he did he asked for and was granted permission to pray two hours for his bridging in the lord for the governor for his enemies and his captors for this to be recorded in history this had to be of note because for him to pray and be granted the permission to this is talk about going out with grace he said i want two hours to pray i want to pray for my brethren i want to pray for the governor i want to pray for my enemies and i want to pray for my captors and like the great saints of all ages and desiring a better resurrection hallelujah he stood firm refusing to deny the lord and died with a free conscience so this was the attribute of that dare but it shows the level of faith and conviction that he had and what he believed in where are people today who will stand for what they believe where are fathers who will stand for truth and righteousness it may not have to be given up to death and die in in reliance then or dying but but that conviction and the grace to live that even in his death he acts he say oh god fire burn abundant captors and and why do you know who i is no no no he said i want two hours to pray and he had just prayed for the brethren he prayed for his enemies and the captors where where we do we see that before jesus are they crossed father forgive them they know not what they do he could have said judge all these romans around here who crucify me judge everybody no that is not jesus he said father forgive them they don't even understand they don't even know what they're doing and and and look look at polycarp look at the life he lived all right he was placed at his stake i know young people are read this one but listen to this so we took one polycarp now he gave himself up to death so i'm saying this because this is the history this is these are the influences that was upon irenaeus who was the messenger of the age so polycarp was placed at the stake and he was untied at his own request so i wanted a picture of this polycarp is a distinct now the reason when you put it in the stake the tire is when the fire come the odds of you staying on the fire is extremely low so it is prudent if you want to burn somebody that you stick to tied into the stick this is not a rocket science thing by your own instinct if you touch fire by the stove your hand will instinctively pull back so if you put you at his stick then then then you would be running leaping you you polycarp at his own request say don't time it and the fire was lit i'm reading i'm reading here from the esponian church so this is another novel reading from right the fire bent away from his body refusing to touch him so he is there untied he fired the lighting fire the fighter that have been away from him he was then pierced with a sword because when they when they realized that he that the fire emblem they're going and pierce him with a sword as this was done water gusts from his side drowning the flames we read about john who they put john in a vata oil to fry him and when they're wrecking me he was unfriable they put him on the aisle apartments as a witch here you have polycarb testimony he said don't time it maybe he was thinking about the the hebrew boys in the fire i don't know but he said no time and when he stood there and the lady fired he fighted a bend this is not the matrix this is that science fiction this is when a son of god is in place and and and and the god anointing upon your life he fires at the bend away when they pierce him water come out of his side drown in the flames but abraham goes on his spirit was actually seen to depart in the form of a wide dove released from his bosom now listen to the prophet now yet for all this great testimony this student of john so remember i mentioned it before it was john had an influence on polycarp this student of john the revelator was not militant against the nicolaitan system so he's saying that that this polycarp for his virtue and his character and his nature and his approach and his anointing he was not militant against the nicolaitan system for he himself leaned towards organization not realizing so he missed this not realizing that the desire for fellowship and what appeared like a good plan to foster the work of god was really a trick of the enemy i remember the branham goes on with iranians this was not so he was militant against any form of organization militant against any form of organization and that's what i love about this gospel this gospel makes you militant against any form of organization and firmly roots in your heart the sovereignty of the local church the most powerful unit of people that could ever exist anywhere on the planet the sovereignty of a local church and the authority of the local elder pastor of that local church where brother branham taught us through scripture there's no higher authority anybody with me tonight so this gives now a firm conviction and a position why where what we do tonight this bible study i can't take no playbook from anybody else i don't know who else want to do this who doing this it doesn't matter because i am taking my instructions from my heavenly father this is a sovereign church i'd rather get permission but it's by revelation by inspiration by operation and irenaeus was clear in that he was militant militant means you're willing to go to war about it it doesn't matter to me what any other church does i have no time i have no interest we have to give an account the pastor assistant pastor ministers ls deacons we have to give an account for what's happening in this church that is how my papers being marked nothing against anybody else that's a word so so so it meant that polycarp's downfall now we understanding now what is happening in the spiritual realm in that season polycarp's downfall was his desire for fellowship letting some compromising irenaeus as a good student watching what is going on he recognizes he's saying you see that kind of thing that kind of organization that kind of group thing they're kind of looking to see who preaching what and which groups coming together and who in the inspiration who in that inspiration who follow it you say i'm not with that i'm militant militant about no organization i want to hear from god anybody with me tonight he was militant against any form of organization also his life history wherein he served the lord was one of much manifestation in the holy spirit and the world was taught with unusual clarity i love that unusual clarity that is what the world needs you know clarity there's so much confusion around the world but what we need in our lives is clarity we want to know how to move what to do we want to get clear instructions not could it be could it be if it might be i don't know i'm not sure and i want clarity because god is clear he is precise he's direct he lays out plans for us there's no guessing and speculation what we know those things which are revealed they belong to us they are some things that are not belonging to us because they are not revealed god in his sovereign power and by virtue of the fact that he is sovereign and he has prerogated what he wants keeps things to himself i'm not trying to figure out what god wants to keep to himself but those things are revealed they belong to us we can act with it we can march to it it's a certain sound for us anybody with me tonight you have to forgive me but we need to be militant about this gospel we need to be militant about the word we need to be militant about our attitude to rising above our situations and seeing the devil where he is seeing god and his word and seeing our place in this great battle hallelujah thus with his strict adherence to the word his powerful understanding of scripture so irenaeus brother branhamson had a powerful understanding of scripture and that is why i believe it's truly inspired that we are fighting to get these bible studies in this place because we have to have a powerful understanding of scripture it is your strength you have to be able to go to war based on this not on well he says so or this won't get a revelation of this where is it in the word brother branham said when the angel came to him he said angel hold up hold up he said check in scripture against what the angels said and make sure it was lining up and you that that was a weaker situation listen to anybody say anything it needs to be lined up with scripture god bring us back to our back to the bible church back to the bible experience back to the principle that was laid on on the day of pentecost anybody with me tonight so we still in verse eighteen we still invested we still just dealing with the angel of the church and the attitude of this angel and and and but ibrahim in many places talked about god shapes a man character he gives them a certain something and is right a mini challenge of the hour so irenaeus would have been formed a certain way natured a certain way conducted himself a situation because of the unique situation that he had to deal with all right so unto the angel of the church in smyrna so whether brahman teaching us would have now said okay he touched on the angel and now we touch on this church in seminar he said the city of smyrna was a little north of ephesus at the mount of the sumona gulf because of his very fine harbor it was a commercial center renowned for its exports this is inspiring churches so you can read this it was also distinguished by its schools of rhetoric philosophy medicine sciences and fine building many jews lived there and they were bitterly opposed to christianity even more so than the romans in fact polycarp the first bishop at smurna was martyred by the jews mattered by the jews speaking about people who would have been privy to the torah privy to the hearing of how they came out of egypt and all these things these were the ones who murdered polika and it is said listen to this listen to the significance of this and listen to how it will make sense when we go deeper into into understanding this age that the jews desecrated their holy day the sabbath day to carry the wood that was going to be used to burn polycarp i wanted to understand the level of resistance here now if you are students of scripture you would understand that there's no work done on the sabbath day in fact when jesus was on earth they had issue with jesus and said well how we could do this on the sabbath day but they were so resistant of what polycarp represented that they desecrated a sabbath day they went and woke on a sabbath to getting wood to burn polycarp so daisy the backdrop of this now this is after jesus raised from the dead this is after the day of pentecost this is after hearing about miracles this is after all these things this is not before this is after all of this these are jews who should have heard witness who should have heard testimony but they were still resistant to the truth now let's go a little further the word smyrna means bitter being derived from the word mu mo was used in embalming the dead thus we have a twofold significance found in the name of this age it was a bitter age filled with death the two vines within the framework of the church we talked about it in ephesians 13 the two vines which is the true vine and the false vine within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness towards the true vine on the path of the force that was not only the seed of the false vine but even in the true vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after pentecost and listen to the prophet no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of listen carefully and adherence to the pure word of god so listen to it again no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive so he's giving a formula of what strong healthy and alive is made up of it is the knowledge of so you have to know adherence to which is compliance believing acting is a part of you the pure word of god are seen in the multitude of examples in scripture so i know saying a lot we still in verse eighteen yeah we are going to fire it and i might have to speed up um a bit here and there but we're trying to take our time as well and make sure this thing sits in so you kind of understand not just that this was a location smooner not that this was a dispensational time in in in in the evolution or the or the unfolding if i could say that of all the ages but to see how does it apply even in now what do you know all right so but the brandon would go on and i would jump two different parts as the ephesian age was but a seed bed for the tragic pergamian age which is which is coming after smooner that was yet in the future this morning age was the rain the sun and the nourishment that ensured that the vile corruption that would confirm the church in idolatry which is spiritual fornication would never rise that was permeated so but the brandon was saying that the ephesians age where the decay started that this age of smyrna created the environment for the false vine to grow and and come to ahead in the programming church age all right so let's begin to go a little deeper now of course we're still in verse 8 and under the angel of the church in smyrna it's a bitter age it's bitterness it's darkness bitterness in the heart of the people these things say the first and the last which was dead and is alive we know that is but ibrahim said these things say the first to the last which was dead and is alive no man could say was dead and is alive but iran made it clear that the first thing that happens to man is that he is born alive and then he dies so this can be man speaking this is jesus who was dead and is now alive he said adam took innocence and turned it into guilt this one this jesus took guilt and turn it into righteousness adam took a paradise and turned it into a waste hauling wilderness but this one is coming back to to turn an earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another eden adam took a life of fellowship and joy with god and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness and brought forth all sin moral decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that wars within the souls of men but this one from all the tragic death and degradation that fill mankind brought forth a life of righteousness and beauty so that a sin once reigned unto death even so might men no reign in righteousness and but ibrahim said in this verse eight here as we have read before he is walking in the candlesticks he's walking through the churches he's walking in in the midst of those whom he redeemed even his church and ibrahim said they were and what were those who were redeemed were not many like paul murderers you know paul was a murderer and corrupt us we're not many like the dying teeth robbers and men killers all true of things of his grace so brother brown was bringing out here that he took these lives of people who had messed up lives and turned them into trophies not their credit not because of them but they were trophies of his grace so there's a trophy of paul who was once a murderer and in it as a trophy with grace stamped on it the the thief on the cross he was a thief but today you will be with me in paradise how much more is a testimony of all of us who know where we come from but there's a trophy of god redeeming pulling and by his grace you could be put up there as well as a testament that god found you picked you chose you can the church say amen all right verse nine we took about 20 minutes on one verse we go in good i know that works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan hallelujah are we ready but iran started off in speaking about this he says the key to this age but i'm not sure we'll finish this one tonight yeah i think we might have to this might be uh revelation 3.5 i have to figure out how how are we numbering it as we go forward you know because this thing i have so much meat in it all right so but i might say the key to this age is most evidently tribulation so you say the whole mark of this age is tribulation how many people yeah tribulation don't tell let's say tribulation but the key to this age is tribulation all right if there was tribulation in the first age by the ram said now there is there's there's no predicted and intensified tribulation so you say whatever pressure existed in the first age now in this ages is is tribulation plus it's tribulation 2.0 it's intensified tribulation all right there's no doubt that what the f that but what the following words of paul applied there's no doubt that the foreign word support apply to them to the mass of christians wherever in the world and in every age so but ibraham is saying that this is something that is in all the ages and not just in this particular age so but ibrahim is saying that god said i know thy works and tribulation and poverty so he says he is walking in the midst of the candlesticks so he knows but but evan said does he hold back the persecution now i want us to get this now because a lot of people you know and and and recently i was in a conversation around this as well but everyone is saying does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation no i don't know your testimony and i am the least to try to be super spiritual i have a real problem in super spiritual people i just have a real child i i have tribulation that is the tribulation that's designed for me i don't know i don't know about you this is my testimony but then i am comforted because scripture tells me that is normal because you might wonder know if what you're going through is normal yes it's normal listen he said i know your tribulation i am not unmindful of your suffering but i barely said what a stumbling block this is to so many people listen to this sir he said like israel they wonder if god really loves them now i've seen good people go through some stuff that make them question the fate christianity the message if god loved them and look it is here in clear prophet in the message of the hour how could message believers go to a trial and then say well god don't love me but i branham breaks it up very clearly here all right like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just unloving if he stand by and watches his people suffer all right so the buddha ran him is dealing with this powerful statement i know thy works and tribulation and poverty and brother branham is saying it can almost stumble you to say but why why if god know he do something about it and but ibrahim goes on to say you see they could not figure out god's love they taught that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care he said but god said that his love is elective now we have heard this before no i realize i'll share my testimony here in this and reading this and experiences is three different things then because i have heard it preach god love is elective love and anything but when you under fire and and these publicity in here you know really you could wonder so it is understandable that brother barnum is trying to bring a clarity around it because if you are not prepared for it you will know the dvd situation when they come and trust me they're coming so his love is elective the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation listen to the prophet so we read it in adoption he could turn the church against you he could turn your wife against you he could put in a better sickness but nobody volunteered i have yet to see somebody volunteer for these things right so listen to the prophet here in this church you say he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose so i want us to not look at the suffering or the situation but look at the purpose right if he did not have a purpose listen to the prophet then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered so it means that suffering is for a time god gone be god already gone beyond this suffering to the after part after the battle is over after the suffering is over his purpose is that after we have suffered a while for a season we will be made perfect be established strengthened and settled i love that i love that i love that after you suffer you would be made perfect i love it one established two strengthened three and settled you know what has to be settled worried you're settled you have peace you have comfort you're not moving anything because you already passed the test if you've had the exam to go through when it back in the days i think they call it what see sick i see i forget they change these things and again hold up but back in the day when you had cxc hunting and you had your oral exam or you have a lab exam and you have work building up to something you have different one paper two paper three people okay and everything after you go through the preparation when you're finally getting certificating your hand at your past you feel settled you feel established you feel like the effort and the journey you went through has brought you that place that you have proof that you overcame so he said that the suffering we're going through is to bring us to a spot that we overcome right as job said he put strength in us you see listen to it you see he himself suffered so he's single jesus himself suffered so it as if you know and and and and in different experiences parents would know this you know what you go through and and after a while you're watching children who sitting and you know when to intervene and when not to intervene because learning as a process and this is what apprenticeship apprenticeship is so valuable because if you do everything for your children if you make the part too clear and they don't learn real learning they will go and do shopping over and over again but but because jesus himself suffered listen he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things he suffered hebrews 5 8-9 we know the scripture though he were a son yet learned he obedience by things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that will be him but ibrahim said in plain language and i hope this helps somebody tonight because a lot of us go into the poor me you know what i going through i was certain place and this happened and this happened and i give up and i think and thing and thing and and god is trying to bring you to perfection true experiences true trials and if it's an easy trial what will that bring out to you you can't grow you can't grow everything easy easy easy you can't go back to standard one you're past that stage you inform five and then with a standard one exam you supposed to be doing universities that table give a given if examiner a for apple b football what growth what job you're going to take showing me a for apple the trial you have to go through has to be fit and in alignment with your role and the responsibility you're about to take if your job require a for apple b football you really want to be working in first year as a little seven-year-old mentor a five-year-old but but when i was a child i speak as a child this is maturity this is big mounting big woman thing so the expectation of your role you're not have to prepare for university exam and master's degree exam in the spiritual realm this is not about knowledge now but it's about the role you're about to fit into the role has a certain expectation a certain level of understanding you cannot be a ceo and thinking like like if you're now entering into the organization and the role that god wants to put you in is kings and priests that kind of title don't test your door just born that to know you have to mature and to be able to rule the kingdom anybody with me tonight so i wanted to see the suffering and the experiences in context situations come and you fly over your hand and realize wait a minute i was someone growing up to do boy i lose my cool too fast today because if i was running the kingdom right now i have the kingdom i'm going through i have to be a little more patient i think they're more soft spoken go ahead and raise your voice too low you set up a nuclear explosion so it's character formation by suffering right so listen in plain language yeah this is we definitely have to do 3.5 next week in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection so this coming to a place of perfection is not by education it's not by sitting down in church and and sitting along and even bible study and when i'm being perfected here and you would you will have some experiences to go through that would shake the boat of your life that you would have to be so dependent on the anger holding the spidey storm anybody with me tonight make you already show away your faith angers you know why did he want it james 1 verse 2 to 4 my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divers temptation knowing this that the trying of your feet trying off your feet trying off your feet is when your feet be intestinal the opposite of faith is doubt so to try your fate is to test to see where on the scale of doubter feet your response would be 3d test your door in the next move but will you have doubt over your feet will you launch out and say lord if you bid me to come or will they say well no i'll never get any life jacket and let me test and let me see if the weather report and and and and where your feet being tested knowing that the triangle you'll feel working patience but let patients have a perfect work that he may be perfect an entire wanting nothing why does he stand this but ibn said in romans 8 and he read the scripture if children and ears is of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which have been revealed in us this is not just scripture there is suffering that we go through to defer to form our character and that is what abraham was pulling out of this thing i know that works and tribulation and poverty but though i rich but i said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this and where the random explains is we know it is that character simply is never made without suffering you look at business you look at anybody who's achieved anything they would have had to gone through a process of suffering these successful entrepreneurs tell you they have failed more times and they have succeeded and it is only after repeated failures making decisions that they learn they learn you ask them how you you're getting in university they say all the books are read and prepare me to deal with the situation but i make this mistake i make and i just i learn i just i until they reach a point where they have an understanding of what they need to do the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering there's no school but always say there's no school of marriage husbands have to develop character through suffering wise have to develop character true suffering oh parents have to develop character through suffering too nobody knows starting out the gate how to be the perfect parent to be the perfect wife to be the perfect husband to be the perfect employee to be the perfect boss to be the perfect neighbor there's no book with it and because our backgrounds and our history and our stories are different there'll be some suffering some changing but you have to learn and this is why i say every week you must be able to look back and say i'm not where i was last week i know i'm not who i was last week i know i'm not how i was two weeks ago and the same thing is happening for you if you would care to admit and look back and say wait a minute you're not responding differently i'm not as emotional and not as as and and you'll begin to see the deeper getting into this the changes right character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot read because power apart from character is satanic but a power character is fit to rule these are powerful quotes we read in church this is the church age where brother branham was preaching this this morning on church age and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what tresses are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation there are people who the first trial come they want to leave the church first child come they want to backslide the first child come and many times not even think affecting them no now let's let's let's listen just a think it's not strange concerning the fiery child that i have to try you that is what peter said in 1st peter 4 12 is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering knows so and we all have trials you don't think about overhave trials you don't think the prophet had trials so it's all of us we boat here is not his childhood smaller or bigger not one but goes through that we are all tried and chasing our sons and listen to this this is now to the church but everyone say the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of god i see god's sense of any church to see what your foundation is and see if you're on man to see if you're on the group and that's why i said i preach it oh yeah this year don't judge each other by some quack it have quacks i'm not going to call them i'm not going to identify it i'm not going to tell you who they are but they are quacks you can't judge each other by them but everybody said they're three kinds of believers true believers make with unbelievable in the church no matter your prayer but evans you appreciate it blue in the face they do what they want to do we can't change that hallelujah by your judge church but how would you stay with the word and how the word is expressed and how it is spoken anybody with me for whom the lord love it he chastened it and scourged every son whom he received that is he in hebrews but listen but if you be without chastisement and we're not to raise your hands but if you don't have any chastisement where of are all partakers then your bastards are not sons so be very concerned if you have no trials and no chance time and no chastening and you know you not getting no licks because if you're not getting licks you need to something is wrong that means very very wrong because you're a bastard another son but all sons who come into god will be tested and tried now to put it in context and listen to the prophet's word now this special condition and simona must be applied to every age there's no age free from it so don't tell me well that wasn't that time now and no no no no age is free from it there's no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god it is needful we need a lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it oh this is a whole next statement now so it's not just you have to suffer and why you need to suffer and you're suffering to get character but in your suffering you're christ-like so you're not suffering and yes you can nobody and yeah you're suffering and you want to talk to nobody because i know you're suffering you want everything no you're suffering you're suffering and being christ-like christ like father forgive them christ like they beat him and he say i would you get a trial you know that trial but you're talking all the kind of bodybuilders your poor boss your boss can't even hear you but you there in your child on your job and all your family knows your boss is a cause a trial is that christ like you go into your child in your home and and and forget it as far as you concern your wife is he trial and god help anybody who comes in conversation with you because you are ready to share your trial is that christ like your husband is a child and they have 29 things 50 100 things that he should do different that if he did it would no longer make it a trial then he go to facebook and he's sharing tips on a good husband is that christ like anybody with me tonight that in your trial you're operating christ like now there's a whole next level you know because you have people who say well i'm a child and i go into an agreement i'm going through but christ like but a woman loves the preachers the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes how shall we know we shall go because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit pleasing us our sons all that he's still in verse niner and i'm just trying to it's just it's just four voices we're trying to touch tonight you know we're still here he's telling the first half of it but the bible goes on i know thy poverty so i know that i worked within western under tribulation we touched working on trump and and poverty but though outreach and bodybuilding said there is again see him walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household household he is the provider he is the protector yet he looks on at their poverty oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this now if you're not in the word and read any scripture and rightly divide any word on the scripture to understand these things you see how you can lose your anchor and you see why you have to be your own student of the word this message understand this sir quality cup was taken guidance and mentorship from john i read it was taking it from polycarp and the reality is they were operating with part lighting or part word in them there were still mysteries that were not understood and opened to them in those days and as each age passed it was unfalling and falling to this age till we have the whole brew the whole blueprint in them if you go back into that day your revelation and understanding would make people wonder if they listen to the idea listen to you you know because you have access to the old scroll so why the discomfort why why why are we so tossed about the prophet will say time to let all the pressure listen how the untreated believers come how can god bear to look up on his own in a time of need and not just stop it all just giving and lavish everything material upon them and by the random goes into it here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of god that too is needful remember he admonished take no thought for tomorrow what he shall eat what you shall put on your father knows the things you have need of he will close the lead and feeds a sparrow so i'll do much more for you these physical things are not the true basic deception necessity of your life for a man's life consists is not of the things he possesses but rather seek he fills the kingdom of god and his righteousness and listen to the prophet and all material necessities will be added unto you so when you do it in a wrong order god will not bless it your script your playbook it's not your world what works for them cannot work for you because you are under a different law a different covenant your formula people talk about the formula to success five keys to success the ladder for success you want your formula seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all everything else will be added to you that is your formula the key to your business it comes from seeking for the kingdom the key to your marriage comes from seeking the kingdom the key to your educational ambitions is because the kingdom and seeking his kingdom you will get access to his thoughts his approach is and god wants to bless you he is too given the power to get wealth but if you don't approach it the right way you will mess up amber branham goes on he says i see your poverty i see your need you haven't very much of anything to boast of what you did have has been taken from you you gladly gave up your possessions in exchange for eternal ones you are laughed at you are scorned you don't have material resources to fall back on and that's a lot of people don't but you are rich in spite of it all you see what the scripture said but though are rich you are rich in spite of it all your security lies in him who is your shield an ex exceeding great reward your kingdom is yet to come but it will come and it will be an everlasting one yes i am mindful of your trial and woes i know how hard it is to get along but i will remember all of this when i return to claim you as my own and then i will reward you that is how buddy branham is bringing it out there but evan said there's nothing against being rich some have gotcha and irish i'm reading same message but money can be such a snail a snare is a trap so god knows that i say some people they want to work for you over time they want to go and do that and before you know it they lost it the joy they zeal the enthusiasm and and is no longer seek into his kingdom his hustle grind make it all kind of thing and and before you know you can't find him and you gasp himself up and they take no scriptures out of context they want to hold on to just the few two scriptures about about wealth and they want to drive that home and they lose their soul in them so you have to balance it what does it profit the man to get you all we're going to lose his soul it's about finally balance but that balance comes from getting connected to the mind of god for your life who promised to take care of you promised to bless you so he was given comfort in this eight i know your works i know your tribulation i know your poverty butterworth rich you have access to the bunker by the sky your father owns the cattle in a thousand hills what you have to worry about don't take don't taught up tomorrow don't worry god will make sure you eat david say i've never seen the righteous forsaken i've never seen a sea bed big the story one time i think somebody i don't even but a brandon preacher i believe that he did uh or buddy the person was praying for food and the neighborhood them and say well everyone buy the food and put it on the step so that they think it was god bring it and they heard the prayer and they went and blinded you from a person he said how many person opening on cd food they say thank you lord for the food that the devil reported but thank you for sending it god will ensure that you are blessed anybody with me tonight i don't want to be too much longer i'm not going to finish tonight and then he goes on i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but they are rich and i know the blasphemy of them would say they are jews and are not what are the synagogue of satan that's a powerful one i want to read that one in the amplified all right i know you're suffering on your poverty but you are rich and how you are blasphemed and slandered by those who say they are jews and are not but are a synagogue of satan in other words in the amplified said they are jews only by blood and do not believe and truly honor the god whom they claim to worship that's powerful huh so but ibrahim went and linked into this and speak about the synagogue of satan and the false vine and the fact that these jews who were saying that they are jews and are not are really liars and he was speaking about the fact that they lie so much till they begin to believe it scary so he said thus for men to swear they were jews would give them a preeminence and a claim to originality tell a lie listen stick to it never mind fact or history just say it and keep saying it to the people and sooner people will receive it now why do we have a people mix in the framework of the church calling themselves jews and we're going somewhere the reason is this since they were liars they could make any claim they wish they could say what they wanted let's do it while and then stick to in and stick to it and in this case it would be lined with a very powerful thought in mind so brother branham was saying this that the the thought of the black stream me was in this in the door it goes out saying they were blaspheming the true church so brother branham was bringing out that the group that inched its way ever so slowly into the church by its deeds no longer fears exposure but is openly organized in a group of its own assembling and but ibrahim was saying this word synagogue is different from church it means it's a gathering of people so he was bringing out how in this age this gathering of people began to grow in strength who believe their own lie who lied so much they could have claimed being jew by blood but the reality is they were not of the truth but they were among those who had the truth anybody with me tonight and he was bringing out that this was the spirit of the antichrist that started way back he said he's praying and christ was not in the church ages it started before that and that's why he typed out how the the children of israel when they wanted a king that was the spirit of the antichrist and i actually read this quote uh i think was the first sunday of this year where brother branham said that just as the early church started out under the pure ministry of the holy spirit i'm getting ready to close in a bit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues and interpreting so forth so in the days of israel when they left egypt they were under the leadership of the spirit of god manifesting in gifts god was the leader of the people actually he was their king he was a father king he took care of israel like a man cares for his family he fed them for their battles smooth away their difficulties settled their problems he just busied himself over them they were the only nation to which he was truly god but one day they got to looking around and they saw the philistines and other nations with kings over them it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted the king now god was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the lord jesus christ but they got ahead of him and this is where i brought this out satan knew the plan of god so he put it in the heart of the people to get ahead of god the word so brother branham was bringing this out to show that even back then because of satan's knowledge of the plan he put it in their hearts and he said now this is of those this is the same spirit that's working his way out to jews people who in other words they're in church but they're not of church they profess to be believers but they're really not they're really liars because their lives their testimony it's not just that they're unbelievers you know but they are the synagogue of satan in other words there are only two influences so if they're not the truth of the true binding of the false mind there's no other vine it's like it's like a there's no other vine all right can the church say amen how tragic that was but ibrahim said that whole choosing of saul that whole rejection of samuel and rejection of god he said how tragic that was little did they realize that when they were asking god to let them be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him because god had ordained that his people act different from the world they are not of the world they don't look like the world they don't act like the world they are crucified unto the world and the world is crucified unto them and by the brain i'm saying i'm closing on to this so he was making a point here is that them which say they are jews right so it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian you know and when i read this over the years in this message i have seen so much different kinds of behaviors that make you wonder if these people even know jesus this is message believers if they even know the lord i reach even knowing the messenger of the prophet but they are saying that they are christians they're seeing any message they're saying they believe but how could you say you believe the message and you can't shake my hand how could you say you're in a message and your behavior is not christ-like because to be a christian is to be christ-like it's not to be like other people in church it's a be like christ and jesus even though even even even if i'm a judas jesus said judas whatever you do do quickly he never even tell them other brothers what jesus had to go and do they taught jerusalem by something to bring back to eat jesus didn't even expose judas that's the nature of christ and he knew what it was he knew what he didn't treat judas no different you don't think jesus knew all along what judas was who he was in fact whatever said judas was there when jesus gave power to his disciples jews were there casting out devils with them isn't that right so not because you say you're jew because what ibrahim is saying here them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogues of satan but say it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you and having the spirit of god in you is not about knowing scripture because or believing scripture even because we know it the devil believes amber ibrahim brought out the devil knows scripture better than any one of us the devil knows scripture you never believe and he trembling and they have message believers who are not troubling because the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom so it is not what you're as but over this is not what you profess is what you possess all right so it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without the spirit you are reprobate you are none of his and i will close out there we have done two verses tonight and we are in chapter 2 of revelation and we have 22 chapters may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word let us bow our head so with our prayer heavenly father we thank you tonight for your grace for your love for your mercy for this time of fellowship around your scriptures lord and to see how lord your prophet was so anointed and inspired and you spoke
