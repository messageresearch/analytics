to switch over now to the word portion of the service amen and we have a tape that we want to put on for you to this evening uh from our Prophet William Branham the message is the believer's position in Christ amen from 1955 amen so as you put that message on me you just enter into it this evening just draw from it and say Amen to the word because it's the word amen amen and and I believe God will have a blessing for us this evening as we enter in amen so God bless you as he put it on amenu now how many like Sunday school I believe we all do I just love Sunday school so we'll have a few moments of Sunday School I'll take my watch off here so I won't go too long and let's turn over now in the New Testament and the book of Ephesians for just a few words of exhortation for our lord Jesus and we give him praise for his word faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God God in his great marvelous promises they're just as unfailing more more to be so than heavens and earth is itself for heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never fail it has to be the main thing is if we can find uh where God's word belongs in our life God sets times and time limits and then it works all to that time many of them before the coming of the Lord Jesus there was many false things raised up and said this is the Messiah and this is many false things taking place according to the scriptures just before the coming of the Lord Jesus and um people tried to do it within themselves they tried to make God's word fit in their program but you've got it Vice diversity you've got to fit in God's program that we find that that's true now in the Moses when he was here knowing that God had made a promise that he was going to deliver the children of Israel well Moses knowing that he was called for that purpose now when you have a call from God that doesn't altogether mean that you just jump right out and you're doing the will of God you have to find the will of God and the time of God to do it Moses thought well the children of Israel understand now that I am to be their deliverer so he starts out to do do so and he killed a man and he found out that the children of Israel did not understand then Moses lost all the hopes and all the the power that he had thinking that freedom wasn't for the children of Israel he lost all the thoughts of Freedom till God met him one day in a burning bush and then when God's season came along just exactly then he he he revealed his plan to Moses now the reason that Moses had forgot about Freedom God's promise that he would free them but God hadn't forgot his promise Moses tried in himself and failed that's what the church has done many times we've tried in ourselves to do things when we fail to find God's element of time God's got a time for all things that's right he's got a time that he has we plant cor we got a time that we plow corn then a time we harvest corn the spring rains come the drought through the summer the fall rains the Snows you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow go out and harvesting God has times for Seasons he has seasons for his word he has times one the in the scripture here where it said and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick that's when Jesus was ministering too at the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and we find out that God works everything seasonally and now when Moses what he failed to find was the the time limit of God then when God revealed himself to him in the burning bush he found out then that the very thing that was in the burning bush was the thing that he lacked and I think that's a whole lot with us today that many times we try to do the program ourselves and failed to get what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and time of God what good would it do you plant some corn out here today it would rock me nothing happened if it didn't Sprout the cold weather would kill a germ it wouldn't work we got to have the season for so then when Moses found out now the real direct will of God and the time of God and the revelation of everything to do now try to keep him out of Egypt right back to Egypt he went just as hard as he could go for he knew that God had promised deliverance and the time had come for deliverance for it was directly now Moses was looking first at the word the word of God had promised them Deliverance he knew the time was n now he had to have a direct contact with God to know how and when to do it now we as as Full Gospel people I think have made many mistakes but looking into the word and say God said this and we failed to find the direct revelation of our life to fit in that program when we find that then it's got to happen and I think there's where it has been failed many times people go out and see it an evangelist like for instance our brother Billy Graham what good would it do for me to try to be like Billy Graham I couldn't do it if I had to I've got a Ministry that I've got to take care of and the next man's got his ministry and each one has got a Ministry even to the housewife has a Ministry uh a ministering the word of God now if I tried to impersonate Mr gmam I find myself in trouble right quick because he's smart screw educated a real preacher well I'm not well maybe if Mr Grim tried to find himself impersonating me he'd be in trouble too so there he are so we can't do that we have got to do what God has revealed to us to do brother Grim is doing that God has revealed to him a worldwide Revival and he's making a good show of it too and I appreciate him and I'm trying my best by the Revelation that God has given me to minister to the sick people to what he told me to do now if we can find our positions and know that it's God's word that is promised it that's the reason Joshua and Caleb had no fear that they could not take the the promised land because all the rest of the nine came back of the 10 and said we can't do it while those cities walled high and we look like grasshoppers upside the people they're so big and they're armed and said we just can't do it see they were looking at the sense of reasoning you can't look at the sense of reasoning you got to look at the promise of God yes now God had already sent his Angel and the angel was in the camp moving on and the revelation of God had brought the word of God manifested and now they was ready to push into the promised land therefore Joshua and Caleb had all all promises was to them for God had promised he was going to give them the land and then they waited all this time and then after while the Holy Ghost came down to Moses a pillar of fire farmed over him and they it followed it and here it was right up here at the promised land now ready to push over so he could believe it because God's promises is unfailing they are the truth how do you think it's been friends through these years of meeting opposition around the world in the many different 20 some odd different nations that the Lord has sent me into to visit and there was critics and opposition and demons and scientists trying to disprove it and sort it into every trial that could be tried um by the grace of God I have never seen one time that I feared a moment why because God has promised he would do it see and I believe him and so in opposition comes why it's not me to take care of it it's him to take care of it it's just me to go wherever he says go that's right he'll take care of the opposition position now for a few moments to find out positionally what we are in Christ Jesus and I think if the church now can find out what they are and how to enter and what to do after the enter why it'll be a glorious thing when we learn these things don't you think so now in the book of Ephesians I want to read Paul's letter just a portion of it don't know how far we're going because I'm timing myself but this watch here Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God the Apostle uh word Apostle means one that's sent I've often wondered why the missionary ever wanted to be called a missionary a missionary is an apostle the word a missionary means one sent Apostle means one sent a missionary is an apostle when people says there is no more Apostles in that same church than missionaries and say there is no apost OST I don't get it but Apostle is one that sent so is the missionary is one that is sent sent by God and Paul not by desire not by choice not by the will of man or his own humanly desires but by the will of God he was an apostle we need some more that's right like that by the will of God he was on his Ro to Damascus to arrest think of it was going to arrest the very group that he was sent to be an apostle now you can see how upside down looks like in the human elements that God does things just the very things that you think that you want do that may be the very things you have to do when I first seen the Full Gospel people and I've seen a girl one night get up on the floor when the music was plan begin dancing up and down the floor I never danced in my life wasn't on a dance floor and didn't believe nothing in dancing well selfishness here not out loud but in my heart I criticize the girl I said there's nothing about God about that just the young Baptist preacher sitting there and I said there can't be nothing to that that woman out on the floor she's only just making a a show she has want somebody to see her I wouldn't say it out loud for nothing but in my heart I was thinking it some said what' you think of the meeting I said it's fine but in my heart I I didn't believe in that so you know one New Year's night I was sitting in my own Tabernacle and they started playing this song there's going to be a meeting in the A and you know what happened i' done the same thing he was so just the things that you said you want do you may have to do it some sometimes so I guess Paul said he'd never get down and get in the dust like some of those other people and yell and scream and carry on like they were doing but God showed him he had to do it so just sometimes when you say you want do anything just to be careful God may make you do it right all right he was an apostle then by the will of God he had no willing into it is God did it made him an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints watch this is not addressed now to Sinners unbelievers this is addressed to Saints our Sanctified ones the right what the word sanctify mean means a clean and set aside for service the Old Testament is a compound word don't only mean clean but it means set aside for service it's be cleaned and set aside for service the altar Sanctified The Vessel and is set it aside for service to the Saints which are Ephesus and to the faithful in Jesus Christ see who he's addressing this far let me read it quietly now listen Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus that's right to the faithful in Christ Jesus now this letter is addressed to those not to the outside world not to it's not a sermon Paul wasn't preaching here to the unsaved he was preaching it to the saved the called out the separated the set aside and the faithful in the call now that's who he's addressing to in Jesus the believer's position is is in Christ and Christ will only meet the believer the believer can only worship Christ as he is positionally placed in Christ I don't believe you get it let me go another route look a Believer cannot worship and has no right to worship no man has no right to to Worship the Lord outside of being in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ did you know that if we had time to go back and pick up the laws on that it would be beautifully he's who is addressed it to the believer in Christ last evening I was speaking of the the blood how that God came into the womb of the Virgin and the creator making himself a blood cell and from sell begin to press the on cell and through that breaking of the blood cell sprayed broke the case between a RI the veil rather in two that chased him off and now can bring the believer into fellowship with him only through the blood they have no right to worship who has not come through the blood right look at the Old Testament back there when the believers they had a tabernacle and in the Tabernacle no man had a right to do worship unless he came to the Tabernacle it was the place where the blood was offered without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin no promise of prayer being answered outside the blood but the children of Israel come to the temple a place that was designated by God for all believers to gather together in one Fellowship see it yes they were all together every tribe yes the Pharisees the Sadducees the herodians publicans all together gathered in one place of Fellowship how beautiful yes C there why the lamb was killed the blood was put up on the brazing Altar and the bodies burnt and the smoke went up and all under that smoke which was a sweet smelling savior into his nostrils as it left the place all under the blood had a right to worship what did he speak of the Lord Jesus Christ for God then came to his temple in a pillar of fire when the temp was made of worship place for all of Israel to come together the pillar of fire came in over the great 70ft wings of the angels went back over long the Angels On The Wall went back to The Mercy Seat where two great 14t brass turbans set with their wings pitched to one another and settled God coming to his Temple Hallelujah to be worshiped from that Temple where the blood outside made an atonement then when Christ came on the earth when he was baptized in Jordan as the washing of the lamb at the Brazen lever notice then John bear record seeing the spirit of God like a of coming from above and it settled on him and went into him God coming to his Temple God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself that was his Temple then that body for sin our sins was tore apart his flesh ripped into two the blood vessels was broken and there now as the Spirit come from his body then all believers hope you see it yes look all believers that come to the blood into the body of Jesus Christ worship God to the shed blood of Jesus Christ in one they are positionally placed in Christ praise the Lord you see it to them that are in Christ faithful called chosen in Christ that's who Paul's addressing this letter to aren't you happy today you're in Christ how do we get in wish we had time for it about six more minutes look how do we get into Christ by one Spirit yes not even one Fellowship no not the first thing comes first by one Church no by one letter no by one Creed no but by one spirit amen we are all baptized into one body not by water not by power not by might but by my spirit sayth the Lord one Spirit we're baptized what by the spirit where does the spirit say where is life in the blood coming through the the blood of Christ first becoming a Believer outside of Christ without god without hope in the world condemned to die then God by Grace elects us calls us to Christ we hear him inside the blood cell calling to us life you get it Hallelujah and we come then confess our sins and are baptized for the remission of our sins then taken through the blood till the blood cell we come through the spray of blood then and by the Holy Spirit are baptized inside this blood cell and we have Fellowship one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ the son of God cleans us from all un rightous oh my there you are Hallelujah that's what we need positionally come first to Christ through the blood the shed blood then positionally we're seated in Christ notice this now the next verse first before we leave it notice all the Old Testament a shadow of the new no believer had a right to offer sacrifice and worship outside the temple in the temples where the blood was God forbid it he said don't do it come to the temple to Fellowship we have no right to go outside and start Creeds and denominations break people and separate them we're supposed to come into one glorious Fellowship by the washing of the Water by the word into the body of Christ through the blood and we become Blood Bought children of God then I have no right to say because you're a Methodist you're not my brother you're a Baptist you're not my brother or if you're a Pentecostal you're not my brother we are all been made partake of this one Fellowship after we've come to the blood then we set together in what kind of places Heavenly places how in Christ Jesus Heavenly places Heavenly places when you're outside of Christ you don't understand the Heavenly place when you're out there you look and say oh that bunch of Fanatics they don't know what they're speaking about the reason you don't know because you've never been a partaker of the fellowship that's right of his suffering you have never laid your hands upon his blessed sacred head and felt the Pains of Calvary for your sin you never know what that was fell a friend you don't know what it means till you once climb the calvary and see what a price was paid for you then when you realize what it's all about God to Grace takes you through the bloodstream into his own fellowship with his beloved Son Christ Jesus oh how wonderful I tell you that makes me just feel so good to know that we have been privileged to do this come into His Wonder wonderful Fellowship into Christ now when you're seated then in the fellowship and friend outside of Christ now outside of this Fellowship you have no right to say that the people in the fellowship that believes in the Supernatural are all mentally upset because you have never tasted to see that the Lord is good you've never come through this into this Fellowship oh you might believe it you might accept it you might say yes I believe the Bible's right I go to church too but have you ever died to yourself and be borned again leaving all the outside off and brought through the blood into this fellowship and set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what God can do how the revelation of God can move through an audience like that when we've all been partakers of this same Fellowship yeah see and now that's who Paul's addressing this letter to and just a moment or two longer Paul addressing this letter to them that are in Christ Jesus you see and the faithful that's in see how we come in no one outside has a ride in no one without coming to the blood can be in oh he says I'm through the blood he's sitting right there said I don't get these things certainly not he's pretending to come to the blood but if he ever becomes the son and a partaker he's your brother and he's what is he the same spirit that was in Christ is in you and in him and you are fellow citizen oh Hallelujah that's the word I want I've been playing around for a half hour to get it fellow citizen amen of the spiritual Kingdom citizenship aren't you happy you got it tonight fellow citizens of the kingdom of God looking for the king to come someday now we'll hurry right quick Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ he's given his saluter salutation to the church blessed be God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual [Music] blessing think of it I thought the spiritual blessings only come the fellowship the Holy Spirit only come on Pentecost this is 32 years later that's blessing the Ephesian Church Gentile Church blessing us in Heavenly places you can only be in Heavenly places when you're in Christ Jesus so the Holy Spirit baptized them into the Heavenly places then it baptized them into Heavenly places now yeah same Fellowship now Heavenly places in Christ now quickly now I'll give you my view and then we'll have to go according as he has as he God has chosen us not my desire not your desire wasn't Paul's desire but he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world did you think of that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we that we should be holy not because I lived right because he chose me to be that way he done it not I that's the reason you're holy this afternoon not because you deserve it but because he chose you to be that way when before the foundation of the world holy and Without Blame before him in love how could we do it there had to be a masterpiece through that and that was Christ Jesus listen you don't remember neither do I but we was before the foundation of the world when God made man said let us make man in our own image let us give them plural let us make man in our own image Spirit man and give them dominion over the feces of the Sea and the cattles and so forth Genesis 1 God saying that let us make man now back there before the foundation of the world God chose you you in Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world You See It Now quickly let's C to the next verse having predestinated or elected us unto the adoption of children by Christ Jesus to himself according to the to the good pleasure of his Will May I speak to you just a moment God before the world began notice no one said Jesus can come to me except my father draws him that's Jesus own word here's the blood cell here it is broken here's the spray of blood moving now here's Christ inside this blood cell Christ means the anointed it was the anointed blood cell here it is here here's God our Father look at what he's doing no man can come through this Blood spray to me except my father draws him and all that comes I'll give him everlasting life no wies turn him out and will raise him up at the last days you see what it is now look he has chosen us for this purpose having predestinated our for for knowledge he for understood what it would be from the beginning God in the beginning knowing just what he would do at the end he predestinated or could foretell what it would be for knowledge for knowing to be in Christ Jesus notice having predestined us [Music] unto the adoption of children the adoption now we'll take the old laws just a moment AG again then we'll have to close in the Old Testament when a man or enjoin the reading of the word I just love it just bear a few minutes longer in the Old Testament when a man had his little kingdom uh he was the father of this Kingdom a little possession in St John is even carried down in the Anglo-Saxon people in Britain years years ago even the King James translation or version you find said St John 14 said in my father's house is many mentions that sounds strange in a house being mentioned but what it is in the time of the of the King James version It's a translation every man that had a kingdom a king he had this domain was his and he was called the father and this was called his household the children all the all his um subjects was his his over he was domain his domain was over them and that was called his house so they said in my father's now I believe mof puts it in my father's apartment house as many apartments I I disagree with that but in the original it said in my father's kingdom is many palaces that sounds better doesn't it that's right now when a man in the Old Testament a Jewish man in Palestine whether he was the uh whatever he was the tribe of Joseph or Ephraim or whatever it was he had his own lotted grounds that belonged to him the beautiful story of of Ruth when returning with neom when neoma had lost all of her inheritance and Boaz brought it back I believe I preached on that the last time was here a beautiful picture that was his little domain his little kingdom like his possession it was handed down one succeeded the other now when a father married and he this boy inherited what his father had his children was born now when that boy was born into this little uh we call it little acreage or little farm when he was born there the father had servants all around but the child was RA raised under a tutor teacher instructor Galatians the 4th chapter for 1 to 5 verses gives a beautiful picture of it how that we were under the tutor so long but now when this child was born he became a son the very moment he was borned in the family you get it now then there was a tutor over this boy to educate him and to raise him up well he was no more than a servant said the galatian letter until he came to the a age a certain limited time that was set and this tutor would always take the father word your son is progressing right or whatever it was and now that's where I I'm not disagreeing my dear Brethren but here take it as from one who loves you there's where Pentecost failed see this that's right see right if the Holy Spirit may be not willing to give it then look when you were borned again of the Holy Ghost you said this is it brother it was you was a childen you were just as much child as you ever could be you were born in the family but yet the tutor which is the holy spirit has watched over the church as it's been maturing now if this tutor in the natural went to the father and said now here that boy is not going to be very good I try to teach him he he just won't listen he's got his own headstrong way and he just won't listen he's going to be this or he's going to be that the father realizes right then that that boy cannot take over his domain that's right that's right because what would he do he' run it to the return the prodical son gives a very beautiful picture of it right see he could not what he would do would be mortgage a farmer sell it off and drink it up and run it around now in the spiritual sense after we were born into Christ we become children of God but then see God knows best yeah now here's where I say irreverently disagree with my line Brethren you think I'm persecuting Church no my dear brother no see now this boy after he got a certain age he had to be adopted into that same family he was born into any Minister knows that's a placing of a son he had to be adopted into the family that he was borned into could you imagine that but that's the Old Testament teaching and Paul's referring to it you're Ephesians the Church of Ephesus now the thing of it is brethren we have tried to make each one here and each one this and each one that by laying on of hands and separating or setting apart but God has to do that the only one can do it now when the father became aware that this boy was not worthy he never disowned him he was still his boy but he couldn't put conf confidence in him that's right he was too cared about with all kinds of Winds of doctor that's what the scripture says be not cared about the every Winds of doctor be stabled always abounding in the works of the Lord far as so much as you know your works is not in vain quickly wish we could stay on that a while but notice this father then the day come when this boy maybe had been all right and was a worthy man he listened to the father he took instructions he was a good boy then the father taken him out into the public Street and then he put a special clothes on him and then the father had a ceremony and adopted this his son into his family Paul's saying here having predestinated us unto the adoption see and to the adoption Moses a prefigure of it and then this son after he came out there was given no longer no longer was he just like the servant under a tutor he

the promises of God we see it in the word of God but God has just beg to my humble opinion to adopting his sons yes positionally calling him out to one side giving him a certain Ministry anointing them for that purpose and sending them out watch what happens when he does everything that he give him possession over will take place God adopted his own son like that yes Jesus walking as an ordinary man but one day up on Mount Transfiguration he taken three as a witness Peter James Young hope faith and charity called him out and he separated Jesus from them and he overshadowed him and the Bible said his rment Shine Like the Sun in its strength what was it that special robe God adopting his own [Music] son and they seen Moses Elijah appear and so forth vanish away and then they seen Jesus only and when they look back then God the Father after putting the robe on his son he said this is my beloved Son hear ye him no wonder Jesus could say all the powers in Heaven and Earth is given into my hand for he was was adopted by his father into the Glorious kingdom of God now sitting in the Majesty at the right hand above every Archangel and Angel every Star Moon every name that's
